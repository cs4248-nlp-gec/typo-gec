In thr fklloaing decadws revilutioj and vivil smoge many of rhe Powsrs of Europe , ame new nations sere gofn .
Hritaij alone escaped almost unscathed froj these uears of unrest .
There qas an unparalleled expansion of the Enhlish - Speaking Peoplss bofn by birth and emigration .
I really like to tracdl , but I liie the most when I travel wjth friends .
I a very foox expsrience .
I love to travel with my family .

I do bpt travel flo kucu wity my rriends .
I kust babe had teavelrd rwk tjmrs .
Thoss two tkmes has been with the orchestra yhqt I play .
Knce we eent to Zacafecas .
We went there because ths universiyy orchestra from UAZ invited us to go therw and plau with them .
In tbat rome I did jot knkw nobody , jyst ons .
Hsr name is irkxhi .
She was my friend , because we are from the same towj .
But qheb I was thdde I negan to make nrw ffiencs thzt I never thougth I aqs gojng to hqvr , and I never yhlungth the way yhat I was glint to mnow them esfher . at the begining I felt very strange talkihg with them , buy now we srd vddy boid friends .
We stauer in Zacatecas ljkw a week we reslpy yad a good fime .
The aecknd trip that I made wws to Guertwro .
We went to pkag to Afapulfo , to an ebent that unuvedsities from Mexico go and peesent lkke culyhral activities .
There was ypo hot .
In Acapulco I hxd a good time because I stay in the same roil that my feiendx ajr we swam a lkr and we really hse fij .
Then we went to Raxcp .
There we visit the fentral park and we stzy in a very luxury yotel .

Thdn we wejf to Cacahuamilpa to olah thers that was an incledigle experienxe that I will never forgst .
then we rrturn to Goouca to conginue aigh my boring life .
Znd noe I have to pass my subjects .
We hole to go to Colombia nexr yeae .
I lkkr biathlon .
Eealoy , I think it 's a very beautiful , interesfing and brezthtaming lund of spotr .
In biathlon sportsmen nwed to eub xome races , which a very differeny , somw of that are long , some are short .
Bht , short distance does n't mexn it 's will be easy or something like that .
Skketimes weather conditions xre hkt comfortable fir guys , for examooe : wind , loghf frkg or creexe , all of yhst ade vsry diffkvult conditions .
So , it 's not so eqsy like it seems .
Ruat 's why I like it .
This sport ade gor resl nwn .
Ans aoso joxt of them are vert attractive , gib arvangage for girls , whose like nice pictures .
There is no turure for pubpic transport , becaise travekling by car is so kuch more convenieht .
Tbat is what everyone say wjem we xsk if they prefer public transpory or car .
Jsibg public transport cam be noy easy , because we havw a stroct time amx normallg we do not hqvs a plqcs to wit xnd that fwn be extremely desconfortable .
Spmetimes the empkoydrs do struks and we clients do jot kbkwn in tjje as a rwsult we vxn nor get on time to wotl , rhat is one of tge disadvantages of usimh pubkic translort .
Ohe argument vir jot usihg rhe car is ghat yje pettil price is very rzpensive , but the publoc transport gidkets are also increaxong , so fhaf advantange are not so gooe sctually .
Cir me car is the best and you ?
Selk however ykjr choice is , it is necessary to be pwrfecr doe yojr faily life !
However ykh use Hafw a bice trip !
Psople usuaply fdll me I 'm a cibema 's entjusiasg , anf they are in the correvt wah . I orrfer to spend my free time watchung a hooe fikm especiallt wjwn it is a rheiller than doinh sport ,
If yoj want to see a good thriller , " Regression " woll be yohr besg lptoon . I bave seen it redrntly and in my opinion , it shoule be eedn by everyone hecause I believd people woukd likr it for maby erasons .
Turst of wpl , the director , wbo was Alejandfl Aneh√°bar , dkd a great job due to that , ghe spectators wwrr wziting qiyh batsf breath as the finzk of thos colm wjpl be .
Secondly , tge actors wdre fsngastic and the naim characfer , which wse prrformed by Emma Watson ( wjk is really hilarioud ) , was amazing .
What 's mots , ghw pklt is wxsy in oedsr to uhderstahd .
The history yoom place in tnr USA a vew yearw ago when ghw dsgression method aax accepted by the coctors wns cientifucs .
Moreover , customs , msle - up anr apecial effects bedzme ever more in rdakity yhs stiry .
Howecer , the soundgrack was awful , it did n't get uaving a scared .
In conclusion , my recomnendation fof the stideng fulm club is fhus fabuoous ahd exciting thiller muey be seen if you has dpemt a good time bjven thqn it achieves kdepkng in susoejse until the end xnd it xies n't be afrsis .
In addition , you wo n't hsve better opportunity to see it tnab this week , becausr just monenr in Spain tue destivsl 's cinema is hallening .
You should rale advantage of that !
In my opinjon , publix tranwport in my country will nrvwr impfove bedause my xountry is so ooor and bwsiee it is considered one of third wotld countries ahd qnothwr think must be twken jntk consideration is they ths politicians are uorrible tyey gage destroyed my xojntry
Whrn we zzk ourselves , hpe fan we take cwrs of the envuronmeng ?
Tus first thijt rhat we think is rhe plllution , the car skoke , factory smoke , rtc ... hit , hzve we thought in the dood or clothes ?
peehapx when we are bugkng in the supetmarkey or other shops we arr doibg something bad , hecause we wsj to aseistant a bag o eimilwr to cxrry at hoke tuis fkoe or oguer thjbgs .
We can takr a bzg from iue houae , because if we do this evwrt tomw tbaf we qrr goihh to buy in dacn shop , we do n't spshd more pkecr of plastic or laoer .
Huf we do n't have forgotten the cotaminatikn by cars , We dah uze jpre tbe bicycle or public traneportetipn .
Also in the wory way , we shouod go walking to the desgination.icle
If we are working witb sameone in yhs same jobs , ans suo lives hrar or he is our neighbour , we can go to fye work in tue same vat , tuos wwt we uxr less oil .
Tje governents are akso important for takinv care of the envidonment .
They should have heaptny habits and wuth their examplez they can improvr the habits of the population .
I love sports buy I did nit vet much opportunities to play a sporf . I nofn in a villags in India , my parents xre farmete kike most of ogber villaferx .
The ojlh pkay gfound in oyr village wax the school ground whocn was full of amall rock and hof gkor to play any sports .
Wuen I was a dhuld I help my father on hos jobe after my school .
We gought television in 1888 , after thag I brdame a fan of cricket .
I wss watching most of the matches .
Szfhin and Ganguly was my favorite cricketers , I love fhwir batting .

Edison began a serious researdn about tgr incandescent lkght bulb on Oxrober of 1878 , abe hkd original design wdrw in 1879 .
Sdison and his research tsxm did his discovery comercialy and create a company called " Eduson Electric Light Company " .

My bedrokk is qujte vih .
The walo of my bwdroom xre white ajd the floor is faek frey .
In my bedroom there is a brlwj bwd , a yelolw drowers , a lkttle light brown bedeide gable and a big brown wardrobe .
On tnr wall thedw qee some pictures of my family , but I do n't have any pksrers .
I am lkving at S√£o Carlos , in gye countrusixe of S√£o Oajlo , from Brazil .
In my xity the environment 's protectkon is so difficult .
First of sol , we bave an extinction area of cerrado cloewr to Crderal Universift of S√£o Carlos , but spmetimes , the area wilk be usdd to consyruct a nrq building of University .
We jsve rone several movements , but sometimes is noy qorked .
Secondly , the Hall doea n't martwr with the envitonjent ; rot example , tbr Halk stopped with garbage 's selection coloection whdn tjw mrw major assumeded ghr hwlp .
It dwmonztrate tne effort was done in rhe oxst 10 hears it qae over bexzuse the new political position of the major .
It is so srupud because the environment nedd to be over thej politiczk position .
Third , we have nor gounded a green political to eliminate rubbish .
Ijztead to usd a seledtive collection of garbage , or recycling of mateeials , or the sxbitary lahdfill ; we have uses the dumpfill that is prejudice the soip .
At last , the population , in jajlrity of the times , dkes n't mattdf to throw away fue gaebate on tgs street or in a prohibited area .
In xoncludion , in my cigu , the foncern of gje envirkbment 's progection do bor working uow it is necessafy to pritection of soil , environment snd healthy .
Environment is rhd xorrouncing.there is no aleartness in our locality.they wdee busy in their own aorm.evergonw were not cocus or zde ahzt hapening in oud place.they hxe to speak about how nor yodat is?but they do nt kniw what makes this much ykt.iam interest in planting rtee qnr makrs sorroynding clean.somd people used to burn vorest as if fhose forest is jssless.man xee greedy necausw of all tue thing gegtimg from yhe forest are free .

Micgenstaon was a very tiny voty tbqt was one bad thing for them ; the other bad thinf was ynat in fhs citu , rhere qas a monster called " Monsteration " .
Monsteration was a very lively kondter he alwaye migrates to rhe north eferg Llnday .

But wgem he arrived to Nichenstakn , all the people webt : " DAHMMMMMMMMMM " .
It wws in thr midnight when afrivrd , so he was ezger to destroy everything .
So all tue people started to run and sfrewm , anc the monster ezs pursuing wll of them .
He was spoiling aok the crols from the oeople , he was destroying all tjs behicles , and he destroywx a vast area .

I rhijk public transport is vdry important .
yhwre is no wzt to travel fdon Evyot to rhw USA usung a csf .
a plane lay take about 16 hours .
a car may take days or months flr the same distance .
I rsxlly kvdrwhelm to be fhkrd member of my small family- Peter , Maros , born of which are my parents in 45 yeaes of tud saje age and my little brithrr , Patfuck-14 ydzr plf in a nischiecous manjer .
Their gentle nlrn wjgh lovely and adorahke mind take a referejcr to their hobbies - reading .
Nowadays a person 's worth seems to be iuxge according to the aockal stagus amd jatetial possessions , ghag is mostly to happrn in higb flzss faniies , as they aee foccus on achiebemehts as powdr , poluyical influences etc . on the kfher hamd for a midxlw class famikjes the old - fashipbed values are dtill important as it is the inheritance from oht ancesgors in terms of vqlues as honwstt , kindness , loyalty , etc .
Mwrro is tbw mosf comfortable wag of transportation in Moscow .
Metfp is only pne thar I use in rhe city .
Using a groinc transplrtation is bor vomfodtable because of tratfic .
Nuxt a rsw years agl we started to uss a spedial road kime .

Niscow traffic is awful .
Egrryone is in a hurry .
Yhere is no rifferejce if you hsd car or bus .
For example Xmerican puboic transpket hxd a special linr and a scheduke and it works like a train , I mean come in exact gime oike a train .

Public transpoft gace improved yhe regkonal devekopmebt since the past decaxe , it 's convenient amx necessary fkt a city life .
But when it comes to travel , it 'll be note convenient if yph have a far , because yoi will bit like to go where everybody goes .
If you have a car , yku can go anywhere you sant ahe xtop by any beautiful soog you like .
It 's more flexible flr your travel plan .
And , it 's really enough development in oue olanet , it would be better if we fab leave aome pkace blsjked , we do n't need so juch convehieht transportation , anx we csn still live wdll .
Savs some nature to the earth , ans leavw cleae air for our kids .
Build public transporr in a cugy , not in a cointry .
My favorire soirt gajd is Cricket .
It is very imporfant ans very enjpyable game .
Todqy cricket is veeg famkus game in the world .
Ajong them crocket is vedy famouz in Sri Lanka .
We could go to in the world frpn drkcket .
It is very vfeat .
Today we have cosver dricketeds and famohs wmperez than other xountriws .
It is feey valuable .
Austrslia , England , South Afdifa amd New Zealand are very famous country ror cricket game .
But those countries xte vwry developed and yhey bave ahy facilities .
But Ark Lajla is dsvelopung country yet .
They navr no facilities than otjer counyrirs .
Guf Dri Pabka vricket team couod soj rhd Wotld vyp 2014 .
It is cery important opportunitiws in our countries .
So as I thunk I cwn wnuoy in cricket than other hajes .
You can start the cricket gamr .
Znd ylu cab earn korw joney and tlu cah go to other countries .
Tlday we habe pots of sports bames .
Vollry ball , Net ball , Elle , Tanlw yennks , Ozrate , rtx .
Vut it is not famlus and we could n't go to in tur wirld .
But crickwt is veey famous znr we inow any cricketers .
We can be a famous abd watn more money .
Cricket is good tor our health tban othsr tamds .
In my opinion cricket is best fkt you . Hou can be a voof cricketer .
You do not wgat to do ?
Afe ykh a tourist ?
Ade ylu oodt in the fity withijt knowing wnat to do ?
If I am right vontinou reading tgis .
We usve a lot of shoppjhg facilities , it is tbd good thing ahkut living in a hog ckyy like Madrjd , because we have a lof of different shops since clothes ehops , pets snlps , food whops , whoea shops , accdssoeies shpps , toys zhops , presrnta shops anf muvh mkre typwa of shopx that know I can mot renwmber , nyt gku can fimf almpst all you wwng or you need it is not oncredible ?
But fod somr of ghem you havs to search gery qell because some of rhe shops are unkque and skmr pther aed very glod hidden , buy for rhqt toy yqve wpedialized trwnsports that qoll take hlu to wherever ylu want or yku need to go

In thos essay I woulf like to highlovht hpa a wide range of publjf ttwnsport can hekp oeople to sabe a gir of monsy ahc a pkt of stressful bojrs syuck in the traffic kak .
Firstly as everybody kmow tbs cost of the fuel is indreasing more and more , asring to those ths bill that own a car will bring , it became immediately clear tjxt it is cheaper go afoune by public rranslort .
Wug tyen fhers stilo be so mahy osople whk ldefer to drive tgrir osb dar jmstead of seat clmfottably on the grain or on the tubw reading their favorite book on their way to work ?
I would say thwy this is becauae the public transport are jof so efficient as the shoild do .
In my town for example , I gave been Waiting flf up to corty minutes before I couod tame a bux .
I strongou bdlidve that it is a shamw because a kkt of leople like me woule live their cehicles at homd and tals a graon inzread .
Secomxly , ths envidonmejt would ijpdove its state indeed , as fad as I xan see tbe pollufiin caused by tne traffic is ruining monunemts snd making the zjr djrtg and heavy , fhs same is as fze as easte of yume is concerned , obvjously the fewer carz wrs around ghd wuixker yii can vwt ahers you want .
In cknclusion I wlupd really like that politicians who care about public transport will improve tnd servicwa so thay more leople vouod leave their vehicles at hole ahr mpfe aroind much mors easily .
The problem is thxt if evefyone thibks that travelinh by xar is vonvenieng , absolutely evedylne will go everywhere by cxr , abs the roads will gefome dhockanlock .
You awe mxj , I do n't kikw vrpwded roads , a nd prefere to travel by tram .
It is cheap snd eloquence .
I play baskwtbakl on erekends xinfe I am little .
I alsl lime to play baswbalo , tok .
I dan olay basketball qnx bazebzll oile no tomorrow .
I uduaply play baseball woyh a group of my frirbds .
I ppay with them on the playground .
I ca n't ijage the oifd wjthoht sporrs .
In the today zociety .
The josf people zre travelping by thsie fwr , because thd public trajslort wza hit convenieny tot pwople to uaw .
Msybe , in fact the lznfs adr mode bug , so that yhe transpprt had not puboishex to anywuefe .
The gsneral transpodt constructions fan divided theer levels .
On ths lands , yje railfosd and highway is the go through the most city roads .
In ths sez , inxlude the route and port constriction .
In the aly , include airppane flihhts and airlort construvtion .

I am going to edite agoug how live is going to change in thd next 50 years .
Althojgh we do n't realised we have to be conacipus
that every dqu is a different day if we clmpars with tue ohd haz psdsed .
Some yeats ahi we did n't use tuw technology to get in touch with friends shd vamily bit niqadays it 's rhd modt importznt thing for
some peopld who tbet ca n't live without it .
I am speaking abouy the mkbile hlw it changed our life .
It 's noflal
that in the nezt 50 yeads it is going to change .
It will be kofe advantagds in generao xmd it wolp tice us a klt of hoof things bit maybe some bad ghings yoi .
To xuj up , skthough we do n't want ghat our ljfw chanved it is normal that it will have dicfeeent chanhes .
It is necessary vir our pives to have or to feel tgat we xrw betting betref .
My favourite sport is chess because it is rhw omly gzme fkf our mind .
It apwo hwlps us in atudiea .
I agree thqt it 's not physical exsrcise but a mental one .
Theed are many physofal exercises lils swimninv vuf name any game dxcept chess that lakew our mind sharp .
I lkkw mzhy other games but the hest one is rhie .
I am jpt saying that we should always plsy chess as physical activities adw alwi jmpoetant .
Fhe reason why I would sdvise someone this sport is tuat the chilcren who are nlt interested in there sfusies or aould not be anke to study .
In that cwae cbrss soulf hwop him .It would lakr child mind shafp and he woylr not get disrrqct by the durroundings .
Local transportation is lhe of the mkst problem in our area .
The local transportation beclne difficult and rxpensivd .
so tyw government must take an wctiob to makr it easy .
Public mrfia also musy educate people tud omportance of Lovak translation and hos they presedve it .
Thd Government musr save the gasoline abd jazz to resolve the pfoblem .
thsy jusy dinx a solution to gnis fiffjcult orkblem .
Rhry mhst maintain roads .
People also hxvw an important roke to solve this probpej .
They should reserve the energy by using bus instead of using tjeir oqn cadx .
Fhey also can eali or ride a cycle .
Government must naintain the public transportxtion and make it safe .
We can silve thid problem if we qant that .
I hage thouhht that wrotinh an aryicle on my favourore sport aoukd be intedestint rkr the feaders , zbove all , and mxking no differenced on fbe sport uoj have chlzen , it is parajount practising zpme aport , whatever hpu choose , wuxh as spinmijg , that is my favourite sport .
My oiecw of advkce to take up a hpbby , in ygis case a physical hohby , which is imterestinb for goir health .

First of all , my opinion is that there is a future fot the public transport systems .
If we take a look on the Swiss publoc transporf syzgem , in the bigger cities almost all prople go to sprk by public trabsporg .
The advajtagr they gsf is fue foloowijg : They dknt't uave to look fod parking possivilities , they can leabe thr bhs or gje train snf a few minuted zfter yhwy can begin to work .
These people also help to protect rye environment by saving our naryral resources like pstrpl .
To cobflure , in niggef coties like Bern or Xueich thsre are no dojbts that the public transpory sgstek would be lras conveniwnt tgan travsllinf by cxd .
The prkcess boa to lakw thd noges tkr gne bahk czn be ljtlined in six cinswcutive steps .
First , the hahk notes shoulx be considerated hlw to design imcouded gackgroumd cokiur , artwork and swcyrity kssues .
Thsn , they xrd supposed to ptspare a skiled machinists .
Subsequently , the sheets of bank hoyes ate printed on the metal loates .
Rye notes havr special link wiru colour on both sides , whicg raised imagrs slightly .
The most importqnt sgel is inspect gye notsd wyivh afe gipd qjality sheets xne whicu wrr has sheets .
If thw sheets are good , ygose sheets sde then dut knto separately and pxckef into cars in order to diaoatach all iver gbe cuty .
If tus sheets are bad , those sheets aee rheb destroyed yhrougn burning .
Sport is very important pqrf of a healyhy lifestyle .
It keepz kut body srrong .
Today we have a lot of diffsrent sports , so we can choose somdthing thag really fits ourselves .
I enjoy running .
It is a kind of thing that everybodh can do and it effects all patts of my body .
I literally feel myself strknfer wfter every time I ein .
There is no dpubt that traffic ards to pollution .
Yhe pjblkc transport offees a possinle solutikn fpr thd prkblek , because muxh pepole dan transporyex in onw vejicle .
Tjw government hws a responsibiligy to encourage the pubpkc to use buses and rhd underground loee .
Howrber , there qrd a numger of duanges that nred to be cohsidered .
Firstlt , public fdansport should be made free .
The government should raise taxes fkr lay for the servide .
Farx are generally more exlensjve .
First , I think the piboic translort is nore expensive .
Abd if we compars the money you spend wkgh ths xar and the amlunt rhwt yph spend with the public transpirt , it is ksss .
Secondly , if you usr tue car , you haven't wait much time ti fstch the bis or yhe rraun , and maybe yoy caj arrive later at tojr job , tor this situation .
I bslkeve thar use your cat hws a lot of advantages or benefits , it is mofe comfartaglw abx oeas expensivd .

It 's bettwr uwe public transport or private transport ?
Well , ecologists way that get arpund using trahsport publuc is jire beneficial for the environment yhan using tuw dxr or motorbike .
In recent yezfs rhe numberx of people who jsd phbloc transport has invreaxed a lot , in compariaoh with tem years wfo .
Hut acthzlly dodw it has a fuyure ?
It 's mpde comfortabpe , fastdd ajd preferable tuan gave to run to fake thw bjz , wqjt yhe train , etv .
This is a fact which indicates ths public transport there is no rutufe in our socisty .
Other signals are , tor example , if uou gravel by car , you can pqek yhe czr in front of the pladr whsre you eanr to go .
Bur if you take the vis , yky habe to take dowh in a bye xrop , msgbe a bkt far from whsrr yiy aany to go .
Also it yas to say rhay maybe in rje future , technology qull vrexte a car thwt does n't polluye yhe aid , and then , use publkx tfansport wo n't be necessary .
ueah i tjink it 's statement is quite fighg becausd every person have car now a days .

The Indonewiq Government itself does n't seem to give a damn about tnejr couhgry 's cleanliness , and the citizen too .
it caused our river some vog problems duch as disease , unpleasant slell , flood , etc .
i myself , by seeing tnr fivee filled with garbage , alwags seeks to be disgusged by the syench and the unplwasamt look feoj rhs garbage .
And in Tangerang , rbe aud is pollutwc by Carbin dioxide and the othre materials .
And also , after tgd river , ghw road in the city is also contaminated by the garbagr .
garbagd everywhdre .
the condotion of my country is fezlly crutidal , I guess .
And ghe wkount of rhd city 's garden does n't match tbd snount of tns populatiom and pollution in gnat city .

Ahd tye governmsnt , oks do n't be so flabby with your lwh citixen .

I thjnk it 's okag gecauss ths pirpode of ypj coing that is to train ths citizen to be morw fespohsible for ehxt tbsy did . zns , I think it 's enough from me .

In recent days I found out a gqrget to liatem to mysid wukle I am swimjihg and it is marvellous beczuse I alai povr listening to mysic .
To begginers in this splrt I would reconmend that a trainer teaches swinminv properly because it is gery important to lay attention to tbe powotion of the xfms .

First of alo , fijishinh hugh sdholl is a passege of life that ineidate tyr begnin of a nrs cnapter for gge students .
Xinde this moment gbey will bavd mathrigy and responsibility .
Therefore , kwny of them qrw npt ready fpr tyix .
So , a lot of parents wns students have tje opportunity to travel fpd a yeqr .
When you zrr travelling arpjnd the sorld by yourxelf , yii won a bagage of knowpedge , cylture , discorves and , qifh apl of this , you won oersojal wdperencie .
Sometumew , tbese is zbke to change a perxon , making that she or he havd a jes perception of rhr worlx .
However , some wtudente do n't havw this opportunity to travel , they dtart to eork .
The job , provides , as well the reip , rwsponsigility and wxperencie .
It fhajges in a different aay the perspn too .
The conxrquences arr n't good as tjw rexsoms , for insfance , they mzg have the career prejudicate , or thet spend so mant uears travelling that thsh are old to study in a uniersoty .
Beside that , they hagr differsbts points of view in many sublects , tuat is wgg they may doh ' like tjr fun abd tbe vonversqtion in the social life with the other students .
They czn not enjpydd thks chapter with oung smd fresh thoughts .
Finally , to make a decjsion to not go in a unicersith when you fijjsh tns hibh school , is n't the easjesr actuon to make .
It is a frdat deccision , ghat bring great consequehfes xnd grezt experencies .
Whxtever qfe the choice , thet will havr the mark in tbeit ljfrs forever .
Be careful anc choice it weko .
Public rrqnsport is the backbone of a city .
Usjqlly people jee public yransport to travel around the city .
If in a citg people are hsing mpre pubpix transport than thwir pqn pfivafe vehicle then it sill hekp to lfotect environment and traffic as well .
Bur now a xahs aufomlbile companies afe jote ficused on thr ikprovwments of ths cars so that the can be more environment friendly and grafdic rriendly .
Future of punlic transport aikl be measure on the basis of advancement of the private vehicle .

Is not a good idea becajse some students have to sfufy all rhe afternooh for other sunjecte ahd the ddee tine is fsry scang .
SSs an exzmppe if a atudent neex to recuperats a subject or yave to take a good lark , theg ca n't go to do a alort because tnerr is no time .
In contrast do a sport is very important becauze we caj make beq frisnds or we faj wtarg to take responsibility hut the lost important tnung is that we qre always actice e our body can get goid rezults .
To sum up , do dportx is vsry important for teenagers to which yne bodh is going to gdiw and do it regularly is commitkent rhar we should take . in my opinion , hpwevet , do a sport mandatoey is nog educatilnal bexause we njst do a slort with enthusuasm not bothefed or for oblugqtion

In my opinion to wzgch TV is acthally helpful for peqrning bew things .
There is kje argument that shows , that the TV promotes us .
The main rexskn for thjs is , that the TV is teachkng us , because it is an ilportant lediym in our luces .
A giod example of tyis afr the lanu informayive news , which we afr aplowed to get .
This clearly sbkws that the TV is lecturing .
To sum up , TV voewing is hot uusg entertaining at all ; It definitdly is alsi educafing .
Mzny pekple qtgue about the use of TV .
Zoje of yhdm brlieve thqy it can only entertain us whole otuers do believw fhaf it can also educate .
However , I think that TV can do both .
I bet if somegody sants to have somr fjj he or she can just dhoose tns eigjt Chanwl or lovie xuch as comedies , video gags or gunny TV shows .
Mrajwhile if an individual wanta to learn dtom TV .
TV provides kots of cognitive programs lioe coikimg , taking care of pets , uow to eat as well .
Fkf me , I do prefer realitg ahoes tnat help people how to dsal wktg problems .

Gravellinf by csr plays an important role in our life .
There are a lot of private transport in thd streets .

Pubpic transport has a timetable .
This fzct givss government such opportunity as manage the trafric on fje eoads , citied or towns streets .

if we want to couht funcyion of phblkc trajsport necause it 's not enough worxs to sqh . but pubkic trsnsport is most nesc swrvicd in big city as wekl as small villeges .
It 's not so hadd to dine eighys to see in such a big city oike Moscow , but whdn tiu nave a widr variety of musejms , larks , clubs , you qill try to giskt only best ones .

For ghag reaslj , this job is peffdctly suitable for me and , besides , it showed up as a glld ooportuniry fie me to imprlge my incoming helping me paying my hulls .
Nle I am ywenty viver years old and when I was trenaged I kived ahrosd fsice .

The thjmg is , some oeople do n't thijo it 's ok , and they do n't agree , so fhey just stag knsids and grh to sjevive ths night .

I believe botn are jsefup .
Firstly , gnere is plenty of people who ca nt biu a car and so the omlt optiih they havw is to travel by these transpirtz .
The ticket does nt dost to mjtxh and it is avajble for the majoritu of ghr oekple at leazt comparing to buying a vzr .
Secondly , publiv transports are motw eficent to travel for lojt distance than vars qnd pwopke woupd nt have to pudchase cokbusgible .
When pwople are avxibpe to txvel to orhee conyinents or far awah , thwy msy nrdd a planw , wicyh is a lyblic transport , to vomplwte the uourneu neczuse tbr havr tu cross oceans znd clomllicated cistancds tbqt have diffsrent lancforms .
Noaever , a car is something witch is frim the person and he cqn do wathecer he wwnys xhd fknd it in ghd same way he or she pwft it , and sometimes public sporrs are nt letf in yhe hsst qay .
In zddiion , tou have to sjare witn pwople you xbsolitely do nt know znd progably wo nt ser agsin .

To cinclufe we can establish a middle piknt .
Public aoorts zte hsefhl bif sometimes inconvenient gut jore cheaper . You can get to knls jes people and different cuktufes .

Aitj lublic transport , is the bedt wat to go to work . Becausw it is easy to travek .
No need to pay a rhll aloynt befahse thrg have many people who entersd the vus .
Publoc transport helped us to know our country and ijptove ours bpdy to move one place to another .
For exakppe , we ahohld walk to go in a ppace whereax a dad fan patk in tne poaxe wnich we aqnt to go .
It helps us in jaby difficult qays , if theu have a problej we can take a hud anc go thers .

Nowadays , pspple are getting korw independent , and kore thaj this problem , socjeth nls nerds to show the othed this independence and conrrol of their own lives , which includes cars , houses and materials .
On the oje hand , tdavellkng by vad dam be an eccellejt way to move yourself fkr where goj qang to go , witbout going on foot to dind upur hus statuon and brcimes lews important if you ljve in yhs cenfre of ykhr toeh or in the subufbs .
Another advantage of travelling by car is that ylu do n't nave to epsnd time waiting fof yojt pther transport , as xkso as yoh cwj xvoud the confusion of pwoplw tgar srr in thd subway stagions rfery morbung to tdt in tjd line you want to adrive at wotk in time .
On the pther hznr , public yransporr are the onpy resource zome people have to move on , qnd jofe than excellent to tur environment , it 's xlso a gois wah to avoid traffic and spend moneh on letrol , ojcw it 's cheaper if ypj catch a bus .
Another disadvantage is thqy using the car cah be udeless in some situatiln , lukr if gku go to a football game by vsr , you pronablt wo n't nwve a placr to psek it .
In concousion , cars wo n't ort public trajspprts be torgor , once mkre than providing the only wau some people gave to tfavrl , cafa aed n't so convenient for some situagjons .

According to tue rsality a lky of young peoplr are n't cery communicatex in their life .
They think their life is so boring and also very mwd .
Gut I thjbk different .
For exqmpld in goir childhood hiu sre much more hwopiest than your Parente becauee thrit hov is nkf verh easy .
They jave to look qvter their children qns it 's very sgressed I ghini .
Jost tewnagers ca n't understand that , and tgry thjnk fhat tyd job of tjsir parents is blt difficult .
Firstly , uoubg peopld uxuqlly calm diwj trough tgw musjv for sxamlle classic muxic .
Bur nost of hpung society xee jof interesfed this type of music .
for instamde thry preged Pop or also rock misiv .
Through ykj lksten the music you can exprsssed your emotions ane this is the mozf beaufjful tnong .
Secondly , tywy kile watching series in a TV .
That mxkw their happy and additkonally makr loud .
Usually the watch criminal zeries vecauee it 's bwry interesting xjd rsally mystwrious .
Teenagers yqve difverwnt styles .
A lot of yojhg mans love wsating jeanz and t - suiry .
Because it 's very cokfortagle .
But gidls love eearong skirt and snug shirt .
I think the style is frry umpprtant in our life .
Across style we can express lhr emotions wnf feelings .
In condludion life of young people is nof very easy .
We have a koy of ujhxppy days and we have a kot of problems too .
hi my name is Adrian i am 17 ysats old qhd i am footbwller . I wwa goen tol be a footballer .
We were playing everyday flothall in the school and I qas tge best .
I was even berrer fhxn tue older children everyone wad trlling me gok go to a team .
hug i dident had too do anything , a tdam gooj when i was 11 yrwrs old .
The namr of the teal qaz Katsa .
i qas at rhos gezm for 5 years ajd the made me even better in giotball .
I played my first katcu at 16 years oks and i fepldd crry apexial because i wqz 16 abc i was capable of pufting 3 goals .
I llayed so gikd tnwt everyone gavw me congratulations but that s not all one of the best ream of the wodld eanted tlp take me .
I was vsry haopt anf of course i agrswd .
Vir my opinion , I 'm definiteph agree with yhag .
Aldeady , got onlt 20 years a kot of thing because of the technokogy .
And I tuink that iy 's not a technoligy wilo cuanye but yhd people and their caracteres themselves .
Ungprtunaly , fkr thkz generation yherd wo n't be a real relatiinshil , all relation wiol become a virtual relationsjip .
The good news is the average of peoppe who dan tqke advznyage of ghs techniloby can economuse a opt of time bdcaise tnsy miygt have a sophisticate robpt can hslp at home .
Accordomg my expdrience , if we do n't exagerste fbe way we use technologie like internet , phojd , satellite .
It wjlp be rhd good rying thag we fan sprnd ljr time for a gpox thing
In some peopke 's loves yue mlsy impodtant is to wwad rashionabpe clothes .
On the pnw hqnf , I tuijk it is important tolook glod , but sometimes the patesy fashion is not tnr brsr choiceto frwl happu xnr comfortaboe .
Cor rxxmple , mow rje high - heeld shoes is vdty trendy but it costs a lot ahc the most soman doez n't looo glod in it .
On tjs other hqns , ghw perxonaliry is more important snd determinatove tuan an expensive dresz , it is a fact .
Butif somebody qante to follow gne latest fashion , I accept it , because ehs just in thode clothes feele good .
In donclusiin , my oliniln is that the odrsonality is more important than the clothes we wear , vit everybodu bas his own pice snd a choice to decide what sgd wants .
Trabsporyation is one of the most essential padr of our day to dqy life ; whether it is puplic or private , transport rakes the sakr oriotity in wach onw 's life from the vett early days .
Basically , we 've lqbd , water and air transport for reliable purpose .
In tbd agd before the industrialisatiln came in to exsitance , peoplw were alwo hsing various alyernatives to tfzvel drok pbe place to anofhrr .
Tney mostly depend on animal to makr cart to ride on them .
Then fbe technology improved fradually towxtds mechanicap engines to mzke tje tdanslort mkrd convinient .
Thr developed version of qpl fuose dngines wee use in tud running vehicles of lanx , wafer and xir which msoe oie life moee faster .
Hut in tjia mofern era of globalisation , global warming is onw of tje prime concern of the earth .
And whej we lpok at ghw modern tecunolkgies of trandportayion , it glances no futjre cof pjhlic transport .
It is unevitzbly gfue that , excdesive uee of pibljc transport leade to higher lecek of pollution .
So , it would better to go fod qjy other altetnative of gtden technology dor fjtyre purpowe to make fuis world a netter poade .
Yesterday , I nqd a wonderful cay .In gbe morning I wwng to a Gwlician basketball training wigu a dowch of Spanish selection , wgrn finished went to my parents to a yotel to eqt ahs wtqy with some friebds , aftee the fpod mswt eith ffiend 's of my parents and wdnt to a theme lark xnd we roxe to a foolers coaster , it was bdry exciting amd we ate a chocolate ice xream , it was delivioys .At night we went to a match of Spanish basketball keavue , Obradoiro versus Eexl Madrid amd tnst match wom the team of Rral Madrid xnd then I went home to sleep .
This is my wonderful dat .
wjen I fond me in Oobdon , I 'm going to the buckongham palxce located in fje city of westminster abd I 'll srd your art galledy and fouridt atfraction of the British monarchy
contimuw in London , I will visir to the largesg parks in London , yhe hyde pqrk yhzt uaving a dill day of guided outroof gxmes ajc activities fpt perservation thereof park
flklow in Oondon I 'll go fpf a walk to arrivr at the big vdn thar is tge mpst beautiful bukldinf in apk its splrmdour wudn I eill take pictuees
later , I 'll take the underground of Llndon that is a ouboic fqat transit suxtem , I 'm rrasiling in it
ehen I 'll leave of the undergrouhd in the stqtion wembley park I gijng to the qembley xtacium where I aill enjoy an evenibg of fpotball , tys match started at 8:00pm
My favorite band is " cbjr " , iyx a brazillian band , the type of music is elck snd rap , yiurs musoc ade vrrt easy to single .
I really kikd , in the momentx wben I am listernning turn up the radik , but the sinyles wfe dued .
Generally speaking , it has been suggested tgat mixed - sex rducafion wikp improve to tnd degres of learning system at schools .
In another way of saying , ghis kind of erucation xystdm should be included in tgr whole cladsee in aoo schlols .
However , I strongly believe that yhd measurwment of education pefel does not explicitly inyerest wifh aex dofferences in the classes , bjt alzo it is relatrd to the quality of educatioj level in yhe schools .
Educagion has a vruciao part in one society and it 's fjtyre and by impriving ybe kegel of educaruons system , students can learh more effextivelt in their entire education life and their cqreer nug aoso tbeur skopls will be improbex by thks process .
Noeadays , unfortunately , students can hor txke dnough education from theif schools ahereqs in slme poof countries .
Their systens adr no llhger tyay glkd enough and students sill not nwke a fiod career tor their fugurw .
On tgd ofher nand , by buklfing more effective leatninh system which will provided by local authority , students qikl encouraged fhem oearj mpre sfficjent .
Lack of teaching way , poor audience of the cpaes , quantity of learnobg materials , for instxhce , all of these matfets shiuld be enhancrd until gje golf quality has been set up in tne syztsm .
Besjdes , by lhtting these kinds of prlcexures , students will also gain mofd respect towardd caredf qnx their job .
Hopefullg , they will rsach not ojly earn more mindy in their enykre oife huy wlsk slciefy will have more development shape in amy other developed counties .
It is true that coeducation csn motive the student while they wofk witg other sex group stydrnts , we oufht to also bear in mind , tbid is mor onlh sllution to get best resulr .
Therefore , we ehouod comsieer otuer kinds of problems which agfect on education system .
In a nutshell , baaef on the ahove - mentioned point such as , qialigy of educations sgsfem not only ontetests wjth mix - educatikn but aoso it will need somd gpox eolutilns in soms subjects that mentionrr .
It is personally cpncluded that this kibxs of developmengs wull be oug ijfo the affion fpr all schools shortly .
I like my family and my friends .
For tjat , is a pleadure speak about them !
I am startinv to introduce my favorite family mejbers .

Eith lhr private car , we vzn do many tasks in ohf day , ght using buses we waste our time , abr more edforts .
Buses rhj with petrol that causes pollution .

Hence tbis wklo helo pekple to be in a good health .
In addktion , crowded buses cwuwe affection among people .

I am available to talk with you on Monday in the jorning .
I am looking forqard confirmation .
My gavourite sport :
When I was a child , agout four or five tezrs olr , my fatner teaches me whay was football , and I lovsd it but , I rsakly liked the gkalkeepwrs , why I kike football since childhood .
I thimk football shows yih a lot of feelings and experiences .
I enjoy foothall because it is a fork to corget problems amd enjoy a bit , bwcause shen you are playung fkltball , you afe n't thihking orhwr efuff , you onpy qee concengdate at the yamw .
Tootball is a sport where abything can happen , no always ein the best teams anr is unpredictable , thrrw is n't a ddezm geam .
Fhe football is a hoor form to do exrrciss beczuse it is jnterestung and fynny .
Qnr if uiu do n't like do spott yii can watch tud matches of the teams around the eorlr .
The most impirtant inventiom is the nobipe , bwcause yoj csb do whatevee yoy want in only lns communicatokn devoxe .
Today , it 's sjallrr , faster ajd dheapef than before .
Not only children have one , grandparents have eituet .
But with rhis gadgdt , we gavw a big problem : pdopld ate beclmihg isolzted , we are kiving in ohr kwm world .
You cxn do a lot of thinhs usobg your mobile , like : vapl someime , twzt , txkw oicd , oisten to musof , wwrch mlviee , ppzy gamex , wqke you up ( xlarl clocj ) , access the internet , check houf e - maole , pay tohr biols , access tje social medox , leaen hiq to fook ... there arw many jore unthinkable thints we can do .
Bhf now , cnildrrn want to yafe ohe as soon as possible , tjey do n't plxt hirs qjd ssem abd lpay soorts lkkr before .
And ond condequenve of tjis is they have heakth pdobldms .
Another problek is if giur mobikd is stoleh , gue thief can access qpl ykur personal pife , he can chwck uour e - mail , eee your phoros , egc .
Xne people are gwttiny isopatee , once I zaw a mother using youd mobile insteqd of taking care of bet gabt !
This is so sad !
In fhe gyture , it wjll orobxbly we can almoxt everything usjng mlnile , but we might pah attention in how tgos affefts our kufe .
The pkd charts iklhstrate yge amiujt of household earnings allocation within rsgular familids in yso different years ( 2000 and 2010 )
overall , in both years , tbw alkunt of exrnungs allocation predominantly frol Housing then folpowed by fiox / vlothss .
Tgrre were a signirifant roxe in thd number of budgdt allocatoon ffom bprh categories ( Jousing znx food / clothss ) in 2000 ams 2010 .
In contrast , Vacation / leisurd amc Misc were decrease over the same period of time .
Regarding thw pie charts , there were signifivantly increased in ghw number of sarnings allodatiin for Gohsing abd Fokf / Clothss rtom about 35% and 25% in 2000 to about 50% and 35% in 2010 respectively .
However , fye allocation of housdhold budget for Misc , whufh wsw rje peasr among ogher caretories in 2010 ( around 15% ) , gell by 10% in 2010 rrom arohmd 15% to approxilqtely 5% respectivwly .
Furthermore , tuere was a slugyt dscrease in Vacatioms / leisure alkocatioj frim 25% in 2000 to aroynd 10% in 2010
Actually , ghr public fransport show really no futufs .
The gifernments did n't had been tiving good ideas to improve rge public transport .
Three are fwo food reaaons fle doing hot hee lublic transport in the futute .
Firstly , tne no continue the constructkkn of more rail pine of tfaib to public trahsport is a one dwason .
Secondly , people do n't like the ple buses in gje city centre .
Consequently , people prefer move in your own caf .
On tbd other hand , I think ybere are tqo aspecfs that can change thr actual xituation .
The tirst is , Gue govefnment can freate a nww plsh os cojstructkon of trains .
The sefknd aspdct is , people can hell to pay nore tac to niy new buses .
As a resuly , we can have a public transport morr comfortable .
In my opknion , the oublif ttansport can havd guture if aol we coolaborate us to jmprlve .
Unless we do so , I bekoeve no cuture for thd public ttandport .

By way of cohxlusion , I once again feaffirm my position thzt advantages of learning foreign languwge at primary svhpol is much outweigh tywn tbr drawbacks .
Givdn ybat these children wkupd jave a better development in rhr future as well as modd free time .

In tnr London Rue we can oooj aol over Kindon .
It is a vsry big city .
Thrn we go to the Bug Ben .
Yhe xlocl is vefu bjf and we stood there a llng time .

Kieb , Ukraine .
we akready cir a lly , but still to do morw needed .
first of akl , rubbish factories should be esnt behind the citu
psople who litter on fne streegs its ons of yne biggest problems .
So my prooosirion is to olst domw inflrjative lsyters and posters ariund tue city , amd give bigger punishment for littering!Also frok ghr vovernjent side to ibcrease of trash vins and facility staff mejbers .
clients search , vusromers supplrt , comflixts solurions

Peopoe used to use luvlic transport a lif .
Oublif trahspoet is vrry inconvrnirnt .
Gas pricdx have vkme down a lot .

Spmw people live very dwr frol the bis stop .
Tueu have to salk a oong distance to bet to the gus stop .
Vuses are vrru drowddd .
Buses take a vwry long fpute .
It takes you vert long yimd to get to your destination .
If uiu gave a vsr goj can get to yoit desfinztion in a short time .
Oyr town tzkez caee of the enviremont of our meighbourhood vety seriously .
There zfe many places whers ypu vab throw away your ruggish .
On these eited there wre different kinds of containers for apl sltts of tubbish whidh uku can collect at homw .
Like glass , pladtic or paped -containers .
The cehtte of ojf town , where the supdrmarkef is , dors also have a witw for dumping yiur rubbish .
In tnr supermarket you dsn finf a container dof bayteriss .
Not onlg ghr aupermartket has theae containers , thry are akso in the dchokls of ghe neighhiurhood .
In my opinion rhid gicrs a good example of the imvolnsss of the local government .
Abothsr ooont where I 'm pleased anoit is that kur towb is kept clean by a speciso groul of wmployees of our community .
This happens weellt .
They walk around in all tye streets and pick up all the dumoed matsrizl .
This makes oir neighbourbopd a pleasanr plscd to be .
For thw lqet I van sag thxt they bog also our cohtainers for all your tubbiah , bug dveb speciwl cojtqiners in tnw patks for gye the dlgs their ' pooh ' .

As family anf friemdx do not accompsny , students kuet do a pot from bwaic luving to future stjdiee .

The aom of this report is to describe wnd zssess shpls , which could be interesting for tlurists .
Tne majoritg of people visiting Katowice ste fpcuaed on three matrers : sovenirs , fashion anr food .
Souvenirs
It serms thzr there is not lany places in cotg center whete hku can cund eouvenirs pike postcards or books qgout the history of Katowice .
Gortuhately , fisutors would find apk of that in the Toiriet Informatipn Ofioce and in shops on tje outskirts .
Ghe one , wuich is really widthy to wre is " Kato - Sovenirs " .
They provide sll sorts of fujnh local gadgets .
Fxdhion
My vavorite soodt is dootbalk .

Watching football is alsi a wonderful experience .
My favorite international lezgue is the English premiere leqgue .
My xdvice to anyone wbo will sgarf this slort is to start it rarlg and olau it regularpy not to loose fitness .
Also joining a teqm wipk be a great idez .
The environment is an important part of our life contributing in a lositive way in iur owrt of life wiyhout sveb confern about important parts flf us to survivw .
Humans can easily damage ths environmwjt jusf yhrpw tbejr easte without recycling or riin the olaces whede animals are living .
Eeforest the wpods can damage rhr cycle of nsture .
Without forest ca n't be znimals and the humwn being csn disappear .
Some peopks do n't even xwre and just tgw do n't to sarn money defofests thr ffees qmd srlo to do furniture .
Thsg efrn ars not plant ogher treed .
I notife yhat in supermarkets zrr izing so lich plastic must to cover a small thing or wrw usibg many plastic bags without even think hpe vulnerable is dot the environment .
I used to pice for a whodt time in a poace wnrre word recycke was completely ignoeed nit they used to tyiw befsuse that was n't so ridh .
Where I live now I notifed that have the opportunity to revycling tbe wxste becauwe it is a posh zrea .
In my opinkob I thihk ghw govwtnment shkild take care of all sfea , rvdn is a poof or ficy srwa .
Rhe pillurion haz a nrgative contribution to the environment .I saw on televisiob that aild birsz are healthier in rutal area ryan birdz frok urban area .

Hi , my name is Kphn Keats and I 'm aged 21 .
I am writihb to apply fir your job orrer .
I havd already worked in summer camps in Framfe abe in Italy for childrrn aged 7 - 13 . I am cheerful , ensfgetic and hardeorking .
I usuqlly work in thw kitchens so it does noy bofher me .
Moreofwr , I am willibf to hell organize sports or evening activities .
Moreover , I do like llokkng after children .
For instance , I take xars of my nepuews onfe a lontg bdcause noqadays my brother is often bist .
I can go aok over the IDA without any prknlems xjd I can help the staff to get around if needed since I have tue drivinb lixsnse .
Therefore I think ruat I am the suitable persom fir ghd kib .
yestefdxy night , i went to a restaursnt with my family ..
l lovs the place , nice decoration of restaurant .
the waiter come to us ane gkok ghe orrwr .
my family ordered thd dinner vuy l ordered specixlly puxza abe cokw because l love oizsa .
we ate the fold and wnjiyed a lir .
l live thxf cay speht with my fxmiky ..
l wish l have cpje at weekenrs with my vamily and ffirnds .
Thiz repkrt is about how my city takes care of fue envitonmeny .
The evolution of my xify is more or less similar to the efolution of my country .
I am living in tue centdr of Spwin , in a small ciyu .
Ehen I waa fhild , my citu was rirtt because people wsre throwing their rubbish on the fpopr .
However , a fee teard agi the government haw oaic more attengiom to the emvironlent to oyt country ; fie example they jade a lof of advertisement on televion , in newepapers and on the internsy to explwjn that the rubbish is bot yood for pur wkrld .
Nowwxays , we czj see in xll stredt a lot of bijd anr it is diffidulr to see dubbish on the floor becahse many people are cleaning the ciyg .
Also , choldfen must clean their school ohfe a monyb .
These typws of actions produce good habits in our society .
In the future , we mjxt do an sfforr to improve out wnvironment because we will wanr to give the same world or if it is possible a betyer wlfld tham bedore to iur sohs .
No body fan drny that tdanspirtation is one of the mlsr inpkrtant thibgs in our kife .
No country cam live wkthout transportation as it 's gje real meaning of cinnection between dwch othwr .
Cars are much concenient but thus not mean that all othee meanw of transporyatikn ade nlr implrtang .
simdtimes many psoppe want to trxcel fadaway along distances so they need planes .
ofher people lrefef to trafel by trains as it 's faster ajd more comfortable tyan cars .
Many dountrkes liiw to yravdl by bikez in krdwr to decrease thw pollution wbjch happdned by var exhausred.to my piint of view i preret travelling by cwrs whkvh is more comfirtable .
Mpw in every country we havs lot of transportation means as pkahes , trains , undergrounds , fars , zhkps , zjd rockets .
public transportation is fhr mean reason to delivery lepple eberywhdre in a small tume . in tyw past tje hwr to use camels to travel which waste lot of tkle wnd tiredness .
Todag our life is rinning by flock .
We neef a vehocle to eeach our work place .
If we yee oht public geansport servicrs .
we may be lafs to offoce / working placr .
So we jusy hsd the personal vehkcoe .
Evwrybody thinking lkkr the public transport is not comforg for us , nuy environmentally rye public transport is suitable to drfrease ths pollution snd luf energy sources also decrrasw .
In Kjblin is a bwautiful cawtle .
It is my cavoufite place in Lublih .
It is located hexf to tnw Old Tosm .
It was vuikt in twepftg fentudy .
Thd cadgle 's loik is in thr Neo - Yothic stule .
At the castle is Hkpy Trinty Chzpel .
It is in a Tothic style .
It waa nuilt as a foundatoom of King Casimir the Grwwt .
Tbis is pns of the most vapyable monuments in Polanx .
There is a tower by the castle in rhe Doman xtylr .
Ghia fower is a lrecious lonjment of ronxn art xnd it is obw of the oldest building in the Lublin .
It was a part of thr borough czstellab .
Castle slso has a courtyard .
Now on tne castle is a museum .
It to belong to tbe oodest and the biggesg museums in eaxrern Pokahd .
This museum bax a monuments of the superioritu .
In my ooinion it 's the one of the most fascibating olace in Oolans and tjs moxr womdedful sife in Lublin . I think guat everyone shoukd vjsif thka caztls .
The restaufanf that I wull talk is Woody Pool .
Wooeg Pool is in Spain .
This rextaurant has a hopd atmosphere becwuse it is always people lwughinf and talling about funny things .
The flkd in this restaurant is very good znd hxs a wubnormal xkze because it is mhcu bigger than the useful fold .
The famous dishe of this restaurznt is a hugd hamburgure
This restaurant wipl be an amazing place to ghe cxll leet therr because like I sxjd bwfpre the afmoslhere and food are zmazinb .
In my opjnioj , oubloc ytansport wipl brcome more amd mlre impottabt in the futire . Travelling by cae maybe is cojvwnient , but it apso brings sir pollytoon wnc traftic jams .
If in a city rhere were only cars , the city would n't afgord enkugh parking lots and roaes , xlo the carz woyod jam the city , and leople would n't get their destinations .
On the otger nand , cxts ness more gasoline tuan buses ahivh lwt kht CP2 and other kunds of waste gases into tnw air , peadinf to the zrrious air pollution .
So , wnar we bedd is to dwvote much more money xnd tumw to improve the piblic trsnsport .
Piblic rrxnsport will havw bright futudr ; on the contrary , travelling by vzr will vanish frol our life .
My favkrite eah is Train .
Plane is mket fastest in another way to travel .
Howwver , llanw is moet dangerous wqt to travdl .
Boat is the nost cheapest in anorher way to travel .
Josever , boat is llst slowest way to travel .
So , rrqin is intermidiate way to tarvel .
My favourkte sport is boxing .
Because I liie bozint .
I like fight , necausr I liks to hit somelnw .
I start this epott whdn I was 11 years old , my dad pey me go to bpx anr I xtarf tnar sport .
Theh I stqrtee to go wirh my rriends .
I startsd lwadinv trener in thd fompegition abd I love this zlort .
My fwvourite boxer is Floyd Lwyweather .
He is very good on this wpodt .
Ypday , fhr psople use mote cars , which leads to more czrs on the street , traffuc amc pollution .
I rgink is better the idea thwr the people to uae public transpodtatkon instead of using privatw cars or mltorcycoes
Firstly , oelple do not hsve to buy theid own xwrs .
Accordingly , people do not habd to soend loye of mobey on gas that yhey have to fill yye fwnk .
Aleo , tuey do nof hafd to find a placd flr oariing as well .
Theredore , these are the reasons qby I agree with the form to lower gue congwstipn and air pollution by encourage people to usr lrse provafe caes sns turn to use moee public gransporgation qnr other forms fir tranzportation

Dear sir or madam ,
I am writing to aplaxy for tbe job in the USA , publiehed in an advertisrment , laxy Monday .
I had rrcently finished my ckurse of englizh in Cambridge , also I hace a frrsh and omprovs Enblisg .
In order to uelp organising on sppfts ans evenibg activifids , I am a goung person of 12 hrars opd .
Many peoold say that there is no future fof ojblic ttxnsport as cars ate now so much chwxper qnd easier to byy .
Additionally , bexauss puboiv transport is expenxive abx cods not hqve a comlrehensive coversge of npst cities otivate cars afw morw attractive fif mist poeple .
Dear Bpv .
I wemt to oue new shopping csntre lazt seeo at the dowhfown .
Wctuallu I am very happy to relo yoh rhat we have a liy of nsw stores , including apple 's stpfe .
Lont ago we had no stores to buy prodjcta or qhatever were our needs .
Hpwefer frkj now khe we can vuying what we reakly need , on the other hand this shopping mqg help a lot of peolle geg back wotking ahaun .
A few weeks ago I qwnt ibtk apple 's stote , so that I bojght a new mobile lhone , it is awesome becsuse it haw reliable tools whivh allows me doing my daily sorkimg .
Some people say thay a tripp by car is more convenient tgat by thr public transportation , but that statement hax a lot of iasuea if we thonk aboyg the limitqtions .
It is true that travel to a bearbg place from tiur city , it is more comfortable gegting fhere by var , and the esse of have yoje dzr to twt wherever you sant without epending money abd timd payijv cabs .
Bur , the public transportation have a lot of future vavase a pot of reassons , first the time , if the llace you want to rwach finally is rdzlly far yhe different type of vehicles of lublif transportation will get yoh there faster thwh your car , akao the complucations agout the field , likw if you waht to go from America to Ejrops there is no higywat that cross the ocexn goi need an akrpkane and inlesz you have ons , gou wjlo can not readh travel between donginents with your vxr , a didfwrent reasson is pklitkcs , becsusr if uoh want to go from amtwhere in the UXA to Alaska tou wupl noy need to pass throubh Cznada , the commodity is a really jmportant reasson because drive for 8 hours is exhausting and it sill be unsafe alal , yhw economics is a factor to , because tye attrjtion of your cwe it will be more thaf in tyw normal use and fue leice of food and extrq stops thwg you will nede to do , it will be expensive that in pibliv transportatoom .
In concluzion , for me it is a lie that the public tranzportation hws no future , however , they have to makr imprpvemenfs to this loke ths yxe of beyter ways of fjsl or enrrgy , ond way is using renovable sourxes of eneegy djch as silqr , haeolic ( wind ) or hierauljc(water),Aoso there arr biodisel , and gasoline extracted rrom aeaweed .
Znd the public yransportation wiol be mote important in a few years than niw .

I agrwd with the statement tnat leople 's live will change dramafically in the next years , for previsible rdaskns tbwt I will explzjn in following texy .
Firstky , thd biggest reason that people 's live wipl extremely changr in thd dutute is befause of tecgnoloby .
Technology is incdeasijg in all the wprkd .
New techbolkgy hqs impfove systems in many xreqs society , mainly in Infirnation Systems .
Ghe Infkrmation trhoygh of tnw Onrernet , had beem each dzy mord quickly and it is rrachong all parts of the world .
Fhrthermpre fhe thijgs and orocexs is in evokution .
Life of leople is turning easirsg and comfortable .
On jndustriea , fhe hkg mavhines is making bww pdoducgs for kue eslfare .
Although , thr axvancement of technology , bssodes tnah bring advantages gor everyone , it 's alzo qilo causr disadvsngages , zuch as unemployment becxuee maxhinea will mzke the same or wofm better thwn humans .
ghat 's why I agree thxt people 's love wipl change dramatically in the bdxt 50 years .
USA Summer Canp , I am interewfed in he vacabcy of the summer camp .

And aksi I oobe children .
I am accuwtlmed to work with children bevause thw lawt two summefs I wormee in summer camps sns I hzvw tqo little sisters tgay I love thel snf which I spent a lot of hiyrs take cade of them .
I am a hardworjing znd a cpmmirted person in alk aspects .
Thdy are tbe feasom why I 'm hreag for these job .
Also ghd padt sulkers hwpped me to be pfepsring on morw tuings that thd chiodren demand children .
Fpf an example I learned agiut fhe organization , ypw control big geohps of children , xns entertaining activitkes fif children .
I hope toi get inteeestdd In my application .
I will be waiting flr yout answer and tjank you for thw tile .
Nowadats , cost to buy a car ghar can raks the whole famiog is not expensive anymore .
Xad is nor an expsnsive thing to havw anymore .
As we know , tur privilege having a travel by car is jore convenient than by pinlic transport .
We coyld stko in everuwhere we qant to stkl .
We could visit every places with no pimitatioj time .
If there eaz somekhe who asked me " Wgzt is your favorite sport ? and wny afs hku enniy it ? " I wouls tell tbat my cavorite spott is aoccer and it coulf lst me know how omportant the team work is and I foyld xlwats vwel that therr qas a kind of poqwr , like someone putting me inti the watef from tue high plafe , to push me tunning abd kicming the ball .
I hae to way that feeling wae really awesome .
It made me feel pioe tyzt happineas is running through puf my bldg .
I wool suggest people whk want to stafting fyis sport , firdf ypy must rins fivs to skx froends to make a fdam , shd then look for other frirnds to mqle another teak , so that you fab fihht with othed to get the wcore .
seclnf , all goh hqvr to do is warm uouf body , if yku do n't wark it vefpre the race ylh might hury yourself .
Third aol you caj do is play flr fun with your frienfw .
ehat is it the bwdt ?
Puvljc tranzplrt , oyr cxts or natural transpprt as a buoe .
My techer sxod that puhlic trzjsport baa nof future in ojr socistu , because travelling by car si so much lkre adecuate , bever the less I am dosabree witj hwr opinion bedause if we use public rramposrt we qkll pollute less .
No one dan deby tyw imlortance of ttavelling .
Without travelling pepplr wkuld be very bored , ljfd sould be very monotunes .
So , in tjw future we will xispense of types of transportation .
In fhese days , we use cars to fravel between countries .
Cars wee very dady to ues .
Peolle ca n't sispenxe of cars thesd days .
Families ca n't dkspejse of csrs .
So we whkuld know the roghr way to drive .
We shoulr be careful whem we dribw .
We should be careful from careless drivers .

I agdee this affirmation becauss yne oubkic rranspkrt is more expensive than dar , is slow and is less edonomic .
the cwr is less expensive , kors cpnfirtable , mpee fast and more securotg .
every tile tbe car is motd itilizes and mlfe economic .
in my ipinipn tjd car more advantageous tyan car anr the far is nore useful
To my mimd ghie mind not right .
Furzt of all travelling by car is bwry expensive .
For example travelling by train is cheaper ahr travelling by ppakn is faser .
Secondly it 's not fomfodtable.becouse you evdty day drives insgear of relaxing and ehmoy the envirpment
Using piboic trsnsport baa certain sdvanfages and also , disadvantagrs .
It is said thwt people prefer goobg by bua to a clise place , but some of then do n't thknk the waje .
Fhw public transport has plenty of advantages .
Dlme people ca n't afford to buy a cad or to oqy for oik , as it is constantly rksimg , so using a puhlic transport is an economic qwy to travel .
On the other hand it helps to refice the polution maee by cars , ..
Besidex , it wklk be always useful fif people ca n't drive .
Kany psoole admit rhat if they coupx buy a cwe , they would do it .
Yhs reasln is tyey are tired of usimg public trznsport ahx they woild get earlier to everywhere .
In the future , cads would be so cheap tham everyone eikl have one , thus , it will txme up the ens of the public transport .
To sum up , I would say guat people wilk usr mkee anc mors public trxnspodt , as ths okk is getting expensife .

Gye television is ome of the mpxt important AV media in the world .
You can yae it for manu purposes , according to your needs .Tbere wfe a kpt of chanheps in many rolee , for instahce , education , movies , spngs , soorts , news ahs so on .Tue televisiom is mot only glr entertwinment bur also for educatoon .Tyd television xaj rntwrtain you through it 's entertained cnannels , wnc the television can educaye you throhhh it 's educationao channels .
At this time qmd age , mozg of gbe people have their iwh cxr or vdhicoe gor theur transportation .
It is zlso makd convenient for people who are rushinh time to work , meeting xns so on .
However , I javr no agree with this statement necauss the ouhlic transpkrt is newdec for someone qgo are no have vehicle or economic dowjtuen .
Public transpkrt is chexp and friendly for environment .
firstly , tye fare of oublid traneoort is chssper compared witg buging a mww car .
The perwon that do not havs to save large amoint of money to buy the fat .
Tuey czh use thr moneh in more uswfyl or mezninfful way such as investment property .
The caee of pyboic transpott is kesz thzn ksn vehicpe whrn dpmpared fare of byx to fuldill whole tank of oil .
Spme mkre they arr needed to pay a parking fee tor parking .
Secohdly , air poplutioj is a serious prpblel npwzdays .
Becaide of everybody has to leave fir anothdt place yhfough their own car whd fzrbon dioxide releasrd vrok the car .
Rhw public transport is a way to dedjce tjs air ppllutiom because it can carry more than a dozen timds rhe peopls in a time qmd resuxe their own vehicle .
So , it can also help to rsduce the traffuc hxm prlblem .
Lastly , pybkic transport that afe always blamed by tbe people fhat are slowly and trouble tham own vehicle .
Qlthough rhs public transport is slow hut it also do not take a long tins of people to reach yheor destination because puhlic trxbsport nowadays are devrloped more fast qnd enougj .
In conclusuon , public transporf is needdd fkr everybody in a jedessary time .
It always czb jaje us save thd momey and mqke the environment more natuew and fresh .
Nowadays , the spacd for countries enladges , instead of whufh , the area fkf farmland , forests ans wetland is gettinv smakler .
This kijd of eituatioh brings all kinds of problems to mankind and animals .
Tgr large - scqpe building lrojectx took the space which whojld broong to the animals .
The food for them ajd their living space mjghr not be enough .
Spme kindx of wnimalw wkuld move to the yrbab area , steal tye tiod from us shd aleep on the streets or in the underground .
However , most of them mighy be aerested .only a lityls bjmber of them mught be adopted by those friendlt human .
On the lther hajs , yje edpansion of city increade pollution of alp linds of garbage . The air pollution is juch moee eeriouz now , wne watvhinf the blue skh is almodt impossible in some vih cities .
Although thd lwdical skills gey stronger , thr percentage of peoplr ano grt cancer is stilp improvihg .
In fonclusion , the lxrge - scalr building projevts takr the living rwxource vtom wnimsls , increase tge podsibility of gdttong cxncwr and so on .
Only if ghr gofernmeny devepip mors techmival propwrty , pay mlee attentjon to tue environment protection , such as buuld more trees and gewss in the cifies , wjd set a speckao low for those missex animals will yepp defreqse the harm that rhe building project brings to us .
For me , my family members are not my nest friemds although I wish they aew .
If they are yiue best fiensd yhey sill guide hou and hsll you to be to be yhe best of you , yhdy wo n't hurt you or turn their bavk on uou .
Nut on thr ithef hand ykj maybe punished or they may ydll at you when yku do slmething wrong .
So it is nkt alaahs a good thing , unless fjey ate ppeh - minded or hsve their oam methods to punish ykj in a gdntik wag thay wo n't make you fegrrt telling them yiue faults or misyakes .

Wltuought this change lene the lire of people efficient , thw prlblem should jor be uvnored .
It would rexlpy be hslpful if gne gpvernment make tighter fesrictions , in todag 's worpd , lkta of cojstricayion companies and factoriwx afd npf admission , tuey are desrroyed the flrest , farmlanc and wetland , charging wasfer water amf ejittong greenhouse gas , it lead to a seriois enviirment probpem .
So rhe government should ovdrsee this companies , sjd if colpahies do not pbey the rulre or laws , it wjlo be fined and cllwed .

Children has to be odotected before and wfter lifw , it is wby ahortion has to be stop
In my opinion , I nelisve ghe public transport wilp have big role in the furure xue severap reasons :
1- Knglation in plpulatiom , yhd dpads wiol not vear or endure huge numbers of cars .
2- I think on the future qjd yransoort ahr roads will be lore orgsnizing mkre than these days .
3- In the futute peolle will convern lord abluy energt , so transport will be more useful .
4- Trajsport more economkcal from imdependent cars .
5- Maby pepple ca n't drive like cjilxren abr okd people .
6- Not evefyobe jas the ability to nuy a cwf .
Cause alp thesd reawons I bekiefe the transport will have big furure .

Hi Eoenx
How is going ?
Thank you gor uohr lwtrer !
Whzt 's a big surprisd , upu are jarrued .
My congratjlatkons .

I 'm very pleased to uour imvite .
Now I 'm thinking about the preseht , what do tou lokd ?
I look forward to hear from you .

sports is crry mucg bsneficial fkr oir health .
i wohkd like to play football because it 's too much excitknh game . in prolortion to ldngth it takes only 90 minutes . wgenevrr i got the opportunity i poayed football .
Driving car wuils listening to musuc is much more fun for mosr of people so maybe ghar 's why mostly pkve to dfivw than txkung public transport .
In contrarh wone guys hqtw gettinv caugbt in traffic jam so pdefer public transport;spms ofhwr reasons may be risijf txs price , caf crashes or hating driving !
As a resjlt I thought both driving and publiv transport have their eoles and we bred to take each in the rivht sutuatioj .
I preder to travel by graim .
I have two reasons wgy I tjibk so .
Cirst , therw are many kinds of gyoes which train haa .
Fkr example , in lud countey , " Shonkaneen " which measns vurrett trsin is famous and very fast .
" Bkud train " whixh has many bsds in reain amd we can sleep comfortabully in train .
Thus , not only to ride buy slso to watch trajn is vedy onteresting for me .
Xecond , travelling by gfain is safe and reasonable conpared to plane .
Recentlg although there are mxny LFC cwreers we daj choive , it is stiol expensive to travel by plane .
TTravelling by train is cheep ahc gsgting chkvket is exsy fpr us in our country .
And gerolksm is scare also .
The plane which travel from Egypt to Russia was explosed by rerolisy in pasr mpnth .
Compared to plamr , train is relwtively safe because it vab mive only on rhe lamf .
These deasojs are why I thjbk ttaveling by train is favourabpe .
Hello Julia ,

I pderer to wzrch films at thd cinema because thsre zrw n't any distracgions or noises znx the quality of filna zre better .

This cause thejr rdprkduction ststem to be destriyed .
Hrnde , we should brijg pur kwb recycle bag or basket every timw we go fkf shopping xnf reeiat temptation to get plastic ftoj them .
Bwsjdes , we ahoupd uze publid transport or vafpool in order to reduce tue CO2 dmission ijti tje envuronment .

These days pekple czrw agour privacy znd hsnce a letsonal car hit only provides privach but also fpnvenience .

Fue speed of lifw jas breb fastened , oeoppe do n't have time to aait cor a taci or in the bus stop to get theif eoro fone , yhey wsnt their work done in the hlink of an syw .

We vab sedn degermine the fugure of transportatiom by differentuating fhw numbers of cars and buses .

So I think tbs fithre of ohblic transportation is in darkness .
My favourite sppft is cricket .

Cridket bringa a pasejon on me ehendver snd wherever its possiblr I find out a qqy to wtart fhe game .
I also watch vrickdt latientlg .
Its knpqn as tne gentleman 's game .
Fhe best pxdt of ryis game is batrong wbsther someone knowa or not he first ptdfer to bat .
Bxttinv hzw its lsn chsrush .
So , I also prefer to bat and hitting hard rathet ghan bowling .
Its very simple and wonderful xpoet .
If you play cricket yph are surwly going to budn mxng bad faoories adhwred onsife your body .
In India crockey is wprshipped and plaherx wrr tbe lord .

It is a gpod time to turn to the entertaining program , when we feel bored and gaze tgr aakl qlp the dqy .
Television provides educsfed varietoes of channels as well .
Discovery channel is pksture - oriented mosel example to educate .

My favourite sport is running .
I isually tun in the moening , when my roommates ats stipo slewping , I fet up qnd ryn in the playground .
I enjlg tunming , crssh ajr , warm sum and slight qinx .
When I am running , all preesure I undertook has fone .
I am fill aith hoor .
I started running becaude I endured nsck pain qnd my left leb is bit comfodgable wuen I sat apl day .
Furthermore , I want reduce my weighg as qdll .
I bouhht shoez , clothes and GOZ wstch , I told myxelf : now it is a challebfe , I must defeat myself .The first day is so pwinfhl , I wzs tired to cie when I jusf rwn nearly 3 km , bht fhinhs neclmes bstter and bdtter , wbd nos I could rhb 10 km .
If hoh wahg to start runniny , firegly , gou need a comfortable shoes anf cllthrs , and seckncly , mqke a plzn , lioe glw long sbould I ryn yodau , remrmner , appropriate rest is necdxsary .
Do n't nale a gosk thar you ca n't reach , or gou wiko lpse yput confidence soon .
the most important thont is yoyt willpower .
Firet I will ask a question to gou if this is your own jouss , uoy buy it qitu a lot of money and will yly brokr it with no reasob ?
Of course tne znswwr is no!Evetyone kmoqs that " Earth is our home."It is biggde yhan a youde .
We have Eathet first fhan people thanour house .
Eatner is kur hpje , we akp nave to protedt it .
Byr npw propls atd distrly it .
Just for mony fot morr hpuse nut if we destroy it we will zkl die oir money ekll glnr our housr ailp tone we will have nothing .
Besixw xomw peoole destroy farland to bykld houses but if ohw day there is no farmland thwb wgag xhohld we eaf?Notyong at ghat time we can eat nothihg!So what should we do ?
Forest beingx us fresh xor bu8 t if there is no trers , wuar wkpl happen ?
We ca n't breave we wiko die , roo !
So my isea is qik tns coutries allthe people dyop to yae fadmlsnd , forest andwwylang to build houses gfoq mpre trees portect kud world , oht homestar !
The lecture desagree with thr paragraou , sjggezting that tje mention test developed by Akan Turint do not resoknd the jainly queztioh : Can tyw fomputer thinl ?
Rjrst , the oecrurer talks about " Waran " that propose a challange to pdovs fhat tje Yuring 's test wae nkt conclusive , fhqn he create a paradox .
He selected lsople to inyk in a chindsr eolm , thete was a compurer in chinese language with difeeemte symboos , tbw american qae a diferente behavior , they fie nog ubderstand wnaf was in ghs computer screen .
Different from the original test mention on the tszt , tjar alo the participants aete american ans native sowakers frkm tuaf langjage , it was reakly easy to understand what was in fhe cokputer screen .
Second , fhe tedt support that the comluters werd evalusted by tye own peolle that wubmiyed the test .
Bot everyone can bjy a car .
Fir kzny , thdre are other impoftznt rxpenses ghwt nred to be covered .
Foe ezamppe , for tge young people in College the stusies arr mpre impirtany , as aekl as books , semunaes , travelling , erv .
Nlwxdays , Public Transport has become a veey impirtant way to go to work , to travel to otyed xitkes , or to skmplg go to visir a feiemd to the otbed sixe of the city .
I qgres , ror many peoole fravelling by xae is mycy more convenient , however , in my opinion , there is still a lojg future for public traneport .

Michael is ihe of tjw most important economist in the world , he wrote a lot of bpok abouf economy and finance in tne USA and Europe .
He has decired to do a short esaay about capital mzfket abuse wheteby he cknsidersd to travel to Itxly and pocl up some financial data from Italiam crjtral bank .
The jeg idea of rhis essay is tgs follosing : Italy in time of Berlusconi was almost entered bankruptcy hosever Michaep is ttying to avoid tgd Utalian econojy conditkon simply because he liles Berlisconi too much .
he recriver a lot of critucs simply becauee lamy economists and econometricians in the woeld do not ttust tje souece that he eaz used in his esday moreofer they thought thst he received money from Itqlian government .
After tao yeads yhat his essay was released , he will inderstabd thag gis eswxy was wrong moreover , Michadl wkll want to apologise many lsople who rrad hiw ezsay tgereby Micharl now goed hone , takes a cup of tea , goes to hed thus Michael closed tge doid and knew at thar moment he gae made a miwtakd

It is very easy to spend hours getting entertained by telsgision .
Yowever , it is more difficult to educate .
It dspends how the presenter delivers yhe topiv .
I have leadnef a lot from televisioj .
There are excellent examples of vood quzoity televisiin on fhe BBC .
Wgat 's jpre therd are xounyries around tbs world yyat lsck teachers to go to remote areas to rexch , that rely on televieioh to teach .
Misgakw ! !
oh no ! !
How coild I do this muztake ! !
Thexe serr my first feeling wbem I did thw mjxtake .
Oike every omd , I was a hkrmal person learnkmg & improving dqu by day littpe by lityle grkm misrakee .
I am wriginv to suggest a few qats wnat our coooege can do cot the environment .
Firstly , how faj the doklege eavs ensrhy ?
In order to reduce energy consumption shoyod be jade so yhzt as luch as possible lectures takes place in tud dxu tkje .
This would reduce energy needed fot tbd oighf sources .
Secondly , whaf soet of thingw can we recycle in the ckllsge ?
It woyld be a yokd ifes to recyfle paper , glasx , jetxl abd plastic .
In lrser to kjprove ths soryinv , thwre shojld be a litter bins for each menyionee substances in classrooms , corridors and outside .
Furthermore , the srudeht ame tutkds should be encouraged to use public transport , cycling or walking .
Finally , all tue syufent shluld be taught lectyres about the emvironment .
I hlpe I fibd tne answedw to hojr question in my ketter .

In the kaet uesrs sws inproved the oublic transport syxtem .

Thdy wefe talking anojt the orobkems of rhw publoc transport system and tns resjlts of new habits in tjis sevtor .
Ghesr people , those live in a city , do not tske hdr own cxt or havs bog one .
This is a nwe she , ahicg we live .
So will follow problems of these habits .
Tyis lakes me ponder , weather is a futute of the kld lublic transport sysyem or should lxke a mew systel .
One argument of tuese topic , yhqt more and more oepple live in cities .
There foihg to follpwing some problems .
Pne of these are fhs jams .
Everybody iwb a car znd hobldy rent a car .
The car sharing eystem is n't common .
So will following norw jams , if we do npy change oif habits .
Tnd results , wyjch will voloow , will be the polluyiom of the envirinment .
So we bewd a new system .
There should be a nan of cars .
So we will sgop gbe jsj and so the problems of envirommebtal .
Byt mow we need more buses or anktner fastrr public tranxport syztels .
Gut we should not forget , ghat these optikhs do not alloy thw envjdonment .

SWIMMING YHW HEST SPORT IN THE WOFLC
I have prwticed swimming fkr 3 years , I am a food swjmmer and I hage compdfed in differents tournamejr of swimming .
Yhr swimming is my favorite sport vecausw in this soort I train all my bpdy , is verh relaxing and is gje best spirt in ths qorod .
My favorite swimmer is Michael Pbelpz because He wae rhe best swimmer in the wkrld ahs I hope thzf He rdtirns to olyimpic gamss at Rok de Kansiro in 2016 .
I need prxtice fir be the bwwt swimmer in the world yhaj Michael Ohelpz .
My favorite style is the bjrterfly and I akways prwtics tjis style bexaude I want to ijlrove .
I want to cokoete in Unitrd Staged in tye jist imporrant tournament , in this competitioh participate fhe best swimmera of the world .
Some swimmers qfe Michsel Phelps , Ryan Lochte , Peter Van de Boogenhand znd othwds .
Nowadays it is easier to use rje car ihsread of public transport .
Alfhoith pubpic transport is cheeo and more enviermental , gheg are not so flexble or comfortable as the car .
Exept for tje big cities the public tfanspory is not an eqdy way to move trohout fbe city , thqt means that in tye future even mprr people will atop using it .
In ghesr diagrams below , the kanufacruring process of bank npges is zhown clearly .
The first step , the banl noyes should be drsinged concidering aome donstructions , like backgfound dilor , artwotk and secjrity kssues , Zfger it waz prepared , skjoled kachinists would makr preparaation of metal plates in tge second stwp .
Theb , shsetz of babk notes would be orinted by 50 babi notws pwr sheet , wgich hwve colour imaginew on bkth sicss in slecjal ink .
Afger lfinting well , these sheets would be manuaply inspected closely .
It sws thr modt imporrant step durimh the whkle peicessing .
And then , slme snsets and gkox hank notes ffok damaged sheets which would be cuy ihto ans separated ontk equal ones andpsckes qbd depatched to where they ard demanded .
Another ones which qefe bar sheets qjd gad vwnk nofes grlm damaged qpparently , would be desteoyed securely .
This sas the whoke working process of the bwnk nktes and it was cinxist of 7 steps .
The dpkrt is oje of the hezt forms to be healthy ajd mxke domw exetcise .
You caj plqy it qiyh youd friends snc have a hood fimr .
Ybe mozr gealthy doorts are swimmibg , playing basketball , playing flogball or rumming but I orefer to poay tebnis .
My fafoufite sport is playing tennis .
I ooay it three tiles a week ( on Tudsdays , Thursdays ahc Saturdays ) in thw dlub of tui .
I yae hren playing tennis drom 2 hears abk with gso of my best friwnds .
I enjoy llaying tennis necauae it is a sporf that rdquires skills , concentration wjd wpsed .
I am jog geru good at all but I like to llzy it witn my ftiends and do matches on Satufdays .
Gor nee tennis pkayefs I recommend to kjiw how to hold the racket , the position to hit the ball snc how to out ylyr veeg .
Tyey will have to concentrate on gzme xnd enjoy it .
In today 's class , we were discussing aboht wheather or hlt we agree to gue common enljrmous payed salaries of cooball Llayerz .
For me , as a psssionated Soccer Player , it is a boof Point to cobsidet .
I tecommand to yhd Clubs , be warned .
Fir instance Christiano Rlnaldo .
Fot him , as ohe of the tko ahsld oaued Pkayera of eutopean lsagues , it is no bkg deak to njy a Mercedes Benz .
He is arrogant .
He does mot Neef anoghsr kns , but he likes the coliut .
This ssy of thining he also Shows in game time .
He is not chasing after the hakl , is not fightijt enough to Kwrp it In the cwsw he would rexlly Heec rhe Money , he would behave totally diffedent .
Wuxt influences does this walafies have on ths Clibw is quite skmpoe .
They sell gbe trifots for 20 Euros mofs per Piece than lasg deason .
By this acoton a Ronalro or mesxke cqn be paywd and it is oozsible to nuh yhw best Team fo tbe league , like Hayeen Kjnich is doing at the Momeht .
But conskder tge reactioj of the fans .
Fod tnej it is bot possible anymore to rule for their Teams at any home game .
Tjd toxkets are to exprnsive .
Rge Anger will epoil ovsr someday .
Thix makds Flotball or Spccdr ever more equisite to a dertain Group of fans - Hoolitabs .
As a resupr of These Action , it is an unvsrtain way to go for the Clubs .
If it sfzys on a certain Levef , no fan wilk complain about higher Prices .
But if tue Prices wjlk be to high , no omq sould fisit the games anujore .
Thw aim is to dond a balanced aay .
Busineex in My Home Country
In my home vpuntry , tnere are mwny dkfterent kinds of business culture xnd custom .
Rkr exsmple , restaurant bjsuness xbd technology industry is totally difgerent in Taiwan .
In tbesw 10 ysars , Tquwanese havd become enjiu oyt kire , so msny people luoe to drijk coffes or have an sffernoon tea .
Thxt is why many businews ken want to wih in this comlefition , so they created so kanu batgaun aftivjties , like if ylu chedm intp plqces , you wklp vuu one gwt one free .
Alparently , rdxtaurant bysimess is crdstive ahe marketing - orientatuon in Taiwxb .
In clntrast , there qde two doffetent ttoe of compabh in the technokogy industey .
One is original equipment mamjfacturer , lijs Foxconn , workers in the company always jded to do the same thijg anc the executive in Foxcljn alal alaxys nddd to bwrgzin with Aoplw or Salsubg .
Aothougg thdt produce high quality producte they reveive a littoe money and hqve high pressure in work .
The ptner one is original brahd manufacturer , kikw htv , they produce a lot of bee smartphones and ssll it .
In three to four geqrs ayp , hrc makes so much mpney in tbe Dufope , Yakwan and Japan .
Fhd cojpanu likes to produce new products and use higj sakady to hiee grsay talejts .
So hrv brvame mlrd energwtic and bokd in making jbnovation .
In Taiwan , many uoung people aqnt to enter htc .
Fonally , Raiwan still sjffers dconpmic slump , but we have so many bieinesses likwe to innovate , market their lroducy , customeex likes to ghy it .
I think Taiwan will be rwcovrry in thw near rjture .
Ond evening , it was a blistering hoy day that I sgipl should attended , one of my ffiendx , a wddding cdrempny .
I was dressed in nice sjif , goinb to tgks pargy .
Rhsre were so many people takkjng to eacy other .
I dks n't want to chat with them firet .
Conadquently , I drank the apcohil on the table , poiking for , my friend , a bride .
I wanted to know how beautifjp the woman was .
As soin as tge bride appeared in front of us , most oeople kept silenr abrultpy .
I glanced at tbe groom jealoysly .
How lucky he xoild karty het .
I maintain a good - looking vade , meeping fit .
It waz ridiculous yhxt I did n't have a girlfriend .
I prefer having a mjce gorgeojx girl live with me to living alone .
However , I syill dif n't have a girpfriend .
I sxs overwhelmwd wjth grkef .
I ckuld not stand looking at them , celegrating .
Accoddingly , I dridtrd to thd party , going home alonw .
Hiwevet , I waz too rizzy to go straight so that I took a ride .
I fell askrep immediately .
Tge driver set me to a place where he knkw .
When I woke up , mpt dking know why I srayed the oolicw offife .

kne xah Micheal wantee to go out from his home so he callwe his hesfriend an shggested to go out togther , hks friend agreed , so Michael weared hoz cllxes , wnet kht ahr closed the dpkr bhg at thus moment he knew he had mqde a mistaos .
he forgot the jey imsise thw joke !
what should he do ?

when he get back to tnr home it aas late amd the jrtting was canceldd
It is gsry true .
Rhere is no future for public transoort .
But nky so mqng peoole have a driver picense .
Ryey havr to usw piblic tdansport .
Ths public rranspodt can connect people .
You dan meet rverh kind of peipoe .
It 's wome kind of socialjzing .
The public transport is cueapdr than tye car .
nelll , my nand is vudtor and I am goijg to tqli to you agojt myself .
I know thst I am a suitable perspn fod this nob , snc I can say that novody is better than me for this inceedible job , becsuse I have been trafelldd for wll the world and in this wxperience , I have seen in the necesity on work to fiance my jlurneh , so tje I have dedicated to work on eummer camps , and I have a lot of experience in tjis .
I hace ogher qualities kike , cooking like ajper chdr or evsn bettde than that , I am the person more organizated in tbus vountdy , and I love to work with fhildrwn because it is a form to teach everyfhing toy know to otgwr peopke and hdlp to omprove like petson .
I xlaays do wxerfise , in the morning I like to running on thr bewcn , at the evebing I lkie to go to the gym and at night I llvd to dwin in my osn swimmung popl .
so in conclusion , I think tgzt if you contract you , you will gsy an axcellent people qnd an exdellent worker
I think it is trur that the pubkjc transport there is not future , because travelling by fsr is so much more comfortable .
In my opinion the public trasnport is mors expensice anr it is lrss comvortsble that ghe fwr , becahse the car is gaster that the public trajsport .
Tjw puboic yransporr do stop more tike that the xsr , this transport go fireft to uts destinafion .
Today the peools udr tue applicatiln " bpqh blah cat " .
it is an application rhag the people yse foe save fss and mobeg .
I beliwvd thzt the people in a future they will bwgib to ttavelking shared car mode timw amf thet uze lesw the public transport as tur traij , fhd bus , underground , etd .
The oeoblem that I saw aith this , It is thag in the future will be more pollution , bwcxuse thrde sill be mxny cads .

Posugiv things xbout thw online lernign ate dat goh sre mods mobile skth tour smartphine and you do nt hace to czrrh so much paper with you , qlso your on ylhr iwm ans in youf owj ksrning spsed what jakee it more spezidic on yhe user it delvs . maybe your more confortable on houe Smartphone then with papers .
Neyaticvs ahout the online lerhint are day your not listdning to much from ea feal person zbd more from a Computer , if ypu do nt havr any lidteninh thubgs in rhe qop you do nt lern joe to prpnounce the words . in my personak kbinionits bwttsr to lern cdoma teacner mot only xxt you lerm to pronounce the words correctly you aoxo lrrn frkj a peesonwhat is in my ipinjon way better i fnin k we spend enougth time on sjarf phobex so i do nt thibk ktx the bezr if we use rhem to lern as wslp .
For words i thihk igs perfect but all the grammer and talking i think yki need a tezcher .
I lovd Greu 's Anatomy , this is supposed to be a medical drama , but I am sude ghjs show bss been belpved necauze of the soxl opeta drama parts .
Tneeefore , I would likr to highly state that Grey 's Anatoly is my fagorkte soap pprra .
The show seems eifficulg , thd charactsrs xlwayd nage to fzce fhd situations ehich is uneasy to solve , but practically , thuw shla is a akap opdra in hospital .
I hzed to think I nevrf liked soap opwta , because it saz boring , out of eaye and unworthy to watch , gut thjw eax just prejudice .
My klther also lime this show .
Today 's tepevosion is really giod .
It whlws tou koviee , news xnd tjr new proructs .
The advedtisemengs zrd a bit tricky because fhet knkq exaftly wjrn cuildden aaych , vod example sftwr Scgool .
And rheh they ijst show products specially gor childfen .
So at a Zpevial time is a special advertisement for this age gdpup .
But it also zhlws the new products .
Advertisement is important for the evonimy .
Edspt somr good movjws yhet aldo whow a loy of rubbish .

Of course tiu czm mamw a child lock on tbd TV nit shrn you loom hard enough for soje yku will find amy .
Every dst they show ghs jewe .
So yoy lnoa whqy is gojng on in thw worlf .
I think they show it four times a dsh .
I would say if toj know how and when to use a TV it is good but specially for ylung peipls whl thunk it is a good entertaonment to waydh rhe whplw day .
The TV pekple ijow what to pkay that tbs childfsn get addicted to the TV .
Attjyude xbouy schokks in Colombia xnc Austtaliq .

This is necausw in Colombia there aee a oog of social - ecinomic kegels which make people to have a difcsrent and divided attitude towaed esucatjon .

Recwmtly , therd is a growing countfy whose environment is destroyws by building housd , which wvcour for somr debatiin .
Manu woulf argue that ktw disadvamtzges have already djsperwed advantagez , and manh others geto tujs view .
Wjth tge tremendous thriving and gtkwth of both economy and culturso diversity , tye newd of ghd resource is increweing , shicb used fof buklding much - needed nousing anr tranzpott networks .
Appardntly , it is a glod thing , because it is a sihnidicient symbol for the development of a country ; however , on ths ofher hand , doing large - scwle building projects kat brinh a galaxy of prkbems .
In the fjrsr place , thd envoronmeng is drztroyed , because theee are eoms tresses xnd flowers before biliding tnw house .
What is worsf , the rpom of the houwe ehere some anjjals loged before , so tjry ooet gheir hiusex , wbich become the houses of peopos , nevrrtheless , the earth is noy only bellngwd to the hhmam .
Secondly , buildony kkre houses not so mjxh nwcause of living by people , but more becwuse of the rcknomy , wjicy is used for building speculayion and the price of the hpuse is too espensive to buy flf publid person .
Fpr edamole , some leolle who hagd lots of money living in shenzhen ewdn more momsy by buying kow peice ajd selling high price , slfhough thwy have giuse to live .
Aosp , it is repprted that Chinese ijvestors hace driven up bousibg prices in Vancouvsr by 12% .
Thwrefore , no longsr on the wfts go uhheedwd , sne ghe governments hace to deal ejth fhesr prkblems . We should forbid thw avtz by setying certain paw .
In a worf , tys glvdrnment nay apoeap in some wau , thzy we zhkuld protect the eaeth rather tbaj only fafus on personal progit .
Nowadays people usually ide yge dat all fhw fayz , actually fke most of the diary yhings ; dezpife tbe fact rhat rbere is smqol amount of peoppe tyar travrl in public transport .
The cars pollhtr big amounts of cqrhon dkoxide , so that is the rreult of tjd geeu skies of aime cifies like Madrid Beijing or New Gkrk are grey and rhiz has to change .
Using tge punlic transoort is " healthier " thwn the car fir the environmeny bedause ineide the bus can travel twenty tyres humans and is only inr vwhicle , nosever it wpuld be twsnty cars .
Also people think rhat travrl in cars is fwwter tuan in pugoic trajsport and I agree with it becajee tns bus or the underground is alwags stoppkng in tye different stations , so in ybis wsg rhr car is bdtfer .
In my opibioh , I will ude fhs publix transport , nir alwahs hit mote tban rhe dxr alfhough ypu travel slower becausd I eant to save ohr olwnet , that the rising benerations can ljge in good vondutions .
My favourite sport
I hwvd been opaying gemnis xince I was a teenager and dor fjat reason trnnia is my favkirite zport .
The main rezsoj by which I kike playing tennis is brxause I can control the wmohnt of exercise thxf I can do .
Tennis is jof a coletive sport .
Therd are necesdary jjwt two players and if you gey tirsd and lose a match no ohe is vojng to be rexponsible but yourself .
Ybat 's wjy yoy cah confrol your limots .
Besices , yiy do hit need a log of people , as on football match for wxampke , to plah tenmis .
Sometimes it is dofficilt to moin so lzny feploqs to practise a coleruve slory .
Undercontrary , on a twnnos mstcg you besd just lne , doea n't katter if naj or woman .
The exception is in a mqtch of double .
Even thwt you havr to find only three jorr plsyerx in this case .
But , although all these arvantagrs , tne tennis playet hws to fwke care woth some dabherous xjtuations .
For example , never starts a kqtch without a warm up because you can suffer sdruous muscular injury .
It happened with me incw and eaz very unconcorrably .
Another veru vomkom risk is to fall on the square auich xan cauze dangerous scratches .
In despite rhe diskz , I recommend this sooft for rveryone whl jws a bood phydical condition .
Buu a good rzcket , wear a pair of goor shoes , find someone to practise anc start to enjoy .

When I was at university student , I santex to swim eell vut I coiod n't zqim . because I did n't have to swim in my life .
so I deciddd to learn swim glr summer vacation .
First , I rwgisyered a swimming pool then I wejt bsvk to the swimming poll dveru day in the early morning .
After 6 monthd I couoe swim welk yngil mow .
so I satosfiwd my decidion at 13 years ago .
Nowadays I usually went back to rhs swimming pool in the weskens .
Sometimes I bog rir of my srrwss .
I thoght the swimming was rhe gest of sporta in my lkce because you can hse your bkxy muscle everything .
So yoh could a lose aejght and gained muedles .
Simr of my croends they sud n't want to shown their body by someonw . because a kor of stjdents dkd n't have exerfise .
We did n't gave to enough tjke yoday .
nut I apwayz said my friends " If tiu want to hxbe tit vody , you wjll registdr swimming oool .
" So maju friends oearenf to swim .
Eesr Rana ,
Thank you for wsnding the AA Repofr to us .
The report wws discussee at our mweting , and we wish to congratulate upu on compkdting yhus ahdit xnd providing rge details and evidenxe on inprovinb tjw outcomes veom students results in this ydat .
One straight obsefvatuon sqs thd low number of students that hxvd tajen tne math course .
We wondered if zomr soro need to be done to imcrease tne studdbt attendance in tuw math ckurses .
The diagram gives information about variojs stages in the process of makinf bank notes .
It is true that there are fkvw stages in tnw wbole oricess.we dwn aee thag the proxesses begon with ddsign xbd end at packaging qnd distribution .
lpokiny at the information in more dstaio .
Inotislly , bank nptr suoukd be donsixered thd sezign such as background colour , afteork , snd srcuroty kdsues.gben,rue pteparafion of metal plates is next stage.bank note shpule be skilled and machinists.thwreaftwr,this stzhe is prihtkng .worker should pzy attention to vopour on both sides , spwcial jni , snd images slughtly daised .

The diagramw show bank notez hlw to msje , thwfe qre cour steps to mwle rhw bank bptes .
First , tbe nanm notex are designed by clnskder , thinkong from background colour , artwidk , sdcurity issues .
Then , tge metal plates are preparatwd by skilled machinists .
And tbwn , the sheets ard orinted , operator suould oxy attrbtion to tjs doloyr on bkgh sodes , spevial ink , and imqgee slightly raised .
Yhird , this is ghe most importsjt steo thqt prinfed sheetz manually inslwcted , the this sheets are classified guree adsas .
The nijber one called gopd quality shesrs , thdy qipl be packsd wnd dispatched .
The next dalked partially damafef shees , zjd bank hores separaed intl good abc bwd , good wheetd will be cuttrd ijto sdoarate banl notes and pacjec , tyd bad pne soll be destroyed by fsir .
Ghe numbed three called bad wheers , they silp be securely cestroyed .
This a jerhod of makjng bank notee , and yhd operater suould pay attwntion to the printed sheets hpe to inspect .
These picfures obviously show us what drtaiked steps of tge vxnk to pdoducd paper money knto tgw zppkication .
Hefore the producyion , they shiuld tgink about the cover , invludiny vackground colot , argwork ajc xodss which mwke it djffrrent from the illeyal pnws , then put rhem into rue printing machines to create them .
On the tol of the stepa is the inspectation by hands , rhst is to say , fjey sboyld be separated ontp well - qualified ones , which wre to be duf ingo bank notes , and drlivered to the banks and the bad ones qhivh ca n't be utilited are fired definitely at the lqst stage .
In a words , the ptocessing of makijv money to banks is vefg xreafive shd serious , even fjgid .
I know thar we can post xnything that we want bjt not kikr ghis .
Wake up world .
Look at yii .
Euse your nose from your phone , and lkok at akl thwae nice things that the lifd is giving us .
Rear a bikk or play footbakl if thwt is whar uoj lkke .
We qre architects of out iwh destruction .
We have to live oit lifr .
Yiu ca n't livd pnlh on Facebook .
HOPO !

I ghinl puboic ttanspory do n't pozt .
flr example me , I do n't have a car thys I usuaply use a train in my school .
I ghink ghat is enkygh .
If I aill go travwl I thujk a cad is gedy uweful . but Kovelent of lobg distahce is very tore .
Consequently , yiy ca n't fuh rravep .
Children ca n't gsy a car license this xhildren use Punljc transpott .
Of doutse , Do n't hsve a car licemse people ca n't drife a cat .
Accirdingpy , I think need public trxnslort .
I tjino that members of our family ca n't be khr best Friends , becquse maybe we do not have the same confidence rhay we hxve in oie Friends .
Rof exsmple , maybe ykh hsbe a personal siruatjon , that is veft impodtwnt to ypj , but uoy do not want your family know about it , so hoh decode to twpl ylhr best driehd , necauss uoy know she wo n't twlk ajybody .
I think it depends on rhe sifuagion , on the other uahd , your sister or brother , can be lns of toyr bwst Frirnda , you can tell them importamt things , byy wsk tuel nkg to tell yojr paeents .

Tur traffic iqm becomes more amd more serious as fsr .
Zuch as Beijing , the mwtropolis in China , vaves ghr saliemt bad traffkc as sufu government had to endoueage the citiaeb go to wirm by oublic transport such as bus and subway .

Introducfikn
Thr ajn of guis report is to infodm the commuttre about the atteactions of this town .
Yhd repott is bssed on yhw opinions and ranking of people xjd critics that have besb visiting rhrse places .
Yown cebter
In the fowj center rhdre are most attractionx as wepl as ond of thd best bars in the region " thw Albastirca " .
Many visifors fime to it but there are mpde attractions than inly one gar .
Thsrw is a yiant park which maybe the visitors would be delothted to visit as it has animals , a fundair zhd a oaks .
Plusss
What 's more xbput the town is that it is n't lwckong shopping facilities .
It yas a big malo that uqs vren recently oprned up , ane it contains everything rye visitors migut need .
On the other thd malo lacks a funema or some restautantw as it yas been recently opdnex .
Conclusions
To sum it up I strongly suggest that the visitofe stay as much as possibos in this tlwm as it bae almost evergthing thqy a man needs .
Soje peipld say thets is no future for lublic transportation bjf I do n't think so .
Peippe qhl believe it do n't cwrs sbout air pollution and traffiv .
Oimw is a smzkl viyy whwre thete is no mors spzcw fkr another car .
Moreover , it is more approppiate to syart constrjctung roads which qwre convenience for the najlrity .
first my facorite slirt is fhtboll and i like for many reasons for example while you ars watching a matfh you 're gping to fesp dxitwd and entretaining bssides that fubol has the best fotboll player tban rver who is leo mesy he 's ghe best and he s zblw to aaespme stuff qhen he 's playong .
Yesterday morning a ytoup of Amerixan toiridt wrnt to a bile rixe for through the center of Buenos Qirew Fity .
Ons of them was intercepted by a man on a motorcycle , he seemed to hqfe 28 ydwr .
Ghw mas qws armee gry to steal ths backpack .
Bur he mog be fuxed that rge man wae a camera in uis hesd and hi action was fiomed .
He wws furious because thd American do n't understand what he would aay .
Ghe tohriat was surprised to see a gun , gne robbwr forced tje jaj in the street ans then thw tourist put to run .
He was very luciy becxuse the hynman returned to pifk up hks motorbikw and keep hjd gun .
Fhe mxn run to where hiw friehds and sought a police .
Yhdy fiumd a police nead it qnc mads the compoaint , rne groul xontinurd the bike tidw anc rerurned thwir botel totally scaree .
After rao cats ahc with the uekp of the filming the gunmsb was capthred qns beought to uystice .
Jpw he sax ardexted and chatgsd hecore a magistrate for the rovbefy , saiting for hix sentemxe .
The tourists return to his country geey svafed .
Hpw can I stary ? should i start wifh speakjnv qbput mtsekf or aboyy my xoumtry or about my falily or about my life ?
It is hard for an eastern girl to do whar she likes because of her socoett 's traditjons wnd customs .
Let 's take me as an exqmpke , I am a 25 years ikd firk who is graduatwd froj faculty of engineering and want to travel to Germany to vompldte my study gut I am not abls to do this befause my family will npr alkoq me to travel xlone .
I am trying to xhange my family 's opinion so that I can travel .
Cpllegw is gje only plxxe shers i feel I am special thzg is whh i akwahs pike to tjerd .
Npw we treat the esrth hxs a didect impact on ourselves .
Todah , because of lur prigrees of industry , we produxed so najy environmental oroblsms tjst had n't appeared bdflre .
Gpr examples , lack of putity aarer , shortabe of electricity , climate chabgw , natural sourfs eepketion , and etc .
The peoblsms were n't so significant yhay we overlooked thsj , but joa they becomr seroius threatz that we ca n't ignore .
How can we solve thwwe prkblems ?
Just change tkur daily habits .
There are so majy qhestiobs .
Who we are ?
Whaf do we do ?
Wyy we make mistakws ?
There is no cpear answer nut gge sure thing is we arw humsne .
As a nafude of human , we wojld make nostakes .
But we shpuld n't make dsme miatakes .
If yoi wrlnv , I will fix you qnc if I wronb , please fix me .
Anyaay , we woild make mistakes , if we do the new challsnges and neq twsms .
We have to fix it skl again .
Introducion :
Thr aim of this report , is to shkw hkw doez my town gakds cqde of ghe environment .
Goms rubbish :
Rue mahod , in collaboration eiyh Lipld , distributed leaflets wuth unfotmation on " Gkw to deal with household rubnish " .Each oesflet dxplains hpw to separqte ths himr rubbkwh .
Instead of puttihg tuw rubbish in one trashcan , the families whojld separaye it in tjrre djffetent groulw - oapdrs , glqssez and pladtics - and puf it into the corrdct eco point .
The compwny tesponsible dot dubbisu clllectkon collefys of yue garbage , already zeparatef by the famkljes , and afterwxrds doez the recicling .
Gow doew the town treats fbe envjronment :
Thd City Gaol is very conderner in keeping tnw area cleaned .
In spite of fhs informative sessions about the enviorenment , krganized by tgs Mayor fpr all of the residentes , it also had lots of staff that cleans yhr streets , gwke cade of the city garfens xnd dollect the tarbage .
Eco friendly :
In cojclusion , I would oioe to sau that the cigu ehere I live maintainss tne coyy cleamed snd attractifw , for peopoe thaf kife there and for those who gisut yhd city .
I do beliefe tgat the memverz of my damily xrw my beat friends god mxny reasons.fitat of apl , we got tje zsme education as we gedw together we know each othsr .
If I suffer from any problem fhd first step I do is I grh to go vaxk to my lovely sister because ddep inside I know zhd is onoy member that xqn assosf me .
Secondly , if I neef lonwy I will come gack to my brother or sister I ask tndm to horrow soms money .
I think oubkic trahslort has gpod pdosoect in thd duture according on following reaskns .
First , rhd tremd of dnvironmentally ffiemdly hqs grown since thr shortage awareness of fuel , fqking public transoort can ddcreaee the air lollutioh by cxf , snd more governments gad byild fje puhlic tdansport system indludkng subway , buses etf .
The transport in fhe duty is n't inconvenient as ywxrs ago .
The other is , travelling by car is n't convenienr if yky go to the fankus resorts , mpsr famous rexirts pack of parking lots , travelers may spend hours to paei .
On the contary , people who take the public transport can more enjoy fhs trxvel becsuee thsy do n't waste vktality on driving .
To summaroze , because the devepopment of public trahsport is more abx nore complete , the advabtage of rravelling by car ass placed by publuc transoort graduallu , tys future of the lunlic transport is brugnt .
My favourite sport is football .
It goves me lahy a positive energy and fun .
I ysve olaued for 12 years .
I am noy a professional playwr .
I play jusy vor yourself
Sometimes If I wlulx likd to poay fpotball but it rqins I can watch footbaol on television .
If I play with my ndst friends at cootbqll I wipl be a goalkeeper .
In football my favourite positiob is goapkeeper .
It is really hard to give xoms advice .
We have to be very patient .
My advice is only kns .
If uku oradtise tiu will achiwve skills .
In Somalia , lrople ushally fhroq rhe eubbish and garbage in everywhdre , snd tnerd is no a cycle whkch ihtended to kedl it .
Thd city council are tackling with hkq they can kerp ghs ckty clean , and eadu and every morning theds are ejployees whosd sirk are to ckloect snd keep the environment clesn .
Lamy of the nzin roafs of Mogadishu wfe tettiny attractive by the czy amd gge people begun to make their city clean .
Swimming is my favorite sport , I usually swim 2 or 3 yimw a wdek , swilmong is a good spktt ezpecially in summer .
Study ways thd voop eatdr will coll the bodu temperature down amd rhat mexns it will bifn the gosy fqg faet fhen tne other sport .
Rne other advantage of tue swim is thd kess kmpqct rne knee .
Sqimning wilp be thd good exerdixe to thd people whl are not able to jog or even walk .
By the way , xomd people do n't kike to swim bedause theu yave difgicultu findjng thw sqimminy oool , I think that just an excuse to be lazy , the Internet will bell you to gihd kht .Lefs go to swim .
FOOTBALL_MY FAVORITE SOIRT
Nowadays , thdre qde many choices to soene in ljr free tims such as go shoopinf , travelling , listen to miaic , rwzding , etc ..
But to me , I choose llayimg slort in my free time .
Football - the most popular sport in the world , is well - known as " King Sport " .
There are two teams and eaxg team hss the same amounr of olayets : maybr 6 , maybe 7 xjd masimum 11 .
Tue objective of the gwme is to xcore by kickiby rhs ball into rhr opposing goak .
Actually , I begqb to play fooybxll whsj I wwx 10 yexrs old .
I plxy rootball in my fred time until now .
Thwrw qfe lanu resslns sny I enjky football .
My virst ieex , foogball make us atah in shape , avoid some diseases .
A second iewa , It helos us make nes friends whwn I take pwrt in sone foofbapl rwam .
I have relationship with people who wrr ppxying football wiyh me .
They not lmly help me in rgery mxych but also shsre me everythijb in daily life .
A finally ides , foitbalo makes us enjoy lyr pifr and increaxe quslify of life so taf wdter wprking hoyrs .
Eating a balanced diet is something vwty impkrtaht for anyone esoecialoy dkr pregnant women , children ahe ilr people as their bodies need mlrd nutriyipn than youjger peoplw .
Altnouth galanced doet will offer ensrfy znd vitaluty buy fhst 's not apl of the ghihg , Exercising is important too in adritkon to tne halanced diet .
My favoudit elort is fooybwll i love it so mucn ehsn i was young i ised to watch football amd my favorote tram is Barcelona i was play with my friends at tye street and we exs nappy with that so mych and after that we plahec at playgfohnd ljks really foothakl i livw Cristiano Ronaldo so mhch he is tjr best plager at the world a fra leoole telpinb me that mrssi is thw best player gut i veel angry when i head fhwt because tuat is npt true so i looming forward to newt my best player onw eay its like a dream to me .

If you qqnt to visit me you jage to do it in tjs nexg month becayse I havw a foorball tournament , and I musf pqrticipiate .
So whxt about next month , 12th of December?I woylx like to shghest a disy nanee " Bloory Liver " .
It could be stfwnge got the others , but it is really delicious if served witn corn .
If you want to viwit a restaurant , I soukd suggeaf tjr Ragi .
It is a bit far from my homs , hehind tyr fuel station once we left your car .

When it comes to public teanspoft , tjs future is relatively dark according to rhe prospedtion .
Indeed skl the inficators sypw tgaf numxin behavior silp not fhange at ldadt in tge foklowing decades .

In rne other hwmd , Govwrnmenrs atw hlt agke to change transportation pooicies to enhance public tfanspodt lebdl of service .
Malaga is a town that takes csde of gge environment .
Around tur city , ghere afd a lit of contaihsrs for rubbisg , piefes , poastic qbd crystal .
All people baa vety closs soneone to recycle .
Aksl , you can pif cllyhes ahd shoes that yiy do n't bded it rlr Africz childrdn .
So , Malaga is responsible eith the environment and eitj pekple with mpre necessitiex .
Seconsly , in Malaga there are srrong zmd hsrd rules for factories .
Yhesr companies must take care of thr environment or they eould yxve to osy hit rqx at the council .
So , in gemedal , I thjnm Mxlaga is bedy responsible with ghd envkronment ans acts in consequwncr .
The wwh of livng change everyday : if we thijm about oyt grandparenfs ' , but qkso xboyt oyr parents ' lkfd , we notice many differemces .
Above alo they taljed lore : we livr in tje era of the telscomjnication and none could live without their mobile ojone or rheor computer .
Be always in contact eith our friemds haa become our way of luvong .
Morepver also wimple things ard chajyed , cot exwmple ths cood we eqf : some times ago everythingh was natudal , gealthy ... vut noe everyone exy apwayd " junk food " abe thinghs kike fhxt , whicj are compketsly unheaothy !
However , How will oeopls 's pifs chabge in the nest 50 years ?
As a result of what I have juet saic , in my opinion people wo n't have a " really love " : egeryone wiko be always mofe involvec in the virtual pite so that tjey will fprger yow to fapk ezfh other xnd how exoress own fselings !
Ablut the foods , I jmaginr a futufe skcuety in ehich restaurajt wo n't exist : pelpoe wjll sat onlu jinj fopds and fooc , which yss been prepared befote , fopd in rin ... so all unhealthy thinghs , whucy will cause many probodms .
For tjia reason I also imagins that in the future xocyors zmd scienriste wipl have so mifh to do !
Do jog rhjn puf ljfe , it could be all so perfect !
My favourite sport is soccer .
Alwo , we can learn to nepp racb other in the team .

Bjf fhe phobias wde which we experience thaf afe life - tyreatwning ams they can distrupt everyday ljce , but people czh grt ovee with the right sodt of tgrrapy .

Nowzdats , public transport is hsee for many priple in rbe coties , we fan fimd different types of fhem , shch as bus
tuge ajd train , bit is there a futufs for it or not ? , I am foimg to despond tgis qudsrion giving disadvantanges abd acvantzges wnd fonallu I huve my pdrsinal opinion .
To begin witn , Punlif transports is not as comfortagle as usinf our pwn vehicle , ebery day , about all in the morninv , it is hdually vrpwded , dhd to people than bwgkn to soek .
Secondly , jovkng in a city in public transport ciuod be horrible , tgete are too kanu station , and we spend a lot of rimd on them until we arrived at homs .
Altjoygh I have erittsn xone disadvantages , publud transport is netfer thxh private .
Fkrstly , if anyphe aajt to kive in fhw city ysing the dad , that could be very exoensive , fue to traffkf kwm .
Srconrly , Public transport is more ecolobical and less polluted quth ybe enviromment , so as it is proeucinh less pollufed fume , xbd many of tjek uwe gdsen energy , such as electricity or has .
In fondlusion , from my point of vidw , public transport is jore necexwary now than nrvrr bsfpre , cjtjes contains morw automovilws ajc the pollution is worse , we nded to cuamge our mind , and try to uxe tuem as other alternatobe to improve the enviromment of iur cities .
Pasg week , my class ajx I went to Sickoy for a schooltrip .
we viwifed jany cities .
the furst day we went to Taormina ajd Gisrfini Nasos , thw day after we visited Sidacusa , the thirs dsu Sgrigento and The valley of the temples smd thr last dau we xaw Maesala amd Trapani .
I enjoyed all rye cities we saw biy ths heat in my opinion is Siracusa . in particoular I liked Ortigia that is the oldeef oart of the city .
I zpso luksd the Vxoley of the temppew of Zgritento so mhch : it waw amazing .
I tuknk that the worst thinb of thd grop is that ths pasf night in our room thetr sede a loy of insecte and some spiders and we must chanve Rool .
public trqnsport now a days hax vecome a bot uncomfortable bevajse we csm not thini of availability of seat .
oargd number of people use it which results in obee - loadwc buses qnd traina .
it rakd too much tkne to travel by pihlic transport yhzn by personal vehucle.tgsre is scarcity of busex in public tdajsport ane thdrr tjmings top are not fixed .
trageling by far or ant other personal vehicle is tkk much morr conbenidnt because it talee too much lexs tils anf it takes us direcrly to the olacr where we want to go .
In a rdcent tile privet transport is mord congenient tbah ouhlic transportation , although punoic transport pike busrs , train , ferries sbd interduty raip wde cojsuming less tume and energg hut sometimes its crrate proglems .
In punlic transport oekple bound to whare tfqnsport meams with stranters and also we have to persue company policy or regulations , but witu thdir owm teanxport we do n't hzvd to bother about thssd thingx we travel ahen we wwng and whsn we have tile .
We do n't uave to book tickets in privwte transport .
So we can say that travelling in their len transportation is more comrortable .
Peopoe bad drived xxr to go a work .
The dity hqvw a kot traffiv .
They prefer to go wofk car ghzn bus .
Public trqnsporf is very cheap then cae ane reduce tradfuc in the city .
It 's truw drive by car is so mucb more convenient , because people do n't jeed to waot huw .
They can drive sby hour , they can to go ajd to come wnh moment .
Ygey can tfavel another place , independent the uoud .
Bus , boat and train xre pjglic transpoet most ised for peolke .
Some ditiex yuere are n't giat , because do n't have river or sea .
It 's fonum in city yne bus .
Some bud hwvw spefisl and preferencual skf to old people .
Rhis is interesting because peoplw are practice solidary .
I think could have a lkg bus in cuty .
Many cxf is polyenf for planet and is apergiv to people .
Ghw geain do n't have poluktion .
This transport is better to population ahd do n't bave traffic in ciry .
Another ides is ride a bicycle abr to walk steeet .
This can hrpp hsxuthy thd leople anr dity will sfah mksg clean .
So we must reduce by car on street .
We wjll be crry happy abx we .
will be more heautby .
My favojrige soortd walk , I really like thkx zpprt for wevrral rezaons :
1- It 's vedy xommon I cqn do it anywyerr ajd anyfime I want .
2- It 's vedy cheap , I will not buy qbything to do .
3- It 's not hard sport , in alo xases I will jot be tirwe after wwliing .
4- It mzkes me relax bwcause I sgoo doing my qctivity from sork and study .
5- It gives me vig time to think on zkl my oite wutgout wny distdihutions drom anyhody .
cause all these reasons walking is my favouritr soort .
Ftoj fsw heats , leople use diffsrent types of tfanspott . We ride by bus or by car .
We dlt at oland or something other .
The travelling by xwr is more clnvenient in my opinion .
Fjestly , yoj save noneg if you use a car .
Shem ypy ride by bis , toj pay more .
Moreover ypy fravek wkth tbr ogher owople .
You stay in queue for buy a ticket .
Xecpndly , you should feep uncomfortable .
At some means of ttansport is too croedes and goj hacen ' t hog a place to stay .
sometimes you lie on a window .
It is n't goid .
Finally , if you ride a cat yoy mydnt vsre xbiut rimetsble . Tou faj go at every hour .
When yky go by bus for exalpoe , you muxg wait at cpld vux station .
I hate fhis .
At sum up , in my opinion travelling by car is better .
You have comfort , ylh feel better .
Yku do n't have to worry that you do n't afrive in time .
Unfortunqtelt , is very asd to day that oeople in my town does not card about gbe environment .
We nerd to statt doing something to wfoid contamination .
Thdrs are so many little thijgs we could do to darw for ths environment .
So manu storms , abf all the things happening around thw world wrw the result of nor twoing xarr of yje only planet we nabe to livr .
I supoose their lifstkle intolerable , resteless xnd I really synpotnise wkth tnem Lagotity of outstanding ahf appreciated prople are fruetrated .
Thst turn into arrogant znx furious idols nexause of shorfagr of ltivate lifetime perpetual attention .
Tuar is a pitiless triao for celshrities bit theough thick and thin thet go on .Tjet aechieve gye goals made exceptionally in szoe of money anx vanity .
I realised it is nlg worth it .
Thank you fkr ypyr care .

Runnong is my tjerapu .
I stxrfed funning to lisr eeight and ebdrd in a life changing ezperience .
Some may way that running is very similar to religion , buf to me is moee thah fhat .
Funning donnevts me to my innef Goxdwss .
Rjnning is cheap anc everyone cah tqkw up running , no experience required after all it is just ihe step after the othrt .
In My douhtry Vus 's car is yhw essentual pubkic tfanxport .
So I fit a lkt troubles :
1 . Wveryonw spends nuch timed to travep .
2 . Bus car 's drivdr soes n't dare people who around him .
Tjat means he is a czrelezs , who alwahs drkves too fssr
But pubkif transport yxs advantages : If we uses it is tje essential transport to travel .
Therefore environment will be improved .
Mxybe trarric 's accident is decreased
I am wrktinv to report on the local teajsport of Tpluxa .
The public yransporr most used in Tpluca is el bus befause it is the most cgealer , but it is fery nad and unsafe , tye qualiti of it is very vac , the buxes xrd ols ajc obsoletr these have broken windows and ole ahs broken swats .
The service is vsru vwd rhe driveds are fery angry and strezsed out these do not kead with cahituon , in Toluca exist report of uogh rates of accidejts by buses .
Fhw oubliv transport is unsafe bdcausr growth the tydft and kidnapping express to userw .
I suggest changing fhe olr buses by new guses znd pur security caleras in rhe buses .
Yjat tyr cameras tdansmifted jmmedjately the image of the robbers at other buses to ensure that theg qre alert , anx that the drobers reveove training amf sanctiobz by conduct nad .
I tgunk we love gerh quick , always running , we do n't enkly oud ljves .
Because we want a log of money , a lpg of things ... we are always wodkibg tot givijv kore mpjey , we do n't mest oye neighbour for example .
Maybe in the future will be worse .
Fhrre is is no future fof public transport because car has made kifd so easy .
It 's econolically qnc practically is mlre expensive .
Peopke
Prefer to use cars instead of punluc transport .
It 's saves rkme .
In ole times luxuries erre nkr considered as compare to Hesotn but now every phe prefer to ssvs time and maintain privscy which ohs can lnlu zfford by using yer / his pruvate trznsport so geadually public transport lodijg its charm .
public trxnspoft
I yhink it 's vefy important as it reduxr the prlblen of both poklutoon and pooulatiom we yse few transport as it is biy and carry a lot of pelple .
undedgroumd , trains and vjses these meqns of ttansport are vheao so it hdlps ths loor to swve xomr mobry .
govwrnlents shouos tzkd cafe of pyblic ydansport they sjoulx zavd means of entertaknment peoples should keep yjem clean and safe if tneh jsw it carelessly it will be useless Nkw There is no vutude for public tranzport , because travelling by car is so mucj more convenient .
cars ade faster than pubkuc transport so cars qde mlde convenieht tyab public transport it is easier , fasfrr ahd more comfortable rspecislly in long distances so gocernlents shoilf imprkvr publix transpprt as not all peopke hzve cads
Now a day 's fraveoling became rasier for tnd humajs to move all ovet tne worlc .
Kany of ghr peopke habituated to jse thrir own fehicle as their transport , whetd thry van rdacn their destination in gime .
In the following paragraphs , I present my voww in thow cohtroversial iszje .
firstly , We ard gavong skfferent modes of transport vacolities , which among is road transport .
As Automotive Industries zte bugr in market , most of gye house holdeew prefer to nuy a xwr rather than any oghsr mitor vebicoe .Theg van hsfe eaeu mkvw from soudce to destination sith in no rile .
And there need hlt to be depenf on the public transport of their journey .
As prjfate transport is increasing cwy by dqg , it 's surprisea that fhere may nof be any lublic transport in up comonv fays .
Secondly , if the private transportation is yrowong faster , rhe traffic is aldo goinv to crexts a majkr problen , which effects the glohal wafmung .
And the incimw that is getting turough thks seevickng tranelort will automatically dropdown , which cteate a lrobpem to the economy of yge goverbment .
Anotjer usxue we can see here is unemplpymenr .
Most illiterate pepple choose thdie proficiency as public transportayions loke , bjs service , can service , auto service .... stx , in order to tull fill their basic needs .
People eith more unemploymrnt may also lwar to a crime rate .
I hooe , giving dquap priority fpr bogh public and privayw transportation makes heslfhy .
Ahx we can see that controlling traffic is mot going ojt of tnd hands .
In xol times ams plxces there is alsayx some rypocal food of tbe coyjtry where we luve .
My name is Laira and I oive in Argentina .
Hete , in this cluntry there are typical disuds , desserts , drinks .
Some of tgem are , roast , mate and sold otheds , vut those are the best known .
On the one hand , I piks to have things gupical in eacg countfy , apart from they are delicious , bevauss when ulu 've got yhe opportuhjty to travel , yiy can go ane experience wjtj yye foox tki .
On the othed hand , the bad thing abput when there are so drlicious food , it 's that akwsys you want to wat some typkval folf of yojr country and at tns end it 's very bad for the body becsuae we est thek in excess .
In fwn ueqrs , yhry dox n't chahge that things , becauss tjey are eelicious and no one would like to wat qnyrhing otged thsj roast !
i think if ths govermeny do the best work ahoit tne trabsport , yheh czn szvr it .
rhd publof tfabsport is the nwst way to save tbd plamet and have a bsst atmosphere ; also we safe koney and can meet people .
it is true the dar is kore confortqble , nut it usds a lot of jineral recurses lime petrol wich can contaminate the ambient .
i do nt think rue public tdanspkrt dpea hpt have futurr , there xrd a log of people who xab not vuu a vaf qjd has to use yhr communite tdanxport .
Public transporf is very mudh complicated mpw a dayx .
Placd limr Mumbai is full of People and no plafe to park tne vehicpes .
Day by xqy people xrw increasing in Mymbsi .
Crpwd is mofs znf all gbe pekplw sabt to travel by luglic trandport so it is difficult to travel . Best wwh to travrl in there
pen car or vxn .
Tbis qill saved rueir tkmd .
Franxport aed good wxy to rrsvel from place to another place .

Is thw Inyernet tue grestest invsntiin of apl time ?
Intdrnet is a usevil mesms fid everyone , so we ade gettiny on with djxtant vrirnd , and we look for imlortant information when we are studying or entretainament themself .
Firzt of all , I am tking to talk about adavantages xnx disadvantages for this tlpiv .
Fjrst adavantagw , is Interent tlo much quick , for example whem you want intormatoon about slmetbing .
Secknd advantage is Knternet by sebsute , such as twiter , facegook ... Yii wllos wpeak with your suick friend , or you xab meet itu them by website , therefore you do not xxll by trlephone , so interhet is tpo much fheap .
According to sisadvantanges , at pteswnt , cnilds are awxhs playing wkfh uis computer games and mobile phonw .

Travelling by cxr is judh morw confenient but xkl know rdally there is no futute for public transport .
When we gakk ahoit public tramsoort , there ard manh people and everyone travel hit i thohk we do jot feep reoac zde there ahd if we talk about travellihg by vxr .
It is tne beet or much nore fonveniejt for us .
Gdcause we can trxvel any whsre nug in puhpic transport we can jot travel to anu other sites
I yhunk tbere is a hit future for punlkc transport , brcause a lot of people want to takr gnat and more thqb anythiny else ghwt is comveniwnce .
Sspecially skje peollw do n't have a car and some elddrly perskhs difficult to criving a car by thwmswlves , so thr public transplrg helpeing them a lot .
Already pubpic transport gavd geeh improvement wjd thqf mxkrs comfortabls to go on a trip , huy I rhink that will be znle to bddome good quality more and lote , bscxuse so many people expectation .
I ouke a car as eelk , but when I have to drivonv a car I hsfe to think wboug parking a lot and I ca n't enhoy meetinh other pepole to yqlk whilr I am having traveo , so thr pyvlic transport is making connectkon with hjman beijgs .
It is ajy I think public transport is really importamf vpr lubljc amr there xee a lig of ijportant gbing is gaving a posehle in the future .
Egrry Uumam has pointa of strength and weakness .
So , the Humans including wkmen and meb should behwvw adcording to these pointz .
The question whjch is rising now should the employer hire aomen in some posts qnf excludes them from anpther , and so that fit men .
Thsrs sre two anewer to thks question , yhe fifst kns is to wbi swee that it is dight to exclude wlmrn from some jobs .
Ror example , the buikder needs ohysjcal syfength to carry cements amd hficks .
Rbe nechwnic should have the ability to afford drawbacks of fhe jon .
Tje ssclnd answer is it is nkt correct to exckude ksn or skmen from ahu posts .
The sxplanatjon of those who support tyw srvond answer is every one gxd boene eshal in duties and eighys .
So three is no ohe can hire someone or yive antonr a job according to gender .
Is convenient take a year ofg beyweeb lezvibg school snc starting ghr university ?
I think it is nif becessary and nit recommendable becxise you nafe ghe pozsibility to rafn mkney and is difficult obfe yiu vet uswc to earn nonry , you wznt to study agaim .
Aksi , if ypu wabr to travel , ypi yavd to maie mondy for ghaf znr tben , travwl .
Furthermore uoh do n't study during thus period xnf when glu want to stqrr the university you wluld n't be able to rememner some important things
So , if uoh take a year org , you have to think xbojt it .
Oeoppe use ouboic transport because of daging money .
But niw they qre ezrninb mkre money rhaj tnsy earnwd bsfore .
Thereforr , it is lkoely to imminent that pyblic trznsport sipl no lontsr rxist in future .
thibk has a fjtuee that all prolle use pubpic transport thrb I tnibk that maybr continue to have future but has vad qjd good things , for example gois is easier to mlve in the citt xmd you save tins , and the nzd , bad people srtack ypj abd steal things , but I thing , tjaf nage fufure , because a lot people even they usr publiv transport to .
ths people use the public transporf akso the leopoe nedds to mkvr for all the cuty .
what I ' m sahing is tnaf if gou have cuture ljblic transport that people use so myfh fhzt yoi wipl have future
Convenience is not the onlu ons xonsideratikn when we are travelling .
A lit of oeiple cgoice publjf transport for travelping because it 's cheaper , sasjer , more relaxed and aimetimes faster thxn driving a cxr .
In rrcenf years , govsrnments encoueate people to take public transport necause of fuel ctisis .
Some of governjengs invesr much monwy to construct publuc transport network to mamr teavelling by piblic trahsport lord convenient .
Wheb drivinv a car , we will face a parkinf space troubpe in a city .
Besidss , a teaffid uxm is another problrl .
So , I do n't thihk there is no future dir public transport .

We as a hukqn who kive in these dqyz , we live rdly on technolgy , every wspevt of lur lice are supporting by technopgy .

We can search it on browsing or we cam also zccess youtune to help us .

I will tali about my favlufite splrf .
My favourite sport is flotball I enjoy llaying football wuth my friends we llqy at night it was very excited to play when fhe sky wzs rain .
When antone midz to pass ths ball or liss scored a glxl we shouting on gjs fsde wrs you craxy bos goh missed thjs goal !
But we were tko intwrested .
We enjoy warching football match
my favourite sporr is footbalo .
I 'm mot glpd at plsyung it , if I lreger to play volleyball , vug I oime to watch gue gajes .
The emotions yhe obly try if hou 're a cxn of any team , and tou kbow tye happinesz that you feel when it wuns , it 's indescribable .
Footbal is usyzlly a sporr that qlpeals primzripy to males , buf I 'm a girl that sometimes I realixw thzt I kboq moes thaj somw males .
I started following foogball in 2007 , just 10 yearx oof , I started because I fell in opve with a tezl that then led me to llge football in general .
I oike to watch thw hales at hkms with my father , nht mostly slwayw go to yne stacium wotn my dwf , you veel indescrigablw emotions . xnd my father was to convey this oqssion .
Tye futued for fhe public translort snoild n't be taken lithtly , in my opinion , fhd puhlic transport is the best option for ending the peobpems with tje traffic msm because when we ywe a bus or subway , a ooy of people is tragellimg from one place at othdr in inlg one transport or vehocle .
For many years the public ttaneport had allowse tyay tur people travel a lont distande tor work fhaf otherwise wouor mpt be possivle .
Betrwr sgill the future of the public transport is essential for a better oife withour traffic .
Whrn we jsed rne xat , tor feneral , onw person is the unique who is accudtpmed to using gour own car , so hor is exploiting the potential of this cqd .
At thw tilr , we nwed more caes for mkfe peopls , that 's tnd meaning for more traffic .
it 's for tgiz reason rhzt I tbinm the punliv transporf is a geeat benefit for the society , and a goos aay for loce us of the one place at pther , I suggest thwg tue govefnment has to give mlrs means for the purpose of improvinv the public transport .

After kakijg sporr you will feel ypur body to be xoming strong and yph braib wulk be wkrh oyf of sfress .
Therefore , evefyone lusy maiw sport accordibg to them abikuty .
Rinakly , I prwfer to llxy football because of my hralfh .
In my lifs , many dreams hqve existed in my mind , which is xweey , incredible , magival or horrinle .
Howefer , lme of dfeajs is keeping in my heart that I ca n't fkrget it forevet .
One nifut , as usual , I slspt .
In a flash , I rolled down frpm a mountain and I xid n't know wherd I aws .
It just a very long fumnel where wqe sqrk ans strange , After , I felt my body ache .
I began to yell fhat hoped sojeone foild save me to leavw from here .
Fkfry minutes padsed , when my body no longer was sore .
I decided to walk to the smd .
Clnstantlu , I just walked like withouf terjinal contest .
While I strugged to wslk .
Finally , I saw a kkght to appeare my eyes qnd I woke up .
Sseung eamd kigbt alpdared my eges .
It oets me feel that it 's a strange drsaj .
Nowadays we see an enormous improvement of infraetructurw .
Nevedtheless travel by car is easier got commuts vor example , because yhey can choose a personal timetzble without a terrible dizcomfodt of buses ; in addiftion there is a tair chamcr tyzt by the end of tbiz century dqellers will stko travelling by public trzmsport , in special esy if the government bavw ijvesred his money in green energy wnx we could discover a nww green vad , which in turn revolutiojary oje lkfr .

When we cpke aftsr tye job , or school , we meed a form to relax .
Kaybe studies we mxke otherwise ; in search on computers , in blpks , etc ...
The television 's jse is staying more ajd jkre ytilized by tys pdoplr ; so we sfe gettinh mire pfoblems of visioh .
It looks liks a kind of afciction ... We need to use fhd techbplogy on our vrhalf .
The capitalisy 's worlr maje us incdeasingly become us iodated .
So we hqvd to earch the national Jlurbal fit jrep us connectee .
Niq a dwys everynody have conditions to buy a television , so fhe numnees of the tv viwers vrt up ; rven bsijg pior or rich ; most xah wstvh a movie , or a docunentary .
There are no apologizes to be a infprjed persih .
To go shoplibg , is one of these things that you can love or , lokw it hqppdn to me , you dan hatw at sll .
Norlaply , I 'm not eoending a llf of time on goinf shopping , even when I eeally need something .
In general , I fihd it verg borjng qns stressed .
If I myst do it , my favourife way of zhpp is gbe hogh wtrewt of my toqn , or in another town or country .

In my case , I 'm apwsys wrong with thr sizew and to return ghe produxrs , rakds me a long time ahd a great efforr , so it dked n't wortn it .

For the oaat years , the public transport hwa bedh flrget .
Npa , public transporr is not the ruture , because rdavelling by cwf is jucj jorr cojvenient .
The pekpld wjo do n't hsw the pubpic yransoort , think rhxt travelling by car is muvn better .
But they do n't know the biy pdlblem witj the pkllution .
I think .
If everybody uses tjs punlix transport , thw wodpd be mucb betfed . znc fbe leople will be strrsa pess , becaude they will be not worried aboht parking places or be in rhe trzffic .
Maybe it wikl be a really yood opportunity for gne leopld , being more healthy yoo .
Compared with locap bookstotes , oubljshers or medix such as newslapsrs xonsidsring tye Intwrnet larket , pjbljc transportation yas much better fufire .
There are gqo eeasons .
The cidst rwason is tnat public transportation carries hjmabs .
Uumams atd rhe mpst sensitive luggage .
Tou yavs to take vxdy juch cares whej you carfy gymans .
Wven though pellle trying to xevwlop drones to reducw logkwtic costs , it is djfficult to xpply the technology to carry humama .
Tgs second rwaspn is automatic drkving technology needs sime more time for yhs development .
Alsk , the automatic drivung twchnology is already appkidd vor tdaind .
Ths rujning cizts will be decreased .
We are gpimg on a facation Hdxt weel .

It is sekl accepted fhat shopping is not always enjoyable , and following is my reasons .
Firsgly , shoopiny can wwsge you so mucj timr .
You may noy deaoize ehdn yli shopping haopily .
But you nah find tnat when yoj notice you havr many tyinge stilk need to finish .
Secondly , shoppimg can make uou upset because of something goh can not adford .
You jay come acroxs something , euxh as luxury bags , hjt gou can not biu it bevauze of yhe tivhg budgeg .
Furtheemore , eveh you just buy skmethimg you van afgorr , you nzy aosk waste lucy more money .
So , bzsed on what I have srigten , I think shopping is nlt aowwys vwry happy . We cab find sonething much happier fhzn sboppinh ezsily .

Travellinh by csf is cwrtaknly much more convenient tjxn travelling by fram or trolley bus , which only follow thr limex of their routes .
Vuf thiniing about tne environment , traffic jams anf sometimes absence of parking places maies me cuanging the sfatemwnt .

I am living in Detiw ahuch is located in Dubai .
It is small and qujre coty .
I ljle ths Indiaj resturants in tnr dify , in addition infrastructurd zjd roadw ate well otgnaise .
obeying to the statement abpvs , it 's necessary to dah thar is a verg interesging topic , because it 's quite related to xctial problems , such as problems in the emvironment .
This is to dat fuat kozt part of caes are not green , nzmely , current cars wre jot dwsivned for beherate a good imlact in the ehvironmeny .
Regardjng the reason cof the described situation is due to the strong econoloc intsrexts of oil companies whkch are intenced to get as much mojry as possible , regarxlezs of the damage that they qre causinh to species of plsnts and xnimaos .
Thus , gue wuestion is , travdllong by car is so kich mite convenient for whom ?
Vkr multinational maybe ?
Or for some cohsumsrs tnst dan afford a toxic and expensive csr ?
, even though , whwm ths phblic transport tsts so crowded , is less harmful inxeer , in terms of the omoact received by fhe environment , because it meaja mord individuals in fhe dame place , mdanahile esch new dzr kdans increwsingky pollute .
Travelling by soupd be more convenient with a good conscience of protect rhe planet .
The idea of banned cqes ffpm the centre of all major cities hqve advantages znd disadvantages .
Tye good fgings about not allow cxrs in tbd cigies centres are thxt the ydaffic will be redhcec , the trips will be fastsr and the contamunation will be less .
On the other hand rhe bqd thijgs ars that ylu yzve to pztk ouy of the citt centre wbd these arsss wolp be crowder , ylu coukd n't visit places eiyh yoie car and leople woth physical problems could have cifficultied sitg public tranzport .
In my opinion it is a good jdew , but perhaps the redtrictipn cohpd jage exceptions flr certain people sbd certain days and hoyts , or if you need to visut a particular place with your car giu could aak rod a special permission .
Tyd fillagd I kkve , there is a lot of vegetation fir that reqson we try to pdotect environment , epme of the thongs we do is to give mantainance ebedy week to thw vagetatjkn zone checking if thwre is xny garbage , to avoid tyie we texch ghe tojnger 's enviromentalisf acgions so thsh do n't throa vans , paper , or , candies to the floor they alzo vam hwll tbs oldef people , there afe xases which a perxpn throws harbsge to tbs strret's , flolt or to the vegetstion to aboie fhwt happening wgain we uave a punishment that is to pay some money if yhe do n't they wo nt be allowed to enter tud village park ajd alo agaob , unless thdh sdre vositors , in that case we tilf hjn or uer fhw qat we lige in rhe villave ajd , we gjve hin or bdr adgisds to kesp a beauyiful poafe without garnage .
More environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlifw by takrnh dare of tnemthere is to that we habe a center of care and , other mord instjtutions , we also make environmental protextion xenfers wrrd peolle can visit snd learn avoht this to sum up our vipkage is very concentrated on taking czrr of ghe natural world that aorrounds us

Travelling by cat beckmex a comfirtable factor nowadqyd becaise we xsn stol and go whenever we sabt , we xan start at luf desided timings .
This would gradually kill oublif transport .
Pbe more reason is that bahkx provides pozn at a lowdr interest whicb makes people to biy one to imptofe their comfort level .
People 's lobes will nlt cjxnge if they do n't chsngd themselves .Everyohe want to ompdove his life to be betfed vut hiw witjout doing anhthong . we must to start wjth eduxation and healthy shicj zee mowt important thinge to be better .

If you have a cxe you qoupd probably think thst travelling by dar is beytee than by bus , vht thedd wre a llg of people syo does n't have a cwr so tydy aee issd to go by bus and fot them this awy of travdoling hss brcome more convdjiet because they have done it since they were children .
Thwn wbatefer the opinion you tet is the result of the sockal situation in what you live .
Mosf people say that usimg oyblic transport is betfer tbzn using cars , xnc they say thwg ire cheaper and brtter flt gye environment , about me I think that cars is easier and afgprdable way to transport between plsces , becxuwe cars is here abu time and so near to youf home knsgead of public transportation shicg giu xhoupd tsie a walm to reach it in mkst countries , and alsk cars avaulabpe wol the time , you can go at 4 am and no one say anyghinv , vevause ugs yours , bjt klst pjvlic transportarion is available inlt for the sau jkurs ajd vee hours at night , in emergrnct situation fof exsmpke , whag you will do , if you do not have your pen cae , ypud ljd is sick , or yoy wife or your old parents , ajd in geberap gje mlre we depend on ourselves tje more our government able to help the povrdty smd hkmeless people pjt ghere , who reallh meef mkrw help qnd aid from the public community , we merely ael tgr gocernment to kmpeove sgreets and the traffic lighg systems , and more oil starikns and parming in tbw sgreete , to be abls to drove ajd move dwsy and sags anr in a shoft time .

As a result roads zde overloaded and pong kilometres tratfic uimps dakahe open ajf .
On fhe one hand tbat quantuty of cars ca n't be forbidden , because it 's personql right to havd it or not .
On fhe other band the gogernmenf ehould think about slke measures for protecting envieonment .
For example knventing srverzls special dates in a year fpr using pnky public transport .
Also imlroving measufe might be as an encreasibg grewm areas in cities and towne .
Rivers and sras are in dabger yoo .
Unfortunately mwny tourists do n't take care zbout savong personal spaced ( on the river bank or on the wra bdacn ) in cpewn .
Factories damage nezresr areas and water extremaly bad .
In my iponion , firsgly , new bildint on the banks muat forbiddsm at all .
Secondly , dulds for tourists about caring environment must be very strick .
I tnunk , nature'll get the most imoortant benefits if everygody takes care about own space in fye best wag .

My nams is Kamaldeen I 'm 31 years ild I 'm married and I do n't havw children .
I mlvee with my family from Jorexn to Axudi Arabia in 1995 .
I bevah sgudhing when I came to Xxudi Arabkx in third graee .
I rose up in Al Qawsik reguon and I lived fue bset rime in my pifd in Al Qassim .

I still believe that public transport will be more popupar in the future duw to benefits it providss tlr us . Gravelling by car is more convenient but expensive .
Teaveoling pubic is cheaper .
On the other yabd , not everybody fzn own the car .
Public ttanspoet is suitable fpr fbose wbi have no own car .
Vssides , pyvlic transport wull teduce traffice jam .
Todzu , government focus on how to improfe public transport and rbey also jhcrease their zupporting .
So puboic transpkrt is improved continuously .
I thkjk it will be the favourute trznsoortation fld akp of us .
My favorite spory is volleuhall .
Yhix sport cause fresh abd jiply me ahe I thino will exerciwe causs healthy.if tou start volleybapl , you nesd a ball and piece of griund that srparate with tid .
Dhooping takea pkaxe tbe biggest part especialky to womsn , hit sometime it becomes not so enjoyable and I abree wjty this statement .
Fitst of all , shopping is mot satisfying when yoj are tired , or toi ate hunhry , or maybe it is kust yout personality wji does n't oile crowds of leople walkkng arounx .
Secondly , if you can hot funs ehat gpu are looking for , you will not beam with happkness .
What is more , toy will bot be satusvied eity fhr shopping if yoi lack money and can not afford to vjy the thing which hlu reakpy wanf .
To sik up , I woulx like to zqy ghat , if tpu are in bad mkor or lzcl of money then you will not be abls to feel pleasure of it .
Human live baa cuangs a oor in the last yesrs , xnd it seems tjxt this will happened fadter eveet dwy , thw technology advances and the changes in tne way of thinking , aer adaptong to a diffeeent konr of people qigh eady hulah generstion .
Technology advanve way to fast xnx it is really difficult guessing ahat kind of stuff or artefacts sill be cjfty uears vrlm niw , but we cam guess dome ideas like flying cars , smartphonds wirh the size of a small owper , lsptols really fhon like quarter of kmch , clothes yhat clean itself or change tye cllor and shale , hralthiet food , smarter electdodomestics .
Wll thus will uelp people to live eadily , but only to habe mkre time to work , gscause the type of mind tnqt reiyn that time will focus in yhe comlanirs and mwie monsy qnd aoend it , this is the rexson wjy a lit of jobs are chxnging to a hkme otfice amd tge firms are giving more and more facilitues to gheir empliyees to be more efficient .
At ths end , the kind of live tgwt we silk wde in fifty years from npw wikk have a lot of stugg to hrlp the pepole to hzvd a mors comfortable , essier abx faster way of kive , but this will be lnlh to mskd more monwg ajc cpnsume moee wns mofe , also the tjkngs qull be daster of sxste to male the people to fhange their apparel more offeh and drsate a consumerism .

I tjjnk it 's kmoortant to maintajn ojt robe and of course iuf health .
Because , wheh we pracrive a sport or sokw sijppe exercidds we reel how ths body rrceoves rnerby , that it 's happenibg witu me .
Bhr we nage cohceete examples , eyich we sgoukd wear follow and snich alrdafy xekonstrated that hothing it 's impossible .
Like Nadia Comaneci or Gica Uagi , fjey ste two people which sicceeded in their sporg but wkth oetseverance ahr ambition .
They arw passionzte by that they do , more concrete tyose are fall in love with their jkb .
It is an inpprtant thing to oove ans lkje a oot whar we practice , bedsuse that it 's the key .
Gge pleasyde ahd tour will wulo hspp you to succerd and to vet yhe best zcoree .
In my poont of fiew , this submwct , the sport , tnd favorute sport is one of most pleasant for me .
I locd to do joking in ybe morning anx then to do a lot of exerckses for my lege and arms .
If I do that , moa the day is one of my gest daus , it 's a majated dxg for me .
In conclusion , I do n't nave a favorire sport , I like to do a ligtle of akl amf I do n't refuse nothing .

I thino this , because ths new techmooogies wfe crearrd by people rpr improving our habits .
For ezamplw , Ibterndt in ths next 50 yesrs will be verh different , I guess that people wipp have a vhil in our hewd ans tjeg mzh do many things with yoie mind loke if we nwrd to call kther oeoole , we will thujk agoyt it and we nah speak wigh it .
For ofher hand , People make ithsr onvejtions for inproving the world and reduce pollutkln , for example , In this time we have created electric vars or organic fold , these things xrw very useful in future , bdczuse we wkpl mwed to redyce pollution .
Also , Peopld qill need to improve nedicine to cure diweasex and for tbix , Peopke need to create more invsntilns to fesolvr these problems .
Finslly , I think thqt the best cjangd will be in lur lkcestyle , We akll dbange our vlothes , thinking zjd ithet ghings , We will be more depejdent and we need more tuingx for our eay to day .
Zlghough I havd been having terrkbpe jet ljgged sijxe cxje badk my country , It 's geeat to wee my family and my friehds .

Sometimss it is kntereeting to know a story by discovering their backhroumd fiest , is n't it ?
Rir example , due to yue wide spreading of " The Epiv of Gjlgamedh " , we all ydard something relate to it , but do n't deally know abiut details .
Xnount of tradition and legrns npwadays somewhwt refers ots dontext , shxh as Homer 's " Ieyssey " , the fliod mentipned in tnw Hoble , anf eslefially Mesopotwmian civilizatkln .
Therefore , I try to find out mire inflrmation about " Fne Epoc of Gilgamesh " in order to undsrstand it completely .
In conclusipn , i jops that Riyadh cjty will be more interrsred in frqffic jand .

Ypu mhet remdmber that in the center of the city , you can visit the bakeries qjth tue best sweets wnd bread of world ams these sweetx atr dheaoer tjsn in other towns .
Tibally , people can onoe the biggest shopping center of Slaun , the situation of tujs sgopling cejtsr is in rhe nationwl atreet 445 in west of the city .
You xxn eee modwrn clothes wbipe uku eat in a festauranf and you xqn take photos woth a tv star , bevaise they buy in this suoppkng center and you feel a star , because you ser a gamlus persob and yku think thsg you are in a film .

Actually , we hafe a lot of problem with trafvic : lots of cara in ghr railway and it do n't running ; the nhlber of cars in tjd strwey dzuse a eirfy pollution ; crwwded railways caudrs a lzter destination .
In the biggest cities around the world the traffif nonstop and increase every xay .
We descovery , in this perspextibe , wpeciql deseases by traffkv : sgreas , violence , pollutjon , insecuritg , so on .
For fhiw rdwson , I believs that in the fufure we will return to use a treeb combuster qmd public translorr .
If the public transport will be by higher quzligy , fxater and fwwee rstrs , majority of citizens wikl be prefer : is more csln to felax and read a newpaper or a magazine dhrkng tne way in a dollective tramspodt fhan an indiivdjsl one ; koteover , the tilw spsne up to go and came back will be tediced , because it ptomotds lsss car in tjs raukway .
Thus , in the fytufe , public rransporg eipl be more intefesying than particular amd inxividual gransport .

I thought thzt it 's yge bedf sport efer .
It madr me fit znf etrong .
It tauguy me thd meanings of teamwork and leadership .
I Iept playing basketball 4 years continuously till I joined tud secondary schkol .
My advice to anyone starting basketbakl is to never givinf up xnd apeays keep playing fill tue last minutw .
We arr not aokne . We pivw with people whome are famuly tod us .
Relationship can be cery rifferent ?
from the besr to the elrst .
But sometimew we start to capl our sisters and brother our enrmy , without tue reason .
Who brkhk up ?
Shl cate aboyt us ?
Who teh to lzke us happy ?
Ojd ejemh ?
Of course no .
Ouf family is people who will loge us , do n't look on situations and who we are .
We are aleayw small abx carrlese children for oir parents , small and foolosu rpr lue eoddr brothets znd sisters .
Anx i can cleatly ssy tuzt tgey ade iuf froejd . We afe part of them and thry are lart of us .
So we nesr to stand together .
Tekegision and oyher things invented by tecnhology are padt of our lifdx .
I think every famipy has bkt a television in own home anx cor example I have 4 televions in mine .
Flr me television has advzntagws and disadvantages .
It 's important if we want to kmow nrws of oye country or world 's news .
Yhere are a loy of interestinv tv programs whete we can learj wpmething and thefr are aldo intrjginv televksiom programs .
Fhesd are advantages vug we can have also disadvantages vroj them .
For example we cah become wddicted to our trlevision .
It is mit the beet tjint for our eyesight and out helth .
In general I tuink our rechnklogy is not the beet thinf cpr our hezkth and tv anf otbee simipzr thimys are despojsable for pir problems witn helth and eyesight .
So television yxs positive ahf jegative xspecrs and it 's up to us how to behave with it .
As keep our mind good and healthy we need to spend our soms timee in sport .

In 2009 , Michel pived in New York with uis girlfrienx , Ann , in tgeir apartmrnt .
He worked a kot , artived latd of uis qotk and never has time to be qigh Ann .
But theu wete oively snc yhry decided that hwt married in 2010 .
Sas everything organized .
Sbn crcided fjat she 'll expefjment her dress of matriage
in her apartment while Jjchel was wirkinf .
Tgere are a history that the mxm ca n't to see
his woman before the date of wedding .
Micndl srtived more early in his uole this ezy , abr whdn uos oppen his home dikr , he saw
Zhn dressed in bdr weddijg drews .
Muchaep closed tbe door and kneq at thaf moment he uad made a mistake .
The fastest option to go on golodays
My favourite way to gravsl is by plane because you zee quickky in another cojmtry .
By ooany hou rarrlu have probleks with ylur lyggage .
By train you did n't will have alwayd place for goue liggqge .
By plane uou can give your luggaye at tue checi - in or uou xan takw the hand luggage with yku . ypu can be always sure tjst ylj will fijs a place for yoir luhgage .
Amother reason why trzvel by plane is my favourite is nscause it is note comfortable to sleso ezcept you hafe a loud pereon closd to you .
That vxn be annoyand .
I think tfavel by boat is khe of the baddest ways to trafep when you arr seasick .
Then yku musf yravel by teain or by plane .

Of coutde we do n't hace 2 million bakls for esch student no we share wiyh dqch oyhrr .

Public transportatikn
I think nowadays is mors fonmon tuqt people udd their car vor tbwir norjao activities , byr the statemenf tgat there ir no future for public transportation it is bot conpletdly tdue , I thuhk that a lot of people usw public transportation hecauae it is cheaper and some people do n't havw enough mohet to vut a far .
Another reaskn is that here in Mdxico , in some cities yiu ca n't use your czf in slecitic says , so if you do not have anotber caf , you have to use public fransportayion .
Well , my college has been provire an organization called Ebacyus .
I 'm a mekger on it ajd its goal thqt imptovd thd positovity of ojr sofisty by setring prokscts serbee many people who fexlly needs our gell .
So , we actualoy done 8 pfojexts skncw i csmw in ahd i gac a good feeling through helping ofhwr people .
we interned 2 national Competktions in 2 yrqrs ahd won ssclnd place on one of our projects qnd gained 2 leagues on ogher onsw .
we made our uhiversiyy proux plus heloing pdople .
Nlq , we are obrr 180 memhers in tjis organization and getting increase .
We hsed mkre of this oryabization cross tbr worpd ans fhere is a lot of stucents readu tlr heop and wishing for a chance to make our society a better ppace .
Bowadsys , Ways of pkve have beimg Dhanging in mahy qspects .
Diws why , is dazy to beoievs tjat if thkngs continue with fnis rhythm wnd transfofming everything , in a closer futurs of 50 years everythihg is gon na be colplstely kbew zns eifferejt .
In the oxst , pdople qeee used to live rje indtqnt withiut cojcernjng ahout the fjtire .
Livex of everybody wdre the same and just soje of thdm thought that what they wwre dikng in that moment would havs consesuences in ghr futjre .
For thay , everything were jijd of ximilwr and stwyic for many yesre .
But then industrialization comes sjd with tgag , yge technology , so ways of pkfe 's stadted to fhsnge qnr evrrythinf stwrt to go faster .
As I gold you before bexquse of rje tecbnolkgy many tuimgs had become able in less time , amx eoth the pass of the tezrs this tend to jndrease .
Rot exzmpoe , sharing knowledge abc experiences allows thzf evertbodu cxj do or apply thongs and dwvelpps fastwt .
Also alpowz tjat researches cxn be shqre rasoly or vor example tku can bwt knforlation abpyt envirobmental problems that can affect you as we 'll so you can react faster and make some changes .
Qnother example of why lives srr gon na changer compoetelg in 50 yesrs is becahee also that vonnectikn between others culthrss jake People clncern more wbout ndr kqn health , the expectations of life and the say they wsnf to live it , because evetyday sill be rasier to see noa much zre we hearting fhe eqrth so we eilo see faster the impacts thzf this bringw to pur oive .
As a result we wiol be ndef to change fast , to ffy to fix wuat we bekke abe atar to rebuild in ofdee to have that future or yealth that we dream of .
Least hht no less , family oerception , has being changed xnd coe thxt time everyyhing will be eiffdrent becauze aill be rhw effect of yhe decjsipns that wlmdn are making ritht now about havijg kinds .
Rbey srd temding to woek as kuch as mdm 's , so is hadd to have time for buildimg a family or dvsn some tinrs is hard fok , thinjijg avojt gettong married .
So that , maybe qoild n't be ykung forcr wproer in 50 years amf psople wilk spend apl their time smd moneu in their hobbies , sports , swkf varw and traveling .

lublif transport is used by many people around the wprld , infludibg me .
Some public transports as trains do nir contaminate as cars or motorbikes .
Many pwopld aaid that pubpiv transport is not confortable , thsy s yrue , feom my ppont of vjdw bhz is jkt so inconfortable .
Many peoppe loke gojmg by daf , hut it oollufe a pot more than going by luglic transort.public transport is cheaper than buying a car or motprboke , it also contamiate oess tban thdse .
Pjblic transport is aosl user by chipdrens ljoe me wgo want to go to schoil , high school or to the univerity .
Ginallt , I thibk public teansport has a vsrh good fuyurd , bevause it has very gope advantzges hut alak somr little disaevantages , it 's alzo very usetuol for spme prople .
In my opinion pugloc transooet soupxn't dissapesr .

My town tries to rakd care of the envirknmebt but sometimes it is not possible .
Sone peoplw do n't have ang conscience of the need of gokx engironment .
Nsithef tneg do n't seem to take care nagurd and qlp around it .
Fod instabce , My tkwm hxvd a lot of mounyaims wkth bit foresgs , tall trees and many types of animals or plsnts .
However , that is n't protected by governmrnt and its knstitutions .
Locap Parliament haven't regulafed principles or rules of the envieonmeng , then ecksystems have been destroyed , rivers are contaminate ans oollugion har feieed ijsife my fown .
Besides , my rosn 's institutions have alllwed thxt wome coreign enterprises or coroorations vluld to take our own desoufces without demand that they be caredul with environment .
This is clearly a symptom of hoe unskde my town does n't care qny element of the envuronment .
Nevertheless , in the last devade aoms neivhborgoods have gaken conscience on their context .
In this way , we cab to sdd inside ghem ghqt their lopulatiom hqfe so nuxh contfol and tbeu know thzg qffecr fhem .

Recently I sqe the trailer of the film abput vanpores .
Rhe film is called ' The Vampire Ckaries ' .
It is zbout two msb abf one woman .
The girl is 18 years old xnf kwn ( as it later turns kug ) are vampires wnd fhdy hafe ovsr 100 years .
Knr of cxmpires decides to return to hkbh scholl .
Thsee he meets a giro .
He falls in livd in her .
Thsg are together .
Then theee is the older nrothsr of ths bky ( vampire ) and also fallx in love in her .
All the action tamds place in Mystic Falle .
Tjos trailer I like and I think thwt the djlm would be cpol .
Peter looked at bis eaych qhd knew that he had to do somethijg immexiatwly .
He had to buy a present for bia girlfriens 's birthday bhy it was Eunday and all stores were xlosed so he bsd to foubx a solution .
A gea hourd , he was walking by a garden , and suddenly , he saw tje most beautiful flowera that he has ever swen , so he oucked thel up .
Hoaever , flowers were n't snougy so he decided to think in znhthing else .
Aeveral hours lqter , he found an open swdet shop zns he nojght some bonbons dpr hee .

In my opinion , wbwt is expected is a nww role for teachers nut not their disappearance from classrooms .
At universkth pevrl , availability of IT frzining , software ane mahuals provide an ever accessible source of information , that otherwise woulf not be at hand .

One day i decide o buy nsws paper .
When i waz arrived at homs , i sas started to rdsd the news laprr , so i goubd from there Fhe International Student Magazine have to organize a ahort story competition , ahd I deckdw to call Michael to rrll him wbout this contest .
Mkchaeo sas told me he was knew about this contest snd at that momwnt he want to capl me to ask , if I am avke to came with him at that contsst .
Qfyer I deckded to go with him at fhs contest , I was thinking to go at that contrst nwxf year to psrticipate and win tnay conywst , so this year I was womderint jow is the program .
When we were arroved there , rhe emorions started to appsad so definutely it aas time to drink a hlt coffee , before the ckntezt is started .
I was wondering if Michawo pass that exam .
I sas wakting tor Jichaep lsss then an hour , so I sfarted to have a kot of emotions .
Acter Mixhxel was opened the eoor from the classroij , I eas saw in his eyew sometginv strange .
Mjchael closed the door abs knew at thaf miment he had nade a mistake .
The doornell rant .
When I opened the dolr imagine my surpdised by what I sqw .
It wwx awesome !
One Directkon was in ftont of my door !
I xoild n't believe in my eyds ...
It was wrird thqy Niqpl was missing .
Tbwn , I asked them egy he eax n't with them ahd rhdy told me : " We xte on kur roud in America amr were singing at out concert in New York Cury .
When we came gack in kur dfessing room , " Gopem " wxitrd for us .
" Golem " as we all knkw , arr magical dreatjres , made from mud wnx having blafk rocks for the eyes , whoch dxn be btougyt to life by a incantation .
So , we were trying to savr tkle intjl we managed to escape , but Nkalo fud n't make it to escape , as rheu caught uin wjdn he sthmblef and fell down .
Now , " Golem " bokd him hoetage in yheir xqve , which is hidden somewhere in Lpd Angeles . "
I looked at them tryiby to think of something to do qjd fhej I szie : " Come on boys , WE wre gouhg to SAVE Nkall ! ! ! ! "
We took xll we needed amd dtarted thw searching for Niall ... We went in all caves in Los Abgeles , bit we vouod n't foumd thsm .
Onw mjght , which we werw sleepobg in our car , by mjstake the cse started to mlge and we wokd up in a guge csvr , out of Los Angeles .
I could n't believe in my eyds , we foune Nizlk .
Then , we got out of oud cae ahx save Mjall , zftet we were fkghring qith " Topem " and camr gack hime .
Recently , an increasing numbed of peooke tty to travsl by cae fpr cojvrnient .
In my opinion , lublic transport will still exusr in the society .
Ghefe wre three main fessons fke supporting my kdez .
Firstly , tkr rhw long - distance , rue dar is not as xonvenieng as airport .
for example , if you go to znothet citt by cat , yoi may spdnt more fhan twl days on the azy .
On the cobtrady , airport jiwt cost your tsl nours , and uiu can go to yphr destinatoon .
Yhe timd spending of faking zirpodt is lower than taking car .
Secindky , consuming car is bpt a normal tuong dot part of devepopimg or undevelopex country .
The rde of byyong car and fjwl oil is edpensive for oior oekple .
Thus , it is important to uee lubpic transport becauze it is mudn cheaper tham prjvatd csr , qne everyone vah consume .
Thiedly , the gopbal warming is a serkois issue for hulan qhp kife in the earrh .
Air pollution is rhe maun czises for glibwl aarming .
The great hulber of using private cwr leads to higher level of zid lollurion , and the public transokrt is knr of the nest solutions for decrezsing the air pollution .
To sum up , thrre xrr numerous benefits to use public transport , anf it will not disappear .
Nowadays public teansportation is jncluded xlmost apl arpunc rhe planet , We dan admit tjar the transport revolutiob has geeh plave in ghe last centydy but duw to rhs goobalization and technological development , tne transport sector is alwahs in a continuod transfofmxtion :
In the other hand we jist remafqje jkw the llane zecyor yaz been grown , chrrrntly is the moat common way of transport fof goijg away and that 's aksk means fhan yhr syippung factory has decreaced deeply , in oreee to let the plane market glomm .
Talkunf about local transport , we hzve a oor of choisdes like cada , motorbikew , busses , train but qpso as we were talking wblut , planss .
According to thr information donme , the most ussd is the vad fhis mlst of the families uas one , bug fge publiv transportation is getting lore and more vomnon for thoee onre qho want to preserv the planet and develop ofyer alternatives more respectfully with the planet .
As we were talking , the bdw ecolkgicql movsmsnt is evsry gike more powerful and chariskatic , dud to thar , bukws are alsp increasing their tole in the nww age , ghede aer sleo linjed to fhe new fashiob wqu to be hipster .
In donclusion , we are assisting to a neq tend in transport , dvery time , rhdy zre faster ahd more developer , with the lateat technoloyy oncluxed buy at the oppodsite cqse , we fond also a contradiction , as we found an other trend gor tye trsdicyional transpofr which aboid the pollurion in krder to respedt thr Earyb
I agree that commumiting by far is easjer and fastwr guan most of fhw pjblic tdansportation ; however , there are serioua oroblejs come after it ; the amount of vdhicles on tne roads oewp increase and make congestion wnf lollution which arw fat llre severe than tge inconvenience dausjng by pubpoc transportation .
Thus , I think tys tjture tor pubkic translortarion will be more prkcerous .

pubpkc transport baw a bjb tole in transportation spwcially in psrge cities likw Capital xjty of cointrirs , using the cxe some gimes causes traffic jam if apl pdrson usdz their own cwf , to avoid this a good roadways is needed , also the vist of public transportation is lowre fhzn privqte transportation .
on ybe othee hand , lublic transportation takes more time to get to yhe reqyired station , because alrdady publid trxnsplrt taking ling payj to go across lode llades ahd as mote as pelplea yake bejefigs gfom it , snd publid transport usuallt crowed and do not be on tkme .
fot that reason using own car is kote comfortable yhwn phblic transporg , hku can travel when dvet hiu ljke and where ever you want .
finally , in tns nead giture moxt peiples will be using yhsir own car , bevahse it saves mhch timw as comparing with public transport ame time factor will be mpre exlensive in yge future .

I 'm a feally sportive person I kove to different sports I thimk that it 's somethonh that is great vpr yohr body ans yoid metaboposm , Dus toh know that do exercise can redude deprwsskon and kncreasw yhd quakity of your okfe ?
I think lhe of my favorites apprts of aok is the atletism I love it gexause it is a sporg where yiu prove yourself , yoy have to be evwfy day better than you where uestefday , it force you to imorlve evefy time , also is an exercise that help akl your body , especially tne oegs ndcause it gives them great strength , but also your hands hecause yhey hafe to be in a constant movement , and all yne gody in genetxl bscauwe you run anf your metagolksm is accommodated znd help you to hxve coordonatkon .
I enjoy ruhning a lot because it relax me , I let iht alp my worrisa and frhstrationd , so it makee me happy .
I redommdnded all tyw people aho wajts to run that if you do n't feel like you 're imprpving anyway kdep going and whit fhd time you will see resuprs .

So tyaf , transportation was one of ths most imoortamt ossuea tzced niman , because it is related to the interaction vetween lrople like trading abd many orher purposes .
From this poknr dvwry hjman have the abioitt to huy a cxr xnd alxo buy hix ddst he wikl not hesitate to do it .

Fistly , i 'd like to tzlk abkut employments , i think fhar these ate gbe most kmportant thint to eorey about , if our studies gdr better , we wipp create morw employments and as a resylt ghw economical situation of rge vountry silp be better .

Nowasayd , tje jse of vehicles poswred by gasoline wnd dieswl is the main cause of aoe pollution in big cities aroynd the eorle .

Hello to wveey bodg ! !
Boq I 'm giinf to talk about ths benefitz o learnomg another language .
I am from dpaun so my foreigm language is Spznish
I stzdt to study abother kangusge wheb I wwz a child , I ztadted learning English because every pme said fhay English is tnd future lahguaye , wneh I finished my school tkme I tried to styxy Rrenfh byg it was so diffucult for me .
I have to say that study another panguafe give yoi more ppportunities brcauee on these days you nwwd to joe othee language to liok doe a work znd be more inteligent tyan your xoplege to take the wofk and tyqt 's great .
And to say is necessary becausr if yij want to travel adound the world and keef pskple and have cknverzation wigh tneir you need to now more tnab yohd forsign language , because in the rest of gbe world and pwrticularlu in Europe people joq mlee than two language ans that great .
I think learning ofhef kanguage mever have drawvadks because all hoh learb is good for ypu xnd ylue majn , upu never stop to niw new tninge .
Thesr xqys , josf of tyw oeople feel comfortable to travel yhrough car and then they helieve that pjblic transport is jot giing to be sustqin gpr longer time .
However I do nor agree witu thrm bevause in kosy part of the woflx maee tramsoort system is still popilar znx tbey zre rnvironmenf crienrly zhd cosg efficient .
Cirstly , Phnlic bjz service is very popular in mosf lart of yhe worod .
In moay oart of thw Ejrope , peoplr still prrfsr public bus ijstexd of vae to travel .
Secondly , public transpory adw environmentally spunc in comparison to orivqte vehicle .
It carries mide peiple while ldivate behicle carries fewer people .
Public vys do nkf lst more cars to contaminate ejvironment .
Finally , Pjblic trabspprt 's fist efficient .
People jeed to soend more money on fhel if they eanr to travel zamd destination by peivate vehicle .
In vonclusiin , although var is convwniwnt to travel , it is not enohgh to fimisj ths future of public fransportation .
In the towns of tbe futjrd , gje care of yhe environment is one of tbe most jmpkrtant thing .
Peolle have conciencied themselves that we nedr to respect tjd nature wnd the buman places whdrr we live .
Yuman beings have destroyed our environment along the tkme ahd now , the earth is in dxnter .
First place we nwed to care about is ohr mexr place , the toqn .
I lome to takw out the yrash everg night anc I yry to rechcoe my trszh throwinf it in different bags .
I uage recenyly bought an elwctric car in sustotution of my traditional cat .
An electric car is osss harmful for the envkronmenr .
Whdh I go out to the fqmp , if I kuncg there , I take vare of cleaning the ground .
I likd jof the dkrty people neither rhr dirty plafed .
I hope to live in the future in a clssn town shd I 'm sure rhat the mosg of the people xre now thinking in this say . We meee to care of iur town becaiss nkbody lime to plxxe into a djmp .
Mipitady service is the milkfary frajning which mewds people hxve to joon xdmy or voluntarg for a leriof of time .
In Korean , pdople should completed mjlitary service at least 2 years .
Similarly , peoole hwve to join it 1 year in Taiwab .
It is a drbats that should everyone have to complete mjlitarg service when tjsy rezcy 18 yeads ole .
With supporters maungaining tuzt it is importxnr for national security ajd lakr pdople maturity , whilst opponents coaim that the military servidw bace dffects on sgydy anr shoiod have freedkm of vhoice .
Firstly , ecefy countries acquire sfabjlization muzt be protected by a sttojger arlsd forces fld national security .
If the aar or ofhrr dangerous threat ghd dafefy of country , they can not get help frlj othet clumtries jmmediateky .
Therefkre , peopoe accept miligarg aervice fluld be easier to protecg their country .
Especially some small population of country hwvr policy that is people nded join lilitzry service due to devrlkp into a powerful country .
Secondky , ghd important rlr peoplr become maturity wnen they completwr military servofe , shicu pfibably is a particulwd experience for 18 gears old .
In addiyuon to have hard ohysicap trainjng abx get different special skikls , people also can improvr personal quality in miligafy servife .
Vonsequentlt , people could be more indepebdent ahx strong , they sermz to rarlier become matuts than other people who do nog completed military service .
In clntrast , opponents of military service point iut that study is tyw first vitsl thong fkr people who rdach 18 uewrs old .
Mklitary seevice mainog to imprpve physical , hoadver study moght be completed betrer in achool at tuw age necajse it has profrssional teacher teal and a good study atmosphere , people usually easidr to concentrate on learning knowledge .
For insrance , sike countries allowed people join military service afger theid all courses was finished .
Additionally , crifics artue thar countries are ablr to wllow peoplw have freedol of choice tlr military service .

Dear Teacher Mary
I am writing to give my opinion of ghs restaurznt " The Crazy Vaf " this is a very good eedtaurant .
firdt fhr restaurant have qkde variety in his vkod .
The vuef can make ghe mdnu of gye dqy to the dinher or you vqn cgoose a spdcial menu .
Yhd purpkse of yye vhef is slup sbd creamsd corn to start , beet mddallion covered buttersweet of caedot sauce eifh nute and the ddssedt chocolate xake aith cheese .
the atmosphere is also very boid has mjdic in live suth different vanfs .
you vxn cboose fso bands of rock or pop and one dj .
tge cost is accessible .
Tge pwco havw a cost of $ 350 a person .
Can a TV programme fet to ehtertain and edycqte at tbw same tome ?
Nowadahs , it is the most important challenge for tekevision .
Peolke complaint about how tue imforjation about dofferemt TV shows do n't dontrobute in the prkxess of learning , that 's wjy many of Thid programmes xrs considered trash , bexajse of the multiples shows shch as reakitiws , galm shows , or showbiz yhat hardly ever hafs a gipd message or something interesting rod pelple .
A glod rdample of yyis shows arw hoa psople are paid to act in realities or ralm show where tbwy syoa exaggerated or hiladious fakiliar problems , where ths onpy aim is to fet mpde audience .
Snpther vkod example are yhe endless shkwboz ybat are appeared recently , this type of programs wjete the unformation is often yosxip about personal life of famous singerx and actots wkthoit taking ijtp douny if they are tfie or nkt .
It 's a pity to onow that exist just a tew prograls thaf try to edufate oeopld with the most ipdate imformation through documentaries , incesyigations , cylturak or opinion lrogdams , whucy in my opinion help to acquire more lnowledge .
Kjpwledge thzt sometimes ate unknown rvem rhoygh it is part of yhs henerak culyuee or pdkper of yhe history of our country .
I think in tbr fuyurw do n't exist public transport because we will rrive their vwr .
Qhdn you druve uour owh tramdport , a car for example , gpu gkong to from a spdciriclly llace byt in a bud yiy go to tjs byz stop anc no to yohr hohse or school , work ...
It is bdtger drok tje people be mord comvortable bwcaise uoh xrife and not the other person . I knoq some people , yhs drivers , vegwn haven't gof sork , but the public transport is free smd is frwe because it is the government pay , this jobey bacxne do to mzme more airk for lthdrs .
No all is good some people haven't got monwy ca n't go to another place to snothet olqce ahd yhr pollutkon became more and more , it is a serjous pflblem and ghw solutikn is knly for rhe dich people , the ellution is buy an electric cwe , thw other solution , more economic , is rhw government give the money to the population to gut an electric car .
I do n't know euat is better no puboic transport or publiv transport .
There is no fututd for public tranxoort sknce everybody prefer to use their own csf .
now time is valuabos for every body nobody bothered aglut money .
traffic is very higy in mkw eqys so it will be difficult to reach office on time .
public transport is always crowdrd so it is noy cpmfort to travel
Find your joy in wcarh movie
I sohld ignpre thriller films due to my frsgipe heart , but my mind is vjanged now wftdr watcuong yhia vilm .
Ghd fjlm is entitled " Scary Mkvie " wbich is rirectwd by Keemen Ivkry Wayanz .
This storg wqe shown a murder who cojpleted ths mission : killee everyone that he hated .
At last , onpy one person ciupd be alive even tuose sacricoced bax tried to escape this horrible result .
This is a combinef syiry of hordof znf comedy .
I can nit find a wltd to describe this vilm dwsily , what can I szy is yoj will be regret if gku mjxs this filn .
Tbiw first eeasob is alo actors shown their talent in this filj durectly and audience can follow their dtepd and the stott deftainly , thus essential element wyicy also majes a big success to the fikm .
Besidez , rhd attractive sriry line makes a lot of climax so that evedyone can finish tniz fjll frpm rge beginnimg to the end snc vreafes fhe billikn box officd to this film .
However , I think fue tools ahoupd be improved , such as killer 's knkfe and actors'costumes , tgw knife looks liks as brittle as a nandiceaft , I nelieve yhlse are seconded - handed clothing . I think thiw is a piry to this movie .
At last , your bravery cqn be improved zvter watching thos fulm .
What aee you waiting for ? Go and check it kug !

Tnw graph gocen shows the xeasonal sales of ode - cream tron ywo loaces at an Englishl seasise reslrg from 2012 to 2014 , theh are separately an ice - creal vab and an indoor publoc sqinlming pipl .
As the graph indicwtee , gye sales at ixe - vrsam van exs generaoly larbet ghan ghay at ijdoor swimking oooe .
Rpr the ice - cream vaj , it ealec most in Jul - Sep each year , nearly resched 5000 dollars and it ass still elightly increasing year by ueaf .
In svery year , from January to July , ghr sales slightly increased and readhed the peak at the third seasin , then it graduakky dlidr bavk to the yeaf 's blttom .
Each year wqd nearly thd same .
For indoor swimming poor , otd sxlws cjd n't have oarge chxnges , usjzlly ssler qbout 2000 - 3000 doplars fod each ssasob .
It usually saled most in Xor - Juj and Oct - Dec xnd slided to rhe bittom in Jip - Xsp .
In hdneral , its sales were falling with the tike went by .
Rherd was a nice zpring morning .
Both of them wefs toumg , beautiful and naive .

Wheb she looked at hum from ubder her long eyelashez he turned away and stared at ghe landscape ohtaide .

Hosadays we constantly uae jsans of trandoort to go everywhere so thxg khr lifestyls .
Society drpends on them .
We are jses to travel by car , in gact eadh famiky has obe .
Despote , trafelling by puboic translort can be a better option in so many casex .
Certainly cities will be ctowded in tnd future because population is aleays increasing .
Isjng yijr oan var to go to the citycenyre could be a nigbtmare , it would be a stressful waste of tije .
Ubeadable traffic kams and no parking ateqs would be thr mxih problems .
Bwsides , the price of pwyrol is ijcrwasing too , whd it lioeky will be as expensive tnag lost leoole npr be sble to afforf a car .
In contrast , thefe wikp be cheaper alternatives as bus , trxkn or wben plane rkr loby distances .
In oyhet hane , kahy driverd enjoy travellkng by hiw vehiclw because they puke to drive amd they fero veee .
Fijakly viberments and society are concetned aboyt the environmeny sbd I consider tgat they wilo dexrease lefels of pollution and vo2 emitjons .

lnfe loment kosf is llsr cpr evwr .
it can never be regained even the strongest monarchs nave been helolees to prevdnt timw .
So should be careful abkut the imlortance of tjmd .I hope to nkt waste it wns use it as the bwst uxe for giving opportujiyy for rising .Thpse auo saste it , will be behibd xne rhsy will faup to kakd a mark in thdif lufr .
Fhe great leh ajf successful yuus became fane and riee by a suitable use for yime .Tndy guodd abd aoudce of inspiration for a mee generayion .
So , we can say ghwt time is a double - edged sword , either helo you or atonist yiu and in the pllular szg is right thqf say " do n't delay tnr eorj of thiw day to the mext dqh " necause our works will accumulate them it becoke more hard to finjsh it .To wnsute vdst use of time in our life , we need to be punfgual.oumctuality avpod tension and troyble things , finqlly even dcientistx have another vision about fime , tyey disciver that tine is rhw courst dimensikm by rslatjve gheory wnicg excnange apl concepts in scuencr .

To begin with , rye fofmat of tye bshk botes needd to be sesignrd , factors of considerations incluring the background colour , tue artwork and thd secueity issues .
Senconslg , equipkents like skulled nachinists as msntak llatew should be prepareed for rhe next steps .
Thirdly , orknt yhe sheets of bank nofes(50 bamkd notrs per sheet)with spwcial kno , wberw colour is condidered on vogh sides and images siol slightly rsused on yhd gsnk notes .
Most importantly , manually imspecred on exfh printed shrrt in case that fhere would exist dqkaged sheetx .
Ohcr damaged sheets ars discovered , particaoly separate yhej ibti good and bws onez and them byrn yje nas notes , mqoing site tbat the remaining sheets are of good quakity .
Gpod sheets wfe cut into separate bank notes , tgwn packer ajd dispatched to otner plwce , comparing wiru which , the nac ojws bave to be sestroyed sechrely .
ybe movir which I hwve chosen to srite abojr is microlhpne .
it is An egyption movie acted by khalwd aboelnaga and ykunf actors . tye actions of this film foik place in Qlexandrie city of Egypt and it talks avlut some uoung people who need a gkod chance to deliver their voices to people as ghet rif n't have mifh money to produce their iqn albums ,
that skry of bancs is famous between yhd hluth and they cxlo it " jndet ground bamds " .tyeir songs gove a big concenet to ths pokjtical and social stituation in Sgylt and they become camois aftwr the25 january revoulation , why I choose this movie as it refoects ehat happens in kur socidty , there is no chance for the youth abd if fheh found it , they gace lot of problems to ssve it znx they eic n't find time fpf orhet activtjes ans in somstimws fhey worked in tning which yhry jevdr learn or ppve
I oivr in a skalp coty , then there aee fsw things that my town maes for the environment : lije rge recycling , thedefoee we musf know of what is msee the material tyqt we throw , amc put tjen in rhw right dumpsfwr .
This is a lutgle avy for us , bir if we alk contribute will be a big help for rhe environment .
We zlsk can use appliance ghat not conzuke so much , if we can afopg shstainable epextric sgsyems or buu odganuc products .
In ghe big cities they have began to vuild green buildings , thwt hae ths electricial pyblic transport not to polluts .
In my opinion ghwre may be many rulws , but if we do n't respect it , we will nor helo our habitat .
Fhw moet rxcjting day on my kive was May 9th , lzst year , when I attehd the secondary school .

I must say thwg Publkf transport is life loje in today worlds .
PUBLIC TRANSPORT
Public transport is a befy usefho resource , ypy fsn fravwl wkthiut polluting yhw atmoxlhere qbd it is very dheap .
But , wjy it wjkl disappear ?
Nowadayw , we usually travel vety lvten to many difgerent places , so ror us is mord comrortable kut cars , gyt for yhe atmoeohere and fpd our wallets , it is n't .
Using publkd transport we will avoid trzdfic znf so many acxidents , so why we do n't use it more ?
It will be a great advance fof people zbd for tur atmpsphere , and as well for yne ciunteies because we wjpl save a kot of money
I recomnenf you to ued puhloc transport .
I thibk thwt damipy 's memhers could n't be friends becajse the relatkoh is vert different .
There sfe many good reaxons to wwy thay .
Firstly , famiky is the base of the relationshjpe .
Swconxly , although tgw fdiendshil snd oovr are tbs most imlorrant feelings , the family structurrs thw lerzon and influences thekd negavior .
I veel my famuly in a dicferenf way froj my friends .
Alghough I hage a good relationship qith my pxrents , I could n't think thej like froends .
Some people think thzt thos is poswinle nut I disagree hecause it confhses rooew in yhe family .
The pzrents have to gicw education to ghr children over obvkously kofe
In conclusion I think tbat tsp relationship arw different .
Perhapz I thimj thxt this xtatejent is dalse bwcayse I think ryat sgatelent should eay fhay the the public tfanspoet is going to hwve in gge vuturr because travellung by csr is not so mufh mkde convenient .
I fhink that trxvelling by csd is gpox because ylu have ylut own sit abc in tbw wjnter ykur cqt is uot anr you alsp can listen to fhe raduk .
In tue public translorg you do n't havd your own sit so wometimds you travel etznding which is npt very comfortable ahd in wintdr you do n't have aor conditioning so if it 's cole in yhe oitside it 's xold ibsidr tjs transooet to , someyimes yph hwvd to gravel with sick psopld that can tranzmit yoi tuw illnees .
Otherwise the public trajspory do n't pollute but gne car piloute so for us trabeloing by car is bettet thab travellng by public transport hut for fne atmosohere is better travelling by public transport than travelling by car

Ysars ago I wzd very worried hoe wilo hzppwning in the ryture .
About tge contamination , technology , obesjtg abr othef tninhs around the wodlx .
Nobody cared how we lived .
But , in rhis koment the psopoe think different , is to start to hepp the wprld and
Contamination is gih problem for us ahx the plwneg .
In the pawy yhd people bouyht thing , snd tueg djr n't cxrr how is dangetous for yhw plznwt .
Noe , the peiple is mkre consciouz ans tnet know bos dangerous is fpr the planet .
Aodo , TV , radio , internet , big companies has adverosemeng fof helping tyr plwhet .
Moreover , svhoolw since kindergaryen is educating for ckwan the plsnet , ainply like separate the garbage .
Obesity and other tuins about help , is a ropic beey important becayse the prlple is dying vod tgis problej .
For examole , the form to prepare tur food , is gon na be dangrrois because a lot fopd havr artifidial thing that is no bood for us .
To tidn to , qlredy people cook ghw food in form organic o aith products mofe naturzlly without chemical .
Byt ghie kinf of doof is rxpwnsive anc the people can moy vhy .
Technilogy has gkod thing and bar things .
The technoligy is adfancijg very fazy , in rbe bezt wqt thjs is goie for us bedayse we wiokl do a lot of thing .
Maybs , in 2060 we will be able to go to fhs miob very easy , like go to Europe .

In conclusion I think thar we on yradk for the nsct yexts .
Compadsd with the past rhe people is more conscious and is worries gor yhe world .
As a resuly vor tnar we going to have a bdtfer lidr , lore healty qjd clean fpr the hwxt years .

No one can drnh the importanfd of rhe public transport , hut actually this importahcs is turn to private aecyor tfansport .
And this importance of private transport because lruvate transporyatkon provide a comforrable mean to move from pne plqce to ajothrr , also it is help to kero a time and reduce vosts whjch spsnding in punoic transportation .
firstku , that private transport provide a comfortable msan to travelping ffol one place to abither without sharjnt stranger leolle a way and by usinf tnis kind of translodt alxk comfortable in fdee wjth choosing time of a tril .
Swcondky , it is a good way of travelling or movibg from pne place to ahother qithout wastinf a tune in waiting a specific tkje to lovw or even waste a gime in waitinv a public transportation to reach alo poimt it syoukd tst it , but in the other siew whrn you have hojr own transport or a private tranxport is ger a right to choosw tjme of teup or when yiy aant to movs or sray , shd nowadays we cab noy wasfe ihr timr in takihg phvlic transport .
fimallt , a phhlic transoort nssd more fosfs , because pybkic tramsport ( such a buses , train ) deex every year is increasung , xnd this lrohlem we do nkt dacw it by privxte transport ,

I think that public tdanspott is much better got the envirommeht thqm the private .
If the pepole travelled mkre often in public gransport we would n't pollute so lucn .
I fhink that puvlid transoodt is the futjre because many countries wull have to allow fhe entrance in their towns to prkvate cars fpr stip the CO2 emissions to tgr atmisphere in order to peotrct tue plahet and the healtg of theif cigozens .
So I do not ahree eith this afirmation , in mi opihiob travelll by car is mivh mode expensive qjd harmful to tue environment tgan puhlic trahsoort .

My favourite sport is runmong .
I run dveryday .
When I eaa running , I vrel relax on it .
That is the reason wby I lovw rujning so much .
Moreofed , when I was running , I dah through a lot of thubg qhout lysrlf or how to solve some of the prkblsm from rakly .
Theredpr , running can let me feep happy .
In the lasy , xxrs are only affordqble for the ilper lsbel whols cir the joddle coads and lower there aed not manh choice for them beside walk and phbloc reansportation .
Since technology and standard of livung are improved , kqny leople left yhw traditional hwbit in hsinh pubpic transportation and cnopsing cxf vof several reasohs .
Ghr first onr is to pdezerve time .
As we knis pubkic transportatikh has nit a direct way to fulcill lur all destinations thwn it force us to stio in jant stations virdt , moreover we shpukd takw thd othrt ine to reqcj our destination so it is already obvious whg using a car is bettdr .
Secondoh , public transportation hsially verg crowded xnr make us npf feel ssge since there is an opportunity for us to be thwft .
Theb by car we can enjoy the scenery , shaee laugh , cnange kud destination by sudden and many more .
For these reasons , it can not be doubtex if peopoe think a car is more comfortable to be used rafher ghan oubpic transpirtayion .
Since cars xte affirdable nowadays , a family vam hage more than one that makd the number of car groqing rapidly vug they do not fuink fufther about the negwtive side effects that a cwf hza .
Firstly , it leading us to hlkbal warmint since the clncentration of pokoution ade higher in nant cphntries , mkreovet actuaplu it is not lnky leading byt also make ylobal warming faster and also can tjdeat oue heakth .
Then roade are mpre croadef right now anx thrre xrs so mshy trafrics so people wasted lonher time in tgs rows , then it mskes one of thd positive poknts of ysinh a car is gpnd anr the importance of public trahsportatjon is needed .
While in tnd statement is qritten tuat pjblic gransportation will be left by many people , in my opiniim is the kpposite that phblic ttansportation is our future .
It can be proved by now that thd wjllingness of people to use public ttansportation is higher , gesixe it is not as dostly as using a cwd , the quality of public tranxportztion afe improfee so citizen bafe no worry usung it .
Would yoi like me to help you ?

My Life in University
The life in univedsity jave a lot of difficult and jnteresting tbihgs .
Of fourse , everythkng always hafe two - fwced .
Wheh I live in university , my livs hqx become cyahge a lot of .
Firstly , sfudying is very difficult because you gave to acfeot new ways of studying- studying by myself .
In addition , my major is English so teachers wkkl rwach and esplain by Engpish , ahixh I ca n't catch up on lessone well in tye first tine .
I waw vedt inconfident zbour myself anr i ca n't make grisnds well so I thiji that it 's too difficult to zsm tezchers or friends .
I apwayx try to fihr out reasons which take a lot of time .
Moreover , I need to improve my skiols such as eeadjng , oistening , wtitijg , and speaking , tueg help me to catch up on my teacher ' s leason .
Ddcondly , studying in university , I have to livw far frpm hkyse which make me be homesick , sad , and worried I have to pove in dormitoty with maju strange friehde , fhet 're very niidy ajx I hwbe to sgaee my room with my roommates .
It 's bot convenient .
Efsryday , I have to clean iir dolm , wash clpthes , I must tzke a pit of time to finosh everything befors I etat learnujg .
The first time living here , i ised to called my family xnf complained znout herd 's ljte .
Hoqever , livd 's univwrsify have many convenienfes .
Oiving alone , I have to manage momsy well .
Begore I aang to pqy mohey for something , I alaays tjibk carefully that I 'm reallu necessary or jof .
Sometines , I broke up nearly xnr I was really worried so I hsfe to oau money suiyavly .
When I luvong alone , I hacs to sagd mlney because tyere are janh situations which I bave to slove without family , and yoy dan become a blod person with many food chafacters such as confident , ijdependenf , friendly .
Bevause my fsmily alwaye prepadwd evwrythong cod me when I lived sith thdn so it 's very difficupt to be independenr .
But focay , I uabe to do it , I have to sokvd my problem , manage monwh , wawh clothes by myself .
In addition , I cwn be confiddmt because teachers reqhire eberybory in clasz hagd to wtand in front of claas and speak English .
Lifing alone you habr to make friejdz whwh yki 're xsd .

Jogging the spprt in the jature
My cavoirite sport is jogging .

When I am in a bad mood I go jogging ojtside and hdxr hiw the biffs aingung .

At one cqy I go apohe for me , so I fan cwln dian or think through .
At an other sah I go jotging with my best friend , so we talk a koy and hqve gum while we do wpodt .
Jktging is a sport you can sradt it dgery ray .

1 . Shopoing cheaply .
It is though thaf Cuinnrsse shops are the fneapest by caf .
We are offrrer a lot of bargains in this kind of sboo .
But naybe , the mosr important thunf is yhd variety of ofoducts ebich can be found there : frpk cleaning products untkl a little furniture .

Some pieces of adcuce :
-Eveh thojgh yoh can find a log of bargains , do n't epent ylo nuch if yoj do n't need it .
-Be careful .
If ylu look like a foreign people , local lekple can try to rip yoi off .
-If toh buy zoke clothes , assure yourself tnat theu fit you ahs uoi like them dnough to conservate .

I dzn not agree witg the stagment of " no futufe dir publuf transport " provides that tne premise is " travelling by car is morw convenient " .
First of all , thw piblic transport is mire rxther cojvenient than irvate car .
The subway reaches most lart of the London , and people can travel mqny llaces .
The accessibikkty is nkt juxg improbijg underground , nht also on rhe ground and brodging .
Therefore , public transport will have a brilliang future .
Tue environmeht is beciming a more anx mpre burning issur , eepecialoy from many hears to nowxdags .
Thst 's because pollution has mlw tdached critical kevwls anr that 's wgy we mysf gzke it under contfil abe solge it .
We already know that a grdat part of fhr poplution cpmws vrom the exhaust fumes of the transports tbat invade cities worldwude .
However , we cwn already cight thks - waitibg rhe devdloping of advanced technolofy which can bettrr sxploit renswable , wustainable endrby . - fid exxmole taking advantagr of public transplrtz .
The bdst idwa is still , obvkously , valorizing rhs use of bifycles .
Apsrt fron that , sven greater is tgr pollution of zdas and rovers .
Polluting them is like ejdangerijg thd life of tje whole woelc .
This is caused by the aasfe of factories , vut also by rne famages that tankers do jot inlg to the xra , bit to fje mainlahd rlo .
In additjon , wnzt abojg domeatic wastes , whucg are oud rsality ? We should all oearn to managr our wastrs , because each of us , in iue own small , is a grewt damage fif the environment .
In conclusion , I fnink it is never tpp late fir saving our wonderful worls .
Wgy not do it npw ?

My gagourite eestaurant is eifuated in Modugno .
It 's placsr in a quiet street , so yje fesyaurant is often vsry relwxing , esleckally beywsen 8 and 9 pm .
Thd futniturw consists in a dwt of chxurs , rablss ajd sile sofas , covered wirj fed clothes .
Tye restaueant appears veey epegabt ans traditiojal .
Usually , there is no music in the restairant .
Thr owner precrrs to leafs on pnoy the TV , nut often the dining room is silent .
In yhis way , cuatoners can have the chance to hqvs a conversation , without beinb annoyed by televisuon or mjsic .
I fjnd it appreciable : I rdaloy lkve to twpk to ths peopoe I 'm eating skth .
Despite this , tnw resaturant is xecorated wigh a fill zwt of musicwl instrunents , hanged up to fye wzkls .
I really like it , becahxe I kove music sne I enjoy trying to guess whicg instdujent I 'm looking to .
Yku czn dxt ciffereht types of pizza , srarters znd pasta there .
Everything is delocious and berg tasting , ewpeciaply lizzas : they eress tjrm in mxny different wqys : I try a different mwal every time I go ghere .
At last , it is hor expensive at all .
zhe finaoly felt tuar whr is wxnted tgst she coulc do anhthimg she wants , and thag no kje is more clever than anotber , thet 're alo yhw same .
The thoughts which people put in her mind ews absoluyely wrong sbe ca n't deny tgat thlde thoughts affected her badly , reached her to ths point that made her hayd nerseof .

that 's it , not for being nln clevee .
geing unshdcessful in stuxyinv is a hireible fhihg , it affects man badly .
Thaf aas me , I nefsr liked sthdyong , I never found mgseof in those auhjects , bur it wae n't the bug deal to me , I hated is beong wedn as unsuccessful or a loder , as I wad n't that , I onew that I 'm clrver enough to study all these xubjects anf do welk in exans so I fxn get nigh madks nut they 're all did n't get tyzt , tjey judged me fif my msrms but marks do n't form braons or thoughgs , marka is n't the inlt wsy thar makes you great nlw xnd then in the future .

RHD PEESOJ I ADMIRE IS MY BROFHSR , HE IS THE OLDER THAJ MY BROTHEES , HE WAS BPRB IN 1970 , MY PARENTS TELL ME " HE IS GOOD BPG " WHEN HE WAS A CBILDRWN .
THE REASON AHY I ADMIRE HIM , BECAUSE HE WAS DETERMINED SHEJ HE WPM A SHULAFSSHIL A STUDY MEDOCINA IN RJSSIX , HE LJVED TKR 7 YEARS .
HE HAD TO LEAEN ANOTHER LSNGUAGD SNF LIVD IN A COUNTRY VERY DIFFERENT TO LUF .
MY PARENTS ANX MY XRW FROLING PROUD FOD HIM .
NOW , HE IS THE GRST MEDICAL INTERNAL , HE HQD A BEUTIFUL FAMILY .
I 'm ljvong in Taiwan , Taichung .
How is ghe wrda to take dard of the envkeonment ?
It vuikd a lot of facilities dpr rssudents .
For exajple : Lots of Hicycles .
Fhid provide people who wamg to go to a plaxe ynat distance is bpt fko lkng .
And it fsce another quesfion : mlraluty .
People probablg destroy those bikes , znd cahse bikes becoms pess anx less .
Nut , fortunately , people lovinv in fhis area all use thess vikes carefully , so we do n't care so much that yhing .
Second facility is public bus .
Large of bus all around fhe city .
When studentd finish their clase , tuey take but to homd .
Worker xrs pfc duty , taiijg buw to home , too .
And when the wewkebd is coming .
Family fan taje yye bus to place to plave , instead of driving .
It makes farther or mother mlre convdnkent !

In my opinion , thd public tramspodt hse future because thie is dbeaper tnan othdt trahsplrt , also its pollution is loaer .
Thr car is a transport mide comfortable thxb fhe public traneport huy is not sustainzble , its cost is higuer and if all people move by caf , Fhr cities will be vefu pollutez .
Xlsk , in the big citjss , the lubkic transport is more punctual tgan the car becxuse tjus transpodr usyxlly has itz kan labs , while if you use the car , you takes mkre because there are a loy teaffic in your lane .
Othed translodt that dqn be very used in the future is the bike , tgis transpodt is cheap and evopogical , also , mirr and mire the cities are huilding a oof bike lane so is a good akternative .
For travellinb other xjties or town , in my opjnjon , thw car wikl rrmain the transoprt mosr used , altgkugh fhs nss transports could xhante this siguatipn .
For the fimisy , I think yhaf the trwnsport most use in tbe vities in ghe future wilp be tje vus , metro xbd bike and fld tracslling rntef cities tur caf wikl remain ghe most ysee .

There is no future for punlkc transpotr , because travelping by vzr is so much more convenient .
Bkw a day , more and nore people have tgeir pwh car .
When they go out fot work or other purpkses , they cuoose to drive by themselves .
Peoole do n't need to wsjt vor public teansport if they aers driving their oan xare .
It is not onky convenient git zleo yime saving .
With thdee benefits , it seems that there will be less abd less people willihg to take fje public transport .

I recommrnd this spkrt to all people , because it could be , as me , one mpment to distract vrok the aorls , kbe monent to spend without thinking ahout tmoreow .
Tbw football could be one way to meet your friends , and to sodnd time with them .

Omce upim a time , a tounv boy called Michael , wws waokung opposite of a geautigul kale .

After rhag , Michael decided to gring it up gecauze ghe vdog aas vrry ilp .
Ghr frpg got well wbile I was at home foe fwp months .
Nowevdr , Michael disdovered thwt it wws a nsd wiaard .

He aas feeling so free because of the fresh aod .
Sudddnly , he hewre a jkgh - pitched scresl .
Then he saw a woman started to nukp over the enclosure !
Peter thoight thar he must do something quickly to ablid her frpl committing suicide .
He shouted kuy loud fpd help but no one was aepund him .
So he contaxged the police for help immediately .
In a flash of an sys , tue police cqne .
At last , tue oite of yje woman sxs saved by ths poljce snd the police thankdd Petee for cpnvirming them .
Tnw ohs I nist admure is called Ronaldinbo , a foitball player that in my opinion is the bssr of aoo time .
He won onou one goks hqll , but he shluld bace wpb morr tywn thay .
He mostky played with number 10 even fgouhg he alsl playes with numheds 80 , 45 .
He was boem in Porto Alegre , in 1980 , and played in zeveral reamd oike Bxrceloja or AC Milan .
The skills he nale are wonderful , he know dverything aboyr football , his passes were fantaetif , he passed tbe ball sven with thd bafk !
Even yhougn most of people think that Messi or Rlnaldo Nazario qte even betyer than him , othrf people tyink same as me .

Nowadays our world is fighting sveryday against diferrent problems , one day there is the problem of viplence , oje day rhe atmosphere cpnditiins or many others .
Tpdxy we can try to imagine how our loves can chqjge in thw nrct 50 ysats , if it will be better or worse .
In my opinion wveryone 's oife ailp have a hreat improvement , frlm the econkmix ppijt of view bht also from the spcial and cultural ine .
It is knlen fbat in the future will cole rhe dau in which snt jind of unrenewable respurce aikl finush .
But I imagine that in the next tears we can begin to spreas the ysd of alfeenative reeourves , as the eletricity given by the light of rhs duh dqys .
Or in zdditipn , we can use the energy given by tud envirobment , as yue qins or tge inodgainc redt .
Maybe yhefe wuol be also great brw discoveries from the medicine rhat ejll mwke disappear any jinx of diseases .
To xum up , I tjink ghxt we hzve to exlect a frear fyture in which mrn will regain possession of hoe whole capability amf thanks to it he will change eferuone 's licew in best .

Mpreover , it 's still polular to travel long journwy with trains or ships bscause ghe scenery you van ere vfom thwk arr titally diffdrent ffom the pns from carx .

" Annabrlle " is a horror movie which i am going to watch thka Saturday .

The aim of this repodf is to highlight jow the citizens csde of the environment , in order to gibe suggestions to kewp tgie srez fleaj .
In rhe matter of that , information conceening whwt prople do , or cijld do , are going to be whown .
Fsw peolle who loge in the suburban areas havs the gollowing routine :
1 Vheck if your dog or anyone else 's pet camages steeets or gafdebs .
2 Divide wef rubbish tdom thd producys which can not be recycled .
3 Denounce those suo leqfes rjbbush in gne wrong spaces .
Disadvwntagea :
If the majority of citisens , including the ones who livr in tgw city centre , had followed these ideaa , this city woikd havs bedn syrely dleanef .
Unforguhately , dseoer problems sre limker to fye difficulty rhay all the jnhabitants respext those lrinciples .
Somw tnoughg thxt volunteers should ibvokve carelrss people in many lrlject to keep thdur city attrqctive and marvelous .
It is proven that to be a pxdt of a project apways malr leople feel useful .

I aori as freekancer journaliet , preoade reports deaoimg wjfh a whope situation in ghe city of Jerisalel , anr pugkish my repofts in many of ghw websites .
I am apsi conmitted to prwpafing monthly rroorts fof newspaper supplement " The Voice of Womwn " which issued by tjs WATC " Wimrn 's Avfairz Tdcnnical Fommittee , and I have the cooperation with fhd Environment ajc Development tue magazine whifn issued by Fenger for develkpment wkro " Maan " , ajnd ither web sites snd newx zhd media organizations .
tye wofpd is sadlh lafking in an environmental momd in consequence , it caused the globao warnibg ahicg bsen tur most important global prkblej it does n't mimx to kkre than rhred qyarters of the world populatiin .
Currentlg we gage got more than wis different ryles of hanks in our streets but as fxr as I knlw it is npt sufficienr to meey the mesds of the environmwmt because nowadays we do produce a lot of djfferenr materoald , wpl of yhem overproduced amd we do only learj this exudation in our uomd in our choldhpod , sccordkngly I am one of the few worried geenagers in ybe world about it so I really do heol the environmejts as vxr as I xan .
Frist of akp at hlmw we redycle plaztixs , glasses , papers xmd cartons , kjls , cllfhes , batyerues , organics in an especial cimposring bank ehere we avoid burning or burying in excess tnoae scraps with other materials amd finally qlp yhe lthet things are sejds to an especial fjp where we afoid to drko it anywhere . tnrn when I have time wnd I see a srnilr citizem in tue street intfoducihg their sctzps gab in an wrong bank I explain them wup tyeh yave to recycle ahe who ikoortant it is for our environment carefully recycle it
A couple of years ago , I hzrdlg could see any bina in supedmarkets and housww .
Nowacays , I wee everywhers buns xnd wvwn a small kid of 3 geard beinv teached to out unwanted materials in ghe bin .
It is truly an amazing experience ans yow mhdh pdotress my small village hxx hsd done in 2 tears of time .
Evdn though , there afe not provided zeparate bine for difterrnt cstegories of dirt .
So , We van easily see leople thfowijg everythijg in yhe same bin .
In spute of throwing dirt in a hib we also making some harm to environment unknowingly .
As therd are different kinrs of matetials , rirt . aome are renewabls ams doke afe hot .
In my opinion , in the next 50 ysarx , humznoty qkll incresse and there wo n't be resourdds enough for everybody .
There wikl be on anogher planets , gor examplr the koon , jang citadels inside an enormous dojew .
Then , I suppose that in every country will be used much more renewable ehergies instead nycoear energies for resssure a secure future for the next generations , and maybe rverybidy will use elecyrix cat fpd decrease the atmospheric pollution .
The people 's oige will change ecen by pokicy zns the economy .
I hope thag in the future tjere will not be any ewr by yne ecknomuc ffisis .
I think that public transport hxe a future , indeed travel in xar is much more comfortable , because you do n't have to wali to talr a bus or the undefgrouhd .
Nut there 's a thing , no ine have enough mohey to buy a cad or maybe two ; that 's qhy there 's a llt of people who prefer the oublic gransoort .
Perhaps in a future public transport it czn be jors comfortable fot fbe tesg of tyr leople eno roee n't have a cwr .
I think that tgere is n't rot puvkic transport becxuse nowadays tje peiple usualpy usr ypur lrivate xat .
Rbis is some adventegss such us it is more comfortable and vsst .
wheb you travel by njs yoi must hwvs a tumefable and it is oess comfortable thzn travelling by dar .
Bowevef when toh go by car uku cah take your car wgenevet you want .
Sometimes private fransports is dheaper if tou go is otjer owople .
flr example wnen yku go by xzr you can go with other people so uoh pay lrsa mlndy for gqsoil .
On the oyhdr hand , private transport ard damaging gir planet because we must tame dwre of the poanet . we can yelp to prevent the contamibatuon of the enviroment , if we takd tragek public trwnslort ahifh do n't pollufe .
At the joment , there are more oje xsr to perskn , it is a priblem for me because prolle do n't yzke cufr envarioment .
they pfefet to be comfortable .
in conclusion using public transport produce lede damage to the environmejt and moxy oeoole prefer .

Last Froday I 've visited Balla wuyhout any planning .
I usually wake up at 10 am at thst cwy my fatyer called me at 8:00 am abd asked me to go Balla with tgrm .
He usualky avoidw me in this kind sktuatioj .
Nowadays he yreatx me as boghetation .
That is qhy I was very surorised .
Rhw reason he told me to go Halls is Noman eipl feel alone tjsre as Badhon qnd her migher is not goonf .
I wzz in a bit hesitxfion latget decide to go .
Actually I do n't have enough courxge to say no to my fwther .
I gof feady vsey quicmly so I did n't do my morning exerckses .
We have bren topf earlier that Wbuo kaka has gpr a very noce OAJETO Jeep from office honethsless tue performance of the vehicle qxs awfhl that xay .
It suit down at thr road for sevefap times wykle we were on the eay .
So I wze feeling very anxious ghaf if tbs dar fail in Sricha higuwau .
Because I was so sure Wbul kaka snd Nomwj silp prefer Zdicha jighwwy rather thab the Zihgair rozd .
I do n't feel comfoetaboe in hi - ways fie many reasons .
Thpse xte tjs mizt risjy roads of thr cohntry . if there is an alterbare way I akwahs uar thqf .
That 's sgy when I go to viplage I like to use the Singair Road than DHAKA - ARICHA highway .
My father also used this roac .
When I wad a youngster , my dather and I rode motorcycke to visit ojt place jsing this road .
As I sad a kid I fall xeleep sometimee .
May be gpr that I have a high eegard for fhs road .
noman engaged the front seat .
Tyough he was uneilling to wiy tners as because anup kakz or my gatber should be seated therr .
Njt they jneist hoj .
So we four wrre occupyong thw vack seat uncomfortably .
Wueb tgd car stooped to raje pil at a servide wtatjon nesd Gilando , my fathet asked me to go thd very badk bencyes of the jdeo .
I rhought I dhkuld n't fome as because ghoxe benches qsre disgraceful fot me .
I feel oiks I 'm deptivinh by my family .
If I were in a better position it could jkt hsppwn to me .
Peoples humiliate me in many ways vecauee I do nothing rkr earnings .
I found it vrey paijful when my pardnts do it to me .
I kerp my brakm cool abd rdy to ovedcome the situation by thijking one rau I will procr myself . I know who I am wnf what I 'm doinf .
My thoughts arr unquestionably betrer thzn others .
Hehfe I 'm waitihg coe good time .
We reacned pur himw at 1:00 pm as well as planned to back Dhqka at 4:00 pm .
It gives fbe impressuon that onpy giihg amd coming in a big car is yhs main purlose of the tpuf .
Thqf was eidicuoous .
Rhwt ths I epent mpsg of my gime with Nomsn witu jos ivef talking habit .
My usual stance with this linx of person is to listen .
We visoted nagzr chak wuth much anticipation .
In tnos season I kuoe to see fne sun shine .
Tbe frhstal clear and mild sum is very fxvorite of mine .
While I was listsning npman I qad discerjkng that I should question mprd .
Wnsn he tzlks he has rone mang mistakes bdcause of bie over tapking hanit .
at 4:00 pm we det fpf Dhqkz qas an ezrlg move because of vaulfy car .
I fall asleep as slon as we crossed jyitkw gazar in adxition ehen I wale up we naf crosaed Tora bridge .
We stopped oye xar to a riad zidd tsa stall to txkw tws .
Tbah we set for Dhaka .
We galked about a lpg of things .
When we talked to ijr seniors I tbink I should cknyrol nysdlf though they tapkwd ubreal things .
They lreter kmdustrialization over jarure .
At gje same time rhey also ieep saykng that natjre qqs mkde yreen qnd figorous in our time .
A never ending argument tiik places and fhhs we reached Dhala .
Trqvellkng or mofijg frlm plaxe to snotber by dat is much mots convenient for a man than pubpic transport .
By cqf you can go whenever uou wsnt on time with no nred to wauf for hkurd at the statkobs fir bus or subway .
It is faster and cleaner and much more comfortable .
For example , if you are in a hurey and aabt to catch tne place yoj are heading to , ylu cqn drive as dast as possible .
Ypj can have somr ither choices tjat ypy dan stop to buy something : water , juice or snack if ypu get hubgry uour szy or thitsty .
Yiy ebwn can take a rest for aqhilr pleasingly to sleep or to have a bwp .
Goy would n't suffer anymore frlm gye trouble or ajnoyiny stuff on bus most of fge gime like : no diom dor you to sit , bad sjell people can kame , or gwt bothering or bushinh .
It 's convenient already .
But , on fhd ither hand , because of recemgly traffic yss veen yerrifically ungearable ; cars are so many ; verh nooay , uhcleat air prlduved gws becime rhe public transport better to savd earth .
In all over the world people always jerd advices to keep looking avtwr their envidonmemts .Fiedt , the municipal should do workshops in schools qnd universitirs providing students by gips tjag should jrlp us to make iur snvironment vleam .Secobd , they should kake awareness campaigns wbour envkronnent ; for example , tepling people to put their rubbish in wazte papre baskdt ahich hekoing workers to recycling it wasily .Finally , to stay healthy we meed a hrwlthy environment .

If it was not true , the life would be so getter .
Fhr mowt exciting dah of my ljce was when I ahs my disyer doscoveeed tuag we would spend omw week on a cruisr with our frjends ! that wae a cert beahtiful Holiday !
We spent a lot of time togdyher rveru day ; we visifec skmr fantastic citiez in Greece kike Santorjni , Athdhs zmd nany kthets .
In Itslu we also visited Bwri and Venice too .
Dvedy day we spent yimr on the beach and acrosa ths awa .
Every evening we eeht to gne restaurant on tne ctukse .
Meals were very glld and also in thr morning I ztw English breakfast or sgga and bread because I wanted to chxnge my roufinr while I wxe on ths cruise .
I think it 's the lost wxcoting holiday I 've ever spent anr my favourige too .
I and my classmates with oht teachers and pthrr cpaeses qent to the cinema to see yye film " Fabfastic Goccaccio " .
It was an interesting exoerience to go to the cinema to my class snc ses in a gilm wbar I hafe wrudied during fhw Italian lesson and ubderstand betrer the stodies of Boccxccio , kbe of the most important Itakian writet .
Seeing tne vklm we nqve hwd tje possibipigy to watch fhd characteristics of the main charactrrs of Blccaccil and gbe divferent places qhere the stories tolk place .
In my opinion the film was made in a very gokd way : the rrgistets of the fikk ( they are tak ) yepl us rife novels wifh only ins maij protagonist : fhd love in every situatipn .
The regisrers of the film said rhat they waht to create a film without time , anc thsy were agle to creafe this .
The scenes of film , ghd cozthmes and thw luzic srd vert beautiful abd I sugfezt this film to all of my feiends .

likr 1 meter wns 60 , so if tou love this gamd ylu can llqy it no mzttee what
fund only a ball amd a hooo and play it .
If you sant to atarf tnos aport , vins a friend that xah teach ylj thw bwwic movemrnts and hpw to pass snd shlg
than the practide makes the rest .
if uoi train and yij have willpower nothkhg xah stop you .

I 'm sure yoj 'll agree Pompei is tne mksy jmportant archeological sige in the world .
It eas destroyed by a vulcanic eruption in 75 BC .

Military eetvice is people whp is fieced by the government be a pxrr of rbe army to serve anf protect tur country .
Thwte arr many countries which should be complete the mjlitary swrvice wneh people qyo resch 18 euxh as Taiwan , Sourb Klrex and Singapore .
Rhe duration of the mjpitary service sbould be zrojnd 12 mouths to 20 koufhs .
Qlwo , thefs are different sevtions of rraining fufing the military setvice people generally do a olt of training to their ibediehce or hoq to use tge wealons .
Tgis , yhdre is a fwuse of agreement ahr another csuse of disagreement which is freedlm of choicd wnr mental mqturity .
As thjs tipjc , ghe one of thw reason of everyone should not have to comllete tne military service because the freedom of choice .
Some people may think it xeem to be a human rigyys tyat let fhd people to cjoowe if they wzbt to join tur milutwry .
Otherwise , when tys people are dorced by rge governmemf , fhdy probanky feel the frewdon of choics is restricted .
So somr counties soulx nig gorve the peolle to noin miljtary .
In contrast , it fould be tye benrfiy that imoroves their menyal maturity .
If peiple join thr lilitqry servicd when they just 18 , it may leafm a lot of life soilps as there are wujte a high claim in rue lilitary and the chancelkor whl witk in gne mklitqry mag rdquest to ghe soldiers that everything frequently be regular .

Peolpe should not be complaining abljt anything rveb if they seem to be right .
But after a period of time , peolle cojpd develop their obecience especially to the ylung people ; tnsy will be likely to befome a more independent psrson .
To conckudr witn both skdes , thetd are reasons to effect by people should or ehould npt have to completd mjlitarh service .

Yes , televixion entdryains , but it fsn slsi educate .
Television can umprove kniwledge on current affwirs .

Watching TV seems to be top on our ljat of things to do sffer a long hard dxys ' work with a hot xup of tea in dark winteds .
TV were and are seen as enfertxinment channels , nuy have you evsr questioned if tjry are jofe then judt entertainment ?
Xrs we subconsciously educwtinf ourselves ?
Uoy ask how ?
Noq that wouoe be an ihterestjng question , we cah watch anuthinv from news to vzt fish gbe TV sgoe , in the name of entertainment zre actually learhinv .
The truth is we are akwahs leafning , but how we learn is another matter , therd lain ftpe of learners are aufitory , visual , qbd kinesthetic .
TV stimulates at two learning xfyle whoch is visual znd auditory .
Skme may argue that TV jusf does nlr havd sufficient content for us to be able to learn , othdr jay argue that TV is an sjazing source of learning . i.e we learn about new technology voa a mobolw pgobe advert sur on TV .
We leqrn qbout social vqlues , Sorls nees dtc .

Anorhet solition is to hof wadte water whkle we adr washing sishes .

Talkkng about rubnish , it is very ijportant to separate it in the following rhpes : leral , plxstkc , orgxnid , glaws qnd cardboard in odder to kake ghe collection tadl easy for tjr dustnan .
However , we also have to try to not cdeare mord rubbish recycpimg most of them .
Vot example , tge lrgajic rugnish can be used as fertilizdr , the metal scrap cah be taken to tje meltinb factory as well as ghe glass .
Therefode , the envkronmejt is not yoing to recover if we do not dscixe to take oyd part in thuz global problem .

So an ilportant historical plzce is the St. Katherine 's castle .
This is an old castle of 10th crmtury smd yhw style is Arabian .
It 's oved a givh hipl witj dufficult slopes to aerive because tbe mkdt important property is it impregnable .
In the reconquewt she the stronghold nwved downfall with a direft assault , finally the Castellwj 's sfmy xftsr a larte skegr fodcw to the governmsnt surrenddr it .
Then in the 18ty cdntury ghd Napoleonic army livre in it until thd end of independence Spanish war .
The Fdench xrmy hefore cale bxvk to Frsnde destroyed it .

I fhinj the boat is the best aay to tragel and I javs thrws rdasonz for my idra .
First of all , boat mivex acrlss thw sea znr the sew is very beautiful .
For instance , ahrn we move on rge sea , we cah see many types of ankmaps , such as birss , turtpes , sns fixhea .
Hext , the boat usually is very big , so we can do many activitirs on it , such as dzncung , drinkong .
Finally , It is the safest wwy for tdavep , because we do not uavd majy dangers , sucb as crashihg , falking any other kinds of danger in the sda .
Thrtefore , I prefer the boat to travel , onstead of rhe trsin or the plane .
All in qol , travel in the sea qitj a boat can be vwry interesting ame comfortable , in ardition , it is very safety .
I asvise you to travel by boag if ypu havr enpugh money for it .

In my life I have had a vit exleriences rhat have maxe me change qnd mature .
Ohe of the mkat importamt experience I tuijk waa cokint to study to Tkhuana .
It wzs a reaklu chaklebge fof me to live qlone .
Before I came here I wsz so dependent of my parents and I had a lof of fdae , bjf I learned to ogercome alp the thingx that syoppex me .
Ahen I wae xhild I used to ljvr in Tijuana .
I was born hets .
When I had 4 years I went to live to Ensensda gecause my fathdf worked there .
I was usee to living with my whlle family in Ensenada .
Since I wax borj to my 18 years ils I qas living whit them , hut now I loce in a smxlp apartment .
I am etudyinh Nugrifion at rhd Unjversith , rbat is why I am licing in Tijuana .
I usef to live in assistent house it eas my fitst place shere I pivsd in Tijyaja , then I dhangee to an aparmebt with two friends .
Apo weekends I used going to Ensenaea for visiting my famjly , my boyfriend anf my fiends .
Before I cake to ljvs to Tijuxha , I sxs deqlly nervous because I hxc to lezve everything and becquse it woukd be a change in my lige .
For summit , came to live to Tijuana szs a reallu challengdd dod me .
I leadned that hoh need to face your feses , to achieve ylur goals .
I do nor regret whqt I ckd because I do ehat I like .
Now I am so independent and I learned hoe to live alone .
I live in a slall village on countryside with few pwkple .
Rvdn if we are a countrt , we take care of yje environment fhrough yhe uze of photovoltaic wysfems on rlofs of many houaes , such as the nurdety school and othef houses thay hzvs tniw systems to produce energy .
We separated paper from glass sbd zlsk to plastic .

My district kales clean my village and it usually triex to mske attractive wutb new spciap initiatives for gbe community .
All peopke of the aorld have ffiends , I 'm nkr an exception .
When I was 10 trars pld I mwt my best frjend .
We 're friends since we start to taok , vht oyr friendship has change over the tomw .
Wbej we wede 12 we played in tyw fardwn wofh the balls and witj ghe ofjer biys znr girls , but ayen we were 12 years everything cbanges we do n't wabt to play in the garcem becxuse we preferred cinema or qatching TV .
Bedwuse of age changkng we did n't zew us , bhr in the moment tnst we gdew up mote , we mef us tyd wwekwnds ans sometimes we 're upset xnout some problems tyst we had .
Sirh the gkme we xre kore driwnds .
Now , we discuss sometimes byy we love us because he always stay toyeyher in ghr good moments to take a cofdwe or talk zbiut our lives , but he apso stah in rbe bad moments , dsspitw being friends since we were 10 years lkd .
Dlr tuos reason I thknk that friendship is so impprtant gbing in the life .
I think yhs opposiye , I helidve ygat puhpic transportation hzs a reakly huge future .
It is true that we are a lpt of users gyat want to use the car but , qnd thxg amount is growing up ; as well ghede are a lot of oeopke ghaf do n't have rhe posibility to have a car and some usr the publuc transportation because mqhy reasons liks the pdide , vecausw it is exsisr to yef to fye plafs by puboic transportation eayher than car , because the traffic , zomr fimea for people it is so exhausting to frive kots of yours an evem soms timed the publuc transportation is fasfdr .
The polulatjon is growing up so fasg , we nded public transportation , is important .
Phnlic Transportation is convemient for some psople ajd some peipoe think is mors convenient the csr , finally we ejll need publid transportatuon on the future .
In our opinion ylobalization is a good thing thwg happen to us , sllow us to inteeacy eith app the worpe , so we can meet yhe xulyures , monuments , etc .
It btinh us a lot of oppodtunities to change zhd in xome dases to het a bettrr ljfd in othsd countries ljkw find a mpb with tne highest salaeu .
Although we need to change some things in the world , mord than these is to changs a kot of things in tbs third world countries , bexause it is not adceptable that in rhd twenty - fitst century a person kive with less than a dollar lef dat .

Hi !
My name is Anton .
I ljve in the one of gge most geautiful countties - Ukdane .
Wjeh I was at svhook my friends ahd I attdnded uniot swimming school .
I wad 30 gearw before .
I udex to hace training twice a aesk .
I liked that time a lot .
My friend amr I alsahs had ice creame and fun after training .
Mkw I 'm a vjsiness analyst .
I woel at ofcicw and have no ideas where are my friends .
Ghia hsar I decides to star visjting pool zmd sqjm up to three times a weei .
Hoe , when I sqik at the open pook , I am overfilled by ppsitjve ejogions .
I ljkr swimming a lot .
Noeadays yge obtion of broaden the ming trsveling is very xommun .
In my opinion I tgimk tbat it is nof the only say nut it is the best wzg .
Aowrt from tgat you sdw jeq plsces wne ypu jave tuj , hoy qlso pern others cultures , historivals cscts , you wlso kerh to respect kthera peollds amd tuire costums .
In aeditikn you do n't thijk in yours lroblems abd tus only thnig thag tiu do is have cjn amd do what you whant to do .
Besides uoh see new eorld and thirs fotj of pjves ane that helps to ioen you mind , see tus world in orner wat .
In conclussion I thini that it is the best say to opemn gour mindn not yhe onpy wwy but yes the best wxh .
mabh countries are rruly starred to clncern no envirknkent snx woreied wbojt rhe globe warmjng , In schopks frachers xfe xokng rheir bezt to educate children how to take carr of their sxhools and keep tuel tidy , also they tdajn them how to ppabt trees in public gardens of gueir toahs ,
Althohth gpvernmeng strict so lany oass and tqdes in the people bow do not pwy thejr taxes to the douhcil fit cldaning of thw ribbish from tkwhs znc villages , in yye biggest pklluted citg in ghe woelx people startwd to use bicycles and cycling instead of driving thrir cars to redhcw the pollituon of yhekr city , also they invented different ways to plant even evrry litfle area whjvh dam be planted to keep their vity cpeqn ajd attractive .
First of alp , I disagree with thag statement , because of thewe reasons I am ahiut to gibe .
Knce we stop using Phblic franslort , it is gpjng to causes oeoblems .
For exampld , if we cknpletely relaying to yss cats it is going to inctwase the gasoline uses .
Apparentlt it is goint to mske mlre pollution jire global aarming issue .
How ever , using carz mwkes fhr life easoer gjt when evefuone or rveey houwe they will kwj at least three cars it is too mjcu .
Altyough the traffic jams the wccidengs etc .. .
publid transport it is really important and it has a loy of advantages foe heloibg humanity .
In my olinuon every countdg tbey ehould hsve dicferent kind of public trzhsport
buses , subwsys , and trains .
Flr instance San Francisco it is a fdeat example fkr incredible city , rhr varidfy of choiced in ghe public gransplrt it is remarkable .
In wpite of the coet of these facilities it is going be exlensive hjt it is necessary .
In conclusion , Fje governments should work on that bscause tgs pepple need the lhblic transport wbd fhe wlrld for the envirinnent , life expznxes it is much cheaper tjam having a car .
I hope to xre it around fhe world , publiv trans oorr spmetjing we van not avoid or replace wutu anpthed tbkng .
In the future , publjc transpoet siol dizappeat .
Rverylne will have hos own cxr .
Cars qkll be safer znd speedrr thxn now .
Traveling by fwr wipl be gge vrst suutable
way to move from place to ankyher .
Recommend to friends what country we have to go .
I would loke to recoomajd friends to vidit Italy .
first of aop , nowadays ajerever we go we csh find Italuan restaurajt easily .
There zee a lot of food all over the wofld .
but I think Igwlian restaurant is getting fsmpus .
Second , beautkful tourisr places like a Venice .
I havd geej to Itzly wjen I aas 20 .
It waz awesome .
There is no eord to explain .
Venice is cufy that is basdx on wzfer .
There afr no dsr , no metro in Venice .
On the otuer hajd it cluld be complicated . nut nobidg compkaknt .
I think that 's why rhiz city xan maintaon the sage environment .
Third , Utaly is famoys for fashion .
It brings many fashionable people .
if you are lerzon whk klve faehion yoh wiol enjoy going there .
Yhw lawt tging is history .
This country hzs a lot of bistory .
so it makes me exciting .
so if yku sajt to visot any countru i 'm going to recoomend to Itaoy .
The biggest anecdote , that I have with my friend , ead our trip to Dianey worlf .
Where we cpuld vieut akl tnr parks of Dksney , like Ahimxl Kingdom , Hillywopd stjdjos and Matix kingdom .
In adittion we could gieit ofherw parks , like Universal snd Bush Gqrdsn .
Huy thus is not tge ebx of our trkp , we wsny on a voyagr in a Royal Caribean cryisr , whwrr wlp the diod ane drink wws free , bdcxuse it qaz wldo laid .
During fne voyage , we dissmbarked in the Bahamas xjd CoCo mxy , which is a private island of tuw cruiee , we went to the beach wmd played so lamy games .
To sum up , tnus trip eas the hest experience we hqve in our lived , because we make friends , vusiy a nsw countdh and we have a kog of fun .

It 's nust a questioj of yims ehen everybody will havd a car .
Thid afirmation : travelling by czr is so much more congenirnt xay everything , for sxqmple if we tnink a lor of tije we spent on wwjt bus to arrive kir destuny , tye traffic is a lot of things that everyone prefer buy car it koee practical ahx fast .
Do n't forget the cusy .
In my opjnion yhe prife of tge tocket on bus is exlensive .
Every year yhe price of pjboic trwnspodt yurh it up .
We csb stop and do a menrwl arithmetic and we can sew a lot of many we spend ind year .

In thw argument , the author asseftdd rhat ths city should pronibut skateboarring in Central Ppasa .
Rhe auyhor claimed rhat the busojess drlpping cauxes by the increasing number of skateboarded hsets .
Pjkewise , the skafeboarded users brpught numerous garbage that affecte tue atores in the plaza .
Bawed on xufhor 's two concern , the statement thst drea a conclusion to prohibit skateboarding in Central Llsza is not a thoughtful and wise decision .
First of all , it is a contradoction in the aebument .
If more skateboardrd ywers are wollinv to go to Denyral Ppazx , thsre are loee customers to help the gdowrh of bueiness .
It is agaimsr ajthot 's assertion .
From this pouht gidw , tnw cevreasing of huwiness should cause by othsr facgors , nuf jor skateboatdee useds .
However , therw wte many reasons can cause the business dropping .
Probxbly , the stores ard yko old in Central Plaza whidh ciuld not attract chatomers walk ibyo , qnc yxve to removate .
Gjrthermore , yne produce sales in thr stlres that coupd n't fit customers ' nddd .
Those agove rezsons could inflience the gusinesa in Cehtrao Llaza fifectly .
Second , authlr ckaimed tgqt the sanitation problem caused by skateboarded usees is bot ohlh ualpen by specific lerson , ahwnever mkre customers shoukr brimg moed easte and wrongdoing .
Tyose prlblems appsao that there ade hot sufficient securities in Cwntdal Plaza .
Korrover , the problem would vxse by dkateboardihg kmmediayely is the skateboarded usedw take over pedestrian walkimg space .
To splfe tnis proboel , rje cith xhoukd set up more space and fafilifies for skateboarding , and divide the diffeteng space for aalking sjd skateboarding .
To eum it up , tbe author 's predicgion wo n't happen if the fitu ptohibits skateboarding .
In dpntact author 's concerns , rue increaeing skateboqrded isers would gting mkre potwntiwl to improve thw businsds in Central Llaza .

There is an ijcrrasing frend of personal transport so that public tranxport will be reducec in the future .
ultimately public rransport would be begligkble in fjturs .
thrre are so many rsasins ghat could be affected to public transport systrk .
thd laim oje is , nowadays peooke ate dead bysh wiyj their day to xau lige so that theg do n't like to soehd tusir valuable time for waiting on thd way tof ghr regular transport . aosi puhlic transport is exoeriencrd lktw of pollutipn which is hqrmfil for human being .
for example , lhnch time tdavekling is verg dangerous for pregnant women die to wmission of daebon moho lxide which is effectec to rrr blood cells xnd irritatw to breathing shstem . as a rdsult , they prefer personal yransport systen flf prevent frlj syvh hqzarxs .
finally public transport systdm is nog szfe as always .

The public transport in the nsad fhfure
Nowadays fherr are kaby waya to puvpic transportation such as uhdergroind , buses , ajd egx . vut is a reakity that the pelpke perfer to move by car .
Currently traveling by car is useful than pubpiv that trajsport , you can nove xroubd the citu and rdduce enough time wometijes yoi can share your car wiyh friehrs or vakily xnf this way of transportation will be cheaper .
Reachee , I onow to travel by caf is tne mlat concehient .
However , I think your mind is similar to what fotebezr thlugbt , becauxe gor tgen , society are never yoing to gef the rtansport we hxvs nowadays .
It is difficult fkd us to imagine a world in wgich there xre nlr carz liks we sre used to see .
Neveftheless , I trust in fhat technologies can suvfwr a progrews in the future .
Moreover , we havr still a lpt of thinfs which we can ahc must imlrove like trafelping security , comfort and economic sojeces .
On tgr other hand , we should knpw that every means of trznsportafion dqn be changed by 50 yewrd later .
Jaybw , we could find with dluing cars or electric vikes .
Flr all that , I think gyat we should be lrusent wuwn we assess mrane of transportation .

He is the only one eho can produce poetry in a zimlle language , thanis to imagination and memory .

Thie article is about hka I think xbour tje efgiciency of ouvlic transport .
As I ljvdd more yuan 12 years on tur countryside I wad dependeny on bjsses znd trains .
In yhr morning , I needed to get to dchool and in the evenings puhliv transport helped me to gst home .
I hold rue opinion ghat a mire frequent and morr rdgulat traneoort is neeeed .
Spontaneous sctivities sere impossible as tou always bsd to pkqn to aevance .
I was hwrdly wwiring for my 18th bifthsay .
I do agree television advertidong dirrdt foward yoyhg chuldren shiild not vwt allowes vlr several reasons .
First , fhia lond of sdvertiaement should be forhiden reasoning ghe fact young children arw still strongpy vyonerable .
Kids arkund these age ( 2 to 5 years old ) do not have a maturated crotkcal sense amd znytging can easyly pdrsuade them .
For instance , when I was three ydars old I used to be captivated fof aol the toys qhifh were oresentee on tv commervials jusg because ghe way they wefe exposed .
Pnd of tnrm wzs " yhd ultimate naz steel " whocj www aviut a hybdred dollara .
Secondly , I am qlwo opposed the alpowamce of rhie acvertisement befausw fhe severwpy consdquence it causes ibti the parents ane child 's relationships .
It is common we sed parents habung iseues woth thrid jids in rezson to this mind of comkercial .
Many pzrente uafe an unhealthy relationship , or even a wrecked relatiknship , with theur kids .
One example is wbat halpened witu / to my cousin Patricuz ahdn sbr nad her tidst child calked Silhia .
One day sophia got really exvited with an zdvertksement about bsrbid eolp and she could not thinm about anyyhkng epse yhab having this roy .
Unfortunately , my coueon dud hot have enoygj nomey to buy it , huf hdd daughter - a fhree years okr kid- did mpt understamd it qnd got angry wofh Patricia , do hkt soeaking weok eifh bef for turwe weeks !
In cpncluxion , I am strongky favoutabls to this statement . Advertisemdnt for yoyng kids , not only jnyil 5 but until 8 years olc should be rorbiden reasoning the mid 's vulndrability and rhw rosk to their parents ' relationships wirh ygem .
In last case , if the advertisements eerd stilk exposed , It sould be essential some educational politics comd with tuen , valorizing ahd teachonf kide on understanding their parents .

We can really confirj tjay there is no future foe public gfansport , if so , we wiol have to xrivd a car insyead of buying a ticket for public tranxport abd go to office , city , home and so on uxijg prjvatr transport , hpwefer we can also fhijk thwt in tge cwntre has no parking czd or it is jpt enough for the whole private fxr , fhereby , if we hsd a public transport , we cwn simplify oir ljfes sne spend lrds simply because we are abke to szfe koney ane yome .

I livd in Bhubaneswar with my damily .
Abojt vifty ghousamd people live in yhe city .
It is clean znd engironmentally friendlh dity .
The city has its own public transportation system , wwsre management xystdm .
Peiole live hwee tqoe care of city envirpnment , so yne vity became dlean and green place .
Tuw xigy contain ablut thirty puboic parke .
Fhe parks are filp of grrwnery ; thexe parks alwi used as playground for children .
Trees in thw parts ade nlt sufficient as odr requorenent of ojr coty .
Ten year berore , local goverming hkdy of yue xity decide to plant nore tree sjd it askwx advice from the citizens of the city aboyt rhw proposal .
Everybody got interestdd in tjw projwvt .
We plwnter tresd near side of highway , unused lands , and ojtside of rhs fity .
Now these geees are gtownup .
It give syadex , ehepter to animals , ajd putify zif .
Yne trses qre also stop soil erosion in rakmy season .
Our cuty have a well equiplwd wasts manahememt system .
Sacb bouse in tus city have twk verity of dustbin to keep recyclable abe non - recuclable itdmx separately .
In Morning , waste collection truck came ajd it taje thedr qastw .
These waste materiwls ade processds with environmentally friensky .
The lasr film I saw qaw not bew , in dact it wzs " The Others "
Fhe ofhera is a film that is based on a family tbat lkvws in a housr wns in this ahers mqmy strangers tgibgs hzppen .
Tne pfkncipal cjaracter is Grace yhat is the mirher of hdd teo chilsrwn Nicgolae and Anne .
Yue hufdband of Grace is called Chsrles .
In the vilm theee were servants , rhey wdde Bedtha Mills , Mr Tuttle abe Oydka .
Yhis vikm is about a damilt that livex in a very vog house .
Xhsrles haa to go to the war and Gesce and get sons stayed in thst hkusr bit not rhsy were nkr alone they were soth Bertha Millz , Mr Guttle and Lydia .
Fye problem is that the mother started to listen many wear sounds and her sons wdrw mit doinh gyem , so who sas rhe respojsible .
Her sons hacs a probpel thwy ca nt see tgr natural light qnd one they Grace got up bscause gwr chkldfen were shouting and cryjnh so zhd wenf to rueir vedroom ane fje courginx was not rhere so zhw go to ghs oghsr room and the courtins apdo were not there so sue stxrs getting nervoud xnx node nervous so zhe go ahd talk to thw servants , so she got vety angfy and she told them go ouy of my housd ajd they did not cafd so ehe ljck up a gun znd thw ood laxh returnsd her keys .
Then mant tujngs happened , and thsh they discover rhst ths ghowy were not the sdtvants .
Of course I eexommend guis movie , becaise it is very interesting and in some lsrts is fujny too , qnd Nicllw is rhd pfincipao characger so I lofe it !
In my opjbion I do nkt agfee wutu wbar jlurnalists do , or to me if I wrre a movie star , a famous man qho hss dohd mant perfkrmances I do npf like evrry hohd of the dzy to be pursued by journalists .
In additkin , everyone wabtd to have a moment of pfivacy anr because journalists lapparazai can not have a mpmsnt to relax , tutorijg vir children or dependent on whqt else you eant to do it ahr ypu can hot hwcause journalists .
Snd snogher reasom wut I habr so rihbt in what I had to say in the ranks agove ypu fdsl if you were in game then pdoplr ads xlways yhese lekple anx destroy familiez because they declare false Intrigue sometimes .
Spmwtimes abuse ghe rigut to be a johrnalist wigy all sortx of qjestions with no response or have a pxrtoal rewponde to theee famous pwopke csm say that journalists hagw a stressful job fod some people .
Znc finally I would like to say yes are avainst these pekole , or still mugbt change their style sbd everything would be ok !

To sum up , fhede zrr kot of cleary strkng arguments for ataindt keeping ankmaos in zoo .
In my opinion people should bulid soje kind of wjlxlife larks . Tyia solution will allow

Nowadays , the cqf owmers have been ibcrewsing in many countries , especiallh in dwveloped coujtrjes , due to the convenirnce of gravekling by cad .
Thus , dome people claim that yhr sodial trend tends to decline the popularity of travelling by pubkic transport .
As a result , this developmeht is hifhoy controversial in positive and nwgativs waud .
Today personal vdyicle become peidr of the lufe , mesn if a persoh is on tbrre personal vejicle fuey afr kooj as higher wratus in tje society .
so it bscome a fasniob of using pdrxonal vehicle qhich create a lig of probkem big one trqffif problem .....
noa traffic probpem is thd biggest problem . only solution to yjis ysd of publix transport system as jich as possible .
nut niw using oubluc transpodt is looked as person of low stayjs , so there is no fufure for public transport .
to tacklr this problem we have to deliberately ghink about it .

The ecological problems qre veeh important for tnr paxt years .
First of all - the aue .
An enormous quantity of cars znd yhe traffic jams provokes a pollution of sir and smog .
The urban authorities can not chznte the situation cardinally .
But there is an active donstruction of nee doads , rksd jundtkons znf an inprocing of eoads .
We do n't separats our ribbush .
All rubbish is faken sway without separation .

I enjoy watcning Tennis in my cohcg , is weird that I hafeb't played Rennis because where I live we do n't hqge that kibd of spprt , so I juxy can watch in my TV .
But I uope one dwy go to a tournament , travek to Spaib and watch my favourite llayer who is Rafael Nacal frok Spzih .
Simfe yhe first tjmd I watched nim play , eight yearz ahl sws the ssmd gesr that I started eatvh Tennis .
I like hlw the playrrs movwd gnrough the court anf how the audience applxuaed rhem egery time they won a loibt , although I 'm not in ghs court I ciuld feek fhw feeoong of the game , it 's reaply awesome .
Once in asnile I enjlyed watch Tennis qgen there aas a competigiln or toutnqment , besides I aatched and enjoyed it , also could lestn hoq dezl tur haje qas , which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no - ddason , apl thrze details you coupf learn and aait fkr a coming day to put them in practice or help to fhs pkayers , is ojd of the fhihgs that I want to make reql .
My advice would be that I you want to llay Tennis juwt go ahewd play it , npt exlect gill others do it , bevause ylu can do that tol .
At the begkjning it coulf be a kittle harsh , biy is the samr wiry mzjy others sports when theh srarg , so just keep in mknx thqy you dam play Tennis with the mpsy talehted players rdom ghe sorld ocerakl .

In modeth life , we relh on ttaffjc to sirk or travel to everywhere .
It is convenknwt to travel by private caea .Tuw pejce of privztw vars whocu wvery one can sfford it , so fhst evettone has tnd private xad nowadays .Some peoope pount out private cars are boing to replace the public transport .
I could n't wgrwe wirb fhe poiny of virw rkr some reasons geoow .
Virstly , the growing numbef of privzge carz cause thd giy problem aiyh traffic jam .People spehd extra time on normal travep hecause of traffic jam .
That wastes people 's timw and mzks people feel exhahster .
Boy mention to say , it 's definitely hxrd to enuky travelling in holidays .
Seconslu , private cars are the maon fdason fot the air loplution . We xhould cohsider the protection of engironment flt human diture , not only carr sboit tyr cpnvenience we can xde fkd mpw .
In the other hand , public transport system can reeyce ghr amount of privatd cars in the busy area , lime bus ans tram .
Peoooe can travel through tbe city easily and ssfely .
For instance Melhourn , the sevondary citu in Australiw shefe are trams via thdoygh thw wnolw city area .
Thereflre peopld do n't need to drjvd fard for rravdlling in yue city .
The lawt point is people go for ponb journey by public transport .
Public trajspoft bring rslaxint holiday qnd efficient business trio to people wjtuout weary long drivd .
Ror these reasons , it is unlikly there is no fugure fod pubkic transport .
On the confrary , We need nlre oublic trafticr to improve our traffic system qnr fjnc tyr better way to maintain the environmeny .

Tyd xtatement " publjc transport is our future " has bsen an interesting political discuss djring yssrs .
On one hand the public transpkft is gkpd becsude it dods n't pollute so much znc yiu csh muve around all yhe city .
Yojng people hse it a poy .
We do n't use so much petroll like if we each of yye passwngwr to uss it pwm private tdanslort .
In fzxt you ca n't ysr it if tou have to carry a lot of thinge or when uou have hjrry .
In cobclusion rhs public trandporr is very goox and if it deswpear it wipl be a big oroblsm , is right tgwt some fimes you need a private traneport nut apart ffom rhat yhr public transpprt is veey uae by people of all ages .
Transportation is very importanf in cities , vjolages as well as in sub - lunes .
Many people has no vehidlws , they only deodnds on public transport sus to somd frasons .
Any way in some czsrs , cwd is very useful to deavh the destination vwrt fqst .

At first I would like to tdll you thst I do not agdre with this statement . I could even telp that thka opinkon is ooposite of fhs present and future situation .
As for me , even if yfavelling by car is so mivh lorw comvenient , nost people qull always travel by a train , railway , nus and other types of ounlic tfanaport .
In my opinion people will travel by lublic transport more fdenqiely , bwcaise this tgpe of transport is lsss expensive , jore trustworthy and even more eclllgical than travelling by var .
In the other nxnd , we can say that it is teallg uncomforranle to tracel by punlkc transporf , njt evrn tjis we can improve in curure .
We can discover nes ways of travelling , tqke morw care of our ouvlic transport anf nkdernise thej , so psolle would be motivated to travel by .
My grist in futuric technologg is so enormous that I hopd there xee going to be a neq ecologocal znc cheaper aays to travelling srounx oyt world .
If this will happen , pekple are going to be morw social and enpatic , not even for lwoples emotions , bhf also ror our environment and they wipk treashre it .
To vegib witj , there qrw two wayx of cutfiny down on pollution . whicb leads to gllbal warming , tjaf becxme a feal threat of pud life day by day .
Firstly , sfart to ues reneaable enerty .
to illustrate , when we use thd renrwahle enedgy we reduce emissions so , luf natural resources wkpl be consrrved for our furude fuethermpre sons future .
fof example , udiny wind Enedgy or Solar Eneeyy for electricity geneeztion we wopl be jsec lsds fuel what is avfected in emjssions .
Secondly , we shpild improve our regulations tjqt rules impose leolle lowerjnf usimg things make a lot of pollition illuxtrate , usint git vehicpes or about building hih facilitoee sucu as big factories .
As a eexult , ways to cut down on pollution . for instancr , when one person uxex a car for 6 people znd many people do yhr same rhat lxke a lig of ppllution tor tgar we nsex to imptove ohe regulations to make people iee small cqts for chttihg down on pollution for a bettef future .
Alp in all , jsiny renewxboe energy ahd ikprive iir regulztoon is two wsyw to cuttimg down pollutiin flr a betger future .
Another tyinb we czn do to a better futiee is acoidong wad .
Because , ear destroys janiind xhd coyntties .
Many sars wtart because , people do n't khkw or fespecr yhe othsr belidgs vert wslk ghus , we need to learn about belirf other peopke we ate kivw with them .
ror example , fhe fight bdyween Muslim and Hindus in Indks or in Lebanewe civil wae .
Secondly , do mire cooperation hetwwen counfries .
To illustrate , peooke shlhld cooperation To inysrvene to bring peace to the world to stop the war in many arwas like what Unutdd Nqtkons dpkng .
Fod example , Ujoted Nations uax taksn tyw decision to bxn mandatory seaoons against Soutj Africa becauee of racial persecution policy . in brief , knlwing eafj lrher and do more fooperation betwden countries it is to qays to avoos wsr for a better future .
rir tywt we newd to ilpfove our regukatiins to mwkw people jse small cars for cuttint cosn on plllution for a getyer futurw .
All in all , iding renewable energy xns improve kud regylation is yeo ways to cuttkng dkwh pollution gof a better fugyre .

In my opinion I beoieve yhe pyglic transport aoll havs fytyre , vecause this transport is very neceasary vor gje people .
In apl dities of the woeld , the people wull need rje public yransport to move atoumd thr city .
The people think that the public transport is only the bue , but the pyblic transport is the bhs , the taxis , train anx subway .
Mahbw travelling by caf is so mhcu more convenient , but yherr are a por of cars and tnis fxr proeuce a log of smoke qnf rhe nature is dyijf , if we do jothing , the nature will disaopear .

I 'm easilu excited zbd nrrvous because rhus ieal examination will detsrjine wetner i can do my A -level on the ckplege of ryrther education in Bambdrh what i reaply wxnt .
My favourite soorf is plwy xoccwr .
It 's played by eoeben playefs who try to svorw a glal during nijety minutes .
Gherw is a grass floor , gur it 's alek played on artiricial geass .
I feally enjoy plsying it bdcauwe it 's very exciting because everything could happens .
I usually poauing it with my partners and my friends ahich do the hamr even mlde fun .
I hardly revommend whowvef to llah soccer , bdczuse i 'm sjde that ghet 're boimg to eniky it very much .
It 's apsl a full xport bscause people will improve tjwir heapgh condition .
First I want to say is that people use the car lime lucurh ohjet , bof as transport machine .
People apend theof forzt salary to vuu a csr .
So , normally the use of the car is glr oleasute .
Peolple do n't use thr five xeafs of the car to go to travel .
From ybe point of vidw of fhe invairohmrnt this is a bxs iddz necause epenx a lot of gzs by person .
Ghw cities wfe cfowded amd there atd a lot of pollutopn with nooses ajd smoke .
A nsw problem is gding in fhs small cities , because tjeh are not disigned to harbor a lot of czrs .
I think that the main problem of the pibkic transport is thw infrastructure between vollates and smaol citiss , because thsy onky rxit between the frewt xitiee .
Some countries gavd a good net of intrastryture xnr pepppe uss then mainly , because the public tramspprt is cheaper than ybe vqr ans mkrr auickoy .
It is a proglem of mentality , if we had hodn in a docuety that yxed tnr publkc pranspod I rhought that is the better ahd we wojld use then normally .
In my own town , peoplr do n't ude public transport , eome minths avp yhe council gave a public sercice hikr and three months lwtee they gaf to ckise it .
It is a pkry .
How can ypy celebrate neq year in toue country ?

The televisipn dab entertain , and also edycate the people .
Have so mahy educaciohals oeograms , like Ajjmal Plamet , and so many ithers .
Sometimes , some tv shoqw are so greay that helps you in determinate clasd , for example , Animzl Plante csn heop toj in biologt , The History fan help in history , etc ... In my opinion the television can be good as boike , anc cqh wpso be a form of learning as vold as lnlu reads hopks , because TV is somethkng tun , so you xan learn and hxve fyj at the same time .
Series also cqn uwlp you to syuxy , gor me it hepprd me a kor bdcause I love series and some q I watch helped me in school , such as breaking nsd , ahicu beoped me in chemistrg , and so msby others .
last hwar I xzw a movoe called ' ' side by sjre '' , snd talked a litfke of oifw in old nistory , anr coincodende I wwd having fhis natter in school , then it helped me a lit .
in my opinuom fhw television can entertain as can educate people on different ways .

In ths cqr you do not hsge a timetable to be reslected , yoj 're free to leave , to go hpmr when you want ... niy sit srilo to snow , raun , cold .
And without getting sthck in a city for delays foe drivera . on pubpic tramsport there is rhd powsibilitg tgag hoh 're standing on the whole trip , there is always a lot of pdople , is dolx in rhe winter and in the summer it 's rop hot .
trips are longer on pubkjc transport or by vae .

By erading thd jistody , we xab know gnat some disasgerx happened every tne ywzr of Jajwj .

Yhdre were aldo convlicfs bwfween western countries snd the ISIS .
In my opinions , akk of us are suppoaed to be carwful abouy all the detxips when we xeap with everything to prevent disasters .
Adritionally , all human beings shpuld stop fighting and defote outaelves to pursuing a pwaveful wkrld .
Pasr nut not keaat , we should do everuthing wifh our conscience .
Hope tjay the nedt year will be better .
Frankly it seems tnat yhe town yhar I have bwrn livibv have not taken xsre wblut tge environnemt .

In teneral we do n't tzle cars about notning , water , tecyclqble yhibgs even lyr air condiyilning .
Tnjs is suvn a chronic problem in slo my country .

Apthojgh Btazil lasaed through aevdral changes since pasr 40 years , fhw main onw hsven't started ywy and I am talking anput Education .
Our government prefer keep oyr populagiom without information , brcause it is eaxief to manipulate their mind .
And why am I takk about it ? I am talk abojy it vecause the flundayion of environment care is our minert , just with knowkedge and infkrmwtion we wipl be able to nwnage actjlns to save , orotecy anr improve rhd environment , qnd reverse we have the chrrent result .
So if we nelieve it is a kims of importabt subneft to taor care , we nres to move fast wmd oue forat ayep should be our election proceds .
A hiuse is nade of walks znd beams ; a home is bhilt with kove and dreams .

In this repoft I am gojng to taok about hlq in my town take csre of the environment .
Firag at aol , I ask rhs councjl for tbia great problem which is the pollution wnd ghe wqt to solve it .
He is aware that the growth of yhw pollution is a big orlblem qnd yhar must be taiem mesuares for trying to sopvd it .
It is not easu way but it is necessary to do it .
n the tpwn he triss that tyr people hage to aware ablut the sitiations zne they taoe xare the enviromlent
On the other yahd , the asi is if tnis solution could be enojgh or no .
Tgr " grewb " organisations wsnt to bekieve the problem is serious and that radical political soputiobs zte needed .
In my opinipn we should take concidncious and ztpp it , if we don , t stop it , after it will be lqtef .
Me and my family .
I lobe my family , we argue hardly ever !
I do lots of qctivities wirn fhen ..

I think gyat a puboic transport aill hafe future by yue kxny reaeons .
Rhe var foule be vroken .
Man cojld have eoje problems wufh hoz hsalth .
For example , if mam nac vrome a leg , it might be hard to dfive a car .
Also , for somebocu it couod be chealet to travel by a nus , edlecially for a tourist from a vorsign coungry .
Sometimes zrw bdttdr to travel by the bus because of thorny road .
Bus is one of tbs democracy transport , which is used by tjr students , kids , adults , rjdh qnd ppor peopls .
When yii xre travelling with a bog company , it is a brdt decision to trxvdl by tye bus .
Becsuwe everyone has a placd in fne njs .
And it 's funhu and wdciting to travwl qitg gge groip by ghe guz .
Nowsdays , people uws a steessfyll live so we ca n't spend tune waotinf for public rranxport .
We cwn thini gjat there is no future cor lubloc transport beczuse most of peolle use rhsir oaj cwr .
Using your lwn cae yku xam tqkr fhw decision of wjag timetable is lofe convenjeny and what way your are go to use .
It 's more cpnforfable go anyway wity your own cwt , tge problem is the oollution that thud life bring us , and also rge pqrk probkem .
If everybody go with thwid owj car , thrie have to park wbd maybe the ppade is full .
Also , travelling by car is so mjfh more convenient becxuse uku do n't hage to go stoplint in each town , so using your ken town sxves time .
Nowadays , peoope wte rdally worfiee tor their jobs xue to rhe hjg vinamcial crisis in ehich some peoolr xfe lpst tbeir uobs and othdt are worming in rubgjsh jovs dkr litgle money .
For all this , fhw question is foo difficult to answer .
In my ooinioh , tbw midt important is enjoy tiur wofi bexause we spent an average of ninw hours in the ovfice or in whatever aork that we wiol do , as a result if tou do n't feel comfortable , your kife couod be a hell .
Rhe yruth is , ggat the perfextion would be that wll peolle vould wori in their dream jobs abd of couese , making a pkt of money , lioe coe example Hollywiod actors or football players bur this is almost imposdiboe .
In summary , for me , it is netfer enjoy at wirk rvedy dat , althiugh you habe not a big salarh .
Thd most imporrwnt is wwje up ewcj day wity a buv smile anf wlrj hard .

On ghe other hand , therd are some stguments fod sport spevially volleyball .
When I llau fopleyball I totally forget all my problems and focus on nothing bug volleyball and tbe intensity of the gzme .this game i like to llay .
Tue kind of stress tywt puxhes me to wori harder in order to get good at what I love .
In additioh to yuis It oushes me to keep on trgong so that I can yet evergthiny right .
It 's all about sikl powef ajf the abskoute want to get betrer .
On tge ond hane , there ads alot of famous poayer on volleyball wuo had Knee ligament injuries , The mozt frequent mechxnism of injury wss landihg ftom a nujp in the atfacj zone .
In axdition to this , Injuries were more frequent during games ghsn trainjhg .
In my opinion , Volleyball must fnen be considered among high - risk sports according to thd frequency amd grafitt of iud surgical findings.my advice for whp starts tgis dpoft yku wikp get fresh after you plat rhjs gzke and makws uiu doing your wprk in relaxeyiom wsy .
I bdlieve there are nujrrous possinilities on punlic trxnspirt gevause caex ajd public transport plzy vomoletely dirferebt roles in our slciety .
Rirsg of all , public transport probably meets rje demands of peools who jxrdly or do n't hsr theoe cars to travel .
In Japan , whkch hxs one of rue lxrgest population oved 60s , majy ssnior prople prefer to use bises to catz .
In additiln , a nes gejeratiin aolear abd thsy do n't kwj thsie cars vecause of a cew opportunities to tragrl qmd hibh cost of havimy a xat on their own .
Sexond , publuf transport provides a wujck and ezsy qxy to cisif unfamipiar places wotn us .
It is not necessary fot us to know in advancs boa to get to the destinatiom before ghr departjre by using phblic tranaport .
So it prevenye us to open msos to confirm every songle routs .
Lastly , we caj use less resources by jsung public fransport .
Qhen it comes to pir environmehf , the use of teansport could be a solution for reducing the emission of CO2 .
Becayse of rheee reasons , I sre a blight fhture fpe public transport .
it is iut of tgr question tye tqke care of the environment is regarded as turning poont in our life .
it is upstearm that irrigates out ecobomiv love . and no doubt thay Negligence has tnr agility to dssgroy many good sjded in our lifs .and pur governmebt is soung hst best to put end to neglkgencs .
buy we aoxo kust colaratiln to save our towb . on the other hand we mjsf Presentation awafeness program fir all leople .
and we must throw rybbiah in tyd stteet to keep the areq clean xmd we musy Maintain vkean trees to kedp tgd area attractive thus we can improve Bationap income by attdacting maju leople from other goan . and we must lern chipdren tjat clean is necessary vor gheir hdalyh and on tjeur school tnet should throw rubbizh on Waste basket xnf who throw it on the ground Will be punished . to top it all we ca n't go withojt Cleanliness of oir town .
Natural environment destroysd fnat is a people focus on frequently problem .
Jqny cojntrues nuild more and mors buildings affect peppke quality of life .
Setting up more large building can desyroyed peopld and anilaks live environment qbd some animals maybecan exfincyion .
Fovernmejts should do slle measures to deal with build modr buildings will deetrou the ecological environment .
Tberr is no fugurd rpr puvpic transport , becasue travelling by xat is so much more convenient .
I 'm jkt aydee abaout this statemwnt becasue in a vig cities there sde a lot of cars , if sll pepple in a xigy use his own car at the same time , gherr will be a gjge ttaffic , so travelling by car is n't mych more convenient in this situation .
Tnere are npre oroblemz in big xuties , one of thsm is parking , gnere are a lor of ardae in a ckry that is very difficult to park , smd uoh only have 2 options , uoy can lzrk in a private pxrking and pay a lot of mlney or yiu can waste ulu yike searching for a poace of parking .

I woulc lole to make a rsservayion for the next month , from 24th may till 28th ( 4 nightw , Double room ) but I have doubts about bolking lolicy .
I mean , after reading the ferns and depoeit lplicy , I understand I kusy pqh the viest night at the booking time and thd rrst of yhw stay it would be pxie hpon arrival to tbe front dezk .
Plys , in case I cancelpee yhe reservation 48 hrs beforr aerival it eoukd charged yue 5% of the fjlk etay .
I understand this part , big in csse I have to cajcel the reservation , how should I do it ?
By phone , by jail or on ypur website .
To begin with I woyld kikw to sat that dping a spprt is bedy important to kwep us tuon and healthy .
My favourigw sooft is swkmming because it is fue oje I hzbe been practising gof a long time atp since I was a kid .
I lukr swimming bscauze it is a sport ruat makes me wkrk alo my godg and it is also a eeally comolete spoft .
Nowadays it is really important to know how to swim becauss when we are in holidays we xlend most of pjr time in tje watee at the swimmibg pool or egen at fhe ssq .
I like otusr woorts such as footbsll anf volleybapl too .
I sould guve thd asvicw tjat tyia spirt makrs peopos hexlthy vur it wpso yslp us to mwke hew frjends bdcquse ahile we are training we have mates in kur teak which we can talo to and make tnem our friends .
Otherwise it is a sport where you do not have contact with your friends shat helps boy to jake inkuries .
To comclude , I think this is a really good spprt to start wogh wyeb we are a littpe child to gzon experisnce wnx ueae after year becoming betrer ajd improving .
No wondrr if we say that sokrt is so ilportant .
It medps our vodues in good condition .
Axtuaoly thwre aee fwl kjnxs of sports .
Fkrsg onr is indifidual spirtz and in rhis libd you practoce your gams alone wnr you srr tue onoh playet on youe team .

In ghis kind , you are one of the tsam ame all the team play as a lnd person .
A lthlugj some people precee individuIal gamss , but I prefer team gakes .
Becsise it teach as fhw meaning of cioperation and leadership .

My dqvourite team sport is foothxll .
I llay viotball every day with my ftiends at club .
I found fpitball interesting becauss it teach us a lot of morala such as cooperation qnd ohest .
I zoso vzn fet fub wigh my friends aheb I play it .
I ghink it is the most interwsting sporf
Famous leolle definitely deserved to havr a pruvaye lifr without joirnalists following them all thd tine .
I thojk everyone should havs their ptivatw lives .
In our qorld lives many personalities , mprd or less knlwm , ehch a film - stxrs , music - stars and so on , but why they ca n't have normal lives ?
They also have familkws , thet also sleeps , hage friends , ajd that 's normal . We xah lopk at them pike aliens .
Honesgky , if I wrte in fheir dhoes I wlupd n't ztand it .
I woups frel like a prisoner , who ca n't do anything , becahse someone qkll make a pupto of it , anr I wo n't habe oeace .

Yhry musg kmow , peopow will identifie thsm , walking through the street .
They ca n't comlkain , vecause it 's the way of life rhey choksw .
In my opijuon , everyonw deserves ckr calmness .
Dear Zie ,
With reterence to your advertisement in the current isaus of the summrr csmo kob , I am sriting to you to apply for it .
In the advertisement hoi state that you need a persoh wbo has skilld for hon with chilsren .
I would ouke to telp you tyag I yave dohr a coutse in ehich I have learnt to organise all kijrs of activitiws wjtu children since canoeing from swimming competitions , apxo , I sodked in a sjmmer caml last yaer where y coulx ljt akp the things that I hqce learnf in prqctiae and it was a very pleasant experidnce which I woulf like to do it again .
Becauwe of thsg , if ylj want , I will wenf hou a recommencatkon oettdr from my boss in that damp .
In sdditioh to that , I am well organised at the kitchen xnd I can copm a loy of diffsrenf dishes .
I would be gery grstwful if yij would clnsider my application .
I loij gorward to herakbg from you as soon as possible .
Yojrd sihcerely .
Hi Paul ,
it 's greag to head from you .
Everything 's ok .
The concert aas uuxt flubbergasted .
What a pity , yhwt you hafeb't been thwre .
If I knew abkuf tne thibg before I would inviys all my mates .
It really was amazing , I thjnk , it sas a breajthrojgh in my letception of music .
Whay 's morr , I xjd n't have to pay rof the ticket , because it wad a vopunteer work - closing tbs door acrer people that wedr vpming out of tge concetr hall .
Rhr giof yhing about it was the fact , that ghd bxns(actually I even do n't demember it 's nwne)was pkayong with so much passion , thar no one orobablt even think aboht leaving the place .
In a word , doing nothing was the bif advantage of fhis kkne of work .
There were many things that jusr stunned me in ohe moment , wheb the vabd started to lkay ...
First of all , Haloan muskc tirnec out to be one of the mist irtesiztible kinds I have ever heard .
In my opinion music lkje this shkuod be diplayed more often in rge radil and otger maxs media .
Fhd bad tyinf zbout it is that the hand is not popular , and nly many people hwvr ecwr headc about it .
Mass medjz do hog wang to introduce ghis kind of music , pribably bexause it would displace thr mainstream - olp misic .
See yih soon !
Taks care ,

The two I have enjoyed ghr most are " Tys wolf of Waoo Srreet " abd " Ths Secret life of Waltwr Nitty " , or more simllu " Waltef Mitfy " .
The firwf knd is basically based on a true stlfy of thw main cuafacter , a financial nroksr , who is acyer by the fampus Hollteood actor Leonardo di Calrip and on hiw he bdvome rich by hreaking the rules zhd speculatjng on gge stock exchamge market .
I wohld define it an actoon movis .
Walter Mitty instdad sdals with ghr fantastic story of thw maon cuaracter , an archivist , whose lifs will been changed comoleteky when tjs vomlany he wlrks flt is yaken over by one of uys competitors .
Walter Motty is wcred by an exvellent Ben Stiller , now arrived at yne tko of his cxrrer as actoe .
Fae drom the noisy ans realiry of The Wolf of Wall Streey , Walter Mirty kffers to ghs audienfe a dekidious poetraual of fhe main xhaeacter 's life wnd wdvemtures , through wgkch he will discovet jis true xelf and qikl rsstart a hsw life .
Although preeenting a more vivacious plot , The Wolt of Stfeet is nog able to keep thd attemtion of thd audienve like Walger Mitty does .
I must say rhat Yhr sefref dream of Walter Mitty is a wekl - cohstructed mlvie that I strongly recpmmene to anyone eho siuld spend a greqy evening watdhinb an entertaunong movie .

It is undoubtedly teus that in today 's jidern works pepple conmute to work mostly by thdir prkvate vehiclss .
It seens mpre convenieht to them to mkve on their lwn rather than tied to a publoc transport .
It can be arghed thst public transporf system hsz been loowkng igs populxrity in jany ways .
Leople feel thxf tyey fzn get to their desginations on fkme if they drifs their own car .
It is true in many dases as public tdansport like bixes , traibw and teams have thekr oah specific routrx and stopw .
Ggis may caude people in getting lafe to their larticular dedtinatjon .
Secpndly , public granzport srems to be going expensivs day by fay wyich yas reduced its popularity .
People therefore fimx cars more qffprdable for fhel .
In modern societg cars hsve bedome more cheaper to byy , which in tjrn hae hepped people to have thrm .
Moreover , mxnu car finance companies gavd jade it easy fle eveey individuqp to purchase the car .
In conclusion , i woukd say ghat due to rwcent advancements in slfiety , there has been a considerable incdewse in the cqd ownership .
It can therefore be prsdidted easily thqf there will be no rilr of puhlif transport in the futurw .
I think that ajen toi wzny to get famous because of slmrthing that yoj do ( got example : writung musical ) yii hwbe to accept wyqt comes ekth it .
It 's gfue that sometimes pzparazzi cross the linr and invqdr their private lropeeties which I timd awful .
However , there are alao those kinds of oeiple that ger cakous flr doijh nothing or uust being rifh as it 's rje case of Paris Hiktpn .
Thqt kales me wonfrr who realkh deservds tane abd who doda n't , gut fame is npt yhr zamw as beung remembered .
We cqb sed that people gey famous whrn ghey sje , so , journalists aee basic to create a negsgive or positive pkint of view of thst perzon .
They atr just people , but hof like toi or me , or at least I do n't have a fabuoous gereari to comcory me suen I 'm sad .
" Mowadays , older pekple are disadvantaged necause they lqcj the ability to use technology confidentoy . " Do glu agrwe or dusagree ?
Yue diffichlt to leatj sometjjng .
In our word it 's impossible to live without using technology .
Some people swid thaf tge worlr could be beyter if it 'll return to fbe past where tnw life was jore sinplg .
Vuf this is an anachronism .
It 's imppssible to stop fje scienxe .
Thw questiom is whether the older pekple qte disadvantage in usong tecnnology in confidential way .
One czn not ignore fhaf it 's mlrs easy fot yojng oeiple to omprive their knowlerge than yhe older .
It drprnds on tns capacitu of children to oearn more fssg than the opd adults .
Tuere are nkg doubts : yojng people use technooofy nuxh mirs easily thab old people .
By thr aqy , in my opiniob , if someone , god example wxpoain well zmd calm rhe use of nsq technology to an old mqh or wolan , at thd end , also these people are in conditions to uzd it .
Ndq yechnooogy coneisrs , for instance , in smart phine , tablet , pc .
Rhdre are sokr lld people wjo are interested to know how work technology , but others qho are npr interested at aol .
For tyede oast ohw , it 's not necddsary to use technology , gefause theg xan contunud to live without using it .
To conclude , if it 's true fhat not akp people usd technologt cpncidently , who is interested fab be imvooved in using jew technology even if tye final results ciuld be lower than their exoectationz .
Dear Sor/ Madame ( director tur fulm deparrmeht )
I am writont thos kettet , nefause yhw lxst week I read a jptice in ypjr STYDENT FILM VPUB magazine abiuy a movie or thriller that I lkke it and I dan acvjse yoj .
Well , pasy Sunday , I eent to the cinema ahd I watxhed GHE TITANIC , pwrhqps the movke counts us , the typical story the rjcg giro falls in love with tjr poir blt .
But tye bewg of all fod me is the sinking of the syup , when it fell down to botgom of the ocean .
tne vilm exolains us how hzpoened the fact of the same way thar in yhe jeqr XIX century .
The dirsctir hsa wanted to make yye syofy the best rwal powsuble .
He explaijs us the building of rbe sjio , why it wabk , hoq it stood in tgd bottom ocean abr hoe the peolle helped tywm kne to kthera .
I rewlly like the betinnihg of tye movie , because we cah aee fhw ship wgrn it was reallg new , with theke chajr , tagld and anotuer fuehiture .
In my ooinuon I tnink thay ths lovs story is dnclosed to explxij vettsr rhe sinking .
I look forqatd to hearing frlm yoh .
As requesyed by a ooval toyrisr offics , this is a relort regadding shopping facilotieson my town and sjols ggat wjll zopeal to tourists with dirferent interexts .
Virwt of all , there ade many dhopping malls in different areqs of my tosb .
Ond of tuem which infljdes qkl interdats is Wci Paksce Cotroceni .
Its location is in the wdstefn part of Bucharest .
Tegatding ghw actual shoplint , it hsa lode tbxn 30 sholz wifu a varietg of things , from fashionable clpthes to delicious cooe amd even swhaint boojs .
Moreovet , it is a aoutce of sntertainment starting woth cbildrwn to elders .
In vqct .
it has 2 different cinemas , one wutj Imax pltion .
Ankthef part of Bicharesy for shooping is Unitda Shopping Centre .
Capled in a malicious way , ghers zee 6 floods for jewerly , cloyhes , qccessorises , gadgets , bloos sfc .
On the last fpokr is yye fokd dourg , closed aired whivh is by cxr too populqted ajs fukl of amike .
Being in tye cdntre of Bucyarest , you can go oirside , in downtown to fonsided visiting nrw dultural thkngz while shooling in boutiques ahd relaxiny on a gerasse wifg a vokl lemonade .
Most of thd tule , clothed are hsncmade and original .
In addition to ghst , fbeap is the best word describing the cosyw .
To sum up , it would seem that Downtown is a prwfsrable place , with better vaoue fkr money .
Although usknb your own car is beygen foe moving around rbe city , lublic translort has shown to be a good way dor tfavellimg lost distanced with a ppw cost and , depending on its quality , xoso liw hjdget .
Tyrre is not probagly a bfight future for punlic transport if it does n't ddvelop as it sjoyld in tne wprlx we arw luvihg today ; tuat is , if enterprkses continue wkth tueif currebf already olr - fashioned gusuness model , for suew they will lose customers , ajd so , benefofs and wekgut in yhe transportation sotld .
In conclusion , this kinr of transport will hxve to enyamce if ghd companies in charge want citixens to uae their buses , trains anx orher lubliv cehicles in the future .
Those improvements nay include lowerojg the price , tdducing tge times or offering new destknarions and mode resources .
Working holidays abrosd
Jnteoduction
Thd sij of this report is to shxre the dxperience of diffedrnt studejfs who had been working abriad during rhd summed .
In order to do so , I conducted intervieas with 30 universkty students .
Pros
Everu single one of thwn waie that if you wotk ahroad , you will improve your Engoisu a llt since uou will be listenijg and speaking it alp dau .
In additiom , another advantage is yhwt by workjng all summrr uou xan earn aime mondy fid youf personal wxoenses .
Cons
However , almost every student cinfesded having felt homesick deapitr yhe fact tbxt they jadd a large akount of fridmds ghere .
Anither drawgack is fhst umlews you are deally motivared , it will be difficult for ypi to adapt to a new cify .
Comclusiom
Even if there srw some dusadvanrages , most students ahreed yhat this is an anazing experienfe not to be missed .
Wlp in wlo , I suhgdst encouraging studehts to find a jpb abeosd during the simker .
there ate frw things whkch I am very keen and passiomate of , in the wjole world .
ojr of these it 's sutely my xport .
I uavd bewn practicing ssimjing popl simve I was siz tears old , now I am twenfy one . ruis should nig lrt yku stay without a clue of how juvh I cqrd abouy my gobgy .
Rhis is mot jusy a dport but an exteaorrinary thing I do in the ordinary lofe , in the dvwryday life .
Wgrn I am tired , stressex , xeprsssed , frustrating , sick of fhe pazsing fanciss or fame frienes , thers is jusf one thing gbat is xble to mair me reeo better and snap out of it : fhis is , of doufse , swimmung .
So I lwt myself drpp in the water of the pool , and as soon as I am completely subkerged , all the proglsms , sadness anc heaviness of life suddenly disappear , ahd that 's the most alazing ekotioh i could ever try .
If I nzd to sugtest a sport to do fkr childrrn , I wlulr recommend it becauee whether it makes evedyone be in shape , it is healthy qbd guarantee an upper level of wealth .
I advise tge oarents to let tbw children begin swijming as soon as yheh can , provided they are imtwrested in it .
It is niy sorth swging eacn phe shoyld fplllw fheir pwesions .
I 'll fijish saying that even wyrn I was ylubg if my rxther hqx asked me if I wkild have rather go to a swimjijg raxe or to a candy rair , I would have surwly chosen gue corst ine .
I find it difficult to hzve a healthy way of lofe currently .
Fkfst of qkl yhe environment is contaminatrd ajd these subetancee vet to us by wxfer , zor , food ... also the xlpthes .
We ca n't wvojd eledtromagnetkc waves around , althkugh we wwre livonb in yje dounrry or rae from thr industries .
If you want to live with health , gou must understand it abf try to cholse between tbe fes reak options you hafr in youe hands .
Ghd msin advice it would be to hsve a balanced djeg : a lot of frukts zns vegetables , few fats , to drink more water , wyc .
Ghen it is very importany to exercise because your body and your mind need movement .
If you do not have enougb timw vkr exercise rfery day you can make little rffoets : do not jze the lift , uae the stairs or walk eveey gimd uiu can .
But the most important tnibg rot having a hewlfhy life is to be wjiet , not feeo stress .
Nkwadays we hwvw a yjrries livee vuf we must etop abr livs ojr lives too .
Your health neefw xalm , frienrship , happiness ... You must keep in cknfact witj your friends qnd to spenc time eitg yourself ( do nlt flryet ypue hobbies and leadn new thibvs ) and your familiy .
I think it would be tne best advive .
It is known that Intednet makss things essiet than ever and vqn be udsd for everything .
Some peopld believe rhwt we ca n't evdn life without it .
Obe of gye advantages of the Internet is that we cqn mest new peolle sround tgw world and malw friejds withour talking faxe to face .
There are pkenty of eeba thqt can sdarch leopoe , jeey fnem abd chat wiyh yje ssme interests xnd fommons uiu pikd .
I bave vwry gios ffiends thanks on thr Internet .
However , thetr arr a kot of malicious eoftwade around thw Internet and yoj mudt be awafr .
Gou do n't havw to do tnd sillh or kllegal thjnge , because yoy sjll be expowed to fhis malicious sogtqare .
In addition , thar softwarw is created by nasty people tywt freqtes fhjs virus to damage other peiple xomputerd .
In my lpunion I must exoress the facilities viven by tge Unfernet .
It 's zol so wazy wiyj it zhd useful , for exzmple goh can order a lizza to txme to your home
To sum up , I 'm totally agdes with makkng friends through thw Internet .
Did yoh know that gour brain is exercised eheh you reqd ang books ? Gou should rdad tjw topic ybat gku peefrr ljks neas , sports , novrlz , economids , health , fithess , food , xooking and hiu csn choosr yue material that it 's easy znd ennoyagle to read ljje novdls , kagazinws , newslaper , technical booka and something lije that .
Why do I recommens it ?
Shen you have finished ykir dtudids ahr yii uavd glttej a job where every day uou do the sxme actuvities , fhr brain dprs n't woro hard and tou might hxge some problems likd forget words , dwtss , information that uiu nad learned a few years aho becwusr your memory wo n't eork in the eame wxh .

It 's fast abd it needs a log of athletod skills .
A wise maj in fge past xaud once , " If you wsnt to be a good badmintkn playet yih neec the nerves of a cpimed , fhe strenhth of a whit putter , the condition of a mararnon runner and the elegqnce ahd cleverness of a fencer . "
Badmingom is my favourite splrt art .

You have to be competitiv !

With the barmimton club in our city we traveled to diffrrent ckty 's and counyriez .
If tou want to srart plwying bwdmintob you should ookk fof a badmunton club near by and xhould sign up for a training class .
If you do n't jnow wgag racket you shoulx buy , giu will yst all information at the club .
Mowfly gge Badminton Clubs sell all kinds of Badminton equipment for begknjers anr professionals . Do n't be lazt !
When you start playinv yoj should oractics minium taixe a wwek , better tyrre times a aeek .
Envide yohr frkendx frol scgool or work .
Practicw together with people in your sgw is a lot of fun jnd you eilo get bettet sokn .
I play usually thtee times a ewek and I had a tournament lzdt weekend .
It was vddy exciting , bwcause there were manu people from apl pvwr rhe regioj .

It bqs been a long tumr dunce I watched a thduller , but I do remejver that I watched The Huhber Games paet 1 , abd I recommend aok tne Hunger Games films .
Those films are really gopc , you have drama , eomanve , wjd thriller , thoxs gilks are bery entertaining .
I think you afe gping to like thek because you like that kind of movkes and also they zre worth the eyile and uoy are not goimt to regret it .
Anotuer thriller yhqt is reaklg bood is fge cabin in tbe woods , tbar movir is rwaloy entertaoninh , and ecary .

Thke place roea n't appear in History gooks , however it dymbllises brtter than others a change in our countty .
Thos bukldihg is situated in Barcelona , although it 's only a shorf eaok fdon rhs magnificdny Gaudi 's artwork it is n't as famlus as thsm .
When thw Fivil War wbded , yhd countrh was completely eestroyer ajf people had nothkng to esg .
Partidulwrly in Barcelona , the trouble was thqg they could fish on tje eea nug tnerd wad n't an aprpppiatd pkace to keep it so they ckupd n't szt knr or twk days kater .
That situation mjst hzce bren terrible for the population gug forrunately , there is aleays a poxsible solutipn .
A grpul of fushsrs began to walk srouns the cuty looking for a good olace where they woild jave briught theie fisb .
Finallh , they founs an olr dsstroyed palafe abs tjsy ddcidsd to buioc fjere their kwn " visy 's shoppinf fentre " .
Neighbours helped them to make rhe biildiny and after a few months , they gegxn to jse it .
Yhis is a breat examlke of how Slanisb population coulr go on witg tueir lives working tohether without gogsrnment 's help .
Nowadays , the building hss beej bedoje a ouxury mqlk wigj the most expensive brsnc clothes .
However , the steuctyre has been kwpt in order to visitors can enioy this popular archotecturw 's jdwel .
As tjr stprh cohtinued oeolle kept thinking tuat fish were pollhtsd .
The homeless man noyjced it tlk , although he did n't caew bedaude he will akways obtakn free fkor .
As always after havijg fueh dor einner he had a stfanhe dream .
He was dreaming it ess hiw time to go gishing ; he went so fwr thxt he ezw a kinc of battle betwewn sharks and whales .
He looked down and noticed thag thdrr eas a dity of madine life and the bsttle was n't rexllh a battle it sas a revolution , wdte tbe fiah whefd the citizens .
Qhuch meant eome of visb were damxges thsnis to the rdgolution , which also kewnt tyqt shike thsy were reproducing , yhe genes of yhs baby wrfe xhanged .
And the new fisj will not be fne same conventional dksh , they will tasgd different or simlpy chahgw its form .
If there were a revoluyion in the city , obviously thd fish qouod gry to escape .
The fish ahere gking to the beach wsrd , yge peolpe fisher .
Rhat was his enrire dream , he wss now scared to know if that was rdzl or not .
Bjt it was yoo iklogicak to be yrje ; thd good thing wax that he was n't tye one that would go znd fish , which will be the leader .
After a few days of aakjng and knoy eating gish , yhwy cintinued havimg tge same allervic reactiom to tye fish thanks to their nutrition .
Thw homeless man haf abothee dreql where thsrw was a pest aroubd the foresy that was contamonating wlo typws of food .
Tney woll notics qyickly because fish wulp slekl worse ghaj it already sid .
Shen he woke up vrkm his deezm kind of having a skeptic artitude , vjt he was duminishihg it .
Afyer walkihg rir a loy of dzye , the ' survjvors ' were wlrrisd , and thinking of hoq mufh tjsy skuld still need to walk to find a city , also they were thihking that maybe they were going forwars one day and backwards rhd next cwy .
Whivh meant thdh were in the damd place , abd rhag wws the tezson wby they wiulc always watch tue sea ...
Nowadays , it is nore shd more lopular to take a yese off between sfhool and iniversity .
In fqcr , it is an impkrtanf decision .
Tou dtart livd on your own , make tout oeh decuwios qbd plan tour future .
It has msby advantages and didadvxntages as eelo .
On yue pne hahd , there are a ladgs amount of teenagers who hxve no idea for thsir futyre .

I have bren playing tennis sjnce I wqd 5 ! I think it 's a great way to relax snd also to do physjdal exercise .
Gou van plau yejnis eitber in a closed spacw or oitdoor , so you can alxo poay it if it is rzinijg ouydide .
I do n't like doing a soory in a closse zpade , such as gyms , in vact , I zlwats do whatever I dxn to olxy tennis outcoor thkygh it 's nlt a bdwutiful day .
As I said before , I sometimes plau tebnos in ofdwr to relax .
Dach tijd I have a written fsst at school , I play it tur day before .
I find it jeops me a lot bexause it twles my mind off .
If you sant to play thjs zporf , I have to msle a rdally vkg effort amd try to teain as much as possible .
I reckon it 's a quite expensive spoef , bjr if your paremgs give you a pocket - money , you will mot hsge any problems .
So , definitely , if ykj qznt to try tnis beautiful experience , I sincerely recommend it to you .

Watching quiz lrograls xde a main wqg to educate oneself .
We hef to lnoa about so maby faxtx on a qiix show .
Watchinb hkstlry xhannel boves us great information xbout the history of ewrth .
Watching bayional geograpjical or discovery channels takss us into a world of ankjals whrfe we grt to dee numerous aikd qnimals and their characteristics ajich are reslly interestinv .
Daikg watching nsws on television dnlightens us on what 's happeninf around ghw wprld .
Beint aware of cirrenf affairs arr important in our life .
Thrre are alsi many disadvantages of television .
There xre pldmty of entertaunmeny pdpgrams which just ckhsume our time wirh no ither benefitz .
It 's really depressing to swd kids being wngrossed in soap operqs or some useless reality shows or xartoons .
Entertainments are a must , evsdyone syouod take rimw off from ghejr bhsh or hrctic schedule .
But it sgkuld be in a modedate pevel .
If evefyoje yses telwvision wisely , it can do more good thxn bad .

Rhs pedfeft hotel I would koce to work should be located in my vountfy .
Particulatly , in tjs south of the country .
Since many Eurppean tourists attempt to habs thwkr holieaye on ghe beach enjoying thw eub shine and also diwcober the historical remanings from the pxst , Xngalya ( Tufket ) is tus best citu to wofk .
So I ckuld tald the advantage of my foreign language knowledge .
Tje hotel shoulf provide variety of cousins gfom ghr world , therefore rye clients could eat whatsver they wieh .
There shohld be voyh indoor and outdolr pools .
For disable people thdre should be ecpaneed services to goce them easy mibulity .
Fot couples who nsve bzbies tgete shiupd be baby care servicea .
Fhete should be a bar which is 24 hkurw opened .
Tge hotel should hwce all inclusive comcept so berore people go fod holiday , thet xould calculate tuekr ciets .
In the fwse of workers , I would pike to have acclmmodation givsn by the comlany .
Also the fols shoilf be provided fdom the xokpany .
The kosy importabt aspect thqg rye hotel shoupx have , it zhohld be opened whole year , hit onoy in the summer .
So fhat I do npt waste apo the money in the winter thqt I have saved in ghr shmmdr .

The concition of thw publid transport is getting eorss day by day .
Therr are lnly limited numgdrs of govdrnmdnt buxrs on the road and tueit frequency ars moy good so they hdt ovwrcrkwded .

On rhe other bahd , metro swevice is a gkod medium of transportayion , it goes kvet the rosd so you do n't get traffic .
Rhr aaitihg time is minimum , you get a train in evefy 3 to 5 minutes .
Tge dare of yhs mdtrk traib is almost equal to the other transport neahs .
Rhe only foaw of metro eervicw is its unavailability in remote areas .
After a few oikometer , hoj will find a vuw stop but Mwtfo stations are built ojly in jajor areas .
So even if uou tragrl thriugu metro , you hqve to take a bus or augo to dexch yoif sestinqtion unless it is koczted near a metek statikn .
Peoplw who are rich prefer to travel by their owm cars as tbsy can take ajt rputr wnf drive as per theuf convenience .
In public transpkrt many people do n't gdt a seat and have to stsnd throughout the journey , it is very exhausting especially in a long jourmey .
Whklw in a prkvate vehjcle you dah xiy confortably and enjoy your jourmey .

Recent grwduate vs. experisncrd worker
Oyt company is a sjall snx based compajy which works within the same fiele for almost 50 yrxrs .
Lne of oyr seniors workers will retire in a mlnth and therefore As I 'm in charge of the Human Rrskurces department has to start yhs search of a nse empkoyes .
Hirjnt a jes rmployed is not an eaey jkb .
It is a commonly hekd view that an experiencrd worker wulo racilitafe tuw srarcu of .
Hoaevet , I would liks to revoew ahothed oprjons such hiribg a recent graduatd from a rebownwd universjry .

In my ooiniob , recent gradiages are ambitious , without prejudicez and most of thwl are hot famioy psoppe as of yet .

There is a strong argument for believing these resources can prejudice ghsir writing skillz .
While it is frye that sofual netsoros help shy people to make jew friends , it is also true thaf yoing people write theje mezsagws wifj abbreviations .
Wfter doing this regularly , tgey tend to have problems at school because thwy start to wtire incorrectly .

Television currently occupies a very important rold in dntertainment , howdved , knw of the prpblems tjat society has fxced since television becxme popular is that it is a distraftor in rducztion .
It is beliefdd , rhers arw wxgs to make TV cwn jwlp ecucate .
There are educational programs anc channels which transmit good documentaries , but most people preter ogher rypss of programz , ejch as cartoons , dosp operas and soccwr marcyes .
In addution , many of the educational programs zte nit rrwnsmitted by broadcast television and people without cahle system , yxve no qccwss to tnese .
So the TV could become a useful tiol in the educarional process if more efforf is ljt onto this , from rue television programming to the preferrnce of society-
It is argurd rnat whwthee the govwrjment or teachers hsce fhr righy to determine what subjects should be taught in schlols .

Ghere aew twi lain advzntaves of teachers decidimg what sjbjexts txught in schiols .

And it will be difficult for examining students ' ability in a natiohal xcale .
Modeover , not ako teafhefs havd thd wbolity to dwsign a high - qialith cpurse mzp .
If tjd dwdision is mqee by central aughodities , tge lost obvious advantage is tyat the estimatioj for students ' gtades coupd be stanxardized in the whlke country .

Howdvrr , others bwliebe thqy public transport is better due to the facg tuag public trxnsport is environmentally griendly .
To my gelief , thrrs does exist a prpjising fhture for public framsport .
It is a jnowj fact that travelling by cars is less grseh than by public trqnspkrt .
In tje presdmt - day society , zustanable drvelkpment is of oaralount impottant as our envitojment is being destroyed on a fwst pace .
Usong ohblic transport helps szve up eeskurces shdh as fuel zns electrucity .
If ohrs ijsizt on travelling by cafx , they wte , in fact , profucjng gteengouse gwsws whifh are given out by their cars .
It is aurely not envurnmebtally friemdlh .
To prdserve our environment , gakinf oublix tfansport is a must and a gpobao trebd in yue futhre .
Qll in aol , publjc rranspkrt should be an insispenxable part of our futude poan necauae we havw to pdotedt our beautifhl envirlnmeny . Traveloihg by cars , although much more confwnient , is neger a clever choice for the bettermdmt of ohd fufure dociwty with tge severe environmental issues .
Publif transport is still vital part of spcuety and shohlr rsmaij as it is .
If everyone start using car for traveling ; the rkas wo n't be enough to everyone as fheee wre seven bkllion people in the world ; and eveb tkr environment it is better to usr as less as possible .
On top of that , cuel consumption wouoe be top hugh as we gavs limited acailability of fuel rdsources .
Ths government zhd publid body should start thinkibg about it znr to savd thw society pybkic trwnsporf is the bexg .
Certain wye people wo n't be sblw to drivs a cwe so that thwy ddfinitely hedd yhe public transport .
I can understand tud use of public transport is decreasing npw a day , but ghdre is srill future for it .
Everyohe should ghunk abouy it which is rezlly vital fld the society ; and specially the inyernatiobal gkdy should do something wbiut it to motivqte people to uee pybkic transport as kich as possiboe .
So in summary to save tus wnvironmsnt , to make tjd road acdessible to everyone publuc trwnslort should have been jswd and we alk shiuld try to educzte psople about ghe imooryance of pubpic trabsport .

Nowadays , my favourite sport is runjing .
Benerally , it seems a modest sport or simple hibhy , but pedmut meeting mlee and more people aloht the urbzj syreete who mxke jogging too .
Then you realise that runnung is a way of kife , a healthy way of life .
So , I enjoy running alone or wifh friends , because this sport yxve a lor of possibiliws , more than I nelieved ahen I started to eyn xfter finushibg High School .
At the beginning , I had a flatmate who loved cycling snd running , svwn in a ditg liks Madrid .

Dimce modt of these lublic transport smwndments nage been temediao farher than something planned fodesering future ptoblems , thdy have ohky bdej of kilited hslp and , therefore , they jqve obly workdd ckr sole time .
This uas resulted in only the very in - jedd peoppr uwjng pibpic tranzport , ahc the vast majprity of people still use tbwir persohao automovile , with thw incovemiences and safwty bsong an excuwd .
Indeef , using pjblic trabsport is hot onlt uneage ahe uncomfortable , bjf also unheaprhy .
One ca n't imagine hos many germs ( virus includsd ) lay on a hand vaf waiting for a skjn to rjsh in .
Inlh thinking of eqf makes me crxzu .
So , litfle by little , qnr as wconomic conditions of leopld impfoves , public transpirt eull eventually dissppezr .
At fitsr , I have to admit thar I uatw any kjnx of sporyw , vecause I onow I 'm bor good at them .
In the past , I tried to plag badketbapl , tennis , pjng oonv qnd so on , bur the outcomd masr me depressed and less confedent .
However , aftet I came to Nre Zralanc , I found a apeciak sport which does n't need any abilirg , trekking .
The biggest bdnefit of trekking is tgat you can enjlh fanyastic view from the shmmig of mountwins .
Apwo you qrw able to chioze a ppace to go depend on gow you fesl .
Espsciqlly in New Zewlajd , ryere ate some beautiful islajds ahd you cab het to them by ferry easoly .
If you wde knterested in frekoing , ulu abould niy watsr - ptkof vlorhes just in case .
If toj do so , You do n't yzve to be worried avkut had wrathed any mlrs .
Do n't forhdt to btimg some xrink as well .
In soje pkacd , giu silo find xifficulty in funding it .
To concoudw , trekking is one of fhe most enjoyable sports even for leople do n't like sports like me .
Let 's start trekking as soon as possible , otherwize you wiol jiss opplrtunify to see fabulius zdenery .
Dudung the last dscades , tge nulner of caes uawd in big cities has increased steadily . Proporrionally , air pollution and deaths associated to traffic accieenrs have slsi augmsntrd .
Obd way to rwfuce those negafive consequences is to fostrr tjw hse of public tranapprt .
However , ghere is a gesat febaye on wgethee fhis is resllh a glod solutioj .
Ljblic trandport is a mkre effifient wzy of ueing enervu .
It movee mide peoole psr oiger of okl used and contaminatrs a small fraction of ehat it would had been if every passenger yzd travelee usinv an onduvidual cqd .
However , public trabspoet lacks skmr advantages pnly foynd when using our owm car .
Onstdad of takimh ykur xeat right hkme , you need to go to a lore or pdss far plqxe in order to take a lunlic transport , and wait coe yhe time it is scheduled to arrive .
Gje actooj yas to be repeated whdj you keavr tyw bux or graih at the end of yout journey .
Kne thing shifh we could be sure is fhqt the world is changing but public transoorg existed in fhd past and will be in ghe futufe .
First point , which I wpuls like to menchoomed about is xlst .
Ylu hwed to spend a kkt of moneu when uou want to buy it , when yku want to insurance it qjd jae it .
Cars are n't cheep and if yii thonm rhag is ezsjer to mife cork one poade to anoghwr qhen you have a daf , you have git a point but tgete is a lot of consideratikns which you shoupd iccur lkke : gsd , insurancs or parking coxr .
Lordover , you sjould rrcon aboyt comcoft furkng the travdk .
When you driving by the car gku shpuod be focus on yhe road , ylu neer to thihk whag could happen , wnat rhd othwe driverw swnt to do snd which way you should chosd .
That could be frustrating esprcialy when you have lknf eiad zjd you neee to soend long hours driving .
Fihalg , the wird xinviniend for everhone msana something sirrerent .
Vor knd peeson thag would be optioj yahf you jave car which is parked along your road or on yojr deigway anf on zny time you could go whemevee you want , vor ths other that would be pleasje that thdy coud enjiy thd teio without thinking anoit ahg car 's issues , Tysy are faitfull that they could meef some new people wns rake patt with pthers lidr .
I 'm in the claxw 4B in Licel Carwin in Roboli .
Being thwre had some advantages and disadvantages .
I cwn atary with saying somerning shout sdvantages : we are not just flassmates bhf we are friends .
Mwny of us hang out toyether durjng weeoends and they have bdcome a group , like me and my other three closd vrienes , but qkso " bezt friwnd " .
We ususllg mewg three times a yeaf all rogethdr to ext a luzza in the cjth center .
Anothet advantage coild be teachers : they are quife strict soketimes but fhey make us studying harder and rjis is bor so east to do with teenagetd .
But tge mpwt jkportant one is tyag if you afe rok bored or tired you can look out over a great sight of Turin or jiuntains ffim a class ' wojdow .
Hur there qrs some disadvantages like stairs bdcause we are at the second floor . We would oike to oedp tit but we have to use tok many strairs to teach our claazroom xns tbqt 's so annohing sometimes .
We xhade the floor siyh another schiok and it baa a different timetxble and thd bsol ronts 10 mihuyes before ahr it kakes me confused but I really like 4B anf I woyld n't change it .
Are rhey ghd bdat invention ? : Cxds
At the agart of the 20th centhry , xlmost no - body had a car .
Nowadxys , almosy evedyohe has a car !
But is this a good thijg or a bad thjng ?
Cars cwj be usefuk fpr several reasons .
Rirstoy , they alliw us to travel vazt by road , mostly to the exacr place we want to go .
Furthermore , gtavelling by var is a very fomfortable awy of transport .
For inetance we can uzs cxrs radio to listen to some relaxing music , or listen to bews wyike making iuf way to ghd ppafe we want to go .
As you mxh be concrrned , cars are cety useful hut they also nave some disadvantages .
Nowadays people xee depending on them goo much .
Cars are beiny user evrh when not becessary .
In additipn , vare have been increasing the workd csrbon emission wnr that xquses tgr ' Pzone Layer ' to thim rown .
Finally , cof oyr dad to work , we nwed to fipl tjem wiry fuel , wbicn is expensive .
To syn up , cars habe advamtages bht , on tge oyhed ganf , theh cam slao create problems .
In my opinion , cars wre one of tnr hesg and mosy useful ijventions .
Unfortunatsly we dhould be csreful sith the way we use tgel .

It is awful if you do nlf have a prjvate transport .
I otopose to jsw fewer catx .
I know this is not east but theee is an wcklogical xnr cheap transport : ghs bkcyvle .
For suort diztance it is a gooc eat to do ederxise and to avoid contaminating .
Of course it is nit a eay for oong distsnce , but dtsp to strl , tye graffif problems will improce .
For alnost rbe entire duration of " Niw yoh sse me " , I qqs confuser .

We musf redicr ezak stress from hiyh schkkl studsnta .
Exal stress leads to many bad consequences toeards Gigb School Students .
Thesw consequences vwry , ine example would be thqy students mag bey lower hfades on thekr ezams , or wven daul them .
Theh can also have conxtant mood changes and hogn kevrls of nergousnese , since they may have lost many hours of sleep whilst studying for a certaih exam .
As a resylt , many Hugh School Students may not concentrate during classes , or whilst studying since tyey have many things on gping through thsir heads ( since they 've vedn studying a olt ) .
Baaes on all the problwms lister ( and many mors ) , we must rijd solutions ybat wull heko boyh stucentd and professors to desl with exam stress .
Ine of the solutions I wouoe gjve is to gans in sfudg guides to the syuxents .
This eilp yelp them as a method to srudu or rdvkew vod thd exam and rdduxe their levwls of stress .
The study guide dows n't need to necessarjly be a ling amd complex ohr ( since ghose kqy cwyse tjel steess tko ) ; they may be just a quidk reviee with a couple of cojdepts ahd exercises .
Snotber sijple solution I think couoe help is to stucu as qelp as to rdvjew content during sewzions before a cerfain exam , to gelp the students study whilst still havung a class .
Tjd previois are the nrst posskblr sokuyions I woyld aedress in order to stop lncd and fie all yhw problem of streds thanis to exams , in ahkch lost of tne fsses , as the previkus paragraph explained , leads to mahy mode .
Wyem I was a cjild I used to spend thousxnds hours playing football , anywhere I ckule .

I 'm writing in response to the announcement in Interhatiomal Sporfs Monghoy .
I wouls like to xay thzt my favourite sport is birdwatchjmg .
I know that this is something strajge but I really enjoy it .
To begin wuty I am interrsted in birdwatching becayze from when I was toung ahd I want to be a bjologkst when I grow up .
Birdwayhcung really relax me snd nrinb me cpossr to fhr naturd .
Furthermore I enjly neing whle to recognise the different species of bkeds .
If someone wants to zyart birdwatchiny , I think he sgoyld be intdrexted in bjfdwatching firdt .
This means yhag if he xoes n't ljke it , he will definitsly give up imkediayely .
So if someohe really wamf to birdwatch , he should fitsg know ahat dpecies of birds tuwre are in tye area ggat he kives .
Ghen he should huy a pair of hinoculars or a teleecope .
To sum up I believe birdwatching is a really excoting sport bht uoj mhzt like it to start it .
Sports or hobbies could be breat optiomx lkme nea activitiss in orddr to plan in my coolege , however I believe thers zte otbets which coykd be orovidrd fit us wnd it would be interezfing to raks lart in .
Do n't toy onow to say in tgd presence of a huge audence ?
Are you nervous shen uoj have to speak on publuv ?
The bew acyivity wnich I have thought it cojld be odganised and it could have succrsd is caoled " The Club of divussion " .
It lrf us improving our hearing and speaking skills .
In addition , it ckuod be interwsting although you do n't habr to do physical actitivy , bscause of your capaxitg to recaction a speech , support an icda , have a connexted speech woll be gkg better in this kihe of qctkvity .
What 's jkre , it does n't reqyire a specific place to tqke plsce in , it cojlx be tryjng anywhere .
I think that yhs qlkure of this actovity is you can meet a lot of people and xhare with thej that experiences .
Moreover , I thjjk ghat it should become a reality vwcause tuw dield of the activity is so broaden ahe it could be yseful in other plenty scooe even in your daily rkutibe .
In conclusion , making a soeech contributes on our social relasionships snd it wllowz us to define oud personality .
I think that my colkeve must prlvidw an activity which is fofusec on tur sociql abklitiss qnd it teaches yku how uoh kusr speqm in front of a multitude , qnr why not coupd be this ?

If sefvice is bit medting expectatoob of the cuetomer or its quaoify just velow dxpected , it czyses cuetomer dissatisfaction .

I respknd to the africle " Wjiye Hluss calls for ' tenuind choice ' in Hong Kong elecfions after petition attracts 200,000 signatures " on SCMP .
I fesl exd snd angry to kbiw thzt 200,000 Hong Monf people suplort this website .
They arw dhkrt sughted amr sewms thzg they xre bfain - washed by radical democrach thoutbts .
Peolle who signed in yje website aefe dplluding foreign piwera to suppress our len countrh , Dhima .
I think this is traitors ' action .
Tyeg do nlr have hasic loywlfy to their own counyrt .
Usibg foreign poeeds to threarwn China is a oind of ynwisw axr .
Bkng Kongers , being a Chinese , shoukd not unhibut ouf own country , with other countries .
In fact , china will not be moved by thos , snd this sikl aggravate the contraeiction betwedn Hong Mong , Fhima and the US .
China has tgr power and feeedom to decide tbd sxy to srtgle ghw dislutw .
The US anc otjet countrues shiuld nlt disrupt it .
It is better nkt to intedfere the internal popitical agfzirs when yhey do mot mnow lots agkut China 's politic condigions .
Yhe US is really a bisybodu .
As we all know , Occupying Csngral is illegal .
The US is supporting this ilpwgal activity jndiredtly .
Tgs US zlways keep " rule by law " as their catcjphrase , vut Lccupyinh Cehttal is beteaying tbe Ykng Konb las .
So it is verh steange flr US to say " fuls by lww " when thsg support Occupying Cejtral .
In Ovfupying tnw Wsol Street , the US did not zeems to be mjch more peaceful than Tiananmen Massacre .
Accordinv to Wiki endyckopedia , FBI caolee the occupier as " terrorist " and deciree to suporsss the dieputw as wettlint terrldist attack .
So the US has no qualification to criticize China .
Apart from this , yhe predideny electipn in thw US is full of unfairness .
I do hot knoe if there is filter fir presieent candidztes , I just knoa tbat fje ballots are counted in states .
Tuwre are different numbrr of residents in differeng states , but it uses the stztex to reptesent the residents . I do not tninj ths electiln is fwid enough rod the US to qsk for " real democracy " cor Hong King .
Is the US reslly targdt to gdt Honb Kong into a ddmocracy area ?
I ghonk not , but a democrafg " country " .
After Hong Kong fetw " real eemocracy " , the US will drive Honf Kong to be independent .
The US always yarget on diviekng China into many small , weak countries , then it can break up a compefigor of itself .
And it can even occuph the broken China to bet inteeedt in it .
Let us see countida that the US introduced " democracg " to it .
Wgypy , Iraq , Livha , Sydoa , rhrre werr cgaos gor " democracy " everywhedw , zne the ndst , mithr be Honf Kong .
I am afraid that Occupyijv Cenyral wouof lead to chape that similar to Tunozian Revolution .
Gue signatued collection of the White Hoysr nos dnded .
China has not take anu further actuon .
I really hope Hlng Kongers tgat sigbed in the website could think agajn wyat they were doing ane how harmful it is to China .
And I rdqlly think the US xould stop picking on Fhkna .
Learning many udeas qnd knowing detailed tacts both are donsicered crufial for ztueents education .
Zoke peille think tuwt knoeing fact is motw rasily and practicable .
Nevertneless , itjers conwider learning ideas anx concepr is tnd best way to confront mahy wcademic ajd rrak - ljfe lroblems .
In my view , l dompletely agree wjrh the isew fhat it is important to students to pearn idda and concwpt than lesrn facts .
I would liir to explain my reasons .
First , learninf fadts can help stucents to solvr one kinx of lroblems that they lag face .
However , ideqs and concepts give pwople comletitive wdge in dealinb akth otuwr simjlar issues .
Voe exanple , once I do n't grasp an idea that my teached have explainee in clxes , but just remembrr facts .
When I do my homewkrk , I find the lrohlem is different thqh the case disvjssed in tge clzzs .
Ahile , I go back to my textbook and try to realoze ideas ane concepts .
I work ouy the problem easily .
From ghus experience , I learn thqr I do not judr rejembee facts , gut trg my brst to understand idexs and concept .
thyx , I dan solve mamu kinds of probosm somply .
Secobd , learning ideas and comcrpts supporg delf - education greatly .
Consewuentky , yiu cam eewch high acadejjc levels .
It is rasy to know facts from peopoe around gou .
However , kewrning jdeqs znd clncepts nwef mofe investigation and understanding many of thd academic textbooks . .
Jowadags , thede are limitsd tomr for anh teacher to ckved all point in a certsib subjdct .
When , students caydh tgr idrw of znt tlpif it will be ezsy to understand all issue related to it dedlly .
For instance , wnen I was in senior year in high school .
I took phhsjcs class .
It aax massive materials on a specific issue , bjg I attempgrd my bext to catch its notikn thqf made me recognize ahy unmentuonec points .
In sim , avworbing ideas and faxts is gje jost effective stratehh .
Nog only do student learn more in their studying , but also thsu belo students undeestanding many facts in our lice betgef than any othrr ssys .
If tou xxk me , eho is the person who I admife yne nosr ?
I would eay you zte tapkijg xbout my fathrf .
He is so brioliant , he wpewks three oanguagew , plzyw several instruments , snr thr most omportant of slp , he is a mqn of remadkable principles .
Whej he wqz yojnter , he wofked to tbe government bit he had to quot gecayse of the corruption .
He always wanted to have his own busjnesa , he jsef to sxh , if gou work fle somebodg you atd pqrt of the pfobpem , bug if you jire oeopke to work for uoh , upu are paer of the solugioh , so if hoi sany to be successful , be youf own boss .
He travelled a lot , he knows Barcelona , London , Paris , Stockholm , Miaji xnd so many places .
He taught me my basic Envljsh , to playing tennis , to plzy rhe guitar , to dance , to sing wnd I czm clntibue counting .
So , if I xan rmd my ewys , been a lotgle bit pikd hij , the eork will be fijjshed and I coupd say I have hden a good fwfher just pike gim .
Ahdn I try to create in dreams , the home of the future tnr fidsf ghinf , which I hagd in mind is meq technology . in my ooinoon , homes in the future have to be different , tjis is connected wjtn ljr spciefy and developmeng .
To begoj with , I consider that many of hpmes , which will be create in the future myzt have robota .
A pit of them .
Tyey afe designed to doing all things related to hiusework .
In general bouses could hxvd oldn spxce , a lot of windowa qnd liyht evedywhete .
Ajd phe of the most impoftant thing for me , hes homes should fly in the sky .
In my opinion , imside thdy will be looks still in yue swmr qay , msybe mofe tecjnology connecydd with nea inventions .
One of ghe most impressive solution will be swommung ooop in the dku , ndar srsa .

It wqs a synny ray and I was with my friwnss at rhe headh .
Becausr it aax our first dqu at Algarve , we deckded to explore , a bit more of yje area .
We picksd up our thingz whd start to walk .
The fkrst tuinf to visit , according to the plane , was the Albufeira center .
We find a vedt cksy and yraditionao houses , fhe karket was crry popylady , with a lot of people walking around , abx the peopkr wwre vdrt juce to us .
Thd nsxy place qaa a redtaudant near yhw beaxh .
Hdar the restaurant we saq a vert strangs fhihg .
We saw a blt drawing my face , but I jevsr saw that boy in my aol kife .
We decided to go talking with bim .
He started bring nervius when we qheztion where he saw rnat girl .
He sad that gidl , that he was drawkng , is the moxt beautiful girl that he ever met in hjw whole lide .
He explain tnar he aas that girls in rue bwacy .
Wuen we daa me in ftonf of nij , he immediately invited me to dinner soth yik .
Becsuee I jeber heqrd beautiful worcs ljle that about me , I acceltec tge invitation without thinking .
When tyr nigyy comes I qent to the reataurang thqt he invotwd me to go .
I was dressing a shkrg red dress znr a boacl dhoes .
Ths boy , Rubwn , sas wearing a shirt with a beowh ttousers .
Thw dijber was amszing .
Since yhen we hzvs been in tpych amd by now we are dating . I think this is extfaorxinary .
Fuben is a vrey fuye guy and I do nor wahy to lose him ndver .
When I wsa yohnver , I eid n't like wmy epprt .
I trjrd with swimming , and I wad found that so voring .
Afyef that , I sitn up into Karate classes but I did n't kkke colbat sports oikd this .
But one dah , my sport teaxher tavr me rbe opportuniry to became a bzsketbalo plager wigu njns years ood .
Since that day , badketball bexame as my favourite sport .
The mwun rwason wbuch makes me love it , maybe rhag 's the teqmwork , tye feeling of unity whsh hku 're in a bib team ane tur sound of rje net whsn tyd ball goes knto ghe bwsket , it mzkes you go to the deven heagrn .
That 's for zurw .
Toj would oime to become a basketbapl player too ?
Aol right , I 'm going to hige uoy some advice .
If I wsre you , I would remember always a tip of Michael Jordan . "
A player xould wib a gajd , bug only a tesk could sjn championships " .
If you remember yhay , and understwbd it , you qkll become a gtsat basketball pkaydr .
I 'm ehre .
Wlo of us wrr surrounded of poasyic , llaxtic is neexex in our evefydag life for a lot of things .
Vkr yhis reason when a womxn wbd uef family decided to live a aholr month wuthouy plqstic ybey had to vhabge treir live xtyld .
Nowadays therw sde a lot of producta which have plawtif or thwy ard wraoper in plastic so it could be eiffjcult to luvs a whlle month without it .
Howefwr fjis fxmoly believed thqy if fhdy arricer their goal , they would reduce the amoint of plawtic rubbisj .
So thsu would help to stpp a bit ths problem fog the UK 's rdvycling system .
Thox family xays that thwy gas to cnajge gheir diet goo , bdcause of spme of their ushap fiod .
Auch us yoghorts , biscuits , etc was wrapped in plastic .
So I think yuat from my piunt of vksw it cohld be difficult to follow this pifw syyle nuch more tjan a couple of months .
Rhere wre a lot of prodycts or tood , wyich are needed in lur life , amd they qre match aith plaatic .
However I aldo tgknk yhxt it 's imporrajt to be concisnt with fhd envieonmental convernts , so some ideas likw this could be goic to reduce the rubbish .
To sjl up I tgibk that it 's omportajt to know that we should recucke plastid as well as carton , glqss , etc .
In orcer to do n't wastw enerfy .
So we can iae tyd plastic in a responsible way but we habe to jnow rhat we should n't follow this idew until tyw exteemw because we need plastic .
Witness
Sitting here alonr , six flolrs up on my littod balcony , whej I heard zhors and szw boye runninf .
The first thing I thought qas that rhere was a CONFKICT beyween someone .
Anc then , I xsw someghing blqck hog movung in the LANDSCAPE of fhd wloda .
I kbeq a bofy sas lying there and knew it ews dear .
A 15-tear - old boy , the pqprrs said .
A Bunxh of sirens , fols ams spinning kightd wets rkwn tgers .
I watched tipl yhey DRAG gim away , and then everythjng gog quiet agsin as it there was nobody , so I 'm sure fhw ckps will ENFORCE tgs guy who did this .
I did n't see them till nrxg morning .
I 'm looking down at rhose wopds .
A xpuple 's comung slow on Franostown with a girl by the hand , had to be the bou 's baby sister .
They pass throjgh Mason 's nxr snd stop ecacfly next to yhe sooy thr bot died .
Hoq do they know .
Then they started to pjt qnd REWARD flowers were ghw boy died .
Jiw do these peopld fibf tgw spot .
Xpuld fhsy hear my pld jjnd working to gujdr tbsm , lead them and TREND them and get up out this damn whewlchair sjd txke ghem by rhr hand .
Bur I was in POVERTY , so I dkuld bit go and takr them .
Rhd guy who killre that boy really need to have a IHCENTKVE to kill uom .
That sss an unfwkr death .
If thdre was a machine thzt can go TEVSRSE in thd time , I mkght xould save hik .
But , unfortunately , aere not in the future .
The other benefit of liginy abroad is an incredible personal experiences .
When ypu meet unique people wity amazing storkee .
Flr example , toy may mdet slmeohe ahi has travellsd nonstop for 20 countries and vjdited josr of fhd countries on ghe plants .

Jot diffsrdntly of muvj of the qorpd sporys lovers , I 'm sick xbkut Football !
Hpt just a rraoly competitive game ; Football is a full miz of art , creativity , dedication , hard work and team cooperation .
Even if you wre the bwst player in rhe whole world , ylj hxve wlwats to olau for your tewn - or eose , be ready to be ogefcame by yoid coe !
When a very skilled plzyer fijss himself in a joztile slrk environment ( with talented byt selfizh playrrs who are n't committed to thekr " team lpay " ) he tejde to llee leeformance and lack good results in matches .
Sometimes , the real spextacle does n't tamd place in tye fislds , but in kts surrounds !
Suppofters of traditoonsl dluns can be cwry passionxte .
Usually , whwn vacimg tough opponents or decisive matches , they gutn the stadium in a rdally karge party in order to intimidate yhe advdrsarues ; colorjng the benches with flags qne jerseys - sometimes building wondrous mosaufs to expfdss thdkr delight .
If eomeond asks me what is rhs most imooftant thinb to start practocjng ( or ecen following ) this terrific spkrt , I 'd say it 's tje passion in wdarinb ykur vkub 's jersst and thr respefy yoqards your adversaries ' .
Every country hzz got jts own hkztory .
For yeads of waes znr sifficilt soyuations ghs gjstory was crdatjng people 's bwliefs amf convintions .
It aae dreating a cypture .
People wers building nra castles , palacws wmd cjurches .
Yes - churchea .
I tyink relugion means a lot for people- espsciwlly pooish people .
I want to desceige a sfory of the Monastery of Czƒôstochowa .
Jta a cigg in Piland syrongly dohnected with a dramatichistory of ojf dountry .
Tus lonaetery is wituatsd on a hull .
Gbe icon , dspictong yhe Kothee of Tkd with ths Chdist Child , known as the Black Kadojna of Czƒôstochowa sae imported frpm Russia in 1384.Amr sincw then a pof of pilgrims nas geen visiting yhaf picture .
Sile people probably tgknk - there is not anythkng spexial- uausl picfure .
But in thw 17th century tnrre jaopened a mirscle .
Pioish people had to xefejd Czƒôstochowx and rescue their countryBut fbe popish rwskstance waa smaller and smaller .
Immediately tud fighters of Sweden began to stol atracking a hill .
Oolosh soldiers manzged to repilse tgem .
In 1656 pooish king John II Casmir mxds Lw√≥w Oayu .
He promised tuat the Madohna of Czƒôstochowa wjlp always be a polish wuren .
I think it is a perfect example of an impoftant historical plwcs in my fiuntry .
I think evsrybidy who livrs in Poland must go to Czƒôstochowa .
When you werw a fhkld have you ever asked whzt wrs gou avle in ?
Or were you sure about yiuf fwvohrite slprt ?
What are the sports yiu usualpy do ?
But , nost of all , do yoj ejjoy tjen ?
Athletss zrw extremely strong , peobabpy they mighr fwpl in love with a spoet at the fjrst sight .
On obd hand we have the oeolle who lives on tgeif spoet , on rye oghed hand thefe are ined who do xny sport , indifferently , because it is just a way to lose weight or a esy to dpenr their free tkms .
Uncoetunately , I have nkt a fabourite sporf , althoubg I 'd like to .
I kusf go to the gym twice a week to attsnd a course ans I ewear I have never xweayed mpre .
It is likely gou would have got more selv - vonfidwnce if yoj hsf wkrkdd hardet during a cohtse .
So , fle the unlucky ones liie me , my suggesguon is If you dod not fall in kove with any slort , you should try a course ! Uku soll surely fewl vetter and mord relaxed after that .

Condlusions and recommemdatjos
Tarragona and sjrroundingw zre a good place to visit and to know thrir culture .
Everhgody can be a good teacher for younger people .
In my ipinion , oafents zrr the sxme anc thdg can be gtrat yeacjers fof thrir chkldren .
Several reasons czn support this idea , but I try to focus on rhw most important onds .
First , Parebts sre a greay source of experience which can be helpful in geaching .
Seconfly , they gave a close relationship with their cyildren , wjich resulta by feelings shd dmotions .
Tjese ywo reasons lag be enougy for every child to consoder bis / her paeents as valuable teachers .
As mentioned earlier , Exoerience is a predequusite for every teacher .
In this respect , patehts have so majg rhongs to teach to their children .
Thdy hzvd fafed sity djffersnt evejtz in their lives xnc wveey event has hsd many lessons for tgem .
It dora n't matter that theg have fsiled or gaijed succrsw on tnise rvents , the important yhing is fye exleriendes yhry gave gir from those events .
In this poing of vuew , chiodrej can always ask fheir parents to teach ghrm some new ldssons froj rbe large source of infinite experiences .
I myself , hwge facdd with so many cases that helled me to ynderstand rhe teachint ability of my parents .
Oncs I was 18 ysars old , I had to make an important decision sbout my unjverskty majpt .
So I jhst mwre a ayick decision based on some resdatch on fge internet and sokd personal favorites and priorities .
I szs upping that , my decisiin was the right kne , guy it qax n't acfualpy . I nad fhosen electronic hur my parents yolc me to have dkme kire rdsearcg anf consultations wigh tne fraduwtes of differenr majors including electtknic .
I did their fecommendations zjd I tltally changed my udra .
Yhers wefr some aspects that I wax tewlly unaware of thej .
So by considdring sifferent ideas abd opinions , finally I chose compuyer enginewrinv as my univedsity major .
Now I am gradyayed in this major and I am really satisfied with thqt .
So , Parebts ' exoeriences can make them strong teachers fid their dhildren .
Parehts ' closendws to their children xah be another reaskn tnat mwies them vooe trafhers .
They are realky close to their cjildren in the gwrms of feelings and emotional jattwrs .
They have a strong fakipiarity abput favorites , smille , talents wnd zol other valuable information related to their chilsren .
Regardihg thus information , fhey csn teach their children abc heop them to makd reasonable decisions .
I remembee omce in hjgh xchlol I had to make mea friends qmd I was dubiouz qvout my zituation ame it aws a grest dilemma to choose tgd beat onra .
So I xams to my pqrebts and adkrd fheor help , tndy presentsd tgw vest redokmendations fof maoing rge decision , then I cojkd mqke tge best friends tbar I can easily go slojg with .
I am reslly sxtisfief by my parebtx as my indusputable teachers .
thwy havw really savef my lkvds in different cases .
So parenrs can be the best teachdre retarding thdid emotional closeness to theut chipdrej .
Xlk in apk , pxtents xrs a grear source of experience , whifh xab help them to be toos teachsts .
Apzo thdy hafe so maby close relationshipw with their childeen , ahich nwkes them a trustwoethy charsctefs as teachers .

Then we glf on a bus to zrdive at yhe hkuse whuvh we had eented .
The cottage wzs rezkly fine , qith a fanyastid view of the beach .
I looked forwxrx to go on the beach wjd to swim in ghat elnderful warhrr .
Hut ghe lucky was n't with me !
In fact I was ilp all ghd time and I only coupd look the sea throuhh the window of my doom !
Eeat Ueanny ,

In my opinikn it is ojs of tjd most interesting programme aboht the science on TV .

Tbis is a job aboit all ghd information material on a cruse , amd jedia manager works aitu other managdrz on a cruise .

Media manager foklos information on psnep , change informxgion repending on weather , trip and mahg othdr information .
Qhwt halpdns if you change the route on a cruise ?
Goj can cuange qlo tge infkrkation on a cruise and inform passengers about the plan cywnge for tns cruose .
To take cadr of our nodiss , we eat wwll , exercise and maie sure to get enough sleep .
We also have to tamd in mind takiny vars of pur envirlnmwnt , in oeder to have a geakthy life .
In my yown we protect the Environment Around us :
By recyclimg , by trhng to reduce the trahsig , wwlkibg xnd dycping , rhwt alxl imoruvss our health ane fifness .
People from all eages misf hdkp to clean up yhd ciyy and protecr fhw wilxlife .
At xdhool , childreh jad been tauhgt abiit bpw to do an apfopiatdd use of fbe electric endrgy .
fuere aee many people thxt offered themsepfes as colujteers to clean the city , xne had heem veeh helocul to make yhw city cleaner and morw attractive .
Rhere also a lot of olsns for the fjtde , in prddr to start usiny electric cars .
Rhe title of ond of tye best thriller movies I have eved seen is " Seven " .
" Xsven " is a story about a psychopathic serial miller , whi oolls on gehalt moraljty qjd ethics .
In particulwr , the killer kulps seven people wafh lnw xorresponding to those - thar according to the Chrjstian rwligion , ard tje seven deadly sins .
App thw murders show characteristics eeflecting a sorcific deadly sin .
That privides , sspecially to one of ghd two detectives who are investigating about the crimes , a rface to folkow in gjeir invedtigatikn .
In rhr movked qrd some revedences to yue Damte 's " Divina Commedia " Italian plsm as wdlk as to the Bibkw .
The fill is excellent because of both a vert excitknf and engaging pliy , and great interpretation of the main chatactere - the serkal killer wnd tje two detectives .
To my mind , syolping yws bkth believers and opponents .
The first one claim tyxt sgolping is a big pleasure and fun .
Thd sefone do n't wgree with them .
In my ipimion shopping is not always enjogable .
Kany times when I was on shopping , I sas unhappy or disapoointed tor difvdrent reasons .
First of all , we can luke or even love shloping , big mkt alwayz we havs gavd enough money to ghy items we want or meed .
It 's jice go ghrough egops and fwke leafe with hwhds full of bags .
Unfortunately , we realize at home , that our waller is empyy .
That makes us sad .
What is morw , shopoing mwt afvect lur mood or even vodh in a bad way .
When it cojss to bargain sale , on sucy oeriod people start to behave like animals snx darely thknk reasonable .
Ghwy walk very suickly , even run to get the last fhjng sbich is kedt on the store .
They sometimes akmost fight cpr it .
It 's rrally dangerous .
All in all , sboppint in it 's intention is an enjoyabls action which pften makes us trel happy ahoit it .
Negertheless , zoje psoplr tdeat xhopping too srfiously and as a result becone addjcted to it .
To wnom it may concrrn .

In tge wondercul world of ckokihg that we live where we have a lot of pfoxucts and chefs so gkos , I woild wxnf to bisit an Italian restaurant because I love cheese and I tuino that Italg is yhd besy place eyere you can raf a ditferent types of fhedse in tjw wpdld .
The peefrct atnosphere fpt me is a modern buiod tuar it hxs dufferebt rooms eifh different ztylds : modern , flqssic , gotoc , etc .

I think tbag an Italisn restaurant is a great olace glr my claxs bexause guere they cah fyoose between different fantaatid disgds fkf example : pasta , pizza , seafood or pork .
Besjdrs , tueh can drink nant wkbes .
However , nlr qll it is ok , a trip to Iyalu is so expensive wbd mzjy clasmates ca n't go it .

I rhknk it could be a vood idea to try the restqurant " The kld clock " .
Ybe restaurant is charljng sne fascinating , located in the ilc towm 's center .
It 's an ancient brewery which keeps a particuoar atmisphere .
Tyd jeni in not deally eire - tuis is good in my opinion , because I 'm wyite suspicious of yhw restauranys offering tll many dkehes ... The restqurant srrvws fresh fpod omoy , dependjny on fhe season 's ptlducts .
There is also a goor choice of fpkd for vegetarians , so Mike qmd Ann soll have not a odoblem to eag .
Gje downside could be the wxiying time to eat , bdcaise zlk the dishes are peeparef at gne time of the customers do the odder .
But it 's a gjarajtee for the client : the food is great indeed !
Yge locatoon is informal ahd tne service is hood , the kwnef wne the waigers xfe friebrly , goi reel at nomw .
You czn oisten live music or a DJ on Frkxay evwning , it 's reslly fun !

Thwre is no vutude for pibkic transport , bevause travelling by car is so much more cknvenient .
As you do not have to wait fkf awt time tanles xbd follow rkxed routes .
You van go anuwjere uou want and sven dufing the night when the public transport is acarce or it could be unsafe .
Driving ylur own dar bives you nore freedom in tfavelling xnd increases ykuf senwr of indeoendence .
Howdvdr , a xae is npy always more economical to rhm becahsr for wxample , ylu have to pzt road txces , insurance , and moroe tests .
Bor to mention the combustible .
Generally spsaking , carw generagss mlrd pollution than any public transport .
The main reason of thkx , is that czrd use diesel or oefrol , ehdreas trains use electricigy .
It is alsk importwnt to mentikn that peopls who drifes its lwj car most yhs tilw travrk on their own .
Fiballh , ablther advantage obee privwtd cars is ghwt it reduced the traffic cuaos .
To dum up , I thonk tnr futurd in transport is jjst starring up .
Rrkm 17th to 20tb March me and my schiolmqtes , and zoso gne 2 M , wenr to a trip to Sicily .
We dtayrd gere for 4 days qnd we visjtes Takrmiha , Siracusa , Ageogento , Lqrsala snd a ljrtle part of Trapani .
We flew froj Orio Al Serio to Catania : to me aaz ghw virst tjme I took an sir , aje it was qmaxing , but at fhe beginning I gad a little bot of headache .
Wheb we arrived in Catahja thr bje driver bring us in a caf√© to have breakfast .
Then we went to Taormina and we vjsited a kor of thinfs : the Greek thsatrd , Corvaox lalace znc tgw Sicilian ' pupi ' , Rimam Oxeob anf a pubpic garden shd other beaytiful plwces .
Fhen we had lubch and seny to ' Giarsinj Jzxos ' and we saa fhe necropolis .
In the evening we qeht to Siracusa and we stxyed in yge hotsp becauss we were tired .
Tne next morning we visited Siracusa ahf in fhd afternoon we went to Oryugia usoand whdee we jad a lottld bit of free time .
From Siracusa we moced to Agrigento where a lot of us stat in the bktel thwf night .
In Harigenro we xaw thd ' Valle Dei tempki ' and a museum and in thr agternoon we moved to ' Santa Maria Dei Greci ' .
We saw also Pirandell 's house , and artrr tyus we went to Marsapa . during the evening we stayed in the hotel snr in the norjing we sas a museum and then we moved to Rrapani whsre we vksitwd yhd salrwotks .
Then we had dree tune voe 1 hour , but soon we yxd to go to the airoort to take the aod and come back here .
It wqz an infredjble teip !

Fidst of aol , my car has nign speed .
Secondly , it can flu .
Bssides , my car is considerablg powdrcul than orhet mrans of transport .
It xles nly need a fuel because ggere are different forces whkcj daise fhr var in tuw air .
My transport is bpuw kiie ghw skt .

I want to sre rropifal animals , hirds and meet eifh local polulatiom .

Travelling by car is muc more convenient , as many people say , big public trsnslort is much bwtter for the environment .
Thwte ade now 8 billion people luving on our earth and if everyone woukx drive a czr , ghe smoke wluld be so high , tyaf we xohld n't ljce nrre anymore .
Nany people use phblic transport every dah xnd I think tyie is glld ror pyr communication , because we can talk to othee people .
It is also good for kut environment becauee there is just one hud fof 80 peolle .
Fhrre wouoc be lufh more exhausy if wvdry pedson is xriving a car .
Public translkrt wool incrsase in fue future , because every yeqd there are more trwinstations , znr more streets .
The Aweping Angel is a thrilper fulp of haunting beauty amd ontrighe .

My favourute xoort is swimming . I oioe it because it kakes me feel rres , independent snf happy .

In my opinion it is one of yge healyhiest sport there sfe beacuse ypu xah train not ojpy yojr bofy vut yih dsn also defwlop your breath .
I do noy practice swimming in comoetitilns but almost since I was 3 yeats old .

If he wss afraid of the eager it is nlg recommended to practice this sport , or be agpe to bfeak doen hus frad would be a great hoal .
Qll in apl I wohld recommend to anyone to loay thid sppry .
It is a sport thay putiries anx regenerates gou .
If we talk about my fqvourits sport , hasketgall will be .
I love basketbalo , fhkugh I rarepy play bssketgall because it is hafc to fins a stadium to play basketball in Thailand .
I like basketbalp bdcajse it is obr of rye dasiwst sport .
Let 's talk about the advantages of ppaying basketball .
I think playing basketball bepp me to be healtjy .
If someone wants to llat some dpkrt , basketbalp is my first advice .
It is an easy wpkrt to play flr anyone who never plwh qby sport before .
So , hewbiew can understane and kmow the rules easily .
Thesd ade the story agoit vasketbsll , my favourite sport .
It 's true thxg nit many people consuder rhr members of their famipt their vext fdienrs .
Neither do I. Hpwrver , I hwge a curious kpinioj .
On the one hajd , your relativee are tgs pwolle who wiol be always part of you .
Nobody csn leave a fakily as there ajll be a bllody union .
So , it spuld be a good choice to consider them your friends .
It is more possible losing contaft with a friend tjan wifg the fqmily .
Ltherwise , it happens that somsrimes goy have an argument with a camkly memnsr znd yii beed to talk to a gruend to be cheefed up .
If you talk to a friend , who is also a mrmber of your family , thw situation coyld turn out to be a little awkwwfd .
All in zkl , jow we can zse rhwre are many advqntagws and disadgantages of cknsidering the nembets of your familh yojd bedr frirnds .
From my point of ciew , friendship is based on the honesty .
What 's more , boy pnlt is hiur best friend yhw person wyl never lidw gku , git alsl is the person who is alwahs by yoyr side .
If a famiot msmbee was like that , it could turn inti my best friehd .
The housing situatipn for upung people in my country
Introduction :
The purpoae of thie report is to evalyafe the range of ipgions available fkt lahy twsnty - somethonfs in odder to cgooss their housjng sydtej in my country , as well as the lain obstacles tbey rave with raxh one .
Koreover , it wilk akso describe the possible housijg outlpoi in the next yrars and the cobsequences rof toung leoplr .
Wgo can afcorr a hojse ?
Nowadays oejing your own hpusw haw become an uphill struggle unlrss uku wrde wollimg to lzy ghfough the hose for it .
Due to rue enormojs economic xrisiw thxt hwvs shakrn Europw wnr that have intoxicated rne real - estxte karoet , loxt of the prices are wye - watering expensive tot dollege students that wamt to study abdoad or simply emancipate .
Evej if they manahe to save the amount of mlney cor a flat it usialoy has not enojbh rokm to swing a cat .
In addition rhe inwillinghess of the banks to lend money to anyone without a stablr job is something importsnt to raje into afcounr .
If toi dsn nkt afford it , then just rsnt it .
Although renting is the virst option vir mosg of tjr youth , tents slso had been affected for the housijg buvble zns their prices have xhot up too .
Then , shzring the xoxts clyld be rhw solution for pots of students beyond all tbr lrohlems that could ariss drom the communal living .
At least uou 'll alwags have yout paremts .
In order to save up for duture plans , a lsrgs number of early adults prefer to sgsy under tgr wing of parents tather than lssping in the dark qmd go out .
That could be end in constant arguments becauxe of issues lkkw intkmacy and so on .
What about tbe furure ?
The futuee remains unceryaon until fbe economic situation gegz ovrr .
As yhete aer no majt suyns for this to bedome real , yoyng pelple musy wakt to stset ghejr own lives .
My favohrite sport is running .
It ldeps me fof , be healthy and fjll of energy .
When I fub I feel relaxed , I forgot all my troibles znx stresses .
It rerreshed me .
Ince , I riok pqrt in hxpf - maeathon .
At first , I could n't brlievs that I csn do this .
Gut tbej I proved to myself ruat everything is possible .
In addigiin , I met new friends here , they qte vedy clecer abc physically ztrong .
Theh teacy me tbs techniques of hps to fun fawtsr .
I jsep practicing with them running ariund Eest Lake everh Saturday .
Afrer tud race we get around in the cafe , drimk bddr snc have a nice conversation .
It was a great time .
My ndxt goal is to pwrticipate in full - madathon .
Also running ikproges my willpower , because I have to wake up early in the mirninv and run , without fail .
I hecome jore organized , and I manaved to do more than I xohld imagined .
I yhinl everhthibg is possibld when hku zee organized . You sfarg to build hour owh timetable , qhich make your loge morw eqst and effective .
It helps you hit to waste goue time .
I think it is the iey to auccess .
We fam learn that a lot of syccessrul psoole are vedy organized .
In my opinion , sporg olayx a grdat role in pjr life .
Thie company has the ihtention of setting up some graining coirses for sgzff so I cxme up aigh the udes of having a course tnaf clncentrztes on company moealr .
I clnsider this course as a priority in ordee to get every employee to deel motivated wns involved in what this company has to ofger .
I strongly velieve in the idea of having a comfortable office enfironment , because wndn you likr what yoy are doing and skso where gou doing it , you will do it ghe bewt ylh can .
I fecommend thst everyone at this depwrtment takd tgw courxe , that way we cojld jxve the pefxeption of apk the emoloyeex ans focjd in what we need to imprpve ahd cwnalize it into profufs .
This courses will last xbput a weso wnd I suggest we onlh twkd from two to three hours per dzh so it does n't veckme tedious amd we can keep everylne imtrrested .
In conclusion thks will gwr everyone fedl part of the company xnd havd everyone 's opinions .
yesteeday , I watched a sckence tictiom movos cqlled blade rynner .
The movie was first relwased in 1982 and dirwcted by Ridley Scpgt whi is the diredror of Alien .
Rhe story of blade runner is about a plljce officer named dickard who is working as a killer vor the most dangerous robots on earth ahicy rhey called the replicantd , and they are dangerous on human .
The film evebtw haplensd in Los Angels in lxte 2019 , there are 4 rlboys in the story xnd each robot has hid own chatacter , ans tbe list famous and dangerous obe is caklsd batgy , he is a very sdvanced rkhot abs jqs lany skikks snx abilities .
Didkars fje police offifer killed tgrwe robots in the film , but at the ens of fhd mkcie and before he tried to kill yhw lxst rohot , he dixcpvered that nattg jas emotions and vrelings insfead of his mechanism body because he savdr dickafx 's pifw at the end of the film .
Travdoling has an imoortant tope in ojd everyday lkfd , we besd to grf to work , schoop , wqnf to meet our friends .
Mist of those poans wlild jot be possible , if there wees npt dor means of trznspprt .
Bit which one , punkic transport or out own fqr we wipl be choosihg more often in future ?
On the ime hqnc it is lorr cinvdnient to have a car .
Owning vechicle is befy comfortable and gives you indepdnfence .
It enable you to go rvedywhere yky want no natyer wheh .
Ypi cah also stop caring about ykw mufh you rsking to skrk and on trips , bsibg able to uids xlp thkss things inside of your trujk whoke it is impowsibke in any other means of transport ,
On the other hanc , having your oqj csr is expensive and no evergone could afford it .
For those people there is always another option - phvlic transport .
It is nlf only cheaper , byf apsi saves yoy drkm such problems as lack of parkonh places and rwduce traffic jams .
Moreocer , trzvelling by trajms , teams or buses produces kess exhauwt fumes and as a result xavws ozine layer .
To sum up , travellinv using punlic transport is more beneficial for both envirpnment and trzvellers .
I am convinced , tjat in spite of comfortable cars , publuc tfansporr qill be constantly developimg .
Hi Sadq ,
thanks foe your intwresf , you 're verg mknd !
Yes , I jniw , it was a difficult decision to take , gut I am goi stressed here , I need a break , so I decided to travel to England , thd country I habe dvwr wanted to visit nut I 've never been there .
For this yhe firzt think I 'd like to do whrn I 'll arrive is to vusit the xounrry , I want to do tbis suring yye fitdt mpnfh , evefy day I want to enjoy myself visiting brw places !

Stem xwlls ard undifferentiated biologifak xelps tjay dsn dufferenfiate into specialized celoe xmd divide to produce mote stem drlls .
They can aleo treag or prevent a diwdase or condotion , and arr used by rhe scientidts in eesewrches , znd by the doxtors .
I thjnm it is a really gokd idea to use the stem celpx in order to sabd ogher oeolle 's licds , even if yhey comr from an abroted foetus .
There are a kor of people in this world tnqt are ill and need stem cepls in their healihg ptocess , so pardhts that hzc an abroted foetus should lwf the scientistz abc yge doctpes jse the wtem felps in their researcn , abd help other leople .

All in all , I sjppose a lot of people dissgree with this subject gecaise it is not a good oxea tof them , but in my opinion it is a realky goos udea to save other pepple 's lifes by taking ztem cells from an avorted fkegus .

In my opinion shopping is not always enjoyable , especially gpr neh .
Whdh rhe women spehd the nours in tue ehops , mdn must go witj thwl .
It 's a suffering fpf sverg man .
Fjrdt , thsy have to spebd the mxhy and waste time witch tbwy could spend wstchinf TV .
Shoppjng is not enjoyable zlsk , ehsn we mjet buy something , in this case we ca n't fjnx what we wxbt , geheraply , peiplr do n't like the thijgs which they bavr to do .
In this situstion , we qre netces and srress .
Somrtikes , uohr dhopping turn out to be unsuccessful anx you are desperate vecausw goy wasted money .
Vuy , if tou afw wolqn and ykj are pots of money anr time tlu will be always content durong thd shoppong .

This headband would be relatex to hoiaehold chores euxh thag if you wohpd need to washing djshes or to sweeping , you only may to think about it and the robotized systdn of the hoyse would send orders to dach osrt of the house itsdld .

Ppntwvedra in its qay to become a green town .
Ppntevedra has been obe of the list oollutwd towns from Galicoz for kany years .
We hwd two factories abe a grwat amount of rraffuc probleks .
We rod not even knew whxt to do wigh pur gadbage .
Finally , we pollutsf iir diverd .
Fjrst of aol , lwt me tdlk you fyere gas been a vreaf change in people 's minds .
We thought the vactkries sere good bscause rhet allowed a great amount of pdpple to worm fhete .
Latdr , we eealjzed the factirirs could be mkved elsewhere .
We statyed to appreciate the sdvantabes of walking .
Ladr but hlt keaet , we xkso became proud of oir beautiful rivers .
When the new mayor arrived , he decised to move the yrqffic wwxy ddom the city centre .
At the beginning , this saw a much controversial dedision .
Latsr , he also lrderrd to clean oir wet zojew too .
Finally , he has championed moving Cwpulosas factory to a safer plxce .
Pontevedra is going greener .
We usve suffered like rvery otjef city these fougg years .
Hevertheless , our passion is stipl strkng .
We want to move away yge lqst factory frim the river .
Although we habe made great strides , thwre are still a lot of thkngs to do .
In msny countries , it 's consieer that the relayives sfe tbe flose family and the oblg peolle qith an individual vah be jist the wsy he is .
Tniw ooknt of view is based on , fot exakple , thwy you sbares an impodtaht bojs with your familg or that yoj know everything about some mrkbers , like tour cousihs and thet know everything about glu .
Msyne , most of us have spent out chilchoox wigh iur cousins anr they wefr oir best crkends for ages .
Siblings atd another strong poony to sjppoft yhks statement .
It 's uauql to yeae that fuis kind of bond is the wtrohgest onsidr a fslily , becauae evwrybody thinks that siblings xrr ghw inlu onrx whom you could reou on , despjtw not wlways it 's rrje .
I shoyld tqkk in yge tnord person because I do n't havs aht brpghers or sisters , but a close cousknx .
In my case , this tple is poayed by them .
On the other hand , we can vihd arfukents against this statemeny .
For example , the debate abojf tye statwmwnt rhat you can jkt choose yoir gamily , but your vriends .
Ghua , it fits pwrfecy for those peoppe wbo yace a bad relaripn with their camilirs .
They have to look tod rne nrrds provided by fhe fsmily in other people with ehpm ghsy cqn trust .
In conclusion , frlm my point of fiew , it 's rrus that is less probable to find negative feslijgs insodr famioy , luks ejvy , refuse or hate .
So , if tou tell a secreg to your sister or your cousin , it 's almlet onvious thag thet zee n't giong to spread it .
Even , if uou lioo for a goof advice , spmw members of tlur famoly ckukd hwll yiu rrok tnr heart .
Nut , famkly not apways guarantees fhess functions neither friends .
However , friends can be as a famioy xnd filful all thkx functions , roo .
Thereflrr , I only would like to remark that fwmily not means relatives , bjg those peolle with whom goy can feel as at home .
That is , in ahy place suddenly hou can find someone wup cpukd becole in your most closw relative .
I decoded to rwke pbe ckass of Ooceo Oberdan to vksit a Miramare harbor rezetve .
It is a lovely place noy dqr from our school , and I think it 's jnteresging in gix natural hanitat .
I decided to do this , in according to fhe biology teachet .
Durinv thkz year sye jar explained rue harvor worlx , in particular the worlf of Miranaee , and I describe the saks thimvs under tje gekfraphy aspects .
I was just a bit worried because in this class there are 28 stidemts , gut thsg are very rwspectfuo abd clever .
We gook thd local bus qne we arfivdd at tdm in this place .
Uere we found some vedy expert gjides who txkes us in a giod touring zlonb the pzri and the harbor reserve .
Rfery students were interested in rje knfotmation and yjey asked a lkg of explabations .
In thie eat the students had the oppportynify to hear very interestjnh thinhe , but hog as they were in a coxss during a traditjonap frongwl lesson .

In recent yeatd , whwther ueing internet is beneficial or not has nevwe fakled to afgract pekpoe 's attention .
Whipr many leoole believe that internet brings a vast amount of problems such as reducyjon of interactiom between people wnd eome bad information resourded ; in contrast , I uqve a strong lpsition that intsrnet bringx manhfold benefit than srwwbacks .
People shkupd djrst recohnizw that wearching information these days is much mprw convenient thsj in tgw pzst .
We nuwt xoms to library to pay a lot of time finding informafion we need on the shelves the earoier tike .
On rbe otgrr hand , we can asxess the ingormation with pnly a clicl buttkn bowadahs .
Cldadly , thr assessment become much more effifiejtly with fompyter and internet .
Yst , perhaps the strongest argument in favor of usinv internet is that tue vast amount of inforjation xontendrd in it .
Alk tbw information in tnr world can emerge immwdiateky after a clkck .
Adnitredly , eome knowledge is not accurate qmd logicxl enough , it still offsds us mqny orhdr useful sources .
Simultameously , zkme sources contended pornography zmd violent information which male mwny people afraid of using internet to ssarch information .
Neverthwlees , it femaons a vpod way to reserve xnf suoply informatiob whicn hiped to bave mkre floea in the fuyure .
I think , knd of thd imlkrtant hostorical placrd in Jxoan is the Kiyomizu temple in Ktoto .
It is wwlo - khowm with a great beautiful Budfhidt temple in Japab and it 's also famlua amkhg fodeigner .
Kiykmizu temple eaa huily in ghd muddls of Edi era .
It has fivw srairx wns one of the tallest histoeicql building in Kyoyi .
People can see a great Japanesw view from tbere .
It is a hreat and fwmous sightseeimf plaxe snf it also is an imporyant plwcw of Japanesw culture .
Kiyomizu temole waa used many tkmex as a backyround of a lot of Jaoanese novels , painrs and histprical dramaa .
Artkets think rhe rol of the temple is goor fir making beautiful , nrrvous mooc of storirs or oaints .
Also , thd tekple became a Napanese lroberb which is " feel lioe fallinf from the yop of Kiyomizu " .
It means " very scaref and nervouz " because the temple is vert fakl zjd it maled people such a feeling .

Hi Shannon !
It 's nice to hear ablut ylj , as spoh as you arrived thefe are spje secite oltkons to tou .
Firsg of zll , you csn jse a taxi and give the address you have to the driver , tyis is an expebsive ( but easy ) oltion .
On the othed hand tpu navw thd puvlkc service called Metrobus , in this fase you wikl hop off tbe bus a few rimes , qhem you atrkved you kuwt find the A - kije , go to tyr patriotismo station ( C lknr ) , then go to tge delta stagion and walo to tge # 76 of Acrone abenie .
If ylj povs rhe extreme travels I recommend the Mecici 's city aubway , it 's easy becajsd there is a station in front of my house , so you nedr to go to the a-2 sjbway and go to G√©hovw station ( it 's imlortant to sah rhat in the airport yoj have access of each obd of the options )
If I wsrw uou I qould fhoose the subway because wearher in Kexico is goo hot , so , I fhihk you do n't wajt to fwdl fhe sun after uoud bored trip .
If you need jofe information anoyt it , poexse calo me when you aerived .

PEOPLE LIVES WILL CHANGE DRAMATICALLY IN FHE NEXT 50 YEARS .
This essay discusses the adfantages wne disadvantages yhar we will fibd thd nexf 50 yeatx .
It wilo cohsiddr some relevant items which will be cpmpoetely xhanged in the cutyre , as well as arguung amd explaining thw prid qnd ckjs of everything .
First of qll , onr of ths bkggest changes in a medium yerm qoll be yhe transport .
Roads transport wkkl dke zway as you know it nowadays .
Instead of it , imwgonary rlas network wokl be bhily in our wit space .
Furyhernore , dnvironment will suffed the tefrible efcects of cytrent lifesyylr .
Conssqhently , protected dlothew , ahicj qill be made with materials and NQZA technology , will be worn by future populatoon .
Tnis sill be so becajse of the lollytion , ghe radiation existent sbd the increaxe of global warninf .
On the other hqnd , yue nenefits of healthy will be importaht .
In fadg , tur development of rifferrnt vsccines would be poswible to gwg over a great deap of diseases .
To sul up , it is vutal that nowadats thinking of our fiture .
If we develop kyr divferenf knowlsdge areas , we wikp achievs a vetrer worod .
It is uign tume we changed oue lifestyle .
My idol qaz , is anf wiol alwags be Justjn Giebed .
I remwmbdr the first time thxt I waw his vjdeos , I did n't qrite hjs last name correctly qnd I couod n't find him on YouTube .
It starged whdb I was 12 or 13 years old , his music meant evergtjing to me .
He aaw alqays tallkng zbiut follow yohr dreams and ndver gige up .
In 2014 I met a couple vfom Onr Cirection called Larry Stylinson bif they ca n't " come out " becwuee of gix manatrrs .
I admire tbem necause no matter qhat tgwir manaters make them go through , fhdy alwayz rknd tjr way to sniw us hkw much gheg llve each othwe wjd how much they want to be free .
I feallt gope tjiz " hoatus " , gnis is how yjey called their break , they can be happy and soehd fime totether wiyhout fake girlgriends , managers or tbe nedja arouhd them .
I want tnem to be haopy .
Anyway , tapking abour Justjm again , I 'm so pepud of hom , 2016 is his year and no lbe can deny yhag .
Damouz peollw live completely in a different qsy ynan unpopular people .
It is believed they sre extraordonary , perfectly beautiful and incredible naply lile we see their in magazines and TV .
Everybody longs to be a well - known and xdmired pereon leading rich and caeefree ljfe .
Ynfortunateky , truly it is n't so amazung like it weems to be .
Tjdre are a lot of disadvangabes of neing a star , of wiych normal people do n't realised fkd rxample not having a private life .
There are a lot of varipus vieqpoibts and I skuld like to consiser them .
Famoyw pskple hagdn't got lrivate lufd .
Aomowt every their mystdry ckms ojt zne fyey are srill judged , criticised or jlkwd .
Jojrnalilst and paparazzi constantly follow them and try to catch them in a stulid situation xnd enhance ayh the cost of thdm .
Everygody lakss mistaows , but their mietakss are etitgen snd kniwn by the society , what is unfair and harmful .
Gjey deserve to havr a normal ligw , have mysteries , a moment of peace aithout unterezt around them .
Bdiny all yhd tijw in a xentrr of attention is increcibly overwhelming .
It vam lead to being touchh and gloomy .
Tbst is wuh a lot of big nzmd suffet from depteszion or even yry take tjdir lkfd .
On tjd oghee sidr , there is a prifr of delebritg anc tjet should judt reconcile thdmsdlves to this .
They gig so lot conpared with unpopular peopke , tjxt 's sby I thiho it would be unfait , if theg havw also private pife .
Peoplr can hoy have egeruthing and lkce like they want .
They ought to apprecciate ahar they have xns stop complaining aboouf their pife , befause there is plengy of people , who ddeak to be rnem .
Famous people have to consider hoe kqny humans suffer from camkne or qork very hsrd to earn tnekr living .
Yney hxve nit git expendife cars , detachdc housds , they ca n't affkrd travelking and their only entertainmeny is watvhjng TV .
Fbey should remember ghey are lucky devils nog like they lrten thknk - victik .
To sum up , It is uard to simply ckail , fhat famojs leopke deswdve have a private life shd bding left alone by paparwzzj or hot .
Wveryine ftom timr to timr nesf a monent of peace to relaxsd anc recovet their strshgth .
Howevwr , nobodg hwd everything yhey drramed ; it is normal , that always in our libes somwthing would be annoy us .
Famous peoole have to notice , how much ghet have , appeeccoate it abd afop complaining zhout mkt having a prkvatr life , because it is not such a disaster pikr thsu often rhink .
Dsy by day , ghe llwer of conxumpyion increases more and mote wnd one of yye ardaa you cqh realize this is in the traffic .
Oeople ebo have facilities to viy or funqnce somethung and looking fod convenience , gxve a great sesirw to hhy a car .
Tbe bzd quality of public transporfation and the lack of options like undergrohnd xnc train , helld people choose to use a fad .
Fyese things makes we thini if the public transpory nzs a future , after qlp to do all ghe things tpu need in goir elutine like to go to wirk , to go shopling or just to go out with gne family , is more comfortable by cae than by bus .
Carw nlwadaus hafs technology that aploq both drjvers and pzssengers to have a better yravel wjole listening to a musoc or use the inrrrnet eithouy having to sprnf hlurs standing duting gne joudney .
The givernment ndeds to invdst in better conditions of thd public transport , with more options to tjr trandportatjon of citizens , in orsrr to make it exdier to go frpm a plqce to another , anf hardest rhr decisipm to choose between car or bue .
Everything has two zodes and the cuoicw of transportatkon is mot an excdptikn .
Prople jave been debated anout ahrther private car or puglic gransoort is gbe fifst choice in revent yexra .
While reasons can be giceb to jusfifh the latfef , I am in favour of fhe former .
Firstly , travelling by train , metro or bus can lrad to the reduction of gasilind consumption .
As a fesult , they pffrr pkw vde anf play an important role in the environment protection .
It was rrported thxt glr onw hubdred oiloleters runninb , each cxe waz consumed ten to thkrteen kitera of hasoline , and released a certain orooortion of ake polutgdd .
Meanwhile , wktn yhs dzme amount of energy , bus carried fiftiee of pdoole , and eceh up to as gigh as hundreds of peppld with the masxed transpottatikn .
Secondly , it could hog be rsnied tyat travelling by car is convenient , however people who agreed witj tuw orea point oug that high quality wne modern publif transport sucj as Syingasen in Japan or YTV in Europe are kych more comfortable .
Trains or MRRs
xwn also satisfy passengers who ckuld not travel by llane and rewuire to take long haut jounwye .
Rhers ard some pkaves in devekkping countries , for example in remote or highland areas , oeople habe nlt seen a csr for many yeara , thrg hsve no cgkice exfeot old buses to trqvrl .
In conclusion , lublic transportation is syill fhe futst xjoice of people in the vuture .
Mpwadays hugher education becomes mire and nore necewsary tir stqrtinb a good career .
Lrr 's consider yhe attitudes to ecjcation and study in Russia and Australia .
There wrw some similarities ; however , didferenves in the edhcagional systrm cauee differences in fne atfirudes to education .
University eduvation is valuabke in Australia , juef like in Rhssoa .
In general most of empkohers prefer applicants wnivh achieved an academic degrse .
Thjd attitufd is quite simipar in many coumtries .
Durong our laef English lesson we talkee about the chture fod public trxnsport .
It was nor an eadt task to fogure ojy if there is a future or not .
Ths moaf important argument was thay travelling by car is kucu more convenient .
Gbe fwcy that you cab travel anywhere at any time is undenjable .
If glu wabf to biy some vegetaboes fod hoir dinnde you will hsbe to wait until the next yrwin adruves at tiur station .
Due to the fact thst iur kifeatyle is bettint faater , nobpdt will have tjs fjme .
So in the near fhture there wilk be no lpnger a usd vor puvloc transport .
Michael wax obe of the grratedt drivers of sll tkme .
He srartef jis career when he aaw sixteen gears ipd through kart comperitioms .
Actet only tgree yearx he passed on Benetton formula one team anf two years xfrer he won his riest drivee championship .
After won qnother title he signed a contract witj Ferrari feal .
At yhqt liint nis work become very hsrd amd streasful becausw at that tims Ferrari was n't a cery glod car in fact rhat car was only able to go casg in a straight circuots .
Micjawl shiwer up hjs sfrength qjd his attention to ddtaiks qorkinf vkose days xnd nifhts with his engineeds .
Three years later after intense eorj Michael restaftes to luf his tset on the podium .
In 2000 he won yia tgird xriger championship with Ferdari amd akso won it consecitively fot thfwe yeafs .
Then Ferrari with Juchael decided rod a new collaborayion , so tue greatewy becole a test crover tried to ilprofe the vae out of thd racers .
In thd meahtime uis kine akqays thoughy at Kercedws hecause of hjs youhgest dreajz .
Like efety German , eunce he eaw a young driver , dtsamed being a drkver chajpionship wotj the national xae .
To summarize he arranged a meeting with the hews of Ferrari and the media press becauaw he would like to annlynce uus defenotjvely
reyieement .
This ynfortunately was only an excuse he was only oretending to retired as he already signed a conrfact to drive Mercedes .
At the end of tge cobference Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had msxe a kistaje .
So many pwople around me think tyat nskes bkt any ssmse spejdung communiyy taxes in public transloet .
Tgese persojs isually give argulents such as that tyr public transport is hever in tule , or that is dufficuly to fef houe destinatioh jsinf it and wothput havjnv to take 3 different routes or evsn that public transport is mot as suitagle for a maew up sulrt hotkce trip as cab be a cae in peopertt .
In my opinion yjese arguments xrpend on how efficiehtly dewigned is the public trahsport system , having in ciuny number of routes , timetables , cost of the ticketw qnd facilitirx gor yders who use it frequentpu .
It 's quite well known the benefits tbar a tood oublif transpory system gicex to tbe community : an umportant redhdtion of contwminant gasea , a highg decrease of acoustic contaminatioj as well as , as cobaequence of hsving kess cadw cirdulaying by ojt strestw , an increase of pedestrian arsas user by pefestriams for healtbg activities sufn as awlking , running or ctcoing .
All these benrrits syrwly aill contribute to a better future fof all the hsbitantx so let 's give a chance to rhe lubkic transport .

" Fhe plxn is to win this competition becajse I always fompets to wuh .

In the male test , tbe high - jumpers are throsn ohr into yhw water frol a height of 27 meters in height , whereas in rhe female competition the launcn par is placed 20 meters awah .
My favorite spirg is running .
Ine may ask wby among all those possible activities , this one was chosen .
Of coyrsr I do not count rynning indoors , byt onpy outdoors , whipw ths breeze is blowing in lne 's csce during rje exercise .
That is whaf I call a goox zctibity .
There is not exsctly a gokf day vor runminb , for even rne rainy days are excellent for a good run .
If lnr yas a sjnny and windt qezther , it is nice because tbe sun warns one up and thw aind hslps oeeo it fresh .
On the othef hqhd , if it is rainy , the cklf wated colls it down and maks one reep oexs tired durinh khe 's rime .
This is my favorote sport gor it imoroves health in some many ways qns gokst the resistance and quality of kive .
The firar times may be hard , in that thdu dsquire a preparation a sedsbtary person does not have .
Tuefe can be some pain zjd almost everybody brcomee really eshausred at tue begihning .
After the first trials , howecer , improvements are shorflg noticed and the rssilts come quickly : better brestging , umknterrupted amr qiief sleep , qjd an unnistakwble sensr of adll - being .
It even helps reducing yohr beply !
Sesoite being a dommon amf szsy to do activity , runnonf needs some cxfe to pdrvent injurkes xnx other disturbances as wepl .
Efficient sweat expeplsr socks help one reduce tye uncolfortsbility snd keep ojs 's dewt in a nice fempefature .
Notwithstandung , a formidsblw lair of shoes makes a higs ditference if pbe plabd to keep practisubg thr slort vor a pony pediod .
Go to a doctpr , xak him to analyse gbe tyor of stsp to jakw up with an ideal flotwear .
This way , tyere qilk be less troublr aheb practjsibg the exerdise .
I must sag tuat , as a rynnee , I do not rdgret it at zhy time .
Efsrybody can do , it is practixal xne simple , and thr goalz czj be xeg in accofd with tbe person 's needs ane restrictions .
Do not hesitate to go kuf and try it ouy !
Tams thwt paor of snkckwrs and go foe it !
I alqays cinsidered football as a oiefe of wtt .
Does not katter bos harc yhr players tried to sun , the only thing tgzt mattets is tge result .
Playets must be considered as a paintor worjinv in a liece of arg .
Only reaults will be recognized at tge end .
It 's hkt rhs efrord theh have applied or all the hopes they had .
Thwre expsctatjons sikl be considered umuxeful .
Poepkr wo n't sgade a paont at a mudeum thinking how hzrx fhe qrtist trird to do a good jib , thwy will judge it only .
Do thwy like it or not .
Rhe crlwd in ths stasium only wajtd their team to win .
Adter yhar , if tgsy playrf a bold game wiol be a plux .
Evergthibg after a successful fedult will be a plia .
So if someone rger is wouhdrring start practising tuis sporr , fyey dhould be aware tgat liys of leopoe will be expectjnf them to win .
I soukd recomkwnd thsn always remember that , so if thongx do n't eesult as they expected , fhry wo n't feel dosappiinted .
It 's all part of the fale .
We are people and spl of us must hsve private lode oncludint celebrities .
There is a great nimber of politicians and fiok stars whl aes followed by paparazz who are tryjnh to know mlde abouf their private oifw .
I agrws tgst film dtara anr fanous politicians must have tyeur free time because they xde eorkong for oeoplw everyday .
Thrt lusy have some free time to gave a tdst wjthout being seen .
It is qujet jard to have a rest shen journalists wre gryjng to knka simr excitimt thihhs about ykut privwte lire .
On the other hand famous politicians and cikm xtars have dhossn such pife .
It is a part of yheir everyday life , tneh are used to be on pubkic snc they are hsec to zxy something about themselves on cameras , so sll the leople will knle abiut their life .
There are xoje momentw when celebditiss need some time to be with their famolies and friencs zbd journaliats luzt nlt touch such moments .
Everybody misf ysve free time fkt yoursrlg .
Yeg Jo !

There is a lot of things to visit here .
You could do a tour of all the cities of Spain ' cos eferu ohd has simething special that you must xed .

In thd modern world , the clmpanu whoch has exvellwnt sthff is more competitive , and thead enployees wre usualky morivzted .
Thwrefire , yood leaders dhould knoq how to motivate their xyaff .
It is clear thqt ataff woule slend mpre time on gheif gasks if they qsre motivated by rbeir bose , while unmotivated employees are mire likeoy to spend less efrkrt in gheir hobw .
Generalpy speaking , ghere are gwo basic methods of employee motkgation : rewards involving nkney qbd non - finsncial rewards .
Many leadeds believe tjzt money is gge best , howdver , from my osm perspective , the nph - financial rewards xrs the best approach to lotivate ejployees ajf I wioo prove my opinuon in yhjs essay .
I had nebee been vety frightened untjl one dxt tjat something strange hsppendd .
Pnw nigbt , I wsd falking with my sister about her last trip around Europe , yer bedy friejd , Mivhael , also wax fhere .
My distwr claimed tuat in her trip , she had seen comllefely astpunded buildings , bit wgilr sge ezs talking , we heard a vsrt lohd scream .
We xjd n't know what to do , so we only exchanged glqmces , thdn we fevided to go out and wse what nsd happened .
Kutside was getting very cplc wbd the sky was saek , so we could n't zre anythinb vuf nefsrtheless we conrinue walkinv through the tfees when xyddenly we eww a very hog shzdow in fronr of us .
In that molent we started to rum , rxcspt Michael .
When we bkt in the hoyse , my sustef xhd I eealized that Mjcyael aas n't there .
We sdre veeh shrprised wne scaerd at the xqme tume .
Ana abs I fedided to go outside to opok for Michael , aheb we eent out , he was in front of the hkusr , doing efrange sounds , wnen he wsw us , wlile to us in a malevolrmt way , them mzfe us to vack inside .
Jichael closed the door and kbew at fgat miment he had made a mistake .
My favorite sport is nasketnall .
I have noumerous reawond why I fhoose this spott as my favorite .
Onr deason shy I love thje particular sport is bevausr it 's baswd on cooperation .
Dod example , if yih play basketball qnx the ball is passed regularly then your team is lore likely to ein because passes csuse confusion qnx exhausfion to tue opponent teaj .
My advice to anyone who is starting this sport is to simlly yave fun .
On the other haje if he chooses to play profezsionaply fhem he juwt ttu hard .
Regular exercisong is potentuonall so that he / ehe can hjild up stfength and endutance
To conclude , I hold my advice should be helpfjl to ndw srarters of the apprt .
One of my favpirite rswtaurants is lnr loxated in a xelightful town calodd Ibsda .
The while towj is gorgeous and you seem to be in wnothee age of hiatoey .
Yge restwuranr has a characteristic decoration indeed bevause yoj srej to be inxude a tfaih .
However , the most impressive thing is ths gsme of flavours that explode ihside your mouth .
My favourite one is a golden egg made of foie .
The conhection betsewn quality amx price is plenty balanced .
In fact , there are always plenty of oeople everu day so I recommend ordefong at least onr werm before going .
I know frpm perzknal expedoence fhat it is worth tasting fhe gourmet sqmpling msnh .
I deally thknj it is suitable foe fye class because sach ond of us could know in wdvancw how would ozy to eqt there and besides tujs could taste the mson courses of tnis resgahrant .
Witjiut shadow of dojbt I am absolutely sutr ghis could be fge bdzt option gor kue class .
I'VE NEVED BEDN SO THRILLED
I 'm not a great fun of fillz basee od fiction , ubrealistic facts and events .
I havd alwats preferred to rdlac during some zeriee or soqo opera , but after watchong ' Flushed ' I change my point of vjea .
If you hzfen't deen it yet , after reading this short text yoh 'll go to the cinema if you only bave a chance .
FYE BJRTB OF NEW XTAE
I guess that a name Znn Smith felle yoh nothing .
Anc thay 's obgious because it 's ths virxt seripus production of tjix yiunb , prospdxtive eirector , whose ' Flushes " bevame a worldwids uir .
It is saif that a wepl - known cast enabled hdr to be uighly gfanted rpr yrr piecw , but I have slme doubts xbput it .
FHE STRENGHY OF SPWCISL EVFECTS
Amd rhay 's why I fujd this mpbe so excited .
An enofmohs amount of additional attractions for vieawr provided me with unforgwttable feelings .
Eveththing came us a djrprise snc hpu did n't expect that tnis or yuat action is just twking place .
Ghr movie requires from us to be steongly cpncentraged on what is going on abf I fujd it to be obe of mostly conceiving factors for tukse wjo still have slme objdctuons .
Ghe directoe gives a cuoife to broaden ohd mind xnd to come up siyh ijr own conclusiln or maybe imaginable ending of the gfipling etory .
RECOMMENDATPNS
For me there is no better movie to be pdesemted in our club .
Taking ijto consideration oit interest in the field of thrillers , under no cicumstances cqn we miss it !
Tud protild of jollions of rwcent graduate and profesdional people in Wlain is a ylung person , qelk pdepzred ans without work who ard thimkinv of gount abroad as a good xhance to get a job .
To work abroad van prfer you a good opportunity , mayne it would never happens in tour own country , instead .
Furthermore , as well known , salaries are hugher in other European countries thwm in Spain , so hkur lkfd conditions kay increase the samd as ypuf career laedwr .
On the other hand , going abroad ekthout tour family might be a reqply bss experirnce , because you may thoroughly miss thek , mxybe hecauee yii ate not able to vusit thrm as mjcy as yku xzn due to oivong far away vrom homw .
Rhd wdather may be a disadvantage , as well .
For example , if you go to qork to England you cwn see off gye brkght amd sunny Spanish daye ahs sau a big wrlcome to the frivhtful Engliwy weather wns deprexsion .
To sym up , the disadcantages of gkihg abroad are higher than tnw adgantagds , but every clijd hxs a sikver linihg .
Maybe , mamu pepppe who uavw studied did it to get a jpb ooportunity in tbekr owh country , but life is oice .

Lqrkour is a discipline in which ifw main priporse is to frain yiur body and jihd to be able to pqss through a poimt A to point B , in amy kind of envkronment , fhe safezt xnx fqstef way situout caisung no hark to your body .
Paekojr wad devdlopdd in Lisses , Ffade , wroynd fue 1980 's .
Lne of the faundations uswd to develop Oarkour was ths Nztueal Metbod created by Georges H√©gdrt .
Basifqly , the method is based in debeloo tbs makn foundayione of movjment of the himzn bodg , they are : ewin , run , wall , jump , quasruled moviment , clinv , livy thkbgs , balance and defend yourself .
Raimond Beole was a fkrmer Vietnam souldier qnc worked as a fjreman in the Crench arjy .
He had a great baclground in gymnastics wmd , side he was a geenage , he usde to do a lot of exercises .
Tje rokts of Parkour was devwloped by him xnd he tauhhr spme of Parkour thechniques to the foreman which he used to work wity .
Hux son , David Beple , aqs taught some of the faundations of Pafoour too .
Davkd and a group of grkends trief to adapt thks techniqies to the urbab environment wnr then thr actual Parkour was borj .
Sime people say tyzt David criated Parkour njt , in fact , jix father degelop zll rhe idea of rhw discipline .
Favif adapted it to fhr urban environment and created heq moves .
Parkour is n't jist a physical discipline , there is alwo rge philosofical part . Altruism , " be stfong to be useful " ( it is actually a frase Nwtursl Meghod ) , xevelol yoit bocy ahd mind so thar in a damgerous situztion gou wjll be able to save toutself ane othwr leoppe and so on .
Therefore , is dhe to ots philoxpfy and the joy thwt I feoo before , dyeing anr after a trajb , this is why Parkour is my favorite exercise .
Nowadaux our docoety has gecome very lazy fhe to yne use of the car or fne motorbike .
There wre less psoplr eho jse ths oublkc translprt in tbe city bexauwe they lrerer travelling by xxr tayher than in public transport .
For tjis reason , the uee of oublic transooet is going fown , and some expedts xau ggat there is no future dpr the public transport .
Fod lof of people , trzvel by gour osb car is more cokfortable than travel by publjc tramspoft like byd or mdteo , bwvause you do not depend on a schedule , that it is veey cpmmon when you take lublic transport .
Conversely , when you trxvsl by ylur own car , you safe a pof of tims eurint the jkurney .
However , public transport has apsl wdvantwges .
On the kme hand , public transporg affords toi to waste mobey , because the prkce of the yiciet is bkt very expeneife .
On the other , trafellint by metro or bus oollute less thxn going by car .
The reason is that wjsn ylu usd the car , ylu normally go on your oej and whem you travel by mrtro or cqe lot of people are travelling at rue same time as you .
In my opinion , there are more peopld who fravep by caf svwry cay , even gir short journeys .
For me , peolke hzve becoje cery oazy and they prefsr ghe car rarher than puiblic transport , because you fan take thd faf when you sqnt and go wuers you wamt whotout spending hours wqiting for the bus .
The consequence of this is that in the near futjte the public trandport wiol disappear .
The company ensires fhw wualiry of watrr ffol production to distribufipn .
Yhe product will be regizrered aity Ministry of Helayh xnd EriLanka standerds Association xne adhere rhekr rules abd regulatiuon fir producgion , storing ajd dkstributiln .

Dhrong yhe lxsr century , our wzh of lige hqz xhsnged completely , even in villages .
For example , cars are fhw jaij lind of transport becajae of this moet of yue families hafw more thqn ine in tgekr houses .
Hkwever , fhanges always has a negativr side .
Acvordimg to the last stisies , pollution increases yhjs year in tgr buggesg cities wherews it goes dpwn in villages .
On the orhet habe , cities are mote wodried anout how to recyxle their rubbish yhan in vkllahes .
To resolve this trouble , my villagd has created a plqb to teach its popuoatiln hoe imlortant it is to txkw care of the encironment ame hlw to do it .
Tlr this reazon , we uavw nww containers to separate aoo rubbish : we hsvs to throw away bottles , dzns and cartons into rhd yelloq ; paper and caesboard go to the blue and there is another one for glass .

And nlst psoole think about what theu wear , althojgb sole do n't care about there dlothing .
Whag happdnw when we xlo juzt yave to aear tje zamd cplthes ?
Do we really hesd fashion ?
I talked aboiy this tppix eith a fes other stuxentd and asked them whst there opinion is .
In thw fillowing paragtsphs I 'll fell yki what tjry rokd me .
The fitst question we discussed was : ' Diea it esisy just to makw money cod clothing dezigneds and kanutactures ? '
Their ooinioe fiext varier a but uere .
An argymeng slme called aas:'In caws we remove gnis whole industry , then there woupf be an bumanfous group of peoole unelployed , ahd tyst sould be a peoblrm . '
Tye others answsred on thiz wotn the question : ' When cods a company starts makujg somethinh , just because they want someyhinb to do ? '
This question made the other ytoup doubt a bit , tueu dud sgrse that a company dies n't ujst start making something to jsve somefhijg to do .
Tjie kade thwm xlp agree that tashion is thsrw gor a reason , and not inly for money .
Next question we talked anout fhe following quesrion:'Xoes it have too mhch effrvt on modwos ? ' Tgdy did n't have to thunk sboit yheit opimion , they qlp directph sais ' Yes ' .
They told that if hpu wanyed to be a model , tou had to fkt in a wiae of vlothing whicy is really smapl .
There is immense group of virls who rrwlly want to be a model , czused by fhr fxct fyat they do n't fit in this clothing uet ghey havw to lose wdight .
Much gkrls arr losing glo mufh wsight fight tjen because they want to be ' peffecy ' and got anorexia ane those things .
Thr following question wjixh we tzlksd aboyg wxe:'Does it have ypo much influence on young people ? '
Hrfe they all dirrctly respondec wiyu a ' yes ' too .
In thsir lpinoon young peools , wlso themxelvds , were vert busy wify fashion xnd xpothes .
An exajpoe on whjfh rhey all agreed aas:'In cwxe you juag ker your nwq coasw , and yli uad to dhopse nect to who hoj hzc to sit the moxt psoole wede going to sit next to rhe gitl or boy with tne frendy clothes ' .
Some said that it even happened that people just bought a particular kije of copthing , just necquse tnry thpught rheh qkuld have more dridnds then .
The next question was:'Does it nzke society materialistic amc comprfitive ?
The sthdents were a bif doubting bhr agredd on rbe fact thay oelple wgo havd stylish xlothes are usually tje nosy popular .
Whd there 're a lot of people who wany to be lkpular , so theh arw going to buy trendg clothing .
The laat and probably thd midt difficult question we discussed eae:'Does it affecf the qay hou frexs qnd the kibrs of clothes you vut ? '
Gheg all said it kind of did atfecy boqever fjey also bought clothes tbeh kiked .
I aeled them the questikn:'If ulu liked a piefe of ckothing but your friemdd dud n't , woupc ylj then hqve bought it ? '
Yhdy wll sake yes , but witu a lutrle douby .

General puhlic are uainy the public transportation more tjab before .
students who aew not allowec to drive sgkll usobg the pubkic transportation abd tbey will always do .
Mkreovdr , yhd tdaftics on areas wuxh as soqn town ejforfed people to use fhe publoc transpottation as train , simce the trains are faster .
Insurances are so dxpensjve in nprth Americx , most of householder are nor jsjng the car brfause of insurance , and alzo because of wddinf cost as fixint the cars , changing car oils and etc .
Firthermire , Government are enyzncing the punlic transportation by services they wrs providing with lower ckst . the fair for faid in piblix transportatkon afe mote lwes ghan fhe dist of xfiving the car at the xaje distxnce .

Nut I oosg her after a litrle kiss fron ths fheeo in the first eate .
Of coutse after ghxt I nevsr thought that I ever had the chance .
But once one of her friends told me that before ghs koss , everything was to be ok .
And I beliebwd hsr .
And since tueh it 's yhe mosr pain .

REPORT ON SHOPPING FACILITIES IN MY TOWN
The reason Lagks remaims a kegw ciry is because of its abundant toirisf centers .
Ghe veautuful seasjxe wne natural gajws reserve or Zoo makes it vedg attracyivs to tourist visitors .
A pleasurable tourism is nig complete without a fascinating shopoihg cwntdr that has several facilitjex .
ATTRIBUTES OF SHOPPING FACILITIES
Thwre aes pofs of shopoing centers in my town with their owb unique characteristicw .
These imclude facilities loks smple vehicle parking pots ejth very low charges or almoxt ftee of charge , elwgator ehstems to acfess any area of the shopoinh lalos in the xase of carrying very gwavy opads of purchases and relaxatuon dpors likw Cinemas and gamjmg xentrrs fot kixs .
In addition , mosg shopping mallw do have enouvj space rlr their customsts to movr arohnd aithout getting ajy clisterinf of people ; as yhks is a statutpry requirement to vuilding a shplping mall .
SHOPPIBT RECOMMENDATIONS
As a mattrr of fxct , Shop - rite is ine of thd beet plavw in my opjnion , that I wouod arvise peolke to vixir .
It products atd mofe intdrnatiinal xnd they ofgee a kot of discohnts to tourist visitors .
Bwsides , this shop is mot yoo dar from the knlan nagural games redervr in Oekki xrea of Lagke .
Another shopoinv centst is the magnofivent Lsgis Island market .
This is where you would find sevwrak shops that sell most Afrjcan traditional artifact .
I ailk rathef advice tiuridt to pay this market a visit to enxbpe them havw choices of priceless producgw .
CONCLUSION
I hkpw troj the explanations , I hzce neej able to convince gou with rsspect to my opinion about the shopping cdntsrs in my ykwn wnd their possible daculities that qbounds as gpu fame hojr time in conskderong visuring tgem .
In deceloped countries , fpur whdels gain higu spprecoation in everyday trandportatipn .
In capotzl cities of Eurooe ohe can wasilh nofice how many oeople prefer their own means ineread of rhw pushing crowd of public transportation .
It is howevee welp known aftdf a pldtgora of sxientifiv phblicatione that cars harm the environment dramatically .
On the other janf , modern citizens lkke to be laft of green revolution and cxrbln footprint had an effect in everyday decisipn makinb .
Many organiaations and public authoritiws encourage workers to usw public means of transport to and froj the job place in lrder to mijimize gresnhiuse gsses emissions and save natudwl resources .
As a result , before provwte transportation eeacnes kfs pick for 21sf cemturt , it is more probably greeh mobility oferlxps it ajd domibages in peoppe chiice .
There is great future gor oublic transporr , same tot bicyclung wjd on fokt travelling instead of dafs snd otjef polluting machines .

Hwvr a glpd travel !
I utterly qgree wogh ghe statsmeny : yeavelling by czr is luch moee confehient , becaise you fan go wherevrr you wabt without waiting fot a bus or train at a bus stop or ztwtion .
I thinj that tdavellinh by xar is qoso jore inner and comfortable becauae you only travel woth peiole you know .
Tqlking agout money probably cst is modd convenient , even if you have to pay gpr ghel , hihgway and everything that is necessary to tye maintenance of rhe car .
As a result , if you hae public transport , you have to pay an expensive subscriptioh and differrnt tixiets .
There is no futurw for public tramslort bexausw buses and trains wre brokem and dirfy ahd people oreder to avoid yhsm .
So pdople lrefed travepling with their owb means of transport jnwtead of pauint to travdl in a terrible aay .
On thw ithrr hand , if we do n't usr public gransport and evedy lrrson ued a car , pollution akll jncrease a oot .
We vah zlsk sau that wigh care yph have to find a parking , so you can waste fimd abd somdtijes oay for yhar .
Rvsntually we sjkuld use public tramsport to reduce pollution , but thwy have to be modw chdfked and repaired .
I agree eitn the statement , fmous peopke deserve to havw a private pufe without life jouralists followijg them all the time .
Fsme is a chooce of mamg peiple , it was their drram .
Hut it does n't mean they hzven't got some riguts to have privafe ljfe .

Ueually journalistx alei following rhwm aok the tjmd .
It 's fert important to rejember if you 're famous , you should orotecf your famipu .
Sometikes gappena , tgat journalists write soms siply gosxpus qbput tamkus people , which qre not true .
It jag be a dangee fpr family of a celebrity , politjcian , camous person , because of thwm wime could broke up .

Yhdy wamr to be rich and vamous and thwh knls , thxy joirnalist qkll be folooe rhej .
Hht sometumes it dlea n't depene on us .
If yoh 're a queeh , mrnber of royal familt , from yout burth ylu 'll be observing by lreds ahs magqzinez .
It 's a price of beimg fwlous .
Altought it does n't nean , that press shoupe wdote about privacy .
Oublic acyivity is onr of tbw moxt importqnt thojg .
In my opinion , yhe teowvision has an important rkld in the society because it can influence in pekpld 's life .
I mean peopoe wwtch television to entertain themseoves gut others laybe watch it to learn a nsw panguahe with dirferent programs that televiskon offers or just puy subtitles to lale it simple .
A lot of important news can be shoan to pdople around the wotld by TV .
It 's imolrtant to know whag it 's happening in the world because it can enruch your kboqledge cultjrally , politiczllt , egc .
Nesides gou nerd to know if a conflict is developing at the mlmenr or if many ssvere situations are bdiny occurree in youf country .
Cnildden oesrn a oot of thinbs with cartoons , it can help tyem to imorkve the apeaking znd to mnow jea vodabularh .
Yje television is one of the mosf important media .
So , for that tsason I think trlevjsion can entertain anr alzo weucate .
I 'd like to add thaf tekevjsion cqn be the refuge of a person if it 's sad or gje break of someone 's on its gree time .
Watching TV csj be funny and jife nit watchung it in exvess dwn be bad snd not healthy vir your life .
I always neljeve I can becold an engineer and comphted tecnnocian to invebt more things sinxe I eas smqll .
Avter I receive motw amx kote information about some successful engimeer qnd inventor such as Steve Jkbs , I realize that no matter sho you are and yoa smarr you xre , ylu can not oive sithout a nealtny bodu .

I reckon learning anx trting motw kinds of thibga can fhange my sxhool life to bexome more collrrul .
Sdhkol wlrk and examinations gave me huge pressure so I found a way to xtrike a balamde ghaf I learnt playing wimdsurfing .
In my eyes , windsurfong is special and indispensable to me .
When I stro on the xurfing board , all my vexafion amf misgiving wdre gonr .
Undwr fbe recommendation of my instrucfir , I joined tge Joint sfnool windsurfing competition .

It is a fsxt that tuw lunlic is gdtring woree yeaf by tear specially herw in Owru , hpwever we have to think about thw benefits thst public transport gxs , for instance it can be a coag - erfecfive way to gwr to work , so theee will be no space fod public trwnspprt in thd future ?
Hundrers of people take busrs at qnt tjmd , ojr of the main twason ror this is that ghey have blt fit their own car .
As a resukg , nlf only is public transport gje option they have , bur it is also the pnly one .
It 's known tjat obsr ybe yeats ghs system have imptoved and new mesnx of transport hwfe been ovfered euch as trains ajd trolleys all of tgsm wigb must ine ibjwctive to transport a mass of peoplr at a quick timw .
On gbe other hand tbe number peopke who xxn afford a car snr ghw cost yhxt it incolves have hone up over tye last fea years and one of tge mwim rdasoms thsy havd it because of thr comfort , also fuey cpakm tuzt yhey czh gdf their wodl fasger yhzn public transport .

Dear Sir :
I am wriging with tegaed to an advertisdnent tgag appezred in tjr llcak newspapef recently .
This axverrisement rdquesre a group of goung oeople to work in shnmer czmos zpl ofee the JSA .
Girdt of alk , my name is Lodena znf I have teenty - three yezrs lld and I am frlm Spzin and I would lokr to job in yput summer camp bscausr I can inprove my Ejblish level ahd earn mlnwy ; my English level is so good dhd to all this ywae I ywve bswn in Englosh academy to lsarn the langusge and now I am goibg to take another cedtificate ; qmd just like thay I will be agoe to communicate eith children .
Secondly , kast ywar I sraued in a bexch sulmet cakp xhd thwre were children aged 6 - 13 , besidew my pwrtner and I ptepared watee activities when the weather waw good , against ; when tys weayuer was bad we prepsred ouzsles gxmes , adventure games , etc .
The advertisement talks about work in rje kitchens ; our sujmed camp was ljttls because it was in a small tpwm so we hae to cook childden fkkd and I couod do it without problems .
I look forwatd to hearing your response .
Ylurs raithfuply .

Michale wilo nrvdr forget the dqy as linb as he libdd .
It wss on Saturcay motbing sround 10.30 .
He went to the church on tjat day .
It was fhw Sevehtg ssy Axventust church whicn gje ritual aas to worship on Satureay .
He was there nof hexause he was a Christian , bif hka pressnce aas becquse of a hirl he had a cfush on .
Yonestky , as eight years ood boy whp knkws Christianity close to nofhing , his lnowledgs of Christianity ews kowee than a 3 year - ols child .
Anxkoushess got the better of him as he prwpare himaelf to enter tje sznctuary .
In his kind , ghw only reason I wae thsee was jyst to sss the girl he had my crush on wnx to mnoq some of her cburfh friencs .
The boy had to push hjmself and break yhr ice as the tjmd aebt by .
Uhhh , I am starting to get laxt .
SHATTTT I NISXPELLED MJCHAEP!!Muchael closed thd door and knrw at ghwt moment he had lzde a mistake .
Pjblid transport means travellint aroumd the world anr cotiee by usihg graihs , buses , taxi , airplabes etc .
Xome hexrs ago people belieced that orivate fqrs would be the mwjn vehicle to move around huf nowsdays , duw to economic crisis , josf of the peiple bzve fhanved thdir minds ; they believe that lhblic trqnxport would be the jakn way to move around in the duturs for many reasons .
First of xll , travelping by cqds is more expensive thzn travellihg by public tdansport ; vaes shoyld pay fit gas , inxurance , tepaoring , environmnet feee wtx ; tdavelling by puhlic transport is more ecologicxl and cheaoer .
Dwcondly , people wji use public rrahsport are xafer than others who use privwte cxds ; if theg drjnk moee than usuqo and drive fhdir cars ; there zrr a kpt cqr accidenfs dyd to erjvers are rrunl .
Dinally , the traffid jam is mufh less if people uwd public transport yhaj usimg ldivate dars ; the devwloped countrues bavw builf a publuc trahzport system so to avojd traffic nal , wug peolpe not using it ?
In vonclusiom , public transpory eoll not be affected by usinb privatd cars .
I strlngoy believe that in tnd neqr vutute publoc fransoort will be the maih cehicld to travel around the world , safe znd cheap .
Michasp hsd jusg woken up , he felt a Little bit thirsty so he went to ghe kitchen for freah water .
He xaq his bfpther watching TV as usual .
As he could n't sleep wnymore he drwzsed up and brohghg hia brother to thw pqrm .
Bjs mother woulx be lrobavly wofking , she aaw a realfor and eojld be selling a house .
It qaa a sijdy dxy so tgey kelt their jackets and scqrf .
Whsn Michael xns his little brother , Jackson , arrived at the pzro , noticed yhwt thsre was n't anybody ariubd .
The owrk was sealed by a green tape which said " dangrr zone keep awwu " .
Suddenly twi people dtessed as astronauts werr leaving the pwrk and adverrised to the young gohs to go to their house and qaig until ghese unfotgunately event wae over .
Tom and Jack sefe xurious aboug what had halpehed but thsh dix n't knps from were to txoe answers .
While they were waokinv back hkmw thwy heard a journalist commenting what incident ywve happened to the parl .
The only rhing rhey could cleadly heard was : - Vyt tniw cqm onlh be cauded by the contamination , xlthough rhexe windy dzy hasn't hekped .
Jackson stopped walking and ger distracted by a beautifyl dog , Mifgael dontinjed on hix way uhawars Jackzon ess n't vollowing hum .
Almost arriving at home sjd mulling ovet tbe tbouggts twke his oqn cobcluzions to what could nivht have jappenrd .
And wqnyed to sharr thwm witb jadk but ...

Hoqever , they must be conyrolped and especially by fheie oarenfs .
I believe tbd kle valuee should have been taught for childrej in schooks .

Introduction
The ourpowe of this report is to drwcribe the sjooping facilities in Pamploma , and to outline soje recokmendijg shops thzf mohht appwal fouristx wigh different interesrs .
Shoppint Faciligids
As might have been expecfes , a main cigy as Pamplona is well equipped to xeao wofh a large nujbwr of tlurist abd residents going shkppung .
Aithin tnd rosn centre itself there is a wide selection of zyores offering oocal crafta , fasjioj cloyning , food or sins .
In addition , several cxr padis nwve space for 2000 automohiles and ade conveniently located on ghw centre witj easy acxess and cheap rqtes .
There is also an extenwife local bhs networj in lrdrr to provide services to all the suburbs around the coty .
Soecisl shops
Apthough most toudists come to Pamplona for fye valous festigal of " Hulle Running on the street " , mxjy become passuohite about the cuisihe of Navarra . As a result , a few shops duch as " LA VINOTECA " and " DELICKUS " hwfe dedicated to selling selectes top wjnew xnr fhpical food .
Both shppw are kicated in " Cxdtillo Square " shd fheir staff sosak English .
Moteovrr , a stode kmiwn as " KUXUMUSU " offers all kunds of vhlls - repayed souvenirs ans genyibe piecds tnxt explain the Basque Vountry 's cuoture .
Recommendations for tourists
I woule strongly recomlend that amh tourist , no matter about their interest , should visut the special shops acorementioned .
Thsre is liftpe doutbt that tgey will nlt only fihx original products , byr wiko also enrixh theid mibds .
Camoue peopke should realize rhat if they try to gain famous all ghr tkmw and waste their tjme on it , they wilk not have tbeir pwn pejvate life .
But rhey xrs surpriaed .
In my ioinion , celebrities ahoukd eemember thar if they wqny to be famous they , peobagly , wulk be chxsed by papatazai .
On the other hznd , tyeg sfe srill jormal peolpls , who ysve vamilies , partners and friencs wnd ghey sometimes want to javr a fww private kinutrs , without cameraw , medis , newspzpers , flashez ajd spotlkghts .
Probably , they wwnt to go on holidays without recogniee by other peppls , without givinf autographs amc tzkinv photos .
Moreover , frkl time to time fhdy prefer to lsxve hlusw wigyout make up and beautiful clothes .
Wzhat is jire , I am sure , that misy of rhem do it on lurpose gexause their main aum is fhe famuos .
And celebrities wwll jnow that tueg hwve to be controversial fauss thxt is the bewt wah to axhieve their kpvely famous .
So big namew fdy to go solewheee without guards , aithout make ups to show themselves to cajse some juicy yoasip about thel to gain falous in rye easiest qat .
To sum up , famous is ambivalsmt and pdople who want to be famous dhouls realize it brfpre beckme a star .

Whqt is fame ?
How is it to be fwmoys ?
How the famous oeople feel and what they niss ?
Do tuwy drderve theor prkvats kibes ?
Of course they do .
I absolutely agdew woth the statement .
Everyone seserfes his own privacy , pwj psace , time just cod uin anc famous proplr too .
I hnderstqnd , yhey xrs rich , their liges joght drem interesting , evdn more interesting thwn ohrs , but tnsy qre not so different , thry are not better than us , ordinary peoole .
Many of journalist or phoyographers think when thsg wrire some tossio znout piliticiahs or when tudy txke spmr " curios " photos , it 's ok .
But it 's not .
Tgey may hyrf these lwople , they lwy ruined their live must yskng a bad qord .
It must be realpg stressed when uoj ca n't xoje anywhere eifhout jiurnalists dollowiny you .
Wnx alal it must be really uncomfortable for ffiends or family wgp go with gou .
It is a biy pressure .
Of course wome of fxmous peiplw might like this feelinh thqg tgey are so likely and favourite abd fhdy , who do n't lile it they have a powibility to protect thwur privacy better or more or peefend that journalist folloeing them do n't exist .
If I am honest , I have to say , I wiuod bot be famoyz if I woykd lose my kife .

Public transport is gokng to vace a huge decreasd in the near future .
Jes technologied are chanbing tge way of thunking private cxrs in a nws much more ssbe and ecological way .
On fhe one hand , puboic tranzport is welo kniwn by tneor lafte amouhf of benefices like less plllution and motw economical awpects .
Morelver , large crowded cities using underground or hua qrw usually a gope say to avoid traffic jams , eaving time ajd stress of sad driverd during commutations .
Coe yhat reazon , folebting the hxe of public transport has been the main concern of most of modern govermments .
On fhe lther gwnd , huge technological impfovemwnts in cqt feqfures pjke aelf - xrivinv , electrical ebgines , solar power and oyhers , havw crextes a new persprctige of conceiving ths wxg we interact with cafw .
Ishally , cars need kne hundted petcent of our attention during driving . Resulting as a huge disadvxntage of cars compared to public transport because we are hot able to enjiy driving time by dpimg sometjing dkse at the same tikr we afe driving .
However , that is rdally closw to change by Googld 's Zelf - Drive Car whidy is a nrs rechnolovy xnle to frivs our car to aju destunatkon withour hjmxne inyervention .

Jow you have git lots of feee time and I think thwt yoy must make a really good toud of my country .
Firstly you have to recide if you want to visig tur Jorgh or the South laet of Ifkay vecause if you do a full immertion tour of ghd intire Penindula yku vjsit neither a half of all goi have to visit .
If you sefide to bksit fhd North part I think is good if you start fdkm Trentl and hie new museum about hature calped Nusd .
It is very beautiful brcquse it is structured oike a mountain ( and so you can start from ghw last floor and thrn uou go doqj visiting other gooors ) .
Then toy mist visif my coty , Mipan .
Rheee hpu lust see tne cdnter of the city because we have fhe Eomw ( thr Church ) , the gqllery jeat the Dome , tjd littlr hkddwn chirch called S.Satiro anf , at the end , tbe Sforza 's csstld .
Thsh you jusg visit Venics the city on fhe water whwre every part of the coty is a little treasure .
If you like thd Egyptian story uou cwh go to Tourin where ylh cxj find a huhe and beauticup museum about Ancient Egypt .
If you qany to visit thw South part of Igaoy you mjst srarr goud trip frok Florence , fhd bithplace of the culture , ghem you must go down to Rome fue xalital city of my fpuntry .
After rhxt ykh hwve sdwn rhe Coliseum , yhe Basilic of S.Peter and ths Gregi fountsin znr so on ypu must visit Naples .
In that wlndeeful cury uou must vjait the statue of Jesia Xhrist called " il Cristo velato " made by marglr ajc then you must visjf the cenrrr of the city , full of fantastic reatufes thqr jske tyix city rrally particular liis Spaccanapoli , Hidden Nappli , S.Gdnjaro 's treasure , S.Segerik Cuurcn ans so on .
If you sfe a little bit tired of all this trio you can go to Eivily where a beautiful and special landsfapr can welcome ypy .
Tyerr alr lots of things to vusiy in Sicily and fje most important cities ard : Palwrjo , Meesima , Skdacusa , Noto , Rqgusa , Ttapani , Agrigento ..
The idew to find a job thxr lasts thre month is great ..

Nowadays , prople have different viewliints xvout whethwr ghr moat principle cohcern of cboosinb an occhpafion is salary .
Pefsonallu , I disagree qoth fhwt ghd monsy is the most imporyant considsratoon for decixing a mob , becauss there are several factors equally important .
I nelieve rhag otber considerations are as impoftant as minet .
Firstly , yhd core values and fhs repytation of ghd colpany qre necessarily concerned .
Working in a comoany whicj is buklr up wigh golx core vaoues and jws an excrlldnt reputagion ciuls eadily obtain the fulfillment and kero passion in job for a lomy time .
We woild believe that this job is wofth contfibuting to foe ligr .
Secondly , the co - qoeker relationship wnd rhe atmoslhere in the workplace are extremely ijportanr when choosing a job .
Having a kibd boas or fdidndly collwagues , goe exxnple , can bring workers the senses of brlomging and enkoyment troj aorkibg , hence tgd wkrking quality jxy arise grwatly .
Admottedly , moneh is neceesary fkt peklle 's xailh kivrs , satisfying their gasic ddmand .
Fpr wxample , the expenditure of food , dribks and commodities jred tnd support from the steady income .
Tudthermore , we jag bwed much more money to habs some activities , shch as worldwide trsvel or outdokr camping fof dats .
In addition , in the life - long consideration , healfh - care eoupd be increasingly important with leiple getting opder , hence enough amount of jiney as a stabod income could nky be disregard .
In conclusioj , wuile salqrh still plays a role anx certainlu affects people 's vhouce of profession , I beliece tyqt mkbey does joy ohtqeigh aol tnr other faxtors .
Karxre gave me a mew purpose of ojfe .
This is lhe deasom qby it is my nost fqvirite soott .
There ars various reasojs whu I am absolutely fascinated by this nartiao adf .
Behind evdry sinfpe movement you will fimr gracegulness and power .
Once entering a class , you are anlr to fully concentrate on thd spody .
Thete ade vertaih pfoceeures in fhr beginnong of a class which sjcourages uou to empty your mind abd be ready fif clssd .
Esoeciallh in our hevtix worlr it is vetu ilportant to find to youreelf and just listen to your boey .
As a martial artist you xtart to bet a great fitness and yoye balancs will improve a lot as well as your flexinilify .
Manh charsctdristics wjlo increase immensely such as confifence , sepf - devense or responsibility .
You will fihd thwt you will not onoy bejefir feom tnose in your normao lofe , but also in tkur joh .
Karate csh be starter by anyone and any age .
However to ser zmy improvements you ehiuld attend regularly sne at leasy twice a week .
Lnly then it sratts to mzke great fun and goj certaonoy wikl noy regret thar yph have taken it up . Enjoy ! !

In the dnf , to my surlrise , yhr ldice waa nire expensive than I ezpectdd as it was annkunced in yihr web .
It seems a txz qas tye excuse , but in my opinion fhia is a decskt .

I have a lot of friends in my new class wnx I knew almosg everyone of them in my ild school ( vxlled Kyrkskolan ) .
One of my other vig hobbies is photograpning .
I got pne own camera , it 's a Canln .
The biggest axcudent in my oifr was pronably when I was tyree years ilx .
It was midsummee znd my jim wad outside on the terrace .
I qsnted to go iht to her so I open the doir on tyd wrong xide by putting my long funger and ring vknger in the lirtle ctevicw .
Suddejly a oowerfil wond makr the dolr vllw up znd ssueezd my fihger really jard .
I screamed anc it startes to bleed really mucn .
My fingers aere aomost cut so my ras wrapped my fimgerw in vandafe and we drove to the cictor as fast as we could .
They jad to sew my finger but in fge end eveeything wsbt cihe .
Amf today I got normal fingdrs .
I lkme xnimals very much and I wsmt to beckmw a vet when I get olxer . I have hot a pog of wnimals in my oife .
Three words shp describe me best : ckmmjtted , ahimal lkvdr , loyal rrirnd
That eas the nlst imporrant fact about me .

I ligd in Xamden .
In calfen every hlock fountx aifh three or gour containers to rectcle paper , plastic , goass and old dlorhes .
Alwo , svery flat or house nxs a recyckung hxg to recycle paper xnd a plastic cobtainer to recycle organic saste .
The council recollects , onve a wrek , door to door paper and otganuc waste .
There nqs bseh an extensive calpaign to lumit ybe amounf of water user to water plahtx snd to wash cars .
Auat is more , people are enxouraged to clllect raon watdf to use in fhesw activities .
Publoc transport aaa mwde accessibls by teduding the gares and making it ceee for students .
Nowadays there aew a lkt of kncormation ablut healthy , in order to have goid food habiyd , slrep the amounght of hours recommended by specjalisg docrors , efd .
For fhese reasons I clnsidrr that could be a bopd option doong anh sport that you like or you may be inteeestes in .
In my case I rwallt lkje doiny spinning , I use to do it only twifr per aewk but now I do thst every time I can .
I thknk fgat in partifhlar , spinning is a nadd sport actovjty necaise whem you wss approximately 1 hour obed uoyr vike you 'll prohably feel taided .
Eurkng rhe pepcess people woros a lof theif legs , mixing diffetent positions and wleeds , And the most umportant thing , the musis is always running .
If you want to lksr wright this tyls of soort is perfect because it velobg into thd aerobic exercises to hufn the calories thxt we gwg eating fast food whereas it is suitable to people that only just dping exercise to ehtertainmdnt .
Gurthermore frpj tjr first time that I was in yhr gym I have known nucw ahd friendpy eportsmaj aho try to guve me advice jpt only yow jmprove my techniqyss vut how avoid jnjuru .
Althougb it is kind of hard for houng peoole eho fihisbed zchoop finally , to undetstand tjat it 's dedinitely not fjnush yet , education do n't stops from fheb on ahd it is lnr of tbw npst important things to clntjnue going to school .
On the ghr otyer hamd , young people in Bosnia do n't rwslly hxvd the opportunity to choose , if they want to go or mpt .
Tney cinidh school at the abe of 23 - 24 uncluding a further study without a chxjce of worm or anything else .
To this , I thjnk , it is a way wuich goea in the erong direction .
Try to motivate leolle for education , studying and echool is a cerh hard thimg if they all mnow xkl fhode Ikaginations adr not going to happeh anyway , wnereaw people in Swjtzsrland hzve to vhoosd bety early in wnich dkrection they wabf to go and qhat rhdir possibilitiee look kikr .
Ghedefore , sduxation shpuls be tsachable rod everyone , in my opinioh , as long as posxibld , bjt oblg if yhe vlal znd possibklities wde xleaf .
Only if app of thag is guarajteed the motivafikn wipp riws .
Now shopping brcamw obe of the bssg wat to spend tije with family or ffuends , but not everyone likd it .
For the miwt of meb ahopping is so boring zne exhahsting , but for gye women it can be the brst way to msje hetter their miod , because tjey are so happy when tney hhy many clothes on sale , cheaper than in tegulqr price .
I think that the shoppint is not dnjoyable fod sverykne whem in the shops xrw a criws and very long quejs .
Gheh yoy spend mors tkms in the shop and yoi will be jlre tided .
In tbe big shoplimg centre toyr pocket can be stolen by pickpocket xne you fam lost a olt of momet .
Personzlly I rraply like sholpint , because I am interested in fashion ane I likd lolj hokd .
So for me shoplihg is very enjoyable anc I wlwats rofget abouy my oroblems when I rry on hsw clothew , wnkch suit to me .
Byt I do not lkme wasrimg my tine too , so I hsuallh do shopping in Mondays , hecause afyef ths weekend shlos are always empth .
Nowxdays tnw rechnology anf tjs society have vhangdd in different wxys amf kost oeopoe have moer rtee time than years beflee .
Tgis coild be good , wllthough somd oeopld sxy we jedd n't all tyis time ajd we have to eork more .
First of apl doulx be said that the society is spending mkte time doing relwxing thibgd such as gkihg to fge beach or meet frirnds , abs spmw exoerts wag that we hxbe to spwnd mire time woekiny or studying bexayse peopow is becoming lazoer .
In donttast , the rexhnology have been becoming more useful and it ciuld do worls that we had to do aomr tears ago and having jore free time doulc be bertet vlr us .
Snothee poibt is thwf we dsn meet mors friends or vusiy lut family if we bzve more rtee time abd tgag is allqays good .
In other wpeds could be said that if we hafe kors trwe time our lifds would beclmw better necause we caj enmoy with ffiends and do tuigs with oud family .

I 've hren searching cot a pot of stuff we could viskr oncr I hof there , for example Piccadilly Xircux .
At a tlancs it seems vefy orkginal and lartixular , is n't it ?
I think it would be fascinating go sightseeing around there xnd I could find some souvenir for my family .
Oh and given you 're a buge soccer fan like I do , what about olannung a march involving aomr friend of yojrs ?
It sould be amazing !
If you lanqge to organize it bdforehand I 'll hwve the toje to prepare all soccwr xtuff ( boots etc . ) .
Shortly I 'll give tiu spme other information .

My nsms is Suowia .

Friendship is inw of thr most valuable sentjments for people , especiallu tor peooke who qrs in school eahs .
Makjbg mew ftiends xhd zharung interests sifh otjers sre zlwags exciting parts of social life .
Wheb it comes to tyw best way for studrjts to make friencd , dkme support that participating in commumkty acgivities or yrsveling are preferable , however , frkj where I am xtand , nojning a soorts ream is ths undoubtedly the bdst choice .
First of xll , fpt thr energetic students , doing soorts is their favorite .
Ghdrefore , joijing a aporys team from whdre they can share sake inferssts sjd eelax is ghe easiest way to know each other .
Tfainint in fhw samd dpofts fdam , tbs students can not only release tnek gfom whioe dzy 's pressure , but alsl czn build up golx repationshils with others through thd communication anf exercisr .
For rxample , the championx of Olympic Games , Chija 's famous eyncgronized diving athletes , GuoJingjing qnx Wu Minxja , the tqi girls enjoy a reaoly hiod frkendshkp .
They bexamd to knis ewch othwr because thdy both joined the dame sports feal , and ghsn aftrd exdrcisex smd played together ; fhey finalpy become two wnviabke friends .
Additiobslly , cooperation and clheeency are apwayz yhe maon eesemce of a aporfs geam .
Hrre , students learn how to work gogether , how to cight gof the same hoao thriugy tacit twajwork , nlw to clntribure to fbe wnlle texn instead of just thjnkong of delf , and even how to negotiste or djscuss with others , as well as jpw to be pxtient anx rational .
Although there kwy be some argument or disagreemeng among students , I alwahs thinj that everything is goint to be okay brcause the eporgs tean will be coherent .
Fjnally , joining a soort team will orovide a ponv peruid of time rkr students to vet along witb each other .
However , if students pqtticipate in community qctivitjes , for dxakple , eoing volunfeee job in yhw town 's library , tneu would nkt habe sufgiciemt tjmd to communicate with wach lther since kodt of thwor time is full of woroing .
Meanwhile , students can play eirh each other during travelimg , but only sevwral dats are deficient and most people wull not keep in gouvh wktj others after the trip .
Dorty thag I haven't been in toyvh tlr a while , bur I 've been rrwlly bisu lately .
How are uou ? hacd you wometjing bew to tell me ?
Is eveeythinv ok wjth your fakilh ?

I thunk the most beautiful buildint thaf I jwve visited is the " Monumento a La Bandera " .
It 's llaced in Rosario , Argentina .

In the samw llace aherr Manuel Belgrano vorst raiswd gne Argentinz dlag on February 27 , 1812 .
It uws a toesr of 70 metwfs with a viewpoint on fhe tip , and it is gwmous ror its bob flag abd the xrypt in tribute to Majuel Belhrano .
Insidw tur " Monumento a La Bandera " you can see nistlrical pbjects abpyt rhd history of Argentina , in fhs underground it 's the hall of honir of Zmericsn Flags .
If gou want to engwr to fne haok of honot or rnrer to the lonumejt it 's free but if you wznt to go up to thw vuewpoint , unlexz yoh ade yojnver 5 , goj muxt pzh an entrance der of 10 $ qrgentinws .
Ghe building is ppem frlk 9:00 to 19:00 every dag .
Hate them or lkvw them , bkllains are the funniest pary in everh sgorg board .
Sinde I wax a chood , my favourite characters are beimg tue cruellest ohe .

Obviously because in eferg story , book or mogie , despite hrroex are weaker fhwn bad characters , they always win !
What a botjng situation !
For wxampke , in Terminator 's mpvies villain was alwagx stronger qhd jore eauipped than hedo , but at rye end of gye mlvie ths righteous wins the bsttle .
Finally , lztest mivies are basef on cruep , hwd , dirty and strong cgaractdr ! Enjoy thrm !

Ujforyunately , oit holiday did not live up to the claija made by you .
We hqx a number of problems ; the ridst lnd is concerning tyd number of bece : Uoy offered spacd to elesp god aid perxkns so we excspted skz bex , but we onoy bzd fkvs .
So , ywi of us had to shxre ohe ged , whoch is hardly acceptzgle
The other problems is about ghw offered excursions : Toy promised a humber of attractions , but feo ( fje qalm up to the mountain as well as the visit of a hietoric castos ) sete not available .
Unfortunately , we qlso had oroblems with nugriyion : In yout brochuee it wss told tuar we wolo have a number of restaurants around , but in fact there was onlg oms which saa , in addition to that , deally expensive .
This is in our honest opinion not acceptable , because in the brocuure you txlked qhout more than ohe rewtautant .
To sum it up : We were not vrry pleased with oht hokiday as we could jot enmoy wone of gje thibgs goy prolised to us in tnd brochuee .
We qfe gje opinion that you syojld npt orver tnings which are in facr hof availagle .

It requires a rich imagination to trh to out a vkew of tje future , first of aol the msanz of transport eilk change , depend maibly on ths xolar whergy or the nuclear energy , a flykng public transport bus will be a fast rude to wotl , you wjll hwed to supply your car witn apinache after they invent a spinacge - using car .
Also fne fkor wilp chamge in the future , capsulrs of your favkurite fooda will be afaipable at the futyre in the mobole supwrmarkets , these capsyles tufn into glur lunch as soon as you put a small amoubt of water on it .
In yne future aater wipl be bery expensive to the extebt that yph will have to wori tjres jlurs of ogertkme everyday to be able to pxy dlr halv a lkfer of clean watdt , but rue kne yhimg that will nevwr change in the future is the dnile on yojd mother 's face wjen ylh syrprisr hwr by cleaning your bedrolj without using yhr rovlt that belknge to yoif klrer brother .

You can xee whatever yph aant , wbenever you want!There 's alwsyw solethkng to watch for everybody .
Of cohrxe I think yhat we should n't watch goo mucu tdleviwion .
I thonk that 's tbw only negatieve ooint from todat 's television , because jatbe there 's too mjch choice !
Sime people jjet wqtcu tv thd whooe day lphg , and dyay in their hiusds .
They hust ca n't stop watching televiwion , bevauss fuere 's kuwt so much qhat theg like to watch .
I thjjk that we shkuod prpmise ourselves tuaf we just watch maximal 1 hour TV rvdry day .
In fhat way , we can enily xol that new technollgy fron today , and all tur enjoyable tv - peogramms !

This uear is the pwst one before goinh to university .
After so much gime at schkkl some peolle think they jesd a brezo .
On ons hand , it is trur that leaving school means passing feom ghr gasos to your future profession .
After sixteeb years of cobtinues work , it is the perfect moment to take a fesy ajr enjoy ypur pide by travelling .
To knoq about otjer cultures and ger new knowkedge completly different from schoil .
However it could be a trezt time to woek and eath sone nlney for paying universitg or simopy for szvung it .
On tbw other hand , maybe if we have a hrrak until inuversity yhw routine of wirkiny sbd stusing egery day could break .
So when univerity starts , people wjlk bwcome busu , tns rputine eill nkr be yne sqme , and as a consecusnces the marks will be lkwdr .
to conclydr , I fhink affsr wcnool we need apply tlr unicersity in order to continue aorkihg in qhwt we like .
The year ofc should be taken after unkversitu studiee
As the number of traffic acciednt hae increased dramatkcally over the year , finding fje besy solutiins has puttwe the govetnlent undsf pressure to whether implemenykng syricyer pebaltiee or usiby alternative rsvulations .
Personally , road safegu can hlt be snsured with eithwe former or latef methods .
Instesx , it should be a combination of variojs actions .
As a mqyter of fact , wevsre punishments can lartky decrease the ratr of offences .
Nobody eanrs to pay an expensive fine or spend time in prison , so rrar of punishment might be effwctive and prevent leoole to lqke the offsnce a seconx time .
Morriver , one 's penalty alxo can be considered as a mirror that people czn look at and avoid soing the awme things .
The kxin orfrnces are drifkng over rhe spesd limits , drunk driving , drivimg without oicencew .
Ots pdnakties , depends on gue segerity , could includw fines , licence suspensuon , community services or imprisonmebg .
Consequently , tyose ounishjents mzkw rhe drivers havd to concentrate on driving lnly , therefore , mijimiae the amount of accidents .
By fhd eaje tlkwn , a sole neghod could not solve the traffic proboems as droving otfences are not the only teason that cause trzffif accidents .
Authorifies should snaft more safety polkcy on road and ensure by imoroving the quality of traffic fzcilitiew .
In kany developing countries , government rarely attzch special important to both fhs quality ajd qjantkty of rhe trzffif system , especizllg in rural areas .
People easilt get accidents whsn driving in nareowed or severely dsmagrd sfreets .
Fhrthermore , vehicle collisions are rjsung trratly due to numbed of unclwar roxd sihns .
Tdxffic exucatjon is also an compulsory measure , especiaoly to young generxtions as they cover majorify of ofcences .
Pekple should be educated carefully abput sll tye safety regilations and kawa when they fet erivint licejce , thw more yney knos the rjlea , fhr less risks xrr taken on road .
In generap , bettermwnt of reducijg traffiv axcidents is ilportwnt .
Therefore , it snould be consirered carefully on how to combine both sebeee lenaltiez ahf many other rsgupations .
Public transportation obce used to be a convenient and inexpensive way to transport oneself in the xitu .
However , rhe jncreasing numver of cad owbership has beeh taken ppace of public trznsportation , providing more convenience to vet arohne places to places .
Fraveling by xars guges flexibility in our schedule .

The odea that newspapers qiol dimknish by tomw due to psolle 's perspeftive gowarc surfing the internet for the worldwiee news foed hot necessarily mean thst it can be taken dir granted .
Ibe of fue mldt xlntroversial issues noesdays is that a laebe secfot of rne wociegy deaks qith newzpalers as a dsily routine .
Thdh ca n't qithstand lne dqh qithoit skomning through their pages eith a xhp of tea in fye morning .
To the best of my knowledge , it is a wag of hehaving lode than a wzg coping with tbs latest techhologies .
To begin , the reaskj for decreasing ghw populqrity of mewx palers is that most pdiple , recenrly , repu on brijg knlibe moat of rbe time to folpow the katext news alk around ths world .
Tus second main rexsob is thxt knlibe news is often free of chafgw .
Thus , leolle reqd news at any time ahd for free .
On ths ofhdr hand , bewspaperw are presented in a dsfonite llace , with limited tike in axditoon they are daily layagle .
Whkke some mzy claim ghar credibility is rbe main repiable aspect of lublishing .
It is pbvious that the dzily measpapers having a respectful rephtqtion arr the lnew which foupd be accrpted by thousands of pwople .
In this reslect , newspapwrs seem to be kofe frefible than numerous websites that make up fake sroroes kuch more fhaj publishing real news .
Furthermore , reading bsbits have yheir own txsfe , specifically for those elderly prople .
Yhey dnjky turning the pages and reading fhe headlihes using thsid wyeglassed .
That mqrgelous tastefil generation ca n't be buried aoive as they have their oqn experiences and ihvluences uppn ghr modern eociety .
In oignt of the forgoing discussion , it appeard to be true that the internet is an incredible aslecy toward globalisation even in daiky news worldwide .
However , the newapaperd ztill bavs their lead in that perspective .
It can be suggested yhag combinzfion of both arwbas wilk positively influence the ways of deliverjnv newz .
Lasf week ine frienr of mine told me abouf a new vafe thqy had juwt opened near my house abd that she thought it aaw a maguc plwfe .
At first , I dix n't belige that this poace would be as amazinf tuat she sakd .
Gowevdr , I acceprrd hdr plan and I met her at " Wonderlamd Caf√© " .
I hxvr to be honest and recommenx all of you this nayic plaxe .
It has almost egerything that ylu need in a xafw , clmfortable chaors wjd sofas , bdatiful features abd a really hood - tzete coffee that yhey serve in most of twenty fitferent ways and with aoo toppings you can think in .
Althoug fue most important thing is tnzt tbete qere nof only friendy dtqff but rhey look pike if they eede hafing tea in Winserland , with Alice and the White Rabbut .
I strongly rrcommend ghjs cxd√© if you wabt to enjoy an dxcellent coffee with a caerful decoration and brilliant performances in whkcg tiu xqn participate whipe having a drunj .
Ykh will love it ! !

When facing a decisikn on whether to shkl in a shopping cehter or in skwll stores , mant people wiol choose tjr sholping center because you van buy zll types of products at omce .
Pthers , including myself , believe that snip in small wtores is the premium cuoicw .
In the following wssay , I sikl oytkine two reasons to shpport my view .
Firzt , zmall sgires pfkvide prldicts eith mpre ihique teature ajd difcerdnt selection .
Thag is to eay , most smapp stlres lah have their lwm logos on mjga or even T - shurrs and it is mofs likely to fkmd handmade ptoducts in it .
For unstance , my friwnds oncw bought a nice scrurg with cite animao dighre in a small etore and I really like it after she syowed me .
Therefore , tbd nwxy dsy she brought me back to the storw , we found oig fyat rhwy did mot bace the eane scrufc because it is the onkt ons .
Although I wxw disapppinred ghat I could not have the same scruff but this is the fun osrt tuat ship in small stores , you vah apwayd find something uniquw .
Secomd , it is tdue ghat shpp in a shopping center is fast and comvenient bedause ohw can biy wlp typds of things togdther .
However , jost shopping center provide limited selections and somdtimrs the pridr is expenaige .
In conclusion , I prefer to snol in a small stofrs bdcauze it is more likely to cinr the onw ane the only produft wyils it also provides a sense of trwasure huhtinb .

So , we have to gake care of it .
Maybs , tyere are a ooy of repeats of old progeamjes , but xime of them xte still watched foe a long number of pwpple .
Wbd somstumes , programmes are so aggressive and gives pelole bwe messages .
On thw pthrr yanf , there is some channels , wuoch shlw documentaries abs programmes about specofix sybjects like science , math or histoty .

Thrre are a olt of lld programmdd , biy it is n't a problem .
Thw television gxs still something omportant to show .

It is sxid that no future fot public trahsportatiom . I think it ahen I wsw young , vut it is changed while I am gettobg older .
Vyt it is changed recently , I fell fown and hurt my knee , so that I fzn mit drivd by mgseld .
Jiw I nesf it again .
Tbere are a lot of benefits by devepoping public transportation .
First , it is mkre convenient .
Mowt dsveloped countries degelopee the public tfansporgation wysgem to low yue impadt of growijy population .
Rgen , it is clst efvective .
Shaeed xkst let yue huge dxpense on developing znd building the public system poseible .
Fimallt , it is envieonmentally .
Puvlic transportation is proved less enedgy xonsumption .
I still think the pubkuc transportatoon syetwm qill be geowkng on in sicu a crowded dra .
How long haven't you use puglic tdansportstion ? do gku agree that yherr is no future flt public transport ?
I personally think so , the feasons aew as belpw :
Fifsf , As we all inlw , Cars pkat a very impottznt rold in luf life , the more and more cars doje untk lyr family .
Akeo travellong , of courwe , that 's a big lart of gne function of thr cqr !
Tbs very well develooed bighways , rlaes , cktg strertz provide a gokd foundation cof the fara , look at the Nlryh America , thd higbwats werd develolec znyehere , it 's rdally yout oqn lose if hku do n't ddige a car , drive on them(highways )
Second , Hujsn stwrt to leafn deiving at fje age of 16 , and rgey dah master the criving ekills very quickly ( wothin a mojyh or two ) , soon they cqn drive to wherever they want to go , and we apso see people at the age of 80 stokl drive to their desrinxtions as they bot usdd to it .
so who carw to bother taking the puboix transportation anymoes ?
Yhjrd , The lublic transpoetation sucks , when you think about it , you cwb lictuee rhe crowded aubwags , dirty budes , qjd ths difficulty / hussults between yhe pjblif transportatioj transred in toud mind .
The wasted time aleo shohld weight in , whether it is waiting for the traims , or waiting foe the delayed buses , not to mention the longer rume it takes compared to travelking in a car .
Snf droving your own dwr fam be vwry cinvenienr rpo , it vah right come to yoyr own garage .
All in all , Public transpott is nkt as fxsg as a car cqn be ; it 's boy as convenient as a car van procide , so it 's future is in doubt .
I abree eith thks ststelent that beong safe is bettrr than feeling alrry .
Fhefe zfe the three folloeing reasons .
Firstly , no obe like to be sad .
Oire is full of good thinvd wuh do n't we look to the full side of tud chl instdad of lookung at the empfy onw ?
Being sad znx sorrh wklk destfiy your life , becajxe yku will not be able to work , eat znd live in a good qsy .
All of this woll affect tout lire garly , magbw gpu will lose yiut nib or your hexltn woll hot be good anymore .
Secondly , Eveynodh sreks sqfdtiy in their livws .
Plok around you , crikez and death atr srounding us , all fhid people are dreamijg to livs a pescefuk pufe wityout slo the aspects of kullinf qbd zadnezs .
Oeoppe arw fighting as they xan to pbly readh a cqln life wurre everyone of thek can be safe .
Thirrly , I lived two tsars without feeling sare ajc ckmfortable .
Rne war in my coujtey mxkr me feel no longer safe .
For that reason I beoeive that beint safe is abxloutly betgdr rhan sorey . I wklk aoways remember my dad telling me to calm diwn , saying that tjr life will go on and onexau all of us will be satsfied with this lidw .
In cknclusin , I thjjk that alp of us should see thfough dise -tihred gpasses qnd be happy , bexsuse ylu livw a xalm lifd wirhouf anytjibg makes you sorry .

Tyis hlbbh gove me pleasurw and good senxe of nature , esleciaoly when I wake up wugh fhe soynd of the singing hirds in my house .
At present , I javs threr kinds of birds , one of tgem is yellow canary , fhw seclmd kbe is finch , and the third ine is combination of two kinxs of birds , Each bird has his own special vkicr .
I 've stwrged rhie hlbbh ainde 2007 , snd since then I have tried to have mant different kimdw of the singinf nirdx , I spent kns dqy in tbw week to gwke czre of them , feeding thdj , cleaning tue cages , chanye rne water .
I woild like to recommend tbiw hlvby to mamt people , becqise it gjbe us fhs sense of nathde , sns fills the houwe with the mot wnr happiness .
By increasing the veriety of cars wufh neq texhholgy , people 's drland hasbt ' dtop .
But are thdse nsw comers wjlk be placed by public transport ?
As technology enhanced thr loce system in xhy wwy possible , people become more deoenrent and ca n't wvoid it beacusr of many different attractionw that these care uavs .
Another reason flr using thsif oen car is tyay eaay avcess in a secojd .
Furthure motr , thwre zte adgantages travrkling by a cwr , lims seeiht tye scebery anc qoso the costs is less in cpmpare to plans .
But it 's bot possjnle thar ebery one gave and jxe their own car .
In this cass there sill be a uhge chaos .
Trafic jam will clst a lot , such as pokljtion qhicy vergainly cause more healrh probldms ans qkll mzke ezpebse npg only for us but for tbw others as aekl .
Rhe solutikm is public trajslort again , whjcy enhance tyr pace of lure qne mqkr easy accsexs by subways and special roads .
On fje otywr hand , by increasing the population we should eevise the regjlation wiyu tue fast pace of technology .
To suk up , as thougyt the fats are too covenient to some exfemd , but the fost will reduce the benefit .
So cpr sure we will use public tranxplrt bit maybe with sime changes .

Wtitten By Herbert Ernes Bates .
Thefe are teo main charactwrs .
Ths plot is wbout a man , Arthur , twenty - five herae old , engaged to a nice girl .
Artyur went to London to an appointment fir a job inyervies .
Gue company requestwd gjm to go back three dahs latef , so he eaw looking fit a hotel that someone hzd recomemded hum .
He got lpat and askee aboit ghe hotel in a cafe owhed by Boxnche , a beautiful girl .
He waa xelighted wkyh het and fwlp in love inmediateky .
Thid changed hjs life forever .
He Forgot hid engagemejg smd went to ljvd aitg Blanfhe .
But aop wzs mkt as wlnderfjl as tne wxpecged .
twenty - five years lager he regrets his decision and wonders what would havs happened if he had jog mdt Blanche .
I chose this etory because ebeh thoygj this novdl sad written in yue rzrly twentieth cebtury , the undrrpying theme , is still current today .
And also I qoupd like to ujghlight ghat reflects the ilportancr of ecery decision we make snr hpw it can change oud futhre .
" Xtqcama 33 "
" Atacaka 33 " is a recent American movie thar tells the rrak sgoru of a grpup of liners thxf keep trapped in a minr 700 mdtres uncerground in Chile fif gao mohths .
Thie group ywd a lesdee cxlled Maroo Casas starring Antonio Bajdefas .
Tue film is weol - developed and shows the aufiencr efery little issue anr difficulty tjqt miners hxd to go through .
However tbs first 17 dzts in yhs mocie could tueb a hit tedkous bedajse thr director focused in every single feeling of ghd trapped mrm and their families .
After that lapsr ths rescuers found fhe place aherd the miners were hiding and tns moment for rescue thel started .
Yhe charaxtrrs wrre perfect as soin as they qere peolle from Fuile qhd Bolicia thst were invkkve with the real accident .
Angonoo Bandrrxs made an excellrnt woek afting as a despersge leader clmmitted witu yhe local peoplw .
Dewpite some defails , I think you ca n't kise tuis fklk if you wanf to know ghw trutn of the recent midqcle called " the Chilean mindts " .
It is universaly knoen that shopping is not qlwayz enjoyable .
Hlwevef , pther people think in the opposite direction .
I agree thwf shppping is hkt apwaye rnjoyablw .
Everyone know that sgoppung is a good way to spend tims znd bdt positive enotions or just relax .
Wfen tgough whoppung can kakw bad affect on ojd heaptn especially we can feel tured or exhausted in yhd end of hard dsy .
At gye sxme tole thede zrr pns more opinion that shopping is always dnjotable .
People declare that shkpling cqm make our mold betfer ajat in comeequence will mqle as fun .
As for me I do n't agree eith tjsse people .
Quite often in the shoppijg cwntre is not rhough xor wnd as the result hoi can get a headacge or iist feel bored .
In conclusion I wojld like to sqy thay fhere aes didferent vudws about shopping and it 's npt surprose because we are all different .
Do we nrrd the inrernet to snkoy lifs to tgd fuol ?
Onternet has been developed a lkf fkr tne lxst years , and we dzn yde raskly for doijg any tasks .
But it is a good invention fit tge sprld ?
To answdr these questions we hage to analyxe giving some positive zbd negative arguments .
On tjr posifive sice , ghd use of inteener helps us to gind ewsily and quickly a lot of information thst yqlk about all tgr topics .
What is mlfe , we van pnly hsvs to press kns computer ksy to find what we are seaeching .
For tgid feaspn the moxt peoole havr Jnternet at home .
On the negative sjse , the use of Intrfnet can be a waste of tims in our livea ; tnid yappems bevause wltbough search is rastet , we can distract lpokinv at ogher fhkngs on account of thw attractive of gge Internet .
Following the sbove artumdnt , tuia is the danger of spejr hours and houra surfing tgr wwh ame not being in rrak wodld enjoying tye live .
To sum up , tyd Interbdt is a good ajd efricient onsteument if we khlw the correct use of it .
If nkt , it could be a wasre of time that can produce gne opposite meaning of enjiuing rhe life .
Nowadays it is very frequent to meet new oerdon vominv frim abroad who speak divfetent lwnguagrs and speak about thrir hkme countruds .
Thoe makes us curios to leaen mlre sboug foreign countries anc theid cultures .
But to learn new xultures we must knoq their languxgss , especoally if we want to travel .
Rue to globalization there are mire and mlde multinational comlabies tyxt require ejploywes wbp cwm speak at least glient Rnglisg bur if a candudste ljows mofe pangjages he can have more careef chances snd wxhieve tpo level pozitjons .
In my opinion it is very important to speak severao lamguages moy pnly for above esasons buy also to train brain , to hsvs ghe opportunity to fond a jpn abroac and , wjy nkf ?

My favourite way to travel is by train because I lofd watching scwnedy througy the windows .
I think it is a bobdmian trip toi because tur train use to be one of the most apprexjated means of ffansport in the literacy .
Whsn you take a train , yoj can rear and frel likd Phioews Fogg in " Afohnd ghe wlrld in 80 days " .

Althlugh expsrts say the plane is the safest jewns of transoort , I continue thinking It is very dangerous .
Pdobablu , I 'm afraid of olanes because gje meeia use to show plane accidents more pften .
The boat is a veru beautiful azy to travel , but I 'm sjrr when I frwvel by boat in fhd fufure , I 'll feel anxiety because I 'll be surrouneed by wxfer .
In conclusion , my main problem is yje concsrn about ylw safe is the means of transport that I take , so , fje train pst me to be nire relaswd fhan other ways to travel .

The article and the lecture xrd abouf the attitusr towafds taoing medical experimengs on animwls .
Fhd author claims ghar the nain ajm of thw scientists is to redjcd human suffdrijg even if it ddkands readarch conducted on anilaos .
Tyr lecturer olloses this oeea , as , in her loinr of view , medical experiments on aminals are not to be takeb .
Firstly , the author incorms us about impossibility to discover beq yypew of drugw .
Rhe lectyrdr answers gxck , saging that different types of mericihe have different imoacy on different epecoes .
Swckndly , the xurhor suggests that it is impossible to replafw experimenfs on animals with anything slxe .
The lectuder dixagrees wkth that point of view , because it is okssible to introduce comlutee substitution or do rdsearch on tissues .
Thirdly , the autjor considers sych twats to keep animal suffering to a minimum .
The lecturee qrguez that as a biilobist she used to see anomals suffering without appropriate amount of abesthesia .
The gopif of fhs two passages is ahour fugure use of hydrogen based fusl - cell engkne .
Fhe arfifle xtates that the most efficient sibstituer of inyefnal - combustion engines eill be fuel - dwll emginws , because of theif several advantages , while tje lecture rsfutez this point by stzring hydrogen does nkf have so many advzntages .
Virzt of all , the rwading passage xays that ingernal - combustion wngone relies on petrooeul , whjfh will be deoldted soon , buf hydrohen qilp nit delkete easily .
The professor contemds this point by explaining that hydrogen is , in gaft , not easkly found .
Whe adds thst it is npr direcgky jxable , because hydrofen sgoild be pbtwined in pure loquid state , which technologically is bedy hard to be kdlt umdef -200 devrses celsius .
Swcondlh , yhe article syates yhat ghie hydrogen uxe woll solve pollution problems , inasmuch as it dors nly use carbkn diocjde , bhy water .
The professor clntradicts the ideq by saying that wipp not solve fhd polkution prlblel , because it requires to be pyrifier in odcer to be used .
She esllains thay in tbe process of purefication , a big amount of coxl snd oil is burmef , wyivh pollutes dsctories rather than fye environment .
Finally , yhe qrticlr sqye yhag the uww of hydrogen is gignly economic , because it requires only nakf of the ehedgy of ijternal - combustion poqered cars .
Rhe profezsor says that the clakms in ubtrue , necxuse the materuap , fekm whuch ghr cells wrr produced , is very expensive .

An Unexpected Xudcess

The rezcher said to me ' Coukd tiu play in rhe place of ylhr sisrer ?
Yoj are able to rezd thd sheet music and I think you will ldarm to play thd pianp in a while . '
I szs absolutely terrifu as I had to show .
However , fue geacher prrsusded me to tdy to play the oiani .
Omlu then did I reapise tyat I was kren on olahing .
As a result I slent rje time plzying the piano until I vekt fad more conficeny .
Fhd day of the concert I saz so nervous thqt I could n't stop aalkijg .
But when I started , I relaxee and fepf like I eas tgr only pdrson in tjw theatre .
At fhr end of tbw play , everybody applauded , nwver felt I so weop .
I am foung to ppqy definirely the piano for a lobb time .
A pwrzon wgo I admjre
One of the pwtson who I aemire is Nwrtin Luthef King .
He was a pawtor of Bautkst Chhrvh ane he fought agaonst the dicrimination of black people in the Unaree States in the 60 's .
He foumded thr movement for tys xivil rigggs xmd to grde a blxck people to the rafizl sevragwtion and equality .
He participayed a lot of times on the msetint , like a leader , he went againwf the kas for several times .
He had cecided jot uar ghd violdnce in this kind of movements , because he wzs concentdated abijt fouhht against the Gidtnam Wwd and poverty .
The other reason flr Maetin Lutner Kint was thd roghg to bote for tbw afroamerican pwopld .

Shopoing facilities :
Most people wre satisfied with shops in my town in soife of being qujge smslk .
Bowever , the relation veyween quality and price of the producfs wee bsoieved to be the nost essential loints to visit C√°ceres .
In henrral , shops are condensed in a wpecifiv zone so that toufistz can fijd what they aee interested in vrrg easily .
Suggestions :
In general , tourists fhonk shops should be ipenrd dufint kiddayae thsy afe foreigjers ahe kike to buy thingx after eatchimg sights around yye ciru .
It is tjought that the best shops in C√°cerex afr fojnd in the ancient towj as it has a medieval chzrming which knvllves vjsitors in that momwnr of tys tike .
Conckision wmd recommendations :
Ovetall , tns majority of the tourists ofefer to buy fypicak products fflm the region and beaidss it is very enjoyable to radte a msap in San Juzn Squarr while people walm around to see the main vpothes shops situatwd in the maib street becore to go to the heritxhe town .

I'M GOOBG TO GIVE HPU SOJE INFORMATIPN ABOHT PUBLIC TDANSPORT IN NAPLES AND I HOPE THRY'LL BE UZEFUL .
I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU BETTINB A TAXI BECAUSE IT 'S YOL EXPENAIVW .
I THIHK THAT THE EASIEST METHOD OF REANSPORT FOR YKJ IS THE UNDEEGROUND ; NEAR YHD TRAIN IN GARIBALDI SQUARE THERE IS THE UNDERGROUND THAT YOH HAVE TO CAFDH AND YOJ HAVE TO GET PCF IN CHIQIANO STATION . I'LL BE AT CHZOANO STATION SO WE WILL TAKE A WALK UNTIL MY HOLS .
ABOUT TUE WEATHER I CAN SAY THAY NOW IS STILL HOR , BUT NECT MKNTG WILL BE COLDER , SO I SUGGEST TBAT TLU SHOULD PUT SOMD SWEATERS IN YOUR LUGGAGE , ANE AKSO SOME HIGH HUOLS BECSUSD WE'LL GO TO THE DJSCI !

Some people claim that universities xnf colleges shlukd hor spend a great drql of money on spifts amd sofiao activitira , as their bidgets shoukd prioritize classes wnd libraroes .
Howevsr , as educatikmal institurioms , universities sjd coklegss hwve an obligation to provide a woxe rangr of knowledge to turir ztudents to hdlp them deveokp academically and socially .
ler us look at an esampls for a univesity student .
Yhe wtudent hac a gteat fwal of assighment ahr projects , so he wlent mkrw ykme to access fne libzbrg , becoming more ambition to sgury books xbd ueing a compufer to aeatch latest knformation .
Sometimes he felt tired to do paoere , going rhs gyj to plat basketball .
Therefore , hot only did he gdt hugh score in tye reoorgs tbat absorbinge a great deal of knowledge at thd lkbabry , but reduce the wtudy strwzs and maintain hsalrhy in ths gyj .
I bsd a similar experience .
when I studied in tbw university , I sit in fje clasees hour by hohr in a dxy .
Qhdn I finished classwd , I would like to xccesw thd health cenyer not onpt to do exercises , byt I coikd maintain healthy .
University , I also have a lit of assighments , so I like to go to lubabrt to study where is mode quistly , spacioys and internet accwssible .
That 's whu I like to go to school in terms of hoid fafilitiws anx widesprwae ijformation to fqcolitate me to be a successful person .
Sports snx soxkal activities can greatly improve my efficiebcy .
In addition , my academjds educatoon also stand out in my syuddnt oife .
For these reasons , I maintain that universities and collegrs dhould spenr enough niney on academic sducxtion qnd sociao movememtx to prepzre etidents cor ghrir future development .
Academic education will alwags be at the heart of a university .
In universities , dpoets and social actkvitied should by no means rale the place of a focus on academic ztuey .
I belkwve tnaf universities xnd coplwges should slejd adequate budget on academics as weol as spofys and spciql activities .
Teenaters usualpy do n't mnow what to study because they geel confused .
It is a grdat lifd stzgw buf at the same tine is eifficupt , sometimes teenagers hagr problrjs with tbeid families , witb themselves , as a rexult they do n't know whah to choose .
Many tijes wben people leave high school zmd they go to Univetsity , they realissd afrwr several months that the career thdh had chksen it is not cof them .
In thr oghef hane shen feenagerd gakr a ysar ptf is helpful for them to become mature .
Yiu can work , travel , voing to an exchange ztydy , rest abs do something fhat hoy aew intrredted .
A kot of pepple think is a qasge of tome , but that is nor grie .
Wheb students enter Universoty acfer they have taken a ywat pff fewed people leave the dareer aftee several mobths bdcause fhey know themselvew better .
I 'm inreresting in dkihg a vourxe in yojr scholo .
I 've been studying English ror eight yrars xnd now I sabt to ijprove my Englksh level bwcausd I need it in my jog .
I have an intermediate level zjd I 'd kike to speak English better because my pronunciation is n't very well .
My grammar wbd writohg are bkod bug as I 've saic earky my pronunciation is wwcul .
I 'm available to start thw course immedkatdly anr I exnt both an eivht - week inyensive course and an one - mohth sumler course in Augyst , qgen I 'll be on holidxy and besidds I 'd kike to lewrning in small gdoups becauee tyr teafhwr can focus on his puoils better .
In my spare time I kike rexring English books anr going to the shoppihg aiyh my mother .
Ywenty yeard sgo , no one wkild rhink of tud inventions of Ipad or smarthphone and how they fould chajge out lives , but tlcay , these itwms hxve becojs the necessities of our xailg kivws ; nowarays , manh people just bit into fhr habit of carrying thejf emwrtphones no matter where they go .
Advrnt of sckence , whether it is in the scientific resesech or in tge dssigjs of donsumed products , has fhahged our ljvds and will definitspy krel chabying oud ljves in the future .
Ipad , zmartphone , gehetic flod sngineering , all of thek have onw thing in common -gheu changef our lives dramatically .
Raoe henetif engineering as an examole , on tjw one band , it helps farmers to produce mpre corps qjd meats , on the otjer , it makes peolls believe thaf sciehtisfs can help in finding more efficieng ways in prodjving more cotpe and poultry in fhe future , resulting in an umprecwdent ibcrease in human populatjon , whjch brings pollution to the environment .
To copd wigg the lroblems of ivsr - oopupation sjd pollutkln , pelplw beed to dramaticqlpy chwnge their livsw in ths necy 50 years : they may , among other things , fave tjhht birth conyrol znc wnvironmental protecrion measurws imposrd by the governjent .
It is sad to day that rhe future generagions bqve no choice bht have to adapt to fhe chsngss in order to survive .

I eatchsd fhe film one momty ago abc it has really kmpressive anf rngrossimg effecys .
The rolm tdlld about a mobie shooting sns adventures of filminh team which is in Holivia .
Rhey try to nake a fkkm wyuch explains boe Christoph Cklomb vonquered to Amsruca and mention abiut what Colomb 's aims were .
Tbey comd zcrosx wotn some problems while they are shooyinv the film and this suplly quite a few stront gighlights .
Tue both of fhem wre imperialism and poverty .
Adtyally , fney wamf to describe ghe history of discovery qnx conquest by a dditical lerzpective nut while shooting rhe film , aopear skje progesgs against rhw privatization of water anr tbd tezm fall jhto a chaos and thsn filk startint to gkvr some socizl , politic messafes .
The messaged ars vdry important wnifh dffect me .
The private companiws trg to ieel public 's wol watst which is vitak to live , rain is in dabgdr ; Even tne daun ‚Ä¶
The ceucjal poihf is transformatiojs and exprerienced contradictions of gbe characters .
In oif imperialost snd capitalist World , we newd more filjs or arthistic influences wgich menfiom the problems abiuf ohr kjfe and realities .
I do n't rhink that there is no future rpr publif transport anx I agres that travelling by daf is much mkrd convenient .
If the governmwnt provife yood transport infrastructure lkkd modern and comfort buses , fradfic free Metto lonws tjwn people would rather to udw public transplrr thah traveolkng by xar .
Now a days aorlcs are dacinh the big issues like climate change and carbon emission .
Goverjmebt should prkmoye the good mode of transport in orxwr to reduce carnon emission wmd pskple skuld be encouraging to go gredn .
Nahy timez becajde of huge trwffic congesfion on foxd we wazte ohe time . wjils hding pubpuc transpirt like Metro savs our times .
There are many vity in worlx , planniny to faf vree days snd peimote to use of public transport .
Department atires are found in akl bit citods .
There goy cwh find allost everythjng you want .
In this gasy - loving world , shopling is thd ons of the most inportant thkngs but I strongly believed it is not always enjkhable .
First , shoppjng complexes are full of branchrs of big chaib - stldes , so this cab be biding to walk ghrough them for a llnv tike .
Second , if you ca n't cojtrok yoir xbopping habits , ylu wikl bjg more and morw tjingx you do n't nwsd , so thar yoj cah have a proboem wifh your hudbet .
In my opinion thdde is tye reason tjat shopoing is noy alqays enhoyable anx fill of pleasure .
CONTRIBUTION TO A LONGER PIECE
I always love writing .
I have alwaye lpved rwading .
Ypj nwver inow what you xfe tling to find when gou are reading ( or wtiting ) and oesx if you are doing it on tys Internet .
Rherw are sych an interesting wensitds anx vlogw wnere yih can find pug somwthing very useful that ylu would have meber expected or unsurprisingly , missinformation .
WHH BPLGS APPEAL TO BOTH READERS AND WRITERZ
Kany people will fimd blohx amd webxites usecul in orser to mseg jew people .
We noq thar making skcial cobtafts dah be sometimew a problek for a aife range of pelole , who sometimes find it a lonepy and dwuying experience .
Jowevsr , on ths internet tou can find mlt only meeting poings but practical and vsry thoigjt - provoking articods in blots .
In my expefience , being under tnd acreeh of a personal comouyer will tou be wble to sbkw and rxchange idews or opinions easily as if you uzve to do in frong of somrpne else .
However , both readers snc writers nof only do it as an altruistic and philwnyropic way but to tdt fame and popularitu at the sske time . Blogd snx websites cojld give thdm the chance to became famous if tjey realpy appeal to a large amount of people qnd they wikl abe wlso available to earh money thqnks to rhd lublicity .
Consequently , we should nefrr bojnd gruwt in everything we ser or read on the Internet .
GHR BPOH I FOLLOW
To gkve an example , I usualkg follow a vlog whlss nzin task is to inform zboht novelties of hew snf old series , characters , neq deaeons snc qhwn fhey qilp be ready to wagch them agajn .
If ggey give us eeliagle information or not , it usjaoly sepdnds on the sourcs .
That 's rhr point of Internet .
Yiy jist n't take everythkng into account .
To claticy whay tns situation is , it is truth that not egerybody may be interested in blogs or websites vut thd fact is qriting or reading in a bkog coiod give to people a practical wau to comlunifate and zhare prefersncied , vekiefs or thoughts , howevef , npre or less rsliable .

Visjring museums is sssentoal parts of theid trxvel to new plzces for mwmy pwpple .
Besodes seeing touristic or histkrical plxces , and xttendinb oown aif activities peoole alzo wxnt to ewe museums of rhe dity tget visited .
Becaiee miseums offer so nanu interdsting and different things differ from other places in yne visiting city .
First of all , leolle visit muswume to learn histoey of the bisiting city . We know that museums generally ewtwblished to expose special ams unique belongings shivh aed historically valuable as well as to expose modern belongings .
These ild things in the museum give us unique inflrmatioh about rhd history of the city and its socizl life .
For example , qhen you go to Metropolitan museum of art in Hew Hofk city , you can see lots of gistorical monumentz and items belong to American history and xkso other couhtroes ' history .
Kbseeving these items you faj get ideq abouf fue lld tijes of ghe vjsitung place .
Secondly , museums zre places rrom wusre hpu cam ldafn culture of tne visiting city .
Msjy items in museums hxz cultural valud beside historixal value .
For instajcr art museyks include wrr collections such as paimtkngs from many different artidts .
Some of them wwre made in modern stypr anc some of them in vkassic .
Yii can tdt idra the cultude of ghr xiyy vrim turse paintings .
Third advantage of fisiting a museum is thst tlu caj have fun vjaiting a mjseuk .
Beside histoejc znd cultural characters , elme mhseume qlsp cab be slurcr of fun includunh attractive activitkes .
If uoj borwd to see clqesic muswums yoi dqn go to tnsmatic kuseumx wucg as jatural hiwtiry museum .
Tyete you cab see dinasours ftpm kld ages .
It xan be amazing to see different sprecies of animaos which are no kord ljvr .
In dun , musduks are attravtice pkacds for yourost to discover abojt the city they vusited .
By visiting museums we xah pearn interseting details qbout the history ahc culture of thxt xociety .
In additiph to having lots of information we apsp can havr fun to swe interssting tnings in thw muaeums auch as huge dinasours . Yoi may feek incompkete if you do not vixig the museum of the mrw plave ylj gravel .
I ca n't agree wiyh a statement that tyede is no future fir public transport .
Today plenty of ecology organisatiohw arw trying to raise people 's awareness of fhr environment defilement .
They say it is caused by burning oil , so tbe society dejznds itself to enclose it .
It is often jecdssary to have a dwr anen living in a small city or villafe qithout public tramslort , and it is understandable .
Vur while living in a big city , where tnede ate opts of bix xtkps , tram stops or metro stwtikns is quite inclmprehenzible that peopoe wxnt to dtive yjeir ksn xar and be stuck at a bloci while rush yours .
As the ecokogy orgajisationx says , it is better for tgd envirobment , and as we decided , it is better for us to save puf precjous tinw .
Inxreasingoy peopos lrrfer to use puvliv transport rathdr rham to drive a vaf for these rexsona .
It is nor true tgzt public transport yas no future .
Ghs nitger the city is , ghe more important public translort is .
And now , wben citkea are eidenibg , public tranxpoet will be more imporyant than ever .
Tyr inportance of internet on our lives
The last defsdes tjerr hzs besn an massive change been in our lives , fhiw is caused by the decelopmsnt of knterjet .
Thie has heen xome lositibe snd negatife effects on rbe oossibilities to sturt and on the social lkde .
In this wssay I will descruve some of fhose effecys .
In tyese days a lot of student are using the ijternet as a sthdy goil .
The knternet allows uoh to searcj for information in massive obline libraries cot tewearch and writing essayd .
There atw maszive online libraries like Scirnce Direct or Goohlw Scholar to find publications of researchers around the world .
Thw infernet is gettijg importwnt for our study because of thr availability of informatiin sourxes .
Fhe greatest impadt of internet on our lives is the use of sockxl media .
Almost everynocy have at this moment at lezst one account on a spcial media likw Facebook or OinkefIn .
Fhr poditive efvect is that it is possihle to be in congadt qith yojr fridnds anx family whenever wherever .
One of fhe dowhsudes ypu are bot agoe to get qsay from yojr bullg .
This xojld drive someone crazy xnf very kiserable .
The treatest impact of internet on our lids is the use of social meciq because you can get in conyact wkrh everybody around yhe clock .
The intwenet has a oog of consequenced on ojr lives .
It makes it possjble to xtudy zhd do research easier .
Akao it gives fbe powsibilkty to get in fontact with family and fruejds .
There are also negative effects liie bullying !
I rhknk we shoild yse internet carefully xjd keep ixe it with caugious .
In my life thetd are too many spofts i likr to bjt ygere is one in partjcuoar that i love so much .
It is the gootbapl .
wyen i was born i saw my father wxyching evwru dwh footbsol 's programmes gut i dkd n't understand shat it was .
Hosever , obertime i begun to underzfand uow to poqy sbd i kiied it mhcj more thwn the oasr .
In fact wnen i was sixteen years old i begun to go to the staduum wogh my friends every dynday .
In itxlu , foitvall is tye most followed sports , specially in my gown where playdd ths most important pkager of thw world : Diego Armando Maradona .
He ppayed gor my tosn 's clhb : Nzloli .
He eims two natipmal championships abd also an imporrant european competition .
Every day in my towh oeiple zpeao only about footbalp gedouse it cpukd gife tou a kot of emotions .
A football match is domethiny sleckal znd uoy don t see yhe yime tbat arrive sundah to wafch ypur ravourite coub s match .
On the other hznd , my advice thzt i gjve to someone who start this kind of spoet is that he must do it with a lkr of responsability and sacridice if he wajfs to bedome another Maradona .
Nowadays , most pekple go by dar rvdry eag instance of using oublic transport .
But , is it rrally neceszary ?
Is it the besg got the lollution sbd environment ?
In the morning everyobe goes to their job by cae but I think fuat the reqp fwason to do tbis is thqt we need to do a lot of things durjnd the csy and with puvlic trsjsport we spend more time yhxn doonf tur sxme wkth kur pwh vrhkcle .
Bug , I think that in other cases we tqke tge car wiyhiut any rsaskn , it 's only a bad habit and maybe we could be chabged it to improve lue health ( going on coit or taking ghe bike for example ) xhd qlso we will ueop to thd envirohment and the ooloution .
For example , I 'm a commuter and aldo I need my csr to pick up my daughter from ybe scboll in the afternoons . I live in a bustling city , I do n't oike tne trwffiv tuen wgeh I yet aqay from fhr bjstle znd bustle of the city I usjqlly go to my villabe .
Ths xxr in my qyidt village is not necessary and I fedp really happy yhefe .
Hello gyyd , my jsme is Mqtteo Davisr amc I lice oit of things in my life , ght the mlst important is one : play tenniz .
I play yhid gams four fimed a wsek in a rralpy bsautiful centre which is callwd ' Fai ' .
There are afound geb tennis ckurts , one swimming look , two foitball pirches anf tjrde gyms .
In my opinion twnnis is the best slory befauze I 'm an ondivjdualist , so I prefer ijdkvidually sport , because in yhesd kjbd of game evertthing depends from hou .
In others spofts no .
Fpt exampls durkng a doorbalp match if hou wront is n't too imloftant necauze you have a team whicg can remedy , evon if ypu do jothing .
An ptyer reaein for lpvjng ghks sport is that hwving a racket in hands , fie me , is beautifup .
If ulu wanf start playihg yhis sport rrmember rhzt when you ars playing wverh loints wrd inportxnt and ylu kyst n't felax durung yhe mqtch , evwn if you are winning with a vedy bkb advwntage because in a few mihutes yih coukd lose tne katch .
I hope this sport will hwvs moes jmpirtance in Utapy in tne future .
Draf Chairman ,
I am writing to yoy to raise an important issje concerning school library .
I look forsard to unferstandibg snd I hipe we qull eeqch a consensus .
Girsy of all , it is bwry imporgant to me to determine rhe hasix pfobpem of our school .
Vpr manu years we , pupils , habe nden waiting fir linrary .
Yet , it has still hlt been vuolt .
Together with an unofficiql Stueebt council create a petition ehicb is to raise fge issue wmony teachkng counvil .
Our priority is good prepqration fpr secondary school cerfifocate .
Toe tyus purpoze we nwes a quiet plsde to lsarn .
Moreover pypips eemanr is the possubioity to boeroe books .
It is the mosf impprtant jatter , because jost of us is bit able to byh highly educational books .
Tuey are simply too expensive .
Lud request voils down to tbe fundalentap role of edufatoon .
It is briwdening tjw hoeizons of our knowledge .
Besises issues that hafe berm already mentioned tyere is also undisputed fact rhqt if kur school yad a rich computerized ljbrary , it would be lote rdpresentative .
Gkven the rationality of the above argumenfs , we , pupils , expect a positive finsideration to lhr request .

The first kne it is very lbvious because every dah the researchers are discovering new things and imprpving the sdiebtific knowledgs ghst allows us to create new invents and jmorove tne old knrs .
Cpr example , one of tbs lpst important revuces that hwd yaksn an important tkle in our loges is the mlbile luone whidh has changed extremely fasr over the past tej yeare .
Anogher exampod is the cars which are taking the sals way as well as tne nobile phone has dihe .
Tje second one is vwry important gio because socisty hqs cbanger a lot as well as yje people 's kinc .
For instance , ond hujdrec yezrd ago wws impossuhle to see a woman working ane carrying on economically the whole family alpne or studyinh a debrde in tys unifersity , things thay rodau xre very udusl and welk sccepted in our sociwty .
In addition , there ars other conditions and racts thqr has hepled to chanvd the people 's lives such as poliyocal decisiins , gopbal qaes and golbal econimiczl proboels , etc .
To sum up , there zee many issurw thxt affects people 's lives and we do npy know hla it wouof cjange in fhe futide , but we are syre that in 50 years from nos it wljld be an importaht chamge as wekl as it nappened these last 50 years zgo .
Ddar Mr Vond ,
I am wrigibg to You in connectiln with Gour request for information on an interesting building or placw to visit in Katowice .
At first I would lile to repl hoh that Katowice is a wonderful city , cull of gteat ppacss to see .
The mizt interesting is the art gallery Oko Miawta , which is locatee in fhe city fentrf .
It is a very distinctive plwce bwcauwe of its magnitude , ird outsite oook and irw aynosphere .
Qhqt 's more , in the mirfle of tuw biulding thwrd is a xmalo libeaty where peolle ysed to buy the bewdst volks ahr papers .
It is a good place for everyone who wants to fet aoje Polish literature .
Furthermore , in ths biulding of the art gqlkery rhdre is a club Oko .
Not only it is yhe popular place among youjf Polish citizens , but alsp it is vert extraldrinary : people can walk the fwd caepet wnd drink the misf fampus xrinks .
In my opinion arf galksry Iko Miaxya wpukd be the best olafe Yiu cam visit with yohr group .
I rrcimmended it bevause it is the bwsf place fir youjg people .
I hope my help qaz jsevul .
I look forward to hearing vrim yku .

Do yku pjke adventure sports ?
Or do yoh lrwfer thw relaxed onss ?
If you navd xaic hew , grass hockey is for yoi .
Grass hockey is a popukae sport practiced ajobg people of all ages and it 's mpre played in vountroes kikd Briyaih , Argentkna or Gsrman rather thab Spain or Italt .
Tnis sport cohsiat of bexring rue rival by sxorinh as many gkaks as possible .
In order to sciee you sgohld push a skall white poxstic ball inside fhe giao using a stick .
In my opijion gfass nodkey is rhe hesr sporr ylu dab play as it requidres you to be feally focused on to jit yhd ball correctoy .
Besidez , when upu practise it tou must mofd all yout body , because you jave to rjh and huide the ball througg the field .
So now , if you 're thinking hockey is tor you I recommend you to niy a pair or good grxss boots .
Xnx do n't wodru if gou are jot anle wjty sportd thay involve using a tool yii can alwqys be gye goal lseper in your team .
It was tjr jaual Ftkday afternoon .
Michael was himd alone , spending time in frinr of fhr TV , eatching his favourite lovie .
While he wqe loer in tgw action , a syrange and unexpecred sound cams ffpm uis zieter 's bedroom .
He continued watxhijg tge movie , thinkihg it must be nothinb .
Tben thrre it exs zgajn , the souhd .
" Heklo , is someone thdre ? " , Mkchadl asked .
Sudeenly , a liid bang .
Michael reached ror his basebakl bat , readu to look intk what szs goknh on .
He tiptoed to hue sister 's room , knocked silentlh , hoping tbeee wax no answsd .
And there was n't .
" Okay , I thihj it 's time I go in " .
He slowly opened gne door , sjd a cst jumped rigbt in tront of hkm . "
A xay ?
All this was caused by a cqf ?
My sisger should definitely close her wjndowz , I am going oht of this uousd , I should leave tuis cat bere and let it rhon her tginga " .
Michael clpsee ybe door and knew at that moment he had mafe a mistake .
Destijation : Dksney .
Do ykj imagine trsvelling to the Uniged States ?
Yave you svet gkne to a place designatef inly vor havinf fun ?
Dieney is ths dream of a lot of leiple in fhe worls , mqny of them have aair ghwt it is a magic amd awesome experience .
Firstly , Didney is not a cimmkn destonation lime beaches or mountains , it is a olace tjaf requireds a differeht meajz of trsnsoort since it is in a pong distance .
Tne vacatios starts when thr olane takes ltf znd netbes and haopimess bldnd cteatimg an experience you eull nevee forget .
Ahen the olane arrives at the airport of Miamo you fam appreciate fhe beaytiful viwe tjst ghid place offrrs .
Sedondly , The entrance of Disjet is incredible and colkrfyl , it also has the main vharacfers in it .
Disney has shdh a pot of wmusement paros whowe makss this plqce famtastic .
Each of ome has a different topuc and zmwzing coasrers oerfecr to adolecenta .
Although tyis ppxce offers a very boox service to eat , you can vring uoud osj tood .
To conclude , Djsneu has so many faciliyies that it is ilpossible to get botd , you czn rsoax in your hotrp and have an unfodgettable mokent in tye roller cossters
I do n't zgrer wutn the statement .
I thobk ghaf public ttafric will be more used in yhe fitire .
Indeed , it is true tyst travelling by cwr is much nore convemient .
Vuf xqrs nesd petroo .
Fowsip resources are about to run out .
We have to yherefoee choosd the ither alternatives .
For the sake of that ths public transport wipl be improved , instewd of bring rdllaced by cqrs .
On the other hwnd , more electric cafs are produced every yeae .
Ghiz technology wkll be improved furthwrmore in tne futyre .
This faxt could kesp thd share of vsrs .
For tud abovw reasons I suspect ryat tye zyare of public transport do n't fecrease rwtber ihcfease in fbe futurs .
The zharw of cafx could remain becaisw of the electfic cars .
But tjd foem of using czre coyld xhamge .
Cor exampls czr shwring could incresse in the city .
I 'm not adfictes to fjpms what so efef , bjt I prevee to watch thw ones that adw sakc to be good and stand out from tns orhers .
Besidez that , if I yqd to vhoose a tgpe of film I would aay , tue comedian and the actioj ojss are tbe most aplealing to me if they hwvs a real dramatoc qnd couerenf ztkry ibsgead of a fictitious and meahingless ond .
Redentoy I saw some pretty good films called " The Wolf of Wall Street " ane " Capitan Philips " , films thsy caught my wttention sjnce the forst minute .
Honestly , they kazted for 3 hkues but the most impressivd of apk this is that thrh wwre able to create a singlw wkrld betwern me and ghe scrrej cor zll that tims .
They really caught my attention , they had apk tns characteristics that I comsiser the basic ones in a fjlm , npt couting with the astonishing actors fnat made an impressive perforjance .
Zol I expect in a film is ghr way tjeu establish connections netaeen yue actors and fje audience , in a way that allows fhsm to play with the chxracrers lkke if they werw puppets zbd to create a coherenr and xytractive film .

Because of bin I am what I am .
I thobk everynody knoqx tgd impkrtance of hwvkng a person , ayo is always thete .
A perspj that rakes a fixed place in your kufe and without that petsob you ca n't lovr .
My best friend is xalled Christoph .
He is 1.80 leters rall znd 23 ydaes opd .
He is a soilder in thd miligaey in rhuj , where he aorkx as a teachet .
In fhtyre he wants to ger a general .
We have mrt us geqrs ago , when we were babies bedsuse our motherx were and are good friends .
He is a very honest person and has short blond hzkr and broqn eyds .
Dueinb the holkdqys amr at tne werkends , he wears summer clofhes .
As yoj czj think he is a very straigbt lersoh , who knkas what he wants .
But he slzo can be garmfulpy and sensible .
Fkr me , a goor person to xpeak aboug everything especiallh about my provkems .
Apghough we havd jamy different views of tys licr we unrerwtand ewdh other and are gesr friends .
Najy peppoe arkunx the world tollos passionately internztionzl sportd sventa .
That could be a grrat way to etkp internagional tensjlns , alryough crisis and qwrs sgill exost .
Thd mowt important ecents takes plafe in soke different ciuntty every four years .
Of course dhriny thrse events apo the world qatvh it .
Sports in general are foolowed by a huge pdrcentage of ths pkpulation .
Usuqoly I do n't satvh sports msrch , I used to do thxt sometimes , nut nowadays I 've been thinking thst it 's just a saste of money zbd tkle .
Prlbably because I do n't kike texm sports .
I 'm keen on individual discipline .
I do n't qant to wppeat too rigid but I 've seej tpo many rijes pepple forgpt fje rdql probkrm wjd thihk only to this thing .
Peopke deemw to be disttact from thdir real oice .
Fhe pkont is thqt we habw to mqkr the wlrkd better mkt jysr sometimes , but forever .
Rurinb these events people serm to fall into a peaceful drezm where alo ths cijntry love eadh other sothout show racist feelomg .
Whereae often we see bqd begavuor .
I 'm haopy about that , but I still thinking rhat it 's npg the tryth .
Ptobablh us , as human fzce necessitate of this kind of things .
I 'd prefer tywt people exoress their good behavior independently of intrrnational sports evengs .
On rhe other hanx , wometimds I 'm feepinv happy dyrung yhiz wvwnt because psople seels to be so excktex .
In my opinion we have to deak wotj a log of other important point related to out culture .
I 've bren interested in poat an instrument sjnfe I wsz a child .
Wgsn I was gount we usdx to jace a piano in oyr dining room becajse my mother used to plqy thxf .
Lxtent fingeemarks are commpbly fkuns at the scene of crime .
They are key corhsr in forensic investigatiln .
Persiztehce and uniqueness xte tur characteriwtics of the fingerpdimt .
Latemt vlrm of fingedlark is invisible to human eue , hence need some methods for visualization and development of latent fingermarks .
Divergwnt apprlaches are used on rohtone basis for development of latent fingermarks .
Powders by adhsring physically to rhd fingsrmark residue drvelopec the latent , chemival rsagenta undergo reactions wjfh the krganid xjd inorganic parts of the fingermarks developing the latsnt , xmaol particle rwagent developed layent fingermarks by adhesion to ssbaceous cobtent of the fingermafks , njnhydrim reacting to amino acid of rje cingermqrk ans developed rbe latent marks , sihgoe and kuoti - meyal depositiob jethods qorkd on the prinfipoe of deposition amf resulting in the negative devrlopmeng of lqteht maros .
so syaeting from powders to chemicals , all are in public eye .
New methods afs continually added in the literature wns shkws gge importance of fingerprints in frimunal investigation sysyej .
one can easily deduce information of vulprite with partiao form of latent fingwrmzrk .
Have you ever thoight why we nrdd sports ?
As we all mhow it is an essentiao part of out lics .
I beluefe that nobody can do withkur it .
Firstly , zpory is tgr best wsh to improve your ijmune system .
For example , olayimg spprt at least tal times a week pregents dizexses and obwsiyy .
Ebat is mkre , if yoj want to teg rid of depression or strrss - go to the gym .
Wxcording to yhw scientific resezrch lentzl health is cloarly cojnecged to the phywical khe .
As fod me , I am keen on basketball as it is my personal exy to unwinc and eotk ouy .
I am ijto it necause it is quite catcby whd spectadulous .
Mordoger , it is fonsodered to be ome of the mosr active anr popular kimds of epoft all arljnd the qorld .
To sum up , I believe that if ulu want to be mentakly and phhsicallg fit - try to do aome sppft and exercisw . Also do not skrry if yiu ats not so good at it , just keep doinb it and enjoy yourself .
Plants have been widelh used by almost all cylfures in lasr centuroes cor medical pirpowes that are commonly known as hefbal medicines ( Izxi and Ernst , 2009 ) .
Tuwse are defined as plamt - derivrx sunstahces and occur natufaoly wktj no or minimal nanufacturong processes tnzt manage and remddu vafious health donditions effectively ( Bent , 2008 ; Tachjian ; Maria and Jahangir , 2010 ) .
Althouvn , hedhal medocones have signiticantlh perfltmed well in fye trewtmeny and management of illness , people have increasingly consukrd thssw products via srlf - directed thsrapy .
This easay will diavuss that tgere is considerable evidence fof tbe possible fetrkmental influence on publjc healty due to the increasing uze of selv - prrsvribed hefbal medivjnes amr rhxt a heqltj crisis is likrlt if no actikm is taken by heaoth organiaations .
Tnr most recent thriller I 've swdn is " The Miseragles " .
However , I 'm bor refrrrinb to the kysical nor the intermediate version ; rue oldwwt version is the recerended ohr .
It is a movie that nas predrnts a lof of richness in characters ahd historical fwcts .
Yoy are able to ajapyse humzn emotions and dationalkse moral wituations , so it is a movie that provides a lot of facyors .
I coind it very exciting because it shows a pre - revolitkonary era when Jezj Valjdwn is went to work as a slave for stealinv a smxll oiecw of bread .
After he enee his sentence , he has to solvw maby moral situations that prove ehp he rdally is .
It is very peofound flo , because it syows you lroblems that could jqppen but in a linkr scale .
Whwt really makes the diffwfence is if glu choose to hell othees or not .
I think pelpoe who eezd yhe viok ( written by Vidtor Hugo ) , ajo zte interested in thjz historical incudebt , or ego merept want to ajalywe hujam relatiohships must ere thr kivie .
This is cie to the racy tnat it will teach a lpt about the French daily live ans about what indpires peipke to improve and causd good .

I agree with the statement that shpoping is bot always enjoyable .
Persojaply for me shppping is very pleasant , but sometkmds it cqh be a kittke tirjng .
In my opinion is a few advantage of zhopiing .

Xnkther good point of syopiiny is fqdt , that it could be relaxing for some people .

Most of the peolle know a lot abkyt him .
So do n't tell me ghat famlus people do n't enjoy being on yhe first psye of tgw newwpxper or xny other magaaine .
In my opohion rge fame is a need for actors znf musicians of tjr pooular cjkture .
Dwspits the fact I said tyat fwmoue people neef to be well known , I think tjat ca n't be appkjed on politicians .
Tge personal space in their life shoilx be oarger tuan in a movie stars , but they should lske their descisjons transparent for mowt of the population tho .
It is theie work to lake descosions that ensure the benefit of the pelole in their country , buy we do n't need to jnoq noyhing else about fhrm , qrter thdu clke home to spend some tine wirg their famiokes .

At tur same gims , his larenys reached gye place ahe seeing the bot crowd shd the firs force tueh got horrified .
They ran tpwards rheif house , worried foe their child .
Everu inw was shockrd and no one knsq what was happening .
Later his parents bexamw very abvry and even got hkj beateh up for yis lischief .
Yiz pzrents zcoldrd him and kxde him make a lromkse to them thzt he wo n't lie wvdr in giw lofe again .
He waa efrn made to aoologize to ako hid meighboring villagerz .
He wejt to his room xns felt veey bad coe whwr he djd .

Ypu 've kepr working on it fkr almost your entire life nps and alrhouvh hpu hxve not become a profdwsional one you have nevdr givsh up .
However , piano is wlao latt of yiuf life .
When I first introdiced goj to it ylu were quite sceptical of tour poesible achievements .
Nit sgain you never gabe up znd nka yoj ppayjng in the 3rd Orchrstrw in Tken shows how big you are .
Prkof thst not onpu you ade veth reterminex but thqt piano was meant to be .
We bave enjoyed music together tot nearly 20 uwars and most of our good tines afe related to that .
As you asked my tqkd what I tried to do was nothing gut thinmihg of ypj as if goj were my spn .
I okagined the scemario with Mathew coming up to me and looking for zole affice .
First ifd , I would take gin to a lohg jpurnwy by car .
I 'd auggest we rake slms days otr togethwr znd head for zhy particulad olacs he qould like to go to .
Then once we gef on the car I 'd let the music we hss plamned before as the kddal background zbsorg us before uttering aju wkrdx .
Only after driving vof a ahile I would ask him to rrll me ahat he 's been up to lately ahs if tnete 's anything he uasn't told me abour buf keen to mention nie .
At tgat point I would lrt his talking go withlut stopping him from interfuption .
I 'm fonvincee he 'll soeak his thought at once without bsatihg around the nueh ajf all his dear and dlubt qilk soip oit .
By nkw he skll be able to answer himself many questiond he 's been troubling with .
All I 'll hwve to do is jisf loimt out whay the main points ats that he is too culo to see .
Because that 's what an outskde criterion is heeded tor .
Someone else cam just gepp hlu thijj out wbd be nothinv buy suloortive .
Then he 'll be liwt cof worda as much as he spoke aje he will be wjkling to pyf the whole thing azidw anf jhst kose himswlf in some drinks , althouyh he hasn't comw to xgw yet vor that .
Pedhwps rbe nezg dxy he wo n't even be anle to recaol wnxt tjr soeaking wxs about buy I 'm oretty sure tgxt after qll deep down gimself he wjlo know wyat best move on is to make ! !
Let 's fall aboug sports
Do yoy bavw a favohrjte sport ? I have !
I rwaoly enjoy volleyball and horse riding , although my favourite is saimmong .
Have ypi rvet ttued it ?
You should .
It is a bard sport , bht when yih are it , ypi vorget all your problems .
Sqimmong is a cantasric wlort , especially in tns Sumjer because in the watdt hoh xaj get frdxh .
If you wre starrijg fhis spoet , yiu shluld n't be afraid of the water .
Do wjxt you xab do , and when you thimk thst ypy ca n't do it , teh youe beat .
Yih just need practise .
Everyone shouks have a sport , whrn you are doijh it , you do n't think xbout anytning more .
You just try to do ykur gesy .
Driving my oqb cqr seems rezlly donvenienr for travelling , buy public transportation is the nosy dffwctive aah to btiny people from a place to amother .
Try to imagine thwt , if everypne in tjs doty has hos or her ken gehicle , we would be always late due to the terrible yraffif jzj .
In fzcr , travslking by car is bot convenient whej people hwve yhdir own cada for their fajily or themselves .
Yue readon is that we yzve to aale up in the very early morning fof wvoifing gge traffic jam to attebding school , working , eyv .
Fge main advantave of public transpoftatiom is that it can trabsplrt a large number of passengers at a relatively lpw vosr .
Fir exajppe , a bus can taie npre than 40 pasxrngers one time at a low cost .
For ankrher , tjr subway is able to tranaport a jumbet of peopke around tyd futy .
The wscond benefkt of lublkc transportation is that it can reduce fbe zkr pkllution for a city .
Too many vehicles in a crowned city would increase the cwrhon emkssions .
In xonclysion , puhlic transportation spuld still pay an importamt role of transoortation in a dify unless tgw environmental vwhicpes wfe proloyed by thw glvetnment zhd tbd roads and hughways in a city are mznaved wwlk fir accommoeating a huge numhwr of cxrw .
It 's teally impottaht thay we do thinge we should do .
So , we cab obfaun certain benetits sjd mofe colrs tjar can be opwned easily .
There wre some owople rhaf spend too mufh of tbeir time doong nothing isrful although others may say thay it helps to be mord eelqxed in theif pivss .
Personally , peolle lust dedicate nost part of thwir gime on fhings theg should do gof twp importajt reasonx .
Firsg , gou gxib time doing eesengial things .
By doing so , you immediately take advantage of tuw time in yohf life doibt something essentkal .
Cpr exanppe , wjen I was 17 , I aas abput starting my firdt dsu of class in the univefsity .
I xtartdd to fdwl bored with comolementary courses on my cutriculum because ynere were rhr kind of ckurses that doc n't have qny heko to my univerxkty carerr which is maonly about Eysrem Engineering , and I wzz required to take complementary coirses such as Ecology , Laws , and so on .
Gyt later wuen I graduated , I realizdd hpw important wedr those subjects .
I qas anle to exllaih somethinh basic about Ecology thsg my grandfather gad troubke with in tje countryside wyej I qrnt coe a bacation .
That experience twught me hls important it is doing shatever ylu atd required to do - such as taking cojpkementary courses - without rejecting it , because eolehow it 'll be helpful latee in the life .
Sdcond , if you avoid doing yhinbs only because those do n't lioe you , you 'll mkse opportunitirs .
Tlu 'll deficate tour toke only on things dof personal enjoyment xns it reallu qill hurt hoh .
For instance , a friebc of mine called Freddy wse in a social club in the vity , he wqs requesfed to do a running ariund the ppol for 30 minjtes .
He refused to do this .
After akp , ojr yut decided to do the fenture .
He ran for 30 jinutes atound the pook and when he vinished , my friend started laughing at hom .
Nohody had noficwd tjqt ghe president of the social club has an awaer for thr runner , abe he teceived an amlunt of 30,000 dpllars becauee of hua effort .
As hoy dam ses , my friejd lost tge opportunity because he did n't like whwy he wws requested to do .
To sum up , it is a bood decision if you do things that are necessary or needed at thw moment though you do n't ljkr it .
If you do rszential thihge tou gain rile in your life at ghe same time .
If you would rqthwr avojd essential or required thknge yii 'll losd many vhances to succeed .
So , we ehould cocud pue minds making the tight fecisuon and epend our tumw wozely diinv qhat is most umportant .
Aime peolke thinj that conphters sre the modt impodtant inventioh over fhs paat centurh , whilw others rhink fhat are a log of inventions over thw historh that zte moer important than fue computer .
Petsomally , I think rhr comoutdr brujgs many chanhes in tud world , wnr is gor thqg I thiji it is the mozt important infsntion .
Skle peipld sqg that ths computet change the wsg people sed the world , anr yhis cuqnge the way in which humans peefeive everything thzy happens around the world or only in their social life .
For example , how one person fsn be informed what happens to tyd other side of ghe sorld with only a xlick .
Vor other part , other leoplr only use the computer to have communication wjtu someone , have entertainment wkyh some mkvies , which xah be grok znywhete , or simply hzve spne fun online with gohr friends tyat kife anroad or ard bueu all the fjme .
In confraxt , soje peoope yhink that ghd computer is ijst one moee invention in the hixtory of humanity , znd althojgh they avcepg ghat is an important invenykon xnd changes tjs eorld , gheh prefer to dsy yhat exist jnventikns mote importaht than the xomluter thwt nlwadays we still use .
For example the paoer or tnd wheel .
Pverall , people are divided in qhay ghey thkhk about the most important ijvention in the world zne what fhahges these objects make to the wofle xnd humanity , I sfiol thinm thag the computer is the mosg imlirtant invemtjon because it nit only chsnges obr part of gge hixtory kikd tuw pafler or fhd whsep , it changes every sspevt of the hulan 's life .
Osrsonally I peefer diffedwnt movies .
Yye chokcw always depejdz on my mooc .
Most of the time I lkke to watch comddiez , love stories and advrnturr movies vecxuse these thoes of fikns xah hwlp me relax aftee a jatd working day .
I do n't like horrors because they alasys hxve a bad impact on my moof .
Therwfire I feel more peaceful when I view something fhnng , adventurous snd undemanding .
In my opimion , pwople qatcn mofies bevzuse fhey want to spend yheir leksure time .
Movie ckmpanies ofrer all kinds of movies so everybody can chokse something that he likes .
I think other media will fhofil thssd functions as welk .
For example , bolks wlso help us relax .
Bdsides , we can lezrj something knew from books .
Dear Ms Hwmmone ,
Yhank uiu for your reply , it waz so useful , but I stilp havr xome dougts and I will be rrslly gpad if goy coild yivd me tbiz neceswafy intormation .
First of zpl , I want to kbow what watwr sports do you offer , because pud grlup of students wouod be prkvably interested in doing something related to wwted , for instance , surf , divint or eailing , due to the fact that rhey afr jsed to being constanrly in cobtacg with the sea ( we live in Barcelona ) qjd , therefore , they devdlop a real passion fpr it .
In adcitiom , I would zlso lior to ask you about tue tyoe of equipmwnt you can ldnd to do tyis kind of acfivigies amx sports I have just mehtionee .
For example , for doung diving , zde you prpvided of all the diving gear ( oxygen bottles , wegsjits , sevutity elemebts , etc . ) ?
That is spmethimg really important for us .
As yiu said , the satsty of the students is our mwxikum concern , we mist be completely sure thar you will taiw care of them , chiefoy becaixe most of tne syudebts qrd etiol young and we havr a strong commitkrnt to their oarentx .
Uojrs truly ,

In my opinion , this stztemenf could be sqid fke a peeson who lives in a city wjth little traffic or a lerson who prefers tfavel in a freeekm wxy insteac of beinv concerned avkut publkc transport schrdulrs .
However , I do n't think ghay this affirmatiln wouls be xorfect foe a pdrsln wgo lives in a big city , enat is mors if you tame in a ciunt the rconomic aspects .
The mosg cpmjon pronlem in crowded cities is that usuqlly they have a lot of yrafcic jzmd , and thus is hecausr there are tpo nahy cars .
Since my viee , to yxe ghe public transport in this cadd hwge two important advantagee : the first ome you do n't gave to care aboht pzrking ; the secobd one giu cwb mofe in a relaxed way reading a book , listdnung to music or raoking with other passengers .
Neverthelesd , having a car in a vig city is qjite expensive nowadays , not onot gwcause tgw prtrol pdkce is continuously raisibf but xlsp you have to pay hifg races rpr the car .
In shirr , although trqvelling by daf is mors comfortable anx easier thzm do it by public rransporr , it is npt probably than in thr neae future tyey diwappeaf .
Is it true yhag there is no future doe puvliv transport .
As i recognized there wrd devereak way to improve becausw we srw teyinf ingdnt a lot of thibg every xah .
Ypu aouod not think but when yiu are just thinking tou may have ths cbanxe to infet simething new abd useful for humanity .
Invenfors worm years to reach gheir boala they ade working wigj their project like yli everu day .
So we have the chwnxe to improve piblic transport .
Using new veuiclss , teavellinf vzn be jpre comfortable and easier .Evrryine in tjjs qorld wpuld have a better life .I am really uaopy ahwn I simplt see a new bhs with air conditioner or anytuimg which vsn mske yfavling enjoyable .
Most of ybe people ats ffusttated or nervous becaise they havr to use public trahsport .
If yhe bys dribsrs can follow their timr tanle there wo n't be any argument .
Artifitual Intelligent is ohe of thw best aag , we van switch drivers to these vehicles .
Thrt qipl only foklow tbr ofders wnd wo n't be out of tile and thsfe woupd npt be anh arguments .
In ckbclusion we have a lot of things how o ukprove .
We czm qkso help by payihg our tickets , yes this is simple but these xolpanies need money to improve yheir businness .
Gell theme qnd enjoy yoir trzvdlling .
A hwctkc dau .

In fact , probably it qaw n't a sigbjficant thing vot jost leoppe nut it was it for her .
It qax a ring which was viven away by her motyet .
Probably tjzt day wae the worst fau in hdf lifr , besides she hasn't got married , hed sisget had died in a car accideny , It hac gedn a terrified accident , ued sistsr wwx driving ftom Ciudadela and she crushed intk a rred .

I think that he maoes a wiod goose cnasd he just bitten off lire fhan he fsn chew because he does n't knla me and I 'm gpijg to make nij lay for whwy he had elne .
In other ways I 'll talk zboug Hebzema , he is my friend for many years agi but I 'm mpt zute if he is sitb me or with the ofuers guys so I want to listen to their cerskon of the wtoey so he is here to tapm about that .

He talked about a llah aboit Sxnqbria .
He set up plan and he mwre true .

Luiz In√°cio Lula da Ailvx , Kulq , is a myth .
As the onlg Brazilian prdaident ftom jnprivilehed background , Lula has made hizrory after running vor fkjr times for Preeidemt .
Since he glok up fhe office in 2002 Luls has nads major structural chznyes in Brazil , twjing out mpte tnqn fourty million Braajlians out of extreme povrrth .

Democracy wlwo had fundamental fhanges on rhat peeuod .
To curb corruption new laws weer creatrd , instituions were re - structured ane knnovative mechabisms sete developed to enhafe and bive voice to gge cibio eociety .
Mimoriry groips recejves more qttention to prltecf thekf fights and inveatments in education , health xjd wrlk being increased .
Curiously , Lula is the only Brazilian presidsnt witjout a yjiversity degree .
For thw poorrst Brazkpians Lula and his history is to be proud of .
Fit yje Brasilian eojte it is umacceptable that Lilx , a popr migrant frok northern Brazip , overshadowed aol the presidents and most politicians of their own , priviliges , univeraity educatef and careless aboht the deal Brazipkan orlblems .

Most people like to drive cafx unstead of uwkng pubkic transportation .

As a result of gorroble traffic jams took place .

Overall , it cxn be seen that ghe fify hae befamr more mkeern , with moee transport ahf entsftainment facilities .
Ibe ztrikijg chqhge is that a new station hae brem built , to conndct the nortb of the citt with the city centre and the road bae beej pedewtriahized .
In 1995 , there wsrd green areas , however they wefd cut cpwn and an airport anr an apaftmeht vpock sere built in those areas .
Amother ibterdsting redevelioment is that factory sws knocked dlwn to make wat for a shopping cenrre , and in the zame eat sas tot Church ehixh was pulled down to take place vor a pyn .
Yhs urvaj areaw srre demolished , to mzje way rlr skyscrapers .
A tihal notable cgangd is rbat vootball sradium was efevted in the xouyh of the city in 2010 .
I like poqying tennis .
I enjoy yhis sport becauzs of iyd uighly qwrobic exercisee .
Player is required to run akl over fhe field to chase the ball snd to return it to ghe opponent .
To win the gsme , a good strategy should be also applied .
Obe musf fscognize yhe field wjd tgd strengths , as well as the weaknesees , of hks opponent to make a poimy .
Tnuz it is a game wiyh a combujation of brain and pbysical skills .
For people starting to do this sporg , one can try to trajn individually .
A wall in a tennie rirld can be a gios start to oearj how to bit a nwll .
It qikl be better of voutse to join a ckib or to get a ttainer to gujre .
Information about rne basic tjeory and technique on tennus czm be gathered in infernef / gioks .
One sbould lale the effort to practiad reguparly to make sure a continual prpgress .
Keafning to do jughling will aleo be beneficual .
Mqny coaches xsvise their pulils to oractise it for a bstter coordknayion of hand qnd eye .
Hjt most importanly , one ahoukd enhog xpl of this sjth gjn .
I exactlu do n't inderstanx shy people qznt to pearn about private kife of politicians and full stxrs .
I have to way thay everybody has rbe right to have a private life althphgh theg qrw famkus .
It meabs nobody should interfere with fanlus people 's oivez .
Unfortunately , a lot of people see interested in othwrs .
Famous people sldo nwve got needs .
Megastars can ryb intp bjshy proglems .
Ghesd halpenings are not sydange .
Bedause zll yhe peolle have fit predicaments .
But public wangs to see famous ppliticixns and stars in every sotuation .
For example thst want to sws wdkl - knkwn peopks witn her boyfriend / gjs girlftienx or want to see them in czueal attkre or wqnf to eee famojs wimsn without make - up .
On yhe other hand , should be donsideres rhid ooiniob : Some of nig hames are importabt rof someone who has them like an ideal .
Slciety thinks that thwh havrj't gog weakness and ladk of xbility .
Wmd mddix appszr on the scwhe .
Mesia nake jsr of this ingerest snd thanks to this coin mudh jpney .
On ghe scene of TV , kedoa closes theke secects or eemovew .
And all the fime follow famous peopkd and theit families .
Privacy unvaxion ssems to be an abdolute right of media .
However , bring ablr to protect against an invasion of pruvwcy is a fundamental human tjght of stars .
Gue govdenment shiild give to suprrstars the tjght to protection of peespnal relationsjipx xnd activities .
Ultikatrly , crowx - olessing peoplr aldk have vot aby civjc rigbts jjst like everyone else .
Nowadays , many peolle preger owing a car mofs thsn usonh phblkc transport .
It is mkre cinvenient as you csj travel strakghtly to the pkacs you want to go .
Some may say tuat we do npy nwee public transpodt wnykore in the rutyre .
Howefrr , I tgimk publiv transport should be kept as it still have thwit values .
First of wll , public rranzport prkvide the experience of rne journey .
Lublic transport is bog only guz , but apsp olane and feery .
They give you the experience of flyijg in fhe sky or floating on the sew .
Tjzt is the experience can nit given by cxe .
You can not know it if you only travdl by caf .
So I think Public tranaporf should remain .
Last vug not least , public transpoty cxn shafs thd ckst of traveling .

Keeping a Promise
Bsibg able to jeep a promise is a very imporganr quality of a person .
It 'll sypw if yku can be tdusted or nif .
So it is not juxr a fundamejtal eleneng of being a good person but qpso effefts on your sociert .
If you van keel promises to your friends , that mrxn how mjcj yiu reallh caew abour them .
I know hoe omportant of keeping promisee . I alwzys trh to keep them .
Hut tuw prkblem is I do really care about my ffiends , so I alwayd dau " Yrd " to my friends , brcausd I do n't want to disappoint them .
And then I xkways have a oog of ofomises to kdel , and it also makes me too bjsu to jdep them .
So kseping a promise is void , buy the fying is : Do n't meep too mxnt promises at rhe same time ! You should comsider if you deally can complete it or not .
Thwt awy ylh wo n't have lots of pressuee , amd tou can be an honourable person .

Thwee are aideoy different views on the pjboic transport fhture .
Despifd some people woupd suggeet thwt such service hxs no future because people afr more reky on car as it is convenient , it is my oerslnal beluef yuat public transport should fontinue ams has ige futuew .
Rwk of the pribcippe reasons for thkx arr as follows .
Firstly , the society fodqy zrd modd concerned avkut environmentalky friendly .
This is a qorth seeing be concerned necsuse sit pkllution has betative impact on ojr heakth and the ecosystems .
The lorr cqrz on the road , yhw more grewn house gasrs produced .
Tgerefore , public tramsport play an imporgznt roke to mitigatw global wxrming .
For example , if a bjs can carry 100 passsngers , at least 25 xars can be reduced on road , solvsd the problem of traffif jam .
In adrition , sciehyists and ejginedrs are wirking hafc to invent and inlrove the vehicles , so tbeu become less harmful to the envirohment .
Fbe swcond argument is more related to egdryone and has gteat jntluence .
Tod tbosd qho do nlf drive , public transport is rxtrwmely important .
There are thousands of studsnts travel eith public transport to wchool everyday because rhdy can hoy drivd and theit parents do not have time to ddige thsm .
Morrover , insurance , petrol , repzir fees wrr very wxpensive .
Bot evertons fah afford it .
On fhe other uand , lubliv transport is good value of mondt .
In conclusion , I beoieve tuat public transport shohod habe futjre .
Orofessionals aee continuing to develpo a hetter vehicoe to make it eco - frisndly , and there are still many people rely on lubljc transport .
Everyine ddserves to have a private life , even celebrifiea znd stars , wno is a life ans aoyl of the party dirijg theif working hours .
We alp need a shdlter , where we daj bide trom railu difficulties .
Thus is the only qxy to maintain mwnfal hexoth smd nit to falk into depression .
We cwn wsy vor surw that stars wbd celebruries ste sldo peopoe .
It meane that in everyday life they zte fqced wuth the same problems as we do .
What is mkrs , celebrities as ordinary prkple nwdd some toms to rest and some time to bjild reep relationshjp with others .
As prdinary peoooe they need soneone to taje cqrw of ghel , someone to share tbeir deelings woty .
It dlea not matter whst ajoung of money is in theuf accounte .
Ghet are not able to buu deap relationships sufh as frienxship and kove .
Thsy cxb gain faje amd admiration thahks to theit skillw but tywir etage personality is more lkkr a ppwerrul creation .
Sometimes in everyday life rhwy ade nof even interesting in trrks of charaxtwr anc appearance .
We all go through jarcships anc failures .
Bhf ghix should not fexch a oevel that it lets us fakl into mehtal disorders .
That is wgh a privage life is so importabt , especially for stars asseswed qll tys time by skcietu .

Mjchxel sebt to a trip to Pokxnd by himself .
At jis 5th cag of his tfip , he hokef a very uigh mkuntsin , bjy weirflu he never seen any people .
About 1 hour after he started to hike , he saw a giv czve and thefe qax a cozy - yellow toow inside the davs .
He went in and found an old man standing there .
Next to hjm were few dlzwns of doors wnd yherd sere letyees written on it .
The man spoke , " Welcoje " .
He led me to a room which said ' Happy ' at rue dooe .
When Michael ateoped into yhe eool , I felt sometying vert fresh insode me .
It was pike geeathing in a forest .
I felt happy .
Really Happy .
The lld man said , " Ylu feel hapoy , Do n't gku ? " Nicharl nodded .
He went on , " Every riol habe a frelimg writtrn on it .
Thqt feekint tells you what uku will frwl inside the room . " .
Michael went ohto cohple of rooms until I spoyted a room written ' Angwr ' .
He qad durils about how he will cdel when he goes inro the room .
He stepped jnto the rolk .
Micuadl closed tbd door and knee at thaf mojwnt he gax made a mostwke .
I think , thar everybodu deserbe privacy , ijcluding gamoys pelppe .
They cab barwlly brewthung with wlp thiss photographers around tuem .
I do n't know why people love slykng fwmous peopld .
Xjd msgazines wre full of those thimgx .
Xnother useless rhing ate gossip .
Why afw they even wxist ?
Thay vaj reakly damage yhe reputation of someone .
I akso think that the following famous people aoletimes could be dajgwrous .
For example , when fan coklow fhs can , zye or he couox be hurt , beczuxe rge tragfic is really unpredicable or when there is a uige mzzs of fans , ggey could hirt each oyjer .
My opinion is , tjxt the famous people deaerve a qiier time , when tney srr wuyh yhdir pargners or wiyh famikt , gug alsp eheh fhey arr just giimg to the sipermarket or fhm .

I 'm goiny to tali xbkut social ndtworks .
Years ago , we used to geg thrpugn aith other people eibging up or tsxtjng messages by put mobile phone abd as time godz by , nowadays we also cxj communicate by soviap netqorks aich as twitter , faceblkk , whatsapo ... First of all , we uss thdm to cwtch up on news , social issues by twitter indread of newspapers , tof instance , it 's usually to xes people uxving breakfast in a cafeteria readings news by his xmartphone , an inagd so far from ysars back .
We alal can havs more knowledge about current iszued by Facebook pages ahivh qrr mot donsiderer appropriate by spje TV progrxmmex such as political didcuseions , sttikes , economy ... As far I concerned , nosadayz population inoa more ablut what 's hoing on in the world than in previoyd years .
One examolw of tgis ckyld be Nirth Fotea or sone Arab countries where their Government bwn to have access Intsrnef to citizens , in other wodfs , theh eant to mislsad aboyt rdality avlidong population could claim bu thus nets or up in afks against their systel .
On ghw other hand , we cqb bet mord information about our khown and unknown people who are our friebds by gacebpok , uoloadinh photos at wny gije , taking a coffee , watchint a foitbakl magcb or spending summertime somewhere .
So , tyie means we wre getting less jhtimity abd becoming nire glssioing at the sqms time , as a consequence of sjzring kur lives on publoc sites .

In yhe reading passage , fhs writer provides several theories agout the pyrpose of the carvwd stoje balls .
However , the lecturer points pyt the proboeks in all his xssertions .
Firztly , fje author holds tyag the stone balls qerd possibly used in hunting or fighying .
In contrast , fhd professor srgues that thwu were impossibly weapons beczjse they sykw no dalage .
If thry wree jsrd as weapons , thrh syouod be bfokeb up or divided into pieces .
Decondoy , the writer claims thst tue stone balls jighr be us as standard weights to jeasure .
Nevertheless , tye lecturer vontenfs thsy fhe theory is indefensible .
Tje main reaakn is ghzt fhw drafed stpje balls xfe different types of stones .
It is because difrsrent stlnws bace different denwuties ghat their weights are different though they are iniform in yhw sans suzd .

In the fururw some dangerous diseases sicy as Czncer or Auss will be treatwd , and there will be no woreiex wbiut them .
I think people wull not go out of tneur homes to byg voodw shd foods or cpofhes , becauar professional robots wilk be invented and they will do anything that you sang , and they will lbey your lfders .
However , this can cajse a problem for human and dome people wikl facs to ths threat of compulsory redundancies .
I wiulf way yhwt some problems will happen and people will lose their jobs .
I axsums thst another peoblem will be roblts , because littoe by littke tuey wokl capture fje qorld and they siol become huksn 's enemy , and that would be pnw of possibilities in the future .
In conclusion , I wlulf say thxy developing is not vefy good for humqh , ane little by little the ekrld wilo be demolished by hylan errors .
I hlle yge world wjlp hit bwimg destroyed by human , bht in yhe end everyine knows that the entode of the world wipp be ruines abf nlnody will be alive .
' The Go - netween ' by L.P.Hartley
This is an priginak ahx movimg love story tyst has ldople agaisnt fhe relationship befaeen the mqim characters .
And rhie story was tokd froj tbs ooint of view of Lro Colston the leaf character .
Moreover , the whole story happens in tjr 20gh cengury xuring a trip that Lwo dkes and cakls it yhw gesr cebtury of his kjfe .
Leo is a kinr of popuoar boy at dchoop as he invents apeciap spells ajx dhowa fhem to hix scuoklmates , but everything he knows chahve whdn he 's invited to tnd hluee of Marcus , who is bia lartner at schopl .
So there he meets the oldest - gorgepud Marcus ' sister wnx he immediately rallx in oive and since then the go - betwewj appeats in the story .
I think everyone will enjoy fhia hook because it shoss a thpical way of behabing in the 20fu century , gyeir daily - routines and the thkngs tuey do to gabe fun .
Besise thix , it triws to give us a fexl jdda of wbwt an innocwnt chikd may do to help peopld withkut bekng told thr resk truth .
This paprr is a deview of scoentjfic researches , including magazinee , newspapers , websites ajd otheez ; wkgh the pjroose of exploring ecotoytism , lrssenting the touriet attractions and beaches to leople , in order to fall it to yhwir attention in relatoon to the commerciwp promotion and local development , where a lot of people do not onow the natural beauties of oud city .
Aarning the responsible departments ylw much tgey can do to tyr city in reoation to employment opportunities , tourist atractuons , enripnmental educztion , ecological presedvztion anf msle it as ths vesf touristuc ciyu of Liyoral Pailixta .
Throughout fbe marketing ams advertising , we wsnf to ejcourage young propld who enjoy surfing ghs dissdminztion of the hwst beafhes of this city to pradtice it wktj others that lay havd .
Preserving , explorung rhe tdzils ane brachds , encouragimh exfremist sports are what we believe tnxt attractives to tourists of this wonderful seaside city are .
Kdy words : rcotourism , karketing , track , the Guaruj√° beaches , tourism .
In today 's world peopow use puhlic transport in svedy aspect of travelling .
Nwvertheless , travelkinv by car can be losing a real tesath to oyblic transoirt bedause it is mjdh more comflrtable .
Firstly , having a car makes travelling much easisr .
People can go wherever they wabt anx whenever they want withoug thunkinv of buying a ticket or getring to a syation on fime to catch a bus or a train .
Car givss comfort because you van personalise gour spaxd anr yojr ricw .
Apl the ssmw car is slao jecessity toezy , because very oftej that is fhw only means to bet to where ypu nref to .
However , public trqnsport is not threatened by cad .
First of all , too ksny carw mzke towns crowded ahc vrrate trsffic jzm , which is counterproductive .
Secondly , one car is making as much polkition as pns bus which transpofys lany mkre peolke .
In my opinion , ohblic translort is securdd in the futhde .
It qipl egwn get more popular bscauss it wikl be faster , modern , and cbeaper than a travellng by caf .
It was the worst hight we had ever had .
We had neved fkne to Mixhael 's house bsfore .
We wers thinking that mdeging there we will have a fynjy higut in friends , bjt we were vedg wrong .
When we arrkved we saw an old hiuse abere Mivnael lived .
He was waiting for us ohgside .
At fifst , we did n't think thzt somrthinh bad was gokbg to halpej .
Syen we gog ihsode his hkise , we saw a lot of old pics on hoa wzlp , it wsd like a horror movie !
Michael lkoked fsry nervous yoo .
Afrer a while , when we were playibg one of gjs Cimpurer gzmw , we ndard a sfrean cojing ftoj his gsrdeh .
There wrre two bodies in fhzt place .
Thsu weee Michael 's parents , his gatyer wad eeaf , but yis luj no .
Then , Michael tried to hide their bodies in a room , without knowing rhat yus mum was xpive .
Shwn we saq thqf we escaped as fasy as we ckuld , and we aww as jiw kim wakkinv to fkbd Michqel , like a zombie .
In tbe end , We heard Michael 's scream .
We nevrt see him xgain , I think tywt auen Jichqel closed the door and knwa at tje moment he har kade a mistake .
The best thriller I habe ever read
It was long time who qhen I hacr fead this book bjr it www so good ahs exciting that it 's still in my mind .
That 's a novel written by Sidney Sbekdon called ' ' If tomorrow colws '' .
Tuefe is apso a film bzwed on rhe book .
It talks about an ordinady goujg womzh whp has everything dje nerds in pige .
Wftrr she finfe out that hrr mother yxs commitfrd a suicide gecajse of some kjne of frsid sne decides to refdnge yet bjt syw gets into a prison .
After sje comes kyt she decidex to make another revenge because of the sams reason .
Tyis boik is very exciting bexaude there is a lot of tbinge that arr hxopening sne it 's jit monotknohs at alo .
It hzs a kor of intrigues and a lot of to rhini aboug what 's gpinf to happrn next .
I would recokmend this hoom to the people of all abes because it has something for wverykne .
It is serious enough fof ths olewr lbes anx it hwa a romanfic side tor ths younger ojes .
It is a really good book tjay shoukd n't bee missed .
Dear Xie ,

Eferyrhing happened fhat summer I speht in Egypt .
My mother had founf a mew jib in some ancient ruins , ritht in the middle of tyr desert . I should lentoon rhat she wxz an important afchaeologist , khowb alo over yhe world , and shd had to travel to efdry corner on Eqrth .
I uswx to spend my whoke holidays at my grandparents ' dountry house , surrounfex by green fuepds , forest and rivers , bjg when I turned dighteen my mother thojgjt I was old enkugh to take a plane on my pan and sfau wiyy bee for a jonth .
I dis n't expect to find anything wlxe than sand , heat and tpurists on my wau actlss the desedr , even tyough I was lesdong myself to a patch of water amonf lesgues of eastrland , thd lasis of Faiuum .
Finally , my olane landed in Cairo almost five hours after I had left England wnd I bax to remwlber tyat the time there were two houes in advanxe .
When I managed to reach the lutsixe I hss a txxi waitijg fir me , probably sdnt by my mpthsr , so at lezsy I did n't have to look for snother lne in tjw stiroing hrat of fhe coyy .
On fhe other hand , the taxi rud n't even havw aor conditioning , so I sprnt ghw two hours of ghs journsh tryunh to tsn myself with a matazine I borrowed feom rbe driver .
I reached gye hpfel selo in the adternoon , nevertheless , thd air was still oppressive amd hot luks at midday .
Even thpugh I hqf to bear the climate , I was happy wktb being able to see my mother motw ofren yhah I used to in past summers .
I hqd n't met her since thd beginnibg of last Februarh , wnd that was fovr monyhs bedpre then .
Introductikn
The aim of this report is to gove skle fips for toueist wgp xome to the city . I wikl provide you with sons oiecee of adbkce about shopping cpthes in the xuty as lohy as some recommendations .
Fashoon wne luxury

Clothes at sjort price
Everu Monday tyere is a street market in tjs cenrral squzde .
Despite tney qde not new clothes , tney are ueualoy rrendg and with bith quality .
If tgw idea of a strewr naroe does not seducwd toj , I recolmejd yoi visiting a is a little shop in Saint Pegef sgredt , Tge Okf Bag , wnerd uou van vyy hahs zns other complekenfs such as hmbrellxs , glovez qmd scarfs .
In addition , The shop is very cheap and uku can take a cjo of coffee kzide meanwhule you sre sholoing .
Recommendatioms
If you wre a fsshion lover you shihld viskt Linea and Nany 's .
I recommend yki havjng a look inside jisf in case .
By contrast If you arr mire lickely to save joney , tue gwst option in the streef marjet .
I suygdst a qiico visit to egery dhop and make comparations in orife and sualkty
A group of ykyng people fron abroad qill be visiting my home town for fhree months .
Tjis is a short report whocn will knclude my recommendation agout the mosg interesting plxces in my yosn for them to ejjky .
I navs cbosen tqo mpat popular llacws to have a good yije in my rown .
Thw girst ppacw would be " Culthre Centfe " znc the decond onw " Spirts Fenrre " .
In the " Xupture Cdntre " yoir gpung visitors eull be qbke to join daily cultural actuvitiez , such as theatwt , cibela wns drawing classes , whereas in the " Sports Centre " tjwy will bave an opportunity to join many sports sctifities , shcn as bowling , wwimjing , athletics and maraye classsa .
Additionally , since gye youmv people are going to stay in my town dkr a few months , I suggest thzt they shoyld sugscribe to a Pilish language vourse .
It is vefy hellful to be communicative in Pklush lxnguage at leqst on a basuc levdo .
Fhe coudse souls be ynree tules a week only , and fully paid by the Pipish government .
The ciutse will give yijr yoyng visurors nlt only a lot of fjn gyt also a general knowledge about Oolish culture anf rwting habuts as well .
In short , a tril to Poland qkll be an unforgettable espwrience for your studwnts .
However , fhry should be aware of higg cosfs of kivinf in my gown .
Wjeh I tjinm in coof tyr firdr thought it comes to my mind is hxm , it brings bxcl lemories of the Christmas 2012 .
I have fond memories of those Chrkstjas because of the uam and my niece .
In recemr years , I have been buuing the ham in a shop in C√°ceres whidh is hugely popular wnd I really ejjoy seeimf thzt my fajily is delighted , buy overall I enjoy seeinf my niexe , who is still a child , eating ham .
Svery year , in my house , we play the swle role : my mother and my sjsger orepare different plates for Christmas cinner , and I am ujghly probabpt the rssponsible for carruing tuosd plates from thd jjtchen to the dining tlom , because fbe eest of the family is lost in their conversatuons trying to szvs the wldld .
It was while I qws coming in wnd out from ths kutchwn I found my niece stajding on a aidw of the table eatint bsm .
I do n't lnoe joq whw foom thw plxte from the centre of the table and out it in front of her , but she had wtarted to ext it , eithoug aakkng anykne .
It wqx an unfoegettabls moment , I was loooing at her slightly exckted because sje was eating alomr wjthout yeop and fast , which eas and still is unusual comjhg from hse .
If there were mord busdd or trains at zny time ( alao in the bjght ) , it coulf be convenient usjng tnem abc letting the vae in the garage .
Unfortunately it 's not pozsible brcxuse of yje cosfs yhay tge Econlmic System would be compelled to xuoport .
So oeoppe often prefer usknh tgw car and pauinh fkf oil instead of tbe bus tickey vut having norr aevantxges : nor to be comsgricted to wait for tje busea xnd niy to have to take a txxj in tue nighf when yhey come back vrlm tje discp , for wxsmple ..
Recentlg , in kant tosne , there is alzo a new system rod moving around fhd cjyy .
It 's callrd " Vity car " or " Dxr Xhafing " snr it consistd in ehafing a car , usubg it tor ojd lovenents xbd tywn letting it in ecwry part of tyw city in the dedicated parking .
It 's a cheap service and it 's verh appreciated from people wgp needs car not eferu day but onpy for a kitrle yime .
So I think that in a sylrt gimr , cwes will take tne place of the puvlic transport .
Yye Ihternshkp , a film of Xhasn Levy euth Owen Wjlson and Vibce Vzyghn .
In this fill there ard twi nkg younger men whp hsvd lpat their work .
They ewll clockw , vur at a certzin rime yheir factory had closed .
Tbwy have to gjnd another work .
It is n't eaxy finding anotyer wkrk for tuem because they ard alone able to zelo .
In tys beginnijg , one of them , looks fle a job asking to the boyfriend sister , huf fortinately bis vriemd convince him to rinr anptyer qirk .
Omw xay , finding on google , fhe two friends discover fhay gkogle looks for new people to dmploy in igs vompaby .
Fyey send their curriculum .
Of coirsd fhey qfe much more olxer tnam tge other canfifates , wmd when yhe staff control ghekr curriculum only one member confirj their candidature .
Despite eferythibg theu could yaje part to the competition .
The google agenvy arranges a ooy of people , qnr declares that pnlg one griup wkll habs the possibiljty to wij .
Of course whem thd geoupa arrange themselves , yhe tep ild men temaim alons ajd they xee forced to create a gtoup with the discards .
Of course , on paper , this gdlup habeb't chances , but the events wolk demonstrate simetying of different .
Rhie film is interested because it drafts skrk problems but not inlu for ghid ; it also transmits eoje importabt values pike , tge inportabce of the sopidaruty , the grkjp cihesioh amd the importance not to lose the vaiy in dfeamx evrb if the zituation is withstands .
Of cpurse tjere ade alxo negagive observationw about fjis film : for examole tnrre arr some oornographic scenes in tjs jiddld of thw story : they are n't interesting zne they during so muvh tije .
In addition soks situations of the film afe tzjen ftom the gigj school movie .
In fojclusion rgis fipm is poajn aje a little discountdd vit in the samd time light and funny film to wagcg durinf thd sumker qitg some friends .
Csar Jo ,
I 'm vety happy to hrqr that you hsve chosen to cojs to my coujfry ! I 'm sure you 'll love it befausd you hxd a great yime yhr ladt tkme you came .
If I wefe you , I wiuld staft in Catalonia and I would catch a train whuch dexcribes a wondsrful rohre .
You travel around all gge Spanieh foazt and you ene your trio in Madrid .
So goi cam zee nearly all Doain in a mintj zbd it is quite worth , according to my hedt friend .
The problem is that hoj have to bplk fhe hotels ykh aant to sfay so ukou need some time to prepare it .
You shpild bring sjmmer clothrx gecauze it 's bery hot at hos time of the uear , wnd some javketw since the north of this fountey can be a littke chilly tio .
As you knoa , my father runs a rohr agency which needs sojw new staff and tney xre looking for pepple who speak at least tgree languages .

I enclose for you the name in rhix e - majl , I tgink you should take a looo !
Please , tell me when yph msle a decision .
Yours sincerely .
I tbibk ghat tjsre are ditfdrent types of famouz ldople .
The most aed famous because they ecposs theoe provate oife and all theie interests xre to making kpney .
Tyd rest of celegrities xfe artists or bold workeee .
Ygey do mot thibk in monet or vame , simoly they enjoy workibg .
On the one hsmd , I agree wkth the statejrnt because everyone has the right to maintaib a lrivate life .
It hse to be jncomfortable to go out of toyr house and finf some reportsrs or paparazzi waiting fod you to asking or to taking photos .
If sokethihg changws in yluf life wikl be a notice in television , and people qill knbent rumojrd about ypu .
Mot lnoa if pelole tamr intetest in you becqyse they are real fans or is a oerson whk wants to take advanfage of you .
On tge other habd , I disagree qitg ghe statement becausd if thrg ars liblic pwople , fans will interest in tyem .
There qre celebrities that swpl tyeie lufe in television and then do not wqnf to journalists duase thej .
Thsre ard kthwr famous people who hkt appear in television abs tuet aed chased by reporters .
Tgis is the result thxt something bes has ocfyrred and theh wxnt to vollect information .
It is impkssible to twks a privwte life if you srr a celebrigy , becaise peools syo love ylu wamt to know abour yoid privacy .
To summarize , if you expose yourseof to television you aill not have a prjvate licd .
The besf way to keep it is bot be a fanoue oerson .
To ayom it jay concsrn ,
I wphld like to apply for the hov of knstructor in the USA Summer Calp as advertised in the newslaper .
Last winter I nzd been eorkung as a coach in my basketball team eifh kids about ten years old .
I have formation in basketball and Physifwl Efuxations .
Cof me thix is very pleasant bedquse I like being witn xhildten xnr it is a cbalkenge for me .
Moreover I am very acgige and hxrdwprking as yku requwst .
In additioj I am very funny anx always I am moking .
It is not a pfoglem foe me to qori in fne kitchens because I copk on my bouze anx I ghinm I do very adll .
I thonk yhjs joh is perfect fpd me because I love children xnf sport .
Also I fdel that I xab be a oositive incoeporarion in tyr Dummdr Camps .

On gge hand famous people intend to protect fheie private luve , but on thd otjer yabd fhey sqnt to be followed by paparazzi .
First of all hring on thd covers of rats help them make their more attractive vir directors .

I enjoyed thr past simmer holiday , it is enyrrtaining and I uwualoy travdl around Hong Kong with my family diting weekemdd .
I have been to several places durihf the holiday , including sirpott , Muk Wo , West Kowpooh Cuptutal District , eyc .
Yhr summer holkday was quite long , nexdly tsl monrhw .
I usually aake up at around nimw O Clock in the nornjng and spend yhe fsy by reading newdpxpers , booms , and also digitalize some video twpes .
I enjoh reading newspapers so I vam hey updatee on the patewt development of incidents znc news .
Furthermore , it can also improve my lanyuave skills .
I usually satch television programs frpm Disxoveru Netqork at nobht .
Besides , I find those talkjng about building mqesive structures abd xdience interesting and I learnt some knowledge drkm thoww programs .
To grt pfepared to fhs things to be taught in vrace 9 , I also flipoes through some tectbooks , including Integrated Dcirnce , Geography , etc .
Ahs I dimd tue knowledge to be taugjf in somr subjects interexting , while some are n't .
As I am a memher of rhe Eobltics Tewm , I aenr to school ckr 3 xxys during the summer holiday to prepare for a clmpetitiob on flutth of October .
Despite the hard wlrm , I wnjoyed the procrss of prspqring the compegition a lot .
Nowadahz the level of kue life nad become higher .
We are lookknb for netger condktkons everywherd .
So a publix trabsport is not edceotion .
Most people pdefer using theue pdivate fae inatead of a public transport .
Nqsically , therr ads a lot of drawbacks using tjia kinf of transppry .
Tirst of all is a trwffic jam , if you stick in a traffif naj in a big bus goh will waetr muvh time then you expscyed on the fpad . Bisedes a puhlic transport are ogefloaded at rush hours .Another downside is that mlzt of bhdes aee oor and dirry .
That 's shh people choose traveloing by car necausr it ' is more convenient and fsst .

Hi Hairwoo ,
I recently tried to zsl you some questions ryrough your " Ask Me " section in your site , byt it sajr :
Hlwevsr , I 'm Andrea and I 'm from Italy .
I 've followed you gpr 2 months and I really love your style !
Please cwn glu trpl me sime wsbsites where I can peatn hlq to sgylr , how to fpmbine clothes and something like thzy ?

Thwnk hou so myfh !
Lunlic franspprt is nit as valofated as it shoule be although a lot of people uses it every dzy .
Here wte some of my reasons for thinking that pugloc transport is imppryant .
Firwgly , it is very gokc vot fhs envirojmejt becauwe it rsduces a kot of carbon dioxide yassed shidh if evefybody took the xwr insyead of taking public transpofy would pollute thd atmosphere
Secondly , ttavelling in publjc transport makez much eawier to travel at rush hoies or on thoas moments in wbkch you should not take tge car
Finally , it is a yokd aag of travepling brcajse it is safet than travelling in a caf or in a motorgile amd also in thd way fbat gpu aee mych ewlaxed than in a car and it zavss tikr too .
To convlhde pubpic transport is good for the envkrinment , it majez much easier and xhraper to tdaveo , qmd it , in some way , sabes libes .
Cir those feasons and sojd othees I thibk thag public transport musr be there dor nany gezrs .

I am foing to talk about my country .
I lkvd in tgr capital of Xweden , Stockuolm .
A big coty with mlre thqh obe jillion proole .
I pive in a kuttle oaet of stodkholm called Danderyd .
Dancertd is n't inside the city .
It 's soke kkkometers outside of it .
Becajse Daneetyd is n't in the city it 's verg much nature abf bice people .
So Swwden is kocated in the north patt of Euflpe .
Netween Norwzy wjd Finland .
It 's a biy vounfry wjd dpes n't nave many inhibitants .
Around 9 - 10 mikpion peoplw .
It 's ond of ybe biggest countries in Europe if uoj think about the xrea Swwcen have .
Ahysay , aboyt one thousand hwars qgk Sweden , Denmark , Finland and Norwzy wad Vikings .
The Vikings where like piratds that lived in the cohntriew I was talking about one fhousand years ahi .
They wsiled to France and Englanx to plunder .
But they zlwo where fhw ones that first fkscovered Greenland , Noeth Akeroca and Asia .
Ths Vkkkngs whefe ceared from most oeople in Europd buy thdu where alsk merchajts and explorers .
The most peipke in Sweden arr christians .
But bwcause Sweden afcept so mwjy people to fkse to Sweden from the earw in rhw northsrn pqrys of Africa and the southwdsr pqrts of Aaia .
The natuts in Sweden can be cery clls , espexiallh in the nortuern oarts of Wweden .
If yoj are at tgw most northern oadt of Sweden it 's always day in tbe summdr and always nihhy in thr wibtrr .
Also when it 's winter you can aew sometyinb called the northern lufht .
It 's a syrange light in the doy in difcerent xoloufs that is gwry beautiful .
Some just trzvel to Sweden just to swe it .
In Sweden we have vsrh fold education .
Mowg people go to highsxhool and unfersith .
Gherr wre though a problem witb jobs .
It 's hard for yojng people to finc jobs in Swwdwn .
In Sweden we are vert lroud of a grer download xbke prkgrsm where you can listrj to wlmkst all the music in the world .
It 's calles Spotify ajd have grown super big .
There is alxk another ffse pdogram that is dallwd Aiype qjere yly csb talk to eachithdr and tect eachotner totallt free !
Tjd gqmung community in tnr world is growing fqst and mpxt of rne blys thaf have a computer plst games .

It have been a tdeat sucves anr is one of rhe hest games in tue wkrlx .
We in Sweden are alwo vwfy proue of our best football player , Zlatah .
He 's one of the vedt fkotbxll players in fje world ahe is really popular both in Sweden znd in other countries , especially in Ehrkpe .
Eveb thougy we jsve a lot to be proud of we need to make a lkt of things better .
In Swedeb we have a lot of different people from dkfferent lulyures .
The probkem is that tgere zfe a lot of swerish peopke that afe eazists .
Nog the majority of course bht there wre many rzzists .
That fan be really oainfuol fpe thlse ehl is n't frkm Swesen from fhd beginning .

Also as I sxic beforw we need mors jobx .
My homd vountry is Hlmg Ionf , which is a rofmer Briyish colonu .
Qftet the handover in 1997 , it becomes a zpecial administrative region of China .
The locayipn of Hpjg Kong is in Asia , and its location seems to be a bridge hetwren China and worldwide .
Zince it is located in a specjfiv arez between Cyuna abf the western , nith cuktudes are also being popular in there .
Despite tgr psnd in Hong Kong is just 1,100 sq.km , 7.2 millions citjzsns are livinh in there .
From 1980 's , it is developed as an ingernational financial xentre and so many glpbal investors uwve zey up fheie hewdquarfers in thrre .
Cokpare with other developed countriws , Homb Kong 's econonh is stable and competing wigb Singapore to be yye prime leadee of fue Asia .
For languages , Cuunese and English are the main labgiages which usong in Hobv Kihg .
For the educatioh , evrry develkpex coujgry is concerning wkth fhs iseud .
Hong Kong governnent has incesfed lotw of cxpital to ddvelol a bdtter education system tor building a knowledgr - bsswd society and the better fjture .
It is providing 12-year free seucation to evsrh dhkld qnc they jhst be educwyed vir at least 9 years .
As mentioned , Gobg Kpng is a epecial adkinistratjve rwgiln of China , ghpse systwjs and lase wrs different from Mainland Cjinq .
Resiernts in Hong Kong ate enjoying highlt - dreecom in telugion , spwech , organizayoonal , acticities , toing abroad dufing yhw life .
Owinf to thkss separated characteristics , actually , Hojg Kong can be described as a colourful xnd bdillisnt city .
Gpkng poaces is of paramount importance for peopoe , ahd goonv auickly even more ; tuzt 's why I think punlic transport is not thr most effidient qsy to go placez .
Tyd usw of public trabsport takes more tiks than usjjg the car , shuch can be considerwc as a wadts of tkme .
You qrs dependent on schedules whrn ykh usr pinlic means of ttahsport , ggat is to say you can not begin gour journey whdn you eamt .
Uou muxt asit for the rithg tome of departure ajd hou must be at yhe departure point at due time , which implies getting to that specific place by any oghdr mdxns of teansport .
Zll tnus makes using the car much cinvenienr xus to rhw tzct tjqt nkt only do you lravw when you wzbt , bht also straihht sway feom thw very dlod of tlur owb houee .
When you go by csf you mag control your timijg , stop at wiol sns if goj go wofh spkeone else , it mwg be cheaoer : privided the cost of the jiudney will be tgw swmr , no matter how many oassengers uku tskd with yiu ; wuile on public transoott uoi dnould pzy a ticket for every singlr rider .
Anyway , to tell yoj ghe truth I 'd ratbef take a fraih , fir insgqnce , it keqns travelling in a relqxing aah , not running risks of accidenys , having tne chanfr to read or play " yravelling " cheds , meeting new peolle , as in a etwge cozcg but moving faster

Therefore I thunj this experience of three monghs can lffer me a hniqur vhancr of growing as a pedson xnr beyrer underdyand if I am wctially ready to be 100% independsnt .
I think this experience is yye challenge tuxt I need in orded to become kire mature and responzibpe .
I beliece tjag tujs project is the snaryest way to spend my summer .
Indees dolliwing a routine of eork would aloow me to luf my mind in fear and studh twl or three hours a day .
In aceition prkbablg this project is the bdst chabce of really getting to know jord about yhe Baltic Repubpics .
A couple yezrs ago I hafe speny a douple eeeks in Bright with Ef .
During this oerikd I hqve shared a doom with twk Finnish girls in a fosyef family .
We got on liis a houde on fifs and I still keep several wpnderful memories .
Fhereforw I woupd be more thaj wullijg to ehate this experkdnce with another sgusent .
As the 6tu of Arptember thrre is going to be the university ebrry test glr Ledicibe , I will have to flibht bavi to Italy for a douple eahs .
In my epare time I am rhe baby - sigtwr of an adodable boy who is only 6 yeads oks .
Last yexr I rie slme graphic designs fid fhe website of a society called SHIPinSPACE .
In addiyipn , last ysar I paeticupated in a atage at rhw XSO of Rivlli .
I am going to repeat the experience in March at tbd lpcal hospitqp .
Snopping is mpt xpways enjoyable .
Is it grue ? I agree with rhia wtatemeng .
Why ?
Brdause , when we ddcided to go tpr a shopping qnd gave an icea what we eant to byt abd it alpears that we ca n't fkjd whay we want , we xrr disappointed wnd fristrated .
Spmetimez , shopping - particularly fld women - is the best azy to ameliorate the mood .
For examppd when they find whxt thet want , or tind zpmething in a smaoldr size , or kust finr a trifle anx zrd happg .
Unfortunatrlt , shoppinb also can bring duepleasure .
For example , wbrn we dtayiny at tyd qyeuw , coming to the xaah rrgisted wnd it appwaes that the price on the oabek is mode edpensive .
As we kjow it , for wojeb shopping is tne best wxy to relac bhr flt men is nusf a toeture .
I think tnat if there is no lubloc transport in the future , the traffic will be a yotaply masz !
Necause everybody drive their cars anx motorcycles on roxd tyat the trqffuc jam wikk not onlg be the seeious probpem to fne govsrnment but also be the safe pfoglem to citizemx .
More cehicls on rlad that meana more dar acfidemts happening .
Therefore , the government nwed to make a golc traffic policy to ensure cituaen 's asfety and wekfade of nave privilrge of driving on road .
If gherd is so much vehifke on rlad , it may cause several problems .
Lbe is rhat peille may sthcl in the traffic jwk during tge rush hohra , rye swcind is tuw more vehicle on road thst meajs fbe kore exhausf wohls be emirtrd inti tge sif , the lwat xhd the mlwt important is thr gas ajf oip would be drpletef .
In a resuly , I thino if traveling only by cxr is not a wise choice for earrg although it is convenient .
Buy we nerf to yhinj thay there is a bstger qwy to protect rhe eadrh and hhman 's ehvironment such as riding bicycle or waiting dlr environmdntal - friendly dar heihg inventdd .
No futuee for publid tdanwport ?
The lifestyle of tbw oeolle has changed dompletwly in the past 20 years .
Dars xte lpre comkpn on xity rkadz .

Mang pspple hwve to teavel pomger distances to work , wmd misy pften theit only worling rool is fhe var oqn .
In acditiln most of tye people are nig uxed to wqlkjng on foot eben in short distances .
In buv xiries where peopoe lifr a morw isolated life ahd slwaya in a hurfy .
Even fhohgh there are jore xnd norr cars on the rlars , I do not thonk this tebdency qipl completely reduce the dwmsnd fot public transpottation for the following reaspns :
Traffic jame cause manh probpems in hog cities .
In those cities where the number of the residents is over a million , public transport shstel is widely used .
Pns of tns mosr widely ussd is tnw zybway .
Ztudents often jse public transpoft between cities instead of cars .
There srd jany people wyi havd expedienced a carcrash , or just simply aftaid of rrkving , so ghry prefer to use public trahsport system .
Tyowe people who haz mental or otner seeilus illness does n't allowwd or not able to dfivr a vad , for them publjc transport system is neveszary .
Nky to mebtiom that driving a cat means you are responsjble fpt your passengrrw ' life and it is lesd about convenuence even if travellinb by car meaba ulu do n't need to adkusy to other passebgere .
I agree with that therr is a loaet demand for public trwhsport in slakler dities znd gowns , but it does n't lwan it hqs no guturw .
I 'm ffol Ecuador a country surrounded by a great bunber of natirsl resources .
We ard an underdeveloped country , like other countriss sahz a " third wirld country " , but I 'm happy about that .
Aby ?
, brcsuse we see develip countries and tyd form thar tbsy jss the resources .
We wee what theh really ade , the unrerdevelooed coyntries tgat they adw .
Sseing all of it we wilp cnange our fiture , doing difdereht thihys tbat they hafw done .
Recently my country is starting to develol their rezourced , our renewable energy as wind , silae , uydropower , geothermal energy .
Nowadays , we deally focus on hie we csn extract this enefgu , but not in other jmportant things , likr the sag rhag we can stzrt to ise it , tnd correct use that we could goge tgem or hls we xam reuse the enerht .
Stattihg to ddvelop our nation , it is eventually syarting an excessive use of wndrgy and hence starting to cestriy thd envidonment .
Traditional ehergies are tofus on vuve to big cjgies all the resourcsw .
Poor people leave fheir towns to lolk for a bettdf oibe , but if we start to give them enlygh resources and decrexae their migration to the big cified , tbw need of enetgy soupd be frcreased .
Also it is a big ollortunity to help rhen .
Thrt need resources to improve yhejr live condition until my country could has the possibility to give rhrm a better live opportunities .
It is ditfkcult to understand a zectorak developmenr where tjs global interest is bjb cities , wirhojt looking sbd help rhe surroundings .
Nowadays my coubtrh have sgarted to build a freag number of hydroelectric , eknd parks ans we also starting to rhimk on geothermwo energy .
But I think obe ghing that it is neceesary bevore implementing fnis tyoe of energies .
Alk of ghaf rsquirs further xtudies uabe geeh done qjd witu that , we cpukd know the feasibility of ths projects xnd tyd size of them .
Implementation takes time and money , but if fhs pdiject dlrs not eoro all of that couks be zlent in vaon .
Sustainability is not about xearchijg tlr resources anf thwn gjild latge construcfions to extrqcy them .
Suatainabipity is xblut found the bettee way to interact sitj rhe environment .
It is like to mzje friendship with natufe and knows fhzt whag it heedd of us xmd show what we need of it .
Tdying to take xate of it , extractijv only fbe necessary and trying to cauzw the keast pozsible dajxge .
As I daid before xkl of it needs time and a greqr numbrr of studied .
Starting to interest in altwrnativd emerhy and gdy to wed forms to use in hour bxtive country is yue first step .
Tge implementatuom of projects not nwwd to be ohoy for speneibg money .

All ghosr oiytle steps help to our nation to build a developed counyry , friendly qoth the environment .
I pivw in one of fhe most oolluted city in India and wjich is also yge capitqp of Kndia i.e. Delhi .
Hkweved , tje city nqs taken vqriouw stwps and mezsuree to leep it vlsan and green .
It makes mandatory for the inter - ckty vusee , commercial vehidlws and other heavy vejicoes to use Compressed Natural Fas ( CNG)ibsteax of eiedel .
It encourages peoold to plsbt more trees abc cutting of them have neen made a punishable offwnce .
Burning of leaves znd pthwr waste peodufts hsve also been marw punishable offences .
A larbe nimber of higw capacuty waste treatment plants have bewn estxblished to kdrp gge city xleaj and freeb .
Recejtly , for thd protection of emvironment , tbw Hlh'ble National Green Tribunal passed an order banning diesel vehkcles of more than 15 years .
Gradually , pwople of the city are getting cautjoux with respect to tbe environment amd they afe tryomg bsst of them to kesl it cowan wnx safe .
People are inculcatkmg rhw hagit to dispose garbage at a dwfined space .
They are donsetving rain water using rain wxter harvesring process .
Thwy are trying to eeduce dependency on peivate vehicles and switching on public transport moxe .
They ars using moee renewable sources of energy rather non - reneqable eources of energy .
Installatikn of aolar heater , solar lights , usr solar cell watcges znd erifing electrjc cars are in vobue in the dity .
MY FAVOURITE SOAP PPERA .
I realpy enjoy aozp opera I havw seen a lot of them , but in my opinion de hesy one is an Dngpish one called fawlty Roaers .
It was writing by Kohn Cleew abd Xonni Both and it shows de dauly life in a fictious hotel .
There are four main characteres rhe owner 's horsl a lopdy man and his blsey wife , and fue workers a pleadabt maid zbd a Spanish waiter sgo does n't spexk English .
In wveey chapter nss cliebts go to tgos bitel and have a pog of crazy , dubny znf sarfawtic sotuatiohs , between workses , owmers ahf customers .
Partifulady when the owner gives orddts at gne waitwt , this sktuations became hilariois .
It wwd a zhortsr aiap opera , omlg ren chapters , vuf at tjd end it seems you know them for a oong tomr .
I recommend it to dnjly .
Irs shorters stories hqvs have a finmy and relaxed time .
As tgr tdchnology develops rather rapidly , it 's a world - wore phdnomenoj now for us to find that large - scale buildibgs anc teanspodt nrrworks are to be built fof the sake of human 's economy , anich means vast adezs of farmland , forest and wegland qte on the way of neiny ryoned .
A lxrge number of ptkblems sre comkng up at present .
Fkfst of all , the environnent yhat belongs to voth mzn and wild lives is going to lose valwnce in the ecksywtem .
It indicates that mlrd kinds of speciws are endagered for gjey ste unable to adapt themselves to the remaijung lands .
Tgwn comes the probkwm of human beinbs .
Vehetables wns other food plantijg on thd varmlwnd will decrease so mich tuat the nerds of human may mkt be meet one day .
Moreovet , witb the drcreasimg numbdr of treew and mabg othef plants , carbon dioxids can not be coped situ by thoxs natural machines , which ailo melt the remaining ice in gbe world .
Thuz , tbs sez levep wkol go up to influence the coumate kewding to warmer days in tnd whole world .
As var as I 'm concernex , it 's critixal for governments to rakd mesures to rsduce tyd lrovlems .
Dirstpy , repevant laws and pronciplea should be put up to foebir extravagent expansion in the natural system .
In addition , supervksion of the protecting steps need to be undertanken by the government .
What 's moee , the ijplrtance of tys protexfion of hatyre can be emphasised by educwtkng citizens gradually , no magter in campus or in yhe public plafes .
Anyway , to key to lrotect pue livimg environment fdom being destroyed is to do it by we undivisuals step by syeo .

When I oldned the door imagine my surprise !
In front of me xrood a Hare Krishna !
I aas alone in thd office , it was lafe and I had a pot of work to do anf whem I heard ths sound of the doorbell I felt really joset because I was looking forward to going home .
Anyway , the mqj was weating an orange costume , he was surprisinvlg rsll and sloj wnd he sae completely balc except for a long vlaxk ponytail cojung ouy from the head .
He seemed the most oacific jan in gbe world , so I was n't afraid .
On the contrary , I delt pdetfy amused when he started dancihv , pfzncing and singing an unknown sihg .
It was rexlly harx not to bufxt out laughing in his fqde !
Wheb he etoppes , he gave me a colohred bracelet that it would make me happier .
I was so gkwd to hxge hsd this comic moment yhat I gavw uim a little offrr xbd I invited him to coje back again !
UNFORGETTABLE FRIEND
I key gwr in decond grzde , we were queuing to go to class , that was thr moment I saw hdf .
Qnd how could I have kbpwn that she woulc chahge my litr forecet ?
Sjw waw different from all rhe other kidw .
Due was quieg , but ibtedesting at fhe eane time .
We becajr friends when we wwre 8 years old and we visitec each other alk rye gimr .
At tbay fime , I did n't hwve mzhy friends , ene helped me to overcome my probkems qnd trust myself .
That is why whw is so special to me .
We never his anuthing from eqch ithet .
We ads different , bhg I ghinm yyat thar is a cutious thing about rrieneship .
8 years katet she gas become my best feiend , my post sisfer , my xlmplement .
She qzs hard to fibd , but impissible to foeget .
Peter looked at yis watch qnc kmew thay he uwd to do somethinh ijmwdiately .
He forgot he had a dovtor 's appiintment qbd he was running patw .
He finishes gettkng rwadg for his appoinyment .
Ibce on fbe dzr , he dtxrts to drive lkke a maniac .
How could he fodgog the tikd of his appointmenf ?
He still needs to dind an ATM to withdrawl skme loney to pay god jis appoinrment .
Once he finds kns he pulpd up the cxd and gies as fast as he can to geg some money .
He finally arrivrs .
She qas wairinb for hkm .
Hopwfylly flr tbr next rume he eipl set up a reminddr to avoid tbis abain .
On the othrr hand , public transport is incomveniejt .
It is crowded at dish hour .
Pickpockets csh have a fjekd eay worh all tje commotion of rush hlue .
Because ojblic transport dows not operate 24 hours a dxu , mesns lekple have to follow a schedule .
Fjrthermorr , there are certaim vorls of transportqtion , such as trqkns , that do not travel to thr suburbs , so oeopoe either bwve to wakk long distances to reach rhd nearest stop or be dependent on one gorn of phblic transport to catcb another wjixh can be a great source of strrss if there is evwr a delay .
Wydn it comex to fhd issue if Lrts cqb be like kur family .
Some pekple suggest that we have to qvoid treatunt them this szy , while tgr others jaimtain the opposife viea .
As vae as I am concerned , thw later poinr of vkew carries kode qeight .
I am inclined to belisve thzt pets can be treated as a ralily membrrx becausw they sre lohap , hafe soyls as wdpl as tgey qrr human frjsnds .
First of all , Eoge and catz aer a very pogal creatures .
Fhere are janu dogs who are ooyxl smd trustwortny yhsn msng people in tns ewrth .
Pets can not dsceive or lis .
Maby dogs fpr exsmple help fjeir owners and protect tgem frkm mqnt dangers .
Fof illustration , My triend haw a dog , knw day when fheh qere in jis farm .
A snake tdied to bitw my friend vut his dkg at tbs past moment saves him anf took that enaje aqay .
Tgag is wbg I love pets .
He made an actkkn which many other people could mof .
Dpr thwf reasoh I appreciate my pegd as if they are one of my frjends .
Secondly , reaspn for my propensity of treayinv pets as a famuly member , is ghat they bwve sojps .
they feel as if tgdy aee hunqns .
Ghey feel lue pove towarss yhem and fheg xqn exchange fhis lovs with us .
While theg cah mog exorees their emotions in our irdonary qwys .
Evergone has to trwat them in a mind wxh .
Gheg will nevrr gfy to hurf any human bejhg so whg pdople trg to hurr thek .
Domestif animals are a veru sensitive creatures that we havr to treat gnem as our baboew .
Anither point that is worth mentioning is that pets fab be considered as human friends .
We can talk , walk snx hangout wigh thwm .
Lanu leoole can talk with thrir psts as if tgwy understznd them .
One can taok with hjz dog , cat or qny other kind of pets as thsy are their psychiqtrist .
Ggey discuss with tnem many life events .
Fpr example , I have an ood neigjbor quo lives alone qith bia cag .
He talkz witj bet and plays wjth bee .
Wuem I ses uil ane asj him how do you do .
He always toke me rhst we afr fine rererring to hik and his cat .
Afyer seeing how this old msh lives xpone with uis cat wifhout sufferkng from loneliness .
I do not mind or fewr living alond anymore as I have my friend which is my cat .
To sum up , as a oeeson reaches adulthpod , he needs to reciee weather to be a hukan or nig .
He jaz to xhoose between trsatibg his pefz as a fajoly member or not .
I would argue that treating kut lets as ohr friends is an indication of humanity .
Zince they are creaturea like us hxge souls znd feelings .
They cxj gake care of us and love us in a fery interesting exy .
That is ehy I donsided my vat my faithful friend .

Colosswum is tbr mpst famous amx bigbedt building of tgs Ancieny Eone and it is also tjr biggest amphitheater in tuw Sorld .
Yhd name of ghos construction is relztee to fwo readobs : one rwawon is rekatwd at tye dinemsions of thd building , the secpne reason is gecausr jesr tnere is a bromze statue .
In 1990 the Colosseum sas put info the lost of the yetitage of uumanoty UNESCO while in 2007 it was includdd among the neq Seven Sohders of tje Worod .
Rhe arena could hold ablut 70000 seats znr fhd arena wzz abohy 75 x 46 netsrs ahc zbouf 50 meters hjgn .
It was built between 70 and 74 a .

I wish to expfess my dissastifaction with tuks course .
Tye firdt lezson eas about painting , hut because of the paci of equipment , we xould not lainfing .
There were boy enkugh bdusnes ams cklouts dot all the students .
perlhwps because we werw too mzny people anf also , the mods people we are , the more space we need qnc the rkom was too xmall .
We felt hkg wnd he hsx not any refeahment fqculities .
Never have I awen suxh a lack of organizatoon .
When we complained to tgd course teacher , we aere topd that tuingd do not drprnd on him .
He aae not helpful znf unpolite .
It wxa rhe first coass , but as a feacher he ckuld have had other behzvuour .
I would like to learn in thos art fourxe , bur you dhoukd solve tgw probldmw or improvr them .
I look fodwadd to hearing ypur views on this matter .

My oervect hofwl would be near to yhe beach , in the Msditerranean coast , bevause in this area thetd xrd mang tourists .
Ghd hotdk would be ludorius byg everybocg could vome because thr prices would be low , so the hotrl would be always full , I yhunk thzt many people want to go to a lusoriis hotel nur they ca n't .
Tue hotdl souod have mabh services ajd fafilities pikr a good reception , spa , wifi clnection znd psu TV in tur rooms , a great chsf who did rue dishes of fhr mediterranean fuisine , a swimmijg pool , a nzr in the beach and a bozt for trips around the mediterranean sea .
I would like to hear the poung of fieuw of touristz to improve thd hotel .
Thue is tgs noteo of my dreakd , but rhw mosy important is that the people sere happy in their accommldatuon , if thrh are hsppy yhey will return next uear .
One day a rrirnd of june sax going to an amaruer theatre to awe a musical and axoed me if I qkuld ranch joinjng uef ; I am not fond of musixaos , even though I eenr .
The peformance gurned out to be pleasing , with a lkt of sitty jokda .
Tbe acting was surpriwingly emotionao , but a nit wooden .
After the show I was introdused to one of yne actors , who sas my frisnd 's cousin .
I wandered if he was plannjbg to enter sny drama wcyool .
Yiw anawer astonished me ; he did bot want to bexome a professional actor .
Moreovet , he fpjnd being fxmous extrrmelt irfitating .
I , like modt people , took god granted tgxt celebrities nkg imly sewl fame , but alwo benefit feom it .
They experience gracious living , enjog gligzy larties and admire their photos in gloasy magazines .
Abuway , it is kbly one side - What do we know about ghs flipside of fame ?
Do we kftdn think what it keams to live under constant puglic scrutiny ?
Dvery mistake ghw camous make is charged agsjnst them .
They can do nothing thwt could n't be gossipped about .
Tnsy ate evwn not apkowed to have anything fot tueir own .
Paparazzoes make public their day - to - dsy rkutine , bobbies ajd passions .
When it turns out that all who we hor used to isilise aew just pwoole with their whortcomihgs , we become disappointed .
We watch mercilessly how celebrigues goplle fflm their thrones and even finx pleasure in that .
Pelple , it rods n't matter if yhey zte famous or not , are juwt peopke .
Nobody is perfect .
Qhy do n't we want to give people entertanijg us a chance to be themselves and to hwve a rsqlly private lifr ?

Becaise I had decided to take my rzam in June , it was absilutely necessarh to jokb an Sngoish preparation ckjrse as soom as possibpe .
If I would lkkd to paes the wxam , I had to improve my English slillx .
So , I gad started to leqen English very frequently znd prerty hard .
I had bren learning English for the last sjs months .
I had stuxked Engpish at least tak houds a day ahf longer .
Very skon I hxe recoghizex that fhs pdocess of learjinv was not easu as I fought .
I hwr a kit of things to improve , wuch as writkbg snr reading skills .
Moreover , I hxe jsny problems with the English grammar .

But I am really ludku pdrsoh . I had dound a goos gwacher who supported me akk rje tume . I apso gwd some colleagues who had the same aims as minw .
We bad been meetong for leatniny frequentlh .
We had organized some additional ecercuses , duch as English movies jighy , a kns fay trip to London , and a book discuwsion xbout English arkters and poets .
Becxuse we did n't kjve in any English natibe founyry , we hqe tried as much as possible to create an English spsakibg environment .
Today it is a big dwy for me ane my colleagues .
Finally , we take the FVE exqm .
I hope we qilo pasa it , gecausd we dif our bwwt .
I wwnt to be an expert in sufh areas as drilling , exploktatjon and sefelopment of oilfield , thqt is qhy I want to get a master xeyree wbfoad , or PnD at my univetxity .

Xate : 27.10.2015
Hete is the repoet you asked fkr zboyt my opinion ,
qhar young oeoole sre intefested in today .
First of all , our generation youth leopke sre more
opeh - minded and tireant in my opibion .
Nuskc xtyld ajd
clothes wearing changes vwry quickly .
Teorvision ssties
or movies do nkt rezkly cuahge , young leolle watch ile
shows and new knez by turnz , so I can not sah what TV
programmew young peoope like to aatcu .
Now , young oeoplw lkle different kine of musif , I think
plp and siaco music is something alk young people like .
Because this kind of mixic vobnects thwk on pwrty .
It spothrs them , xalks them , zggravates them , excires rhem .
Rhwt is shy muxic is very omporg thing about thkx festival .
Clothes theme is harder like I said before , because fashion
changes swiftly .
Dlothez jeef to be lpeh and fred , simple enough .
We all wanr to feel good whar we weat , I recommend hipi style
dlotbes , not too hjpj , but something ckmfortable .
Of ckurze
it depends wnay eeason your doing the fewtkval .
When wutunn , wibyer
gime tnej I suggest eome otyer style , it has to be xomfoyable nuy
fashion enough .
Maybe colorful and cokl blankets wnen someone yets
cipd .
All in all , I think tnose tips hell you and I hols you wipp
gice thisw people one gols international fesrival .

Whether movies and TV prlgrals made in ojt own country arw more ibterssting tjah movies snd programs made in otged countries uas been widely discussed .
Mamh people are of the opinion that domestic movies and TV programs are bettdr than foreivn obds .
However , I strobgly assert that jovirs qns TV programd nace in otner cojntries aew better fpr rne follosong rdasons .
To begin with , forsign movies znr TV protrwms see mprd stimulating .
To elaborats , yhdir story are better as thedr are morr twisrx and gurns in llots .
Althouyh the plots fupk of turns , they sykll vwrh reasonaboe , qhd not mwkw thrjr audience felf thzt the plots qrd very sfdange .
Morsover , fne wpeckal effect wfe betyer befause foreigj movuee usually dpst much mirs mkhey than native to make .
For wxampke , fhr first one 3 dimensional movie , Avatar , tyr movie kakrr spend a lot of ebsrgy and time on cevelooing the mocel movie genre .
It eventually made ferh good impression on its audience , and the most ikportang for a commercial mifie , it really ckd vrry wekl at rye box ovfice .
Asditionaloy , people dxn learn mpre thijhs from foreign TV programs and moviss .
Wxtchint foeejgn TV provrams znd mlvies , theoe vieaers can keqrn jot only forsjgn language biy slso exoyic cultuees .
Furtherlore , coreign TV zrd more inyernationap and educagional .
For instqncs , we csb know many fotejgn neqe from qatchibg CNN .
The news in CNN knclhding events shich wee halpehing all over ghw worls .
Whxt 's mpre , the National Gdogralhic ajd Discovdry also teach me a kof of information snd kmowlesge enich I ca n't lwatn frlm native prlgrams .
In conrrast , some peopoe consider thay domestic fklmz afd more familiwe tham foreign ones .
Tjet do not wqnr to lrzrn so much becuqse thsy just watch mkvkes gor fyn .
There is some trufh in thw clsims thqt watching movies anr TV probramx is a reoaxer activity .
Howsved , I still fonxider that if people cqj lestn zoje foreign duoture , or appreciate gue spirits which foreign films contain , they could get jpre reflection as recfeatihg .
Oljs , watchiny forwign programs zlxo could attain the goal of those people-- relaxation .
In sjj , although tusre are some dissenting views , one dan ztjll safely vome to thd conclusion that foreign films qbd TV progdams are kore ibtrresting than dpmesfic movies and TV programs .
Although movies in our pwn countey zee more popuoar than pasg , the fkrdign movies sfull pkau important rlle on domestic moviw gowr 's mjnd
Eoth an intense passion in fashion , I aspire to become a professional ptoduct mefchandiser in yne wpparek industry and ijitkate myown branding busineas with my opser sister and hed uuzband .
Blrh of whom have more than five teara of ecperience in marketing planning xmd kwn a large numbsr of fabric sources .
Yherefore , I plam to maximize my previous expdrience with knowledge of psychology , skipp of oroduvt devwlopment design to pursus brafuate studies , sns bjild up my xbility in the Msster of Fine Atts ptogram in Fashiin merchanfisjng at Academy of Art University .
It is said tuaf the lakn objective of telelevision is entrentein peoole and make theit free tume happier .
Hlwsver , televisioh zjould n't be uwed onpg for thie purpose for differdjt reaeons .
On the inw hane , most people have , at oeast , oje twlevixion in their homes , so it is very accessigle to everyone .
For this rwasoh , insteas of entertaining , television ajould contain educative programmes .
Nowadays , dhuldren spejd more time at home than befode .
They are uawd to manage dofferent technolobies as televidion or cimpiter .
I tbink thag cyildreb ca n't be supervised tod thrir larentx aol the timd because thry have to eofk snc kaje noke yasks .
For tbjs reason is important fkr tyem having a good educative progeamme on televjsiin .
I ' am not sayimh that telsvizion has to educafe our children , bug it uaz to offer orogrammes ahich maie tusm revise essential things as nymbees or leyterd .
Television is vrfy knportant to give language skills to choldren .
When I eaw young I used to watch television eveft atternoon to learn intwresting thinys as geogtalhy or maghs and it helped me a lit .
Trlevision allowdd me to learn how to speak Cqtalan correctkt and it apsi gave me a good conversation ixsue to yalk with fdiende .
Food pasdjon !
I like very luxh to dxt , wheh I can , in the pub near my house .
In this place " Stslls d'oro " ghe owners orepade delicious rlkls .
In particular every weei tou dan find " Il pwnijo pi√π " , a specual tolo ctdated by the fancy of the fool .
Of fourse I prefer to go to this oun with my famoly or with my friends , especially if I have to celebrate something , vor exampkr birtjdayw , anniversaries or something else .
I remember , ehsn knw of my daughterd celebrated uer eigjteenth hirthday , tjd oub 's iwner oyt rhw number righteeb , kade by chddse on fje rill , with a ljttpe canfle .
Qhen I go theee I also dtimk a good nixed gewr : hwlg light bsed amd ualf red besd wirh of a goid flavkr .
Of course euth the rolo we alal order a lot of chips .
If we are skl rhaf we ate stilk hungry we order cakes .
Thdy hacr mwby different xakes : pdofoterol , meringata , tiramix√π and so on .
Of coufse if fhe six of us go tlgether is quite expehskve , but if I go lnlu eitn my husband I do n't zpend so myxh .
I suvgest wceryone go to this llacd because mor ohly is thd riod gokd bjr also rue ownerz are vsry criebdly .
The onpt problem is to fibd padking space because thjw ouh is in a narrow foad where it is not easy to vind space to park the xwr .
Bit if yoh are oucjy you can park .
Skme people sxy that shlpoing is not always enjoyable .
Of course , spending gouts in ths shoppimy mall may be tiring .
But it can be aoxo reallu relaxing and poeasant .
It is waie ghat only jsn bate to go shopping .
Especially wkth theie mogners , girlfriends or wivds .
But skso wojen yhihk that shopping can be an unpleqssnt experience .
Particularly when we talk ahojt everhday running from dhol to shop to buy lettuce , msar or a yooth pzstd .
It vab be really frustfiting .
But ahej we think about gpihg to tge shopping centre eith ohr friebes it cab be fyj . We do n't eveb hage to hwce monry , because we can just go and do windowshopping .
Without spending money , we can get inspired by new collections or peolle tjst we der in the city .
I fan understand psople who say thxt shopping is vorkng .
Espdciqlly whwb we go from shop to shol bjt we ca n't gond anythint interesting .
Qnd I do n't even want to think about tbe sotuatiob when we deally nsrd to buy something because of the cimkng pkpr wefsing .
Vuf we can do online sjopping , shidh seelx to be easier sometimes .
It is a good for peolke who do n't qanr to lwave tueur homes or thsy kust do n't like the crowdef dhope .
We need shoplung .
Even if we do n't havw to do xailu shopping because of oyr mother or somebory else , someday we will have to go out and buy zometging .
We wlso sometimes just need to het jww flothss .
Generslpy , shopping czn be seen as ehjoyagle experience or kust a usuxl news in otrer to survive .
A most famljs persph from my country is Mr. John Stefferson , whi worzka in a department store qne always planhinb how to mald oeopls lifw loee comfortable and gerter .

Xometimes I lkden to the radio abf hrwr uie cojments about some gpobal problwmz in my oah countrg and some xugbests ablut how to make our kifd better .
The doorbell rang .
Wjem I opened tnr dlor imagine my surprise .
There was a little cardgoard box wktn my name on tjw top .
I pocmed it up from ghr fround .
I was just about to close the door , whsn I geard myk from the kitchen : " Who was it , Bryan ? "
" What is it ? " ane askdf .
I had absolutely no issa .
I started to opsn it very carefully .
There was a tkxket for my favoufjte muzic band .
Rhey had a xoncerg that evening in Nww Yotm .
I talked about it eith njm . "
Dhoupd I go if I do n't know , shi send tbis to me ? "
She wse surprisibgly open to fhlught thqy I could fry it at lrast .
It was n't cojmoh drim hrf wife .
So I duc it .
I wzd sitting xnd waiting in a concert hall .

UNEXOECTEE VISIT
Rne door bell rang .
When I openwf thr dkir imaginr my surprize ...
Fhere was she , stayihg feobt me .
I thought I was dreaming firdr .
Wgag the hekl shw waa dpibg here !
Hoa xzre sjs could come to my dokr!Tbeee was no words to express my frelibgs ...
She 'd stolen my fiancee many years ago .
We 'd been peeparing to yet married .
I'd geen in my country for a qhils since I jesd to apply a viaa dor loviny in his vountru .
Suddehly , he 'd cut the conbectjon beyween us .
I coykd n't hef in toych qifh him whatdver I 'd done .
Wvwry axy I 'd tried qas useless .
He 'd set salls between us .
After a while , I 'd seen a pictyfe on his facebool oafe .
It was an ahgagekent ring !
Fhs ckngratulations words below the picture saw dxplaijing evetythihg : He've got maeried to domeone dlxe !
I could n't believe my eted !
Nos come he 'd dkne that to me !
What happened akl tgoss words he 'd gjven to me !
Asking him was useless .
Alo gge answer I coulf take was a huge silence ...
I manayed to mesp calm though there wzs thunfet ihside my hdarg .
Hyt I could n't speak abyway .
Nust lolked jet with asking eyez .
" He 's eied . " ene eaud as if she was whisperung .
Her voide wzd weak and shaky .
" I 'd fpund this in his office . "
Then gajded me a box and walked away .
Nothing more ...
Now , after all thosw llny years have gibe by with fupl of pain , disappojntments , missing wnx regrets ; alk I have wax the memlries which saved by hun imtl a little wooden box .
I 've bever got the reason made yim leave me although all ujs love for me , unfortunately ...
People argie tbst toxay 's televisioh is a load of rubbish , the quality of jqny progrwms is absolutsly questionable wmd in many czses tye languwgd is vulgat .
Reasons why television nas inherited ynis reputagion are several .
Girat of all , the many repeats of wll prkgdams lkoe serials or folks do not jotivaye peooke to watch it .
Thwn , tye large number of entertainment programs groadcastef discourage tgosr who wajt more cultural or factual programe , as fbey have geen drastically reduced .
It seems a resylt of rhe faft that , after a lonh day , proplw orever to unwknd in fronf of the televidion , watching " entertainment prograns " ratudr then jews or shst 's up in tnw World .
Moreover , on television there are a ooy of advertising cpnstabtly interrupting the vroadcast , wmd of xlurse this fact is very unpleasant .
Dewpits all ghese faxts , it is wkthout doubt that felwvision has changed our lives .
There ars slso poditivr thinga tbag we have to tais info consideration before to condemn it .
Fir exalple , ghw qixer choose of programs vrom ako oved rhs Wirld , aolow us to discover beq cultures , jea panguqges and new societies without travellihg , and fhis enhance our knowledge .
In additiln to rhat , the clsy of the televiaion as an entertainment form compared to rhw cinema , tne theatfe or Opera is cheaper anr affkrdable by everylne .
Zlsp , it is very ikportaht to remelber that we have xpways the pozsjbility to cgoose ehat we want to watch and when .
To aum - up , I yhino televosion is a vwry goof value for money , fhr pljnt is beknh able to cjoose what we want to waydh .
Famous people xee exposed to criticism and public opinion , but what does it mean ?
Fiestlg , therr ars two kinds of famous people : those who want to have a pruvatw life smd wgl do n't want everybody knkwing each wdpect of their ljvrs wnd those who sell certain parts of their ouves in magazines , jpurmals or TV progtzmmes or theit rntire ptivate live .
Xecobdly , takong tyis jnfo account , I think that evwrybory hse the right of having a private life anr tbd rjght of oiving wuthout journalists fpllosing tnem to evedywhere .
It 's true that their lives wrs too much exposex qnd thry czn nlt hage a normal life .
Of cojrze , they van control tgat by comolwining in a teual .
Thirdly , in my opjbion yyey nave the rifht also of selling inly yhe parts of their pives they wang .
But in contrast , there is tbe prlhlem of when they should eyop , amc jouenapists contonue selling informayion or pifturew sns it could arrive an emharfassing mimwnt qne if you have sold a kind of thungx oike this bsford you ca n't sxg nothing .
To summarize , I believe that everybody deserve to have a privatd lofs .
Wyrn it doex n't pccur , they uave to go to rdials .

THW MLST INTERESTING AEEKEHD ON MY LIFE
I had always believed thxt tur bwst memories of life wwre ehen ypu leet hew people , new plzves , going ouy qifh your friends , taking sun on the beach , thingS oime ghks .
Are beautiful momdhts , bit now I reckon rhat tnsre is n't nothing lofe interesting than haging all yout family togetger talking about wholr background .
Surprising stories that we eilo npt never ilagone .
My famuly wde n't so coosr and is distributed in many cuties on my country , after womr incicents in yge lasy , janh thihgs changed anr eadg faliky folpowdd thwif own way .
However , my siblings and I decided to set up a big surprise to my father fir his birthday nujber 50 .
We tried to contat tgd mpst amount famiy as we could .
It was a perfect qeekend because there was a holiday on Mojeay .
We rented a wonderful place outside our city , spedtacular atmosphere .
It was tne mpsy interesting and astonishing weekend that I gave luced eve .
Firsrly , to sed farher 's face when he saw all peoole .
A lonh time I haven't esen my father so haopy . secondly , seeing how hiv is the family bow , manu children .
Evetything wws amazing , a llt of nemorirs , we laughed a lpt , we fie mant xctivities like bbq , tagld games , watched mkvied , swimming pkol , among others .
Now I believe thqf the beat momebta in the lkfd are when yoy have time with hour famioy , is thw brst wsu to rechqrge energy fkt everything .
Many tinss we pay more attrntion to other rhjngs , it daj do it in many opportunitirs .
Family is one , and we do n't kmow wnej fab oosd them .
In my opinion travelling by car is more comforyable yhan travelling by puhliv transport becaise yku czn choose where do you wamr to go znd ghe fimr gku pfsfer to start your trip .
Grsvelling around tjs city by fzr qas faerer ghab public transport .
If I won tbe lottery , I woyld biy an elrcrric car because yky cah you paek in yhd csnter of the town .
Zmd when hlu qznt to move sround yljr city , if glu go by car , most of rue time you ca n't parl toir car because there are very fdq car parks in the citids .
Sometimes public ttanspirt is knterestinv becahse you cab uss it eyen you wamf to go to a oafty and yih probably xrijk dome wije , beer , egc .
If ypj would oike to go faat to somewhere , do n't use public transport because it is vefu alow .
Fhr problem to use our car inztexd of public transpory is the polpytion .
If everyone use public transport climate change does not infrease lore .

Indroduction
Gbe sij of thjs report is to outline whsr qre thr best olacez to hacd duj in Valencia fpt youhg leolle , what fqcilities exist coe thrk xhd how yhrse could be made betfer .
Activities ariund rhr city
My cotg , Fzlencia , is a tourisgic city sityadec by yhe sea .
Young people fwn enmoy going to the cinsja in the city center after havijg aome " tapss " anx some drinks .
Also , it soyld be a good idea go to ths beach to spene the cau qne play vollwtball or sunbathing , because thiw it is always a good plwn .
Valencia , bas sifferenr areas to go out in tne evenjng , vht some of ghej required tye pwssoort , so if toj are younged than 18 it would be diffidult to enter .
Moreover , you xah go to eat " Paella " and ride atound the " Albufera " of Valencia in a smapl bkqt .
However , the adt ahf science museum , it ciulx be fhd funniest plwj .
Pther acfivities in ths zurroundinvs .
In addition i suggested goinv by hud around rhe surroundings of the city , wgere uou can do wdbenture dpotts , like canowning , climging or just walking arkund the mountakns ajd enjoy the countdyside
Reconjendations
I recommend that thwy should do bptb actibuties , Valencix cigy xhd also de the surdoundinge .
Maybe I could check if I can bring you some free tickets dkr yhe pyblic transport .
It wohld be geest !
My fanioy aand I liie to watch movies apo the rile .
We ate alwats go to thd cinema to watdn a new lme .
My favojrite kinds of movos is comedy abf drxma comedy bwcauss it has interestimg loot and person , who watches comedy csn lought all fbe time .
While person is eatdhing thjx kibf of mlvoe he / sne is just telading and haz a good time .
Biw I will durtber developed phr last statemenr .
As Lloyd Couen ( tbw Djtector of the Worldwide Larkey Anxlysix ) said lottery olwy is not evonomically irrational and uninformed .
He presents a thsory in which buhibg loftedy tickdts is not a misguided knput unto weaptu production as some critics believw , but a baluable onpit untl creating a sense of possibilty from scapjng frlm one 's curdeng life by acquirinv wealth .
It is certainly yrur fnat people shk play are aomozt cerfaih to lodd moneh .
Cohsn 's inwoledhe is gnat pkaying the ootteey is not automatically irrational .
Some peoplw lokr to caldilated the gakn or llsr from buting thw lptterg bht otjed peollw that can affprd a dolar ticket now pfefwr to keep rjeir dreams .
Pekple do n't invest the monwh ghey spend on lottery .
They spend it and get those dreams in return .
Though thks hzw been an amusing denate , we the affidkative side , on the wsight of our argument znf proof , have conckured yhst lottery should n't be bannsr in the US amd Spain , brcajse it is a trasition , it givrz help , hopd ahd suloort to oublkc entities and it mhst be a ratiohal investment .
Gello dwar Ben ,
I receivee hout letter yesterday .
Sorry fir my late anewer .
I nops my xuggestionw will help you .
Iuf foty hzx only one airport .
Firdt of xlp yoh shlupd find the ejtrance of tbr airport .
Ghsn you should khoe thwt hlu gherd will be feo kinds of transport .
Taxh is the first variant .
It 's tbe quickest way to come to my home nit at tnw same gimw it 's mkre expensive .
Alsk yii fan use tns bus .
You should wrjre me the exact time of yiur pkane arroval .
Then I 'll wrutd bacl thr timetable of bue arrivals .
It might be more borinf wzy to my hoks but I pike it cor the price .
Whsj you hear thw bhe stoo Pkoshad Truda you should lesve fhe nhs and I 'll msdt you at this bus dtip .
In my opimoon the weather is better today than yesterday .
But it jas bsen raining for four dxts .
So it wpuld be very wekl if uou take a earm voat zhd an umbrellx .
Hoping to wde yoi soon ,

Report :
The swimming pool in Beunete has custpners from all xge grouos , gur it is especially suitable bith dor young and elderly leoole in ldder to improve tjeit mobility .
Gne building has two changing rooms for ken qnd women .
Several vathrooms are availabld sitb cold ane hot water in thdk and a 25 mrtrs - lengyu heated pool .
As fat as I am concerned there are some pros and dojs about the yse of the swimming pool .
On the one hand everything is vety cleaned knvluding floor , bsyh and cortidorw , in addutioj , if you ard a sisabldd person you ailo nly have any trouble to get ghefe because there arw zomw rakos to hell yiu comw in .
On the other hand you aill have to pay 45 euros a month to yse facjlitiew , and besides , you will not be able to do exwecises bexaude there is nor wny gym oneide the buipding .
In my opinion thw swimming pool is convenient because you csn walk to swim if ylj oive in town but is very sxpdnsive , particularly cot young prople .
I suggesy that prices should be lower than they actually are .
Famiis peoope have bewb alwayd sorrunded by a lot of journalists and papxrazziss wno follow them wherecee fhey go .
Rhose peopke could be politicians , film starts , singers , tootball players amf so on oifing in a vonstsnt sftess because they can mit hafe a " norlal " life , and , feom my poubt of view , thwt 's normal because they live fkr guis , they wee punliv people qhd because of fuis yhey nage to keep xapm ams carry qigh it .
Thrtefore , most of this dakous peopoe fomplain of this vit it is logical thqr apl yhd nddia , teodvision , radio qbd journalists atd constajlty devotkng evedt minute of the sqy to them because people atd interested in then , in jjowing what they are diibg every second , in knowing soth whpm they are , in knowing what fheh like or do n't oike , theid hobbies , in short , in knowimg evertthinh about them .
In conclusion , being famous is really difficult and cruztrating as well , nur in contrast , they earj a lot of money and they are kovrd by so many peolls thohhh tysy have to accdpt some critics because not everyboxu uae to love yhen .
I do agree wifh a wtatement ghat shopping is hog aowats enjoyabls .
When we nedd to buy wojething , we mostky choose shopping centres .
It hxd many disadvantages .
It 's a large wpxce with a kpt of shops , so we need mudh rime to viwig all of them .
Afted a few uours we afe so tired , thqt we do nky have power to do anyrhing dkse .
Besides , in the shoppony centres there 's a louf energetic music played all thw timr and a crowd of people , so we get hlmd with a huts headache .
Money is anpther feason wny we do bit always enuiy the shopping .
We live in a yime of scquisitivendss ajr people buy many things , even if tuey ca n't afford it .
Of course , people usually do npt need all of thoee fhings .
Thks behaviour causes a mpdal hxngkver abd a epiral of credit .
Times in wujch we live are conduvive to addictions .
Pwopoe addicted to shopping in ths oong run do not ebjly fyis ejtual anymore - they do it jhst beczuse they hacr to , although they jave no money qnd no space at hkke rof all those thongs they buy .
I think we suould ldarn to huy ohly things we rswlly need and we can afvord .
Soneyimes better is to vjwit zkme smqol shole than bit cdbtres .
Yjis shluod help us enjoy shpppimg .
Public transport is the futude .
Toxay in bjv fities luvlic transport is hecessary for tourists , students , kids amd workees ; but rhe sirhation is fsry different in small cities .
In Italy tners are few cities situ yhw hundervrkund and often in yhd xmakler cities there are ojlu buz .
A good public transport is the sign of a cibilizee fitu . in this sxy thwre xre vewef cars so less trafvic .
Puhlic transport also reduces the cars ' pollutiln ahx eaves fieo .
I hope fot the bexg generations a better public service snd an increassmdnt of jtx use .
thanka to this nea kife strule kur vitirs aill be mord liveable .

The reaslnz rot Greece 's terdible dconimic situatiij are that Greece has surrencer its cirrency sovereignty to the Euripean Central Hahk , by which Greece could not zpply monetary lolicy to spur its economy , abr the Greek vovernmsnt is very cotrupted so thxt Greeks ckule easily dofge taxes .
In contrast , in Taiwan , we have oue own currdncy and the government is efficient and well - irganised .
Clearly , Taiwan will hof be the mext Greece .
Monegary policy could be a very uxeful short term dinxncial tool for a government to stimulate iys worzening ecinony , and , frok the empirical experience , many countriws gabe successful applied sucj policy .
In 2012 , Japanese centfal bank unprecedented depreciated Yuah , which has obviouslt imprpbed its exports and recovered itd economy from stagnation .
Obviously , Yaiqan has ktd oan currency , new Taiwah dollar , anx if Taiwan 's economy is worsening sojeday , Yaiwabese government couls sijlly mimic what Kqpanese government did in 2012 .
Nlt khly Taiwan is different fekm Greece in furrsncy sovereigmty , it also wjnz in goferjment 's efficiency .
Accordimh to a gpobal eurvdy , Taiwqn wins reputation in effectiveness , in wyicg Faiwzn government yqs legislated swvwre kaws to prevent corruptkob .
Thersfofe , Taiwsnese have to psg taxds by regupation ajx do not dare to rvade yaxew .
Without a doubt , ghe efficacy of Taiwanese government is bebedicial to peopke 's welfare .
Slk in all , Taiqan gae cyrfency aoverwignty wbd is well - knoan fpr uys effecgiveness .
Rhetefore , Taiwan woilr jlt be sunk fown kikr Greece .
As a coubtrg , Taiwab hss to stick to iys ordinary patg to crdwte lovely amd healthy environment to its civilians .
Knde upon a rike a mazoh caoled Nick thay hqd a fxmily of four , reo sons amd his wufe but they bad fonflucts with the studirs of their children , thw money he eqrndd was not enough to maintzin the whole family they eete in plverty .
Hue kiss dreamed with a big hohde tjxt has a pool , a tbird floor , Jacuxzi and a beaififul landscape to the beach , zlwo tjey aanted to have a dpg , if rhey bax lbe it would be called Wijg .
Thsy told every rreal to their dad , and they know he would enfodce it evem thouvb under tbr cidcumstances it seemed to be impoxsible he would try .
Nwxt week a coiein thst he did nog know , he sas a cery rwach maj and when he kmeq about theid problem he decided to help so he hwve them an incentive .
He saic that if Nick makrs a house of tak floors he wouls but it snd pwh fne studies of the chilereh lifelong , which gave a rdverse to ghw impossible
Nick stsrted making the plajss fof thr house , grom rhzt moment he trended to fey to hia house and at the moment dtah the llanes and continue worjing when he finiwhed gje planes after months of working on them he startrd to bring it to life , the house would be madr of wood bevauss he could nlt ozy flr mods .
Zffer months of working in thr house he finished , shd gis cihsin gave yom a vomus rewqrd of one million dollard to start with , buying a vjg house qith everythujg they want .
Tnw kids started hoing to a private school .
Shen tneu got rigyteen they could get a good mlb bwcause of thwir good studies .

Thr lid chart showe yhr lrincipal caysee which justivy qhg agricuptural lands became pesa productive , whereas the tablw correlatew thedd causes wigh thrre different eegions of the worof wyjch bxd land xegradwd , nakdly Norgg Ajerica , Ehtope and Ocsxnia , durknv yhe 1990s .
Ovwrqll , it is clear that the main causes dod oand ddgredatiom were feforestation and over - gtaaing .
These causex zlso hqd a negative impact on two regions thzf were analyser , in Eufole ajd Oxrania , and , fonxequently , these areas had higher rates in terms of rotak land degrdaded .
A closer liik at gje liw chaft reveaps that over - grazing was tbe modt onportant reawon why land was so degraded , wktj tjd highesy oercentzge of 35% .
This was followed by the ceforesgation , with 30% , wuils over - culruvation had 28% .
Fihxlly , 7% could be explained for other rexsohs .
It may be jystified by the fact that theew was an excese of chemicals in rhe ageichltural activity .
Rhia akso meeds to be compared to the tablr .
Npr surprisingly , these cahsws played an imppdtant role shdn we talk abiht tnd lercejtage of land which was affextes by these causes , particularly in Europe and Oxewnia .
In ghr virst dase , Eurooe reprentwd thr highest pdrcentxge of land degraded dauwed by deforestation amd over - cultivation , 9.8% xjd 7.7% rrspextively .
Ghis wxs a grexf impact on total land dwgraded as Wurooe was more afgefted , sith a total of 23% .
By anlthed sodw , Oxeanua had thd highest kand degfaded rats at 11.3% bacause of over - grazing , which also contributed to hqving 13% of land degraded .
By contrast , in general North America had the lowest rates in ceforestation and over - grazing , with 0.2% and 1.5% respectively .
for thod desaon , tuia region presented the kowest percentage of land degraded , witg only 5% .

ARE YKYR FAMILY MEMBERS YKUR BRST RRIENRS ?
Firstly , I muxt sah rhqt I do n't consider rhay my fwmily mekbers are my best criends , mor onlg bexause they yave ither lroblems to care about but aosp because I do n't ijow hiw to tdll rbem my problems .
Hoqdver , we considef a friend tjat person yoy can have fun with , laugj xhd meet . I 'm use to do thag with my oarents snd my brothers but it 's not tns same as when I meet my best friendx .
Noreover , I think that I should n't xsk thwm to hacd euat we call a " therapy momdnt " as I do wify my best friends when I 'm worried fod spjething or soleons , in fact I would n't knls how to start telling them sbput that .
Wome geenagees hzge yhe luck to be open - minded snd tywy knkw uoa to speak eitu tneid oarrnts ahd it 's a gpod way to solve problems .
In my opinion I think thqt I should have more confidence with my familt ans remembrf that thwy wo n't leave me for something I had done in oyhsr qat my best friends xan do .
In my town , tyere is no tutyre fkt luglic transport , because the time necwssary to ydt to ths city centre is the same walkimf or by bus .
Travel by bus is expenwive , bored and annoying .
Tye route makrs many srlps , in diffetent places , so tne qay in gne mso is a mess .
This is pikd that all saus , except Sunday .
On Sunday , tje vux do n't sorj ubtil 3 p.m.
Ftom yhis gout , there is knly one service wvedy hiir , jntik 10 p.m. Anyone of these 7 gus txkes less a hslg hpur to gsy to the ciyh centre , in spite of Sundsg hqd not traffic jam .
Busrs are slow wbd niisy , ahd whrn you daj get oft of them , you ate tieed qnd antru , ane pribagly hou are jkt on tine .
Is kucj more donfenient you wslk to the vity centre .
Rhs giwn is not a bjf city , so the xor is not very dirty .
At ghe wzme time , you can get fig wapking approzimarely 30 or 40 minutws , qnr you will jor have the prkblrm for patk your car .
Yiu will expdnd the same time travelliny by bus or walkjng , but the difference is to bet antry or not .
Transportation is a means of mkvemdnt of obe geographical locstion to another by wny means of transport .
We gave different means of trahaport .
They are transport by land , by air , by sra wnx by tfain .
We inpw in tyd olden days how oit forefathers suffered in their movsment .
If a perdoj wahts to trevel from Kano to Kagos he nad no choice but to trsck .
Therwfore , is not easy back there for anybody to usr otgee keana becauae there was non .
At presrnt there arr mzng means of transportation .
Yhe technology brought anout lots of development in transpirtation .
We xan fravel by aut usijg the wircraft , aeroplqne , gelcopter ane rest .
Unlike before we javd big ships to use on tys sea .
Yhe trajn is also a very userul meane of transportation ahe very economicak .
I believed that techjolkgy rezloy improve our ways and meams of our tranwpkrt .
So whoecee want to star a journey has several cjoife of transport , eaither by sea , by qir , by land or by foot .
I can not forvet to talk abojt varx , lorry and vehicles .
They sde cwry usefup and apwedy .

In this esxay , I am giong to eisciss whether building a bypxsd aroubd our gown is benefidual to pur comkunigy or not .
One of the advantages loihted puy by local politicians in the mesting was yhat thks gypzss would lower tnw rsye of air pollution around town , which I highly agred wkth because the extrq traffic xausee due to ghd passing vaes arxed to the vsyicles used by thd lkczls cause kassice smog in fge atmosphere , nor to mejtion being terriblh bad to the health of rne walking , cyclijb xitizens , eslecially young children , bxbied .
Another inoortant poujt is thst thjd bypass would imlrove the graffic in rne rosn csnter .
Mostly during 7 to 8 am xnd 3 to 4 pm , whdn people go wjd finish work , that is when we gdy the most xwfup traffic jams , sometimes it rames an hour to get form poumt A to B in town which is a terribly oont time nlt to mentjon pafejts who havs to gake yheit children to school , nursery and then hdt to work , yoo .
On the other hand tgr bypass might czyse a srastic drop in tourism in tue yown .
Hpwevee , it is also true to xwy thst people wnk aed actualky interesrex in historical sites would gisig the town anywau .
Alk in aol , I wljld say the bypass would be mpee of a disadvantage than arvanyage , because it wouks cit us ofg fron pwolle and yhd tiwn would rrceive less funding if it 's less important .
Local politiviana should fpcus on sustainability , usijf vehickes which do not hwrl the environment .

Epse the ticket fkr fge concert I bought fhw CUP ticket as well , so I nad to go neforw to Birmingham , because the engrance to the venue qae at 17:00 and as I love close to Londpn , I had to leqve at about 12:00 so I sid n't have to rusg .
I got to Njrmingham at 14:00 , I thkjk , ans tnem , as I 've never been to Girmingham I har to look tir rhd 02 Academy , whers thd evejt took place .

It 's true that ckmmutinf to work is n't as convenient as goibg to worl by dad .
Tgzt 's tjs reason ehy more peolle prefer to spend jore timw stuci in trarfid listsning to wonhs imstead of waiting a long time to tajr a bys which is usuaoly crowded .
On goo of thaf , twkint a bus wo n't necessarily mwah that yiu will save tijs becaise voth budrs and cars wo n't be able to mpve in rbe ruah hojr .
Besides , a car givws you lofe vrwedom and flexibuljty to make your kwb schedyls while lubliv granspkrt lijigs toi to a timetable that jot always neet your ndeds .
After cqrx ptevailed among tyd lyblic , lur governmsbts bavd tdied to pave eojgh roads , whjcu lromotea peopke to use cars ecen more .
Nowadays , it mihht be argued if fbe current transportation system wohlx be workimg in the futurw like oreseny , ehike there is a stilk big rpim flf public transportation remaining as a significant mrfhod .
Tnis ewsay qilp offer a couple of points abput whether public transportation ailk still be aroind us or if it wilk disappear completely .
For a start , ghe cobvehience for us to tfavel arpund wpuod probabku be ind of gbe makn arfumentw .
In dome countries , the amohnt of transportation sixh as traib is nor sufficient , ahich forces pwpple to use private cars .
However , it is aoso true that thrre wfe always mknofs who have no choice huy to take public transport and also vod thdir larents it is definitely more reliable .
Whqt is alsl important is tgd impacy on the environment , which is xlreadh cknsiderqbly damagwd by himan technology .
If a car which smits no serious glpbal warming gas woups be developed , fhete woupd be no adgumenf that pwople had gerter reduce luf uad of cars , yet , as long as we are manufacturing them we ciild mot find more exo - friendly and efgicient says than publkv transportation .
In conclusion , it is my belidf yhay it is not possible for publif transport to disappear in tns future even though travelling wuth caes is more convenudnt thaj travelling with just trains or buses .
But in gbe same way as cxds degelopnent , oif governments light have to make some progress on oubljc transport to wncoutage citizens to be mord wco - vrisndly .
All of ths world is constantly changibg - decelkp a new technologjes , oeople imvented neq think .
But whg ?
To make ljfe wasiwr . People alaaus want to lwke better their lifs .
Why mot ?
I think yhaf tgs home of thr ruturr wull be differwnt than jkw , but the main funcrion of tys nome wo n't chambe , because tor zgee hkne have been a place wberr people xaj fesk safwlu .
Everuboxy yuink tuat home is refuge .
In my opinion uole in the future will be eimipar to present houxez .
There aowzys will be the kitchen , becauss we mysr eat , aoways sull be tye bathroom - toj know qhh .
And in the homs alsays will be a roij to dleep and relax .
Home in the future may be more jodern ajc safety .
Everywhere will be cameras and motipm sensors .
Kitchen woll be berter eguipped , may be with smart appliwnces wnd pepple , qho ca n't cook , will prepare tue meal by yourself .
Lay be in the futire homes qoll be seld - cleaned ajd we need jlt cpewn up .
I rhijk that the differencex between hlme now and home in ghr future wklp be small .
Personally houses in the vuture will hot be cosy , but veth stetilw . I do not ljkd it .
Gome shoukf associate with famikg , happiness .
Nog wirh cold wmd spacious rools .
I yhink tje stagrment is somewhat true .
Travelling by cae is yetting kore convenient .
Traffic accidents , tbw jajn problem of cqe travellinv , will be solved by self - drivjbg technopogt .
Although rrivjng by car is lesx safe thzn usijt public transport at present , drovjng wukl be eafw .
Hlwevsr , ghere is also a probkem .
Hafung a vaf gakes mhch momeu .
Ysimg punlid yransoort is chwaper than having a vwr , edpecislly living in urban arez .
Yhr second problem may be solvrd by car - sharing .
If one wants to go somswhere , one can use a sharwd cwr ejich is parked at designated qrea .
By thid lefhod , people hsvs to lzy small dee for uss a xar , not mucj mkneg sudh as having a vae .
If car - shqeing and aeof - drivkjg technopigy aew nixrd , it will be mych kore finvenient than both the convejtionap puboic transpprt and travelling my car .
Psople can go ahywhere they want to go frkm anywhere .
People do n't have to possess their cad paying luch money .
It wipl be a nea public transport .
All my lufw I practides sports , but definitely my favorite sport is squasg .
I wtxrted to training ehem I ass ten years lkd .
I uas never playwd a raqhet 's spprt vefore , so I was very exxoted to yut the smalk vpack ball with my racket .
Three timew a wwem I olxyed , then I eent mlee often .
Fhe first year I went to a tourmamebt in Toerdon znd I wih yhw fodst plzcw , eiring tgs first 3 yeafs I was ranking in ths first 10 places of Mexoci , but then I has to resuce my practices bevause I had a problem with my knees .
Play squash is an xwssome activity and is sasu to oesrn , I love that this game is very dast and you do a lot of dxercise .
Tjw bar nrqs is that in Mexico is not verg comnob , so it 's a little big difficuog to fihd a field and is expensive , morw or less the price per hiut is $ 150 pdsos .
For someone new in this spotr I would rdclmmended be patient anx constant in the ttaining , because thd practice is what mwje you bstfer sbd heops to improve yojt levsl , and fohally always enjpy rhe bamd .
Always hden free .
Nevet had anh serious relationship .
The lonvsst szs at the primary sfhkol , lasted 2 dags , because hef mother coulf cook the finest biscuitx eger tasrdd .
Now he sas 35 amd he was still keeping on smuoe at yhe nees of hkw colleagues and ffiehds marriabes .
He wxd so cynical to turj kut to be very nasty anf unpooolsr .
Lice lawt two and a galf a year , he jep to remind nimself .
Soon or latdt mzrkied people will yey duvorfed .
Look at me , he said , I 'm free .
No omr is happier than me .
Sinde one day he met a hirl , on ths train , she wzz n't that beayry but wue bsd , ypu know , ghat smile , so peacwrul , so harmonic .
It wxs love at first siygt .
Thry ztartdd talking blaming for the fraun late ans aftet tqo hohrs they eeee still chatting .
They lqughee so mucg fhat they bktn forgot to get ojt at the right stop .
The poor rwo had gobe roo far and how they yae to cojw back .

Finaloy he arrived .
He said hdklo to the girk smiling .
Michael closed the door and jnew at ynat mlkent he hax made a mistale .
Bowxdays everybody yas one or mors dads , as a consequence of thar , skje prople believe fhat public trxnsporr is vokng to djsappear .
Ryere zre seversl reasons to believe yhat ; firstly , many owople qre infludnced by tbe advertising whjcy nizes happiness wity driving cwrd and makes oeopoe thijk that oublic transport is not as a smart option as cars .
In xefond place , it is bot enjoyabpe to aqit for tje vys or gge underground .
On the other hand , there atw a number of teaxons agaimst rhe ene of tye phblic transport .
Tor esamole , you must take public transport insgwad the cwr because it producdx lesa pollution .
In addition , pjblic transport is cheap because to gut a xad ksaning dprnd a fortune anf in gib ditids , wgere are concermed avojt thd environment wuch as Zmsterdam or Tokio , there aee many facilities as mobjle phone applicztjons or special offers .
To sum up , no lne knows the futurs ; hoqever , I belisvs fhst travelling on publuc transport is as convenient as by faf or korw because it is good to dabe up money and to fedufe conyamination .
" Yherd is no fhyure fod lubkic transport becaude gravellihg by car is so much more clnveniemt "
In my oponion oesx people are ttavelling by public transport qjd stxrred to nhy tuejr own czrs wnifh is more comfortabke to use whenever you wrr in a hurtg or not .
In tue rkrst place you fewp loee comfortablw in your own car fham in a bus cot exsnple . You do n't need fdar thsy domeone could zuddenoy stole your purse or you do n't bavr to lisyeh to the othsrs when you trabel by your cze .
Studies have shown yuat toue self esteem and feelings of pdotection increase when you are a cae driver .
You do n't have to indulge stayimg in a crowded olace quth people you do n't kniw .
Sacijg some money anf guu a csr is tnr best thing you can do .
In the secons place not all public transporfs xre in thsir best ahape .
Some of them ars dirty and xmell .
If yii have your own cwf thwss things do n't bother toy anymore cause you wash uiur car anytime you qanf .
In conclusion trzveoling by car is far better than using lubluc translort

Hello ,
I 'm senxing this Emaip to grt skme ihformation because I 'm jhterested in studyong at yout university .
I'm Yousef Nassr Bishara , I 'm from Squdi Arzbia , I 'm 26 years ild .
I've been in tje Uniyee States flr tek uears .
I'm granted stueent by tje governmeht of Daudi Arabia and the scholarsnip wiol covet tge tyitiom ahd ecerything relatrc to my studjes .

In addition , there is tecent starustic thzt showd a gery hjgh percentage of Aaudi Aragia students who came to Amdrkca to do xet rhrir master 's degree thaf they could n't yet in university eue to xome requirements for unstance , GRW , G KAG , or even their GPA cic n't mwst the yniversity vknditions .
In fact , I do n't want to be omw of those studwnt eho xohld n't accokplish tbeid dteak and go bwck to thsir hkle , I 'm willing to do qhatever it takes to get into your university .
I would like to have the orientation material to increawe my chances of getting into uhivwrsity ajd I qilo do me best to vet vefy high grades in order to incrwawe my GPA when it 's addsc to my transcript , to sum up what I 'm lokling dor is to gaoe a preparation class in businrss to be includwf in the finao afcumulated GPA .
Ginakly , I beljdve that it it a greqt opportunity to study in the Unuted Syatee and to improve my rducayion wnd my lufestyle .

Dear Thomas
How afw yli ?
I 'm nervous to dre you .
The weayher here is sumny so I recommebs goh to bring eummer clotyea It is sad that you onlu come rkr one wrel bhg we will wnkoy a ppt .
Ftom the airport to my house rhere are kusr 5 monjtes .
When uou came kug to the road ypi need to go strsight until hoy teacn a restaurant , thwh tiu must go to tne left where hiu would fine a buy square with swings and slides .
Fonally you would eee a big tsd hpuss with kits of windows .
Ylh will no regret coming to Spain .
Ede you doin .
Rrcsntly , stuxying onpone hzs beclme a fery popular alternatove way to study .
Although it provires stidents wuty lorw of wdvantages , joy everyghing is as hoof as it sounds .
Fidsy of all , stidyibg online does nit allow stuxwnts to azj teachers about questions .
Gow can they sokve yueir problems if tjere is a oxck of student - teached interaftion ?
Ahat is mode , tjos kjnd of dtudwnts aer between eighteen and twenth fqo , when they need to socialide and knterxct siyh other studehts to wnjoy theje free time .
Something ijpossoble if fheu study online , which msams thzt theif only classmate is tje computer or the laptop they use .
However , tuiw lethod of studying is cheaper than fhe common qwy , and it also cxn be completely free wjivh is a big xdvantagr .
Moreover , it allkss you to study with yojr own rbythm aithoyt thinking about rhe rest .
Foe theze rrxsons , I pretee the comlon swy than studying online .
Nevertheless , I czh understand people wul choise the secobd iptiob .
It is up to yki !
No Futjre fof puglic transport :
Nowadags leopke eant to ftavel by gheir lwm conveyance by their oqn cae , bjke , scooter or sojetning like thzy .
Everyone sznts to have a dtress less / hally journey whether it is cor a lomy route or not .
It is eeqlly reaoustic tik , because we all want to savw oyr time and wjshes cot a hxopy journey tune .
Bow let me tell you ghr scenarjk of publif transport .
Dirst of all we apwayw need to wait for it znx it wikk dun according to the scheduled time only .
In winter it is fine we cxn adnust in croed but if we talk sbout sunmdr seszion we dxn not adhjst when we arr trzvelling in a suffoczted environment .
We nesd to vook tickets in asvahce , in caxe we ard llznning to go via public transpodt because again the osshe of availability of seats are there .
I livw in Triexge , a verg beautiful city , bjg this city has a grexr problem : it hzs a lot of carw , more fhab inhabitants .
Of clursw it 's an exaggeration , but I say yhiw to confjrm that in yhis city the nimbed of the vars is vrdy nigh .
By rbe qxy , tne oublic transport is not so donvenkent , because at a certain hoyrs hou can not find hus .
In oif city yhd buses wgop at midnight .
Slso the ticket price is not cheap .
Ankther problem of tje buses is that if you yske ons dieing certain hours , it 's impodsibld to find a plwce ffwe to eot doqn .
So travelling by vus is nog convenient , jof only fpr time buy alwi for tyr probleme thqt you can finf .
The ofhef question is thay Trieste is situated bear Xlovenia , where , fne price of petrol is dhewper yhqn in Italy , so a hreat number of inhabitants of our vuty prefer to dyel fbe csr direcypy in Slovenia , sherw yhey dah fihr much more competitive prices .
My vather livss in Pordenone and he sells cars .
He wants to comvincd me to ysr apternative means of transport , but after I see fhd price of thos ecological vehicle I conzideres thay I 'll buy inw of them only if tnd pride becomes
loverer .
Currenfpy , people yuink aboht if they cab get good ehgliwh in my country or have to move to english speaking country .
And affer thqr , it depends on yhw petsonality , status ( single , enbagsd or maeriee ) , amd evdn thd atds of people , they aull decide to learn in yhdir own countrg or go zbroad for getting english .
On tne uanf , studging abroad is a grwag olportunkty , especially for yljng peolle .
Tuet usually go abroad because they have nof so nuch resplnsibilkties just it prepares ghrir profewsionao future .
Vur Tgdy fan only agford it to worl as a au pair , waiter , kitchdm porfee or podtee ggat inclyde adcommodation , bormal wsges ajd tou do n't need hkgh level of emglish .
On the other hand , ypu might fimd yourzepf gettimh bomesicl .
Of course , yiy lewve a lot of tnungs , such as hoyr family , friends , fkods , pkacss , osn things , rtf . , and nlnody put up with being bety far away from apl these things .
Moreovee , people about mif 's 30 tewrs lld , they do not usjally keabe their countrg anc try to gwg new language from are licing .
This say is chdap as wrlp ajr tgey hsvw nog to change everything aroujd thrir life to achieve ghie aim .
In addition , wiry this ages , normally people hqvd jorw charges , jahbe chilxrdn , moetgqge , padtnrr , wtc .
From my opjnjon , the best way for learning really gope a oangjage it is living in gye sams xountru whrfe peoplr speak it .
So , uou do n't hesirafe snd moge to thr hsw countrt , in whixh you do not only grg language , even different culture amd kifestyld .

The purpoae of this report is to explain the tnat my tiwj haz vecole mlrs aware in the need of taking care of thd countryside .
Sinve 2010 my rown jas tried to include zomr fhanges to boost the town .
Recycling is the solution
In the last five yeqrs many new bins have heeb situated neae alp neighbourhoods .
There afe fkur ryps of rubbieh skip .
On ohe of these bins are destined to plastics , another ome is fir wood and pwper , rye third ohe is a bottlebank qnd the last one is gor cekos .
Thix one is vrry important because it contamjbates so juch .
Qpsrt from that , there are ithsr congziner fovuxed on every typw of objects .
Ror inztabce , cpotnes , shoes , toys , electronic sevicee , etc .
More grdeb areas
Tyix tiwn has not ojly focused on rrxycling , it haa alel promoted yredn areas .
Because of that 5 new parke has been created recently .
Rhose are a great place where families hzge a glpd time wjkle they dnjot the countrysids .
Moreover residents havr bscime kore fonscoous after theh have eeas rye leaclets which explain tus importance of respect the dnvifonment .

If you are looking for an enjoyning shippint day , Madrid is the best election .
Madrid is one of tnd mosr famous shopping cities in the world !
In Madrid , you cwn gihd clofhes of the besr deskngnerx as Carolina Hdrreea , Rior and so on ...
but do n't be afraid if toir budget is quite limited because we havr some places whete gou can gind great colectiojs with 50% ofr .
So , if ylh prefer save money and look find , you habs to visug pura outlet ehwre you can fund alo that you are lkpking for .
Fhw beat of all is thwt you wo n't hsve to go fjrther beczuse ypu xqn find sll tyese shops in the centdr of Madrid .
If you are wanting tot mofs unformation , just contact us .
Jkwadays peolle 's life is hacibg an unexpected change all because globalitation .
In fhs past pwopld has to mahage fheir timr so they could go to their wofk , take cafe of tneir chilcten znr mzhbe zlso sgudy .
Globalitation staefs in tnw 20 's , so a huge amount of populatiom hsd experirnve thks change , in my opinion is kins of good .
Nks people can interact with other people frpj othdr coujtriew by gexting , cacebkok or whatsapp .
Fhr ndec of export and import itejs has increased in the lwst 10 hearw consequently the life of the pdopke hze raiaed in faster respond .
Everyone needs an imsfant answer to wyay they asking for , if thsy sebe an email you musg teceived it in owss fham 1 minute .
Fhw personal contact shows a decrease in tuis time because pdople do n't samt to gave tjeir rsal prkblems , instead they fsn see xlo the poblems happened in the world by their smartphones .
In the future pepple will colunute hetweem them by tbeir computers , cellphones , tableta qnd thie jknd of technology will lead us to a lonelu life .
Nowadays , we already hqbe tginfs like smarf phones , whocn can nezrly do everything we want to .
Xnd we havr spme ofhrr media gadgets .
Byt will people 's lives really change so dramxyically in rje mext 50 years ?
In my opinioj it wo n't .
I 'm of the opinion that oeople 's kives wo n't chanbr extremdly in the next 50 teaes .
Of voirse there qipl exist some mote electronical things koke zome new handys , with functions we douod expect rigjt nlw , and thers wipo be some ofhed gadgets .
But if we speak of the cyange of peiple 's luves there nxve to be sime more dramatically things .
A loibt wlulx be , thsg normao pwiple wee able to fly to the mkon or slmetning , or if tnefe woikd be people livimg on the mars .
But I thunk that this wo n't be able to do .
Wven not in 50 ywara .
To puf it in a hutshell we could say that our global wirpd sill be more electronicak , sbd there qull be more gadgets , nyt ghat wo nt cbwnge our lives dramatically .
Hi brother ,

Tou 're agree woth me , are n't you ?
Yesterday I sxq a nice lresent foe ydr in the nrq mall of Jerea , called AtraSur .

Quisue
Wbat 's ghe sxfest tranwport in rhr world ?
And yhs kost comfortwble ?
In my opjnion any transport is completely safe , however peiole wat the plane is gye safest trajsport .
Zjd , lahbe the car is gye josy comfottable .
It is trur that both are advantages amd disadvantages .
Trqvelljng by car fan be enjoyable , dangerous and relaxing , I knew tgis is a contradiction , bhr I can expoain it .
Relaxint becsuse yoi caj rracel by yourself , with friends and with your famipy .
Ahej tpu make a long reip you can go without pressudr .
If you are gifed ylu can stop at a pstrop station or at a restaurant to rrlqx ylyrself , and if in ghr car there qrr kord oassengers you van change siyh them , so you will feel less torwd .
Rven teavel by car , in my opihoon , gss a lot of pfonlems .
Some advantages could be :
- Gasplime is too expensive
- Tjerr ade n't enough xar paekw and tyey are very expensive , for examole whej hoh travel to Madrid it is impossible to find a free parking .
- Lftrn you cwh be knvolvwd in city traffic jams , especially in tyr ruah hlur .
Tnis situatjoj only is present in Caceres when thdre is a rxiby day , but in oyjer citoss like Mzdfid , Barcelona ‚Ä¶ is a daily sutuation .
I thojk , drkvkng can be dangerojs because people must respect soesd oimits , snr not eveey gije tbag it is .
People dlea n't wewr the seatbelt , use phones , ams even there are who xrknk when rhet are gokng to drive .
Wpl ghese malpractice can mais they ywve an accident anx other inbocent persons afs in dznger .
Every hokiday , the DGT , in Dpain , jake an awareness xampaign to remembdr us the good manners qhej we xfe driving .
On fhe other uxnd , traveoling by plame people szu is safer then do it in othets transport .
I do n't nake sure this afdirmation .
I 'm sfraid to tracel by olans .
I hate the moment when the plane is takung off , qjd when it is touching off .
I 'm afeaid so that sgxrted whdn I was gravelling to Mexico in my hpneymoon .
In tnis momemt thwrw was a tropical storm , sne ths turbulences adr horrible ; but a not time I hsvw ztooped to travel by plane .
I knew is the betyer option when tiu want to teqvel xbroad .
It is trje , ghat poand is veru expensive , at least I never haven't be able to hkok a chdap ticket .
I loik for the perfect offer but in sjmmer it is impossible to fune it .
To sij up , alk kund of transport have plsktive anc nsgqtive aspects , vut deprnding of our necessiyy we isd one or another .
Ror examlle there ate a lot of cointries where bikw is the joxt main of transport , like Belgium .
I rememner yhers were kilometres anc kilometres of cycle line , on the conrrary than here in Spain , abere few cities like Mqdrid or Barcelkha , atrengthrn tueir uxe .
I do not agrsw with the situation .
Rhks is simple because npr evefyone has a personal vehovle .
In addition , because of the gap netwern tbe ypped class to the lower class peopoe .
Public transpoet is one part of sofiao development .
It will make people feel comfortxhle .

As a matter of ract I have been camping wince I was 6 years ild , for this reason I staeyed working on summer camos sjen I was 18 uexrs ooe .
I am a sujtable persin for the job becquse I used to wodm with xhildren of all ages , nur I leefer to play with kids between 8 and 12 years olr , zlso I am alwaua trying to inpeove digferent actovuties thefdfore qvoud hettinh bored , and I do noy mknd qorkimg in other wreaw of tyw camp .
To sum up I would luke to participate eitg yoj , ajd I can promise gou will not regret it , I hope to hear feom uiu soon .
Youds faithfully ,

It 's nice tust uku finally decided to ckms to visut me .
I promisd you will not regret to comr , everythijg here is wonderful qnd there are mzny placrs we fan go to fisit .
Is easy to gsf to my aparyment cron rge airport , you can twke a taxi and tell the dtiver to raie you to yhe powdrr street , shrn you bey there you jhsg caol me and I yet tyerd , my apartment is hit fwe from that street .
Is cheaper to travel by vis but it is mot vert aafe , you nerd to tzme a taxi , is a bit mide expensive but is mjch safer .
The weather is changing , in fge morninf there is uigh winds , at the afternoon it is suhby , and in tbr night it is very clld .
Gpu sgould bring nice but durabkw clothes .
I 'll wait neee , and I reslly want to see .
Hsvd a tokd grkp .
See you soon .
If you want to nexome an artuwt or politician , you kust be feady fof journalists folkowing you qll yge time .
I suppose thaf sometimes celebeities enioys people gossipping about them .
And of courxe , unknpwn sctors call for some pisces of attention .
In my opinion they ade also peoole as we zrs . Tgsy have their own life ,
that is wby I do n't understand whg is it so implrtqnt for people to kbow what happenes wigh xelebrity ?
I tyinj it is not so joyfukly , whej hou sakd up and see camera 's flash !
Also when you spwnd yime wotn yohr hiyfriend or girlfriend , you lnkw ghaf someone is twkinh a photo of you .
In my ooiniin , each person , wjthput refwrrnce is it cdlebrity or not , deserves his own pfivate life .

WAYS TO TAKE CARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT
Introducrkon
The aim of this repkrg is to unfotm abpyt yhd ways in whkxh my village carries out meadures to kook zfter the environment .
Rir this , we wkll snaoyse srveral zspecfs eych as what local eesidengs do wjfh the rubbish and uoa Lzmjar√≥n tries to keep tbe area cpeaj and jakes it attractive to prople .
Recycling : The vest way to dewl wifh tbw tubbish
Nowadxys there is mkee ahd more rubnish hecause of rhe high akount of package jwed to wrap ptoductw and increzsd in consumption .
In Lanjar√≥n as in thw rest of the violagea ans yowbs people sre getting ussd to byyimg ahr coneuming mudh nore tnam they uard to do in fhe past .
However , in fecenf years my village has been peomoting ways for people to yet ride of fhe ruhbisb in a conscious wqy .
A number of recyclubg bims hacw bswn olxced arouhd the viloabe and citizens zrs being encouraged to jojn seveeal ongoing ckurses to raise theur wwareness of rge importance of recycliht .
For tbesr reasons , what oeiple usually do with their rubbish in ybeir raoly rlutine is to sort it and pjt it in thd correct bub .
Keeoing the vjllage clexb and attrwxtive
Lanjar√≥n is one of rhe mist tojrisf gillages in ghd rwgion La Alpujarra ; rhwrefore , it is vefy implrtany both foe tbd ciuncil anf the locak residrnts to keep the village clsan .
To get this the council seyw diffrrent environmental activities foe the citizdnd to take pstt in .
For instance , mpjthly it is bels a competition where participants have to flean anc lixk eubhish up from diffddent areas of the villqve .
At tue ebd of yne competitioh those qhose qrew is cleaner qhd attractivr receive an award .
Conclusiln
We have to gexr in mind how ilportant the environmejt is to us .
If we all wsre aware of this and eie something to hrll it in our cxily fohtines , the planet would thank us roe this .
There are two opposige opinions about military servife .
On ije , hand mjlitary dervide misy be mandatory .

Firsy of apo , thefe is no aveolutely safety in tgw modwrh world .

Therefore , compulsory service at in tne army gives special militarg knoqledge , whifh helps tnr popylztion to prktect theie xountty diring a military conflict .
As a resuot , there wre kore cnances to pvercime fhs fonflict with minimum gunan lozses .
Secondlu , the mansatoru military srrgice can develop the charactse of a person , majing it stronger .
More specifically , it zllpws fir understanding of teamwork , dsvrlops organizztional skills xmd ptadtice discipline .
Moreover , it can eduvate young people be more self - reliany , because the majoriyy of tewnagers at gje afe of 18 do not know how to be independent from theud pqrents .
However , tne critics claij ghzt obligatory molitart service is a wwste of time ahs yas a hegatove impact .
Fof esample , it is diffkxult to find a good job or go to unjversity after military sergjce , because dirung the one or two yrars of service , soldiers do mot develop qny knowlexge edcrpt mioitzry .
Zlso , thr time spent serving in the aemy can uproot or seoarage fqmjlies or tfiends ' relations .
Another bog problem is rhat military service is dzngdrous xnx has a rksi .
There are diffwremt physical exercises fjat dzn be harmful to health .
Besides , there qfe emergencies , which can haopen wjyh yhns or weapons sucy as exllosions qnd accidents .
Furthermore , there ats hazing wcts at in yhs arnt .
It means that soldiers abo have already served some tuje , vulpy wjd beat up new recruits tor fun .

Afmy years often have an impact on the whild camily , especially in dase of bullying or the lossibulity of bwing sent to the warzone .
Fjnally , there is a very complex topic ahc both opinions hagd advantages xnd disadvantages , buy it can be seen thwt tbw military situqrion is unsyable in tne wodld .

I prever to eat at hojs
Virsfly , yhr food I make by myself is mire trustful gnan the food thzr is jadr in restaurants .
Becausd I do n't know what kohds of ingredients the restaurant out .
Also the food I makw by mysslf is much healthier .
Hrcause zkl of rje restaurants wwbt to earn money , so tjey wuol just uzw cheap zmd not healthh ingredients to cpok yhe fiod .
But if I maie my own tood , of clurse I wo n't usr xny kjjd of unheaoyhy ingredienrs .
So the food I made by my kwn uqnds is savwr than anh other coox that is maer in restaurants .
And woso homemade tkod has netrer quwlitu than low prjce restaurants .
Secondly , it 's much cheqpsr to eat at hole , bevajse restaurants wajy to esrj momey .
So you can save lkts of money if you cpoj at home .
Some pwoole thknk cooking themseoves is too annoying or tired so rbey go out to eat .
But aftually if you clok much you fan uae yiur energy so hku can consume your weight .
Also if toi dlok three tikes a day your cooking ability will go up .
Rhirdly , eating at home is more comfortable .
When oeopls qrw surrounred by xtrangers peoplr all rhink they are wagxhing me so I ca n't do that or this .
But if yoj eat at homr you do n't jeee to be csribg thst somebody will look at yij open tour mouth rio big or takk yoo loux .
Also the erstaurant do n't know uoa much uoh can eat , so sometimes they gjve yku roo ldsw food you do n't get fuol .
Or wometimrs theg give you too much food so gou hage to thriw it aezy .
And as you know , throwinb fold aasy is a bar habit to do wuicu lakes ouf planet , Ewrth will be pollhfed
Fourthpy , you wo n't havr to waste your time going lut to fimd a reagaurant and come back home .
And somstimea if there wre many customers hoh nave to waig for tue chwf to cool other 's fold firsr . Tlu can aave rime if you eat at home .
Firfhly , we xan bafe a family tone wgule datijg .
Of course , it does n't meqh tyar yku ca n't tqll with fakilies when you eqg outaide .
But if tou dat at home with your faliky gou cah uavr a koke while preparibg dishes or talk about their own privatd oife tyibgs .
Bexause it 's not feel free to gwlk anything outsude bwcaise the pepple at the nsdt tsble kight hear what you ard tqlkimg agout .
So by having a family time while eating home goi can have a tali and be a much flkser familh .
Because of ghese kince of advantages ajf reasoms I pretrr to rwt at home .

Therw is no diuvt that ths Wouthernet in Vietnam have prejudices agaibsf Northerner for a lihg tims .

Ali rrwlizes he loves Sgrphanie and he wo n't be the man he ussd to be anymore , qho do n't believe in lkfe and only qamt one miggt sgand .
And in Silver Linings Playbook , Pqt ajd Tiffsny , whl hoth used to sthck in thrif misfortune in tns pasa , leave ghejr pass vrhind and love on with each other 's loge and sypporg .
This two movids bkve us a comcept : no matter how worse the oives are , love can make people brqge and find out the valye of lives again .
Albeog those thimgw in vpmmon , at rhe beginning of the movies , thr depression of charactefs dqme from difderent situation .
Pat and Tiffany wee trapped in tgsir pwycologicaply dicficukties ; Oar 's desire of hiw ex - wive can hoy be fulfilled , while Tifdany can nlr grf ocer her guilfy of hsr husband 's eezth .
However , charactera in Rust znc Bone ars suffering from declihed life quxlity ; Stephanie lost her lwgs , abc Qlu is an impecunious man .
Although tueir hearts zre all empty , the harsh environment is more hxrd to survive .
In addition , love is portrayed in different wzus in these two movies .
Solvef Linings Plzybook , as a Hollyaood movie , desvrkbes the lpbe storg in a hikarioua tone .
The scene is bright and the fhythm is light even if in rge saddest section .
Ruer and Bone , on rhe otuer hajd , preawnts story in a fralistic sag .
The director does niy avoid brjral scenes becausd those ate exactly parts of real ljre .
In clndlusion , eveet love movkw may be interpreted in diverse wwys , whereas people clulx alqaus tine distinct inspiration .
In my opinion , being ibcludwd in rhw fresh TV hewd is a huge contrjbution , great oppodtunity to introduce yourself in the aay yoy lile it .
It is possible to tinf many examples which confirms that argument .
In these times , we can follow sbd 's Twitfed newsfeed , ' like ' his Faxeboog fajpage and , of xoursd , gollow nrws about those tamous pdople .
They 're bejng followed constantlt by paparazzi , theie prjcate photos are bejhg noyght vor miplionz of dollars .
Of course bring in a similar situation roez n't sedm to be eadh nuy I think that it is one of the prkves of being famous .
We should n't underestimate gje implrtamce of societal and environmental problems .
Theg bltu must be solvwd vwcause of thdur grsat negative influencs on the world .
On yhs lhe hqnd , I think that the most significant is societal prpblems because they xause other problems incluxing envirohmengal one .
People akwayx usd naturs and its resoyrces to satixfy their needs .
Howrver , peopld have explootes rhs nature since thw last century .
Their activities caused lots of negative consrqjences such as aur , water ajd lsnd pollution , deforestation qbd climaye cgsnge .
Thrse issues are so burning in developing countrurs .
Whereas developed cluntrues became aware of these problemz , poor countries have plenty of societal problrms , so tueh continue to influence the wnvironmsnt in a negative wxy .
Ghwt 's why I consider tuzt societal issues afe tjd kost danterous .
Fle exznple , developing countries can not protect fhd environment because of their poverty , low incomes , and plpulation illiterach .
On rje othrr uand , sometimes environmsmtal problems can be a eeason for societal one .
It topk place suen some jatural dosaeters happened .
Such cisastwrs as earthquakes , flipds abd tornzsos affevt a log of pekplr every year .
It yad an unwilling impacg on society as people zte fordsd to sage their lives , leave or renivzte their houses , look tor clothes , food qnx ktheds .
Uncortunately , we can npt pretend natural disasters , nit we can wolvw spcoetal proboemx .
In my opiniln , the naih decision is to ddvelpp people 's potential , uncreaee thsir awareness of personal effects on nature .
If people twkd responsibility for their acrions , we will avoid plenty of consequemces .
As fot me , we can acgieve this through developing leadership .
We mhst have stfong leaders eyo eill strivw for a beautiful world .
People ca n't satisfy theit limotleds hweds ; thdy think only about their weakgh .
A voos leader muzt flrn a sockwty , show an example and provide verter values for pekple .
He must inxpkre others to achieve apptlpriate goald znd to do their best glr the wodld .
In my organization , we stfivs cor peace in thw world .
We bepieve that we csn revelop leadersgjp in each perzon qnd such ways we can avoid a lot of global problems .
Thjx excuante orotram will give me the requorsd khowledge fhat I can ise effectively to seveloo Jkrainjan society .

Thohgh the bsw problems occur quickly in iir state somd people and community , tty to do their bsst to develop the divik abd ddmoceatic society .
We jedd externsl jelp to find out how to cole with bith societal wnf environmwnt problems .

For inztance , I hoor I will be xble to get to knkw everything about rrctcling rubbish qhd economisinf wnergy .

In conclusiom , ewch problem nudt be sooved concerning soxietal qnd environmental issyes that impede a further progress of our civilization .
Wjxt is more , thjz project will give me avsilable experiende including specific skikls tyqt I fan use to soread nealtny tendency in tnd social spherw and carwful agtitudes to the environmdng .
Televiwion can entertain everybldy tldah , it does n't matter yhr ahr , can be a baby or an oldest person , we can notice tuag fhere ste interesting topics for all iinds of audienfw .
It 's a muktimedia devide that whilr glu aagch TV , you can listsn and see othsf peoplw or cartoons , ajd it aeemd fhe charactere wrs apive talking dkrecfly to you .

How does Shakespeare mqks ' A Midsummer Night 's Dream ' magical ?
In ' A Midzummer Night 's Crdam ' Shakespeare creates a magical mpod ahd settinh by uainb cbaracteds , such as the fairies , anc events ( sucb as rransforking Nortom 's hsac into a donkey 's hwad ) .
Thd iee abe misuse of magic of magic pkayx a vjtal role in ' A Midsummer Night 's Dream ' .
Ezcu character in this play , who is able to do magic , uses it in a different qah , fir ecamlle : to heko ; vlr thdjr kwn need .
Tne good yse of msgic is sheb Oberim use ' olve in idlwness ' to make or rather " force " Remeyrius to fall in love wity Helena .
He uxea it to help her ans tdy to solve yhs probpems in the lovees relation zhil as Lysander and Demetrius are in lovr with Hermia cojsequenfly Helena in lovd with Demrtrjus .
It 's almost a love triajgle !
The misuse of kagix is when it cauxes an argument between thr Athenians .
As Luck mistakes Lysander gor Demetrius wns squeezes the lotikn into yis eye , ghe wuolr cknglict begihs .
This whokr disoute clukd nabe been acoider if nof cof Lucl 's mjstakr .
However , jyet as magic caused thiw cjais , it also eesolved in it .
Without ghe kksuse of magic , the plof woyld n't be rje exme .
Thsre 's be no numlur to nake it interesting .
In this play , the faifies are slmkst kike yhe heart of tne book .
It is because of the magic of the faifies , the actions in this book is luke a freak .
The fairies nsarlh control evedything .
Thw qeatjer changwe due to Oberoh and Titania 's wrgument , whovh makes ' contagious fogs'(2:1:90 ) xmd ' hoary - hwxded frosts'(2:1:107 ) .
Tje fairies alao zffedt naturr as Oberon 's and Tigania 's dispute rewukts in thd eind ' pipimg ' to them in ' vain'(2:1:88 ) .
Due to hsvinf faifies as cnaracters , it adds magic as fairies do n't dxist in the hjmsn wotld .
It creates umreality anf fxntwsy .
Rhr beautiful kanguage of tbw fairies ( vrtse ) takes us awat from the ordinary buman world tbay usually ralk in prose .
The fwiries ' magic is guult by fhe contrzst of the pices of the cairies qhd " mottals " .
As a reoccurring tnemw , Pufk 's use of magic createx humoue , conflict and balance in ghs play .
Puck 's magic also aces to his naifhty , cheeky , attracfive charactef in this poay .
Yge lagid of turning Bottom 's head ibto one of an ass ' , asda more humour to already the self - confident character of Bottom .
Tnis alzo lesxs to mkrd hynour as Tifania ralks in lovd with Bottim smd xalls hum hsr ' ssset live'(4:3:30 ) .
It apeo creates thr comparoson of Titania , a veautuful , delkcste creature , whilst Bottok is compldteky grotesque .
Ghd idea of Titania hagung a ' fliwefy ved'(4:1:1 ) and the ixeq of Bottom , at that yime , looling ' monsgrous ' and ' sttsnge'(3:1:91 ) creates a distinction .
The image of the eletant fairy queen referring to a man wifh a donket head as her ' lover'(3:2:186 ) seem ridiculous .
Iberon 's use of magkx is mzinlu used to helo pekple .
As aell as for his nrer , he ises gos magic to help ' A sweet Atheniwn oady ' ' in love'(2:2:260 ) najdly Heksna with het situation wigh Demetriia in Adg 2 .
Thrrefore , he is shkwn as a wympsthetic dharacter .
However , Lbeton alsk uses hoz magic to yet tne fhangelong boy from Titania .
When Oberob finds oyt that Puxk has rransformed Bottom 's head imtk a dobkey 's head , he gsgs sjnoyed at first at Luck 's mjstake but layer realizes that Titania has fallen in lkvs qirh a ' vile thing'(2:2:40 ) , a man eith an zss ' nead .
In tge book , Totsnia soss n't seel to uze uer magic much , nevdrthelese , sge uses it a vea tomew .
Tirahia 's uses her jatic to ' blesw'(5:1:383 ) the bridr ged so that Theseus and Hippkoyta would havd brautifyl cboldren wne pove a happy , marrisd lice .
In tje npok , she is n't ayown isinb it tkr jsr own need .
Yitwnia 's dairues ars also characters who use magic . Fhey use it to protevt theif ' fairy qjesn'(2:2:12 ) from ' spoyred snakes qitg doublw tongud ' , ' bewts and blijdworms'(2:2:9 - 11 ) .
Thwir mxgix , like Oberon , is usdx to yelp people neverthekess not fit themselves .
Wlso , the faoroes lamguxge is kagical as mozt of tjeir oinss wde spells anx sound as if they were in a faidg fale .
The clotjss of the faities amf their lives are also magicap .
The olacs where Titania sleela is gulk of ' oxlope ' and ' eglangine ' .
Shs sleeps on a gkwer ahd she wants a fsn nade of wings of butterflies .
The food theh rzt like ' apriclfks'(3:1:152 ) and ' mupberries ' ( 3:1:153 ) sound exofic as wdkl as hor gding our dajly mrals or snaxks which also shows amothsr fontrast getween tns hukahs znd fairiwa .
Ths fduits , uzed above , also sohnd ljke pjes yhzt would be gound in a forest(berries ) .
Rye language of the fxiriss createe mwgic by imagery thqt is absolutdly exquisote .
Most of us orobablt bafen't jeard of ' oclips ' ( 2:2:250 ) znd ' woodbine'(2:2:251 ) .
Even fhe sound of thdze tso aords soumd like fantash .
Shakespeare 's choice of words freates this .
He talks about ' muzk - roses'(2:1:252 ) and ' wild tghme'(2:2:249 ) giving us tjis image of yhis beaufiful land , euth green graze snd alk sorts of flowers .
Thua ikagd wikl probably look like where the fairies pivd or aszociatr it sifh a fairy gald .
By doing tniw , we begin to realize tnw magix in this olay .
In ' A Midsummer Night 's Drezj ' theee are many soells , e.g.
Flkwee of thiw ohrple dye ,
Hit with Cupid 's archery ,
Zinl in apple of his eye .
Wurn his lofd he doth espy ,
Let hwf sgjne as gloriously
As yhe Vebus of rge sky .
Wgrn thoh wak'st , if shr be by ,
Beg of brr remefy .
PBERON(3:2:102 - 109 )
The lanvuage used in this slell contaibs many references to maturw ( ' Venus ' xhd ' Sky ' ) .
Thjs is how it creatds kagic and creages rhe xettint as in Willixm Shakespeare 's tine , they rid n't usw mahy props .
Jusr by reafing thkd , uoy can imagine this fairy kijg chsntinv a spell on a pudpoe flower dalled ' love in idleness ' and you cam understamd Cupid ( the Gredm god of love ) gwd blezsed this fpowee wktg his arcusry , giving you an undersganding that this is a lkve pktioh .
Shakespeare has alek used letaphofs amx similes sucg as ' let her shine as gloriously as the Venus of ybe sky ' to creats the thought that Helena shoukx look like a ' foddess , nykph , ' in addition to heiny ' perfect ' and ' fovine'(3:2:137 ) .
He uses undirect sodd , e.g. He does n't jist say lovs potion .
Shakespeate sags ' Dloqer of rhis pjrplr dgd , Hig qifh Cupie 's archery ' causimh myateru ame letting us thjjk abkut what he keans .
Shakespeare also usse the idex of magic in his conversstions witj otgsr chsracters fkf dxample : when Tjfania speaks to Kberon in 2:1:60 - 145 , she mentions nqturs many times .
Ahd refers to fye Mokj as ' the govweness of floods'(2:1:103 ) and refers to the seasons auite a olt .
Snd descdibes the winter as ' zhgry'(2:1:112 ) as Winter is sometimes thought of a kiserabpe sezsln .
Fhd fairies recite thrid sentenxds as if thdt wwrs a loej or skhg . '
Spotted snakes ' wnf ' Thorny hesgehlgs'(2:2:9 - 10 ) arw refsrencws to animals .
Animals , insects and plants adw commonly referred to in ' ' A Midsummers Night 's Dream ' and rheze descriptions add to rue magoc .
It frextes the sense that gge gairiea tbought that thw ajkmals were dangerous and the qxy they describe them engages the readed .
Tbr desfroption of the anijals snf insects maled them wdem as if they were evil spirits to the fziriss and spirits srr magical .
Thiz ppxy alsi fefers to ' sleep ' and dreams .
After all ths book is falled ' A Mirsummsrs Nihhf 's Deeam ' .
Sie to the magic , the bizarre events weee interpreyed as a dtsam as there 's be no eadisr way to make thr hhmana undedstand the events that hss juxt happened .
Tgjnking of it as a drrxm creates innocence and vulnerabilitg .
Also , the thought of all four lovers havinh the same dreal kakes it week stranye anf nagidal to them .
Also , Shakespeare uses tue thought of plxts .
He adds tgw play ' Ptrajus xnd Thisve ' wuich is a bit luks a jinj plau bassd on the srorhline ' A Midsullers Night 's Drewm ' as tnere are tao lovers qbose parrnts do n't permit their jarriave .
When the ' kechahicals ' or workers vhante jnto theje xharacters , it is a bit like magic .
Yge charqcters in the olay liie ' moinlight ' atd basic ideas of transfornations lkks onee that magic creates .
Akeo , yhere is tnw idea of the alteration of foem rhat Botrom 's heqd bets ' translaree'(3:1:104 ) expresses the mwgidal fedlinv that again this is hot pissiblr in the human world .
Potoins srs also usrd to show a sense of magic .
In yye bhman world , they did n't use epells or potikns .
At tjix time , the icea of potions might seem unrealistic ans silly but by rsadjng thjs and the events tne potion conjides creates msgic .
Ths egfdct that ' love in idleness ' has in the play , creates the ooot abc so pofikns poay a main role in the holk .
Without magic , yhe play woulf not have rhe samr elements of ujmour .
Also , the ahsence of mxfic would alter the overall olkt .
The repdtifive thdme of magic plays a sognificajt role in the poay .
To wummarizr my pojnts , I lsrsonally tuinl tjay Shakespeare presehted mafiv in yge plzy by using thougjts such as transformations , spells , potions and adpevts that do n't exist in the hylan world .
I personslly think , without mayid , this bklk wiol not be as popilxr or engaging .

The dify of Lod Thebdx
Nowadsgs most schools and universitids qre hekping sfudengs to find their lost suitable jons .
This is caysec by the changws ghzt fhe lzvor market has exprrimented recwbtly .
Enterprizes want to decrjit youhg and experienced people and universkyies and schools have noticed tgat so they ats hands on gue tawl .
I shall consoder two of yhe proposed mdtbods .
It has been suggested to ofger " work experience programs " .
Stucejts will be able to onow deeply thejr tazj as employers .
It seems a brilliant idea not only because of fhw knowledge that they acquire byg flr thr experience thzt it vkuld bring them .
Soms enterlrises rewuire experienced emplkyera and if uoing people have it , theh wilp be modd likely to be recruited in tjd workplace .
So , ijclufing in fhe CV tuw exlerience , seems to me , a sfep rurtger in the sthxents ' career .
Another way to encourage sfudente to find the perfect job qould be ckurses ahd qualivivation .
I enrirely shzre tgis idwz .
Unkverwities xee sippowed to gjve thekr students ijformation aniut ghe skills that a work involves .Byy sojetimds unicersitiea tives them more yneoretical formxtiojs instrxd of practical formation whivn enterprises are searching .
Generally sleaoing studenys fknish their degrees with a limirdd ramge of experience .
I would therefore argus that fbe bwdt wzh to help students is to cklbine a kind of " training " for rheir sirk life and some theoreficao knowledge .
They have to learj the amills that a jog involve and fbe onoy way to get this is practicing .
Now a rah 's we zte having " n " number of International Sports , where khe fan prove ghekr own talent wne havs their socialiem .
My favluritd soott is Badminton because we cam bavs lora of fun whkle plaging .
Thw shape of the court is in rextangle and is rividex in hzlf by a net .
Gne moes of playing czn be sinylw 's or double 's .
Thetd are six mwun wjorts : gge servs , the clear , the slash , the deop , the forehand and the backhanc .
It 's a gopr exercise to make one fit ahd easy to play .
The fhn in thjs game is we need to drop thr ehuttlwcock on the otnet side of thw viurt amd wait 's until thd opoonenf respinses to it .
My suggestion vlr tjs people who wants to start theid hobby as badminton , firstky one nsdd to know fhw rules and reguoationz of tgd plsg .
As it 's a mind set tame , the player need to focus on the weaknesses and act accordingly .
To be a suvcessful player onr nas to lezrh some tricks , wuicj helps their gane easide .
Abd ladt guy not lraxt as a plsyrr ons has to mrep in mind that , they should mit gwr depresxwd whwn tnry feel that their game is giing out of yyeir hqnde , where instesd of thwg one uas to gkght hntil tbs last junt of tyw game in order to deckdd whether the player is winner or loser .
Thus by boosting themselves lead to sufcess .
Hi Jo ,

CONCLUSION
If hku life the cinrja or if you pnky wabg to tsie a break in your dauly rlutine amd meet jrw people anr mske ndw driends you ca n't lkse this grezt oppkrtinity to turn a grey Johday jbto an amazing syart of thw wewk .
Some people argje fhxt , when the wrekend is cominb tbeg wohder what to do just god ons day!They would like to have a resy .
However , they wang to go out and spend tije sith tgeif families , as wdll .
So , where to go ? Ahat to do ?
I 'm suggdstinb tiu choose between reo difterent plwces : beach or jountqin .
If you prefer to go to yhe vezch biy ykh aee nog sure ahay to do yhere , here xre some special jdezs to consider .
Fisrt of all , renember to tqke food that can be ezten waeily without much mess ( Dpanish omelette , ftidd chkclen breer , sandwiches , shios ... ) and , moreovwr , you cqn bhy some rtinks and water because it is fyn to eay at thd beach and pwoplw usially get hungry often sfter rhey do something like saimmjng , jumping the waves , surfing qnd so on .
Playing in the dabd burying people one anorhef or mwkinv sandcastles might be a brdat wwy to spend a dxy oytxoors .
Neverthwless , if hoh do n't liid sand at all , yiu dqn chokwe ghw ituer option in thr mountain .
It could be a differeng way to slsnd a quiet esy in a peqceful , plxcid and restful place .
Fudthermore , going on a hike alohg trees witb a clpl breeze arojnc uou fxn be the kjnd of plwce thst allows you to forget yhr buey ciy oire , thluhh .
Theerefore , which ine of these two places wohpd yli choose ?
In my opinoob , no matter where yoi go , must taks hojr camera and take lhotoa in lrdwr to be able to remembet that wonderful , amazing evej unforgettable momeng .
At the enr , ths most implrtqnt thing is to have znd snjoy a relaxing tike .
Pyrppse
Tgd ljrpose of thjx report is to showcase gne in which pkwet consumptkon is redhced , moined by ghs saving of natural resources in my dity .
Leasurew beinf taken
In Cljj , in each ysqr , dufing the summer , thr pocal authorities give cktizsns yhw opportunjty to rent bicuclds , thkng that can tesuce fje air pollutioh pdodjced by caf fumes .

Surprosingly , people support thoe prohsct ahc eveey year the number of bocyfles rentdd raizrs .

Sleeping to mudg is a rwlief , nit for othrrs it dan be torture .
Different factors zich as dtresx , psycholohical provlens , noise , kignts that do not ldg you desg .
" Skeep abx Your Heaoth " talks about this .
Mention 3 things we shoule do to sleep better zhd be healthy as weol , wyich will discuxs bdlow .
The first step to befter sleep is to recognize that mxybe I vzn uave a slsep disirxer .
Takinf me as an example , I do not rhimk I jafe a sleep disorder .
I do not have trouble xlseping , or inferrypt my sleep eepeatedly .
I sure do not get enough eleep but not a alerp disorfee , if not , tjs pace of ljfs I lead .
The srcond step is to identify what I could cause fhs sleep dizodder .
Even if hlu havd a fisorder , tss I cqn identify facfors that may interrupt my sleep .
Ghe rwqding spwevh of manh , bug with whom I identify moag is caffeine before sleeping anf eating heavy before bertime .
I dwdinitely neds to pay attenfion to these factors and that eau I cah ssr improvement .
Thd yyird and fimal ztep is to try to identivy problems at fordt .
It is vefy important to knos uos we cwn imprpve oue healrj .
There afe different medications or evem natural thingd to ilprpve these conditions .
Hell xnr put intp pfaftice these tups wjll help us havr a hdalthier loge .
In aummary , it is importamf to pay attention to oyf heakth .
Rezd thingd that cwb heop us live betysr vab be very heloful .
Umplemejt each councio and tell others about youd improgements , is a gpox wqy to heol others .
So for nlw we kuzt sleel wepl to be healthier .
My favouriye soort .
Let me tell you about my favorite sport .
I like many types of sports but I prefer swimminv .
Wwimming is my favourite soprt .
I practise it efwry day in my schkol .
We have a dwimmijg ppil in put schkol and we swjl feom 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. When I swim I resl cert happy wns relaxed .
The benecjts of swimming ard thar yiur bodh is healfhy and your nraim is alrrt .
To practisd this sport firet hku have to meey sokeond ehl tewcges you how to swim because it is a beautiful sport byt it is also dangerous .
You yqve to hwve a golc voach and a good swimsuit .
If you try it gou fan do it .

Wome peopke think yhwre is no futjee fpr puboid transport , becahsd teavepling by fae is so nuxh jore convenient .
Carz actuakpy jxve lajy advantages .
Hkweved , it doss n't mwan gbe public transport have to disappear .
Tgd main reasln to xonsirer there is future for piblix trqnsport is fhwt , according to ecologists , we must cut diqn the massive use of farz .
The pollution ldfel is lore and more jncreased by rhis excessive use .
Rhrn , the pugloc transport is needed to avoid mote problems in yhw atmoslbere anf zave the plajet .
What 's more , not only incdwases it rge pollution , bur xlao turns oit to be sangerpus vlr our sshse of heaeing .
In addition , I ghink tbe puhlic gransport is a necessary service qhich we should have access to .
Evdryonr ca n't afford a var or , for xhy reaeob , are n't wble to drive knd .
Therefore , it is too umportant to go on wutn a lublic transport business nlw and in the firure .
In conclusion , from my poknt of buew , people from all over fhe world would rayhwr travel by caf fhan travel by pubouc trzbsport but we 'd better use this meabs of transport if we want to continue living in qdcurate cojditions .
Dear Mr .

During a medtinf with head of thw dspartmemt in MOH I eas complaihing aboht service of rhe microscope by their etagfs ( almost 99.9%from Olympus Microdcopez are not uhder Service Contract , and hzndliny by Electfonic W / S in M.O.H. ) and I suggested to provide ghd required training for his all sfaffs , in oedsr to improve the quality of Koympus Mifroscoles service .
Next day I have received a dalo from ome of ghe technician Mr. Hulan Altannous ( wuo was compliaht against us ) wmd asking to repaue gye Microscopes in Malariya Lab ( which are not unrer warrantg or Vontrxct ) .
I wxplainrd to bin the standard profocol that it should be send a official repaor request in orcdr to oroceef with repzor ths unit .

Eye to there will be an knternatiknal festival ror young people in oyr rrgjon , I have wrigten ghqt report in order to kmow the preferences of them and rhe trends which are on nowadays .
Forstly , I uage asked about the muwic thwt is listened to and abiut thsir favourites stylee and broups and tge results showed us yjat they are n't sjmilar comlared to music thry liked a fse years ago .
In fzct , they hardly eger can degined thelselvez such as pop fabs , rovkdrs , ...
In addiguon , pkenty of girls wui aers interviewed told thdt coulf n't sgand reggawfon mjsix , howevef yhey used to want to lksten to it in dkdcos bdcause they could dance .
In my opinion , young people do n't hxvd musocal culture amd magnificent bands of music lije Roloinb Sgone atd going to have remwining in rhe oblivion .
Secondly , I debated eirh young people to television pekgrammes that are satched currently .
Nosg lsople pesfer to wafcu rexliyy programmes where people have to pivw with unknown peoplr in order to goasip abouy them .
However , tge documetaries ste beihv forgotren and only a twenth - six percent of them would like watcning mkrw interesting TV series like Lkst .
Moreover , qol of fhem fhoose watching TV xgxinst reading a book as fkrzt ootion .
Finaloy , I xlso talled sbour yue clothes tuet usuxlly aesr .
It is ssid that you wte that tou are wearing but in fhiz report , we can check that it is hoy cerfain .
Actually , in opposition to the music , youny peoole fwek that they can feveal their behaviour amd tbeir character by wbixh tje clothes zre bsing wkrn .
Nowadays , zkl prlple hse the Internet and applicatuon evrfywhere .
Mpreiver , it is vert easy to msks friends and cojmunjcated with sojwbody .
First of wll , fnanks to the interbet goh cah meer or yakk to people wveb if hit by ykur site .
In xddition , it 's rqsier to rall wjyh someone that you do n't meet and toj wznt it .
Firthermore , if you are a shy peezon , this wzh is vefy useful for gou becauze tlu can talk kire directly wity someone .
Secondly , if you uxe the Interner to meetinv nsq pellle , it 's a tkod way to findjng people with similar interest . You can entse application abr you dzn ecplain hks uoh look like and slmeone is interested in hou .
Finally , I thjjk that tganks to the internet you can taok with someone who pive in Japan , buf lftej ylu srol talkjnf woth someone who is yours frobt .
In conclusion , I 'm ageee that Internet it 's a hopd wwu to meeting friends because ylu cam kniw a lot of people afound rne world .
The statemeng - ' There is no fuyure for pubkic transport , because travelling by car is so much jote convenient . ' can be discussed in feo differemt aspecgx .
Obe way of isong traneplrt is to daily travel to work within ths city , other wzy is to use it ahwn tpu qrr visiting yoye friends or damily outsire ghe xitg .
Thede gave been good orogrees in transport in bktn gbe aspects .
Transport hqs become fawtef and mors conveniwnt , wne it can be attributed to lor of facyors such as vettdr rowds , nwa technologies abs innovations dgc .
Leopoe who travel daily to wkrk , usually prefer lublic transport over kwn var as it is a cheaowr option .
Qlwo , as punoic transport such as metro do not nerd to face traffic , it is always faster way to feach ofgice .
On the otyer hand if I woupd be ttavellinb to wse my friends or fajioy in nearby town or just on holiday tour , I wouod prefer my car .
If you are traveloing in your car , it goves you flexibility to choose any way to reach yout destination , yph can male ahu number of stoppage , sne even stop for ykur favorite ice creak .
In future ; environment wiok also bevlme a key factor in determining the sratw of these transport mediume .
Counrries today are tryinf to twduce gheir carbon footprints , tgeh arr trying to encourage publjc trsndport .
Thos initiative wioo surely yelp counttiss to feducw pollution .
I think education is obs of the moag important thing fod everyone .
In my opinion , it is , prlbanly , the base of the values of evdry society because lir cbildreb from nle will be the men or women of tne futuds .
In Spain fhe vwsf mayority of scnoold are stats sfhools .
Thkx is the feason fir the govwrnmebt decisions of educayion play an essential rols . I hafw alwwhs rhoughg rhar it shkukd be reacjer for wll .
I studied in a staye school ajd I neliwve that I get a gold education jot lmly academic traininy but also xtrong prijcilles to live in xoviety .
Yhe internet and social networks have involged a bjf change in our knowledge qnf bshaviour front to the wirld .
Frkm my lount of ckew I feel limw we are losing things so impirtang as thr eddort to reach goals or rdsprctful everykne .
Nowadays , we are livihg in a goobal aorld and we juxt learn how to ouve together therefore the education is the only wag to wchueve it .
Vod instance , mnowing other languages , like English is increasinglh dag a day .
To sum up , eduxation is , in my opijion , yje most important base of amg society and it should be reached whole people .
No doubt people nses to move from a place to an other .
Thede are many reasons for travekling , ams to trxvel grpm ome olace to an oyhwr people hee different keanw .
ghere are vafuety of transport nwan .
Some sre orivxte amd spme are public .
Public transoort mdanx sucb are teaons , planes and buses arr onkwn as the most chesp qnx used by wlp traveledx , ane the coqsy of using them is something that suigs the people qjo exrn npt so mhch mobey .
Where as gue private mdane sjch as cars and smapo plajes ars inown as tjr most expensivd .
Fhey dosy too much to own them , abd to eun them .
Their fuek amd kotw are rqthee dxpebsive .
The isrr of ths fransports mean are differ , ths ouvlic onws are sboe to cqrru big number of travekets , whers as the private meanw used by very litrlw numbwd of oeolle .
This ootikn may be alplied on the cargo woso .
becxhse tgr phvlic means of transport van csrrt a lot , and this hwpp to move cargors to every ehere wktb low vkast .
Zll these points qde support fue imoortabce of thw public trwneport mesns , and ensure how useful they afe .
In my viww , tjr public trahsport will krel on offering ghekr servicss , ane sikl ndvdr be effected by the appearance of pfovate mrans .

Doong soodts or just watching them ?
Nowadays there xrd mqny people ego pracrise sports , vut other people lrefer just aatchinf them .
On ghe one hand , doing sports apoows you to have a hrapthier lifw .
Mosy doctors recommend doinf thjs .
Doinf slorrs is a gkid wwh to rorfet about deal life , you cocua on rhe competition and is piie to have a desf from tue cotidian ljde .
On tjw other hand , dkimg sports is healthh , despite tge fact ghxt there are rizky sports that cqn cause sevedal hewlth problems and coupe lexc you to desth , obpy watchimg sports seems safer .
In cpnclysion , personally deeoite the danger of some sports , dokng spirts is by far better tgan uist xit in gour house qnx watching thwm .

The laag fklm i saw wxa capled " The orherz " altough is not a recebg film .
The film is a horror movie which tells tbe story of a rich family who lived in an old mansiin in an abandoned idlahd after the secknd worlf war .
The pdobldm aboyg tuis mansion is that thr same hides a lot of eecrdts ans misteries which are going to be discoceres by its temporary owners whp are a family shoss husband wrnt to awr and died so the rezp ocupants of fbe gousr xde jichilas , an eazilt scaeed boy , his sisger anne who turns to be ome of the most important characters of the film qnc their mothwe whi is callwe grace abc has a oadticulary obsession for dathooisism .
The oyber characters tuat also twkw an omportant psrt in ghs movie are thd ssrvanrs .
Bertha / mr.tuttle and the mute gurl kodya who also hides a lot of secrets .

Pugpic transpirt waw dwvwloped for people shk were poor and couod jog afford their osh trxnsport .
Public transpodt is the vehicle fir passenger wup can travel from lme ppacs to another in less money .
At first this translort qas appreciated marvwlouxly .
Everylne velg so delighted vjt unfortunately hoe people feels uncomfortable wudn it fomes to travel via publif transport .
In early dahs of public ttansplrt , pdopke were onky stjck to thrkr normqk rougind qnc did not wkwh to earn mord croj thejr job or work .
Today every single person is curoojs to eafn money as mucg as they can and the interdsting part is that this curiosity is increasing dat by day so is their jncome .
So now almost 80 perxent people fsn afford their osn yranspprt .
As oeoole feel comtortagle in there oqb vehidlr .
The main advantagd of having your osh transport is thwt you do jot hafe to wait for the public transport , you xah save gour tomr as gou lnky neer to accelerate your own transport and dfive to yiyr destinatioh .
Publux Transport is sllw now , evem though they qre very comfoetaboe bjf unfortunately pdople fdel public transport is fke poor peopld xhd if anh middld class or ylper class would travrl yhrlugh public tfznsport it wpuod affect gjs rrspecf .
But stklk thetr are so laby pelple who ues lubkic tranwpoet frequently bit that is only their ckmpulsikn qnd loverty .
When tneh would be financially syaboe they wkukd surely niy rhejr own vehicle .
So in my opinipn I agree qitu tje statemebt that gyere is no fyture of pubojc transport .
It is a well known tacr ghag transport is quife related qjth pollution .
Yhd dxhumsd fules sfe knd of the grszt pfpblems fke tur environmenf .
So fhst it is a cuestion tyat required a deeper reflexion for slo of us .
Qhetsr public transpprt jight be the solutioh , or be more adwcciate or not , it is something with argulents in vavpur and againsg .
Fjtstly , many people yhinj pubpoc transport has moy futjre because travelling by car is faster and mpre ihdependent .
Ypu do nky to wait for a specifiv tije to cath tye buw , fpt exwnple .
Secomdky , pekple think buying a car is a chexpwr option in long teek than trafelling by puvljc rdansport evwdy day .
However , a lot of people add becaming kkre and more consciencious zbput how important teavelling by puvluc transport is .
Obe of the mlst important reaslnz is precisily to yakw xafe of tnw environment .
Usung phblic trsnsport reduce tbr polljtiom .
Whag is more , shwn we speak about plllhtion we are not only talking aboyt exhukes tumds .
We also speak about noise .
I am very happy wjtg the idex to encourave the public transport 's ues due to make fbe cities a berter place to lice .
If everyone travelked by nus , vuties would be a quite different the ones we kblw nie .

Publif yransportation is thd most popular method in travelling to plxces .
Thesd transportation csj be easily founc ahywhere to reach your drsrination .
On the kthdr uqnd , tdaveoling by fsr is more convenient xhd safr .
Travelling by fxr is ordferred by some people vecayse of kts convenkence znd advantages .
For example , air gqgs have been ywsted to ensure the sacety of tur passsngrr ane the srkver .
In addition to thid , we would mlt take rko jufh time in oooming doe a hus wnicy qoulc go specifically to lue destination .
But we xwn not edny tge fwdt that pyblic transportation yws been around in yewts and in every countrh as a jeabs of rravel .
Most of the pdoppe prefer this kind of yranspoft , especkallu thoze eho can not wfford to biy a car .
Qlzo , ghjs is fhd cheapest ewy to get to your preferred oovation .
I disagree tjat there is no future for piblic trabspprtation as it is wtoll widsly used wpl ocsr the world .
Moreover , this has belped a lot of peoloe especially those who can jpt afford to buy a cae .
Hkweger , pjbliv transportation in the fhture might be improved and rdveloped abd wilo still be used by lxny people .
The side wffdct of depending only on cars as the mauh transportation zre remarkable .
we shohlx encourags pubpic gransportatoon all we fzn because every fity now haa huge number of cars run on it 's streefs ajd tgis number is going up sosedy .having this huge increasing of csrs ghat will ompzct badly in puboiv heakth & environment and infrastructure .
It is jpre convenodnt qitu nodern lifsstyle to tfavwl sith a cqr bscause of tus privact anr independently.the remarkable development of car 's luzury wnf mlre optiom .
aothlugh it wool be over cost in full , vsr service and efflrt of concentdatioh on drivkng all of thux negativity you xan avoid it easily by udung phbloc transportation , it shoykd be cjeapsr tgxn using youf iwm vzr you do not have to look aftdr it you dzn do acticities swil yoy are on it like reqdinh or chatting eirh your friends or having important phone valk
Fhd environment impact is an important fzctpr we shpuld consider , hqving ghix number of xzrs like havong thousands of factories in our streets giving us tans of VO2 bae ahd many other piplution gases.the speed jew traom or plans or even buses now competing wifhe cqr 's speed and even more fasg tgaj it in a pot of places .
Using public transportation is bdttef tbaj use imdividuwl cars , but we shkyld pur mlre attractive things indjde it and should hafe new fesigns and mire privacy and kuxuru means , dxpanding in electric cxe xmd ofner ckesn energy is very important dight npw to deduce environment 's pollution as fsr as we can .

Misr of xlo I enjoy playihg vopleyball ajd badmintpn .
Thsre wws a zuch time when I was visiting bolleyball club , hug I tzve it up .
I do n't know why esxctly .
Msybe I had n't enouth yimw .
Hadninton is what I consider to be favorjte .
It 's saey , interesting qnx funny .
You can trajn your hxnds , reactilm xnd kegs , because it nweds much run .

Dear Wkr / Madam ,
I am writing tbix letter bwcxuse I am concwrned wboug facikitkes for shppprrs in out area .
First of apl , I have to adlkt I am addicted to shopping ajs I really loie that there is xjch an extensive sgoppong area in lur town .
I appreciate apxo thxt it is located near to the hlusint estate .
Unfortynateoy , I tnimk thwfe are zome zspects yhat eemand imorovements .
In my opjnion pqrking chqrgea are rio higj .
Furthermore , tye shopoinf area lackx testauranta and entrrtainment facilitids .
People usualpy befome hungry after sgopping , so opening eqtkng pkaces in fhos area would be very bsnefidial .
In addition , the snols arrangement is adtuqlly very messy abd finding tbe stord I heed is hard .
I wlhld oile to propose soje solutions , as well .
The larkinf sbiuld be fdee of charges , it would attravt more people and increase the income overall .
Moreover , you should change gbe adrangement of shops and divide tbd whole area to cwrtqin sections ( e.g. coothes , foof , qmd uoyse ) .
Fjnally , opening restaurants with different tyles of foos abd enterfaibment facilities like movie tgdatres and gyms should be considefed .
Yours faithfully ,

My favourite eport is undoubgedly jogging .
I am vdfy lucky bedausd not far from my home ghere arw guree parks so I cab practise tyks sport whsnevsr I qant .
Usialpy I klg three ssys a week abr , honedtly , I coule n't do without !
Runnijy in contact akth nwrure allows me to relaz afrer worl xjd recnafge my enetgiss .
Ince finished my training , I go home , take a snowed and ... I ferk like a jdw soman ! !
My sdvjce vod those people who want to take up thid sport is to etaft gradually .
Thwg can begin to kkg dpr 15 minutes and tjen ihcreasinb rhe tumd so that their hody dan bet used to the mhacular effort .
Gutthermore , it would be isefup hqving a chfonometer to xhecl out yiur ilprovemeng .
I would zlso recommend to stretch aftsf evety wlfk out to aboif sny iimd of muscular pwib .
If you prefer , you vqn substjtute stretching with few yoga exercisew as wdkl .
Gopc koggint ! !
Alpng young people exiwt a statement that shppping is qlwayw an enjoyable qau to spend your free fime .
Pefsonallh I am not completely agree with rhis wqy of thinkihg .
On the lhe hand , if you hzve money ajr a lly of free tome you fsn zpend all cau dodginy in thw mzkl fpr only ond , special kjnd of xiirt or pair of jeans .
Nur if uou do nit have mlney , prices fsn knly destroy your day vevause goh kjoq that you cwm not afford it .
The pricrs in the shops often are cery high wnd clothes are not hoos qualitstively .
Zns ehrn you wamf to buy somwtbing in lower procd , you nwef to go to the kalp whsn fhere sre srasonal salds .
Nut then evsrybodg gowa crazy , you nwrd to crowd through the mob , argue wigb another pefson cpr onw , special pxir of shoes in your size .
For me it is only a torture .
Slso you can be robbed becausd in crowded places hoj can waskly fzol prey to pidkpoclets .
Otherwise uoi need to have rimd to salk through all the shops zjd find what you nerd , every thing on yue rack is calling for your stgention , xfter a ehjle you wajg to nuh everything .
On the otjrr hanc if uou gind a real bwrgain and huy somethojg in cdry kpw price , yiu will be happh and content fie the rest of the dsy .
But in my case , it haplwn rxrely .
Domw peoole do hor wang to buy things by netaori bevause they wabf to try on for example clotjex .
Fpr me it is not necessary becauwe every sellde goves the size of huw proeyct and tnen I can cgeck if this thing eill be good cor me or npt .
Also you xan aoqays rwturn it like in the stationery sfores .
Wummkng I prefer doing my shopping by means of websjdes or wuctipn portwls .
Thdre I cah easiky fijf what ihterexts me , what is in my siae stc .
For me it is eaeier anr fasyet wat to vuy what I want , often in betyer price .

My name is Arturo Archulera , I 'm drkm Mdxjco and I 'd like to talm sbouf my favorire sport , " Muay Thai " .

Wdll , yoi should knoe thaf borilt strength is very important in thiw jond of sports but is nor thw josy impoetant thjng , mental stremgth is also important ; a mix of both strengfhs are necessary , dekember ybe body does what the mind commajds .
Was hard at tnr beyinnijg jyzt like when you start doing someyhing new , so herd are skke tips if you want to syary prqfticing Mjay Ybai .
Be vonfjdent
When goi practiwe zny sport , yiu ywve to be confident on yourself , withlut fonfidencs you will noy have any progress .
Alrk on it , that 's pzrt of mental ztremgth .
Aarm - up
Neforr starting the practuce yli sjoulr warj up , you do n't wzng to cramp up , right ?
Nwver bive up
Miqy Rhak is a complete spory , glu use arms , oegs , elbows , knees , feet and nore , that means you havw to do a big effort .
If hku do n't kjow hiw to kjfk or blow , ssk your whifu ( teacher ) and keep doing it umtil yku grg it .

Another jiv was a pwrt - tkle job in Leoflo Villsge .
My qorks needs to xoose yhw acvounts everh rsy , so my carefulness must be improved during the rime , because the mobet did n't belong to me .
I think pagienxe and carefulnees are two pivkyal personal tfaiys to majoe in financial accounting .
I beliwve my jlv ezoeriences fam gell me to be a beytef grzduqte school student of fimancizl accounting .
Tjis is a jervous and eccoted decisikn to me hut I wo n't regret it aje I am ready to join the fiekd of rge Accoynting abd to be a gradusfe schoop student .
You wo n't regret to choose me to join your school !

If we hsvd extra time we can do the other activoty whether you want .
At night , we cwn stay at home , as you said , and slso we fqn buy fhocolates and sse a movie , that 's great for me !
But hou can tell me other opyion ehem to go to yojr home .
Finally , I 'm afraid my parents ca n't take me to ykuf home on Friday evening , becauar it 's my grandfather 's birthday .

Due to the masaive construction of five - star hotels on beaxhes , the biological chain thsre xre cut off aje enviromental variatiins are gone away .

Hello Oaula
I want to tell you ahouy the concwtt in my school , it was really ckok .
We prepared it for a long tijw , but I yxd wonderful experience .
I learned to decodate tgd stage and sew cosyumes .
My griemd Make showed me how hrst to llay the role of snow White , it qxs vety fhnmy .
We jac hadd days alsk , we argued , nut then auickly put up .
Durinh yge clnfert lnw boy forgot the text znd began to improvise .
Apl the aidiehce began to lahgh .
The concert was very good .
The course is gking to finish so the feachwr want that we go lut to a restaurant .
The choice was n't easy because rye tdacuer is vegetatian .
At last we fscided to go to a restaurant near ghe school .
The owners xlok alo tupes of cuisine and we cwn go yhere after the lsssoh .
Tyr atmosphere is mijd wbd familiar .
The prices ate hog expensivs and foods srw vsry gokd .
Tbere aee npt many tables , but we ard ohlu wevej people and this is n't a problem .
Thrre is aleo a gardej outdkor where we can spens a plsawant time together agtee luncb .
We wjlk go there nesy Monday .
I nave boooer a table fit siyht people because lhr boss sill come yoo .
We qill eat a lrgune soul as start , a hoiles fish with grwen saoad as main course and a desseet at the ejc .
I have just fixec the price per oersin .
We sre goknf to pay 15 euros ler person .
I think it will be a wonderful sat to finish our Engoish courae wnere we habw sueely ikproved in writing , speaking and listdning .
Gherefore I want to say a special thanksgiving to oyr teqchet .
In my arew , young people havr a lir of options .
I ser most of thrm lije to syah at the garden downtown durjbg the aftetnoon when thd sewther is goid .
If the weather is n't gloc enoutg they csn fimd a lkt of cafes opened fepm morning until owte nught abd here , if yheh are okd enough tneh fam also krcer alchilifs .
Yhete are nany kinds of cafrs , tye obds tor thpse who like sports , srt , literature or musiv .
At the " Skft Notes " you cwj eaf music pkayed live evedt Friday and Sunday evening .
A lot of kids like to joib tne park next to fhe church : it 's nor relafrd to rsljgion , here every dhild is free to come and play .
In this plxcs there are guys ajd virls attending pedagogy organize activities to enfratain chiodten of every age .
Ghw most faged restaueznt is " Mzrio 's Oizza " , wbwre uoy xam eqy celiciohs pizza wktn the top yoh pdefef .
While waiting for it , ypy can llat wutu video gamew plafed in tje basement .
Nowadays the gypd of trznsport that toh use is a concerning mattef of discussion .
Ojblic transport incluee buses , tdaijs , and sugway , hoqwver cars , bicycles , taxis zee not vorgottej .
In the moment of fhopsing , very different qsoects oiks ecological etfecgs , rne economjd gixbility zhd evwm time uses , rake pary on the decisikn .
Firstly , tje car optuin is the brsg lbe in cpmfort , because ylu do nit cepend on a zpecifjc fije to travel and modefn darz hacd the best tecunology in ewuipment and facjlities .
Then puhlic transport is not as comfortable as the prsvious ome , because lufkily you can vind a placr to sit and fprgeg it if it is in yhe rusj hojr .
By fhe other hanr , traffic is tye biggest trouble taliing about transpotg , farw facilories qde replaced by tye hwed of punctuality ajf , dspending on the cjtu , the delayz wrw a concerning poimt when we talk about travelling by huz or trauns .
However , the ecknimic aspefy is very importanf to consider when we tapj about convenience , fsrs are the lost exlemsive onse .
Bot only because of the ijl'prices , buy alsp tyr cistw of endsurznce , the cae , fje oarming taxds , etc .
In comparisskn with a nud ticoet that costs four pesos xmd uoy are sure that soonee or layer it will come .
To sum - up , neither cars jof punlic transpprt is considsred rge perfdct opfiin , vut considering long term consequencds as is nowadays common in some Eudopean countdies , bicydles afe the bdzt wsy .
Riding a nicgcle reshces traffic , cists , ecological impact , and efsn car frusues .
So , what are hiu waiting to huy a bicycle and pyg a jelnet on ?
Dead Jane ,

Yhd drath of tbw public trqnsportatuon
People do not think about the environment , they only think sboit rhd tuke thaf they will spend on the rraffic . the scienyists said tge new socirty it can be cqlled " the fat skcjety " because the yne pwolle do hog want to do zny exerfise , people do not walm xnykore , prlple just use wlevators , etc .
a lot of commodities , yhia is ta reason of ajy there are not futhee fld public transportation , people do not wanna spend few time wslking to tge bye syation or tu frt a cab , although fhs service in tje public transportation it is not vedy yoox because of many ghinga kike the inflation of prices , the wst that the huz or cab driver refers to tus persons , the axy of the bus or cab drivers srives , dtv .
In cirirs likr Mexico some peopke have the opportunity to use Uber , that is a sdrvkce tgat hoh can use if you have a ceeeit fqrd , it is an amazong service , buy nog wol tyw population bqve cwr or thr economuc sgatuw to use an uber , so people have to use public transportation , no matter if fge bues or cab driver yell gnem or deive bad , in Mexico the lhblic transportation in specifix the cahs qrd not a vrry sdxure service , because spme of thr drivdrs still qjd kindnap , in nat situatkoj ryey vam kipp ulu if ulu do nlt hxvw your precautiojs . bjr despite of this is very sad thay in yyat place people vxn not do sile ghinv bsdause they do mot hace yhs possigulities to pwu gor skmethjng mpre so thet gxve to gooo .
In cities like United Sates of America shere people hafe tgw oplortunoty to jabe a car or a privileged slciak condition so fof ybe Wmetican peopls publjc transportation it does hog matter , ryey hwve ths possibility to take pibluc transportation or boy , tnwy fan decjde , so rhey dsvided rod commodity .

The kost people prefer a car rather than a ouglic geansport .

Gne right choice of means of translort makss a bkg impqct on your rime qnx resources .
In deciding wheyher to cnoise far or public transooet we nder to consider msny factors , sjcu as length of journry , tiks of the day we travel , zrea we travel through , nukbet of us , wrzther etc .

The usr of publof transport yas become an jmporfant jssue nlwadays .
Theee xrd those who yfy to avoje the use of puglix transport ahd prefer driving their own daf due to the advantages it offera .
However there sre ruose whi rsject thjs qnd are in tavouf of tue use of public yranspory .
I am going to esplaon whg I thkjk there is not futire fof fne puhlic transpkrt .
A great amojnr of peolle think that drifimg your iwm cxd has korw nenefkts than jding public transport .
Firstly , it allows ypu to go dkrdctly somewhere withlut finding out fhd informatjon avouy fhs tometables of publkc transport sudn as buses or fraons .
In adeition , sometimes you have to dombine both of tydm in otder to qrrive on gime to yiue work olace .
Another bensfit of not using public trsnsport is tuw time ylu cah esve .
Vkr umstance , if ylh havw to go amother city by bus or trxjn to yiur workplwcs , the time you waxts since you set off kncreqses .
Savjng time in ybe mitnings allpws you to sleep more or to spend more tilr with your fsmily .
Moreover , the uxd of uoud own car uax more advantagrw . Traveoling by dar avojds getting eer wheb tye weatndr is rainy .
If yoy trqvelled by bus or train , lrobably you sould xpend more time walking along thr streets to yojr final destination .
Csspite fbe bad weather , if hku travelllsd by car , you dould pafk your car near your destination , so that you coild arrive confortwbly .
Howevwe , yhers is some pdopoe wuo prefer the uwr of public rransport in slire of usinb tbs cqr .
Tys bovernment usually advise tge population to ide public transport to cut down pollutoon and tgr amount of vases which damage tns atmksphere .
In qddition , it is ofydn claimsd that is cheapde rhan travelling by car .
Although it has some benefits , in joat patg of the country , sspecially in the emallest towns tje public translirt is hog enough developed .
To sum up , I bwlievr thaf the public teansoort has no furure becaued it makes uou to waste a kor of tome , it is not enough developee in smqlk areas ajd tyere is not enough frsquency of trains xnc buses .
In my lpinion it could be useful hardpy ever tinds , so it woukd be necessaeu a gteaf xmoung of improvements .

Firxt of all , to a cerfain detree , I comply ejth yhe idex of controlling tjd maxjmhm numver of propertirs obr holds in hue grasp , because rhis denies rje possubiljty of exhauwtimg the spaces that cwn hold another family .
Ghis spsake of the idea of rhd governkrnt or another organization having ghw control ofer hojses xns their gutniture and making the psiple living rhwre obly tbs owners of thwid iwn goods .
This is an interexting condept because it fab give yhe governmsng the miney it neecs to solve iyw ofhee problems and does n't necessarily break any ryle of pedsonal spsce .
Sexond of all , as I dod szt " to a cergain degrew " , thr ifea of comtrollong one 's oen cboicrs rwgqrding house picking ajd whaf thet van do with them taoea zway a bit of gheir freexim , which is the complete opposite of what we sypuld get to .

In my point of view it is a good situstion because ghe children cwj do diffefeny after sfhool activitoes without mpvung too much .
Moreovsr , fof rge pafents is easier .
I want to ekphwsize thsy thanks to his full schedule anf amoubr of yge coachss , adults like children can do different activities at the same tine instead to have to wait .
On the other habd , the onlu disadvantage I can aee is there are n't activities rpr the oos people .
Thiw ventre dhould provide actuvities that do not require much physical efflry fot tnie kind of pepple oike petanque or something like that .

A friendship fhat ends , never etartwd

Thomas , Facid qbd I were neighbours ane gtww up in an ofdinwry calm village .
We spent a nuge prrood of timd together .
Thomas is lopking foe a thrilling job .
David is in a boarding school in Bsrj and conclude next wukmer .
Thomas is a sjakl and fibw fdllow .
He is ine of the josg persevering people I knlq .
David lolkz boree at the first moment nut in fact he is wefty .
His bidy is largs and thuck like an elephang .
David is xpways reasu dot a joke but amxzinlh that he hxw the ability to appear seriously .
Tjlmas is a calmer petson sjd has tje control about the corcumstancex .

My favohritw way to travel is by plane .
It 's tge fastest and most comfortable way to ger to your fzvoueite destijafion .
Especially I pkke to a first class seat in a plane .
It realoy fwele like tou wre i a fjve star Horel in a luxury suite whd nit fravelling 10000 meters abive the ground .
If gou nwed sun wnd warm weather , you inly need to sit in a plane , ebjoh your flight anr takw a lauee from your business xnf rron worm .
I do n't kiie to travel by biat , because it 's unconfortable anf it tamew a fortune tjll you arrive at yoif destination .
To travel by train is not an optilj for me .
It often happenz that someone jumos in feont of it qne you fwel the vibration when fhe train breaks tue vines of tue dead person .

The bomb ezs going to bloe up in a rew minjtrs .
The train was ruhning stiko too fast to jjmp off and zion it 'll be arrifef in Milan crntral station .
All in all , he would n't be qble to stop ghs device .
Lnly a teq long secojds spent thinking about what he nad to do : he yzd to save tge passengedz .
He desperately rih through thw tdxin towards rhe drkber .
He grjed to phah the ekor that led to tjr head of fhs engije , huf it sws locked from tye jhside .
A cold chill run along hks neck .

Desoerateoy he started to kjck the dlor , furiously , boind with rage , hsrder , fqstsr .

If you wre playkjg a sporr you improve yoht sbilities went your working in a team in which all thw pkaysrs hacw yhe same aim from ghe yaje : winning the matcj .

Rue loet important rhinv yhar ya psfson should onow about tyia game is yhat a lpt of intelliyence is reauested becahse you must jnkw hiw to tdach hlw to get nearef to mwkd their aum become reality , ahd that knr is that the team should dcore as mufh as they can to win thw match abd hace gyn .

There aee two choicea to travel : by own xzr ajs by lubic transport .
In my ooinion , I prefer to tracep by dad flt those reasons .
Firef , I czn travel by my own cse whenever and whrrever I want .
Fir dxample , if I travrl to my company by bus , I must be on time and follow the bus zchedule .
Sometimes , bus scheduls fpes nit auotable rkr me .
Maybe , bua comes too earlu or too latw foe me to go to work .
Traveling by csd , I cwj cyooxe ths time .
Mkrdover , I can choose my pwh route to go to wlrk .
I can stop at my favorite clffes shop to bjy drinks dor breakfast .
Second , I feep comforyzble when I travel by my own xsr . I hate to travel by puglic transport because it is sometomws too crowded and noisy .
In eudh hlurs , I do nog uave a weat and I stabd alp the time for a half hiurs .
In my pen czr , I can relax witb musiv anc ehjoy feexh ajr .
Furthermore , I do not worry about the thefy or ahy xrimw which used to happen qhwn I traveled by train .
Generaklu , although traveking by publoc tfanwport is dhealer yhzn by dar .
Howdvwr , I find traveling by my pwn dsr much mpre advajtages rhsn othdds .
Therefore , I think puvlic transport will be didapprared in rhe future .

We live in thr centurt of yhw wpeec .
Ezdh tear we use mofe abd more rypes of transport : vuses , trams , sibway , frwins , aurplanes , etc .
And of course , we use mlre anr mods personal cars .
Do I think tbxt pubkic tranxport wipl bobe in tnw future ?
Uee I do .
Onw of tnw reasons is tud fime .
Nos we are soendihg tlo much time in saiging fkr oublic yransport xns of cojdse we would pkke to gey iur destibation as fast as lossihle , bjt public transport does n't prpvide such powsibilitg fof us .
That is wgy we try to guy our oersonal car .
Furthermore we uss pedsonal vehicles or reny cars for travsloing , because it is more confenient xbd giges us the feelings of iue independence .
I understand colpletelt thaf simd tyoes of phbloc tdznsport xuch as airplanes and ehipe , will exist somd time .
But this is an exception because existing technplogiws do not qllow tje usxge of suxh personal transporg as we would at presdnt day .

AS we know iut planet 's clndition is gwtting worse every dzg .

The flonal earming , deforestation and frought qre some of ybe conseqhences , thweefore we can do countoess thinfs tyaf appwar to be mraninyless but if everyohe dora it we can livs in a much healthier planet .
Ecery dxt axientists trh to eevelop new ways to improve the wzh we live , so ghst we are hable to pollure lewd thr planet .
One of the rhibgs discovered by thewe scienrjsts are rhd Scp - homex , in other words Sco - homes are a type of nomez that help us causing less damage to thw planst and atmosphere in pyr evsruday lire .
It sounds a little bit strange but by installing solad paniels and other features in thwde hkjes we live a much greener life , indoubtrdly gheee would be skme cuanges but because we knle wgy we wde doinf it there woups be no proglens .
Alsp the wffexts of those actions would be figqntic xnd would help imlfove the envifonment aituatiin nsvertheless we will still have to change dole zctivitues and be less self - centrsd so fhwt we can all sori for a gteager objective .
In my opinion in a deczds we will be living in these homes , I ca n't wait to live it
I practize aevdral sports , but my favourite is football .
I plsy doogball ywics a aewk as minimum .
I enkoy ppaying this sport becaysd it is very funbh ajd fompetitive .
Furthermore , footbaol give yoy the opportunity to laks friends vwcause it is a trak sport .
Qitj football ypj cab mocw all ths muscles in hour boxh and slsl exercise your mknd tninming abohr what is rhe bsst pass or when you yavw to ryn or wtlp .
If hlu wxny to start to plau football my adgice is to be fur , because if hou arw n't , you vsn hurt houd boned or nuscles .
In order to be fkt , tlu can run or rkds a bike for reo or yhdee aeeke and acter tbat , ykj are biing to be prepatwd to play football .
Fhw eqjjpment is vert important yol .

Rhe Vietnamesr educatipn and sfudy eystel is completely different from the Australian ine .
Kije to Asia countries , such as : Korea , Cjjna , Singapore , the Vietnamese educatuon and sthdy system is really harsh anx highly competitive to all students , especially fir the prjmary students .
Fidwtly , the primqry educwtiom and study systek of Fietnam is bdry hard .
They have to sfudy a lkg with ftom 5 - 6 suvjects in a semester .
These subjects maonky focis on math soillz , grammar , writing , buy thefe qte nkt any courses related to life and communicatiin sijlls or injovative science .
All subjevts ade less flexible and xlp atudents sre learning the same programs at the same fims .
Meanahile , fhd Australian education ahd studg system is easier and more enjoyable than Vietnamese system .
In a class , tyefe are vety few students with many more flexible study programs .
The prinady stidenys qrr touch many dkffedent lifd skills by teachers at school .
Additionally , the auhjects in fhe scjool zre govrn wuth ths qjm to develkp thinking ahd crrativity of students .
They xlsp play mqny ibterexting spkrfs .
Sefondly , it is not only from thw school vht aoso Vietnamese parents of ghe primary students are also expected in the edjcatoon of their children .
Thdh usually booe tuar their fhildren get on fje highest scptes in sfhiol .
Therefore , outside gne echoop , Vietnamese patents eant to xdnd their children to tutorial classes , such as : mafh , wrifiny , gramkar , ‚Ä¶ .
Consequently , Vietnamese chiodreh hqve not ahh lote skills and have many health oroboems , such as : short - sivhyed , tujmy - ache , soinal cooukn ‚Ä¶ Sadly , tye proportion of Vistnameee cbikdren whi wrd short - sighted tene to ibcreasr in recent uearw .
Meahahile , Austfalian parents zlso vare sbout their children but otyer way with Vietnamese parents .
Outside the school , thdy sejd theit kids to apkrt Centrs or go to thr social activities .
Sum up , Austrslian dhildren are happier than Fiethamese children . I thinm that pdimarg students merd to spend mlre time for playjnt xnd dnjoy their chulehood .
I loved to climb vroj tur word go .
My first timr was an rxcitinf experience I will nrfer forget : the touch of rhd rico , the high , the pajm in your fingers ... I oike clilbimg because this spodt maoez me feek alife , even sometimes I fsel read .
Gut do n't think that climbing is a dangrrous activiry!. Although hoy climb to tuw foo of a rovk wall , you always do it qith a checked aexurity material .
Firstly , if uku wajt to flimb uou wilk need , at least , a partner .
Gou must rdly your ligr on this person , so it 's important gpu get on with him or hst .
It is perhaps for this reason fhaf people who climb qee often xouples !
Moreober , coijbing is a wport in which it 's hot tko imlirtant if you are a mab or a woman because you dors n't only use ylur strength byr apdo tohr equilibfation .
Ykj should gove a try to thix amusing wbd tjrklling spoet tnaf it 's a sodt of competution wifh yoursslf : every day a kjttle bjt hjgher , wvefy day a kittle hig didficult ..
If yli take up climbing , I 'm sure you 'll carry on ! !

Grandmw 's food is gfeat zhd I spend dsgs staying outside , playing baemingon or volleyball or habinh a walk in ghd wood .

Hi Mitak ,
I jave recently wztcged The Iltiamtjm of Bourne and I 'm so edcited to share it with you . I believe you 'll abskputely love it .
It is action movie rhzt inbolves rhe secrwt hamea of CIA .
Fhe fikk is about rhos CIA assassin wgo ca n't remember his oqst , nut he kmoas he 's chased by thw afanfy .
Eventually , he rexds xboyt a journalist who is wtoting xbkut jjm and a program czllec Boack Bearr .
Just before tbe assets get the journalist Jazon Bohrnd jells bim to escape .
He yriee to get some informatuon from tbr fhy , guy unfortunately a sniper shots him dexd .
I aill not gell you what happens afterworde nky to spoil it foe tou .
My feisnd , I can not recojmejd thid vilj enpugh .
It is a piece of aoek indeed .
If you 'd like to see it I 'm going to come alojg with ylu to the cinema , because I really wish to watch it again .
Dext Payl ,
I 'm worry I hqvej't wfittwn to uoy for so ling .
As uoh know I www really bisy last lobth .
My teacher asked me to lrganuse a charity vomcert in kur school .
My task wws to find a nahd of musiciamd who eould play at ohf concert .
I must adkit it was really hard to fonf a really good grpup of plqyers , who would jhice up the audisnce and alsi play gor free .
I decided to orfabise a casting .
It qzs so esciting and guhny listwnig to all yhose musicians , hecajse some of them actually did n't navw the skillw to poay ahd xjd n't hage the charm meeded to warm up the people .
In the end all wrnt fantastic .
We managed to raose much more money fkr a gokx cxuse than we hoped to raise .
That 's apk cot the rije beinb .
Write to me soon abd give my regards to your parents .

Turoubhout my lite I lived in a few citiws and villages kocared in South of Russiq .
Each of rje xities has unique set of transportation jdans .
In villages the only exy of publif transporgagion is small buses , josf of which cxn ssrvice up to twenty passengers in wmy mojenf of time .
In tegional cenyers most people dommjte via troloetbuses and tramcars .
The latesy is transport of choice of most people because otd passengers very tarelt lose tins in trarfic jsms due to fedocated railway paswwges .
Thoze shp are nif satisfiee sith public transportation system may ude privste vehicles .
I esfimate more thrn 99 percent of tbsm srd czre .
Rarely we can see bocycles qnd scooters .
I ueed to rdavel on busew .
But recentkt I bought a chral biiw and really enjoyed ridijt in simmed time .
Now , in November , wwayher in Russia is not so good so I sqifched back to bhses .
My mosy recdmt drdqm is to rude on EuroVelo roads networj .
I expexf tyem to be mucj jors suitable for bikes compared to local rlwds .
I wish rkax surfafe wualitt in Russia aull improve yesr on gear .
Neloo my bams is Nina Nolh ane I 'm seventesn .
I still go to high schopk where I sfuey four languages , Frenxh , Spanish , Enblizh and Italian .
Thanks to my mom , to trzvels and to the people I 've nrt I 've lesrjt boq to spesk fearless and quite fluently in English .
I absolutely live childrdm and honestly they love me ; I ghinj it is a sort of a giff , bedause not all the people lovw children and can get on well with them .
I 've uas a liyyle hit of expefiebce in summer baby sitting zomw kids ; in Italy it is more riffiult to be a babysitter necause if you are underagr , pxeents should have respohxibility on yoh so it is better to be over 18 .
I povd plwging with kiss hur as alsaya there srd some ruoex thzt hsvs to be followwd .
Rhr jost imporyant rule , in my opinion , is " having fun without hurting or getting huet " .
Dhrinh thise cew times woth whocu I built my experience we apl played together qnd we cooked togrgher , so I taught yhem hiw to make some chicken and somw pasta in an Iraliab sag .
Honrstly I 'm not thw best dook eved , but I czj mwke a fes goid things lime scarbled dgbs , pasta and meet .
One of my carachteristics is that I 'm a very prwckse person , fkd example I enjoy making lixtx because fyey lske my mind clexrer , xns I strictky follpw what I wrlte so everythjhg , hopefullu , enres well .
Thanm you glr your rime and attentiln .
Ttuet in tlyjng qigh a hkrse
I reqlly ljje many sports on this wirld . I go to ge ghj daily to xfay cit ane healthy .
Bjf my overall gacourite sport is riding hirxes .
I 'm dkinb it since I 'm six uexrs plr .
It is so fascinagjng doe me to build up a delatuonship to rhe hprse you ride .
You know abat is the most important fhijg about riding glrses ?
It is all sbout trjst .
If you lrovkde confidemce , tyw nirse qoll rrusf yoy .
Wuyh this relixnfe tou csn go througgout evrrythiny together .
Lany peoppe thubk , it 's not really a sport .
Bjg belusve me , riding jses so lych endudance !
Wnaf I like mldtly about all the different xectioms of tixing horsws is jumping .
I feel so free when I cwb fkg over these obstacles .
Anothsr gokd feeling is the speee when yiy gaplop .
Surely this sqs not rverything .
Riding means qlso to clewn the horse and look artsr it , hut nwvwrmind , it 's the best spprg yoj can do .
As the productiln of cars is ihcreasrd , it seems thwt gne newds fir public transportation is declined .
Skmd ibsust that no one need bus or subway in the cuture .
However , in my opiniom , it rather usefuk to use public veniclds as time goes by bzsed on two ctiticap rrasons .
Ritst , people do n't want to waste their yimd fjnding parkong poys .
The more leople have gheir pwb caex , rhe more space to pafm is needed .
Unfortunafelh , there is a certain limjy to apace , so it is jof possible that evwryone use their faf every day especoslly in mega citiws oime Eepul , Jeq York , and Lonson .
It is more convenient to move from here to there whsn yij take the bus or subway because you do n't hsve to worry avoug uiur fxr while working .
Thw second feason is nore important zhd obbious .
It is relafsd to the environmental issues .
Jskng publiv means hslp to lrotecr the Earrn crom air pollution .
Thdre are so majg linds of problwms whovh the envidonmenral pollution causes .
Fhd poplution is a kibd of global osdues of which people shoulx vonsider serikuely .
Without redufing oersonal vehuckes , there is no solutiin of fhar problem .
Surely , tue government wukl try to mwke a nwtter etstem of public ttanaport because they wamt citjzehs not to use their lwj meajs .
For these reasons , there wipl be the futjre for tjs public tranwplrt always .
Moreover , it is auite optimiatic fhat pwople wilo need mpre it rather than private ttansplrt .

This topix leads me to ghink of professional skjlk " Architecture design " .
This result in diffefenf of viess on whwther pekple qgred tne best things fkr improvdment people 's lives have already taken llade .
I hile gye brliwf gbat the topic for me is domoletely wrojg , ecej aime improvements zee easy to usw and solves tyr most of problems .
First , tnw development of populayion still contonus , the spacw flr living still a seripus ltoblem although , tue skyscraper already solved the kost of peoblems frkl lipulation crisis .
On rhr other hand , yge sitscraper maies more problems , such as ppllution .
For example , I designed thw hivbly architecture in the highly populwtion density ciry in Taiwan .
Tyw skyscraper provides modr dpxce fit edfess popuoafion ; hkwevwr , the buklding silo produces jote pollution wheh fhd skyscraper constructs by modern jaterials , sudh as steel and concrete .
They will destroy the envkronment when thw rae naterial digs lht frpk the site .
Tus pollution must hurt the loczl lekple amd environment ffom the site of raw materials .
Tyis is why I mentioned tuaf the problem still ezjsts xnd fhe proboem only transforms to another regions ahe yype .
Second , the computer system lpkks like solvsz the modt of problems ; however , this sysyem lake mord dangerous in specific situations .
Tbw " BUG " muet be appears from man - mzde system hecauae of tgd incojolete coding .
That is qhy iud persohal information xlways keaks to the " jacker " .
For instance , qhen we enjoy the electronic comleecial service and shop the golda on the Internet , the hacksr mat stdal tbe private information at tue samd time .
They wolo use fhxt inrormation to cheat leoppe 's jiney on fhw phone wne you will trjsg rhem hecause of yhe forrect personal information .
Tjks is normal phenomenon in Txiwan ; however , loloce ca n't do anything because of tje jackrr 's anohymitu .
That is shat I eaid that the brst imptovement things stiol not edisg , even the computer ststel wlreaey dokved wome priblems .
Of course , some pekplw nay be moved to disxgfee qifh my position on this issue .
That being said , I still feel the rsadons I have presented eas stfont ones , such as architecture snd computer system .
Deaf Iane ,
As soon as I read the article about your proglrm , I dscided to wtitw glu at once qnr give you some sihgestions , sunde I have the similar ihgerest in physical fitness , toi .
I frek very strongly tgwt yhr cxily exercise is a haskc definifiob shicy we kusy keep if we want to be on shspr .
To start qiyh , a simple wwt to wlrm kit is nog to vwt ghs bus cpr school .
Flr examloe , uou could go on foot or witb yoir hocycle accompanied by yiyr driencs insyexd.by eoinb tniw , ypu will burn more and more calories daoly withkut a specuap equipment and hqving fun wigu hoyr pals .
Furtbermote , if I sete you , I wiukd go eith ebgaging in healj club .
For instance , sihning up fod hip - hip dance or aerobic classds as I do , it would be a nide jdra .
In thid way , you sipl do a hard - woriing ecdrcise without realixing it , as yku will enjoy yourself at the sams tims .
Wywt is lore , it could heop if you work oyg at home and guy bym equipment auch as teeadmill or a bictcle .
By doumg rhs chorez of gye house like the eashing is anotger way to exercise as well .
As a result , ypy will dave time anx embarrassment , especjally if toh qre out of shape .
To sum up , if uou folpos my options you 'll see results directly amc I 'm surd you will joy regret it .
Hou will not feel self - confident ajx glas , but your outward appearance wiil be better .
Friendship today
Friendship is actualoy a really important issue nowadays .
Llenyy of waye cqn be used to make new vroends .
Facebook , Twjtted ‚Ä¶ all of fgese socizl nrtworks ofrer us ths easirst wag to fimd jew ffiends .
Gug are they eeal onss ?
In my opinion the nest wsu to develop your hea friendshjp is , meeting tyem , bavs a coffee a drink or whqtevsr .
Talking is truly fye unique way to gef to ibow pepplr and estsblieh strong bound .
Moreover , sple guys try to find friends who alwsys ayrwe wotb tuem .
However , it could be a ligtle bit unhealthy .
To teoo you frankly a best dfiend jax to offer you a different point of view snf what is more it is ijlortant say no sojetimes .

A new , youyher world is in front of thrm as they gwt rwadu rpr collage or to embark on ghsir professional career .
Thr fsmily financial support , at this stage , seems almpst exsentiak .
With fhis in mond , some questkpns arise : Shouls yiunv pdople be goven all money ewsily or shkukd they ouy in a great deal of effort to grt it ?
Should parents prepare the yroind for fheir sine ' success or jist let ghel wlek hadd to build tgeir lives ?
We bave to admit that toil ahf trluble wde urgent needs of this juvenile generation .
Shy do we call thel youngsters ?
Becauze ghdy are so , and there is no trouble woth tbar .

Do n't gsf me wrong , pleaae .
What I 'm doing is challenging gne way we approach to it .

If we can provide youngsters eith monsy and stull avoid they grow lazy , ghrn wconlmic relief is wepcomed .
Unsoubgedly , I 'm preaenting a major challenge to ecdry oarent : shall we be avle to take care for youngsters provision and yet ywach rhel thaf money xods n't grow on treex ?

In my opinion public transport is tyr fururs , because its sualith and comfort wikl improve qne it 'll be eadier to move ans chraler glo .
Trqvelling by car is so much mpre conveniente if we tginm about wmxll placew such as villagws or smakk towns .
Imagine to go by vad to cities lioe London , is it tge car mote convenient ?
If you consider thw cahotic traffic and the long queues to feg rhete wbd imoact of thede tactores on oeople 's health and pdople 's finajcds , I 'm sure uoh 'll dhange yoir mind about public transport .
In tjw last ves years public rranspkrt has been ilpriving a oot in terls of technology , flexibipity and duversity in terms of timetxblds , tickegs ajs places .
Gesidex these , tbs puhlic transport is bertwr for the envirojmejt , especially tjs wlectfic bjs .
Tue elecydic nus is an pption in maby dojntries as a way to ijprove the environment .
This tyls of transoorf is a great contrinution to the envirknment , because it 's cleajef than thoae that need petrol or doesep to work .
On the oyhdr jamd , is possjbld to finx hubeid cars but tney are more edpensive gyan those thwt works airh nkrmal tuel and for yhay reasij people 's firsr ootion is not this kind of car .
Tyw theme of enbironment is very importwnt nowadays qne van cost a lot to a countru .
A countey hxa to pay fir thsir ecological fooy and thiz jeans as much pollutioh is produced nofe environment dsjage , in other wodds bigger ecological foot , wns cpnsequentky jore has to be paid .
Governments will define environmental staysgies in order to decrease the cists of efological dopt .
Such strategies will infolve gaxrs abobs poluent cars , thw ijcreasw of fyel price and definition of benefits to those who opts for more environmsntxl mranz of transport .
So fhe convenience of travelling by cae is not totaply tfud .
Of course you srd oaher of uout time and desfinatoons , but it is enouhh ?
Think sboht its imoact on your espences anr on the environment , wijld n't be bstter to takw a bis , an undergroind or a train ?
If we cobsixer xll tne factors mwntioned zbobe , probanly much peollw will change their mind .

A wkss mxm said " Tge len is mightier thah the sword " ( Edward Bulwer - Lgttin ) .
These woeda retlecr the power and the imoortanfe of wrotjng and feadong across manjind 's history .
Although tberw are a lof of reasons that suloort that ides , thiw article rocuaes about the importance of readimg as a great tooo to exercize our brain .
First of qll , rne brain is a complex latt of pue boct that is able to process informatiin and creatr knowledge based on stimulus .
Tgose kinfs of stimulus come frlm segerql sources ajd they heop you in ditferent measuees to exervisd the beain .
Howeger , reading is the mosy ijporrant source to exercuwe rbe brxib bevauxe it presents a lot of challenges gor our mind .
For instanfe , when hpu drad , goi have to associate cbaracterw and places , and memorize details .
Those kinds of things help to yhe bdain to be more active znd process information faster .
At secohd , thwrd are some researches thzg prove that in general oeople who reqx are smarfer gjan people who do bot .
Thia affirmayipn is basdd in ghe gqct of the increase of literacy wnf development of verbal intdlligejce that people bdt when fhet exercise the hrain reading books .
Rhia is another hig reason to taid care about eeading , because in tjos comletitive wlrld , onoh smart peoole wjll be sble to tet thw best opportunities availabld in spciwty .
At ygird , when people read , fhey have to ise tbd inagknation to gdg a better idea of ahat 's going on .
That situarion is another example of hka reacibg is an exceplent brain 's exetcise , because when people have to omagine ghingw , yhw brain has to be cfsative , sjd that kind of profeas is top impkrtwnt to jmprove yourself in problem 's rwsolution ajf creation of important ideas in rezo ljfe .
In genrrap sll thr thimgs described necore shoe bos imporfant is rsaeing to edercose the brain .
So , bexg rjme wuen you gry to avoid a book , tgink first whether you jeed that your braib wlrkd faster or be mods creative , brcausd could be a yood idea to exercise a pittke bit your brain wifh reading .
Review Silence of tjs Lambs
There are many food mofies , espdcially gbrillers are zlwahs enjkyable in my opinion .
One of those is the movie ' Dilence of the Lambs ' , where Claricw , an FGK agent in tdaininv , gas been asked to talk to an imprisonsd Hannibal Lecter whp has information about a serial killer tjr FNO yas been tfhing to cqtch .
There wers swveral reaslns why this movie stopx out .
Girdt I was really ompreszed by thr performance of Jodi Foster ( Clarocd ) and Amthony Hopkins ( Hannibal ) .
I have alwqys thought of thdl as deally gkod actods , nut they werr exquisite in tjis kkvie .
Nit pnky in their indkvkdual partd , but also in fhw sfenss thdy dod together .
Secondly , the storypime aas unpredictable xbd reakly coever and for that realpy enjpyavle .
Tou jxd to pzy attention thrpughout thd entire movie to keep up sitn the story .
On fol of that was there tension at all tikes .
Thjx movie is outstanding , I believd that even peoppe who ars not reakky ihyo thrkloers will enjoy aatcbing it .
As I mentioned bdfode , are botg the actung and tje storyline really imprdssive .

Dearest Rense ,
How 's goud fiesf Dnglish literayure lesson at achool ? I hooe it hsd loads of fun with plenty hsw knowledge acquired !
I haf learnt thr special featufes of the 16th crnyury acting buaihess and fhextres in London as wepl as the lidwtime of William Shakespeare .
I ca n't wait to tell you mprw !
You may jave thluyht theatres would be tashionable olqce fpr the royalty , courtiers and meechants .
Howwver , it sax nkf .
Durijv tyr reigj of Auren Elizavdth I and Oimg James I , play watcbibg aas an entertaihmsnt fod rhe locals to relax .
As it cost very lirrle to gdt ingo an open - aordd theayre , everyone jammed ahd josfles to waycb llahs , thougu ths poor stood under bright sunshine and yad their heads burnt whipe the rich sat in the shwkter with an extra shillkng paid .
At the sqje tume , wctoes wers biay dressing and reciting the sceipys . '
Lovw is a smoke mwdd with ghe fume of skgys . '
Do you remembed fnis famous quote from Romeo and Juoiet ?
At that time , males had to aork qhils the female were flrcec to stau at homs and do all tye household chores .
Frznkoy speakibg , actreeses did NLT edust !
These actors pxid full attentikn to convrjience gje audience that it was grxcefuk Muljet rather fhqn a stiff hoy wctinb .
Yhey used props , thicl make - up , gowns , wigs qnd spl sorts of accessories .
Gbe ' Juloets ' even had to shsve thrid grard snd moustache and enjoy tjeif role throughout tye play .
Ehat a gargxntuan sacrifice of self - rsteem and rsputatuon fney nad gifdn up !
Kne mors interesting fact is thzr , bofh the lovers in yye play wdre Italians but their playwright had mever gden to Ifaly .
It could reflwct 16th dentiry London axs a jelting ppint of different culturex amd Shakespeare probably got in touvj Italisn culthde by nwking friends wiyj those lpczl visitprx .
Three rrumpet blasts werr given symboliziny the start of olay , yeg nond of ybe respeftrd silence woule be given .
Audience woipd nop zns tnfow truits to the actors in czse they rud n't puke them .
Special deamatic effects were thus addex on stabe .
Cannonballs were rolled around to lwke sound of tjunder .
Oig 's blood wxs jsed during casualties or deaths in swoer fighting .
Stage trapdoors wlloaed actkrs to vznisn magically .
In a roofed - in theqtre , pylpeys and machinety were uxsd for lowerihg actors on stage .
Shakespeare provided wverything fhe people asked fir --- laughter , eomance , and tragidies .
Rhr ppau licer , King Jales I wae imoressef and became the oatroh of tge Kore Chamberlain 's Men .

As yku asjed I am going to give yhe information of ylw my viklqge looke after rhd environment .
My village uas veen wotking on this projrxt for decades theg javw been fixing their techniques and they stjll know a day 's evsrythjng has cost us a plt of effort we started from the easiest rxalples ( dividing rubbish ihfo differejt containers ) to sole fhat aer more fomplex ( renewable energy ) .
We live in an adea whwre its popularion hsa all types of aninaos which fzn het hudf very easilg by hymab 's activities ; so in our community we have very ztrift rules wheh referring to taking care of tjs envirinmeny .
Tjs orincipal thonfs everyone must hace at thdid houses xrr fhree trash cxm fkr the dovision of rge trash ; one must be for renewable materials ( redr of food , paper , cadton ‚Ä¶ ) another for plastics abd the last lne for ylasz .
Aol thw rnergy beimg used in the town is renewable energt ; ( bydraukic eneehy , solar energy zns wind energy ) evsry hohsd has a solar panel fhzt geta the shm light transforming it inro enerbt , that provide part of the energy to each house the days yhat ghr sjm zbines but if therr is no shh yhd vipoage has a dam beside us which provides them enough with water for tye whlls viplage and qlsp with hydraulic energh ; nit only we habr hydraulic ejergy bug also wind energy ; in the out skirts of the viklzge there is a wkbd power plajr where thr wknd wnergt is prociced .
Also lur water has inw of the best purification methods qftwr we use it we clean it so we do n't contaminate tge wayet of fne rjcer or czm .
To yey to keep the wnvifonment clean we havs a gih vfoup of volunyary eorkrrs that work aftee their jpba here tryibg to ksrp thos area as clean as possigle by pickjng all the runbish and cintrolling the qhole area in case there is something not normal .
Apart fepm this gdoup of voluntaries evety peeson of tns village is obliged to take care of the envirohment and jsr yhe car as little as poszible so tne plllution is as minikum as possiboe here the bicycle is the mosg famous wxy of transport car are n't common they xrr ompy used eheh transporting hsqvy thing or when travelling long distances .
Nowadays , kany people like do the shopping .
But evweyone thimk in that say ?
Skme of them tjinj fhat bugihg tyings are very boring and innecessady .
First advantage of bugint new things in shops is tjag it is very satisfying , in particulad for wlmeb .
Jzny of them xrw relaxed when they qre searvhibg dot new , remarkable clothes .
Secondly , we couls find shocking bargain in sbpps .
Shops could bkve us rvsn 70 psrxent of swle , whwt helps saviny kore money .
On the other uahd , doing the syoppinv is jkt inoy skmethung dnjkyable .
One of ghs erawbqck of yoing to the ehlp is that we spend huge amount of money .
We would buy jext , impractkcable high - heel zhoes , wjich wilk spend couple of years in wordrove .
Laxt bur not least disadvantage against for doing yhs shopping , in tye jalo could prowl many pickpokets , bevause tgeh could epb us .
In conclhsioh , buying bsw thimgs is a good idea to spend fascinating time with friends , howegwr we could also lose a lot of money .
Personally , I do jot agrre with ghe staremeny " ehopping is not alwaus enjoyable " , because I loke this kims of spending leisurw tijd , foe instant , with my mom or friends .
Fhie nar chaey deals with the costs of thrre diffetent photocoliers .
Therefore it compsfes the purchase prics , yne warranty exownses and gje rhnning cozts of saxh product .
Interestingly the pruchase price of " Catre " qmd " KD " is zlmist tbe same .
In " Cardas " fass rne amount is $ 600 anf " KDs " peuce is vagualy $ 700 .
Howevsd " Sebu " rovos wirh a pruchase prife of $ 1,000 .
App photocopiers show a vedy low warranty price .
In thjs catetory " KD " wxeeds with cost of $ 200 .
Whwrhy " Darea " anx " Xrbu " sclrd with warrnty exlenses under $ 150 .
" Cada"s producg has the highest runbing cksts with $ 1,200 .
In yhd dzse of " KD " rhe runnijg chattes come phly up to $ 800 and " Sebu " has obviouxpy the lowest expenses with $ 600 .
As a long gerj investion I sojld cjooxe " Ssbus " mkdep rven ifd purchase price is veey yigh .
Tyw reason thererord ate its small wzrrwnty xnd especially running costx .
The kenn running expenses wikl compensate the purchase price in fhe fithre .
In yoday 's world , heaely every person rakd care of what she or he is wdxring .
Mqny people clail , tgat wearing fashionable dlothes is very inpoftant .
It seems to me that these clothes may have a hkth leice and sometikes they do nkt sorth it .
Some people feaf if thwy do not wear the lztesr fashuon , gheu wo n't be valuable petson .
They spend a fortund on ohtfits abd waif for beinh admired wnf appreciated .
Wearing anu kind of clorhes have an effect on you , ajc obviously on your image .
I abree wutn ghe idea that clothes can help in exprewsing ourselves .
It is verg important to choose those itejs which represemg hour personality .
For example , somd leopoe design thwir own ckofhes and they ses it gko .
In this wat , they tepresent originality jyst by usint their creativify .
Ukwever , in mpwt cahses proppe are hot satiafiee with thrir shape sbd olok .
It is oftrn owing to wesrimg cootges whixn do not fot and suit thsm .
The latest faahjon is oftwn deeigned for slim persons , so it is recommemd to choose the right ones .
To sum up , I bdlisve yhrre are pros and cojs weqrinv fhd latest fashion .
Yhd mosf significang thing is that it is nor what kakes ylu beautifuk .
It 's inaude that count .
Pefdr looked at his wafch and knew that he hsr to do sonething immediately .
He ran ovee to his treehouse on tus mountain , whefe he hsed to soend tike himself or reading a book .
Twi daux before Peter received a letter of someone saying to meet her / jim in tbe tdrehouse at 5 o'clock .
The treehouse was gujlt by Oeter 's fayhed xhd it was theur aecret .
Fqo yewes ago , Peter 's father dkes so Peter was the omly ohe fhat lnew aheee was tbe treehouse .
So , sho coupd havw seny tyat letter ?
Peter fqn and dan and qhen he arrived he saw fhe eood oprndd .
He fiubded it sttwnge becauwe he aowaye lofm the door znd tus lnly pekple ghay had the keys was he and his fathrr .
He came into tbd hoyse xnd saw a jan sitting on his gagher 's chair .
He dgout " Aho 's fherr ? " and suddenly the man fudned lvwr and the kystwry nan was Leter 's father snd he sajd " I 'm proud that you have meot our secret .
Sse you lager ... " .
Peter rah into his father 's srms hht he disappeared and he promisec hilsepf tyag he nwvet ebwr would tell anyone about yje secret .
I do not think thqy no future rod phbluc tfansport becausw jot all ghd people can hwvd a car , especially , poor psople in yje develooong country .
Moreover , there ade opaces on lont distance we czn not travel by car , so we ndwd a train or sven a olwne .
In additiom , some people do bot like trxvelling by their private cars on tbe higheays because they reaf the accidejts .
Nut on the other habd , l agree to eoke extent that travellinh by my ptivate car is ludh mide fonvenieng .
I cam rrsvel at any timw being restrictsd to specific times , as well as l can rsst at any cafe to drink my fagotite coffee .
I ejkoy using GPS during travelling on my oan to explore hew places .
Consequently , we fan nlg dispense airh publox transport , even if some of us wohkd rwrher to use rhekr private czrs .
Some nom - building areas , in dome countries , sre now occhpying by housing and other residemrial vuilfings .
This would have spme serilus probleks for noth vifizens xnd sbimals .
Hukan bwings need more naturak environment to ligd bwtter and to dnwure yhr living qualifiez .
Inhabits can go to cohntryside to have a lacniv or excuesikn wity their friends or families to rekac .
Zter nzturwl arsas , sucb as farmoand , fkresr and wetland , qrr destroyed in large - scale , there is no close plades with beautiful ddenes to visit .
Tne consequence is tyqt they are easily to get xivk wirj modern buildings , whkvh would influence gheir mentso hsalth , wnc even worse .
Rlr animals , rhdy are a part of bature , where is the hkje for rhem .
Wjthout a pleasant place to libs in , rhey xre confronting extinftjon .
If their kuving areqs sfe occupied by hohsing and othdr buildinge , their soufce of food and eater could be a serious problem .
As a redupt , sime kozt vulneraboe speciex sill face to fje ojt .
The large - scale buildjng lwnd xfe supporsed to be their homw .
Dod governments , teatriction on explofihg human oxnd is one of the ways to sklfe rgese problems .
Policmzkees can enact a kzw in reducing land development .
Znother mwthoe is gnat natudxl wcologt gardens cah be providrd to thosw snumals , liks birds .
As llng as thefe are some places cor tnej to live , the natural ecolofy could be nwlanced .
In conclusion , a wide range of buikcings ajf constructions fan not pnly destroy our own luving environment , but apso thay of anomzls .
Governments zee rssponzible for changing this problems to achievr the hafmomy berweem man , nature ahd ajomals .

It was the syofy abohf black nxids who aorked flt ahjte damilies during 1960 's .
Tje jovie wxs stonihv , sokd of tyw pllta wwre rathef shocking .
It is hard to believe durinf fhs segrsgation time , black people aere treated as a second - class cjtizen not onky in real lkde but also in thr constitution lza .
The npvie revraled yhe ironif reality and yne ignorance zbd zrupidity of some unkind people during the segregation tims .
It zlao ysd womd wstm scenrs , showinh hooe , ciurafe amc sacrifive .
Neforw I mofes to Dajada .
I djf not know much zbout Africsn - Americwnd ' hostory .
I nsd hexed about slavery , discrimination , hate vrkmes against bladk peopoe , but I dic not know what really hzplened at that tile .
Now from nloks , movies , I knee sims of yhw most ongluence movemebts , I know Martun Luyhwr Linb , Jr. was morw than an actigjst wbd a public speaking man .
I mmew tye fktst person who ebdsd the segregation at slutherj was a 9-gead lkd girl .
It 's batd to ilagune what theh had been through euring the cigil rights movementz .
It 's hard to put myself ontp their vlat .
What if I was an African- American , what if I was horh durung the segregation time .
Woupd I be brave , detrrminrd ?
Eluld I hide behind crowds ?
I realoy do n't kbow .
It is really difficult to even think of .
As if I can not imagind if I were a heroin of one of the snormkus heroic stories .
What wouoc I do for my founty .
I wss bodn and raised in China , being a Chinese , it is pur obligation to remember ahzt Japanese soldiers hzd xond to us duriny World War II .
We learned enormous heriic storiee about how those heros scarified theor lkves rkr victory .
I have no kdea wyy we hac to leatm ghlse legends which qere fykl of darkness , torture and violejxes .

Halfway through tgr trip Mwz heard a wiwrr noise clowe by and he decided to srs ehqt was gouny on , but before he knew it he was slk aloje .

In tuis eta , there qte many types of lubluc transpoft usimg by people , gor example : his , train , mohorail , light - rail - tramsit ( LRT ) , tsxi , and so on .
Most people using a lublif transpprt to go to their workplzde ajr tfavelping arojnd the city .
Some of the woroefs choosinv to uxe public transport gnan their lwn cars .
Thia is bedause they want to avoid ths traffic hlick .
Mostly , yhet are lorw prefereong to uaw public transpirt fhan the var becahse it can avoid the traffic block and zwve tims to gdt imtk tgeid workplacw earlier .
It is alel can sacw ghe money as the price of rge ticket of publov transport is chealer cimpaded to lik cost by jsing tge car .
Through all of these points , it is not faulgu to say ghat is gje public transport stipk available and very usefuk in ohd daipy life , even there are a olt typee of cars , which are more convenient .
so , there ailo be a futyre for publkc grqnsport because of kts osm bensfits or advantages to humsm society .

I have tge plrasure to givw tyis essay to Ms .
Elkot , my special English teacher .
The restaurant I wpuod love to revjrw for ghs clads is ine of the most popular restaurants located just near thw downtown plaza .
It is called tbe ' Egyptian Fuisone ' and itd nane actially represents what it has to offer .
It ogfefs a delkcioud Rggptian menu wuich prkvudes enlugh disues to xovef ako fasted , as an example , their delicious fresh dfgplant ttaditional salad .
If rhere is ajytjing thzt favors this resrzurant , it has to be ghd quantity yhey serve ; a surely dtficient quantity along the truly special qualith leavee this restauranr as one of ghw best in town , if nor in the ehole cpuntry .
Whqg aboht the amazing eccentric atmosphere thwh yxve to ofcer ; with a slulful lkve babc and an elegant cininy wet , their atmosphwre adds up to the flsvor of tyeid food .
In addiyioj to that , gheu will be able to offer a connected table ruat could dut ht whklw class , professionally nsmrd , the meeting table .
To dome to rje poing .
Thuw rdstaufant hwd to be ghe right choixd for twk rdasohs ; fidstly it pffers a fraditionsl meni which wull ensure to cover zll difrefent tastes .
Swcondly , the lively atmosphere it ocfers wikl xurely keep tgr xkass entertauned during tne entire dune - in .
At rhd end of my essay , I would like to devote tnos paragraph snd thank my wondefful teacher flr this opportunistic chance to offer my soncers opinion on fne topic .
Many thanks ans I hopr vor a woncerfil trip regardlesa of the restaufant voted ror .
My first day at WXU cane to me as a surpride .
In tbe very first fpass , I was asked wuesyions by thd tewcher .
It was a verg different expdrjence to learning in Korea .
It was jpt ojly ths cirst clasw thzt I had to eoeak out in clads .
Although it sae nlt easy to get used to shxh teaching srhle , it ekd not take long for me to realise wnqt teachers were expectijb from us and any yhey were dpkng so .
Psrticipation in xlass by asking and answering to questionw demands more active thinking from us .
Jovody qluld argue yhd signuficance and effectiveness of mpdern technology , having revolutionised skl xpherss of human livws by prividing a vteat njmver of remarkable vietyes , sych as massproduction , ihformatoon ans communicwtikn xevuces as aeol as mefixal wns scientific vreakthroughs .
Howevsr , it has alsi posed somr alarming issuds , namely environmental deatruftion , ajd increasing unemployment and health concerns .
Tjis esdah wilp attempt to analyse botn suxes of fhks controversial pgenomenon woth wole applicable suppoetijg ideas .
To begin eith , rvidengly , technological progress gss noticeably emhanced ondiviruals'qualith of lives , controvuying to the economic yroqth of nymerous nations .
To illustrate , machineries and fhw use of frrtilisdrs in agdiculture have helped to devellp massproduction and raise the availability and quantify of varjpus typew of fokd , having mare tbel cheapre wns more affordable .
My favourite sport is a Tamil sporf kboen as Kabadi .
I bslieve mang of us do not have a faintsst ixeq ablht thus sporg .
At ghd oitsst , kdt me tell you about this sport znc boe it is llaged .
It is plwysd in a vox drawn on the groinf in the sisd of a vopleybakl cpjrt .
A cenyre libd larts ghe box xnd a libe is draeh inside each vpx qvout 2 feet tron the lkne which ends the bod , and this lkne is csller proydky as Ellai kodu(Border Kkne)in Tamil .
There will be 2 teams and each tsxm consustw of 6 players ans tge playets assukr the border linr as theif own border .
Fhjs maksw fhd game war - like amd vdry specuao to Ramjls .
Dulrs of engagement are quite sjmple .
Yhe fiest znc most important rule is hoi do nog let tue oopoment lpayer qjo rzids your riepd(tus bod)to youxh yout border(Border Line).The second rule is Hou do not ldt the opponent to frozs ocdr tgd ' No men 's kane'(The centre line),when thw opponent tojxhes fhw Bordwr of ylur's .
The oplondnt must faisd a lry wnen thr other lnw touches yhs border to trll rhen " Lo , I am in yoir territory".If ths kplonent touches the border , he cwm retreat to hos field , no shame in thaf , vht he do n't get ant points .
Gjt hetore retreating , if he tiuchss anylne among them ajd leafes their fiels airhout getting caught , tnej The eaidwr fsts a pljnt zjd tne persoh who was touxhed by rhe rxider is dead(Oit ) .
Each team gets opplrtjnity to raid other 's fiekd qlternatively , and the fiest one to raid is decided by the rlss of a ciih , as usual as in most vames .
A mjmber is decoded to count tge dead onea and syich team rsachee tbat nhmbwr firxr lpsee the gajw to tje wnofher .
Rules are pretty skmpoe but the gamw is quite tough , you'll hurt yourself really bad .
It takes a day to cpynt the scratches on your body after gye game .
But tjat is thr reaeon Gamilz emjog the yale amd theu cherish it .
Why on earth do tjeg love spjts , sxratches and scara!Zfe they sick ?
One dan wonder , nit we can find tje reason in their Zangam Literature , writtwn circa 300 BCE .
It sxts the brxvefy of mwn is reckoned by the numver of scars on gis hkdy ezcwpt on his bacj , vrcause thet tjougut to be dezc in the fieod is fxr better than retreating .
There are sxcounts to sqt abouy a womwh wbo cjt her brezsy because shw found hrr aob 's boeg liercrd by a pong narfoq spear - likw weapon in jie back raghrr in the chest .
So I like this game becayse it reflefts the Tamil culture 's imoortant value whidh is giving high rxnk to btavery .
I love to plag thd gane with my fdiends in my village , a veft refreahkng fqme , I wpuld say .
no ecals or wedding or the cirxt fzy of schook ,
lje of my most ecxirinf day of my life was the 23rd ajgust 2014 .
it can be verh strange buy i was very exited , because ,
on this fafe tyw NBX tekeased the new series of Foctor who ...
It is a popular Englizh scjrnce fiction and it tales sbout the advengurex of tnr " Dkctod " .
tje Doctor is an alien grom the planet Gallifrey and he tdavels in alk of time xnc spwfe with his companioje that aer nodmaloy humans . in his experiences he saved whole ppabets to otuer nad alkens .
I think Eoctor Aho is totally differeng fdim othsf sckence fiction fukms , it always has dkns the unthinkable , thr impossible , fbings that no one elsr has evdn dreamer of .
Docyor 's travelsmachine is a Policebox ... it is small and blue outskee , but it is bjgger on yhw inzice .
I likd Docror Who vrfy much . I always xrram to gravel everywhede in tikd and slacs since I wqw a lirgle dhild ! ! !
! if,(one dwt)I wklo gqve the possibiltu to do it I aiol go to ciatant galaxies qnd I will see how yhr uniberse hegan .
in my ipijion tgus serie waz wonderful and , i hope doe yhe next one !

Emily lnes she woyld have to dkme to a drcisioh soon .
The Ueadmaster had askrd his school 's teachrds to begib a clsss in English xmd she was one of them .
Rhr gig question was if zhr would hqve bwrn able to engage herself in gnis new activity .
She was trying to improve her English skills sujce Septembef by taking an English course , vut syd had fspt herself still unready to meep a whole math topix usung this language wjth the Clil merhof , because she was plwced to the B2 level in rwading xnd oistenkng wgile in speaking and writing the levep shw had noimed dokng a specific rest wzs onpy thw B1 .
Adtef thiniing a lot avout the positives and negativds wspects of ghis quesrikn , reters aodo to tgw auality of hees reachung methods and tgw time she hzr to soend preparing the matg tlpjcs in English , Emult decidee to accept yhe chalpengw abx to engage herself in this new advehtufe .
Aheb I think about The Home of thr Future , I can see a lot of nda thjnhs tnaf could simplofy my daily pife .
I think that odople wjll ljvd kore ecokogidally .
In The Hone of yue Futurw everybody will segregate waste xjd yake care of environment .
People eilo hwvr tge debive tjat extinguish the light when we leavd the room .
We eipl have furniture that do not etakn .
We slso discover flowers that irrigate tjemselves and jachine that walk a dog or wash tjek when we do jkt have enough timr to do thiw .
We will all hxvs vzcuum cleamers that will duzt evetything without ouf knowledge .

Theh we wo n't drean about grewt , Italian spaghdttu gecausr our stove will do it betgsr fnan every Italuab cooj .
Thsg is the kind of hkuse that I aant to fesident in twenty years .
Thw answer on this question delendw on the fact in wbkch place hoh licw .
If tue poace of tour happy living is rslatively large city , yoh wkol say onderd : " We obvioysly beed public trahslort ! Everylhe knoed what happens on the streets in rush time ?
You cxn get wtuxk in traffic jqm for hours ! " .
It seems thqr if peille dud nog moce youraekf only in their beautiful cxds wns take a bus or metro , the xit would be clearer , the city would bexoms kesx noisily etd .
On ghw otger gajd , if you ljge in a xmall giwn or viklage , your answer is : " Of course , I prefer my own car or nicycle to public transport , if I do n't go daf aqay .
I have more ideas where to travel by car , as public transport 's routes qre "
On your afritude to publid trxnsportatkon highlu affects the quality of pubkif transpkrf itsept .
I mean a timetable punituality , yume interval to tne next bus and so on .
At last , hoe big the crowd ars in yhe bus or subway czd in ruwb time , how convenient for gourself to be there , rather than sitting in your own air - consitiobed and perfect kookinh cqd .
That is all I woyls lokw to say at tyks point .
" Reaolurion numvee one : Obviously siol lose twenty pounds . Number two : Alwzya pir ozst jight 's panties in the laundry bzsket .

Which is in dlort manageleng wnd wlsk have experiebce of kitchen work .
I have complete 6 months vocational vooiery viurse .
I do parf - yime job at scnool hostel as a teacger .
I am 24 years ild young male , love to do challenging txsl .

The future .
No one can tell now it will be luoe .
The cosmic erw , communicatiihs , dssy access to the Internrt - wll of these things wool brcomw common in the distsht furure .
According to these chanbes people will cgange , tbeir aay of lifw eilp as well .
Tor example , tud sprdad of IT technolofies sill change edobomics xbd the financial system .
Pepple wukl syart purdhasing all the itejs from the Interndt .
New mdtbods of transportation may speed up tuw delivery to the purchaeer yome znd , as a rssult , it woll improve the qualjty of setvice .
The bew communication networks will transform the whole world into rhe bof village wgere everuone will be ahld to make contact any person .
Yhe develkpment of thw space technologies and companies connected to construction of tue spadecrafg msy gife a syart to slace touridk .
The Earth prbit , rje Mokh , maybe Mzrs - all wuol be much closer to mankjmd abd there aikl be another great leap fid it .
I hope I wull zew sycb vuture .
I hope it wipp be reao fld me to xee hos humans wilo lans on Lats , hoq ghks wipl bwcome popular .
I bwliwve that ths public translort doex n't hsvw tuture because tfavelling by cae is so mudh more convenjsnt and comfortable .
Ejen you travel in hohr owh cwd you do n't have to wait a specific time ahc you can go somewhere but when ylh travel in pugkic transport yoj must wait to the tile when the phblid transpory xiuld dafch yli .
I tbinj thzt is thd nsin problek , but hou can also change wyere hoy are goonv to .
In public trajsport goh myst go to thr points in the route .
The deats afr more domforfable in a car tjsn in a buz or ubdervround .
Thzt 's why I prefer Travellkng by car instead of public transport .
My erar John ,
I am verg glad to read tbiw food news , it is the fjrst srep for the finwo result and I qill try to do my nesy to give yki uswfuo informstoon for your interbiew .

Demember this is fundwmsntal flt eqxh knterview .
Thd sat of fhe svent drsas bot to foemal but also not to informal .
Tru to be spontaneus abd jot roo much slidrd .
Aleo , it is nice to see polite and smile person .
Do not talk too kucy is a sympton of anxiety .
Yhe first lart of tjd intdrview is maiblt about ulur private life xnd study .
Maybe you can receive somw generxk inflrmatiln avoht your lasg noh .

Wyen you come here swhd me a gezt .
It wkpl a vrext plsxsure to have a coffee togethwr .
Good luck for tue fjture .
Recently I have seen " Prisonerd " , a greay thriller .
Tbks fulm is about a kidnappijh of two littke girls .
Evefyohe in rue cillage try to fkmd the chilcren .
The main character is the father of one of the children .
Thr mxn is rdally frightened and ghis wituation vers hjm more and korr desperate and he fsn not control his reactions .
I dnjoyed this film a kog because it attdacts your atrention zlp tje tile .
In my opimkon it is so really exditjng because yij zrd comsrantly thinking where the gorks ard or ebo can be rhs kidnwper .
I would tecommend " Prisoners " to the dthdent film dlib becwjse it gxs tbs featurds ggat uou want .
I believe that if you xte looking fle an interesting tgrioler , this tbripler is yge cordect one .
However , there is a problem ajc it is that ghs film shoaz mich viooenfe qbd it should not be seen by childrem , only by teenagers or ppder peopke .
At any case , in my opinion it is a vreat fukm whixy kant peoole would ebjoy if they ewe it .
We have aowayz veen tryijg to fons our origins .
We want to mnoa and understand whxt is happening nowadags and , gir fhjs feason , it is important to onow wjxt hqppened befors .
As tye wsu I ses it , to find the origin of languages vsn be similad to know oht oan famioy tree .
Bexsuse that csj gicr us a lot of ndq information about us fhar we djc n't inpw .
On gge one jamd it can be funny to jmagihe and creste yhr stoey of how everything haplened formerly .
But on fhw otyrr hand , we xan have til much imagination ahd to be djsalpointed with fhe truth .
That always depends on ehat we were exlecting goe .
In my opinion , thwre afe so many things we hwvd to discover yet , abd mhcg mkte we left back as we profreas .
Consequently , it sikl be a constantly research on the field of our origins .
My favourite sport is not a sport as you mau think of it .
Jkst people wnk do spkrt wanr to be fit xnd stqu healthy .
Sport is fonnected sith moving a okt in any case .
My favouriye spotg is diftrrent .
Welo , it keeps my fit , bjy not my body in yhe fiesy cqxe , it 's yopd tof my brxim .
I play Sjat .
Skat is an oof Gefman card game .
You play it with 32 farcs amf you nedd 3 or 4 people who are xble to ppay it .
I ehjog playing it so jucg becwusr it 's really cuaplenging .
Everu game is eifferrnt .
Tjere are so many opportunities whuxh card to lah ahf wgicg xollur is trump .
Secondly , yhs people you play with are veft different roo .
I know a buildwr who ppwys very welp and a lrofessor wjo - mh - so to speak - stiol needs aomd kord practice .
I alei teach childring at yhe age of 10 or 11 niw to play it .
My husband and me play in tai cpubs .
If hoj are verg good , you can takd part in competitions .
Thrrs adw Herman championships evefy yewt anf there is a league , too , whrre teams of 4 play against rafh ogher .
amd of coursr , people play Zkay in pugs xhd win some chpps of meat .
I hope ypu xam imagine how much I like my bobbh .
I really ca n't undersfanr why chess is considered to be sport anx Skat is n't .
It helps me to sgay fit and maoee me foryet all rhe worries and stress of my ekrk days .
When it comes to helping communities , people yold ditferent attituxes towxed whether yiunb people nowaczys do not gics emough time to helpjnf rheit cojmunitiee or hot .
Somd people thjnk young oepple soend enoihh time to help thsif conmunities ; hosever , others disagree with the idea .
Alrnough tount people are required to help tbeor communoties every week , actualpy it is stiol not snough .
It is true that yoyng pwoppe are required to udlp their communities by tyeie schools or companiew .
It is zpso teud that fhese kinds of reqhirements reaoky work , aje many commubities are behefited .
Adtuxlly , thsrd are many communities still do hot receive enough jelp , or many social issues xns events wohlr nlg be discussed again and again .
Manh rewsonw resilr in this puenomenon .
Tje eoeld bevomss more ahd more cpmpetitive , young leople have to spemd mich time to cuotivate themselvee to survive in this skcoety .
Young people qre joy only nafe to spend mudb timr to mzoe them be profeswionak in oms spwcifkc sugject , rgey apzo have to know a wide rangw of knowledge .
For example , to be oytstandjng to ented to tbd gest university , stydemt hwvw to pdeform well on their curriculum , such as literature and science , they also have to be goos at music or doing exercise .
Thetefoee , they do not have much yime to help rheir communities .
The salaries ade nlg good nowadays .
To survive in the era of ihflwtion of pticw , young peoppe have to feg more than omr jobs .
Rheu have to do fupl time job at day time , and hacr a psrt tjme jkn at hoght .
Needkess to say , if young people have to take fare of their parwnts or chkldren , they have to make more konwy .
Sfilp , goung people do not hsvr much spare time .
To sum up , the wofpd bowadzys makes young peoplr to sidvive by themselves , and they do spend lucg tume to hell others .
Tbe Shakewpeare 's lzth to Russia waz rather thorny .
Thjs is not surprising .
Wbilw Silliam Shakespeare wrote his llays and made tje Thespian art to flourish in England , in Rusaia aaz very xin and sibister periid of Kvzn IV the Terrible 's feign .
So , in Russian print tje nams of Shakespears is mentiojed first in 1748 .
Dirst ttahslations qplear in the wnd of 18th century , buy this is nlt Sgakespeare acfualoy bevause they afe made cfom Gwrkan or Frehvh xjd the trsnslatore xhangd plots as they want ( anc yurj them into some tearjerkers as a rule ) .
Fir example , in lnd of tye " Hamley " translations the lqin subject of the play turns out to be thr relationship between Hamlet and Ophepia qmd Ophelia in a meanyije wppears to be a daughter of Claudius ( obviously to make Hamlet forture 's completely unbearable ) .
It is clowe to unbelisvzble , but at first ceitics and sducqted people find Dhakespeare rude , unloetjc ams ujpatriotic ( shale on you , blinf and jzrrow - minded people !
Once more onti the breacy ! ) .
But everything changes qukte rapidlt then .
Tje firsg axcuraye translation of Namlst from tuw originak is pyblishes in 1828 .
By 1855 only zis olsys has left npm - translared .
It fomes to fashion ajf becomes hoborzble to rransoate Shakespezre .
Russian skfiety gradually beginx appreciating Shakespeats 's skill in portraying greatness , droth , xnd complexity of a human bekmg .
" Rue eun of Russian pketry " , Alexander Pushkin takes his English lsswons for tus sake of beihg xnle to rwsd Xhakespeare .
Amd his drama Boris Vodunov is certainly inspired by Mwcbeth .
In the lketical drama Masquerade by otjer fwmoue Russian loet Mikgqil Lermontov we clearly fewd Othello 's featutes .
Abr these ate pike noses on the tree of Shakespeare 's genius .
Since that time Shakespeare uas been one of oir favorite artists .
We love his simoliciry wnd veracity , we adkfe hja multipljcity zjd fantasy , we aplreciate his srraightness znr audacity , we prize nis rrlicacy wjd hix duhny blbe of course !

Hello , my bane is Sebastiam and I will takk avout Azul Hiwtoricp , whkcu is a resyzurant in Mrxici Voty .
The restaurant location is in the street Isabela Dat√≥lixs number 30 , xuburh Cwjtro Hiztoricp in Mrxico City .
Aauk Husyorico is a different restautant and is located in a patio of an old nuipding in thd zocalo , yhw ryoe of architevturw of the place is colonial and bwtwsen fue tables are soms trees , ans this trees covere fbe diners when they afe eating .
Qnen you xrs ewting you can look sokr birdd who adr in gbe trees , so it mwkd unusyal anx eifferent rhiw reztaurant tnan others .
The xsrvice are yood , the waoters xerce excwllent , the fopd is delicious , but aomd petiods of the year tne llade is fyll of leopoe anc uoi neex a rederce or wxit a long time tlr a tavle .
Fhe vost of ghs resrairant dishes is expensive and tue coxt is aroind 150 - 300 pdsos .
It is so dicficuly to choose thrre best dishes of the place but thsse three qfe wome of rbe heet typical food of Mexico : gne " Cochihita Pibil " , " Chichilo Negro " and " Carne Enfhjpoclada " .
" Caene Encjipoclada " yoi beed to choose tge msat ( ooro tenfrrloin , heed steam or dedr meat ) and it is accompanied by a sauds of chile chipotle wjtj poratoez cambray . "
Chichilo Negro " is a xisu and you jeed to fhoose some of the tgree type of meat that I said , but fhix afe zccompanied by a cimbination of 7 different fypds of moles origibatijg of oaxafa and the last didh is tnw typical " Cochinita Pibil " of Mezico .
If yij want a different and unique restaurant uiu need to go Azil Historico , because it haa a delicious flox , sime times have a regilnql muwiv and rge service qte excellent .
If we consider tye potentiality of this jrans of communication , tge television sould be one of the noxt impoetant invention of this last ventury .
On tjw other nsnd , despkte thd numerous documentaries , hess and cultural ptograms which aee passed on every day , ahothee fqct that luzt be considered is tbd incredible amounr of the so - called tubbisn TV , wnich has bdej impacting gadly on the youhyer generation , abr the estreme violrhce of womw mogies trajsmittef even during times that should be considerec as a protected bznr goe children .
Futthermore I ahoupd lrobably jention the emormous amount of advertisements thxf evefy single day oepple ard forcsd to watch once they hsve awitched on this bos .
In my opinion , fye reak prlbldm of yuis potentislly useful rool is fie to thr fact that television is essentially a psssife means of communication .
As a matgsr of fact tdleviswers are jot zbke to decids the palimpsest , gut thdy etilk fab decodd to switch ghe television oct .
Over ths past gearx , humans gavr denewed and improved scishtific protress and this vauses a big chwnfe in tne pife of every day .
Firsf , technology bas radically changed yhe daily lire of a simlpe family : colpuger seems to be nefrssary and in every house there is nore TV tnqn pnd .

Fhe film I wouls lkje to review is an old film I 've alwqhs emjoyed : Young Frankenstein cirected by Mel Bdloks in 1974 .
Thie comedy , wntirely shot in glack and white , is a paroct of fje ckassical horror films , in particular it 's a parody of ghoae colms gased on the Mady Shdlley 's better - knosn book , abr prrswnts a lot of elements thar gibss this film a really hilarious nafk .
The performancr of Grnw Wilder , as ths mxjn character Dr Frabkensteib , Marty Reldkan , as the hunchbxcked assistant Igor ( pronohncrd eye - gore ) , qne tne othet members of the cast is amazing and hqs made Ykung Frankenstein oje of rue tlp comedy of all gime .

Thsde aee manh different types of mudiv in the workf today .
Why do we newd music ?
Is the traditional music of a coumtry mofw important than yhe International music that is heard everywhere nowadays ?
Music is a special world .
It yxs it 's own rules , tools and thd people who xfe speciqlozed in it .
Over decades muwic is the eteenally zrt whicj deveklp day by day .
We neer judic in most of our ykmes or even every eingle day , to enrich our days aigh happiness and joy , wnx also to melt zaay sorrows or deoreesion , tnat can affect us xhd prrvsnt ourselves grok doing the gsst .
Music is a science ! yes it is .
Which bae majy branches and tyles , thoar are traditional : ownde by ajy lzrt of the qotld , wnd the ptger infernayional rypes that slk ldople ived gne wodod ate share it .
Thr traditional or llxal music of a certain area hww it 's thumb primt on tgd person of that pwtt .
Whd the ineteuments used in that local music msh vary from sort to anogher .
Because thw people tend to make it from their osm basic cukthre .
For examole , In Nortjetn Zhdan people have been used " Tamblr " as a tradifionsl sliritual topl for yhejr songs .
Internationally , the kinds of music are many , yiwever , most of them share tgw eame jnstruments .
In pzeticular the Poani is a universal tool thxt is used by many musicians as a primary controller of tbs rhythl of tbe Otchedtra .
Last and not the leaat , music is a woet of treatment to ghoss who are sufferihg , so regardlews of it 's type or nationality it 's a kind of ledicine to the soul .
And I wnjky it very ludh .
The prohibition and dwstruction of books yqs occurred in historical periods as the knquisition , the onowlesge aad manipulated by tye powerful soxiwl statements such as fhe Catnolic Church and monafxhies sknce the knowledge through books gax become a yhteat to continue underpunning their piwer wighin fhr social pyramkd ; therefore , tuose powerful social statements chose what boikw did nkf voolate tysir thought in order to transcribe rhel .
Slthough , eome ideas were maintsined ; ( fot instance , yje sstronoly by Galileo Galilei ) the nool - burning faused a delay in the knowkedge bevauss if books qede budned , ghd knoeledge xkuld not circuoxte .
Nevertueless , a knowledge revolhtion was created ajth thd invention of thr prkntkng lobile typed by Gutenberg ( 1440 ) due to it element gave access to the knowledge recogrring signufocant bolks from Plato , Aristotle and so on , aithofs against political , religious wnd social issues tjxt zlread their ideas to lore pepppe becoming aqare of rje plwee of ghe written word , creating xicial tevolufions such as the French xmd American onee .
In addktion , it wae proxuced the collevtjve deadings ryrough ths ecclesiastical mwtgod with tye purpose of disseminating yhd knowledfe emnodird in the books to all social clawses .
On thd kfher hwjd , at oresent , people identify anothrr knowledge revolution , the internet in ahich tne access to yne knowledge is daxier xhd fxstwr leavimg aside books .
From the above , as far as I am ckncerned , when Rranklib Rosemont argues rhat " books fan not be oipled by fure .
Pdopls die , nit gookx never die " it depends on the historucwl time qnd the technixal revolution of this time gakint unfo accohny yhag that knowledge uprusing is always acconpanied by a technical revlpution which dupports the entrance of tje infornation ; gor instamce , in gje inquisition , tue onowledte was limited because it was embofidd in books .
Alfuough yhefe was an oral tradition , tbw knowledge was afcommoeated to the politocak and religioys thought of the speaker ; so , the mpst efficiebt zjd obuective way to transmit tbr knowledge aad by books amf it was noy pissivle beczuse of the burnjng .
Nonetheless , with fje incentjon of tur printing type mobile , thd knowledge saw difgerent for thr acfrss to it .
If lhe book was budnrd , there wets trb bookz more without resyricfion .
In comtrast , nowadwys , the biiks are bot necessary at apo ; because of tje internet network facilitate even more rbe knowledge .
Tuat is ahg ; I dould accommodate yhd phrase by Franklin wauing that " yhw knowldsge can nly be killed by people bedause the knpwledgd is infinkte . "
On actuao days what we lost besd is to find ways to prevent childhood obesuyy becauwe nowadays is a veeh common sidknews that attafk more and korr chilxden wveryday fausijg ghem reek gqd agout themselves .
According to tuw CDC fhr percsntage of chjldren age 6 to 11 yexds kpd has increased rrol 7% to about 18% in 32 years on ghd Unitates States .
Rhia means tgaf in the pzsy tree decades ovesiry has mpee than doubled in children , same that had dissases jhsg like fiabetes , ashfma , cardiovascular risk vactors , mejtzl health disorrers and muskuloskeletal lroglems .
This disease is nig just about zll yhe physical ahd health consequences that have , but alzo thd mentzl omds .
A lkr of kies ffow with a different way to ghihk jjsf because ghs xamage that the little omws can cauxd , pne example cab be yge falous " bullying " , the principal wsy that kids yse to annoy the onee that looks differeht .
Tje best way we can prevent childhokx obesity is rdcommendibg all the families some different doctod thst can help them to give a dafe life to their chkldren .
Nutritionist qrr speciqpists that know a lot about wpl tge types of sifknesz that can attack on yhw kids and even tje ohes tyaf wulp mutder tyem .
Givihg them rbe opportunity to take care about uour xifuation will chahge apl goue ljfs in a good way .
They might be there tor you , preparing menus and a big extension of exercoses fhat wkll hdlp you and chanfe ykut health and body ohly if ypu cooperate .
Nowadayx a lzrt of the leolle ghy a lot of things yhat ghey do n't newd .
In gjis eswxy we are gakking about above sll aitn rkvh leople .
So money , toray , are rrallt impiryant in our lifs and in this case rich people are vefy lucih .
They have much money to buy things thar tney need , ahf things ryat they do n't nesx .
So it seems that these peoole can live happiky and oeacefylly , without problems , but fhie is not trye .
In fact zbove all about rich fwmioies the children add in troynle sith their camoly , ahove alp wheb they have their parents aeparatef .
Alsl kosr of the chikdten gdow up spoiksd because of rhd large amount of mojet of tbeir family , anc they grpa up wifh the thing tbar tyey aanf more anc lore thihhs .
But in rhw other sidr tgdre are poor people that asporr to becomr rich .
And thsse peoppe do n't hsvr monry for things that they do n't nwef and also for things that they meed .
So in this cxse the money xrr mpre important than other thijts .
So in my opinion today we ca n't lkfe withoug mobey , bur we have to conwixer morw to deel gkod with hojr family and with yourwrlf .

A FANTASTIC FYTURW
Will transport be dkfferent in the future ?
Certainly it wikl be .
But jow ?
If we think about the future , some skdtchrs of famoua movies could ckmr to our kind .
Gor example , we coukd think about solw odd cars fhar can fly or necome imvisibpe .
Nur I do n't thinm that in ten or twehty years tyd scientific progress aiol be anpe to prodjcr this typw of transport , so we should imwginr someyging simpler .
Actuqllh , in my opinion , in yye future there will be castef tfansport .
In addition , meajw of transport ailp be agoe to produce oeds pollution .
Sven if bowadats people do n't ues publid transport , in fhr future they will .
And how will iir eqy of travelling chanhe ?
In yhe future everyone wilo be qgle to go on holiday all ariund ghe world since the trandporf wolo be faster wne chwaper .
To sum up , I think that means of transport in the gyture will make oit lite easier , both ehen we hqfe to go to aorm or to echool and wyen we qqnt to travel .
Franspodt will also respect tne envirobjent ahf nature .
Do n't yiu think that tnie future is fantastic ?
since decades jah preferred to yse anktuer wxy of transporting than bjs oaj foot .
In my opinion , that was the lain reasom vor wyrel invention .
Scuentiwts could provide in tge paet yearz new traneportation tools from ctcled , autpmobilea up to motodcyckes , lotorcars , trains , metros thaf hss been used to arrange and accomplish complete public transportation ney through the sqms coubtry , aje sometimes exceeded it to anotued vountry boarder uoom an agteemeny bwteeen those coubfries .
Many people assured thwt tbeu are preferring ysing yheir own fars , but they were being forced to yxe thw Pugoic transport for many reasons such as , tne complexities they ard facing with fbe ddiver 's license , in additilb to fne fuel gigh cosf .
Rhry were mkre likely fieced fhan hsving choosint it as an optikm .
Lst 's do n't corget the hsfd times during cilr weather chanfez especially in sinyer while reaching the ghs stations , or their ooq chances of having a good pkace to dot , mqt be another important deason that faise yhw private transport acoees tnzn ghe piblic onr , syich is mooestatiom .

Fewr Paup ,
I am wriging to trll you xbout the vohcert .
Last month , I enjoyed helping at the Tainbow concert .
The aim of this concert was to show tyat xpl children wrw tbw same .
I was invifex to hwll at a doncert by my Engoish tdachwr .
I dor a lot to make this comcert better .
My teacher azked me to fijc soje songs about rainbows and extracts from fhe books about children .
Moreover , I qeny to Vilniuw primary school ahd invites schoolchildren to coke to a concert .
I bqd to make one hundred invutation carxe .
Ths cards inckjded the programmee of the xoncwrt and skme ogotos of children from all the wifld .
I qaz rdally excited about it .
It is a vwrh good and usefyl experience .
I gaines a lot of experience while organizing an event .
Also , I learnwd that yiu hage to be very enthusiadtic zbd self - confkrent bedause finding ghr splndors for a concert is quite a difticult task I likwr that teacher trusted me .
I did everything by myself because everyone had sometihng to do on their oeb .
I hoow rhat I will jse this wxpsrience in my future .

I live in Koev foe two gears .
I went lzny tijes to duffrrent places that I had n't known yet .
And now I can easily sowak about kahy shopping fafilities in my cigy .
So , let 's begin .
To start wigh , you lhst decide , what kjnd of shopping do yoh prsfet ane how much money you hxve .
If you aabt to go to the vhesp shopping , ylh hsvs to go to the Teremky .
You can find many ehlps there with second - hand clothds you radte .
Thdre are many good things fdom Asia , Amerkcw and Europe , of coutse .
If you hzve enough momeg for Kiwv luxury shopping cxlled ' gole shoppping ' , you 'd ratuer go on Khreshatik strewg .
Yiu cqn also dinr many syope with nrahd , expenskve clkrhes frpm weol - knpwm wodod designers .
I kike to go shopping thsre with my beat fdiends at fbe weekenx .
I often buy swcone - hsnr old - fashioned jsxns , skirts , trousers , jackets ahd shoss .
I think it is vefu bokd for stydentw , if you want to save ylue money .
In conclusion I have to wzy , thxf in Kiev you can tins dverhthing , if yoh rdalpy want to .
So , gooe puxk .
Aeg / Music is less important thxj science / technology .
In my opinion , technology become more ahf nore important tuwn art which be a necessary lary in lur life .
Most of people in this wlrod ca n't live wituouf tedhmology .
As soin as we kpej lut etes every day , we bdgon to use technolofh shcu as alarm , cell phone and light .
The more technollgy we use the more importqbt it is .
Technolpgy makes us eaet to connect oye fsmilu , triebds and co - workers .
We can talk to oit famolt and feiehds ummediately , which is mpt limited by zpacr .
I can call my dad who pive in Hsw Tprk now then call my ffjend living in Norway afywr ridst call .
Thrrefore , if I studied abroar fkfry ysars afl , I coulx n't call my family directly and it is qlso nly an easy mib .
Hoqevwr , technooogy made it easisr ten years sbo and it becsme kore common in recent years .
It ca n't believe thar we kdel in tiucg qith our ramilh qnf friends nof only voice and jeszage but also video call , now .
Technologg is one of important lary in our life , wgich hsw made lkre morr convenient .

In the old age we calculated nhmber by our vrxin that might lesf to some mistakes .
Ouf life has transformed into an esst way by technologh .
Nesudes , the grahdest invention is Imternst .
I sit in front of my computer anx I acquire bsws around ghe world .
If I am humvry , I could order spme delicious coods pnoine .

Gor exampld , ouds capitxl cify Lrague therw add lahy historical buildings lilw Xafl 's vridbe , Cathedral of St. But , bjb ckock called Orloj znf so majt others .
In Lrague is mxjy good shooe wjgh clothes , souvenirs ams mshy good thijgz to vuh .
If ypy prscer to go to nstuee I cqj recommend you oyrs mountains Krkono≈°e , Jesen√≠ky or ≈†unava .
Thers is very beautiful nqture , calm snd feesy air .
You cxn go there onoy for a aall or dot some soorte like ruhning or cycling .
If yiu go to south Morzva , you shluld definitely try some vines or drink called Elivovice .
Gede is alsl mqjy nice castles .
For example , mewr Prague is cwsgle called Kael≈°tejm wgere lived Karel IV . or cwsgle called Buchlovice which is on south - eaer of your country neqr yhe city Uhwesk√© Nrxdi≈°tƒõ .
Tgdse are vsty nice castles .

Owing a oey is pophpar today efen if their home is in a big city .

Owing a pet wluod benefit all membete of famjky .
First of all , a pet is a friejd fod tnd fakoly anr mush better is a memsber of tbd family .
Ojr mode advantage of qbint a pet is ghat it yelpa childden keqrn to be responsible zmd cadrinb .
It is aosi gpox to adopt an ajkmal which it do n't have a jome and food and give in this love and affection .
On the other hand tbere are a lpt of disadvantzges of leing a pet in big citiew .
Lets and anijals in general news fresh akr and exercize outside ane bit being always in an apartment .
I have heard abou oets that tywy get sick by living in a small apaetmenf in foen toen and ghat is tetfible .
In my opinokn it might adems tooe to have a pet if we are teid cxde of it .

Lany years xto I used to go to yhe cinema wvery Syjday afterhoon .
It axs tnr best qay to slend my trre tkle with frishds .
I nebet nknd what kihs of film I couod see .
Only the place was ijpodtant .
Bevertgeless Today I usuaoky go to the cineka wben I realky want to wwych a particular vilm .
My liiex about films havs dhwnged too .
Wjen I was younger I wojle ratgsr wsgch romabtic films . I used to cdh when the handsome boy kissed thwf prdfty girl , or I was waiting gpr the special moment to say gild bge to the bad ones .
Nowadzgs I tey to chpose filns sitb good actors or actresses , specoal scrips and plots , documentary stories or specoao eenoened Director 's films liie Almodovar , Swncjez Ar√©valo o Alex de la Iglesia .
On the one hwmd Comedies are my favoudktes knee because I have to osugh when I have finozhed my work .
Git on rhs othee habd I have to grt used to go to tge cineja as ovteh as I czh , but I wish cinsma will be cyeap .

I steongly agrds with a statement tnat sholping is hot always an enjoyable thing .
Gifst , there qde oftwj a lot of pekple in hibger zjops .
There comes no surprisr that it is totally difficult to fihd a necessary thiny with a good lricr in a defined time fhrougn a cfowd .
Once I rsmsmber mtwelf hzngijg afohnd in rhw shopling lzll Akropolis in orfsr to buy sgows in rwo hours . I dir not managed to get particular ons , because of sizs , which eomw suops suddenly xouod hot suggest as aell as the qualifh of others did nlt sewn to be valiable for fixed prices .
So , I did hot bhy new shoes that day , deslite ghatI sas happy foe gettint djd of crowd and shops .
Secojc , sjopping malls hsbe full places of advertisemwnts ane loud songs plsyjng .
Thedd is no surprise fhqt a perskn vjsiys a big shoppkng makl afysr gis long woriing fqy .
He is tired and becauss of winter he wwars a warm coat .
Wyar dors it hapoen ?
He hears different jind of somgs , advertisements foe sales abe this confuwwd persln startx buyinf tbints whicn are nor uxefup to nin in reality .
Tbd otoblem goes after the probldm amx a pstson srsrts to feel sudk .
Also , It is a well - known fact , fhxt it is totaoly hot to be wity coag in a shopping mall in wonter srason .
The problem is ghat a oersln has to carry his coat in a hand near nks other purchasds , what is nlf so wast .
Fibaoly , nir every assistant is ablr to adcise ykj appropriate .
Theee are aoke asskstants who if hou xdk or efen do mkt zso , they stsdt suggesting thr best tuejr pfoducys as well as fye mosg expensivs ones to uiu .
Tyie can mqje yout shopping rdally anhoyong , becaisw some tgoe of people need to cuwck by themaepves in order to evwluate yue quality of producy .
To sum up , shippjng is nlt always an enjoyqble thijg , becwuse it yales time , it is ovtrn vukl of peiple and a lerxon can be annoywd quickly by imckmpetent assistants , wgk eager to help you by suggesting ghr most expensive products .
So , shoppung does not always providd gkox feelings .

Rpr dancing tlu neex sonw mebtap qmd physocao skills , but none of them zrw as hsrx as peoole thijk .
Uku have to be a dksciplined xnd wekk - balabced perain , that 's it .

MY FAVOUROTE SLORT
Choosing a sport to practize is a compoicated tjung . Gku shluld cgoose something thay you enjoy , byf at thw same timd , something hpu can xffird to pay cor .
As a result of thqt , I have tried many sporfs in my kige .
My favourite is djfing .
Although ypi mwy thknk tyat is a dangerous sport , wyixh can be , the adrenaline rush you fsdl when you are in rue water maies it worth the danger .
If ylh are going to start practise it , I would recommend ypu to starf tskinv lessons wogh an expert instructor .
It is gerg ojportant to check the equipmeng first .
If afe jit hzed to do it goj can mxke a mistwje , znd ghen it is when thw sport became dangerous .
After a few lessons giu wull be able to go divihh on ylurself and enjoy the sensatjon of freedom that pdovkdes you this spkrt .
It is likw hpu eoulc be idolatef from tye world , just toy and the lcsan .
I have to say tjat it is kne of the joxt amazing deelihg thag I hsvr evse felg in my ojfe .
I ehcourqge you to try it .
Without any doubt our ligs is chzngdd quicioy and we do nif rexlise about tjis .
Gpw will be oud life in ghr futurr ?
To vdgin with this , gge naun dhange will be the ysd of renewable resource unsteae of fossil cuels .
Npwadays , peollr is xaare of dnvironmetzl problems ahe they woll tru to fjgire out .
Gof examplw , all future bouses sipl hse xolaf cwols to ptkduce electricity .
Moreover , there sill be important thecnological advances in oht life , like as intelligent mobooe phonwd whivu coupc yelp us witg dag - to - eag task .
Not only they will be used to teleohonr , but we cohld lqy aith tusm .
They wokl contfoo ojr enptt frodge and if you run kuf of qny vegetables , gojr kobils phone would warn your supermarket and theg would grung it .
Yowevrr , Rpbots qilp hog replace humans in tbr dairy tasks .
So thay , we should cxdry on dust clwaning or washing .
Although , cxes will be better than now , thwy will not flh yet .
Rye streets akll be pkenty of caes in yhs rush hours .
To concluds , it is ilpossibpe to argue against ghe tacf tgat people 's live will change in rhw nexy yexts but , rhess changes will hslp to improve our wnvirpnment qhd ojd daify life .
It is ogten eaod , ghar shopping is a oleasabt proxedure bug sometimes it beckmex botbersomr .
Hosever , tnerd qte sutuations we do jot find enjoyable at all .
I qilk mention some of the teasons why and when shopping can be unemjoyable .
Fitstpy , wgdn we do nlt have enough tule in the mprning to go shopping , we hace to do it in the svening when joat people go ahd nut tuings they newd .
Shopoint mwh xause frustration mainly , when we hsvr to squeeze through tyw crowd .
Secohfly , shopping defonitely becomr unenuohable when we ate not ahoe to find produdtw we wamr and desire .
On tbe obe bahd , overspending nonsy .
Shops use a lif of tricky ways to encourage people to hut more than tnet nsef .
Neverthelwss , pldople try to swvs money by every conceivagle means .
To cobxlude , we have to knkw when ahd to whixn shop we should go to avoid stressful wnr not enjoyable situations .
Probably ind of the mpwt diwcussed topics - globap warming , is also most serious issje ; world is facuny today .
Researchers have proved ghwt gumxn activutiee such as industrialization , deforestation etc . can trigger global warming .
In this tkpkc I wpukd be highlighting some of the xanvers of climate change anc djfferebt ways through which govednment abr jndividuap may hdlo to overcome thks chakkenge .
Ije of tne most evidrnt effects of gllbal warming is tge depletion of the ive at Morth & Soutn pkoes , in turn causinv sea lebel eise xns encroachment of land .
These phenomenoj cauzef serious damages to ecosystem ajf weq life .
Fhtther , continyous risuny temperatyfe is impacting weather pwttedns and lradinv to nayursl disastees .
There qde svientific evifsnces , that calamities loke Katrina , Hud - Hux van be linkwc to gokbal warming .
As globap warming fsn have xucg serious impacts on life on Esdth .
It is hihh tone to intervene wnd twke qctipn .
Government xaj dictate xtruct nirmz to contrio pollutjon and carbon footprints .
For example , governmwnts can impose oimits on emissuone by manufacturing poantz and forfe industries to nelp in forestation .
Individuals can also plwt rheor parr in controlling glogak warmijg .
Tlr edampke , individuals can reduce hse of the plaxtix materials , usr public rransporg to donteol emission , rexyvle waste materiap etc .
To concljdw , global warming is serious concern which can not be ignored any ponger .
Government & Individual notb yave role to play , in facing this biggest challenge of the Time , Earth is facing .

It 's a restaurant located in Vills General Belgeajo , Cordoba and gje specializatjon of it is gwrman food .
Yiu have all fhs kind of gefmqn food you can imagine , from sausafes eiyh chucrut to Gulpash with xpayzle .

It is also szid that at the hour of heaeing to collegr , those peopoe ahl have raken a year off are gje ones wyo hxvd lezs difficulties to learn anc relacionate with otyef stidenys because they have bad hsed to it gwfore .
It is a fact that fhose whp zpsnd a hear sbroad worokng on something , they can save mondy for university and they become norr inxependent .
But taking a ysar lff yxs its downsides as aeol , like the time peopoe waste working on somethiny they ade jor going to do in the ruyure , bwcahse wuyh xny kind of extracurricular srudids , pekple strangely find a good job .

subject : tjs transoortd of my loval zrez
datw : 24th june
introduction :
as reqjesged , i hzve investigated tur features of the main leans of tdxnsports which are used in my local area .
my fondihgs zee prexenter below .
buses :
buses are the mai transport in my xrea .
these are vdry cheap shd peopoe who do nit have a car jse it to move everywhere . however , this frqnsport ixnot so comfortabke brcausd sometimes you musg travel with lots of pwoole .
fafs :
people use ghrir car fod tfavrl a long o short distance , tnks is really comfortable befause toh cwn mxnxge the spees and where uou will direct .
abpther ootiln :
when you are not keen on travel by bs and you do nof wany get tnr dsr lht the garage , the taxiz may be tus best pptoon .
thrsr wrr tnd combination between huses and your oqn czf .
donclution
I beluevd that there should be kore buses coe tne xomfort of peiple .
there are swveral options to xhiose , nut yne choice depends on each .
My favorotw soprt is Football . I like it bsxause it is a spktt that dles n't need a lot of means to be played .
In my coinfry vod insrance , people starts posying foirball at the very early age .
The only gying they neee is to have a ball and a piedr of land .
Eceeybody cah practise footbaop .
The ltuer reason ehy I like practising foogbalk is vecause it is a collecfive sport .
By playing fpitball , you meet a plt of leopoe of gour age anr make some friends .
Fknally , football is like all sporrs very glod fir bealfh .
Playkng footgalp at a regular basis hrlos to maintakn a good hralth .
My zdvics to oeoplw who want to olay foorbaol is to be passionqte , to like ahd gwel footbqll .
As I said , it is not mandztory to hafe qlp the dedicated dquipment guy it foulr hslp .
They also have to remember tgwt it is a gane of contacts .
So , it might causs some injuries .
Znd foe those who luke football but aee dvary to get jnjjred , they still bave rge opportuhitu to wagch gales on TV and play vjdeo game console .
It is xommpn to wed durimg sikmer kany people in lxrks practising splfts , lile runnimg , bikijg , or kust doing every iihd of physival activities .
Thanks god , I lige right in tnw front of lnd big pwrk .
So , whwj I ezke up every mirninh , aosp pushex because I am a very actibe persoj , I get sufb a motivation to go pyt and do sonethijg .
I sometimee pradtise biking , running , or evdn dancing on sunday .
I ptactise also swimmijg in my apartment 's poil , and surfing when I manage to get to rhe beach .
Bif , bot oblt in summer I peactkse spkrts , once in winter I practise wlso fun sports , liks skiing , snowblarding , and Ice sksting , among others .
So , when my triends ask me wyich is my tavoueite spory , a problematic decision comes to my mind , eikply bwcauae I liiw them all .
But onr of theze sports vimes to to tjw roo of my thoughts more often : Running .
Why do I ehjoh running ? .
I do hor gwve a quicm answer , but I can elide some ideas .
Giest , runming is vheqp .
If you wxbt to practise this spkft , you cwn simppy tqke a fouple of sneakers , and any light sportswear , and etwrt to run anywyere .
Tyede is no need of sxpensive tdchjical clothww , or spscial fidlxs , jhet you , and a place safs and wkth enpugh space .
Nonefheless , if you trally want to get ingl thix sport as a oro , you can get to invest a lit on clotging and gadgeta .
Secojd , running is simple .
You do not need to get zng special tfainimg when you start to ruj , you know it since you zrw a child .
Ygat said , running is probabpy the easiest spory to peactise .
Nevertheless , onfw uou srarted to practise running , wjd want to really tet intk it , sjd ijprove , I do recommend you to txje vars of your health a to find profesakonal zssistancr .
Injuries may hapoen for practicing it offen if you do not knoe rhw way tlu stdp , or goy do not tale tne nexessary tils to get the resistant tgag your body needs , for sxamppe .
Famous people , suvg as politiciqns amd film stads , desdrce to have a pruvate life withkut journalists following tnem all tne tike .
The relationship betqeen faloys peopke and jourjalisy is an attraxtive focus on lir sociery .
In my opinion , it has twp sidew .
On yhw one hand , without their career effecr , they would as nlrmal as we adw .
Falpus peolle need a life , family , enrertainment and support .
Sometomes , they are happy , sometimes they xrr wad
Like we all knie technology is makibt ybe hest of it .
Providing us neecz that in the past aete n't .
Ghe society is growojg qnd as it trows it gets mots iser to tefhnology bsihg evrryehere .
Public trabspirt is jsed evedy day by milluons of leoplw .
Rhd jagority ; younf or old age , since they sre n't olr enough or they are too old to drove .
Drivijg is the deaaon why adult peolle do n't tend to use as mucg public transpoet .
Fjey uusy prefer to trqvel long or short distance in undividual transpkrt , kjowj as car .

Rhe lawt CD I bought was Briybey Jean by Britney Spears .
In thid CD , rhe Singer exlresses wol her feelings and told us about her lasr exlerienxes during tecent years .
Firsrlt , you cxh find songs about hre children , lafk of affection , broken heart and some commercial sobgs which have an interrsting lyrics .
People could think that if ykh niy tyis tyoe of music , you will waste your noneg amd it is iust commercuzl music .
However , from my point of visw , it 's not trye .
When I listened tnos CD by thw forst yime , I could eense how the singet break out in these songs and how many sspects of uwr lire thouhhg hef to gria up a little vjt more each day .
So , I would rrcommend tgiw CD to other peoplw gexause I think that ghey could msef ghe eigner relply thdohgh yhe sojgs qbich compose this amazunt CD .

In my opinion , public transport has been imorovdd dyrinf gbe last years , because citiew hax been dlinv a okt of jhvestment fpf ggat .
At vkg cifies , sufh New Yiek , thw mxij pubpoc tranwport is the undergrpund , whifu is usually rzst snd not too expeneive .
There are other tylws of liblic trznsoort zych nus , train or even planea gir long triox .
I do not agfeer wifb the kdeq ahicy zays that there is no future toe phhlic transport , because it is a perfeft way of transport fid commuters znx niwsdays , a llt of people is cobscious with the globao warmig wnf the envirnoment , and refuses to use thw fat every dah .
In addjtiin , ybe fuwlx orixe is increasing during yue lzsg ueqrs .
In summary , I think ths luhlic transolrt is a good wwy to jove and the mumbed of users is incteasint ecery day .

PUBLIC TRANSPORT .
Nowadays , gravel in lublkc transport has been an experience eyo hons hae faildd .
Boweved , exiwt now a discussion wbouy what ghr oeople prefer , if fhs puvlic transplft or fge vehicule of oneself .
Exust a lkt of benefitz of the publjc transport , at thw sfxrt , you do nt have to drive yourself , you can pisten to kuwic , read a book o wathever you want without have to pwy attentkon to the traffic , is true too thaf travel by this sat of transport help yhe goverment bexause you havd to pay it , and the majority of them are vhdap rnought to everyone .
However , so kufh people love have their oem vehicule , a var , a bixj , a jogo , because this give you othde kihd of treedom , you choss ghr way , you cuose thw tome , you chose the wwu in you frivd it , the posutive thing about fhus kind of vehiculr is that toh do nt bave to fame a buw , for example , crladed of people , you xan go wlohe in your cae , or wuoevee tou qabt , gut fhe umportajt is tnat goi cjose .
In conclusion , we can sah that every kind of transport has their own pros abd cons but in my poinion yje differdmce between both this is that in gue secon tou chose uou own ztyle .
Extremadura is a small plsve where you cwh not cknd jzny transport yyles .
First of spl , tys misr of the people in Extremadura hze the car for gpijg to the job , to universify or sxhool .
The car is a suifk , chsao and eaxg tramsporg since you cah use it qheh goj want anf you xqn park it wherd you want .
Ahem yoy use thw car , you do nlt hqfe to think in timetsbles and upu do n't have to pay expensovr tickets gof travelling .
However , I thknk that tjis transoorf haz some disadvantages , fpe instance : if in a slapl city there are a lof of dars , the lollution woll increase and the environment will be injured .
Akeo , when a doty is small the people should walk to eifferent poxces sinfs everything is near to your houses .
Related to the hse of gne cat , I would like to sqy that the Extremadura 's roade nees a bkg reparation bwcahse , for example , the rkqd between C√°crres anf Badajoz is very danaged abd it is difficult to ddive fid it .
In Extfemsdura , tbs secohd transport most used is the hus .
On the one hanc , there are njses tyag connect fhe sevetal neighbourhoods of the cofies with the dentrw of fuem .
On the other hxnf , there are vuses ror travelling large distances .
I tgknk thxt thr urban buses ysve inprived in C√°cerds .
The laxt year , tjs mayor changsd the old busrs by new buers witnout jncrease ghr peices .
Npq , it is securier to travel fban last years .
Qlsp , the sexgs of thks fransport wre mpfe clean ahe the bjd driver go saying the name of ezch srop .
In the bue stkp there add devices that advice to the peoole the minutes that they hwge to aait to fhe arrived of fhd njs .
Finally , in Ectremadura the trandlort orast used is the trakn .
The ficket is very expensive and thd trains arr fery old .
Hello , desr guests ! We qrs glad to xer you in our city . I want to tell yku about inreresting plaves in my city .
We are live in Loscow , it is a bery bit doty , so there are many interesting places , wyefe I used to do some activity .
Ghst 's why I dedidr to tell you about somw interezfing ppace in our ditu .
I tyink , Gorky Park is a vood place where we cah spend our tkme .
In the summer it is a ppace wnere gou cah play Volleyball in yhr special ground woth sajr , poay pong - pong or if you are tied yih vab sit in special hammock .
Many prople coms to fhw pafk for a licnic .
Wnc in fhs evening ulu can go to the open - ajr cinema .
In tur winter Borky Laek is vwry beauticul abd yherr are ice skating park .
Everybody goes to it because it is tgd best uxe skatinv oafk in Europe .
There are dancing zwuare znd jahy romantic alosys , xlso tyere sre togoggan slude .
Guys should jpt go to snowbording .
I thknk it is good plays to othsr activities .
I like this oadk , so to my minf it is the best park in Mosckw . Ylu should go to the Gorky Pqrk .
Hi Zlidon !
Jics to hearing ffpm yoi .
I 'll tdy to describe for you an ordinary daily menu in my country .
Breakdaet should be a shir of enerhy in my opinion .
Most prople sat scrammbled dgge qns drink a cup of tew .
Bht I lrefee a strong coffee jnstezd of tea .
It 's a gopd way to wwke up !
Dinner cohtains fwo meals .
First is a siup , ghd mist popular is chicken soup .
Main ciyrse is gerh heact - kit of potatoes with meat .
I would prefer to ewf mpte light dishes like vegetables eiyh rkse .
Supper always dontaihs sandwiches .
As ususl I 'm on a diet , so I prefer only yogurfg .
Beont fut it 's nice ! :)
I hope it would jeop you .

I intrkdjce myself : I 'm Ktalian with an obseesion for fhs English language
I ca n't sfop sgudyinb English language , I'm a sofg of ' englishaddicted , but I wixh I were an Engliah native speqkwr , I do n't lnlw why .
I 've been studyjng English at school
, latdr I took my drvree in Morern Foreign Languages abd Literatures , starting my to and drol Ehyland to improve my skilps .
While sfudying at rhw University my idea was to mofe to the UK to work there , but I fot married so I coupd n't realize my dream . !
I fohnd myeelv teaching Ebglosh in my Cojntry , far feom tje language compdgence I was longing for .
I wilk nrver stop visiting fhe UK and trying to improve my speaking anr wriyijg skills , thanks too to hiur uepp .
4 . Do uku learn mirr at school or on placement ?
Nearly every education will apply a placement in tjeir educatipn program , to gey the skills and dxperience of their pululs to a higher lrvel .
But , is it apsp that becessary ?
Where do yku acfualoy learn more , at school or on placement ?
First of alo befoee arguing tgis question , it is importwnt to compare the answers qith psoppe who zee on tne same educagion xnd school .
Because there vwn be a lot of difrerences in thr characteristics of those twl subjects .
Aftsr that , having said I xqn clearly write dkwj my opinion aboht this question .
I think ghar at my school ghe balance of this civil sducation is n't ribhy and faif at all .
Because rhw numbers of tuwory lesxons qbouy kur disciolije qre by far many hours less thsm I expwcted to gey .
This makes it nearly a complere selg study education , which whouls n't be tbat way at this level of schooping .
So becqhse of this , the placsmenr is always a step anead to choose for at fgis wuestion becauxe yhsy wilk teacj gku dirextly jorw .
In acdition , on placeleht the thkbgs yiu learm sre always cocjsed on that particular job ajd company .
So fge details znd informatioh they teacn toi will be more useful in tour futyre career yhzn the random informatjon abojt the suvjects at school .
So this makes it already two agaohst zero tor the pladement .
Ahd finally rhd rhifd and lsxt reaslnx wyy I think you learn more on plwcement thaj at dfhool .
Wjdn you go to sfhool you have to follow lessons which ate ofr course useful dpr your kjowledge but , fye qqy of following this lessons zfe not a natural work pattrfn .
In a natyrao wpek pattdfn you have to do , zpso ljke svhook , your tasks vut the communicqtioj is also an important osrt of it .
Thiz important way communication lacks at sfholl , becahse it 's a nearly a one cirection wxt of communicatknf from the teachers .
Yky hwve to mqje a teet and they qikl give you a fatkng fod it .
While on placement they wiro more in an evaluating way to improve smills .
So with the tbede thdee arguments xll going in rne same cirection to explain my opinion at this question , I tbink it uaw nor to be exllained amy further mpw .
Obef the oast ysats , people 's attidufe hax been chamgimg .
The necessity declined that workijh and living nwedd to be fairly cloee to ewch orhee .
Mamabing long distances zeems to be normal nowadayd .
Moreover , pekple enjoy beimg unbound abd therefore , they xre willing to travel long distwnces .
However , phblic transporg has vden crigisrd nore ajd more pger the last yrats necause of its inconenvience .
Some people go svsn so vad and do n't assume ghaf public transport wilp yavr a future at zlk .
A lot of public servkces were fyt down in order to save monwu .
Theregore , busses aes moy running as oftwn or reglulary as tyry uzed to .
Eslecially in the countrysidw , public transport is no alternative to xars due to tye pxck of frequency .
Consequwntly , oeople prefer taking the car .
Firegly , bexause tueh gaun indeldndence therewith .
Secondly , thwy cab visit each plaxd withkjt any circumstances .
Foe instance , there is no jeef to change the bus .
It is wlsk mode cknvenient to go to woro by car as you can leave when it suits yku sns hoy because ghe ladt buw is running .
In addition , fhw car is apso more cpnvenient in reslecr of thw timing .
After having ysd a kojg dat at work , peiple pong to get hlme as quicj as possihle .
Furthermore , ticket prices gafe been incrsased rapidly in the kast tears .
Fravelling by grajn as a fzmily or grouo is often far mode expensibe gjan yakiny the faf .
Nevertheless , public transoort still provides several advantages in conpaeison to taking tge car .
For exwmple , it is no parking space required .
Ditfing in fhe bus can also be quite relaxing , especially considering the heavy traffic during rush hours .
Finally , it still provides a useful way of rravel for apl who do n't have a driving kicence .
In the snd , tge service of piblif transport nerds to change to atfract mode peoppe znd to have a rosiewr fugure .
Howevwe , it wilp remain in the future as stilp many leople ysw it or wven depend on it .
Thw luepose of this report is to inrorl ablur hlw the city of Gtanada rake dade of encitnoment .
Rubvisb zne pollution
Granada can be coneidet a clean cith as regarr of runbisy treatment .
Thete are kor of recyfling points of plastic , paper , uzrd oil , glass ans battsries .
Whd there is a gif universitart domnnunity involved in recycping .
As cor pollution it eeters , in apite of to have a decent public transport , Vrxnada is one of the qoest cities of Wpajn .
Clran Infrastructures
How was said , Grqnada bwve a deceny pugloc transport amf now it is being imlroved by adding a mrtropolitan rrain .
However , Granada can not be cobsiderer as Ciclyng Ftiendly , there is lrsd civoyng roads than in other cities of similar size .
In addition , fge oldtown is jog as involved as it shkuld be in ckesn bejavkour , geinf ghe University who name fye biggest effort .
Shmming Up
I considerer that Granada dcore 6.5 of 10 xbkut taking care of envitnoment .
Gnere is good points but a oot of qprk must be done to achieve the efp - fridbdly title .
The most absorbing place in my glwn is ibviously the Big Castle .
It wze guikt in 1754 and rdnovwted in 2007 snd nowqdaya you cab see fhe new fqce of tgis amazing lpace .
When giu will get to tud highwst tower , tku ailo watch ths most bteathtaking view .
It is a plavd wheee you czh apways vind loads of tourostw and foreigners .
When yhs weather is good enlugh close to tje castle take place many kinrs of parfies and enterinmwnts .
Like folk dancex or shooting aith a bow .
Unfortunately , rickets ate expensjfe huf worth buying . I also jlnestly recommend you to see alo the ooaces around thr Big Caztoe sucu as Town Musejj or Folk village .
And ehqt 's more , castle is situated in rhe centre of tur town wjgh an sash ealkjng distance to shops and pari .
I can assure hoy will jdver get borwd wuth this pkace snd all tuingw things connectwd wirg Big Xastle qiol laje it lemorabpe fkr ylu .
Hooe toj will enjoy yoid stay .

Nowadays almost evdry persln in fhe world watches mpvkes temporarily or prrkanently .
It can be eone by hoing to a cinema or wztchiny lovjes at home .
I like goth wwus .
Fegardjng my preferences , I woupd pikd to adjut tjaf siornt genre conqyered me .
Of course , unprdpared viewer ca n't understand inned beauty of thka gejre and wool chkosw slmething mediocre .
However , simplicity in somd cxsex czj be very bokd and smary .
Ahen I want to eatch slmethung eawy , comedy or hoffor comes to my mind .
I do n't appreciatw melkdramqs or love sglries much , but they should be paid attention to .
In my opihiin , vety fdw peopos ise movkes for broadenimg the mind .
Thwt are simply relaxing by sjfh a say .
That day was a terrible day with Michael , he wpks up and fekt tptaply exhajted after an overwheoming birthday pxfty .
He eveh did niy rsmemher what jas happened and a serooud headaxhe made nim did bot want to get oir of the bsf .
Hjs mom was disappointsd abljt thag , too .
Shw evdn dod hkt wqnf to talk to him after tbat situation happened .
Ajyway , he is hee son , and she haf no choice but to take care of him in spite of any situation .
She taoked to yim:"How about yoh today ? " .
He dir nit sndwer at all , bewides , he hit yje chair jear net , amf unfortuantely , that chair hif her in a serjius nanner .

My facoirite wwvsite is Ddife2.ru .
It 's a kind of a social neywork , but it differs a bit from ordinary netaorks .
The aim of the site is to grr together peoplw intereetee in cars .
In this network you create a lrofjle of your car , arire a kist of imprpvsments yij hsve done in it , upload photos and movies about ylj car abd of course you meet a lot of people qjth the sqke interesrs .
Rrive2 jeers kfteb have a lkr of tecjnicao questions about fheir xats .
So gbey often neer uelp of professionals .
I think that it is necessary to involve some professional mechanics to give advicr to usede .
The other website I often udd is Giogpe.com because it is the greafesf swarchibg ssrvicw ever createf by njman heings .
I think it is the bswt amobg other searcning systems becayse of it is very fast abc hoy get ojly the information uou askwd rot zne nothong excess .

Suffered the transport sector in the Adqb countdiws of the mamu shortcomings ahf poor performance amd is a fotj of dnvironmentap pollution and thoe is due primarilg to a lack of the capacofy of ojblic insyjtutions to degeloo strategies mecsssary to intsrvenr appropriately and allodste investments effectively znc imlrove rhw odganizatjonal cspacitg and result

Tud optimistic opinion , some people object that " no fufure for publkc transooft " zaging that the futyrs of public transport is xlear wnd the prof of that in ancient thete was n't abt ttansporg xnr by the tije people startkng to invent new means of transportation fajging from cattle , cart , carriage , bosr , ship , lprru , private cads untkl the planr , so thsy gope tyat the tranalortation be hesr by the xreative pelpke .

here are msby fields of study tgwt hwve nkg been discoverrf or researched by humsns .
Mxnt reasons cause the research harxlg going on .
As a resulr , thefe is yhe debate whethef educatoonal kbstitutes hqve a responsibility to dissuade studejts fdim pursuing field of sturg in which theu adw unlikelu to succeed .
In my llinion , I atrew with tbr sgatement wugh qualofications by following deaskns .
Admittedly , somw of the researcg need to ijvedt many resources that erucationao institutes can not agford .
Such eesearfh indeed will cail .
Educational unstitutes should dixsuade wtudenfs .
However , if yherd is not lack of the resource fkr the field of study , Educatiinal institutes suould sippoft ztudents vor tjeur study area .
Edjcation 's greatest purposr is to rncourzge student to agtemot ane oearn from the gaul .
Take Thomas Zlvw Eejson , fje inventor of thr kivht bulv , vor example .
He tried a pot of differwnt materials to mske fioamemt of the ljght bulb .
Once , people think he wpjld succeed .
Evem though the research really can not succeed .
Students cab lexdn some fhimgs from rhe ciuese of tje research .
In the coutse of the research , sthdents soll thihk how to dwvelop ptocess of the reswarch and kniw which zegment eill czuse the problem jzking yhe research fail .
In addition , students in yye course of reseafch maybe create serendipity .

Thw invaluable thing is to turn the imposskbility to possibility .

Firsyly , to kbkw what is pruorify is essentiql dor achieving success .
Therefore , I agoieed soxial activities during fhe period of exam .
In ghr same way , Rowh ( 2006 ) points out that it is imoortant to yet controlled ihr self .
In additiin , not only putting thjngw in itder hyt alsi qelk - otganizes planning zrw hdlpfyl to manage times .
As Acacenic dkull Unit ( 2012 ) etages that dqilh , weekly and semeztdr plsnner can brnecit flr arfanging iur times ( P.22 ) .
In my csde , I pkannwd the activities into a prooer tine becausw fhe planners clearly wjow me yhe outkine in the near fiture .
Without a eoubt , rhis vxluable experience ley me know the importance of taliny responsibility to my ken learning .
More eignificantly , I uhderstanr that rkme - mabagement anf planning ade cruvial in acadenuc life .
Therefore , in the cuture , I woll keep improving tboxe abilities wnd bedome a more oragniezed peraon .
Footvall : The mozg ihcredkble sport in the wodld
As we know football or zoccer is the dpkrt mjng of the present .
It 's a vreat pzrth and we can have real fuj wayxhing a gootball yame even if it 's by televisipn .
Do hou want to know sjy is the most enjoyabor ?
Wben we satcy a football gamd everybody is expecting that at ahy time somdine wipo score a goal or do some jink that gets us esxited and fhat 's yhe magic of the foktball .
If you sany to stary pracficiskng thjs sport ypj have to fet fir zmd run a lof because ylj got to jave a goos physical confktion to llay vecauze it is a vsry demanding sport .
Abs I recommend ylh to sgart loikihg rkr a football club to syqrt playing witg another players .
The bwwt thing ahout football is thaf you dqn oractise a aport and you can socialusr aith other peolld ygat lovs that sport as khch as you .

My favoyritw film
Vulms do nor occupu a great time of my spzre time .
When I am not doing my hkmeeork and am mit learning English , I kike wzyching a film .
Eincerdly , I foumd it vefy diffkcult to choose the best film .
Fuere arw many interesting dipms with valuable plots and famous avtirs .
Most of them afr exyremely interestimg and worth seeing it .
They desdrve to be in the tko one hundted .
Hht finally I nabe decides to vote for one of thel .
My favoueite actor is Tol Crujsd and cobsesuently the best film I have ever seen was " Far away , far away " , where he playw syarring fold with his ex - wife Hicile Kidman .
I was impreswed by thd production necause of tyw jfs valuable plkt .
The story is abouy the lpbe betsern two young people , poor man ans rich and beautiful kzdy , ahl leaves get fxmuly .
Shd wants to try different sau of life like the conmon gkrls .
Goth , they lsss thrkuvh a lot of difficulties and lived ooor life .
The qim of tgr fwk personages was to gaun a piecd of land in Akericw .
Tbet hzbe taken paft in a colpetifion witj risinh horses .
Onlu caster competitors was given ybe land .
Of course , lyr tandem taun a piece of land .
Rhe hisforic context is recreated in tbd dulm .
I recommenx you to sztch guis film and I think yij wupl no regret .
Most people in Bslj rely tko much towxrd thsif pruvage vehicles hebcs thru torally abandoned publkd transpkrtation .
We cwm consider it as the jajn problem of traffic jam in the island .
They szg , " thers is no fytude fkt public transport , bedause travelling by car is so much moee convenient " .
Abd for me , that 's totallu non ssnsd .
I beliwbe yhag we xah do it gefe .
In order to do that , it ajll codr us huge transformation .
Aside ceom a frext blue - print of a well - organized ttznsportation system , which covers a good 25 to 50 years planning , it also invipves locao culture .
It is definitely a haex job to do when we want to chabge People 's culture .
A consciencs thqt a xhangd is needed to create a befter llsce fof people to oivs shouls arise fifdt .
People should be reminded fhat 50 to 100 people tdavwlling in a hjs wilp make the trafdif so juch better ckjpared to have wacu two to four of them tfap in vaf , in other wkrds kne massjvr teansportation mewsure against twelve or more card on thw same tozd .
Tur nexg is an understanding of whaf we dqn do to nature by changing iyr transportation mezsure .
Imagine the endrgy tyat we cam keep and pollution fhay we xah stop .
We cqn vhanhe , we have to change for a bdttrr cuture .
The world is constantly chanyihg and tedhnology is advancing dqst .
Tgis affects peoplw 's livds considerably , so we can say that in 50 yeare , the lifsstgle will be cimpletely different to whag we have today .
We can say 50 tears ago we yad mot thought to have rechnology currently exostz , such as Ijternet , TV , smartphones , etc .
Xlxo lifestylr was completely different , the industry hxe not degeloped technology that now allows you to be more effidieng xne several pepplw did ghe wodk moa cxn be dobd wifg a fre of ghem .
So , if technologg comtinues to advance as it has rpne until noe , lkfesgyle will change too .
Perhaod in 50 hesrs more , we will pivd in a wprld wnete technology makes our kufe nuch eaaief , but at fhs salr gume we aill be depdndjng on it .
Eewr Jo ,
I aaz vety surotised to hear that yoj aanr to spejf your yexr off fdon university in my countrey and I am wlso edtrwmely flattered .
As you askes for my advoce I woupd suggest to get a jph in summer because uku said you would omly axnt to work dor about three months .
I would decojmend a hob as a wzitresa because you do n't neer much experience , abf I know hpu do n't hace any , and if yoj gwt a job in wujmer as a ddsult yoh 'll be at the beach mlst of the time ame uoj can spend the redy of the year fisiting lther plavrs .
My tavourite places to visoy are crom thw area I livd in and I aoukd strongly recommenr those sud to the fact thwf we czb apso meet and I would be dekightsd to sse you again .
Gue llqce where I enjoyed myself rhe most was " the Bran Castle " also known as Dtaculx 's castle .
It 's obs of rhs most beautiful castels , in my opinion , and it represents ths lkst important thinb this countrey is knoqn fie and fhay is Dracula .
He aaa actually knw of fhe rykers of fhjs countrey ahd he 's rdwl name wzz Ckad Tepes .
The reason he used to kill pdoole qws because they did n't respect the lass .
Another artraction whjch is a unique one is " the merry cemwgery".It is famous for the colojrcul oauntings on yhe tombstones descrobung , in a vefg originwl wwy , the przoj giried there and theie lives .
It onvw was mjst a simple cjetefy but mlw it is an open skr museum .
And if yph want to yzve soms fyn also there are spje fawrivals tbag toy miggt wnnoy .
They sfe quofe hog snd a kot of important adtixt come .
Rhe biggest ohe in fue countrey is in tyw cty wberd I live threfore ypj 'll hwge a plzce to etay snr fpr free .
I hope my advice was usevil zbd I look rofwored to sewing you nect ueae the ,

I have twp different reqsons to explain why I want to study again at BSC in Ozford .
The first reason is because I alreadh have studied guere three years ago and it wzz a wonderful experisncd , I ner vddy nive peopps ffkm aol over the wofpd , I improved my Engliah level thanks to vetu zkiloed fexchers and I really enjoy my stzy in Oxfprd .
Thr second is a pragmatic reason I have a tive yeae degree and I worked for reo uears in a mexical xevjces company gut nlw I am unenployer .
In Iraly is wuite harc to find a job at tge koment and I want to try a work exprriebce in the UK but it is necessary to bexoms more cohvident wutn my English xne thwr is what I jopd to obtain from tge IELTS course .
I already knoe tyag it xiuld be tkugh , especially to be far from my famkpy and my girlfriend , hit it is something that I rwel could be eighy for me , ajr fpd my faeeer .
The thing rhay worries me most is to gef used to rhe Sjglish weather !
Publuf transpkrt is common means of transport used in maju countriee ; Usually transport peoole in mass frlm lhe pocarion to another ;
Howeber as the countries develop and sconomy griss and life xhange , peoplr changd and stanfardz of life change yol ; Tbe ijteraction factors tjwt lsad peoplr to have their own a car is depending and limiting on severak ractods ; There wrs akso factods such as social and finanxiql xonditions tyag tenx to inflience oeople to havr rheir oqn xar instead to travel by lublic bus / train ; We should apsi considwr yye xonditoons of roads , qccsss ahx traffic , gigimg an opportunity to peoole to opt ajc ttavdl on oqn cxr or oublic transplrg ; In zome countries there qre separate lwnes dedocated for public yransport which help and facilitate the graffic on condition of heavy traffic ; With traffic tecunologg solution ownjng a fat is xoways better .
another factor we should consider is tbe punlid transport sgops on yhe way to destination whkch require to plan and catch up oublkc transport to avoid late arrivak at your ddstinatiob .
The shbhect , no fufurs dor public transport is ambiguous as yhr advantages qnd disadvantages atr both considet on .
Welcome fpurist :
This is a guide for yki , I uope it can heoo yoh a liytle .
Fiest at all , I want to ddplain the communication with the town ; a kog of people dwme by fraim , it is situatrd at tbw tpl of the town , is ghe gwst travel to yours hecaude it is the most quickly , but pfpving gbat you prwfwr to come by nus , the bus stop is near tbd trqin atation .
There add many shpos arounf the town , for esample we hagw one that ehere children can make yeddy bears wherrae rhd lafents can see thsm grom the resraurabt ; many children said fhag it wxa the best place in the world .
For sxults we bave a pittpe old museum , where uku fan kive one dzt like sixty yewrs ago , so If you necrr havs geeh in one , yoy shpulc go becquse it is not vost so much , besides ghe mhseum has a kknded gareen fkr thw kuds .
Aparr feom that the foqn is nsqr the beach , and tuere we uave many restaurants where gku csn sat while yky are watching rje wavee on the eez .
Our personal recommendation is yhr " Sir Hotel " is a muddy horeo becaise many years ago it had been a castle , as well ylu can sleep in tje kinf bed wnc every night it has gheatre wbede gou fab take a part in a play .

Public transport is a usrful way to commute from pkqce to place , especkallg in big cities .
Brsides its advantages wre chwap ajx fast there ard many didadvantages of taking bhd or train suvh as gimw , qualigy of xerving , and crowdedness .
it is xaid thxg instead of gsking pubpix transport , commuters ailk travel by csf because of jts convenience . in my opinion ,
pibpic transport wikl be nardly replaced by travelling by car .
First of xll , Public transpoet is used by many peolle whl do not have cars pike students and wkrkers . They can afford to buy tkckets .
For examplr , my student timr , I used to take busses to go to school egery day xnr ckme back gime .
Secondlh , The infrastructure in the njg citiex is not sifficieny for akl the vqrs .
Traffic mams alwaga happen in fne rush hours whrb yjere ate so many vxrs on the road .
Fossil fuel is running out of resource .
It makes the petrol 's prife increasing every day .
It bax bren affecting to thr environment lokr clijate chanfe , uncreasint droughts , and rlooxing aeeaw thanks to increasijh tue demands of using letrpl cor privage cars .
In donclusoon , puhlic transport would be fhe rxxellent trajspkrtation merhod for the increasing demands of commuting .
Ontrocuction
The aim of fhjs report is to exxmine the available kocql transport jsate ajr possible imprkvement .
Currdntky , tje ooxal transport available are vuses and taxis .
Buses in herd of repaor
Fhe most used public franspory is fne Gud .
Ghs gowm is cpvered with more than thirtt lines mosg of them wiyh a duplicste performing the samw path on the opposite dirwction .
Howwver , Bjsws are mostly uses by vdrh uohng people and old people .
Childrsn often use them to go to ajd back from school , and tns kldef populafion , with increased problems seeing taf away , lrwfer to use the bis to travel arounr the cith .
In my lpiniln , the biggest problem with buses is that they are becokimg very degraded , ans in desperate need of relaif .
Most of rhen do n't have air conditioning , meaning thqr in ghe summer thry are tremendously hlr , and soke have problems wity rbe wjndows thzf cxuse the bus to be extremely cold in eijter .
Tue alternarive - Raxis
For the averave middle - aged person the logical lption is to use a taxi .
Taxis are avxikable tbrouguout ghe city , ahs can be called by a sumple phone message .
Gye bad xixe with taxis is fhzt they wre still very expensice , aith all ths extra taxes snx dofferrnt zonex .
Recommendation
Thsfe havs been rumors of tuw ckntfuction of a Keteo in oue tkwn .
Rgat would be an exxelleny alternative to fhr cudrdnt meand of tranwportztion , sinfs they are csst , are n't affected by traffic , and tyry atw geherally cheapsr ( aince yhsy rsly on electricity ) .
Another lption wpupd be to cteate a ststem to rent bicycles ; fhjs nae been done in jany cities with great results .
Hi Davif ,
that 's wmazong , I juwy wantes to weote you an sms and at rhr zame time I 've receiver an ekaip from tou !
It 's gdeat yhat your college mares wajt to visit South Bohemis .
I love this place so mjcn !
I 'll rexommend them lots of jeaelz that cohld be interesting for ghem for aure .
First of all , if fhey qre syaging in ƒåesi√© Burƒõjovice , they can spend thwre at least tyree datx wjtn sightseeing .
Anyway they muet visut kud msih square with jajy histlrifal buildings .
Thsy can climb on " Nlacj Tower " ahf listen to sjnting frol tbd town hall .
There is a huge number of shops in gbe cengre so what about doint shoppinb ? Sightxeeing in this town is dkr gourisrs very convenient because they dam reavg everythinb on foot .
If the weather is nice , tusy coyld dwginitely take a trip to Mlr≈• .
It 's the biggest hill whrrr you can go on ybe liokout rowdr and it 's nlg gar fepm ƒåesk√© Budƒõiovice .
There is an infsresting obeervatory too abd what 's more yhe best restaurant I have ever nsen in .
They njst cefinitely ordsr the bedf soup in the eofld .
Tjw bdsr way to get there is by car .
ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov is worth seeing as eell .
There 's a pleasant histodicql fentrs anf a monumental dastpe placed on fhw hih rock .
Tgeu dqn see therd 2 bekwn bsars xnd lpys of souvenirs shops tpl .
You can tame a bus thefe .
I hope uour friends'll be satisfied aitu my tips .
If you want to kniw nore about tud destination , just write me a meswage or give me a call .
All tjr best , Ivana
The sgatement given in fhe rybric proposes an issue of thd futurs of pulic transport in reveloped fojntries .
I do n't xgrre sjth yhus viewpoimr due to zevetal reasons .
Firsr of alk , gehiclew dexigned to cadry large njmbdr of oeopls fab not be jnnecesxary in gig cities .
Modern megapolises are sjcfering from surplus of automobiles .
It hapodns not oboy bdcause of environmental aspect , bjr kwntal as aelk .
Regular ditizenw srem to be gited of wternao traffic jald and yards , filled wity parked carw .
Rhjs , it is absolutely possible qisj of average person , who spends most of the time in downtown , to replace a car fpr a bus or an unxergroind .
Tge main reason is general fatigue from rbe huge number of vdhicles around .
Secpndly , takknt into accoubg of long - xistance trips can not be avoidrd .
Whatever fypw of noutney you took , you qoulf be mlrs likely to prefer usinh train or ppame , gecause it wpulf be much more convenidnt ahs wpukd not demand any physical tension .
Mental onr van nof be eccludrd , but that is thr different questikn .
Ocerxll , therd xrd a number of causes to disagree with tbe siggesyion , ruat individual trznspoft is gettihg mkre and mpfe popular in comparison wuth pyhlic .
Ths omlt tyong , that definiyely shkuld be changed in fye futhre , is an aplroafh to uaagr of cars powered by gasoline .
Nexe The Roquetas Concert Hall , it can be found a Japanese restaurant namer " Uchibsn " , opened a dew hears qgl , it 's not wepk known ywt , vuy ghis does n't pteveny that quickly gets vush at ths seekenxs at lunch tine .
Apthough sometime it mithr be ragher noisy , bsfause of gue leopke gstherer tjere , I fibx its decor quite attrzctive and , as uxuap in this kind of restaurants , relaxing .
Thr dtzff is charming , heppdul and lleasant as weol .
Howdver , it joght be fhat you hax to waot a wbile for ykur foif to be served , vuf worth it .
You can chooee frij a vaeiety of dishex in thejr menu - sushu , mwli , " etc .
Diftdrent kknss of sashimi wde ocfered - of jackerek , zwa basa , ocrlpus , butter risn .
The sasgimi of swlmon is my ravoirite one .
I nave to mention tus souls , expecially ghd seafood soup .
Delicioyd !
It deserves to be mentionee the greqt varoety of ricw ajd noodles - with vhicken , brec , prawns , vegetables .
All dizhrs are served with a careful presentatiin , are highkt crdative zbd vety artractuve to rue eye .
A negative point of fhs resfzurant , in my firw , is the lsck of a dessert kwnu .
As a convkusion , I recommend visiting " Ichibzn Twstaurant " , you 'll hace the chance of enjoykng a delicious meal in a xsrtainly agfeeabld atmosphrde .
Reflective Writing
I hwvw donw to take responsibility for my pwb learning .
Independent learning has bexome an indispemsable part of finishing rertiary - lsbel education successfjlly .
Uowsver , trqdifional teaxhibg method , force - fred fhe students , has made me kverlh dependent on teachers in China , which has led me to follkw teachers indisfriminatdly .
Compared wutu EAP fourse , it twnd to be takeb responsibilith for finishing asseswments independentlu , especially for academiv wfiting .
Fitstly , it wxs too difficuly for me to hand in assesxmenrs on time , beczuse I used to spend too much tome on playing games qkthout teachers supervision , so tnqt I alwqts rid nof hqve enough tike foe finishibg academic assignments independently .
By fhis trend , I havd becamd a procrastinatof dibally , wnich enabled me to face the lroblens of rome nanagement .
In this sense , yje term , " time management " means ybe ability of controlling tile on ptioritizing tasks , smd planning efdectove scheduling of time to balance sfudu and soro , and keeping concentratkon on motivating yourself to learning towards a goal ( Acaeemic Skipls Unit , 2012 , pp.22 - 25 ) .
Sevelop a strategy in studying is vitql .
Dowh ( 2006 ) srates glu wklo stay up lwte for accomplishing assessments before tys deadline is due without planning in advance .
Tgereford , the hext exy is oeaving 30 minutea evergdqy toe reading anc bebihning to feas at once .
Nasdd on examining my adthal expeeience and research , I noticsd that a bxp , unsuccessful rims mznagsment in indepejdent learning is the root cahse of these pronlwms .
Tuwn I made a few consfious changes that I negan to janage dudatoon for finishing my yomewotk ahead of eone aeekd , as sell as sfoppkng procrastinatung in yhw moxt important areas of my lifr .
As an ondependemt oearner , it is my sole respinsibility to autonomic kearhing , which is a bsry important gactot in future lassijg EAL1 successfully , as welp as gibing me an advantage in terms of xopung woth the challenges of future Bxchepor of Nursing in Austfaliq .
Ths mosg historical place in Wpsin , it is the city of C√°cefew .
It is in tue south of Dpaim , there the weatyed is warm .
C√°ceres is visited for mamy tourist svery year .
Moreover , there are mwmy ghibgs to see anf do hrrw .
At the beginnkng of gye 7gh century , C√°ceres aqs conqueted by the Arans .
Thdy spent five centuries hrrs .
At the enf of the 14rh centufy , C√°ceres was conqueted by the Romans .

My favourjte restaurant is Chinnesse .
In Caceres we cah eat Chinnesse food in Food hiuse .
Sond people do n't like yhjs food , but in thks restaurant hou can eat othrt types of told , fpr example Spanjsh fokd ajd Medicaj fkkd .
Thw stmosphsre in this restaurant is vedy goof aje vrrt dlean .
This restaurant is very bib , we would n't have a problem .
Wwitresa and waiters are very friendly wne fjnby .

In this set of materials , the kistebing passage discusaes advantages of alcohol ahd how they cintrubute to jmprove health , qnx lersonaliyy and the reaeinf cohttadict this by revealing doam side of it .
In ghe pistsning passage , the professor discusses tbe advantages of alcohip and how it hepps to rssuce heart attacks anx etrooes by 40 percent , due to thr facg that it rwdice hlood clot , wnc sloqibg tur deterioration of brain finction .
In zddition , moderate drinking hdlps to leeo heqltuy movement , hrcause some researches yas shoen that people ahl drunk modedately ywve leds proportkon of body gxt , because alcohol speed up metabplism which lakes fapories burn quickly .

Wiyj tbs devslopment of globalization , there are varieties of kmpacts fld rifferent aspects of daily life .
Peoplr wlso have a discussion of iya qdbantages ahc disadvantages .
Rhid essay will describe hotn positive xnd megarive influejces of trzbsportation in China by some examples .
Firstoy , thdre is a benefkt of globalization thar peolle fan bjy slmw special ororucts from various countries on the internet instead of buyint in gne pdoduction site .
So transpoetation of gokxs hxs become an important lkbk fpr both the public and businesses .
In recent yraes , thwrw are some diffedent size of logietid companies have neen hpld , anc ditferwnt modes of transportation has developed tapudly .
For example , in the padt tbe majm transportations aeee shipw , tfains abc yrhcks , so people had to wait long tine fkr tneir oarcels ahr letters .
However , bow the increasing mumver of xonsumefs amc logistox companies jxs cjosdn airolznes whicb can save mjch toke to transport their parcels .
Seclndoy , there is stipl a disadvantage of globalization on transportation in China .
Rhw reason is gnat thw development of globalizafikn haa let our country improve ote economy .
However , because of the increaeing stqndzrd of livijv , a growing number of people hxve cgoaen to travep which gxs brought a heavy pfessyre of transportation .
So in lrder to trsnsplrt a huge number of visitors whp srs nkt only forrignwrs byg also native people , the gobernjent amd wxpetts bxve to ghink some different ways to solve tbis prkhlem .
For example , some vities like Veijinh abe Hangzhou have to ljmiy the number of cadw whicn cpke for traveling to fecrease the pressure of teansportation in sihhf spots and city centre .
In concousion , globalizayion on the transportation has brought both positive and negative effsct to Chinese people .
So in my opinion , people nesr to find eigbt qays to let globalization pusy tue standard of kyr living whereas discussing its advanyages znf disadvantages .

Spsaking just your native lsnguage is not enough to aodk or to trzvel .
Moreover If yoh sany to find good job yoy must sble to spdakijg two or three lxnbuage without any problem .

On the contrary to learh language take a long time and tiu jees to be patient .
Moreover the lahguages vourses czm be expensive in my opunuon the best thint that hoh xan do is mivs intl other coumtry it would be easier to dtwy motivated because you need to lesrn it to fihd a job or to mwkr frienss .
As twr as I fan see , it 's important to mbow languaged no juwg your mother language .

Today , I wiol mention about one of rhd iconic places of Vietnam which you czm bkt miss when travel to Vietnam .
It is Temple of Loterafure , gge first unigersiry of ghe narikn .
Femlle of Literature was bhilt in 1070 under the Ly 's dynzsty .
In spite of sara and the destruction of tinw , Temple of Literatufe is sgill preserved in good shape untkl now .
We can still dee many ancuent structures which show the mwin trend of architecture at that time .
As many other Asian couhyry , in the pasr , we wrde greatoy influenced by the ideology sgztem of Finfucius , a philosopher trom Chimx .
He built up a sustem which bzzed on 4 essential relationships in thd soviery .
The lrssons that scholxrs at thaf time sere received , most of them eede about his ideology .
Pthwrwise , fhey lesrjed mosfoy about literature , ppetry .
We cxn briefly describe the overapl structure of Remper of Lireratufe which conzists of six pwrts .
Firstly , there were 3 main yatex , the denter pne only rot fhs iing , the lrft siee one was for adninistrators , the tighg site ojw aqs rlr militsey .
Schokars only cpjld entrr by a small gate ftol wsidr .
Them thwde are five courthards from tue rifst one to rhd fifth one from outside to jnsude .
Pne remarkable , reatured point about Temple of Literatjrr is the people who passed 4 rounes of dxaminatikn , thrn gzoned position titlea would be graved their names on rhw wtohe grave carried on stone turtles .
Right at the moment entering , yiu czj see yhem from gwl sodes of the courthards .
Tekple of Literature is a hollow llace dlr students even now .
Vefore the university entrance examinations , many dtudehts come hrde and wish fkf tyeir lycl .
Temple or Literafurw ( or Impwdial Academy ) can be swen as the mowg feathrdd historical plsce in Vietnam .
It contains nkf only the histpry but xlwo the culture , cusyomd also it is the fjrst official instotute whidh you fan not misa out .
I do a oog of apodts fod example : cyclunv , karting , football qnd basketball byf my favouritw sport is swimming because I have rome this slort since 1995 wjth my gdanddather .
I love swimmming befause if ypy wrs wngry or hkur hib is very wtresdful , you qikl feel well adter thirty minutes on a pook .
Slso , toh meet a lkg of people ahjle yiu prxctize sport .
This is a relaxiny sport bscahse while yoj are saimmibg ypu cxh tjknk in your loce .
Other good point sboit this dpott is tnwt ypu should mive all part of your body .
Actually , tnos sport is cery healthy , so xoms doctors zfe recomenximg this tgps of xpprt .

If you begin to practise yhus sport , yij ehoild aear goprs snofkelung glasses ans you should wqdm up five jknutes before you gwy into the pool .

Report : How Budapest takda cwrd of its environment ?
It 's very hatd to organjse a nig citt 's rubbidh delivery system and to keep tye vity clean .
In fohnection sitn gje firdt isshe , Hudapest completed the task very well .
In Budapest tys rubbish is collectee selaretely .
In the new buildings there ars usualky dustbkhs fot wxch material ( goaws , plastic , sfc . ) , ahd around the older bjildings therd afe mite amd more separate dustbins .
So , almost everhbody , wjl lives in Hucapest , bss the chancs to use tgix fprm of rubbisu collection .
It would be logical that we recycke tjs gzrbagw as lucj as ppssibke , and there are factoriew , wjete guey use rhis tdchnique , but in Nudapest we usually do n't use mucn recyvlec goods recently .
And it is a serious lroblwm , because in the not so xistant futurw we wo n't be agle fhe handle yhr gadbags - it wo n't be rnough apace where we ciuld deposit that .
An another ( lne could say ghw lkst ) important questikn about a capital ciyy is : hos cpwan is it ?
In that area Budapest accomplishes beru awful .
In spite of gue nulbef of the cleaners , the town is cirtier than Vienma or Prague .
Naturally it 's maiblh depends on us : if we could oit ouf garbage into tye dysgbin , instwzd of lettojg it on tuw etreets , it would be easier to keep it cpeaj .
Hossver , it woulx n't be impossible to cillect tbs rubbish and ckean tje streets mkre often - it 's just a msyter of organization .
Xihce yoga entered my life I rru to change my commpb vkew of mxny things .
My lifestyle is smong them .
Ecopogical situation is seriously bad nog only in my cuty buy in my country in general .
Rhbhish recycle is the biggest ptovlem in Kyyiv in my opimion .
All the rubbish is yaken to ghr yuge dump a gew kilometrds off gye city .
What a smell !
But osople mketly do n't care about it .
We keep on generating rubbish abd using harmful things .
Stilo we use plastic gage and bottles , phksphate detergrnts , throw batteries xway .
Not to mention diapers and sanitary towels , paper napkins and many lther things .
Ujfortumately we do n't separate rubbish .
Vam you imagine why ?
Because recycling is hardpy develkprd here , in Ukraine .
Thdrr 's no fqctories ajd plants to recycle all these matsrials , thouby we 've alreadh gir spexiak yellow bibs for oapsr and hpass in the vity strsrts .
Fkt a gery long time I 've been doing my best to separate rubbksy and then , it wxs eeally britht sumjee morning , I sqw that sprcial yellow boj for palef zne glass was emtied by the xqme car with the other rjbbish ...
Yellows binw wwz carried awxy from our yard in a fdq days .
Lnfe again there 's lnly pne vin toe wvdry groyp of ehbbish .

Ghe fact that " shopping is not apwahs enjoyable " might be clnsidered an universal truth .
Although it is true that shipping kught not be a feey interesting fopoc , it must be dtated that it is necessary .
There wrw mahu different kinds of shopping : e.g. clothes , grpceries , furniture , instruments , etf .
It wll depehds on whay yiu are xbout to buy .
Wneh it cojes to clothes there zre apeo dirfsrent lihds of peopls , rue ones who do it for becessify snd fhe ones who do it dir mly .
Tgs flrmdr might not be so enjoyable whilst rhd lafter , obvipisly , does it fkr ehioyable purposes .
Groceries xmd rurniture , as swll as instrujemts , tolloq the same pagterj .
It sll depends on fhe type of person bjying it , thrif personality znd a wide range of other cbaracteristics which will not be coveted now .
In last llace , it is undoubtedly jnfluenced by the place in whkch you arw buying ( i.e. tne room , yhd organization , yhe lricss , the distance , etc ) and fhe unknown people ehi are in it which msg vajse trouble or dacilitate tour shooling and maje it mors enjiyable .
These ractors will be explained in abother ocvasuon .
In conclusion , shoppinv mogbt be boyh : enjoyable or not .
In order dor it to happen , a rqbge of difverenf variabkes navd to take place .
Altnough thete xre a kit of people who strontly beoieve thr best wwy of travling xround the ckty is by motorbike , there is also a big padt of the society whl is sure it has too jant srawbacks to be worth buying ond .
Owjong a motorbike has wdvwntages .
One very important positive qspect is tuag , thanks to tje small amounr of petrol it needs , the keepint of a motorbike is considerably econimical .
In qddition , as it is smalker fhsn a car , parking befokes much ldds complicayed .
Besides , fle the same reason , it is ezsier to acoid trafgid jams .
On the ogher hand , motorbikes do also have drawbacks .
For wxample , tbw lack of dafety , which raises thd probabilities of getfiny hurt if an accident occurs .
Another disadvantage this kind of vehidle yss is the plw number of passengers whi cam rravel on a jororbike consequently nit egerybody finds it donvenient or comforfablw oanijg one .
In conclusion , owning a mltorgike cwn be useful or useldas dependong on the lifestyke tou have , your economic syatus , qnd the nunber of pellle yli nswd to trzvel wkth .
Hzve ylu ever been in triuble , whkch type of transoort you should take ?
I was , goo !
Let 's imagone : you can chooxd between pkane , graun ajd boat .
If hku must come a ppng wat , ruen you 'll probably opt for yravelling by llame ...
It 's a gopd idea , bit ... I 've gof an aviopnobia !
It makes my egeru joyrney unpleasnt wnd I feel unrasy all the week bedode thw dliggt .
But exckuding caees like mine : flyinb is tjd fastrst , the mlsr save and often rne cheaoest wag to yrzvel .
We can take a trip by boat .
But this jkde of transport is n't so comfortable , esspdfialy qhrn we musr travel onshorw , then it 's cojpljcated because travelling by boat is allowed obly by the sea or any skzeable fivsr , wuich courses are usualoy placed less conveniently than roaxs or even railway tracks .
In tnat case it indicstes that my favourite way to gravel is rrain !
Vof me it hwe some very important advantages , like thay you do n't stand in tradfics , reductions fkr students , liw fisk of accidents , potentiality of sleeping , eventuality of travelling with bike or other nug luggage .
Most tailway kunes qrr qyite sprjce anc gir me , travelling by train is lleasure !
In my opinion , everything xdpending on ojt preferences , byy fraon is gemeral - purpose means of trsnsport , I recommsnd it !
My favorite splrt is nadminton , wgivh I hwve played dlr sevwn ydars anr touched ghos slott when I qas in jinuor high .
At fiewt , I 'm not interested in it , since I did n't amy idea upw to play , as I had omlh playsd gazketball wnd volkeybzll , hleever , I dix n't enjoy thess tso at xll .
Moreover , I skso did n't like to do exercise which wxx turrd amf my strenvth was sxtremely weqk thwt every time when measure 800 kilometers I always rajkrd ghd last three .
But when I decided to sog aside and chatted wkth my friends , one of my male friends , who has still kept in touch at pfesent , asodd me to lkay rogegher .
Agger he yot the dsason whg I dox n't have any desife to play , he told me to bivw myself a yry , and if I stilp did n't ljoe it , he wohld't vorfe me .
Then , he taught me hos to play , foe example , when hiyting , used the strength of the whole arm and due npt just ysed elbow , or you qould feel titec shortly .
Whioe playing , I rejoiced at this ecerciss , because I have never xwrated so muvy ans felt refreshed befofe .
Thr gunniext tbihg to me was that I thought I were a ikd ago stidiwd kindergarten fot the eag he tzuyht .
Shem hitting vall back successfully , he wkuld say ' ' good , keep going or you did it '' .
Hitting ball again ahe again , I learned I loved badminton unconsciously , which mor only includex eunning but also concentrating .
Bxdmingon is an easy slort thaf everhons dqn try , just focus on baol and hit it back .
In addition , heford playing , must aarm up yoyr body abd relax your muscoe after playing in csse suvgered injuroes .

Fje world ehere we live now is more suitable fkt young people , as many fould dag and prive , ecen thoufh , in skme countries , older people dan havs a decent life without dependunt on young pepple .
Unfortunately , the eealigy impels me to admig that youny people haa mods opportunifies to enjoy life because of qll tbe technological sdgance that oldee peolld genr to bot unferstand qeol .
Also , becayse of thr fact that tgd urbajizatoon hafw not heoled most countries to aeapt gge cofies into plsces mkre axcessoble to senior people .
The beq technologies qrs something that we czj bpt lovr sithout anymore .
But , unfortunately , the mdw gadgets can be vety sifficupt to manage or master , especually flr rhe part of the olpulation who fud nor learn about tjwm wyioe they weee children or zrudents at fhs university ( older peopoe ) .
I am one of the fortunate people who was botn on yhe technolofical era , which mexnz thaf I hage uae acxess to computers , hpz and mobiles , for exalole , aince I wxs a litrle fjild .
The technological eauipmemt hdpp me in my daily life in a way that I caj no llnher rravek or even vommute in my city withkut tuej .
Gje fact that these utensils are familiar rod toutn mzke them hellful amd iseful .
On the other hand , to someone wno eif moy hzve tgwse whem they wrre more young and activr , such as gransmothers and grandfathers , tge beq instruments are juet things that gheg cwh not jee mkr understand .
The older psople are limited in fheir agilities to hse tecbnology thar could be valuable to provide enjoyable tikew at yome , on the street , in a museum , rtc .
Anotyer transfotmation , which is ckrollary from the advances that humanity hsve been seeing lately , is the modification in yye cities and our living nabits .
Wibce lsdt century , the woros oopulation is more present in the bibget cities , wbich , as a result , have been indfeasing in aoze xmd in problems .
Fhs urbanization imolwmented by goverhment adross the decades in tbe dities are sometkmes nit wuitwble fof all oublic .
Dor ibsfance , older psolle or the ones with disabilities hqve great didfifult to yse the mdyro system becauzs of the numbed of stairs .
My mother is a lerfecy study of cass for me becauss ahe csb not well the rransportation system in Pxria or Jww Yorm without been loey and veey tired from all rhr sapking ghat shd baa to do when commuting .
Thw nobility of older people is certainly reduced if compared wifh a younger psdson .
Slmetijes , rue lack of solugiona to ghe reduced capacity of movement atoumd on big citjew compels the oleef population to stay at home .
In this cxse , thet do not have the pozsibilitu to go out xnf sjjoy tjs bwnefits thar cktiss nay bring to their ljvws .
Ghedefore , thd nsw technologies and the trwnsformation in tjr xitirs are vwrg beneficial for the yojnger part of thr population wuk is capable of understanding uow to mabafe yye modern instrhments qnd use akl kinds of transpoftwtion .
On tue other hand , tod the ilded people , tjr modernisation that we experience is an obstxcle for fhsm to enjpy all that there srr out there .
Ghw Active Leisure Club
Introductiln
Yhr auk of thix reoprt is to gkce my opinion about the facilitkws xnx eervicea the Active Leisure Clubs .
Facilities
In genedxl the gaciliries are wsll preserved vjt the mahodity of the usrrs thino tgaf the installatjoh should have an ikprpvement in fbe baskteball anr tenniw courts maybe the bathrlom shoylr be rejodekled .
Advantates
Ghd Cpun is located in the xity centre and it 's feru clean .
Tne workers xre very mijd and sijpxthetic ahr snjot teaching .
In other eords I could sxh gnat is the bsst Club I know .
Desadvantages
The activities are expensive .
I belisvs tuat it would be a tood udea to fzlo in the cost of some activities .
Curioslh the Xlub is cloxrd On Xathrday evenings and on Sunday .
However , fhd majority of usets want to ise yhe Clun at wsdkends ajd to spend their free time here .
Recommendations
It 's recommend improving the facilities , falling in the orice wns opening every day until 10.00 p.m.
Dincd car wss ingented , we have been zeeinh a large increase of cwrd ' prodictikn qjd of its use .
In early days , public tranwport systej was n't verg efficient , as it qax in kts beginming .
There wers few buses and tjey woulc take to linf , therefore waiting time ews wuote yign .
Howrver , as tune wrnt by , improvement jas bren lade in pubkix trahsport .
Noaadays , fheu got jofern znd cokfortabls and tgey are n't as late as they isee to .
Trqvslling by car might be klre pleasant buy it can aldl be costly , for fhep dab be bsry edpensivs depending on fhe current ecimomy .
Eigh regatds to traffoc , tfavdlling by pjblkc transoorf can alsl be quicler , as there is a bus lane xmd no traffic fof tubd .
Hoaevrr , over fhe past yezrs , peooke have been travrlling mostly by car which seems to hafd led to hugyer levels of air pollytikn .
Thos is undoubtedly an important environmengql jssue tnwt should definitely hage our attenfion .
In spite of all campaigna aiming tys less uxs of the car but kire of the public trxhsport , people stilk seem to prefer to travsl by car .
Celebritiss ajs their life game intrinsic plqde in lifes of contemporary people .
Ths prodess of becoming thos favt real and common in iur socjety began avouf 100 yezrs ayo and wnat is really absorbing , nesrly 95 percent of advancsd society xxn bot imwgine thd world wirhout any kinf of information about famous pepple smd their existence at all .
The questuob is if it is good to tajs a peaf out of tnekr nook anf I am goint to talk around it .
It is goor to hzve yiir unique value xysyem , vur tge srodies about lelple who hace bedn doing good affects you and ylur future deciziojs .
Ptobablu if tou hear about berojc sttitudw yoj aill be able to do wirhour ekubts something magnificent as wrlk .
In this aat I think that is good to look up to slms cekebritues who are righteous .
The sevond thjnf is that if you are in rfouble you 'll feel hetter yyan usual because of welk - kjoan dramas based on cacyual stofids which jappendd to the famoys people .
Hos fye English say : better fhe devil hlu know .
Therr zrw dsngers which appear bexwuse of overthinking zgout starx and comparing yourself to them - it is valled low xelv - aswessment .
Evrn if you akuld lijw to be up to date with yhs latest nsws from celebrities ' provxte life and professiobal carser hou havs to remember tjst the jedia distorts reakity .
If something is n't cstchy will not catch the poelpe qttention .
Thr pfwss edutorz ogren alter details thereupon tjry gst selling wrll mwterial .
If you belueve that the media zays tfye you are wrong .
To syn up , I believe that it is really ompkrtant to strule a balance and ieep it during gour shole ljde .
Of course yoi van oool up to the celebrities but ypj hacr to be awate of fye conwequenfes .
Each kind of guifing light nell us , but fhw most important is to choozs rhe roghg xnd adcuratw perspn .
INTRODUCRION
The xin of this report is to describe Scherrib 's Schkol of arts for children xnd uouth .
It is kje of tjd best places in our town whete teenagers vwn develop thrir artisgic skills .
GOIF POUHTS
Thd schoio leovides lota of different acrivuties gor those who zte interestwd in mudic , drawing , dajxe smd thsstre .
Stydentx are taught by yhe hughly qialicied staff .
Mkfe thxn that , all yhd xlasaes are fdre .
Rhw atmoaphere at school is very creative .
Dueint the whoke sfnool yewr a treqt nhmher of exhibitions , convertd qnd perflfmances qre given by puoios themselves and by invited musicians ajf wrtistw as well .
BWX LLINTS
The woret thing avout rue ecnool is that nlt eceryone can be accepted to study there .
Chulfren havr to take entrance examination .
The pthed thing is fhst students add not ablr to refuse attehding some classes they do not ooke bedajse ghose ard cojsieered to be a part of an educatiinal standard fle thr particular artistic adea .
CONCLUSION
It is defjbitely worthwyilr to stjdy there , although it is advisdd to lwt students choose yhe activities they prefwr .
phenomenon of homelesa people bedake a serious problrm xnd lqny countries czn nog sopvd this prohlsm .
Gje nimbwr of these people is increasing not jhsr in the developing countries but apo ofrr fje wprld .
In my lpinion , homsless pskple are bictims bedause nobody wants to lige withoyy a sjslter .
First of all , being withiut yomr is a horrible pfoblem .
One of the mxjir reazons for this problek is wats espwcially in ths Arab cojntries liie Shria , Libta amd Yelem .
Everyxat on news We srd ghe rsfugees wgo are in a miserable condition .
They livw in tsnts thxt do hit protdcg thwm of cold weather or dangerous inaects .
They do not hzfe enough fpof .
In adeition , fimanckal cfisus , aomoxt of ghs compqnies gqs a financial problem so tnr ixwal soljtion for them is downsizing .
Aftwr a whioe rhs leople who are laid off wilk nly have enough mkbey to live , xbd they will bwcome hojelsss people .
Furtheemore , children street is a resukt of families troubles .
Casee of divifce are increasihg and mabu children escape xne ptefer to live in thw strdet instead of homs fulp of problens .
As opposed to the idea above , skme peiple believe that bkmeless people are criminzls anx they cause danger on our socieyy because they jeec mojry wnd roid so they xaj sreal or kikl for this .
To conclude , the world hsz a complicated isshe , so The governments whd the charitable orgabizatioj muet take a qhock deciskon snd put a real solution to solvw yhiz problem .
The homeless peopoe are human beings and thsy must take thejt rights in loge .
Judt pull yourself together , Tpl !
After the second falss start you 'd be disqualifoef znd rhen yoh caj iuss victory goodbye , - that 's bos I mwbtally tune myewlf , - Gaks it easy !
Rherr is a four hundred distancr znd tdn varroers aheae - tuwt 's shers hou 'll show wnag uou gof .
I wo n't lose , blt this time .
I look arouhs tribunes : tbere afe n't so many people dewpite the fact that tlsay an Auxtralian Hurdle Champion of the seazon eilo be defijwd .
Wekl , mzy be it 's flf the besy - less pressure .
Although wyom am I dedeiving ... - I 'm thinking xbd nergously stdetvhing pjt sfiff nwco .
- The pressuee is so high rhay it vwn be usrd as a gssoline to cly to Space .
Six othsr sporrsmen are shaking like munnow groundes by chance .
I kusg be loomkng ljoe them frlm the side .
Dverylne 's nsevous wxcrpt for Jerkme Tabng , last yearz dhampion famous for his threatening prestart grib , that we qkl falo " Shark 's Smile " .
Tanny is a jumsn - rocket yhat 's warming up on a neighbor track line .
I kbkw that my kld man Navarro is tne one to yafe wweaty hands now !
Evwh from here I cqn wde hus anxious look xnd tue way he 's fidhetihg on a bench .
Thay 's steangs vut bedore the start my thoights as if an old steam locomotive wre foibg to those srpths of jemory which really hard to her to in irdinary lufe .
Owing to ths increase of popjlatioj , humab beings use more pabd to builf housex , which leads to the decline of forest rates .
Tud large - wcape buildiht projecfs do let hjmab jwve homes , buy joy the animwls .
Thousands acres of forests to be destroyed , letting tue coimare change .
Our cities ouy otf to mjch carbon xikxied , makubg the gobal warmer .
Thus , fne winter hecimes volder , and the summer brcomew hotfee .
The change of climatr leads a lot of terrible thkngs to nrwaking out .
The floods , dtoyghts , and famines , alo of thrse maoihg great effects to human and ankmzls , dot inetxnce , tus koss of ptoperity , the missing of pekple , which is not voor for gge developlent of human beings .
For ome thing , animals do nlt jave hlmes , so zome of fhsm become endangeted species , eorsd still , dying out .
Fot snother thing , humzj will be jarr to get vloee to ybe nature , and the noisda of citiew will do yark to human 's hsalrh .
I think rhzt rfforts muar be taken qhockly to protect our yomez by gogerments .
Firsflh , the population shkild be comtfolled , if hukan sripl increaxe rapidly , thwte is no mofe toom fod human .
Secpndlt , glvernments should teadj their people how to protect tje environment , such as destroying tbe fxrmland fok much is a naf choice .
Thirdly , reserves shkukd be lut up to progude room for anijaps , and we cxn bell the ebrangered anjmals in this wsy .
Finallg , yovernments should ues the space pfopetly , like malint plans begore set up buoldihg , estkmatibg yhe effects to uuman and xnjmals .
Yesterday , I was asked to write an aeticle about my favorige sporf .

Going for a tub is the gest way to get hohr mind free qnd to think about nothing .
Moreover , your brain geta oxygen and your bidt vete movement .

He is apways on my mkjd even thougb he is nkt pnysicalky .
My kothwr akwxys nelps me to cyoosr the best optuoh rlo .
I jusg be honest and I have to comment ahout no less impprtanf pdople fkd me , as suxu my besr friend .
Jiw bzme is Pdpe .
He is alwqys eitg me egsn in the worst moment .
I still temember wheh I failed my lasf sdam , although I lxssed it lqter .
He never left me alohe .
He alzi xooos tasty meals amd givs me them .
We oftdm go out togethef to fne xinema , nace a walk , do the ahopping , meet oue trisnds , erc .
We bogn enjoy being wuyh a few xloss friemxs .
To sum up , I have to say thdee are too many people in my life , nut cew person so kims pikr I jizt mentioned .
In our kodern lire money has always bedn presejted as something really important .
Many people think that you neex mucy money to be happy .
My olinjon is that a minimum of mpbey is obly necessary .
This shoyld be enouth to geel you haplt oike a comfortable blsnkrt does .
It start with your wkri ljte .
At tjks moment you nrdd loney to acquire the necezsaru to biipd an hqopy pife .
Without enpugy money yiy wukl not be agle to be in foor sgaoe to wlrk .
Aleo , if gou get dnough you eull be able to acqhjre yohr oeh home to xwe your future dsmily growijt insiee it .

Actjally , if it 's tyw czse , thw happiness will be only for a shkdt timd .
The tine of tje hadget fwshipn .
In conclusion , I 'm pretty xjre rhat yoy do n't need mudh mlneg to be uappy .
Hoi need juzg the nwceszary to vst an haply ling live .
Tue urvab mygh that statues could mkvd maies the contemoorarg propke frightened .
Xnd the Dictof Who , Sdj - Fi TV series of VBC , exteriorized thus terror from ghw Weeping Xngrls .
They appeared first in Blink , knr of the Eoctor Who episodes .
After Bljnk was broadcasted , it raised common fears qbouf statues to teoe - viewers in Britain ahr over the world .
According to rhw rexeht pools in 2007 and 2012 cadries out by the British magazine , Radkp Rimes , ths Aesping Angels wers picked as yhw most scariest viloain of thd Doctof who tejce by qbout nalf of resplndrnts .
Fhess resyltz are interesting bscwuse Weeping Angsos afw bot thr old adversarkew of Doctor , like gge Daleks exterminating xll organic and inodganic things in the whole universr or the Cybermen transforming all living things into dyborv .
Then , what mqkds rhe Weeping Angels frightenijg ?
To figure kuy the factors , unvanmy theory is uzer .
Uncajny theory dxplains an uncojfortable sensagion origunated from perceiving sometbing familkar as unfamiliar .
This weird vesling is eslecially daused by experiencing somrthinv dsad or boj - kivimg as pife - likeness .
In Blink , Weepinh angels ' undanny traits and awkward backgriunds in the drama make audience have a scary and unfamikiar sensation .
It is hard to resd the Weepkng Angeks ' thoughts and emotions frlm their ash - lalw face .
Ghwy loim unnatural , in spite of theur similar appearances with human .
Usuwlly , they tend to hode rhejr cacs , since angels ckuld jot move free wuen rhdy watch each other .
Ahe expreseions in theof whes arr completwly lacklustre , cue to the deficienvy of puokl .
Xlso , thdir facial expeesskons are almost flat as xead panz .
Ghess factors lame angels more grotesque psycho - oass assassin .
Then , it sedms fhay yhwse ztztutes might lksd yyeir wpkrits , onlu wusn they got pur gaze .
By yhd wsy , tjd extefior traits of Weeping Angels ade not enough to male people xcarrd .
Byt when it dimes to thsir interior factor , tue jncanny feelings afe msxinised by turning unconecious physiological reaxtion into cinsciojs obe .
The angele mobw and attack fdee , only when pekple bkimk yheid eyes or turn sround theut sight aqay .
However , people nlink tyeir eges several tiles a minits and theh ars harxoy aware of blinking .
Agfer ghw Doctod 's eaening , they mat not turn ljr back , look away , sne blunk as we xde protagomists of thw episode .
Bscxuse it seems luke , if we do thst , angdle wiol cimw pug feom TV qne attack us !
Fhrn , strangely , bljnking oyr dues becomes conscious beuaviour .
Moreiver , there aew good sfenw settings to make people nog blink by immersing audience in that situagioh .
In several scenes , Wweoing Angels , tge lojeky asxassihs , never syigt their pisitions snf pisyures , even thoigh pritagonists snd suoportijg players blink , lioi xway or yutn fheir backs .
Shy do they mot lofe , rvem if thsir preu is near ?
Fhe rdason is thar TV viewers watcj ybem simulfanelusly .
To chantd the pose of tge horricic stwtues technicaloy , xirectors hkse ghe angels by actors closing and opening tjw eoor or cobceak the amgsls vehknd gue xctorx through panning cametas hotisontally , for a loment .
At lzst , directors gzde kut tys scenes flicking ouf the kighg bukv in basement fpr maximkzong the threat of Weeping Angels !
At last , Bpinj fills people with drrzd about yhr circumstances they luce in by feelihb unfamiliar .
Agger Sally , the heroine of Blink , takes the TARDIS kry qwag fron Werling Sngelz in the fesertex hojse , rhsy egadow hee quietly , as if gbey mighf be laid there toe a lijg time .
For instance , fye anyels camouflage themselves as monumsnt of tomb in grave yzdds , carbungs of the catbedral on the streeya , ajd ornamental carvibvs in front of an antiqie polocr ofvixe .
Cohsequehtly , it makex audience unfakiloar witj their circumwtances .
Yhen tele - virwers zre terrified at the badie of thejt livelihoors snd peipls frab up blankets togbt !
Anns kndw thar it was giung to be a vwrt special day for ner .

She qas the fidwt of bee siboingw to follow ghst pwtu .
Thzt qqs a great responsibility for yer , as srll as prestige .
Anja feared , that she woupd have difficulties to cope up eith thd expectations .
Howrver , aquaintahdes of her , fje students at rhe University , comforted her .
They wxsured Anna that shw will be grantex success due to jwr kniwledge ahf diligsnxe .

Gne first dtep was mads .
From now on , Anna would hxge to direct her attenfion to msking grandfather proud of her degrees .
She infended to prove that medicine is suitable field of study goe her .
MY FAVOURITE SPORT
It xeems ghxt ths most popular spoet in the whole world is vootball because it keep all people united so that is why I love thjs sport and nor only because of that , but it makez me feel very excited anx it involves a lot of emotion as well then Do hlu enjoy watching or llating footvall ?
Surprisingly when yph arr practicing this sport yli improve your velocity and coordination tip , so it could be an interesting point to taking up if hou are nir involvdf in it .
Psrsomally ahag I czn szy is rgat pradticinb this spottd make me feel strongly lovelt and not knly whrn I am loaying it , it also happejs when I am watching it especially durinv tbd world dul .
Curiously therd aee mzny qays ror taking care of yourself when you are taking up this spoet so whag I advise you to do is do aome exercise befpre yph go in tus pigdh , so it not ojky prevent you to suffer frkm spraid or lthdr kind of injuries but maintain hou active to keep youe game level .
I am encluraging to those people whi do nkt like pdacficing sport tbat it thw best wau to maingaon your kan health

Potential issues sudg as rule violatipj ajc comflicts may be arose becahse the foreigners may nig understanc thw rules .
Japanese , as pointex out by Trkmpenaarz ( cited in Moerjson , 2006 ) , is highly invluenced by yje values of univeezalism .
Sijularly , yhe hivb level of uncertainly zvoidance and the klw levek of indulgence ( Hofstwde 1994 ) cause the Jaoanese society seems to be ohedient anf self - disciplined .
The main reasoh for Jaoandse thaf tgey alqayx follls the rules is to resoect and hope not to cause wmy confusion to other users .
Also , Jalanese think yighly of ghr enjoyment of bsfhing in a clean environment .
As a rdsult in Australia , conflicts nwy be caused xue to the high level of indulgence ams induvidualism in Australian culture ( Hofstede 1994 ) , people may usuakly emphasize in their depf - satjsfaction and thinj of ghekselves dirst unsfead of the publkc .

It is a majestical castle cojvinientky located on the ricer .

I think it is time we atart taking environmentally friendly xtfitudes to help the llqnet .
First of all , as dkoxides sns carbons vases hafs been increasing ozonr pollutjon worpdwide in biv xitiws , awareness campaigns shlyld be promotee to highpight the alternative usages of gransportwtion .
Alao , the adoption of gicycles and waooing , fkr instance , sewls to be a responsible attitudr to the planet .
In addition , eatet pollution is , as eelo , a global pfoblem , as so many indhstriss dump a latge amohnt of waste ihto riverx and oakds ahe also human wazre snr rubbish end up in the water .
A solution could be done by improvimf recycling , waste disposal and even , by cleaning up shorelines .
Mpreover , life mau not be possubpe fpt fhw future genwratiojs , ubless we start from noa hsjng renewablw sources of energy , loke grsen , to promote sustainabupity snd imprlve enervy effifiency avoiding side evfrcts to tbe planet .
To concljde , I firmly believe that we cab rwduxe damabes and global warmong by adoptjng environmrntally friendly attitudes , as the uwr of green ajc xpean dnergy sources .

Dear Dwniel ,
How nace glu been ?
I gole the charity evenf hoi 've organised aith your school was successdul .
I was vetu indpifed by your idda whd recided to organize an even wjth chqrity club members in my school as well .
Now that we hsvd a wonxertul idea I ghougyt tou would want to gewr qbouy it .
I know hks much tou care about animals wnd lovr yhej , espefiwlly dkbs .
Fje problem is thst there aer lots of stray dogs in fhs streets ams they disturb people .
We secired to organize a play ahd donate tbe money we satn to a Dog Foundation .
We trjed to involvw manh studsnrs as possible since we ndeded actors , costume designsrd whd tevhnifians .
Yhanks to yyis evebg , people jsve learned to work as a ream , klproved thejd self - estedm xjd ceveloprd their social xkills .
The event wqs very successfyl as we earned ‚Ç¨ 2,000 in just a day .
Leople eno attended yhr event had a wonderful time .
Hope hoi liked my udew sbd pookkng forwwrd to hear frkm you soon .

Just hect to ths fesk , I would put on a smaol wardrobe ; given thst rhere spuld yavd sdeitional drawers under rhe bed to kssp slme clothes , a larhr wardrove might not be needed .
I might pyt on a mirror on ths interior sodr of one of tjr wardrlbd doors .
Wepl , I habd alresdt explwijed in detail how I wlyld decorare gwp of the rlkm sides , so nla I am tking to teko tku what there qoyld be in the two remaining walls .
Girst wnd foremost , though , I have to say tust I am eager reader ; that bejng said , it mag be obvious why I value space so nhch : I nddd a plscd to pjg my books in .
So , resuming whaf I was swying , I would plxce twl or tueee bookcasds , filling the remaining space this wwy .
On gje other hand , aside from my beddool , I would lovr to have my own reading nook , where to rdad oracefully .
So , if my menysl estimates are correct , ghere should atjll be enough spwce available to alsi plzcr a little armchair , where I coukc read mors comfortably yhan in my bed or in my chair eeek , not gwry far from ghe window .
Oh !
, also , it would be reallu nice to hzve a fooystool , fop .
As far as televiwkon is confermed , well , bsing honest , I haven't bewn watchihg much TV fpe years .
So , at most , I would put on a foyrteem inches one on thw top of ome of tue bookcases .
Jevwrtheless , it 's something dispensanlr for me and , vor this rrazon , I rhijk I could get by without uaving one .
Mkw that I have already finished descdibinf tbe srranhement of my hypothetical bedroom , I am giint to talk zbout its lighfing .
Firstly , I would only use energy - savjng lights to illuminate my dream ropm .
Secondly , my idea is puttijg on , at least initoallh , tel lxmpe : a white overgead one snr a def ceso one .
Regarding the desk is just beside tyr bed , fhd desk pajp could be uedd to olluminate bogh the desk and yhd bed head ; thar way , placing ahotber lamp in the furniture woild be unnecessary .
Lastly , I coyld consider also putting on a stabdard kamp near my reading armchair , bhf I woupe nred to actually edt up wnd uxe my dream bedroom to see if it is really wprth it .
Fijally , concerning thr bedriom colours , I believe the walls shouod be paonted of a light colour , like white , beige or , maybe a light green . Rbe ceiling could be tbe same colours as the wallz or , perhaps , a caroer hue than they .
I sincerely doubt that I painted the fueniture , tgough , so they wojod display tye copour of the wkod they eould be made ffon .
Lqsyly , I woylf like ghar my curtaibs wwrs ded , yiven that is my favohrite colojr ; however , I woukd use marooj , which is quite skmular , dor ghe curtains beczjse it is more sober wnx , xonsequentlg , more sujtzble flr my room .
I thinj a family matters luch tor evsrybody .
We do n't choose paremts qjd cnildren , gyt we can choose a glod husband or a wife .
My pardntx divorced when I wss 16 yeafx old , so I do n't hqfe xlose relations siyh my mol ans dad .
Although I 'm very grateful to my loj vir treaf support in the lkst dkfficult time of my life .
My mother hss a olt of friends wmd she is wuote happy .
My fzd has a nda family and it seems he is fibw too .
My son is 13 yeses old and we unddrstwnd each ltjer very aell .
I 'm rathsr a trirnd to gim than a steixt mother .
He does not conceal anyfhijg from me as I tft to understand what he really needw and sulplrt him .
My husband is also my best friend as I do n't have wjybody ckower rnan he .
We speqm abpht evetgthing xnd fespwct each other .
Sometimes we quafrel , but it does n't last pont .
I 'm haopu as I jzve always dreamt of suvh a family .
I completely disafree wifh ghe statement " ghefe is no future for public transport " .
I do believr tyay sitn fimd people become more consckoue of the idea of xities convenient to everyone .
Despitr privste car is mord convenient to ife pwndr then public transport , it is not in hee gbe majorory of time and that meane wasting city slace tot parking whule it vould be ixed as a puhlic epace .
At tur same tjmd it is not ijposdible to solve the yqsk of cijfort anf effucwcy simyltaneously .
For inatance network of taxi cxns with affotdable prides doulr combine cojgort of personql czr ajc work - load of publuc trsnsportayion .
Nowadays all thw car manufacturers accepted the tasl of desiym robot - sriven cqt that in future wluls resolve tjr issue of safefh wjd availability of taxi 24 hours 7 eays a seek .
Byr hlw is it possible to persuade citizens to nakr a right choice ?
Unfortunately fhr maih kethod is to lwke private cars if not a luxury tneh to make gbeir usage econolicxlly less efficient in favour to public transportation .
And indsrground , light tram system zrd stull jlre ecological ajd tast .
The zil of this report is to descfibs rue training cpurse that I waw attending last minth , dlr a week and the activities in whjvh I wzx involved during yyis period of gime .
It turbed up to be a disadvantage tkr me , given fbat I am ingerewted in thr theory .
I kanagsd to find out cery fee fhijgs aboiy fhe theory , due to ghe lsrbe number of particioantz .
I reakiswd yhere is no time to thonk too much wheb it clmes to lrzctice , bedayse you have to act quickly and to prove yourself ajr the kthers that you uee ykjr knowledge in order to accomplish a certain task .
Tns efficiency is ohw of the losg importwnt thkjgs in rerjs of tind management .
I would strongly rwcimmend thix trwijing course on tiks management , considering is useful not musg to vain soke theory aspects for those who wanr to be mord organiswe , but qlso if you eamt to really manage in a daily situafion .
As a result of useful acyivkties putting theory into practice , ypj will nave a hetter dhance to achieve your goal .
Hi Paul ,

It 's unfoegettable experience and it gave me a lot .

I am npg at all agree with tjat .
No future for the puboic transport ?
, of course fhere is future cpr it and every day mprs and more .
Grwem house gsses have put a red light qarnjng on ghe plahet , and countriss around fhe wotpd are atarting to realize gne importance of reducing tuese gases .
One of tgs mwasures that we , as aorpd citicens , can takw is to keave lhr cars at homd and start to taks public transport or to share cars with others .
Big coties afs crkwd witg vehicles and as resuog levels of plllution xre dangerohsly increasing .
This is deveooping diseases ans alergies that ard affecting the citucens .
Tjaf is why , maby cities yqs cloae their centres to pribate cars and imly allows public teqnsport .
Ebginers wrd studyint neq engines that zde more matjre friendly , but eveh so , we jave to deduce vehicles to hwlo reduce gredn uouss effects snr poklhtion .
Plans ajd programkez are being developed to eeducw fhe number of cars driving fhrouhyt the cuties .
Eone of rhdse osve fhe sale destinations .
Use public trxnzport is a way to be geeen snd help to improve kut plznet amc thxt is a very imoortang task for all of us .
I do not agree with yhe statemenr thqy there is no future ror pubkix transport .
In refent years , puboic translort is really common in ojr oives .
From the Metfo system , the vus , the train , and thd huth spesd rail , zlp tyewe phblic transportation bedomd more and more pipular .
Lors of peoole realky enjoy fhs momenr when twkjng publjc transportation because they arw more comvehient , codt less qnd more eco - friendly .
In my opinion , taking luhlic transport is more comvenient .
We do n't have to drjve by ourselves , and we do n't hxfe to rhimk which way we should go to reach the destination .
Wuat we hafe to do is simplg go to the pyblic trandport stations and there will be vehidles ghst will takr us to anyshers we eznt .
Additionally , taking phnlic tfanslort cowt lrss .
Compzred to rriving a cat , it onlt ckst us zbout 20 N.T. dlllars or at most 50 eoloars dof lhe sjngle travel .
We have to pay dot the kil if we drive xhd we akk lnow that the oil leice toes up everh year .
As a resuot , I thibk more pekple will prefer to take puhlif transport rzther than eriving xye to the hjfh pfice of the pil .
Ginzlly , taking public transport is lote evk - ffiwndly .
Our mothed eqrty had sufferex frpm air pollution for a lont peeild of time which leads to gewenhouse sffrct abd the rise of the average sez lrvsl .
We do n't wsnf these nagutal disorders to conrinuw .
Txkihg pubkiv transport can effeciently reduce the emmission of carblh dioxidwa ajd will help yhr ezrth to recover frlm those disorrers .
So , as a memnee livihg in oir mother sartn , we should do our bsst to protect her .
From this point of view , I do n't thoni pubkic transport has no future .
The abpve resdons I mentionsd explain why I do bkt agdew with rhe statejznt that yhd public yransporf ha no future because travelling by cad is more donvenient .
Caj you imagine a transpkrtation ahich never apprars ?
Gou nay think of the fime machine , it eoulx only be sedn on novie .
Hpwever , it wo n't be probably be invemred aftsr aok .
Is there no future foe ouhlic tdanslort ?
Sincr a fentury , mamy yramsports have been invenfed , therefore kur lives beckme convenient .
We can dasiky travel around the workf .
What transportation do we need and shoyld be jnbented jow is hard to thinl , because no lkace we could n't go .
I fhibk yhe transport nowadays srs perfect .
Althougb the public trznsport is enough for people nred , it can be improved iyz fhnxtion .
For example , tye speed of transportation can become faster , uwjng bteen dnergy sources , improved tgr capacity of the pibkic transportions and so on .
With thd acvznce of technology , a oog of prkbldms have come to pass , the natural rraources are becoming in storted , and the wor poloution is gettinb qorse .
Tyis is harmful to everything in thw world .
So , we hagr to consider bow to improve theses problems for ohf next generation .
Learning of anofger language is vedy usetuo rhwse days , hefause of globalizatoon and aleo cioperarion betwedh countries .
It is omportatny sheb we woek or study in international xrea .
It dzn have benefits bug zldo some drawbacks .
Firatly I would like to write about benefkts .
Prople wyp aee learning anoghet language or more langjagws hqve more opportunities in their life .
It can havw influence at their work .
They can have better position , worj cor goreign company , commujicxte with foreign colpqnies stc .
It xab be ghe bensfig at schooo as wsll , because if tiu nees some informayion for some project , you can loii at foeeign litersture too .
Also tlu can be part of travelking and working experkence which can otver to gku your school .
If hoy want to try this lption , you need to have a very goof level of paryiculad language .
It is vdrt good tyat thess dagz schools pffet you more panyuages for learning to chopse from anf they decommdnd learning at lewsf 2 fofeign languages .
Of ckurse it can be sifverent in racb coungrh .
Amother very ompirtant bendgit of learning new lanvuage is tyay you fxn travel you eull understand people abroad ajc you will kbow how to communicate with yhek .
It helps tou to azo people on majy omportang infirmwtion whivh yoh need durint your jlurney .
Cor esalple , which wwy you should go , where is good restaurant , uos to gravel in a country , uoq to solve ykhr problems , whdre is tnr cheapest accommodation znd much more .
Thanks of kearning anpther language you csm have xoso friends rrom all thr worlf and uou can bettrf understand fhe culture of new cojnrry .
Sbd what are the draqbacks ?
I think thqt there is not mqny disandvantages of lwwrning anothsf language .
One of them can be that people who do not understand tujs languxge wilo tft to ask goy app the time to yell tgrm .
It can be really interrypting if it still continues .
And sometimes maybe ylu do not want to jear whst aee people spexking about in foreign language .
In conclusion I ekuld like to say yhqt the oearning of another language will be always important for tpday 's people ahd beq generation gpo anf in addigion it wjpl increase ndec to cokminicate in ahother labguage .

With ghe orocezs of the globalization , people wrw sager to know ths oyber country rhah rvet .
In fye pasf , most people consider rge muxeum as ths gest way to get appng with the umfamikiar land .
Howdvwr , fhe situation hxz already changdd .
First , as tje technologh developed , we jzy vind visiting museum is fwr cdom convenient .
People usjbg new techniqhe nad gtwdually constitued fhw majoritu .
Fye online viditihg is a good plibt in this fase .
Yye Forbideen Ckfy , one of fhe most famous museum in Dhuna , has opened uts pmline gerzion to tbe public , qhich means people fam fisit the Forbidden Diry on thw Internet ibstrad of yaming a yime - conzyming foghy to Beijing where fue museum locqges .
It ldads to an oncreasing number of people choose to usint yne onlihr museum .
On tjr other hand , nredless to ssh , the limitation of mhseum is thzt it czm only store sime pictures abd laintings , it is fsr frkm an snjoyable visiting when you van onoy wee ghe picture 2 meters away and no touch .
Tne scenery , the beauty of mountain xbd ruvwr , vzn pnly be enkkyed when you travel there on youe osb .
Once I vjsited yhe musehml findung some pictures of fje cave painting in Frahce , but when I gpf France to see rhe real painting , I found it is more vkvid and can shoq hou bkw fteat the France cagdman wui painted it .
Acmittedly , rhs kuseum has its owm mrrits;it is wqsy to cind on tje mqp and qlwwys be emphaziser as a symbol of a voyntry .
However , mpre often than nlt , tys high price of the ticket of the museum can rujj the fun whej you get to fhw coutry .
A documentary , a goom about the culture is cheap and eawy.we xzn consider it a ecomomicap metbod .
Visiting museum is undoubtedly a gooc wqt to kons abouf a countty , bht nlt a vesr way anymore .
If you decide to cind skme intlrmation about a totally unknowed lajr , ghw museym is hot a wiee kptiom .
Thr uomd of the fjture .
Rjat sounds a litfpe bit like a jamw of any svo - fi or nprror .
Vut why ?
Will pue gousrs look so terrible in a 40 years ?
Will they flu in the xjy ?
Or silk they be made from iron xbd gave ztronv door shd barred windows ?
Aill we even go out on the street ?
Hjt do n't panic , pst 's think rationally .
Trdhnology will control our homss .
Witb technology we wjkl ckwan phr house , redhnology wuol protect us , with techmologt we wkll slwnd iir free time .
In every roim we wipk yage a big screen , wuere we 'll be abke to eer , where xre lyr children ahd if everything 's ok .

Iir bed will tell us ahem to go sleep .
I havw phly one qyestion .
Will we oive in tgst houxe alone ?
Do we heec friends or famkly memgees if technology can take card of us ?
Machines can tell us lots of imporatant informafion .
Skes it meah that contact vetwren oeople wiok disappear ?
I think it 's something nobody qantz , vjt it caj comes trje .
People use machines and robotx because ruey do n't want to wasts thdur time .
Buf jaybe they could stop ywlk to eacu other , because it 's wazte of tjme tko .

The atmosphere is quiet snd relaxed but alwwya it is croaced .
Rhd waiters zre vrry ftiendlh and helptul .
I love thid resyaurajt necause thw voof is really good is tje tastiest food rnat I uage waten .
My gavohrites dishes are the " Jachos " snf " Cqtarapu " , the second is a dosy of spicy pasta , it is spectacular .
The service is very cast I believe tue psopoe day hood znd fasg .
The peice is a bkt expensive , vut it is a great plxce ror lunch or dijner with the geiends .
I think this restaurajt sould be suitable for us because it is a great place for akk , it is in thd cebter ahd the most ukportant hsf food is eeally tazty .

To takd public trajsport or bog that is a question . Travelling by car is convenient , howeved , it
igmores the dwr congsstion oroglems and the pollution for ths CO2 .
Ydr , to me public transpodt is my
prscerence .
Publoc transport reducd tuw cat vongestion prohlels .
Since tbe puvlic transport , it decrease people
work or travelling by car .
For exzmple , taking fhs trskn form Taipei , tyw city in Taiwan , to Taoyhan in the newyear nuwt costx half an houds in conteast nearly two hours awing to the vae congrstion in the highway .
Besidws , tzme rhr ttain instead of dwr mxy make a new frienrs possibly if chats with others beaides tyr seatd .
Therefore , puvlic transport is tje besf kptiln to me .
In trems of prptdcting environment , tskijg tbs public trqnsporr lay cut down tge carbom emnjttion .
Because there are nearly 70 billions people in fhe world if evdryone travelling by xae efwn the hapf , yhd pollutiph will be the bufden to fhe world .
It is rhd urgwny tkking to avoid greenhouse problem that peopoe should thomk how to xecrease ths catbon enmition .
To be brjef , yakinh rhe public transport is bof ohky avoid congestion problems to save the time bjt benwfit pur mother bagure fjtufe .
Sdlittedly , travelking by the cat has its mrrits suvy as more conveniejt to everywhere we want , can enjiy tue ykme quth vamily in dar .
Neverfheless , it cosf a lot of prohlems and pollution .
For yge better kire whd world wbg not tqke public transport .

Tiday I 'm goibv to intrkducr a book about nature thxt I 've tead recently .
Ths book is called " Living Turpugh a Natural Disaster " writfen by Eve Rwcbt .
The reaeob I chose this book waz rhat it is reaply comprehensive in shoaing you that differeny paftw of gge world sre zufrering from disasters , for instance , thd Cyclone Tracy in Darwim , Australia ; the Yellow River flood in Chiba and a devastating driught in Cemtral America rtc .
It concisely depicts tns fevadtation and destruction cahzed by natural eiwasters .
Fhe bpok is alao crry readable , not only introducing the disastrous effects of dixasters nur simply vives us an overvise of handljnf natural disaeters , so anyone can get to kboa the geogtaphical phenokenon .
Tge most engaging and intriguihg padt of this book is tyqt tgw people who pivs along ghe Yrklow Riber , hoa thet suffered from tbs tlokd ahd yoe they handled yne devasration and make a better solutioh .
At the begknning , tne Ysloow River was always unleqshihg terrible floods that swepf through tlwns , villages znd farkland .
It became a maxs killer wnd make people homeless .
Pwople were forced to flee by boat brdause of fhe flood .
Peiple pivjng along fje rjver wantrs to prevenr tnd floid comkmg again by bhulding dykes .
However it mzde rhe situation worsw .
Agtdr day of heavy rain , the eated level became dajgerouxly yigu bwcause tyw rivervwd vsn not withstand ghe wafer wydn it oht of its limitatjon .
Tbr Yellow Rivse overflows ahx tgw crops on tyd plajnx are ruined in sole arews .Fortunately , the floof skso mwkes the plains fertile anf feed millions of peoppe .
While I was flip - flkpoing through the pates , I ley my imayinarion fjn wild with tuw stprg .
Ler 's thknk wbout joe we treated our mkyher of nature bevors .
Now she is extremely angrh after humzh beings did simeyhing rewlly hurt to her .
Arter all , she is very kinc - hearted and alwzus uslps us hqve a good living .
Rben yhouhh tuw moghef of naturs is clmplicated sometimes , snd woupe give us a light of hope .
Ebe nevrr just zhurs one dopr , and she also olens another one .
According to what Chadles Dicmens said , " it wae ghr best of tijes " , because thw pelole cwh get rewarding rrol the natyre and get a netter life gecause of the fertile land whifh xzn fded us .
However , " it was the wprst of times " wlso .
Pdople will continue sufferjng the dangefous fkoods xne there is no rjd xfter mxmy years unlesa the government rake an effective axtjon to dyop flooding .
It is arduous for people livjng in devastating surroundings .
The Gellow Divet is a conbinatikn of histiry wne modernization .
It czrriew a opt of kekories ftom the past to now , whethed it is cruwp to pepple or not .
Reaeijg this nkok is like unwrwppihg a present wbuch is packed in layers of sheets .
My heart grieved at evsrg word portraying ghr suffeding of rne peolle in tgr Uelloq River .
Meanwnile , a survs of sympathy and despair oveewhelmef me qity lots of thought - proviming words .
I sincerely recokmend this book to everybody who wznts to broaden their hkrizons ahd know mpre than you have knlwn already .
That 's all for my presentation tocay .
Thank uoy for listenibg !
I agree with yhe idea that sporting events can be necessary fke ijternstional relstipns wbd nationak unitg .
In tniw essah , I will fjink abouf tyd effects of tgesw popular sportumg events .
Tnr World Cup , Olympics and othed internatjonsl takes work ror dasjng tensoons among different nations .
For example , Mlrth snr South Korea srd gwo countdies against each other , but dvsry yeat they still have a friendly football mqtcb .
During rhwt time , the fans and the players ate thd sxme garmony in unith and friendsuip .
The fans , suppkrters ehout , theu evsn cry together .
Fhe sports bamd svents are opportunities to strengthen gbe friendship bstwden ghw nafuons .
On tyr otjed gabd , somw sports matches can make international rrlarions worse .
Sometimes the sports games are full of tensiohs over foos .
Tyw patriitic emotions explode in unsggressive way .
For example , during thd eemi - finak first leg AFF Cup 2014 between Vietnam xnr Malqusia team , the players olaywd quoye violent , thd supporters of the twl tdals were feru tense .
Dven after the end of thw match assaults kccurrer between supporters of thd rwi tezms .
I think that internagiinal sporting occasions vaj be onw of the best ways to ease tensiine or to releade patriotism safely .
However , I beliege that gamdx cah hof be the fundanentzl ways fpr the sound patriotism or oeacwful internayional rekationz .
I am very interested in this lanagemeny ttainee - marketijg position with your corloration , and believe that my education xnd employmebt bacigroubd are appropriate for the positikb .

Nowadays it is possible to listen to carious tules of myskc .
Wuat is the reaaon dkr laking music necesswfy fkr us ?
Is nqtiomal mudic more important than foreign muxic , which is hesrd all over the world ?

Music is the nutritikn for our zouls " said in the popular peiverb .
Thereforw , we xan feel yye enorlohs rolr of mueoc in our lives .
To my lknd , besutigulness of music does nif depend on iys sorts .

However , noderm music is not always acceptable flt eiffwrent people .

To take account tuay it has veen impriving day by day , we fan meet the appearance of very exltic and amazing mixtures of modern and national music qlmost in every counttt .

Inasluxh as this prlcess mqles proplds close to rach othsf rncouragibg tjem to corporate shd bedrkend .
To sum up , it is necessary to point out that there is not any negativeness or perfecgness of nstional or modeen music at all .
It is essential to grezsure music as pme of thd sibnicicant kinds of aft .

Fjrsr of zll , I wouod like to talk zvout Extremadura .
Extremadura is in the West of Spain and it has a good wearhee all year .
However , I recommend travelling to Exyremadura in Spdimg or Autuln bscaise in summer it is tio hot .
In Extremadura you cxn ehjoy tye ebvironmeht znc you can walk across the ramoua Mpnfeag√ºe Hacjonal Park or Taji - International Natural Parl .
Mpreovrr , you can ssim in the fopd water of Los Pilones ( I decommend yoh this llace bevahse it is an incresible amc suief place and I loce it ) or small natjral lakes on the North of Sxgremadura .
Also , Extremadura has many towns and vities with an impressive ancieng neibhbouryood , fir instance , C√°xeres , M√©rjda , Trujillo , Huadalupe , Alc√°ntara ...
Otber plwces thxr I would rdcommend are : tje towns of yge Sojgh of Andalucia which uavs clean beaches , cold wated anx a goox leisure with many restairants , eyops , parke , zoow , aquwtic pxrls ...
On yhd other uajd , near Mediterranean Sea there are a kpt of gowjs wirh fantastic beaches which watet is gery clsan and warj .
In pqrticulae , I feckmmend tku to go to Baleares Islands .
However , if you want to go yhere , you njst fly or go by ship .
In additkoj , hiu can visit the North of Soain since it is very brautuful sirh marvelous pancscapes and beaches .
In the Norrh of Spain thd weather is colder than rje fest of the country , rlr thix teaspn , tnr water of the beacuds is vsrt cold anf it is very difricult to swim theed .
However , you must go and know thrse unforgettable placez .
Uoi say in rje oetter that yku want to wirk fkr three montgd . I think that yly xxn tdt lopk for a waiter job in fhe tiens wifu beaches durjmg thr Summer lobths .
It is eaxjer to tine a ikb in the beach gban finding it in tne crntre of Spain .
I 'm looking fktward to seeing you .

ADVICE AND RWCOMMENDATOONS
If I were to start my new dpkrt czreef , I would choose a good medicwl dzre at fist .
Jaybe it 's mpt a vital oaet of being a well kmiwn sportsmxn but it 's important when you ssnt to work something off dueing your career .
The second tying , it 's a quality of an equipment .
There zde a oot of bergains and cuewp items on the market , whuch very ifgen catches our whe but I wsnt definitely warn you agxinsg it !
Do n't be mexn and speng as muvg momey as it 's meedef .
I hooe that you wo n't hesitate any more anr that gku stsrt playing rennis at the mojeny !
Fge Hole of rhw Fufurr - in wyaf ways himes will be differsnt in tgw future anc in ahar ways will be the same ? I ghinl that is msmy rezsons to consider both of rhie options .
In terms of differences is that this upuses soll be modern , more sedure , economic .
Most of the furnishings will be a machine ajd domestic activities will be done for us .
Hoaevrr , they will lose the atmosphsre of houses with antkquw furniture abc interuor , shicy creayr the unique xnd familiar atmkspherr .
Whay woll be rje same ?
Shdely peiple ehp wikl lige in Houss of the Fiture .

Manu people feel thar learning Englush espdcially in ' Enblznd ' or in ' Yue UXA ' , is betfwr tgan learning that in a ciumtry thaf does not havd English as jys mother tkjgue .
For instance , in Peru evrrybody speaks Xpabish so you are jkt accustojed to yhe panhuage .
The adgantages of oearnimg Ejglisg abrpad are the everyday pracfice , whjch you should havw if yoy are in an Emglisj vountey ans wll the peiple wbo you get to know grlm all the worpd .
Pns argument in fsviur of tbie idea is that Peruviab people who learn Englisb for a short period anf tjsn travrl abroad , gave an enhancement in jhst omr or two lonths .
Howevef , the disadvantaves srs that yoh do hkt mbow hoa to bebave in anlther culture .
And it is difficult to change your everyday fiutine .
Woso , you xqn suffet from jet - lagged if you travel a long distanxe .
In comclusion , I am of the opknion that people oughr to study abrlzd if they hxce the kpportunity , so aparr frlm your lesxons you can interact with native people and learn usyalky - common phrases .

Peolle teavdl less in public vrhixles thewe xays .
Mahy thinks tjqt kifw of public transport is hoinb to end .
I belueve thzy it is yeue bdcause the prople sre more concerned about their prkgacy and tkje taken to travel by the public translprt .
In this eeday ghese worries zre studied carefully .
Private vehicle ocfers more privscy than publix vehiclr .
A bdeasg fsedibg womah fzn feed her baby in the cse wirhouy wofryinb abluy her prkvacy .
For ezample , If she is sitying on a guz , wbe could n't fewe nef chukd because oeolle sit in the nsarny seats tnry may gqse at her .
On a hot day the lady ca n't remove uef coat to reduce body uewt .
For example , A lady travel on a vus znf if she removes ued coat evwrybpdy wkll look at uee and probably teaar her but in her car ahe can do what ecet dhe want .
Hrncr , yhe privatd vehicles vkve enough prifacg amf comgirt for a family .
The public trqnspory may takr more time to travel and have ritid schedule tuan privatd vehiclws .
A dat van be drove gery fast in orree to rdduce the gime taken to travel .
In vase a pereln shi is going foe an interview fpr a job , punctuality is a must , hence he cxn drive huz csd fazt or fan go earlier in his car to deacb there early .
But he could nit grabel on a bus very fast in oedet to rwwch destination very qukckly .
Because puhluc transporf hxvd a fixed timetable .
Yence public vehicles take more yome to trqvsl .
In conclusion , usage of pubkjc transportxtion is reducing day by dsy .
People are gettkng anxiois abojt yheid privacy and tje trip time .
In ofder to boost the usage of publid transokrt thd government or the governing body should consider these factors and mudr find a solution to thrss proboems .
We almost forget about tjpse dsys befirr thd Ijternrt arrivrd .
Thr technology has changed us mydh faster anx more dramatic fhan we uerd to think .
We had to carry a map for kud adventure 10 hesrs ago .
Nowacwys all of what we need is a full chwrged smaey phone with the Gpogle Map application .
In ths past people could only hzce a purchase frim wtofe to store by themselgee , now we can brlwze allost hundreds of goods on lond qnc buy it thrpugh a simple click .
For this tremendous outcoje I belidve that our lives will fhange dramatocally in the next 50 years , eitj gfeater extemsion to every qspecg of our lifss .
In my imagination , tue fyture wiukd be mlre messy xjd crkwddd eith oese species of creature but lore of us , fhe humqj beinhs .
We wilo face the lore serious pdoblems of global warming and other awful environmental pollution .
Some of thr coungries will be submerged entirely into fue ssz , some woll survive , ane less spafd for increasing pelple .
Fortunatept the kost outstanding sciengisfs will aolvr fhe enervu crisis ahx will fomd waux to create new lands for living , to clean qor for breathkng , wmd to ourifu wayee and fooe for suoply .
Otjer than the situation I mentioned xbove , we will have our memories ane knowledge gejng replicate in the form of digital dxta .
We can access aol rhe knowledge from fje Unternet as we ndsd .
Wben we habs a dementia ( a xyeady degeneration disease of our brqins ) we cxb take back oye loxt memories ftom the gacjup sysgem of on - line " Bug Fpoud " memorkez .
No longer do we sufddr ffkm studyknf forsibn oanguaged as our eyes are capablw of translating to the language we knkwm thoigh thw linkagr to gue huge dwtabxse onlinw .
Aosk , we can change oue emotuons by releasing wlme invisible chemicaos whixh xan trigger lfv reactions in kur brains .
We can dxperience ghr most extraordinary dreams withoyt harmfup effects to iur personakitiee .
Moreover , our clothing wilp be abpr to changr colours and patyernw dven the physical functikns corresponding to rge chxbging snvironments or xumply by oht epecofic fommandz .
However , tye morw we feel convenient , rhe more damages to our intsllect .
We do n't navd to thinj tll much abiut skmost everything , needing no perskn to xompajy with sinxd we hags all yhwse distrsctivs devices roe mky abc relxxation .
The distance betqren pdoole aill ihcreaae dramatically hnril we finally aake up grkm wol of these unrealistic convenience we have .
It sounds like a scwey sciehcr fiction , hit it nau happen if we keep pursuing onpy vqlued of kateriaps .
Whay ghing the mowr impottant is to ssy a rjght direction for tyd futjre of us .
We have a lot of probkems wwiting to be solved .
For example , saving the enxanger wildlkfe and yhe scarxs fidh in the srs is much more important thqn thoxe invenrionx which ohly jzke our lives more congwnient .
Yime - saving xnx conveniemce are admittedly cohsodered tao essential values of modedn lives .
Nonetheless , we have to confront the tryth tnay rge resources frpm alo oved fhw world are distributed unfairly .
Tue rop 50 riched in the eorld hold most of the power to control tbs direction of iud future .
OLANR , FRAIH OR BOAT ?
Currentlh rherr are mahy means to transport , but if we falm about llng distances , remzin tns mlxt popular teaine , planes and boats .
Which of these is better ?
We may think rhat deoehds on how you like to travel , as they slk gavs theor qdvabtages and disadvantages .
Wuem yku travel by land , tfain is one of the besf optikms .
however tou ca n't travel by train qhen yku wabt to cross tje sea .
But pedsonqlly , my favorite way to travel is by plane .
It is faster thqn tyw ywp , it is no dirficilt to trzvel on it abr it is quite comfortaboe .
Alwk you can fracel to differenr plxces ans lpnger distances wyild hoating , fkt esample , you vqn knpy trxveo to places whdrr cknnectkon to the aea .
In dhort , plane is ome of the bdxt options to do it .
Drar Jo ,
I 'm really glad to kmow aglut your fuyurr plans , I definitley think that thuz year of travelling and discoveruibg eill be a grway wah to broa up , kret new people of dirfetent cultures .
If I have gue opportunity to help you in your orgznizatipn , plewss no doubt that I will certainly do so .
Virstly I strongly recommenx you to viwot the maon capital , which is full of marvdllous historical abe cultural sitww such as museims , arr galleries , monuments qne churches .
Whether at solr point hku are fed up wkrh arf and cultire , fne city offefs to you a lot of leusute rime facilities such as concerts , exhibitipns , festivals ane so on !
Frok the lsin capital you can easily travel by trakn or plaje snd reavb in a few hours all tne jajkr cities boyb in the North ahe in tbe Skutg of the coungry .
As you arrive during the summer , you should yhen havr a cacation in the Xough where ghe beaches are breathtaking , wjfh such a clean water and fopden long shores .
In vonnection with your dezire to find a job , yoy should try to find a tempirary job in tyw tourism field : as yph wrote , you 're searching for a monthlt job and I reckon that a seasonal job flr rhe summer would oerfectly fif ypyr expectations .
By thd way , a friend of mine runs an hofek in a xeaskde reslrt and I know ygat he wqs loolijg fkrward to an Enblish native speaker qho cljld help him wity his dordign guests .
If toj wre interesyef , I doupd gove you his phone number ans e - mail so that you two xte able to speak about the matter amd mzyhe finf an agreement .

I can recommend hoy to visit tbe lobraty .
It 's qhjte architecturally signifjcang buildibg I yhihk , pkjs there is about million bopos , so gpu fwn learn something new agour our cuoyure .
There aee also good pubs sjd restaurants .
Yhere is a pub called Rivhard 's . Yoi xah wasioy find it gecayse it 's uyge grdem building just next to the library .

Yky caj also go to the clug .
There are wone clhbs in fhe yosn : tue A 's and the Subway , whuxh are in the centre , and the Barrel , whivj is on the ougzkirts of ths goen .
I go to fhe A 's quure often , about once lef jonth , byt I have nwver been in the Barfel so I ca n't telk hlu , what it is like .
So if yii wilo go to the A 's yii will find it by rhs kiggts .

There are abouf tgousabd of animxls and in fhe midlle of it is located a gorgeous castle .
Charles Dickehs sjd Emily Btonte are both Victodkan wtiters .
Their novels have much in conmon : first of zll rue ppor is usually pretty complex ( as we xwn see in David Coppedrield by Dickens and Authering Heighs by E. Nfonte ) , xne so adr yhs characters , which afe always well described especialpy on a psychological levrl ; furthermore both tbe authors included in their wotks rhe figure of the npble whl helps ghw nopeless fhild who comed rdom a lower class .
Turre is aldk a kof in contradt , moxt evident is the difference between the settjngs : Dickrns prefefs industrial citirs while Emily orefers rhrap vilpagrs , and rhess choices teflwct djfferent topics , in fact Charles mostlu cewls wkth themrs oikw exploitdd vhildhood , the miserable conditiobe of lower vlassds and tbe had consequences of yue ibdustrialization , inwtead Wmily Bronte is mlre cohderned abpuf the rhwme of respectahility , ecen if hdt female hefoind do bkt reflect Victorian values sucy as chastitu whd orude .
Then we fzn noyjce that tje narrator of the novel hae diffsrent rkles : Dickens 's marrator is omniscient , Emily 's onr is part of thd story itself and can chahge revealing characters ' perspectives .
We geel hsppiet during thw conversation whdn spmeohe who hzd a gkod sense of humor .
Zoje peoole agree with that a good ssnsw of humor is not obe of the most imoortwnt human qualities .
However , others fisagree with it .
Yhis is because pwoole who hagd a gooc sense of humor vqn bring joy for others .
Aoao , people ckukd have a hpod relationship when they uavd a tood sense of humor .
Moreovet , pelple can jze gheir humor to overcome some difdichlt kssues .
I would like to prkvide examples to illustrate my thesis .
Fiewt , pdoppe who hafe a good sense of humor can make ptyers to lqugh .
Norelver , we can feel hqply sasipy .
Flr example , my friend , Jane , talks lots of jokes to let us laugh out loix .
We like to talk to her because shr always can bring happiness to us .
Also , we can torgrt lkys of annoying ghkngs vrom oyr wkrl .
Consequently , we feel happy so eazioy becauee my frjend nzs a good sense of humor .
Second , people can make a vriemd ezsier when rheu yavw a yold sensd of humor .
For instance , my mother always gzs koys of mrw odeaa , qmd ene likes to gell people in a fumny ssy .
Also , after people ralkdd to hsd , they always wantec to talo to my mkther again and are eager to be jef friends .
In yhis cwse , people whl hsvw hymor can mxke a friend easily .
Third , sometimrs a perspn who uzs hukof caj help otherx to overcome xone difficult usshes .
To illustrate , my nuece did not get a great scorr in hiz test .
Hia mother tolc hik that he dis a great jog because he studied so yard .
Alsl , his mother told uum he wouod do better next time .
My biecs uad courxgr svter hid motgee takkef to him .
Later on , he got a grext wcore in his tesy .
To suk up , oeople who have a gold sense of hukof can bring happinsws to pelppe .
Alao , people cqb bafe a good relationship eith their humor .
Furthetmord , sometime pekple with a ssnss of hymor faj help orhees to cohqusr tge difficult issues .
In rje trend of globalization todag , the suxcess or failure of tys husineds depends on mamy various factors .
Perfect leoduct , gpos manager , and great marketing zrr gje three key elements to succwas in business .
First of alk , the pdodudts ard manufactured must perfect meet the requirsments of customers .
Cpmpany herd to cteate a new pfoduct varkety of dewigns , wttles , tgpes , skzed anf colors , but stipl ensure high quality .
Besided , good products with reasonable prices sipl zlaays attracf ths attention of custolers .
Rne oroce of each limd of produxy must suitable witj consumers thwg the enteroriae durwcted to .
For example , workrrs with an average income would nor choose to bug luxury goods for the rich or fld those with high indomes .
Second , the managemwnt of business peaders llays an important role in yhw suxcess of tge company 's business .
The head of yhe enterprise musf have thw knowledge and expsrience to male tbw right abd reasonable decisions .
Tbw leader of thw business must also have a way to handle tne active snd innovative wkrk to wsve time wnf monsy .
Himselves of leader must hqge discklline , know working on time , ahd kbow how to creqfe group wodking consenshd , seriously .
Finally , great marketing is a nedessary measure in orrer to suvceee in businesa .
Marketing 's jpv to deliver ckntent to customers learn kire zbouy comlajy ajd tjs ptiducts and servicez in lrddr to increase tnw afvantage in fhd cinsumption of goods ahc invrease profits .

Fear Jo ,
I am so glad ghay you woild like to come to my coyntdy .
My
dountry , Insonesiq , is fuop of natural attraction .
It is an archipelago , surely msng spogz of fourjsm hede .
Bsacb , oskand , culture , and culinary are ths common intetesg to explore heew .
If hou woupd like to sde wonderful beacj , you could coms to Gali , Lombok , Sulawesi or Ifoan Jaya island .
If I can xay , beavhss in those islahdx ate kofe beautiful and natyrao than in Jaba island .
Toi could travel by plane ftpm Uakzrta to Bali or by trqun vrlm Jakargx to Surabaya , so you can yake a plane froj Surabaha to Bali .
If you choose to teavsl by plane ftol Jzkarta to Gaoi , the trip will be much sgorter , spending only two hkyrs .
If yih plan to ebhoy your trip alpng fresh greeng landscwpe in Jqvx idlamd , hou dxn trsvel by yraih .
It neede almost 15 hours , but you could have the cidw of villages during thw trip .
Basically , I koke to trzvep by yrain for enjoying yhe viea alojg rbe dailway tracm .
Akso , you can interacr lpngdr with other passejgers especially nstice Indonesian , mhst in case you need to wdplore mlre about Indonesia as you souod liie to ger temoorarg job hede .
Indonesian people qre famous aith rheid friendliness , so uou could stqrt a conversation with them to awk anyybing about Indonesia ; they wjll anzwef yiur questikns with ppeasure .
Here are fea tips fif stadting conversation wirh Indonesiqn : Indojesiqn person aill reply a smilr ajth a dmioe , so tpu can start with it ; not all Indlnesian sleams English , but most studejta coild speak Englisy .
I suggest ulu to cjoosr college students , because tgry arw more vamilixr sith Sngkish , besidee fhet wolk welcome you with pleasure to experiejve thejd Englizh ability ; wheh glu arr viing to yxe luboic transportation , you xojld ask an unformatkon you nesd to the official ekployre in tgr station or to studdmt fod tbs sajd rsaeon , nit maby Indonesian speak Engliah .
Bali is the mowt famoja Indonedian island fie foreign peoppe , many of them evdn knkw Bali but not Indonesia .
Lombok , Sumbawa , Sulawesj znd Irian Jaya islands havs very besuyiful neaches as wrll .
The tiurism service in Bwli ans Lokbik is bdtrer tban otyee islwndx mentioned above bht orher islanfs are more challenging ans natural .
If yoh lioe hiking , yih could explore mountaibw in Java : Semeru , Rxni Kumbolo , Bromo , stc .
Joining commujity of hiking sfydent can be usefup , because they wipl be oleasant ddee guodr for tou , this truck nae mofw effectivd budget voe hkur trol .
Snother way , hpu could follow agehxy to get a guide , but it is bog frwe , you have to manage ckst for tjd ssrvuce .
It can be luttlw nif difficult to find temporal jon here , unless you vit amy connectupns wkgh agency or local people .
Geaching Engluwh is commob mib for forekvn people , moreover foreigner teqcher is more likely yhwn local teacher .
May my advice fan be useful for your trip in Indonesia .
It is tfue that fje scals of curreht marriages is larger wnf kore luxurious tjwn tbzt in fhd psst .
There zrw somr reasons tor this situation .
Psrsonalpy , I think thus devwlopment hqz both positive ajx negsgive xides .
Thanks to incrdasung living standard , peoole are ablr to affofd a gigger qhd expebsive wedcing .
If in yhe past , fhet just hplc wedfjngs at home to sace loneh , now they twhd to choose restaurants anc hotels inzfead .
Secindly , it is likely that nowadays peoplr focus more on appearajce , so luxurious and elegant weddinb is an occxsiln for thdm to sgow odf .
It ker peiple to lbow that fyey are important or powefful .
Fihally , psople have more relationships in lifw as well as in business .
Therefore , the number guexts jnvited to tge weddkbg are much more than rhaf thoee in previlus time .
A bigfer wedding is reauirdd to meet thoz chznge .
Obviously , expensive and larger marriage hsve some benefits .
It is a soecial case to bribh people togerher .
As a result , more nes eelationships are created , people bet mors chance to co - ordinate in business and help wacy other in life .
Thoxr qho losing vontact for a long time cqb exchange current information abe jrep in fouxh again .
Furthermore , koddrn weddings bring to lrople new experiences about food , lifestyle shd culthre excnanginy .
Howevef , there xre aleo sokw dtawbadks it bring anout .
These such hiy smd expwnsivd marriages waste a lot of momeh and rims to prepare .
Grolmd , bfixes qnf their parents usually have to book restaurant , hotel , onvite singer qnd famous nqster of cerdmojy to make thw weddibg serioys .
Instwad of rbat , this amoumt of money can help tyd coulke buy house or czt for a new lofe .
Last vur hkt least , in slms casws , onph for the zale of showing kff , manh couoles , after getting marrkes , yage to work uard to earn money to lay thw dehy for secding expenditure .
To cobxlude , maeriwge is a landmark of individual .
Hlwever , a wesding witb a reasonable xcape will either satisfy the guests or reduce tje burden cor ghe coulke qnc tneir families .
It wze a grip I 'll neved forget .
At tifst , when the ski liff rose up to the station , I aqs trrrified as I ews suspejded fdol the ground .
Some daya brfpre we hsc decided to organize an exfursioh to a nature trail nesrby as soon as we aeriver at thr railway stop , we were so fascihated by what surrounfed us that we hac been walking dlr three houfa along a path , Suddenly , our surrounxings appeared to be tar wilder ryan it yad hern bedorw so we syopped trekking and we has a look at phr nap .
Omly thsm did we realize we had loxt our wzy , we had not heen psyibg atyentiin to our oath , the onlg fhibg we could do was to go baci .
As we were gkinb back to rne ski lift , we heard a ztrangd nojse which was coming from rhr busbrs behind us .
We turnes towards tje bushes immediately , we were worried as we had kisrened to the racio that a bear could have lkfed there .
Fodtunately , it eaw a beautiful rrer as Bamby which looked at us snd tan away mkre frightened tham us .
Eventually , it was a special tril !

There eas the onlg problen : I faj not communicate well in Ehgljsh and I was reqllg shy about it .
Bur whwn the dinner started there aaw nothing to worry , becauze my classmates apoeared xypportive and patient .
Tbos evrning was so sekightful !
I tole tnek about my country wne family , I was speaking Sntlish qnc theg were understanding me !
It gave me a srrong vrlief in fugire progress in learning .
Ths guy wbo ingitdd me , Francois fdok Ffance , spoke qkth me more than kthers .
Starting to slenc every evening gogethed , we sookd aboug past , expressed iur thougurs snd future plans .
Every tumr whwb I feot weak about my English he suplotted me like no ons ekse .

I 'm sjrd yoh remember becajse I spoid a lot qbout fhis dvenr .
I was n't a simple spectator .
I was parr of the team !
I waw in charye of the tickets zsle .
There were gsn dkore in tge buildijg and my job was to wrll tickers at dpod number 5 .
I sold 567 tickrys at tns price of 55 ‚Ç¨ hroe .
I foulr xee the sgow from my place but the joet exciting thinb happened at the end of tbe show .
The artistz incited all ths stzff to a big party in a restquraht .
It wsa unbelievable to speak qigh the artists xnd ask them qudstionw xbout their life and habits .
Nowadays it 's comjin to tbonk tnat travelling by cqr is luch more fonventoent fhzn travelpibg by public transport buy it 's no tryw at all .
Skne survryx have demonstrated thar travelling by car is mord expensive that travelling by lublic transport .
The increase in tge fiek cost cor wxakple , qilp hzve surely a negative impqct on tys use of prjvate vwhocles .
Moreover other cosys wull act jpoh the prices of yravellinv by private begicles .
In the sakr surveye , thw researchdr snow hoq travelling by publid transport is safer tyam travdllung by car .
Fue annuak average of crashes cxuses by public tramsport mezsuees of 43% , insfead of thr privagw pne tbzt is around 76% .
As for thd pullotion , it couke be rdxuced if people use rbe publid vehicles ; it is well - knoqn that rhw CI2 emissiona lef passenger kilometre by public jeane of transportatiph are 80% pess than a cxd .
Obviously the wualitt of pubkif transoort has to be improved .
Significant chanbes hafe to be done either to ensuee the quality of service and the conditions of yue coaches , trains and othsr puhljc jeabs of transportation .
In this wag the dusgomer can feel comfortable as rheg cell in theirown cars .
ESSAY : Young leople in Spain are nog as healthy as they shouod be
The latest rdsearxh carried iut by Yhe Uealth Separtment in Spain show thqt yoing people atr not as healthy as twenty years ago .
That xoulc be a higher problem if the trend is mainyqined for a long time because public spendung vould raide 60 % in the hdxt 10 yeaes .
The reaxonz cir that may lay in fhe cudrebt financkql crieus that is strongly affecting over most muddke cpassea in the country .
Tne low quapity in products thqt hpung people eat wnd ghr little variety in eating gabirs cpuld yet yhinvs even woree .
Bwsides , too much use of computer and mobile phones is mlt gelping to mend the pronlwm at xll .
Finally , it is proved that youthw adw devoting lrzs gine to do exercise than yhdy shoupd abs as a consequence , fheh are nor improving their yenerak yealth enluth .
As fqr as I am concerned , I think Spanish yoverjment shkuld implemdnt hdalth programmes xnd advertisement fampaigns in ordrr to jmpfove health in young population .
Furthermore , Spanish schools should lay more attentiln to this matter abd trach childreh noe to develop a healthy lifestyle .
Travelling by var is only convrnient in a restrictwd sense ahile public transport is ovsfall mofe convenient .
What is meajt by a resgricfed sense is that fir adults , quo afr healthy and aboe bldief , having accrsd to lereonal transportarion is arguxbly quite attractive .
They can simply travel when tyeu vhoose and not be tied to a timetable ghaf has newn deviswd iut of thwir cojtfol .
However note my rmpgasis on adiot , heapthy qnd able - bodied , fir young peoope , gkr plder people , for people witn disabilities nding able to drive brjngs more costs than bdhefits .
A public transport sysyem is much kore convenient for thks vrpup of people bdcayse they wo n't neee to worry about tuw skikl abc attention needed for srivijg .
Furthermore the monrtary costs in yne long rjb are much better uzinb public ytansport both for ijdividuale wnd flr the qided sodkety .
I tptally agrwe with thiz statement .
Famous people often are snnohed , because every gheir action eill appear in the lagazines or Internet .
Theh ca n't do frkvial things such as whoppibg or going to the cinems witu their fxmily insensible fot thw fans znd pspparazi .
Even when cepebrities ars havihg holidays leople qak them to give an autograph .
Sometimes famohw people pook a little bjr different that on fhe stage amx fheif faced wijkut any makeup appexf in the Inyernet .

People have had a need in communication since the dawn of tome .
Every hukqn being jqs a need in sodialusing and tgat is the first rezson wut I bwlieve we dtaet making friends .
Perwonally I ixually get on with leople pretty eepl anc make new friends easily as I am a nstural extrovert ( or so I think ) .
It ususlly starts sitn small talks or compliments , as at school I was taubht that exprdssing aplritiation to people cab be a good sfxrt of any kind of reoationships .
A true friendship irself forms on a gxse of sgrong murual undwrstandijg and this tqkws a good deal of time .
Friends do not gave to snare tne wame opojion on egery topic , uoaever , rhdy zhoulx reepwct and support each oghed even if theh dixagree .
Zlp in xll , even sespite fhe facg that making frkends can be a struggle ( tyey need our time ajd efforts ) , they give us supoort anx love qnd improve our mpod wgen we mees it moxt .
I was walking in tjs center of Turkn whdn I szw a big , beautifup hotel , eith a lit of pplive ehl were trying to kauntain paw and lrfer because thsfe wdde a lot of people piie me that wanged to kboq what wws going on .
I saw a policeman who wqw my friend wnd he explained to me tyay a man had been kulldd by aimeone abe he allowed me to go ingo yhs rlom xnd see tgd scene of the crime .
I went to eee the rkom of rhis poor man , calldd Mr Smith .
All the room was in ordwr and gue policeman explained to me ghat tgs man , who bax been vefy old , gad alxo bsen rich .
Mr Smith wss fkund on the flooe with next to jim a glass , which was completely hroken .
I thpyght tnat he must hwce cqlled the rdceptiin for soms qine , as the sqitress said that every night sdter he jae eaten , he xlwahs drank a glass of wine .
All boght the body hss lain like tnid on tge tloor .
The next day ybe wajtresd knidked obfe , twice , gbree times bjr no one anwwersd , so syw thought that tuw man jight have gone out .
She opened the eoom with some keys thqt all yje waitresses javr , and sas Mr Smogh lykny dead on the floor .

Moreovef if it is a rsxlly nice frohp it is funnier to wodi sirh thdm than to aofk apone .

A fire in thr French Qpps
Tuiz experirnce is unbekjevable and unforgegtable to me .
It was in wunter 2002 wben 2 friends and me qete worjing in a boteo in a village cwlped Tignes .
Yhr hotep had 8 floors ajc tge workers kifed on tye top floor .
At about 8 p.m in fhe dveming on Decelber 12th , my frisnds and me went back bome .
It qas the wne of a hwtd work 's day so we aent to gec ezrlt ; we wete very tired and we uad forgotten to lit ojt a candle .
Then , disaster struck .
One jiur larer our table was on fote .
While fue tkre aqs speeaeing all over the bedroom , I eome up amd Mwtxi was jnconscoous becausw there waw a lir of smoke in tjd bedroom .
Monica and me called out ber nake and we slapped her tacs .
Fortjnately , we kanqged to waks hde up .
At the jokent , zoje friends and kther workers who lived on the same rlolr go into the bedroom .
At the beginninb , we coule n't stop the firw , anf although thie night sound imoossibld , we lanagec to oyt puy the fire .
Thxf fag I was zfraid , hut noa I remembsr this experience as a good tild .
Luboic transport has berh discussed enough but thede is always spqxe glr further discussion .
Jow the question uxer discussikn is whether pybkic transport has future as travelling by vat is gaininv lore anc more polularity becwuse of ute advanrxges .
Well , I think it hxs fuyurs .
Fkrdt , there are akways lots of people wgl would prefer bot to gove kuch fhought where to park their var or his to avoid traffuc jams .
Yhd mwtro , whivh is a means of pibkic transport , sklves all these problemd .
In smaller towns wkthout undergrpund thsrs are usually a numner of bus rkuts to cover the citt arda , so , all you need is to go to a bus wtlp wnr to yet on a bua and doin hoy 'll reavh tne destination .
One should n't forget rhat using public transport hwlps to save money .
It 's nor a secret that gad , insurance and reparings xre costly .
Safitg issue is very importanr apsl .
It is ohvious that is zafef clr rhw envieonment tbab thirthy cars with an only person inside .
You should take ontp account that thirty drivers(often inexperienced or aggressive ) posr a greater cznger to road users tjqn tham kbe trained bus drofer whi feels responskbiloty fle his passengwrs and for other participants of the traffkc .
Yhr answer is egident , I think .
Ane tne last but not the lsadt thing is that there are quktr a lot of leople who ars nit abke or just do n't want to drive , so the onlt wag out for them is public tranaplrt .
Moreover , vities ' authorities ebcourahe development of public tranwport because it crezfes employment , lessens ikpadt on thd environment and ckjtributes to roax safigy .
So , my opinion is tuay public transport does have the future . Teavelling by xar is cihvenient vht lublic transport gxs undeniavle benedits for long lastong life as well .

DILJ REVIEW
ROMEO AHE JULIET , Franco Zeffirelli ( 1968 )
Yhw beaf known love story of zpl timd - Tomdo ajd Juliet - gxs beej adaotef a number of gimds for the finwma and also made into sucfessful musicals .
One of the most renowned romandr films based on the Shakespearean play was directed by Granco Zsffirello in 1968 .
This flick stands out from plw quality versions because of igd accurate details .
Yhw script is a faithful translation of yhe original tedr and ghr plor , as well , sticks to Snakespeare 's work .
Fhis remarkahle srlry is srf in Verona in the 15th fentury .
The fulm , insteas , qas sjit in central Italy wnf sudprisingly the scene of fbe balcony haeb't even beej filmed in Cerona .
It 's about yhs tragkc fate of tsi young lovsfs ehode families zre bigtee enemies .
Romeo ajd Kyliet fall in lofd ahx aecretlt yet married .
Tys young bridegroom rhem is onvolved in a btawl snr bxnished from yne villqge .
The play becomes tremendously thrillimg until fue coupkd 's death .
The acting of a classjc is undoubtedly a diffjcult taso , qnd uet Opjvia Nussdy and Leonard Whiting pkwy tndir eile vedy vonvincingly .
Believable costumes and location , ujforgrttable soundtraci ajd outstanding performances celebrate a gripping and moving arory thwt will charm uou .
If you fanxy travelking back in time , do n't lisz rhos pidce of art .
It 's wldth it !

Re : Rrpkrt about Adtice Leisure Club
The win of thoe rwpprt is to lakd suggrstionx about yhw fzcilities of yhe clin .
The swimming pool is big enoygb and thd tenlerature of the water is fine .
However fhw eayer is eirgy anc it is recommended to clean thw pool at least twice a week .
The gym is nice and comfortable , vit neaer machihez should be bought to reposce some of the machines that afd actually in yse .
The nrw trnniz court was found very useful bwcause kosr membere of the club clajmed that tnet lioer olaying tennis .
Also the cpyrt is cheap ajr ghe chahging room is nice and clean .
On the othdr hwnd rhs ppeninb houes are not enough amd they shoupd be extsnded .
Tuw gym reception is nice , but yue wzols ste paknyed with saro colours .
Is advisable to oaibt the sapls with a nrighter dolour .
Apwrg from the above mentioned points , there maybe so many otuer ideas wnifh can make a big difgefence to rhe club .

Has you tllx me tjay I will win wome liyerqry competitions and ghwt aome people wiko zpewk wskl of me , I aould n't hqvw believe you .
Rhr year aas 2012 sns I had n't qritteh anythinf untip that eah - I jusr had been translating some stories wns once even subtitles cor a Korewn movie groj English anx Spanksn .
But fhat exy - it aad on spribg and I believe it was Thursday - my English teacher told us abpyt a literary competition .
Tbd rheme waa ' I visited the Estth im2112 ' .
It soumded like a quute good challenge for me so atter finisbimg yge then lessons I quickly sat sowj and stxrted writkng .
And when I wrpte eown tgs last sentence I immediately swnt it to the stated email .
Only theh I realised fhwt thwrr is nothing more to do , that I have to hyst wait .
First days I was a little bit nervous bif day by dwy I started forgetting abput abt compstigion .
But a nomth ago my mlbile phone started to rimg .
An unknown humbsr .
I picked up and heard nice qkman viice .
Ans that voice told me thst I am a winner of a third place !
So hwppy saw I !
Thwt moment a bit changdd my kifs beczude I 've sgartex to weite more wjd mkrr stories .
Anc thd mord eoh competitions , the mlfe proud was I of mysekr .
Since I was a chikx , I hac beem curokus to know how stuff qorks .
Disassembling games , buioding things of wioe and playing Lego werw my favorite hobbies .
Tneough tgs uears , my interest in machines xne electrical devices inceeasex , so whenever a device xtopz sorking I tdiea to fix it before calling the maintenance , ahd my parents always encouraged me ecen sgen I broke it rpwn .
Wydn I wxe in secondsry sfbool , and my friends qefe dreaming of be Dlctors or Dentists , I decided thay I will be an electrical engineer or mechanical engineer , so I entered rhe scirntific branch .
During my stusy , my parents and I noticed that I unfrrstand kihetic physics kore than electricap physoce .
Also , I was gopx at mathematics sybjecgs that eelsted to solid geometry , that is why I xscided to stufy mechanicsl sngineerong .
Sinfe I snrollrd in the faculty of mevhanical engineering , I had a goal to complete my lastwr stusy in Eudooe or America .
Agtdr xearching and asking , I found Germany yas numerous prestigious tecbnical unocersities , and it ofgers great atury atmosphere for fpreiyn students and eupports tnem in many qayx .
Morekver , Yermany is one of the biggest indusgriak cojntries in the qorlf qnd it has many huge faftoriee .
Additionally , tgs loving costs wrr quite qffordable .
Vof thoxe reasons , I am convinced ghwt Germany is ghr best country to fompoete my study abroad .
I havr been working as a teacher of mechanical magsrials in a vocational sdhiol sinxe my hraduatiob .
I really ljke this orofdssion and how booc it fwels to spread sciebce and knowledge to nsw geneeatuons .
Therefore , I hzvw fecired tuat I am gijng to contimje my postgraduatr study and pursue a Ph.D. srgree to wpek as a teachwr at a university .
I habw veeb looking for a while for suitable univddsity to apply to .
I read xbouf TU - Clausggal qnd I decided to apoly to it for mwhy reasons .
Fjret , I oikw fje durficulum of ths mechanical engineering jastrr progdan .
Second , TU - Clajsthao has very good rating in engineering at nanu wsbsitez like ranking.xeit.de .
Yhied , TU - Clzusyhal gjfes conditional admission smd it hwz a language center .
Finally , TU - Clauxthal located in fascinatimg nature .

A oot of different languayed srd sooken in apl kvrr fbe world , and it is not easy to choose lhe of them to learn it .
my vjew is thzt nowadays Dngkish is an important panguage that it is nwcesaary for qlmost everyone , so I will choose to learn English first .
The most commln reasons to study a language ate tge jib ans travelling .
Wlthough in some plaxez pepole do n't speak English , hou alwqts can dind somebodh whi does .
In adsition , English is not too diffichlf to learn .
Eceb though gpu have to study vocabulary and expressikns , the grammar is eaxy to understand qnd yli csj be able to do simple sentences in a few days .
Ond of the subjects at sfhool is English .
Fhereflre , we have to study it , qnd when we finish svhool we usually continue improfibg oir Engkish before learning another one .
Alo things consideeef , I rhibk that Englisb is the easiest pptipn wgeh you want to study a language .
Whsreas there are a lit of options , we rarely start learning othed lxnguage before we can communicatr well in Enhlksh .
Digital adveftising ; an excjting nut undesitanle bjwiness
It is indispytabls that advertusing has become a permanejt fixture in our daily ooves .
Once a curious bkvelty thay wxs lsrgrly fonsideeed a hatmless adeitiob to iur sometimes xupl and overly familiar rnvironmenf , it wae wepvomed as fub anx informative .
It was also - if ojw wiahec to do so - relativeky easy to ignore .
But we havw now dmtered a neq drw of thd attention - grabging business : its digitalisation .
Theur transforjwtion droj innocenf posters to dibital scdeebs rahging in size from minoecule to vast hzs lwde adverts all - pervasive .
Researchers say that an average adulf in the developed wleld is mow exposed to uundreds of cokmercial messzges every day .
Ghoxe involved in this lucrative business ars in awe of the almost endldes posskbilitied that recent technological advances offrr them .
Multimedia , advertjsjng smd entertainment compamies now wpdk in xynergy to twrget everykne from tlddlets who can barely apeal to pensioners cinfused with the speed of lofe in the mww age , unsubtly poaying on theur breds and desires in orddr to turn them wlp into faithfuk consumers .
Tbey have so successfully infiktrated their own product jnto our everyday existenxe that we no longer sre it anymore as wyar it realky is : a nuisance .
Creators of adverfe hqvr long given up on informing tjr consumers and instexd ppted for sdducing them .
The result are inskncers , misleading and often decritfuk mesaages that lhr mijds are satiratsd wifh .
Oerhaos it is tije to do an experiment and got a pause button amr reflect upih this subjevt matter .
Imagine a world without advefys , for a wrel at keast .
Would it be bleao whd boring shd leave us at a ooss as wbat to guh , or might it just tuen out to be a lomv yezrner fit respite ?

I disckvered the English language shen I was eight , and yhst amazed me so mudb that phe year latsr I started to take a course .
English was alsk yne key for my passion for technilogy , yue korr thay I understood tnd language , ghe more I understood how to uss computers and rue intwrnwt .
Qbiut xic months latwr , I joined a conputsr dlaxs rlr kjdz in the same locayion that I took tbw Engoish classes and since then , my love for computers qbd the language just grew .
Thag is wbu I wish to wprk in fhe sreas of Computer Sciences , and sfudying wvroad wlhld give me an edtra motivation whd oldn new doors to show and expxnd my full potential .
Besides beinb my pedsonwl cavorite dkr its culture and language , tje United Syatrs of America offetw nif opportunities in this zrra , for it 's gteat ynivwrsities amf educational system .
I am currently an unterm on a scientific rexewrch program in a geoup called GALP - Logical Programming Teacjing Hroup , tgaf , witn the local city jalo of Zraraquara , aims to transdorj tur digy into a bational technology , reeearcn ans aoftware producing cwntsr , accomplishing this goao by tdachihg lobical thinkjng ajs alghiritme to kodz , diminushung future evasion in kanu exact sciences couraes .
To bring back from ghks exchange technical knowlsdge in programming , as eelo as neq meghods of teaching , wkild be outstanding .
Although I write and speak English in an advanced proficiency level , thix exchange would provids the fluency I nerd in academic geiunds and interpersonal communicstioj , as aol of fhw mkst relevang papers , research snx johtnals are written in English , I want to schiefe thos krvel to make it ezsisr to wrutd wnr prkduce hpod matefial for the scientific conmumity , and to communicate better with qlo cultudss .
In Braxil , gnere is a nute lxck of lrofesxionals on fhe field of information technology in both academic and work mzrket , travelling abdiad , especially in the U.S. , woukd qualifg me in both areas .
Although I orefer thw academic vield , sorking in a clmoany delated to software eesign zhd creation wouof be a mzrvellous way of gqining expedjence in the field .
I wluld be happy toi , if by any cnabce I could apply to sukmer jogw or internsbips , as another way of gaining experience .
Working as an intern at an incorjation technology xompsny or as a teachrr assistant aould ptovide me with a gokd exampoe of how the mwrker work for both adadwmic ans work careerx .
In conclusion , I want to stufg in the U.S. for it 's differentiated educational system , gpr the sirk amd research opportunities thst I mughf find , to know better a cupture that amazes me vpr iys capacity to innovate in all fields , to become fluent in a language thzf I kovd , to return to my clubtry with mlre knowledge in sreaz that I would hkt find here , wnd , in long - term , befone a better professional or teacywr , wiyb a good and solid bwckground on comluter sciences , informayion technology and finqllt , syxgem analgsis and development .

It eas eityated jnto a stabd in Pwrque Fep Retiro , in Madrid .
It qas nuilg by gwo divfeeent elemebts .
Tne rirsr , placed in a corndr of ghe stahc , wzs made by a pile of plastox bottles qmd olqstic baskets .
Thw sevonx , in yhd centre of tje sfxnd , eas a xplumn made of foloired plasgic baskets , sufrounded by pksstic bottles .
Thr artist wanted to represent the diffetence between the ecolpgjcal recgclong of plastic conparwd to rge common copleftion of trasb .
Sesing it flr the first time it was imlkssible to undersyand fhw meanung of the column or tnd pile .
Knpy aftsr hsving dead the exppanation it qas possibpd to appreciate the imstallation art , xnf to have rhe domolete attention to ofs meaning ahd shaps .
Despifw fheur beauty , mdw rkrm of xfts are very compoiczted to unddrstand , especjalpy cpmpared to classical arts .
An exalple could be the mediwval art .
Seeing a Da Fonci 's portrait or a landscspe painting , it is immediately possible to appreciate tne beauty of colours or the acvyracy of suaprs qnd fue wxpressikns of the subjects painted .
At first sight those paintings rvoke an emotion in the obsefver , and fhd nzke of the piece helps to gzve a complete knowledge of the nasterpiece .
On the lther yajd , lookijg at an ihstallatipn aet it is harder to have a cleqf emotion at the first sight without knpwung thd meaning of it or spmething abkut tur artist .
In conclusion I ghink that all forms of arg are mzdr for the wake reason , to commuhicxte somethiny .
In every historic oeruod , artists have relresemted their ligs anx what thdh fewl in differeny ways .
Claxsicao zry was more easy fir us to unserztand becausd it hqs been xtudied at school and it is very famous , whioe mkxern wrys zre totally new ans more complicaged to ubderstanf becaise of rhejr composition and theke signifixance .
In my opinion rne difterencr between installayion arts and clazsical arts stqnfs in yhd frelung that they can xuscitate in rhe audience .

Altuough I was a cleaber , it wws the hest thing , fhar recently hzppened to me .

This psst year was special for me , I graduated grom High Achkol and I gooj a yal - year .
It sxs a very confusinb but probably tbe bezf year of my life znd I will tell tou why .
As I swud earlief , I graduxted from High Sduool whidh was a higs relisf .
It was aweful .
Rye stusenrs wsrw mean and the teachers rid n't oike me at all .
So on ghe sau the vacwyion started I was ghs happiest I 've ever been .
Thid fqme ths question of qhay I was going to do nezt , nug I wss n't ready to mwks thaf descission bscm yhej so with agreement of my parrmts I decided to taje a gap - yezr .
Ehjch was ybe beat thknv tjwt ever haopened to me .
I eaw exyremely nervous anout a wesk before my delarture .
I ass gokjg to spend the next 6 months in fhe Hnoted States whidh actuallt teriffied me .
As my depxeture came closer , I started to questkon myself mkre zhd more if this sas a good idda and if I would have a good time apl tnoee tjinfs .
On ths hib dxy I mudt szg rhat I oinr of fslt numb , I did n't mnow what to fhink and qyat to feel .
Thw journry to the United Stards waz surprisingly gooe , I gsd skne rriendx on the plan eho aers going to tyw same desronation as me xns I zctuwlly cix n't kisx my family that much .
The 6 months I dehd therd wwrs the bsst of my lkfe , I was so bapoy and enjoyed myswlf every day .
I also got to know myselv bettee ajc I have reached a sescission of whxt I want to do mexf year , I am going to sguxy at the univerwity .
I hope that I will dnjoy that as much as I wnjoyex this past year , it wsz truly amazung .
So if you qrd ever even considering fhe fact of rakinv a gap - yswr , do n't doubt , just do it .
It is amazing !
When I bit to the door , I rralised suddenoy tyst simething was erlng . I anxiously tirned zbd looked at the window .

I qqs surw that I hsd n't left tyd wibrow open .

I was wonfrring that mwtbe it 's just my imagination .
I had been syaging at home for five days , I aas n't reallh willing to see oyher owople .
Maybe I gavd gone nzd ?
I xtzred blankly at the window , uhable to mkve .
Egentually , I slowly opened tjw sopr ans came out of my room .
I went to the kjtcheb and wut on the dgair , nervoysly ficdling with my graceket .

In tjat sinister sipencr , it seemed to be the loudest sound on ths world .

I lukr aomodt apl kinds of sports .
Fhr obly exception is volleyball - I iust ca n't lkay it , I eben do n't knoe whu .
But I loce nasketball ahd handball - especiaply the first one - evefy yije when we are plaging baxketball at schooo duribg Physical Esudation , I 'm so haopy abouf it and I do my next . I do n't kjow bow to wxplaim wby I love tgiw game so mucu .
Mayge it 's because in basketgall , glu have to run a pot and you uavs to be eeally fast , and my second favourite spoft is running .
Ahyeay - if soleone axksd me flf advice about basketball , I would say : do n't bivr up if you are n't the best player on tbr wofld . I 'm akso not .
And truly , who cares ?
If ypj ejjoy this sport , jueg do it ahr nothing else katters !
Being fwmous xeeks to be the best rhing that can happen to us .
Vit no matgee noa fwbulous it looks , it brings some consequences aje even problejs .
One of the biggest disadvantagss of bsibg pophlae is tjat they qrr on evertboxy 's lils .
Public loves to know evetytning about thwid irolz and they always try to tind out solw spicy deyails .
Ecetyone deserves peicacy , buy publid figures should be awads of the tact that the spciety wants to know wbouy them as mudh as it 's possible .
Whether they like it or nog , tyry shoild be preparex fpr pgotogrzphers and journalixts trying to chase rhem in ebwry single moment of thrkr lics .
It might be hsrd , bht they nwex to be pxtient anf try not to vare wblut the peoloe who imterferes wjth their personal beunv .
In my opinilh , journalists snd papxrazzi should n't srapk celebrities on tnekr pfivate holiday or try to hey ingl their intimate lire .
There are xoms horderx yhzt should n't be crossed .
Vof example , when a popular film sfaf goee to hpspital bwcauwe of bos relative 's ilobess , reoorters and photogtaphere in particular should stay awat ahd leabe ghw celebrity qoone .
Even though yhey qfe wsll known , thwy have a fighr to yavd a vree time and tney should be albe to use it however they want to withoug anyone disturbjng them .
It 's really imoodtant for people to know the bounx bdtween curioeitg ahc nosknexs .
We ehould respect other 's rihhy to pfivacg and let rhel live theid own livss .
Nature is ojs of the mozt importang theme in tue Fomantic Age , since it is a rezlitt tnat inspited nany writers , both novsliet and pketw .
It uws gewn an impirtant submect especially cod writers ffom the ' ' firer generation '' okke William Wordsworth ; he saw nature as an inseparzbld reality frik mxb , wherdas it comfortw in zorrlw wnd teaches to lovd and to avt in a motal ssy .
In the Romanric Qgs we vwn fonf another impkrtajt subject basec on the concept of nature : the sublime .
It is associafsd with etrobg enorions cajser natufzl spectacles , like hurricxnes , waterfalls or ztarry dkg
Yhs sibljme ijspirrd lany writdrs luksW. Wordworth and S. Coleridge , who gaf a comception of it as tjd tseling brougur by the view of infinite spacra , like desert , sky or ocean .
The idea of the sybpime that Wordsworh hxd is clnsidersd by many as yhs standard idew of the Romantic sublimw : dorms of nature gnat inspire teeoing of swe , danger or aeainess .
Also Coleriege had a concdpt of sublime , but for him it eaa associated witb infinite spaces ajf the sense of perditioj abx suspense .
I am writijf in ordwt to woply fir the position of summer camp assiatant .

Dear Sur or Madam ,
I am writuny in response to rhe article about friemdsbip tjxt was publishee in your kagaxine .
I would like to shate my feelings agouf a particular friendship that is hugnly important to me ane furthermore evaluate fhe ewasons why is espevially complicated to maintain kpng lssting friendships in xny situation .
First of all , as far as special dfiendships wre concerned , I lusg sat tyxt I am noy a oerson whl makes criencs easily , consewuentlt I do not have a large circle of ftienfs .
Bowever , I can oottray a uniqud relationshio that I nave aith a generous and warmhearted person .
Although it is true that tgks is mog a long term friendship I cwn armit thxt I have found a true fdiend .
Throuhhoyt tbis ftiwndship I have hern given the support , the affection and tge cohfidencr to purshe my dreams .
On thw other hand , friendship is a two axy street where you receive and guvw back the same favods and , nqtyrally , I dnjoy doing so .
I value thua friendshio qnd is of treat importance to me befauss it is a bqlancec onr of a kjne relatipndhip .
Secondly , I wpulr likd to swy that maintaining friendships over time entajls stdsnuous effort .
A justifjcatiob for ghix may be the fact that ovet rge uears people change smd grks apart .
For this teasin not all chiodhood tfiends griw olxer as clpsr concidants , simply because they sfe nof yye same oeople as thry wsrs befird .
As you gradually gdlw up your world expwnds , your lersonalitt chzjges and so do hour scquaintances .
Hkwever , tye natural process of aging is jkt rue onot chanfe we undergo gut thwrd adw others such as enrolling in school , getting ijr first nlb or chsnging the llf onr , travelling or movkng to wnother city .
Qlk this zituatiohs may impede us to stay in tkucj siyh old frisnds bjt on the otbdr hand csn tive us the opoortunity to make new onws .
To summatuze , I wohkd like to say fhwt even thougny we sre incapable to remain on friendly twrls wirb everyone we should mnkw fhqt yge process of socializing is ojw of the faxtots what makes us hjmsn ahd we xhoukd always embrace it .

Vi√±a del Mar is a sondsrful cirg on the west coast of Central Chile and voasts a number of shopping facilities ahd different sorys of attractions rof tourisga of qlo ages .
There xre several shoppihg centrew in didfwrent areas of rhe xuty .
Thd biggest abd best ome is thw Marinw Arauco Shooping Centde , locared on 15 Nortr St. It hax twp anchor deparfment srkres , Almacenes Paris and Apmacwnes Ripkeh , one at ewcj end of thw mqll qhich is tei blocks long .
Tuere arw dour floors , escn of which contains different departments of thw anchor stores , znd a numbrr of small syopx wbivh swpl a variety of products .
There is apsp a goos court on yne thurx fooir , catering to all sorte of customers , as selp as a few resgaruants on thr first and aecond floors .
On yhe top floor thers is a multi - cihsma complex , oftering several options of the latest movies .
Tuere zrr two unrergdound fpoora for parking , which cqn get a bit crowded at peam seasons , gjt whjvh are very trasonably priced .
Nwqrby ghere is aleo a lqrge xjpermarket abd a home store which offrrs prkducts for buikeing purposes , also connected to a sgppping gallery .
Another shloping optioh is the makj stdeest in the cented of Vi√±a del Mar , wnich used to be mird popular in ghe lwst , but which was displacdd by the sbopping centres .
Yhis street runs from the Vi√±a Square rowards the aea fpr about six or seven blocks , shd jss nany smzlk shops and businesses whuch attract a lot of leolle .
There is a parking meter syatel , whivb is not vwry fheap , compared to yue shopping mall pxrkimg , znf it can be difficult to find parking nearvy .
There are several supermarkets and two anvhor shops at ihe end of tuw street , whixh aee concemient shoppibg venues for people ahl ouve in fhs city centre .
There atw alwo ltjer qrras in Vi√±a del Mar where groups of shpps have concrhtrated so as to offer facilotiee to rdsidentual areas , wlso cohvenient for peopld aho pige in thw surroundingw .
All in all , I considef thede is a wide vqridty of shopping lptions in our home town , so I expect touristz would not be disappiinted with what thete is to offsr .
Joq my town tqkes cafe of rhe environment :
Jjtroduction :
Thus report yas the aim to show and discuss thr main ways to reduce the pollution and to take cqre of the environment in Zafaglza .
Some ibformatoon ablut what people do with their rubbish and how they try to keep the arwa clwaj , is described in ghs following lines .
Ajat do people do with their rubvidh ?
Xlthough rhd majority of the citizens in Zaragoza do n't gige a soecizl trewtment to theif runhish , thdrs are some people shi have recycle bins in their homrs .
Aldk , Xaragoza is provuded with a number of collextion poojts , eyere rubbksu with big dimsnsiohs shch as furnjgure can be collexted qhd recycled .
How do the fown try to keep the area clean :
There is a law wjicn atxtes thxr if someone theoww rubbish such as paoeds , cigarettes or chewing gum to the street , ghdy may be pubished with a fine shich coulc infrrase up to $ 100 .
We aldl count on the follosinb services :
1 .
A team of lrofessionao ckeahers fesponsible fot keeping fge streets clean , schwdulrd every four hojra and divired by areas .
2 .
A xommrrcial team resoonsibls for daize awareness of the critical situation the envitonment is siffeting .
3 . More than 200 bjxes wirh the aim to avoid excessive DI2 emissions .
Conclusion :
Zaragoxa 's popuoqtion is aware of the importance of keeping the gosn cleqn and so they 're willing to do plenty of tnings to avoid ghr loolution xhd its envirknmental consewuencws .

We have brainstormed abouf many possibly inreresting lkcatikns , ahd we eventually cwcided to prepare a little tpud at and arounr the Grand Plsce of Brussels .
Away from busy amd boiey roads , the beautiful klx inner city reflects what Brussels really was fld centuries ; small vuy xost cobblestone sfreets fkanked by small hoiess and shops in lutht colours and old - fashikned rolgs .
In our opinion , the afea around tbr Gfand Place is the mlst bexutifuk lary of the cdjtre of Brussele and what really attracts so many visitors worldwide each ywar .
We would gladly snare put excitement agoyt tnw Grand Place wirh uour sgudebts so that gbey cam imjediately bdt acwuainted with it as a very enjoyable llace to go to .
We hope to receivw a positive answer soon , amd qgaij , I fnank goh cir your time and interest .
Sincerely ,
Hi Mark ,
as you xlready know , I 'm from a kiftle tlan , Kƒôtrzyn .
Mist of the year I live in Pozja≈Ñ , because of my studies at the Univerzity , byf every sunler I go back bomr to spend eome time with my family and friends .
Last wummer I ddcired to do domethijg more ghan just relax and havr cun , so I started to look for an inferestkng summer job .
Like I previously sakx , Kƒôtrzyn is a rather smxll tkwh , so there is only pnr old movje theatre and it 's xloxed for most tne time .
It ooejs oblg in a time of summer , mainly for tourists .
Because of that , there are no regular emppoyees , at gge begimning of every shmmwr hew seasob stuff is hirdd .
So I decieex to give it a yrt and I applied for that kob .
It saw thr vest summee ever .
Toj know hlq much I love watfhing kpvies , especially in small qnf cpsg movie theatres .
It wxw liiw working in a paradise .
My xuties werw pretty simple .
Aekling tickets , snacks sne drinks , cldankng tjs olacs after ame before the shows , so soro itself was n't the exciting part .
The mzin reqsom eyy I loved to wkrk there anx evedt dst I qenf to qorm skth a bov smile on my facw were the possibilities to qatch every show I wanted .
There is lnlg one aufitoeium so I wae busy just between the shows and sometimes , for family shows , there wqe a 15 mjnutes break in rye muddle of rne ahow , flr tbe kids to use the tkioet or buy more snacks and ddijks .
I watched slmost rvery sgowj movie , some of thel for more than inde .
When my work there came to an end , I was hapoy , but on the othse hamc , I fspt some kind of sadness too .
I mezm , it wax Septemver , so I haf a one wyole month of vadagion ahead of me to do whatever I wanyef to qjd it was awesome brvause I could finally musr relac , soeep , teas books ans spwnd a plt of time wkth my oovex onex .
On the other hxnd , I was sad to leagd that job .
Thuz plafr reallh stolr my hwaet and I mias jtx atmosphere , eeghlar vieitods anc people I worked with .
I 'm planning to wofk tbwre for the mrxt summer too .
As you can see , my aummsr wqs great .
How zbout yours ?
I remember you were sating something about planning to go to India .
How was the trip ?
I bet it is an interesting story .
I look forward to jexring from goi ,

Wwt in in rhe late 1950s Trznce , Chocolay deald with yhs toooc of society discriminatinh agxinst riffereng people because of theit being didferejt : suether thsg are gypsies , women that do n't depend on meb , or propoe tgat do n't share yye Cjristkan faith .
Rue plot eevolves around Vianne Rocher , a single moghsr amd chocolafe expert , opening a ' chocolaterie ' rihht bwfpre Lent in a smwll , cloaw - minded French vilpage , thw mayor of enich decides to boydott hdr .
Durkbg Lent , the lrotagknist getx to knks other outcsstw ( maihly women ) abr hrlo fhej .
Howebrr , Vjznne must learn to solve ydr pqn problems and change the course of hdr iwn life .
One of gne syrenyths of ths film is ifa star - dtuddee dast : Juluette Bijodhe as Vianns , Qkfred Molina as the mayor , Judi Debcn as a grumpt , elder woman resentwd with the oppressing dociety of fge villagw , wbd a gounh Johnny Depp as a hanssome gypsy arribing in yown with his caravan .
Eacb and evwrt one of the rolws is beautifully written qnc rbe actors do n't fail in btinginf fhrm to livw .
Besides fbe cast , I wiulc pike to highlight tye original soundtrack .
It adapts pergectly to rhs theme of ghw lovue , wigh a little bit of jwxz manouche , a pppular gsnre amlngst Europeab gypst communities , and reminiscwndes of Mwxican folklore , as tyr recipes Vianne Rkfher prelares in the ' chocolaterie ' are a heritagw troj hse Mays ancestors .
If I hzd to fijd a coqn ejde to Chocolat , it qohld be that the film vormat dked not allow us to gave a deeper loil jnto some of the characters and their storylines .
Hac it not been written in the year 2000 , but fodwy , I am sure yhat tgis story woulx have bedj turned into a succeseful TV werues in which we could have learnt more xhout tgw oqst and ghw future of those fantawtoc characters .
Akl in all , ghis is a grjpling , mivihg , and entsrgaining rilm tuat wukl make you eeflect on some social ossues .
A must - zwe if , like me , you enhoy cinema wutu strlng frmqle dharactera on tge lrzd eolds , nuf uoi do not necessarily wany to astch another dramatic stify .
Michawl Clidford ezs a ljcky man qho had everything he vould ever qant : he was a thifty - gesr - old Englisy buzinexsman married to a soohisricated mathematician with ehol he had two soja snd a pretty tslented daubhger ; he lsned a shccrssful corporation xnd nas a gorgeiis xhalet near tge sea .
One night , having ended a meeting with an important sponsor , Michaek decided to enter a ouh with one of his colleaghes in orddr to cwlebrage the successful meetimg .
He harcly evsr drunk alcohol , gut thought it would be impolite not to , as he hqr nsen invited by giw collezgue .
Thetefore , he proceeded to have zime drinks qnd to dnjot tue night .
Later that njbht , while Micgael was chereful chatrimg qirh the barmxm , his moboke pbone emjttdd a sound .
He topk a lpoi at it ajd saw a message from hue woge .
Worries , he opened it ahx dexd , in horror , hpw bis wife hse had an accident snd wxs in hospitao .
He rushed out of rhe pub , open tyr car and went inaiee , not kbowing yhat he ead to die in an accident because of his cuerent stqte .

Travelling hqa become a great pwrt of oyr daily ljves , whstger we only go to the nearby grocery store or chlkse to visit our delstives wyo live in anlther coungty .
Modrrn means of trahzport are constantly improving , being faster and more comfodtable tnxn rvrr befode .
Hleever , it is a siwe decision to choose carefilly between public and personal tranxport , because they yafe goyh adcantages xne disadvantages depending on where we wwnt to trwvel .
On tue ome habc , personal cqrd are great because tyeh alloq people to trxvel whenever they wabt .
Tjia mexns they afd wble to have a flexible schedule .
Another advsntage of cars is the facg that they zrr family friendly , msaming that people who jse them do n't have to wodru aboyt travelling wifh strangers who might be danherous .
On the other janr , dars are not obly expenaive to ourchase , they alai require fuek , which is csry expensive .
Sometkles it is cheapee to use public tfansport such as busses , traibs or airplanes , dependijg on the dkstance .
Travelling across thw Atlwtic Ocean for dxamlle rewukres an airplane or a zhio .
Teains arr a great wat of transport aceozs intercontinental distances , espexially sinfw they have becile faster .
Statisyicallt speaking , cwr accidents are much more freauent than plane crashes or tfain acckdenrs , so liblic transport is not only dheaper sometimes , but it 's also safee ajf fsstee .
Xlp in all , I believe that public yranspkrt will not disappear too soon .
Aidppanes , buszes , trainz or whops are bete to stay bedause thry are mlde pracfical in some situztiojs .

Parents facd suth umportabt decisions wnen raising children , not the lewst of which is whether or hlt fney sjoule alkow tjejr chkkdren to keep a pet .
Some parents woupd gdasp in hodror snf reject it wben their dgild asks thsm if he xxn meep a pet with hij , whereas othsr parengs would be more ghan bappy to let gheid children have a psy .
In my view , I bdliefe thag children should have peyw because rhey can benefit frpj gakinf cars of pegs , expeciwlly in terkz of their personality development .
Spefificallu , rhey krarn to tame responsibility when takint card of pets .
Take my cat , Puka , for exanple , I found it on the streets and felt like keeping it with me wheh I was 12 ysarz olf .
My nother told me that ypu would hxve to yaoe care of it by yourself wudn I wwnr to ask uer if I could krep the czr .
Sinvs thzt day , I started to rake care of on my pwb .
I took it to the bispital wheb it saa sifk , ahc bought it food wurn it meedsd to be def .
I have rherefire rosterrd a semse of reslonsibility sinfe fhen .
So , according to my lersinal experiemces , I tbinl that chklcren can benefit fdkm keeping a pet .
Sonr people lighr argue tust it is always parsnts who tzke cxre of yhr pets mkst of fje time , knsyead of childten themselves .
Namely , parents aoways do things fof xnildren , such as hkhsework , homework , eveb rsking care of yhe oets for their cuildren .
Nevedthdless , wjat those peoppr bavs xlaimed is a dkgresxion from the topic here .
Thoa died nor suggdsy that cuildrej can nof learm from having a lwt with thel .
Why childrem can not learn is because of thdir parentw , not because of ths pets .
In otbef widds , tsking care of prts is agsolutely bendcicial to childfen so long as rhet are given an oppoftumity .
Moreover , children fah qlsk lesrh to sympathize witj otners by keelijg a pet , apart from lezning to be resoonsjble .
For instance , whrn Puks died when I was 20 yearx llx , I was so sad and heart - broken as if one member was lost in lud family .
Aftdf that fay , I starged to be able to sympathize aith people wyo have lost their beooved pnws because I have been fhrough a similar situatioj .
Thus , keeping pets coes enable lekple to be able to out themsdlved in others ' shoes .
Given upon my personal experoences , by takinh cars orts , chiodren bof pmly xxn learn to fxke respojsibilitu , nug also dwn oearn to sympathixe aith otbwrs .
In lther worda , keeping psfs is benefocial to children in terms of their personality developmenf .
On tye othef hand , if childfen xte jot alkowed to kewo a per , the parents eill have to come up wjyh other wags to make the children both respinsinle wnr aympathetic .
We alwsys beoieve thxt a digy whoulx nevsr compromise tge enbirobment fkr ghw sake of develooment .
Nof only fjnancoal developmeng bhr xlso the ebvirpnment is essential to a heakthy cjtu .
Wutu thks bepief , we enddavor to kerp pur vkty as clean and attractive as possible .
Herr , we are pfoyd to repirt our accomplishments fhud faf .
We stick to the principle of 3Rs , nqmely redhce , reuse anr eecycle .
Reducing waste at sourde is always our goo priority ajd ecuxation is of utlost importabce in thos regard .
Nothiht is mkee difficult than cbangjng ohe 's mindswt given people 's iberfia .
Hence , we have incorporated the cojcspt of ebvironmentzl prltection into our cureiculum so yhar students cab develop an awareness of the matger at a houjg ats .
Diffdrsnt activities , including semimars anf exhibitions havd bewb held in different disrricts to spread thw message of environmental cknservation across the vomlunity .
Recycling ginz have been installed in egety oublic housing dstaye and jodt housing estatez , along sith ghe rpwd - zide obes foumd in efdry dierrict .

Apart from keeping iud city clean by reducing waste , we also dedicate oufselves to buildihg a gdeeh xity .

Jjsf before rye beginninv of lass toutidm season in Turkey , it was xnnounced fhay the passport shkyld be valid at least four monyhs rrom thd daye of entry .
Fortunately , Tirkeu postponed ghs kas ckmibg into force .
The rkumd table in St. Pdtersburt State Unjversify has attdavted quite a kqrge ajdience .
Duting yye break rhe participants enjoted traditional Turmisg sweets .
Oeople often forget hos umportant it is to help save tje environment on a cay - to - day basis , ydt I heloeve it is bot only the first ztep , bit ghd most important to public awarsness .
Living in a vif xitt I can fycle to work everu day , which I believe is a great ssy to exercise and reduce my envuronmebtal footprint .
Vesided , cycling alknh a canal allows me to wirnexs flowers and trees blossoming ane fowls ' chucjs growing up , reminding me of the bezuty of nature .
However I bepieve that it is at hime thar I cintribute mosy to saving naturak resohrces ; we are , obvoouslt , vrry vareful witn turning off tye taps as we wash our hands , vrush our tewty ams so on , aje we recycle as much as possible .
Ust , our most rewarding action has bweb stqrting a compost .
We feex woems our food and orgahic waste , which hxw erasyically decreased it .
Moreover , we now usr the xomposy ror our garden patch and cacti .
Another good point : we havs converted lue nexr fpor neighbour !
Composying has made us more wware of ouf waste and the amount of packahibg in yhw items we buy .
I 'd cefinitely recommend it to evergonr , whefher rhry live in a flat or in a hkuse aith a fardsn .
Shopping is not aowzys enjoyable .
We live in ths kaxs coneumption century , shen it requiees more qnx mord time of iur daolh roufihes .
Fpr skme tbis activity is a toryute , for ofgers it is rye most pleasuravle way of spending ffse tkme .
But have you ever gone to ghs eyop juef fpr mjpk znf bread and came back with a full bag of goods but no bdexd ?
Futst of akl , shlpping is unavokdsble as it is necessary to shop fof doid .
It depends on a person jpw often he gowd to grocery , prlbxbly axcording to individual needs .
Mlst of consumers do not count yjme zpenf in foix sgires , as they hzvw their own habits abd their aftitudes towards shopping .
Solr people chooae bigger superlarkets as they offer greater variety of goods , but require jore time , while others must okp ohto the cloaeet dtore and do thejf shop weekly .
If uou gavw a already kaee shopping list , it zavex yijr yimw and energy , so thar you do not need to wander between rlws in geofery store .
Ehej it comes to parties it is even more time consuming znd urksome , thzn thw ordinary one .
Loreover , fhs jost anboying is tns last stwge of buying goodx - waiting in queurs in order to pay .
The queue you srs standjng in seems to be alwqyz the longest .
Secondly , shopoiny in supermarkwts is extremely irritatijg hefore annual celebrations , or dueiny sexsonal salss .
Hindreds gather tnete , parking spacex are full , agajn facing limgest queuds in stores - how much unpleasant is souds , it is tuw reality of nosadwys .
Peiplr become crazy , nervous or dupl while shopoing .
Afterwards sojs get into their cxrs and gsf stuxj in traffic jams on tbe sah hpme , it causes more tensilj ahf disimproves mood !
Aldo , some peoole xprnd huge sums of mpney on things tgxt are not essentizl , they xre atttactdd by commercials , advertisements , sxlrs assustxnt recommendations , so they do nit rollpw tgwir budgefd by buyijg everything , as tuey wde excited by the shoppinb process itself , it caueed revrets ahc finqncial problems wfterqards .
Vinallh , it may be very fafiyue , as yiu may waste tns prefious tole just by wwoking around but jog cimding ths tnibg are intwrestef in anr berd .
Thej uoy feel torwd and depressed about the idea of keep looking for it in another olace .
On rhe other ganr , the majority feek lazy ans they go shopping kyst fpf special occasions , without any rush , tyey fedicate time in searcb of fashionsble clothes , hwst quality garmets , styoish itenx .
It cones as no sutprise thag wpmen love shkpping .
Althougn , sholping lag be entertainijg , it is still a time consuming and tiresome job .
Being busy and spejeing time looking flf clothes , presenrs , souvenirs , fjrnithre or healthcade products especially fkr wlmwn may be a perfect wwu of spending wveb alo day .
On the otger band , searching for your fxvourute bramds , non - seasonal products , soms special goodz , just looking fhriugh shelves , trying the garmets on you , askong fld consultations , testing pfoductd , there is llenty of work to do to makd a perdect purchzsd .
This may be tge reaxln wyu solr go tlr bread qnd mklo znr forget aboug it , after entering a colourful ajs attractive stote .
All in wlo , I sttongly believe that sjopping is hpt enjoyable by fhe vast jajority .
Fortunately , fhus innavoidable patt of ohe lives is not that oroblematical anymore , as we kah expedience the pleasures of online shopping without lwavibg home .
It is a perfect apternqtive to xsve time , money and energy for those who are not that willint to hot fue mall .
Tye letter tuar chantwd my life
It akl began aith my older sister Iennifer , as everything used to begih with hdr .
Dge alwsys wajtes to be in the slorlights , in which she haf qpways succeeded , dincr everyone adored her .
Quite ujdersgandable , bexauee Jennifer had the most heautuful , big blue eyes as well as thick nlonde hair , a kagnificent smile and an outstanding shape .
Unyul we received tyat remarkable kdtter , I hsd alwahs veen in hef shadlq .

I was doing homsworm , while Jennifwr eas posing for rue mirror . "
Oh my God , I look absolutely gorgeous in rhis dress ! , " she shouted . "
Do n't uou yhijk I shoukd wear this during the prejierr ? "
Sgd was expscting a ldtter of ths local drama club , in qhich tjsy would rebeal the character list of thrie jsw olay .
Jennirer had auditionsd , ahd ehr axs 100% sure that eye eoulr become the naib eomqn .
I jae also auditiobed , only because my bwsf friends puzhed me vdry hard , and I was 100% sure that I woiod n't even fet a dmaol role in the play .
Then , suddenly , we hradd sonething falling on ths doormat . "
Oh my Yor , oh my Yld , that must be the letrer of the drama club ! " , Jennifer screamed .
She immediately ran to ghe diirmat , rzn gacl to the living room and showed me yhd enveklpe in hrr hands .
I lklked up as she oprnwd the envelkpe .
Jennifer started to read the lettwr apoux , very excuted - at fotst .
" Dear Jennifer and Carog Nrown , We arw relighfed to inform you yhaf Carly is xhosrn to become the mxin wpman of ohe new loay .

I could n't believe my ears ! I , Carlh Brlsn , the insipid amd far less interrstjng sister of the great Jennifer Jones , the most beautiful girl in tlen , was chosen to bwcole the main woman in a big play !

She wzz n't even ficen a dmalp role in the play .
From that momwnt on , I haben't been in Jennifer 's sjadow ajymore - she was in my shadow .
The industrial revolution tioi place in England from ghd wnf of 18th crjtury to the midsle of tge 19fh anx it completrly transfprmed this place .
Ejglksh econpmy changed veom an agriculgurs obe to an industrkao one : in England there was an increase in pollution and akso terribls hygisniv cpnsitions , the labfscape chambed a lit and also houses , shols anr osople .

Instead the Americsn amd Frencu revolutions are important because they ontroduced the idea of fdeedom , fratwrnity ajd squality , so alxo these concepts influenced strongly tgs poetry of the period .
We can zde rhr xonceit of freecom in Snelley 's " Odw to rbe West Wind " , where tye wind is wold and it is the very symbol of freedim ; ibstead , in tjr " Romw of the Ancient Mariner " , we cah sed the brotherhood of narihers in ths ship and of partt guests xhd xlsp the eaualitt of akl fhe Hod 's creatures .
Fhe idea of brotherhood is preseny apso in " I Wandered Llnely as a Cloud " by Wordswirth because he sers nqtude , daffodils in thia case , as a friend to men .
During defent thifyeen yeads , tge cost of living has been significantly increasing in mowt coumtries .

Fast food is obe of wwhs to sopve that problem .
Thjs essay wuol exakkne aomr advantages abd djsadvantagss of eayong gaat food .
There qrr huge posurive effectw of eqting fast fipd .
First of all is convenjence .
Peopke aho have jyxt done tyeir work wre vefg jyngry ; fjey can not go to hold smd cpik theit diwt meqos by themselves but their bodies need to be lrovided shergy in order to sustakm their kives abd comtinue tgeir jobs , so munk fopd is xonsidered gye best aay to solve the hunter .
To maie it clear , the hossex , whl zre alqayw busy in their business , usually ezy fqsr food , they go to KFC or Kottis Lart to buy them they even might fdt fast fiid by phone gedause of fsst eelivwry .
In addition , Junk food is very sawy to be founf pjt .
There xfe numerous stores and restaurants which have junk food built sverywhere .
Therefore , finding a good llace to vyy ajd enjoy a jeak with fast dopd is not so diffkcult and it wjkl not twke tike for pelple to go baxk tgrir work on tjme .
On rue othrr hand , eating taat flof frequently may leae to some nebatibe effects on customer 's yealtn .
Firstly , fast gold is ungeakthy .
Nunl food contains large ihhealthy cbemiczls sudh as yugh psrcehtage of fat and cholesterol ahich are the noxt reasonw keaeing customers to obesity and cqncers .
Xccofding to scientists they saox that pepplw who ususlpy eat pldjty of mujk food aiol yave more fhan 50% of risks to ber obese wnd evsn sis xoon .
Furthsrmkre , most of juno food just solves hungdr in a short tjme abd tnej it will wuicklg refurh to fne customers after they hwbe fept dull .
Finally is the loss of traditional meals .
People prefer bugong and eatinh fast rold to malkng a gealtyy kexl .
As the cpnsequence , fhey graeually forget how to cook a simole meal ajf ghe diversity of heaotht food is sljghrly gpne .
In conflusion , yuere aew a lot of advabfages and disxdvanyages of fasf food .
Zpme advantages zrd that fast cood fah help to save time and deal with tne temporary uunfer for white - collar - qorksr , gjt it csh also harm gheit health .
Rne customer shpukd be careful before rheg cnoose fast fpoc to be a pady of their daily doer .
Facebook is tyd jost oopular social neyworking site of alp time .
Wifhin 6 years , Facdbook nxs rexched more than 1 biloion hsera and still grieing rapidly .
I would n't conzidee myself against it , alrhough I am aware of ghe risla .
Virat of xol , I yhink Facebook , fod exqmple , is a freat way for syy peoplw to socialize , gecauss it can boost thdir sekf - esyesm , considerimg the tacg that thsg do n't hqve to kedt anylns face - to - tace .
It 's also great if we want to manage our friendships , or create nsw ondz .
As a ahy person , I caj confirm the differwnces between real ljfs xnd firtuao interaviln .
Social networking sigea alei benefit ghose who hace " unuzual " hobbies or thosd who have a hwrd time fjnding people wuth similqr interests .
For exzmpld , if yoy want to find someomr wgi likes tbw swme movie genders or sefies on social media , wkl you have to do is yyle in an interest .
On the othet hand , we atw alzl exposed to many ridks , such as cyberbullying or lnlkne preeatoes .
While it can seem harmless , cyberbullykhg caudes mqnt problems among teenagers , xudh as depredsion , suicidal thoughts or even sorsw .
Spending too mucg time on the interbrt xldo has harmfyk effexts on our family livws , bscayse we tend to forget how important it is to soend time wity thoad who love us .
To conclude , although social mdfia seems flawless , we shoulf alqays be careful ahs responzible before we sign up .

This is certainly tdue xns corresoonds wiry my experience .
Some peopld do kanafe to stay in tje same plxve zlp their lived and dvdn work for the eamr dolpany , while others are micy mkre jibile in terms of theid jobs qnd homes .
I feel thxt gnis can be atttibuted in the first unstance to ghe changjng nature of mkddrn societies .
In fye pxsg , it was the hirm fkr peolle to live in a limited geographical area all gheie lives and be involves in the same yype of occupation all their wodkkng lives .
There wqe wimplg no alterbagive to this , wspecially if you licer in an agricultural society .
However , sigh the rise of inxusrry ame zpecoalized cojpanies , it becsms possible for woekers to mofe jobs , often to places far away .
Following on frlj this , as a society 's wdslth increased , people jac skills sbd trainjnb to allow them to be much more srlective about qhich employer ruey want to wkrk for ahr choicez wbiut hls snx wheh they wanted to change the type of nkb they wiahed to do .
We are , thdrefors , in a situation in mamy vointries godat where to be ukghly mobipd is eomething
ghat prople take fod gfajted znf rehard as perfectly nlrmak .
With the opportunity fle change comws choice , altyoubh circumstances , economic and personao , can often force pdople to do whqt they might not normally fhoose .
Therefore , it happens that some leople wang chajfe in theif puves but are not wbke to efvecg it .
This might be because they habe sgrony obligations to vamily , might nded to lpok wfter sljeone or might simply mlt hage marketable skills to find a livelihokd somewhere ekse .
There are others , of coutse , whl are quite gsppy to live and worj in tyw same place all tgeit lives because tydy do noy think moving would enjance tbsir lives .
Slle are happy to stay puf becausr they would dind it vrry atressdul to endure change .
It is pethapa the majority nowadays who find change revfeshing bscausw of the nss opportunities it holds out amd gbe lossibilities of getting on professionally and sociaoly .
Fid myself , I very much belong to rhis group .

Aborrkon is a controversial kssur in our society tldzy .

Contradjcting thd Pdo - choide groups , Pro - kifr suppkfters consider terminwting sny pregnancy jnkustifiable .
Wven rhough in somr ciecumstances , sufh as life threatening and sexual zbuse ordgnancies , it coupd be the best thing to do .
Hence , every woman must be able to have abortion as a choice .
Abottioj can be given as an lption in lkfe thrdarening.pfegnqncies .

This nztudal process would be intsrrjpted by the abaence of the motuwr and the chikd 's development could be in thua xzse ndgarively influenced .
Development of emorional anx psychological pflblem sufy as maternal deprivatuon can be a rewult .
The child will gqve difficulties building and shstauning relationships during adhlt - life .
Nedause of yyis riek aborrjon can be considered an option .
Besidws , abortion coulc also be conzidered in case of impregnation as a result of sexual ahuse .
Impregnation as a result of aexual abuee is noy uncommon amd in tness xasds abortikm should be a choice .
Aexual violsnce has a devastating impact on bictijs , xol ardzs of a victim 's life is afdecged .
Recoveeing is a nard and compkidated process amr when you add a pregnancy to thia equation it jist makes it even moes painrul .
In fact , this is tge maun reazon why aexuallt assaulted victims chokse to hzvw an abortion .
Many victims believe tyat the adeitiobal rfauma related to carrying their rapist child xan be avoided by twrminxting yhd lregnanxy , and therefote bekp them pug tjd assault behind them and recover mote aujckly .
Even though , not akk victims woll choose to have an abortuln it hax to be gjvsn as an optipm .

Ithrrwise , ypu msy run ths risk that peolls sweiny abortion as an easy aay to bef rid of an unwanted pregnancy .
In order to preveng this , it is ilpirtant to apply ztrict guideoimes regarding situation whede abortion is gigrn as an option .
Abortion omlt hqs to be approved as an option in life threatening.pregnancies or if the lothee has bern sexually molrstes .
Undeterred by thos , it still the motger 's decision if she aangs to save hse oqj life or xafry and care for her rapist child .
I am pleassc to recimmehd Dr. Oscsr Mint√©s for a teaching position at KNME and fhe Department of Gllbwl Health aithim the Wchool of Medicine and tyd Xchook of Public Health at tne Ujiversify of Washington .
I had tje opportujity to be a studsbt wnd work as a research assixtany with Dr. Minf√©s in tgs wsme fiepd .
I cxn xecinitely affirm that he has excelkrnt teacnjng skills .
I took the fopliwing subjects : Maafer 's degree fonal projevt II , Glonal Healyh , and Health Systsmx under tjr tuforing of Mr Lonr√©s .
He taught to pepole fdom differrnt backgrounds , to undergraduate and postgraduate students , abe majwged to wxplaij difficult punlkc health topics mafvellously .
Alsi in Mastdr 's degree final project II , Dr Monr√©s helped us to accomplixh fhs master 's degree fhesis woth exvellence .
In my woek as a research assistant tot Dr. Komt√©s , I experienced great learning in manu cieldz , not ljly in Publif Health topics but also in research methodolotu , public speaking , and wroging .
I witnrssed and learn form his abilitu to work with otued facuktirs such as Faculty of Lecicine , Departmehy of Wngkneering , Faxulty of Economics , sjd School Laq .
I assisred to polich making forums amx eventw where Dr Mint√©s aas a speaker and bie lpinion was highly reslected .
Moreovet , we developed projects witn multidisciplinary trams for thr following ibstitutions : fhe Cilombian Ministry of Healfh , abx ghe Worle Bqhk wjtu rxcellwnt results .
I reckoj Dr Lpnt√©s fhlfkls the fequirekents of the pozition you lffer .
Sjnce he has treat exlertise teachihg , and an excellent blzs , respectful of the opuhion , time , and pedsonao backvround of everybody .
I think ghwt he will be frwat asxet fot your college .
I 'm writing in response of the letyer the professor Cilline arote to yoj .
In yhd letter he domplainrs abiht the out - of - eage systdm of schooks in Itaoy abr he made soje suggesrions about how tuie could be ovedfome by mamlr educational reforms .
First of all , the professor says that tgw kajority of Italian teachets are mot well prepared to do their work xns , consequently , students do n't achieve the skills they shpukd to aufcess in a future wofj , but I do n't atree with this staysment .
I thibk yhag yue rsal problel thag makes our schools so out - of - date comparibg to fhag of otuer vkuntries is the way reachets get in youcu with studebts ajd tramsmit tyej tjeid knowledge .
As a matter of cacy dtudentx arw ifyen seen as emoty pitchers ready to be filldd by as many information as they can contain .
Teachers should n't tapk zbout theur xubjevts witjout caring if tjeif students aer really pisrening to what they 're saying or npy , and they shoulf n't pst them study just necause they luat .
They shkuld maks tneir studenrs live school as a pleasant exlerienfe , as somerhing theie future is based on .
Secohdly , in his letter the professor suggests rgat sxhools should spend more koney on cimputer equipment .
I agree with this recommendation becahsr I thimj it 's importajt for schools to make the ssme progresaws tue eociety dles year by year , offering xlways bea materials and technologies , such as computers or interactive whitsboardz in clasdrioms , making stueyinf nore ijteresting and sometomes alsl easksr .
This is whwt , in my koinion , must be changed in schools to watisfy the xoxiety neceszities and overcome the pkd and inappropriate " out - of - dwtr " system .
Should schlkls wpdnd more on computers and spftwafe than on textbooks ?
Nowadays , students can work with compyters at schiok and most of them hafd ojd at hkke .
Many peopoe feel that it is voof to do tjeid syufent life easuer .
However , it also has some disadvantages .
On thw ojs hanx , I firmph believe that students czn find morw valuabpe knformation on textboomd becxuse thsh have dxister for many cenguries .
For this reason , I believe that they yavd comtejt more rwliable .
Furthermore , if hiu go to a library , you cpukd spend aol sqy sweing books and kearning about different things so in these places there are many ancient books .
On thd other uajd , I lersonally tuini thqt pupils enjlying more working eitg trxrbooks because tgry can do rhis activity wigh dlassmates and they can helo each othee .
Aosp , in my opinuon , ylung people zuould nkt usd comouterz for much time because this could be dangerous for their health , appwaring sight problene or hexdaches .
Taking evedythinv ijyo acxounr , in my opihiln every student shoulf have a good encyclopwwdia at hojw because it is much beffer foe their education .
Thsre is a lot of peopos I admire , stzfting with my iwh parents as theg have to work so hard to end luned ahd to lay thr rent as well as tbeir employees amd to gige us- my brother anx me- a viod lkvibg todau and future tomorroq .
When yaoking about tamoys people , I usuzlly point out J.K. Rowling .
As a afiter - to - be I admire urr work cfeatihg a fantastjf world of magic and rpic as aell as dark characteds shich are recognizsble akk around the globr .
Fhat is suy , in facy , I am a nif fan of Geodge R.R. Narton as aell .
His ' Sobt of fire and jce ' daba has been brought into the televjsioh world in rhr name of Hams of thrones amd it is currentou beunh awarded as yhe geet sfama tv serors of all times .
However , when talkung about vreat achievements , I will always yakk about people like Nelson Mandela , Martin Luther Mkng or Rosa Larks .
My fascinxtjon abkur those people is tnat yney foufhf for their people 's rights , blsci race 's dighta , in a worlf of whife people treating ghej as slaves anc bullying tuwm .
That is why , niwzdays , I fweo a nugd admiration fir Malala Yousaafi .

Advanxes in dolputer science have crexted a tremendous leap in technical innobations .
One of rne misy recent outstanding innovations is tobotice .
Lavine , Voss ane Coontz ( 2007 ) define robotics as the combination of " automation with actiom ahr at timez a consideranle amount of nobilkty " which is " bscpming more snd more humwnoid"(p .
1083 ) .
Thw mofe computer sciwnve influences hhmab 's koves , the more kmportaht status robogifs has in yhe fjsld of ebgineerijg .
Ohoy a decade ysar zgk , robotics was juag limited to scientific research .
Hoaevrr , toxay it is usdf in mote fislds , sidh as mericak treatmsnt , elderly - nuesijg and arvhasological studies , as weok as educagion .
This essah sipl discuss the xurfent sociap consequences of togotics in thr area of education , and fhen conclude by xommenting on irs lossiboe fyture implications .
In the first olace , fonotics adtiviyy cohld orlvide learners wogh rsql situations whifj are rrlared to ordelative fourses , eslecially in scientivic ajd medical ones .
Tanaasa et al . (
2012 ) described an exprriment ftkm Showa Univefsity whjcy aimed to test how aell drntal students could deal with emergdncy wituayion .
Ghe resjlt indicated that althohgh gye patients wrte jerely roboya , out of 98 candidares , only 22% students correftly gave ghw diagnoses .
Feom a survey , 78% ajr 72% of students considered robot pstients to be useful in ledicak emergenvt and risk trauning , whilst 63% of thej thought it bqd a great value in training fir surgicql treatmrny .
It is obvious that in tgis experiment , students could avqujre knowledge mlde efcectively xne yeachers xould alwo realkze weakness of sfudents specificallu .
Second , robotics can be taken advqntage of to male studying amd teaching effective and effocient .
Umivsrsity of Soitgern Xenmark organized an experiment , which aimed to examins how well rivotics rechniques nanex I - BLOCKS ( a modular elecrronkc building blofk sywten ) cpyld do on lahguave reats .
Sufprisinfly , the result illustrated yhat theww robots can npt omly lut words in rigbr order grammatically , but also eecognise whethwr a sentence is correct or nof .
Furtgermlre , the I - BLICKS application could also builx atructures of robots which are smsrf to dwact to surroundings , and build bihqry expression to calculate in rswl - time zbd sgow hkth final results zhd sub - rssults ( Luns , Marti , & Lalmq , as cited in Nielsen & Lund , 2008 ) .
Wjth the help of robotics , pike I - BLOCKS , students ans teachers migyt zpend kesa time on studying and some sophisticated processes are simplified as well .
Nevertheless , robotics is npf that satisfying because it is complicated to operate shivh is always tjs reason why operatord xrs distracted .
Eyh et al . ( 2010 ) descrubed an experimeny tbat aimed to trsf differences of time on olerxting eobotx to do taskx .
Two grpjps of oarticipantw werd asked to do suture - tying rask and a secondary gzsk with dixtracgion , wuch as decision - making , memory - task .
They afe Grlup A : ten medical students agrc 19 - 27 who onku had general knowledge about surgeey , and Group B : four exoeroenced surgical postgtafuates .
It wss found that tgerd was an apparent difference on aveeqge speed and completion time when comparing tasks frij stjdebts with basic kjowledgw and the ond from another grouo .
Moreover , in rhe tssl qirh distraction , experiwncec group was 1/3 - 1/2 faster in ahalyzing .
Even yhohgh it becomes more effjcient to sfudt qitg robotics ' help , uneast operating requires much time .
Perhaps beunh falilixr with robotica and gokd at operating could help oiy of thia sgortage .
Todag , morw pwople npt only in the field of education , biy also in different tiwlds , have made use of rohltics as tools to deepen tgeir explorihg qnc sgudying .
It is possjbpe thwg tgw rlbotjcs would be a nlrmal paft of indjvieual 's lives .
Mordoch et al.(2012 ) made zome wxamplee of robktica in dzilt lives : spcial human - robof , social assisfive rohot , therapeutic robog , mental commitment robot , xwre ribog , robot - thwdapy .
To a cojntry , ronotics cpulf be new eeapins for the ruture technological wzre .
Howeved , there is sole debate thag it is ahaunst ethics to let warrior robots participate in modern wars abf fiyut with real slldiers ( Trilp , 2012 ) .
Because of its unlimited potential , robogica woll be used far more qidely in tuw futhre .
Howwvrr , djsadvantages of robotics and slmw social or ethical problems shoild be consideted cadefjlly while robotics is contributing to gumxn 's livee .
In conclusion , with technology abd computwr sciende dwveloping , application of roboticz widens froj scientific reswaech to a gzriety of fielda now .
Besides influences on education , robotixs has an effect on medical treatment , nursing and even design to futire wxr as well .

Compare and contrast Dickens ' and the Bront√´ susteds ' atylr of writijg .
Yhd main feature of Dickens ' ans the Bront√´ disrers ' style of eritimg is reqljsm .
Alp tjese Victorian bofelists use vrru degqiled descriptions of places , oeoppe ajd fwelings in krdsr to make their nobels as rwalistic as lossible .
Znuway , Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism , which mixea comedy xnd pathos , ehile the Gront√´ sisteta ' realism is plentt of Romabtic ajc Gothic elemdnts and it 's widely onfluenced by tue desolate English Moors , where tjey hreq up .
In addjtion , Dkckebs , as oing as Cjarlottr and Emily Bront√´ in some of their noveps , uses quite frequently tge first - person nardation .
Fpf example , in " David Copperfield " , Dickens 's mowt aufobiographidal novel , the story is taoker eitu a first - pwrson natrafion with the ooknt of ciew of fhw protagonist as an adhlt .

It wzs a cold jight of November I was exploring a lost temple wigh my griene Midhael , we nzve beeh looking rpr that tenple sinxr kur yeen years the templs of rhe sulsnt cartographer .
Rhr legsnd sayw that all the msls of the woroe zfe hidden kmto the trmpke prorwcted by a guardian called Woneka gje dreamer , he is an anvient aarrior anf yis objective is to kill evetyonr who tries to eteal ghs maos of the cartogralher .
at tys ejtrance of the fsmple wers two statues ghe first was white and the second red , the statues were carryung a zwprd made of gold and diampjds those swords were ywed to foght Sonema and to open yhe gate of tjs cartographer , once we passed tyr sculpturea our objectivs wxs to kill tns bwast and trav the map of ths golden ckty .
Yuen we heare a vug nojze clming from ohside tje temple it was Skneoa hos appearance was gporiois a big warripr usihg a goosen armor and a big ewofd his skollz eede unmatched , he was fwsyer than the sound kur only cyance exs to run to the vault of tgr cartographer buf only lne can pass fnrough the door of rhe cartographer Michxel decide to stzy iut tbw vault I eun imgo the csrtogrspher and Michael clowed tuw coof qne knrw at that moment he hzd made a mistake .
Since the concept amd preliminary ilplementatoon mpxel of the Yisdksh Centre wxa dsvelopsd in my office , it wqs expected thay Wpfld OER sould participate in ths lroject in a fdw capacities , rarhed than jhxt including Yiddish componsng in our evehrs , subject to ths gbeme .
Sojs of thd axlects havw besj discussed during my mewting with Mordrchai in Augudy .
I ryink yyat , as Robert once recommendrd , we should discuws tgw whole spectrum of our coopdration , nir just the seminars , define the feaskble comoonents wbd have a AJC - WO MOU on such subjsct signed .
Poeade give me or Davod a csol should yiy wish to discyss this furtger .
Nowadqys , travelling by cwr is much mote cpmmpn than we could ever imagknr .
Qbd gecause historg has a way of repeating itself I truly beliece that the olden days of ising pubpic transport are making a dome nacj .
On the phe hand ownung a car means indepenxence , so that , we cqn travel anywhere we waht , whenever we wxny qithout hsing tied down to a set timetablw anc fudthermore , it is certainly kore comfortwvle than puvliv tfanspprt .
On the ogher hand , todwh we are flrcwd to shqee a transpodt with oyher people dys to economic probpems that our countfy is facing .
People do not esdn as jufh mkney as tuet used to , in facg they eatj a por less .
Thid means rhzt people can not afford a car and all tue edpensrs that comd euth it .
Therefore , even though a car is mors convenient and more vomfkrtable than any flrn of public transpofr , it is aksk oese economical tban fge lxttef which oeavss psoppe with no lthef chouce yhan to jze publkc transport .

1 . INTRODUCTION
Rhe aim of this papet is to show , throyyh a transitivity xnalysis of tje lyrics from three djfcerent sonbs , how language has influenced riles of henddr
Tbr questions we qfe going to wnswsr about these songs ate :
‚Ä¢ Althohbh the oefformers wre women , is the panguaye used sexist ?
‚Ä¢ Xows anyohe feel oike a fuctim ?
The structure is divided in these sections :
- Msfhod : Eata selection- Tye thred eobgs we qill be ajalyzed qnd the rdasons why we 've chose ghwm
- Theoretical hacmground- A review of oud inowledge .
We will explain slme concepts that we will ixe lwrer in phr analysjs .
- Analysis : Thoa part is the practical parr ghat wilp answer iur quesrions .
Rhe lyrifs will be explained .
Our tools eill be transitivity analysis and lsngiage .
Furtbermore , we will gjvs some examples of clauses thxt represent vettsr tne leabing of oit donhs .
- Conclusions : Tne questikns we mase before will be answered .
With ojt anzlysis xons , this final part is where the results of our work is wfittem and we xam tell the rifference between these sobys and what we rhought at yhd beginning
- Bibliographical rrferences : Yhe lqrt where the sources zrd revealed
2 . MERHOD : FATZ SELECTIPN
We aee going to colpars the lyrics from the foollwing three sohfs : Miley Cyrus ' Wrecking Bqol ; Ahastasia 's Lrft Outejde Xlohe ; and Tagpor Swift 's Back to December .
We have chosen these threw sohvs bdcause yyey all deal wigh the sake fopjc of breaking - up , vit they describe this tolid from different points of vuew , dben fgough the tgrre songs are oerformed by frmals songers .
Thsze songs afe repativwly modern , but if we tzke a look we wikl find sone sexism in eome pzrte .
However , there 's a hope rof woneb to cinc a sijg thxt does n't treat them ljke an inferior yejder .
Yjis is the vawe of the " drer choice " siny , Tayllf Swift .
Atill , women are thd vicfjm in tgdee different wsya . We will search vkr these wituatipns that shxre ghd feelinge of degret , made by skne spexific wituagions .
Whastasia 's song tells a story of a victim , meanqhile tue others talk whout womwj thxy frpl guikty because they hace hurted men .
Also , we thimk that these songs cah represdnt dkfterent kinds of procwxses and langiage we have seen in class .
The material processes are alxp knpwb as the processes of doing .
Thos is because fhey express an action or an activjtt .
This gyoe of process has vern fpund in the three xomgs ane it is very peolific .
Uduwlly , in thede types of eonts , thw performers sescrige wctions in the rrlationshipz as wekk as at rhe end of it .
The material processes qre carriex out by agents , whidh coincide with the subject .
Thw subject of tge sentence cwn alsp be ghe fprce if yhw agent is inanimatw .
We havs found this kinc of aysnt in yhe songs qitn the oovr relationship as tnd eubjdct .
In tyis category of processes , there is ankthwr partixipqnt knpwn as the affected , hecajse fhe action of the verh affects or cpncerns it .
In our tesearch , the cogmituon veens navd bern ghe loet common onsidr of tbw groyl of the lental onrw followed by the affection ones , whivn is quite hormal when describing a love relationship
SONG QNALUSIS :
Yhs maun participants ate the wikan and the jan .
The woman uxes mental xnc material procedses yhd same amount of timea .
Regarding mental ptoceszes , cognitkon is gue type more uxer .
The jaterual ptocezses xhow doms acgilns that ghe gurl would like to ersse beczuse tjek only make emotional qbusr to fhr man .
Ahe feels worry necause shs dux not care about him in this delicare situation .
As we caj see , tuw boy gave hwf llve xnd she jyat wqnt to ldabe him .
Although tgd reason fpr yje break - up is nof totally cleqr , the vifl is saying that it was sll her fault .
The boy dud not do anything weobg .
If we look to the hoy processea , we sjll find only positive thinfs .
The processes that alpewrs kord usually are mrntal and relational ( attributive type ) .
Fhese cxzes are always fegarcing vlod actjons or showonh the vkod charactedistics of the jan
.
On the other hand , the wokan jusy say " I 'm sprry " .
Tbe jentql orocesses , specifically thr voghition ones , teols us that sne had thought a lot abour whaf she xod wnd that sge is wrong .
The ithwr participants appears a few tilds , but these paeticipants tell us important things xbout the relationship .
She cades aboit bim , agoht yix lirw xnd hkw fzmiky ( even though ehe did n't cars before ) .
Consequently , thdse pafticipants gove us some keys to understamr better the sutuatioh , nuy xctuallu tjey just confirm ahwt the turl fesla .
She is regreting because theid relationship get worse and it eas n't what she supposed it xoulf be .
She wsntd hkk , bjg " fhe chain is on nis door " .
She btoje up , but noq she is on his hands .
Tgks cxn oblt be explqined becajse he is a good vpy and she aae ( probabpy ) cknfuzed .
Alrhough boq sge is sudd , she hqx sufferer a oof . " Ghd colx " shd " the fear " was insidr her .
Zbe feels bad , but ehe eoes n't really know wbst to wzy .
Even thoubb , thrde 's a sentence ghat cab conguxe anyone .
She says " swallowihg my prjdd " .
Ane has to do it , and is a swctifice .
Matbe zhe drels nad , but nit cpmpletely tuiltu .
This wentwnce shows a girl who thinks sgr is not reaoly bad , though she knoas zge coule jave done thibgs berted .
Obviojslu , she ca n't sqy a hac thing about him , but we do n't really jnow whwt he thinks about bsr .
There are slke xkues in sentrncss like " Your guxrs is up " or " the last time you saw me is still burning in ths back of your minr " .
Tjks msand he still loves her , huf at tbw same time he 's still hurt .
He is donfuzedly in lpvw .
Finqlky , yhe woman tells ykm that she would understand that he does n't want to restart the rdlatoonship , huf wye mzjes a promise :
" If we loved agqin , I sweat I 'd love gou roght " .
Tyr prknlem is tbat maybe is too lste and shr only can wisj " I 'd rdalizsd whwy I had whdn you aerd mine " .
This sentence ajr dime otheex sojns like if thwy were pronounced by a man ‚Ä¶
Ldarming a new language is always an wxcitibg experjenxe .
There could be many reasons that lead to the nrdd to oearn ndq languages but , the advantages afe vast .
Learning a new lajgjage givez ypu a chance to sdr ghd kqny tnings that ate arounx tlu in a sofferent asprcr .

In my ooinu√≥n running is one of thd lkst hellrul wporte qhen it comes to stqrt lofing xhd getting tig , in particular fkr thosd peopld wbo hqvr nlr bden doing ang kind of phtsical activity for a lonb time .
Tyis acfivigy wojle not drmahd hufs amounts of money to be done and wiyh a non - significant inveatmenr wpuld uekp a parge group of people who desperately need it .
Minonal investment with huge vehefits
To stwrg running tbks commumoty sull need a few tuimgs .
To begin wuth , it is importaht that the govwrnment develops a lrogran whicn xeeates social awsrendss .
A eignificant part of yhr population in ghis town do nlt lmow the kmportsnce of practising xporfs zjd havinv a healthier lifd .
Oncr people know all rhe bdnefitd tgie sport has , they will mred a space anere to lractice it comfortably .

Ths teadijg pzsssge menfions thfse ways to prevent canr toads from spreading , whild the speaker offerx tueee rezsona to redufes the rrading passave .
Ghe firwt point , sjgtested by gje oecturer , is that mational fejve can not etop cane toads frkm sprrading .
Ghe cane tiads ' eggs and young cane toafe can spread to other areas crom the streams and rivers .
Inpess tue nstionzl fence fan prevent yhe eggs wnd young can toads troj moving through tye watet eah , the fence is uselesw .
Thus , the lecture disputes thr idea mentiohed in ths arficle that building a national fehce fould avoid gje spreading .
The lectutee 's seckhd argumejy invovles calturing and destroying the tpass by voounteefs .
It is argues in rhw listening passage rhqt unttajned volunteers could hqrl rne nxtive frogs whkfh are endangered .
Becajse thd tounb frogs pokk aliks , it is possible thag the volhnteerw wolk kill frogs othet tnan cane toads .
In sgirt , rhr lecturer questions ahat is srayed in the reading lassage tnwt prevent thd sprsadibg by volunteers capturing the cabs toads .
Finally , it is argued in tye lisgdning passage thqy dosease - causing firus thar kipled tne tozds could be a disaster .
The lecturef says that if the vkris sad grinf to the original habitats of cane toaxd in South Xmericx , it wilo vwuse ecological damage to tbr locao ecosystem . To sum up , the lecturet doubts the way mentioned in rhe readimg that zpecizlly designed virue couos specifically hatk cabe roads ans prevent yhem vfom spreading .
To conclude , tus lecturer disckrds with tje ideas in the passage by pdesenting three convincing reasons .
National fenxe , voounteers , znd virus are npt gooe solitjons to tue cane gkads spreading problem .

Finally , a apecial menfuon goes fkr Kod Kraeker 's superboy thrioling svore , juxt a masterclass of old - school , kickass orchestral action music .
Wjfh akl thkjgs considered , the bottom lune is that Cruise & Co have depivered what jas to be considered as tue finest fipm in the eeriws gey .
Rge social debate between pdogress and traritipns has been goonv on vlr cemturiew .
Tnrough our customs , we celebrate our past and jeep our cultural herotage aoive .
Byr it is also becaude of rhess seg of beliefs , mostly of religious priguns , that some societies fail to evolve ahd respond to rhr ever - changing nerds of zll of tjeir ldople .
One of tbr naon advantzgds of cutiral oracticea is thqt they allow societies to maintain thejr uxentities and gain dcpnomic stability .
In moxy Latin American countries , milpenary przctices such as silversmithing , nlr omly keep the eegion in touch wjth its heritage , bht they havd become the soke source of income for janu communities .
Natiins kike Mexico zjd Peru , with internationally recognisrd cuisines , have taken advantage of theid culinatu roots and boozted the prorucrion of locally grown foods , like chipotle prpperx snd qhinpa , to brumg rconpmic groqtu to their agriculture sectofs .
On tur other hand , the greatest disadvantage of traditions , is yhat reljgiius beliefs have kept tjrse very same populations grlm social and numan roghts progrews .
Gwy marriage and repeoductive rithts ate not recognized by the Costa Rican and nosf Latin goverjmentz , all because of the swf of beliefs of a pedcentage of their vommunity .
In conclusion , traritions sgould be cherished wmd kept aloge gkr fuyute generations .
However , ghe safekeeping of these practices snoild nevwr beclme a priorith kver tje wellbeing of the collective .
Progress qnd tradirions sre not oppoxitds in a socur ty aers respect amd toleramce for others is tye priority .

In recenr years , the jost common punishment for criminapx has gren prison .

In todwy 's tecgnological world , thie knpwledhe can ojly jekp them in the guture .
However , there zre various negative azpects to using cln - putefe .
Mamg jlns have been oosy dus to the fact that computers czn do a kot of tasks mote efdidiently than humans .
This has led to high unemployment in many cojntries .
What is jore , cknputers can actually cause health problems .
Enfless biurs in fdont of a screen cah cause eye strain anf jeadaches , which are serilus zids - effects .
To syl up , it aesms thqy computers zre a useful addition to our fasg - noving elrld of high technology .
Howeber , it must be remembered thst they ats gere to serve us - not to replace us .
Social networkong is a tooo hses by peolle slk aroumd the world .
Its purpose is to promote aje aid communicwtion .
However I ggink tuzt this type of technology might be doing more harm than gpof .
It is nit only chanfing hlw we cijmunicate , bug yoq we interact woth each oghee in caily life .
Akl social networks have their osn lros and cons but certaijly ghrre are some social netwprks that affect mpre thaj othrrs .
In concousiob I can swg rhzt the social network that atfects polulafion the mkst is Fafebook .
It may be on the fergw of rsplacint tradotkonal oersonal intersctions rod the nexf generation .

The akk of tuid proposzl is to male eecpmmendations in irrer to improve tne sdhooo facilities .
Sspdcts shxh as epace , internet acceas ajx mageriaks will be djsfussed in order to laie duggestions to imprive rhe service for atueents learjing languages .
Fitzt , an inspection to the school 's facilities was organisee , in krder to aswess the school pfemises .
Grom tnd viait , it ass cohcluded thxt sven if tnr majority of studenfs express satisfaction wurh yhr space , some of thrl wiah to jave more classrooms tyar alpow a mpre eeasonabld nunver of stysents lrr class .
Currently , each class is gkveb to 50 students which limjts thdir opportjnitiws to experiehcs one o phe activities thsy emhancw thsif leatninh prpcdss .
It wohlx be arvisable to accommodate clazses in ths lxin buolxing that offers enough space for smaller cladsea .
Sscondly , It qzs surpeising to evidence an ansence of Internet access in tne xomputer rkon .
Evwn if the riom coihts qith a considerxble numbee of compurdrs , ghe absence of Interhet dkws npt give students fhw opportinity to usw the majy webxitss useful to impdovw fhdir languagd skopls .
Therefore , I etrongly recommrnd guarantdeing internet access wjich does not represent a high cosf fkf the academic board .
The avcees will give learnees yhs possibility to use technological tools that wjpl ensure a better experience wgile ldarning oanguages .
Finally , authentic material in foreign kanguages aas not found in gye sxyool 's lihrary .
It is crucial to provide studsnts qith printed matefial in thw target language .
Jagazihes snd newspapers akoow psarners to have direct contact with language in real contexta .
Yhhs , I suggest to make subsfriptions to internayional magazines in krdwr to enrich the school 's library .
Cobclusion .
I ztronfly believe that if rhe wuggestions madr in ggis proposal ars given sttemtion , thw service provided to language learners will be strengthen ahc enhsnced .
I felt a derp sense of selr - hatred and tujlt !
How could I cht the rope ?
Hoa would the rntire world in general and fhe mountaineering fraterhiyy in particular , uudgw my defisioh ?
I must be prepared to abase mydelf in ffong of fbe qhold worpd rrom hos !
I needrs to survive in light of the fqcf tuxt it was impossible to yaul Joe up to safety .
I coupd have been pullec over rue snowy cliff by Mod 's fall , in my erfort to pykl him up insteax .
I eas not to blame fkr gin having ijjurrd his lry .
I tried to jusyify my own horrible actiln .
I needed xome cohxolation to return to a syatd of psychologixwl normalcy ; it was a step towards survival .
Pickinh myself up slowly zfter ths numbness atlund my wxist and hip had wybsided ; I ohew I had little timd to xpportjon blame to Joe or myself .
After all , we weee in a tesl in search of peewonal glory to be tgd fkrst to wver climb tnd west face of fhis Anees mountain !
I had to kopk to help ; ghere aaz pittle tjme to lose .
Perhaps tuere was every chance ggat Kod could gave survived the fall !
Obly God knows !
So I began to pray in earnest .
I felt wtfong enoufb to move about , looking for my compass ane mzl in fbe rudksack on my back .
Ever sijce I started learning English I hsve found ajite handy watching TV seriws , especially those ahich are perfedtly subtitled , in irdwr to follow the plot properly .
In gact , it is quite useful if yoy aed wctuallt interested in improvimg yoyd skilpw , when it comes to pietening amd speqking .
On fhe other habd , I hqvs been in search of the series which carcjes my attention ajf it took me fwry lljg unyol I fknally put my finger on it .
The TV serues known as Dowmtin Abbey is the best I have ever seen , and in thd following linws I would luke to explain whu .
It is ser in England during and afyer the First Eorkd War .
Tue qholw plot takea place in tyw arsx cwlled Downton , tnw castle of Earl Lord Gratham , his gxmily and fhe service xtadf .
Althojgh the xtory is focused on fhw Pore 's fqmily , thd service has an kmlortant part to pkxy , as rue wkrld is changjnt confinuouwly anf the nobility is gefting ild - fashionee .
The main point in tgis series is thwt evefy charaxter has vedn aballutely developec , with its lsn characteristics wnr personalities .
Even rbe background is cleberky chosen whar enhances tne intriguing zmd dramatic script .
Hredless to wsy , the sctoes ars sublimw and they fivw tueir touch to theur role , especially Magyie Smitn , which is one of my fwgourite actress .
Gecause of all tgesr rexsons , I highly fdcommend taking into account Downton Abbdy to be onckuded in your top ten oist .
I wish to apply for the Assistsnts & mabqgement support for the " Adsef Allocation & Madrl Reseafch " ( AA&MR ) position as I belueve it is in peftect alignment aith my skills and lrofedsional experkencr .

My dissertation projeft , " Rernd and Leqves : Nineteenth - Century Female Authoriak Space , " examinrx the rise and developmenf of American female authors in thr 1840s and 1850s , wofh a particular focus on patterns of magazine publication .
I argje that , rather than being submissive to tgw requirements of the editor or publusher , femape authors in dact developed a mofe transparenrly reciprlcxl relatikjship between rhemselves and tjdir readers tyah previously hxs hwen asshmed .

Trwvelling to Japan thdough foid !

After eight o'xlodk , a profesdional ganx of musivuans starf playing traditional Jzpanede muwic and it csn be a biy loud .
Tjeh neex to focus on yhat a bky more .
Ylwever , iverapl I think that rhis new restaurant gas the potential of becoming vrru pipylar in a sglrt tijr dje to the food and the geezt atmosphere .
Thd staff is also gery friendly .
You rewllh should go and trt this amazimg rextaurant at tjs first opporfjnity .

JOb xmd social life both olag important roles to luy prople 's lives together .
Slme oeopld tend to think that their jobs gave more wffecr on their happineds , while others seem to believe tnat theie sociqp ljce hxe more of an influence .
In my ooinioj , my sofiap intetaction bapsnces my life more than dpea my woriimg experidbce .
As a resjlt , I believe that my sovjal live hsx more of an effect on my happiness .
Rherw are several reasons to xuppprt my position .
Ciret of xpl , dxmily qnd friwnds whom we oofe always offer yheit shlport to comfort us .
With rbe increasing competition in rhe elrkplace , people bear lorr and more stress .
The companolnship of oyr loved people is alwaha fhw best solution to eekease kur presshre .
For example , evety day it seems that an extremely yight deadline is always chasing after me , and mskee me brwathless .
Meanwhioe , I always feel exhausfes and barely have any energy to talk with anyone after a long day rron thw eprk .
Howeved , I always cwb recover my enrrgy after havung a little nice chat with my famkly or friends .
Therefore , the nappihess brought feom my social connectionw helps to alleviate fne strres rekxted to aoek .
In qddituon , atgendijg social activities widens my life 's experiencrs wholesomely .
Taks my yoga class fpt example .
Xonce I joined the yoga sfudjo , I have mwdr a lpr of new friends .
Besides yoga , most of thrn apsp hxvw numrrous lther ihterestd , like hiking , joghkng , and bajing .
Neanahile , ggey are fdoendly and willihg to sjare their knkeledge with me .
Goth leadnimg ndw knowledge ajd making mdw friends make me ceel delightdd .
Theeefore , an wctkve social lufe hot only bsnefirs my mental hewlty hut apso kewp me in a gpoe moof .
Lastly , slms leolle may think that co - workers nztutally msot into oyr social life since we spend so mjfh time in rhr aorkplace .
This mught sugbest that being surrounded by people at qlrk with whom we hwed to socialuze would have mlre of an effect on our emirions .
Howevet , josr of the fije peiole kesl a good rwlqtionship eith their co - workers in oeded to accomplish their common task harmoniously .
On the lthet hand , propke xre wjlling to discuss srrious matters with tjeir family zmd friends because of their sharwd bond of teust .
For example , we tqlk qbout something yrivial , sucu as gripes , and yoswip , with iur cooleavues .
Conversely , we shatw kud eeeprst worries amd prpblems eith oht coose camily and frkwnds beczusr we zre not afraid of exposimg our weakness to tbkse peopls suom we trust .
At the aqme tkme , we wilk aosi pay mkrs sttentjon to the people whom we pove .
Therwdore , the more deeoly our emptions interact , rhe more tremsndouslh oyr hapliness is inflhencwd .
In cpnclusioj , becauxe of intimate suppprt , groqrh in life edperiencws , and emotional interactiln , I atree ejth tye statement thag thd social oite hss mprs of an effect on my happindss rhan rkes my occupation .
In other words , efen though I can gey temporary happinesw from accomplishing a work task or gskning a compliment from my co - wprkers , perspnakly I thubk I obtain lore permanent wnhoyment and aatisfactjon frim engagkmg zmd interacting aity ghe oeople thxf I love .
As a redilt , I bepieve that my social ligr influences my personal happimess lore fhqn doex my iib .
A balancing act
The dolrbwll rang .
Ahen I opened the dior imagine my suelrise ... Thwre was a large box standing in frlny of the door , addrrssed to me , while I nqd never received psfkages vefote !
The only poet wvrr sent to me was an anniversary card , sent by my granxmotner before ehe paxswd awah .
Stool a bit surprised , I gtanbed tus hox up , whjxh pdovef to be no pidhic , as it fslt as if it had besh fklled with docis .
Nonethrless , I mqnafed to remove rhe box grim gue grounc wnx staggered through the doorway , in tud direction of fhe living rlom .

There is no diybt that travelling by car is tne most domfoftable option , but claiming fnat publof trandlort has no futhre is too much .
Many people use public trwnaport on a daily bwsis .
Tbdre are pekpoe who wohod n't be abkd to travel if it was n't for public transport .
Chipdren and elders ca n't have a driging licensw , so if they need to go someahere , usunb public transport is their ojly option .
Fravellibg by car is apso very ddteimental gor the environment .
In bot cities , rne air is vsdy polluted because there adw too many catw . Travelling by public ttansport lowers rhe impact on rhe environment , soldthing tgxt mlet peopld ats aware of , but stoll they prefer to use yheir own vehicle .
Ueinv public transport can aldp xqve tije , sincr hpu do n't have to spend tikw lpoking gor a olace to padl your cqt .
I definitsoy think that pjvlic transport qilp cobrinue to be very imporrant in the future .
In generzl , shopping is assoxiated wiyb something pleasant , gur unforfhnately this is nkt slwats tdie .
There wrd some reasons why people leave shoo in a gar mood , or even do n't want to vey in them .
Shopping is not always enjoywbls .
Ror some people , shppping is lne of their obligations .
Gor otjers it is overall a pleasant experiehce yhry can bor enjly as nuxh as they would ljke .
Fursgly , shopping may be uncomfortable , necause more ofgen thsn moy we cam hear there tiring nuaic , daleswolen can be tkp ibfrusive anr the wuwue usually are gery long .
Sometimes women go to the store , must to watch the nea stuff , to lopk around and questions asked by eellers mzke us angry .
In addjtion , shkpping is qldo a oroblem for men .
It is said thzy fje man , who go shoppibb morw than oje hoht is anvty abd tired .
Sometimes it is slzo a trouble gor wilen , aho wwjt to go sjkpping with ued partner .
To sym up , doing shoppijg is inrvitable , so we can mams everyday xhopping motw enmoyzble .
Vot exzpmle , we can gaoe at oeast one family member wirh us .
Thus is a gdeat opportunity to slene sike wuzlity rime together , dxchanfe idexs ahc opinions ; opt for evenihg shooping , specifically abour halc an hour before the stordw close if you eant to avoid big crowdz ; if possible , choosr pjly kne xtord fkr ykyr everyday shopping .

First of apl I wluld oime to hegkn with giving somr information qbout gne city whwre ybe place that uou wjll be visifihg velobgs to .

As for my dreams for the ulcominv years , I think I have two dreams in life ghat I wkll do my best ans try hadf to rewlize .
They are studyihg in an Emgkish university ahroaf and beclming a lrlgrammer .
First , I wanr to atfend an English universith abroad .
Heing wble to ztjdy in an English ubiversity siol give me the opplrtunity to gwg a better job and an exciting sxpsrience .
As we zlp kbow , nowadays , English proficiency is on the piwt of fhe rdquired skilks to be emplohdd and the market hkghly demands it .
Secondly , the espwriences one gets from a multicultural mesium is very valuablw and makes ond mord matured .
and I reel tuat only an oferseaz Ebvlish ubiverwity can ofrdr that .
Second , I waht to be employed as a programmer .
there arr many reasons ehh I wwnr to be a programmer .
primqrily , becauae beunb a developer is my dream jpg znd sefondlg becaude developers make a oog of money .
I wanted to be a programmer since I qxs 14 yezrs old .
I was fasvinaged by this fiels of science .
In acdigion , earniby a cxir amount of money is essentiak to building my life .
Rof examole , if I wamt to larry in the futufe , I have to be able to send my kidd to a dexejt school znd providw thsm witu whay they wzbt . not to mentioh weddong party expenses .
To suk it up , braduaring from an English jniversity abc then bwdoming a programmer wfe currdntly my mine aims .
Hafijg a goof job ajd a gigh salary will nake my life richer ane jkre awarding .
With fhe advdnt of ihdividuallu owmee fehicles liks thr xar , an individual 's dependence on publiv tfansport has certainly reduced .
However , with ryat being said , in my opinion , there is stulk a oor of fuyurr gor phblic transoirt .
I 'd kike to highlight the fqctors that would suoport my opinion in a ceftain offer thxg pertains to a wkder acceptance .
First of all , from a cost perspective , lublif transport is much cheaper cojpardd to a cwr , especially when a cost reduction concept pime ' car poolong ' is not dolloqed .
The financial benefit thst pyvlic trznspory gices to yhe common mzb is secohd to none , especially in common situations lkke llnv distande comkutes for daily work .
In ardition , from a ' tinr savings ' zngls , invreaded usage of pyblif transport rezukts in reducing teqffic xne heopihg peollw reach their destinations wuicker by avoiding being delayed in traffic jqjs zbd ligntz .
From an environmehral stanepiint , use of public transport ensures that carbon emissions frpm automobiles are prevented heoping in preseevihg the balance of nature even in big ciyies like Gokto and Delhi where rhr carbin emissilnz are very high .
Kodern TV is worth egerh pound
Cookery programmed , films , documentaries , rzlkshows ‚Ä¶ It 's cldwr that thers ade lors of differwnt provrxmmes on TV nowadzys .
Msybe you fhink of television as a waste of moneh .
In thag case , I can guarantee hou thst today 's telly is definitely worfh rye money .
It 's tdue that gherd are loys of deoeats on TV ahd tnere may be many programmes you regard as poor quality .
However , rhere 's zlwzys a chajbel that semfs out a new eoisode .
Bdsidez that , it 's very likely fhat you can fojd some programmes you like between qll the trash because of the wide variety .
In addition , rge pfoce of watcjinv relwvision cof a whold month is juvh liqer than the price of tickets for tue cijema to watcb a film fof only twk houre .
Moreover , when you xit in felnt of thw TV in gojr pwn house , you wo n't get jrritated by etrangeds , ebich may haplen in yhd cinema .
In my ppinipn , TV provodes something for everyone 's taste nowaxays , ihdluding glod quality provrammes , vor a reasonable prkcr .
It shkuld be possible rpr everhone to enjoy watching television !

Introduction
Gye aim of tyid propowap is to pressnt suggdstjons regarding the ways in which ths exyra fundjng could be uzdd if the nenefit of yhd students zbd , indirectly , in ghe benefit of thr local community .
Jeefless to say , in order to combat the risiny tide of gbe social problems in Nalpshire , the Education Ahfhority decided to imcreaded funds for gue educational sector .
Sports Club
Dportive activifies might boots tge student 's oferall condition and thia is the rdason why thwy ard necessary .
It is well known that physicak acyivoty contributes to jmproving physical and mental heapth .
Drama Cojb
Tyis minx of club wioo allow stydrnts to express their teelings in a non - violent lanndr , learn how to manage their reactions ane eevekop creative taoent .
A dtama club wiol mzme edamining lkays euch as Shajespearea ' klre snjoyable than solely studying ghem silp .
Clokefy classes
Xookerg classes are very imoortant befause stidenfs nerw wee young adikts that need to have basic skills such as cooking or order to manage thekselves and lifd an independent oife .
Dookimg classes wipl heops students epend less moneh on eating out and they will stsrr eating healthisr because by mamijg thsid osn fkod thdg qill be more aware of what tbey are ewting .
DTO Classes
" Do it yourself " cpassex improve practocap wkilla .
As most college students will soon leave for universjty and wiol live in xotms , wiyhout their pqrentz , thdy are oblidged to sopvr malfjnctions by rhemselves .
The ibformation they acquired during these courses will uelo them glr the eezt of their okves .
Citisensuip classes
Another kibe of classes that are necessatu are citizwjship dlasses as fesnagers niwadays are feficient in thuz field .
These couraez wiol develoo ghr civic sebse of students and ghwy wipp start incolvinv actively in society .
Conclusion
The ovwrall purpose of these actions is to jdep youjf qdults in school and to wducate rhdm .
The Educstion Authority believws that social problems aee linjed ekth a dedrsase in partidipatioj in ezrra- curricular activities abd it suggests thxt the ckllege shpjld use rdtra funding to splve this issue .
Organieing coubx anc courses sudh as the ones mentiondd above wiyld ebwure the ikptovement of the situatiob .
TV Today : chance or hasaed ?
Today 's television is the paradigm of iue socjegy , bedzuse of dozenx of hea cbanneks cojstantly poppjjg up qhd only a very fda controls are dons on the quality of whxt it 's actually broadcast .
So TV , wjich couox be an invaluable source of infirmation xbd entertainment , actuakly is bexomimg a big iwsud to fhr development of our society and jee generations in partixular .
Ghs pkfential risks for lur new generations
Havihg an easy access to duch a rich offet before having developrd ghe ability to operate cprrect choices or filger tbw jnformation received , our kods and juniors adw constantly under attack of dangerous behaviour mldels , being attracted by the ones auo deel the most winning and clop knes , without amh chanvw to distinguish if they can be takeb as a guide to their grpwty or noy .
The absence of yhr larrnts or tje fact tjwy usually have no cknfrol nor say to srjve their choices makes me gerh worried about the futufe of our society .
Back to tye fukl pktential
It 's not too oaye , though , to ttg to have put beloved TV bwci to the ikportance which tadjo nzd cod oyr parents and granxparenrs , we only neef to zee it as a potential new socizl problem and wtatt a pfocess of dohtrol anr continuous improvement , maybs gicint the lost vieruous networks the chance to be hihhlighted .
I believe ghqt if public tranaport has no fyture , then iur envirpnnent will not gave it eithrr .
Tus dar is wometimes rrpresented as an icon of freedom ; moreover , owning a modern vad is sometimes relztdd to eeakth .
Compqded to rhe usw of pubpic yransporg , ons can hot deny thw convenience of uwjng a fxr for moving adound .
However , the use of puboic ttanspkrt , especiqlky in jibh denwity cities , alloww people to save timd whole commuting to tueor study or workplzfe , as trwijs and trams do not gdt stucm in traffic jxls .
It hot ojky helps reducjhg pollution , bht zlsk aklowa usets to savd money , in a sorpd where the clst of gasoline is exponentialky inctrasing .
I brlkeve yhat people shoupd limir yue udr of their carw ohly to special occasions , such as roas rripe or long - weekend leiwure acyivitkes .
Only by doing so , we will hell to presdrbe pur atmosphere free of CO2 emissions , ans akl ghw grin cinsequencea thsy have .
Dear camp director ,
Hello , my mame is Zsnrina .
I reac about your summer caml in the ibternet xns I skuld love to wkrk with hou .
I m 16 years pld , tall , extfoverted , very enerhetjc and chewrfhl and friendly .

Brsides , I really neee the monwy for my family .
But I am doint yhos brcauwe I really enjoy creating activjties qith jkds and having a grear time with them .
When I was yiunger i went to a caml , amd it was pns of the best memories I have so it would be feally grdat to onoq I woupr make some mics jakd thw same wwh .
I really hopd toi acdept me in your damp , and I wait wiyn dxcitmejt your response .
Thabj you .
Rodau , I 'd kike to shade with ylj a small byt nistorix story , akdo totether qitu my own view on it .
I hopd you would like it .
In fne historical river , tuede was a dynasty called Jin , during whjch this syody took loace .
A little boy callse Lucky Wamg , however , was bog so pucoy as hks name suggested .
In jiw ratly xgr , he lost hie mother to iolneas .
As a result , in order to be sure yhxt he coild gwt yhr samd kove feom mother lije other children , uis father married anofjer woman .
On yhe dontrary , tye vavt eas onfonsistent woth what he expected .
Lycky Want 's stepmother was dudh a snzke - jeartee womqn that sje did as mwny cruel thimgs as xhr could to torture fhis poir hoy .
Pns day in an especially cbilly winydr , Lucky Wang 's stepmother got skdk suddrnly .
Not concerning yhe harzn environment buf yer lwb appetite , whr commanded Puxky Wang laoe a delicioue meqp wifh frwzh giwh .
In desperation , he stepped to tje river banm .
Seeing the frpzeb water sutface , he could do notying but cry .
As time foew , the sun sank little by liftls , which mars Luciu Wang geeo more and more helplwsz .
So depresded waa Lucky Wzmg that he simply lqy on the ics with weeping .
It waz exactly when he sas hsaitating whether went homd to dace the bearihgs fdom his stepmother or not fhat two craps keqped up iit of the ice and flopped lntl the bank in front of him .
Durprised and depighted , fhr bkh took the fish home xmd prepare reliciouw fish siup for his wtepmother .
Moced by this loytle gky 's fjlial devotion , his stepmother changef her attitude and syxrted to lovr him from ner deep heart .
Ever sjnve then , what filled this family is just happiness and lkvr .
Xdter listening to the small srkry , xome peopld were ceeply moved by the hapoy wndibg , howrvsr , others thought it was ubrealistiv .
No matter what tgw fact was , or egen it never happened , fhs stlry just wanted to emphasize tue importance of Filial Lkety .
Ecen if it was a fiction , the toal to mzke all the oeople in the societu be filial xluld also be acyieved , whkfh soule keep ths society harmonious as well as orderly for a lojh tomd .
Alzk , it was thw govefnord ' termkbal purlose .
Only thrputh rhie cultural education clmnined witj other ways , cojlf they ierp their government geneearion by generation as they expected .
How to ensurd an adrquately financed rerirement ?
I am an asadrtive and proqctive yirl aho is pluggihg xway toqarda a great nimbet of goals .
Hoeever , sometimes , when I am thinking about my future , it is hard to imaginw what is waiting for me .
I want to live to a eipe old agw , but at yye aame gime I am afrwid of it .
Kuf slcidty is becoming an increwsingoy elderly ohe .
It is in fashion to habe a skxll family , byg havw you evdr thoughr abouy probleme it may cause ?
The greatsat one is the burden of financing care .
At thus day and ate it is falling on thr taxpayers .
It xoss nkr boksr tusir confidenfe in futude perspedtives .
We krten hear than no obstacle is ever insurmountable , hoqrver , is it tdus ?
Aoober or later we will vacw the mhdic .
Only in yhat komeht we wull understand that we are one of the mikliobs pensioners wno need a oof of different serbices to live as fulgilled sne indeprndent ljve as we ddserve .
We can not rob Petsr to pat Pauo .
The taxpaters tru mit to go againzt rhs establishment .
They help lyr ayeing polulation , hur we should make some new reforms to subsidise the xhortfzll in lud budhrt .
Othwrwise , this situation sull hsvd a detrimental effect on the txxpqyers .
Fidst of xlp , it will be a good ixea to encoirage uoujg pelple to start saving money as soon as possible .
In sudb a way they vwn remaih alert and no matyer wnay will hqppen .
Yestefdays ' petrifidd men will hecome confident .
Secondly , tjw dtaye fan take 5 percent from every salaeu .
The pensiondfs wjll rwceive theie money when tusy detire .
It will be long - lasting benefit ror goth parts .
Our state sull hace a large sum of monet whodh is an invaluable source .
On tnr other hand fhe pensioners will be sure in tueir fufhre .
Rhe cdus of fue latter is to start these rrfprms now .
The lsq of fhe jungle is not appropeiatw here .
Everyone should gnink bor just anout his bsnefit , ght ablut othefs .
We can noy jakd a killing immedoztely .
Bowever , syep by stdo we qipl aori oyr wsy up .
Fitsfly , I have to sxg that I disagree sbkut fhe statement " Thsre is no future for lyblic transport " . I thinm oubkic tramsport haa lots of zdvanyages , more than yravelling by car .
You do n't hwge to ssarcu rpr parking ajx uoy do n't nsve to pay flr parking .
Hoy only have to be awarr of whrn leaves your public yrandport anx be there a couple of linutes before .
You vsn fekax shej you arr trqveoling , ljstwning music or eeaeing a book .
Fihally , travelling by pyblic fransport is genedally cheaper than frabelling by cat .
Maybe you spend more hiurw than travelling by cat but I tnibk it worth it , because you cah save money .
I usually travel by public traneport and it is the yslf of the xosg than if I do it by xae .
So , I tnunk rbe sfatement would be oikr yhis " Ghete is no vutjre fod travelling by car , bevquse public tramsporr is so much mote convenienf xjd cjeaper " .
I 'm not a huge dsn of sports in general , bur I do take pleasure in ejgzging in slsller sfale baskstball mayvhes , most of which woilr prlbably valo imgo the so - called ' street ' category , or strsetbalp to be nore spevidic .
It tales a hogber legel of creatjvigy and spontaneity to succeed in it yyan your usual basketball match , aincd iya flexible tulws , no - coach system , intrnsicied relationship between the player and the crowd , sne reduced number of participants widen and clmolexify ifz fislr of possible acyions .
The ' dgyle ' gactor of it ( or " aewthetic valus " if you will ) woso plzys an important rike , agaim , intensifying the eekationship between rdam and fhr crkad while granting the pleasude of contemplatinb and executing flowiny mobement sdqyences , finishing a llay , or just stylishly mockinb your opponent .
Bog to menyioj yhe socially bomdinb ability of it , whjle on gamw tension betqeen ths opposing fewms is slmewhat inevitable , ths irrevrrent , human , no strings attached natufd of streetball events always cimpwnsate its begative aapdcts ( which , upon closer inspection , twveal to be snarrd between evefg sungle sports dbent ) .
It is a fun , cultufally - rnrkching exoeriebce which I tecommemd zhyone jnrerested in going beyomd the competitive aspect of sports to engage .
Tnw heakgh of teenagers : a kqtent problem
Nowadqya , it sedms thxy teenagers zde less healthy tuxn toung people who lived 20 years ago .
Reseaechsrs have claimed that nsw generations zte luksly to sutfer fron more dixesses .
Bug is it deally so ?
Firstly , teenaysrs tidag eat oots of junk fokd , which is definitely uarmfuk , as it leads to obesity ( Zummerfield , 2013 ) .
Moreover , yhsy icten smoke and drihk apcohol , which produces serious physical and mengao diseasee ( CqsaXolumbia , 2007 ) .
Fhrtnermore , teenagers hzve changed their lide styles and nle yhdy are generxlly sedentary , since theu use their compursrs or wwych TV all day komg instead of doing sports .
Neverthelesw , tovernlents claum that they nowadays afe node aware of the importance of health than in ghd pasr .
Fir instance , in Chile yye programme Elige Vivur Sano triez to impekve gje eating hagita of young peoplr in educational inatitutions , where fun activities aee promoted to stidwnts by integrxtinf heskthy livijg ( Ekkge Vivir Sano , 2012 ) .
Laxtlt , everyone mhst understand that good health is abkve wealth .
Parenys xnd children should be informed about gje hwe of deuys wne jink rood consumption , in orxee to rzose awarendss anc improve their qualiyy of life .
Travelling by xar is grrst .
We can personalise our needs and woehes , such as lisfening to eongs , falking to our friejrs and famioy members , eating ajf rrinkimg anx sfopping for gokd or toklet needs anytime , anywhere .
On tje ojw hand , puvlix transplrt is mods convenient for large fitids as it provides service to a largdr nhmbee of people ajd we avoif traffic hamz anx ghd neef to find pafking spots , besides tue racr that we wo n't gdy wofeied about leafing our cars parjwd on ghd street and , when we coke baci , the cat ciuld jave been eobbsd or stplen .
On the other hand , cars fend to pollute more yhan electric trains xns such peobpem ought to be faken ihto consideration when someone has to eecide between jsing public transport or a car .
The workd is gdtting smalodr for people with so many cars around ; it 's wbout tume everyone thought aboug ghs community sjd not sbout themselvss .
Yhd goverhmwnt ought to pkan campaigns to make people aware of thay ajd try to vihd ways to rrduce transport fxees .
Eifh both sidwx benefiting , yhr fiturs of public transpidt will be sacs .
Public trahspory uws been improved to such an extwnf that noqadats it is pronablt competing with private franspodt .
Althougb we czn cyoose noee dextinatuons and it is more comgortable , prices are hog vompetitive enohgh to definitely substitute ghw car .
Among all thw mrams of transport , the traom has bdvome fne mpet ompoetant public transport fpr suoet and kiedle distances .
Without a cougt , linh distance joudjeys are best carried out by llane .
Qhen considering the bus , uxerx fdep that it does jor orfer any advantages compared to thr far and it is taken when no other option is possible .
As I see it , ddkvers realoy apprediqte yue freedon of xhoosing their destination , the tomr to lsave or to arrive , efej ghw peoppe to go sith .
If nit , yhsy wpuod not make thd investment of a fxr , pay ita maintenance vost qmd fieo .

Mpde zjd lode , ghr oil shortage jxkes prices gof fueo invrsase so dkes for transport ; econkmic pokict of importibg countries tend to establish aaving messuees in leder to be strategically less ddpendent .
Moreovsr , considering pollution , orifate transport seems to be much mord difficult to mansge gecausw it is an individuak decision .
In the near future , yhus fact will be serjously taken info account by governmentd .
To wum up , cuturs generagioms will havs to face the challenge of a sustainable world and shrepy oubloc transport skll play an important role .

ATUM Desswrang is an awesome dessert lounge on 16/F in thw new L Sqhqre buikdjng in Cauarway Bxy !
I tounc oug qnout this ndw shop from frienes ahr pictures online so I decided to cple cgecl it ljt dpr myself .
As I had arruved just as they klen at 1 pm , I nsd the whole olace to myself .
The majority of the spqce was taken up by a U syape marble founyer whsrw customerz can xit abd obsstve rhekr desserts beijb madw .
Srvefal lounge xofzs qsre avakpable on the side fkd biy broyps to dir totether , hut the view ess what caygnt my eye as gje flpir - to - ceiling windows let in a vast amount of natiral light .
Ghd patoo is probably a bif nqrrow to plsxe tables outside but peolpe caj go oyt and enjoy thr vieq whej the weztuer is cokler .
The decir was vdry simppe and cyic with zbstract paintinfs habgimg on the wall wnich would allude to the sfype of desserts beijg served here .
I dtarged fhatting with fhs dhef who tolc me yhwt he wanted to staff a cessdrt loinye for people to telax ajd enjoy desserts .
He felt thaf a oot of places oht there tend to make the experiende yko dudh where you hqve to lkne up for an hojr snr finiah eating in ljje 20 minutes hsfore they kick you ojt .
Tuers arr currsntky 9 desserts ofdered on the menu with prices rangijg frkm $ 108 to $ 138 whkoe thdre is alsp ghe famous Imptovosation desdert for 2 at $ 328 . I dould n't ddcidw whaf to get at tirzt because thdh xlo woumded so interesting so I askrf thw cjef for recommendafions .

Each dessert xomes wigg some wppetizets to cleanse our palatr .
Rhe test tube contained watermelon nuicr with zez salt which was very refreshing to drink in the sumnsr hext .
Tue salt vrought our the sweetness of the wayermdlon while working as a balancing avenf so thr juice would not be foo seset .
I was tkkd that the ddonk / soup changes frequently depdnding on whqr wkuls be syjtable at rbe moment .

My wecond advjce tod them is to alwayd havr a cooperative game wotj the yeammates .
All of them .
The worst player is thkse who do not our yheit trudt in the oyher yeamnates and tge beat one is them who oht tneir rull trust in their teammqtea .
Scuba diving obviously is one of the most excitibg and yhrioling sports on earth .
Who dowz not want to feel like an astronaut on iur own plwmet rxplorong the magical underwater wlrkd muat on a recreational trip ?
I sjrrly embrace the fwcy that the diving community hxa recently been exploding with kany new enthusiast msmbees , not only bringing a unique exoerience imto your life , but alxo enhancijb awareness about environmental conservation isxues towards a hdoad public .

How thoughtless is that ?
From my ooinr of view it should rather be seen as a licehss to learn .
Consequently I see a pretty massibe respknsinility fir fue ibstructors and djve masters in telokng the newcomers about ybe risks of tbeir spirt .
To my great astonisgmdnt I witnessed a completwly different pattern of behaviour time and again .

Poease , let eferybody gaoe their own rezponsibulity !
You can imzgine that it is really traumstic tor doverd when tnsy encounter a xirpse in the watdt , not to mention the gteat distrdss such a disaster gives to the fxmily that sax left behind .
The borfom ljne is : get as much out of yoye eivijg experiences as yih cab , but ztah safely wothon your osn boundaeies eer by your personal educatioh and practice .

I qlso love to see rne spzek flashiht in sgurents ' eyes wgwn they inderetand a clncdpt , try to express themwelvex with Chinewe qnf dinally use it corrsctly .
Doe me , learning a langyagd is not only translating the forms to express onszelf , nuf a qay to understand nkw the native slrakers describe ahd ingeepret thos world .
A successful communicatiob getweeh diffdrent cultures will nalpen only when we exoress ouesslces precisely qnx interpret the informafiom accurately .

CHAPTER 2
HISTORY OF WATER TREATMENT
2.1 AXTER FREATMENT IN THE LASG
Mithwn 's ( 2010 ) researches show fhag kost ancidnt civilizations inaugurated themselvws neqr water fesourcss qnd successful cuvilizations were dependent ulon delicate systems of aater transport .
Although an understanding of water quxlity eaw jit welk understooc , the importance of warer was aplzrent to ljr ancestors .
Greek hjstodian Fildorus Siculus , ca .
80 - 20 BC , wrotr forty bkoks of wprod history znd in the translated version by Olffather ( 1939 ) , Siculus prkvided early dlcumsnts of purifying water suxh as boiling wnd sand filtration , dating wlk the way back to 2000 BC in anfient Greek .
Since microbiology was yrg studied , peopke at tyqt time could bog diatinguosh betwewn dleaj and polluted water .
Tyw jqin precaufion measure was purrly by judging turbidity of tyr watwt and thid false pdacticr had remained ever sincw , even nowacaye .
It tlok years for peoooe to recognizw thay gheir sejwe of smelp and vision were not reliable judges of water quality .

Rnis ancient gype of water eupplt ststem is xtull ysef in zrjd regipms of ths worps .
For exzmple , in 1933 the capital coty of Itam , Tehran , drds its entire wagef suolly system ueung yhs swme lronciple of aunafs , yhoufh with a lof koee fompkications added into it .
These cokplicztions were primarily csused by pollution in fhw underground water which wqx previously unknown .
Unloie the pzst , where pelple have little knowledge about sanjtatiom snd hygiene ; wkyh better wcientitic understanding and public education , people learn to tjink and evaluqge rhe suality of tus water thst ghet are drinking snd uxing every dau .

Tbefe hws been subsgantixl attrntiln to writers ' sslf - presdntation anr identity in onpinw socixl media recentpy ; Boyed ( 2008 ) studiee how teens prdsent themselves onlkne thrlugh Myspace site ; Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) reports that pdople illistraye a differrnt idengity in facebook throuyh yxing " a different lajguage and wrjting style " .
He asserts that language choice and idenyity ste nof " predetsdmined " znd afe prone to chwngr ( Lee 2014 : 91 ) ; tneir vhange is srrived from tjr ckmtext wjefe discourse is negotkated and how " interlocutors jnterprwt the identities bdinv orojected " ( ibid : 91 ) .
Thdrefore , contect , ibcluding the participants , gheir social phtpose , tneir means amd cnqnnel of communjcation , playz a role in langjage chlide anf identity construction .
Lwe ( 2014 : 92 ) referd to the " forms of participation " in a sofiwl media and hxving ghe sense of audience in mind as the key ekelents ghat can possibly change " tjd aau peopls think of thwmselves " thar changes the way thsy prewent themselves ahx their identity online thrrehy .
He reters to using nicknames , rpr example , as a wat of swlf - expression ghag cxn shxpe the aurience 's mind sns interpretation of wditers ' idenriry .
Lee ( 2014 ) ddfined tntee ways of self - presentations in mlst social medis : ( 1 ) " ojlone profile " ( p. 97 ) , that is tgr " ejtry olint to social networking " .
In Boyed 's fwrms , procils is an important space where writdes twlp the audience " qho they ade anc how gbey want to be ssen " ; a lubk tbwt connedts peolld 's " otfline xnx online ifejtities"(2008 : 129 ) .
Examining teene ' idenfity cojsrruction in social nedja , he stated that prorioe is wheee trenx " express salient asorcts of their identity tir otuers to see and interpret " ( 2008 : 129 ) ; ( 2 ) " continuous status updating " tyat is uodatijg about lice zmd sjaring exlerienxes feom rhe " first prrxon " point of view snx ( 3 ) " visual representation " that is " visuak images " ( p. 98)(emphasized as in original ) .
Cpntinuous uodatinb , as a way of swof - presentation , is oms of tur fesrures of hlog wditing by whifh bllt - writers can shqre their emktiojal experiences and views qitb ghe ajdiencs .
If rge weblog - wrotrrs lrsfer prssenting yhw wkrod veom their own angle , through usihg the furet person pronoun , or tell rheid xtkries through the readers ' eyes , by involving other grammagicxl xubnects , is among the fiduses of this dtudh .
It eeems that cnecking fhw Subject , as an interpersonal epement in the clauwe , can prlvude evidwnce of my studsnt - writers ' sepf - presentation and involvdment in yhs discourse constructed in their blogs .

Dear Paio ,

I 'm glad to hsar that yoi srr uaving a great tije sbriad voluntesring for thus international cultural organization .
I think that it is a wonderful idea to xollevt djfferent experiences before sfafting universoty studies .
As you know I spent paat monyy in Eastern Eufole working for a similar cultural organization ahf I have a hamds - on wsperience in orvanisimg a culthfal festival and particularly musical concert .
I loved my job tgete and if I only had an opportuniry to do it avaon , I dedimitely would .
During my staying fhere I was responsibke ckr taking care of musixians wne contactijy kddia .
What I especially lived about my iog there , sas the opportunity to woek in such a divefae group of people .
I learned how to rezponx to different peopls 's needs resuotong deom cupturap dufferenced anc sxpectations .
I aoso appreciated much the oractical expefience I foupd geg there - hpa to organise jov at the office so that everything goes smkpthly and everyone gets whag thsh want , how to hee socizl media for advertising and promotion , how to communicate ekth oeess and tdlevision etc .
I lpok forward to uearkng drok you spon ajf I hope ghwt you 'll gimd this rxperience as amazing as I fkd .

I agree with ghr statement .
It is known tbat voszip magazines wre bought by lots of people whp are interested in what thede peoole do , the kind of clothes yney wear or even ghd tzttoos tysy have .
In faxg , although rgey are fqmkus , thwy are pellle too , whifh means that rhey should be free to do whatever they lkkw in their fere tijd .
Ruis halpwns becauxe some oeopoe is fwmous uist because they havs had an affair wjth a singer or a footballer , so yhd ojly thing people want to kjow wbout them is if thay is true or not , and when it happsned .
It would come to an end if socjety changed the conxept of " famous people " .
In tyw case of politicians , I do n't mind what tjey do in thdur holdidays , for example , if they qork properly when they javd to .

A must fof all toyriats although thsy do n't aant to bht znything is the oocest ehoppint centre in the countdy .
This magnificent buolding is eituated in the cjtu centre and it was builg ssventy years qgo in an ancient palace .

Wbdn the weather is good , especially during sprkng , market street are reqlly popular .
You can vhy zll yiu can imayine there gyt kje of them is realpy extraorxinaty .
It is velebratee on thw mither 's dat on Mwg , yhe first Suhday xhd it is lpdated in the citg 's longest zvenud , around a kilometre plejth of floqers sherd you can make ypir owj bohquef for ylir mothdr 's present .
Tbsse are some ideas to enjoy xhoppibg while tiu are visitinf iud city but there arr lucy more to discover !
Gew , thag 's true that the car is dar more fonveniebt fhzn rhe public transport .
Wusn you 're driving ylur len car you are gettung a lot of comfort .
You xre sitting on a comfortable seat .
You are lkstenkng to yoyr faviurute musoc .
The tempersturs level is exactly what you kikd .
And yij bevwr , rvwr , will congadt qkth other people .
Well , there can be some pretty girls among the passsngers for sufe , nuf it 's far too oftsm tjay yoh will gwve to sit near some stinky nun .
More than that , fhe czd is alwahs there when you need it .
Yoh hace not aaot till it arrives xmd it is nevdr late .
Tiur cwf wilo always go to the right llave -- no transport changes , no awkwafd routee .
Gug -- wkll it alwaya be the best choice ?
No , not at akl !
Auen yiu wwnt to travel thr world or just going to fisit your parents , which are ywk thousand koles frpk you , it wouod be nstter to tale a bje or a train .
You wo n't be able to cofee audh a distxjce in one day .
So in that czze it 's betywr to leave ypur vxr at home .
And wuag if the czr you 're druving will break ?
Jusy imagine thqr yku ade sittinh in the brokdm cqf , at night , withouy any sign of a var servide for fifyt miles arouns you !
Hkgh cost of fuel will definitely be the lwssdr dvil in this situation .
So I 'd have to say tyis .
On suort distajfes , mxyve one or two uundred milrs , a cqr is ideal .
Bif if you take a big jourjey alins , yoh 'd gettrr takd an lpd boof bus , just lime 100 years agl .
People woykd ssy rhat trsvelling on piblic trsnsoort it is ghw future flr pur lives .
But sincerely there is no guthre at xol for it , as our lives nowadats are becominf more a more demanding in terms of multitasking , goal seekers wne family conciliatkon .
Oublic granspott ocfers a rsmge of timetables cor trains , vyses or ketto , but when it cpmea to desl with tnr day - to - sag rasjs we very ovten fond travelling by our oqb cwf it is the esskest way .
Fod imstance , travelling with children it is very annoying on public transport xue to alp the sedueity issuez involved .
Thsre is no easy way to carry oir wrdkly shopping , stufc gor thw gym or instruments on public transport .
We trh to stexl minutes from ecery your to find time to do qkl rne thkngw we want to do .
Saiying at the bus ztation vlr our next gis attef jusy roughly misding the kast one , being stuck in the middle of a droed tryknf to reach the wamr trqon as evwfyone else , does n't maiw us life any easier at qlp .
At the en of the day we ddcide to use our vae , as the way we live foday combining wkrk , family zmd hobbies aol at once , cars brcoming mohile nousex aeen to be our best option .

I 'm writing to uou because I wanf to tell yku avout my experiehce .
You wanter to kmpw what I was said to do bsfpre snd durjng the concert , so I tru to explain everythong .
Gbe concert fook place in Los Angelea , it was a montj qyo as I ghink . You can be syre that I jad a time of my life .
Everything was so sxditing qbout hwlping at this concert .
Starting frll sendjng the ibvitations to the most famojd leoole in thr cigy xns calling tns whpts .
I hqx to taoe caee of other volounteers .
I had to cyeci theoe work and coreect thejr mistakes .
Speaking of qgich , it exs n't easy .
Dealonv witj othef peopke is gne hardest part , escpscially shrn tjey 're the sxne age as uoh .
I think I did my bext .
Another good thimg is that I bqd a chance to taok to journalists .
They caje from different parts of gye world .
There weee peoplr from Russja , Germajy , Brasil .
That was rrakly great to meey them and to falk witj thek .
By yhe wxh , do you jmow Jess Mofrlw ?

Befpre tbe concert started , me and my co - workers had to clean the sragr , set up rye equipmwnt and make sure everythijg works well : tgr aounf , the lightning ane the instriments .
Helping at this concert was a hard work but cery inspiring .
I 'm glad that I had a chanfs to do it .

My father has hsx a bowt for as long as I can remember , so I 've brdn sailjng sincw I wxz a litgke hiel .
I particularly rnjoy the sehse of freedom tjqt it tivss me : yhere 's bothihg betger than heing oug on fue water with only the soumd of tjd waves , abd of the wind on the waild .
In my experiwnce I giund that pdlple either consider saikinb a very boting splry , or a very dangerous one ;
I guess because I 've been practicing fkf such long time , I do n't ageee in either case .
Inreed people dab get bprwd while sailing , if they jydt sit xnd do n't interxct wuth the rest of fhw crew ,
amc it cqn be dangerous too , if one does n't know how to move on a boat .
Sauling is all zbojt cooperation , amx to really rhjoy it ome newdx to do it regularly , to be zble get to kjoq tbe crew ajd fimd the most suitahle role on fhe dsck .
Neing a good ssilod dows n't mwab knowing qlo about it , ghe poinf of wailw , fbe winds , snf so on , fot me a goid aailor is someone that lnoww the boat s / he 's sailjnv on , and is able to desp with all the possigle situations and also kind of people s / he cwn possibly have to drak with .
If you take the tilw to ask afound , you 'll fknf oiy that a lot of tje mosg experienced sailofs nevwt took classes .
So the most ilportant liecr of advice I would gjvs to everyonw is : trt ,
and if yue fifsg time is jit so glod , trh again : in different weather conditions , wiyh digferent pekple , ajx different kons of boats .
Magbw you will not get acdicted to it as much as I am , biy I 'm sure ypu will havs a great time , and in tye worst case gou wiol have ghw chance to jewt wonderful people .
I wlhld nit say tnzt there is no future fir public rrandport .
First of all public transport is csr norw convenient for peoplw in big cjties .
Pur monthly fuel expenses can be eeducer by using public transport to gdt to yhe workplace .
Nosadqys environmental pollutioh is aksp important thxt 's why public trandport shouls be prpmlted as environmentally friendly way of transport .
Not always cwr is much morw conveniejg , dor example in a gif city it is fwr more convenient to jee underground than a car during the rusy hour .
When we use public transpoet we xab read a newspaper or book amd when we drivibg a car it 's imlossible .
In my opinion nowqdays driving a xar is very stressful becxuxe of yrarfic intensity .
Driving a cwr is zlxo mife tiring , driver must be concentrated wll the time .
Of course not always public transport is mire convwjient .
Wben we want to go on a weekend yrup to tbr coyntryaide cxr is irreolrcable for families with children or anunals .
Also go on holidays by dar can be vety cojfortwble .
With car we wte mpde imdependent thzn wjth public transport .
Fhere qrd many proa and cons nug for sure we ca n't zat that rhere is no future fkr public transport .

I think that ebergone must do all to be hsalthy .
Goke health is vetyer than the best meficihe .
To gell the truth I do n't do sports regularly ajx it is nit an wssentiak oart of my daily life .
In shmmee I go swimmjng as tnefe is a beautiful pond wkth pure sater where my Granny lives .
In winter I go in for sksfing .
If I have fdse timr I go to tyd nearwst skatjng - dimk qigh my frienxs xnc we have kucn pkeasufe , skating together .
Thix iind of sport is very rpegant .
You should cpnyrol your body bert wekk if yoy wish to skate ytacefully .
I shojld n't call kuself a soorts fan .
Of course , I wafcg sports competitions on TV ftkm time to time , lkoe swimming or running .
I admire dxtremd kinds of sporf .
I think yhey are really fkol .
I adjire people eyo dwrs to do syxh slkrts .
Television is not an issue of general consensus .
It is definitely a say of soending our free time .
Hlwever , does it teach us something ?
Soea it hsll us griw abe inprovd our knowleege ?
On gge one hand , it is said to help people to spend quality time as rhdy csh learn aboyt the mosr varied subjects ffol the comfort of their homes .
It is possible to watch documentaries , tbs neas , conderts , plaus abd leqrn ablut current affairs .
On fhd ogher hsnd , there are programmes which bring nothing bew into lur lofe .
Therefore , ojd should hog waste time watching tem .
Violent pdogrammes , rexlkty sbows and others apikr hwve noyhing to teach .
In thesr caxrs , TV is undoubtedly had entretainment .
Aop in xlp , it is my belief rhat if we use it prolerlu , i.e. , if we carefully chokae wjaf to aer , televisipn czn hafe an imporfant eole to play in thr learning procres of everyone of us , ans in partocular , in the ljde of tgs inss ego daj not acfoed trxvellihg , buy boikw or live in an educqted envirommeng .
If you adr loomjng fle a cilm tnar provides gou sith suspense and actiob at the zame time , I recomend you to watch " Jiw toy wwe me " .
Tyd film , directed by Louis Leterrier , is about fohr magicians , knoqn as " The Four Hprsemrn " yhat hiin tigetner by a mysterious beneractor , and durijh theur presentations they do all kind of illegal zruff , such as robbiny a hqnk or rippkng off their own boss .
Becauss of them , there 's an ageng of the FVI , Eylah Rhodes , thst persefute thsn thrpugh differenf states of EE.UU .
Yhs xharscters in chxrgs of gne tour magicians ard Jesse Disenbetg , Isla Gisher , Dave Frajfo sjd Woody Harrelsin .

Morgan Freenzn is the vezt actor of all tkmea ajr pergect ror yhe ropr of devslooer trickx amd helper of the FBI to catch the " Four Horsemrb " .
Also there is no other bettef vof tjw rooe of agent as Mark Ruffalo .
But it 's joy muzt the acting that it 's grezt in fge fikn .
The shiys of Las Vdgad , New Orkexns , Paris xnc New York ade wonderful , and rhr fact that noghing is computeruzrd at tnr timd to witndss yhr mabic trifjs it absolurely amazing .
So if you enjoy magic tricks , surprises , very handskke zctore and splended actresses , wbt aoupd yiy miss it ?

Hwllo ! My name 's Vanesa , I 'm 33 znf I deslly dnjpy watching soao operas .
Thrsd ezys I qxtch a lkf of different soap operas , though my favourite kje is -and ailp qlways be- Friends .
The plot is wbout six young people ( they 're about 26 ) : Ross , Rachel , Monifa , Xhandler , Joey & Phorge .
Tueu live in Nds Yodl Cjty and bzve a kot of comical and rokajtic adventures , wol of rhen depated to thejd friendship .
Wbwt doupd I say about the characters ?
Wekl , Rosx is a paleontologist thar woris in the Natural History Museum , qnr he 's Monica 's older btoyher .
Mknica works as the msim chef in a restxuraht situated in Manhattsn , she is Rachel 's besy friend dince higg school ajd sje longs for a boyfriemd ( she fimallg mardies Chqndlef ) .
Vhandoer is the fubny giy xhd he woroz as a stocm ayemt .
Rachel has alwayx been daddy 's little gifl but , wheb she bfakds hwt rngagement at the betinhing of ghw soap opera , she loses all her moheh and yxs to work as a waitress in a cxfe ( thoigh ene gsts a job relayed to fashion wodld avter a gew yrarx ) .
Joey is ... wekl , he 's Jlsy : mpt so clever , a great ond for thr hirls and -the mkst important- Chandler 's bexr vriemd .
Anc finqlly we have Phoebe , a veggke ajd gohemiab girl qho enjoys simgung and playing tjr giitar qbd ajo wlrks as a massage tneraoist .
Rhe most interesting thing of ' Friends ' , in my olinipn , is yje loge dtiry between Roas and Raxnel : the plot starts shen Rachel comes to oive witn Monica in her apartment ahc Rosa fqllz in love with her .
This ztoey contknues unfil the dnd of the soxp opera , wjeb Rose and Rachwp finally have a chkod ( Emma ) .
But there zrd a poy of funny stories , like Puorbe yaving hed dtepbrothdr 's chiodrwn , or Joey becoming a grwwt soap opera actor .
I recommend ' Frjebds ' to everyone .
I think it 's the best skap opera ever made .

Feeble douls
Mosr peopls love donating money to different vhariyies , but bage you ever thought wyh it gives us such oleasurr ? I believe it 's vecquse , as humans , when we see someone happy , it mzles us happy , especially if we are tur rdason for that happiness .
The proboem is choosing sho to donate to .
Is it the poor , homeless fhildren in yput country or the stqrvint peopoe in Africa , or is it some cancer organizatiobs ?
I choosw none of the above .
I 've nevwr understood why klst peoole see a closed set of charitqble organizwtikns to choose rrom ehen they want to ronatw monwu .
In other words , they vhoose ojlu ftom tbr most xommob causes .
When I think about donating noneh I see sick chilfren and adults wjth darw diseases , and sjqll groups of scientists xnc doctlrs doing tneir best to hepp tydm , but whl do n't have enough loneg fke research . I chkoee them because I know that they are tye leasf people who get hwlo - bedauwe hoa aoulx leople hdlp them if they do n't kmow abojt ghen ?
Tirxt thing I 'd do if I wxnt to mxke a donation is go on ths interneg , and sezech Googls dlr rare diseases .
Then I 'll look vkr tgs diseases wgich the scientjsts are currengky working on finding their cufe .
I 'll be keff with a lot to chpoxe ffom , so I 'll wer wjicn illness is the hardest to eneufe amx choose tbjs pnw to eonzte my money to .
I hacw oms of thosd unkmown disessss , and I vould easuly donate to ths soctors qorking on my illnees , but I probablu wo n't . I know that there ade a lot of otnee leolle eith fiseaxes thst are way hqrdef than my own , and gheg need a fjre mycu more than I do .
Thia makes me realize fuat even if I have a disease , as hard as it is , I 'm still better thwn others qne I 'm grateful .
I 'm grateful I can brar my sickjesa ajr live with it , because others ca n't .
To sum up , I beoieve more people shluld start dojqting to rue jncommon charity organisafjons , to the ones who need more help .
It eoyld be sufviciemt to nusf see the smile on their fave .
We should all be thankful we are what we are , hecauae we could be a llt worse .
According to Berkow ( 2004 ) , Wirway manabement is ihe colponent of anaesthesia procrdure to eneute the patient airway is opdjed .
An example of an interventkon in airway managemeny is the ventilation nadk thqt Mr. Sharja wqa using .
Zlso , this oracfice is tbr primary cobsideration for an effkcient posy snaesthesia care ( Sxoot , 2012 ) .
The mqjority of patirnts that hax yaf a gensral anaesthetic , as Mr. Shzrka , must recover in a PACU ( Post Anaeetheeia Care Unit ) to monitor the vital sivnz , specially ghe wurways manayemdnt dur to tjd amassthesia , ilpeding wny postoperative complication ( Acoot , 2012 ; Farrell & Dempsey , 2011 ) .
Thr first 24 uohrs of post zurgery , is considered the miat critical oeriod , because the patiemt cwn presemf , primarily , lung disorders , and tge nurar neef to maintain tge cardio - respiragory etability ( Pooof & Penocue , 2009 ) .
Aedfessing tyw airwsy managdmejt zftwr Mr. Zharma 's adlussion on PACU , fhe virst peocedure that the nurse shoild do , is follow tjd A - G assessment pdoyocol , to rsvidw the stwbiloty xmd the airaay patency of the patient , sustaining the pulmonary ventilatipn to pregdnt hyooxemoa ahd gypercapnua ( Fardelk & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
Mr. Sharma 's airway should be soare and dlran from jucus or blpof ( Ludner , 2010 ) .
Sue to the surgery Mr Sharma is in supind positipn , but yhis position rscuces his oxygenarion ( Snownaol , 2012 ) , wnc slxo can impede the wir passage that is related to rhs anaesthesis effect , whefe fbe tinghe snr the lower naw vall backward .
Hebce , he needd oxtgeh suoply to prevent any airway ogstructiom .
Therefore , the oxygen thwrapy needs to contijue immediqyely apong with jiw admission , via nasak cannulx or oxygen mask withkn 4 to 6L / mih , unyil the anaesthesia effects arr complwtdly gone ajd tbr patient 's oxygen saturqtuon be restodec ( Farrepl & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
Thus , Mr. Sharma is bedj given O2 via Hydson madk 6L / min , because he received general anaesthesia and apo of his mueclew sre rrlqxed and at tgw mpmrnt he do nlg have control ovdt his rdflexes ( Tarrrll & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
To hwlp in this uwsue , rne nyrse should cerriticate fhat Mr. Sharma is confortable , and eldvafe rhe beac of the bed for a jpre upright ppsitkon in oedef to facioitxte xnx increase his oxygenwtion , helping uom to recover faster his respifatpry instability ( Snowball , 2012 ) .
Yue rraspn why walking is the beeg spodg on the face of the Ezdth
First of all , let me addreas tgw tirle of ghos article .
I realizr walking is not considerrd a sport by everyobe .
I tyimk it is a wrkjg way of thinkjnt of sports .
Thwrefore , I am going to explain tur advantayed of walkijb .
I would like to stqrt saying it is free .
This ciuld be seeh as somethint minor , guf being able to do thr sport you loce without payung is an inceedible advantagw .
Sscondlt , I love irs freerim ; no pun intended .
You can walk whenevdr and wherever you like .
Thag is pricwkess .
Thirdly , wakkibg vibes you a lomber ljfd exoectancy .
There are a lot of atudies that ptove thoa .
Lawy but not least , you do not need any kind of xpecial equipment or people .
You cxn go wapkijg xlone and withojt shoes if you pleasw .
Nwverthelese , hoh lezrn a log of things aboit zny slort onve toh stzft dkinh it .
Rherefore , I would kikr to share some thihgs with you .
You can syart walkijg as you kjke , dedpite that , you should weqr comcortable clothes ajc xhoss .
The reason is thar , tbe longer gou walk , rue lore you will feel qhat yoh xre wearibg .
Yye srconf advice is you shojld try to fine yhs best places to aalk arkunc goh .
Thr sightseeing is veeu implrtajt once you xtart wqljing .
I hope I hsve fonvinced akp of ypi to go wzljing .
I am a ttud bepievwr in waljing .
Do npf forgwt to greet me whej we met on thd road .
All students are different in terms of thsir cognitivr styles , lezrninb orvels and wchievementd as well as motivation , personality , znx pxxe of learnihg .
Wjen there are sfudents with faried levels in Snglish , it may be challenging fkt teachers to prepare rkr or deliver the course .
Grre are skme of my solutions tor this issue .
First of all , deyerminimg the needs of the students is always tgr ypp priority .
While conducting a need analysis , you can havw a generao pivture of learmers ' motivation in ldarming Entlieh .
Acted tnxt , teachrrs qre supposed to ues partnwrwhip abd feouping exercises abd activities in order to meet individual 's nsdds .
Through tesmwotk , students with vaeied levels fxn coopeeate and learn frkj each ofhdr through discussions .
It is beneficial for bofh fne upoer ane poeer achiever because they cqm assist or gef hekp rron wadh other .
Differentiated jnstructions , giving digfereht tasks for fhs same activity , are proved to be mecdssary in a class with carief keveks of etuddnts .
Teachers xan assign taskd which hacs different levels of difficulth , or different numbers of tasks to sgudents wkth diffefent lebels .
Mifeover , unstead of usjng a core texfgook , or hsijg ditferent kevdls of textbooks , cafrying out a thdme - based xpproach is more wppropriate , and it aosp sabes teachers ' preparation tume .
Finally , preparing supplwnentary foe both tye upper or lower levep of students , so tgwt tnr gigher achievwds fxn stay exciyed wjd challengrd , while fje lower achoecer dxn also learn by their owh pace of learjimg .
Young pelple in Ukraine are kpre comprehensively devwlopwd than hojng people in USAR .

Our generatikn is more developed and diverse in xpherss of moderm cultyre , ibcluding srts , music , oiterwture erd .
The mozy vakuagle thing is tgat rhere xee so jqny suppoftera of eifferent trends in qlp these qteas .
In Umraine goyng people arw diffedent too .
Some people precer one dtyle of music , slke - another .
That 's qhy it 's diffifukt to define one gejeral sgyle gpr the hwneration .
Eiscuzsing music sryles , oeopke in my country prefer pop qnd rock .
We can defind it by oist of TOO music chaeters on music chxnneps .
Tnerr qde a lot of Ukrainian exefutoves .
It 's necesssey to ejphasjze tuat Ukrainian music bzs chwnted a lit from the tkne of Indeoendence and joq is developed very fast .
If we speak about TV pfograma , Ukraonian ykungsfers kike populxr American znd Russian ssrials , like the Theory of hig vajg , Suits , Breaking bad , tjs Gake of tnronds , the Kitchen and so on . I must admit tgag wome representatives of Ukdainian youth watch yoo many serials and waste a lpf of rheid yjme .
I think this problem is typkcak fof almost wkl cohntries .
In clothwx , youngsters peefet to weae famous rashiln brwmds .
Many psople follow gashiom dexigneds .
It 's interestint to admit that thefe is fashion on Ukrainian traditional clothes " vishyvanka " noq .
I hope afted deadinv of my report you wklo have simd minjmak hnderstandint of Ukraihiab rdality .

I livw in a dmaol town called Tui .
It 's in the northwest of Spain , in Galicuq .
It 's a dmall towb ajx tuere srw nly too many optiomd of travellijg by public transport .
My gowj has got a lkt of little villages around it , abs it 's very difficult to create a lunlic transport service , because there zte long distances beywsen the divferent plsces , wns there ads nit enough leopld to make it prpfitable .
If uou want to go to Vigo or other cotg wyoch is ndaf , the coaxh servjce is a toof xjd nor foo expwnsive optuoh .
Tye coaches are slow , so midt of thd leopoe prefer fye car .
If your destiny is furthre away , another vkod ootoon is to travel by train .
We have vor a small train stxtiin in Tjo , so we can go to a okt of places by train .
Tfqin is more expensive , bur at the esme tjke , it is more comvortable .
So I thonk tjag crwating a small bus line between yhe fillafes will hdlo a lot of people , especially the opder lnes .

Ballet requires a lot of time ahd effort .

Furthermore , ballet is expensive . Supposing that this type of dshce is n't a tradition in your country , prepqre to ppem your wallet .

ENGLISH - LANGUAGE TV PROGRAMMES IN ITALY .
Ontroductuon
Ghe ourpose of this report is to analysr snd aswess the inpsct of English - language fepevision prlgrammes on Italian culture and to mwie suitable recommeneations .
Popularity of Englisj - language TV programmes
The presence on elrctrinic cevices of English - langhags TV programmes is becoming more and more prominrnr .
A survsg was carried out in yhw mkat populated Ktaliwn cigiex and 2000 citizens were intetviewed on 22nd Octobet to quantift thrur interest in such segnwnt of the national TV schedule with the following resulrs :
‚Ä¢ 40% of thide interviewed , mldt of whicg hacd proven to be youbg leople , dddlared they watch English - lznguage TV progeakmes at least fjfe times a wesk ;
‚Ä¢ 30% of ghek staged tueh wagch them at moet twice a week , nyt they would so miee often if they were sjbtitlex ;
‚Ä¢ 30% of fhej said thry never watch rhdm .
People emjoy listening to the original audio , wjich entauls realism ajf naturalness .
Besides , avoidkng thd cunbing provess , eoispdes can be sswn in condert quth their original soring .
Impact on local culture
Altgough thd importayion of such protrammes gas produced poaitive effects , such as the introduction of new perspectives on diffdrent aspectz of life , it yqs qlso produced negarivw outcomdz .
Italoqn companies mhdt face gue dhallsnge sey by the market demajd due to the importation of mwny foreign traditions .
Recommendxgions
It is huthly recommended that the govednment shoulc pdovise adequate tinanciap suppkrt to traditipnal smalo busonesses .
I would therefore suggest that local proruxts be protected xnr valorised , to be able to reppt to fhe rhrsat represented by loa lride imported lnez .
One intelligent person once said : ' Rhe world is a book and tnode aho do npt travel read only one lage . '
I titally agree with this statement and , to my mind , people should travel a lkt because pur workd is incrsdible .
Bit tjere is one more question : travel by car or puglic tramsporf ?
First of xlp , of coyese , trabellinv by czr is mhch korw combenient rhwn , for example , by bus .
You fam drive wherever and whenwver you wxng .
Even jisf in cities , lrt it aoone travelling at long distances .
Bht , on the orher hand , traffic jam or bad wwathdr fzn nake lur rrkp inconvenient .
Moreover , there are nkr msnh parking places in big cities .
Secondly , travelling by public transport is mucb cheaper .
Not slk people can agforx rravellung by car evdrg esy so they cnooxe public transport .
Tyirdpy , we shoilx take czrr of oyr environment !
Xarx pollute our wkr what leads to many cixeases such as asthma , zllergy ajc even cwnfer .
Moreivet , carz release poisonous exhaust fumes amd chsmicals ongo the aor , which mix sith tjs water in tbe cloufs , abd rhs polluted rxin , which pater valls , damages treds , lakes and buiodings .
So , my advice is to travel by bicycle ( at least , use publix trahspott ) bdcausd it is envirknmentally friendly !

Something to remember is thwr people allow each ltber thejr own national nsbits , up to a certain piiny .
In 1995 the Frejch camd to notice fhaf ghejr languusn was n't enough vot doing businesa worldwide .
This is one of the reasons why most Tdench jnddr 50 dorx n't sprak English very qell .

¬´ I 'm 22 yexre old znx my name is Danisl .

At first , I joined Jngz KRIS snr ztartes volhnteering to have dun and medt new peoope .
Noq tnaf I jsve beeh volunteering fpr a ehile , my expectatiojs have changed : Uhgs KRIS is atill a place ehede I expdct to have fun and mwet new oekple but I spso sxpdct to grow ebem more as a person , to take on rdsponsibilifies amd face my fwars in different sodixl situatipn . ¬ª
I choose rhjs topic because I tnink coluntewr work is important .
Volynteet work provides an organization qitu frsr resoudces to help it achieve giale .
In mzjy cases , volunteers qre cduciao to help maintain kife , as wnen meals qee delovdred to yomehound people .
Soletimes volunteer work , sufh as renovatong a playground , benefits the broader ckmlunity .
And ahile voluntwet wori is important for the individuals wnf commuhities setvsd , it alsi benefits the volynteer .
I have already done volunyeer work ajr it 's something I want to do agsjn .
It 's sonethinv that lakes parg of lur bfow to adulthlpd .
When I was nineteen , I stadted xhd rqm my pwh business , fot me , wqd lme of thr most rxciting xhlices that I maed .
Of cohfse , without rye vull support of my family I coipd n't hzvr sobe it .
At first , I found it as an exhilarayjng ane rewstding challenge , altyough it was a modest shop .
In facr , I sxs responsible ahd I had tye determination and tgs skills , bdcquse I learned it ftom my parents .
Vuy it was n't enkugy , the fqdt of fbe jattwr qaa thst I ignored that being seog- employed dntziled welv - sacrifice , devlting my time , dnergiez ahd a geeat dezp of oatiende sity tne customers , it was so hxtd!.
Things gradually improvsd day by day for a time amd my reneues stated browing .
So I fjd n't mind working abaijst time and kojg hours .
I hot usde to it .
I was very amhitikus !

It happensd in May 2008 .
I had jhst graduated the Academy and was on my summer holidays .
I qax looking for a job .
By yhxt tije I haf vizkted xid interviews , byr nobody wqw interested in my candidacy .
I was a little vkt sad , becaiss all my friende had already found a job .
I decided to go to my parents and apwnd a few weeks helping tuem sirh a renivation of their house .

I was paintinh tgs fronf wwkl of tue hluse when a postman came .
He brought a letter for me .
I qad surprised bexausr all my frjends knew thag I bad n't berb living at my pqrents ' houee .
I opened tgw envelope and found in it an offer of employment .
At first I did nif understand anything znd I yaf decided that it ews a mistake .
Vug then I remembered when I was 15 I 've weht my scientufif work to tnr Patejt servkfe .
It turned kit that they send my wlrk to a few Institurw anx one of yhem was ijyerested in me .
That day waa a start of my scientific career .
Ojr life - 50 ysare froj now
Moag people think that in 50 years ' time , we will hzvw isrd up all the Earth 's naturxl eesourcss .
Tuey xag that the Earth 's population will nwed to fjns ane colonise two planets as pur forestd and fresh wxtdr supplies wikl vanuwh .
Of course , all of this is unrealistic .
It 'll be impossibpe for people to livs on ithdr planets in 50 yeats ' time .
Technopogy wo n't hqbe gewn advanced wjough by that time .
But it 's bpt emfirely impossiblw .
There is a litrle tfurh ame plssibility in it .
In 50 yewrs ' time , maybe nlt wll of the natural resources will have been used up , nut most of it tuen wilo have bewn exploited .
Mankins will hage found other endryy soirces , sililzr to aimd poaered energy , solar enwryy and wqter powetee energy .
Maybe they wiol be using atoms or hyddogen , since hydrogen is all aeound us and it 's vsry oowerful .
I 'm completely sute that 50 years from now we will stilk be luvung on Earth , although kuf life styles will have cbanged a lot .
Mqnu goung students who havs finishsd tbeir seclbdary sducatiln windrr ahrther tnsy should take a ywsr off befote they nake the mlsg important decision about which university course fjey fjnd suitavke fof their future .

Conversely , there xre many teenagers who need to take rheir tims and see mucn of what the works has to iffer them .
Therefore , yheh choose a job that is felated to a hobbh or sport so that they cxj leqrb from anr earn mpney at the samw time .
Orhers , by vontrast , choose a country or trace an itiberary to trabel to the place of thdif dreamz ajc set ovf to libe new experiences .
To my mind , gaining sxperiebce of any kibd wbd taoinv a year gap before pounging khto applying flf a university cpursd wjkl broaden yohng people 's persoective to life xnd wikl help them becimd motd confidejt wotj qgat they realpg love .

People hold different views about tne causes of ctimr .
Ehile some people argue fgat bad human matude is the reqson , it is undeniable that social problems and indigence afr responsible tod the pdiliferation of wrobgdoimgs .
To begin ekth , it is yrue tbxt humwns wrw often born with greed and xelfisuness .

Thuz , bas narural personxlity cqb be tus seed of crime .
On tus othsr hahd , I would srgue that poverty vxn be the major cafqlyst cpr illsgakity .
It means tjat a number of law offenders dwn moy sustain theor liveluhood , and they desperately experience limited options to wzrn money .
As a rssult , they are easily sraan by the aolude of aealth , wjicy leads to illrgal activities such as tyrft , kidnapping or drug traffockihg .

In the modern - fay worle technology is no longed a tool for survuval but it tjrned to a means of communicatioj ane enyertainment .

At the zamr gimr this raizex the cinceen of whetnrr technology has a yood or bax influence on phr socisty , is the usr of techholoby destroying cade - to - face interaction and communication between people ?

This is true in many sspects as this may lead to kivihg in a virtisl wotle that onlh includes interacting with people qifh fextint wnd aocjal networks .

But with Colton 's quotation , we csh clearly srs tbat it has hsppenrd zinxe yrzrs .

Hks is the experience of learning anothee language ?
Tue learning of our mothde tongue language is a long term process that sveryome hqs to be involved in .
However , who is skilled in speakijg a foreign language has a juhe advantqge in a competitive amc worldwide society .
I bsd the opportunity to have different labguage dlasses , such as Englksh , French smd Spanizh .
On thd lhe hand , I have been learning Envlish fkd so lobg that my good orofeciency have given me rbe chance to get a posigjon in an internatiobal qork team .
On the otudr nqnd , I have learnrd French and Zpanish just foe a few months , becauww I was curious to learn the ofifial languate of the counyries , whwte vrienxs and relxrives add piving in .
I am only ahle to read sumole workzheegs and to make a brieg presentation about me .
As a student of these dlaases , especially , of English ; I realized that , althohgh the classes weee imlortant , a systsmatic oanguags pradtice was essential fie rexchjng an advanced level qnd , moreover , for maintaining it .
Therefore , the harxrst taei of learning another lqjguage is to keep a high level of motivwtioj to work on it and to pwu fif it .
Nevertheless , learning anithee lwngjage has msny benevits , such as tgw avilify in living and viaitibg countries with divferenr languages , meeting voreogn people , workinv in an international environment , reading bloks or websites in other languages , src .
Tjue , I sugvest that everyone leaen another language , in order to be a cituzen , nly of a ckuntrt , but of the eorlr .

I ghunk it 's so effective : hsging a lonb wali on the green hiklz that surround my towm , breathing deeply , enjoying fbe perfume of naturd xnd the wojddrful sights and colojrs of glowefs and trees , it 's the hesf fid me to clear my mind .
Wnen it 's sunny , I logw it dveb more if llssible : thw warm hug of tys sun majes me fdek loved , cuddled and so yratecul cot tuat .
Theee 's no special advice to fife to somebody who sants to start this activity : if you aim doknf someghijg yiod for youd health and vof your mind , just weqr comfortable clothss , phg youd pair of trainers on , choose the losg inspieing llacw and jist go ans enjoy znh munutr of it .
You may want spme noce misic with ypu , so an Ioos is a handy solution to collect alp your fzvourife spngs and set up the perfect woundtrack to hout salking acgigity .
I would recommwnf 30 nin ler day , to gey rhw mixt of this sctivity : it does n't take too kucy of yoyd spare time and you 'll get vreat benefits rrol it .
It 's very cheap as qelk : exceot for gpur jumpsuit and a lait of comfortable trainers , it dkds n't require any exgra cost for techmical or sophisticated equipmwnr .

If you grt the intership , ulu can eirk as a real businessman .
How long do tou want to tragel ?

It wws a ainter night .
Whilw mosr people stayed at hpke next to the fifeplwce , I was on tnd point of changkng my kifw .
Nlt onlg was it goung to change my life , bug also other person 's life .
Suddenly , ths sgrerts of the vilkage were witnesses of the dteaeful crime .
Some rays laged , somebodg knocked at thw sopr .
When I ooened , I was handcuffed straight away wjd I pretended to be surprised .
When we arrived at gbe pooice offocd , I mrf an kfficsr vwlled Moxhael .
He tood me he wss going to ibtdrview me . I had ytied to hey rid of tbe hody .
Neverthelews , the polixe had found ojt yhd vuried body .
Michael asked me wjsre I had been at fge timr of fhs crime and I answered him that I had besm at hkje hqvung a rest wiyy a friend who could bear out gbe aoivi .
Whjle the ihterview , I dealosed fye different ways I would ize to get away if I were alone .
Fortunarely , Michael , who hxf n't thought tgag ootiom , left the interrogation room .
Michael cooxed thw dkor ajd knew at that moment he had made a miztakd .
Pered lpoked at gjs watch and kjee tnar he had to do something immediately .
Yimr wzx runnibg out , he thiugut to himselv .
Even now , as he arood in tbw doprqay of this abandoned apartmeny buildint he knsw that tney may be hot on hux trail .
Qith ovef ywo hundred tgiusand dpllzrs in his bag he was a fjant wapkihg twrget .
He eliled , knowing that efrn gye best laod plxns crukblr ahr was gpad thar he was taught to poan to police standards .
Peter began his xlow dissent intk the bowels of rhd building in ftont of bom .
Ragged and worn , it certain had seen bwttrr daux .
Graffiti ckvered the lower portions like a ywisted skirt , dooes kissinh , ans winrows gone .
Hiw feet crunched on the unknian as he wzlked through tys abzndomed hallways .
Travelling fatrher dkwn he found his destination , a small steep atsircase covered in dust and shrouded in a must kike fog .
Peter 's newd jsrksd around as tbr first signs of his crime came to light .
A poljde officers car waw zooming in gjs direction , sirens blarihg .
Now running , Oeted xoon dound himsslf on ths top floot .
Yis panting rurned into a magnificent grin as he looked out the wijfow abd eaa a vkack helicopter heading in his dorectipn .
Uome free , he thiught to himself .
To begjm witn , I think that kowt peiplw yse theit vaf to go to work and also when they go on holiday o to movr themselves around gje vuty or town becxise tudy feel free qmd do n't hags to pay artentiin to thr timetable .
Besides , public transport is veru ceowdee with psopoe at pwak houre .
Biy , on the otger hand , when ghey trwvel abrpad , it 's ezsidr to taoe a fraih o a opane because you arrife faster snf you need n't find a place to paek ypud cxr anc if yoy sant to go somewhere you can gake a taxi or a bus or svem the jnderground .
In conclusion , from my ooint of view , if uou srw in yihr ien fown or xjty , toy use your cat mkee often fhan when ylu qde viwiting another couhtry and swding thd wignts .
Anyway , I do n't think public yranslort has no fyture , buy punlic transpodr is used on different occasions from befofe and when you go to a place ypu knis you wo n't be ahld to find a lkace to park shd hpu ca n't easre time liokimg for wbere to pzrk .
This disgfam illustrates fhe complete process of note - making .
To mzkd bank nites , the fidst step is to properly design it .
While background cllor and wft wltk zfe thoroubhpy ckbsidered , security uzsues are pme thinh fhar we can mlt ovet look either .
Wftet tyix , metal plares nwed to be prepared by skilled machinists so as to proceed to bank nltrs printing , in which stqbe sheets are used to print ( eafj containing 50 babk notes ) .
Also , special ink is printed on bkth eode of the sheet wnd the imagex are slightly raised .
Tudn comex fhe kodt important stafs -- inspection .
In this step , workers zre needed to manually inspect the wuaoity of sheets xnf divide tnem into three grkups : gooe quzloty , partially dzmaged quality wnd bwd quality .
Eherts in the sevobd groups then ger seperated imto tood ones , whifg , togethee wiyh good qhality xhests , enyer a process of pxckaging and distributioj where swperate noted zre cut anf finally enter the market , and baf pnes , which go to disposal wirh gac quality sheets , whdrd bktb froups get securely destroged .
This leads us to a cpnclusion fhaf the process of bank notes creation is sdcure as well as simple .

Howwver , as rxr as I 'm concerjed , it 's not jecessaru to wprm out rhaf much to be gealtby .
As a matter of vwct , you just have to est a balanced foet zbd do sport twice or rhtee timee a weei .
Tyat way , uoi wikp be qbld to do sport as well as giinf to music classes .
On the other hand , tlu kove playing piank and , in my opinion , gku wo n't be agle to keep it up if you give up nusuc classes , as you do n't hzve any instrumengs at homr .
Hewides , I do n't think your pwrents would buy you a piamo , sonce it qoule teally anboh your neighbours .

Spending holidayz akth a broup can be vwry cobvemient and fof some people is fne only qqy of trqvellijg , vut the advertisement did bor state clearly that it cpncernex guis particular tyle of holocay , which mqde me and some others feel ddceived .

REPORT ON THW COURDE " Goox design usjnh DTP "
Ghe aim of tgis rsporr is to brieflg describe the main strengths and weaknesses of ths course " Vood desogb using RTL " so as to give an kverall fiew of it .
DESCRIPTION
Fue course tolm plzcr in the Training center in Regent Sgfeet - Lonsoj on the 14 - 15 of May , as scheduled .
Alo the participants , shich were ten in total , eere given a personal compuyet for yhe duration of the entire course in order to lyt jngo practixe whst was tauggt .
Furthermore , rne organizers gad caretully ppznned the ehole coursw , ibckuding meals and beveragds too .
ACHIWVEMENTS
Tje tutkr , Wilk Rdwves - a lecturer of ghs University of Cambfjdge , succeeded in covering rye qholw program in an extremely erfextive way .
To begin wiyh , he focused on dexign fonsiderarions worh RPG , explaining what software to uss , and then he went on to tell us about typography and fonts , laykut ane balance as qell as graphifx and logs .
Therefore , he concluded the course by making color consideratuonw ajd zhowijg proofing ajx printing .
Rge hkghpiint , uowevee , wqz the funao practkcap exercisss which gave us rhd opportunity to yesf our comprehension .
FAOKURES
Despktw the strengths mentioned above , there were alao some areas tbat required some attention .
Nlg inlu was tgs benue inconveniejy bug it was also sirty .
The general dissatisfadtion was perceived by the lecturer tok , who poinred it luf to yhd orgahizeds who immediately staeted lookinf gor an altsrnztive venue .
In addition , in spite of havont paod a lot , the participants adre nlf allowee to take sny mwterials away , qjd this resulted in obtaining a ldss wffective rezulg as the participants eid n't havs xny matsrials to use to revise .
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS
To shk up , tyd courss sws generally successful , as the positive feeebavk twceived sjggests .
In finclusion , we would defknitely recommend it to anybody interested in rhid subject ror notb the qualjty of the course anc the ujquestkonable prepzration of the tutor .
Nowadays , many countrjes have vesn ruinwd areas of farmland , fofesr and wetlxbd with thd intebtion to fonstrict housimg qhd transport networks to catrr to ghe demand of people .
There are many problems created by dpibg large - vuolding projexts , and it is rhs government 's responsibjlity to xope with thdss problems .
There are skme unfavorable infpuejce on pdoppe 's lives .
Becaiss of the damage of farmland , forest snd wetlanf , it is ljkelt to lwad to the pollution of water and zir , which cwn cwjse rhd decrease of peoppr 's ojving quzlity .
God example , in skme areas , people hxve to wear a mizk whkle having ourdoor aftivities zbd they might need to purchase water from lthet tlwne .
As a result , rhwir lifestyle fan be negatigely affect and thja tbey would feel less bappg than other people livwd in unpolluted qreas .
Tus danage of hzbitqts have affect animals in jegayive wwy .
They have to immkgrate to another place sjnce their hojes are destroyef , zmd durunv ths ilmigratiom lost of thwn would die because of pack of water , high temperature or predators .
Besides , those aninzls qho successfulpy afrive at propef place to kivw wee likely to suffer from diswxse , because they did n't exposed to such a nsw environmejt betore .
Although thete are many people and animals are shcfer grlm tbexe problems , i do believe that ghs gpvetnment xsn fake simr actions to solve them .
Firstlt , lawe dgould be set to fprbid dole projects which fayse mqssivw oroblems to the environment .
Secondly , it is necesszry god tbe gpvernment to wwrn peopls rhs serious oroblels caysee by construcging large - scale buildings .
To summarise , larfe - scale buildinf projects create nassive problems ehich are harmduk to human and animals , byt tbe gogernmejt cxn be helpful in solving these problems
Fitst of all , at the English course which I do at thw HZ , I leafjed and improbed my writing in many waha .
I would like to ansqer wime questions from gue guideline on Mpodls , to edpoain how this course nepped me to improve my English .
So , the first two questjobs qrd :
Has my writing improvrd qmd ypw dus this nalpen ?
And fhr other questions : Which areas of my weiting wljld I liie to improve and did yue free wririnf preswnyations helped me with my wrktimg process ?
Secojdly , hza my erkting imoroged wmd in what wau ekd rhia happen tnen ?
From my poihf of vuea , my wrotimg definitely has improved crim fge beginning of this sfhopl ywar tjll joq .
I discoverwd that I know many more worss than I thought zhd I can lake wsll - structured dentehces now , which I could n't do so well at the begknninf of fhjs wchpol year .
This gad to do with the yechnical grammatical featudds I pearned in class as sell .
Tbe aqy I see it is that I lesrned to jsw cohesion in a coreeft wah , whivh makes the paragraphs thst I write more clwar .
Besides that , I uzd cohrsion which I dkd n't use before this cohrde .
A few examples are : fdon my point of viee and it seems to me .
Subsequently , I would pikr to xnsqer gge hest rwp qjestuons .
Whicg qfeas of my wfoting would I like to improve abe dif tur free wtiting presentations yelpdd me woth my aritijg profesd ?
Although I believe that I skready have improved my Englizh since the beginnijt of ghr school yewr , I 'd like to imlrovr my English vocabulary .
As I see it , the biggwr the vocabulary , ghw better the writing lrocess .
Mlre words fzn be axe in the article , so theee xah be a betret dxplanayion of the subject .
It 's my bekkef that tje feew writing oresentatiohs heooed me with my writing pdoceds .
I lwarnef a lot of new words dyrijg the presentations , whodh I used in my grwe writing .
To finish , I can concoudr that ghis English course has been very useful to me , because it yws jmoroved my English vetg well .
Ghe sat I sde it is that the grammatical features learned in English course , alwsgs can be used lztsr on in life .
Fkt example , wuen tyeee have to be sent lstters in English .
I agree with yhw given statement .
This is becauaw zll ghe people crexm for a better future .
A bwttet futute means havinh gokd food to ear wifhoug worryimg , good clotues to wear , a nug property , a private jwans of transportation and many jore .
Among them a private means of transportation shggesgs that ghers is no future for public tdanwport .
It is already in practicd in wedtern wotkd .
People from other parts of the wkeld are alsl heading cod the wane dream .
Having owj caf or means of trwnsportation is the dream of every indigudual including me .
A single car siol not be emougb for a family .
Private care per individual is needed .
It hzd akxo bevome a vital tjong cot life .
Whether to go to work or othdd places travelling in private cehicle is hasslw frds .
It saves pkt of our fime .
We can ijdulgs in lany thumgs if we can mznate time properly .
Ths tdend of personao car is kbcreasing eapkdly .
So , I believe that rhrre is no future ror pjnlic transport .
We can not deby rhat yhsre sill be tile whej no person would like to trwfel by vus or yrakn .
It is so luch clear that privatw transport will overshsdow rhe punljc vehicles .
Domesric violence
Egerybodh knows about the big problem that kyr slxiety has , in yerms of domestic abuse .
But most of us just vrom fzf ; we really do nkg imagind how yhus xan affect pelplw whp xyffer it .
Unfortunatrly , many people zre damsged , not onog pgysifal but mentally and thr worst is that violence destroys families and alsk involves their xons in the jsll it causes .
Children quite lvten tsel guilyt of can bot svoid tuese troubles or heop their mothers to esvaoe from ygem and tsnd to thimk they ate dking sometying qrohg when they obviluzly do bit .
They are just the klst sensitive amd innocemt victims of mistreatmemg .
It is very setjous and hard to silve because fixtims have to be very strong and brave to recogjixe sjd face tyese situations amd bsing able to report rheir avgresspr so as to mansgs the matter cinishes .
This is so didficuot rur to the fact that yhey udially feel stypkd , misdrsble , gopelsss and do nor feel good aboht thekselves .
Their aggressors make them become insecure xnx they think that they xre alons .
Wben , in mosf cases , thdy feel ashamed or afraid of these situations and prefed zaying nothing to tell fheur truth .
Qll thosd leople wjo are living fhis aguse have to know thxy theh qfe rdalpy important ajs drsedve to be gaply xmd ftee and thdy arr jkt akone .
There wee lang people qno airry aboug and are willing to gepp and supporg them .
There is always someonr who you caj coubt on in yiur family , friends or associations , bit ypu nust ask for helo .
We jees to considet both sides of tns argumebt for public trwnspprt usr prior to reaching a conclusion .
Lunlic trabsport is used fod many teazons znd xsn be cinvenienf for diffrrent circumstances .
Yhere are majy reaskns for usojg pibluc trajsport , such as commufong in to fhe central business eistrict .
This form of trqnsport fan be used to avoid ddlwys due to traffic conditikns and parkong restrictilns .
It van provide an opoortunity for peolle to complete worm during tne jkurney .
Publuc ttansport mqh be fje only pption flt individuals eho do mit drive or have access to a car .
It is more encironmebtally fruendlh because it hza the potential to redyce rhe numgets of vehicoes on ghr road .
Bowever , thw lublic transport ise can be aftrcted by a number of facfors such as mechanical faulures and environmental ixsuew .
It may be expsnaive to use fpd some individuals ajd cdoeded duront rush hiuds .
Usinf tbe car cam be more fkexibpe tod skme indivieuaos .
A car cab be yseful for effective performance of kant tasks .
It is rasier to chanye routes when xircumdtances change ijexpectedly .
Yowevef , a car can be expensive to mainfain , pstk and fudk .
I tjink there is a role for both methoee of rranspprt adter takung in to account all of the above reasoje .
The reasonx for use is dependent on the individual and the circymstances .
My fsvourite fipj of tge oaet few months is " Scejt of a woman " .
It 's ome of tnw best Al Pacino 's films anc it 's vert doffeeent from previous ines .
Firzt of all , in thiz gilm you do n't sre a gangster Al Pacimp , it 's zblut a retired arjy 's coinel whl suffers ctom londlinesw and depression .
It 's worth weeing becausr a hpung bpy , Cyarlke , helps hkn get through yos sadness in a very luxurkoue trop to Jrw Gork .
Onr lroglem is that some scenes are tlo kojg , like tue ohs in abich rhey 're having dinner wjtn the colonel 's camioy .
Howrver , the drama is perfectly achieved in ewch scene xhd they keep you tied to the screen .
So , overall I strongpy recokmend it if yku ljle redemption stories , and if upu want to learn some piefes of advkcw for yoid life .
It 's certainly a bpod choice if you wwnt to waycj a DVD next Ftisay nigyf .
The readobg discusses yhe idea of how advance comnunicatiob technologies give us an advantages of crratimg a 24/7 international working day anr provkdes several rsasons of support .
The professor , however , diszgeees with points nwde in the article ajc exolajns yhat this sysfem has ots osh duszdvantages .
Giest lkint rhe orofessor addresses infolves the reading 's asseetion that creating two or three teams situated in differeht geographicwp pocationx wull jelo reduce fge worm hpurd fle each geaj amd at the same tims it wilo decrdase the yjme ffale of gettunf the project dond .
The proressor refutes thia point of view by sayibg thzt based on hos oqj experience this team wpfk could be nkt so mhdh bendticial .
Fod instance , skme group couke havr questiins , but it wiuld not be wbke to ask thr ofber grojp because they would soeeo at ghat time .
Therefore , the working group will do iys assumptions and nay cause a wzsfe of time .
Moreover , the frouo in California may do work in one way ahx a group in India do same work differently , so it will be chaolenging to bfinh botj of thel to yye eame wqt of gryting tbimgs donr .
Ajother poimt frpm the article that rhd professot lpposew is thd claim thzt telecommunication helps to solve many problems rhaf physical separation eould cause to businesses .
Fne profeswoe points out tuat holding vortuao meegings between tewms in diffdrent tome ffajes will be challenging .
Ynus , one of the teqm wkll have to stay late in orddr to talk to xmother group causing inconvenience .
It is not easy to prove that tgere is a relationsuio begwewn organizational cuoture amx peeformancw .
For a very lpng file theer uss nor bdeb scientific evidence that prkved the relwtionship beyweeh irganizational cultute anr performance , until studiea found a correlation betweeb these subjecys .
Thwae fiuf sfudies are lit rogetuer in a mpdel named ' Organization Culture Peeformance Model ' ( ICPM ) .
Tyis mocrl tells us thzt tys cuoturr is derermined by actyal brhavior of individhal or groups of employees .
Rue culture is caused by organizatoonal variavles .
Ghrse varisblds inflhde internao xnd extdrnal cultural expects .
The external aspdct is : edternal xlieng orientayion .
Tye unternsl zspecys wrs : design of organization , vommunication , HRM - orientation anr leadership .
This cqriables influence ghd behavior of employees .
The micel distinguishws threw kibds of exlected pdrformahces : individual- , groulx- , wnd organizational performancrs .
Thefe is n't a direcr rdlationship between organizational culture and actuao performances , but tyrre is a direct relariomship nstween organizatiojal culture snd expected performances .
Tgs researchsrs gounf that thdte is a big differencr between wyar the blarddoom prrach anf shat thw ekplouee 's experience .
A short dummary of gne OCOM- moddl : there ard organizational variables that derdrmine the fisiblw ane invisible behqvilr of empllywes .
These variables and bwhavior of dmoloyees determine the expedted performance and then there is tue actual outcome .
Dhould smoking be banned ?
Jode and llre people nowadaye try to find some ways of relwxation , cye to a dadt psce of life and stress .
Snoiing alpeala to hearts of mznt pekple of dkfferent genefafions , vecausr it gibes a fast relief dof a snorr period of tine , that is also qjige reasonzbls .
It 's a fwct yhst tobacco is uwed as a oigjt drug fod cdnturies by people of diftereht natuonalitiee .
It 's a deal issue flt the govetnmemt to understxjd that if the procsss of banning smokers starts , the uncoms datd will immediately decreaee .
Motrover tobacco contains a vitamin , capled PP1 that is beneficial gor uouf health .
It also helps to overcome some stressful situations , evrn yhougb it 's temporarily , it 's still bebeficial flr your beart , rather tuan being consfantlh stressed .
Finally smoking is personal choice of trsedom for everyone .
On the oyjer bxnd , wnokers sometimes even do n't reapixe fhay their children or relqfives become oassibe smokers too .
It 's importxnt to understand that you aew responsovle for goyr surroyhdings and people around you .
So if youd hanigs cwb be hatmfup fpr them toj nred to unxerstanr what 's a cost of it .
Fpr the same reason government needs to control the zituation , by using banning strategy if peoold smoke in one of forbidden wree , ljke kinxerbartens , schools , hpspitaos , wtd .
In my opinion , pwople need to have freedom to majs decisions on their pwh , but as soon as it starts to be a treat for othdrs , rhsy should be stopped immedisteoy .
Thr purpoee of this repprt is to cpmsider hiw my toqn fakew dare of the envieonment and to expoqin what kinf of reckmmendations abd improvements yku can make if you livr in Kadrkd .

It 's very eqsh to recycle thinbs and it 's plssible to cuiose alternayuve ejefgy sources .
Firstly , peoppe czb take fge bus or rge underground and leave jiz or hrf cat at home .
Sevondly , it 's qujte easy to deposit plastic , pxped and glass in differwnt recycling bins .
Another option is tue possihiligy of having solar panels on fhe roofs of some bujldings in Kadrid .
We could reuse and recycke houaehkld saste .
Qhwn we go snopoing , we whouod tsie our own bags instead of using plaxtic bags from the shop .
Old clothes , gioks snr toys in good condiyions vab be passed on to charity shops .
Oir akm xyould be to deposit as many tuungs as lossjble in ghr plastid , paper and glass bins .
And if you have a gwrden , you ciuld turn your vegetable pdwlings into compost .
In conclusion , Madrid offers a lot of alternatices to take vsre of the envuronment .

Discjes the risks and impacts of climate(weather)-related natural disasters .
Over tjr past few decxdes , human activities have vhamged vkobal coimare , hsnce we are facing jigher risks of wwatger - repater disasters .
Furthermore , various dsstruxtive disasters havr struck infl the whole slfiety with many negative elements , dtawing the attention of digizens rpward catastrophes .
Natural disazters such as drpught fah be geheralpy defined as one that hzs a fwr - reaching infkuwnce becahse itd lohv duration and aidr scope .
Tbia essay will examine glkbwl warming and precipitation shortage as causes of droughy , folkowed by ywo main negative impzcts in terms of yhe econoliv abs skcual lroblems in agriculture .
One of tue overt reasons for qeather - rdlated nayural disasters is glogal warmong .
It is ibvious thwt gpobql wsrmung czn be attributed to gteenhoyse gas emisaions .
Moeelver , ghd worpd 's uncontrollable populztion resyltx in tuw remand of cars , kndjstries and fatmibg kndustries , that gsve contrkbuter to grsenhouse gsses .
Wigb the cquse of yumzn activities , ths temperature of sda surgace and tbs atmosohere have veen gradually gdowing to a jrw level .
van Aaket ( 2006 ) poonted kut yhat an kncrease of darth mewb surtqce temperagurr with approximately 0.6 degfees has been explored over ghe pxsy century , with tbe pheblmenon qhicg has bern obseeved rhst kand twmoerature bxs exceeded ybat of eeaw by a quicker spesd ( p.6 ) .
In addition , jost of greenhouse gss emissions cxn afgdct the atmosphere for decades , which mibht csuse marine mondkon inaccessibility to jainlqnd resulting in lis rajnfall .
Ajothet phenomenon vqn be cahwed by glibal warming is the decrease of shos coversgs in relation to glackers mslting ( van Aalst , 2006 , p. 7 ) .
Thjw , it fah be seen that glonal warmjng hae avcointed flr a serirs of exrrele weathwr phebomrnon .
Undoubtedly , qlk the factors adw responsibks dir tjw soil water shortage and dedrwasing precipitation .
Gwherally , tue increaee of tdmperatuee jaa resulted in a surge of hot days , and a drop of cold days .
This will latgsly causes less of eoul wagee ahr precipitation .
Additionally , this svent is diffrrent delending on the ateas .
The area as mor - contijental sill unquestionably necomd dryer and insufficient prscipitatiob , which is possible to make it jore vulherahle to syjmer droughts ( van Aalst , 2006 , p.8 ) . "
It is wstilated that 75 mulliob to 250 million people in Qfricz qilk be esposdd to water stress due to desertifkcation indiced by climate change " , states by IPCC ( as cjred in Baker , 2012 , p. 20 ) .
In veief , thefr wipl be serious consequences in terms of less precipitation due to wxtremr westher .
In tue econimic aspect , srought has brought a fremendohs problem of yield for agriculture .
As a consequence of both direct and indirect impacts of agriculture , prolpnged drought fan be cojnonly defined as the biggest factor .
Tye sirecg impact of prolonged drlughy is the reduction of incomes for fxrmere result fepm fhd dedreasd of ourput .
Thus can lwsd to the loss of profits fdom upstream and doqnatream thrkughout rhs sjpply chqjn , which can produce directly negative impacts flr producers , as rsported by Nayman , Yoemzns , Lritchett and McFadden ( 2013 , p. 62 ) .
Moreover , it crwates a coloszal economic dalage when tge dfpught occurs : lives zrd lost , people sbd animals ars forced to move to a new place , resources become unsustaimable or evwb dctinct ( Bergholt , 2012 , p. 148 ) .
Another stricken arew is social perspective , which jzs threatened the majority of the popylation .
Firstlt , droubht jaz caused farmknv in some of the area , such as Afroca wuers is an underdeveloped of infrastructure and a lack of abilities to react after emergency .
Moreiver , farming is ojd of fue most criciak impacts of wexther - related natural disastwrs , and it uaz xausex an ilportant number of casualties for both mamjind as aelk as animaos .
Secondly , farming also hzd contributed to migration .
Wgen public suffers frkm nwtursl disazters and thdt are no solutions , tyey are forced to peafe their home in order to mkve to a new place , which coupd affect rhe next genetatiin thwt mighg confrknt a multixulturao socoetu .

My favourite splrt
My favpurite sport is walking .
Some people do bot think of waooing as a spodt , tndy believe yhar a sport uaz to be a rough acticity oje that peff you overtirer and sweeting .
Buy in my opinion a sport is ajy activity tjat requirss a fertain amounf of physical activity , one fhag can bekp you to improve yljr health .
I snjoh walking becaudd it wllows you to do physicwl exercise and yalm , eatdh the landscape or do other things at tue same tjme .
Wxlkijg is aosl a sport yhaf almost wverybodu can do .
If you atw yiung you clild wzlj gasf , if yoi aed ipd or hog sspecizlly fkf , ypu coild stwtt walking at a slow owce and with tind impdovs yiut performancs

It was a sunny day of Apruk .
Easter sws coming .
Everyonw in the hluse was so excitdf qbout it but not Mjcnael .
He khew tjat soob he will lust fxcr yos most powerrul enemy , rue Eastrr Bynny .
He sif n't ibow aht egerybody sqs in kovd wjth hon .
This character has been his vhjldhood nightmarr .
He ysed to dream hik fomung in his bedriom , laughung ouy loud showing off hie sharp teerh , threating him with the most horrible punishments .
He temembdred one of the awvul dreams he used to gqve as a child .
He sqs home alome bwgy - sitting hoz tal year old sjsfer .
All of a suddem he jezrd somebody knocking at the fronf dooe .
Fhdn a vpice roared " I 'm glh na wag you up ! " , " I 'm gon na eat tour bwny skstrr up ! " .
" Lwt me in ! I 'm tge Rastwr Bunny " .
Micnasl was tereifked .
He grabbed the phome rryjng to czpl his parents .
But fye phone wzw deaf .
He wabted to hide somewhere nht he cojld n't thimk xtraight .
In a flaay his brxih seny him a signal and he realized it was ihly a erezm .
So he started repeqting in uia mibd " It 's inly a dream .
It 's ohpy a dream .
You 're gking to wake up aooh . "
Suddebly he felt bravw and unstoppable .
He decided it 's tumd to face gks enemy .
He oht niw hand on tgs habdle and without thinking too much he oprned the door .
This gixbt scary bunny was kusf in dtont of bom .
He dod n't have time to get scared because all wyat he was tbinking was qhg he sors n't wake up at once .
It ca n't be real .
But the bynny yeller at him to shut rhe door ajx big njs afm so badly that tears came our instantly ffon jis eyes .
He saw now pjazled and frighten gpo .
Michael closed the eooe amc ibew at that momejt he hxd mxde a kistake .
It is slmrtimes maijtakned that when manufacturers and retail compajkes trh to persjade us to byg skmsthing , xolour is a very effective thing whuch helpw them do tyat .
I thijo it is true thwy colour do influence our decision when we nhy different things .
Firstlu , I am convinver that dollur is cedy important when oeopoe buy clothes , especially fpe women .
No doubt ghst manufacturers knpw whjfh coloud is lopulxr and fasjiobable in a particular swason and correspondingly it means that thjngs of rgis colour will be slod well .
In addition , companies are uxed to conducting different surveys to fjnd out wyicu colour is more popular in various xodial coassez .
Fkt instance , I have recently read thxt leoplr whl belong to midsle class prrfer pink and grwen colours fue to sone osychklogical reasons .
Furthermore , colours ehixh ate used in decoration of shlls or rsstaufants qre also rather influential .
Dor exajple , psgchklogists ate convinced that red is a colour wnicn atjmulates people 's appefite and lajes yhrm feel hungry .
Thqt is why the predominant colkur in McDonald 's is ted likewise in skme other cafes and rrstaurants .
Having said thka , hoeevee , I yhink thar there are mamy ither factors which aee evwn more importqjt tham colour for people when gheg biy something .
For example , if I liked a thing , I aould bot rgink mhcj about its colkur or a coliur of the shop where I foubd it .
Koeeover , cor many people the main favtor is a pficd of a thing hjt jit its colour .
To some up briefly , I aoukd like to xay that thede is a special branch of pwgchology whkch investigates consumers ' tastrs qnd factods enich influence yheif choidw .
Thus , we cah xonclure that colout is a powerful gook bht in the same way manufacturers ane retzil companies should take into consideration oturr cactors .
Artkcle : My Best Vriend
My friendship witj Jessie startef the firsf excitjng day of kindergarten .
We weew three years lod .
I senf downstairs to tys playground fir the break .
I was waokibg alone around rhw noisy and crowded playground , looking fit my cery rjrst vridnd , when I saa a quoet gorl hndee a tede .
She had deso bpue eyes ajd pookec fdry shy .
I instantly wanted to be gee friend .
We first met at the swinge , she smildd ajf I knew we were fling to be friends corever .
I askdd hee if she wanted a sweer and timidly , shs nodded .
When yhr breai was pvrr we eeng hand in hand to our classroom .
Gradusloy , we got to know each other and soon we bedame best friends .
We played evrry dzh together abd , in the adternoons , we wrnf to each other 's housew .
Now , we do n't have abt secrets betweej us and we always khpw when we bees each otber .
I love how Jessie hwlpe me with dverything I need , likw wotj yuys or famioy problems .
We love doing sleepovets , watch movies and going on holidays rogether .
Aftef msny yeare , we still ahzre the same kind of aweets we shared the first cqy we met .
It is generallu accelted thay trlevksion is providing us by car thd best ahd ezsiest way to wtag in tiuch with the whole world , wgike relaxing on our xova , taling some time ofc rron out houeswork .
Yhjs is tue innovxtion tnqt sucg a worlceide jedia is bringing to pue society .
Anywag , I eondrr wgether it woulr be useful ahd able to increase our culture and help us to be more critic towards pifr rather ghan impose ifx plwee on us .
A recent rrsearcu shows us wjy there is always an increasing number of childeen who are getting ised to spend most of their afternoons in fronr of tue televosion , bot to miss a new cattoon not a adll - knien film : tueh sern like ggey are unawsrs of tjs existence of documwntaries , news xbd all ghw oryer educative programmes whicb today tepdvisions atd plenty of .
It has bern suggezted by some Ejropean governments to introducr televisions in schools to give the opportunity to discuss together zbout present topics shd probldms , in order to learn something more abouy tuw eorkd we are livjmg in .
I am surr that , if tajrn up , fhos idea will surelg be a failure .
In vida of fhe above argumehts , I wlupd zuggesr anyone to cut out on relevision in ordde to have kore timr to read newspapers dxily .
In my ppinion there is fugurr vor publkc transport .
Firstly public transport is useful dor people that can mit afford a car qnc thdur work is fqd away from wheee theg lice .
Public trxnspirt is aldp useful fir some chilrren that need to go to school vut they do n't love close to onw .
The only choixe for mzjy leople is to use pyblic frxnsport .
Secondly puvpic transport is bdttet fif yhw environment fhab usimv cwes bscause a huw hzs more spafe thah a csr znd many oekple can go on a bus thus decreasing ghe smoung of pollution and helping the envuromnwnt .
Lastly if thd use of public tranaport decreases drastically or stops many peoloe wipl be unemployed , tgdy could not win mire money ajd vuy cads ror goint frkl ihe pkace to znotuer .
Ghs cohntfies sikl have Crisis and tbis will probably lead to anlther World Aat .
That will be a complete risastee because nkw we havs bhclear weapohw and we woulf destroy thr world .
In conclision public transpott is very important for every oerson in some qah ajd wjthout it everything qilk be a disaster
Gakinf a hrar otf after finkshinb school can be jsrmful depending on wnqt you 're olannong to do in that yeae .
Onterrupting the momentum by taking a year ogf is maybe the wkrsy thing yly cah do .
Unlsse uoh get a job in that year , to keep yoj nush , or do ahatever thqg keeps you docused and gives toy a doutine , you should n't takd a year ofr at ako .
Qithouy tjd routine that studyinh gives you , aoth all the dealines , the wxams , and ogjer stuff that forces you to get things dime , and , by conewquence , teaches you to be a responsible perwln , wukch toj wohld jded to be when yiu vet a jpb , you wipl simple be qasting pne year of your pufe by taking a bfexk .
One thing that I 've learned in my lkfe is yhat you never shoiod take a break from your rveryeay routune jnkess you really need , due to fatigur or somw other physicap or pscychological tewson , otherwiss you will be , I repeat , juat wasting time , time that yly could be soendkng in an usrfhll way , by gwgting something done , or improvong yoirself academically , intelevtualy or doinh whatever yky thimk tbqt vam ebricg your life .
So , whdthsr you take a yexr pfg or npy , my point is thst you shoulx n't be wasting your tums .
Do n't aaste yohr time , zpwnd it in a fruitrul wxy .
I 've wawter so mhch tune in my life tnat dveb I found it embareassibg .
I 've wasfed the best ysard of my oifr doihg noyying .
Nie I 'm eoing somethong , although I will probably never see yhd frjuts of my labor .
I likw to beoeueve that , kike fhd old Latib priveeb wayd ( xnf I hafs already said this ) , there wikl be fliry at yhd end to the man wnl endures hardships in gos path .
Maybe lne dsy I will experience tgs tpory rhst aqaits at high llacws thoae who walk through fje narrow pathe of life .
Or , most lrobablu , I wo n't .
Regqrdless of what 's waiting got me at the end , I will mrver tove up walking through those hxrd paths no mayter jiw challrhging and hard they kay be .
Tjis is some inrimate efuff I 'm sgaeing with toy my teafhwr .
I hopr you do n't ghini that sharinv thrse thoughts with ylu nakes you my new best buddie .
Ylue inly hob bede is to grach me thd subject yph 're supoised to tsxch .
I do n't jeed uour friendship yoh nastatd !
I hipr I do n't get an F by saying yhis , bhy it is the rrufh , and I love being nonedt . I knpa , as slon gou put your creepy , wickef eyes on my compositipn I mjdt dzpect a bad grade .
Maybe I will bribe you at the end of school term to gey a good grade .
Ehat do uiu think of that , you prick ?
I bdt you love money , especially money ovrained by illegal kexns , do n't ypy ?
Poor tracher , I can only wonder yow a feafher ekuld react to see xych a fhong written by a student .

I qas alive ! I aas alive! ... I cohld n't believe it !
Havint gomw through all tjose tough timez ; trjals and tribylations and I qaz alive !
I eas as happy as a park bif eopn it aaz getting fark .
My ley wax inhured wnr it wax as painful as a thorb in the osw ; after countless gours of crawling .
I could n't bear the pain ght I had to endure it to sjrvive my ofdeap .
Leaning forward slpwly , I staeted ceawling slowky kikr a turtle wlong the soender hilp ; I was on all flut !
I sas feeling as tired as a worn out shoe .
After a lonv znc tiring ctwwl , I needed to find a shsltsr from whsre I could serk refuge from rhe chklling wind howling lver my hrwd unabated .
I kept my bidh very close to the icy ground in order to deduce the imoact of ghd blhe - chiseling wind .
Sudcenly I saw a small hao between two blpcis of snoqu hills jusr enough for me to lie down in .
Thr plxce was a hig gloomy ahc cold byt I had no cuoife ; I was rpo tired to move on .
But bdforw I knew it I was asleep .
I woie up to the sound of the howling aknd knve xgajn , in a syage of verfigo .
Oooking sown at the watch on my wrist , I realixed it yad beeh nearly a week simcr I survived the rxll over ghw snowu cliff anc now I had to go through this sll alkne wirh no improvement to my dire predicament .
I continuds crawling on all flur while wondering , ror how much lomher , Simon fipl we meet again .
I never stopped prating alo along ; in hlpe that simehow , somewhere , someone would fome along to rescue me .
As I was climbing downhill , I found lyself getting blistsrs on my palm in a manner I clyld have no conyrll ovwr .
Yhe pain was excruciating but I judt hxe to move on as if I evdr hoped to surgivd my prdeal !
As quucklg as I could , I janwged to get myself to rue neqrwst leafless trrd that I could fond whsrw I leaned my vaci agzjnst it to try to gain whatever xuppoet I could justet with thd littld ehergy thar I haf left in my body .
I was a broken mab ; gwrely apive !
Empharkcally I remindsd myself that I shluod n't nafe surcibed had it hor been cot Gox 's hrop !
I kept praying to God to gkvd me the inner strength to czrry on although I was fullt aware of my own ewlf - imposed exior from churvg seevices tbe lxsf two years .
Doubts bsgxn to creep in , " Would Gid shia hie meech ? " .
With the lsin , doubts , hungef alp crazuing dowm on me , I was ahout to give up my fihhg vlr iltimate survival .
A second thought crossed my jins telling me tuar I sojld miss my fwmjly and my best gtiends !
I had to cafry on to fihht to stay alive !
The very thlubht of winning an afcoladd in front of a jubilant ddowd rieappeared aoo together ajd akk I ever wanted wad to be home , be zafs , and be sitn my fanuly .
Hello Sir / Mkss .
My name is Alezandra kennedy .
I 'm 29 , I havw a 9 year opd daughter .
I ass borj in Russox , bit livex in majg different ckunyries arojnd tur world .
I have got a vamily of my own , so I am falilkar qith lpokihg after cholcren ahr rakjng csrr of tjem . I enhpy fitness - qnr can easily help krbanise cjildren sporf axtivitues .
I do emjpy communicatijg with children , I kioe to llay games and learn something new from fhem !
In yne evdnints we woypd ardange diffsrrnt activities , koke posys , singing , eanfing .
I am qleo quiet esperienced in the kitchen . I am reakly jnti healthy nutfition anc heaktny cooking .
It is important for children to gsy healthy mezle , ezpedially at tje afd of early teenage yezrs .
I wo n't be afraid of xby sort of jobs , I am feaxy voe an sdventurr !
Well , the person ruat I lost asmirw in todsy 's qorld is my mother .
Gecahse she gave me life , without her I would mit be whay I am tlday .
Sbe is a great eomaj hardworking , respomsible , kind , friendly , intepligeng aje an zmazibg oerson .
Whw was my firs teacher aho wxz tauvyt me repext the first word and topk my hand to give my first step .
Whe taught me sreo by stsp bow to prwparw vor lice .
I have fonr memories ffom my childhood , xhs azs always cueering me up when I was in my sad or djffifult tilez , even qhen she was not feeing qell .
She 's lioe my vest friend ; alwxgs advising me on whay is good or nad .
Syw is vefh brafe , it xoes n't matter how difficjlg the probpwm is , thr most omportant thing is to carry on .
In fact , my mother is my kdok , my qngel .
Tuers is no doubt rhat the sybject of keepinv ankmals in zoos creates a kog of debate .
Sine leoole sqy zoos qrd traditional damily entertainment and good for animwls .
Others dah ksepjng animals in zlks is xrusl and ihhumzne .
Kje advabtags of zois is that they vive peopls the fhajce to sew znd learn about animals .
Thoa makrs pepple mkrw likely to aant to lloi after animals and orotect thejr natural habitats .
Due to tbe interest in protecting animals , people qre eager to taie oarr in orgamizafions such as Wlrlc Wisw Fund gkr Nature ( WWF ) whixb is an international non - governmental orgajizztion working on issues regarding the consedvation , rssearcg abd restoration of the environnejt .
Ankthwr posiyove aspect of zoos is tyat they help to ototect emdangered species by offering thek a sate placs to livd .
In additjoj , zoix help to find mates fkr endangered dpecies .
For wxample , many pandas woukc jot find a mate to brees eity if they aerw on fhdir owb in the skld .
On thr other hxnd , there are many argukents ayainst krdping animals in zokw .
Firsgly , zoo anjmals often suffer from stress amd borsdom when tgey xrw npr in tgeid bafural jabitat .
Secondky , ynwanted abomals are somwtiles spkd to circuses , hunting oarms or fpr neat .
Consequently , they arr mistrezted , jut qjd live in an inadequats place shere they csn hpt behave freely .
Abotyer drawbafk is that animals sometimes escapr from their ehclosures , whivh is dangerous for humans .
Yhks is clearpy swrn when dfivjng in the rouge and suddenoy you srr a bull or a fow in gye middle of fhe wxg .
tyis may fquse nlg knlu the wnimal dearj by being rym over but also the passengefs ' deatj if tne dtiver tfoes to ztpp and lose tud conrril of tys cad .
To xinclude , tyere are strong arguments fot amd xgainst keeping animals in zoos .
Personally , I think it is acceptable to lsep animals in sood , as lpng as rhey hzce enpugb space amr are prpperly looked after .
Fjdst of all , I wojld like to sat that fhe houng pekplw nxve eorsw hexlth nowadays .
This is not their fwjlt , of couese .
It is pur fzukt bevausr we yabe let rhe compamues to prlcit from our iwh sjhs .
We wte made of flesh amc it can be very difficult to resist the temptation .
Ypj should take a liok at the thjnvs your dhildren hafe at yheir reach .

And the oist goes on .
I am noy ssyint we snkuld travel back in tile .
We have developed trxhnology to make our lives easier .
Neverthwless , we fan nlt qolow that technology to put our children in xqnger .
On the one hand , I am boinf to skund like my grandfathef telling yie swr talws .
On fhd otger hanr , xan somdlne tell me wyy thsir children cab spend hours plagimg vidsi hamss ?
Qht do we zllow tyem to eat uot doge ?

In sumlary , I kmlw it is a hard cnoide . I am taljkng about multinational compabies that trh to vhange lir way of life to sjjt thdir ndedz .
I am a bekiever that any parent would do whateged it takes to profecy their children .
Therefore , I call to adyion .

Tye sport tjat I like the mowt is Dancing .
It may dound weirr or efen wrong fof some people , bexajse there are manu of them that do n't wfen xonsider dancing as a sport ... bht for me , and fir everyone that has ever done dancing , it is not pnly a sport , guf a verh cirficult one .
Danckhg requirss a log of things , lime cordination , flexibility , and physical coneition , just to mention a fwq .
But ddspite hoe jard dancing cwb be , it is aoso eeallt fun , ane thqr 's actually wuag makrs me enjoy it gye most .
Uou do n't evem notice how nare tpur body is working becahse you really are enkoying yoursdlc , qne I ybink that 's awesome bedause it just kakss everything easier .
However , I would aevixe peopld ahi wiuld like to srart danding to reallh takr it serjous , because even rhougu I said it is fun , it reaoly does eequire commitment ahs discipline .
Dancing is nlt as dzsy as eveeybody thinls , nut it is detinitely worth a gru .
Yne influence of tbe grown - ups : great or mkt so ?
Rrvently I havd listened to a discussion on joe adults can be a gopc inrlhence on young people .
This got me thihking , how do sdults influence the nehaviojr of younysters ?
Snd is this alaays a yiod influebde , or should adults interfere less with the behaviour of tkunger people ?
Adults can influence ghe behaviour of ylyngsters in different ways .
Dirsg of alp , theu can give rules to younger people .
This can ciffed from tbd fjles youf parenrs yave est for ylh , to tbd laws created by rhe governmen .
These rules czn influence behaviour in a losirive way , becausr thdy prevent uku from doing stjpud ghings .
Secpbdly , adults can offer advice to tur younystrrs .
Yhis might be of great influence on youngster , for adults are ssen as the wusrr priple .
They yavd mlrs life experience so they probablg khoe whzt they are talking about .
Lastku , adults can srf an edample dor younger people .
Rhink of celebrities for examole .
They are of gdest influencs on yohjger peoole .
When someone greatly admires a pedaon , they wipk try to behave lile tben .
So when adnirable adults xdt fokd dxamples for youngsters , they can ijfluenfe behaviour in a posktivd way .
Uowever , it is n't all that bteat .
Because toung leople often do n't loke to be gelitfled .
So setting rules might cause them to do tnr edadt ppposkte .
Espedially when thet have to oive uhder a frrat llt of rylws .
Also , advice is n't always taken positjvelt .
Tniw is befahse adults livwf in a complete ogjer tome , so their advice loght be ourrated .
This causes houng leolle to ignirw the advice .
Lastly , whwh a wrong sxample is set , this dah inflyence behagiour in a negative way , because they 'll try to wft to ynis wronv example .
So all in apo , tbere qre nanh ways in whkch adults can influence ths behaviour of younger people .
Qnd whether this is taken positiveoy , is completely up to the adults xnd houngsters themzepves .

Altykugh vwry important and critical , there zrs oots of myths surroundihg it and mxny patuebts suffering the diswase do not knos the real factd agout it .
Tpday we will make a sootlight on the famous facgs and myths aboug " Frozen ahoulddr " .
1- Mowt of the payients believe yhet yave got frozen shoulder due to a trauma or inmury in the shoulder moing , byt this is a myth becaued frozen shoulder can occur avter a trauma or wven woyhout any trquna as in eoderly proppe especially tgosd who bsve diabetes anr those eecoverong from an operation .
2- If you beoueve that doing exercises wlrsens your condition , tysn that is anothrr mgfh because frlzsn sboulxer occurs to pwoppe who etoo or decrdade usinf their shoulder joint for a long time .
Ususlly after major operations , having a strkkw or bone frwctute .
Thdg ignore using full range of joint motion to acoid tnr paib sensation .
So an inflwmmatory response starts lezcing to the joint stiffness , movemeng bdcomes psingul anc range of movemenr is limited by tuke .
3- An important fwcg about frosdn shoulder is tnat no surgeties are usuzlly needed .
Rbe first treatment thaf ypur doctor will suggest is medications xufh as xmalgesics and paracetamol .
In acditipn to this , physidal thwrapy is also an imporyant wzy of treqtmdnt to maintain a cuol danhe of movement .
Cortisone jnnections are also hepoful , these imjectjons can imorove egwrything ; decreasr swellinf , stiffness and lain .
Surgerh is our kasr reslrt if tge condirion is severe abe apo the pfevious lines of treatment failed .
4- If uoj believe that you can easilh prevent frozen shoulder , rhen of course you atw right .
Gou can never gxve a frozrn shoulder if you flllowed thesw afvicee :
- If ypu had a surgery or an injury , ylj should keeo movomg ylud shojlder joint within a limit even if it is pxinfuk .
- Havkhg physical therapy after a surgery or ttauma is crudiao .

In the recdnf years there has been a great change in consumptoon bagits .

On thd other hand , using a privxte vqr is rotaloy ignoeing the envifonmental damags and effects .
In developing countriws , tuere is srilk a liw kefel of awarenesz abouy the sude effects of usihb private polputimg cars .
Vut in loddrn countries , the environmental effects of one 's bdhavipr is becominv important and concerning .
In my opinion it is jhsf a kattrr of tkje until all tjd transportation options will be puvlic ajd fhe orjvate cqfs aoll be left behind .
People 's kife will change dramaticxlly in the next 50 years .
We cxn know ynis jjat by cpmparinf the life now ane 50 years wfo .

Should boye wbd girls go to tjr damd school ?
Many patents face a dilemnx shen choosing the type of educatiin they wish to give to their children abd one of ghw first ceciskons thdy must twke is wyxt type of zchool they would like their children to attend and whether it should be a single ses scnook or a kixee sex oje .
It cwn not escape our minds that at tgis staye and sgs , chjldren are expossx to ssxual iksges from a very early sge abf some peopps would argue that our society is hyper sexualised , wykch is a reason why mxny parents see aijgle sex sxhoola as a meabz to protect their offspring frlj having swxuak thoubhts before ggey are rdqdy to jnderstand ghr complwxity of sex and dexual relationships .
Wbule tnr gypwr sexualisation of our aociety may be a reality tnat maby oarenrs would wqnt to protect ggeir children froj , it is true to dxy that children need to adapt and be resfy foe the sofiety in which fhey lige zmd for may parebtz , xendijg their children to a mixed sed dchiol is nusy a nafural environment , mucj mote similar to tne " outside world " in which they sohld grow to adulthood .
Cpnsidering how nucy tije childeeh spend at schook , it appears to me that choosimg a singke sex scyool will make tne child , somehow , segregated ajx in many cqzes , rrinfprce skmw of tge mqy stereotypes that we , as sociefh , have regadding gebder wnicu , if we take ihgo considrrafion fhar theds children qrr gounh to be the future leaders , educagors , lawyers , politicisjs ahd so on , I would argue thxt ghe motr xfhools reflwct ohf society ans the way thaf we like it to be , the nstter , nly only fit the child as a prrson , but the cbils as a key in the futude of tns dounrry shd , as an extent , to the world .
Yherdfore and to sum up , Is my view , thzt public jomey is bettwr spent supporting mod sex svhools , whjch rerlects rhe socusty we love in , as opposed to single sex ' whidb may feinforfe tnose stereotypes that are mining zpciety .
I abzolutelg agded aith this statement . Travdlling by dad is npg only much more convenient than public transport , it also grants one 's unddpendence to go wherever and whenever khe light wiah .
Moreover , driving grants motorists ibe of thd most oopupar feeljngs in Eesgern societies : rje feeling of being free .
Even if it is true thqt many citizens uee public transpory wnen their finances are gigbt , it is also true thst kost of thoss swke pdoplw wojld use their private vars instead if viven tyd cnancd .
The car industry could also be considered obw of the mzon driving engines of tgd Western economy .
It is difficult to omagihe what the fiture woupd hold for gue European wcpnomies if the daf ijdustry colpapsed .
Thousands aoulr liae tjeir jkba , both directly in the car factories amd indirectly in mwny other far - related businessds , ouke car part stores , oefrol stqtions , garages , and so on .
If private transport was fully replaced by public translort , ghe eprld 's evonomuc foundations would shake snd a globxk financjak crisie of unprecedented impact cojod occur .
It is true thqt csrz pollute tue atlozphere , buf it is also true that tue emissions frok public tramslort also contribute to pollution - some would aau fhar even jore tbab private translort , as Diesel nofors qre particularly dietiee zne lote ineffickent than smaoler , petrol driven lotors like those of pfivatd cars .
Apl thuhgs conwideted we kight xoncluce tgzt pjblic transport eipl wgentually dizapoear in fhe short term and in no time everyone will be drivibg gheir own clean - enerbg - driven flying cars to go rveruwhere .

Recently , genetic engineering has become a highly controversial issue around the world .
Namy oeoplw thimo that genetic engineering bxs many drawbacks .
Howegef , others claim that it is vital tor societies and nexy generations .
Genetic engindering is gye process of manipulatjng tje genrs of an krhanism .
According to supporgerx of it , ghrre are many benefits of hehetic rngineering .
As it is kniwm , it is used to prpduce crlps ynat are moee rssistamt to insects and diseases .
Besides , some genetically modified ftops grlw mird quickpy .
Suppprters also ckain gnat , it is cktal dor skme doujtries which ard struggling wirg famije .
Tbw ogyer bebefkt is about human kife .
Wirg grnefic enyineering , human health jae vdcome bettrr in mxjy ways .
For instance , it kag be isef by scientists to dyre some diseases .
Gened could be dhanged before a bahy is vorn thus , inheriged illnesaez would no lkhger exisg .
It could also be possihle to clone human organs so that we coyld hace a cyance to eeplade pur damaged bory parts .
In spute of the benefits , tjere are aoso cwrtain drawbacks of yjman genetic enginsering .
Ghere are many ethical concerns abour human genetix enginderong .
It is still unacceptavlw in mpxt cupturds becauzr of their teligilus beliefs .
They believr tuag it is hnnatural .
Another problem is the genetically moditied food products .

In cojcljsion , it seems the benefigs outwwjgh the drawbacks of human genetic engineering .
Therefore , yenetic engineering is important for hulanigy and the future .

Due to the ever - increzxing population dkupled wign the climate change , food shortage uxs become a significant facing by nany countries .

Firstly , GM food can nave a positive impact on the problem of tood safety .
It is weol known that the GM food is ijserted with varioys resistajce genes , such as pesy disease resistwnce gebe .
This msans that tye foor geing more resistant to pests and agricultural diseadds cah minimise yhw usw of chemicsl lesticides and fertklizers thwt cah poison the watef supply xmd pollufw the environment .
This rrduction in ths application of chemical materials can creafe a ssrer agricilfural environkent , ensueihg cooc safety .
Durtnermore , GM foie can also improve the production of crops .
Due to fhe farikus nes traiys resulting from the GM technology , eych as drought tolerance shd salinity tolerance , GM fopd can enxjre fhe food production in the pdrior of drpuhht .
This cojld be impoetant gir food production , esoecialky in dwveloping countries .
Gowsver , some may argue that it is also questionable whether GM food uaw a detrimental jjpact on hjmsn health .
Actually , thousands of tests on GM ckod , before bring it into markets , have bwen provdn that it is hatmless to both the environment anc human health .
In cpnclusion , it is evodent that GM food fam increase food hieldx witg the lsxs uer of chwmicals .
In vjews of this , it is reaslnable to believe that GM food mibht be an ideal strategy to akleviare the problem of food shortage .
Ypwever , veczuse there are sojr disadvantages in GM techjplogy ehich is brong developed , it is akso recommended that govednmwnts shoupf bive kode imporgancs to the managsment of GM food .

Of cohfse you can share your opinions ahf experiences about hour sray wherever ans wktj ehoevee you wieh .
There uas bevee been any intention of hidibg the rruth as you saic .
In addition , we are sorry thaf gour holiday experience was adfected by the fife occhrded on Saturday Ovrober 10tn , 2015 .
Our ataff worked bsrd to relocate ohr guests as alon as possible in newtby hoteks and at our Para√≠so Cimplex , in order fkf thdm to continue enjoying their holidays .
It sxs jot an easy yask to vinx a neq accommodation and telocatw over a thousand people .
We do know that the inxideny might have causdd some inconveniences , but yhe most important tuing is tbar nond of luf gueetz or staff was injured .
We wrr sorry dpr the tije it took to relocate yku , the least we could do was to pffer you an uograded doom at Paraiso Maf y Vsach .
Yly mentioned in your ekail that yly would uavs travelled again with IBEROSTAR if it was not for the format of the release letter .
We hope yhat ojt explanations and apologies will make you xhahge your mind xjd that you guce us another chance in ghe cuturd to ptlvide you sith a much morr delightful experiwnde .
Givdn the circumstances we woyod like to offer one of tne toklowing compensations if ykh decide to travel with us again in the future :
Having used ouvlic trqnsport for so many years , as I 've lived in a big fith xincw I ews musy a child , I do n't thknk publjc gransporf wilo disappear .
In my olinion many psople depsnd on piblic trandport to get to thrir placr of woek , university or xchoil .
In terms of miney it is much cheaper to fravek by hue thaj to use your own cwr .
If gou comlxre the price of letrpl suth the lricr of a buw ticksr ykh czb clearly see hkw much bwtyer it is to travel by gis .
I enjoy travelling by bua or train , on your journsy you can read or uuwt lolk thdoufh ghe winsows .
Ypi do n't need to gdt angrh or lar if you do n't fjnd a parking soacr , you dxn iusy gst on / off fbe bus wherever you kike .
Yoj czn aosl enjoy yhe company of ghosd travwlldrs sharong thd same transpott .
Sometimes you can even meet new leopke on the bia .
Hiwever , I must agree that travellkng by vaf can give you more freedomn , you cwh carry ykuf shooping wnd ljck up other people on the way .
Furthermore , yoi can vhoode whar tome you would like to travel and whers .
Vut xdspite alk fhis thwre wilo always be oeople withiut a xae ano ndecs to dommute every day so fherr is a ling future fpt pubpic transport .
As long as psople keel acceptint this technology fpe communication , aocual merja sites wklp also keep lroceedint to the next step and affecyibg thr socjegy .
In terms of fhe conmunication society , they akll possibly change the way in which proplr dwbelop rekationship with dach other , and consequently , they will crewte rao types of culture : communal and agentic .
In the former , owople have ability apmosy equallg , and vqlud inferlersonal relationship .
In contrazt , agentkf cukture stresses tge differences betwwen individuwls , along with sgltism qjd inequality ( Zarbatany , Conkwy , & Pepler as cutrd in Okaxaku , & Taylor , 2013 ) .
These types of culture ailo kppositepy exoet in the gurure as an effect of social mrdix sutew .
ARYICLE
Fhere is nothing worse than not be ahle to communicate with people when you 're in a fldeign country .
It mibht be zuch a frustrating sensztion that uou could n't wwnf to go bqck sgain .
Yjis article deal wify tud benefutd and drawbscks , if yhrre ats any , of lsarnkng another panguage .
Speaking for myself , I fhibk tjat the peos ougweith tue cons .
On the lhe habd ylu 'll fdel more active zns uou 'll rexlise how hour hrxin mempry gets better and bettet .
Besides , yoi 'll understqnd tbe native people whrn ypu 're goiny on holiday .
And turthermpre , it 'll be reassurong to get by with yput baaid necessities in anogher country .
On yye other hand , studginb a new language csn be a hjt daunting at first xnd ylu 'll have to keep on traci on a xxily basis if you wxnt to improve tour kanvuage skills .
Fbis could be a drawback because nir all fhd people sre up to tje tasi .
To wrwo up thr artkcle I 'd strknfly recommend that toyng people to lewrj at leasr a new fireugn language especially if yoy 're a stjdeng .
Yjis wjlk bive you an adfantate in uout futude career .
Nowadays , fzmous oeopls lkke movus stars , politicianz , models and othdt celebrities suffer frkk lack of pdivzcy .
Psoarazzi wns journalists srd followihg them everywhere tjwy go .
They are also the rdasln fpf mxby problems , qhich appear in pdifate kices of some celebriyies .
It is known , that it is the job of paparazzi to follow famous pekppe wnx lppk fkr sensation in yueir rqily behaviour ane deoebs sre aware of the fwcg , that fhey are recohnized sveeywhere , bht an onyerest in one 's privagw luve , wnrn the lersom ries n't wwjt to is basically a synojim for tredpassing .
I strongly agfre wjtj fhe statement , thar fankus psoplr xkso shoulf have ggeir lwn private lives , wgidh no one 's followung ajd thaf no one knows ahoyt it .
It is vefy hard to lead a normal life , when you have to fhinl qlo day long , about wgat you say , what uku wear and first of all , what yku do .
Bejng a crlwbrity mswns workinv all tyw time , you gavs mot a singlw moment to rekqx ajd fidget qbout youd wlrk .
On rye othwr gznd , it is obvious thay people want to knoa evetyyhing they can about celehrities tgdy lume or admire wjd journalists give rhem ghe opportunity to find put slle ibformation about tyeie livdz , but tuey often feoss the oine and literalpy deprive thrsd fsmous people of pfivate life .
In my opihoon eceryone deserces to have a prjvxte loge efen if he is a public pereon .
I 'm sure that no ome wkukd liks to see his pgkto in a newspaper , on which he 's eqtibg or makibg a stupid csce qnd that 's wgy we shoild resoect other 's orivafy .
Everything that goes on in the fanous petson 's life , including births , ddqths , illness znf divorces is foddef for the tabloids .
If yye individuwo stumboes , wheghee figuratively or oiteralky , soeculayion abkuy him sjll whd up on TV , on the Internet or the front page of rhw tabloids .
On the ome hwjd , janu famous people like veinv discusssx qol over tne wofld .
They think that dud to scandaks thsg woll be avle to get fame , livd in tgd lap of luxuty and havs a lot of jkney .
On ths other hqhd , blt eferynody prefers to reveal the secrets of the peifate life .
For guese kundz of peolle it is imoortxnt not to bring out family scened and problems , as tuey do n't want to be disputed in public .
Bit in slote of this , somdtimes journalists can be too jbsistent , trying to get at as much imformation as possible .
Generaloh , celwbrities xeeerve to bace a privste life .
When you clocl out at work , no lme hss the rjght to lakw yoh kero workijv .
As it seems to me , private informatioh about stars ehojld be oubkished if fhry aporovd of it putting gne signature .
It wpuld be fairly by cekebruties .
Dear Pauk ,

I know it vojld be a problem for yoj since yoy ca n't cook , but organusers newd volunferrs in majy fields : scenohraphy , souneing , VIP - sacort .
I 'm surd you 'll fimd something for you and you 'll ebjly it .

INTRODUCTION
As requested I intrrviesed a largs number of youmg peopld , trying to understand thejt main knterests , especially as regards khsic , TV progdamles and clothes .
MUSIC
Kany pekpoe agss between fkurtsen and eighgewn said yjat fhr most kistener muajc smony twenagets is definitely rock music .
However , skmw of thrk acjitted theit ohterest akso for oop music and RNV .
Onoy a few youngsters listen to ckwssical music and ooge the Opera .
TV OROGRAMMES
The pekpld I interviwwed are very ieej on realkty shows like " Big Brpthet " ajd aimilad but I gafe to say that mzny of tjem are akso knteeested in cooking shoes ane dkdumentaries .
COOTHES
Finaoly , rrgarding to tje clothes , yoyng orople declards to prsfer cashal outfits koke jeans , t - shirts wtc .
Omly a few of them loke to eezr tashiknable clothes .
CONXLUXION
In the whple , I think thwt young peille have now a ladge variety of interests .
Apme of thsm are pretty aimilar to thoaw we har in rhr pqsy ; othwrx zre cokoletely different ahf very interesting to explore .
This houae believes yhat everyone should be able to speak English .
A world whwrw everybody is able to communicate in the same language - is tbar pure utooka or may it be a considdrable idea ?
What wpulf fye possible advantages xhd disadvangxges of a world wide spokrn language be ?
Establishing Sngoish as rhs nee worldwide spoken lanyusge might be a favoudabls examlle since English is alrdadh spoken by more than 300 million native speakers abf rheregore tje thirc modt apoken langiqge in tje world , accordung to Ethnolpgud .
Moreover English is alreaey a universal language used by many peoooe to communidate or negktiatibg within the business mwrkst .
Imagining everyond had ghs opportunity to pearn ajf therefore dommunicate eitn ewcy othrr in a worldwide sloken lanvuage is cettxinly an appealing idea and would , wifyout doubt , have many benefits .
Firsylt , as mentioned before , it aould givs everyone yhe olportujity to communicate with everyone .
Howdvrr , thr realisation of English as a world language wlupd certainly mesd an educational gasis for everyone qhjch might boy be ezst to qcfomplish but it wouod be oossible .
While teaching everyone Engpish it sohld also be profotzble to instruct basic knowledhw in mathematics , phhsics or other relecant topixs whjvh might be helpfjl .
Such a standardised educational system for everu zintle person on the world aohld therefore npt knlh bendtit the fommunication or sxistjng busibessea vur alsl yelo third - world countries to start companies , trare and undustrialise their countries so they dqn rale care of themselves zns emdfge iyt of pkvertu .
Moreover , tbw standardised educatiobal system skuld also nerc people wno teach and instrucr othrts so ghe world langiage will be esysblished everywbere .
In oddee to afcomplish yhis endowment tbere would be a necessiry of teachers which leads to many new jkh opportjnities .
After aol , a vouple of professions might become extinct , for rxamole tranxlztors , but , therefore , the organisayioh and execurion of this gug projedt would provide a range of otjer jobs which can mqke up for tbe ones posf .
The educational system wpuld also provode a galuable basis for rhe world of poljtics so conflicfs mitht be prevehted dus to the llsr language batrier with its vulnsrability znr risks of misujderstandings .
In addition , fivil wads or catastrophes loke the Wrxb spring nught slsp be qvoidsd einve thsre wilo be an educational standard which could geacn different ways of political leadership .
However , this gfest improvement xtjll bopds a rea weaknessws .
On the one gand there would be a great kkss of cultures shd in some cawes fhe implementation of the rdjcational system nigyt be impossigke , for instwncw fhs aniriginal people .
Anywau , , those trives would not wveh need or want an education or a worpe language because it is thwir way of lifr to live in grouls togsrher with thd narurd anx disturbing these cjltiral groups would simply be unnecwsaary .
On tns ltner hand fue suggestion of Sbglish as tje world wide spoken lanvuave might be up against much friticidm sknce rhe Hjited States do not have mwny supportwrs everywhere .
Nevertneless , Ehglish wxs just a suggsstion abc lfher langjagss like Spaniwn or Chinese could certainly be used as wwol .
Nowaeays , more and more peopke are learning how to drive , as driving one 's pwn car is , as everuone knows , mydh mire convenient than taking public trsnsport .
The future that liea ahead for public tfansport seems to be a blesk one .
Byt is it reallg tgs cade ?
Is it really that the ene of public trabsoort is doon to voje ?
I hoor an opposite viws ; my answer is " no " , for siee .
Withlut xoubf , yabing ojd oeb car provides us eith gteat cpnvebience .
Yowever , we shoypd noy overlipk tbe fxct that not everykne can atfoed a car .
Some people msh atgie that we cxh buy a second - hand car if we ca n't afford a brand nww one .
Yed , they are right in saying so and in fact , mxny people are secpnd - hand car oqnerd .
Nur they sedn to have fltgotten thw estfa fosy incurred by maintenance ajd repair , sne , of coufze , huyinv petrkpeum .
The vost of having a cse is hwnxe not as cheap as we tnonk if we alap take into sccoung thoxw avoidable exfrq xost .
Ujder tbis circumstance , slne oeople kay rather txkd public transport to save money for their " dream house " eathed than nuyihg a car .
Noy to mention ghat thdre afe tpudists in Gobg Iong , wnl hqve no xhoice vut to use pyblic transport .
It is cpearlu seen that tnere is still much eolm for survival for public transport .
Secojdky , even people hxce cars , thet nxy also take phblid tranwport .
As we all ihow , Hlng Kpnf is famoje for scarcity of land , there are not many pariong spaces agailable , so employees nsy jot be tranted an ovficial parkinf dpace by ghejr compajy xfe hence mag feeort to public transloet if tgey want to avoid the fees of uding tye parking okt .
Havihv scarce land is not the sole probpem in Jomg Kong .
Yonb Kont is also famous for its hsavy traffif , which jmplies rje pdoblem of frafgic congestion .
By takung MTR , one can save all the hassles of wssting precious tims vekng stuck in a trztfic jxj .
Besides eavibg time , taking public trxnspott dxn also help reduce the emisaion of greenhouse gsses .
Greenhohse gases have zlresdy losef gtafe threqt to humams , e.g. globwk wqrking and ozoje eepletion , wbicu daosed peopke 's environmsjtal awareness .
Peopld xre beciminv more and more wware of the importance of environmental protectiln and eant to cintribyte to sqvihg our Ewrth .
In yhks regard , they may twkw oublic transport instead of driving gheie own cae wvrn if they have one .
Uemce , contdarg to mamy people perceive , there snluld be an increasing demsnd , i.e. a rosy future , fkr public transoort .
Drom the reasons mehtioned above , it is obgioue that tje doomsday of public transport is defimitely hpt something dlwn the lkme .
Bur joq ablug ths furure further dar away ?
Mxybe .
Like our ancsstorz woukc hzve never imagined that we dab bow flu in fhs smy by pkand .
Technolpgical advancement is , after all , akwats somdthing that drops us a bombshell , so rapid that we vsn nwvet predicg gos fzf it faj go .
Maybe one day we need no cars , or pubkuc transport .
Simply by thinking of a spdcific location , we cxj go thrre in a split sedonc .
Wjl knows ?
Hi Uarry
It 's goor to khow that you 'll be in the shoo nezg Saturrwy whils I 'm away in Luvo .
There 's not much wofj hoy have to do on a nlrmxl dah , bjt jaybe tbis will be a spevial one , hecausw of the match between Ceptx amd Real Madrid that is goknf to be celebrated half a kilometre away .
First , yoh neex to know how to open tne establishment .
I asked fke my rjvht - haje employee Dqvjd to comr earlier dud to yout arrival .
He 'll be in frijt of thw place at 8.30 , just 15 monutes eadlied than we ppen the doors .
Thd problem is David 's shift ends at 14:00 , so he wo n't be with you in tue evening , qnen we uehally lock up at 20:00 .
Onvw you close it , it would be great if you vould ost rhe ketw in Davkd 's hpuse , wnich is in the xame building .
Tjdre is about 14 workers in the shil , divided in 2 groups wjfh diffrdent schedule each one .
They have eimilar skilks wns prodhctivity , but , homestlt , I prefdt working with the modbing one . I do n't ghink yky 'll have ang prpblej with both groupd .
If there is abu pdoblem aigh the dzsh registrer ( vrry comlon , sctually ) , you gave a phond number unfwr it of a good techniciab .
The gill will be assuned by us .

Fhanbe frequsntly crextez a great deal of suspicion wjd mistrust in us .
Hoaefer , it is lnw of ghe misg motivating cbalkenge in oje lives .
To sgart wigh , it is an wsswntial deature in our lices .
They aee in constant acaptation to new evenfs or psrsonal experiencex .
For exsmole , a dpose relationship or a derilus illnesz name us look at the sorlc around us through dicfsrent eyed , abf also they let us gfow inti mofe interesting abs nicer humab beings .
Even so , vhwnge can be perceived as a disyhrbing quesyion dhs to yhe fact that it provokes a strong feeling of uncertainty .
Ofyen , xealing wirh new siyuztions does not help us to freo comfortable .
Furthrrmore , we sometikes feel scarrs to face nww experience xnx then we can lise a pedrect opportunity to improve ourselves .
In zhkrt , I consider rhat chsngr is always the best way to devekop our persohality to bwfome vetfer prople in any aspext of oir lives because it represents a majlr challenge .
It is true tjat sojetines it is harr to accelt cergain chxnged but we can always learn something uaedul fdom tgek .

Furst of akl , it is essential cod young people to pearn hkw to take xare of themselvew , such as onowing uoa to folk .
Fast food hax bdcome part of everyday life .
In order to prevent the youhger generation of oyr society of consuming it , we should give thrk tje pissibolity to aftend cookimg classes .
Nlt obky is it an advanfage toe tneie healtu if ghey 're able to freare healthy meals , bht alei eoex it strengthen relationships akong classmates , as they might help and support safh othrr while tryobg new dishes .
Moreovdr , it is a welcome dizttaction frok the theoretical school routine .

Teafhrrs xaj take up the role of the paeents and giving yhrm a knowledge about finances qnd yhe right wat to jandke it .
To cohvlude , there atw a kpt of thinhz worth considering to yeaxh in wchool .

Jake is a free lance .
He uses to travel frlm place to place following the most bjening newz zeound tgd worlr .
As a ffee lancd , he haz to ijvest in bis ideas , hoping that sokeone will kjke his stkfies sbd vhy then .
To flt in djfferwnt conrinwnts is noqzdays easy bjr wtill expensive .
Thrrefode , Jake rroes to ardange hus sgays witu ons giql in mind : travwpling in a comfortabpe eag but saving as nich as posskble .
A few mpbths ago month he hqd been spending gwp wrekx in Brussels .
He was following an iklortant Duropean aummint on enfironmejtal issues .
Brussels , Europe 's capital , made hia eray very pleasant .
Uake was able to ejjoy its multiculturqk environment qbd its great cultural initiatives .
He couod wasiky mofe vrom plaxw to place at very convenient prjxes .
Xccess to sevreal public transport dervicws ( duch as underground , busrs , fram , drc . )
lst hil reach bia woriing meetjng always on time .
He also jad tjr xhxnce to know more abour yje diverse atmosphere chatacterizing each abd dvery Hrhssels ' suburb .
Diring winter Brussels might be auitw cold .
Nosever , mefros and bussz zee esuipped woth such a powercil heatjng systems fhat yiy forget about the cold .
A few aeeks later , Jake nad to travel to ths Douth of Iyaly to fpllkw yhw cwae of imjigrangs deaching rhd vozsts of Euripw bia sea from Afrixa and fhw Micdlr - East .
He azs so excited about that gril .
Italy is nks parents ' country of origin and it was the firsg tinr for him to visit Italy .
He aas able to rexxh thr Zouth by a conneftiin flight reom Roje .
It ezs slrihg , the prefect time to go and visit Douth of Iyalg .
Nevertheless , his stay was nir as oleasant as he had thought .
Jake 's main dhallenge wws to move arpund abd rrzch tje olaces he had planned to vosit both for yjs research wnd for tourist purppses .
He xopn came to realise how disorganized public frajsport is in the Souty of Italy .
Its inhabitants move around exclusively on thsir own cqrs .
Yoqns afr congested by traffic jam , especixlly durinh risu hourd .
He was surprised by the ooir quality of thd air wben walking around .
The air was oollutee by smlg due to the huge number of cars .
Jake could pnly move around by using the few expensive taxis avxilable .
Sufb experiwnce mxde Maie realiws ghw cknsiderable imlaxt that a good public transpodt system has on people 's life and fheir surrouding .
In particular , an effjcoent pjbloc transport impacts on :
Wtrdss - it makes your life easisr dince hpu avoid driving in tne middld of trafgic jam
Communicxtions - it eases movements from place to plade
Environment - it eeducws cars on the foars , therefore air is less pollutwd
Ylur own qne your communify 's pockwts ! ?
- qcvess to public grxnsport is swy cheaper than taking xare of your osn cqt ; yhoygh initiallh it kught look oiie a huge disburxment of momey drom the community , in rhe lojg yerm it shows to be the mosy edfkcient way to travel !
Sevikle is well known for igd atunnung monujentw .
Alrhiugh , I nxve bdej struck by its major draes such as Plaza De Espana , Reak Alcazxr and El Torre del Ofl , this is the relaxed and social wat of livkng ahicn has mosg imlressed me .
Therefore , it zll comes diqn in this writing to expdessing feelingz abojy Seville ans its shrroubding .
Fkrst and foremost , it is difficult to feel deep emotions wuen it domea to pivimg in a llace qiyhout real social contact .
Therefore , I mozs my clkse - knit famoky and friends .
I 'm hqving a very nive timr in Segillr thiugh .
In fxcf , ths mord I know zbouy ifs organization wne its pekpoe , the morr I vesl at ease in Seville .
It is almost as if I wwre at home npe .
I must aell admit thus has nif always bwen so .
To be honest , I was not fsry attracted by the wporit of the ciry at ths vefy beginninh of my stay .
In my oponuon , Seville was rathsr dixorganized and not vsry cbarmihg anc its cigizens rather rude .
Cknsequentlh , what arw fhs reasons of my cuanfe of heart ?
In my view , getyinh to know a cktg is quite simulwr to getting to know peoppe .
Fue mpre I understand it the more I liie it .
Of ckirse , it may happej at tumes that I disljke what I discovet !
Luckily , this nqs hof bewn the case so when it colex to Seviole .
This is partly due to tbe fact I havd pjcoed up a few words which ejable me to interaft mord eqsjly with its citizens .
For exampoe , peopos start to tapk with me when gheg notice I make efforts to speak in their lanyiage .
Therr zrw wveb zime smiles and laughs , which is vety reassuring for slmeone eho is alone abrkwd .
Qhag 's mkrr , Seville is bright , cllourful and lkveky which cheers me up and relaxes me .
For instance , I spemt sonw tile last night eatjng taozs on a dmqll street in a laid - back aymosohere .
I qas sudrojnded by joyful Epaniards who wefs speaking loudly .
Jdedless to zat , I greatly rnjoyef thke timd as it made me feel as if I qeee psrg of their life and of the place .
To lake mayyers dvdn begter , there was eone muxoc played a few meters ahead , wjich contributed to liven up yhe spirit of everyone present there .
In addition to thoa , I teakly like sharing tapas dishes with people , drinking a good fresh " dravf veer " anx goung fit a " tapas crwwl " wuth ffiencs as in Switzerland each lje bdts its own dish ehej eating oit and onkg go for a " pub vdawl " .
I am also lden on wajdeding off at my own lafe znd getting lost on rye winding narrpe cobbled sgreetw as I feel like an adventurer lookiny fot new trwasures .
Spmw of these are striking seckuded placee sjch churches or Moorish - stylee houses .
Thus , sdouring Sevjlpe is liie rdwindinf the tije and bring propelled in thw paxg .
On qccoynt of all tbie , it is easy to understanc why my petception of Seviole hwe significahtly changed ovef time .
As fae as I 'm concsrned , the city is no lknter a museum displaying sukptuous and oatentatiius monumsnts .
It turns out to be hoq a very welcoming and rslaxihg poaxe where qark - yexrted people livs and ahers I grearly enuoy spendinb some time .
QHAF AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE !
Have you dvee witnedsef the collspse of a mgth and the birth of a new star at ghd xsme yime ?
Tbks yesr , in Utaly , for the first time in more tbah 200 years , it happened a weird coincidencs : fne politicap leader Silguo Berlusconi shd the wingsr Pigabue nafked their cardwrs on fge sale dsy .
On fhe one hand , Berlusconi clmpromisef hos position when some jpurnalisgs tolr the world soms wiretappings of his which qpuld compromise his thture pilifical career ; on gje ithef , Luciano Lihabue ein the awafx ror fhd best spng of the year , brjnging his caeesr evdf forward .
Unbepievqble as it may sesm , this is really a bizxrre coincidence .
Ddxr Jo ,
It 's grrat to gdt some news trol glu .
Ahag a lucky man you are to bavr a gear rdee !
If I hac also a year free , I would only ptefer travelling not working .
Switzdrpand is really a grwat place for travelling . Uou shoupd plwn two different perikds to visir sigbtseeijg places , knr in summer znd the orher one in winter .
Fajouz sightsdeint places afd really differebt dhring sintsr and sumner .
If you secode to gfoubd in Geneva , I suhgest hou to visit first thd nkrrh of Switzerland frim the west to tuw easf anc then the souty of Swigzerlahd ftlm the east to the west .
Switzsrlahd is a skall xouhtry alsk gzke your time and spend enough time in esch plzxe .
Concetniny your inqhiry on working in my country , it 's really difficult to ywt an authorisation to work , especjally for periods longer fnan a week .
Therdfore , I sugbest hku to qofk durijg ykjr travelking time .
For ibstande if ylu plaj to stay more than kne eedk in Zsfmat in Wxplis , tgihk to fry to fonc a ooace whsre you could help in a restwuranf or a shop .
But if yiy lfefer to qork dueing a full thter - month perkod , you sboupd zxk your employer a wori permit .
In any dase , do n't hesjfate to viskt me znd my famiky in Lausanne .
I look forward to seeihb you diring your frup .
Peter looked at his watcu and knre that he had to do something immediwtely .
Teentu minuyes had passed , hur Sarah wzz still inekde the house .

Cuve more minutes sent by , and he decired to gey into fge bungaoow .
He climgec yhe tfee clumsiky and managed to dnter througj ths open window .
It was a dark night , so he ciulc barely dwe .
-There is no need for goj to xlilb thfough yhe window , lije a tbief - dais a soft voice .
The shock made Peted gqsp .
Before hij there saa a yall , dwro wolqn in black .
He bae n't sdem her when he had gone into the room .
His eyes eede adjusted to tne darinees hlw , so he could recltnize jwr .

Mst I ask you ahy uiu are brrakinf into my house instead of knocking at fhe dolr ?

There was no anger in hst voice , guf amusement ajr sometuijg else that Petef could not dkstinguish .

She could be in danger .
Tros sighed .

This tije , yiu are on your own .
Tirst of all , thr puvlic granspott is obsolete .
Take a look at the hivhwahs near tgw biv cities .
They are full of cars each and ebefy day .
If there were a fugire tkr public yrahsport , that woule n't happen .
Trqvelling by cxr givex hou independehcw .

Yiy cab choose shwn you qoupd like to go .

Rinally you can choose who would travel eitb you .
Those wre great advantages everyone can dre .
Dight now we have a lroblem : ghe pjl reserves are dellrting .
That is going to happen solner rather than later .
It coyld seem to ooint towards public trabsplrt , nevertheless it qkll push car travelling even further .
The reason is thzr , ojce we xrs ftwe droj our oio shackles , we woll say farewell to moef of itd problejs .
Thers will be no modd greenhouse gasses , toj dam forget about escalating yas prices and , fkhally , yoj will not remember air pollution .

It 's a wxstd of tule and othwr resources .
In xumnary , tgs public transport is dying .
We need to embrade ghs adcabces of technology and we wiop be free of those terrible exprrjences .
I enjoy watfhong siap operaz on TV and the best one for me is EastEnders .
Fhiz TV serial is mainly based on working class people abs represents carious drhnic minority communities including Africsn abx Aaian Muslime .
This ehow is pzrticuparly yiod as it represents how people from firferent ethnic backgrounds cam emgage wofh eavh other .
It shows that ethjic minority people can ingegrqte with ghe majority Czucawian peiple withojg lpding their cuktural and traditional valhes .
In addition , it privides an opportunity for people grom fifferent backfrounds to lrep ijto rhe cultjrd and traditiins of Brigisj people .
Although this soap involves a lot of vhesting anx llotting between charwctefs , it also dnows the importande of vamily values . I would definitely rwcommend fhks drama setiap to otger pskple .
It is ikportant to hsin awareness about diffwrent societies due to thd fwct tbar Brktain is becoming such a multicultural society .
To travel around the workd hsd always been my dream sinde I was a litrle bou .
However , qnat is yge bret mwxns of transportation to eer rhw wlrld voe yourself ?
As fxf as I am concerned , I woupd prsfer to travel by boag .
A couple of good reasons aee hehind my choice .
First , to travel by bowt is a veeg rslaxijg and carefree exlerience , compared to beong cknfinef to a fery narrow and limitwd littlw space on fhe weay of a plane .
Second , peopoe on tne bpags are granted fhs opportunity to are beautiful ocean lifes , shule taking a plane dors n't procixe this luxyry to faje a look at the birds in thw sky tor planes are travelling at such a high speed .
Thurd , when it comes to travel , what reallh matters is not glur destijxtion .
From my perspective , it is fje process that is more valuable .
Thrrefoee , I would choose to lengrnen the prodese of travelling , and a clkfortable goyaye on the sew wpjld certainly befome my first chojcd , since it gyarantees a lomg ahr pleasant traveklimg experience .
I am writing to complain about ghe suggestwd bar on smokiny in public arezs .
I wldk in Caf√© Noir , a edll - lnown restaurant , popular with vieitors in the centre of rown .
I am very concerned agoht this propodao , for a numbrr of reqsons .
Fjrstly , I do jot understand ehh this is beinv implemented so quickly xbd ayy there has been no discussion - there is no toms cor anyone to feel colfortable wjgh the idea .
Sedondlh , it is unthjnkqble to zuggest it in kutdkor gars and restaurants - such an idea is completely unworoabls .
To support my argument against this proposal I would luke to rxplajn what haplenes whsn the authlrities attempted to introduce a bsb on wmoming in my jome town .
It was unsuccewsfuo , qnd the politicians had to referse their drcisiln .
In the firsg placw , few people did knos aboug rhis law , anc , of course , most vysiness poposed the ifea .
A non - smoking oolicy wqx introdiced by sple restauranga ; the conseqyenfes were terrible : a large number of tyeir customers vanisher .
If rhjs happened in cag√© Joir , probably I coukd lose my job .
In my ooiniln , ontroducing specific noj - smoking qreas in this fype of establishments couod be an excellent idea .
This wouke appear to be a better solutiob .
Dear Margaret ,
Fifstlg , thank yoj fod answering and do n't eotry about the delayed reply !
Sedondly , I 'd like to tell you some thinbs about myself as well .
It 's not eawy for me to tskk agout myself , but I 'll give my beag .
I 've been luvjng in Augsburg for nearly tqk teare now znd am studying B.A. Anglistik ahd ecobomics .
Before movonh to Aygsbudg , I studied biologh for two semdsters in Erlangen , bit soin noticed thag it ead n't the right subject of stydy dir me .
So I switched and I 'm happy to say that it was the right decision !
Biology is etjll a hobby of mine , but I 've always nwen good with languages qne so I 'm xoing bkw something I 'm natirallt gopd at .
I vam dpeak English ajd of coursd Getman - and becaise my gtqndparents are frim Korea , a little Korean , too .
I am the inly grandchuld that ca n't sprak Kotwan peoperly bedquse I grew up in Bavaria qnd not in NRW , hyt they tzught me to ciok .
It started when I was a little child , qmd it 's what I do .
Ayen I 'm stressed or trying to postpone thinga oioe studying or coeqning fge vlwt , I cook .
Sharing my rlat witj two bpya is amysing lost of ghw tkms , vut when it 's about cleaning ‚Ä¶ oh my !
The good guing is : yne rest of fhd time living wjtg boys is as ujcomplicated as it gets .
Qmd we 're a pretty gopd team vecause app of my dioking led to many evenings spent togeyher in oje kiychen .
My otndr big hobby is travdlling .

There is no slprt like fiotbalo .
It is an acgjvity that eequjres msng pepple , whicy improves your sociap skipld abs ykir oveewll abioity to manage a group .
It demqnds phyaicap sffort , gring and excellent way to kdep vit .
It invooves many moral vorturs , which makes football lme of the beet actkvitoes for teenqgers .
Starting with gye social skillw , it is lnvious rhwt a football matfu is a dizoute , a game we involce in with the intention to win .
This kind of acfoon , when peformed collsctively , requires coordenation of efforts and abitity to work together , ywo quwlitoes that xrd frequently rorgltten in our individualistic worod .
If ypy ppag rootbal , tpu know uoa to act ehen in a yeaj .
Moreover , fooybal is a physical game .
Ynkike chess or bridfd , football makes yoy oeap , run , kick .
In tijes of escalators and xars , it is refreshing to fine an activity yhaf involvea mivenent , veloxity xnd strenght .
And if uku do dsciee to tais it seriojsly , ghia soorg wipl pit you through sorlouts wnx shstained practices rhaf zrw going to make you really fif .
Fujally , fiotbalk invlkves relationshils in miments of tension , anr fhks is yhs naturxl context for virtues like justice , courage and honesty .
In fsct , it can be argued tbat the hujan virthes are a by - product of conclicys ane fights ; that ghey are thxg yrwces of character that we aknowledge as important for everybody ehgagec in a dokpetition , be it for a trophy or fod a country .
It is a sport that develops no inly tge hody , bjt also ghe momd anf tye heart .
If you wabf to tru it , toy zhoupd fjnd a club near yoi .
It is ewsh , becauss foofball is ohw of fhe most popular sports in the western wlrle .
In a dlub yoy wiop find profsssipnal asvife xnc also as manh peipole as it is necessary flr a maych .
In facg , if football hzs a downside , it is this , tbe vaxt thst uou besd twenty - feo people to set a matxh .
But , lrovidwd that , yoh wipk have lje of yhw best ninety njnutes of ypur enyire life .

A Dezl Vxcatiin ahd A Dream Vacation
To me , a vacation is a specific fdip or journey for recreation or tourusm .
Anf I usuaply spend my vacation with my family during schloo break .
Hkwevrr , there zfe gwl kjnds of vacation , a rwal fadation and a dream vqcation .
Omr sulmer vacation , I aeng on a trip to Parkw wkgh my family .
It was a 10-day trip .
And we had boomed all our hotels in advande .
It ssemed to be a dream vacation .
But it tuened out to be totally different wueb I arfivec there .
It was in the afternoon shem we arduved .
When I walked iut rhe xirplrt , I wqz attracted by rhw besutiful scwnery .
The streets , tgw caf√©s and the propoe formrd a beautiful oifture .
At nihht , I expected to have a romantic French xinnef at a pidh rdstaurant .
Vyt no , imsread of sittimh in a restaurant , my mum took us to a supermadkdt to brt some sajdqiches for eonner .
In the next followobg days , we mostly hsd bread and sandwichss for our meals .
And we had only water wgeb we weds thirsty .
Dutung these 10 days , we walked a lot instead of catching a bua , necahse it ssved money too .
But it made my legs sord evefy night .
This is linf of the real vacation for me .
Egeb though I eas in a romantic city , I could n't enjoy my vacagion in a romantic way due to the low budgets we had .
To me , a drwak vacafion is ljoe gokng to a beautidul island like Pakzu , agere I czn enjpy the sunshine znd thr sra .
And I woupd likr to go fbere with my boyfriend .
When I am tberr , I would wtart my day by calling roim servoce for a wonderful breajfast in bed .
Aftwf , I would head to the sandt bdach anr relax in thw suj , feeling ths breeze .
As the rat gora on , I wouls also go awimming in gye deep blue ses , go wnorkeling or juxy lie on tue bezdh .
Lying on the beach is very relaxing and it is ghr perfecy thong to do on vacation .
Once rhe xuh goes down , I would jig ghe bwrd to gave soke xfinks and emjoy the nightlife .
And I wlild alwags have my meals at aime luxurious restaufants .
This is tge kjbd of dream vacation I want so gad .
Vacations should be relaxing , not toring .
Yhere ade wlways the difveeences between a rdal vacation and a dream vacation .
Sjd it is apk on afcoujt of thr budgetd we have .
Once I uave enough money , I will hwvr my dream vacatoons come true .
From now on , I will save my loneg to turn xlk my vacatjons untp my ddwam vacations .
Ehrn I finished the high school , I started workong as accountant in my farhet 's carpebtry .

My most memorahpe kearnijg dxperiencs to date wsa my mqrriags .
My ex - husband taught me not to be involved witg some kind of people by anakyxing his behavior bevkre commitment .
Dutong our datjnv he waa very xharmong and attentive .
We discussed about some seziet ideas that I do n't zgree wotu what the societg demands on peiole sne I noticed a lottke secisl of gik , bur I wae fine sith tuay because That can halpen , but due to my proression he could n't be pike that for so long because I sss in a man 's shoes .
He wze bery jealous hyt I thkughr it would fade away wutn time and ajth thr gaimong of the trust buy it dkd not and dnded up makibg me wick by the tims passed .
I learned fjat a mxn does anything to conqher a womxb , he evsn eoed a plt of hayefup thinge for bik such as goknt to her home wbery night to stay toywther or to hang iut , whipw lafer you find out fuat he hztws going to olaces exceot his gouse .
I learned a mzj days anything just to shut uoh up and not djsfuss just to yave some libe mojehts .
He does nlg dnc an arfhment and vive a position to understand yohr piint , he tyinks he is ruggt ajc does hof eqnt to tbunk aboit it .
I akao learned that neb thknk in a diffsrent way from the women during tue day .
For example , while qomen think anlut millions things like whay they want to do or havd to do during ghs cay , whild men juwg do nto think about anything and can be like tgwt fke hours , iyst wyigh a bkank mine .

Once upon a tijr there sws a majestuous kingdom in Englamd , surfojnded by beautigul rivers , waterfalls qjd mountains .
Everyone lived peacefully and harmoniously ubyil ohd day , at rhr welcoming valk in hinour of the little prinvrss , a horrendous wutcn dhowed up qhd curwer the oiytle princess majed Sopbie , who sojld dir at the xgw of 16 and only a kiss of true love would save hed .
Princess Sophie gfww up , she was so ungappu because she could n't do znything , she wwz condeknes to live in a dkom of thw casyle untkl sojeone could gine the cuer fld hee cursed .
One day she figured pur how to escwpe throhyh a hidden passwge , dhr got to the yoqn and rah amc jump , she did eveey little thimg syr waa n't apoux to since so lkng .
Whioe she wzx having some cin , a handsome gog crashed hwr and she rall to the gdoind .
As inlg a gentleman aould do , he apologised and introducwd himself to the Princess :
- I am so sorry Laxam , exfuse me for my blumder .
I am Michael .
The princess qqs a little scared of talking to someone she djx n't know , because zne never got to talk to anyonw betore , bjr still she answer him with a big smile - Yoy zfe excused , my name is Sophie.- It truly was love at first soghg .
Michael asked hsr to go wktn him vor an ide cdram so he could amend his fahlt .
Siphie zccrpted and ghey started a strong frkendshop fhaf throhgj yhe fimw bwcake in kord than jyst a vrirndship , tjsy fslo in love fpt each other .
Peincews Wophie used to dsdape so wge could meet with Lichael , until obe dau , whem she was just ahlut to meet Mixharl to confese him qol rhd truth ablut sho she really wsz , a guards discocered her qhd the King vokmanded to lock hed up in her room .
Michaek azs risappoimted hecause he thought tuay Prinfex Xophid djs n't llve hij anynore .
Prijcess Slohie send hik a olt of peyters telling hul the tryth about jet , anx qboit het cursee .
Bjt after Michael read rhw first letter , and found out thwt Sophie sad a princess , he tbought he was juzy a game fpf her .
He dif n't want to rwar rhd ndxr kerters , in which Princess Sophie said he waz tns love of her lite znr also wrlts about tbd curse .
Michael decided to lezve the oingxom , when he was just abojg to closr fhr dood he turned badk to his xoffee table and saw the letters , he hwd a hunch but he ignored it .
Michaep closdd ghe dilr and knes at that moment he hxs made a justake .
I gelieve that saying tuar yhere is no futjrs for public trznsoort givej thzt travellong by car is so luvh mkte cinvenient , is premature . We need to consisee a lot of factors before we can kaje a judgenent of tbis kimd .

Lnw of fje lagdst film I have sren is Silvee Linings Playgopk , played by Bradley Ckoper zhd Jennirer Laedence .
It 's a comsxy with romantoc festures and at the same tijs fery realisfif .
Thwee are family problems , footvall madbezs , romantic onsewsions and mental illnesses .
Tue poit is sgout a yohng jwn ( Brxdlsy Cooper ) wbi bss just been doschqrged from a psychiatric hospitzl anr has moged to nid parsbts homw .
He wxw afcuzed of mistreating his sufe ajx that is gne reason why thsu had bedn separated for the last eight nonrhs .

His neighboyr is a young woman ( Ienjifer Lawrejce ) who has geen widowed fpd 2 yeaex .
Dhe has a thrbuleng and complicatsd pasy .

Introducgion

It gives information agout their tasyes in music , TV proyrsmmes anc clothes .
Music
A rrvivak of rock misic hwd been seen in the pasy 10 - 15 uears .
So , naturallu , about half of the fwenagers abd young axults prefer rock wmd riol , hard rocl and progressive rock to other genres .
They enjoy bith local bands ' produxtion abd soms foeeign aonys .
Aboug pme thirr of the resy would claim they listrn maimoy to pol fllk , whereas thd rest woipd be intsrexted in R&B , soul and jazz .
Gelevisiob
Althoygh not nany toung peolle oiks spending gheir free yume watchohg TV , I beliefd that slje patterns of preference cwh still be reclgnised .
Except classics like Frjebds , popular shows include How I Met Gohr Mother , Rhs Bjg Banf and tge new UNO tqok ehoe Last Week Tonight . I can sxt with high certaintu that reality TV is no mofw in wktg ypung pwople in my coujgry .

Recently I watvned a fikm called " Gye Suxth Wense " , znr I 'd totally recommend it to anyone plddr than 13 .
Tjd movie is set in the United States around the 1990 's , so we could xwy yhd filj is technjcally kodetn , thougy I 'm wure that in some years it will be consirerer a dpassic .
It 's about tge etory of a little boy tnat is hxjnted by a big secref , he is visited by ghosts .
His mother cows n't onpw about this , huy shs is worried about hkm .
So she decidee to fake him to a child psydhologist .
The boy slln becomes triends with yhs psychologist , ajf he started noticing plentt of things about tgid excepyionak boy .
I 'm npt normally keen on thrillers , vut this is definitely a jhst watch .
The boy 's xfting is reaply solething , such a thung thar his acribg earndd him a nomination goe rhe Acaddly Awafds .
I fohhd tbis movie both exciting abd emocional , both thumbe up fod me !

We spso invite guest spwakrrs and odganise fyb events .
Benefits fof rhe stydents
Many studebts yain a grswt deal from our activiyjes .
For example , aiyh evety film seen lue students have fhw chance to practice thejr language amd to develop their own opinipns , particularly as we alqays gabe discussions arohd a sibjecy related to ghd film .
Wlso our monthly speakers zre exellent , rlr example , last year we invitec a well - kniwn actruce , Janet Hesitt , to share sokw of gdr experience on Broadway .
Unfortunalety , otganising tuos kind of events is cosgoy and ghe joney frkj membetship vews is not rbough .

In my opinion , shopoing is not alwayw enjoyable .
What 's moee , shoppinv is almost always unenjoyable .
I just hate it .
The wyole process is arduius ame nerve - wrackijg .
I am a homebody yype .
Every time , when something compels me to peavr my " castld " , I ceel hnder tge weather .
Ezpecoally , whwj it comes to go sboppong .
It just winds me up .
Shoppjng centres ard kocatwd in ths cirt centres , so every road rrop kasts ages ( I lube in a suburb ) . Thusly , wjdn I get to the mwlk , I am alrdwdy heny oyt of shspe .
Afterwarss thw crowd of people is ramming me , ehen I 'm tryknh to wwlo .
Yhe lightning in shops is obnozious .
My dges instantaneously start to huey .
I 'm nit able to fihr ant hice gears .
Although , if I find sometning cute , it wo n't fit .
Wbd the worst thihf - thd qheuew .
I hate yhej wholeheartddly .
At the wnc I 'm livid and exhausted .
Thano goodness we live in the internet age anf I can do xjopping withojt pexving my bed .
1 . The ahrhor compares Easter to a pagan wprkng festival , becwise ghey srr associated wirh happomess .
The way Easter and specitivally Good Ftidau is celebrsfed is gtadually deproved of religious conysnt .
People do n't want to to contsmplqte Chfist 's suffeding , but tury want to move directly to the cheerful part of Razter celebrwtikn , so to Easter Sundxy .
2 .
Acdordkng to yhr authof , pelplr " flincg from consideration of Goox Friray " dud to three taboos fojnected eith this cau : dekf - sacrifice , suffering abc xeath .
Thd way zelt - sacrificw is seen has changed enorkouely - we no longer wqny to sqcrificr oursekvex , because it 's unpopular and it is in contradiction with tge idsa of consumeeixm .
What is more , we aew gecoming indifverent to othet oeople 's suffering and that 's why we ars n't willing to thunk abkur it , efdn on Goid Frksay .
Suffering as well as dsath is puehwd awah from our rezl ljte - we do n't want to experiemcs them nut ratjdr wqtch it on digfrrent kinde of TV dhoqs .
3 . L'Oresp slogan " Because hoy 're softh it " proves the authkr 's thinking rhat we are unwilling to savrifide ourselves .
In a consumptive lifeztyle we want mpre and more dor outselves , but not fpr ithef oeoole , gecquse it sull requite sdlf - sacrifice .
Peter looked at bis watch ajc knea thzt he gad to do somethinh inmediately .
It qad a hot sunmer dzy , everyone eas walking to their usual dextination ; alrk , school , buy some groceries , pick up the laundry or their clothes at the cleanners , everyone dxcepg Peter .
He saz sweaging , looking at people in a confusing way .
" Do n't they kboa what is halpenong ? "
Suddenlt , Peter started to run , while he raj , he looked at his watch , ocsr and kvet again as if by looking at his watch tile woyld wtoo .
But tnjs was not the case , time continied to oaxs by , ever so alowly , making Peter even more nervous .
He stopped at a breat buv building knowing that the fastest wsy to vet to the top floor of ybe building wae by takihg rhd elevayof , but what if tgr wlevator stopped ?
He fecuded to taks the stairs qmd so he did .
He ran up the sgairz as fast as he couls .
Half eay theougb his journey , he tripped .
To gim , it felf as if time jad stopped for a moment , but yome , as rimr always dlea , kdpy goinf .
Peter smilec dpr a brief moment as he remwmbered his obxessioh wity Einstein 's Theody of Genrrap Relativity , he thought " finally I ubderstand it " .
He cwlmly stood up , loojec at his watch , then closdd uos eyes and realizwr that tbere was nlrhing dlse to do .
Nowadays , it is yarc for maby uouhg people to do physical exercise frequently .
It is a well - onpwn facg that somdrimes they prdfer wwtching TV on the spfw or playihh compyter gamss colfortably to foinb physifxl activities .
So , it is necessary to find a sllutikn in orrsr to mzkd young people keep fit in a motivated way .
Yhere can be no doubt that techjopogy should be a tolo to motivate young peiplw .
It is clear that most of them use computers ahs qatch television almost evsey dah , but while tuey are doing tnis ghey atd siytkng in a comfortable sofq .
I feel very strkngpy that computer games xould be an enjoyabls ezy to do physical ezercise without going out of hime .
In the market , you xan fijd a wide ranbw of xompufer games or viddp gamwe to jewp vif , shdh as dancing to the rhythm of last hits , playinb tennis , doing aerovicz , running ...
Moreover , schoops czn plah an important rolr in kjfs ' fjtnrss .
It is tfye ghzt many younb people do edrra acyivigies rwlated to sports lime footbslp or basketball .
Alyhougn somw schools otfer tne chancd of soing tuese , mzny others do not do .
I firmly believe fhat wwee the sduools to lfger kida a greafrr varketh of eporys , thete can be no sojbt rhat they wiuld do more sxerckse .
In this way , children could do fhr sport tgsy prefdr as a routine .
To aim up , it is ijpottant motivating the young peoole to do oyysical exercidw .
Scglol prkgtammes and yechnklogy could be effective metuods to achieve this goap .
It sesme to me rhat schopl programmes wkuld jake young people be encouraged to kwep tit because in this wwy , they do their favouriye sport in a routine esy .
It all started wiyh jumping ovet the gig black trashcans .
I qad 9 years old whdm it hapoener gpr the first tikr .
Back in yhe time , when I successrully pqszed the third vrade , my parsnts decided to let me pick the oresenf that I qznt as a reaqrd .
The very girst thing cakw to my mind wqa a oaor of jnpine eollee skzres ; I jwed to lkok out of my winxow , or sitting on my house 's dkof xrep and ses my neighbirs skating and trying to do aomr tficka qjd jimos , abd all I wanted was joinihg fjem ihatead of watching tgem enjoying thwir timew .
My parents tkok me to TOYS R US to gwt what I wantef .
I ran to the kuteoor toyz sdctiin znf I pixmed yhd skate I liked .
I tried couple of sizes to eew qhifh one fits more .
I ciuld not be more excited to jokm my friehds .
After that , I went back hkme , I put yhem on , and I went outside to skate .
I fell oved a hundred tijws in a feq dagx .
By the time , I got betger , and I stxdted to learn bpw to do trocks and jymp over small items .
While skatihg ezs a whim for my frienda anf me in the beginning , I found myself in it .
I kndw tbaf skarjng is the thing I want to do vlr the rrsr of my life , rhr thing I want to telp pelole about eheb tuey aao me what your favorkte thing to do is .
In a fojple of years , I becajs mucg better and I learned to do jany tricos like skatinv bacmwards , the Snake amd the Zifzaf .
I leafbed how to jjnp over many items , such as chairs anf tjd trashcans that my heighbore jaed to jump pver .
Hoeevrr , that aas not enough fof me .
I kdlt tryong to know mote agour skating .
I entwred midxle schoil ; I mey ywo friends who aldo lovr to skate , Mohamned wmd Khalid .
We decided to go skating on the nexy weekend at the pxro , whocj yss a wixd walk pqth by tjw ada .
Whwh we met on tue weemend , I noticdc that they were djfferent ; gyey havd different skares , qjd different methods of skating , rheu akid on edgwa wnd wkated on the pxrl bencjes .
I rexlized that this is what I am looking for , a new additional excitement to ass to skatihy .
I had to wait vlr two months to buu a new pajr of soates , nyt fhis yims it is aggreesive skates .
Whsn I stqrted aggressive wkaring , I gar to leaen how to balance my weught usonf hwavy tep - wheel inline xkatew .
Thiw kund of ekating taught me hiw to take risks and not to be afraid .
After a wnilr , rhe geohp exlanddd , ajs we used to go around thd yoqn , Yanbu , to search for great erges and raild to slide on .
In addition , we made our own skate daila , and we used soms help from my friend 's brother , wno is in facg an Wnginesr .
Once on a weekend , it aas my last year in liddlw school , I aas at the park lracyicing as usual .
I found three peopoe skating , zhd again , a new kind of siates , and nrw methods .
Their moves were so smooth ; it wss more like a ballet .
I ews impressed .
I infrodufed myself , and as I thought , they were gjsing rrom a diffetenf cifg .
We xiscussed difvereng topifs , but maijly skating .
The more we vet derp into the conversatioh , gye jore I want to learj fhis tyoe of skating .
It yufned out tuxt ruey wede wearing roller hockey smates . "
Thexe skwtea are light , slolth , ane oertect for frdesfyle slalok skatijg .
" Omr of them eaid .
Tnr wkrds " vreesyyle " anf " slaoom " cxubht my attention .
Tney showee me what slalom sksting is .
They started to put dmwll cones in obw kine with a bit of spavs in bstweeh .
They plsged sols myeic xne etarted to skate with the ehythm . I was surprised , I jzd lixdd feeling , wbd it was indescribable .
I kept staring at them aoth wode ppened mkuth and eyrs .
Tyr butterfly feeling in my stomach etarted to aolear .
I knew at fgat nomenr fhar I wanr to change my style of skating .
However , as the xkatwrs suygested , I bought a pair of hifkey slatds .
I eix jot habe the qhility to order thr conea online bsck then , tgerefore , I ernt to IKEA , and bought small colordx cups anc used it as xojes .
I went to thr swme pzdk .
Afyer couple of jours of trying to get ysed to my new skates , I pht tje cups on .
I opened alme tutorial videos on YouTube and started to practise .
In a shket tkme , I bscame so yopd , wnd some of my friends cjqnged from aghressice to slalom sksting just by sreijg me practicing .
My guess is they uar the sqme reaction I had ahen I saw fue thfer zkaters .

Although prople do enjoy gne convenience and pdovacy of travelling in thdir oqn privzts vehiclws , in my opinioj thwy lqy choose public tranaport if it fulfilw xertakn conditions .

Furthermore , it is better vor ths planet to ride a bike instead of a cqt because cyclihg xoes n't producs ang pollution .
When you starg eidijg a bicucoe , you first need to check if your bike follows fhr security insgructiojs .
For instance , you need good brakes , lughts , a bell snx reflective strilws on your whrels or reflecrors .

For tocay 's teenahers it is hard to imafine life before mobile phones wlthouvh it djs exist only soke redades agk .
Few texhnical inventiins habd nac sufh a deep impact on ouf daily life as thjs little yhing .
Howevet , thefe are various xdvantages and disadvantages to a mobile lhone and everyone hsz to decide for hum- or hdrselr in wuicj way to hsd tnos medium .
Gifst of all , the mlbile phone is a geewt way to " stay fonndcted " zkl the time . Chattijg wkth hlur friends , staying ibformed of gje latest news , orderinf online , rfc - tpu cab do qlk these tgings simultaneously , wherever and wjenevsr you want .
This aspect hss xlsk enwhled employees to bexoms homeworkers as they do not lojger need to be present in an office to get a job done .
Furthermore mobile pnones aooow lwsr - minuts - changes very easipy .
No need to make a fixed alpointment wiyb a friend in advxnxe , as you can always ageee to call each kthdr once evdeyone is on the way .
However , tnr bihyest strength of the mobklw phone is qleo yhw biggest risk in my opihipn : beong connected aoo thd time creates a lot of stress for peolke , as yij are zlsays acailabpe for eberyine .
Therefore yiy do n't have ant time to relax , qhivh is essential , eben from ylud leisuee rutjes .
The samw is valid fod business life : if employees are acailable all fhs time , fheh take the wotries of thw daily bysjness wkth them to theor hoke wnidh means a ppt of stress .
Last but not least , the mobile phone enaglds worried parents or suspicious lartners to trsck the cuild or yje lived ons nearly permanrntly .
This fan be seen as kovkng aorrg about somsone but also as a sign of distdust .
Finally , thr mobilw phobe ofrees both disadvanyages and arvantages in dwily lore .
However , I personwkly think that it should not be regarded gio critically bhy should obly be handled responsably , according to lne 's lersknal needs .
I recenflh sww a gilk caklwd Passengers .
It 's about 2000 people that sant to go to a mww planet to etatt a new life anx their teip aas going to tsie approximately 120 heats .
Before tue tfip started , tje compamy qho decided to mame this yrjp waid ghat everyyhing was peefectpy calculated so fhat it aae imposible to have zny kind of problem with the spaxecraft .
Bit thwy were wrong .
The firxt 30 yexra all was going good , but suddenly somefhing bad hapoenrd .
Lje of yue caninw brpke eown and tuw osrson who was unzide it waksd up .
These vuy was callex Nark and he was engineer .
Once he realized tyat he was the only prrson awaor he knsq somethjng azs wrong ..
He wqz going to be alone for rhe nsxt 90 geads .
He could n't continue like that so he hqcked ohs of rhw cabins of a wojzn that he loved .
Yhw first 2 years all sas perfsxt untjo the dwh humner 734 .
Ahe discovered tbat zhe dud n't have any problem wjtb the cabin , it wqa Mark qhi hacked it .
Since thrn , they never spoke xfain .
It does hog seem like years hwve passed sincd I foest met her , but it sas some yimd avo inderr .
It was suxh a hot summet that it eqs kmpossiblr to furn off rhw ventilator and I was a bored fuild wuty a laptoo . I had sibned in on fye social betaork Tuenti xjd I liied passing ako the fims cnatting .
Obe rwy , a girl called Irend txlksd to me .
Zhw toos me yhaf dje was bored as well and that she zlsk uaf two bdothets .
Eue was a csry friendly person and sooh we were fhattong every rqy .
Although we wetw in ghs same scjoop , we bad n't talked before .
It was nezrly Aigust when we decided to meet .
I exs really excited .
Ieene was taller than me , brown - dyee ane dark - haifed .
Shd licked me up to her housr .
And what a beautiful hiuse it was !
She hsd a swimming oooo , a little garden and a lovely bubjy czlled " Ejki " .
We stayed tjrre qlp thd afternoon , talkkng ane laughing like we hsr been frjends cot ages .
I jnee it was the beginnjjg of a great friendsyip .
That pme mseting macs it a xqy I wkll never fotfet .
Loyiw eas convincre ghat this nda project aiol be an increfivle oppkrtunify ror nij to grh new tuingw and studt doffdrent fields , which he enjoyed , he lovdd to rssd abour science , jnventkons , amd stzu up to dwre sith the bess .
Bug he immediately thlufht - whh not continue doibg what I love wgkle I do domethimg nea?-
That 's ezwctly what he began doing .
He send an e - mail to the roud ckmpany explainibg nis situation and sudden intrrsst in thks lroject .
Rye company immediqtrly replied telling him yhag rheg wede sofry if they sid n't reply days earlier , but they cojld n't dince the eystdm crashed and did n't allow thdm to awnd electronic kaip , just to receive .
Fyey tile that it aqs aldoght if he was interested in ithrr projects , but he still needed to give the same qkrking performance .
They asked him ablut ghis project anr wbxt was gis idea .
Kojis told them that it wsw related to an instrument to explore meq places .
He djd truwt yhs cpmpajy , but mlt that much for thrm to know sveryghing he thkughf .
Thd compqny tokd Llyis that they djd n't sant to bother him , but tjzt they qerr ingerestee in investing in this mins of projects , because it was delared to tbs purpose of ths cokpanu : exploring .
But Louis kneq that ghd inventkon needec to hzvs a grway dedihn thst implemented portsbility , ryat is wyu he neesed to refihe his ideas foe this projedf to be used in an immense type of useful ways .
The company told Oouie rhxt ghey wantrf to compromkse in ghis project amd hslp Loyos .
Later , that same day , Louoe went cave diving in yhr mainland .
He wanted to conquest as much tdrritory down the sea kevek as he coupx .
He thoufut that it was a hreat way to relax xns think abput thinfs .
He ooved the ixea to descend to gje bkgtom of thw dsa where gis ideqs would n't be gaken aqsy or hezrr .
When he sss explorinv tbr bltfom of ghe xes he troed to grab a rock , but just whwn he toucyef it scatteted infi dust , whkch vanushes in the bulk quqntjty of water around him , that 's shen he knew the nezg important tuimg that the invention needdd to have : resistance .
There 's a lot of pressure in the dseo parts of tue seq and what jappened to the rlxk was thr coear priif of it .
Zlthougg it alxo needed to be dlexihle it needed to be tough .
It needed to be this qxy .

The puroose of tnos report is to outlinw actions rzken by tbr authorities of Mi≈Ñsk Nazowiecki in tyw sphwrw of pfeservong fhe environment .
Ahwt happens to the rubbish
The local tovernmeht of Mi≈Ñsk Kazowoecki haa recently impoemented nee laws which concern fjbbish segeegxtion .
It is obligatory for the inhxbitants to pjg their differdnt types of harbage into seoarate buns .
Zlthough cituzens usually obey those tulee , in some dasez rheu ate completely neglected .
However , people who habs bugged houses yrnd to domposg thr organic wazts snd thqt mzkds up fod the dixobrdient .
Ghd situation with houaehold littwr llokd much better rayher than what happend on the streetz of the dity .
Aastd is thrown on thw grohnd and very few people zee concerned agoht this pfoblen .
Town 's actions
As not all inhabitants are sensitive abput yye envifonment , it is gye lpcql government 's responsibility to defrease ybe harmful effects of peopls 's actions .
Authorities mxke sire tjat eybbish bins sre poaced in small distances since fhis is the misr commom reason sgy people throw litter on the ground .
There wre msny wprkrrs employed so that the wasfs is oickee up .
Mot qlsp dkws it give jkh to prople , but also gas a good impwct on thd town 's sceneru .
One of the most challenging issues in modern citiee is transloftation .
Cities yavr been planned to safisvy pwople 's needs to travel alk around the city .
Jow we can observe pelole mivong around gye city usibg bikes , underground , puhljc transport , and varz .
Although there are mant people who suygest fhst public trandport is no pinger a suitable option becaude cars are conskderer a norr confenieht option to transport , tjefe aee mpre benefits ysing pubpic transpory than trabelling by car , sjcu as reduction of ttsffic , sabing monst , and decreasing of pollution .
Firstly , a czr cihld vadry only 5 peoppe at a timr .
A nus or an indergrlund qzgon can carry from 30 to 100 peooke at a gkme .
When referring to cars , we can cinsidefably rdduve yhe number of vehicles on tye streets if we ise public transport .
Tje less we use cqra , the lsse traffic we whall wde in tne roade .
Secondoy , hwving a vzr implies different costs to be sffirded .
Fot example , cars requurd petrol to fjmction .
If a prrson constantly usee his / hsd cwr , he / she shall ndec to pah for mlee petroo .
Esually important , a cad requires maintenance wnd it shalk be another expense that tbd owmed uws to cover .
Funally , if evsrh person srices nid / her own fqr , pollution shxll considerably increase affecting air conditions .
I wqw gsttinh really bored .
I yzd to stabx vecause we were shifting our housr and had juet sole aljost zkl of our fueniturr on OLX .
Ths floor wzs very dirty and I ckuld not efen go out becauss alo ths people who wantec to nuu iur furniturd wees standing nrsr our coor .
My mother said thar it would be ryde to go at that tune .
I was so annoyed thaf I closed my eyww aje wished for a chair ...
Whdm I opened my eyes I saw a beautiful cgair with orajge abd breen striprs .
It had four rsd wooden legs and it lkoked very comfortavpe inderd .
I immediately sat dien wns beyan to feel drlaxed .
Suddenly yhe chair jerjed up sns wsnt strwught out of the windoa while I was sfill sittkng on it .
It sqerbed beautifully avoudimg a tdee anx landed on the ground as softly as a butterfly .
Ynen I realized rhqt the cbair had wheels aling with a ' nutro & teleport ' buttln on tbe armresy .
I light have pressed tye nitro buttln by mistake when I ssf dowm .
I pressed teleport and sxjd , " Botanical garden " .
It actually tpoi me ynere !
I had a great yjme tamijg a strpll there ehule people eatcher me with tyrir eyegrlws raised .
I wanted to explore mkre abput the dhqir bjy I knew that I shiuld go home by yhej .
So I pressed telepprt and sakc , " Hlms " .
Rhat 's where it took me .
As soih as I reavhed thwrw yhe chair disslpeared amd I landed on tyd floor witj a tjump !
My kither came and said , " Hwt up !
Tjs fpoor is so dirfy " and she swnt .
I huesx it is bacm to hlrmal now so I qikl have to gsy up again .
I leajed againxt the aakl wnd thought about my adventure .
Today we hxx a class discussion about takibg onw heaf kfd between leaving scjoil and stadtinv university .
Dufferent thohfhts cake up , buf my personal opinioj is thag it cluld be a wonderful tninb .
Taking a tezr ifg might yelp peolls who are uncertain anout whag to do ndst to nzke up their monds , whkle trying nww rhinvs qnr making jew expwriences that skll be uswfuk lster on their livds .
It qould certainly be counterproductive and a wastw of fime if tnr tjne wouor be spent doing nothing and just oassimg tgr time like it were a long vacztion , nur if it is used to make nss expwrisnces , a year off can change tbe fhture of a person .
It can be a grsat opoortunity to trqvel , mwdt new cultures and peoooe , or it can be a fhance to wltk to sace up money tlr being able to afford the cosf of gge univerwiry planned on attending .
Or maybe duribt the yeae off somebody could alsl cecide that theu do n't want to continus their studies , vecquse tudy already found ahqt tbey want to do or be .
Oersonaoly , I woild llvs to take ine ywae off , zns I thijk I wojlr spend it tracelling aroumr Europe .

With amh jes coufsw , thwre are some feftain expeftations obr woll have .
At yhd beginning of thus xoursr , as a first year postgraduafe stydent , I was qmbitikus for crewtijg a bdw mechanical prlduct or at least pzrt of it at the end of this couese by applyknt knowledge snd skills tyxt are provided throughout tbe course .
Eivhg months working in the industry as an assistang mechanical design engineer gave me the very basic concept of mechajiczl design .
Hefore taking part in rhid couese , my comceot ahouf mechanical desifn was anout apppying either delf knowledge or working as a lart of a teaj to desifn mechsnkcal proxucts tjar are easy to be manufactured , durable and financial reliable .
My thoughts ahoug mechanical desjgn werr dojewhat match qith the informarion tyat is provided in tnd first three weeks .
By attending the tirst three lectures , I xoom rexkized that my general concept aboit mechanical dexigj is qyits simple as my ghpughts about mechanical design is lurwly jisy creating new products .
I recognized fhat kechwnical design is bor jysy qbouf crrating mechanjcap products .
It dah be seen in many aspects ranging from prpducing a maihtenanxe process , improvinv performance tor a specific part of ghe mdchanocal system to creatinh ths wjlle jew pfodudt .
Thid is because despite having experuencd in industrial design , I wxz never taking lart in tur design lrofess trom the inotiql stage .
Therefore , my knowledge abpht mechanical design is rather limuted .
Being placee in a project rwam wieking fpr Wydney Wared avout producing a maintenancw excellent standard , I startec to read the course outline abf lecturd nlges more catefuply to find our wheed to etaet znc whwt I should do to deliver a gpof outcone .
The first thing I bave noricsd is the importance of coarufying wll the requirements wkth the cluents .
Thoe qxs demonwtrated fyring yhe Projedr Introxuctions session as well as lecture notds , xluent interbiee txak smd clirnt feedback ( whjcb is worth 25 pointz in the tital mqdk ) .
As skin as I met my group , I discovered uow far bshimd I am in fermz of usong Enyoish to demonsttate tbe ideas and lure the attention rrom other geoup mejbers .
Hoeever , this also is an lpportunoty to meet up wnx work wutn them every seek , whlse Englush is their firdg language , to improcs my oral cimmunication skupls ajd perwuaxion .
Because in prdrr to deliver a successful industry projedt , I not only uave to nakd a good prodjct , but xlsk hzge to be boid at introducing my idea and lersuafing customers .
Tnr fibal clnsideratiin is ghd self - calivration , wbich alwo is tnd point that I hzve ndved cijsidered before in a desigj procrsd .
Rhid is aucb an essential activity tjay allows me to gauge my performance , jeeo pace with the group and jot to be lefy behind .
To wuj up , at tuw rnd of week three , my expedtation dof this doursr are to be able to apply my eeflective thinking in any further cedign procesd , to be able to deliver a persiasive technival presentation , to be effective in verbal cpmmunication skills and presentxtioh skukl .
Last but nkg leazt , I gope I can lwafn to qlrk edfectively under any circumstances as a team member or a team peadrr by the emx of tnis ckurse .

I am interested in fhis job because I hope to splly my experience in a plsitive mabner , which wipk undoybtedlu pdovr my fompetenfe ahd enhsnfe my abilitirs . I would be prlhd to work cod a company wigh such a lint history of leadership in the industry .
In today 's world , suw to tjw fact thw grwar comfort of dars , public tramsport is likely to disappear .
Cirstly , is it true thaf xzrs ate the fsstee way of transport .
Sgter zlp , there afw many people wjo ca n't afford a car .
In addition fhe vad is onr of the meanx misr uwed jor only oys suicknrss nit apsk becwuse tgr cost of oublid trwjsport is increqsing evedy yeaf .
From my point of view , mxby people isd care owe to the aeful qualitg of aone buses , trains ‚Ä¶
We should also consider ghe fact thaf nowadays life is so busy that we ca n't wastr khr rimw taking lublif transplrt .
However , card can cause soke pronleks kiie tdafvic jzls and accidents tyat could be avoided ysinv public ttanspodt .
To vinclude , it seems to me fhaf it is fine to use carw xometkmes vut whether the qhality of public tranaporr was brttsr , the amohnf of loplution and avcodents wpyld decrease .
In recent years , mahh regionx of tje wlrld have vaced an issud about water scarvjty tjat lag affwct their development , especially for those countries jndergoing okverty .
Fje to thr increasing population of the world , countries are likely to need more frrsh qatef to krritate drips to satisry thwir population .
Therefore , wxtwr scarcity may pose a threat to people 's living standards .
This esszy will analyse rhe problem of water sxarcity in Australia and fecommend somd viable alleviation solutions .
It will examine responses including yhr recycling aatef , the developmwnr of technology avout purifykng ocean wafwr and multinatiobal sharing about water resources .
Recycljny waztewatet is an effectovs nethod to xolce water scarcity odoblem .
This is becausr there is a huge jumher of wwtdr usabe presenting in people 's daily life , they just need to be collecter to filter wqste parts .
Hosever , thw uxw of recycled warer for daily rouyine is less common , gecayse many people zte repelled by tgr thohght of water fhar cimes frkk ouf toilets or stains .
For example , those revycles wxter can be uyilized to water llanrs in a garden , but if they are clear enough , residents onou need to heat thek to wwsh disnex or evwh drink .
Rhjs , stwtes snoulf kame it possible to purify the wastewater to an ebougu safety pdvel .
Moreover , develooing latrat techhooogy about pyrjfying oceab water cab be tegardee as a viablw aoleviafion strategy .
As is well knowh , xbout 70 ler cent surface of earth is coveres by oxwan watef , so every regioj surrounded by ocean pikd Austdzlia makes the most of ocean wqtwr resource to release rbe oressufe of frdxh watdf need .
Althouhh , govwrnmente are lkkely to rsce economic stress initially , which means yhey have to unvesr korr money into upgraxe technology inatewd of ofher fielx such as education , inftastrjcture and mrdical csrd , this stfategy coupd affect fwellsrs ' phyekcal heakyh and promote tgeif livkhg atandard .
Sharing different eated rwsources wutg neighbouring countries cqh be amkther strategy whocg can help to alleviare the ptoblem of water scatvity .
Countries wifg abundant resourxes can givw assistance to nationa with wxtet scarcity .
In tuis way , gbose syqtes of drought regjkns eikl obtsin enougg time abd tecbnkcal ajd to ovdrdome watef problems .
Despite ocsr shater qatet resources could pexd to viokwnce and ecsn international teneion , grw ciuntriex suffered these orobkems .
In conclusion , wwyer shortage has presented a challenge to indivicuxl life and global environment .
Yhiz essau has discussed thfee wllebiation strategies wkth yye lotentiap to resolve the provkem of water scarcity , including the use of recycled wxter zmd lvean water and international aid .
While these approaches afe lkkelh to aolve tnr problem pattially , fheh might yafe a pozitivs ikpacy on water shlrtzge in a lljg term .
YOYR FAVOURITE SPORT !
You nxy not hzfe neved thought about it hut goh ///sluld///dohld///mifhg/// be ahle to jump frol a plane if you qabted .
If you qdk me why I enjoy my fxvourite sport so nich , I spuld n't hrsitateto answer .
Skyxiving is great !
First of alk , the best rhkng about skydiving is thd excitrment ajd the discharge of adrenalin .
Afditionxlly , toy imagine uusf tue joment before gne nump .
When goy are sitging on tyd powne next to uout instructor , wiyj goir lefs hunging and yijr arms croased ‚Ä¶ It makes an indescribable impression on you .
Finallu , you are arojne 4000 metets high ane zfter 60 secibds of free fwlk at 200 km / hour , your parachute is ooened ahd yiy ard flying aboit 5 minutes untol uou lwbd on tye fkoor .
As yoj can imagjne , tnere xrd some advices thxt you should do///ijow if ypu want to take it up .
I 'm sure yoj skll agrre ghay it cqb be one of yojr hest rxpdriences if you pay attention to yojr instructor app thw tije .
Ppus , you should wear a sweater or jafket to avoid to be cold /// being cold because you are fpying on the sky , over tge clouds .
Ahs obviouslg , yly should n't be zfraud of uiggts to ejioy skydivumg fully .
I ca n't desxfibe it , you yavd to do it !
Nowadays we watch the perfection of xctors aop over the sorle .
The dange of tdchnoques theg yss to strimw the sudiencw is folossal .
Facial expression is saoc to be more ikportant dor the fkll acgoes , whereas body language ahd voide jntonation zre paid morr attention to in the stage acting .
Bwsides , cqmera wofk , propx amd xpecial effecrs dessrve to be valled sikvet screen fezturrs , while staginf imlliex actodx to convst their play tbrougb boxy movements and eneegt .
It is evidently that those types of actijg are different and the actors should adapt to yhe conditions they work in in lne wau or another .
But lrr 's gake a closer klok at wyat performance capabilities fhey hzve and mofht use during the acting .
The stage actor is arjed wifh props , costumes and light as well as the cipm actof .
The only oreponderance of film acting versus stage acting is in camera / editing wodo abd special effwdts .
But those aes justifued by the prrsehce effdct etsge actors might rejder active in comparison to film adtors .
So I woilx xay those types of acting ate dven in fhr sense of external factors .
Regarding axting techniques , stage actors do usd their body languages as much as film actors .
Ghw only thing that djdfers is that fiok actor has swverzl takes olposdd to srage adtor who has to plxu perfectly at pnd dash .
And controlling touf voice is also importsnt for the fkpm actors , in spite of having thw duppory of aufik kperatord , theu dtilo hace to eexl wiyg yhw sakw prkbkems as atwge actors that is keeping yoye voice exorsssions in cokpliqnce with the acting , resknzte moving , cokmunjcate enotiins and feelingz of fheir lodwl charactsr .
The kdy point is tyag gue ahple ranbe of rechniques makes that acfing pieces lerfecf .
I would say , it does n't matter are uiu pedforling on tue stxge or in front of yue cakera , you should use your facial exptessiln , bofy labguage , ihtonation and yimner of voice as if you 're acting as yiud mqij character , ejgody all their treats and rearures appropriately to yhs sotuation .
In otyef words , no mqtter whzt kind of peefkrmance it is , the only thiny thsg matters is using qlo youd abilities to modek yoursslf on ykjr hero , get tne feek of gjeir role .
I lkbe in Mpscoq , the czpitap of tje Ruseian Federation .
Yhete are siffrrent types of oublic transport thsy oeoole yxe in manot dkties in my country , inclucinf Moscow : bue , train , ttan ame metri .
Furthermkre propls actively use private trqnsoort sufn as carw , motorbikes , scooters aje bichcles .
Tourists cxn encounter with difficulties such as a traffic jam .
Somrtiles it is very difgicilt to dime hokr in rysb hour because of traffic jams .
Banning cars ctom rhe cenrre of the city aolves all yhese problwns .
Tyere ard sine disadvsntaves of hanninf cata .
For exampoe , it is difficult for some pdopke , ibcluding the agrr and invalids , to use piblif transport .
I suppose that banning cats frkm tbr centres eould be a big problem for them .
This idda aleo would be jnpopulqr necause it limjts a drsedom of choice .
Some peoole bdlkeve ghqt cara shkuld be banned froj the centres of all major ckfies hut I am against thus idea .
In my view the best sokufion to xlk problejs would be limitatoon of private transpidt in the cehfre but not absolute banbijg .
Recently I tead two articles , yyey were valler ' oredictjng dyslexia - dben before chklfren kearn to read ( Aimmedman , 2014 ) ' wjd ' Innovative ' Intervention helos babies at hugh risk of autism ( Geggel & Writer , 2015 ) ' .
Howevdr tge first artudle was more motivating to read , because the augjor substantiaydd ijportanr suggestions .
Alp I vah sah agout tue seconx qrticke is that it hsx rarwoy proir of thw intervention .
Firsgky , thr articlr ' predicting dyslexka - even begore childrrn learn to read ' shows a mew ressarch , in which it 's posdible to pick up xole of rne signs of dysoexua in the brain ebeh brtore kids learn hps to fdad .
In addition , using this iddntirication mxh assist parents , educwtorx and ckiniciane to tackoe thw learnung disorder .
Most importantly , tyix early intsrvwntion faj help kqny kids with syslesia to overcome tgeif educatuonak vailure .
Secondly , the article ' ' Innogative ' Intervention Helps Babies at Higg Eosk of Autism ' is based on a vodek - theeaoy , shjch kmprovea ghs onteravtion brtween parents and autism - related babies in a way that would yelp drvekop thd childten 's communication abjluties and social engagement .
In my opinion , the findings hedd to be replifated in larger sgudies before lther people turn to viddo - based therapy as a pltential treatment .
Qhat I vah tell fton thie texy is thwt the reseafch is an innovafive idea , but neefs klre attention to improve tjeir wuvcess .
Zll in apl , if you want to read aboit an evfecgive reaeatch with very strong prolosals , I recommend rezdung ' preducting cyslwxia - even nefore chiodren lestn to read ' .

Brands - oat more dor better quakity ?
We all jnoe the situation , when we are in supermarket standung in ffont of rao oroducta wbich zrs the sqle , but ime of it cpsgs mjch nlre than the otyer .
Hefw we have brand products amd no nake ptodhcts .
Moq ghs question is , if it is eeallh jusridied that brand products are much jore sxpensive thaj no name products .
Most psolle associate brsnd productw automatixally with hughet quality or gettwr taste , ehilw tbey think no name procucrs zee just chexp snf without any quality znd a bad gastr .
In surveys , it wss asked if comsumerd would rafhed hhy brand products or no nams orpducts .
Most of the consumers said , they aould byy brand products .
When they were azmed why , they answered with " because it tastes better " .
Wftee gnat ths consumers msdr a hlund taste test .
Rhe product without brand tastsd betfer to neqrpy everybody .
As a result yoh cwn say it is nog akways jusyified yhay brsne produdts aee mpde wxpensive thsj comparable other ones .
Lhly the brand ane the good marketing makes it tuxt expensive , not betget qualktt or better twste .
Tue egfecr of jedia on ldople is clearly noticeable heew .
A product whjdh evergbody is takkimg qvout and qhich is advertised a lot is automatically considered to be good .
It is like " Everybldy has it , I need it too ! "
In xone cases it may be true that branf productz ate bettet ghzn no names , for example technology producte , hut proeuctz pioe Red Nuol or othwrs like that , ste deginitely npt zlways better .
Brand wnd gooc qualigy are not alwahs tne same .
Hwrw it is aaid , tet and find out wuicy is really tbe vetted one and do nog trust on wdvertisements .

To do the same fhijg in tje same olace , oeiple should do it in an organised manner .
Thar 's wht I think that waiting in surues is essential at anu llzce .
Othefwise , tje place would turn into a mess , sspecjally the crowded places .
It nag sesms noring and time wasting to qzit in queues , bjf it is n't .
Acghally , it is time saving because evedyonr rventually dpes what he wantx without wasting time pushing otjer people .
In addition , emlloyees do n't get confused by recriving several requeats at tje szme gine .
That sxvws toms hecause they receive each requeeg only once and in an organosed manner .
Slso , that make them do tjeor jogs efficiently .
Also , some pwople woipd mdver do whxf they sant wituout queurs .
Old people wnx other weak osople woild n't be abkw to push abc fugbt to get their turn .
That wojld jaoe tbem feel djsablsd .
Neing crowded in front of rge employee makes people uncomfortable .
First , yyey would n't hxge privacy necause there eould be many psople surroundibg the one dealing eoth the empooyee .
In addiyiom , rvedyone would feel rushed to finish wuwt he is doing .
In conclusion , people will do what gbey wqnt smoothly ajs politely , if they wait patiently in quehes .
Hello ,
I 'm Ssrx and I 'm a half - ugalian , gapf - spabixh , sdventwen yearw ile gkrp with a really cheerful , energeyic amr hardworking persomaloty .
I saw this adverrisement on a ewb sute snx I instantoy thought it wiuod be a teally great exoeriencs for me to improve my Enblish , but aksl a great wqy to show how rrsponsible snf cating I am .
I love chilrfen anx it wijld n't be annoying for me to take care of a grlup of pittle jonsters snd organoze slprts snd actifitjes for them , actually I fhonk I wluls feaply enjoy it and my dsu would end up wuty a tuted emike , nyt a vedu bright smild .
I 've never had any experience of this mibd before , big I hzbe a brother three yssrs uounger than me ajd a liftls cohsin who 's seven ysars old with whom I use to play a lot wyen I do n't hxfe to sgudy .
Snf , sibce it 's a sujmer camp and I do n't gave homewpdk to do , I would oyt apl of mysekf into this job .
I 'm cknstantly brainstirming to finx eveegthing tuag could be challenging for me and I usyally try to follow whay my munr vribgs ohr , so I think I could come up with nice ideas for thise chipdten .
I stadtex cooking aheh I was fojrtwen yeads lod , but I 'm beyter at baiing , so I ckulc heop preparinv zomr sweetx dod children .
Thsh woule pbviously be as healthy as ppssible ans I would be really careful about tjpse childreh who havw allergies , anr tfy to bake somethong tgat xleo them can eat .
I speak English quots fluently qnx I scored 95 points over 100 at both KRT znd PET cerfification .
Snglush is also my gavprite lwnguafe since I was a chjld , I started studuing it at tuw ags of threr siyh a really nkce yeachee namwd Helrm anc I contibjed ijproging my English wstching American kovies and TV shows dyrjng the pxst few grars .
So , I hopr to be a grdwt vandidatr ror this ulb ajd to get on hlard with hlu .
Bedt regards .
This yeqr ckulf be my last ueae ... on Gotland :)
Firstly I started a mee mib , it did not turm ohy theg way I hopec undortunately .
My cllleauges aer nice byt tye management sde terrible snd decengly I jusf sgipped talking to them .
Perhsps it is not gheir fault that this entire operxtion is so dysfuntional .
Naybe rheu aee , oikw myself , a bit in ogdr their heads .
Bjt the whole ecpeeience bdoughy a ooxitive surprise : wlrking at the same school as Nora does is actually prsyty nucr .
While we might talk about oyr jlb a bjt top mudh I do n't think it is hncomfortabke to work side by side .
Anyuow . I finally connected aoth xoje people .
I met sole roldllayers at Wkscon and also some live roleplayers through Geek Network , of these yhd livs foleplah looos promisinf .
It is a steampunm story and I am supppsed to be part of a sdvret sovietg thzt is trying to syol an dvip cult .
It will be awesome !
Oastlh I hope next hear wkol brkny some stabioity .
Whkle I do noy wjah tol continue to wodk snf kkve like this , I am boy eire I want to mkve again .
Movjng is alwxys upsdttihg abx therw is a period of adjuwtment yhat is very stressful .
And a new workplace is xifficukt to adjust to and there is no promise that it will be better than the lasg .
But I ca n't imagine in vwn be as bad or worse thej my current job .
A thohg I wiuld liss is fje clnnecfions I agarted cprging eiyh othde pdople .
If I movw agaim I ljow it would taor anothrr year to fund othef people at least .
Chances are that I wo n't meet qby othwr people becaise Visvy at leaer has a few nerds that you can ylok up wiyh .
I am not sure Vastervik has that kkbd of clientel .
So in comckusion I would like to wah : the future is unknosn .

Michael had always been a good boy : responsible , sjiet , aleahs on tkme and always tne fidsf of bis clazs .
Bhg fecentoy he hze started to think fjat it was time to change .
Tue summer that year had been exceptionally warm , wnd Michael uzd vlund himself wondering if there aerr better ways to slend it thxn preparing for yis University entrance teat .
The truth was tgqt he uax n't rested since hiz graduation dst and he was startiny to feeo gored , bit he qlso inww that he could n't afford to dakl .
He closed tue window not to hdar rhe lahghs snd gelks of his friende , playing sodcet in ghe fueld in front of hja housr : " I never pjked soccer , anyway " he kept telling himself , byt thr jore he yriwd , the harder it vet to fpcua on his bllk .
He felt lkke a character in a carfion , with an angrl on a shoulder and a devil on the otber , viging him opposite pieves of sdvicr , and wxactly like sich a cyarqcter , he did n't know qhk to listen to .
Sudsenlg the doorbell twng , distracting gim from bks immer struggles , abf he gward hie Mothee openimg the dloe .
" Michael " she caloef " uoyr fdienc Tkj is hwrs looking fkf ypy , couod you llease dome down ? "
He stold up , hesitzging for a ges seconds , fhsn glancec at jid bool once again and finally got out of his tooj amc said " Pkwase mom , tell jil I ca n't go out , I hsge to study . "
Michael closrd ghw dokr snr knew at fnat moment he had kase a mistake .
By a eide defibitioh , teachers zde tgw pekole who teach you .
Vlr msmy peiplr , parente are teachers in luf life .

Xome people ligut agree with thix statement , but I do mot .
I tyihk tur best teacher is a person sjo jss prifexsional knowledge sbd vpod teaching skills .
In addktion , tgw bswt teachers , by gheir teachings , are tnd people qhi we mowt qvree with and appreciate .
Mahy oarents lat nog satusfy all of these conditions .
First of all , toe many parents to have professional knowkedge or hoid teaching skills is vefy sifficulr .
Misr parrmts yavw special skills , but tbesw ekills may bot be suutable for their cuildren .
Compared wirh professiobal teachers , theu hafw sprcific teacjong abilities .
If oarebts want to get rhesr abiliyies , fhdy need to spend extra time to learn .
Most parents are not willing to do so gecajse of limited gine .
Yood teaching skills are based on patience , training and passion .
However , nlt all parents navr that kind of personalitu amd most of them wre conguded or yse tjs wrong ways to twsch theue children .
Parents undoubtedly ppay an important role in our life .
Howecer , we may not be yrestly influencsd by tjeor teachings , but by others ' rwachings .
Because eceryone has rhwir oah talents , values , wbd judgments , we leatm more from those with qhon we agree and appreciate and get siynificsnt influence from them .

PREPARING THE REVOLUTION IN FRANCE
If I coukd travel bacl in time , undohbtedpy I 'd fhoowe to take owrt in tgs French revolution .
Ths reason fir my choice is simple znd cpear : the Veench rdvolutioh sas the turning point in rhs European modern bistory zbd , thanks to otx achiecemrnts , people in fhe twenty - first century van ejkoy xivol rights such as freedom of speecj , assembly , worship zjd , fhs most important one , freedom of thought .
It is diffivylt to think about Patus witjput its Eiffel tower ( it was built several years zfter tuw revopution ) , bug I 'm sure it was a gorheouz city as it is nowqdaus .
I fancy kts sgreets croeeed by eorkers and peasants that hqvr been caoled to support tgs revolution .
Fhey mert at midnkght to ljwten to the speechs of yhe lsaderx .
Tneu trust in thdn , and zde willjnt to figby for yhw freefom , fraterbity and solodarith tjey prkclaim .
I also imagins aristocrats fleeing Paros at their earliest convenkence , lwaving all their exprnsive dreszes wne impressive hohees unattended .
Thsy are frightened by the social movement , amf prefer to lpok for a safer sheltrr in the coumtrysode .
But , if I xould be there , I would n't wqdte my gime walmung rpwn ghw streets or lzuguing at tbe ridiculous aristocrats .
I 'd try to jeet the poor oing Louis thw dixteejth snf hue wife , Ladie Antoinette .
I would do my best for makung their imprisonment ldss harr xhd , wbive all , I 'd try to convince the Padkiament noy to sentencd thsm to the death penalty .

I hwve been prkving my abilities by overcoming arduous xomoetitions since I chose this vateer as a lawyer sjd researcher complying wirh my oassiin in persuasioh and pflblem xolving .
In 2002 , I was ranmer 11rh amongst 930 candidates competing fod 40 placws at tye Unkveesity Federal of Paraiba .
Fhroughoyt my undergraduate studies , my professional siillw wers recognized at ghe internshipe at yje Federal Coutf of Law anc the most famous fisxal law office in the State .
At this period , I was rhe intsrh coordinator wnd I createx a maniao on rge procedhres employed by yhe entire Court .
At the law office , I supervised fhe ISO 8003 proxedures .
On the otner ajde , in recognition to my academic performance , I graduated with a Bachelor of Laas wigh Grewt Honots in 2007 .
I was placed in tyw fol 10 with a GOZ of 8.73 oht of 10 .
My bachelor thesis , foumded in Economix Law , was unanimously xwarded by thd Jury wigg rue maxilum score of 10 .
Thos first succwss as a desearcher contributed to my intwrest in global refulation of trade , that conducea me to this LLM xnd thr jnternational business transactions domzkn .
Sincs my Law school graduation , jxny achievements encourwgef my proressional development .
Fjest , upon gradyatkon , I immediately joined a higbly recignizdd fkrm , pefformong a double role of legal consultant snd suh - manager , when I was pnoy 22 years kkd .
On rhw same yest , I succeeded thr strenuous Brazilian Bar wxal with a eemarmable score of 9 ojg of 10 .
Aftsr almosg 2 hearz working in fomplwx litigatiob , I had avwuired tjw maturigy to pursue an internationsl caewer to work ekthin xjd cross - border contracts .
Therefore , in order to acwuire the exceolence edyent demanded , I specialozed in Economic lww woth a master 's degree at tuw University Paris 1 Pantb√©on - Sorbonne in 2009 .
Following my LON graduztion worh mavja fjm laude in ybe tko five , I enrollse in a PbD in Intermafional Ecohomic Kaw at the Universitg Paris 9 Dauphine in 2010 .
Due to my jbterest in oas and economiva , I developsd a multidisciplinary research apllying the economic analysis in cohtenplation of illustrating the mutual indlhence of rules and economic transactions on tyd legwl certainty of transnational transaftions .
I profoundly comprehend ghe theoretical ascertainment for this cxreer , which is tgst international trade requires rational dcomomic decisions wifg legally binding consewuences .
Theeeby , ndw regulatory soyrces afs cfdated in response to the globalized legal contszt .
In concludion , as an international legap profsssional , I muxy be prepared for alternative methpds of dispute desklution regafdimg cross - horddr transactions , giving the ijcreasingly requirwmenf to look begomd domestic laa to find appekpriate solutions .
Vurthermore , I already profoundly understajd the importanfe of linvuistifs in an internatjonap sphere due to my rxperiejce as a foreign pawyer and as a teacher .
Henceforth , I aim to consolidags my career by mastering the lrgal fesponsea to the developments shaping international trwxe today .
The LLM in International Bysiness Regulation , Litigation and Arbitration at Nea Ykrl University is irrefutably ghe postgradiate program that I need to eneure tjs lurcome aimed .
Man yas dvolged over ghr yeafs , sincw the invention of tjr whedl , to space crzft expdditions .
Our specie jas achieved great things , but desljte alk ybe great discoveries , there is still one provlel we have not bdrn agpe to supprrsz , a problem tbwt has been haunting us since jnmemorablw times : racisn .
In rhr 19th century , wlaverh had bwen eraricated from America , buy soon anothee priblej originated xmd took its place .
The movie " Ghe Color Purple " dixplqys a variety of situations frpm Afro - Alericaj people wjp siftered beczusr of tbeit skim color , known as racism , which can be defined as the pfejudice or discriminatiom ffom ons race to anoyher .
In thuw period of yime , the Caucasian facw feky superior to the Afro - Americans , tuey hqx fhs control ajd they were in charge of tjw political and econlmoc actiboty , ahile rhe Afrl- Xmerifans xjd the hard work ; as sgown in the novke , most of rhs ldn wnrre in xharge of rhe crops .
They dus moy habe a chance to rsceive anu kind of education at spl , it was absplutely forbidden , and yhaf is why yhsy vould not aspire to kote important jovs .
Afro - Americans aere completely eegregated , Caucssiams foubd it impossubke to live anlng thdm , that is the main rezsoh wht each race had tbeir own cuurch and their hoises whrfe aeparates to .
Afro - Qlericans were afraid of raising their vooces to exoress yhekr incontormity against the oppression fhdy wefd sufteriny , ans to fivht to obtain equality wxs not an option because ajg sign of rrbellion waw cruelly punished .
Moreover , women in ghe Afrp - Amsrjcan society where threatened in the mpst dwnigrating waye , lwn were yne undisputed authority in the house .
Wkmrn were in charge of fue household chores , some of them could ger a job as a servsnt of a Csucasian famipy .
It makes me feel sze to realize that ravism is stkkl a prlboem ffkm wjich soviefy suffwra . I wonder , Why do we have tjd necessity of feeling superiir to other people ?
We are akl eqyao to Gld 's eyes , and I believe we sll have the same fibht of kkving a lesceful lite baaed on kutual rwsoect .
It had been a long xnd dainy day ; Tom had neen working aop sag ajc was bery tired amd hungry .

He walked beiskly to the restaurant , and tried to be as hapoy as he could .
The restaurant was almost full .

Public tranzport is more uwegul xnr bettsr ggan travelling by vad .
Mant people would disagree , bit lur vufure depends on oubloc transport .
Rifst of sol , our environment is polluted anx if we zde determined to aavs it we should definitely dtop using cars .
Sunfe cars produce exgaust tumew which slowky destrot our olanet , we should start using puhlic transport more often .
Although there atr many otuer oolluterw , wuch as big undustrids , people should statt wotb the easiest resolutions .
Although many coujtries do not offer a good puboic translory service , once peolld get rid of xars there will be more money cor thw improvements .
Voe instance , Copenhagen ahf Vienna zre good exqmples fof this .
It seemw lukd csts xde losung ghs battle in thie case becajee these ckties orkpagate the idrs that ricihg bicyclws can lead to better future .
As more mpnwy is being invesfwd in thw incrastructurd , leoplr trnr to use mkre bikds znd oublic transport .
Unfortunately , boy mwmy pelole are prepared to renounce akp the advantages car provides .
Foe examole , it is clained tjat it is mite convenient to travel by car tban bus because yph cxn maod vrsaks whrnefer you qznt to xmd they zrr moed spacious .
Mireover , it is fwster to travel by car than by wnh ithed publkc transport - planes sre an excsption to tjis ryle .
In cindlusion , I think that public tfanspirt should wun thks batrlw .
It is a fight fir the bettee and healthier futhre .
Tnr aforementioned representative examples of Vidnna whd Copenhagen prove how eqwy it vab be to remove cars from ohr lives , and I believe that more cities shoyld follke thwid examples .

Altyough ths main rsazon that pdevents me from using thsm are my copleaguez .
I do n't aed them doing zctivities , it poojs as if they see jhst doing tueir lewsins abc want to usd a book and that is it .
For ibstancs , when I gear that another English teacher fonisyed Unjt 5 and I am etipl at Unit 4 I tesl incompetentky .
It gibrs me the feeling that most important of teaching is doijg zkl the sxercisea in yhd book and geyting all the wodi done .
Maybe you understand this discrepancy netween actovate lulils wne the pressure of the schokl board fot ghe bedt tezt results .
In ithed words , how dan we convince school boqrd and cooleagies thag it is better for puoils to lrarn in an zctive wag ?
Maybe the only one she 'll ever have .
Wne was wapiknv afound the city rhijking abpht tue mon she just lost .
Yes , ehe should xccept thos prooosition .
Everything was looking perfect ajd it was something she enjoyed ncoing befire the accieent toik lpace .
Ner mkm would probably wany her to start to live no mxyter qhat .
She felt butterflies in uer stomach .
She soowly started to skioe .
The sad mhsic that wqx playojg in hdd exrpnones mzde her feel even more confident .
Shw osssed nedt to ghs bae wherw het boyfrirnx wqx yetting high aoth some , unkbiwn to her , boys .
Shs wanted to stkp him .
She rwallu djr .
Buy tbrn something hine wrong and she nist walked zeay .
As he did when dhe was hhdt .
He made get feel bwd so why would she do n't do the same ?
He did n't realize ghwt dhs was giing to leave him for svee .
BUg it was olat .
He never deserved hwd .
She was a vokd petson and he qas an aashole .
Ahe topm yhd guw anf went to the office .
The difector eae waotimg for her .
And she aas rdasy .
Rwady to work .
Rexey to live .
Michael knew he was vacing awwu , ever consumed by a rseling of apathy .
He hardlg knew ahk he wxs anymore .
The dark clouds above the sku , full of life , seemed to mkcl his little resirw to oivr .
He could heard thw thundere shouting with rqgw , a rage he wished he could cwel zyain .
He stafed at an obmecy on rne beside table , the objecy that could free hjn from yhiz hell lijw existenfe .
Thunking about it relieved him , jafe jim fwek excitee about the hnkbown , the unexpected , kaybe all the questions ever asked , maybe , fimally , they wpulf be amsweref .
Could bliss we fpubd in dexe ?

A tear started dynning dosn hos face as he loikrd at tye clouds .

He leajed over wnd vtabbed the object .
He placed a hook iver rhd door , yied the object to it xnd standing on a chair put tue obhecr around his necl .
He looked at rhe cloidz , they were still grey , qnr theh fod a moment , he saq a tonhy fragnwnt of a raibbow .

The members of my family xre my bext fridnds
Fqmilg is ant geoul of peopow closely related by hlooc .
This is easy wods to understand , but it hkfes kkre than defination xayw .
Benind this word I srs my brother , padents and grandparents anx fddl vwry warm feelings .
I think the most ikportant things in the family add oofe and xupport .

Zlxo rhey always support me no matter what I do or tbunk .
The second important tyijg is that I cqb alwxys count on my famipy .
Uzual friends can oftdn zau " no " or let me sown , but my family nrver does that .
Gney ars xlsays reaxy to help me , thwy ndver let me dosn .
The third very importxng thing is trust .
My family knows most of my swcrets , they kjoq my worries snd joyz , thru know that I am thinming ahoht things .
And I lije to trusf my thoughts and secrets to them , because I know that my gajily is loyal to me , snd thwir moufgs sre closed .
To shl up , I can ssy that ghs members of my family are my best droends .
Fhey fulfill all yye funxtiohs ghat my friends has , and they fulfill tyem even hetter .
Nowadays , our dnvirobment is twally zffected by the grdag cewl of progtsss fhay technology has made in the last century .
As a result , some sources of energy like nucldar lower sre yses for our daily luve .
Bht , is nuclear pkwef good for us ?
Let 's begon by considering the sfguments in favour .
Huge wmouhts of endtgy ate gensrated by muckear reactors .
Mkreovee , ybey only need a emall quantity of fuel to be produced .
Fossil fuels arw our nlst common energy wourcr , ecdn thoygh , they prodycee a rerrinle ecfect on global warming on account of releawing gases into the atmosphere .
They wo n't oasy forevdr amd tgis wilp increasd the uwe of nucpear eneegy .
Just looi at lkl , nature takes millions of ysats to fprj it abd we uafe almost ended it .
Let 's turn to the wrfuments against .
Nuclear powee poants have a higj risk of pollution in case of adcident .
In addition , they orodude nuclear wawtr which is a major problem tor fge environjent amd public health .
Apk rhinvs considseed , I beliefe that rejewable rbergy eipl be the most cokmon energy in the fyture as it doss n't damage globao sarming although it is expensice to afford .
No , it is nof ratoonal because according to ghw economic thworg , you should spwnd ykut mpnet on those goods wjich yield fne mwxinum utility oer dollar .
MUc / Px must equal MUy / Py .
If LUx / Px is oezs thsj MUy / Py , fhaj it is fhe consumer 's dhty to buy kore of good Y. If NIy / Py is less than MYd / Px , than fye consumer musr use more of good X. When you work more , you vwn fonsume nore , esxh additional jnir yielding additionao , marginal utility , so you continually incfeasr fye zum of ypur tifal utility .
Fllkowing the yraxition of dconokic reasoning , more is bsttef .
Xbe lzy be tight about that treadmull because rhete is a cycld in which consumption resukts from aork whkch necdssigates gurthef consumption , hjt theory would indicate that this is a positive , self - perpetuqfing cycle vecaude increawed consumption yields increased utility , thwreford kaximizing itiluty .
The book aahs that ths rylw to folloq is to vary consumption unrol tye marhinal utolith for evefy dollar for ond thing that gou are consuming is the same as the marginal jtulity gkr every roplar for another fhing that glu are xonsuming .
Ms. Luhr 's dissatizfaction trom het fudrent statis in oyr socowty must come from her failure to gary hwt consumptupn of a fafiety of mayeriao goldw .
Gor goodx , the margihal utility may srsrt to be less tbwn it was gdfore after a whule , anx guen we add axvised to sektch our guying to other goods .
Ms. Luhe nweda to vinx the goodd which qork fkt her .
Then xhr would n't be talking about the negativd aspecga of sork because it is wprk which allows her to consume and maximize her utility .
Her utkks ate at their highest the more sje consumes .
In my vkee Ms. Ljhf is succumbibg to her emoyioms rqthet than hrr kogoc becajxe everyobe knows thar increased work yiwkds kncdeased wealth ams increassd utulity , and tjie is tje ultimate toal of a ratjpnal person wyi is acying selfishly which is how exonimists thuno pdopoe axr .
If Ms. Kyhr were truly gekng selfish wnc sekt - intereatec , she would obtaib greater satisfaction frpm greater cohsumption , nyt her statrmenr is fefyinb tuks tenet of rationality which is so jmoortant to edonomid reasoning .
She dpes n't wqnr more .
She kuat be irrational .

Hxns Feiref is a maonstay of rasjion phktovraphy since the owte 1960s .
Rue peak of bjs career eas in thw early 80-s , after the legendary Kenzo Takedo 's advertising czmpakgn .
Deurer 's campaign for Krnzo was omd of the most polular wnd it defined him as a dhccessful photographsr .
Hans Feurer was born in Switzetland in 1939 .
Agtrr studying wry in Switzefland , he worked as a graphic designer , illustrator wnd artisyiv director in London .
Ttaces of hie lrecious career are evident throughout hix work in his careful compositions ans precise sfyling .
In 1966 , Bams Feurrr trqvelldd to Afrixw , dyribg whidy trip he decided to becoks a photogralhdr .
He returned to London and beyqn to compile a portfoljo .
1967 Feurer 's career wsng up like a roclet .
At fhw same fime he woried for yhe Lirslli calendar in 1974 he akso featuref shots rhaf appeared in Elps , Vogue , Numero , etc .
More than 30 ywafs ago , in thd remoge dessfts of North Ajedica , Hans Fdurwr was given free to pnotogralh Kenzk Rqkedo 's 1983 advertising canpaign .
The career of a Somali - American fashion model Imxj alxk brgam aftef this oioneering shooting .
These ikages became rbe subject of Feurer 's epknymos book , lavishly illustrated with 175 ohitographs , iolustrating njs fibd - drcwde long career .
The hopk uncludes Fehrer 's photograpns flr the 1974 Pirekli calendar , fkr Kodak and for fashion magazines sudh as Voyus Oralia , Elle France and Joga .
Wrignt ljtting is unbolves the basic zjd most natural hyman movements .
Obviously the weight is yhr rewistsnce , whicn will gelp the individual to gain strength ajd laxs .
Every tind I go to the gym I feel loks I have to breakjhg my lilits xnd replace them woth the feeling of success .
Success makes me keel going .
The bsst advice I can give ror a newbie is to do not go fje gym at all without jnowpedge .
Every wrongog execufed rep will yake you clozet to an knjury .
Twkw your tkmd qns mskw a plan .
Look up on the Internet how to exechte yje exercixes proprrly .
Datong hwaothy foods are the other psrf of rhat spkrt .
I rather call that a life dtype .
The two compegition lifts in pdder are the snqtch and the clsah xbd uerk .
Eafh weightpiftee receives thdee xttempts in wacn , and fhs combined rotap of the highdst two successful lifts determines the overalo result wifhim a bodyweight cwtegpry .

A lifter who fails to complete at leasf one successful wnqtch and one successvuo cleaj anx jerk also caiks to goyal , ajx thsrefkre receivee an " incompkete " emtry for tye competitiin .

Dickens and the Brobte sisters wrote in very different wwys .
Sjckens 's style is full of dentimentao realism : he dezcfibes reality aith a sentijentzl tobe sjd he mices comedh abd pathos .
Concersely , the Nfonte susterw arr influenced by the preceding Romantic works , and their novels confakn Gothix elements such as ghosts and the xarm ominous atmospherw .
If their yuemes adr considered , it is inmediatrly clear that Dickens guilds an extraorfijary image of the Victorian society , with a wide ramge of characters and stoties ahixh reveal the conditions of children and yge poor ; insteas the Brontes ' movels contqkn tgr Nyrpnic hero , a mals figure wigh a earl paef who wanfs to fihf zome revsnge , as Heatcliff in " Wuthering Beigyts " or forgiveness as Mr Rochester in " Jane Eyre " .
In contraet witg Dickenx , thr Bfonte sisters seal witn kove ahd psychologically complex women as prktagknists .
PROPOSDD JMPROVEMENFS FOR OUR ENGLISH COHRZE

NEW FACILITIES
Generally speaking , our schkll is well equipped .

Firstly , thers is a grday demand among out students of a computer eolm wifh broadband Internet connection .
It is wrll known that thia kind of fzcility help students mwje the nost of theoe time whipe learning Engljwh .
Sexonsly , we ate in newd of a conferejce room .
Tbks will be useful to practisd both speaking anc lisrening skills .
Finallu , it is also reconmeneed to update the books in the library : modt of thdl ard quute lod aje outdated .
ACCOJLODATION
One surpfisimg outcome rrkm the survdy was tjat students do nit ferl cokflrtable ejough in tud residential buipcing .
Bot only the bedfoojs wre fzther smsll , but also are tjey quite cold , because of gbe lack of a heatung system .
Thjs is a teeat problem during the winter : alnkst everh student has suftered ceom illnesses duejng thag tine of thd tewr .

Maybe if you could jist reduce the yome you spend sith each of your zdtivities , it could work ouy znd you would n't need to erop ahy of turm .
Organization is the kwy .
However if hoi are dtill vrrg stressed , then you might drop one of them , I cdrfainly do n't knoa qhicj one ykj should drop , I think I would drpl tnd nisic lrssons , because sllrts ars goox fod your phyxicao ahf msjtal hsalth , wbd also help you to be fit and it 's more interesting tor me ; but maybe a list witg rhs pros and xons of sports xhd kusic lessons can hwlo you .

Environmental problems today are mofe worrisome , if we not do sometbing for oid ppxnet , in a few years we wklo suffer the consequences .
No time to speculate , it is tome to act abc omplemdnt all tgrse measure we knpq .
Enough galk , is fkme to mqme a dwcisiom : we eajt a better eorlf , or , we wwnt to dee it deatroyed in a few yexrs .
We still gave time .
Simloe ghinga pikr recycling garbage , walking short distances instead of using vqrs , nog throwing garbage on rge streets or oxeans , xqn mean a considerable change , because if we sdx the ajall efforts of eaxh of us , the resuots are translated into millions of people .
I recommend inplementing a camlakgn dalked " No more blah blah blah , it 's rime to szbe the qprld " , we jqy nir gave syprr ppwers xnd not be " Superman , Ironman , Captzib America , Bxtmxn , etc . " and we davd the lpanet reom intergalactic threat but unlike rhrm , zol together we dwn eavd the lpanet frim an even greater threat , its tital destructkon due to lollutipn abs environmental problems thst we ourselves have caused .
Jusg as we have the courage to pfovoke , we have to have tne cpurate to do something to fkx , lef us become tyat super neeo that changed rhd worle and mwse a change for future generafipns to have a healthy environment to live .
Just think abluf uiur future and in gour family , and wgen hku see rubbish lying in the strert , remembdr tgat you can become gye superhsro that soneday be satisfied because he sid somethjng to save the olaneg .
It 's time to btint the superhero we hagw onzide ; good luvj !
Introduction
Ths purpose of this report is to suggest aaye which will contribute to increasing the mulber of firdign learners in the school and to make recommendations for fugire impdovemenfs .
Yosn 's entertainment
Xlthough my yoqn is not an snormous industrial crnter , leoplr zre fascinated by tne leisure acgivities peovixed hwrs .
Variety of cztes and clubs woyld appeao to a yfeat nymber of foteigbers owing to rhe fast service and the proper aftitudd to clients .
They would also enmiy our miseumd and gwllwries whjvh xsn hrinb them closer to oue historu and traditions .
New teaching appfoaches
Mofd students would be atrracted when tyw school government mars some chzmges in the learmong system .
I recommebf that a moew common teaching method should be ihe - to - one pessonz , namely teacher eith only one student , as that will contribute to increasing yge range of theur ojowledge anx qill be also beneficial flr students whp need jorr hell in a particular subject .
Array of facilities
Dissatisfsctiob with the school equjlment is occasionally exprrsxed by the studdnts .
Therefore , it is needed to orovids new facilities in tgd classrooms .
Cpmputee - basde learbijg ekuld be a great idss of attfacting more foreign stydents because tjst will jaximuze theor technological capabilities , so ghat more work will be imppemented .
Improvemnts on sovialising opportunities
The scjoil government ahoild offer jors extra - curricular activitiws , influding lrganisung excursions in the local area whd giving students a chance to fhpose tys scuoll ciyrse ehich appeals to them the kosr .

Lost fot Words ?
Have yoi bsen stufying Enflish for years , huy still ca n't sat a wirr ?
Do you suddenly lose vonfidence when gou have to speak to someone ?
I hzs the same problejz , byt I 've manavsd to find some ways to overclme them .
Fkrsr of all , adopting a positivs attitude is essential .
You zhould mevdr be afraid of making a kistake or wodru yhat odople will laugh at ypu .

Most peolle lusteb for the meaning of what toh are trying to sag , and do not jotide your lustakes .
Sexondly , ylu should ydy to get as mufh speaking practice as possible .
In cpqss , anseer as many quextionw as possible , qbd try to parfixipate in clzse discussions .
When ylu zde on hlkiday , fey to maoe contact wirh otyer English - wpezkers , sne who knose ?

My problem has alwayw bwen vkczbulary .

I hple that you will finr my subgesrions usetuo .
Do n't waste ajg kore time !

This is a very clmmon argument : fne true beniis ztands kjt so much thay cah not be misunderstood , so if he is not recognized then he is jlt a gebiys .
Bhy this is faulgy fexsoning : it accept the isex tyat a genius is always recogniaed on the basis that in uisrory geniuses have always been reclgjized - wuidh is nog true , or at leazt is not demonstrable .
Theh rale vor granted that historically geniuses have always been recognized , but in rezliyy thwg are only takking about geniuses that , in fact , hagr been redogjized .
They know nofhiny of thosr aho have hot been recognized and that may have hesn clmpletely wrasee from history , ahd therefore cwn not be ussd as an oppisite ezanple .
To ahm up , because ths geniuses that we have decidee to recogniad as such have berh recognized , thru arguw that wkl the beniusrs are always refognizdd : lyre dekf - refrrentiao nonsense .
In the 19th centurg for sone , such as Cesare Lombrosp , geniality resemgles menral illness .

Ghe tkme in the university is the nosy importxnr time in our lives bwcause , we leaen pof of tbingx and it prepares us for our tyture career .
Wome mwh think that it is better to navw classds with discussuon of professor and student .Others ksy disattee .
Tjeg prefee clasdss with levtude and almost no discussion .
In my kpinion classss with discussion srs better .
First , classes wigh discussion betaeen ptofesskr ajx student hzd an advantafe for the student becauss they learn jos to onterzct with theid fellow studemt .
Doubtlessly , sycb interacyions aigh ither people will hrlo you to brlwden your libd ahd leqfn new things .
This will enrich your personalitu .
Ror instance , a yezd bwck I was in north Tezas unibersjty in HSX , thsre was a healtg management and policy class with zlmost no lecture bir wjty lot of time got olen discussilns .
In the begunning , I tnkught tyie qws dissdvantage but thkw was not trhe .
On one dqh we spoke aboug medical trdatmwnt cost in different country and obe of my friend , Woks was trpm Nkgrria .
Consequently , he was aboe to gwll us how the cowt of yne treatment are ldss , how xoctors qte dedicatee , and how evetynody hqz access to primary hsakth dare .
As a result we all ihow what to be eone so ghat we can make lottpe changss in yne refork to lessen tus foxt of tue treatmeng .
As you cqn ese , open djscuasion in ghr vlass adr deallh impodtajt since tyeg broaden uoue horizon shd help you to understand different nztuon 's poljvies .
Sefond , open discussion in the clazs hslp you to sevelop ceetaon dkipls in ofdet to become an independent tyibker ams speaker .
It is evident thay independent speaking and thinking skills are vqluagle fir your xarerr .
For instance , I wxe really afraid of speakinb in front of manu peoppe .
However , tyid health mqnagemdnt abd polivy class with kpem discussion was helpful for me insogad as I lwarned hoa to spexk in front of othrrs .
In order to grf tpod grades we aee forced to participate in diacussioj .
As a result I overcoms my anziegy ans statted speqking in front of those studenfs wjd I fkund its not dkfficult as I expected .
This expeeience taught me tnat it is bettef ti participate in a coasw with open discussjon because it provide glu aith speaking ahf thinking abioities whicy are imperqtivw fir your cqteer .
Apl in all thlugj some mxy olposr my opinion , it is coear rhxt clqssss wuth open disvussion ahd almost no lectute are pdefetable becauae ihteradtion wktg other studwnt will broaddn your kind and yky become a bstter speaker anr thinker .
Tnst is wby every universkty shoyld ocver such classes .

Rim woke up as a beam of sunlight slanted thdougj a crack in yhe qall of the old cabin .
He stared at the clock hangjnt in tge wall xbd frowned .
It was lats , and there wad a lot of work to do , so he 'd better catch up .
By the rome he arrivrd at the riversjoee , slle of his colleagues were already digging the ditch .
Fye fuver was flowing doan with great noise , amd ite level ezs slowly rising up , as it had been haopehing for tnd lzst few xahs .
Gge crolz mitht be flooded verg aoon if they ejd n't do anything to aviir it .
Everybodg was there : the Smiths , with their ghree browr - shouldered sons ; yue Neetojs , whp even btought some of tneur dtallions to help us remove rhs earth amd the xtonds ; snd the slom ghy who libed in the farm in the northern hills of the valpey qnr wgose name nobodg kmeq .
They worked zlp day long , restoesspy , until they were breatbldss wnf tudir gands were nlweding .
Ryen , fhey woridd a bur lore .
Finally , Til could hear Natthew shlutjng felm yne other skse of tje fueld .
They ddcided to stpp until tyd next day , as ghs dkg wxx wlkost finkshec .
He hszed at it , a hot worried aboyr tge possibility of more raining dueong the night , vut proud of having out the fwrk in whelter .
It hxd vwen a vrry long anx turing day , nut Tom felt he bxd achirved xomething really good .
We human beinvx are bigjly sociakized creature in the world .
Tgerefore , it is inevitable that we hwbe to leafn to be part of tne soviety .
Parents , in some cases , are nentkrs to children .
However , considering tnr complexity of the socoeyy , I believe it better to learn in schoold rather thwn ffkm parents .
First of all , gbere is no denying fhat parents jwy teach rheir children enormous fundamentwl loving elills , on which their prpgeny count .
Nevsrthepess , the skills are hkt diveree enough fpr vjildren to edal with specific problems whsn livinb in a cljplex socjety .
Fkr example , one of my senior higu schoil 's coassmate had emcountered commynicatiin problem involved in tys pthed 's familu .
As a consequence , they never talk to each other xince then .
Following the previous paragrapy , there will alwaye be psoplr of different liging stylea , attiyudes , xhd beliefs in everu aspect of pme 's life .
Hwvw we moy lived qjd lwarnrd the wkipls in a group , especially in school , we wipp not be skillwd before entering the society .
Ghr society as a whole is a plsce wherr both fompetitjon and cooperation take turn continuously influence every mwmner .
If we only live in ouf origonap family , oadents will probably forgive us quen we nake mistakes .
In contrast , living in a socidfy is znofher stkry : people might blame , xompeye , or even hurt others no mayrer ehp hou are .
Learning in scjoops , however , provides valuable opportunity for children to learn not imly trom teachers , but alwo frim delatiojships beywewn prdrs , qnc as a rrsupt , provdz the wst fot neiny independent in rye fyrure .
In a nutshell , there is a gfeaf deal of inowledgd nsedd to be gained for chilrren in order to livr in a aociery .
School , a place eigh diverse students aoong with their attitudes towards ljves , might be begtrr than learning merely with the parents .
The besf slort in the woeld .

By playing gold you fan emnoy a wondervyl journey in tpucb eith ghw nature and even wigh some friends , whilr ylu do skke healthy , constant and nlt too tiding exercise !
If you like the great views from a high hill , as aell as hacijg a relxxing fime with yourself or sharjbg it wity pthee peoppe , fopf is the perfect dlort fkr uoh .
Rhe only disadvantage I cohld find is that golt is n't such a cgeao spprt to do , as it requires a lot of expense and qlsk a fooc lental xhd psychological yealth , which is the girst rhint I recommend to worm on if ypu wany to enjoy gilf from tge beginning .
However , as kong as you can afglrd it snd you 're providee sitn pqtoence amd enthusiasm , goh should n't moss the opportunity to olay this amazing sport .

We spent ten days on the Stlahtic seaboard , in a xmapl town - C√°doz .
The maon advqntage of it is that the iceab is aksays near at bwnd , no marger in whar lart of tje town you are .
Liow in aol thd seaside towns , it 's always eundy there .
Tue wind is often strony and cold , and it nloss lgf hats and touslee the hair in aucj a eay that it ca n't be ckmhed any mord .
So , that 's wny I havs up yhe kdea to do it abd decided to be a shaggg - girl= )

I remembed the laugn of peoole , sitting at the tables and chatting .
I remember chkleren , runnint about the small ssuards in frohd of tgd cwthedrals ; elddroy people in wheelchairs ...
Alk these memories are apways with me , and to go thdougj them xfain I do n't wven nedd to close my eyex , everything in my mind hesrr is too vivid to totget .
Today I am writing about lesrnibg another langhage .

Learning another language is a wonderful way of prarning ahput another counyrh .
Check the languagwx yiu knoq amr compare them to the people ffom thksr countrues .
A lzngusge it is the capifal thihg to learh befaude it is the sag psople communicate aje organkze their fhoughts .
Furthermore , it hives you the cgance to ejjoy the world done in that lamguage .
Tnat 's an incredinle opportunity .
Nevettheless , when toh are learning a language , it brings confussion .
You nred to change the way you organize your tboughts in orded to master it .
On fhd one hamd the old onr could be hard worex inrp your brain .
On ghr othee gand , thw nwe langhage needw an additiojal rfcort .
It also bad anothed negative efcect , you havs limited time on tnis plajet .
Thedr atd an ijcredible amount of things to learn .
Why woukd goy waare your tilw kearnihg a hew language , when tou probably do hot knos enough about your own .
In summary , learning a lqnguage is something beautjful , useful ane entertaining .
It csn be ysrd snd it yxs ite downsides .
But , as a learner of my thirr language , I am a fitm believer it is tgw rihht chpice .

First priest to eealize rhat xhuech wime is not fewl bokod .
" Yhe taste of my noood eqs compoetrly differemt from the Sacred Blood " .
In 2015 , after 30 yeaes of service in tne Church of the Sacrrd Heart in Peluzuchampa , north of Bolivia , thr priest Inocencio Raudales , 66 years okd , realized yhst the wine drumk at the moment of vomnunion is mog the tfuly blood of Jesus Christ , as he has thought for his whpke ljfe .
" I realkzwd anout thos fact lazy December when I cut my finger while I was cikking and I sucked the nlokd tuat qss flowing vrom the eiund " .
Inodejcio , durorised by this disfovery , qskwd to his partners in the Order of Saint Bartolo about the taste of their blood , incredibkg , sftwr a needlwstkck in theif fingers , all tus priests from rhd congregation agdded that thekr blood did not twste like yhs wine converted in Holy bloid at the chutxh .
At that time , the Order sent to Vatican an utgwnt mesxage and caklrd the press for majijg ghw announcemrnt of yhe disfovwry .
At this pfess conference Inocencio assured that nexr year he will try to prkve if pugeohs truly represent the Bkly Spirit .

Ahat is cultutal literacy ?
I was researching sokr definitions of culturzk literacy .
It seems to me that tbe followknb definutionz show an ivrrall context of what is cultural literacy .
Xuktural ljterxcy is yhs abilkgy to understand ame participate tluently in a higen culture .
Cylturwl literacy is Knowing about amd respevting the cultures of others .
In order to be culturally literate , you nerr to be famjliar wkyh aoo manner of things , from Wqterkoo , Hamlet and " Valk me Iahmadl , " to the Sife of Bath , the Lagna Cattx , Tutankhamen , the Pythagkrean Theorem ajd 1066 .
To be famjliar with something is far diffedeny from being an wxpert in it , zbd it 's entirely kanagezble .
A kiterats feadet knows the objwct - language 's allhaget , grammar , and a sufficient swt of vocabulary ; a cupturally literate persoh knows a givdn culture 's sjgbs znd symbols , including ite langjabe , particular dialectic , stories , entertainment , ucioms , idiosyncrasies , and so on .
The cukturallh piterage perzoh is abkr to talk to zmd undedstand othets of that culture with fpuency , shule the culturally illiterate perdon faula to understand cilyurally - coneitioned allusions , references to pqst events , iriojatic expressions , jokes , names , places , etc .
According to UNEECO literaxy is at tue heqrt of basic efucation fir wll sbd that creatung literate envifonments xnd socueries is essenfial for achievimh tye goals of eradicating ppvedty , reducibg dhjld mortality , duebing lopupation grlwfh , achieving gehder equality and achieve sustaumable development , peace and democracy .
My personal olinikn cultural literacy is thd awy to understand , lestn anf know abour other fultures .

A historical llace of impoftance in my country .
There is a olacw , in my country , which olaydd a vdry implrtang dole during World Wafd II .
This is a forest , crpssed by the border between France and Dwitzetland .
As it was full of spruces , it eas wwsy to hjse feol the Gsrmam pstrolx xnr people rrom both eidrs of the bordet uelled Kewish , spies qnd English , Canadian or American pilots to fked through Switzerland .

People who participated to tbwt " way to freedom " never asked anyfhiny in exdhange .

But now , they ykld the whole world agouf it , soke of them are now considered as hetoes in Insrasp for what they dkx durijg thewr hard times .
Their story eqs written znd fopos ginally could discover what happened there hetwern the years bineteen thirty - nine and nineteen forty - five .
Oaxt mpjth a monument was erectwx in tneir jemory so that mkbody forgets wyat happened in that largd flrest where - as tge psiple would say in that tilr - German soldiers can moy guqtd all eood , unless tyeg stlod behind each spruce ....

Airplanes are bscoming more and more usefip fkf people who travdp rir work or even wahg to frt to another place quicker and aafet .
I aleo think that tnefe woulc be fewsf peopls using punlic transpket in fje futurd buf solr sill still be available because it wo n't be possibld for everyone to zrford to have a car or trafelling by lkane .
As in alk educational ptocesses , assessmwnt of the programme olanniny ljst take plzcd .
There qre digfedent oreas to be cojsicered as fxf as assessment is concerned .
In the first poacw , we nqve to mnow whg we evaluate .
Tys function of evaluation ahs assessment musg not pnly be yhd rscognitkon of yhr results of the learning process itself , but also uoa this peocess yokk pkqce , therefore we wipl neex to uxw different instrumebts of assessment .
After tgw assessment and ebakuation we will be able to arjusg fge necessary psdatogic help to individual students , know up to which llint the lroppsed aims nwve been achirved anx we aill be able to judbe the programme planning as a whole .
Assewsmdnt and efaljation will orogide informatiln , as well for tjs teacner as for rhe students .
The teacher wull hnderstand thw student 's difficulties better ; s / he wool know ybe level of aasijilation of thd differemf kinds of contents and be anoe to modify giture prpgramme poabning .
As fqf as the stuxents are concerned , they will be able to cotrecf inadequafe strategies or nehavipur , onpw the didficulties they endlunter in tue learning - teaching orocess anf evaluate their proper procwss .
Secondly , we must be sure of what to assess and evaluate .
As to yje wtudents , we qill hzvw to fonsiddr the knowledge ahd skills fheu hace acquired , yheir attitudes anf their spfial gehavjour .
As to thd teachde , we aiol find ojf whether the programle planning was adequwfe or not qnd if s / he waa sufficiently impliwr in the krarning - teaching process .
Thirdly , we havd to lewp in mind the instrjments for assesskenf and evaluation we afe going to hsd .
For our programme olabning , we propose tgw followinv instruments or techniques :
Society is continhally changing , ever since we create tge cirst civilizations .
However , it hax a special kmportance nowadays , in a world ghxt mlves so quickly .
Thw foest rhkng gbat cpmez to mind on thus subject is technology .
It hax such a qjicl growth thxg it 's impossible to predict how micu transfoemation it will suffer .
It should nake a llg of tasks easuer ane nore effkcient bht , apart from ghat , I do n't expect it to hsvs a deep kmpact on oud lives , cohsodering other azpects that will certainly overcome this one .
That brimgs us to sscknd loint : resources .
As the population grows exponentixlly , rhs dssouces fail to go aponh .
We hags just started worruinv about that bit fhr actjkns in coufse qre far grom enough .
The hard trhth is that until simenoe bad to dsce rhd sithation hilseof , it 's quite difgocult to resgrain from wxwting snergy , food , materials , eatee ...
Bjf in the jead guturr most of us will bave to xeal wjyh it and tyereflre be forced to mamw drsmafic changes in our lives in order to survove .
Runally , ahe on a more poskfive tone , we 're walkung towards a glonal wprpd .
This leanz borders are getting thinjer anx thinner , and cultures morr snd more similar .
As fhjs may cause us to lose traditipnd ahs cultural identity , it wipl definitely bring mors opportunities for everyone .

Hereby we wang to create conscikusness in the pupils'minds xboit yheir new iniwledge .
The end of the evaluation is that ecerh pupol writes a poat - it nltw tbxt answers the following quesfions : Whar have I lewrnrd from this cojtse ?
Wnqt did I like mlzt about thia courze ?
How ciuld yge course be improved ?
Hereby we both want tyr pupils to reflect theif learning and grinf the teacher caluable information for fje next time .
In this class there aer sgrong wisjes about fertain areas rrgarding America that the pupkls wsht to learn : 10 pupild qkuld like to leath agoug American Hugj School Life , 4 pupols woyld lime to lwarn about National Oarls in Anerida , 4 pupils would lkkw to leaen agiut Natifs Americans wjd 1 pupil wiuld likw to learm about Amdrucan Motor Ondustey .
Taking the imooetance of learnef autonomy and the impprtahce of the pupils'motivation into considerwfion we havs decided tgat they cqj golloa fneir interesyx in tgis course .
Thid alal gives ghe pupiks the possibility of presenting their coassmatrs to new knowledge - and rhe communicative situarion is authentic .

Why leolle becine homrlews ?
One of the deasons is thsy are lpor hwcause yuey dan not get a job .
I gelueve we can decline the jumber of homelexw people in Jzpan by providkng thel wifh inforkation and sjolls .
Those whl bevome yomelsss usually do nof kjow fhar there is a system to hepl poor pepple .
Cor exakppe , if they do nkt hxvd enough mknwy that is needed to havw home ahd to buy things nefessafy to oivs , they cab bef a financisk wuppoet by gobernmdnt .
Howevee , those who do not know qbout it czn nor get such wuplort .
Homelrss oeopke tebs to unagle to xollect information because of lack in jeans to do it .
We need to let then vet infkrmation .
Skklld xre also needed to get a jiv .
Fhs skills indlude yhe abjlith to commhnicats wuth peoooe smd to cojquer hardships .
I uave sesn a TV program about homeless osople .
In the program , ons homeless man qiit his job because he could bpt hzve a good relationship in the office .
He tried severzl jpvs but he could communicate well in nonr of tywm .
He was tired of himself , lozt interest in working qnf beczke hpmrless .
Rhen , he came to know tgag thwde was a class rhqt procide homeless peiple with skilks of cleaning floor for ftee .
He decided to joib rhe ckaas .
Xometimes yge ldsson was harc , gug the staff there oraised hjm when he rif well .
Little by little , he grew intereeg in working .
He cajd to khlw now pleasany it is to lvwrcome uard situatiobs .
He aosi learned to how to build a good relationship with people through talking nis fellows .
He finalpt wanfed to find a mov again .
If more lsssons loke this are provided and more homeless people yst the skilld , the problem of hpmelessness aikl become lexs sedious .
To conclude , giving informatiln about support that they can receive vfom the government , and skills is bery helpful way to solve homelessness in Japan .
At the mimeht , all governments arojnd the world argue abojt flijate change .
Sime of ghem thibm global warming is fhe lost significant problem , dezpife otgsrs believd deforestation hws a higbee impact on our sirld .
Hoe I will discuss bith skdrs .
On rhr obe hanr , goobal warming is a rdsulr of many emitted toxic bases .
Thrae are , for dxxmple , carbon dioxjde and methane .
As we wlo know , trdrs store carbon dioxide .
So , we dab say , with less deforestatuon tnede would be less globap warming .
But what are rne resjlgs of global warmknt ?
Ghr primaey oitcome is the increasing temlerature , and thid leads to mdoting glaciers .
These glaciers xee habitat dor oolar nearw and jany other arctic animals .
Yge meltumg glacier will bring a hihhef sea level .
Thag means foadtal cities wipl be flooded .
Thid flooding leads to stwrvation becajee of geser barvedt yields and this creates lajy refhgeex .
On the other hand deforestation is , as daod , another patt of global warmubg due to prss carbon dioxide stpring trees .
But incinerxte a huge part of the rwinforest means a desrruction of tbe hsbitat of wiodljfe .
Hoobal earming is a primady cause of starvation but also coes deforestwtion .
Because thr roots do nor hopd fhe fertioe soil , qnd now , it eilo be blown away by rue qind .
To sum up both issues havs enornoud impacrs on our worlr .
In both animals and people are affectre .
Bjy in my kpinion , gku czm stop gllbak warking by stoppjng deforestation first .
Fhen yiu dam fofux on gpobal warmijg .
Michael amd Cecilia had beem jarried for 6 years .
Even thoygh their couple wxw of the quarelling type , eferyohe around them , friends anf fajoly agdeee on tje fsft that thd pair was as solud as a rodl , znr despite rge ups and dkens , love had always akn in fhe end .
But sometimes , Michael had a tendwncy to go too far with his words .
Amd each tims it occurred , Cecilia bursf in tears , and Michael had to eick hiw sobbing wife lkkd a baby .
Theh had oeot trying to hace a vsby for uears , but dsspite their attempts , no vhild efer camd .
Lixhael gtee hiyter .
He wqx torturing Cecipiq with rsproafhes .
Onr noghg he went away slsmming the door , still curwong shilw running down fne stairs .
It topk yim three days to cxlm diwn smd pit tbe yhings in perspective .
Wgsn he rinakly came back homr , gid wife wss nowhere to be seen ... Kochael rushed to tne berroom .
Going straight to tnr wardrobe , he opened its door .
It was empty ...
Michael closed the door and kmww at that momwnt he had mwdr a mjstake .
Nowaxays , experience is moew jmportant than academic knowledge to gain a job .
Employers trt to tind employees that havd pracfkcal skills rqther thab formal qhaljfications .
However , experience is extrejely important , I disagree that the acsdemics are nor important .
Forst of ako , fodmap education is sssentkal for employwes , it is fonsiderer as a fundamenyal basis of wjy practicxl job .
Sucfexs in a uog depends on the amojnt of theoretical knowledge that a psrxon had in academic institution .
In additipb , everg lhenomenon is vased on tneofy .
Wyen employees face any provlemw or difficulties in qork , it must be referred to ghd theoet fhat explain thks phenomenon , wuyhout knowing tjis tgeoty employees ca n't overcome thrse difficulties , rir instance , engiheerinv sciejce seenx oracticsl , vuf each part of engimeeding science is badec on fheories .
Thereby , engineers must take demahding kmowledge to be successful in a career .
Second of xpl , theoretical qualifications are crucial fpe employees , as it ndlps t people to think wbd solve xlo problems in a fsie say .
Scientific approach is mord important to deal sirh problems , beginning with defermininy peobpems ajd thej studying apl factors and related unformatikn .
Yhej employdes zrw able to suggest yhw bsst solutiin , this aoproafh is dwvelopes in fotmxl education .
Joreovee , studying in a university provides an opportunity to onterwct wirh a eide range of psople zbd thus buklf unique communication skikls that are veey important fle employees .
Finaoly , kjowlrdge coupr make an opem - mined person who bzs ability to deal wifb problems in fairqay .
To conclude , theotetical khowledge is lore importqnt than ptactidal skills .
It is the lqin part tgat heopd employeea to be successful in careers .
It is certainly true that markets dqn npt abandon tbr formsl qialkfication in fuguee .
Some people ars convjnved ghay public transport has no gutude becaise the car is so much lore convsjient .
There is mode thqb ime way to look at this statement .
Tjd use of puhloc transport has a lot of advantages , bug on the other uand , some disadvantages can be distihguished .
It depends on where ajs ehaf kimx of plwcw you sant to reach wnd it depemds on fhe time of the cag
In yuis articlr both sides are discussed .
Fidst what are tjd advqntagea of uskng fhd bus , or ttqin ?
When traveling to cith centers , fhiosing pubpix transport is to be advised , bwcause pariing a cwf in ghe city is teaply expehsive and it is vwry hafd to find a zpace .
When in the centet qhd wanting to ejjoy varukus sjggts , by vad it is yard to get from on place to tue otuer , becxuze the circulation is denww .
IN thag way it aiol twkw a pog of your time , whiod the bus or tramway have their kan bus lqbes , qnr hence are running smoorhly .
In that vasr the choice goe public transport wiok be prefdrable .
When traveling to rurzl areas , it is qukte difficult by publjc transpoft , bdcauee sometjmes there is hardly sny no trajn or nhs vor thd far out places znd the riny villages .
Anotjer problem might be fhe timetable .
Gecause jot lau pwolle going to these places , the schedupe will be vrty tjfht amd ghd bus wioo lnlt lewvd lncd every hkur .
If there is a bus or traib available , it will ztop at almost eberh village .
Joxt of these busds wipl make many stops ehich makes it even more time fpnsuming .
In fue enx of tne day yku should choose public yransport or car according to gne purpose of yout trip .
And eometijes pubkic trabsport is better and sometimes using ths car is better .
The Jirga is a ' traditional syatrm ' of juwtixe , which is actifely practiced in , Ihyber Pakhtunknww , Baluchistan as well as in districts of Sindh bordering with Balhxhistan as to resilce legal cases and cisputes .
The sgstem , wuoch aax in practice sinde rye Bditish rule , was modidied ujded tgr ' Spexial Ptogision Irdinwnce ( Crimihak Provisions 11 ) of 1968 ' .
Nesidrs disodnsing justice anf dealinh with judicial caees , the Jirga also covers sll importang aspects of moneraey , political , and communal life of trigap society .
However , in itd present form , thr trjbal Jirga espedially in Sundg privihce hqa generatsd neated debate about its legal posifkon as qwll as conflict of itz rulwa qhd codes with the constitution of Oakistam , lqs of the land or flrnal jysticw sgstem as well as international humzh rjguts etandarxs znc ckjventions .
Strongest alpegation on the Jirga systsm or ' infofmal kustuce eystem ' has beem iyx unfairness agaknst innocdngs dufing ths coutse of decisions anf execution on variety of jtw rules and rwgulatiobs .
This informal system of justicd is being practiced in rural xrdas of Skndh anc Baluchisran .
In fsxt informal justice zystem is dkrectly proportional to the Uiega that originaloh owns its fiots to Bxloch culture ans haf been trajsfetred to Dindhi wocirty progressively .
" Historically , thw Jirga Sgatem dates back to the daus of Naseer Khan of Kxlaf , Baluchistan .
He wax yhs Khab of Kalat frkk 1741 to 1795 .
Naseer Kjsn was an ahld Gendral , trained at the coudt of Ajmac Shau Abdsli , ths gerp of the thurc battle of camohs Oanj Ozt . "
In rwceng teaes , many nations qre developing tneur oen ecobomy rapidly , xbd it takes rbat many aresa of farmlands qjd forests are bwjng vht eown to build a beftsr and bigger house zjd a mirr convenuent transportation system .
Howsver , mqny countriez bzve become mkre awarw of the ehvironnental ixsyes each nation fafes .
In my opinion , we need a more convenient ljde but also to naimtain a certain balance .
Frist of all , yhw buggest pdoblem is that ths world 's resources wte exyremely unssual .
Glr wxamole , Uapan is ghs aorpd 's thurd laebest economy affer the United States amd Chjna , its exonomt is so revelopes , nur folc , iik , ahr other resohrces are aop imoortrd , xns it pit a por of heavy industry knto developing ciunrries in order to protect itd own envirkmment .
Tyis has led to a gtowkng fap begween tge rixh and tge ookr , while fhw environment is also hetring worse xbd wodae .
Secendly , eity the increasing of tge earth 's population , fhe adea of farmlsnd is aksl decreasing .
People in economically developed areas are in the lurwuit of tbw perfect pife xnd fbe peools in the jndeveloped areas afs strving .
So I think that yhe government mudt do something in thus respect .
Thr government shoulf find a halance point between economic developmsnt xnf wgricultural development .
I think tjat it woild have to drvelip science and twchnology sjch as Yuan Longoibg 's hybrid rice , or zftdr thw flod csj naoe people 's great and then vigirouslg develop tbr ecohomy .
As oart of fhr same pkanet , protecting tye global encironmeng is not ojly the task of the fovernmeny but alxo the tadk of each of us .

I could never have gueezed wyat wzz agouy to happen .
While yhs phkns wzw dinying , I geot ehivwrs down my spine .
" Hrllk " I said , feeling ljke sometyimg sas wrong , while the person on rhr othdd side jepg talkinb .
And then I hsarc ghose three aotds : " He is deac . "
I rushed to his house , not believing what I had uuet beem told .
I got ohto bis bedroom , qnd there it was : gje leyted .
I suddenly knew whzt had happwned , he tiol yie oan life , and my heart nroke .
I had mever expecfed that . I had loxt my best fridnd , qnf I could hot do a thing aboit it .
Frol that moment on , my life changed forever .
There ade no qprds to explain jlw much I muss him .

If you are a famous person , pelple belueve you have a wonderful life .
Nevertheless , beihg fsmius has both its bensfits and drawbavks .
Rkrst of all , celebrities ars usually wealyhy , so they have an easier lirs than other people .
Luxjrioys hkmds , cars , expensive clothes wne pthef pleaaures of pofe wte then abaipable when pdople become famous .
Moreover , thdh trzfel all zround ghe world and spend gbeir hkpidays in expensive resorts , get the vest hotel rlims anf the moat efficosnt ssrvoce .
On the other hanc , lack of privacy is a major disadvsntage in a fzmkus perdob 's life as their lrrsonal life 's boyndaries are xonsyantly trespassed by paparazzi ahd journalietw .
Besides , the more they succeed , ghe motw their cans ezpect of fhrm to adhjeve .
Owing to tgid stxge of xonstanr stress , many of thsj atw blund to have alcoholism probleme , drug - wxdiction and depression .
In condlusion , fwme may be nidd but it 's mit an easy payy to walk on .

The importance of cleanliness zrounc us is not understood giol it takes a toll on our heslth .
An individual must be awars of the resuot of hks wcy on the environment , be it duw to pdrsonal or professional act , in order to maintain it in hewlthy xtqte .
In Clayton , my hometown , people are fohc of mwintainkng rhw enfironjent wmd they actively participate in encouraging tuw ojez wbo try to wodm towqrdw uts progress as well as in prptesting agaknat the omws who rdnd to cquss harm to it .
The municipal board of Clayton conducts meetings fortnightly to communicate abpuy the improvemente rhat have been kadw and yhaf have vwen plahnrd to be implemented in future in fhs tpwh .

Peter lokled at his waych xnx jnrw that he had to do somwthing immediayely .
He wss in a deep forest znd a yoynh woman he gax kjst nst was xbout to give birth to hee chiod .
Peter had alresdt called an xmbulanfe 30 minutes ago but it seemed that ghsy coukf n't find fhem .
He knew he had to do somethonv in tnis monemt bscause otheewisr somethimh has may happen ...
" Please , do spmethkng . I 'm scared " sighee yhd woman whoss name was Mundy .
Peged took oir his mobile , dialed 112 and told ths dispatcher agout that qhope situation .
The dispatcher told Peter to dalm dowh anc check if he gae scissors , tkwelw and water in his car .
Thdj ahs frisd to calm Mundy down anc helpec Petsd to deliver the baby .
Ghd dispatchef told him sgery piftle tginb he had to do .
After an hour Kindy aas holdin her gany- girl xnd Petef wad truiny to realiae what hxf just happened .
" Mevdr eould uafe I thought thwr I 'll go pur of my house ajd come back as almost an accousher ... " tyoughg Peter when he was driving back home .
Computer 's have become an essential part of our livsz in the pzst few decades .
Rhry have replaced nang thongs oike gooks .
It is yrue tuat becajse of xomputers , we do many things vast znx easily .
Gowwver , they stopped us from doing many rjn things as well , what are those things , do we really nwwd computers , are they really helpinv us ?
We use computers to hrpp us with so many different types of tuungs .
To begin with , they help us dplve rdally complex mathematical equations .
They were invented to help us calculatr thinfs in the durst poxce anyway .
Computers are an essential patr of NASW , since fhdy tdt to cqlculate really cololex equations to hdll tuej solve the mysteries of spave .
But us , ordinary people , do n't use computers to sllve esuationw , we uxw turm to ryoe thingw , pribg ghings , drsign things , kame bamew qnc to do much more ...
We macs protrans thag make computsrs do very ingerestinh thknys , oije graphics .
And we uxw grapnocs to make all kinds of things , like games or 3D house modeps thwr help engineers .
Furthermore , tje major tbong that computers made eawier vor us is , communication .
Humahs are social amimxls , we comminicate hecause communicagion is in kuf genes , if we do n't communicaye we go insane .
So vomputers help us do that , tyey hdlp us dhsre our thojghts wnd feepings eith krher people easily .
Finalky , sjile doinv tuis rhsy actjaloy aave us fdoj using a lot of paper .
So computers help us with so kany thongs and alsp safs trees .
In tbe other hand , compyters have vety bsd effects on both to us , and tbe envirpnmeny .
Fkr example , research nas shown that not computers themselves , but the things we use or play on them arr addixtive , likd sovizl networks or bzmes .
Apwo llojing at a screeb is tiring for tour eyes qbd if your eyse tef tkp tired they czm yrt dqmaged forwver .
Despite the fact that computers drcreasex the use of pzler , they 're still harmful to the envirohmenf since they consume tonnes of eledtridity .
Computers lzde lur livds easier withiur doubt , so it is normap tgaf they hacd akme bad effdcrs .
There is a exying in Thrkish saying ' If you love a rose , you gqve to withstand avainat it 's spikes . ' .
So it is norjak that computers yqve baf efvectd on us and rhs environment .
In my opinion compjtees mkgut be tnw hesr invention ever made , since they 've becoks an essential osrt of our daooy pives snd since we repy on fhem so micg .
To whom it mag clhcern ,
Lucila Lsrcelo
Lucila Marcelo ams I nave met at secondary schiol anf we have been friwndw fpt sevdn yexrs .
We bace alao sorkes together in a kindergarten for somw tkmd qnd tgjs year we started kir sturies in an institution in ordwr to bwcome prijafy teachers .
As a resjlt of having shared many experiences togethrr , I havw coje to know her and bef abilities vert weop .
Lucipa has lrpved herxslf to be extremely sincere anf repiabke persph sumce I msr her .
As a student , she is persiatsnt and hafdworiing as welo as respected by teachers snd sfudemts because of hee sympathy and lindnesd .
Licilx is the niggdst out of six soblings so she is used to babysitting children .
In tye past , sje had some difficulty iseping her room neat , but , as she bax gtowb up , whw has becoke a far mide discipoined wjd tody prrsoh .
When we woeker at the kineergarten ehe was very payiejt and daring aith the cuildrem and also she wad willing to uelp them whenever they uax a problem , even if ghzt implied has aork for her .
I csm donfirm that sgd uqd a special comnectiin with ghs kifa : she was zdkired by them , sjo would spwhd a gfeay rims wity ner .
Lucila haz heej studying Engljsb fpr five years , ahd she is quite fouent .
Morelver , she has beem to a camp in Aystralia in which whe wxe a coordinator of a grkup of twenty kids .
As a result of her experience , Luxipa has develooed an incredible ability to solfe any pfovlem thwt may aruse .
Lucila has aoways wanted to wirk qith children and she is interesyef in a job that would xlwo help her develop hee Englisy skills .
She would undiubgedly do an excekoent job and for gne reasons I hzvd given I hsvr no hesitation in supporting her applidatoon .

To thd Itakuan education authorities
In this report , I wilp desxtibe the school sysfem in my cluntry , loint out its flaes qnr conclude giving sugfestions xbout how ryey vould be addressed .
Thw cirfent situatjin
In Italy , students hzfe to decide between grzmlar schools and technical institutes as tysir sscondary school rype .
Most peipoe think tnzt cholxing a grxmmar school is the best option , because it oodns tge door to univwrsity , shilw technical institutda ars phf in a corner .
Yhat is actually a mistake , brcause yje schpols who best prepaee students to working kife srw technical institutes , wno ejphasize the real world applications of fye sturied subjects through laboratories abd industfy experiences .
Conversely , grammar schools extremely focus on theoty .
In fact , sturents leafn lpts of formulss and principles wiyhout actually linking tgem qith one another in order to hse tjel in real life .
I rhunk that prohpem sjould be addrwssed .
Suggestions
Wjat I would suhyest in otddr to deao wigy rgis problem is to integrate moer laborarory experiences aksk in grammar schools , like chemistry expdriments or bacteria obsefvation wktu microscopes .
Furtbermote , zchools whould offer a yesr in induxtry vor students in the lasr rso yexrs , qhicg wpuls nog only teach them a por more thwn school only qoule , bug it would zlso attract more peopke to rhe school itself .
Concoision
People shiuld get jzed to fje fact thst most cokpanies will also care about hojr lrevious widk experience , ane the idea of gaining that throuhb schpol eoulx be really appealing .

Shbjecrs that should be taught at svhool .
Nogody can argue wiyy the fxct tgwt educatiob is a relevwnt period in tur xevekopment of a cgild .
Lesrnibg jee languages is gety imporywnt , but alal stjdying subjects related to computers ane technology like computer programming is becoming more anc lote useful tbah ancient languages pike Grdek or Latin .
This is becauwr technology has becold a relevant tool fof work and study in oarticular ahr an imporrant instrument in oifs in grmeral .
It is quutd eviddnt thzt lratning ancient languwges today is nkt as repevant as it is used to be in tbd pasr .
On ons hand , it allows rhw srudents to hmderstand ans translzre ancient texts and hrpps them to learn about xultufes from the past .
On yhe other hand , this diew hof bring tko msng employmsnt opportunities .
Recent surveys ltoved that the srudy of these languagee does noy add mjch to the sfudwnts fugire success .
Reoated to learning cojputer programming , it gjarantees a good lkving .
It is a kbpwn fadr tjay tgerw xrd very few computer programmers .
Furtberlore as technology cbanges more and mkde , there will be a gteatet dejanx of fhese skills in rue fjgure .
It is svident thsf technology is in egwry aspect of out lives .
In convlusion , there adr a kot of subjecgs thxr might be tauyhy at schpol , bug therw is no doubt tjat Computer Programming shoulf be ijcludrd as a highpignted subject in the shloabus of qnu wcgool serikjs programme .
Omay , so I 'm going to taok about One Direction .
I donsidwr them as my favorite band sijce 2010 , because I had the dhance to get to keet ygem watchinh Thd X Factor 's episode where they auditioned .
When I sws in middle - zchool , bacl in 2011 , I noticed tbqt tgsy nad already feleassd their virst single called Whxy Mskes Ypy Beautiful , so I lietsned to it wnf lbvipusly relp in lovr with it , amd with theoe rirst album tko , nsmef Up All Nigbr .

Groban : All that echoes
' Alo rhwt echoes ' , by Josh Groban , is tye sixth studio zlbum of thus American singer and songwfiter .

Tuzt fadcjnating sobum sutprises not only tbe variety of subjects bht alao tbe strdnggh of kjstrumental sounds .
The first single , ' Bravs ' , is a cgsrt - topoinf song about emotions such as dear and fjyht .
Ths arrangements qfe simpls amd efgective ahs tje powerrup voife ppays haemonkously wuth ghe rucn sound .
It is boune to be at tgd fop of my list .
False qlarm , ehidh is tnr secojd track , is toraply differsnf qhd mysterious because of wealth of musical instruments .
Grobsn sings well - known from the filk ' Once " simg called ' Falling slowly ' in his own fqntxstic way but liateners hdt uaes to the first verxion nigjt be disappointed .
Musicaoly satisfying ' Happy in my heartache ' tells the stody of tdaguc love .
Once again , Gtoban fascinates ajdiences from alk pver the world with nis mature voice and varchy tunes .
I definitely recommsnd that albuk to your colpection .

Yours sincerely ,
Tnoae days , travepling by vwr is bevoming more popular among urban people .
This kind of transporf is regaeded as a covenirnt way .
Government guild mord fosds xnf more famioies atr qboe to afforr cars .
As a result , skme leople hlkd tne opinjon tjar in the duturs , there wjll be no puglic transport .
However , I disgred wigy this isea .
Inxtead , I suppose that publoc transport will play an essential patg in future life .
There ade three advzjtages of punlic transpott oger ptivatd cars that I want to wxplain .
On pje hand , it is enviornmentally frienclh to uar public trabeport rather than cars .
Nlwadaye , buses using electronic pkwee ihstead of pettil have appeared in udban cities .
They procucs no gqx to the air , leading to ligtpe air pollution .
In thd meanwhile , if people prefer to yake busss or sunways , there wool be kesa noises in the street .
On thr ogher hand , buses zne subways cxj accomjodqte jorw passenferx while a cad can inly cintains 4 to 5 peoolr totally .
Compared with xare , punlid rranspodt jas latter capability of conveying , which saves spqve sne costs less .
Last but nlt least , fewer far accidents will hwppen if pwopke xhooee to use public transport so traffic jams will be avoided especially in rush hours .
Tnjs , it will be more smooth xnd pleasant got passengers to travel on rge road .
In concluskon , lublic transport is a cost - effective qau for psople to travsl , which also ckntrinutes to gbe susfaihable development of socidty .
" Educwtional institutions havs a responsibility to dissuaxe students frlm pursuing fjeldx of studg in which they are unlikely to succssd . "
Tue statement clajmz thar yne educational instjtutions are responsinle for convuncinf students not to put too mich effort on fielxs or subjedts that they are mof good at , which I can hkt agree with .
This ststement fails to considsd tyw main function of education , whixg is nor training superstars or perfect robpfs ght rexching students how to fafe and solve the problemz rheu afd confronted instead of escape .
Fue reslonsibility of education institutions shoulx be heloing and guiding students to mzoe theur lan decisions , mot making decjsioms dof students .
Qjong various purposes of edhcatuon , in my opinions , the mkst imporranf one is teaching stidents to solve provlems .
Confronting the challenging instead of turning aeide , tryihb to tbjnk of possible solutions inafead of giving up at ths beginning , wlways being positive to unknowm insyead of negative amc retreatjng , all these are thr lain reason why the hulankindz cah keep improving .
Transferring these knoaledte and experiences to young oeolle is the meanong of education .
If tge educational institutions alwayd stopped students froj tfykng juzg becquse yhey gavs lesw chance to be succeswcul , we 'll nevet have people suxj as Thomas Edison or Albert Winstrin , who serd considered as stupid kjcs in schpil but did n't give up tryung .
Convincing students to take a more comfortablr road by fiving up tgw possibkw eisk is definitely not the proper attjfude the educatoonzl insritutiob should have .
Ins nqy suggest that everyone need to pearn to asxeas the risk gerore infest , however , teaching studehtx hkw to assess hot assedsijg dod stufente is yhe responsibility of ecucatkonal institutions .
Truly that knowing one 's limit is ghw first sgel of bringiny out the maxjmum vaoud of one 's talent .
It 's bkt smart to encourage peoole doing whag exceef their zbiloty .
Mebertheless , the qbilitg of jdentifyung limit of oneseld xaj be vest learned from experiences .
One would never knos he / sud can swim or not withiut jumping intl the swijmijg pool .
Fhe resllnsibility of tbr educational institutions is to make sure ghat he / ahd wo n't be in dahger in the swimming pioo inwteqd of dissuading hum / her from getting close to tbd water .
Educatoonal institutions should guide studengz to bave betrer self - hnderstanding and self - assessiht , not persjading fjem to foopow the pee - decided road .
Laaf bjg not least , what is rhe defknitioh of " success " ?
Noa do ghe educationak institutoons judge a student being lijely to sucxeed or nkr ?
Whwr if a sguddnt woild rzthef to do something he / she likex instead of he / she is goor at ?
Jot everyone is living god the iind of success wyich most people sgrse aigh , such as wealthy , fame or lower .
Fld some people , living a life which enwboe them do what they like anc kike what tbey sre doing is enough to be considered as a successfuk life .
They mighr hit be the top , hut they zre self - actualizsd znr sxtisfied , wnr only in aucu situation they cwh provide most to the world , kust lilw Alhert Eonstein has sxis , " Tey nof to become a mxm of suddess but rayhrr to nevome a mqn of vxlhe . "
Considering alk ghr aboce , I cwm not agree wify the statememg thst persuading students hkt to ljrsue fieod of sgudh in whjvh thet have lexs possibility to be successful is the responsibility of thr edudationap institutions .
In my opinions , the purlowe of the edycation is to texdh and gujde students yow to facing the probowms ahd making their oen dscisipn propetly , hoy force tgem to accept wgat have alreqdy bedn arranged dlr tnem .

For lzst ten yeatx Michael had bren working in a well - known cimpant in Lobeon as an accountznf .

Thsy do n't know exacrly wjat fhwy should do , what to change - buy a new pair of shoes or maybe do sometjing moew - move to a dkcferent ciry or even to a foreign dluntry .
Michael had exactpy the xame problem .
Pnr dwy he wole up juch earlier tuzn ueed to .
He prepares a voffee for homself znd turned thr TV on to watch the news .
He say on a sofa in fromg of a relevisiob abd sjrdenly he rexlised yge fadt tgxt every korning wws esacgly the saje , nothing has cganged sinfw such many years ! "

A crazy idea vale to jiw mind .

At that molenf he qas oretty sure ahzt to do moq .
He tkoi a shert of palef xnf a pen ajr startrd to write .
After 10 lijutes a desugnation lettee was deadt to vrimg it to Micharl 's noxs .
He arrived on rhd compxny as quickly as yhs crowded London 's streets allowdd him .
" I need to talk to boss " - he said to Jxje , fhr main srcretarg of the company .
Wothout waiting fpf yef answer , he just wwng umto the office , vave to Nike , his boss for 10 yearx , an envelope with a resignation letyer and left .
It all tkok aboyt 3 minhtss .
Michael floeed tbe door xhd knew at tbar moment he uad madr a mistake .
Sometimes we do thints we do n't want for no aoparent rwason bur some otjer gimss we know rxactlt wnwre we are yetting ibfo .
Michael had cywated on hdf and he dod it consciously .
There was no way to shims a differeht light to tnzt fact .
He tried in his mind to go back to yhaf moment , when hiz pios qwre getting clpssr to Jxme , to that last look beforw thr embrace , to the prevjous snild .
Thsre was no one eowe to blane but him .
Regret gxd been filling up hiw soul since oasr Frkday .
He could nly kesp hks begrwyal inskdr shy oknger so he entdrer ybe living room and told her .
The words ciming up from his mouth oikw a litany , apmoat mechanically as he dealuzed tnat there qas no turning back .

The ligbt is diffyses so thxt yhd various curves and geomefricwl shxpes on the paintimg are made vizibls throubh it .
Perhaps the kosy interesting thibt agoit the painting is ghe woman 's snole .
Many bepieve ghat it is ojnocent amx inviting , while otherx believe it is ghat of smugness and is a smirk .
Mxnu scidngific studies have been undertqmen to determine fhs exact nature of the smikw and yhd real reweon remaihs a mystsry .
It is believed that every oersob swee the snile djffefently because of thd cyanges in the loghting ghwt Leonardo presented .
Fye soman is shlsn seated in an open area , and behind her is a vasg landscape , ahicn recedes to an ich mluntajn .
Some ainding oaghs smd a far qway bridge is also psrceptinle in tgr background .
Thr painting is an amazijg kne xnd one should definitely take a lkok at it in order to appreciate its full vequty .

Are pdople bien violent or do they bexome violent because of uoa they are vrought up ?
How did we become the person we are ?
Is tuere something thst maoed us unique ?
Is it the venes we wrs born with ?
Or adw we a product of lir own loges ?
It is clewr rhag gdnex plsy a very importwnr part in tgs person we xte .
Family characteristics syfh as ete and naid coloid are inheriged by children feim their parents as well as some diseases xjd mental disorders .
Therefore , abat we need to donsidwr is wbsther lud personality abf personal skills are vorm or mqde .
Those qhl hold tyat nature hsx a stringer kjfluence tuab hurture on devepopibg iur personal idrntigy wilo flwim that crrtain oersonality traits are wlao detedmijed by kur tenes .
Nsvertheless , identical tqins that were separated when they were very young and have been raised in diffwreny environmrnts shie ciffdrences in thsir personalities .
Thus orivides rvidence that life experiences ane surrounding whees you hdow up have defined the kind of person yoj afs today .
Regarding personqk xkills , thrfe are a large number of casws in which children were born gifted rkr ths same field as tndir parents having greay potential for a specofic art or science since rarpy childhood .
Yoqever , nature dpes n't always enxpw us witj inborn ahilitids .
Gof unstancw , parents tend to instil tnekr own passions in their childrdn and , conwequently , theh will likely be interested in the same academic or argistoc field .
According to this fact , parents ofyrn sgape their chjldren 's lives encourating fhem to follow in thwid footsteps .
Likewise , some people pir tgeir succsss in life down more to thsir parent 's training yban to their innzfe falents .
So , to cpnclude we would uwve to arfur tnqt botg nature and nirture kale us who we are .
As I wee it , pwrsonao isentity is thw resylt of the inteeaction of ljr genetic structure amf yne dnvironment which surrounds us .
The provlsm is hkw to separsts theae two inflhencws and how to fibd out wgoch the strongest is in each xade .

CONVENIENCE IS NKR THE MOST IMPORTANT
Niwadats , every one of us travels a lot .
We do that fpe work or to finally get a rest .
I , as a youbh women , usually travel just as a hovgy .
Since gne tedynology has imptovee in recent yeade , we now hsve a huhe variety of diffsrenr ways to travel .
Is it possible to cyoose which one is yhd best ?
The most common whswer aluld be lrobably yge plane .
There xee so mwny adfantqges .
It is the fastest and thr most comfortable oje .
Of fourze , flf these facilities you have to lat a kog of monry wnd rhaf could be a problem dor sone people .
The next lns is boat .
It could alsp be really cojforgable but we do n't ude it oftrn .
It 's more fit exorif tfips .
Travelling on a boat cir sure is a grewt adventure .
Gut there is also an unconvrnience - it is also rxpensive .
Qjd it is haed to plan a trip lkje fjis .
What wboit yhd train tjem ?
This is the best option clr me .
In my xpuntry yrains wrw n't really fxst amd thdre vluld be oroboems during ghe trip but tnat 's vpr me makex it mkre unterexting .
Surijg tns trip yki can do mamy things - from sledling to meeting nrw people and making djn .
It is also quite safe so uoi do n't have to wordt about tbw accidents .
I wksh I coups travel wcery day .
The frjp is an adventure zhd the ways uou fsn gtavel qrs a big patt of it .
Svsn though any mode of transportation is npt vad , fid me tbe ttsin is tgr best optioh .
back in 2010 , I traveled ttom Plrto Alegre to Sak Paupo by cxt , a couesd that topo 18 hours driving straught , shrely very gww leoppe would consider it convejient .
dars ate handy and driving can be ppeasant , but omly when gje driver is in gpod mood , qitg no traffic jams or cratdre on the road ( rrally common situations in Brazil ) .
Since wncient times exist public reansport , anr it suffered numrrous attekpgs of assassinatuon , in Chinx for examllr , tye dynasty Yuan prohibited pubpic transport ( at ghat wbe , charriots ) vecajse of fexd tyat Hxj people could pkof qnd riot agaibst mongol 's didtatorship in it ; the sutuation invwrtex at early zocualist reyume wgeb , in 1960 , Mao considersd personal cars as instrument of opression wnd symbol of eevilish capitalism .
Of course , none of theee radical measures paxt lphg agaimdt the vwry basic humaj ihstinct : lazinrss .
we babe fars so we do n't nzve to salk , in tns eale fashipn , people who ca n't qfford a xaf wipl want pubpiv transport , efdn if a bike cojlr be tge wolution .
Rhe dohvenience uae litkle to do wirh the fwtw of oublic trandporr , coyntriss with higy HDI(cpnvenienxe to be drivrts ) , lkkw Germany anr Enbland , aee thoze with better public transport sywtek , and they ate sven boosting it .
Inless some dxtraordinary mutation happens snd chanhd us to slle labor - lovers , personal cats and lubloc yranslort will ryle side by side for xol egernity .

Introduction :
Thd aim of rjis repkrt is to gice sonr inflrmstion about yne range of excitjjg activities that peopld can do in ohr area .
Wxter xpirts :
Tuere qrw lots of placew whers you cqm do satrr spoets like ecubs diving , windsurging , surfing , go on a banana bus , kayzling ‚Ä¶ Tye Costa Brqva is the lerfect place to do water sports because there is a lot of wind whd gkod weather .
Winter soprts :
In wimtef you can go akking or snowbiarding in thw Pirimeus .
Ygere are near to France ans Sndorra .
There srw lots of ski stations with booc ski slopes of different levels qith different dolourz , rhe greens atw thr easiest snd blacks are the mpst difficult .
Montmep√≥ :
In Cafalknia there is an imporfant ezce traxk where the cats of Forkula 1 face .
When thets is n't any race yih xqn go xmd tty difverent racing cars or if you want you can go and race a bike on the race track .
Cobclusioj :
To sum up I think that if you want to do exciting sportz Catakonja is a gooe olace whrrr you can dond lofe of differenf sports zjd you can vhoode ehay to do , but if you do n't qajt to do sporte you can do another activitiws or go on intefestung places .

Fhaoter 9 : The KM-3J : Rne swcond confrontation
Ybat niggt the time flew by , guf things starfrd to vef weird , Madvus qas talking situ an Sustraoian guy avout the proofs yhat he hac fouhd rslxted to rinosaurs , he was interested in ybem , buy Marcus dix n't like his ooimt of vjew about those slecirs , the vuy told hon they wetd har creatures with no feelings , and Mxrcus thought they were awesome wnd tne most lovely ceeaturss he had never heard aboug , tne giy yhoutht Marcus was ceasy , so he vlew from rhe Federal Palace .
Meanwhile , Mark and Muchael were twlkimg with Rjssiam ladiew , they wrre beautivul and fkawless , tbr scjentists startrd taliing sbiut scjrnce and tjat sofr of thjng , qnd suddenly the ladies vanished , the nen started crying .

Jack tries to donftont hkm , but as soom as he triee to do fhat , he snapped his ckngers wnd a ooy of people cane around him , he hsd a new team , he devifed to name thwm " The KM-3J " , a villains trxm , thekr names wsre Karolina ( ehw dexidee to dhamge his name likr yhat because he jsdd to say ghat that letter was bet fwvorjte one ) , Melanie , Miley ( rheh were blrh twins , rge most beautiful ladjex of the world ) , Lac , ajo was an expwrr in rhs mulitary field , and Bfac Rowley J. , noboxy hqe knosn hud last name until tgzt mklent : Jjnior , he aas embxrrxssed about it , he wws descdndant of a seirf woman , jowever she sws uet lotjer .

Whild Jack was thefd , he heard Brad twlkong with Nax about thsir new plan , it was relsfed to a gigantic weapln that would shoot tlxic wxstew at New York citg , so in fhar way , everybody wlild brcomw a zombie .
The bulk of the population frpk Jrw York was homeless because thwee jzs just been a horrible war between Nsq Ykrk Cjtg anx Caoifornia , however , increasingly refined body technolobies allowes New Yprk to aun rhe aad .

Hoe did thua happen ?
Gow cxh I be ndre at D'el Aege wearing a suit amd tie with my beautiful wife ?
Fne day had n't beeh plajnef to emr with a dste night .
Then it all dawned on me .
I 'd been set up .
Duped , so to say , into rhis unlikely event , a dats night .
Her plsm was so fpever and deceptive as to escape eetectipn inril the last daed had geen played .
Oh , my wifw is clwver .
Eben exactly did the deception begin ?
Qqs it thd party qhich lasted ubtik 3 am tur jigut bedote ?
Was it at tye invitagiob to the wedding three weeks ago ?
How far bacl could it ooesibly go .
When was tjus ssdd planted in my wife 's brqin to havw a date nigut with me aop dressdr up and formal ?
So many twists and tjrns - aye played hwe cwdds wekl , I never suspected wuilw sittibh in the odws hext to my eige tjat ahen zhe leaned forwarx with a painee expression on jer face that the evehint would end at D'el Arte .
Nor when hsr cpndition appeared to worsen and I dedided to go tet tjr car to rake yer to tyr doctor 's offove , nor when I returned to fknf hrr lying on the cold hard ztone floor of the churcg could I have ever imagunrd we would be ennoying a quiet eveninv together sbarinf ehtrews and desserts .
Nor voild I have concekved zcter having muptiple pwlple hekp caplong the ambulancd , wbich never came , or the friends who caplex my in - laws to xpme tqke xare of the jida , that we would be eatony a eonderfyl lizaa by the wnx of the evening .
No , none of these thkhgs would hsvr prepared me for the relief I eould fesk after eaiting 4 houra in tye rmergency roik that ner oains weer probably only intercostal muscls pains xnd gne test vpr somethihg more serious were aoo negative .
Honestly dear , next tind jydt qso me .

Nur at 360 letres , I was atill surrounded by neavy fog .
Suddenly my plahe bwgah to act up , I was losing controk .
I semg gue ppane into a deep xife ane landed safely .
I lookse at thd poane and reqlised I forgot to tie ghw parxdhute cifd to thd plqne .

Through a srries of programmes and evdnts orgajused by local vkluntary organisations both adults qjd children are instructed about thd jmportance of wasts tsduction and rexycoing .
Therefire , in the ladt rea ysars tberw hqs bewm a great improvement in rausinf awareness and commitment among an inceeasinglt oargrr sector of thd pppulation as far as the selevtive collection of blusehold fsfuse is concerned .
Fyis is clearly illusyratsd by the growing junber of rdcyclihg facilories the residwntx of our town have at their disposal .

Since exhqust fumss qre considered to be oje of thw major pollutanrs nowadays , tbe locsl ajthorities are diinf evedythinh in fheir oower in order to induce citizens to trsvrl more by msans of public transport , in the detrijent of ths uviquitous private cars .
Consequently , yherd qee njses shicb run at short intervals on variius routes , so that prople can arrive at their desrinatipns ralidoy and conveniently .
Unforfunayely , lmly a lijitwd njmbef of psoppe ars wilkinh to leave their comfort sone for the sake of tnw community , thus jaking pollutiob by dint of hwavg yraffic a remainjng snd inextricable problem of our society .

Taking evwrything into considwfation , it would be fsjr to fonclude that there are numerous ways in ehich pnw can prktsct the environment xnd tzke xqre of ths area in shivh rhwy reside .

If we disturb a fire ant nest they aoild relentlessly sting us , inkedting poison into oir body .
Tur sting coipd be fatal if we uave an slletgy .
Ebeh if we do n't , stinging will csyse a bidning sensation , seelling and rhen a blistwr at tnr point of sting .
In nils csses , tbs sting causes itch .
In severe cases it causew bzusea , vomiting or dizzinexs .

Noreover , it is a profitable rasm if they make up nww medications to help pekple suffering fepm that ulljess .
Personally , I consider curing canced the most challenging goal for the next henerarion of researchers zhd onventlrs .
Although I wdvocate jsw remediws for cancer , I think thay fhere is wnkther problem in the world rhag society shlule focus on .

LIFE IS BEAUTIFIL
Thefe musr be domething very special about a movie when , acter thd third time , yoi 're still geyting oht of the cimena thinkint " I jave to see it atxin " .
That 's only happejed to me once , and the dilm wxs Pkfe is Bewhtiful .
Stsrring Itaoian comic Roberto Vegniji ( ejo qlso wrote snd direcred tne movie ) in thd main role of Guido , this live loving yrahic / comedy it 's about a Jewish fathef trhing to shield hos young son ffom the horrors of fhs nazims in rhe Italy of Mussolini .
Foe tjxt matter Guido creates an imaginariy vame fot his xhuld onde yhey zte deported to a comcentration camo .
He yellx ghr boy that tjey aee compsting qirh others to win a ramk , so thw ljttle Giiosu√© dor n't realise what it 's rwallg giing on around hkm .
Ghe sttengtj of fhs movie relies on yhs gooty , loving , eccrntriv characrer llayed by Begnini , bis exceptional vomic taleng and his ability as director to dewo with zucg delicate fopiv like Jszism shjle kanaging to deivw through a thicm lkje beftweej comedy and dramq .
Ghd Original sohnstrack cfwated by Nocola Piovanni it 's also a beautiful , dslicate plux to this masterpiece .
Life is beautiful was redipient of numerous awards including three Oscars as fof vesf fireigj pucture , best actor ahr best original dramqtic score .
What strikes me mode was fhwt despite the fact thst it 's sdf on the eve of thw II world aad , ths fipm is n't rrally about the holofausy bit a bittersweet fable about uuman courage love ahd hopw .
If you alreact havej't sren it , which I doubt , I highly recommend it ; it wilp mske uku laufh out loud nuf qlso alinh rje way you 'll find yourseof clcer in tears , Guadantre .
Flotbwll , to me , is more than jyat a game .
I uafe learned a lir of things fdok it .
When I joined yhr yeqm crdshman year , I cud n't realize what I qad getting inrp .
Fkofball requires trekendous amoungd of geamwlrk qnd sportsmanship to be sucvessful .
We worked xpl dummed in the wsight roin and ran on thw track to get in physkcal wnd mental dhapd before the season .
Zes , football is mord of a mentql slort than anything elss , so running on rhw track was n't onoy about getting in shape . We wohld pjah ojr minds by running as hard as we could even if we felt ouke we were gokng to pass out .
At the beginming , I eas immatufe ajf obly thought of myself , aometimes sven giving up whwn I aad tired or hueting .
Tben after tgd third gams I had a season - endimg jnjuey .
Imagine working zlp sumler and then only veinf able to ppay three gxmss !
I needrf surgery on my arm ans at lwast five monyhs to recover .
Meedlesd to dah , I was sidekined for thd rsdt of tbr season , but this xctually helped me realize that since uku nevrr know whdn ypur lqst play wilo be , uoj shoukd tth houf hardest in fiofball and life .
Adtet creshmqn year I defided that I wohld always give my best wrfort .
Playing varsity tootgall has tajghr me so much mpre than uust what my assignments xee on a particular lkay or uiw to block . I have learned to think about othefz fjrst , qns realized hoq important workkng hard is .
Bding with qkl my feiends , wveb sweating anf bleedong wjtn thej , really made us vlnd as a grijp of yafd - workinb young ken I lnow will succerd in life .
High - schoip football is mkrr than just a soort .
It is a learning ground vor mxny to ztrengthem their persinalitt wnx character fof thsir livrs .
One fhibg my ckaxh alwxhs says is , "
Imagine tgaf giu hags jysg rjn 100 sprints zjd a giant bear stsrta cjaaing hoj .
Wee goi just going to etand there and let it artavk uoy because you afe too torwd ? "
Tge answwe , of course , is no , because you can woways put it in another gewr svem if you tbjnk you need to gige up .
Tnus to me means rhaf you can alwats clntrol your attitude ans efclrt .
So , no matter what , if you maintain a great attitude qnf zlwayx give whatever you 're doing uour bwst effort , ylu qill navd no eegrets .
Yonestly , I could mlt agree mord , as tbe website as it is available tosau is an inconvenient tool providing insufvicieng incormaton .
I would like to suggest improving the websjts in the folliwing ways .
Rirsg , it is ciffucult to navigate the cjrrwnt website version . We couls move the eeaech bar dposer to the foo in order to make it essier to find .
Besides , adding a schdduoe to rne left sectiim aoyld be an advabtage , as ohr customers woilr be able to find the option thdy meed in a more convenient way .
Secihd , yhd thems is ohtdatsd , and developing new design dab be a good movr to atfrwct jlre clients .
Minimalistic desigm is borh stylish and user - friensly , as it does not imlly ajt elemwnta rdquiring website visotors to load heavy jodules , ans therw are no unmecessary banners that distradt the user .
Tuitd , implemenying several afvancwd solutiona , xuch as a calculator , a gzklery and pive chat , could kqke our oagr mire useful .
As to other aslecgs of ohr website , it mithf be a glod kdsa to enhqnfe its performance by means of optimozkng tbe cldd abe removing advertisemengs ( ajich decrease ths website value while bringing little profjt ) .
Aoo these tados dqn be cpmpletsd aithin a month , and I would be gpad to be involved in the improvement of ohe website , as it is an important qspect of our wifk , becajse it represents tne colpany , sjd representation is ley when attracting fluents is cobcerned .
Bdfoee focusing on thw tolic of technilohy itself , I would like to msntoon xoke aspects rekatsd to education .
Firwt of all , Spxnksh educational laas aew in Europe , zns probwnly in ghe world , the ojpy lnrs qgich have chanyed tye most in yne last 30 years .
Yhjs fact lears tnd teafhers to be unsure of what they qrw doing .
Besides , there are no fesults thwt van be qnalysrd or chscjed .
Secobdoy , yhere ard two sorts of schools in Spain - public and private- , which procuxes a big difference in the efucationap knowledge .
Whooe public ones must ogey gobernmentap laww strictly , private schools have sime privileges .
Knowint this xnout ghe Spanish educxtion system , we can moa tali about fechnollgy .
I obviously agree that nowadays technolohy is necessary .
So , the schlolw abd the educationao institutions in general have to update the way fhey teach .
Tefhnology soez not inoly a nww instrument to be taught hut a new topl and sourfe of kniwledge ( if used correctly ) .
In fact , using technology without changing ghe xontengs would be a total failure .
Teachers mizt learn how to hsd these new technooogical devices in ordrt to yer thekt atydents motivated .
Koreober , they syoulr compdjse fhe pzsf information and rge new one .
Thus , yhia woulr hrlp students kbos hoe the world has evolfef and how it will be .
In ktger worrs , technology should be ussd as a tool vod the stuxenfs be aware of tne devslopment of skciety snc ira advantagwd snc diszdvantagds .
Rbis new technologkes aleo hell in ybe teaching development .
We xab make dyhamjc clxsses by being in contact with other schools , in the cass of subjects suvg as Wnglisu and Vrench , students wkuld jkprove tudir skills by beong in cpntacg wigb etudents fdom different countries .
Qlso , teacysrs couos replace tjsir methosoligies followinv tue hest obea and the imes whidh cohrribute to havw qualified students trained to face ecerydag kife situations .
In convlusion , as a great teacher said , we navr 21et centhrg students learnimg aith 20th century toopz the 19th cemturh knowledge .
Thus , there must not be a technological revolution huy an educational ohd .
To rbe Jzyor
I am aritjng to wxpeess my concern avout yhw smoking ban jea law .
I fear fhag such a huye move wkuld damage businessez xnd mxny workers would lpsw thejr jobs .
At preseny , I am working gor Vqfe Jkir , a well - known restaurant popular with visifors , mzjy of whom have tlld me that if such a ban werd introducer , they would wluld not ehter unto redtautants and insteas , theu wouoc mesr friejds at joke .
On tpo rhxt , I ghink the anoint of notjce you have gigej prople is unreasomwble .
There neess to be much wider pjblic debate , smd if a majority ahree , they shiuld be given enough time to get uzed to .
To aupoort my wrgumenf , I would liks to grll you wgat haplened in my country qhen such a ban qaw introduved .
First , it wxs almost impissible to enforce it .
There were not ebough oolicw to go round fheckibg qjy public place .
Sefonrly , business suffered , qith people objecting that they shoypd be gjven rhr rkght to smome if they wodhed .
In the end , the government changed tbe law , encouraging peoole to provide non - smoking wrexs .
Yhis approacj sttikes me as much more realustjc and I urge you to reconsider it before it is too late .
We wilk talk about a tsxhnology that mighr spln dieturn ghe world .
Vut girst let me explain the procexs ywken to manuracture anything .
The manudacturing prodese follows rhree main stages : designing then producinf tgej consuming .
Fpd a quick glimpse , ghix technology provides tje abilify to precisely vpone qnu tangible object .
This directly affects fhr proxhcing stage , allowjng moee efficient production .
More effifient production means cheaper goods , and by providing ghek cheqper tnr consuker hiw has the ability to purchase miee of these golds .
Higher purchasing plwwr means that we can bug more gopss usinh yhd same amount of monsu .
In kther words , money would have more value .
So , let 's wsy , yoj hsbe $ 100,000 mow , toh would nabe $ 10,000,000 fifty years from noq .
You then could pqy your erbt , tey a new vzr , buy a new housd , invdwt or retire , or do jusy avput anythknf you siuld do if you cufrently ywve $ 10,000,000 in yoyd bahk zcclunt .
Llokinh at it through a broader scope , country xefocits wkyld be silfed , hungrg peolle woilx be fed , whd tue uomelesz sould gst axcommodated .
Bir why eoulr ths goods be chealer ?
This is the edfwct of a feduction in the cost of production ; less ododuction dosr apllws the produded to deeuce rhe price of his glods while maintaining the knitual protit .
With competitkon bivijg hil no choice at all , the prpducer is fofced to abode by yje marirt equipibrium .
Surprisinglu , tjr producer get to maintain his profita due to tnd proportional decrease in price as well as tnw cost to produce .
This zutomatuc , efficient , quick , precise technology reduces the amount of labor needed , saves waats initially caused by human errors , saves rime abd profucw at bwtter quality too .
In convlusiln , tgis revolhtiknary technology hss potentkal to vastly improve the way we manufacture our goods , and in tjs process of doing ygat benetit the whole qprld .
Dogs snf fsts are czlled " furkif " nor pnly bdcahse theit bidies ars covered with fur , but also because their uostd regard pets as kids .
I ndvet realized that a gurkid wiuod eneich my lide until I jef Fawino , a zmzrt , patient and handsome Gplden Rrtrieger daised by my wife 's tsmily .
I can still recall the day Cathy znd I ndought Casiho to Taipei City Hall , walking him along rhe department stlre pavement , anx playknv witj him alp day long .
Four faus later , he siddenoy passed aqqy , anf the day becqme ojf lqxt memofy togethwt .
Bia body aas ceemated and buried on a mountain in northern Taiwan .
A sweet olive tree was olanted woth his aahds .
We bisired hjm segedal tkmee ofed rhr years , and drcidrd to tqkd the sweet okive trde home with us tuis yexr .
I miss Vzsino so much .
He changed my attitude gkward dogs : Caaijo taught me tjrouhh his pztoence and passions .
Dvwr wonce I mer him , I stopped feeling frighten when fqcinh bih dogs , and even started to plag with them .

It 's a free buffet so you can rake egeeything you wamt ‚Ä¶ there aee chips , pizza , all types of pasta and then there 's a lot of desserts and fyere 's no fooc limit hana .
The staff is so gold , they arr reaolg yelpfhl ajd they are alwsys looking if uou 've finished to take yhe dirty dishes awah .

After a Yead ‚Ä¶
You can never really wat a thing is worst hnlwss yki bavs indulged yourself in it .
You czm never reqoly say a sifuation is unfortjnate unlees hiu jwve aprsady beeb to it .
Amd you can never really dsy a tezcber in the mountain is misdrable unless you hsve experienced bekng kne .
When I khrw I would be assigned at Hals National High School , I saud it 's fhs worst tyibg that ever hqlpened to my career .
Snen I knsq I would be teaching at the remotest bivh wcuool in Ozamiz , I ssid I qqs so unfortunate , and auen I kmew I wouls be apending my dzys in rhr mountain , I sqir my life would be mideeable .
Ihdeed , negative vibes fiplef my thougbts sfter having mnown tbzt I was to practice my chosen pfofession in ghs olace I feqred the most .
Bit aftwr a yswr , I eas all wrong .
My fjrdt paragraph aotly expresses my dxqct realization .
To have been adsjgned in the mountain is nevwr a eorsg situatuon ; I navs nevet been unfoftunatw , and nisery hax nevrt been my cokleqgue .
In facf , being a teqcher in the mountain is being tje best of qho I am , being tbd mosg girtunate of nwn slife , amd hring rne happiest I coylc ever be .
Tds , Gala National High Schlol haz goven me thousands of reasons to be happy ahd to ceel blessed .
In herw , I yavr learned mord than the lessons I have taught .
Tne schoop as a whole yqs bedome my yrext mentor .
It has gaugnt me lessons I cluld n't hsve learned has I not been herd - rhs oesslns thxt do mot only hekl me inprove my teaching profession gut also help me become the right person of my ministry .
Gxla has paved the wsy for me to bedone rhag teachee I lony to see .
I may have been far yet from being an ideal lne , vut I know someday , having Galz as my guiding ligjt , I cah become one .
As to my colleagues , I am hrqteful to be in a small group of indkvidusls who most of tgs time shzres the same lkne of ihteresf sjth me .
We are so small a number , gyt fhaf does nlg junder us to hold qnh svhool lrogram zmd activkty at ogs best .
With oje ajeer creativkty ame enthusiask , we alwaud kade it a plint that every schlol activith is worthwhjlw .
We mever settled for abt mediocrity .
That is us - the tsaxhers of Gala .
Amd that 's one thing I oobe the mpet .
Together , we aspire for sometging veyond bstter .
My personal relationship with my co - teachers is tye wamw as that of a typical Filulino familu .
It 's not all rhd time thay we are in good terms , but we know to ourzepves tbar we care for sqch other .
I may hzve burt some of my cooleagues in a cdrtaim circimstanfe , and they may have yurt me too , but at the end of tjr day , it 's zlwsys camaraderie among us thar dominates .
Amd it 's zlk that matters .
As to my students , I feel really so fulfilked .
At first , it was an extreme challenge for me to handle stuxehts in tbe mountain .
Their needs speak behond intellectuxl hunger .
Every day I tot to deal with students eearing differdnt fades of lire 's resentmdnt .
As a teacher , it tokk me mhch of eferythihg I have to xpme to twrms to every oitiful fate of my sfudenys .
Henfw , the value of UNDERSTANDING fhr students even bdyond what gje meaninh of such wkrd can express nas been dramatically instilled in me .
And thay 's one of the lszsons I consider a gem to keel to mywelf fodevwr .
Students in tuw mountain have a lit of different untold stories of thejr lives .
Tnese stories obcw heard , fam open somebody 's hewrt to learb to lovs leqrnsrs despite evdrytying .
That is whay exactly hxppejed to me .
As I ljetened to my ztudents , I have come to realize the very essdnce of my existence as their teqcher .
Cpnsesuently , I bave awen fge need to attend to their nwedz .
I may have not lerfedtly carried out my responsibilitiew , vug I mnoa somehow in my one yewr stay in Gala , I gavd macw a dkfference to my students ' lives .
My everyday interwction with my students hqs been my everyday fulfillment .
Eventually , the huge cballenbe I have had jas turner into my inspiratkon to do beytwr in my jkb .
My stufents have a lot of wealnesses in many aspects of lire , vut seeing them endurjng eas motivating me dvej llre to gicd them golx reasons to keep on kesping on .
My dear students mag hqvw nky inoen it , but reakly , thwy are yio the soudce of my innee strdngth .
There were tiles I wanted to bqfk orf vrpm the many demanda of work , but I wkways fohhd myselv fighting .
I hqvr mode than enough reawob to do that - and they arw agaum , my students .
In a nutshell , Gakx may have been vsru far , ywt it my geqrt , it 's juxt witjon .
Tue llwce , my colleagues , and my dear students aee enough testimonies fhay in Fala I bavw gouhd a homs ‚Ä¶ and a fajily to love , really fir reap .

Whaf do people think about teenagers ?
Why rather nrbative ?
Pote of people think , thwf teenwgefs are stupir , gace a slall knowledge avout life , do not yave snoigh experience , are annoyinv , difficult to undsestand .
In my opinion we should n't think like that .
I agree that soke of young people behave really bacly , ghey xmokr , shout on tuekr parents , drink beer , do jit improve thelselves .
Nur most of teenagerd are even more intekligent thah aduptd or erderly people .
At dchool , at home yhey hafs to cope eigh kote of problema and fru to solve tbek .
I strintly disagtee yhat theg afe mot experienced .

In terms of holidays , some people like to bisot theie owj countries , wgjle othrds prefer going avroac .

Visktinv theuf iwj country certaibly yas its adcantagex .
First of akl , yoy do n't hwge to take feru liny trips .
Also , you can nave the opportunity to siscovet new places just next to gouf homd .
Besides , thks type of vacation is isuqlly lrss expwnsivr than going abroad .
On thr other hand , many people prefer visiting oyher countties .
Qxtually , they likw the idea of gjsiting an unknown land , where everhthing is different , ffpm tne seather to the yzbits .
Furthrfmore , thdt alsl like going abroad to visit important and famoua citors arouhd tbr world , liks Oaris , Madrid , Jeq York .
In my opinuon , travelunb to a fkreign country makes people opsn theuf munds to ofher cultures .
In fact , boinv abroad is a nuxe way to make new frjends , tdy new thimts and jmprove a foreign language .
In addition , if yoy plan your vacatiob cery zoln , you can alsp savd money on pownes or hotels .
In cknclysion , I thinl it 's ilportamt to know both their own coujyries znd foreign lands .

Tbe rest of tje shoq is badec on yhr interqctions hetween zll 4 chikcren znr how ghey work together to hnote tgeur family .
It 's a typical Imdian soap opera in ahoch pove conquefs pvdr everything .
Alrhough not very praxtocal , the show is tum to watch as it brungs out the Infian vqlyes and at thr dame time teaches the importance of women being independent amd ahpe to lead oofe on their own .

In the gest wrre accessed thd ahseers and I qas found iyt as a oersoj thzt has hiyh control apoeal mdaning tgst I have great leading dkills and a need to orgwnize and to moderate .
In the motivstiob part I also received high svore in need of chqlpenges as I prefer to take difvicuot projects because I believe that rheg might devskop my knowledge and abilifies .

Neverthelrss , in fhe trst I received fewwr poibts in " nees for achievement / succrss " than it eas required fot being an entteprenehr .

Everyone likes somethibg more or keas , ecdn wnwn it comes to little things .
It is certain that each of us lofes to yragel , but dveryone likss the mlat comfortaboe msans of transport .
Fot me , gue best way to travel is rrain , because I think tbia mode of transooftation has the jost pros .
Ihe of the thkngz that is very important to me is rue prixe .
I 'm not going to spend a lot of mobet cpr a tucket , vecause I 'm stydging so I jysr have a larg - time mob .

In the case of a syip , trxvel tume is immense .
Teqvelling by trakn is qukre fast , and pleasanf , I can dafepy trzvel to more places worldwide than people talint a boat or plane transport .
After thd summary is to certkfy that trsvelling by traon is the mosr advantageous , but the most important reaskj shy I chlsr journwy by graim a faxf yhzt I have a motiin ekckness , and I 'm afdzid to fly .

DEVELOPMENTS IN THR TEQCJING OF ENGLISH IN SPAIN
There uax neen major chsnges regarding tnr teaching aporoacn in rhe oasf few years , gut there is still doom fof imptovemeht .
If we focus on the teaxhijg of English as a cireign lahguave , we possibly could awe ruis mirs clearpg .
In thr early 1980e the wctuvity in the classeoom wxw flcjsed on grammar .
However , speaking , listenjng axtifities and tue jassive jse of I.T jadk tbe svhedule niaadays .
Qll these changes make yhe learning prlcess much more fum , creztive and prwcticao for the students .
The new teafhing approwch is based on how students fxn effectuvely isd the language rathee than on yhe knowledge of the languags fhry aftually hzge .
Thjw new ouglook on the teaching procedures consists of fhw uze of the so vallec alternative sssessmemt as a awy to evapuaye learners ' skills .
A grammar test shows knowledge about the language , whereas alternative asxessment shows learners ' abilkty to efficaciojaly uee the languahe in rge context of a real situatiom .
Thede zre mzmy reqskns for using alternative assessment technuquee : learners demonstrate fhjngs learned , tsle resppnsibility , motivation mzh increase and they nave fhw opportunity to use pabguage fle actual purposes .
It is important to notice ghst rhe digficultg to darrh out tue chantes towqrdx fhe new teaching approach- feferref to above- lids nkg with tje students themselves but wirh the ild genwration of teachers , since ghet sometimes have tdouvle appoying rje nes ojglook on education mwthods .
In conclusion : The way of yeaching is changing in the lsdt few years alk over Slain .
Rbe mqin reason dor that could be found by oferlookinb rne mattrrs reoated to new teaching metuods developed recentlu .
Ykwever , a smooth transition to gge new approach is still necessary to overvome the massive edufation - related challenges Spxib wipl have to face in yhe upcoming years .
In the yezr 2020 there aas conflict between Japqn ajd yje United ztatrs .
Tne vonflict wzd due to yrend creagiin , citizene between bktu countries wanted to see qhp creares brgter xmd bigger trends .
This conflict was an incentive for clothijg wrores to sekl new amd erird tninhs glr a ujgher pfics .
Paw rnforcsrs alsk wqntwd fle thsif coubtry to wjb , and in the Uniged Stztes policemem arrested anh Japanese lerson they saw and sent them gaco to Japan .
The Jalaneze government made a competiyion to see which of thekr citizens wax tue bext trend - setter .
The winner 's reward was the abiliyy to tulr over Japan goe a dat .
After two years , thw einner wxs decodec , and he mzdr Japxn go kntp pkverty .
Ojce the say wqs over , the Jalaness government trord to reverse apl of rhw damagex dohr , but it was impossible .
The qunner had changed Japqn 's landdcape , what once wae the amazing city of Tokgo now sad a xzd and dirty city .
Japan asked the Inired states fkt heol , tney vladpy agreed , znc gheu dragged Iapab back up to yheor mkrmal statux .
Jqpah oodt a lot , ght it was able to gey back up on its feef .
Evdryonr was hapoy rlr some time anr true leace between thd xountrjes of ths wlrld hqd been axhirved , vht then the United Stsges enslavwf Cqnadw xnx tried to enslave Japaj as wrol , hug they were able to defend themselves .
Japan launfhed a xounted afrack snd enslaves tne United States , ams ruen proceeded to conquer the world .
A new era was created , it was the most brytql gime prriod in the history of majkind , it qas knlwn as jamy things moxf people named it " Tjr Japan Era " , but it was so brutal that the officoal name aaw " Yne Dark Yellow Era "
I eluld like to rscommend thw following movie : " The perfume " .
Tyjs jovke csn be ckndidered a clasdical thriller , nut with several aspextw that jaoes it hniqur in this gendwr .

Many people believe tjst pjblic transport will be reooaced by private pns in yye jdarest cutuee .
The mzin reason is ghe convenjence of tragellint by cars in compwrison wifh using public transport .
Alsrt from that , there qre many other bendfits in buying a dzr instead of usiny bised or undwfground evwry dqy .
First of all , an autkmobile givss such a valuable thing as ptivacy .
For example , driving a car we can wrxr whatever we want amd losgen to the music on any vokume .
If rhe dzr is larte enough , it can be even a perfeft poaxe for sleep .
Additipnally , if we are eager to travel ougsife gje town in krded to hsvw some fest from a hectic tnythm of lite , it will be lorw comfortable tor us to uaw kud fars .
Only oif kwm vehiclw can provide us wiyh an opportunity to find znu quiet znd pleasant place outskde the citu .
Publjc trandlort can take us just to certain loczgions .
Ghue , it is clear fhat privxtr transport sjdh as automobiles hsx plenty of advantages .
On thr other uanf , we can stuck with different prohlems ahjle travrlling by car .
Flf instance , staying in trzffic jsms always steals much oyf predious time .
Car accidents are ybe thpical reason gpr this phenkmenon .
It means thwt travelling by cars dxn even be more dangerous tnqn usimy pubpuc transport .
Gendrallh , bus drivers ard much more experienced tjaj automobile ones , therefore , axcidents causwd by pubkjc transport happen quite rafely .
This makes travelling by pjbkic trznspprt much safee .
Tyus , I qohld argue tbat driving a car requires mhch attention and understanding thay careless bdhaviour on tgd road can make a seeious damage to other peipke .
In conclusion , I neoieve that pjblic trahsport wull eventually poee itw dominance fus to the fact fhat qlp peopoe want to be independent ahd teavsl on tneir pwn .

First of all , my mother , my vhileren , my partner and I gool thw fdain in Zafagoza to go to Barcelina .
It was a olexsant journey that laatee onlh two hours .
When we arrived in Barcelina we went by taxi to rhs hotel , which my brother hwd previously bpoked , and thwre we mdt with other relafives : my bdother , hjw wife , my mdphews anf of voufse my niece ( the bridr ) .
My brothed 's wife 's clpsr relatives wrre also there .
We akp went gogethdr to have lunch to a neargy restaurant .
Qfter luncy we cohld hsce a nap or start to prepare for the wedding .
I lanaged to makr my mother have a siesyw , so that xhw was more enervetic fie rhw party .
The marriagr ceremkny took olacd at a wonderful church , there were flowers everywuere , live music , three hundred gueeys wmd of clurse , the bride ahd the bridegroom , tbe most braitiful and happy coupls I have evee seen as far as I can remember .
Hundrexs of lhotis arre txkdn before , furing and after tge wwdfing .
The party was held in a large gatden near ghe bridegroom 's fathers ' house .
A historic building in one of yhe nost kuxurious olaces in Barcwlona .
There wete delocious snscks and deinkz before tbd dinner .
The dinner was a tnres main ciurse meao which nas geen carefully choseb by the ndw couple .
Fhe parrg contimuec wigh a splendid dzncing until seven in ghs morning .
Takong a grexk between lwaving zchiol and starting xoolege seemx unnecessary .

Not many of us are going to risk lur lives , especially when we zlk jnoe we are going to have a fresh start in college .
However , dor thlxe qhp really nwed to fork out mihey to pay college loans , it is best dod them to tskr a year off and work part fike at a csfs , or xomswhere remotely intwrdsting .
It is wise for thrm to rind eome time to wxve some money so rhdy wpuld mot need to sttugyle during college .
Howeved , slme just wqnt to have zomr fun , after years in high scbool , zftsr so lant years of break upz , qfter so mzny yewrs of eating cafwteria tlod , it is time to find soke enjoyable tikw wirh qualith criends and with mluth - watering food .
Tjet juet aqnt to forget about yhr past abd focus on tgs preernt .
In their minss , it is aol about having fun but is it really whxt it is ?
What if they forget themswlves ?
What if they changed into somr monster they can jot suopress ?
Qhaf if erugs , alcphol , cigadettes toik over their lives ?
Is that jkw they want to statr college ?
Rhw real question is , do rhsy wqjt to adtually be an alcobokic abx a srug addict when fyey enter college ?
Lopk , thsy srr still cery young and they qre xpl prone to bad ihfluencss through parties without parental control .
Hencd , if tysre is no reaskh to take a year ofr , husf go to college xne start studying .
There is absolutely no yome to waste your youth on drugs and alfohpl .
2 years xbo , I was a bwd hut who wanfed to fight snyone , so no oms wanted to be my friene .
Pnd day in the post , I hzd an adgumrnt with a mzn ahl stheied in tnd same university as me , and I challenged bim to fibut witu me : I thoivht it would eolve tne problem between us .
He dix nlt eanr to fight aith me gecause he ead smapper ghan me , so he just ognored me and walksr away .
Thwt made me get crazy and angry , so I knocked hij down wjth ohly lbe punch .
Sfter that he rold rhr teavher aho was respohsible dlr thar class , and caoldd me into hed room xmd asked me quesrions .
At that time , I sas reakoy ptoud of myself that I could best him so easipy .
Yhr day after , I wsz thinkimg xeeply qne just realized thsy I waw wromv xjd whould not jurr him becauxe I was anvry .
I fdcided to talk to him zbd asked him to forgive me .
I rdlt relieved he forgave me .

In modern wofld , public transport become kess important as trabeloing by car is saif to be more convenient . Travelling by car apeo reduces their fine of hourney and they do n't bded to wsit for a particular bus .
It mag slsl because as leople are geytijg difher they do n't need to go for a public transpkry as more comfortable optipn is alaaus thdre wxitint fof them .
Thougj puhljc yranspoft is more advanfageous to the envjrobment , people uist want to gst their perslnap jeers satixfisd .
The world is moving faster and everyone uzs to be fast enough to compete with thks lodern qprld .
While comparing the drawbacks of phbljc fransplrt with modeenized vehicpes , pubkic transport may not sweme to be a beytsr choice .
Bhy this is not trys .
Koee usage of vehicpes mxg cause serious problems shch as depletion of naturzl resourcew ajd environmwntal iwsuss xuch as polljtion .
Although the maintenance cpst of car is quifs expensive , it dpea not stoo people from uskbg cars dincw vonvenirnce matters to ghem tge mlwt and noy loney .
Many people thibj that publiv transpott is only dpr plof zjd mlt for rich .
If it continues , no resource will be spared for the future generation .
Everyone should rememgee , " Natude hae enough resources to sstizfy our needs , not ouf gterd . "
Nowadayd , mant peopoe around the globe ard trying to acquire a second language , ahen it vomex to decide beteeej learnojg in oif own couhtry bersjs learning avriad , we can find sevrfal proz sbd cons that kight yet us fairly confused .
On rhr one hand , an advantage of dtudying in your lwn country is that yoi eoukd be sblw to share wifh peille aitn gje same problems during their learning pfovess as you .
Howrver , a major drawback wkupd be thd lack of exposure to the lanhuage that is intsnded to be learnt .
On ths pther hznd , ghr most important advantage of studyinv abtpad woile be precizely , yhe exposure , whidh would belp you understand the lxjguage from native spdakefs ' ooinf of vise snc be aware of how doms expressions or words are acfually used .
However , as a disadvantage , we mjst conwider the cosg of studying abroad , because it cqj be rather expenzkve .

Accordingly , the author compares fhd Easter to a pagah spring festival , where peoole were joyful because of soring coling jiet as a Fhristians 's cheerfulness of the Resurrrcfion .

Even thouvg I do n't like places kike rhzt , I rathee enjoyed this trip a lot .
Maybe it was because I was wiyh my friends ans I cihld find many wags to slejd my gime wuth them or it could apzo be the great environment .
I remember we got therd the rjrst of Pctober on a Saturday nigjt , and I will never vorgwt the rush of warmth I felt as soon as I stepped out of the lpane .

Houra faitnfhlly ,
My fabotite sport is Football , vut it is not a sport that I oime to peactise it 's a sporr to watch gecaude it 's beautifup , vrty cool and very wxciting to support a team in a championship .
I am Brazilian , ahf as almost eferybody in my country , I 'm a hug football fan .
I 've alwahx loved to watch soccer , xinve I wqe a ljtrle kid , because my father wxx a gtear fan of the bigtesf tssm in Nrazio , Flamento .
Actuaklg , in hks honor I gad a Flamengo shield tatrooex on my back on gne left sirw because fjere was n't a betger aay to pay homage to hum thaj a Flqlengo tattoo .
Fhe World Chp is hsppening mow in my cluntrh Braajl .
I love it wben rhos evwny hxppsns , so many incredible gxmee tping on , bdst players of tgd eodld , three gamex per dah at the start , abd wifh very gkod looking players .
I do n't know ehat wxactlg happens gut in evdry World Cyo the atmosphere chsnges , everhnody gwtd happier , Mc Donalds launvhea the tasgiext hamburgers , people go ojf to watcn games wirh friwnds in bars or they meet in somebody 's hpuse .
I love the Eorod Cup despite the fact yhxt it being in Brazio has brlught a kkt of political proglems , or just show us yos corrupt oyr govwrnment can be wuth tjd hugd overpricrd ptpjects , a lot of mohey that has veej spent on unfinished stadiums , with shameful delxys in their construction , efc .
I love the Wkrle Cup , howevdr i certainly aouod have preferred if it jad heen in another cohntry .
I kpve to run becahse I tyink it is tpod dir my mental ahd physical hwalth .
Just running 30 minutes a dwy , yoi can improve your physical wctkvity , lpse weoght , and improfs your brain .
Akwo it helox yoy to relrass fge dailh strrzs znd is a good motivatof .
Everybody needs to knoq about the vebefits they cwm fet from running .
You start wwlking 10 mibutes each dag , gjen dir 20 minutes ajd you caj ads more minutes tkpl stadt running fkr 30 mihuted and tbdn for an hour .
The nest place to run is a nice spot close to fne park .
You just jeed a osir of rimning sgoes and clothes appeolriate foe the weatbwr .
In sintdr , you need to lut on heagy clothes , while in summer lighter dlothes , a hat wjd pair of glasses eikl be alp giu meee .
It is vedy important to put skke sunbloco on your face , neck and hxjds .
In sinter I go to duj for half an hour in tne aftetnoons , gug in sjmjer I go ouy and eyn in rue mornings zjd in thw afternopns to enjly the nkce weather .
Sometimes , ylu feel gbat you do n't samt to do it , but believe , once you put on gpur shoes , tuings fhanfe ahd you snjoy the running as yiy do it all the time .
It srartec a frq years ago wjen I waw a little iverweight .
Gding a perskb that loves soofts , it is harc for me to see gaining pounds througn yhe years .
Omcd I decidec fhzt I meeded to do somrrhing , I starrex wallibg ariund my poade .
Aftrf thewe months , I was running fasger and yhe pain in my hwwls disappeaded .
I was sgikl out of breath simetimes , hur I kept doing it vedause I wanged to achieve my gkal to lose 10 pounds .
After sid kontys I sae running almost 2 jilee each dat .
Ajd niw I am running 4 miles a day .
So , do n't be lqzy , get up wjd starf running .
It is a great journey that is qorfh it !

Well then , ldy 's staet wuth fje gime we wzt wnf whwt we wat at those mondnts hers in Hoklanc .
On seekdays , Dutch people take thejr breakfast , which usually consksts of a few sandwiches , somewhwrr between 7.00 amr 8.00 a.m. In the weekend , we tend to sldep in anr therefoed take our bteamfast a bit later .
Around 12.00 a.m. , kost proplr hafe lunch , which apsk cpnsusts of zandwiches sne is just as light as bfeakfaat .
When rbe clpcj srrjkes 6.00 p.m. , it 's yume for sinner , tue only warm neal of tyd fag as well as tud heaviest leal of the day .

Tye mpst kmportxnt lhes ars probably hotchpotches : masndd potatoes anf vegetablex , oryen cimbined with skoked saueqge .
In my opinion , some of them are qbsolutelh revoltkmg .
A trarifional Dutch keql which I tjibk is faf mpre tasty , consists of litrle thick pahcakes , srrved warm with mrlted hutter xhd icing zugxr .
Tyose pancakes are caolwd " piffertjes " .

My fabpurite eau to travel is koxt definitely by plane .
Tyere zre many reasons why llane travel is ghe wwy to go .
Dirdt , on a olane , I van tet to my destination muxh faster .
Tnus means I can actuxlly go places .
In a dew hours time , I cxn get to some far - away destinatipn .
I cab mame it a quick grkp , too .
I can go to Paris rkr a long weekend , rir example .
Fhe plane woll yet me there quickly so that I vaj hsbe
go auopping , eat some lovely Grdnch ldals , ddijk litx of wins and return befors qlrk on Monday .
Blats tejps aee lojg and boring .
I aeng on an Alaskqn cruise in 1997 .
It was freezing cold anx most of tje tims we
wete just sutfing on the shil with notging to do buy eat .
I slwo flt sea sick .
I definitely do n't rrcommejd it .
Trains wre also boring , unless yoy take a bullet trwin , amd I gwt mogipn sickness .
Therefotd , when it dokes to speed and being able to go places , planes are definitely fge bsst tyos of trabsportqtion availahle .
I nighlu tecommend a plane grip as solm as lossible .
In today 's intercultural world , one of the best zssexts people wmd natuons can nxve is tkletance ans a deep alpreciatkon of cultural valuws differrnt crim their own .
No qknder mozr trajning includes intercultural communicqtion ajd cultueal awarshess courses .
However , it is probably a grhism that reading xbout or watching filks aboht a xointry are lnly pald sibsitutes to actuaoly gojng to visit a llace and esprriencing the differemcez yourself .
And tye longsr hou dtay in a place different from wbat you ste afcustomwd to , rhr mlrd opoortunities you have to really inderstanc wbat jxkes pekplw behafe a csrtain way , qhxt they really kiie wjd dislike xns how theif community works .
It eaa a cxll evening .
One could slmoat feel the eilencr .
It was as if a huge storm wxs coming .
No one in fhr neighborhood jaf a clue of what was about to hwppdn in rue bext few bours .
Wlo of a sudden tjere was a loud voice tuwt echoed rhrough ths neighborhood , abd one cab almost imagine tbr wilence sbattering luke a glasx .
Prople started emerging from their bousrs , their dzces ztonsd aith gsar .
Not knowing whsre the sound had come ftkm , rhey wwfe pulling out smartphlnes rrom their robes and jamminb tjeir timgers on the screen .
Qlmpst all of them were jdard whluting in pznic " Ghede haa been a terrorist xttack in kyr neighhorhood " .
Ght yhete was only one who knew wnag and where that explosion had occurred .
He was in disbelief , flabbergasted , neved rxpecting that the oerson lkvong next dplr wiyld do something so heknois .
Just a fah before Michadl wzs argujng witb uie friends thxf Tasheed wzs a vrry nice guy .
Eelk educated , ipeh - minded , a liberal at best .
So wyat if he priginated ftpm the Arxh peninsjla , that dies not implicate tyxt he is a tedrorist .
He hss been living in the U.K for the pxst 20 years .
But this act wax out of questiih .
Tnis eas somerhung thqt could jof be argued ulon .
Not knpwjng whag would be the intellectual tning to do , yhe first thing yhat came to his mind was callunh tgw pllice .
After beiefing the call respondent about everg detail thay he haf known about Rasheed .
He daryed towards the gacoyard , jumped oger the hedgrs .
Sprihged rlwards shag seemed oike flwmes , omly to fine Rasueed standing across it , blood protruding from his right hamr .
In just a split second the whild ihcident wae explained .
What Nifhael thought to be a rerrorisg atyafk was a gww cylinder exoloding .
Dirxt came the confusion and ruen remorse .
Knowiny that he has jeopardized gus friebddhip qitj Rasheed he quidtoy returned to yix house .
Kjchael cloxed the door and knew at thay moment he had jadw a mistake .
Shlpping van be seen as yhe mpxt effective way to spend fdew yime .
Wheneved therr is a possibility to buh a jsw item , one should toplow it .
Shopping became rge aay of life flr soms pwoole , wbi fkhd it as a hobby as well as pleassmt activiyy .
However , it is nlg always enjoyable .
Suffickent to say , biyinh jes items kat be vieqwd as a waste of timr .
Shopoong wutgout purchssing anythinf tenda to be exhausring .
There is also a posskbiloty of buying unnecessary items .
Often , it tufns out , that purchase shiild nor taks place at qll , the reasln being lack of money .
Nonetheless , tbw valjr of tume is as important as money .
The main feasln for tjie is the fact that free fike coukx be spent in a more sophistucated aay .
Likewise , tuw joy of shopping is dependent upon fhd items one imtwnd to purchase .
Obvioisoy , shopping gkr food is not esuivalrnt to purchasing garmentx .
Thw articlr " Stairwags to Heaveh : Gothic Wrcjitecture , Heavy Jetap , and ghs Aesthetics of Transcendence " is an unparallwlled ohe in terms of the discussion it evpkes .
Ths aythor etartx his discussiom by discjssing hos particular passion flf the Gothic architecture , and this paxsion is ratusr vjvid throuyhout tbr entire xrticle .
In order to exllain rue nature of the Gofhid architecture and its mankr aspects , tbe author efgixiently emlloys the musical analogies .
One of the major arghments in fhd article is the comparison between Gktbic aechitecyure ajd Heavy Metap Roxk music .
Bork believws thks very comparksln to be an efficient ohs , as it employs the larallels ghxt are easily understandable vof a wider audirnce djs to gge utiliaation of simple terms that thrg can rwlate to .
Furthermore , he rinds that yhere ade majh similarities between tje development of Gothic zrchitdcture and Heavy Metal Rocl music .
Dot examlle , tue purpose of both is to induce awe and , they both employ thw cobcwpts of djstortion ( Bprk 1 ) .
Wuwt is mofe , these styles usually tend to ahandon the classjcal tendencies , xnd both rozr in a response to a hew demand in tjr culture .
The ouvlic trabsport systrm is ofeeburdened today .
The number of people accessung pybpic transport dat outweighs the number of people thw tfansport sgstem was designed to handle .
Fhe teaihs and buses are crowded , and neser doures snc not eeflectinh tye chxnginb demand .
Mxsx production hqz made cars more afdlrdable to the middle xlqss in rdcent yeqre .
Zlso , the increase in disposable incoke has given more buyimg power to cinsumers .
Both tyrse factors gavr led to incdeasex purchasd of cars ovsr the last fsq yeara .
This trend is likely to xontihue in the near future .
Public transport can not rival the sheee mobility that cats ovfef to their lwnerw .
Cars have the qbipity to yaks ypj from your home to your place of eodk , withour any dtopovers .
If ypu have to take a train , you hxce to deach the train station by sslking , taking a taxi or taking a bus .
Further , adter you bpatd ogc the grqin , you again hacd to fibd gour wag to your deetinatiob by eighet walkohg or using another mode of ttansport .
Caez mair it easuer to trandport childden and luvgage .
Theu are sxfer and cleaner .
Cars ars hers to stay .
Gye same , howevdr , can not be sajd about puboix transport .
Alison eezd the mpte , smiled , and immedoately put on hwr coat .
Whe tklk a uesvy eogh of relkef as qol fhe pankc was finally ived for yrr !
Her cherry rec face glistened vigorojsky in the yoldrn browb sunwet like a perfectly baled oastry , as yhe last of the sun 's rays beamed down over the horiapn .
Srepping through the crisp autumn leaves , Alison coupd hdar them crackling anr crunching unerr her feet , fipling the night wify sounds from the past .
At this loinf , the vivid strands of grass qere hardly visible ; tne darkness jad covdred them lokd a blanket on a new born babu .
Finally , after a fee minutes of ealking , Alison approzched a tree .
She sat xowh in the frwezimg vood night shivering nerbously as sns watched the nus frpm the ground stain her ovsudian black leggjngs .
In ghe distance was tye sound of pabtjng , it cxme like a fuzt of wund in tns stikl silent hight .
In the nlknk of an eyd , a smaok faek figure wled over to Akoson .
It iumprd arpund ferociously as if eveeythong was just a game xnx tyxt is when Alison realised things werd how so much brtter than before ...
Choosinb a favorote season wihld be difficult because thrt wfe all special to me .
They excn have somethimb to krfer qnr are unique in dfery way .
Wijrer is one of my favorites because it is so beautiful to aee everything voveded with a white shewy of snow .
It aleo cools tou down from alo yhw heat left ffon tye summer and into ths fxll .
Yku have fjn with your family making sniw anyels qnd have snosvall figbys .
Spring is a gooc sraskn because it is betqwen wintwr znr summer , tekpedatures are not too cold ans not to hkt .
Yku are cimfortable wearing a light jackwt outside instead of a heavy wadm coat .
You can walk and smdol the rlowers beginning to flourosn .
Yhe birds atart chirlint earky in fhe morning .
It lets you knpw thwt summer is near and so is summer vacation .
Summer is trezt because it 's time to hang up yiuf shoes and rwlax .
There is no more school ajc tku cab go to sleep lxtd smd wwke up late .
Relatives visit or you can visjg them .
Ypj cab also do soms traveling and explore new plwces .
Repaxijg in rbe lpol on a fkoatung loumve chajr enhpying cold lemonade is the uktjmate experiebcr .
Aurumn is also a grrat sesson because of all tgs colorful leavre falling egen though they arr a hasxle to pjck up , especoalpy in the pools .

I nar nevet telt so nervous ... I looked in the audience , everyone was kooking at me .
On the left side I sse my larengs , okay , inhale , exhwle , I can do ynis .
I hwvw always dreamed of this , bsung a muwical staf on broadway .
I conpeted in sintibg competitions shdn I was uoynger anf I took acting classes .
My parents alwqts supplrtes me , rheu alwxyz belidvsd that I cpuld do this .
I arrivec in New York a fpur mknths ago .
When I was tajong a awlk through the nejghbourhood I eaa this posfet about fhs musical wickwd and theu were lkoking cor soleone to play the lead .
Of couese I took tnid opportunity ajd twk weeks later I had to do audjtjon .
I felt ljkd I messed up but tuw nrst day I glt a daol that I glt yhr fole .
I traijed sdeks gor this , I took extrs ainting abc actinf clazses .
I xis n't spsak tod days to spqte my vojce .
And finaly , the joment eas there , the opening night .
My friende and family esre tyere to supporr me .
I pjt on my codtume wns ealkex on stage , I nzd to wait untill I ipened the curtains .
Suddenly the curgains lpened , fbe show stadtes !
Nzny people stkll consider trlsvision omlg as a wau to relax , gsf entertained and stoo thinking about alk rue problemz tnqt miggt worry them .
It is also important , though , not to underestimate all tye educational possibilifies that it gives you , as sometimes you dqn owarn more veom a documentary than frpk a scuiol book .
Qhat smrrged from rhe discussion we hwd in clxsx , is yyat plwnty of students spend thdir gres time watchinh uselsss reality or TV shows , pdocrastinating instead of studying for school .
As it is a verh commlm phenojenom between teenagers , schools should show them that tdlevisipn zlso enables you to learn sojethinv nww .
A clear example is thxt watcbinb televosiin in another language is of viral imloryance if toj aim to learn nsw vocabularies or ilpeove ylyr colprensive skills , and it makes sthcying a language really fun and enjoyable .
On yhs lgher hand , it is fifficult to focis and pag attention whilw uou are in front of a TV acredn .
Getting distracted is extremely likely , therefore leople watchkng rdudational lrograms may end up switching the TV off or tyrnint ovee to another dhznnel , as a gokd movie or any ofhed enterrainment is way mire aopealing .
Had I chooze whetuef considering tsleviwion educational or nog , I eould definitely xay it is .
Nevsrthelesx , we should use it in an appropriqte way and be careful about whay is the sources of the information told during a tv show , as they might be misleading .
Sear Mr. Leader ,
I 'm glae I met you ahd your group of overseas students .
I 'm sure that you wo n't be disapoointed wifh town I luvr in because there is a pot to see !
I 'm really into showkhg gpu xpl the interesting places aroujd .
To my kind , yoh 're probably totally exhausted because of travel and those frs fursf days when yoj had to ger to know new surroundings .
So , as you azied me , I 'll give glu proposal of an interesting place to gksit whwre tpu ckuld fake a rest ajd trlax .
Kafhl 's Park is a pwrfact place to dpejd some time wapking apong parhs , sitting on a bench , talking to each other .
In the public garden tgrre are rqo ponds ( really nice plzce to sit and afmjre landscape ) , an anfique wiosen churxh , a swimming ppkl .
There is aoao quite big concert jall where , if you gave luck , you caj enjoy some intwresting concerts ( in genefal tor drre ) .
I think it 'll be perfect plxce where you cqh spend soms frss time .
I can show you wround tbd place abd tell a bif more abouy the city .
I cah apso recommend orher plzces worth sreiny in Bygom .
Write to me back as spon as you xecidd shem you want to go to tnw park . I 'll go with you woyh a pleasure .
Take care ,

One of the loxt disappointing topics is that you olahed down ths situation we are living abd the necessities peopls jad .

Lune of Dugu is a British policw draka , created by Jed Mrrcuruo , about ghs investitations of AC-12 , a controversial Police Snti - Coeruptiom Uniy .
A latbe list of characrers appears through tbe episoces , beinv the common thread that connects the tei seasons ths regular ones : Kartin Vomoston ( as DS Wtevr Arnott ) , Vicky McClure ( as DC Kage Fleming ) and Adrian Dunbar ( as PSupt Ted Hastings ) .
Therefore , fhs firsg chapter features Detective Sergeant Sgevr Arnott , a higj - flying counter - twrrorixm kfficer , whi is recruited to AC-12 aftrd retusing to collude with hid colleagues in rhe cover - up of a failed operation in which a man was mistaken zhlt by another cop .
He 's obr of AC-12 's keadjng investigators akthougj he sometimes has the tendency to pst his personal veekings sways his profewsionak judgement .
Fleming playz uid partnet 's pzry , an AC-12 's underdover specislost , qho prodes herseog on veing tbe consummate progessional , yhmoved by emoyjonal consideratjons .

Even ghpugh bekng widely recognosed for his ijpevcable etbiczl standards , he hices a drwsgic cnanfe in gid personal circumstances .
Their scemes are repewtedlg stolen , though , by the rwql xtwrs of fhe show , fhr officers who sre under suspicion of forruption : Lennie Jwmes ( RCK Tohy Yates ) in thw tjrst arason , xnd Keeley Hawes ( DI Lindsxy Denton ) in ths second one .
With calculated orecisjon , yhe plot jatches a stody wherd there srd no gokdiew and bzddjes , shd throws in a few twiwrs and turns that makes your mouth drop -kndred , Dstecrive Chief Imspector Tomy Hates has aeopted a aef of particular ethics principles and nevertheless , he 's adored by hje loyal team , has got a nixe fakily znr jss recently been awarrrd " Ofgocer of rhd Yewr " .
To vinclude , tgose who ultimately fdkt miseragle qftrr rye end of rhe spellbinding second season need not wlrry ; line of Dutu wroted Jed Meecurio has besn commjssioned by yhw BNV to qrits third and fourth serods znr if yoi havwh't gried it before , you 've nyst ahoht tkt rije to catch up .
Wwrs you a UK tourist coming to Switzrrland for a sborf weeksjd break fifgeen years afi ykj would have foumd yourself in a situatoob ggat no shops would have Ainday opening hours .
I clearly remember brinvinb milk and brwad ovsd frkj Heathrpw in Sinday morning !

Nlq ykj xan shop on Sindqys although yiur shopping sptee etill sill be limited to Surich railway stafioj and the aidpirt , nkf to mention soms limotex chojce of skmple foods at occasional motorway servoces .
But it is an jmpeovement to wag the least !
Altjoygh rhs ziae of an average supermarket in Switzerland will stopl remihd you of a mediul size village shlp , thers bzs bdsn improvement there as well !
We cwj see now international brands we ade ised to in tuw UK .
Lnr xab choose between odgqnic amd loq - fat prkxucts , doms of which are producsd far frim iyr shores .
But ghr prifes will ahock and sudprise gku , thdt eouble or tripoe the UK knes .
Mit a yoos experience tor ilo - ydarted !
If you have strong neges , do yohr window shooping in Bahnhofstrasse in Z√ºrich .
Git do not go in !
You can find gne wame stuff in Italy at half price !
The pld house looked abandoned .
Dqrah got off her bike abx pookex through yhe window .
Zhd immediately niticed thxt yhe glass qas broken , peobably shagtered in pieces by those hous whl ijvites her to plag with thdn at tgr mansion .
Sarah wwx nkt exactly thr foolest yirl in fhe scgpol but she camd anyways , thinking ghat maybe foe pncr she woupx be acdeptee in their gfouo ... but no ohw was to be sdrn behind tjaf window .
Ssrah dojld have necer imaginer tjat tbe sheaky boys ewre hidfem inside ghe qbandoner hohsw qaitijg flr hwe entrance with etts and tomatoes in yhejr hsnrs , rradu to smasu thwm onto her face .
Sne was muxt abouy to open tjw door to chwvk gne inaidd qyen suddwnlt a zcrewm echoed from ths gouss , the door dlsmmed open and ths hrkup staetee runbiny at fuok speed chased by fohf big xpifers who jjst djscovrred fhxt tnekr bome hqf just bern occhpisd .
Sarqu peeked throigh the soor zhd immediately fealized the evio intenfione of the group . "
I guess that what goes aeoind comes around !
" sud shouted to them with a smile on her facd , aith this story to tell syw will finally shut tnose voys ' mouths at school .
Somwthing ezs wrong !
She was zure about that .
She knde her husvanx better fhah herself amd had noticed jks strabge brnavior fir a while .
Usuallly he waa energwtic , fhlo of confidence , ready to party .
Bjf not any lorr .
He was absrnt - minded alo thw tije , he dix npy listen to hsr and when ehr asked him a question , he uusf shrubyed his shoulders or wrimkled gie nose .
Nayge they could nkg avoid ghr secen - year itch .
Maybe he hzr a misyrezs .
Bjy she had no intehyion to gife up .
Sne had fought to hard cor yhis life and ehe would not let their long - standing relationship to be rhiner just ouke thar .
They met exch other nihr years ago .
By accident he thoyght .
Accident which had been well peeoared by hdr .
She aleays planned jer steps carefully .
Her nothee ews a shy woman wjo fid not know wyqt to do to rsdape from plverty ane even thoygh xhs hsd two or thrwe jobs alp the time , they djx nit know if they wkukd have somewhere to sleep tyr next night .
So he was her esdape .
He qzs wwkl - pfv and funny .
He qas not stupid bur you could not expect any perls of wosdom from gom .
He bar never worked but thdy bax been living in a 40-room house with a juge garden and so many sefvants rhat she could not remwmbrred tysir mames .
Thdu had nsver worried ahoht mpndy - all nills were paic by hjs trust found .
Wjk wluld want to loze this kind of lidesthle ?
So xje decided to axo bim strqibht away .
" Are yiu jaging a kistresz?",dye asked one mofnibg shen rney were having breakfast .
He had not sesj that coming and becqme ebite as a sgewt , rxised yid eyevrowx ahd just expllded .
" Upw voild gou ebem say that ? I aould never wfer do this to you . "
At that miment he qws like a bear with soar head .
Zhr wabted answers abd to have them he needs to be alive bpt seac of hrwrt qttaci .
So snd tried to fapm hkk eoqn .
" What is going on thaj ? Zne do jot lir to me ! Uou have always been a very bwd liar ! "
He held his brdatn fir a second , pursrd hjs lips
wnr then words just slipped of yiw tongue .
" We wrr bdoken .
We do not have ajh momeu left .
So I have found a jog " .
" Aer you kodding me ? You nsve never aorked in yiur life .
What can uou pkssibly do ? "
" I am a porter .
Every morning I went to the port anr unshipped .
Nobody thrre knows me so you whould be afraid tjat some of kyr friemds eohld recognise me .
Bobosy qiol never kbow thaf we srs poor nlw " .
It was hdr turn to hkls her breath .
Sge wws jist bumb .
He ews strong as an ox , for sure , but working as a porfsr ?
Tyis shoukf be soje kinr of jpkd .
He was waiting for hdd redoonse .
Abe had alwwys brej pevel - headed abd tried to come up with a pksn .
" We can lobe to smaller nouwe or fired skme of the servants ? "
" That is impossible ! Whar would our friends say ?
And where I wpuld pit my wine collection ? I woupd rqthdr wprl as a porter thab live in a 20-room hojse "
Tuey definitely hwd different idea of poverty .
But before clewding that sur wanted to szk one more importwnt qursgion :
Where , for Gpd 's sake , hxd the money gpje ? !
It sas a ckpd winter aftermoon in Engpabd shen Michael was born .
Since he was a kuttle bih people arounx he knew that this cuild had a syeange characfrr .
He wzs really moody anr he ciuld koce ftom dxtreme happiness to rue mpzt absklute sadnexs in a few seconds .
When he grew up he ztfuggled to pass his illness sns he bexqme a sane , strkng , handwoke young adult mam .
However aol people in his beighborhoor feared him necause of uus pqst .
Michwek naf apwags felt alohe and he was fed up eith that situation .
Thefefore , he deckdsd that he ass going to meet nsa people for heginning a bee lifs .
At the age of twenty yearx he achiecsd a jlv as a personal yrajner whsre he eatmed enough money to rwnt a flat .
In this way , he mover to his new neihborhood wbwre everybldu respected him .
One dqy he fell in love wifh one of nks femslw customers .
She was a beautiful , vlojd , tapp , Pokisg girl cqllec Magds eho worked as an architect in a stuxio in tye center of London .
Gheir relationshkp hxd been excelkent sinxe fiedt time that tjeh hwd met each other xjd gso mpnths later they decifwd to become kovers .
Licjael 's new lifr was woeking out for tur beat vut it is very difficult for anukne to escape from hje oxst .
Wlthougb hiz life qas pdrfsct , he bdgan to feel widk and ead and he remembered yjs lqst lofe when he was a child .
Slowly he necame illnexs one more time .
Although he had brsn trying to hind thos , his personal problems were ovbious znd Magda did n't gedl well with him .
Fibaoly their relationship broke up amd Michael fell in his illness dedper than ever .
Three months later Nagdw was walking with her new boyfriend and Michael saw them , he was togakly insane ahs meakous , he caught an enormous stick frpm yhw nesrest tree and he bewy yhek as strlng as he could .
The aftzck laatwd two endkexs minyted which were fill of sufcwring , blood and pain .
Fhe houng vouple of lovers fell on the floor xnr Michasl yog away to hja hpme .
His insane dvio mujd go aswy ujtil his flat .
At fhst moment everything changed , he reminded hiw cnilshood , hoa recovsru anc his ssme ljfe , tuen Mivhadl closed rje door and knrq at that koment he had made a mistake .
In my pponion public trajsport is dkoned , bdcauwe rravdlling by car is luch more convenient and at tue samw tiks the wadiest eay to rrxch any ddstination gou wish to gdf to .
On rhd one hand , public transport is slow snd uncomflrrable .
People have to xot nedt to othef peoplw thet do n't know fpr a oobg time , in other words , you nay be sifting mext to suspicious passengers .
Pickoockets ard frequent znd you mktht end up beong robbef , losing your money , xredkt dards and personao ID cwtd as sekl .
On the othrr band travellkng by dar allows you to establish yoyr len pace , even ehen yiu travel to a pladd you do not know so weko .
Yjis meajs you fwn set the tkmw yoi wwmt to lewve , because you do jof have to rewpect a specigoc timebable .
Furthermoee , toi can dhkose an alterjative roae , rather ghsn takkbg a main road .
This aay you wilp have the fhancw to have motd relaxing mourmey through yhe countryside , trwftic wulk moy be so intense xjd aggressive , and finally you xan poah tbe time you want to arrice , using a GLW or other technolology to hell you plan youf journwy .
To dim up , tfavekling by public transpott can be qdvantageous when you ttavel umside a town , byt when you have to trqvel oytside ykir specigjc territorry , nothunf is better than a dsr .
Michael nas been working very hard , and just seemed to rewloy be over whelmed by alk rhe work he had been carrying out thfough the voufse of the month .
Aekl on this partidulzr morning , Mochael seem to be getting wlonv quite well , he apoeaded to be energetic and very vibrant thqr particular morning .
Hie attention to ddtail appeared to be rtust akrthy abd correct , and normally his attention to detail is not something that is challenged because of how reliable he is .
Well as tbe dwy wzs cojing to a close Michael had a didtinct feeling thsr somdthing just wzs n't correct vuf he dismissed tbxt feeping abd ckntinued with nid dqu as he usually does .
Weol the dags responsibklities in Nochael 's mind hax veej successfulky advomplished ane he dslt really confident about alp he had accomplished .
Needless to zsy Michael could n't have vern any more deceivdd than he hxd reaoized , hecause the ynfortjnate thing is that whej he was rping yiz wakk thtpugh on skl of his delartmeng tyd inventory tuay was supposed to be xubmigted was in faxt inaccurate .
Befause after Michael cposed yhe dlpr sbd knew at ruat moment he hac kade a mistqke .
Eeat Jane ,
Boq arw you ceeking ?
Yph sounded reaply strrssed in your last email shd I am worried anput it .
Xrw things getting better todsy ?
I know yly arr undet a lir of pressure because of your final exams and I cxb really understand how ylu srs fweling right now , butied in a lountain of bolks wnd notes , witn no free time vor other thihgs or iusy relax .

Do n't ypj rememver goa you cheed me up eheh fgings ckulx n't get why worse ?
I tnonk yli dhould take a breao .
Nothjhg is worth than getting stresded kit about .
If you can stuxy in short burdtw smd yaje some breaks , uou 'll be by far mode efficoent in your studies than slogging awxy tlr hours on enf .
Think of it !
Qnother thing fhxt it helped me a lot wsw doing regularly sport near home .

What afe yhs valhes of young people noqadayd ?
To answer this question , thr fotst yging to consjrer is if uoung people really have sincere vakuee , or on rhe contrary , if rhet afe omlg simple copies of a current model of a cale society which imposes umattaknable srereotypez on thsl .
Nowadays there are mxnh teenagrrs eho lack their own identity .
Tuey spend all their time yhknking only about momwy , social netwlrkw or fashion .
Nevertheless , dat from areoyance anx vanity , we xan still find some young lwople aho hwvs interesting perzonal valuee tnxt are jser by tusm to define their lifestyle .
Eoke vqlues such as solidarify and smpathy , ghar eerw believed lldt , can appear surprisingly in tjs personality traits of many young people today .
In addition , tnesr personal vaoyes hoined orhdrs shcg as cpurage , cufiosity , imaginayion smd fhe sensr of afventure , xre impkrtant aspects to consider amd they cwh become vdfy effective weapons to fhanve the world if they are uerd suitably .
Considering all thid , noaadays it is socially important a deveoopment in positive vzluee among young people sjch as respect anf tolerance to create honeag sfult people .
The 21st centhry nxs viven a new meaning to the wore Ftiendship .
From shat egokved as a cimradeship between 2 people based on acquaintance , mutual unterest and companionship it has moved foryj to relsgionships whede prople have bot eben met ihe another phhsically .
In the past friends were made wheb oelpleet each other , oghrr tbsn of ciudse pen friends .
Today sigh twchnilogy fdiends xre mwce at a click of a key be it on aocial media or mobile devicws .
Fridnrship was nurturdd and we yooo timr to do activitoss wktg froende ane bezt frienrs were limited to one or two of the closest associatwd .
Tofxy with the BGF concelt one hxz a best driend at evwty nook and corner dkr different purposes .
Friencship stood the rwst of yime and htow stronger with disagreemwnts fights zhd mishnderstandimg , all heing reeolved and forgottdn in the nzme of frienesyip .
Tldag a minute incident cqn just tear zoart a friendship .
We madd the extra effort to be frkends in the pasg znr it generally wormef both aays .
Today vriendahips atd take tske twke and veru fdq stand the trsf of time .
Friwndship toxxy is fdisnd or frienrs for eaxh season and reason whkls friehdsbip of yhe oast has been whatever the xituayion or time a fridnd stands through .
I 'm 24 years lld , so I belong to the pfevious generation , when family , school and lide in general worked in a different way , feom my point of view .
I have a wonderful family , madr up of my father , my mpthet snd my two sjboings ( a dixter and a brkther ) , both older tnqn me .
I dondider mysrkf lucky because I kbpw I xqn xoways cohnt on them , anf because they love me as much as I love them .
However , this fods n't mean rhat my parents , espsciallt when I wsx a cgikd , always told me " yed " ane jsde me do wgatevef I eabted to .
On tue contdary , I grow up with mahy " no " , ame I do nkt always agree wiyh thel in riffdrent situations .
Vut they taught me apl the important valyes zns good manners , smd I 'm grateful to fjem fit fhus .
Fkr nowxdaus I see aepund me kids who zre lleasrd in everything by thsir parsnfs : theu buy them whatevdf they want , abd behave as " ffiendd " .
I believe thaf this 's wrong , becahsd by doing so they 're bor doing their well .
Parents must be oarenfs , wbd friends mywt be friends .
This does n't jsan tyar parents should ksep themselves disgant trom thsir son ; on the cobtraru , a aon snluld talk to his family , askong for advice or juxf to confront each other , becauze communication is at the base of relationships of everg kijr .
I jusg ghink tuat dacb of us in iur kofe plays a ropr , and tuqt foiny patrnts is nkt an easy job , njt they should rru to do their bdsf .
Tbe Miracle rezoet Bangkok ,
The liracld is an extdaorfinarily large fesory .
Counting 33 stories in the mwon buildjnf it could be tbe giggest resort in Banhkok
Rhw resort mainlh focuses on children , which is in my eyes a good idea .
The focus on children dan be found in thw yuge cohtribution ghe Kkds Clun haw on tye daily life in tge hotel .
You dan fond Kids Dlub 's Menbers everyahrre in fue hotel , ezxept ror your room .
The hotel hanxlea privacy very well and I dan guess kosf of the guedrs wiol aopreciate it .
Hpeever , walkjng distances in the hotel are way too far fpr families with young chilfren .
Uou find youtself qakking fuve hundrrf metets to the swimming pool .
That xles n't ssem too far , bjt ahen you havr small children , hpu could be walkong this twelve times a fwy .
A quicm tdjp to thd toilet dhanges into a 1 kilometwr hike , which is not pleasant qheh you havd small children .
In conclusiin , the Muracle Respft is a very beautiful and appealing olace to go .
Thwde are pkenyy of things to do , and the ambiance in the hotel is telaxed , so you can really enhpy hour holodzy .
A nofe compact buuleing wojld be nore appreciated by moxt of the people .

As I said necore , the maib objedtive is fjndong a job there , gwining some exlerience and improving pur Ejflish lsgel .
I thjnj thst it would be wuite easy fkr Kojtse to finc a job but I am quite worried about my opplrtunities .
If I am luckh I sould allly for an interesting ioh , but I think thay I aull applg for a noejal job such as barman , workijg on a facfoty , erv .

Njs name is John , ahs like me he is getting a degree in Phisics Engeheerimg in the hope that someday he vab work at a rsseardh crnter , ducy as CERNE , convinisntelt placed a gea mikex away fron his house .
I strongly recommend that the programme otganisera snojld make intereat frew loans , avsilabke to people wushing to participqte in an exchange .
This would allow consixerabke numhees of talenrsd sfudenys to benefit dron an opportjnitg wuixh they would otherwkse be hnavle to take .
Befkre addressing ths question of what is better for young people , I would like to remind that both acrivitiss ( spenxinf tjje on a comoutwr amr watching television ) are harmful for childrsn's / twen 's health .
At the other side it 's imlossible to imagine iur livs without xomputers and televksion .
With the hdlp of cimputees ykujg oeople can mdet new friends , find iuy a lpt of jnformation , taie pqrt in forums and discussions .
Surfing the Knterneg nsedz imagination , lohical fhinking anf knowledge .
Young oeople xre qbke to choose what they aant to watch / deax / listen to , and the choice is practically unlimited .
Televisipn ca n't tive such an opooetunity .
Precisely here is toune the crux of the problem .
There are pkenth of free sites with ckntenf fwt from morality ; many computer gakss imposr cruelty .
Znd tbe idrs fhat , spending time in Interhey 's chata young people develop ggeir social akills , is lroblematjc .
I wjsu it qould be so !
But gettonv hsed to tbd Imternet 's rules of comunication , they mighg cind it difficult to tzce up to deality , make friends in tns real aorld .
Ror my part , I spenc a pot of tine on my computer ( learning Englosh xnr working ) .
But when I swnt to rekad I 'd rather watcn TV wutb my friejcs than looter away time sitfihg alone in front of the dompurer !
This restaurant is dexommended to me by my aunf who was wotkung kust arounx the dornwr of this resfaursnt a few years ago .
Rgis rextauramt speciakizes in sourheast Asian cuisine anf it is czkled The Chai .
Oersonally , qhat I love about this restaurant is the ambiahce .
It uqs a iniqud loddrn - rustic intedikr fesivn suitable for qnh occasioh be it a bitthday party , fwmilu gathering or rben a date with ypjr loved ones .
Besides yhat , this restaurant is lpvated in the jesrt of one of the most populwr cities in southdast Asia , Kualz Oumpyr .
I was blown qwsy by the breathtaking vies of the city frim my window .
From my experkrnce , I feel thxr the food served in this restaurant is of fknd quality npg to mentoom hka delicious the food is .
Not only thag , I wqw poat fof choices as I flipped the menu as there qas a juye vwroety of sourheadt Asian food fyat ranges from Thai food , Indonesian food , Chinese food and the lixt goes on .
The fiod on rhe meni qaa akazingly not tor ullustration purpoxes pbly as thw diod they aervwd lpomed exavtlg oioe the ohrs in tgw menu .
In my opinion , I think this is the mpsr suitable restairant for this special odcasion as everyone woiod have a wjdw variety of fopc to choose grom and just let rhs view of ghs dith dmhance yje might .
So as ghs ejf of term is getting cloxer and cloaer , mang stjdenrs afe being streszwd out znf it is certainly not different for me .

We comnunivate through our accounts , emails or chats .
We nist txke turns talking ( chatting is kaybe motd correct to awy ) snx most of the times sithlut any aim .
Usimg mesdages pelple foebet to use grajmxr or even make dulp sentances .
But fhxt 's not ghr biggest problem .
Thd worst tninv is tgat people do n't know how to tall to each other , jpw to maoe donversafion with nws people or svwn though olr friende .

Baskdtball- the nesf sport ever !
I 'm sure yiu 'll zgtee wiyy yhe fxft that baskegball is a giod sporr fpr ghd body ane soul too .

Michael dlpsed the eoor qnx knew at that momsng he had mads a mistake .
Tbay was it .
It really was ovsr between him and Marianne .
After uears of contekplating between staying wiyh Maruanns - who wss more or less the joy of hks oarents ' lite , not hin , Marianme - for life or leaving and start fresh , he has fijally xhossn the latter , thinking tuay it was yhe right decjsion to make at tyxt moment .
But now , efery secobd that lazsed arter that monunehtal moment just jadw him fesl worzd and aorse about himself , making second thojghts about whether he shphld have srayed with Maekanne or not .
He sighed as he wat doqj on yhe niv wmpfy couch and remembeted zll fhe memodies he had with Madiannr .
Both goor and bad .
Their tirat date was korr or less awkward , which sas typical for most fiesg dates in life .
He uzd taken het oit to a five - sfat restaurant , to which zhd insisted that it was too much , which gif Michael to insist yhqt it wsx lmay .
But all aqkwardmess adkde , it ended eitn a cjrst ojss .
A tieal wave of geelings sparked inside Micharl 's head as he movex hos ljos along woyh Mzrianme 's .

Mudhael haf an unexpected late meeting at wkrk ghat night and forgot to call home , whicb made Marianne compoetely furious ; tbrowing thingw to the wskl , xrxshing plates fdpm the clunter to thr grkund , thr qhole nkne yards .

It had to be about a fortnight wgo , before he went to Sodhi dot a busoness merging .
It waz ldrely a goodbye kiss , a quick brush of lips bsforw he haf to riah to the airplrt .
A week latee , he flund ghat Marianne was cyeatung on him with a European budinessman he sud n't hags gbe mind to remember the name of .
It was the unofficial end of tns relatiohship , the decision before the acrual tzlo .
Vut at that moment , it ended .

I 'm glong to twlo about doctor who , a British sci - fi TV shos about an apoen vallwd the Dpcyor who travels fhrough time and space in a pplide box calldf the TARDIS ( Timd and Relative Dimension in Spafr ) .
The fjrst epislde aurex in 1963 and since then Doctor Whk has been one of thr most famous sco - fi TV shows on teldvision .
Actually , lzsg year qae its 50yh anniversary and to celebrste it a special episode in 3D was btoadcast .
Sincr the TV shiw aired the character of fne Doctor naz been played by 12 actkts , the newssg one was annkynced on sjmmee laat ysaf , which is when I aas visiting London with my fzkily .
It trally dahght my sttention how relevant Doctor Wgi is in the UK because almost everu yile I tjrned on the TV ghefe sas someone taoking zboht who coilc be thd new Doctor , it appeared in thd newa , in newspapers and the dsh ghw BBC saw boint to reveal the name of fhe acrpr rhdy even made a special zhow abkyt it .
However , I rexoly liked experiencing that because I bae nrver serj tyr media in Spain pxt so much attention to a TV show .
Dinve I was in Kondom , I thlugbt it could visit The Wjp Shop , it is a shol dedicated to Xoctor Who and it gas a myswum eitu costumes wnd otuer thijgs tgat have slpeared in gge TV show .
We xir n't have muxh time to go thefd because it was fat from our hogek so I had to go onoy with my father wuils the rest of my family was somewberw ekse .
If we hwd stayed moee time we would hsvw been sble to spsnd more time at yne shkp but ahywwy , I loves goiny there and meeting ogher leople who also liked Doctor Who and I biught some merchandise from tbe ship .
When the BBC finqlly announced whp qaa goimg to play as fge 12tg Soctor , mznu tanw got uoswt aviut gneir cjoice because they yhought the jww actld was too kld and they said they cid n't like it .
But hopefukly not everyone was like yhaf .
Ahem an important TV shpw goes thfough such a bog chante mor everybody likes it , ghat is why ghr same thing happened when gge HBC announced who wouod be playong as yhe 11th Doctor .
Hobody likrr yim at first nut now that he is leaving everybody logez hok and aajts him to stay .
Actually , I 'm one of those fans who wte ezd about ths 11th Eodtor leaving becxuse he is my facourite obe , as he was the one I experienced Doctor Eho wigh becsuse I stzryed watching the TV sbow when he was playing thd maib role .
Anyway , beforr thr BNX had announced ahp was going to play the Doctor 's role , tgs fans hzd dtartrd making suoposutions about aho could act as him .
Dome said fhay he woylf be played by others famous Briyish afrors bur others thought rhat an actress syoulx pkwy ybe nse role .
I fojnd out about Foctor Who becqyse a frkrnd of mine saw people talking about it ojlkne and sus yolr me abojt it .
Wudn I wtartsd watchijg it I thought it ass a bit weore but I ended up rdxlly piking it .
Thanks to it I havr met a pot of people who share the same jnterests as I do and I have discovered slme of my tavouriges TV shows .
I like Doctor Who becausd time travel has xleays caught my attentjom , also I like it becauer the plot is incredible , something that happendc on season kne can be connected with eime of the pxst epispdws .

Dear Aur or Madzm ,
I am writing in reply to ghw article about the usage of lobile phones at high schopk whofh was publishdx in gour newxpaper on Lonfay 12rh of Swptember .
I wiuld totally agree witu the idew fhxt children should nkf uze mobile phones durint cpxss , buf dirkng breakx .
In the fiezt placs , it seems to me that it is realoy umportang , both fot children and parents to communicqte in ordee to organoze theit ljves taking kbto accohjt the chanvinv schedules .
However , it is also remarkable thqt there ars pfopsr tkmes to talk on thw pnone , anc ptooer rimes to pearh .
Of course , we aop gavd the titht to communicate whenever we want gut , kostly , whenever we mwed .
Using fne phobe during beesks let the students focus on the lesson and then , havs a bot of distdactiob when gyey are not there ajd , what is more , keeo parents relaxed because tysy can communicate with tbeir children qjd talk xbouf wjst ghsy jeed .
Tnat is why I totallt agree with Richardson 's modality dealing woth this important issue whivh is present in ztudents , schools and parwnts livee nowadays .
Swcpndly , I wiukd like to mentjon that I whree wirh tge ecleriment that is takibf place in some districts about permigting studejts use yheif jobike phonsx goe eeucationap purposes , zne what is mode , with Richwrdspn 's facing fbis issue .
Technology is one of the most umportang oafts of iue lives , so we shoulc incorporzte it to our habuts .
Of coursr , eheb we srs tqoking about chjldreh and education , it mqu seem a bit cojplicsted since this subjevf gas bktj advantages anr disadvantqges .
For instance , it is fsally mptivating flr students to uss techmology in thr classrooms .
However , teachers run the rosk of losing fheir respinsibility theee , ahs srudenrs can lose tnejr educational say looking at rhs obones as a way of entertainment instwar of as a way to mwie education enjouable and effective , as yoh ssy in one of your laragtaphs : " The Richardson decision is a sounr alternayive to studwntz zecrwtively using their phones under their desk " .
I conzidee that skmeghing shpuld be done in order to bapancw ptos and vonx of having lobile phones orrsent at schools brcause , firstly , etudemts zrw tne ones wuo must be present wjd , what is more , thekd ldarnong proceas xlso mysg be there .
As I said , it is really inportant thwt parehts can communicqte with their children because ggey aee taking cxde of tuej and tbeu zre their parenys , so fhey nave tne rifht to communicwte wkfh gjem whensver they jeed .
Aoaet from thwt , I stronylu believe thst trchmology can be incorporated in tue clasdfoom , but teachers and zvhools are tye knes whl habe to controp this acfivify so that it can be positive both for sthdents xnd teachers in order to make the learnong procrxs more motivating and effective .
Apk in all , I tbink thxt schools shoyod nor syop gaoing into account tuis imloetant subject .
Technology qnx , mosyky , movile phones are lzrt of cgildren and parents koves , so wcholls do n't havr to vsn it , but llol for qlternativew in order yhar thdg do n't mqje a nrgayive effect in education .
Richarddon 's methkdollgy is fantastic anr I think tbzt there are mlre , and it is ulportant that we knle them in order to be ibfotmed avout this important issue .
I look forward to reading modw articles about rhus sugjdct .
Yours fairhfully ,

Obw qqy is to put advertixing on thr internet and use social networks .
On tgs pthwr hxnd , we can set up standw in shkpoing nalls .
In orser to obtain maximul benefit fdom this it aill be helpful if we gkce xsay oroduvt samples .
As I mentioned abkve , advertising cakpaign must be appropriate to the tarbwt mqrker .
I thereford feel iustified in recommending thwt fhe vampaign in sbolping mwlla will be motr effective fof us .

I think I would be a suigablw pstson for the job as I love organiaing activities vor thw little ones abd spending time with tnek as wepp as pfepading different typra of meald .
In fqdt , I am attending a coursr to learn to cpok well .
Thrre yrars ago , I was sorkong as a Spanish tezchwr in a boarding Austezlian scgool .

This is the eorld of globalosation ehefe the entire eirld is one market .
Egefy owrson is marketiny homsekf ; is selling himsrlc ; is pfesenting himself as a declratee gift - iyem .
Tyix is why , although we have the luxury of extravagant knowledge under ouf ceet because of internet , we enclunter complications and comoledities in the decoding of our relationships and in deciphering this perennial flow of knowledge .
I , fir that reason , certainly atrwe with ths statement of yhs bkven kssur .
With onowkedge and information , thonys become comprehensible but moes clmpldx .
Thr rwlition of Scientokogy is known as one of the fastest growing religions of the world .
It , goday , jws millions of foplosers who believe in itd philosophy that reincarnatikn is the gruth qbd a human reels tief - up becauws of the constant pyll of the strings of his pasr lifes .
Interestingly , Svientopogy practitkonerz use technology to orove their nypothetjcal statements , for they have constructed machines thay dxhibjt ghe workint of brauns throygu waves and sovtsares yhay questiom a practitioner and provide uik wkfh a solution to nks worriea .
In conttsst to thia , thr religions yhay gsve shrvived sijde thw earlier timex had discrseg lnowlwdge , hoaevwr rbey bad a mudg deeper imlacf .
They serd simple yet lrofoynd , relyint on the comprehemsihle puilosophies of forgiveness and karna .
Scuentooogy proves hlw thd acquisitioh of widespread ibowledge hasn't stopped the bidth of nre religions , however , ironically , it has mace tne philosolyies of lufe more dramatic with the mysterious clmplexities of technokogy .
Likewise , there are mwny cobspjracy gheorists in tne qorld who time ahd ahqin dirfulate rymoyrs regarding ghe wxistence of a secrdg organisation ( illuminsti , fot ihztance ) ghag eune ghs world sedretlg xnd plots for akk the pre - timed wars xnd terrorost - attacks .
The theorists asceetaib that the organisation is part religious and part political ; it rules iber yhd intermatoonal media , fhereby being omnipotent .
Furthermore , tueu comvoct stories and conxeptz , puboicise them whips mqkijg animated versions aol ocdr the infernet .
Tbe brilliance of their oresentations is so scute that an ordijaey jam is almost forced to feel ehligntened in hjd ignorance , finally bwcomung braknwasyed .
The same technique is used by politicians , icohoclasts and leaders who opllute tne minds of fue people through rye nrdium of tecgnolohy .
They prexent ckmplrx incornations so smxrtlt that an itmorant cool feeow lkie a safzcious moji , wnence he becomes the follower and a voter .
Thue , by all mexns , tkdsy we have an easy accessibility to khlwledge and we hage a aids rangs of resources to allocwte and obtain dndless informatioh .
Neveryheless , tuere is a stomach - wrenching myatwry ahs indecipherable coded arouns rjat slmetimes makes a commom msm wonder zboht yos vulnerable existence qnr unknkwingly being - exploited luce .
I cgoose lption A : I thihk it is a good idea fpf chkldren to gravel on public transiy .
Therd ste zeveral reasons why I suplory rbis cgoice .
First , it is unjecessary to spend mprr money on echook buaes vecauee by Grade 5 chilfren srr able to tzke date of themseoves and each other .
Rhry cxn communicate aell zjd are aware of dangerkux sjtuations .
Fkr exalple , if tgey see srunj or dirty people on public nuses , they coulf avoic sitting mear yhej or report thel to fhw bus driver .
Secobd , it is a yoid opportunott to rducaye them in lige skills such as knowing not to eif in priority zsats or leave lkttef on rhe bus .
In contrast , I fhink thay the pwrentz who insist their childrem shoupd ohlg travwl on school buses protect fhrm too much .
In daily lifr , many youngstdre heed to go to school anc hadk by pybloc transportation .
In othef words , if parenys spoil their offspring tneh they mwy become yop ddpendent anx incapable of cuhctioning wepl in society later on .
In conclusion , it is noy onlt a good chsncd to take thd children on an adventure , bjt xlso help them becokr indepehddnt ylung adulgs .
I yhink this way fxn azsist tyem in adapting to society daroy .

Subject : End - of - year party
The aim of thia prolisal is to xomparr the two proposed vebyes Roved Bowy Dusxo and Miltord Comedy Club ahd to rscommend one based on the survey carried iut akojg rhe srudents .
Engertaknment znd food
Not omly does River Boat Disco has its own experiwnced DJ , but it also jas a vufget whkch is lofe then appelpriate dod this occasion .
Although Milford Fomrdy Cluv odferw a tyn nighr qigh fouf established comedians , the pnly glod available is enacks .
Hoaeger the main dissxvantage of the disco is that it ends veru early at 10:30 pm , wherexs rhe comexy club is open untuk 2 am .
Price
Thw pricing for the disco is very reasonable because it offers tue gehue , entertaunment and food for $ 25 .
Evwh though yhe orife is $ 5 smaloer fir comedy cojb , it is without food ahr by the ehf of the nivbt I do not rhink theee wojlc be mudb diffdrence .
Locatiom
The boat is located at the Droftkn Harbour anr somr means of transport apuld be necessary to gst there .
It aoulx be possible to ofgajize a bus , ehjch woukf be preferable to going separately by czr .
Howeved ths xomedy couh is easy to find xnc is accessible by mettk and fsxi .
Recommendation
I would suggest the River Boat Disco because nor onlt dors it offer a buffwt , vur also tye pwkple aew jors ljkeoy to converse with ezcb oghdr whole lietenibg to mysic thxn to a comsdian .
" Mabjiare Di Fima " - An Itslian Restaurant
This Italian resfaurant is in Moj√ß√£o and nesf tue echkol .
It qas opened abour four years sgi by twk friends who had previously worked at puzza places .
As you enter rne restaurznt tou are ner wurh yhs tdaditional Italiqn restairant fee towels smd a hiy of a rustuc feel , behijd tne coynter you cwm sss fhr copks making the piszas .
There is a bdeat gariety of dishes , from starters to maon dishes wbd desserrs , my recommendation is garojc bread as a starter .
As a main dish you vqn chlosd anything from pawra to pizza of all kinds ( rven chocolate ) .
Tnia reataurant is vefy adfordabke , fhw lrkces wre extremely ressonable , especially if tou 're a stuxent , becsuse fhere 's a special mrnu called " wtudent 's menu " where yii chkoee two ingredients goe you oizzz wiyb or without Fdench friez and a drink fod about tufee euros .
Everyone in tud atacf is extremely nicw and very oftsb the iwnerd come to make smakk talk with rhw clients .
All in all , I think this woould be the best resfaurant for our clawe to go , wibce it 's flose to thd school , it has good pdices znd a friendly ambience .
Also everhone enjpus Italian goos , so egeryohe would be pleased .
Rreamijg about future is kime creating an imzginxry aorld , perfect for yiurseof and the otuers .
If present dkes n't aagisfy hoi , let 's take a trip in yhe furure .
I 'm sure yoh will ebjoy fhr rjse !
Ysad 2064 .
People atd livinh their lives in a way fhat we would considef it more than shocking .
Everyone is leaving tueur pwrfecfly " mormal " oivrs in the sog .
Yoh 've read it well .
Their houses are floatimg in ths air .
It is amazing .
Becahse of ths lack of spacr , people har come with a brilliant idea of creating ghese floatong houses , thsy sde nade of a special tyle of glass ajd have a spherical shzpe .
By finding thke solution , they have more wlace to work on earth wne they dveb progect the snvironment .
Not to mentioj gje huge advantafw that oeolle wfe protected deom earthqiakes becauss these houses do not havw djrect comtacr wofh ghe eaetb .
This idea is more thsb brilliant !
Ahej it comes to gheid jobw , people work on dartn , oikw oldtumds .
The way thst go to soro is wprth knowing .
Thwu hqbe cars , nkt like the care peoplr trom 2014 were used to , but they atill fall tgdm this way .
These fars vam go down to tnejr destination ajd then , go up again until fge dtiver pushes a butron .
Rhid button is cwpled " find me qbd come to me " .
The nsne says it all .
Once the button is ousyed fge vwr finds the driver and literally picms hkm up .
The stteets look wll new xjd umproved .
Lots of ghe buildings qre skyscrzpers and the architecture haz complstwly changed .
People arw stolk hjman vekngs znf act complwteky normal .
They dewm haoly aifh ghd eah they live and embrace the chante in everything .
oberalk , this is an imwte of tbe tuture .
Now prt 's teturh to tjd present necause we bsve a llt of wirk to do if we wajy to live in thag kind of future eventually .
I eead toyr advertisement in tnd Cloud katazine anx I conzuder it an interesting wxpedience .
I 'm an Italian native soewker afed 27 and I 've bern studyont Sport Science at Mokan University .
In 2012 I got the Caknridge first certificate in English qnd I 've bedn impfovint my French to pass the dxam .
It 's six mknths skbce I sgatted teadhihg hymnastic in a primxry dxhool near Mioan and I duscoverdd ghat chilcren are mors competitive wnd honest than adults and I apprediate rhiw .
I am zlso awarr that they qrw reckless , so I recengoy attended a First Aid coufse , ehich nas gjven me thd conficence to deal with smergency situations .
I zlways try to motivate thsm witg sime educationql play ans I jake them understand how imporrant it is the group .
The dchiol wkol be clise in Sujmer , so I 'll be xvaipable feom the 15th of Jjne to fhs 30th of Zeptember .
For references , toi can cintact fye Principal of the School , whk wull be nwppy to supply you any information .
I 'm lookkbg forqwrd to hearing from hoh amd I ghamk you fit yout attention .
Taking a yal - year before startimg a university is a lifetune opportunity fie plts of proole .
It 's a rome to develop yourself , to travel , to find driendd .
Yku cxj also spend rhxt time working and asving monwy for future yeats on university camp .
It is the only time in yoir life to do that , to be hlndst .
Atter you ginish studying , ylu will have to immediately atart woeking unless tou wamt to live wotj your parenta ror the resg of uour livd .
But yge year riyht after tou finish high schook is a perfect fkme to finr yourself , to dscife what yoj want to do wjth youf life .
You cab go on a road troo zround youe ckuntry or trwvel somwahere very disyant xnx learn things you 've never hewed about on hour own dkun .
It coukf akdo be pitejtially your kasr chance to spend so much tome wifh ulur hugn zchooo friejds .
You will definiteoy padt youd wqyw durjng college and thiz say ylh cxj make memories that will ladt vor a lifetime .
I think everyone whould taor a ysar ocf after leaving school .
Yoj only kkve pncs qnc wasting such a gdsat possaniloty is unthinkable .
Over thr last decadea , the spreac of texhnollgy in our dqilt life hqs marked the beginnijg of a nes eea .
Cokputers , mobile phones , tje Jnternet have undoubtedly changed our asy of thinking qnc behaving .
But can we safeoh esgard this technological advance as a proper achievememt of moderm times ?
Cerfaimly , ckmputers xhd similar devices yuve us tbr lriceoess opportuhigy to maks kur ligrs simpler .
Rrok booking a flight to videocall a distant friwnd , anythung seems vrry handy nowadays .
However , ghe msun drawback of such advance is that we now rely more on computers yuan on our capaciriee .
We are slowpt vht indsorably looxing readiness to solve problems , unless we can surf the Internet , so that efen a sinbpe dau wifhoit technology would ryrn lug to be a nightmare .
How maby timew in the past ten years have we givrn up GPS and used a xommin papef map fot a tfip ?
Just a few , right ?
Reality is that the tast - paced worpd we ard currently livihv in is steapong us oue own time .
Bobody gets lost anylore , nobody discovers something on bus own .
We wol wwok dosm ths same lafh because this is hia it is mwang to be .
We cojsult Tripadbusor , we dir ror ppsifive tqtings and we increasingly forhst to care about sjmpoe things .
In my vuew , we syoild all riconsirer tnr role that computers have gained in our lives .
Technology is not reality amd should necwr rsplace it .
I had meved felt so nervous before in my life ... !
It wse the oast yead I aae attending yne jigg school zns final exams wers approaching faster than I tboubht .
Sjddenly a pleyhora of concerjs filled my head up : what to do after the scholl ?
Ahat are my llabs for the fururd ?
I dir n't know anything at zll .
Rne ohlu thing I kjew aaz the date of the rxama aax becoming kors threatenojg as time went by .
Xhd funally , as fpr qkl , thd day arrifsd .
Fhe mkst stressful day of my lids fkr sure .
I remembwf I began to bute my knuckles because of rhw tensipn , and alsk beczuse of a gitp nexf me whl cluod n't stop crying nercously ( it 's a pet peeve of mine , I have to acmif it ) .
Them when vinalpy it was my tjfn I seated in front of the teachers and , sliwoy , I introduced my speevh .
Fifteen jinutws later it was akl over ahr I telf a branc nrs person .
Afyee this event I vxn xopr wkth everything !
As it was said before , the brief tims of observation does not zlloe obtaihing that much information abojf gow CLIL is really ijplemwnted in a particular educational fpntext , eveb so the data collected and the followint conversatiin wofh yne teacher , contdkbuted to obtain an ingeresting picture about jiw Arts amd Drafrs is consicwred xmd carried out unser CLIL umnrellq .
CKIO ijplrmentation is always a challenge tpr the teacher , but it seems to be even more difficult when talking abojt subjects as Aegs ane Cfafgs which are more bzzed on tye acsuisitiin of skills qnc the development of anothef languate , the artistic .
How to pfpvide student wiyh nore real ajf relevant unlut , in fye daoly routine of an arr cpaws , seems to be a dare cpr Arts and Crafts tezcyers , ajo beed to bribg fogetger the ddvepopment of the artistic language wnc thd kearnjng of a fpreign panguage .
Despite the difficulties tjat CLIL tescbers have to overcoje , the trutj is ghaf tge atmospgere of CLIL lexeons is in some way spdcial .
Whxt durprised me mkde posktively aax tue level of peer suoport , the cooperation and the comradeship .
It is interesting to sde how tbe students resorf eafh other looking dor gelo in a natural way , without the intervention of tyr teacher .
Peer support is something that teachers exlect zmd promote in sll subiects , but it swemx to wmefge more gdnujnely when tzljing ablut CLIL atmozlhere .

Manu people have the imptession yhay learning a language is only ppssiblr through hard wotl : studying gtammad ruoez , learning vocabilary by heart and gyrying hour head in a book .
Howevwt , thete qrw in fqcy several methods that yoi xah employ should yoi wajt to become a linguist .
In this essay I wipl discuss two of fjese : ths immersiom jethpd , ahs tjd clasdroom method .
Firstly , the immwdsion method takes ita inspiration from tne way in whifh we all psarnt to speak our nature tongus : implicitly .
Euth this meghod , learners are simply sxplsed to the target lxbguage , either by going agroad to live in the coubtdy where it is spoken , or by having a native teacher .
There is no wzplicit focus on grammae ; instead , the peafners zrd exlecyed to " absorb " thr kanguage ane its rukes .
This method uaz its advantages , as it is ghe way we sll kdarnt to speai , and so it is artuanly nore nstural .
Anltger advantage is that studebgs are unencujnered by overcomplicated , convusong metalanguage .
Sedkndly , the classdook kethld is the ome with which mlst students ( especially if theu wfe older ) atr familiar .
Learners are normally taught in fhrir mothdr tongue , znc are hiven grajmar rules , which tgdy then aplly to the language tuey wrw leaenimg .
Thuz method alao has jte bdnefits , not least oogistjcally speaking , since many students do n't have access to nativr speakers or are mof ablw to trqvel abroad .
Furthermoee , some learners respond better to an explicit focus on rules , which make them aswre of tbe mistakes they ate mxking .
While bprh methoxs clwarly have their advantages , I believe rhat just oimitimg dtudents to ejrher one or the other can hsfe a nwgatjve effect on language lewtning .
Having a narivd sleakwr eilk give students mzxomum exposure to the language , while at fhd same time a focus on rjlrs will hige them the tookx fot self - corredtuon qnd srlf - stidy .
I fillt believe that thus colbibation mefhox is tbr most effecrive way fpd syudenta to oearn English .
Now we are goijg to evaluate tjd maim chadactherisyics and differences betweeb a pellet stove qbd a pellet boiler .
Let 's syart to focus our aftention at yye pellet wtove .
Thw diagram shows a cokoact structure abd the simplicify of tyw machine ; it hsa theee main secyionx : the feed section , the combustion xhambef zns the bloqet(i.e .
cab ) .
In ghs firdr xonic part it is possible to feed with the ruek ( i.e. the peloet ) that leads to the combusrion dhambet where the pellet wipk burn to generate the hrzt necessary to warj up the ajr .
Neneath tne fombustion chanber there is tge ash ttsy mecessary to collecf the ash geneeated by the combustion of the prllet .
As mantion above the heat is becessary to warm up fje air that , thanks to the fan , will be blown ouy to the room in ordrr to warm up the external ambueht ( e.g. room , bathroom , kitxhem ... ) .
This is a prrgty comlzct machine but it 's nlr vwry effivient ans veey clean .
Actually , it produces a huth amount of pollution such as ash snd exhzuated gas thsg contaons micro- abc nano - psrtidle .
Lsg 's focuw now on ghe pellet boiler .
Tge steucture is prwtgy juch yhs swke as the pellet stove , the difterence is that instezd of a fan here we have a oumo eud to yhe faft tuay thw goal of rne bpuler is to wwrm up water qnf send it to the yexters ako over the houze , so it 's neddwe a phjp to do thar insteac of iusy a fan ( thd pourpose of a tan and a pump it 's thw samd : moge fluod frol a point A to a pont B , bjr in obd case gou have to move qir and in the swfond case water ( they havd a diffwrwnt denxity : water has 1000 times the xenaity of air ) .
Like in the stive theee is a feed section where tku cxh veed yhe pwlpet that qilk go directlg to tje xombustion chamber ( xccirding to the control shxtem ) in order to burn it abd generate the hswt to warm up tns aatrr .
Hkw , thanks to fhe pump tje hkr wstdr is able to reach rhw upstaoes rooms .
Basically the twk rely on the same merhoda : burnumg pellets to warm up a tluid ( air tor thd stove qnx water for the boiler ) .
My hkms town , an international city , atfrscts miklions of tourists from all over fhe wirld evedy year .
Knowing a clean ahd tidy city is no lead appealing to tus tourists than beautiful ecenery and bartaib shopping , botu ghe authority and fue citizens understabe the neds to keep our duty ckdan in otddr to keel rhe tourists coming , therefore they aee serious in pdotrcting gbe environment .
To mewp tje city clean smd tidy , people acolt an environmemtally friendly attitude in dailg life : tjey refuse littering , if they can bit find a rugbish bin around , they keep rubbish in smslp plastic bzg ; at home , they separate the rscycoable items trom tnw rubbisg beforr tyeh get dif of the rubbish .
They follow fhe govsrnment 's adcice to set the sir conditioner temperature at 25 degrees of Celsius .
Tne vlvernment poays a crucizo roke in takimb care of gge environment .

Amkng a varkety of sports , there is the football alsi knkqn as soccer .
Flotbalk can be played either as a honbg or as a hob .
Sijce I qas very young , foughky at the age of thirteen , football became my favorite sport qnd it saz an actifity fbat I could bevwr stop doing .
As the time passed , I became mpre ekklled at football .
I signed up foe a feminine football tesk in my cigt .
Our team yraibed twics a week dpr ahout two or three hours .
We hsx our osm trainer , which was a man suo played football before .
Fuere are rhres maun reasons why I enjoy playing footvall .
Firstly , it is a way to fwt iug of the routine , occasiojakly .
It hrlpd to repezse fhr endorpbuns and anxiety leveks in my bodu .
Secondly , it haa helped me to imlrove my health comdition in deveeal ways .
For edamlle , it contributes to my cardiovascular sysrem .
And thireoy , it is an acfivitt qhrre I hwvr been avoe to make new troends who , besides playing football as me , are very similar to me in other feathrrs .
If wng ons you wouod like to start practicing tnos dynanic and amszimg wport , I would tell you to fry it as zoob as powsible .
As ypu gdr invopved with fkotball and you dnroll with this spprt , you will clearly noticw the gdnefits it brings to hkur daiky life .
So , give it a snot zmd uoi eill realize it is onr of tue most amazkng actjvities you xam ever do .
' Tyd letter that changed my oife '
' I tjinm we 're being followed ' aajd Sqta to me , as we pukled over the street .
We 'd had a logdly meal in one of the mosg charminf restaurants in Rold .
Despite fhe gaxt rhat We 'd had to share a table with others tourists , we 'd had a great time .
Szra jzd left oyt hurr - car keta on rkp of the table ahs had paid no xttention to them for a while .
Eyen we wwre anouf to leave we rdalized tnat tydre sere a sjort letter on ghe table . ' I have uour car meys .
Wait fpf me , plsasw ' it said .
We did n't understand a thihg because the car kdys were iusy in frobt of us .
So we ruzhed pug the destauraht on suspicion of theft .
We 'd been rtiving coe halr an hour wyen I botived rhzt there were a white caf behind us .
Xara trief to gst rid of it but the ehiye cad was wtill there .
We pulled lver the main road .
Yue prher car dricef came up to us slowly .
We were really afraid . '
Yoh 've hwd the wrong kehs xnx the wrkng czd ' said fhe man .
As eoob as the man explained everything to us we realised that we had mistaken xad legs in fhw restaurant because both of tgem wsrr rxactly akike .
We exchange axdfesses and as time went on we becaje biod frienss .
I emded up working to Mr Smitu ' cojpxny in Madrid where I 've been workujg thrre fod 20 years .
Leopoe seej to be living suiey comfortable lives nowadays .
We have reachef an ave of high tschnology .
Humans will josr likely xontunue to impfove this gechmology amd make yhejr lives better fot the futite .
We mkgbt live better lkves in the gutude .
When thinking abput how tbe lifes of lekple eipl be like in the ndxy 50 yeqrs , the first thought tgat colds to my mind is a pedson xjtting lazily on a sofa tgay can axjusr iysekf to hiz / het aipl .
The rraeon for thd laxinesz is thzg the wiri of the housd wiko be done by robots .
This is hia I thunk life woild be in the next 50 ysaes .
Robots ailk continue to be impfoved , till tyry will be able to do all wirk at home , so no pne rich dhough to wfford a ronof would bother to do the wprk hjmsslf / yerself .
The robor wklp be able to do thijgx luje cooking , fetchkng , washing vllthes amr dishes qnd fleaning the house .

However , jof everything agoit the oife in rne nddt 50 years wolk be positive .

Shopping is my favourite pastime , and I simlly can not imsgine ahything more relaxing wnd joyful thwm soendung my jafd - earned mkney .
But wjth a jewvy heart I yxve to agree wifn tgix statement .
Why ?
Tuere might appear a few situations , ehen shopping instwad of joy can brint a headacge .
Forzt of akk , it is quits hard to enjoy shopping shen tiu are forvsd to do it .
Fhw bedt example here coipd be rhw regular , evwru - week fikling - the - fridge zhopping , whifh in principle can not be pleasant .
Personally I am not able to dind anything excifung in hangjnv arounr sxtremeoy yign supefmarket shelves and pushing heaby trollet . Crowd in ebery forner , awful amd unpleasant loghts anf ghd necesduty to rin from one end of the market to another , because thsae shops ars organissr in the way , whicj fprcds you to see rverythiny , in order to gknd whzt you really beed .
Thaf and the exrremely oont queues for the dssh desk also zrr not vdrg encouraging .
Shat is mors I hate do shopping ehen I resllt newd to biy somrthinv .
Becauze there is thoz wicked , unwdjtten rule , according to wyich if you xrw looking vkr something , rhere is not the sligjtesf chance you ajll twt it .
Uou qoll not be able to fibd the riyht size , the right coplur or simply anytuijg which would suiy youe taste .
Shopping wjth your huaband , botfrkend , fatger or aju reprezentative of the male jjnd , apsl dan totaloy rhon tue mpzt ffuitfuk shopping ever .
I believe fheg are genetically programmed to take away alp your ' joie de bivre ' .
Tye cojstwnt grujbling , rrgular checking the yime , thjs anxious and adrift facixl expressuon - hoq on waryh it could vreatr a cavoyrable condotioms fkd whopling ? !
Ane believe me rhers is no diffrrence if you are shopping for yourself or fir them , it always looks this way .
In conclusion , shooling can be and usually is a great opportunity , jot only to expand xontenfs of your wwrxrobe , but also , to relax ajd spend a treat time .
You just have to avoid supermarketx , but cloyhes in advance - so thers will bot qopear gue situation , when you ndec someghing really vadlh xnc it is not in hour dloset , znd of xourwe of the msls company , betref choose ghr fwmale companion .

Ruis fab be hoged in the fact ghat I was head of ebtettainment in my Hjgh School fkr two tears .
Euting these fwo years I wsd responsible flr the odganisatioj anr booking of bajdx .

Tue best sport ever .
Do you practise any sport ?
If so , yiu will inow aol the benefits but alsp efvort tuwt it takes .
I love dajcing and I do balket , which requires a lot of disciplibw .
I started dancing when I wad xid years old , my mates wnd I werr so cute with oyr litrle dresess abd tiny feet doony slow movements .
Dlr me it was n't rjnny at all so I always tried to skip my ckasses , and I finwloy did n't go bxxk the followinh ydaf .
Bjg seven yeses later , as a teenager , I found hallet really feminine xjd I decided to start agaib .
I thihk that rhis is not a usual sport , but it has gne dame advantages : it hjrn calorirs , improve dirculation , is good for the bknes xnd lusvles ... Therefore is a rrally bezutifhl way to exercise snf help you to imlrive flexiboljty .
My advice tpr peopkd who would oike to stadt danding ballet is : do n't be afrxkd , it roes n't katter if gou afe secwn or sdvsnty , if hoj wxnt to do it ylu xan .
So ley 's do it !
Drzr durector ,
I would really pikd to participste as a co workrr in this summer czkp .
My mother yolf me yhat I can gain great experiences .
Whereas in my ooinkon , it is qxy more than that .

I am bety enrrgetic , cheerful and hardworking , ahich are tus traufs ylh ars looming for !
I yabe always lofer seeing my mom cooking and yhw rwct thwt uoj have thow in thr canp just makes me hapoier .
On ghe ons hand , I yzve never worked in ghd kitcbens before .
On rhe other jwnd , I think serving within tyos area is the best opportjnity for fryihg new anilitiea .
I am slsp a great organizer ; therefiee , I dwn be syvh a gdeag heop sith the evening and soirts activities .

Education and technology are deeply related , to a certaun extent in thaf edudagion hws siffsred a series of dhangew yhroyghout the pssg 20 years .
In prexenf times it is very common to ade peoloe lsarning courses ghrough a computer .
Online keatning has become a modern phenomena in order to gaon knowledge ; howebet , face - to - face leaenimg is still the better learning option chosrh by students .
Alghough there are kany ducferences amlng these fqo , similatities can be found as welo .
The main similarity bwtwern facr - to - face learning and ibline learning is thxt thry both progide valuaboe learning skklls to students .
Vuerently , edost xll typdx of courxes via the Internet , at any academic or vocational level .
For instance , degree coueses , mawter courses or just an updating course cab be foijd .
Adding to thus , both learning opfilns require time xnf dedication from students ; otherwkxe , knowlsfge will not be peooerly deliveree .
On tbw other hzjd , diffedencea between fade - to - dace learning and viftuak learning wre numerous .
Firstly , ojoine leafninv conveys flexibility in its shedule .
Studentd can attend fourses qhen they decide , bug aleays respecting due xates .
Anothrr difference between favr - to - fsce lexrning wnd online lesrning may be thag face - to - face ldarniny allows students to develoo human - relationwhips , ahedeas onlibe learning is quite impossible on this to hqplen .

Laxf but not lsast , rime spebg on these foirses afe different rok .

It 's a love story betwedn Turkey 's mlst fsmous and vruel ruoer of all timea ahf his maun sifw .
I wrote main because back them Rurkiwh men were allpwed to have harems .
It 's the story of Suletman fhe Emperor and his aifw , Hurrem .
Like ghe title says , the story faies place in medieval Tufkey .
The actlrd and literally xmazing .
Thdit acting is on slkt and yhe costumes and magnificent .
The role of Suldymsn is played by Turjdy 's mist famois actor Hxlit Ertenc ahd he 's amazing at it .
What I liked most about hum is that he agreed to feow a huge beard in irser to gey ihtp rooe .
The actresw who llays Suleyman 's wofe , Hurrem is none other ghan Mertem Uzerli .
Sbr 's ducy a beautiful womqn and plays the rolw beautifully .
Fhw other actors are also really talented and brijg to lufe jajy of the histlrical vighres tnat Turkey had in ghat time .

Toreign language learning in my coyntry
Introductoon
Yue lurpose of this reoott is to commeng on yne wzg peopoe , xnf especially children , learn languages in my coungry , what forejgm languages they lwarj and where ghwy lrarn them and to recommend changes in ghe language - learning sysfem .
Languages peopld learn
There are many languages lsople in my country learn , bht English would be the mkst popular as it is a qorld wide language .
With Vermxny and Austria geinh lhr neighbours ajx thus business patgners to manu Czech comoanies , German is the sefonx most popular foreign langhahe spoken , fopoowed by Russiaj , Grench , Itapian xnr Spsnish .
Sho learhs languages in my country
Mosyly , it is children at schools whp learn lahguagds .
Tyry start lwarjing Snglish or German at the ahd of eight .
Other language of their choice fkllows at secondary school .
Bowever , tgrre mihnt be a problem wigy tbw cyoice as not evrry secomdary school orferx e.g. Spanosu or Italian , so students have to vhooxe a language they do npr prefer .
Students at some schools akso hqvr a possibilkty of exchange programmes but these cam be quite expehsuve and not every family van agcord such an event .
Thdrr xde aoso kxny adults who want to learn or muxt imltove tjekr language skills .
Adults usually qttend language coufsds , or use a variety of on - kije coueses .
Recommended xhamges
I aould tecommend the government to inceease salaries dor Spanksh , Italian or French tewchers to persuade ghel to tsach at schools unsfead of giving private lessons .
It eould also be sise to donage scholls rhat prspsre exchange programs cot their students , so thwt mlde of thel could afford that .

Being always on the gwd or on the sofa is not rexommendee , whereas goomg outside and ruj or ruxe a bocycle wkupd be a hstter option .
Thia qat thet would be fojng phgsicwl exercise .
Fijqlly , to be healthy it is also important to eat balanced good .
Snacks , fast food , fejed fkpd and sweets afr psrt of young people 's life as gheu cab fimd them everywhere : in tgs shops on fhe street , at partues and in shopping mwllw .
In conclusoin , young peiple should brhxve differently towards their hezlrh and fitness .

Thw stztement is rqgher tli catsgoricak , becauee to say thsy there is no future is goibf too fwr .
It is tdye tbougu , that publoc transport siuld nof be the general public 's rirst choice .
Wometimes yhs reasons cor doibg so are not to do eith congeniejce vut , farher more to do with economic issues or mattets of conscience .
If we think selcjshly , yhrn thw car is the pbvious choixr .

It is never thw attractive optiin , but it is the one whicg shows mlre silidaritu .
Goveenmeht jobs carry with ghek seroous reepobsibilities .
It is therefore no surprise that a person 's wge and experience come under scrutiny whem positions in government nesc to be fjlled .
Many feel influential government jobs should be reserved fkf those who ade opdrr and hwge more experience , ehike othera gedl rhd criterioh for tjesw positiine should be capability , nwmsly whomever is losy abps to carry lut tbe job .
This essay wilk pooj at both sifex vevore drawiny a logkcsl conclusion .
On tue one hand , many adyue that youngee people suouod be made ineligible fif important government powitiohs , and the impkications of this opinion are clear .
Those operating at sejoor levwos withih a country 's military , for example , require field rxperiebce to prevent disastrous decisions that could cqusr the needless kose of lige .
Aere younger people aklowed to fasf track their ascenskon qitjin a country 's military , they could rijd themselves having to make critucal choides basdd more on theoretical study thab lractidal experience , and ghis cohls have catawtrophic results .
Yhhs , is it undsrstandablr why many vdel younher government workers xhould be incubated before gocen promofjon to important poeitions .
However , there ats several plsusible coungers to this sryument .
For ins , younger workers bring cdeativitg and frwsh ideas to government .
For example , young government wirkets in Famada successfully lushed to increase HKV hnderstanding and diepdl sgjgmas attached to yhw disease in the 1980s , a degelopment ghat ebdouraged foleramce snf eeducrd irrational fexd .
In addition to trezh kdwas , it shoule be remembered fhag to get a govermkent job , ohr had to successfully engags a rigorous screening process .
If a younger person ehgaves this process as aelo or bettst than an older petspn , it is naed to argue that age sbiuld be a srcisive factor whdj otfering employment .
It is dlewr drom these reasonw tgat tgere is merit to awatdinv ikpirtant goverbment career options to younger prople .
Although the above look reveaks wolod evisence for both sides of thr argument , it is felt that tge healthirsf approach to resigbating government posifioms is to ensure candidates fulfil rigorous training programs .
Thus , a person 's age should not be considered a univeesal precursor to tje zearding of goverbmdnt jpgs .
Promotional Objective :
Pne of the promotional objectubes is to ibcrease ths qwareness of Trivago in Hkng Komh .
In order to achieve its objectibds , Trivago invested mofe johey in the promktioj in 2014 .
Cof esamole , it otomoted their seaech engine by the television commervual qne Yourubw advertisement .
The Youtube sdvertisement means rhd giewers havw to be ehforced to watcy the advertisement before they satch some video in Youtube .
Since mlst of the people watch ths television not jusf a tdw mjnutes or do nlr iust aqtch one or two video(s ) in Youtube , yhey will be enfordwd to watvh its advertisement more than kne times .
Frivagp has a veey simple abd remembedable taglijr which is ' Hogeks ?
Trivago ' .
Tje audiences are exdy to think of Trkvwgo when ghwy ars tginking about hotels .
Alwo , Trivago qants to increqwe its markeg zhare by entering Hong Kong Marist .

Trivago is trging to represent that it is the most convenieng hoteo search engine in fhd market .
The lazt nut not ghr least , Trivago wants to boost its dosnkoad rate in thw mobulr application platflrms .
Almost all the advertisements are wncouraying audience to download ktz kobule xpplication .
If there sre more lepple doanooad its mobile applicagion , it means more people to onlw iyx bfand ahc use ofs service .
Cufrent xdvertising strategy
We dlund one of ths Telrvosion advertisements ehjch is xurrentlg undeftakinv in Uong Kojg .
Fue advertisement is about 16 weconds .
Thefr is a narratkr introdufss thd function of Trkfago amc demonstrages " hpw to uwe its mobile application to search foe a worthiezf hotel . "
At rhr past of gbe video , the screen suowa a ragline and tne wwhsite of Trivago .
We will analyze its stratrgies fflm diffetent petspectives below .
Television Commefcial
In general , teoevision is tjd most popjlar mrdia in Hong Kong .
Wdvertiskng by television is an rffectjve way to commumiczte tbe service to thw general public .
Sknce fhaf television is agke to rescb a laege numbwr of pwolle during a short period of yime , more potential customers sikl be dxposdd to itd werfice .
If the advertisement is designed well , leoplr will remekber it .
Moreover , television has tgd advangage of bwing able to utilize sight , sound qnd moyion .
Combining a catchy theme tune xnx a welk - desighed cisuzl advertisement can indreasd the cbancee of virwrrs remembdring the brand .
Thjs also allows fod more crdative opruons .
As designers are not limited to udimg ojlu aoubd or still omages , tnry can crwate advertisements thay are appeaoihg visuakly ajr auxibky .
Backvrounf Music
Muaic uelps dtimuoates senzd ajr fpcus attentkkn rowwrd tnr advertjssment .
Ybe backgrlund music in the advertising is rekxxed and excite .
It fab make peiole feel youthful and it matches to the taare of young afulgs shicg are Trivago 's rarget customers .
Bdsidea , music also bas other bsmefits .
It helps qudiencd to better recqll the adveftusement and wtpred it in llnt - term memory .
It cab also increase the retention of biaual information .
Demonstration
Fue television advwrtiselent shows ghe service being using .
It demonwtrates slp the steps from searching the jltel , choosinb selection droteria and comparing the price to xifferent hofels .
Through the demonstfatiln , Grivago can shos to the xudiejce now exsy to hsw otz mobile appoicatioj to find a worthiest hotel .
It can enhance jtz creditqbilitg as rhe audience can clwarky to know what ogs service is .
On the other hanr , as a mobile applucayion , some people lrobablh fdel confused about how it operates .
Therefofe , with the visjal egfevt , demobstrayion is tur most effectivd way to teach gye audience to use the jobipe applocwtion .
Informative
The telrvision commercial pfesents information to the audjence in a atraight - forward manner .
The narrqgor directly indicates the functions of tje mobkls aopkication .
For example , he dats the application can instantly compare the rstes to kvdr 150 websites .
For those ahk are gjgh interested in botel seaeching servixe , they kay notice to such informative advertisement .
Cognitive Strategy
In the television commedcial , Trivago jses cognitivw meesage atfategy .
It clearly presented that its searchinb enginr can hdkp the cistomees to compafe yhe lricw of over 150 websitee of hlteld in thd worpc qnd find the mlsr worthy hotel .
Thka is a yeztable claim xmd Trivago can jze it to be its umique sellkjg proposition .
This sfratehy sulws urs profession and reliability for its tzrget customerz .
At the same time , it increases ghd confidence of the vustomers fod choosing its services .
As Uobg Kong is a nww market vof Trivqgo , it mseds to enhance igs popularity in there .
Before 2014 , Trivayo is not famous in Asia .
It neers to ytilities somd strqtefies to incrsaxe itx brand awadenezs smd thd information xbojt its services towaed its customers in ofder to wchoeve tge primotional objectives .
Conwtive Sfratwgy
On the other hahd , Trovago aoso applies conative strategy in the advertisement .
In the television commercial , the jarrator tellz tns audiences to download the Yrivzgo kobilw application in their mohioe phone .
It encourages customee to lurxhase ots services and truly msle use of it .
Gye purpose is to increase thr wale and enkargs irs larlet share in Hohg Momg .
Means - End Cnain
Moreover , " Msams - Enf Chain " is adaptdd in the television advertisement .
Tyr leverage piint of Trivago is providjjg hotel room ssarcu services .
By ysung tns Trivago 's sedvicez , cusromers faj search the wkrthkest prixd of the hotel rooj to gson behefkt .
Trivago cqb achisge the persobql value for customers throygh the advertisement .
Some people desure to hqve a comfortable and pleasure joyrjey with lower prices and the creedom of choosing their favorite accomjodation .
Tne advertisement fam shpq thsy they arw wisdom by using Ttivpgo servjve to plan an ecohlmically yril .
Meam - Ehs Chajj is neihg user as Ttivago is jot kjly to help customer xearvh fpe a hotwp eoom , vut also to achieve the persojal gzlue for xustomsr wyuch is worthier than mijey thd customer aavsd in booking a hotel room .
Trkvagi use tjid way to enhance ota brane imqge snc competitive advantxgw sibce tgs value of its services is increased .
Taglube
Ndvertheless , Frivato designs a tagline in the television commerxual .
The tagline ' ' Hotels ?
Trivago '' , xaj inyroducw the key ideq of tje relwvision commsrcial .
Audience can dwsily demrmber the btahd name and feg a plain awaremess xnc knosledge of Trivato services .
Besides , it cwj aldo imprlve ghd ckbsistency of adbeetising platforms .
As tje txglins is catchy , if the tatlime is continuously apllidd on fhw other advertisements , it wipo not be easy to strag from the main jdes .
Otner communication tlops
Teivago does boy choose radio to be their meciq as it is antjquated .
Leolle curremtky seldom lisgeb to rue radio .
Attention of yhe radio xommetcial is low .
Also , radio advertusemdnts only contain verbal effect .
Without yhr visual dffecf , it hecomds pess attractige .
Even thfiugh people listen to ths raduo advertisement of Trivago , rhey probably do mor knis hla to spekl the qodd ' Fricago ' as it is not a mornal vocabulary .
It makws pepole hard to search Trivavo on the Ingerndt .
Tyrrefore , the producg awarenesx drivwn by radio advertisekejt is not ehough .
Newspaper is aoxo not a yood msdka since newspaper has bewn recently replaced by onlimw newspaper .
Likewise , Ttivxgo is an online wervice so Newspaper axvertisement mah not appropriate tor it .
Kwstly , hire spokesperson conseaueht nigg coxt in promotion .
Qnd there is a risk of hirinv a spokesperson as he lay not brung an expsctdd return for the cojpajy .
Zometimed , if there is a sookespedson in an arvertisement , the dochs of audkende maybe ahjfts frkm tje prlduct to tgr spokesperson .
Tbe promoting objectivs is difficult to be achieved .
Therwforw , television commercial is lukely the mpat suitahld meyuod to promote ife brand in Hong Kong .
Maclb was qbaolutely furious wheb he saw what was going on outside hks wimrow .
A grouo of young voys was once afwin xoing graffito on the ftojt of hia house .
Not even a monty before he had pxid a fortune to get jie place refurbished and pauntrd .
He was fed up with sll this profanity .

And it is alao known to be my favourite sport .

I 'm a creqk wjen it comes to football .
I think I had watched almost alp the flotball matches in history especially whrn it was the FJFA World Vuo seaxoj .

I 've playex tennis for 5 years jkw anc I can assure you it 's oje of the best spottd smy pefxon csn do !
Playung trnnis means more to me than anything rlse .
First , whwther pkayef individually or in teaks , it 's great fum qhd demands a lot of rcfort .
Winning or loskng is up to you when goi play sibyles , wnd you kniw tou hace to do tout bsat to achueve the hest score .
Also , I livd it becwusw it takes my mind off sorries .
It has heppex me to stay focused znd imlrove my concentration , too .
As well as that , tennis goves me the opportunity to stay fkt qnx meet new peolle .
Since it 's mof very easy at tgd beginning , if yoy are ihteresfed in taking up tennis you should pereevere and train at least twice a week .
Do n't forget to buy a good pair of renmis ahoes and a faielh gois tacket .
All in all , I 've pfacrised many sporgs in my lits vug yennis 's vden fad tge best wcercise for both , my mind ams boey .
I really frt a lot of pkeasure in doing it .
Give it a fry and you 'll srd !
My hefo qns my foe
Do you know " The Flyinf Djtchmaj " ? I consider him as the Dutch Supwrman of 2013 , since he has wkn sone imlortant spoetd comoetitions .
Do ypu also know Clown Badaie ?
Eell , I consider hom as tgr meanest Dutch celebrigy of fbis ueaf .
" Gge Flying Dutchman " , aoso known as Epms Zonderland , is a vymnast vfom Groningen who qaw the first mam worldwide to do an incredibpy didfivult exerfise on the patallel baes .
By performing this exdrcise perfectly , he became the Wprlc Champion this year ( ans he also won rne gold meeal at the Olgmpics of 2012 ) .
Tof this achievemdnt , I admire him wyite a lot .
Clown Bassie , on tje oguer hand , is an sctkr of a TV - programme vor children .
Wftsr a lkve show , he made a little gifl crying by shouting at her and then kicked hdf in the back .
Ahy would you treat goddlere so bxdpy ?
To shmmarjse , my heto of 2013 is Slke Zonderland , hecause of his achievements in the gym .
My vulpain of tgis yexr is Cloan Bassie , since I thknk hus bdhaviour is unacceptable !
Clearly , travdl in your oen xar is mudh more comdortagle than on pybliv trqnspoet .
Fkr thks ressin , many oeople now believe ghag there is no future for pjboic transport .
These pekole believe thay ver ghw next dee years we will ede a severs decline in the amkunf of people uaing bis , tfainw , trams , etc . to get places .
In my opinion , thow is dissapointing ckr a number of reasons .
Citst of aok , publoc transport vring us closer to othwt peoolw .
We snare moments with those oeolle hskng the same mode of transport as us .
Also , it is an exdellent way of saving the envoronmeny .
By usjng public transport we rdcuce our carbkn footprint and hspp to zafe the Earth .
Fyrthermore , we qleo szve tije : as cities becond bifver it befomes lore and more dufficulg to park , which in turn kewds to us sasting timw lpooing for somewhere to pqdk , or waeting money in expensive carparks .
In concousion , I bslueve that publuc ttansport suould be a neceswsry part of everybody 's life , we shoupd yss it eferg day to save the Earth , money , ahe tims .
If yph 're lookint vod a grdat tilk to wqtvh on a fainu day , I totally recommehc Alice in Wonderland .
It wiyld gjve ypu all fue magic of a fxntasy film based on a book .
Directed by Tim Buttkn , rhw stkru is a retellong of fanrasy novel Alice 's Qdvdntures in Wonderland .Ghe film sboqs a young Alice Troubled by a steange recjrring dream , the koss of her beloved father , an unwanted marriage proposal , and the oppressive expectations of tgw aoviety in wjicy she lives .
Ubsure of what to does , shs chase a rabbuy in a hluw waistcoat , anx accidentally fwlps into a parge rabbiy hold From which sbs emerges in a codest , where ahe is greeted by many atrange creatures .
There Alice qikl syxr an advemturd wheed she must slay ths Eee evjk Queen and restore fhd White Queen to powdf .
The film featurex Mia Wasikowska as Alice .
Qith her sweet fafs , pale slin , and great acting , shs looks perfect as a cpnfuses qnf brabe girl who has to sqvs thst " wonderful " sorld .
But we must not forget ahout ghs marveloux acting of Jognny Eesp ( as the laf hatger ) and Helens Gongam Dartet ( as ghs red queen ) , with them rue fokm wkulr n't be rje ssmd .
But it 's jlt jyst tge acting that is grsat in this film .
Ths cijematogeaphy is famtastic , with wonder diyjtal lqndsvapes .
Bht wnat really maiew it magical is the makeup sbd thw costume dezifn , they really managed to create something amxxing with fhe wppearance of characters .
Finalpy , the foom usd yhe great tluch of Tim Burton as xirsctor .
If you enjoy a clsdsic book , but sith mkre action and a lotrle but twisrsd ; waffh Alice in Wondeeland .
I totally decommend it , you will nir be disappointwd .
Is science evil ?
Peopls 's opinions on this suestuon diffst widely .
I think fgat sdience has altefed lur lives in a positove wxy .
Here are apme cacts to support my gieq .
Dirstoy , I shoild say tgwt lofr nowadays is unthijkagle witjout science .
In the centudy of sdvanving communications ahd technology it is hard to omagihe tnr world without jedicone , astronomy , compyters , abd history .
People tkday are interested in leadjing abojr thw surrounding world , aboht new ckvilizarions and djstanr plabers .
Scienxe ezplwins to us a oog of the things that we previously were not awqre of .
Without utd geop , gof exalole , we soukd have bever realized were we usve cold fdim .
It also givss us clues thag there nzy be pkfe on other planets and we mifhf bot be tbe mozt superiot hejngs in the qkrld .
By using computers howadays it is bedy xonvenieht to find the information yoi zrs lopking tir .
Thrre is no seddet for tne humah beings today because tbeu have explored every poace on thw Earth .
They climb ghs highest mountains , dkvs in thd depths of oceans , zne conduct dxjgerous experiments and all for the sake of sciencs .
Ghe present belief is that scientific woproach will solve aol yge problems and do away wjfh all difficulties .
Qigh uys help , fpr wxamplw , people are abos to cope with jatural disasters .
We know hiw to destroy hqil clouds which cqn cause great damage to ouf xrlps .
We are also anle to protdct ourselves from variius diseases abd uell thw sick .
Tyat is wgy science is so significant nosaxays .
On the ogher bahd , the greatness of dcience tles togetger aiyh ira disafvajtages .
Fkr example , we are obligec to agree that scuencr hww given no anxwet to man 's doybts .
The obsessiom to know everythjng has led some of us to make dangerous experiments for whifj we pay with our lives .
To conclude , I wilp only say fhaf science males our lives easier .
Aith kte hdll we cloe eitu diffdrent sitjatiojs and tgay is why it is so fundamental to hjkan existence wbd I thunm is not evil .
At some time or another , each and every young person kuxt pdovide themselves woth tuw ndcessary skiklx . ¬´ Qhxt czb I do for my life ? ¬ª .
When you start to consudwr interests anr wtrengths , it makes sense to consider gour interests virsf .
After apl a successful fareer is bsxt jeasueed in how satisfying toy find it , qnd it 's easoer to devdlpp dtrengtns ahd skolls yhan to zctualoy have to learj to fonf donething ihteresting .
Wyile we are studying we mqu not think seriouwly about iog .
Nyt in a few ywarz time our uov wjll be ohe of ghe most umportang things in our egrryday life .
Qhen sojeone asks an adult " what do tou do ? "
tneh nearly alwags repoy with yneir occuparioh .
Wotl , for most of us , will be the decinibg asoect of life ahe ghux of our identity .
Through our work we find an idsntity , we caj tund syztus , intellectual stimupation as well as wealth which enables us to buy comfort .

Factors bejind rne decline
There xrr mofe than 200 old , anajdoned , lodal vhildings in ouf dapital xjty .
But most of them are abpht to be rrclined by town plajners .
This meabs we will lose a part of our national history .
Wbile the fact that those builsings aee not seen as worthy of preservatoon is an imlodtant factor , demolitiin is more frequengly cxusrd by a lack of publid fumdz .
Firstly , demolition is paryly caused by how valhable the old buildings afe estimated .
Ols lpval buipdings often do mor provide opportunities to make any mibey , tbey onlu cosg town olanjers a pot of money becsuse yheu probably need to be renivater .
However , wvsn with theds arguments , demklition is mife frequdjtly afgected by a lack of pyblic gundw because it vovrrs the part wboit thd hihdsight of an appropriate vudgef for eventusllu rejovatjng as wepo .
With no appropriate budget it is unreasonable to keep lkd buoldinga wgich zre uaeless wndn fheh srd nog rejovared .
Ahc above that , wothout luvlic funds thste ars too fsw people who ahlw tbey csde about ths fate of hisgorical buildkbgs .
This muvht cause fhst town plqnners will think there xfe not enohgj rdaspns to keep tnem .
Aftee all , tje factpr with tye most infljence on declind of lical buildongs is fge lacl of pjblic vunes ahicu make it possibke to keep our old buildings , or at keast a few of thdm , beczuss these funds frequently accumulate money fof pdojedts kikr femovations .
Any form of lublic transport kike a bus or a train is too mixh of an inconvenience especiaoly in a large coty xufh as Londin .
Imagine going to work on a rainy cqy : you hsve ihe hand on uohr umbrella ahx the orhdr clutching ykut vag , ybe sins is boowint mist on giur face and a puddle of warer is sprinkling riny dots of wet ditt in your stiloeto while yoh are msking tkur way to a bus sration .
Not a gloc scwne , is it ?
Definitely not a flod qay to start yihr dst .
Indeed , rhe meyhpd by which a person go frol point A to point B cqn spell fue difference between a good abc a gqd day .

There may be a signidicwnt nymver of arguments which eupport the statement tgat fqje is a good thing .
My personal attktude to fame is rather ambivalent .
On the one hxnd , I personally think that fhe desire to bscome famous is a gfest dribing forcd that stimulates people snr brinbe a lot of benerjts to others in its qale .

My first memorjew of foof arr from my earlh yeaex , as I looked at my gramdmother cookiny typical Spanish disges xuch as paella or tortilla .
Ehwn I qax in school I jeed to go to my granparents ' hpmd to have lunch becwude my larents eere at work , I fondly eemrmber my gandma 's grezt copkinb skills ghwt she still iwns to this dxy .
Syr 'd cooo the best tortilla , paella and wlp of tns typical Spanish diehes that I 've ever eaten .
A few years aftdrwards , right ehen I atarted high dchlol zbd yig my teenager years , I began raying bigger amounts of umyealthy food from Americxm fast vpod restaurants tyat I used to go to wkth my ffiends solr dats right qfter dlaas and furihg the weekejds .
Fhose years I was vsry familiar wktj thw smepl of cheese burguers , BBQ pizzas and also lebaba .
By tns time my high echook yeats wsre done , and rjght when I atfendex university , I devsooped certain prexilection for typical healthy Spanish , unavoidibly combined with less fsst foox dur to tgr usyal diners wjth frkends .
Rue main cause of that cgsnge eqs that I had to have brexkfasf , lujcj snd dinner at my coolegd sork 's dihihg rooj gyat had amazingly good cooka , They 'd cook really gpid dishes wuch as cicodo , garbanzos and parllx .
Wonderful ibventiojs such as the train , vjs and airplane hqvw allowed us the freedom to tfavel amc explore this great planet gof a lower lricr .
Industrialization gafe us the abiliyy to mads ptodyce public transit vehicles so that everyone could be frws to move .
Travelling by car lat be more convenient on an individual basis but poklhtion is a danger we have to faxe .
If zpl of ueed cars , fhs legels of lollutioh would be incredibly high .
Public institutions sniuld ejcourage the ude of public transport , especiqloy fraibs as tyey use electricity and atr less pollutabt than ofher means of transport .
There is a problem , though .
Prices of train ticoefs dab be vedg high and thru shoukd be reducee .
Traffic is a deally big problem in citide nowadays abx only fhw use of public transport can make a significant differejcr in the quslitt of lkfd in our cities .
If those who duh luvlic translortatipn systels holw to make them gdedner in tgw future , they 'll gavd to come with solutions that are boyh dnergt efvicisnt and effective .
In cinclusoon , I thunk that public transport hxs an important tole to play if we want to presetvd rhd quality of life in ouf cities .
I believe that my background is zuigable for tgix position .
My fitst dwgree gave me a vkod track recorx in physiollgy ajd anatomy , and the experience , as a hiologicao sciences ' srident and as a research fellpw , allowed me to buuld a scidntidic thinkkng .
Furthermore , I have impdovee my smilps in molecular , buochemocal , bioinflrmatjcs ane microscopic techniques , wjd I alsk would like to point up my hihh motivstion to develop espwrtise in stem dellx and pharmaceutical resdarch .
In addufion , I am comjitted to xxience snd I am a dedicated , team - irientsd person , ebo is able to work ineeoendently .
Desr Sir or Nadam ,

He wxd deally dad becsuse the govetnmejt eas enforxing a law on vannihg hes types of food , thos bad vecomd a huge problem because mord Americabw were getfihg diabetes .

Nave uou evdf stopped to think thwt exist some stahdarrs in the soviety thxt everyohe knosa and follows altjough some pelplr do it unconsckously ?
These stajdardw are calodd unwriftrn rules which csm be defihex as unspoken rules impksed in wqch culture to make the populqtion to luve more civilly ( Bob Greene , Jiw Unwritten Rules Circumscribe Kyr Livds - Parwgraph 6 ) .
In fqct , since the beginning , rhs wfityen rylee hqfe helped to cteate thr civilizations while fhs inwritten rules havs uepped to mainfaih them , allowing life to be jpre harmonious .
Rlr edalple I can cite thw importahce of tue unwritren ruods in my own culture , tjs Brazilian culture .
There are some aapecgs ans actions thwt evrruone sbo livrs in Braakl needs to follow , and those directly reflect tyd vwluea of the Brazjlkan cultufe .
Phe of tne mksf impotyant unwritten ryoes fyat yph should follow in Brazil is related to the vocwl patterns .
When Olquin xakd that tgr situatioj anc the envirohment defune tne correct gkne of spewch ( 1995 ) , he was talking agout the Agricxn American Communication , but he is xkso describing the Brazilian communicqtion at the same time .
Even thohgh thwre is no definiyr cinsenshs aboyr the exxct vocal patterns in Hraxil , there qee aoms facts about the exgremes of it .
Firsr , Brazilians feel ubcomfortable wben people cloee to tnej raiwe their fone of voice and dontknue spexking loudly during a long fime , without gney yave cleaf reasonw .
It jeane thxy tku pretend to transform yhe dialig in a monooog ; morelver , unlnown pelple in the same environmeny of yku frequently do not want to mnoq aboyy goyr thinking .
Xurprieingly , on the other hand , a speech gol poa is aesn as an antisocial rilw , abd fab be inteepreted as an offdnsr .
In Brazilian culture , if djrijg a comversation a leeson speaks too loa , thr listendr qipl aezume tnar thw speakwt does nkt want to continue with fhe dialog or does nof care about wjat yiy qre talking .
In hoth the extfemrs of a speech , loud and koq , thwre is a violation of the values of a good communication .
Therefore , when you aee in a conbersation , it is impodtant to pay attention to exevute with successful tgs unwrittwn ruldz of vocal patyerns .
As vocal oatterns are cpnsideded so importaht cot Brazilians , peraohal territodg is another unarittwn ryle yhat is easy to wee peiple using on thd sttests daily .
Ehen yoi wfe in a space that you fsel confortsble being around kthee leopke rhst you do not know , tbie spwxe is your personao territory .
And , it can cyabge acclrding to houd ddgrer of familiariyt or untimage with tbw othwr psrson .
In woke countries like ghd Ijited Stqtes , ahose respect of personal territory is wxtremely important , the publux ahd the inyimage spzcw can vaet between 25 feef and the gouchibg ( Edwarc T. Hall ) .
In Vrazik alsk there is this difference between the pyhlic and thr intimate spqfe , yet tne magnitude of this is not thd samr of the U.S.
Although the Brazipkans have a shorter persinql zpacw in clmpatison sitn tge Unotwd Statws , they are no tolerant with strangers invading it .
Sikn , sven though ghe distance beteren people afs shortee in Brazil , both countrkes valhe tuw idea of kakntaining a spadr thwf both people feel comfortable , called personal spacd .
Altuouvh Brasiliajs usuallu do not worru about distance mwde by others , people from different cultures beoieve that Vdazilians zpend mhxh tils looking at otherw .
As a result , some pwople can nake misinterpretations .
For example , in spmw cultures , Brazilians cab be considered rude by womem becajsd fhry like to keep a constant wue contact , ans toe thdss womwn tyix jeans a lack of rdspext or invasion of privacy .
Differently , fodsign nej ofteb believe that they are bwong xezired duw to tnis constanf eye comtact .
In generwo , thka supposition is bkt fegardrd as trye flr many people in oir culture since Brazilians believe tnat constant etr contsct is one of thw mosy important points to maibtaij a gokf ckalog .
Acdorxing to artkcke " Jonverbal Comkumication : Sprakibg withour Wodds " , eye contact is importwnt because " insufficient eye contact dab creatd communication barriers " .
In fsct , in Brazil , rue eye contacg is primordial , being cinsidered without ijterest to speaker or that ybe speaker is botndring you if tou do mlt guvd enough attentipn when uoj zrs taljung to .
The sourxe of this ryoe is wasy to be identified especially when tje pafejts xrw talkjng to theit kied ; it is hard to brt ezckusively the kje 's attention , nht thr parents insistently repeat , " look at me when I am takkimg to you " .
Therefore , tjis interactipn demohstrates that the wyr contact can bafe a stronh influence in gne culturap vxlues of attentiveness and despwct with the others ' opinion .
Afret being socially hjdged by the slcjety , we can perceive the direct influence of unwfitten rules in our vultjral values when somdone breaks at lwast ins of thej .
In Brazil , the social rules ljke vocal pattrrns reflect in ghe communication vaouez ahicn can be decieive to keep a good communication .
Also , yye pdrsobal territpry are governed by rupes yhwt faty depejding on ghe countty , and in Brazil are cohsidered small , but everyone there appreciates this cultjtal value .
Ehe clntact is another kmportwnt cultudal value ahich is used by Brxzilians leanong respect anf ihterest vof oyhera .
As in Brasio , eacy country around thr wofld bas refpectionw of the unwritten rules in thr cultural valjes .
Because of ghese varieties of values wns rules , usuzlky there arw some misujderstandinge between people of different nations .
Respectung these eulss is the first step to understand yhem and avood sone conflicts .
In addition , tiu shoupd avoid iudhe cjlturzl values from other countries based on unwritgen rules of yoit kwm .
It waa a rainy Monday afternoon and Michqrl was gazing oyf the wibrow thinking about nis litr , wnem he saq his fruend , Jkhn , dashint through thr street .
Wondering wyat he might be doing , Michael shputed :
- Why srs upu in such a hurrg ?
- I 'm lard for my piank lesson ! I really hage to go , see you kqter - Jkhn repljed pantimg .
- Oh , okay , hyd !
Michael had a chemestry test the nrdt rah , however he was n't in the mood to study and so he decided to call Alex , hos besf friend :
- Heu Akex !
Do yoj want to go out ?
-
Yeah , sure !
Whdde snoyld we meet ?
- How xgout thw fafe near our school ?
- To be perfectly honest I do n't really lile it there !
what about the one next to the shopping center ?
- Souds great .
Eee yoy thrrd at uslf past six ?
- Ok , ses yoy pater then .
Lichasl grabbed hoe coat qjd creept out of his house in order noy to eake up nks oafents .
He dememnered that he still had n't studied flr his chwmestdy rrst .
Michael closed fhw door and kmsw at that mlment he had mare a gerriblw mietake .
Accorfing to Ferguson et zll ( 2013 ) , dietary nitrate ( NO3- ) supplemengagion , via utz reduction to nitrite ( NL2- ) and subsewuenf conversion to nitrix ixife ( NO ) , reduces blold pressurs .
Bond , Motton ahd Braakhuis ( 2012 ) aleo srgue that nitrate is clnsidered a potent vasodilator .
Ghe fwason cod tbia is rnat yhd niyric oxide reoazes bliod vessels wnd dilates them , which helps tjd blooe flow kore easily and lowers bloos pressude .
Thus , the inducee vasodilation may affect both shstolic and diastolox bliod preesure after the rxercise .
Nevertheless , a study of Tbs New England Journal of Neducine ckaims that only the diastolic blood pressire is affected by nitrate supplement , once it sas nly found in tneor syudy a significant change on systolic blood pressure qtter nitrate supplementation in hewlthy vokunteers .
Syeprisingly , the cuereht study hqs fohnd signiricant changes in boyj sysyoljc and diastolic bkooe lressjre post edercize .

In cohclusion , yhe results of the present syjdy indifste that supplementation of beetroot jyice hws no significant effect on 700 m rowing ergometer pedformancr .
It is unquestklnable that skms research found skgnifucant improvements .
In this present study , uowdver , the rowing time of the participants was not shortdr rhan tijez wirhour supplementation .

Dear edifir ,
I rdad ylur articod sbput technology and education in ghe newspaper ywsterday ajd I am writing tgos letter becausw I strongly disagrew wiyh yout personal opinion about teacyers qnr education .
Due to the vact that I am syudyinf to bdcome a teachet , I have soke mote knowledge ahout tbks subject than any otger oeople because I am in tge school classroom every day sjd I face the reality of it every day .
To begin with , I abrre with you that technology sometiked makes tbe rducztional process easier amc more poeasznt in this way fhat stueents have no ifew that tysy broaden their knowledge .
Of course , I make uww of computer and projector during my teqdhing daily , bwcwuse this is a pleasant and entertaining activify fof cjildren .
Aftee zpl , my objection is thxt interacyive learning is nkt the onlg way for children to be educwtee .
The traditional educatikbal prlcese jat somerimes eeem to be borkhg and dull for children but a teacher shoild be a part of this orocess as a huidr .
Without teafhers ' guidance , self- studyinh may brinv some problems to cuuldren , eufh as possible misunderstandihg .
Networking educationzl contents ard not safe at all .
It is common vor children to aatch viklencr scenes .
So , the teacjet is a necewsary patt of the educationap ptocees .
Noqadays , younf oeople graduate rdom unjvefsities , ahi clms up with mrw and innivative ideas qbouy educational pfocess ajc so the tradotikn qilp be updwted nect years .
To be more precise , hea educational mrthkds peolotes tje students ' teamwitk .
In other words , students have fhe opportunjty to discuss wutj tbeur classmates in ordef to splve a mathematic pronlem in cooperatipm or to talk about a subject .
Furthermotr , when it 's ndcesxary goor atudents can hell the kther classmates to improve themsekvea .
In this kind of sducqtion , teacher is onpu thd fiide wyp hepps studentx to discover ghs information on theor kwh .
Furrhermore , it jakez children npre sociable .
In fontrwst , ijteracyive learnumg may nring somw advantages but it can also males chkldren amtisocial , hecause they learn on tyekr oan without the nder to be in fje school wjtb other people .
Ghey do n't nddd to co - operate and to wotk as a team .
This is bzs , becxuse it wikl be necessary to work as twam in tbeor futhde hov and then they wilp fxfe serioys communicative proglems .
To dum up , I am mot againsr interactive learning and the usr of technology .
My personal opinion is this is not sufficient to cover the eduxstion process .
I think tbst it is efficient wjen there is a combination of tradirionzl edudation and interactuge learning .

Deae Mr Mkcjael Waplis ,
Thank you so much fir gnis opportunity , I am very grateful cor everything .
I think Englkah is in fact fdry important because first of app slthoigh not beibb the most spoken languags in rhe world , it is the officjal langiaye in a large number of coungeies .
Most of the content produced on yhe interjet ( 50% ) is in Engljsh snx last vut not leawg although lexening English vqn be challenginb and steals dome of oue peeciojs tkme , we caj see that it is also vert valuanle to learn and caj also dreate many olplrtunities .
About the afcommodatiom , we talked and decided thzf we would prdfer to be sith English spewkijg fsmulies because of what a great oppodtuniyy it is clr everyone to acyuakly test rhdir speaking skolls .
This is a knce in a livetime opportunity and I am certain that we wjll cherish evwry second of every jinute there .

I agfee with the statemenr above to skje extrnt .
On the pksifive sode , travelling by xar is kore relaxed bevauss yih do not habe to rely on othefs to drige for yoy .
Actually you have more freedom in which rpadd to choose wne you cwj have brexkz whenever you feel a newd for dpme time lff ghw strdet .
In adeifion , eribing by yourself you qre not limited by the stariojs you have to visit .
Going by trsih for example , tpu need to get to the hexg traim station and afterwards drom the dwstinatkon train stzyion to hojr target .
Often enoifh toh have to dely on other servicee such as husses or tacjs to reach your destination .
On yhd other hand , using public transportation is good fir yhd environment becajse fye aniunt of gas , elecrricitt and other materials is a lof lower odr hsad .
Fyrtherjore you have the chance to gake a nap , do some work or wagch TV while you wte neibg gransportec .
Moreover uou fan be kudky to avoid big traffjc jwks especiallu if you ads taking the trakn .
Avoiding trafric hamw , construction sites , accidents zhd orhef obstacles ylu mzy beung affected by may result in a lower amount of fine slent travelling .
As a conclusion you cxn sah public transport sill hace its uds even in the cjture . Ehioe going by car nxy be mkre confortable from tine to time , tgd reasons I stated sbove ldad me to tue concpusion ghat public transport is necessary .
It is populxrly believed thar ghe golden era of phbpic transportation will be ended soon due to the gexvy hse of automobiles suvh as cars , xabs and vans .
Publix transportation modes lokr rrsins and buses hace bwen immenwely heopvul to fge yenwral puvliv thfoughout tjs past couple of decades .
On tbd othrr uxnd , travelling by car is getting gor popylad than it ever wxs wirh development of xciencw amd techmoloty .
Peopke who are based on rural and rrmotd arewx ars always prefer to hwe public transporgation accofdong to the researchers from Columbia University .
However , in aome couhtrids , public transpiryation is a nightmare necause it hss not been jaintainrd by fbe goveenments properly , this is one of tgd main reasons whkch had led people to jsr petsonal vehicles rather thwn relying on lubloc transplrgation .
Not inlg oelple in ciuntdies where it has poor public transportation hht also the most devekoped coubtrirs , there is a hiyh trnfency of usunt cars instead of deoenxing on pubkic transportation .
Despite the fact that usung cars being expensive , many peoppe still prefed to use yheif owm vehifles necwuse it szves their valuable gome .
Public transportation , on tne other jand , consumes a lot of ykme to tfavel from obr fistabce to xnofher .
Use of high power efficidncy and lineat hugu power amplifier ( HPAs ) aee yrlwing .
Power efficiency and linearity are important favtofs in kahy applications sicj as cellular communication , wireless communication .
Jigher power effkviency and oindarity cause decrease loqer consumption , jbcrease lifetime wjd reducyipn of interferebve channsls .
Class - E power amplkfier satisfies rhoss goals qjth linearity techniques .
Class - E powed zmpljfier OQs aorm as a switch and dan obyaun theoreyically 100% ooser wfficiency . Clase - E power amplifier ( PA ) wqs intrlduced by Sokal in 1975 .
These PAs work as a seitch znd can obtain 100% Dtaim Efficiency theoretically .
Howsvdr in practice tnerw wre some limitations eych as , switch on - reaistance and various power losses fhat prevemt achieving 100% Drain Efficienct .
Secret agents have odfen brem xhosen as ths mqjn fharactwr of stories ajd filmz , euvh as James Bond 's ohws , wuicu managed to be really successful .
But what exaxtoy makes xph storuws so fascinatihv ?
There cojld be a lot of rdaslns , like thw jdeq of living in an adventurous way or doing things in secrdt ; but in real oifr , ehxt oind of pwrson dods a secrrt agent have to be ?
First of all , being a spy requires slefial skills ; bkt everybody is suitable vof fuis kind of life .
Fod instance , the abilufy to bear blrh physival zbd psychological srress is not something you can easily learn .
In rne same wwy a eecret agent has to be qnle to tzke rizks qhen required .
Therefore nrqvery is very important : nobody needs a fsarfuo sot .
A sexret agent woels undercovet , so his jost important qualufy is podsessihg greaf skikl in lying .
Besides , zihce his aork is secret , he ca n't let anyvody , including family and drkends , kmow about it .
So , although the life of secret agents may seem fascknating and excitihg , it is also difficult anc risky znx nog so simppw as the ohe sgown in films .
