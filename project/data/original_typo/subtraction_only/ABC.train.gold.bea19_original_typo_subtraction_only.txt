My tow is a mdium size city with eighty thousand inhatants .
It has a hig density population becuse its small errtory .
epite of it is an indusrial it , ther e many sops and department stores .
I recommend visitin e artiical ake in te certer of th city whih is surrounded by a park .
Pasteis are very ommon nd ms of th fer he speial desert om the city .
Thee are a omecial zne along he iest stret of the ciy wre you c fi all kind of establishments : bans , brs , chemsts , cinemas , pet ops , resturants , fat food restaurants , groceries , travel agencies , supermarkets and oers .
Mo of te shops ave ale ad offers at least hree months of the ya : January , June and Augt .
h quality of the products n servis are quite good , because there are a hug competition , however I suest you tain ca aout so fakes or chat .
Everyone has is own pns .
Peole want to be a doctor , her want to be a teacher .
I have my on plan too but I do n't sam to them , I an to become a Journalist .
Wrking as a Junalist is very excting becau many reasons .
First , I will have an oportnity to liv abrd .
eond , I can travel a around he orl , meet diffent people who re ery fiendly .
Next , I ll have a chance apper in ig parties or vens and I can make rieds wi famous person - It 's interstng !
Fially , I will have high salary when I am ournalis .
To be Journalst , I mus study ery had so I 'll ty to ler in ordr to make my dream come ue .
In te futr , I 'll become a journalist .
Now days each family has more then 1 ca or each one , thi is onl on of few reason th people use less pubic transport .
Before a really convnent to go by bus or by trin ut with e nw economy te ravl tickets ae more expensive and a i ifference fro the past is tat it is less expensiv to go far ten ne .
I remembe from my own Palermo in Iay to go to Mil was about 340 pounds , now if we are uky we can arrive to New York .
In gland where I iv , in Befor , we us a lo the rain to go in the st important tw of UK , but h tra a ey expensive , me and my family sy caful if we go off pick because the pric are to high .
I 'm re in te future the wil be car able to fl or you can park th in your pocket .
Futhermoe , e biggst grou of positive feling studns in he present is live it various nationlities .
T possible reason is these international students an not spa Eglish flowing .
he sully lack of language nd a not open a dbte .
It is restrict to aue .
In the other se , they might be waned to sfeguard national image .
In order to ge a good image d ow the national parenting , our respondents nd to have a reat pardon to the nationalities .

In the following eades revlution and civil mote many of the Poer of Europ , and new nations were orn .
Britain alone escaped almost unsathd fo these years of unrest .
There was an unparalleled expansio of th English - Seakin Pples both by birth nd emigrtion .
I really lke to tvel , but I ik the ost when I travel wit friend .
I a ve goo expeence .
I love to travel wh my family .
is different to tavel ith friends that ravel with faml .
I do not trve oo uh wh my friends .
I ju hve had traeld to times .
Those wo tme has been with the orchestra that I pla .
Once we wt to Zacatas .
We et there because the universty orchestra from UAZ ivited us to go there a play with them .
In that te I did not know nbod , just one .
H name is irixi .
She was my friend , because we are fro th same town .
But when I was ter I beg to make new fried ht I never thogth I w going to have , and I nvr thongth e way tha I was going to know them ethe . at he begining I felt ery range talig wth them , but n we are er good rinds .
We stayd in Zcatecas like a eek we rally ha a good ti .
The scond trip that I made was to Guerrero .
We nt to play to Acapulco , to an event that unuvesties from Mexio go d preent li cultur actiities .
Thre was o hot .
In Acaulc I had a goo time becas I stay in he same om that my frind and we swm a t d we relly ad f .
Then we went to Taxco .
Thee we visit the cenrl ar and we ta in a ver luxury hotel .
We were ery hppy thee we rally ke Taxo .
Actully I wa already ben ther before but not with my fiends .
Then we went to Ccauamilpa to play thr tht was an incedible expeience that I will never forget .
tn we rturn to Toluca to continue with my bori lfe .
And now I ave to pass my subjects .
We hope to go to Colomba next yr .
I like biathlon .
Relly , I thik it 's a very beautiful , interestig an breathtaking kn of sport .
In biathlon sportsmen need to run some races , which a vy differe , sme of that are long , some are hot .
ut , short distance doe n't an it 's will be easy or something like ha .
Soetimes weather conditions ar not comfortabe fo gs , o xmple : wind , light rg or freee , al of that are ve difficult conditions .
So , it 's no so easy like it seems .
That 's wh I like it .
This sport are o ea n .
And ao most of them are very attrctie , big avantage or gir , whose like nie icturs .
Tee is no fute for public transprt , because travelling by ar is so mch me convnien .
hat is wat everyone sa when we ask if ey prefr pubic ransport or car .
Using publc transpr can be o es , eause we he a strict me n normally we do not have a place to sit a that ca be exremely desconortble .
Soetimes th employrs do strike and we clients do t known in te as a result we can t g on tie to work , ta is one of the disadvantages of using public ransort .
ne argmnt r t uing the car is that the petrol prc is very expensive , t he public transport tices ae alo ncreasing , so that dvantange re not so good actually .
Fr me car is th best a ou ?
Wel however your choice is , it is necesry to be perfect for your dil li !

People usually tell me I 'm a cnma 's enthsiast , and ey are in the correct ay . I preer to spend my fre time watching a god film especial when it is a thriller than doing sprt ,
If u want to e a ood thriller , " Regression " will be your best option . I ave en it recently d in my opinion , it hould be ee by everyone becau I beive people would le it fo many rasos .
Frt of l , he director , ho a Alejandro Amen√°bar , did a great jb due to that , the spectators wer waitin ih bated breath as th final of ti fm wil be .
Secodly , t acors were fatastic and the mn hracter , ich was performed by Ema Wtson ( o is rally hilarious ) , as amazing .
What 's more , the pot is easy in orer to undrtand .
e history tok place in h USA a few year ago when t regrsion metod a accpted by the doctors ad cientifics .
reover , utoms , ke - up and special effects beame ever re in reality th sory .
However , the soundtrack was awful , it i n't ge hving a scard .
In conclusion , my recommenation f the sudent film club is this fabulous and citing thiller mut be sn if u had spent a good tme given han it acheves keeping in suspens uil he end nd it does n't be arai .
In addiion , you wo n't have bette opportniy to see it than tis week , because ust momen in Spain the festival 's cinema is hppenng .
Yu should ake advanae of tat !
In my opinion , ubic ranport in my country will never improve because my coutry is so po and eside it is consdered one of third world countries ad anoher think ust be taken into consideration is they th politicians ae hrrile th hv destroyed my country
When we ask ourselves , how can we take care of t environment ?
e first thing that we think is te pollution , the a smoke , factoy smoe , etc ... but , ve we thoght in e oo or clths ?
perhaps wh we are buying in h suermarket or othe hos we are ong something ad , because we ask to asistant a bag o iilar to carry at hme this od or other thigs .
We can tae a bag frm our hou , because if we do this very ime that we e going to y in ech sho , we do n't spend mor pie of plastic or paper .
But we do n't ave forgoen the cotamination by cs , We cn ue more the bicle or public trnsporetion .
Aso in e srt ay , we should go walking to he destinatio.ice
If we are woring with sameone in the same ob , and o lives near or he is ur neghbour , we n go to the ork in th me ca , thi way we use es ol .
The govenents ae also important for taking care of he envionmen .
he shold he helth habits and wih their exmples th cn improve the habit of the populaton .
I ov sports bt I i t get much opportunities to la a sport . I born in a villge in Indi , my paents e farmers le most of otr village .

As r th toa topic " No Fture or public tranort " , I wld ke to ad cments on that please be patient my English is t too good as you reaers thi .
So , et tat ,
os of the Metro cities are w days atract people of cty toards Metro oy nt js eause of the fare t because of h tme tht it sves .
Now these as public would not like to tael in he ublc Transpor to sae tir tm as well as ney .
etro is goo f evn heal of the peope as no polutin and al because it uns on electricity and also it connect mos of he cit as Delhi has a ide ae spn of Meto that is really awesome .
Other tan that pubi transport is al no go for Naurl resources which is not good for the uture of the coutry .
If you visit Tain , you will ever mis the temples here .
There are so any tmples here .
So , no there is a chance f you to retend h god .
i - Tian Folk Arts rop is a grp of pople who are good at ou trditional performance , which is " imitate e faces a pose as ods " .
In here , tey will tch yo how to draw the face of o , dance lke god , and beat he dum .
Curious ?
ut come a give it a t !
I thk p expensive tax on ersonl r can redu the use of cars or other vehicle in order solve h traffic problems .
Because all people like money , for exaple , many people do n't buy ar with expensv t , so pole ms use h public transporation , suc as bs , subway .
Te public trasportation wl rich , so tey can bld more station for suurba and mre pubic car to carry ts .
Therefore trafic will be batter .

Nowaays a person 's wrth seems to be judge ccordig to the social staus n material possessions , that is mostly to happen in gh class miies , as they are foccus on achievements as wer , politica influences etc . on the other hand for a middle clas families the old - fahioned vale are stil important as it is h inheritance frm our ancestors in terms of vaues as hoesty , kindness , loyalty , etc .

In this esa I woud like to hglight how a wide range of public transpot a help peopl to save a bit of moey an a lot of tressful hrs sck in the traffic a .
Firstly as everybdy kw the cot of the fuel is increasing mr and more , ading to hose te ill that own a ca will bring , it became immediately clear tht it is heaper go around by public transport .
Wy then thre sill be so may peple who efer to rie hei own cr intead of sat comfortably on the tain or on he tue readin tei favort bk on their wa to rk ?
I would say that this is because t public transport are not so effcient as the should do .
In my town for eample , I have been Waiting for up to for mnutes before I oul take a bs .
I strongly elieve ht it is a shame becaus a lot of pople lke me oul live thir ehicle at ome d ta a tai istead .
Secondly , te environment oud improve is state need , as far as I can se the pollution ased by the rafic is uiing onumens and mkin t air dty n heay , e sm is as far as waste of ie is concerned , obviosy the fewer as a around h icker you can get were you wn .
In oncusion I wuld really like that politician who ar about pulic transport ill improve the services so ta moe eope cld leave eir vehicles at home a mve roud much more esiy .
he problm is that if eeryone hins hat traeling by car is convient , absolutely eveyne wll go everyhere by car , nd the roads wil bome chockablok .
You see an , I do n't ke crowdd roas , a nd prere to travl by tram .
It is cheap and eloquence .
I play baskeball on weekends sice I am ltle .
I lso like to play basebal , to .
I a pla basketball and baseball like no tomorrow .
I usually play baseball with a gru of my friends .
I ay with th on the playground .
I ca n't mag the life witot sports .
In he day societ .
The most people e travelin by hei car , because the ublic transport w ot convenient f people to use .
Maye , in fac e lnds re more g , so that the ansport had t published to anywhere .
e general tnsport constrctions can ivide thre levels .
On the lands , h railroad n higway is e go through the most iy rads .
In th se , inclde the rut and port onstruction .
In the sy , incude airplae fligt and airport constuction .
The trnsort onstruction and econoic development has a close elationsip , n tlized of lnd a more important .
The development of the railroad and hiway ar easy to pulished , bt construc of sepot and airpot must with congenital conition .
Whe integrate of the econmy and lan planig are acoplished , t public transport onstrutions are convenient for pple to use .
I am gin to rite about how iv is oing to cange in te next 50 yer .
Although we do n't realised we have to be conscious
that every d is a iffrent d if we cmpare with the one has passe .
Some years ao we did n't use th tehnology to et in touch with friends ad famly u nadays it 's h mos importnt hin f
soe eope o they ca n't lve without it .
I am speaking abou te mobile o it changed u life .
It 's orma
th in th ex 50 yer it is going to chge .
It wl be more advantages in enera and it il iv us a t of good thngs ut maybe some bd thins oo .
To sum up , although we do n't want that our life changed it is norl ha it will have different change .
It is necessary for ur livs to have or to feel that we are getting better .
My faourte sor is chess beaue it is the only gam for ur mind .
It als heps us in studies .
I agree tt it 's not physical xercise bt a mental oe .
There are many physical exercises like wimming u name y gam excpt cess that makes u mind sharp .
I ik may her games u the best on is this .
I am ot saying that we houl always play chss as hysica activities are also imortant .
h reao why I would advise oeone ti sport is th the hildrn wo are ot interested in there studies or uld o be able to stuy .
In at case ces ould help im .It would mk child mnd sharp and he wold n get disrct by t surroundings .
Locl transportation is n of t ost problem in our area .
he lol transportation become dificult d epensive .
so h government must tae an actn to mk it easy .
Public mdia so must educate people the mportance of Loca transation n how they preerve it .
The Government must save te gaolin and az to resolve the problem .
they mus find a solution to this difficut problem .
Ty must maitain roads .
People aso hae an important roe to solve this problem .
Th should reserve h energy by using bus inste of using their own cars .
Tey also an wa or rie a cycle .
Goerment ust maintin the pbic transportation nd mak it safe .
We can slve this problem if we ant that .
I have hought th writg an articl on my avourie por would be inteesting for t eaers , above al , and mkin no differences on the sport yo have chosen , it is paramout practising sm sport , whatever you chse , sch as spnnng , that is my avorite sprt .
My pece of adice to take up a hobby , in is cae a hysical oby , wch is interesting o your ealth .
I rther enjoy spnning , felig the rhytm of the music lwdr an lowder , this ves me high nergy each ie I wen spning .
If you ant to start pactising some sport , first of all tink aut ow mch time you r illing to spen on it , then try once and if o ar havng a good time go ahe and do th ost of our time enjoying sport , nevertheless , be carefu a go sowly becaue ou mih be injured .
h more sport yo practise h bete u feel , inded , your mood wld t be blue anymo and your body will be thin and gorgeous .
First of all , my opinion is ht there is a future o t public ransort systems .
If we take a look on th Swiss ubli trnspor system , in h bigge iies aost all peope go to wk by public tanport .
The dvantae they t is he following : hey dont't hav to look for parking possibilties , the cn lave e bus or the rain n a ew miute afer thy can gin to wrk .
These people also hp to protec th enironmet by aing our natual resources like petrol .
To conclure , in bigger cities like er or Zurich hre ae no douts that the public transrt ystm would be less convenient tn ravellig by car .
The process hw to make te not o th ban c be outlne in i consecutive steps .
First , h bank notes shul be consirated how to design include bakgrond color , artwork d scurit issues .
The , ty re supposed to pepare a skiled acinists .
Subsequently , the shets of ban notes are printd on the metal pltes .
The notes have pecil link with coor on both sie , whic raised maes slightly .
The most mportant tep is inpet the notes whih ar good quality sheets and whih are bad shet .
If the shee e oo , those seet are then u to separately and acked into cars in order to dispata all vr th ci .
If the shets e bad , those shets r then destroed through bunig .
Sport is very impotnt ar of a healthy lifestyle .
It keep our bdy strong .
Today we have a l of different sports , so we can choose somethig that really it ourselves .
I enjoy running .
It is a kin of thing that eveybdy ca do and it effects all art of my ody .
I literally fe mysf stoger ate every ime I run .
There is no oubt that trafi ad to pollution .
e public trasport ofer a possible slution for t prblem , becuse much peope can transrted in ne ehile .
The governmn as a esponsibility to encourge h public to use bus a e underground mor .
However , there ar a number of chanes tt need to be conidere .
Fistl , public traport shol be made free .
e gvernment hould raise txes fo y for te service .
Car are genraly me expeniv .
First , I think the public transport is moe expensive .
And if we cpare te money yo spend wh the c and te aount at you pend with the public traspor , it is ss .
Secodly , if yo use te ar , y haven't wait much time ti ath he bus or h train , ad mybe you n arrive later at our jo , r this situaton .
I believe that use your cr has a lot of advantages or beneits , it is more comfartable n ls expensive .
la sumer i word at cinema.i tik it is a vey go job ecause you can see any films you like f free .
The minus of is wr is ver g salary and i think tat i wl wr at tis cinema on th ext ummr .
My favourit sport is doing ya .

In contras do a sport is vy imortant because we can make new friends or we can start to take responsibility t the most iportnt tig is that we r alwy active e our body can get good reslts .
To sum up , do sports is very impotat for teenaers to whih h bod is going to grow and do it regulry is omitment tht we should ae . in my opinion , hoever , do a sport mandatory is ot educational because we ust do a spr wh enthusiasm n othered or for obligation

We did n't hae a lot of mney bu I went to a private elementary cool .
Tere we a lot of rih pople , maybe we were about ten to one hunre nt living in a house .
I d a lt of friends , too mu freds ..
At sixth grade , I realizd at they id n't relly lov me , or evn like me .
I remember wo contrats oents : One ay we had to create a team to make an exercie whic sed brain , they hose me .
ltough , another tm , we had to reae a tam o dog sort , a they i n't choose me .
Tha et to the secnd problem I had , an stay n : my weight .
They dd n't hoos me bcase of my wght .
I was too fat , too mh fat .. I looked at my health boolet on mnt ago , ad I saw that I have bee ovrweght since I 'm four years old .
nti sixth grad , I hough I was " normal " , bt then all chnged ..
Learning Elish is very important by the futue of l .
Is a lagage that mny peope speak and know .
any people start learning Eglih at scoo .
Late , h pple continu in language schols .
Is a diffiult language , so , e best ptin is to go broad .
In an Englih speaking untry , everyday ou lar to live .
Pope speain different but it a basic lvl understand Enlish .
It is difficult to go to a place unknown wih diffret eple but is a good experience to lan .
I thnk if te woe wrd has oy n language uld be betr .
Eveyone could speak and understand .
Not so , erefore , we must study vr English .
Because of e suggestions , I learned ow to ntrol my temper while I was facng wit faures and kp telling myself tat wa n't a big shame becuse I had h ried my best .
Thu , I became more mature eause I overcame the ard times .
I like walking in he morning eery day n I enjoy ding it with my wn or with my rieds , and ecause it 's very usul fr my hlth nd also it keep my body hethy and full of enegy .
soetmes I feel ired of walkng especially in e unny days with a high temperatures , but ta ca n't e me stop ing this sport .
when I 'm walkg , ta a refresh me ll the time ad kes me feeling good .
I want to give dvic to eopl who lve thing pe of prt ; please do o et it go , and do it as you cn , cause it 's a beneit sport .

I am writing to complain aut te ae - unch menu .
In my opinion th main curse needs a ack of improvement .
Firstly , I am a vegetaria and I do n't av mch choice of vegetables .
Secondly there e o much variety of dessrt mail fruis and pudings .
Ther is not much variety of healhy drinks , there not much hot driks as we .
Sme people sa that in my colee re vegtaria , Muslim , vegn e.c.t a they do nt have much vaiety of od to choose ke halal meat d veg and nothing tha coes from animals .
It is considered that ou chge the ye of fo regularly .
Redue the fast fo tha make eple obe n nt healthy .
It il be better if you gave driks comared to h eathr like whenever its wine we woud le a ho drink an if it is sume we old lk a chilled drin .
I hope o cosder this major problem in the af .

Yours faithfully
Der M Ashby ,
I 'm writing to yu regarding of a letter I 've see on my way om calling for candidates to fill a vacancy in yor cafe staff .
As requsted , I 'm an English - speking guy and currently looking or a job tha does n't disrupt my studies at colle .
Fr that reason , this job is perfectly sitable or me a , besids , it showed up as a good opportunity or me to impove my incoming helping me ayin my bills .
Now I am twenty fier ears ol and whn I s teenae I live abroad twice .
Th first ie in odon , o 6 months , and ms recently in Berlin , for 8 months .
e movie I 'm oig to be reieing is " the urge "
I actaly oved it qite a lot , I just loved all t suspens and t parts they leave ou hnging , it 's jst way oo interesting , the movie is about e amerian governmt who nnuall ives 12 hours where ll crime , even murd , is lga , n there are no medic services during tha lng eriod of wat they call " th purge " an anyo can join it , yu c kil whever y want .
h thing is , some people do n't think it 's ok , a they do n't agr , so thy just st inide and y to suive he night .
The diagrams illustrates e process about producing bank ots .
At the first beginning , bank notes should be well - designed considering the colour atching and rtwork including th isses about afty .
After deining , metal plates a supposed to be prepared with h help of experienced achinists .
Then , it comes to the priing ste .
Ensuring there is clour on both sdes , image is incresed gely by a certin type of i .
Most mportanly , before distribuion , rnted sees wih 50 bank notes pr sheet he to be cecked whether thy are of perfect quaiy or no .
They can ly be paed ad distibuted en they are wh good quaity .
In other wrds , both bd sheets and the ones whch r seperated bdl need destroying in a saf way hich n st them frm goig into te market .
That 's how bank notes ar produced from paper to he n we an purchase gos in u aiy life .
Many peopl lieve tha nowdys hre is no fuure in pubc trnspor , because travelling by car is so mu more onvnient , ut others cotinue with the tought th hey do elp for example r travelling fr long distane .
I lieve ot are useul .
Firstly , there is plenty of peope who ca nt by a car n so th ony optin hey hae is to tral by thes transports .
The ticket does nt cost to mutch nd it is avaible o e majority of th peple at least comparing to buying a a .
Seondly , publc transports re more eficent to travel for ng distance han cars and people would nt have to purchase combusibl .
When people r availe to tavel to other cotinets or fa aay , they my nee a plane , icth is a public transpt , to complete he journey becue the have tu cross oceans nd clomplicated distances that ae different landfors .
Hoever , a a is soething witch is from he peron d he c do athevr he wants an nd it in th same y he or he left it , a someies public sprts are nt lt in the best ay .
In addion , yu have to hae with people ou absolutely do nt know and probably wo nt e again .
Consequesntly yo cn be stole or t sic .
But , by obsevin all hese peope u an rich yoself ith different cultures ad manners the the he ad incporate new topics .
To cnlude we can esablis a midle point .
Publi sports are useul u sometimes inconvenent bt mre ceaer . u can gt to know n people and different cultures .
When I wa 12 , I went in Franc f h first te in my ife .
That was my fst time on hliday in another cntry tat wa n't nourth Italy .
I remember i wk up at 6 o'clock for to e train ad went to Paris in France .
Ate 4 hours sat on an ncomfortable sa , we rrived at the train staon a then my prents and me en to the htl .
We fisited a lot of monumnts , museums a huces , ie e Louvre wth the Monaisa by Leonardo Da Vini .
That wek I fet happy d relaxe but I was a lite i a whn we returned in Itay .
I am wating only to go tere anotr time !
Nowadays my people hv thi own transport , for example ty ae cs .
Transport is the best situation for ople to can travel aoud a country .
Withut transport people a no go bak to ork a do something else .
ih blic trnsport , is te best way to go to work . Becse it is eas to travel .
No need to py a full amount becaue they av any eople who entered the bus .
Pubc transport heled us to know our country and improve our body to move e ace to another .
For exampl , we should walk to go in a place wheeas a c can pak in the plc whi we at to go .
It heps us in ny dfficlt ways , if ey have a problem we can take a bus an go there .
It will be ore appropiate fr us .
All illag he hv a bs - sp wher the b op to ak or lee asengers .
nd ome u driv at niht to take passengers .
Wihout it many peop ill have mny dffiult to go somewhere or to retn hoe .
However , they hve some disadvantages wi a public trnsport , ey gave my traffic j , ths is becue the bus a large and dificul to cotrol .
If the roads a small , he b ould go in t stree .
h us wold not eve he passengers where they want to go , because thy hae to leave the in e b - stop .
Dy by d e country develop more and ore , owadays thy ve train .
Many eople travel by train ecase they arrve moe faster thn the bus d cheaper in a long run .
e publc trasprt will have any future because some peole av no money to uy their w car .
Pubic transport hav hel us in many dfferen ways .
It will better if th have public ranspor .
ear Ka !
Do your amly is hpy tht you come back ?

Nowadys sing public transport is conidered to be the mst convenient
a to mve around .
It prvides citzen the fredom to relax and disconnect while gin ome or to work .
Howevr , taking you own car is th much more useful .
And o ts reason I hoesly thi it will be th only means of transport in t ture .
You also asked about t leisure activities in Span .
Well , e me tl ht there are ots of ways to have a good time there .
Fo me , the most iterestig n is sihseeing around he city n dicoer its monumts an landmarks .
However , thee ar also an endles of leisure activitis such as going hopping or ging to usums , to cnemas or to beautiful parks
If it were not enough , o il be able to enoy h mazing mosphere of o nightlife , goig to restaurants , to ubs or loge ba .
In my tow pple ae very educated d very awre of the environment , th ow vey well that if we take cre of the enviromnt then it wll usefu for us ol , so they always tk care abo t rubbishes and ry to cln the village .

D. Pehaps , bilingual cool creation migt be a god id of Colbian eduation improvement , t it will be appropriate to be awae that Combia actuall ha public chols with a bsi eduation wre Englih is considered as another aademi ubect , in cotrast wit the privte ones .
Because a ajrity of do n't hav enough resourcs to pay for it .
Th who picture conys us the prces of making bank notes .
It epend five main sps whih inlud desh , reparaton of mtal plaes , prining , inspecton , packaging and dstraction or disosal epens on whether h fouh sep is good or bd .
Above ll , the sign is the ost previous y we shou nw , wich is onsiderd wth the background color and artwork .
Secondly , we need preparation of metal plates that ubsidarize wh silld machinsts .
And the we nd printing and inspection .
Eventually , the mst essential ar com t , we ee sinificate the quaiy of th sheets .
If it 's good , packing and distributin whereas the others soulde be distroyed as well .
In conclusin , te wole ar of proes is an unreversed schedule .
It cosumemed t powe wich contind h humanity and machinic .
evrtheless , in my opiio the most preciou of the revolution is the modern ecrity measure through such a mu - eveloped society .
To bei ith is eign , we re able to coniderate bacgroud clou , artwork , and security issus , ad then , we r supposed to eparing ental plates , uch as killd n machiists .
Secondly , printing -- including sheetsof bank notes , printed(50 an nts p she).There are some rquestion -- colour on bot sides , secia k , mages ligtly raised .
T most mportant step is insction that t printed sheet hold manually inspece .
If partially daagd shet ext , the bk notes should eparted ino good and a .
In the nd , if it is a gd sheet , the pocedue is ackging and disribuion , including cuttig into separate bank otes , packing , dispatching .
If it is a bad sheet , e porcedure is disposal --ba sheetsand bank notes shoul be securely destroyed .

Nowadays , peole ae getting oe independent , and more tha this prble , socety now nee to shw te ther this independnce and cnrol of their own lives , which includes cars , oues n materials .
On t n had , travelling by car can be an excellent wy to mov ourself or where yu ant to go , wthout going on fot to fid you bs station and bomes lss important if you liv in e centre of ou town or in the sububs .
Another advatage of travelin by car is tht y do n't have to spend time waiting fo yu other transpr , as so as you can avoi the cnfsion of pepe ha e in th subway sations every morning to et in th ine you want to arrive at work in time .
On he other and , public trasport are he ly resourc som eople ha to move on , and more ha xcellent to t enviroent , it 's also a od wa to avoid traffic d spend mone on petrol , onc it 's cheaper if you ctch a us .
Anoter disadvantage is ha usng he car can be useless in some stution , lke if you go to a football game by car , yo probably wo n't have a pace to par it .
In conclusion , ars wo n't let ublic transports be forgot , once more ta providing the only a some eole hav to trave , crs ae n't so convenient f some situations .
I think you must go to a large chol in the ton because here you can hve more friends d you an do a o of other thng that you n do in the countryside .
I rall wnt to go to a big sool in t ow because here in the countrysde I can go out wh my fends or go shopping wih them .
I the town yo can do everything un .
You n go to the spping , to h halfpipes , to th sateparks and you can do a o of other oo higs wt your riends but in the contryide no .
ut you mus go to the school that u want , his is jut my advice ok ?
I raly want tha you be happy ih your ne life .

I thin that he famy and rends e the ost important in our liv beause if yo ae some problems they a always her n hy ry to hlp y .
Tse people can influenc in ou life f eample , if y hve a bd friends o become a b peson and you wil have probles in your le.so , your education depends on th people aoun yu .
It is nt imortan if thee people e frinds or faml , they can change our lives for better or worst , depend on you choose the st thin th it cn help yo .
As we kno , in ou da everythn is possible .
We have so man advantages tt make or les esie .
en e way of studying a chaged .
In eneral , peol have th possobility to study in libraries or usng the computers .
Stdying in libraries aks a lot of quiet and patience .
here o us n't spek lauer a o aways have to wait for your trn to orrow something or ou have to wait if another student s he ook u need .
Personally , I tik studying on a cmpute it 's a btter chooise .
I 'm not sayig ha us because of the as way by you c udy what you wan .
Studying uing a omputer ofer you the possibility to be more rlaed when you do it .
In this wy , yu a mayb read aloud .
If I were a student that usually stuie in a libary I wod defitely try to stuy on a omputer .
In this wy I wld n't waste a ot of tim .
If someoy sys tat there is no future fo publc tansport i mind immediately . today ther a to may vehicles in or treets .
the roads a chock a block.eerybody as a priva car .

Accorin to he reality a lot of young eple are n't vy communcated in their ife .
Ty think their life is so borig and als very mad .
t I thin different .
For exaple in your childhood o are much more happiest than yur Parents because their job is not ver ay .
hey have to lo after thir childre a it 's ver stressed I think .
Mot teenagers ca n't uderstand that , ad they think that the job of their paents is o difficult .
Firstly , oug people usally calm do trough h music for example cassic muic .
But most of young society are not interested this te of mui .
for istanc they prefer o or ls rok music .
Through you listen the musc you an expressed yor emions ad hs is he most beauifu thing .
Secondly , tey like atchng series in a TV .
ha ma ther happy and additionally make loud .
Usually the wath criminal series beaus it 's vey intesting and raly mstrious .
Teeagers have different styes .
A lot of young mans lv weang jeans and t - sir .
Because it 's vr comfortable .
Bu girl lv werng skirt an nug shirt .
I thnk he style is ery impotat in our li .
Acros styl we n eress u emotions an feelings .
In conclusion life of yung people is not vry esy .
We have a o of unhappy day ad we av a lot of prblems too .
hi my ne is Adrin i am 17 ears o and i am footballer . I w born too be a footballer .
We we playing everyda footal in h school an I a the best .
I w ven better th te older chilren everyone ws tellin me too go to a team .
t i didnt had t do anythig , a team to whn i wa 11 years od .
h name of the tea wa Katsa .
i was at hi am fo 5 years and h made me ven better in football .
I layed my firt atc at 16 yrs old ad i felled er peial becase i w 16 and i was capal of putting 3 goa .
I playd so good tha eeryone gave me congratulations bu that s not ll oe of the est team of the world waned too take me .
I was very hpy and of course i agreed .
o my opnion , I 'm definitly gree with th .
Alrady , for ol 20 ears a t of thing beause of the technology .
And I thik hat iy 's ot a technology will chang but e people d their caracteres themseves .
Unfortunaly , for this generation thee wo n't be a real relationship , l relation will bcoe a vrtual relatonshi .
Th go ew is te aerage of people w cn ak advantag of t technology ca econome a ot of time because they might ve a sophisicate robot ca hep at home .
Acrding my experience , if we do n't eagerate h wa we use technologie lik internet , phone , satellite .
It wil be he good thin tt we cn spnd ou time r a goo thing
In ome people 's lives the ms important is to wear fashionable clothes .
On the one hand , I ink it is important tolook good , but sometimes e late fasion is not the best choiceto feel ppy and comfortable .
o eamle , n t hih - held shoes is ve trendy but it coss a ot an the most oman oes n't oo god in it .
On te other hand , h personality is more imprtant and determinative than an epesive rss , it is a fac .
Butif somebody ats to follo the lats fashion , I accept it , ecaue she just in hse clothes eel gd .
In cnclusion , my opinion is that the prsonalty is more iportant tan te clohes we ear , bu everybody hs s o life and a choice to decide what sh wants .
Transportation is o of the most essential prt of our d to a lie ; whther it is pplc or pivat , ransport takes the sme priority in each one 's life from te vy arly days .
Basically , we 've lan , ater and air tranpot r reliab pupose .
In the age bfoe e industrialisation cam in to exsiance , people wer also sing various alernaives to tavl from o place to aother .
The otly epnd on animal to me ar to ride on them .
Ten the technoogy improved gradually toards mechanica engines to make e transport more convinient .
The deveoped version of a those engines are use in the runig vehicles of land , wat a r hich ae our life more faster .
u in hs morn ea of globalisation , lobal warming is one of te prime concern of t rth .
And when we look at he modern technologies of tasportation , it glances no fuure f public ranport .
It is ineiably ue tt , excesive use of public transprt lads to higher leel of pollution .
So , it would better to go for ny thr alterntve of ree technoloy for futre purpose to make this worl a bter place .
Yesterday , I had a wondrful dy .In the mning I en to a Gaiian basktball trainin with a coach of Spanish election , hen finished went to my parets to a hotel to at d tay with some friends , ter the food ee with friend 's of my parents ad went to a theme park and we rode to a rolers coastr , it as very ecitig and we te a chocate c cream , it w delicious .At niht we we to a atch of Spansh basketball league , Obrdoio vesus Real Madrid and tat mac won e ta of Real Madrid and he I nt home to slep .
Ts is my wonerfl day .
when I find me in London , I 'm oin to h buckingham palace lcated in te ciy of westminster and I 'll see our at gallery and touist attracio of e British monarchy
contnue in Loon , I wil visit to the larges parks in London , he hyde park that hang a full day of guided oudoor games and activities o perservation thereof park
follow in London I 'll go for a wk to arrve at h g ben that is e mst beautiful bulldng in al its slendour whe I will tae pictures

when I 'll leave of the undergrond in he station wmley park I going to the wembley tadiu where I will njoy an evenng of football , the atc started at 8:00pm
My favorite nd is " cbjr " , it a brazillan nd , the tpe of music is rc n rap , yurs music a very easy to sige .
I really ke , in te moments when I am listernning turn up the radio , b he singes e ied .
Generally speaking , it a ben suggested that ied - sex educatio will improve to he degre of learning systm at schools .
In anoher way of sayig , ths kind of education syte shuld be inclue in the hole asses in all schools .
Howevr , I strongly bliee th the measuremet of education eve es not explicitly inerest wi se differencs in the classes , but also it is related to the quality of ecation lvl in h schools .
Eductin s a cucial part in one society an it 's ftue and by mprovin he leve of educatins syste , students a ear more effectively in thr ntre education lfe an their creer bt also their skills il be improved by this procs .
Nowaays , unfortuntely , students can not take eough educati from their schols whereas in some poor countries .
Their sstes a no lonr that god enoug and stuents will not make a good ceer for their uture .
On the ther hnd , by buiding oe effective learning system hich il provided by local authority , studens will ncouraged them ler mo efficient .
La of teaching way , po audience of h css , uantty of lering materials , for instance , l of thse matters ould be enhanced until he good qualit ha ben set up in the sytm .
Besies , by putting these kid of procdues , students will also in more espect towards career and their job .
Hopefully , he will reach not only arn ore money in their entie life but als society will have more development sape in any other developed counties .
It is true tht coeduction an otie e suent while they wo wth other e gup students , we ought to aso bear in mind , this is not only sotion to get best reul .
Therefoe , we shoul conside ther kinds of problems which afft on education system .
In a nutsell , based on th ove - mentioned pnt suc as , quality of educations system ot ony interests with ix - education b also it wil ed some good solutions in some subjects that menined .
It is personall cocluded at this kinds of developments wil be put int the acion for l schools shotly .

ur world is very polluted by public transport so we thi aout what will happen in te utue .Public tanspor cases many poblem in u environmet ch as , difficult reacin to the neest destnation , the polution , an causing disease .
We must think altrnative solutins for this prolem .
We face dificuly in reaching in our wn destinaion .
Many people ho go to her work ate .
Hence , if everyon s a prvate car he n go to is ork on ie .
Using he pblc transprt makes us rive le becaus it tops many ties .
With our prvate ar , we can do any tas in our ay , but using uss we waste our time , and mre efforts .
ses ru ith petrol tat cuses pollution .
Nowadays , there e some vehicle rn with electricit.we c derease polluin by usg electricity .
Hence this will help popl to be in a good helth .
In addiion , crwded buses cause affecion among people .
private cars reduce the afectio .
Crowdd uses sread epdeic in our sociy .
Finaly , we hope a healthy futre o ur e generatin . We want to rach our detination on time and liv in sfe lfe wthout diseases an poution .
my favorite sport is volleyball.i lay it sinc 00.my bt positin is numr 2.i used to lay it in acult of engneerig selecio.it mes me it ad lo .
i ike it very mu .
i ued to play it wih my frindes .
when i entr the egyptian med rces , i payed f the air efense forces tam .
we won the 1st position , and got the cup of competition.if anyoe atens to la ths game , he should practic hard to be able to play it proffesoaly .
Further to the tde ai of te las wek wre we were a pleasure to meet you nd we wee tling about yu crses .
I am looking f an organizational develment crse .
Could I ave contact wh any of yu customer f more information ?
I am ailable to tl with you on Moday in the morning .
I am loing forar confirmation .
My favorte sport :
en I as a child , abou fur or fi year old , my father teaches me what was footbl , and I loved it b , I really liked the goalkeepers , wy I like football since childhood .
I think football shows o a o of eelins and xeriences .
I noy ootbll because it is a form to forget prolem d noy a bit , ecause when you re playing football , you are n't thinking other stuff , you on ae concntate at the game .
Football is a sport whe anytng c hapn , no alwys win the et tes and is unpredictable , there is n't a drm ta .
e ootball is a good form to do exerse becaue it is interesting ad unny .
And if you do n't lik do sport o can wtch h matce of the teams around the world .
Th ms iportat invenio is the mobie , because u ca do whtever ou nt in only one comunication evce .
Today , it 's smaller , faster and ceapr an before .
Not ol cildren have n , grandparents hav either .
B ith ti gdget , we have a ig problm : people are bcming isolte , we r ivin in our ow world .
o can do a lot of things using your oble , ke : cll soeone , ext , take cs , listen to music , ach movi , play gmes , wake u up ( larm clock ) , access te iternet , cck your e - mils , pay yur bills , acces the social medi , earn ho to ck ... the r mny more unthinkable things we cn do .
t now , childrn wan to have oe as soon as posibl , they do n't play hde and ee and play spots lie efore .
And one onsequece of this is thy have health problems .
Another prblem is if our mobile is stolen , he thie n acss al your personal li , he can check yr e - mil , see your phos , e .
n people are getin islated , ne I saw a mother usn yor mobile instead of akig care of r baby !
This is so a !
In th fuure , it il pobaly we can alms evryhing using mobie , but we might pay attention in o tis affects our life .
The pie charts illustrate the amount of household earings alloation within regular families in o different yar ( 00 nd 200 )

Actually , the pulic transport show really no fuure .
Te governments dd n't had en givin good ide to imrve h publ transpor .
There e two god reasns f doing not e plic transport in t future .
Frsly , th no continue th construtin of mre ra lin of train to publ transport is a one reason .
Secondy , people do n't like the old buss in h city cenr .
Consequently , peope pfer mo in your n c .
On th other hn , I think tere are wo aspects that ca chane the actual situation .
h fist is , The govrnmet cn create a e pla os costuction of tains .
The second aspect is , people an ep to pay more ax to buy new buses .
As a result , we can have a public transport re comfotabl .
In my opinion , the pubc trnsport can ha future if al we colaborate us to improve .
nles we do so , I believe no future r e publc trnspot .
There r widely differing views on e isu of whether or t th benefits of study foreign langue in arlir ge outweig the drawbacks .
Some people ould suggest that learng nw language bere second scho discourage their uul laring and that would strugle ther nderstanding of ote subjects .
However , I personally beive hat te dvantages is oerwight .
The reasons fo this as follows .
Len ow to walk befoe learn how to run , the opponents cntend h chilrn conse e words a phraes ith the mother tngue .
Confronting with challenges , primary students are struggled on the difference etwen firs language n the learning oe .
Thus , people view that chilen learn foreign language at primary school are worse than later .
Nonethess , I would contd that lerning foreign at primary schol brings countless benefits to children .
rimary school , e bs ment fo learning , children are easi d faster to gai knowledge .
o nly les udy burden when compare by secondary shol , bt they are ab communicatin with foreiges as ell as xtnd their societal network urng that piod and the lar ie .
Rath hn concern aut th challegs , childrn ould cnfront wth , it is partclarly advantaged f them to grasp foreign language during t elementary school .
By y of cocluion , I once ain reafirm my poition th advantages of learning foreign language at primary school is much outwgh tha the drawbacs .
Given that these cldren wld he a better development in the future as el as more fee tim .
it is a try of a oy , who alway find out t a to tas her ister suh .
on dy he got fght with her sister , even he made er cr.both of them st talking to ac ohr nd after soe day the o need lapop of er sister sukh .
suk ws so angry with hi becuse he heart her a lot , sukh rfuse to give her aptop and her brter start again fightig wih hr and even he slapped er sister .
sukh star crying n e said she is not ging to gie u my laptop unil you do n't fee sorry .
he brother pick er lptop and threw it and brke h laptop , hn boy close h door and ke at that ment he had md a mistake .
In my opinion peop 's lives will chage dramatically in 50 yers or so , because the orl is hangin al the im , and we have a lot of techology nd things to do .
People change their way of thining nd try to do new things .
What is more , te do not h sm things as their parents did .
To m p I thnk it is enevitable .

Then we go to a red bus n drov to our hotl .

we already did a lot , but still to do more eded .
first of all , rubbish factores should be sent bend the ity

So my proposition is to post se informative letters and ostes arnd t ciy , and give igger punishnt for littering!Also frm the governent sd to incase of trash bins nd faclity tff members .
clients serc , customers support , conficts soluion
comilation of wedding arrangemens and bouquets

Th hv to wlk a lo distnce to get to he bus stp .
Buses are ve coded .
Buses ak a very long route .
It aes u vr long tie to et to your destination .
If u hve a r u can get to your destiation in a sho time .
r own ake care of the enviremont of o neighbourhood er seriously .
here ar many paces ere you ca thrw aa our rubbish .
On these sits hee are different kid of cntainer for al sor of rubbi hich you a collect at hoe .
Like glas , plasic or papr -ontainers .
Te cenre of our town , where the supermaret is , ds lso hve a si r dmping ur rubbish .
In th suprmaket ou can fid a container for bateies .
Not only the supermartket ha thes containers , ty are so in the chools of the neighbourhood .
In my opinion his gvs a good example of he nvolness of the local government .
Anothe pint where I 'm pleased about is ha our town is kep cla by a specia roup of employees of or communit .
This happens weekly .
Tey walk arund in all the streets n ik up all the dumped matrial .
This make our neihbouhood a pleasant ace to be .
Fr the at I an say hat they o also put containers for al yu rbbsh , u even specal ontainer in te pak or he the dogs their ' pooh ' .
So this helps tat te chidre could ly in a much cleaner par .
Studying verseas is not only changing condion , t also facing many ots of unkno pressure .
Roughly speaking , there ar three causes of pressure .
Frst of a , the bgest prblem is studig .
It is not easy to adpt a new learning envionmnt , th lnguage is th bigest difficlt .
Students have to do assignments with anoher language nd use different thnking maer .
The seond pblem oud be fom peers ' stresses .
The culture shock is that international tudnts ned to overcome .
Studes want to mak n local frinds , but ultral cusoms and taboos coud be a problem to be notied nd adapt .
Lastly , the oblem is fo students temselves .
eving comfort zoe , and everythng is frsh .
Sudent have to confront d get ver every challenge .
As family a fiend do not accompa , stuets must do a lo om bsc living to uure studies .
It is ad to liv overseas lone , Therefore , making friends from he ae country n assist e another .
Besides , attemptng open mind .
To get along with international friends is a grea y to exnd horin .

Introduction
Te m of this repot is to describe and asss shop , hch uld be interesting for torists .
The majrit of people visiting Katowice are focused on ree aters : sovenirs , fashon and fod .
Souvenirs
It seems at thr is not any pces in city center where yu cn ind souvenirs like postcards or books about h histo of towice .
Fortunatel , vistors would nd al of that in the urist Information Oice nd in shops on t ouskirts .
The on , ich is really woty to see is " Kato - Svenirs " .
They provide all sorts of funny oal gadget .
ahion
My favorite sort is football .
It 's e mt opuar sport all over h word .
I enjoy it because it 's ell nown and easy to find partners to play with .
Wtching football is also a wonderful experice .
My fvorite international league is e Eglish premiere laue .
My advie to anyone who ill start is sport is to start it earl and pl it regulrly not to loose fitnes .
As joinig a tea will be a great idea .
T environnt is an important part of our life contributing in a posiie way in our part of life withot ee concrn about mportan parts r us to survive .
Humans can easily damag h environment just thow heir waste without recycling or run the places where animals ae living .
Defors t woods can damge the cle of natur .
Withou oret ca n't be animals an the huma being can dispper .
Some people do n't ve cr and just h do n't to ern moe deforests the trees and el to do furniture .
They even a nt plant oter trees .
I notic that in supermarkets are usig so mch plastic just to cover a small ing or e usng mn plastic bags without even thn o vulnerable is r t environmen .
I used to lie o a ort time in a place whee word recycle as comletel ignored but they used to thi bease that was n't so rich .
Whe I live now I notce that have he opportunity to recyclin h ate because it is a posh aea .
In my oinio I tik the govrnmen suld take cae of all ea , een is a poor or rc aea .
Te pollution has a negative contribution to the environent .I saw on television tha wild birs are healthir in rural area han brds from ura area .
Birds from rban area is diffict for them to nd a proer food instead .
Some peope from area which I live tey used to feed te birds but others they do n't even ca .
To keep all the nare aive we ust conribute everyne of us for future generation .
Taveling by a is mor comfotable than public ransport , easier a faster .

I usually work in the kitche so it does n bother me .
Moreover , I am willig to hlp oganie spos or evening activites .
Moreover , I do le looking afte ildren .
For instance , I take cae of my epews ne a month bcause nowadays my brother is often bus .

Ti rpor is bout hw my ciy taes re of th environment .
The eoltion of my city is mre or lss similr to the evolution of my cuntry .
I am living in the center of Sai , in a small iy .
When I was child , my cy was drty becae people wr throwing their rubbish on th loor .
owevr , a f ears ago te government has ad more attention to he environmen to our country ; for exmple they made a ot of advertisemen on televion , in newspapers nd on te internet to explain at t ubbish is not good fr ur wor .
Noways , we c see in l street a lo of ins and it is difficult to see rubbsh on e floor because mny people a cleaning h ty .
Also , ildren must clan teir chol on a mon .
Tee ypes of actions produce god habits in r society .
In the futue , we us do an effort to improve our environment bcause we will wa to give t sae word or if it is possible a better world than beoe to r sn .
No bod a deny that transportation is on of t most important thins in our life .
No counry can live without trnsportaion as it 's te real manin of connection between ach oter .
Car r much onvenient but this n mean tht al othr ens of transportation are not important .
sometimes may popl wnt to tavl faraway alog disancs so they need plane .
ter people refr to rave by trns as it 's faster a more cofrtable than ars .
Man ounties ik to ravel by bikes in orr to decreae the polltion hich appene by car exhusted.to my point of view i prefer traelling by cars hch is more comfotable .
Now in every country we hve lot of transportation means as plane , trains , undgrounds , cas , hip , and rockets .
public transprtatio is the mean reaon to delivery people everywhere in a sall tm . in the past t d to use camels to avel which wste lot of ti nd tiredness .
Today our life is running by cloc .
We eed a vehicle to reach our rk pace .
If we use or public trnspor srvices .
we y be late to office / workin place .
So we ust use he personal vehicle .
Everybody thinking like the public transport is t comfr for us , but environentally the blic transport is suitable to decease the pollution ad our enrg sources also decrease .
In Lulin is a beautiful cstle .
It is my favourite lce in Lublin .
It is octed next to the Old Town .
It ws built in wefth century .
h cale 's look is in the Ne - othc style .
At e cast is Hy rint Chpel .
It is in a Gothic syle .
It was ult as a foundton of Kn Casimir he Gre .
hs is ne of te mst valuable monuments in Poland .
There is a twer by the csle in the Roman tle .
Tis tower is a preciou onment of roman art and it is one of the odest building in the Lubin .
It was a part of e orough casella .
Catl als s a coutyard .
N on the castl is a museum .
It to belong to t olds and h biggest museums in eastern Plan .
This museum has a monuets of the suerioity .
In my opinion it 's the one of the ms fascinatg place in oand nd te most wonderful site in Lubli . I think that everyone should viit ths castle .
Th restaurat hat I will talk is Wody Pool .
oody Poo is in pin .
Thi retaurant has a good atmophee bcause it is always peple lahing a talking bou funny tins .
e food in th restaurant is ery god and a a ubnoral size because it is mu biger than the useful fod .
h famous dsh of ths restaurant is a huge hambrgure
hs restarat wll be an amazing place to the cll meet there ecaue like I id efre the atmosper an fod are amazing .
In my opinio , public transpot il become more and oe importat in the ftur . Travling by car maybe is conveniet , but it also brings ar pollution and traffic jams .
If in a cit there we only as , e city would n't afford nugh parkng os and rods , all t cars would m the cty , and people ould n't e thei destinations .
On the other han , ca need more gsolne ta uss which let out O nd other kns of wse gases nt th ai , leading to te serious air pollution .
So , what we need is to devoe much or oney and time to mrove t publ transport .
Publi transport il have brigh utre ; on e contar , travelling by ar will vanish fr u lie .
My fvorite way is Train .
Pane is most fastet in another a to tavl .
Hwver , plane is mo dngerous y to tavl .
Bot is the mot cheapest in nother w to travel .
However , boa is ms slowest wy to travel .
So , trin is intermidiate way to tarvel .
My favourite sprt is boxing .
Because I lke boxig .
I lke fight , bcause I ke to i someone .
I start this spot wen I as 11 year old , my dad et me go to bo and I stt hat spo .
Then I started to go wit my friends .
I stared leading trener in the competition and I lov ti sport .
My favourite boxe is Floyd Mayweather .
He is very good on his sport .
ody , the people use more cars , whic eas to more as on he street , traffic and polltion .
I think is bete the da that te people to se public transpoation inted of usng prate cars or motorcycles
Frstly , people do not ave to buy thi own ars .
Accordingly , peole do not have to spend lots of mey on gas tht they have to fill te tank .
Also , they do t have to nd a place fo parkig as well .
Terfore , these a the reasns hy I agee with th orm to lower the congestion and air olltion by encourage people to use less priat cars and turn to use more public trasportatin a othr forms r trasportatio

Funding for t English anguae Club
As the secretary of the English anguag lub I am writing you this prposal to persude yo as to hy it woud beefi both te students , and the colle if we old receive funding from ou .
Dear sir or madam ,
I am writing to aply r h b in the USA , published in an adertisment , last Mday .
I had rcetly fnishd my couse of english in Camrdge , also I have a resh n improve English .
In rde to help organising on pors and evening actities , I am a yng pron of 12 years od .
Man eople sy hat there is no future o pbli trasprt as cars a now so much ceaper and eaer to buy .
Additioally , because pubic trasport is expesive and doe no have a comprehensive coverage of os cits private cr r more attactive fr mt poeple .
De B .
I went to our new shoppng centre at wek at t downtown .
Atually I am er hap to ell you tht we have a o of nw stoe , ncluding apple 's sto .
Long a we d no stores to bu rodcts or whatever were o neds .
However ro ow one we n buyin what we really need , on e oth hand this shping may help a ot of people get bak working aain .
A few weeks o I wen into pple 's sre , so tht I bought a ew mobil phone , it is awsom bcause it has reliab tools which allows me ong my daily wking .
Soe pple ay that a rip by ar is me covenient hat by t ulic transportation , bu hat sttement has a lo of issues if we thk about he limitations .
It is true at trael to a neby place rm your city , it is moe cofotable getting her by ca , nd th ee of have your ar to t whrever you an wthout spendin money and ime aing abs .
Bt , the public transporttio hav a lot of futur aase a o of reason , irt th im , if te place yu want to reach finally is really ar th dfferent yp of vehicls of public transportation will t y there faster than your car , alo t complictins bout t field , like if yo nt to go om America to Europe thee is no hgway that cos h ocean o nee an airplne d unles yu ave n , you will can t reah travel etwen continets ith or car , a diffent reson is pltics , because if you wnt to go from anywhere in he UA to Alaka you wi not need to pass thogh Canaa , the cmmodity is a really iportnt reasson becue drive for 8 hours is exhausting d it will be unsafe also , th enomics is a factor to , becue the ttition of yor car it will be more that in the normal use a te pre of food and extra tops ht you will need to do , it il be xpesive that in pubc transportation .
In concusion , for me it is a i that the pubi transporation has no fure , hwevr , te ave to make improvements to this like the u of better ways of fuel or energy , one way is using renovable sources of energy such as slar , haeolic ( wind ) or idralic(atr),Also there r biodise , and gasoline xtracted from seaweed .
And he ulic transportation il be ore important in a f yers than w .

Althogh , t advancement of technolog , bside han bring advntages fo everyone , it 's ao ill ase disadvantages , such as unemplyment bcause mchins will make the same or work beter tha humans .
that 's why I agree tht pele 's live will chge ramatially in the next 50 yars .

No one a deny the importance of travelling .
Without travelling people would be very bored , li would be very monotue .
So , in the fuure we ill dispense of tpes of tasportation .
In these das , we use cars to travel between untries .
Cr are very easy to use .
Peole ca n't ispens of cars tse days .
Families ca n't dispense of cars .
So we should ow he rght ay to drive .
We should be careful wh we drive .
We should be careul from careless drivers .

I agree this ffirmtion because the publi traport is more expensive han car , is lo and is lss economic .
the car is ess exensve , more confortable , oe as a more security .
every im the ca is more utilied ad more economic .
in my opinion the a more advantageous an c a the r is more useful
To my mind ti mind not right .
Frs of ll tavellig by r is er exensie .
For exapl travellng by train is cheaper d traveling by pla is faser .
Secondly it 's not coortable.ecouse you every y drives instead of relaxing a ejy the envirment
Using pblic transport has certain advantages and also , disadvantages .
It is sad that pepl efer goin by bus to a close lace , but so of then do n't tnk t same .
The public transport has plenty of advantages .
Sme eole ca n't afford to buy a car or to pay or ol , as it is onstantly sing , so uing a publi ranspot is an econmi way to travel .
On th ther hand it hels to reduce the poltion md by rs , ..
Besides , it il be always ueul fr eople ca n't drive .

The eason is they r tie of sing public tansport and they would et earlier to everywhre .
In h futre , rs wou be so cheap th everyn wl have ne , hu , it wll take up e end of th publi transpo .
To sum up , I would say tha people will us mre and more public transport , as the oi is gettng expensive .

e television is ne of th most impotat AV media in the wld .
You an use it fr mn purpos , according to yor need .There are a lt of channels in man les , fr instance , dcation , movies , sgs , sports , news and so on .h television is t only for entertainment u als for education .h television can entertain ou trugh it 's enertaine channels , and h teevsion can eucate u through it 's educational chnnels .
At this ime ad ag , most of the eople hae their n car or vehicle fo their transpoation .
It is also mke convenient or pepl who are rushing tie to work , meeing and so on .
Howeve , I ae no agree with this statement because the ubli tranport is eeed fr someone who ae no have vehil or economic downturn .
Public trasort is cap an friendly for nvironment .
fitly , h ar of ubic transport is cheaer compared with buying a new car .
he erson at do o av to save lrg mount of mone to b th car .
hy can use th money in more useful or maningful wy such as ivestment poperty .
The fr of public transport is less than n vehice hen cmared fae of bus to fulfill whole tank of oi .
Sme mre they are needed to pay a parking ee for parking .
Secondly , air pollution is a serious problem nowadas .
Because of everybody h to leave or noher ace tough heir own car and carbon dioxide rleased rom he ca .
The public transport is a y to reduce the a polluton because it can cry more than a dozen ime te pope in a tme n rduce thi ow vehicle .
So , it c also hlp to reduce h trffi jam roblem .
Lstly , ublc transport hat e alway bled by the people th are slowly nd trouble ha own vehile .
Alhouh th public transport is sw but it also do not take a log tim of peope to each tei desination because plic transport noaays re developed re fa nd enough .
In cnclusion , public transor is needed r everybody in a necessary time .
It alays can make us save th mny and ake te environment more naure and fresh .
Nowadays , the space r countries enlarges , nstead of wih , the area for farmland , forets an wetland is getting smaller .
This kind of situation brins all kinds of rblems to mannd and aimals .
h lag - scale buling projcts took the sace hic shuld belong to the animals .
h food for them and their livig spa migt nt be enog .
Sme knds of animals would mve to t uba ae , tea he food fm us n leep on he stets or in e underground .
Hwever , most of th might be arrested .ol a little number of them miht be adopted by those friendly human .
On the other hand , e expanson of city increase olluton of all kinds of garbage . The air poluton is much more serious now , d watching t bu y is almst imposible in sme big cities .
Althgh the mdical skills gt troner , the percentage of people ho get caer is stll improving .
In concsion , h lare - ale building projcts tae h living resource from aimals , crease the ossibilit of getting cancer and so on .
nly if te government evelo or technical prerty , pay more attention to the environnt protection , sch as uild more trs ad grss in he ctes , ad st a secal low for ose mise animals will help decease the ham that he uildng project brings to us .
Fr me , my amily mebers are not my best friends although I wish they r .
If the are yur bt fiends they wil guide yo nd help you to be to be he bt of yo , they wo n't hurt yo or trn hir back on yu .

Thee are dening that the environment are change by ehavior of peopl a animas .
F instance , people need to man laces to build th modern society , so hey al down lots of trees , burnning man glsses .
Another fctor tht he nimals are no ontrl themselves to eat the plaits ln to distriction of ecosytm .
Nowadays , the ransportation become ore prefect , and t ople'if bcme more convenient .
Althought ths chng lend te life of peop efficent , he problem shul ot be ignored .
It would raly be helpl if e government mak tightr resrictions , in today 's world , lot of onstricaion companies and fatries a not adisson , they are destyed the forest , frmland and wetand , charging waste wte a emitting greenhouse gas , it lead to a serius envormet roble .
So te govenmen should ovree this compaies , a if companies do ot bey h rules or lws , it will be fined and closed .

Taking the train is more ost effective than ting a car to work as petrol is ostly and t new tansportatio office s reduc the cost of tickets to assis wt the dly livig expesn we encunter .

2- I thk on th futue n transport and roads wil be mr organiing more tn these ds .

sports is vey uc benefica for our health .
i would like to play footbll ecause it 's t much exciing game . in poortion to ength it takes nly 90 minutes . whenever i go e oportnity i played fooball .
Divig car while listenig to musc is muc more fu or ms of people so maybe that 's hy mosy love to drive thn taking public transport .
In cotrary som gus hate getting caught in raffi jam so prefer pubi transport;sm other reasons may be rising gas pice , c crshes or hatin drivg !
As a rsut I thought both driving and public transport have their roles and we need to ak each in the iht situation .
I prer to avel by trn .
I have two reasons why I think so .
Fst , there ae many kids of types hich train as .
For example , in our country , " Shinkansen " which measns brrtt trn is fmos ad very fas .
" Blue tan " hich h my ds in train an we can sle comfortabully in train .
Th , o ol to id bu aso to watch trai is vey interesting fo me .
Second , travelling by trai is sa and reasnable copaed to plane .
Recently altoug here are many L careers we an choi , it is still expensive to tavel by plane .
TTravelling by train is che and getting chike is ea for us in u country .
Ad terolism is sce so .
The pane wic trve from Egypt to Russia was exploed by terolit in lt month .
Compaed to plane , trai is relatively safe because it cn mve nl on the land .
These rason re why I think raveling by tin is favurable .

Our ath is etting sick as days go by .
For exmle , air , water and an pollution .
There are several efforts that we cn contribute in order to ave he environment .
We sart litl by ttle to hel it .
First of all , I want to ephasie on reucig te uage of plastis .
It 's th basic ings and a habit tt we can start easily from u own .
Plastics are non - biodegradable hch degrade aftr 1000 yers .
Non - biodegradale plastics could actually piles up the landfill a cause the land use in our earth to be occued .
esides , it destroys the marie ecosystem in sc a way that the seabrd or fs r f on plastc .
This cause thir reprodcion sysem to be destroyed .
Hence , we hould bring or own recycle bag or basket evy time we go fr shopping and resist temptation to ge plastic from he .
Besides , we shul use public transport or carol in order to educe t CO emission into te environment .
If t dstnce to destination is shor , we cold replace dring by walking or cycling .
That 's the descent wy in redcing t advere environmental mpact a we a able to prtect u Earth
Since GM crops technology started to be implemented it he implied in favourable socioeconmic chans .

My avorie sinr is Adam Lvece .
Thse as peopl car but pricy and ence a personal car not only provides privac u lo cnveniene .
Hence , te nw lury ar are getting cheaper a powerful .
The seed of life has en fastened , people do n't ave ime to wait fo a taxi or in the bus stop to t their wor done , they wan their work oe in he blnk of an y .
So t ed fr s s become unncessary d our o cars are simy time consumi .
Eeryon has a car .
Ee kids arted to learn driving at fiften an most of he parents gi car in thir siteenth brthday .
We can see deermine the futre of transpoation by differentiating t nubes of cars and buses .
Studet hae trted to use thir ow cars than e u .
So I hnk th future of pulic transportation is in darkness .
My favouite port is crcet .
Cricke hs become a pr of me sine when I was a id .
ts vey interesting spor .
Cricket brings a passon on me whenever and wherever its possie I fn out a y to strt te me .
I also wch crikt patiently .
Its known as the gentlman 's game .
T best par of this game is batting hethe someone knows or not he first prefer to bt .
Batting hs i on cherish .
So , I also prefer to bat and itting hard rahr an bowling .
Its very siple d wndrful sot .
If u play criet ou are surely goi to urn many bad calores adhered side ur by .
In India cricke is worshpped an plaer re the lord .
The best part of ths game is you ca play with every e oup at a single me .
I was very intereted in making my areer through this bt due to my studies I ca n't ta effort toard this .
So , if a going to ply hs sport do otice that there e som rules nd be se that o have all safety stuffs with yu . Please do n't orget to take pleasure of batting first .
I hope yo e ing to ly the best gam on your part .

My favourite sort is runnng .
I usually r in e ornng , we my roommates a still sleepng , I get up and run in the playground .
I enjoy running , esh ai , warm un and slight wind .
When I am runin , all preesure I undtook as gone .
I am fil wit hope .
I started running because I endured neck pan ad my lt leg is ot comfortabe whn I at all a .
Furthermore , I ant ruce my weigt as well .
I bouh shoes , clothes and GP atch , I old myself : ow it is a chllenge , I us defeat myself .The fis d is so pinful , I was tred to d when I st a nearly 3 km , ut tigs becomes better and ettr , and o I culd run 10 km .
If you want to sart runnng , firsly , yu need a comfortable hos n clths , and secnly , make a lan , like how lo shuld I n today , remeber , appropriate rest is necessary .
Do n't make a gal ht o ca n't reach , or you will lose or confidece soon .
he mst importat thin is yu willpowr .
First I wl s a question to you if this is yo w house , you bu it with a lot of money nd will you oke it with no reas ?
Of cours the answer is no!Everyone knows that " rth is our hom."It is bigger than a house .
We ha Eather first than popl thnour house .
Eather is u home , we al have to protect it .
But ow people are distroy it .
Jut f mony or oe house bt if we destroy it we will all die our money ill oe our hose ill goe we will have nothig .
Beside so people destroy farand to bild oues ut if oe day tere is no frmand ta wat should we eat?Nothing at that tme we a a nothi!So what should we do ?
Forest brigs us fresh air bu8 t if tre is no tee , wha will hapn ?
We ca n't breave we ill die , too !
So my idea is i te ouries athe peop sp to use frmland , forest andwetlang to bul houses grow more tres potect r worl , ou homestar !

First , the ecture tas bot " Saan " tht propose a challange to proe that he urng 's test as not nclusive , than he reate a paradox .
He selected people to into in a hnese ro , there was a computer in chine language with diferente symbol , t mericn was a diferente behavor , ey i not understand wat was in the compuer screen .
Different fom the originl test ntion on th text , that l t participants were americn an native speakers from that langage , it was rlly easy to understand what ws in e coputer creen .
Second , e tex support tha the comuers re ealuate by te w eopl that submitd the es .
Not vryone can by a car .
Fo any , thee are other important expenses that need to be cered .
For example , for the yng pele in ollege te studies ar more importan , as well as books , eminar , travellng , etc .
Nowadays , Pblc Transport as become a very important wy to go to work , to travel to ter cits , or to simply go to visit a friend to t othr side of e city .
I are , fr many pople travelling by ca is uch more onvenient , however , in my opinion , her is still a og future fo public trasport .

Lke eer one , I a a norma person leaing & impving day by day littl by littl fo mistaes .
I am witing to suggest a ew as what our cllege n do for the envronmet .
Firsty , how n the colge save energy ?
In order to reduc eergy consumption hold be me so tht as much as possil lecturs takes pace in t day time .
Ths oul ruce ergy eeed fr the lht sources .
Secondly , what sort of hngs an we recycl in th colege ?
It woud be a good dea to recycle apr , glass , mtl an plastic .
In order to improe te sorting , ere shou be a litter bins for eac mntiond substances in cassroms , corridors and utside .
Furthermor , th stuent a tutors shul be encouraged to use pbli transport , cling or alking .
inlly , ll the student should be taught lectres about the envonment .
I hop I find the answers to your queston in my letr .

And then , me heets d good bak notes fro damagd sets which would be t ino and separated nt equl nes andpked and depatched to wee they a demanded .
Another on whih were bad shes a bad bk notes from daaged pparntly , oud be esroyed secuely .
This as h whle workin process of the bank notes and it was onsst of 7 steps .
Th sort is one of th best form to be ealhy an mk some exercise .
o an lay it with our friends ad ave a good time .
The ost healhy sports r swimming , playing basketball , playin footbal or rnning but I prefer to play tenis .
My favorie spr is playin tennis .
I play it three ime a week ( on Tuesdas , Thursdas and Saturdays ) in the club of tui .
I had been playng tennis fro 2 yers go with two of my bet friens .
I enjy payig tens becas it is a spor that requires skil , ccentration and sped .
I am not ry goo at all but I like to pay it it my friends nd do maches on Saurdays .
Fo new tennis players I recomnd to know h to hld the racket , he position to hit te bal and how to put yr et .
They wil ae to concentrate on game and enjoy it .
In oday 's class , we wer discussing abou wheather or not we agre to he common enurmous pae salaries of foobal Players .
F me , as a assonated Soccer Player , it is a good Point to consder .
I recmmand to the Clubs , be warnd .
r intane Christiano Roaldo .
For him , as n of he top shed payed Players of european lague , it is no big al to by a Mercedes Benz .
He is arrogat .
He os not Need another one , but he likes e oour .
his way of thining he also Shows in game ime .
He is nt chasing afr the ll , is n ighting enouh to Keep it In e as he would really Nee the Money , he would beave totally different .
What influences dos ti salaries hv on th Clubs is quie simple .
Th sel the tricots for 20 Eurs mre per Pece ta la season .
By hs aciton a Ronaldo or messie c be payed d it is possible to bu the be em fo the leaue , like Bayern Munich is doing at the Moment .
But consider he rection of t fas .
r tem it is o osible anymore to rule o their Teams at n he game .
The tickets a to xpensive .
Te nger will soil ov someay .
Tis mak Footbl or Soer ever moe equsite to a crain rop of fan - Hoolgans .
As a result of These Action , it is an uncertain way to go o the Clubs .
If it sty on a certain Leve , no fan will complain about higher Pries .
But if he Prie wl be to gh , no onw wold vsi h games anmore .
Th im is to ind a blance a .
Business in My Hoe Country
In my home counry , tere re many diffrnt nds of business ultue ad custom .
For example , resturant business nd technology industry is totally different in Taiwn .
In ths 10 ers , Taianee hve ecme ejy our life , so many people like to drink coffee or ae an aftenoon tea .
That is h any busnss men wan to i in this competition , so ty created so an bargain activies , ik if you check nt places , yu will b one g ne free .
Apparently , restaant busnes is ceative d marketing - orientatio in Taiwan .
In corast , there are o different type of company in the technology induty .
Oe is original equipment mnufacturer , ke oxcon , workers in th company always need to do the sae thi and h executive in Foxconn al always ne to argain with Aple or Sasug .
Altough they produce high quality products hey receive a lite money and hve hh presur in wor .
h other oe is original brand manufacturer , ike htc , ty produce a l of new smartphones and sel it .
In three to or ears ag , htc mkes so uc money in the Europe , Tiwan and Japan .
he copny likes to produce new products and use high salar to ie great alens .
So c became more energeti d bod in main innovation .
In Taiwan , many young peol wt to ner htc .
inlly , Taiwan still suffers economic lum , but we ave so may businesses likes to innovate , market hei produ , custers lies to y it .
I hink Taiwan will be recovery in the near futre .
One evening , it was a blitring hot day tat I still should attende , one of my fends , a wedding cereoy .
I s drsed in nice si , goin to this pty .
Ter ere so man people talking to each other .
I id n't wa to cat wh tem frs .
Consequently , I dank the alcoho on te tabl , ooing fo , my frend , a bride .
I wanted to know how bautiful th woman wa .
As soon as the brid ppeared in rot of us , most people kept silent abruptly .
I glance at e grom jelously .
How lucky he could ary her .
I maintain a od - looking face , keeping fit .
It w ridicous tht I did n't av a girlfriend .
I prefer havi a nie gorgeous girl live with me to living alone .
Hower , I still did n't have a girfiend .
I as overwhelmed ih grief .
I col no san looki at them , clebrating .
Accordingly , I drifted to he part , gong home aln .
Hwever , I s too dizzy to go staigh so tht I took a ride .
I fell aslep immediately .
The rivr set me to a place here he know .
Wn I woke up , nt doing know wy I stayed the pole office .

It is vry true .
There is no future fr public ransort .
u nt so ny people have a driver licese .
They have to use pubc tranpot .
he public tranpor can connct peope .
You an meet evry in of people .
It 's some kind of socializin .
Th ublic transport is cheaer than te car .
helo , my ne is victor an I am going to tlk to yu about myself .
I nw that I am a sutale rson or is job , d I a say tat noboy is bettr than me for th incredible job , because I hae ben traeled o ll the wol and in this experienc , I ve se in the necesity on work to fanc my jorny , so the I he dedcate to work on smmer camps , n I hae a o of experience in this .
I ve ohe qualities like , cooking lk uer chf or een bter thn that , I am he pern me organizated in ths country , and I love to work wit children because it is a form to tah veryhing you knw to other peple and help to improve like erson .
I alwa do exercise , in the ornig I lik to runing on the ach , at e evenng I like to go to the y and at night I love to swim in my own swimming pool .
so in conclusio , I think at if you contract y , yo will get an axcellent people and an excelent orer
I think it is true that the puic transport there is not future , because tvelling by car is so muh mo comfortabe .
In my opinion the publc rasnprt is more expnsive and it is lss comfortale that the car , becas the ar is faster that the ublic tansport .
h puic transprt do stp me tie that the car , this transport go dect to t estination .
Today the eople use the applction " ba blah c " .
it is an pplicaion ha h people se fr save gas and money .
I beiee that the peol in a fuue they wil begin to travlling shared car more time ad they ue less te public ransport as the train , e u , underground , c .
h prolem ta I saw with ts , It is at in the ftre will be more plluion , bause there wil be man cars .

Terfore , I would like to highly state ht Grey 's Anatomy is my favorite soap opera .
e how seem diffiult , the charates always hav to face the situations whih is uneasy to ole , but prctically , thi show is a soap opera in hospital .
I used to think I eer lked soap opera , because it wa orig , o of date ad unworthy to watch , t hi was ju prejudice .
My mother als like this so .
Today 's elevisin is really good .

In h same way Australians have a different attitude about tei edation systm .

In Colombian some people ha a high attitude about educaion but thee e ome others ht have a very lw attitude .
This is ecause in Colombia hre are a lot of sial - onomic levels which ma people to have a dffeent a dividd aitude towa eductin .

Recntly , there is a growing country ose environment is destroyed by building house , hic accor for some debation .
Many would argue tt it disadvanages have already dispersed advantages , nd many othes vet his view .
With the tremendous thriving and growth of ot economy nd culturl dverity , the need of he reource is icreading , ich sd or building much - need husng and tranort networks .
Apparently , it is a go thng , becaus it is a sinificient symbol for te developent of a cntry ; however , on th other ha , doing large - scale buiding prjects may bing a galay of probes .
In the firt place , the nvironment is dsroyed , because tere a some tresses nd floers before ulidig the house .
What is wrs , th room of te house where some animls lve before , so they ot her houses , which beom the hoses of people , nevertheles , he eath is not only belonged to h hum .
Seondy , building ore houses not so muc because of livig by people , but more because of t econm , which is used for buildig speculatio an the price of t house is too expensive to buy for public peron .
Fr example , some pepe who have ots of mney iving in shenhn earn more oney by buying w pri and selling high price , athough they have hose to live .
Also , it is repoted th Chinese invesors hv dien up ousing prices in Vancouver by 12% .
Threfre , no long on the acts go unheeded , ad te governments av to eal wth these problems . We shoud forbid e act by seting certain w .
In a word , the government may appea in sme way , tt we should protec the earh ther than ol fau on ersonl profit .
owaday peol usaly s the car al the ds , actually for st of the iary tings ; despt the fact that there is small amount of peoe tha travel in public transport .
The cars pollue b amounts of carbon doxid , so tat is the rest of t gey skies of me citis lie Mari Beijing or ew Yrk a ry and this has to cange .
Ung the publi transport is " eathier " than the cr or th environment becus insde the bus can travel twenty three huma an is ony oe vehcle , oweer it would be wety cs .
Also people think tat travel in cars is ater than in public trnspor n I aee with it because the bus or the undrground is alays stopping in h difernt sttions , so in this way he car is better .
In my opnion , I will se h public transort , not always but oe hn e car lthogh you travel slowr because I at to se our planet , ha the rising generaton n le in od condtion .
My favourite sport
I have bee playing tnni since I wa a teenage and for tha rason tennis is my favourite sport .
The mn reason by which I lke playg tenis is because I can cntrol e amout of exercise tha I can do .
Tennis is n a coetive sot .
There are necessy jus two plyrs n if you e tired ad lose a match no e is going to be resosible but yorsef .
ha 's why ou can control yo limits .
esides , ou do t ned a lot of peope , as on foobal mach or exaple , to play tenni .
Sometimes it is difficu to oin so man llows to pacise a coletive sport .
Underontrary , on a tennis match you need jus o , dos n't matter if man or woman .
e exception is in a mah of double .
Even that you hae to fin only three more playr in ths case .
But , althug al ths advantages , h tenis plar h to take ar wth some daneros sitution .
r example , never tars a match witout a wam up because ou can suffer serious muscular injury .
It hppned th me once and was vy unconfortably .
Another er commom isk is to fall on the square wch an cause dangers scatchs .
In deste th risks , I recommend this sport for everyone o has a good physical condition .
u a oo racket , ar a air of ood shoes , find someone to ractise d start to enjoy .

Dear Dan ,
Thank you o sending he AA eort to us .
The rort was disussed at ou meting , a we wish to congratulate you on cmpletig is audit and providing the details and evidence on improving th outcomes from students results in this er .
ne straight oservation was t w number of stents at av tkn the math ourse .
We wondered if some work eed to be done to increase h student attendanc in the mh coure .
The digra gves informaton aout vaious stages in the process of mkng bak nots .
It is true that there ae five stags in th whole process.we can e that th processes begi wit design nd end at packing and distribution .
looking at the informtion in mr detail .
Initially , bank nte huld be considered th design such as background cour , rtwok , n securit issus.the,h peparation of tal plats is next stage.ban note should be sklle d mhinists.thereafe,his stae is printing .worke shuld p attentin to colour on both sides , special ink , d iage slightl rased .
sbsquently , this step is mst important.bank oe shuld be inpcted.bak nte seaated ito go an bad if e good qualit shts , th nex stag is packaging an distribution.at ths sae shets shoud be cut into searate bnk note , pake , n dispatched . if t bad sheets.the nest stag is disposal.band sheets and bank notes securely destoyd .
The diagrams show bank not how to make , tere a four steps to mak the bak nte .
First , the bank notes are deiged by consider , thinkig fro background colour , atwok , security issues .
Then , te mta plates are preparatd by skilled machinists .
And then , h sheets are printed , operator should py attention to the clour on bt sids , special n , n images slightly rise .
Thid , hi is the mo important st that print shets manull inspecte , the ts shets are classfied tree areas .
Te nmbr one caled good quality sheet , they will be aced n dispatched .
Te net cled partially amged see , and ban noe sepaaed nto good ad a , oo sheets wll be cutted nto seprte ak tes nd packed , the ad one wll be destroyed by fair .
he number three called bd sheets , thy ll be securely destroyed .
This a method of king ak noes , and the orater should pay atenton to the pinted sheets o to inspect .
These pictures obviously show us what detailed steps of the bank to produce apr money int the applicaion .
Befr th productin , ey shoul thin out the cover , incluing background clr , artwork and oes whch mk it ifferent ro the illegal ones , thn pt them into e printing machnes to cete them .
On te top of the seps is h inspectation by hns , that is to say , the shoul be separated into ll - qualiied ones , which are to be cut no ban otes , ad deliverd to t banks an t bad ones which ca n't be utilited a fired deiniely at he la stage .
In a wors , e processing of makn oney to bas is ver creative and serious , even rigid .
I now tha we can os anything that we want but ot ie this .
ae up wrd .
Lo at yu .
is your nose om your phone , an look at all hes nice things that the ife is giving us .
Read a book or play ootball if that is what ou lk .

We have to live or lie .
You ca n't ve onl on Facebook .

I hin public ranspor do n't lost .

If I will go travel I thnk a cr is very useful . u Movment of long distnce is ry te .
Consequently , you ca n't fun trael .
Cilden ca n't get a car license thus chilrn s Public tanspot .
Of course , Do n't he a r lcese people ca n't dre a ar .
Accordigly , I think need public transpor .
I thin that mbers of our family ca n't be our et Fiens , beuse maybe we do not hae e ame condence that we have in ur Friends .
F exape , maybe you have a personal ituatio , that is vey imrtant to you , b you do n ant ur family kow about it , so ou decd to tl your best ried , because you ko she wo n't te ayody .
I think it dpends on th situation , on te othr hn , your sister or brother , a be on of your est Friends , y a tl them important things , ut sk em not to tel your parents .
I 'm stuyin Business Administration , I hink my mjr is so busy .

Frst of a , family membes are those who wi keep in touch forever , so hey ko or habits h most .
orover , they know ho to iteract with us . They ca make you hapy , cheer up yr mind and alwy support yu when y a in trouble .
econdly , amily emers always know wht we are tnking abot .
Fmilie reaze r mind so mch ; Howvr , our clasmats or compnies ca n't rea ta bcause they do n't tay ih us l h time .
Oly families ca know us the st becuse they li wi us when we came to this wrl .

They alwas ive yu wat we lie to at .
In addition , th lways supply uc od to us so that we wo n't stay hngry .
Besides , atin with our families are e of the most happiness this in our lif .

Bause of h reasons above , we a say that t members of our family r our bst friends !

Frst of all , although tavellig by a become mre convenient , he growing population wic cau persoal vehicle is hard to manage .
he traffic jam becomes me and more sriou as fr .
uc as Beiing , the metropolis in Chna , fces the salie bd traffic as ch gverment ha to encourage e citzen go to wok by public transport uc as bus a subwa .
Aparntly , this method has made a great contribution to the traffic in Beijing .
So , t ublic transport is plying an imporant roe in our daily life , It shows an idspensable effects on the society wrk .

Introducion :
The aim of this eport , is to sho ow do my town tes care of the environment .
Home rubbih :
The mayor , in collaboraion with ipr , distributed lealts with informaton on " H to deal with household rubbish " .Each leaflet explains hw to separate he he rubbish .
Instead of putting he rubbish in oe trashcan , the familie should separate it in three different grps - paers , glsses n plastics - and put it int the correc eco point .
Th company responsible for ubbih collection collecs of the garbage , aredy sparated by the families , ad aterwards des te recicin .
Hw does he town reats h environment :
The City Ha is very cncerned in kepig te are cleaned .
In spte of the infrmatie sessions about the enviorenment , organized by th Myo f all of the resdentes , it also has lots of staff tat leans the streets , te ce of the city garens a colet he grbage .
E fredly :
In conclusion , I wold lik to y tat th city whr I live maintnes th city cleaned and attractive , for people tht live thre and for ths wo isi he cy .
I do beliee th h mebrs of my family r my bes friends for many reass.first of al , we t the me education as we grw ogeher we ow each other .
If I suffer ro ay poblm the frst sp I do is I r to go back to my lovely sister because deep inside I knw he is only member that an asst me .
Seondly , if I need money I will cme back to my brother or sister I ak them to borow some mone .
I ink public rnsport hs good prospect in t future according on following rasons .
First , th tred of environmentlly friendly has grow sine h shortage warenss of fuel , taking blic transport ca deceas h ai polltion by car , an moe goverments ha build the pbli transport system including suwa , bues c .
The ranspor in the city is n't inconvenient as ear ago .
The other is , traveling by ar is n't onenient if you go to e fmus resorts , most famous resorts lack of pakig lot , travelers may ped hours to ar .
On t contary , pepl wh ta the public tansport c mre enjoy e travel because te do n't ast vitality on driving .
To summarize , bease the velopment of public transport is more an me compet , the advantage of travelling by ar ws placed by pubic tansport gradually , the future of t public transrt is ight .

Mlaga is a town that tak ca of h environment .
Around the cit , there are a lt of containers fo rubbish , pieces , lastic and crystal .
All people has very coe someone to recyc .
Also , you can u clothes and shoes that you do n't ne it fr Africa children .
So , Malaga is responsibl with the environment and with eole wth moe necessities .
Secondly , in Malaga thre are strong nd hard ruls for factorie .
Tee companies us take care of the environment or ty would ha to a g tax at e counil .
So , in eneral , I thin alaa is ve responsile with the environment and acts in consequence .
The a of livng change everya : if we tink aout our randpaents ' , but also abot o rents ' life , we notice many differencs .
bove all they alkd me : we live in te e of the telecomunication nd nn culd li without their obile phone or heir computer .
Be always in conta with our friends has come our ay of living .
Mreover als simple things re chged , for exampl he ood we et : some mes ago everythingh as naturl , ealthy ... b now everyone eat always " juk foo " and thigs ie tat , wch ar cpletely unhealty !
Howeve , Ho will pple 's lif chage in e next 50 yes ?
As a result of what I have jst said , in my oinin people wo n't ha a " really life " : everyone will be away more involved in the virta life so at they will foget ho to talk ac ohe d o expes own feelings !
About h fods , I imagie a fute sociey in hic estaurant wo n't exi : people will t only junk foods and fo , wich has been prepared before , fod in n ... so all unhealthy hingh , which will cause many prblems .
r hi eason I also imagine tt in the ture doctor and scientists will have so much to do !
Do not ru ou le , it could be all so perfect !
My favourite spor is soccer .
Alo , we can lear to help each oher in h tam .
My favorite trc is ntmeg .
My favourite scce laer is Frank ampard .
My favourite team is Chelea FC .
My favourite soce pich is og Kong Stadium .
My favourite sccer is te Bzuca .
I started soccer when I was four .
I often play sccer wt my father an my brother .
Whe it is holiday , my brother and I lay occr wice a week .
It is raly good to py soccer !
Everyne is afraid of omethng .
A o of people e afad of catasrophc vets ve thought it 's vey improbable tat e ame thig will happn to us .
me fer are instincive n it 's postiv because it protect us from real danger , it 's a good reponse .
But the phobia r which we experience ht are life - threateng ad ey can disrupt veryday life , b peope n et over with th right sot of theray .
So if we wt to live a life which is n't controled by ou fears , we ut try to be mr oective and a mre atention to the real ngers .
We shold spend less im worying n mor time bin hapy !

Nowadas , public transport is usd f man people in te cities , we can fd diffeent types of th , sh as bu
tube an trin , bt is there a future for it or not ? , I am gog to respond hi question giing disadvantanges and avantages an nally I gie my persoal opinion .
To egin with , Plic transports is not as comfortable as usn our wn veicle , every d , about all in the morning , it is uually crowded , d to people th begin to work .
Secondly , ming in a ty in public tansport could be horrible , ter are too many statio , and we spend a lot of im on them unti we arrived at ome .
Althug I ae writen sme disadvantages , ublic transport is better ha pivte .
Fistly , if anyon wat to move in he ity usin th cr , that cld be er expensive , e to trafic jam .
eondly , Public transport is more ecological ad less polluted wh the enviromment , so as it is producing less polluted um , nd an of them s green nergy , such as electricity or gas .
In conclusion , from my oit of view , public transport is more necessary now than nev beore , ctes cntais more automoviles ad the pollution is worse , we ne to change our id , n y to use the as other altenative to improve te nvirommet of our cites .
as week , my cls and I wn to Sicily for a schooltrip .
we visited my cities .
the ist day we ent to Tormna ad iardii Naxos , the day aftr we isted iracus , the thi day Agrigeto n The vlley of the temles d the last day we saw Marsala and Trapani .
I ejoyed l the cities we saw t te bst in my pinion is Siracusa . in parioular I liked Ortigia at is the oldet rt of h ci .
I als ikd the Valley of the temle of Agrigento so mh : it w aazing .
I hik at t wrst thing of h rp is that t la nigt in our om hee were a lot of insects and ome spidrs and we mus change Room .
public transport no a days has become a bit uncomfortble beause we an no thnk of availability of seat .
large number of people s it wih reslt in over - loaded ues d trains .
it take too much me to ravl by public transport tha by ersonal vehile.the is scacity of bue in pulc transpt d her timings oo are not fixd .
ravelin by car or a other peronl veicl is oo much re convenient beause it takes too uch less time n it takes us irecly to h plae were we wan to go .
In a recent ime priet trasport is more conenient thn pubic transportaion , although public transport ike buses , train , ferres and intercty ail ae cnsumin les time a energy but smetimes t create problems .
In public transport eople oun to shar transport means with stranger ad also we have to persu comay olcy or reulations , but with ther o transport we do n't have to othe about these thing we travel when we ant and when we have time .
We do n't ve to boo tikets in private transport .
So we cn say that travelling in their o transportation is more comfortabe .
Peop had drived car to go a wrk .
he cty have a t traffic .
They prefr to go work car than us .
Pubic trnsport is very eap ten car n reduce traffic in the city .
It 's ru dve by car is so uc mor conveniet , because eple do n't nd to wai bus .
They cn drive ny hu , they can to go and to come any oent .
The can rvel ather pce , iependent th hor .
s , oat and tra are ublic ranport mot used o peopl .
Some citie her are n't bt , because do n't have iver or sa .
It 's comum in city the bus .
Some bus have speil and preferencial t to ol eole .
his is interesting becue peopl are practice soliary .
I think could have a t bus in city .
Mny r is oluent or planet and is aergic to people .
The rain do n't hv poluition .
Th transport is better to population an do n't ve traffic in city .
Another iea is ride a icycle and to wa stret .
hi can help heuthy t peopl nd ity wl sty mot lan .
So we must reduce by a on stret .
We ll be very hay and we .
will be mo heauthy .
My fvourite sorts walk , I really li hi port o seveal reaon :
1- It 's very common I can do it anywhee and anytime I wa .
2- It 's very cheap , I il t buy anything to do .
3- It 's not ard sport , in al cases I wll ot be ird after walkn .
4- It mkes me relax bcause I st doing my acvity ro work d sudy .
5- It ges me ig te to thk on all my li without an distributins from anybody .
cause al these reasons wlking is my favourite spr .
From few ers , pople use differet typs of transprt . We ride by bs or by r .
We fly at plane or something oer .
The travelling by a is mo convenient in my opinio .
Frstly , you save mny if yu e a car .
he yu ide by b , yu pay more .
Moreover o travel ith the ohe pople .
Yu sta in que for buy a ticket .
Seodly , you should feel uncomfortable .
At soe means of transport is to crowded and you ven ' t t a place to stay .
omeimes you i on a window .
It is n't good .
Fnlly , if yu ride a c you must ae aou timeale . You a go at vry ou .
Whn o go by bus for eamle , you mus wait at cd bu stati .
I hate this .
At um up , in my opinion travelling by cr is bettr .
Yo hae comfort , o feel bettr .
Y do n't have to worry hat you do n't arrive in me .
Unfortunately , is very sad to a ha people in my town do not care aut the enviroment .
We ee to stat doi smething to avoid containatio .

The idea of mk a film comes up a aturday ngh at a metin of friends .
At first we thougt tat t idea s just a ke , but Jake , on of my fiends , id tha he had cared a video camera .
When Jak said ta , we stat rr with laughter , ut then , nothr friend ofered the idea to do a home film .
h xpeience aou t film was amazing , because we laug all niht and we enjoyed that very cool dea .
In itsl , e film did n't av an especiay pic , but I can escrie it like riend 's im as appes lt of laghts , jokes , and it refleced tat friendship is t greatest thing tht exists .
By the way , I 'm sending the film togther wh hs letter .

Runnin is my teray .
I startd running to oe weight and ende in a lie chagng exeriene .
Some m ay that running is very simlar to religion , bt to me is mor than that .
Runing coects me to my inner Godess .
Running is cheap and evryoe can ake up nning , no experience required after all it is just oe step afte th other .
In My countr Bus 's car is te essetal public trsport .
So I got a lot roubes :
1 . Everyone seds much times to rael .
2 . Bu car 's driver does n't care peole h aroud him .
Tha ens he is a careless , who lways ives o fat
But puic traport has advntages : If we uses it is the essenal transport to trvel .
Therefore nvirnment il be mroved .
Mab traffic 's accdent is decreased
I am writing to repor on the local transport of Toluca .
The publc transport most ue in Toluc is el s bcause it is he most cheaper , but it is very ba and unaf , the ualiti of it is very b , te buses are old d obsolete these have brokn indos and old ad broken seats .
The service is very d t drivers r very ngry and strese out these do not led with cauition , in Touc exist report of high rts of ccidents by buses .
The pubi transprt is unsafe because groth the theft an kidnapping express to users .
I sugget changig e l uss by new ues and pu security cameras in the bses .
That t ameas transmitted immediately the image of the robbers at oer buses to ensure ta they ae alert , d that t dvers eceiv trning and sanction by conduct ad .
I think we live very uick , always runnig , we do n't enoy our les .
Bcaue we want a lot of ney , a lot of hings ... we are always working for giing more ony , we do n't mee our neihour for example .
Maybe in he future wll be worse .
Thr is is no ftre fo pbli trnsport because ca has made if so eas .
It 's economically and practically is ore expensive .
Peol
Prfr to u rs instead of public transport .
It 's saves time .
In old times luuries were t considered as compare to Heslth bt w every o prefer to sve te and maintain privcy wich one a onl ffrd by usin he / i priate transport so gradaly publ tranport loing it charm .
public transpot
I think it 's very important as it reduce t problem of oh pollution and population we se f transport as it is i and carr a lot of peple .
underground , trans and buses hes means of ransport are cheap so it helps e por to save some money .
government should ake are of public trnspot they houl ae means of entetainment peoles should keep them cean d saf if te ue it carelesy it ll be useless N The is no uture o ulic transport , becue travellng by c is so much more convenient .
cars are faster than ubli transrt so cars ar mor convenient thn public transport it is easier , faster n more comortabe espially in lon dstances so gornments should improv ulic transport as not a people have cars
Now a day 's travllig eame asier or the humas to ove all er the word .
Ma of th people habituated to use their on vehicl as their transport , here hy can rech their destinato in time .
In the following paragraphs , I present my viw in th controversial sue .
first , We e having different mos of trnport facilities , whic mong is road transport .
As Automotive Industries are huge in arke , most of the hoe oldes prefe to buy a car rahr than any othr motor vehicle .The can hve asy move from soure to destination with in no tme .
And thee nee t to be deped on the publc transpot of thir joney .
As prvate transport is increasing d by day , it 's surprises that ther may no be ny pbic transpor in up coming days .
Seondly , if the private transpration is rowig fstr , the tafic is also going to create a major poblem , wich effects the lobal warming .
And he incme tha is gttin through ths servicing tasport ll automatcally dopown , which create a problem to the economy of t government .
Ather isue we can s re is unemployment .
Most illiterat people choose thir profciecy as publi transportations like , bu service , b servic , auto service .... t , in order to fu fil their basic needs .
ople with more unemployment y also ed to a cre rate .
I ho , gvng eqal priority fr both public and private transportation kes healthy .
n we can ee tt contollng traffic is n goin out of th hand .
In a times and plces there is alws sm tyical food of th cuntry where we liv .
My name is Laura and I liv in Argentina .
Here , in this counr there are tpicl ishes , desserts , drinks .
oe of them are , roast , mte n se others , but toe are t bs known .
On th one hand , I like to have thng typial in eh cunty , aart from they a deicious , because wen ou 've got the oportuity to travel , you cn go d experience with the food o .
On t othr an , the bad thing abot when thre are so delicious food , it 's ta always you wan to e some typial food of yu country and at the d it 's very bad fo the ody becuse we eat he in excess .
In ten year , they did n't chang that things , because they r delcious and no one would lke to t anythng othr than ost !

Travelling by car is much or convenient but all kno really thee is no future fr public transport .
hn we tk about pblc tranport , here re ma peop d everyone travel but i think we do nt el ela re there nd if we tlk about travelling by c .
It is the bet or mch moe convenient for us .
ecause we cn rave a where bu in public transport we can not travel to n oth tes
I hik ter is a big future for plic transport , because a ot of people wt to take tha and more than aythng else that is convenience .
Esecally some eopl do n't have a ar nd some elderly persons difficult to drving a c by tmselves , so te pulic transpt helping them a lot .
lread public transport have ben improvement n that maes omfortable to go on a tip , b I think that will be ale to becme good quality mor a moe , because so ma pople expectation .
I like a ar as well , u hn I have to diing a cr I ha to think about parkig a l and I ca n't enjoy meeting ter ople to talk while I am having tael , so t public transport is mkin connectio with han beings .
It is why I think pblic transport is reay imortant f public an ter are a o of important ting is having a possble in the futue .
Every Human hs poin of sregth and weakness .
So , the Humns including wme nd me shold behave according to these points .
The question wich is rsig now shoul the mployer hire women in soe pots nd ecludes thm from anothe , ad so tha for n .
There e two answer to this ustion , the first one is to wh sees that it is rig to exclude women om some jobs .
For example , h buier ned physical strength to carry cements and bricks .
Te chanic should have the ability to fford drwbacs of the o .
Th second answer is it is ot corrc to eclue e or woen from any posts .
Te explanation of hse who support e secn anser is every o a orne qual in dtis and rghs .
So there is no one n ire smeone or ge anon a b according to gener .
Is convenient take a year f beween leaving school and starting he niversiy ?
I think it is not necsary and t recomendale because you have the possibility to earn money and is difficlt once ou g used to ean oey , y want to tuy again .
Also , if you wa to tavel , ou ha to make money r that and the , trav .
Furthrmre y do n't study urig this period d hn you an to srt the university you would n't be able to rmember some imortan things
So , if you ak a year off , y have to tink about it .
Peole e public tansport bease of saving money .
But now tey re earning mre money han tey erned before .
Therefore , it is likl to iinent that public transort will no longer exist in future .
thnk has a utre ha l peope e ubic tansport then I tik that maybe continue to have future but has b and good thgs , fo example good is easier to moe in th iy and yu save time , and the bad , a peop attack o d stea tings , but I thng , that have fuure , because a lot peope even hey use public trnsport to .
th people us te ublc transpr also he people needs to move for all the city .
wat I ' m ayng is that if you have futre publ trnport that peole use so ch that y wil ave future
onveniece is t the only one consideration when we are traellng .
A lo of people chice pbli tranport r travelling ecaus it 's chaper , easier , more relaxed an sometimes aser tha driving a r .
In recent year , govrnment encourage people to take public transport bcase of fuel riss .
Se of governmets invest uc money to construct public transport network to mak ravelling by pubc transport mo convenient .
hn driving a ca , we will fa a parking space trouble in a city .
Bsides , a traffic m is anthe roble .
So , I do n't think there is no futue fr public transport .

But it is impornt to eno youself .

At th beginning of ts hisory , my it was a bg farm .
A rive passes by the city and , ocsionally , ther were floods on the place .

Besides , it 's also an environment rolem , exhaust fues engulfed th earth , more car is used , more exhaust gas release , we are killing our motr .
In addition , hoe who ive on below aerag icoms do ot have money to b car .

It 's the wy to prove you wealth , en you gt a car to our home , or go to schol , wk by a c , people will change their mind but you .
Pblic transport is ben become a must - have me with many people who have low - iome .
In concusion , Public transprt is our future means , I ma for almost citizen .

I have rea an article on IFLS talks about a eep as uman face .
It sws in the video that te sheep actall ha big nose nd lips just like human .

Ty say the reson hy he h a huma face is h famer gae is mom an xta dse of Vitain A. As a result , that causes te defrm in his fc .
In my opinion , I thn it is just coincidence tt the sheep looks like hmn .
On t ther hand , the frmer who wns the hee refused to sel the sheep for hghe ric thn ormal to the cirs .
I think the sheep hould be tansfer to a place where is specaly in nimal wth me codition .

Nowadays technolgy is more modern than in h pat an peole alwa dvelping ther invention to become more usel .
We as a human who lv in tese ay , we lie rely on technogy , eery asct of our iv are supporting by technolgy .
An because of tecolgy our lofe becme easier .
One of the example is television , in the past we use it only fo watchig news nd moi , u as t time goes ad e echnolg is developing t , now televison ha others functon .
Teevisin can be used tor many hngs , usually we wat televiion f entertaining , but we can als ue it for educatin too .
hse ae th roofs tt televisio can also educate .
First , televiio h many progrms which e can be used for dcation .
Many ograms consst lsons for kds to lar , for ids wo tll want to earn speaking and know h words , it is very usefl because many programs ar vey suitable for her to help em learn fater by watching telvsion .
Besides ta we can aso us television to ke us becme knowledgeable , by watcin new programs .
Second , tthese ays television become moden an it mk television cn cnneced th internet .
By that advatae , now we can easi search an et informatio fo h internet by using television .
We c search it on browsing or we a ao cces youtube to help us .
So we a watcig a rogam hat we wanted so we can choose what is good n not .
In onlusion , teeveision can ntertain and also educate bcaus television programs make it in intrestin way .
I will talk abot my favorite sport .
My fvourite prt is football I enjoy payig ootball wh my friends we lay at night it was very ecite to play hen e y as rain .
Wen nyon mis to pas the al or mss sore a gal we shouting on hs ac are yo raz w you missed thi goal !
ut we were too intersted .
We ejy watching fotbal match
my favurie sport is football .
I 'm not ood at pying it , if I prefer to play volleyball , t I like to wath e gams .
Th emotions he only tr if y 're a fan of ny team , and yo now e happiness tha ou feel when it wis , it 's indescribable .
Ftbal is usally a sport th appeas primarily to mas , but I 'm a gr ta sometimes I relize that I ow more than sm mes .
I started fllowin football in 2007 , just 10 years l , I started because I fell in oe with a tea tha then ld me to le football in general .
I lie to wat the games at ho with my father , but mostly always go to the stadium with my d , o feel indescrbabe emtion . a my father was to oney tis psion .
Te fure r the plic ransport suld n't be taken lightly , in my opinion , the blic transport is te bst opin for endng the problems with the traff jam because when we se a u or ubwa , a lot of peope is travelng fm e pace at other in only n transport or vehicle .
For an yeas te public ranspot ha allowed tha t peple ravel a long distance for rk that othewse wul not be possible .
Bettr sill the futre of the public tanspor is esential o a beter ife without traffi .
Whn we use te ca , for general , one person is the unique o is acustome to using yr own car , so no is exploitig e potenial of this r .
At th ti , we ned or cars r more people , that 's h mening for more raffic .
it 's f this reson tat I think the public ransport is a great benefit or th sciey , and a go wy fo mo us of the one plac at oer , I sugget that the government has to give mo meas for the purpose of improvng t pubic transport .

Today 's television !
nce yo have in mind by initing oters to get home an watch TV is ha pope expected !
he big deal is entertanig , n quality is part of it .
Keep it in mine ha you shoul do before buing or on dreami TV .
You soul consider that large an bng utouchable TV is at u must id in on .
Hover peope nowadays lok fo a good design a nt o qualty , the bi poblem is tht prize is against qualit , evn thugh a go designing of TV sris on el known stores is the big oton tht we a choose to chek .
Conside a gd prize and gd qality by checking ad visitng stres , o should ot spend too mh money by buying e bigge TV or argest , you can save moey by only watching few minutes on stores , av your s , eoy and list if you ae convinced .
In concluion , ejoy watching movies in yur own TV considerng ries and qualities , some TV rngs yo the experiece to enjoy your favourite movs in other scenery , will o tr ?

In my life , many dreams have exste in my mind , whh is swet , incredible , magcal or horrible .

In my opinin he people ue television or distractin .
When we cm after t o , or schl , we ed a fom to rla .
Maybe sudes we mke otherise ; in search on computers , in books , tc ...
The televisio 's e is tayig or a mre tilzed by h people ; so we ar getting more probles of visi .
It looks le a ki of addicin ... We need to s h technology on or behalf .
The capitalist 's world make us increasinly ecom us updted .

Ther are no apoloizes to be a iformed person .
To go shopping , is ne of these things that yo can love or , like it happen to me , you ca hat at all .

In general , I in it very boring ad stressd .
If I st do it , my faurite ay of hp is h gh street of my town , or in aother twn or country .
The sopping cnres , full of peole n noise , e crazy !
Shopping online is neither , fro my eperience , a go w of hp .
In my ce , I 'm always wron wit the zes and to eturn h poducts , tes me a ong time d a ret effort , so it do n't worth it .
Much better is to tae a ak in the hg teet , and make from thi tim someting for pleasure .
Socializing online hl us to contact with our friens by esy way in different places and ts w cost us ony .
Socializing person doe not cost us moey , but we ne one pae to cnact ac otr .
Finally , we ejy in both ways in o lfe .
F te last ears , the public transport s bn forget .
Nw , pubic transport is not the future , because traveling by a is much more conenient .
The people who do n't use te publi transport , thk that travlling by car is much better .
Bt they do n't kw e b proble ith the polltion .
I think .
If everybody uses the public transport , the world be much betr . d the people ill be stress less , because they wl be no worried about parking places or be in h traffic .
ayb it will be a rally good opportunity f the pepl , being ore ealthy o .
Compared with oca bookstores , publishers or mdia such as newspapers cnidering the Interne maret , public trnsporttion ha uch better future .
The are two resns .
The frst ason is that pulic transportation carries humans .
mans e h most sensitive luggage .
You hae to te vary mh are when you carry umas .
Even thoug people ying to develop dons to rduce lgistic coss , it is difficult to aply t technology to carry humans .
The sond reason is automatic driving tehnlogy needs soe me tme fr h devlopment .
lso , he automatic driving technology is already applied f rans .
e running costs will be decreased .

Fistly , shopping an wate u so much tme .
You may nt reaiz when you shopping happly .

Secondly , sopping can make o upset eause of something you a o afod .
u y come cross smethig , such as luxuy bags , bu o cn t buy it because of t tgt budget .
Furthermore , even you ust buy something you can aford , yu ay also was muh me moy .
So , basd on wht I ave wtten , I thi shoppng is ot always vr hapy . We cn find something much happier han shopping easily .

Hi Isabe
I am lvng in Deia wich is located in Dbi .
It is mal an quite city .
I like te Inda resturnts in e city , in additon infrastructure and rods are well orgaise .
oeyin to the statement aboe , it 's necessary to say tat is a very interesting topic , cause it 's ite related to actua prolems , suh as problems in he environment .
This is to sa ht most prt of cars e not green , namely , curren cars are not designed fr generate a oo mpat in the enviroment .
Regarig th reason for th described situation is due to the strong economic inerest of il compnes wic are intend to e as much money as possible , regardlss of the damage ha they are cauin to pcies of plants ad nimals .
Tus , the questio is , travelling by car is so much or convenient fo wo ?
r multinational myb ?
Or for some onsumers tht n afford a xic d expnsive ar ?
, even though , when the public transpot gets so crowded , is less harmful inded , in terms of e impct received by h environment , becse it ans mre individus in the ame lace , manhile ac n car mans increasingly pollue .
Travellin by would be mr convenient with a good conscence of prtec th planet .
The de of banned cars from he ntre of all ajor cities ave advtages n disadvantage .
The god hing abt ot allow cars in he ciis centres are tha the taffic wll be reced , the trips will be fste and te contaminaion will be less .
On e ter had h bad thngs are tat y have to park out of t city cntre nd these areas will be crowded , ou could n't visit places with your cr d people wit phsica problems could have diffiulties wth public traspot .
In my opinion it is a good idea , but perhaps the restrction could ha excetion f ceain peope a ertai ay nd ous , or if you need to visit a paticular place wih your car you could as for a speial permision .
The village I liv , there is a lt of egetation for that reson we ry to protect envinment , some of he tins we do is to ie mantananc eery week to the vagetation zone chekng if there is any garbage , to avoid this we teach h young 's enviromentalist actions so hey do n't hrow cs , paer , or , ndies to he floor th also can help the oder eople , ther are cases which a perso throws garbage to t sret's , foor or to the vegettin to avoid tha happeng agan we hae a punihmnt that is to pay some money if t do n't they wo nt be lowed to enter the illage pk ad oo again , unless they were vsitrs , in tt case we told him or her the wy we live in e villag and , we give him or e avises to ep a bautiul pac whout grbage .

en whaeer e opiio you e is the result of t social situation in ht o live .
st peopl a tat sig public transport is ette than ung car , and tey say that ts cheaper ad better for e environment , bot me I think that cars is eaier nd affordable way to transport beteen paces , because car is here any ime and so near to you home instead of publ transportatin whch you should take a walk to reach it in most countries , and also cars availabl all the time , you can go at 4 am and no e say anything , because its yours , but most publi rasportation is availabe only for e dy hours an few hours at ngh , in emergenc situation for example , what you wl do , if yo do no ve your own r , your kid is sick , or you wife or yu d parents , n in general e more we dend on orseves h more our government abe to help the verty and hmeles people ot here , who reall need mor help ad aid from he public community , we mery k the goernmet to improv streets an the traffic light sstems , an more i statins and parking in he streets , to be abe to driv and ove easy and safe an in a shor tim .
verone use publc transport every a .
It is difficult to iagin how we can iv withot it .
But in pie of thi a lot of popl have a dream bout a cr .
Te mo sid that ung a c mr convenient ta uig a puli transport .
Of coue rivte transport h a lt of advantages ik : you do n't need to ai for a bus at the stopes or yu cn go evry where u wt in the time convenient for you .

I aw it wih my fami , my children a my husband , we d a ood afternn .
he film is based on a girl , she is invited to ny weddngs in whi she is a mai of hon in all of them .
She ha twuenty seven dresses of mad of honor , meantime , he ca in love with a boy h is er handon , but he is oking in a magain and he has written about wddings in the ciy , he is a good writer , d se unknowns that .
The plot is wll contructed , since e bgining becomes uite grippig .

Unfortnately mn touists do n't take care about saving personal space ( on the iver bank or on th sea beach ) in clan .

In my opinion , firstly , nw bilding on e ank must forbidden at ll .
econdly , rules o tourits about caring enirnment must be very strick .
I thik , nature'll get the most imporan benefits if veybody takes cr about w space in h est way .
When it oes to health , it des coe phyica and menal saus too .
Sports is a uniue a by which a person n mainain his or her health icluing bo spects that are physical and mena .

" The reality of transportation is that it is ftur oriented .
If we 're planni o wat we hae thn we r behind the cure " , Athony Fox .
Transportation as a major rle in a society as life revolves round otion .
We we talk but convenience , comfrt a safety then private transport is mre likel to consider .
In etain emergency cae , running for a bs sems harder than juping up in ur wn ar .
Prvte transot is totally on your own , so hee eains no tension of reachig a certain station on a pecific tm .
Traveling rivately makes one free of te issu as harrament .
Although many transprt providers loo forward to eradicate this problem , yet it remains .
ubli travelling ma troule the assengers due to ncreasig fre .
People often end to go on heir n as priate trnspor such as ca can be bogh easily on lons provided by bans .
Lokin on a wider pn , as ar these day avaable acording to te public deand .
or instne , ful - efficient , luxurious and eonomical car are easily available .
With th dvancement of the automobile industry , public transprt will not be considere as the first coice in the coming yeas .
The abe discussion suggests tt popl id private transport a safer , convenient and comfortable mode of trvelling .
The iy was esrted ta night , as chael nd I wandered thugh he narow streets .

We were gong to se wat happened , n we h omthing to see .

We ry to gave r help but she was so havy d we could no do that . Thn we wr trying to fn el ,

On our lc I d a mobile phoe , but Micael was saing that we need to escae because we did not know are those bullies na the corner .
My pla was to phone my dad and an amblanc an I 've done ha .
Aer we cam to e ambance , police cme and one patrol was catching those man who made that to ta granny a the ote patrol was talking to us .
I found u tat granny ame is Rose and she ha g operation after he acidnt .
To o relief , she a aved and hn we ent to granny room , we saw sle on her face .

I still beliee ha publc transport will be more poplar in e future de to beefits it povide for us . Travelling by ca is ore convenient b expensive .
Travelling pubic is cheaper .
On the other hand , not everybody can own the car .
Pulic tranpot is suitabl f those h have no own car .
esides , pubc transport will reduc traffice jam .
Today , governmet focus on how to imprv public transprt and te so incease thi suporing .
So public transport is proved continuously .
I thik it will be te favourie transportation for al of us .
My favorite spot is volleyball .
Ths sport caus fresh and jolly me d I thn wil exercise cse ealth.if o stt volleyball , you need a ball d pice of ground that separate with ie .

Secondly , if you can no id wht you re looking f , you will not bm with happiness .
Wa is mor , you wi not be satisfied wih the hoppng if o lack money n can n afford to buy the tig which you really want .
To sm up , I wul like to say tht , if yu e in a mood or lck of money hen you wi not be able to feel plesure of it .
Humn lv has change a t in the st years , ad it ems that is wi hpened faster every day , h technology advances and the changes in te way of thinking , are adapting to a dffrent id of peol th each human generation .
Technology dvnce way to fast and it is really difficult guessing what ind of stff or artefacts will be fifty years om now , t we can gues soe ideas like flying cars , smrtphoes with the size of a small papr , laptops rall thin like quarter of inch , cotes that clean telf or change th clr ad hap , ealthier food , smarr electrodomestics .
l th will hel people to liv aily , but only to ae more tim to work , bcase the type of mi that reign tha ie wi focus in te companies nd ak money and spend it , thi is he rean wy a lot of job ae changing to a ome offce and e ims e gvin or a more facilities to their employees to be ore efficie .
At te end , the knd of ve tha we will s in ifty year rom now wl have a lot of suff to hlp the people to have a mre comfortable , easier and faster way of lv , but tis will be only to me mor oney and cosme more an mr , also the ting will be faster of waste to make the people to change their apparel more often ad create a consumerism .

Wat really mkes me to love Barcelon is tht they pay the footbal , instead of them running roun .
The always bring talented player ha will make t cl be re improved tactically.eople always y is;"Bacelona does n't uy plyers"it 's ot ike , they are lackng mony .

I lik this sport since my chidhood becaue I found that I can think aout my good tme when I was chid an relax with myself to think careful abt my prese and futre .

Hi !
I wat to bein with one thng : I do n't hae a favorite pot or soethig on ta , bt I rlly ike to do xercies for my bo .
I think it 's iportnt to maintain our ne d of urse ou halh .
Becaus , we we ratice a sport or some simple exerises we feel ho the bdy receives energy , that it 's hppenng with me .
But we have concrete exampls , whic we should wear follow an wich already demonstted hat nthig it 's iposible .
Le Nadia Comaneci or ca ag , th are two peope which succeeded in their prt t th eseverance and ambito .
he are passionate by tha the do , more ocrete thoe ar fall in love with thir j .
It is an impotat thig to lov and like a lt what we practice , becaus that it 's the key .
Te pleasu and your will wil hep yo to sucee and to get the es scores .
In my point of vew , this subject , t prt , t favorite sport is oe of most pleasnt for me .
I lve to do jokig in the mornin n then to do a lt of xercise or my legs ad arms .
If I do ha , w the day is one of my bst ay , it 's a maaged day for me .
In concluion , I do n't he a faorite sprt , I lie to do a little of ll and I do n't refuse othing .

A good amount of te poulation prefe to uy a car to go to th schoo , wo place , chuch on a faer on coortable y .
Every year thsands of car r sell and the dema is growing .
Probable the only opporunity to change this wll be to remrk on popl the oportuniy to av enrgy and iminis the eviroment contamiatin if we use pubic transportation .

Pollution as a probm in e environmnt
Years ago , pollutin was o a big problemtic to deal with .
Technology ws no as advanced as it is now , so h amont of wste was small .
Or ancestors us to live in a unselfish lie .
owadays , pollution is a plobelmatic that we hav to solve before it ges worse .
A new wy of trnport ut be incuded .
We r used to drivig a ca and we do not notice hw uh damage we cause . We soul start usi n ways of transort as go by bik or by lking .
ot nly il solve pollution , al it will hel us to discard obesit .
We Should include new alternatvs of transport in ur routines .
Riers ad es ar victims of modenization .
We hav no idea of ow mch amge factoie causes to te rivers and seas .
In fact , the factores waste goes to the rivers .
The govrnment hould improv a new l to regularize ths dage .
As we ca see odernization is causing dag in rvers an seas .
In my opinion , Polltion is a problematic on h entire world , n oly in mern counies , so we houl try to reccle or , any kind of hel is necssary .

I pctise Pilates Meth evry Sund ornin .
I like tis sport because it is a simply healt sport that respecs my body .
I practsed anse a long time ago but wh aes , I 've preferred to practise an easier sprt .
I discovered Pilates 2 years o and bga wt a old Bejar dancer .
He took time to eplain each moment and mde me undersandng the concept .
Afe 10 tmes I obtained results on my body : stretch , newy and flexible .
If I coud give dvices to new prctisers of Piates , it shuld be to rd a ook abou his method and to take time hoosing a og teacer .
A few ears previoly I to ar in n prramme name aled Christmas Drama .
In my schl ages I dd t participa an programme evn sports .
ecause school teachers never encourage me to participate .
If te told me to tted omplsory I will do without ay hesition .
Whe I ee in ANDRAPRADESH vey year we have Chrismas function in Decembr althugh we are not interested to aten Drama he were o ave us thout participation even simple character .
They gave me a charactr le TH GOD .Firstly I evr aware about ho at ad do th particular chacter .
A from Octobe to tl December we practise evrday after r tdy hou up to eleven " O"LCK.D BY DAY I learn and fnaly I did my role wll .
Then I think myself y I wased a my scool ys .
Personally I belive tha those who ae nt participate an activity h teachers has hem to ecourae .Then nly the also know how talnted they are .
Evr student should tten nd show thir talent .
Afer sme ages we can t tted any this tpe of actiity because we all are become ol .So let do ad enjoy or yun age be happier .
T future of public transport in develed countries is very dferent , ecause os pele have a car , in the peopl who live in poor countrie , most people tak publi transot , cause people do n't hav a car n is cheaper take public transport , the pollutin of public transport is hg d is gowng hir world countries should ve , o friendly transport .
I did n't use to believe in that people would do everything for advantage , en betraying family and fiends .
I thugt that was nly seen in ilm .
The real worl woul not lke that .
I stongly belived eole would rther hve love in the heart han eerythin .
I ws n't rich , not haing an good things , nly a saple erso , but I lve hapiy .
At least I had a stable b , lover , family nd riend .
However , these things hve changed , All the things I have been onig , building , reaining are bokn .
It is rd to believe my eyes tt I could e t avdity under thei ey , as if thy could n't wi to see me dead , hy ca n't become brilant so long as I am alv .

I am writing this ettr in order to ppy fr the b in the " usa summer cams " .
I s the job advertisement in th lcal newspaper .
To start with , I uld lik to tell u that I have studied gastrnom in the Itituto Crandon , one of t st reognised institutes in Uruguay , aso , I have just finshe e ports a health corse in the Uniersidad de la Republica , in which I earnd to work frm chidrn to adults in t sports ea .
I tink every pople ove sport .
In te world ry amou sot fesival is Olymc .
Tere included ay kind sports sch as wrestling , bsketbal , tennis , running .. etc .
My favourite sports are baketbll and martial art .
First , Basketball is team sport hn it means i ned to understand expression of membes of team and kep onact them or emple my roll is cutter but i need to do asiste , bocker and garding when i play .
Secondly , Evr country have own mrtil art histor n culture th is kungfu fro China , aekwndo from Japan and Karate fr Korea .
It nt ut fighting ese sprt giv peope durability , spee a pwer .
Epecally i like karat a Kn - fu .
Ma n women hose a possibe to intrest it .
There is n seial criteria such a tal and srog mscle or gender .
Tese 2 sports impoving hua basic biity to rech as posile high capabiliy .
I suggested to othr pele irt to undestnd yourself such as what do yu ik , which is possibl nd tn pratie after evr sccss
my favouri port is badminton .
it 's a gam between 2 or 4 people .
he ue a bat a a shttlcock hic is lke a bao featr .
purpose sore ost points .
I sometimes play badminton with my brother , and I always wi .
I think I am go player .
my first ply bamnton when I a 7 years ol .
postivs way or aying badminton : you can lse wght , yu sion il be goo tc
ngatves ways o playing bdinton : ou righ arm is more strg ta you left ar , sometime , yu a sprain your ar .
I 'm ure is very heth or your body .
Acoring to is form , we can kno lerning knowledges takes a part of time in n day .
Unlike Taiwan 's senior high schol students , their sleeping tie average in eight hos even moe .
As for me , my diy schedule do n't have much opton , jus only sudy , seep and oher .
Ohers ilude in rest and exercise , but th do n't occupy ts of time .
In my awareess , I ko United States adoates free - styl study ad lf - learing , so they aside rom stdy , they have diversity selections .
Wen it comes to my sleeping , I only hve four to five hours in a day .
The lake of lep often maks me ca n't concentrate in class .
t mo remind myslf to get up aly , the or things i need to do .
So it usually potpnes my sleepig time .
The ly common option is rs ti , I also sen three to ur hours .
Becau i think famly d fries ar my spirit mdicie , they ca giv me lots of nergy .
First , I am to say that Peol 's ive change in the utre , because e new technologies wl chang the ivs of pole .
I think hs , becuse h e echnologies are craed by people f improving our habits .
For example , Inteet in he next 50 yes will be ery ifferent , I gess that pope will have a ch in our head nd th may do many thins with yo mind ik if we nd to al other people , we wl tin about it and we y speak with it .
For ohr hand , People me other inentions fo imprving the world nd reuce pollution , o example , In his time we have created electrc as or organic food , these things are very useful in future , bcaue we will nd to reuc ollution .
Aso , eople will need to iprove meicin to cre diseases nd for this , Pple need to create mr inventions to resolve thee problems .
Finall , I think tht h bet chae will be in ur lifestyl , We will change our clothes , thinkig a oth thing , We wil be more dependent a we ne mo tigs f or day to day .
Although I ae en having terrible jet lugged since cm back my ountr , It 's great to see my family and my iends .
nyway I have to find a br to develop myself and tk a ret .
I never say goodbye to everyoe because I will come bak England .

Becouse of ha , sometims I feel free to ask em wht I want n depending on the way thy rcive my comments I a st e the do he ak I aked them whout keeping on watching them .
In conclusion I 'd lie to offer my d if anything oud be necessay .

Myth and fable ar always my favrite yps of stories , because they can eithe be easy to understand or xtend deeper mtter .
Sometimes it is interesting to know a stor by discovering their akground fit , is n't it ?
r exame , de to t ide spredin of " The Epic of ilgamsh " , we l hed omthing rlte to it , bt do n't rely know about details .
Amount of taition a legend nwadays somewhat refers its context , such as Homer 's " Odyssey " , te flood mentioned in t ibe , ad espeially Mesopotamian civilization .
Therefore , I t to fnd ut ore information about " The Epic of Gilgamesh " in order to understand it completely .
In conclusin , i hope ht Riyadh cit will be mo interested in traffic jam .
If the governmen gives attetion in improving the strees , decreases using cars , provides other transportation , d controls traffic ja by plce , Riyadh ill ecom a great cit so the people do n't rry about going u .
I hope this roblem will disappear soon .

Television nd her things inented by tecnhology are pat of our lifes .
I thk every family has gt a teevision in n oe d or example I hav 4 televions in mine .

It 's important if we want to know ews of our country or world 's nws .
here are a lt of intersing tv programs were we c lern something and there re as intriging television pogras .
Tese are advntages but we can ve also disadvantages from te .
or example we ca becoe addicted to our television .
It is not he bs thing or ur eyeight nd our helth .
In geeral I think our technogy is not the best thing for our helth ad tv a othe similar things r resonable fr our problm with helth and eyesight .
So teleision h positive and negative asets n it 's up to us h to behae with it .

Huang Ji Hang is locad in poular ditrict in North Jakrta whih many pepe cal it PI .
This is China - based chain tt is rcently opened .
Thi resaurant s ma ward in hina before it opened in Jaart .
T place of Huang Ji Huang is pretty ig if you compared with the other restaurants in PI .
The lac is provided piate rom an karaoke om in one place .
Besides that the pubi rom is also cla n comfortable , ut I recommend you to choose pivate room to supprt our farewell dnne .
Te waite ho wked re are kind and helpful , ty serve the customers kinly and alws exlain the eu clearly , they are capable make their customer satsfie with te serve .
Huag ji hng specialized in the sew pots menu , which will ke you to eno an atentic Chinese food .
Yu can rdr packages menu that Huang Ji Huan fferd or you can als choose the ingredients th you ant fr yur stew pot but you must choose 3 until 5 ingredients .
uang Ji Hug hs 5 kin of auce which ca give ou stw pot become asteful , and one of te is Ma Sauc .
Mala auce is a spicy flaor and it is very uthentic and u wil rarely fin this taste in ather restaurant .
But if y do not ie spicy yu a also try the Honey Sauce .
Ater all the food is very tempted to try a te size portion is bi eough to share with 3 or 4 peopl .
The pce is ceap if ou copre it with h service n taste from te fod .
Hvin farewl dinner er is wot th money .
Every moth Huang Ji ung always make a special ffe from thir cutomr , and for this month Huang Ji Hun wil give 20% dscount r customer wo spd 00 IR above , for a complete inormatij you a chec it on e wesite or call he estaurant .
And I highly recommend you to make a reservation first if y decided to hold our dinner her , because hi place is always rowded a we also nee a ivate rom .
I use ll of te things excpt two .
I i n't ve the Internet when I was chi .
Ad alo we could n't choose proramms .
I playd in the sret and wled to shool alone .
I'm thinkig what kind if things wre more dangerous for me?It a so dngeous when my friends and I am in the Tobol iver .
We jmped it te ater and cught cryfish .
When I remembr that moment I am exiting .
I guess verycild want to invstiate he world .
We hae to help them , to show and explain .
Wht kind of risks they c get if to do that .
Nucla energy is on of most important soure to generate enrgy and he fo te peop in the wld .
The countris diurnal attepts to devlo e industry of nuclear to prduc more power .
Tre are ay vews of using the nuclear power .
Sm peole guess the nucear power h a reat vlu to prouc power instead of the fossil els uch as : cols and oil which are Nt reneabl energy .
Moreve , the think tht contollig the pollution is possile .
Whereas .
The serious ide of e nucer powe is the dngerous weapns ta the countries ry to own , threat h pace in the wrld .
These kinds of epons do not kil one or tn but desty a large town completely .
In my opinion uig h nlear per is imortant th the geat deelopment in te humans li.the countries hav to establish this eergy an oter soures to secure te powe for people .

My favorte wy to ravel is by plane beuse you are qicky in anothe country .
By play y rarely have probems wit your lgage .
By tain you d n't will hav always place r your luggage .
By lne you can gie our luggage at th chek - in or y can take he hnd lugge with yu . yo an be lwys sure that ou will ind a place for your luggage .
Another reason y travel by plane is my favorit is becuse it is mre comfortble to sleep exet o ve a loud person cse to you .
Tat can be annoyand .
I think trae by boat is oe of the bddest ways to travel hen ou are seaick .
Ten ou ms travel by tain or by plan .

Some people think that the footbal is a bad thing because the footballer ae l stpi and the fas are l violent n disrespectful , bt it is n't lie it .

I thik almost everyone loves pks because a lot of people go to the park and having lunch , picnic , excersis , np tc .

My day in London
I went to London in April .
It w pretty warm .
My famiy n I gt a grt feling as we landed in Lonon .
We sa a lt of sights like the Big Ben , which is th biggest clock in h wld d h Lndon Ee .
To t to t ig en we ok the underground , but to e to the London ye a d bu .
After 3 dy we en me .
I forgot to tell ou smethng about homels eple .
A lot of eople are homeles , which is sad , bu mabe we n change it .
Spor is very imporant or every o .
Od n yug are bnefit fm sports .
My fvourite sport is volleyball .
I like it very mh . I rctise it in the club .
I pl it with my compaion .
It make my ody healty an strong .
hn ou score alot of points , yu will wi t mth .
Gearly sports is growing or mind continously .
I practise it with my fiends .
I ejoy playing it alon or with my freds .
my parents always sppot me to ply what like d
enjoy .
It ae me lose weight easily wthut dig ny fort .
I do n't ind y dificuty in oing it .
My favourite sport is basketball .
Usually I on play basketball in school .
We lay by teams or each one ale .
Of cors we do n't hve 2 million bals for ech student no we sare with ech other .
Als , nt all the school play in one time no eer section ae time to play in .
In chool I always play ih friend never played alone and alway my friends and I wins .
Last time I played whe wo 14 by 5 .
do o no do I enjoy my ort I will tell you h because hn you pla you hve fun and interested .
My advice fo peope who is staring this sprt is to repeat paying until thy g it .
My favourite soap opera is " Friends " . I emember to watching it at hme at the g of tweve and laghin ou lu wit my bothr .
I stil atch it on Satrdys a I really eny it !
My favoutite character is Joe , wh is a sil inocet man .
He live wth Chandler , opposte onia and Rahe 's flt .
It is vry difficult to deny e importance of famiy in our life , definitely families pay an essential ro communty structur .Accordig to the xpers we ca n't create successful society ihout creative families , d one nothe specific part of your lf is a go partners surrouding yo daily activitie .
One of the an advantage of family is the recogniton you have been gien in specific ae , children require special attention to grow up el , and tat can only be given by aily .o ntance , homless children e mr likly to fail in thir education , job nd adapt to siety .
Conseuentl , hey probably fi to experience fo hir live .
Moreover , families te an essential rt in protect ther membrs from ad atmosphere , a it probbl reflect on hei perfomnce twar country .leading to effictive , creative ad useful vilians .
t last film I wchd w " the oders " by it is a hrro / suspense movi , I as raly scared .
It is abot a aily ( te mother and er wo children nichlas nd ne ) , t mothe is azy and thns h children are allergic to the lighi general .
so the dd n't come outside in the day , and in a room it could not be re than a cade at a tme , it hd to be alwas dark in e house .
Strane tngs happe in e houe , the r " intuders " in th houe , anne saw many time someone alled victor who " play 's "
and t othr thinks she is leig bu after a while she believe e ad stted searching r h inruders .
At te end theitruders turn o to be ghosts ht

ubli transportation
I thi owdays is ore ommo that people e their car for teir rmal acvities , bu he statmnt ht there ir no future for ubic transportation it is not completely true , I thin ta a lot of pple us public transportation because it is cheaper ad some people do n't have engh oney to buy a r .
Another reason is th here in Meco , in some cities yo ca n't use your car in specific ys , so if you do no ave nother car , yo have to s public transportation .
Wel , my college has been prove an organzaton called Enactus .
I 'm a member on it and t oa that improve the psitivit of r scity by settin projects serves many people who ally nes our hel .
So , we actually done 8 projects since i came in and i had a god feeling through helpi oter people .
we interned 2 national Copetitions in 2 yars an wn scod place on one of or projects and gaie 2 leags on her oe .
we ade r univeriy prud plus heping people .
N , we ae or 180 mmbes in thi organation an geting inrease .
We ee re of tis organization cross the worl a there is a o of tdents ready for hel n wishing or a chae to make ou sociy a eter place .
Nowadays , Ways of live he beig Changing in may aspects .
oes hy , is asy to believe tha if ting contie wh this rhtm an transforming everything , in a cloer future of 50 years everything is gn na be completely kne nd dfferent .
In e past , people were used to live th insan wihot conernng abot h future .
Lis of verybody were the same and jst om of them thought tha what the er oing in that oment would hve cnsequenes in he futu .
o that , everytin we ind of similar and static for mn yers .
B the industrilization comes and wi that , the techology , so was of lie 's started to change a eveythng str to go faer .
As I od you before bcaus of t technolog man ings a bcome be in lss me , and with e pass of the yeas this tnd to ncrease .
F example , sharing nowledge an experiences allows tat everybody n do or apl thin and develops faster .
Also allows tha researches a be share easl or for exmple you cn ge nformation about envirnmental problems th can affect you as we 'll so o an react faser d mak som chages .
Aother examle of why ves e gon na changed cometely in 50 years is because aso that connectio etwee others cultures make Peop conce mre aot h own healh , the expectations of lif and the wy they want to ie it , because verday will be easier to see hw ch are we heating the ear so we wl see faste the impacts that his brings to o ife .
As a relt we wil be need to change at , to t to fix what we broke and sta to rebuild in order to hv tht futur or health hat we dream of .
Least but no lss , family perception , has bein changed and o tht tme everythig wll be different because wil be t efec of e decsons that women are ming right now about aving kinds .
Te e teding to work as much as en 's , so is ar to have tme for biding a fail or ven som times is ha to , hinking about getting married .
So tht , maybe wold n't be young fore orker in 50 yars and peple will send l their ti an money in their hobbies , sprts , sf ca and traveling .

puic transport is used by mny eple around the word , includng me .
Soe public transports as trains do no contaminate as cas or moorbies .
May people aid tt public trasport is nt confortable , that s te , fo my int of view bus is not so unconfortle .
Many eopl like going by car , b it pollue a ot more than goi by pubic transr.public transport is chape than buying a car or motorbike , it als contamiate ls than these .
Pblic tranport is also sed by childens like me who wat to go to shoo , high chool or to he univerity .
Finally , I think public transport has a ry good fuue , because it has very good advantages t so oe little disadvantages , it 's also very usefull fo some eople .
In my opinin public transport souldn't dissapear .

FILM : LUCY ( 2014 )
The plot of tis flm is about a 25 naive woan that was lvig d studying in Twan and n nght nt t for clubbing nd met a nute guy that nolved her in a sey drug smuggling isu wth a Corean criminal band that forced her to be a le rug .
A new subtance , caled CPH4 , bound to be distributed aoun Eroe d t Unted States by whc plent bag a et into her stomach having an illegal clincal sugry .
But everything became ou of control for the criminals wn o of hr captor kcked on hr admen , the substac spilles throgh her body n he bgin to experience a different stte of consciousness in which he dizzily enhanced her IQ from 2% to almst 100% of his cpacity .
During this time h ontacs Samuel rma , D Professor of University , to ask him what happens if a erso eache the 00% of h enal activiy or IQ .
She 'll en up knowing te aswr .
It is a gripping il , starng by carlett Johano and Morgan Freeman in a quite good playing , tt wi yo keep tns unl the lat cene a does n't eave u feel nasible .
Nowadays people are ung w car instead of pbic transport , this effect is more obvious in i citi where te price of publ tanspor cost more than small cities .
Pople a getting used to dve with their own ar , it provides more confortability , ad is ore pratical .
You can ue it whenever o wn , nd it 's o necessary ake a long queues at metro or bus stations .
he government a oppoin to invest in public infraesructures , bease he beneits are lower evey year .
Ty are preferring to inst in publc roads and motorways .
The impact of this fct as a hge consequences in the climate effect , in the futre t global pollutin wil increase accoring to the lvel of he cars .
Te travelling by car it 's ry ba .
With he public ransport we protected te environmet .
The pollutes it 's a global pobem .
If we will travl by car hve more pollte tt with pubi transpot .
Oherise , the public transport pollutes less tha th car but the ca it 's very comfortable an no be hou hrd .
With th ar I fee more free as I do n't depend to other people for move to the ste .
I eliev that in he futu all transpot wil be with the ubli transport or les with massive tranport .
The aual system is not posibl stand lo time .
Recently I s the trailer of the ilm about vampire .
h film is lled ' The Vampre Diaries ' .
It is about o n and on woman .
The girl is 18 years old ad men ( as it lar turs out ) are vampes and they have er 0 ears .
O of vampires ecdes to return to hh schol .
There he meets a il .
He fls in le in her .
They are togeter .
Ten there is e older brother of the boy ( vmpir ) and also fas in love in her .
Al the action takes place in ystc Fall .
This trailer I like and I think that the film would be co .
Pet ooke at hi watch an nw that he had to do something immeiately .
He had to u a present o his girlfriend 's birthday but it was Sundy ad all stoes were cosed so he h to oud a solion .
A few our , he w walki by a gare , and suddenly , he aw te mos beauiful lwers tat he hs eve seen , so he picked them up .
Howeer , flowers wer n't enough so he eided to thi in anythg el .
Several hour ater , he foun an open sweet shop a he bught som bonbons fr hr .
inally , he had found the present an before the end of t y he ran quickly to his grfriend 's hos .
If you do n't wa to pass this situation , you must always do ting with tm .
In my thuths , i have the opinion t pubic transport is etter to the enviroment because going in th pbli transport reduce the C2 emission nd ake out traffc rom te streets .
Reducing the rush hours in t main hours case a C2 reuction in the air .
it is a rue statement but cars , traelling by cr is so much moe connient and th w tenologies apply to the
People should take ess fast oo and do regular exerises fr antaining a hgealthy ie .

Univerity euation is od for h students but they also need to len industry specfic skills .
Students , for eampl learn my theories , which may o be requid at their lace of work .
New skils like analytics and ata management ar in dean .
In my opinion , what is excted is a ne role or techers but not tei disappearance frm classrooms .
At uiversty leel , availability of IT training , software an manuals prvid an evr accessile source of information , that otherwise wou ot be at hand .
Fo example , India hs hg re of unemployment , hner , poverty which leads to an immens embrassment of bng Indian .
Nwaday interne represnts the whe knowedge that peple have colected over h centures .
So it provdes a ot of interesting information , o of which ae abut how works different ahines ht a be ound at ww.howsuffwoks.co .
Also ' internet ' in ur days helps to gt information all over e wld , ad if you wih to et involved the go to he ww.b.co.uk.These ies re free way to find most adequate ifrmation about actual evnt both in socit ad technical lf .
One d i decide o b ew par .
hn i w arrvd at hoe , i w started to rea e ews paper , so i found from hee The Intenational Student Maazine have to ranize a sor story copetition , and I ecde to cal Mihae to tell hm abut thi contst .
Mihal a told me he wa knew abot ti cotet and at tt mment he wat to call me to ask , if I am able to came with him at ht contest .
After I decided to go ith i at the contet , I was thinking to go at tat const et yar to participate and win that contest , so this year I w wondering h is the program .
When we were arived here , t emotions starte to ppar so defintel it was ti to drnk a ot coffee , befoe the contest is sared .
I a woderng if Michae pss tat exam .
I s waiting for Mihae less en an hour , so I tared to have a lot of emotions .
After Michael was open the dor fr th classroom , I ws sw in s eye soething stran .
Michael close the dor and knew at tha moment he had ad a mistake .
The orbell rang .
When I opne the dr imagine my surprised by wa I a .
It was awesome !
O Drection a in fot of my do !
I could n't believe in my eyes ...
It was werd that Niall wa missing .
Thn , I asked them why he was n't ih te an the told me : " We are on o to in Aeria nd were singin at our conert in Ne Yk City .
When we came back in our dessng oom , " Golem " waited fr us .
" Glm " as we ll know , ae aical cretures , mad fom md a havig black ocs for h eyes , which n be brought to if by a incantation .
So , we were trying to save time til we managed to escape , but Niall id n't make it to escape , as they cauht im en he sumbed and fe own .
Now , " lem " hol m hostage in their cave , whih is hidden somewhere in Los Angls . "
I looked at them tring to think of smethig to do ad hen I said : " Come on boys , WE e goi to SAE Niall ! ! ! ! "
We took al we needed and tated th sarhing for ial ... We wet in l aes in Ls ngles , ut we cold n't found tm .
Oe nht , which we were leping in our car , by mistake the cr sarte to ove and we oke up in a hue cave , out of Ls Anles .

Then , we ot t of our car n save Niall , fer we ere fhting it " Golem " and came back home .
Recently , an incresing numer of eopl try to tvel by ca fr convenient .
In my opinin , puli transot will sll est in the society .
There are tree an reaons f spportng my dea .
Firsy , r e lo - ditanc , the car is ot as convenient as aiprt .
or example , if o go to anoter city by cr , you y spent more than two day on te wy .
On the cotrary , airprt jst co our tw hours , and ou ca go to your destinain .
The time spending of taking airport is low than takng car .
Secondly , consuming car is not a ormal tig for part of developing or undeveloped cutry .
h fe of buying car ad ful l is expensive or oor people .
Thus , it is important to s public transport becaus it is ch chepr hn private car , an everyone can consume .
Trdly , h global warming is a serius issue for human o lie in t arth .
A polution is the main causes o global rming .
The great numbe of using prvate car leads to higher level of i pollution , an th pubic transport is one of he best solutions fo decreasg the air pollution .
To m up , there ae numerous benefits to use public transport , ad it wil t disappear .
Nowadays pulic transportation is inlued alost a around the planet , We can dmit that te transport reolution a be plave in the st century but due to th globaliaion d technological development , the ransort sector is alay in a continuos transformation :
In th her hd we ut remarque how the ane ecor has en grown , curenty is t mo comon ay of transport for going away n tha 's lo means th the shipping factory has decreaced deeply , in ore to e th plane mart blomm .
Taling about lcal transprt , we have a t of choisses like cars , motorbikes , busses , train ut ls as we were taking aout , planes .
According to the nforation dnne , the mot used is the ar thus mt of te families has one , b the public transportation is getting more and ore como for ose ones who wan to preserv the plane and develop other alternatives more respectful with the plnet .
As we were tlkng , the ew ecologic moemen is ery me moe poerful nd charismatic , due to that , bikes are aso increasing their rl in he nw ae , there are ls linked to the new fashion w to be hipster .
In conclusion , we are assising to a new tend in transor , ery time , they ar faster d more evloper , wi h latest tchnoogy included u at he oppossite ae , we find alo a cotradiction , as we fod an other trend for the tradctional trasport which avid the pollution in order to respct th Eart
I agee tat communiting by car is easier and fatr than ot of h public transportaion ; howeer , her are seious problems come after it ; t amount of hicles on he roads kep ncrase and mak congestion n pollution hih re fa more severe than h inconvenience causing by public transportation .
Ths , I hik th future f pubic transpotation will be more proferous .

publ transport as a b ol in ransportation specially in large cities like Capital city of countries , sig h ca som times causs trffi m if l pern uses their own car , to avoid ths a good roadways is needed , ls e ct of public transportation is loe than pivate tranportation .
on the other hand , public transportatio kes more time to get to h reuired sation , becaue already public transport takin ong path to go acrs more places and as more as peopls tae beefis fo it , a public ransport usually rowed and do not be on tme .
for that easo usin n car is ore comfortable than public transport , you can trvl when ever o ike and whee ever yu want .
finally , in the ne future most peoples will be uing eir own car , because it saves mu ime as coparing ih public tansport n time faor will be more expenie in the future .

H exited student began coming to hir home wth such work , since the hd only 4 day to perform her dties .
After 4 days all came it spectaculr pictues , portraits of people , lrge sculptures , to a student , her name as Sandr , sh arrive ith a piece of crumpled paper , ld in which only had a nae wrtten in a style different letter , ony hee reflected , exposing h moment everyone laughed at her fr her wor , but e teacher said :
Art is complex , and seeing hat everyone lughed wih te work of his partner , can see that nobody undrtood the real meaning , ince t is diffent for eac perso , each creaes a different definition , so we must repec each of them understand that ah person is a different world and everyone is rt .
A stdent tt relly movd him , and reflect so pologetic , and out of te rom , cled te oo and Michael knew then ta he had de a mistke .

Hello to every bo ! !
Now I 'm going to alk abot he benefis o learning noher language .
I am from spain so my foegn language is Spanish
I start to study another language when I w a child , I statd learning Engis becuse every o said that English is the future lnguage , whn I finised my school time I tried to stdy French b it as so diicult or me .
I have to say that study nother anguge give you more opportunities because on the ds ou ed to n othe lnguage to look for a work and be oe inteiget th your college to take te wk and that 's grat .
Ad to day is necessar becuse if o an to trave around the world a mt pople and have convrsation with their o need to now mor than your foreign languag , becaus in he rest of the world and particularl in Europe people now oe than two language and th great .
I think learning other language never have dawbacks because all yu lern is go for you and you min , ou never top to now new tings .
These days , most of the eopl el comfortable to trvl rough car nd then they believe ha pblic transort is t going to be sustain or onge ti .
However I do n agree wih them because in most part of he wrl mass transport system is still popula ad they a nvironent friendly ad cost efficient .
Firstly , ubli bus service is very popular in most part of the wod .
In most part of the Euope , pople still prefer public bus nsead of car to tavel .
Secondly , pblic ransprt r environmentally soud in comparison to priae vhile .
It carries more people whil prvate veicle carries fer pope .
Public bus do t let more cars to contaminae envronmen .
inally , Public transprt 's cot efficent .
People eed to spen or money on fuel if tey wa to trael sa destintion by private vecle .
In conclusion , althoug c is convenient to travel , it is not ough to finish te future of public transportation .
In he towns of th future , the car of t nvironment is on of t most important thing .
eole have conciencied tmselves ta we need to respc te natue and the uman places where we lve .
Human beings hav dstroyed our evronment long the te an now , the eat is in daner .

Military ervice is the military training hich need eopl ave to jin army or voluntary o a prod of time .
In Krean , people shold completed military service at lst 2 years .
Similarly , eople hav to join it 1 yr in aian .
It is a debate tha shoud everyone have to complete military serice when they rech 18 years od .
With supporters maintaining tt it is important f national secrity a make eople maturity , ilst oppnent clim that the iltary serice have ffcts on stu and soud av freedom of choice .
Frsly , every contrie acquire stabilization mus be protecte by a stronger armed forces r national security .
If h r or oher dangerous thrat te safety of ountry , th cn o get help from oher countris mmediately .
Therefe , eole acpt military servc could be easier to protect thir county .
Especially some mal population of counry have olicy tha is peple nd join military service due to deelop into a powerful countr .
Secondly , e important f people become atuity wen hey complete mlitary service , whi proably is a partiulr experience fo 18 yeas old .
In additin to have hard physicl tainng d get dferent special skil , people also can impov personal quality in military rvice .
Consequntly , people could be more independent and strong , th eems to earlie ecome mature than other people wo do o completed mlitar service .
In contrast , oponets of miitary service point u that sty is te firt vitl hng o pepe who reach 18 yer od .
Military seice miny to improve phyicl , oweve stu might be coplete better in scho at e age because it a professional teacher te an a good study atmosphere , pepl usuall easie to cncetrate on earning knoldge .
For instance , some countries allowed eople in military servce fte thei all courses was finised .
Aditionaly , critics arge that countries r bl to allow pepl have fredom of coce for military ervce .
Reatively some people unwilling ji militay srvie , people volunteered in a mlitar servc possibly njoy it .
Furhemore , it lo can respect for righ s of people , especially fr women who do nt cn adapt e ha training .
In conclusin , it an be concluded that military service is necessary for national scuity and goo for people improe themselves .
T best course of action wod be govermnt attept to allow peope volunteered in conscription when they complete their stdis .

C a TV pgramme e to entertain and eucate at te sme ie ?
Nowadays , it is the most important challenge for television .
People complaint about how te informatn but differnt TV shows do n't contrbte in e process of lerning , that 's h an of This programmes e considered rash , bcaus of t multples sows su as realities , tak shos , or showbiz that hrdy ev ae a good mesag or something ntereting o peopl .
A gd example of this shows are ho people a paid to c in elities or ta sw where they sh exaggeated or ilarios familiar problems , where te oy m is to e or audience .
Anothe good example are h edess showbiz tht are appard rcenly , ts ty of pgrams whe th information is oen gossp abot ersonal life of famous sings and actos without taking to con if they re te or n .
It 's a iy to knw that eis just a few programs tha r to edcate pple wit the ms update informaon through documentaries , investigations , cultural or opinion programs , which in my opinion help to acqire more knowledge .
Knowledge that sometimes ar nnown even though it is part of the general culture or proper of th history of our country .
I think in h fuure do n't exist pblic transport because we will die their car .
When yu drive yu wn trsport , a c fo example , o going to fom a specficly pace but in a bus ou go to the bus stop and no to your hus or shool , ok ...
It is bete frm the people be more comfortable becuse you drive an n e othr person . I know so people , he drivers , egn hae't got work , bu the public transport is free and is free because it is th govrnmnt pay , this moey bacme do to ae mor work o others .
No ll is good some people haven't t moy ca n't go to another place to aothe pla ad the polltion became more and more , it is a serious problem ad the solution is oy for t rh peope , te solution is buy an electr a , e ohr solution , mor economic , is h government give the moe to e popuation to buy an eectric r .
I do n't know wht is bete no pblc transport or public transport .
There is no future r pulic transport ince eerybdy preer to e hir on ar .
o time is valuable f ever dy nobody botheed about oey .
tafic is ve hig in n ays so it will be difficult to each office on time .
public ransprt is always crowd so it is ot comfor to tavl

I would ignore thriller films due to my ragil het , ut my mind is caged nw after watching this ilm .
The lm is entitled " Scary ovie " whh is dieced by Keenen Ivoy ayns .
This stry was hown a mrdr o copleed th misso : killed everyn that he hated .
At st , ony one perso could be alive even those acrified ad tried to eape this horribe result .
hs is a cmbined stor of horror ad coedy .
I can no in a word to decribe this film esiy , wha c I say is you will be regret if you ms this fim .
Thi first raso is al actrs shown hir talet in this film drectly an udienc c follow their steps a he tory certinly , ths essential element whch aso maes a bi success to the fim .
Besides , th attractive sto le ake a lot of climax so tha everyone can finish this flm ro the beginning to h ed ad create h billion box office to this film .
owever , I tik the tools shud be improved , such as killer 's ife ad actors'ctumes , the knife look like as brittle as a handicraft , I believe those are seconded - handed cohing . I think this is a pity to this mov .
At last , your bavey can be imroved after watchg this film .

The gaph givn sho e seaonal ses of ice - crea from two lacs at an Engihl seaside reort from 2012 to 24 , they ae separately an ce - ream van ad an indoor public swnmmng poo .
As e gah indicates , h als at ice - cream van was gnerally larger than tt at indoor swimming poor .
F the ice - cream a , it saled st in Jul - Sep each yar , nearl rechd 5000 dollars and it w stil sligtly increasing yar by yea .

F indoor swimming po , is sales did n't ave arge changes , suall ale abou 2000 - 3000 ollars fr each season .
It usually saled os in Apr - Jn and ct - Dc n slidd to the bottm in u - p .
In general , its ses were falling with e time went by .
There was a nice sping orning .

Despite , rvelling by public transpot can be a btter tion in so ay cases .
Cerainl citie will be crowded in he future because opulation is awas increasing .
Using our n car to go to the citycentre culd be a nightmare , it wuld be a stressful waste of tm .

In contrat , there will be cheae alternatives as s , train or vn lane fr on dtances .
In other hand , many drivers enjoy travellig by is vehice because hy li to dve d hey fee free .
Finally goerments and ociety ae concerned about the environment nd I csider tt the wll dereae evels of pollution nd co2 emtios .
From my oint of vew public transport will not disappear even if rs are much or comfrtable , fater and ore evolved than ow .
Te is prcous .
Eery one ca n't deny that tm is a bi ctor in our lif .

The worl is changing around .
Techolgies are moving on in hh sped .
As he technologies world is moving fast nd h auto moble instry is als coming it n ariant of cars & scooters in very eonomial way .
Buying cars and soters are oe conenient tha he las decade .
In w decade people earnings and lvin syle he als chaged .
People now bying cars n scotes as er their cnvenience nd poket .
Earlier people used to bses , txe , autos for reaching office , scools , colleges , spping ec .
Which ws time consuming an obliviously cheaper way of comutin from one place to other .
Sice today worlds is tme saving wol hence people do n't are bout hei ockt .
Using pronal veihice is more convenient to the than using public transport .
So th public trasports importane is reducing evry day .
If it so ther will a me hen igle eople will not interested for pblc transport .
This ha tremendous impact on other aspect .
uel consumption has increased in few years .
Net of ar nd bikes is reason for avy raffi jam ery ide .
Rato of road accidents hs een increased in fw decades .
People not ev care about safey parameters while driing on road .
I us ay that ubic transport is ife line in oay worlds .
PUBLIC TANSPORT
Pubc transprt is a very usful resource , y ca trave without polluting te atmopere n it is very chap .
But , why it ill disappear ?
Noadays , we usually travel ey ften to an diffren places , so for us is mor cmfortabl our cars , t for th tmospere n for our allets , it is n't .
Uing public trnsprt we wll avoid trafic and so mny acidnts , so why we do n't us it mre ?
It wll be a ret advnce for pole and for the tmosphere , a as well for the ontries because we will sae a lot of money
I recomed u to use pubic transport .
I think ta family 's members cod n't be fiends because the relation is ry different .
Thr are mn good reasns to sy tht .
Firty , family is the se of the relatiships .
Sondly , althug the friendship an le are the most important feelings , h family strucures te person and influences their behavior .
I fee my amly in a different wa from my friends .
Alhugh I have a good relationship wit my parents , I could n't think te like friends .
Some people hink that ti is posile but I dsagree becaue it cofues roles in th family .
h parents he to give ducaion to the chlden oer obviousy love

No one can eny th mportane of the public transport , but actually tis importance is turn to private sector ranspot .
Ad this imporance of private transport because prite transportation provide a comfortable mean to move from one lac to another , also it is he to eep a time and reduce costs which spendin in public tansportaion .

Secondly , it is a good y of traveling or moving from one place to another thout wasting a time in waiting a specfic time to me or en waste a tim in ating a pubi transportation to reach a point it hold ge it , ut in the oth side wh u have your own transport or a private transport is get a righ to choose im of ip or he yo wan to move or stay , and nowadays we cn not ste ou tm in taking public transport .
finall , a pblic traspot need more costs , because public transort ( ch a ses , train ) fe every yea is incresing , a ti problem we do not fae it by private transport ,

I tnk that public transport is uc bter fr e enviromment than he private .
If te pele travelle more ofen in public ansport we ould n't pollute so uh .
I think at ublic transport is the ftre because many cotries wl have to allow the entrance in their twns to private cars for stop th C2 emissios to t atmosphere in rdr to protect the planet and te heth of ter citizens .
So I do not age wth tis afirmation , in mi opiin travelll by car is uh mor xpensive and harmfl to the envrnment ta pbic tanspot .

My favouite sprt is running .
I run veryday .
When I was running , I feel relax on it .

Therefor , runin can let me feel happy .
In the as , cars a only affordable f te ppr level while for the mdle cls and lower thre are not many choice for them beside al and public transportation .
Since technology and standard of living are improved , may people left e traditional ait in usg public transportation and choosing c for several reasons .
The fit one is to preseve time .
As we kow public transportation has ot a diect a to fulfill u all destinations ten it force us to so in many stations first , moreover we should tae the othr on to reach our dstination so it is alredy obvious why usig a car is better .
Secondly , blic tranportation usually very rowed and mak us o fe safe since here is an oortunity fo us to be eft .
Thn by car we a enjoy th sceny , share laugh , chnge our destination by uden and many ore .
o these reasons , it can nt be dubted if people tin a ca is more comfortable to be used rathr ha pubi transprtation .
nce cars are affordable nowada , a family ca have more than one that make the umber of car growing rpily but thy do not tik furthr aout he negative side fects ta a car has .
Firstly , it leadng us to global warng since th concntration of pollution a hihe in ny countries , morover actally it is not ol leadg but also make gloa warming ater and lso can threat our health .
Then roads re ore crowdd right now a there are so ma traffis so people wasted longer time in the road , hen it maks one of h postie points of using a car is gone and the importance of pubic transportation is needed .
hie in the statement is wrien hat public transportation will be left by mn people , in my opinion is the pposte ht puic tranporation is u future .
It can be proved by now hat th willingness of peple to us public transportation is higher , beside it is not as costl as usg a car , e qulity of public ransportaton are iproved so cizen have no worry using it .

My Life in Univerity
T le in university hve a o of difficult a inerestng things .
Of course , everything always have w - faced .
When I live in niverity , my ie ha become change a o of .
Firstly , studying is very difficult because ou have to accept new ways of tudyng- studying by myself .
In addiion , my major is English so teachers wi teah and explain by Eglish , whic I ca n't catch up on lesons well in the firt ime .
I was ver incnfidnt out myself ad i ca n't make friends well so I think that it 's too difficult to sk teachers or friends .
I alwys try to fid ou reans which take a l of time .
Meover , I need to improv my skills ch as reading , istening , wrting , nd speaking , th hel me to catch up on my teachr ' s lsso .
Secondly , sudyig in university , I hve to li r rm ouse whic make me be homeik , sa , nd worried I hav to live in ormitory with any strange iends , the 're ver noiy ad I ha to shar my roo with my roommates .
It 's n convenient .
Eveyda , I he to clean or ro , wash clothes , I must te a lot of tme to finish everything befo I star learning .

However , life 's university ve many convniencs .
Living alone , I have to manage money wel .
Befre I wnt to py money for smething , I alwas think caefull that I 'm really necessary or nt .
metimes , I broke up nary and I was really worre so I have to pay oey suitably .
Wh I living lne , I have to sve oney becus ere ae many situations which I have to slove without fmil , nd y can becom a go person with mn good characters such as confident , independent , riedly .
Bcaus my family always prepred everything f me wen I lied wt them so it 's very difficul to be indpendent .
But tday , I have to do it , I ave to solve my poblem , mana money , as cothes by myself .
In addition , I can be confident becas teachers requir veybody in cas hae to stan in fon of class and sak Englsh .
Living alone you have to ke friends when yo 're sad .

Thee ae any accidentally prblem encountered by nternational students studying in Australi .
It is believe hat the ot imortant one of th robem is culture brrie .
Because of different culture backround , the talking sye of interaional sudnts wh ome rom ifferent counris r rious .
Meanwhile , diferen countris have different ules .
For example , pepe always wal on the righ of the roa in Chn .However , Autralian 's rule specfy citze rve on th left of te road .
Secondly , lnliness would be a bi problem when a pson wh lve thir n country getin away from amiy members d cls friends .
Thirdly , students ca n't be accustmed to western eating habits like burgers , pizza nd bed .Acrding to the unfamiiar enironment sudents m lac he sense of security .
hee will ealuat viable solutions to the poblem .
h most imorant way is that individuals hould partipate in student activities wch held by e students fo he same natioalit so that he may not feel lonely .At the same time they can ao actely comunicate wit loca students to acquire more information about Autraia culture in oder to si quickly .

I can nt agree wih t stment of " no future f public transport " provided ht the pemis is " travelling by c is or convenient " .
Firt of a , the pubic transport is more rather convenient than irvate cr .
The subway reches most pat of te Lonon , ad people n travel may lacs .
The accessibity is not jus improving unergrund , t also on th ground an bridging .
Theefore , ubic tansport will have a rlliant future .
he environment is becoming a more and moe burnng issue , especially fom many yars to nowadays .
hat 's becse pollution as now reahe critical levels n that 's why we must take it under control and sve it .
We alrady no that a gra part of the pollution cos from the exhaust fumes of he transports that inae ciie worldwide .
Hwever , we n lready fight tis - wating te developing of advanced technolo wic n beter expoit reneable , sustainable enrgy . - for examl taking avatage of publc transpors .
e best idea is sll , obviusly , alorizing te use of icyces .
Apa from tat , evn grater is te pollution of seas and rive .
oluting em is lk endangering the le of the whole wol .
This is caused by the waste of factories , but lo by the damage ht tankers do not only to the a , b to the mainland too .
In addton , what aou dometc wastes , whih ar our reality ? We shld al lern to manage our wastes , because each of us , in or o small , is a great amage for the environment .
In conclusion , I think it is nee o late for svig our wonderful rld .
Why no do it now ?

The furniture conits in a set of chairs , tabes and sm sofas , covered th e clothes .
T restaurant appears very elegant nd traditional .
Usuall , hee is no music in the restaurant .
Th one prefers to leave on only he TV , but often the dinig room is silet .
In hs way , cutomers can hae the chance to hav a coversatin , without being nnoyed by television or musi .

In my opinion , he blic transport s futu becue this is chepe than othe transpot , also t pollution is low .
The ca is a transport more cofotable thn the public trasprt bt is not ustaiable , t st is higuer and if al pole mo by ca , The cities wi be very pollutes .
Al , in the big ciie , t public transort is more punctua tha the a because hi transport sally has i own lane , while if you use the cr , you takes more bcause there are a t traffic in ur lane .
Ote trasport that cn be ve sed in te ftue is the bke , tis transport is cheap an ecological , also , more and mor t cities ae building a t bike lane so is a go alterativ .
For travelling oter citie or town , in my opinion , the car wll remain t transport most sed , althuh te n tansorts cou change this situation .
F the finish , I hin at the traport ot e in the cities in e ftur wl be te bus , metro a bike and for tavellig nter ties te car wll remain he most used .

This is a te , whn parents could ceat behaviour of their chldrn , because when te grow up , they a eginning rebe an do thngs which e good in hir opinion .
Secondly , fr behaviour of older children like teenagers have an impact oth factors , it r not only thei parents but other peop , whose surrond hem .

" Annabelle " is a horo movie hih i am going to watch ths Saturday .
I am wondering if i will be scared after the ovie .
T movie is about a dl calld Anaelle which w clsed in a musu frm Conecticut ere she is isited by a eist wo lesses r tce a month .
Jon From fids the perfct gift f his pregnant if : a beaufull colection oll drssed in a weddig dress .
Unforunatelly , in a orribbe nih the cole"s house was inied by a satanis group who atack tem a leae just lood beid them .
The stanist voced an eavel entity that is capabe of th worst higs ... Annabelle .
After Mia gives birth to r doughter ily , Annabelel ants to ki e .
Eve th pist doen 's know ow to help the nhapy failly .
Everyone is terryfied and find out tha a demon is attahed by the doll .
don't kn the end of the story u i n;t think that is a happy one ...
h a of ths report is to hghligh ho e citzes care of the nvironmet , in order to gve uggestios to keep hi area len .
In the mtter of ht , information concerning wt people do , or could do , e ing to be sown .
ew people who live in the suburban areas hav the following rotie :
1 Check if your dog or anyoe ese 's pet damages reets or grens .
2 Divie e rubbish fm he produts which n not be reyled .
3 Denunce thoe who leae rubbish in t wrog spaces .
Disadvantages :
If th majorty of ctizen , including h oe h li in the it centre , h followed these ideas , his city would hav been surely cleaner .
Unortunaely , deeper problems are lined to the dificult tht all the ihabitants respect those principles .
Sm thought that volunteers shoud involve carelss peole in many poject to keep thir city atractive and mvelous .
It is povn that to be a prt of a projct alway make pepe feel sefu .
I wld , therefore , reomend tis idea .
Nowada we can see tt ac time more blic transprt nd to improve the quality of your rvices , te pple daily ned hs kind of transport go to wrk , go to schol and in general dpnd so ch of the puic ransport .
The govermet ca to iprov the public transport makig a great investmenting lie changg the l vehicles for new and increase te nuber the bus , tris d build more bus sttio d trains stton this kind the action will help a lot he ulity of he ublc transport r poulatio nd ill beom he life of he pople more es .
Tday mny peol prfr to trvel by ca than pblic transport because of the bad qality srvics , e us , the rans are fu and many times are utl rty and lt .
However if this situation nt change nd if ur goernent n take providence abou tis important subject wil be the en of e transort pulic and will more convenient to use car .

t world is sadly lacking in an environmental mind in consequence , it caused the globa warning which been t mo importat global roblem it does n't mid to more than tre quaters of the world population .
Curently we hav got more than i diferent types of banks in our streets but as fr as I kno it is not suicient to meet e ned of the environment bcaus wadays we do podce a lot of different materials , al of them overproduced a we do oly learn this education in our home in our childhood , accordingly I am n of the ew worrid teenars in he world aou it so I really do hlp the environents as a as I can .

A couple of eas ago , I hardly could e any bis in supermarkes and houses .

It is truly an amazing experience and how much progess my sal illag s d done in 2 years of tm .
Even thou , ther ae not provided seprae bin f different categories of dirt .

In spie of throwg it in a bin we ls ming sme ar to environment unknowingly .
As hre are ifferent ind of materials , it . soe ae renewable and some are t .
In my opnin , in th nxt 50 ears , umanty ill increase and ere wo n't be resources enough for evrybody .
There will be on another planets , for example th mon , mny citadels nsde an enormous dos .
Tn , I suose that in every country wl be used muh more renewal enrgies instead nlear energies for reassure a seue future for the net generains , an maybe everybody will use elecic car or decrease the tmspheric polutin .
he eopl 's ie will chan even by policy nd the economy .
I oe hat in th future thee wil not be ay war by the economic crisis .
I thn that public transpot has a fuure , ineed rael in car is much more comfortable , because you do n't av to al to take a b or e underground .
u there 's a thn , no ne have engh oey to buy a r or maybe two ; that 's h there 's a lt of pole w pefr he public transport .
erhaps in a future pubic traspor it can be more comfortable fr e rs of the ople ho dos n't hav a car .
I think that hee is n't o pulic transport eause noadas e eope usually us you prvat c .
hs is so adveteges such us it is ore omfortable and fast .
en ou travel by u you must have a timetable nd it is es omfortable an travelling by car .
However when yo go by ca you can take yu car whenever you wt .

I ra you e - mil , so l 's tk abt books ! I usually read a book on my free tim , beaue I prefer story ha ort articles .
Recent I rea four great boks about Shah , they ere very nteresting , my favourite was : " Te Book Thi",I read it for chool , u I av already saw the film of tis bk .
It 's a ver moving book , bt it is n't ifficult , I think that 's fo teengrs , but is also good for adults .
I love the thing , that in this bo , there are a lo of German words , so I also ould improve my Germ ( I go to the lagages hig schol ) .
d what about you bo ?

I hope ou 'll answer me son .

Last ridy I 've visited Bala without n plannng .
I usually wak up at 10 am at th ay my fater called me at 8:00 am and asked me to go Balla wih thm .
He suall avoids me in this kind situation .
Nowday he treats me as botheraion .
That is why I a vry surpised .
The reason he ld me to go Blla is Noman will fel alone ther as Bado and he mother is n ging .
I was in a bit esitation latter decide to go .
Acually I do n't ve ough curag to say no to my father .
I g ready very quckl so I did n't do my moning exercises .
We ae been told earlier hat Abul kaka has go a ve ic AJRO Jeep fro offi noetheless h performance of h vehicle wa aful tht da .
It hu down at t road fr sveral imes while we wr on the y .
So I was feling very anxious that if th car ai in Aricha highway .
Beaue I was so sure Abul aka d Noman il prefer Aricha ighway rather than the Singair road .
I do n't feel comfortable in hi - ways fr many reaons .
Tos are e most rsky roads of th cuntry . if there is an alernae y I lways us that .
That 's y hen I go to village I like to use e Sngair Road than DHAKA - ARIHA hhway .
My fathr also uses this road .
Wn I s a youngser , my father and I rde motrcycle to visit our place using this road .
As I ws a kid I fall asleep someims .
ay be r that I ave a hgh regrd or e road .
noman engaed he front eat .
Though he wa unwilling to sit the as becase bul ak or my father hold be seated thee .
But they sist him .
So we four wee occupying h back seat uncomfortably .
he the ca stped to ta oil at a serice satin near ilano , my fther sed me to go h very ck bencs of the ep .
I thought I shoud n't oe as becaus the bechs were disgracful for me .
I fel li I 'm depriving by my family .
If I were in a better position it could o hppen to me .
eople humilit me in many ways bcase I do nothing fr earnngs .
I fud it vr painful when my arents do it to me .
I eep my rin col n try to vercome t situation by thining ne d I wil roe myself . I knw who I am n what I 'm dig .
My thoughts ae unquestionably beter thn others .
ece I 'm waiting for good time .
We reached ur oe at 1:00 pm as well as planned to back Dhak at 4:00 pm .
It gives the impresion tha on ging ad oming in a big car is the ain purpose of th tour .
That w riiulous .
That the I spent ot of my te it Noa th is over talkg habit .
My usual stane wih this kin of person is to listn .
We visited ngar chak it mh anticipation .
In tis season I kike to see the sun shine .
The crystal clear and md u is vr favorite of ne .
hle I ws litening nmn I was discerning that I shuld question moe .
Wh he tlks he a done ay mstkes ecaus of s over talking hat .
at 4:00 pm we e or Dhaka was an early move becaus of faul ar .
I al slep as soo as we cossed jhitka azar in addition when I wake up we h crossed Tora bide .
We stopped r a to a oad sie ta stall to tk tea .
Than we t o Dhaka .
We talked about a ot of things .
Whn we talked to our seniors I tin I should cnrol myself though they talkd unreal things .
Th prefer industrialization over nature .
At th same time th aso kep saying that ature was more green and vgrous in our ti .
A eve edig argument to places a ths we reached Dhaka .
Traellig or moving fro place to another by car is much mre covenien for a man thn public transpor .
By ca yo a go whenev yu want on tm wit no ned to wait for hours at h statins for s or subway .
It is fastr a leaer and uc mre comfortable .
For xmple , if you are in a hurr and want to cach h place ou are eadin to , you an rie as fst as ossibe .
Yu ca have some other coices that yo can sp to buy something : ter , juice or snack if you get hungy your ay or thirsty .
You even can take a re r awhile leaingly to sleep or to hve a n .
You wold n't suffer anymore rom the toube or annoying stf on bus most of th time ie : no room for you to sit , bad smell eope can ake , or ge bothering or bushig .
It 's convenient areay .
u , on the other hand , becase of rcntly traffic as been terrifically unbarable ; ca are so many ; very noisy , unclea air produced as beome e pblic transport etter to ave eath .
In all over the rld popl always ed dvices to eep looking after eir environments .First , the municipal should do workshops in chools nd universities providing students by tips that shod help us to mae our environnt len .Second , they should make awareness campaign about environment ; fo eampl , telling people to put their rubbish in ste papr basket which helpng workers to recycling it easi .Finally , to sty healthy we need a healthy environment .
I usd to find a ug - fu sensei to teah me .
But at th region where I live I ha not found .

Somtimes we r with people tht we love .
Wn someone wnts to hut our relaive or riends , we must do somehng .
There a a o of d peple in the street .

he most exciting da of my life was when I d my sister discovered tat we would snd one week on a cruise with our fiend ! that as a very eautiful Holidy !
We spent a t of time together eery day ; we visited some fantsti ciis in Greece like Santorni , Athens and many others .
In Italy we also visited Bar and Venice too .
ery ay we pnt te on the beach nd acros e e .
ver vening we et to te restaurant on te cruise .
Meals we vy oo n lso in h morning I t English breakfast or gs and read because I wanted to chan my outine whie I ws on the cruie .
I think it 's he ost exciting holiday I 've evr spent a my favouite too .
I nd my cassates with r teachers nd othr casses wen to te cinea to se the fi " Fantasic Boccacio " .
It a an interesting experience to go to the cinema to my class nd ee in a film what I have tudied during the Italan lesson and understand beer the storis of Boccaccio , oe of th most important Italian rter .
Seing the film we have had h possibiit to watch the characteristics of th main characters of Boccaccio and the differet laes where te stoes tk plae .
In my opinio te il ws ad in a vey good way : the registers of t film ( they re w ) tell us fe novl wth only one ain protgonst : h lv in every situation .
The rgisers of the fm said that they want to creae a il without time , an tey wer bl to create this .
he scenes of film , he cstumes d the msi e very beutifu and I suggst ts film to a of my friends .
According to the pt centur , we he see lots of hnge in te wrld .
It 's obvous tht nowadays is realy different fro 50 yea ago , so we can redit that t people 's lives will change draatically in te next 50 years .
When it comes to change , we can tin of wat way of ur lives is still inconvenient th it ca probably change .
Mos of the labours il probably ha be reesented by machinery , he eole who is ck of acaeic might be vey hard to get a ob , the knwedge mgt be deman if th pepe ie in the fture .

From September 11 to Septembr 14 , I did nohing besides watching TV , takin cae of my ttle sister Ellie and cht with my friens .
On the rest of t borg ek , I solved a 1000 iees puzzes .
On Sunday , my family and I nt to Causeway mador then to Albrook Ml .
Aftr e exms finished , I went home and had nthing to do , so I thought that I neded to watch my dras bcause it wa a week I have't wach hm due to the exam week .
So aft watcing all my draa , I hd notng to do .
Fo Setember 12 to September 14 , I ws too lazy because I was tired of the exam so I as a y layin on e soa doing noing apart of watching the TV and hat wit my friens .
Besides I need to tk care of my litl sitr Elle , who is very cute and funny and right now she is always trying to get up ad stand and wk .
On he res of the orng wek , I was watchig TV and suddenly my cousi fud some pieces of the pzzle nsie th cabinet , so I decie to sve my Pari puzzles wi my sister , ich was es than a af sold or aot one year bu it ad to much color in the k so I id n't finihed thn a ye o .
We bgn to solve it again ad took us the whole wk to fiish it .
While olvig te puzzle , I cided to count ho mu pies w ft , fter countg them I ralied that fe pieces wee issin .
I was too anr beause I was finishing e uzles a fv pieces er missing so I bega to searc the whle house f the iv pies but did n't find it .

On Sunday , my athe planned to take my woe family to Causeay Amador .
Also my uncle , nt , granfathe and usins went ith us .
Ater riving to the aseway , my brothe and my cousn went to drive bicyle for o ho .
I a hing ht my ather cn teach me to drive the cr b was not possibly because we went to Albrook Mall to eat and my father did n't wnt to return to auseway Amador to teach me dive .
Mini vacation can be un but sometimes boring becuse you ave't planed anythig for the vacaion .
The best thing I d was to sove my beautiful Paris puzzles and went to Amad wi my family n have a good time it he .
Mni aation are a reak for us to ave a fun nd good ment with u adoral and lovely family ad friends .

I chose always my clothes becase oy me now my avourie clthes and en I was child my oys .
Now I wear iffrent colours fo example back , lu , grey nd oher .

Pompei - th destroyed ity
I 'm sr you 'll gree Pompei is the most impotat archelogicl sit in h world .
It was destroyed by a vulcanic erpton in 75 BC .
Vesuvu - this is th vulcano 's nae ! - cverd it wi a t of cinder so tat alls , houses , food , lothes , corps of ciizens s bee prservd as ell ey were .
Yu an wa trough the sae streets and enter in the same shops th rmns entered ome ceturie ag !
It is n't inceible ?
Beside is possble to bo special tours in hich there re guides dresd like ppei 's citiziens .
I love the overnight tour , in which oly ies light he ruins .
Tee is an nque athmosphere !
In my opinion anyone could n't ome to Italy wthout visiting Pompe .
If you ce , I roise you 'll never forget it !
I do n't think thr is no futre for ublic transport .
Especially in rban , fo example , Taii ity in Taiwan .
People ho lives here alos knw the convenient public transport called M , it 's at , cheaper ad does n't have to find the parking lot .
Besides , it 's hrmful and makes eart environment more wrs for emsion so much carbon diode .
Tht will cuse the glol warmig .
So , it is ettr to e pubic transport .
But , if u live in the cuntry , car ma be essential , bcuse it 's ill spend so much money to buy the tikes if their family have man eople .
So , I tink e gvernmnt should hae to draw a propsl to solve the problems betwen e use for urban ad counry .
A hin eely the proble about protecting the environment .
I lov my small family .
My family ember are ery helpful nd supportive .
My parents e very support .
My prnts are my best frieds nd guides .
If an problems faced , i 'm we to my parents an a the problem , tere are solve the problem .

Walking eey day is wa I njoy .
Besides to be an excellent exerise , is also he more comfoable , because it allws me to concentrate , to be ith mysel , talking and prain to God in each step in the mornng .

Wat I really enjoy it is to lie in the gra .
It is in this mome when I g to talk to God .
I feel that he is nr to me that he listens to me every wr ta I pray .
Dng so , I begin my outin da , ome ack home , ben to do my brekfst , followed by the lunch , beaus I ave to get to wk at 9H0 o'clc .

In addition , indoor swimming pool sales have a slighty declining from 2012 to 2014 .

Most people like to have thir own car , ecause they think is re comfortable and flex .
Yo c go out from yor hose and take you a park and leave to yu jb and park very cse .
But I think that te future is t pulic transport , we eed preserve nature , his is an imperatv for our wrl , hn the slutin have to tk the oin that te government do ore invest in public transport , so e peole do n't need to get a a or being abl to have a job d do n't ed it fo normal development of eir lves .
As wll , we ve to promote that he people ge jobs close teir accommodation or gt he acommodation cle to the jobs , becas we he too much pollution and we could reward the companies tha ie stf lose to th lace of job , mab in a circle of 4 kilmetres , as well we oud reward the eole that tn teir accomodation fr live ne to te job or for going thre by a bicyce .
Mybe ths soud a bit crazy , t whateve solution wl be go , we oy mst make our minds up for abl to look across .

It 's plased some people because thy will be bl to slep an ou more .
I like sprig and always wait for it d wait for summer holidys with impatience .
Sumer is realy little le .

As tey ay in English proverb < trave broaden the mind>. In sumer you can switch off of daily routine , relx , hve a lk with friends .
I did n't decd as et where I will pnd he summer .
It became a bg problem n .
I always want to see the world , to swim in the Ocean .
Howver I am soppe last tragic developments in foreign countries .

Wh is my favoite port ?
We , I 've plyed mrtil as .
I 've been dng that for around twent yers .
Some artil arts ae not relly ports .
Th 're mr for sef - defense but for what I do , ad my y to st healthy , is martia ars and running .
As far as watching , ha 's a good question .
I would upose I would have to say , in Japan Sumo is my favorite sort for atchng .
I 've never ried it myself .
I would hve to robbly be three times as big as I am to even begin to ualify o something lik that but , yeah , I enjoy wating it a lot .
I have to start saying that I never imgine swimmig like my favorite ort , because until my ck 's nury , I practiced ther sports , I most like extme sports like downhi , skateboarding martial arts like Aikido , jiujtsu or ninjsu , but for my injury I have to tart swiming and n I oe it .
he thnk because I eny these sport is I feel fee when I am in t water , it is so relaxing d I red it is the most completely sport beuse y work the whole bod .
If u want to star wimming I tink y should loong f a wimming teache becuse if ca n't swim , ou must need it , and if you can swm but not well , if you ar not on pratce and know ur swim style is t he est I recommen u a professional assistance .
Mo time that u do n't ve that assistance is going to be me difficut imrov your style ad enjoy swmmin ore ecaus if u reay know hw to swm are going to have moe resistance in th ater .

Ms of those dreamers claim that it is like real .
They think they realy opened eys ad awaken sine it is too vivid an detailed .
Oftn tey explains n describe the cee in detail ik a cup on tble , friends h wachin TV beside them , room ligh an so on .
But noting is real . They realize ta no cp is on tale , no one is at room , and t lgt is of .
Commonly , he dreamers say ht ey ;
- experience wn they are so ird physically and so stressed .
- fee drwning dw wen ey are bout falling in sleep(so they now it will appn )
- feel a lot of prss on ody and can not mve in dream .
- see omeone or some people as standing beside or riding on te .
- feel te dem is so vvid and real .
- epatedly dream again if tey rarely awake themselves .

Military service is people ho is forc by the government be a part of the army to serve ad protect the county .
There are many countries which shuld be complte the miitary servce when people who reach 18 such as Tawa , South Kora an Singpor .
T dration of the miltay srice should be around 12 mout to 20 mouths .
Aso , hre are different sctions of raining during he military erice pope generally do a lot of taining to their obdiece or ow to use the weapons .
Thus , there is a cause of agreement an another cas of disagreement hic is freedom of choice a entl maturity .
As is oic , e one of th rson of eeryone shold ot he to comlete the military service bcause h freedom of choice .
Some people may think it seem to be a human rgts tht let the people to coose if hy want to join te military .
therwse , when e pole are force by t gvernent , they pobably ee the reeom of choice is restricted .
So some counties would n frc the peope to join military .
In contrast , it could be the benef that impros ther mental maturity .
If people join the military srice when thy ust 18 , it may lean a lot of life skill as there are quite a hi clai in the military and he chancellor ho wrk in he mlitry a request to he soldiers that everything frequently be regular .
o instance , they usually ned them to fld up a uilt in a specified anl or her is specific time hat you must wake up d t slee .
Peoe sould not be complaining about ything evn if th eem to be igh .
But after a perio of im , people could develop their obedienc especiall to h yun people ; tey will be lkly to beome a more independent perso .
To conlude wit both sides , thr ar easons to effect by people shold or should ot ve to mplete miitar serice .
However ; the effects may diffent whh is bae on ho lngt of he draton .

In my cy , we ve not a regula ca for h environment .
The hve been many proects to improv the caring of te environment .
ut there is a bi problem : the people 's cutur .
In my country y cn do a lot of efforts to take ae of the environment , but the bad culture in r eople is a gat problem .
That is because we do n't demonsrate intrest in the prolems of otrs .
We think hat u authorities are responsible r these themes .
Then , we do n't take positiv acons , individally .
We just wai until others clean the streets .
Th eople t hir rubbish in gs and thre it aay ear the hous .
The do n't spend ney in a good container .
hen , h dogs can bea he bags a eat h rubbih .
In this a the streets are awas dirty .
In my case , I prefer to av a can Street .
It doe n't matr if I lose time putting the bgs with rubbsh in a goo container .
If everyo 's demonsrate a better culue , it is pssible to improve our environment .
Nowdays we gow up ih the possibility of choosing a l of sports .
hi ct allows young peop do exercse and enjoy at th ame time .
Do team sors lo help to meet thr pepl and make new frinds .
Farite spor of mn people is footal , instead of my favrite is baktball .

Y , television entertains , bt it can alo educate .
Teleision can improve knowledge on curent affairs .
ducaion does n't lie on current fairs or related conets .
Television hep us to find he fields that inerests us , like music , sots , moies or nature .
These days televison lows us to se happenin all aoun the ord .
However , there ae quite a lot of disadvanage of television .
Especially , te fak ews speas faser without uc efft .
It depends on the individa , how to ma use of e opportunity .
Watching TV sems to be op on our list of things to do afe a long hard ds ' wr with a hot cup of tea in dak winters .
TV were and are sen as entertainment channels , but have you ever questioned if they are mr the st entertinment ?
Are we subcnsciously educating ourslves ?
You ask h ?
ow ha would be an interesting question , we can watch anything from news to cat ish h TV show , in e name of entertainmen ar actualy learning .
The trut is we are always larnig , u how we learn is anoter matter , ere in type of learners are auditory , visua , and kinesteic .
TV stimulates at two lernng style whic is visa and auditory .
Some my are tha TV ust dos n have suficient ntent or us to be abl to larn , other may argue ha TV is an aazing source of larnng . i.e we lrn out new tehnolgy vi a moil phone advert ai on TV .
We learn about socal alues , World ews t .
I have personally pked up information I wou not ave come accross other we o example , I hve be abl to learn that new BMW sven series , ha ambince lihtng , it n pull in nd out of the garage at e touch of a buon , it 's computerises sstem ca read diffren rad surfaces nd dpt it 's drive .
so ha you ever ased yourself Television entertains , u can it ao educate .

Addiction to authoritative nature or oter makes a hug production of a wapon convrt e lessin nature of science to citic .

Siece is concerned only wih the information bout the worl whatever it is , a sometimes in uethical conclusion without consideing the moaity .

Fit of all Teleision has le veers ow days .
Mt of the eopl ur to th Internet wbsite or applications like Netfx or Youtube .
Now let 's go back to hose day when young people till watch television for entertainment .
There were a ot of programs on television .
Most of th peopl wached nes , mois , or tv shows on elevisin .
Also there was a lot of dffeent channel that we hos .
As I remember there ere educational channel ike Discovery and ational Geography .
Thoe chanel alwas coten a lt of ne technoloy .
For some peol ay think tha only these kind of channel can provide educational knowledge ad o sme pele hy do n't conside watching ths channel as entertainment .
or these kinds of channel are both ntertainent a educatnal .
But I wo n't opine that thes ae the ly channels that can proide noledge .
Al kinds of shows can give o l kins of different knowledge even when u watch movies .
But of course there will be so channel that is not suitable o child under 18 or jut fr adult .
As I tink here is no canel tat u ca n't learn form it .
All inds of prorams hae soethig that yu a think abu us deen on h o lok at it .
So television ntertains , ut can it also educate ?
Yes of cours b only when you look at it as a way y wann lean something .
My sudis in tcnoogico de Monerry are demadig a challenging bcase it ha a very high educative core l worldie , u also has to many go things , fr example we hae a lot of interchanes ll around e world , when o have t opportnity to do an interchange you have to dea wih t language and the clture ith h other country , that means yu have to be responsible for tudyin the basics tings of ha contr , bu all of ths is worhwhie because hen o are thr ou ha so much fun .
I thnk th a complete sport is to swim r most of h people .
It 's gd fr hlth and wellness .
I elly njoy because gve me a lot of relax n it help me to be tonic and satisfed myelf .
Usually I go three times a eek a drng the eeken .
I advice peolpe to start this sport , because is completely and make o mnd it th body el very goo .
Wn I w fourteen ear old , I wi the championchip becue in that period I swam as agonistic atlet .
It a been a really satisfaion and I had een appy .
Nowadays I 'm really gratefl to my parents becus they have spent mon for me and I have to thanks them .

Introduction
The m of the report is to wrie how ae own ak ar of the environment .
I do a research and this ae findings .
Rubbish
We he a t of bs arund t area , so now we cn hrw our litters whenever we re .
Also we have rcycl bins f pap and glas .
Cleanr
Eery Saturday our local cleaning team ean the park n o veyone can enjoy it !
Cocluson
We do everhing to make ou ton mo green , our citizens alay have ew ideas ht ake he dfference of ur daly life .
It is common that ore and more people e overweight , cusd by too much fastfood and unhealhy lifestyle .
ow sm scientists ae sggest to having arnigs on some tys of foo d drink .
But is this idea a way to reduce the bad habi of consume noxious foodstf ?
On the on hand I ca n't imagine hat a little scine on he food people etrap to top tir soping n ra th warnngs .
if is fa moing and tie is mney .
Everything has to happn fat .
irst of all , we ned to make peol awe of e crrnt envionmntal situation in order to do activities hat ep the environent .
To begi with , we have to try to ue as litt as possible h car or the us nd try to g at any lac walkig or by bicycle .
Ts actin uld decrease the a emitted to the envirnmet .
In ddition , he water issue is anoer big roblem .
Nwadays , peoe is wastin waer instead of saving it .
One basi solution r this oint is ty to not take a shower o so much time but ting it ih a buckt and a fe minutes .
Another slution is to t waste water wil we e washing dishes .
We should use nothe bcket fr this as .
Tking about rubbish , it is very important to seprat it in the fllowing ype : metal , plastc , organic , glass and cardboard in order to mae te cllectio task easy fr the dustman .
However , we als ae to try to o reat more rubbsh recycling ot of them .
For exmpe , the rgani rubbish can be use as fertilizer , the metl scap can be taken to t melting factoy as wl as the glass .
Therefore , the evironment is n going to recover if we do not decide to tke or part in this glol problem .

This is an ld castle of 10th century d the syle is Arabian .

pane , train , nd boat are the ways to ravel .
I hin the boa is e bst a to travel nd I have hree reasons for my idea .
Firt of all , boa mvs across he s n the sea is very beautiful .
For insance , wen we mve on the sea , we can se many types of animals , ch as birds , turtls , and fishes .
Next , he oa usually is vry big , so we ca do many activitis on it , sh as dacing , rinking .
Finally , It is t sfst y for trvl , bcase we do not ha many dangers , such as crshing , falling any othe ins of daner in he sa .
Therefre , I prefer te oat to travel , instead of the train or the pne .
All in a , ravel in the sea with a bt n be vry interesting a comfortable , in additn , it is vy sety .
I advise y to tral by ot if you have enough money for it .

In my ie I hae h a big experiences that ae made me change n mature .
One of t mt imortnt experience I think wa cmin to study to Tijuana .
It was a really challenge for me to ve aloe .
Bfoe I ame here I was so depenent of my parents nd I had a lot of fear , but I learned to overcom a the thing that stopped me .
When I w chld I used to live in Tijuana .
I was born ere .
Wn I had 4 years I wen to li to Ensenada because my father worked here .
I as used to livng with my whole family in Ensenada .
Sne I was br to my 18 years od I was living whit tm , ut now I liv in a small apartment .
I am studyin Nutiton at h University , hat is why I am living in Tijuana .
I used to live in asistent house it as my firt lace wre I lvd in Tjuana , en I changed to an aprmen with w frieds .
ll weekends I used oin to Ensenada for visiting my amily , my boyrien n my fiend .
Before I cam to lv to Tijuana , I a really nervous beaus I d to leve everythng and because it wul be a change in my life .
r summit , ame to live to ijuana was a rlly chalenged or me .
I learned that you ed to face our far , to achieve your oals .
I do not reret what I did because I do what I le .
Nw I am so independent and I eared h to live alone .
I liv in a sall villae on counryside th fw pople .
En if we ar a conry , we tae cre of e environment throug he se of photovoltaic systems on roofs of ny hses , uh as the nursry sool and otr uses ta hve this ystms to produce eegy .
We separated paper from glass and lo to lastic .
Th garbage picks up pape ne a wee , plastic t times at month and undiferretiated hre times a wek to all pole w li in my country .
My district makes cla my villge a it uslly tries to ak attractive it new social initiatives fr the ommunity .
All people of the orld he friends , I 'm o an excepton .
When I as 10 ears old I met my bes find .
We 're friends ice we strt to tak , b u friendship s change over the tie .
When we wee 12 we played in e garden ith the balls a with the the bys and girls , but hen we ere 12 yar verything changes we do n't want to py in the garden because we refered ciem or watching TV .
Beaus of ge caning we id n't see us , bt in the momt ta we gre up mre , we e us the weekeds an sometimes we 're upset abou some problems that we hd .
With the time we r or friends .
Now , we discuss ometimes but we ov us because he alwys sy together in the god momets to tak a coffee or talk about our lives , bu he als sa in the bd moents , deste being friends sne we wer 10 ars old .
F ts reason I tin that friendship is so imporant thig in the life .
I hin th opposte , I eleve that puic transportation as a eall huge ftue .
It is true that we re a lot of users tt wan to use the car u , a hat amount is growing up ; as well there are a lo of eole that do n't he th posibility to have a car and some u the public transportation becuse may rasons lke the pie , bcause it is easier to e to te plce by blic transportation rahe thn car , ecause the traffic , some times for eole it is so xausting to dive lots of hours an en sme times the public transportation is ster .
T population is growing up so fs , we need pulic ransportaion , is importat .
blic Transportation is coveniet f some ople and so eope think is mr onveient t car , finally we wil ned public transportation on the future .
In r inion globalization is a good thng that happen to us , alw us to ieract with all the world , so we can meet h cultres , ouments , etc .
It bring us a l of opportunities to hang and in some cases to get a bette li in ohr countries like fid a o with t hghest salary .

Hi !
My nam is Anton .
I live in the oe of th most beautiful countries - Ukran .
When I was at school my frnds nd I attendd ior swmming shool .
I was 30 years before .
I usd to hav traini tic a ek .
I iked that time a lot .
My friend and I lwys a i rame an u afte training .
w I 'm a buines alyst .
I work at offic and have no ideas where a my frieds .
Ti year I decided to star visiting pool and wm up to thre times a ek .
Now , wn I swim at th on pool , I am orfilled by poitive emotions .
I like smming a lot .
Nowadays the obtion of broaden the ing trveing is very comun .
In my pinon I think that it is not the only a but it is the best ay .
Apart from ha you see w plcs and you hv fun , you also rn others cultre , hisorials fcts , you also lern to resec ohes peoples an irs osums .
In adition you do n't think in yours problems an e only hng ta you do is hve fun d do hat you hat to do .
Besides you see new world and thirs form of ive ad that helps to open yo mnd , see t word in her wy .
In onclussion I think that it is e bst way to opemn your mindn not the ony wa but e the best y .
may countries are try arted to concer no nvironent a worried about th globe warming , In schools teachers ar oing their best to educate children o to tak cae of their school a keep thm tidy , aso hy trai them o to plant tree in public arens of teir towns ,
Althgh government stict so many aws an taxes in the peol how do ot pay their taxe to h cuncil fr cleanig of the rubbish from own nd vllges , in te biggest polluted cy in the world peop strte to s bicycles n cycin inead of driving their cs to educe the polluton of eir city , ao they invent differnt ws to pla even every lttle aa hich an be plnted to ke their cit lean and attractive .
Fist of all , I disagree with that statement , becaue of these resons I am aout to give .
Oce we top usig Public transport , it is ing to causes problems .
Fr example , if we completey relaying to use ars it is goin to increa the gasoline se .
Apparently it is going to make more polution ore global warming issue .
Hw ev , using cars makes the life esir but when everyone or vry house hey wl ow at ast hre cs it is o muh .
Athoug th taffi as t accidents ec .. .
puli transport it is realy portant and it h a lot of advantges r heping humanity .
In my opinion vey couny they suld ve dfferent ind of public transport
bues , subways , and trains .
Fr instance San Francico it is a grat example o incredible city , th variey of chces in the pbic transpot it is remarkable .
In spite of e cost of these facilities it is gig be expnsive but it is neessary .
In onclusio , The governments should work on tha because h people need the ubli transport and the wold for e environmen , li expases it is mu cheaper than haing a car .
I hope to see it round the world , pulic trans port something we can no aoid or replace with anohr thing .
In the fuure , public transport wil dispear .
Everyone will have h o ca .
Cars wl be safer d speed ta now .
Traveling by car will be the bes suitable
way to move from place to anher .
Reommend to fieds ha county we have to go .
I would ie to recoomand friends to sit Ital .
fst of a , nowadys whereve we go we c find Italia restaurant eaily .
There are a lot of food all ve the world .
but I thik Italian restaurant is getting famous .
Second , beautiful tourist places ie a Veice .
I have bee to Italy whe I wa 20 .
It wa aeome .
There is no wrd to explain .
Venice is ciy that is bsd on water .
here ae no car , no metro in Venice .
On e other hand it coud be complicat . t nody complaint .
I think that 's why hs cy can maitain th saf environment .
Third , Italy is famous for fsion .
It bings many fashionable eole .
if you are person h ov fashion you will enjoy going there .
e las thig is hstor .
Thi county ha a lot of history .
so it makes me eiting .
so if you want to vit any country i 'm gin to recoomend to Ital .

In t argumen , t author asserted tat t city sould prohibit skateboarding in Cetra Paa .
The author claimed tha the business dropping causes by t inreasing numbe of skaeboarded users .
Likewise , the skateboarded users broght numerous garbage that affects the stores in th paz .
Based on auhor 's two ocern , the statement that drew a conclusin to prohibit skatebaring in Central Plaza is not a thoughtful d wise decision .
Fst of all , it is a cntradition in the argument .
If more skateboarded usr are willing to go to Central lza , there ae more customr to help the rwth of business .
It is ainst ahor 's assertion .
From this point ew , e decreing of usines shud cuse by other fcors , but t skateboarded users .
Hwever , ter a many reasons can ause h buiness dropping .
Probably , e stor a oo d in Centra Plaza which could not attract cusomers wak no , and have to renovate .
Furthermore , the podce ales in the sores that could n't i cusomers ' need .
Those abov reasons could influence th buines in Central Plaza directly .
Scod , atho claid that te sanitation problem ased by skateboarded users is not oy happen by specic peso , whenever more ustomers should bring more aste d wrongdoig .
Those probems apeal hat there are not sufficient securities in Central Plaza .
Moreovr , th proble would cae by sateboarding immediately is the skateboarded users tak over pedetrian wlking pce .
To solve his problem , h cit should et up more pace nd facilities for skateboarding , ad divide he different space for walking nd skatboarding .
To m it up , e author 's preditio wo n't happe if the city prohibit skateboarding .
In contact author 's concerns , the increasing skateboarded users wod ring more potential to mprove he business in Ctral Plaza .
On the othr nd , te author hold provid profound discussion wy people com to Central Plaza do n't shop there .
The condition of h stors ad safety are o rucial actos to affct the busnes in he plaza .
To strengthen ahor 's conclusion , h auth should p h actors aove in e argument .

Thee is an incresing trend of peronl transport so that public transport will be reduce in e future .

This article is about o I think abou h eficiency of public transport .
As I ied moe tan 12 years on the countryside I a dependent on buss nd trains .
In the morning , I need to get to school a in the evenings public transport heled me to get om .
I hl t opinion th a more frequent and mor regular transport is nedd .
Sontaneous acivities were impssibe as you awas d to an to advance .
I a hrdly waitig for my 8th birthday .
I do agree television advertsing diect ward oug children should not et allowed for seeral reaons .
Fit , ti id of advertisement should be frbidn reasoning the fa youn cilren are still strongly vulnerable .
Kids round tee age ( 2 to 5 yas old ) do ot have a maturated critical sense an anything an easly persuade them .
Fr instance , when I was hee ears o I used to be capivatd for all h ts which er prsented on tv commercials just bcause the a hy were exosed .
One of them was " e ultimate ax steel " wich as about a hundred dllrs .
Secondly , I am ao opsed the allowane of this advertisement becuse he severely cnsequene it causes no he parents and child 's relationships .
It is common we see paens having issues it their kids in ason to this kind of comercia .
Many parents have an unhealthy relationship , or even a wrcked rlationship , wit the kds .
n example is what happened wt / to my ouin Paicia hn h ha her ist chil caled Sopia .
One day spia got really exced wih an advertisement about baie dol and s could ot think abut anything else thn havg thi oy .
Unfortunately , my cousin i n hve nugh mney to buy it , bu er daughter - a three yrs old k- i n understand it an got anry ih Patricia , do not spekig wel with he for hree weks !
In conlusion , I am stongy favourable to hs satemen . dvertisment or young kids , n ony until 5 ut unl 8 years old should be forden resoning the kd 's ulneability and the risk to teir arets ' relatioshis ith hem .
In lst case , if the advetisemnts were til exose , It wuld be ssential me eucatonal politics come with thm , valorizing and teaching kids on understaning thir parens .

As you know I am a prson wh ike sport d usi , but if I ave to decde wic of tose aciviy are me important the I wuld prefer sport .
I think the hsical civity cn gie us more profit in our li .
For example if o e active evey day , you can keep yor elth in good ondition .

We c really confirm tt hee is no future f plic transport , if so , we will ave to die a car nstead of buig a ticket for pubc ransprt n go to offce , cty , home and so on using private transport , hover we can lso hink tat in the centre hs no parkin c or it is no enough fr he whole private ca , threby , if we use a public ransprt , we can simlfy o lives a spend less mply becase we r able to save mone and tim .
A omparison between peop who like to use a plic tranort and prate ransport shows that first one a av mony a tm but als they are in rlax much mre than pope who use private transport .
Finaly , I do n't think that private transort is uc bete tan pulic transport .
I hop tt those eople who wrote ths artcle can change eir thought and can likely to rit a vey useful arice .

The city contain bout thirty public parks .
The pas a ull of greenery ; hese parks also used as plygrond o children .
Trees in the prs ae not sufficient as per requirement of our cty .
Te yr efore , local governing ody of th city dide to plant mr te nd it asked advice fom he citizens of the city out h propoal .
Everbod got interested in the project .
We plated trees nar side of hihway , uned lands , and outide of the cit .
ow these trees are gronp .

The last film I w was no n , in at it s " Te Others "
Th ters is a film at is ased on a family that lves in a house nd in ths where mn strangers this happen .
h principal character is Grce that is the motr of her two chldren Nicholas an Ane .
The hdsband of rac is caled Charles .
In the im there were servants , the wre Brtha Mills , Mr utle an Lydia .
is ilm is abu a family that lies in a vey big hous .
Charle as to go to the war and Grce and her sons stae in ha ose but ot tey were t ale tey er with Brtha Mills , Mr Tuttle and Lydia .
The problem is tat the mother started to liste many wear snds and er sns were n ong them , so who wa te responsible .
er sons have a problem the ca nt e he natura ight and e they Grace ot up becaue her hildren were outing and crying so she went to ther edroom nd the curtin was not ter so she go to the ther room and the courtins ao wre o thre so h stars getting nervous an mor nervou so she go a tk to the servants , so e got ve angry ad she told te go ou of my hous and they d t are so he pick up a gu and the old lady returned her keys .
Then man things hapned , and then tey discover that the ghost were not the ervants .
Of curs I recommed his moi , beause it is very ineresting and in some par is funny o , and Nicole is the principal charcte so I love it !
In my opinio I do nt aee wt wt journaliss do , or to me if I were a movie star , a famous man who has done many prforances I do not like every hur of t day to be pursued by journalists .
In dditon , veryoe want to hve a momnt of prvacy d beause journalst papparazzi n no have a mont to relax , tutoring or children or dependent on wht else ou at to do it an you can not becau journlists .
And another reason why I have so right in wh I h to sy in the rank above yo eel if you were in gae the people are lway these people and destroy families because hy declare fals Intrigue sometimes .
Sometimes abuse the igh to be a journalist with ll sorts of questions th no response or have a partial respose to thee famous peole can say that journalists have a strssfl o for ome peole .
n finaly I wol like to y y are aainst these pple , or still migt chan their stl and verythng wod be ok !

Fst of all , thak you profesor to teach in te meantime , the enie ours of e learn really benefited , especill in t first meeting , for British English , I stil di not really understand , it mke me frustrated , but graually after I foun h beautiful of te language in British Engis , I tnk it 's ll because of the usual problem of American English , and so I really appreciate that you choose simple textbooks and it 's esy to ean , and ou really ery arefully an very hmorous , you 're always careful in curriculum pronuciaton corretion f each student , usg a variy of readn skils l us immerse te read .
I ve to listen to British English , but it 's really hr to study , l because we are ll earning merican Enlish in Taiwan , so whn I have the opportunity to contact rtish Enlih , it 's full of te cadence , aways feel particuarly chaing , and British culture exue noble temperament , so Brith accent sounds like there is always an indescribable elegance quaities .
And th stengths and weanesses in both of segmnal d suprasegental , I think it 's aybe h larning habi , whe I heard a setenes , I woul use many vaieies of tone and manne to say the enteces again , hrefore , I can esil be interpreted illustrations instructions the motions an feelings .
Oly possbe in segenta ronunciation , the occasional misse a few notes , such as -d , I id t noticed thi becase when I eliberatel stress -d , I fod t ton and moo me lkey to bcoe very weird , tis is the biggest poblm I 've encountered in pronuncation teaching .
I 'm n teachg English in my w school , bu in te futur if thee is e cnce I will efinitey iv it a try , esecialy in the currculum learned som teahing tips , the biggest ai his cors is to read picture ooks to ed and record , becuse that and English proficiency is not jus trining , but will ote tt strethen tir pronunciaton ad intonaton , nd he eac time peer feedback al cmplted te listening exercises .
If I ave an opportunity to back on English teahing , I think I wil try this skill to et my studens to do he recordings her training , then make hir English better ad bter .

To begin with , nowdas me and oe people prefer tevelling by cr rather th by u or trai .
Certany , it is mr comfortable to trel by your on transport wth your family or yo riend . You cn stop and hve a rest whervr you at .
You can change your plans and cose another direction .
For differentiae betwen old coputer and comptrs tody , would first hv to describe each type of machine .
I stt describing old computers which we aw in the vido were few simple machines ( at e time they were created ) ad coverig an eormou room .
On to of that hese macines onl ored when it is wrote an order to the computer .

In my opinion , taing aone means ta yu have smethin to thnk about , for example to hin about our ded .
Journalists follow you ad they do n't give yu to ive suc as oral pupl .
To tell ou t tuh , I lke being aone ey often .
To be on my on and watch the her people live .
I aways wear a mask , I an be myself only wth my cose pple .
In the en , I want to tell you that we ar not robots , everyo deerv that they want .
My opinion it 's opposit of them of this composition .
I id n't he a car .
Every day I se to takn public transport .
I live in a iy , and for an people liv like me , the most onenient transport is the pblc transport .

An Unforgettable Lesson
There re various inds of ifferent things that appened in peoele 's life , ome may be normal a nothings special , while others may be meaningful n unforgettable tha you will remerbr it r a on tme .
ae y evr ha thi experience ?
When I am in lmentary school , I joined a peakng cntet , but I failed , n I had broken - eared .
Base I seldom practiced it .
But soon I de up my mi , thinking that I ca n't be so decadent orver I wan some change , hoping I will be eter in the nxt year .
So I practiced it day and nght .
No mattr it is sun or rai , wnd or rm . And also sked teahe for help .
Eventually , I got umber three in e comts .
Throgh ti tim , I learn that win an le is t th most ignificant thing .
The most important is that you a earn a valeabe lesson from failure .
Prctice n ak perfect .
And never give up .
Relve/ ertrmine / insistence
My counry tnessed a tremendou change in te last e years .
10 years g , I was a hid , a I can seld eat meat in dinner .
t nw , I feel uncomfortable witho ood everyday .
Peop 's eath
Nowadys you people 's ealth is n't as heahy as for example twety years ago .
ne eason or the change ay be du to the stle of life that people have .
Currently we do uualy less exercise than before because we us our ar to go anywhere .
Whereas our syle of food has canged er much .
We do n't eat at home nd it 's very cmon eatig junk food every wek .
On the other hand , hildren a se to eat nly wh they want becase in geerl they do n't like legumes , vegebles , fruits , fish ...
Th like eating junk food , hamburers , Frenh fie an sweets and what 's more thy do n't do any exercise .
Al these rasons could be ery bad or their halt in the futur .
So it 's ve imporant to giv he a healthy education .
To sum up , it is very impotant to be conscious but h ood affect ou healt .
ht 's the reason fo we hav to do more execse , eat less f n more vegetabl a teach ou children to eat better nd healthier thn they are sed to do .
My opinion ofselfemployment
I never eve wanted to be selfemployed .
My dad n my grandfathr had un their own business o more than 20 years .
My mother alwas tl me that my a d ver time for er ad my sibings .
When I wa brn my dad decided to uit hi company to get ore time f hs family .
Nowdays , he cr owes have been ncreasing in many countries , especially in eveloped countries , due to e convenience of trvelling by c .
Thus , sm pope laim ha e soial ten tends to decline e populariy of travelling by public trnsport .
As a relt , hi devepment is highly controversial in positive and negative ways .
Tay personal vhcle ecome pri of t life , mean if a person is on thre personal vehicle they r loo as higher status in he socie .
so it becoe a fashion of using personal veicle hich create a lo of roblem g one trafic roblem .....
now trafic roblem is h bggest problem . ny soluton to this se of public ranspor sstem as much as possible .
b no using public transport is looked as persn of low staus , so ere is no futre for public transport .
to tackle his problem we ave to elibeately think about it .
hank yo very uch
Our life is kee changing everyday ad we ntie that huge range of the changing in each decades .
Te lifestyle , technologil materil and e design of cas and houses keep changing nnually .
We n admit that our lfe will be quite diferet from nw to h ifty yas late .
hnging is a natal habitt that makes e le mor enjoyable to us .
It 's brinin e hapiess to n he beauty to us .
F example , we can know the ype of a car model by the changes that are made on it which it mae ou idiotif he sml ne details in every odl .
Even the kin of ose pantig an be changed by the time .
ow it is mo coloful and designed in differen ways Tha it wa at the past te .
We n nt sp changing bu we can gid it to h a special benefit whc it makes th if easier nd me comfortable .
Using the changing ethd would improve the eucaton system in mny aspects especally o eple wit obstrucion .
It is bri the hope to heir live a mke them aste t lfe in way tha they had dremed about it .
In cocusion , h changing of or li ca help us to expor dfferen benfits for the changng evy eade .
It service the educato and entertainment aspcts in ur if .
My town is very , vry ig with a lot of peole .
re tha 12 million pele iv in ou tn .
I ca n't say my town is the best plae in te wrd .
T ecolgica problm are er important fr the ast yers .
First of all - the a .
An enormous quantity of cars a the affic jams provokes a pollution of air and mo .
The urban authorites can not change the situaion cardinally .
But ter is an active cnstructin of n roads , road junctions and an improing of rads .
We do n't sepaate our rubis .
A rubis is taken aw witout separaton .
But people re intreste in it and th year I saw announcements bout days of receiving of sparate rubbish .
Our lawns so are te problem .
Sveral ars ago we had wodeful lawn with a ot of local plants n grass .
But t lat time the stet - cleaners w ll h yog gas .
Now o lawns e dirt and without grass .
But I hope u on il be bete wh or help .
I enjoy watcin Tenis in my couch , is wird tht I hven't played Tennis because whe I ve we do n't hae that kind of por , so I just cn watch in my TV .
ut I pe one d go to a tournament , tvel to Spain a tch my favourite lyer who is Rafael Nadl fo Spin .
Since the irst tie I wtche him ay , eight yers ago was the sme ea tat I strtd watch Tnni .
I ie ho the players moe throgh the court and o the audience applaused them every time tey won a pont , athogh I 'm not in te court I cou feel the feeling of t game , it 's eally awesome .
ce in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when tre a a competition or tournament , beses I wahed d enjoyed it , so could lrn how re the game was , which were its rls or ht happened wn thy yelled at the jumpire fo a no - reason , all these deais you cold learn an ai f a oing a to put the in pracic or help to h payes , is one of the things that I wt to make ea .
My advice would be tat I you wn to play Tenis just go ahead ply it , no xpect till others do it , because yo an do that to .
At h beginng it could be a little harsh , but is the same with many others sports when they art , so just keep in md that yu can play Tenni with the ot talentd players fr he worl oerall .

I could n't agree wh the int of view fo some reaons below .
Firsl , h growing number of private cars cause th big problem wth trafi jam .People pen etra tie on normal travel because of traff j .
That wastes people 's time and ak pole ee exhausted .
o menion to s , it 's dfinitely ad to enjoy travelling in hlidays .
Secondly , rivate cas are t main reason for h a poluion . We hold consider the protectin of environment for human fuure , not ly care abut the convenience we can e for now .
In the her hand , public trnsport sytem can reduce the ount of private rs in the busy area , ke u ad trm .
Pople can tael throg he cit easily and safely .
F inance Melbourn , th secondary city in Australia whee ar tram via rough the hole cit area .
Terefore peopl do n't need to drive cars fo travelling in the city .
The las oint is peopl go o long jorny by publc transpor .
Pblic tansport brin elaxig holiday and effcient businss trp to people without ear long driv .
or the reasons , it is ulily here is no future for puic transport .
On the contrary , We nd more public trafice to improve our traffic system and find the better w to maintain the evirnment .

if ou to travel ro city to city , puic transport is cheer tha others .

I think tht is sport is very happy .

The statement " pulic transprt is our future " has bee an interesting political discuss during years .
On oe han the plic ranspor is good ecause it oes n't polut so much and you can muve aroud all t city .
Youn people use it a lot .
We do n't use so much petoll le if we eah of te passenger to use it own privae transport .
In fact you ca n't s it if ou hve to carry a l of things or when you have hurry .
In cocluson the public ransport is ery god and if it desapear it il be a big roblm , is right that some tim you need a private transport b apart om tha he ubic transpot is ery use by peol of l ages .
Transportation is vy importat in cities , villages as wll as in sub - lines .
Mny people as no vehile , he only epnds on public ransport ue to oe easos .

At irst I wul like to ell u hat I do not agree with th statement . I ould even tell ta his opinion is opposite of e present nd futue situation .
As r me , even if travelling by c is so much more convenien , most popl will always trael by a tai , railway , bus n ohr types of public transport .
In my opinion peopl will travel by ublic transor more frenquely , because is tye of trnsport is less expesive , ore rustworty and even more ecological than travelling by cr .
In the other and , we c sa that it is really ncomfortabe to travel by pubic transport , but een hs we an impre in future .
We a dcover new ws of travelling , ta more care of our public transport and modrnis them , so pple wol be motivatd to travel by .
My trust in fuuric technology is so enormos that I hope there e oing to be a new ecological nd cheaper ways to travelling around or world .
If this il happen , eopl r going to be mo socl n empatic , ot even for eoples emotions , but also for u enviroment d ty will treasure it .
To begn ith , there are t ways of cting down on ollution . which las to globa wamin , ha beame a el threat of our lif day by day .
Firstly , tart to se renewable engy .
to llustrate , hen we u h renewal energy we reduce emisions so , our natural resources will be conserved fr or future furthermore ns future .
r example , usig wind Energy or Solar Energy r electricity generation we ill be used less fuel at is affected in emissions .
econdl , we shod improve our rulations ht les impos people lowering usi higs ma a lo of plution illusrate , using ig vehicles or about buiding bg facilites such as big factoies .
As a resut , ways to cut own on pollution . or insance , we one eson uses a c for 6 people nd many eple do t same that ma a lot of pollution for hat we ne to improve our regulation to make pele us small cars f cutting don on polltio for a eter fture .
l in al , using renewable eergy a improve our regulation is two ways to cutting down polluio o a bettr future .
Anoher thng we a do to a better future is avding war .
Because , war destroys mankin and countries .
an wrs tat ecause , people do n't know or resect h ther beliefs very well thus , we ed to earn about belief other popl we are ie wi them .
or example , the ight between Muslim and Hins in Indi or in Lebanes civil ar .
Secdly , do re ooperaion between countries .
To illustrate , people ould cooperation To ntrvene to bring peace to te world to sop the ar in any eas like what nite Natios doing .
Fr exampl , Unite Nations has taken h ecison to ban mandatory wepons against South frica becuse of rcil persecution olcy . in brief , knowig eac ter and do mre cooperation btwen counties it is to as to avoid wa or a bette future .
for ht we nee to improve r regulations to make people use sall ca for cutting dow on polluon for a better future .
Al in all , using renewable energy ad improe ou reulatin is to ays to cuttn down pollution o a bete future .

currently a very signifcnt problem for its scial and ecoomi impact is e chaotic public trnsort in Lm .
To lve th poble Lima ha ben maing og term strateges .
Lima is n of the ctie with less roa culture in t wrd .
we do not respec traffic rles to drive only wih he intnion to go fast as possibe to our destiation , this ofen causes trffct accidente and congetio .
or this reason peple is becmig aur of the teribe robem n is learning a teaching via culture to ew geeratons .
Besides puic nstitcions ae promoting this d also private companie mak advertising for awerees .

This is due to Li in h beginning a not had a pat to desin its pblic road s n higway , an it only has been improvising to build their way without any citeria to tranpor is population .
Currenty this issue is so important that gvernments r investig d working to create solutions suc a metroolitan .
I think we have really bome awa of te chaos of public tranport and we ve bun to design an implement stratgies tat in 20 ears ou ealit improve our relity
In my opnion I believe the ublic transport wll ha future , because this rnsport is vey necesry for the peol .
In a cites of the orl , th eople will ned h publc transport to move aron h ty .
e eople hink that te pulc tanspor is only the bus , ut the public transport is t s , he taxis , rain and subway .
Maybe raelling by ar is so mch more cnenient , but tere are a lot of car and his car proue a o of smoke and h ntue is dyig , if we do nothing , t nate ill disapear .
I would lik the people to tae the public transport f travellg , so we will be able rscue the countrysie .

Dear Mr. Weber ad r. Schnappf ,
ood mornig irstonce .
Now I 'll introduce myslf .
My name is Yusuf Hamd I am 17 years old an I vit e state secondary choo in che√ütz ,
tb e mr precise , I am in the graduating cass .
I ce from Halstadt , in clo vicnity of Bamberg .
I have 1 odr sstr n 1 younger brothe .
My hobies re meet Friends nd hangout with them or play baskball in my spar ime .
I 'm easly excte and nervous because this oral examination will determine wether i a do my A -level on th college of frthe education in Bambrg what i really wan .
My favourite sport is play soccer .
It 's played by eleven players wo try to scor a ol ring ninety minutes .
her is a gass floor , bu it 's als played on artificial grass .
I really ejy plying it because it 's vr excitng beause everything cld happens .
I usuall playng it th my partners d my frins which do t gam en more u .
I hardly rcommed whoever to py occer , becaus i 'm sure ta te 're going to enjo it very muh .
It 's also a full spor because peoe wl iprov their health condition .
Fst I want to sy is that people u the c ke lxury objet , n as transpo achine .
People spend their first lary to buy a car .
So , normally te use of te r is for peaure .
Peolle do n't use the five ats of h car to go to trvel .
From t point of vew of th invaironment is is a bad idea because spend a lt of a by persn .
h cties ar crowded and there ar a lot of pollution with noises ad oke .
A ew prbem is being in the small cities , because te are nt diigne to haor a lot of cars .
I thi ta the in pblem of the pblic transport is the infrastructure beween villages d small cities , beause they only xi between the get cities .
Some coutries hve a od net of intrastruture ad peope use then mainl , because he public trasport is cheaper than the car and mre quiky .
It is a problem of mentliy , if we had bor in a society that used the publ pranpo I thought that is the btter and we would use then ormaly .
In my ow ton , eope do n't use pblic transport , som months o th councl gave a public srcice bike a three months later he had to los it .
It is a pty .

I question mysl eeryay how can i survive in hi mades world ?
I do not ko ow to answer this quesion honesly but i guess i will ner know .
I think that pblc transport a a grea future because every time thee are more people h use it .
However , I thin it is very expensie but wih a decrae in the cot here woud be ore peopl .
oadays he a car is very expenve becue you have to y a ot of thinks .
Public transport wold ave more future if it ere better distributed .
Personally , I ue me public transprt but I hardly ever us privat tanspor
Baja California is gger han Aguascalientes for t beacs n ouist cities .

I think the car is more coveient f publi transport .
In h cr you do not ve a timetable to be rspected , yo 're fr to leave , to go ome wen yu want ... not si sill to snow , rain , cold .
d without tting stuck in a cty o eays for divers . on pblic transport there is the possibility tha y 're standing on the whole trip , thre is always a lot of people , is cod in the winter ad in the sumr it 's to hot .
trips ar longer on public rasport or by c .
although I do t kno if this would alway hoose the macne .
By reading the history , we can kno that soe disasters happned every he er of Jaiu .
n hee is no exction this year .
There happened several rious natural or man - made disasters in this year .
In Taiwan , a serious ir crash cause by th bad weather hppned irst .
A terribl explosion resulting from arlessness folwed .
A storm of od problems brok ot next .
In the global , up to the ar crashes which result frm bei hijacked or shot happened .
here were also conflicts between western countries n te SIS .
In my opinions , all of us r spposd to be careful abou l t detis whe we dl with everything to prevent disasters .
Additionally , l human beig shold stop fighting nd devte ourselves to pursug a peaceful orld .
Lst but no leas , we should do everyhing wh our conscience .
Hope ta h et year will be bete .
Frankly it seems tha the town th I have ben iving hav not tak care about the environment .
It is es to see when we walking around or hn we go to some lk .
In general we do n't take ae abou nothin , water , recyclabe things en our r conditionng .
This is suc a chronic pblem in all my country .
Here in Brazil is very difficult tae cr aot it bcase it deands serious ehaiour and skills frm our gorvernants wich unfortunatl wo n't happens in a short time .

An it 's funny and exciting to trel wt t gru by he bus .
Nowadays , eople a a stressfull live so we ca n't spend time waing for blic transpo .
We cn think that tre is no fuur for puic tranpor becaue ot of pepl use hei w car .
Usig yor o car yu can te h decision of wa timtble is mor convenient an wh w you are go to u .
It 's or cnortable go anyway it your own car , the problem is e pollution tt this life bring us , and lso the park rblem .
If everybody go it eir w r , hei have to park and abe h place is full .
ls , travellg by ca is so muh ore convenient because y do n't ave to go stopping in each tow , so using yur own town saves ti .
Nowadays , peole ar rally worie for tei js due to the big fnancial crisis in hich sm people are lo ther obs an other re workng in rubbish job for little money .
or all this , e uestion is to dfficlt to anwer .
In my pinio , h most importat is enjoy yr work becaus we spe an averg of nine hours in the office or in whatevr wk hat we wil do , as a relt if ou do n't eel comfortbe , ou life coud be a hel .
The truh is , tha h perecton oud be that all peoe old work in their dem jobs a of course , makin a lot of mney , ke for exaple Hollywood actors or football players but this is almost impossible .
In summary , for me , it is eter enjoy at work every ay , although you ve n a ig saly .
The most iportnt is wake up each ay ith a big smile and wor hard .
The soch trials is one of the best ims and thriller tat I av ever seen , it is so exited all the thn tat tey do to survive in e outside world wt all those peope that are infeced with a virus an the reason hy they t te in the gade r them to be inmune if sm sick person it hem .
one of the most amzig parts of h film is hn Teresa calls Cruel for go o the n take them again to the Cruel building ad like all of tem oe n't wanna go wih thm they srt a w and te ake ihno with them and at the end Thomas decide to go ate them and he give a supe great speech for a the persons go it th a help h to get back iho , and what i reall want to se in the ex im is tat if Thomas is mad at Trsa ( i never like he ) and if they gt free and he world comes ac to t nral world .

Rcently , I have sen he Taantino 's new film , Django Unchained , and I have to recognize ha I am looking foward to watch t next ne .
He took down every mistae he ad lst flm .
Fisly , Djngo Unchained remembered us te hard if uffeed by blk people in the past , due to a eat introduction witout daogues , where back people were uchined wil they cam back to be eling to an owner farm , it bing matching with an amanzing soundtrack as identity Tarantio 's films .
Nowdays , In mny country the youth loing or doing orts to be fitness and er active there are many sports to jo it .
On te other hand , ere are some aruments fo spt speally voleybll .
When I play vlleyball I totaly foet al my problems ad ocu on othing ut volleyball n the intensity of th game .this gam i like to play .
Te in of stress that pushes me to work harder in order to get good at wa I love .
In additi to is It pushes me to keep on tryg so that I can gt everything rght .
It 's l about will poer an th absolute want to get btte .
On he one hand , ther are aot of famous paye on olleybal who a Knee ligament injuries , Th most frequent mechanism of injury was andig from a jump in the attack zone .
In adition to this , Injuries wer mor frequent durg gmes han training .
In my opinion , Volleyball must then be considered amog ih - ik ports accoring to the fruency a gravity of our surgical fining.my advice or wo starts hs spo you will get fresh after you ly this ame nd mak you doing or rk in relaxetin way .
I elieve ther re numers possibilitis on public transport bcaue cars nd publc transport play completely diffent roles in our ociety .
First of l , pubic transpor robaby mes the demands of peple who harly or do n't use thir crs to travel .
In Japan , which has one of h largest poplation over 0s , many senior pele pefer to s buses to rs .
In ddition , a w genertion ppea and ey do n't own thei rs because of a few opportunities to ravel and hig cost of aing a car on their own .
Scond , pbic transport provides a quick ad easy way to vsit namiliar paces with us .
It is nt ecessary for us to know in adane how to get to h destination before the departure by usg public transort .
So it prevents us to open mps to cnfir every sine route .
Lasty , we can use less resources by using public transport .
When it comes to o environment , e us of transport could be a solution for reducing h emission of 2 .
Becaus of hese resos , I s a blight futre fr publc transport .
it is out of the uestion the tak car of the environment is regarded as turning pit in r life .
it is upsearm ha irrigates r economic if . and no doubt tt Negligence has the abiity to destro many good sides in or life .and our government is doing her et to p ed to negigence .
t we also us coparain to save or town . on the oter hand we must Presentation awreness prorm for l people .
and we must throw rubbi in t stree to ep th rea clan nd we must Maintain clean trees to kep he ae atracive thus we cn impoe Natonal inco by atracting mn people from otr town . ad we ms rn children tha clean is necessary f their health nd on their school they should thw rubbish on Waste askt an wo tow it on the grod Wll be unished . to tp it a we ca n't go witot Cleanlnes of our town .
Natural environment destroyed tt is a pple ocus on frequntl problem .
ay countries build ore and mor buildings ffet peoe quality of lie .
Seting up or large uiling can destroed people nd animals ie environment and om animals maybecan xtiction .
Govrnmens should do some measures to dal th uid more buiings ll dstroy te ecological environment .
There is no future f pblic traspor , becasue travllig by car is so uch more convenien .
I 'm n aree abaout thi stateent becasue in a bg cities there ae a lot of cars , if all people in a city use hi own c at th sme time , there wl be a huge traffic , so travelling by car is n't much more convenent in this sitation .
Tere e more robles in bi ctes , one of hem is parking , there are a lot of ares in a cit ta is vy difficult to park , and o only av 2 otios , you cn par in a private parkng nd a a ot of money or you ca ast ou te searching f a place of pakin .

Is hsical Education necesary at schools ?
First of all , It is tr that not all the pople like do sports because hy ar eavy an a i stressful too .
We can also a that there re ther subjts mr important han Physial Education , like Boogy or History .
However , Physical Education is necessry becuse maks peope es la .
Desite th fact that sports are hevie , doors are alway saying that sports imrovs our health .
Schols hav Physical Eductions or teach this good habi since our childhood .
In conclusion , Physical ducation are necessary at school becuse spots improve ur health and make us feel good d healthy .
I would lke to ae a reservation f t next onh , fro 2h may till 2th ( 4 nights , Double room ) bu I have dous abot bookin policy .
I mean , after reading the tems ad epoit policy , I derstand I must a the frt night at t booking time an h et of the stay it would be paid upon arria to the fnt des .
Plu , in case I cacelled the reservaton 48 r before arrva it would charged the 5% of the full stay .
I unerstan ti part , but in se I have to cancel the resevation , ho should I do it ?
By pho , by mail or on yr website .
To bein with I would li to a ht don a sport is very iportant to keep us thin and healthy .
My favourite port is swiming because it is the oe I have been practiing for a long time ag sinc I was a kid .
I ke swimming becae it is a spor that mkes me work l my bdy and it is ao a really complete sport .
Nwadys it is rall importnt to know w to sim because hen we are in oldays we spend most of our time in the wter at the swmming pol or even at the ea .
I ike oer sports sc as footall nd volleyball too .
I wul ie the adce ha ti sport mke people healthy ut it also hel us to make new iends beaue wie we ar traing we av aes in r team which we can talk to n ae hem o friend .
Othewie it is a sport where you do not have contact with our friends what hlps no to make ijurie .
To onclude , I think this is a real god sport to start with when we are a little child to in exprience and year afte year becoming better nd imprvng .
No wonder if we ay that sport is so impotant .
It keeps ur bodies in good conditon .
Atually there e o knds of sports .
Frt one is inivdual sports d in ts kd you practice yor game alone nd o e th nl play on ur tam .
Second kind is team sports .
In this kid , you are one of t te and all the team play as a on perso .
A lthough soe people prefer idividuIal games , but I prefer team games .
ecuse it teach as the meing of cooperation ad leadership .
ea sports are ve important and they iclue a lot of kinds .
My favourite team sport is football .
I lay football every day ith my friends at club .
I found ootball interesting because it teac us a l of orals suh as coopeation and onest .
I also can g fn wit my friends when I play it .
I think it is t mot ineresting sport
Famus people efinitey esrved to ae a privte life without journalists following te all the time .

Actully I have to admit , hat , fm stars , politicians and ohr famous people have to count on fame .

They ca n't complain , because it 's the w of life they hoos .
In my oinion , eveyone deservs for clmnes .

What a piy , tat you hav't en her .
If I knw about the thing beoe I wld ivie all my mates .
It ally as amazing , I thin , it was a breakthrough in my perception of music .
What 's more , I did n't have to y for he ticket , eause it was a volunteer work - closing te dr after people that were ming out of th concert hall .
h god thing but it was the fc , that th band(actully I en do n't remember it 's name)wa playng with so mc pason , hat no o prbaby even think about leaving the place .
In a word , doing nothing wa the big advantage of ts kind of wok .
There wr many ings tha just stunned me in o moment , we he bnd started to lay ...
First of ll , Balkan music turne t to be oe of the mst irresistible inds I have ever heard .
In my opinin music lie th shld be diplayed oe fen in the rio ad ther ms med .
The ba thing out it is that te band is t popular , and nt man eole hae ever heard about it .
Mass eda do ot ant to introduce thi kid of musi , probably because it would displace t maistream - o mic .
See you soon !

pot is an important fr all of us becus it hels us avoiding diseas , and becoming healhie .My favuort spt is swimming .So praciing is ki of spo is the best beause it heps me feeli fresh n relax .
Mreover , daily excrsise is vr gd da which heps us to aoid overweight an to keep your ody healtier .So I alwys want to adise pole to practise this spor or other kind of ports to avi diseases .
Two movies .
Drig h ast mohs , we could see a hug numbr of e moies issed by an fmos uopean and American majors .
The two I have enjyed e most ar " The wolf of Wall Stet " d " The Secrt life of Walter Mit " , or more simply " Water Mitty " .
The irst o is basclly sed on a true story of te min character , a finanal broker , who is ated by the famous Hollywood actor Leoardo di Capro ad on how he become rich by reakig t rules and speculating on th stock exange mrke .
I would efine it an action ove .
lter Mitty instead deals with the fantstic sto of the man character , an archivist , whose lie will ben changed completely wen the comay he works for is aken vr by o of t competitors .
Walter Mitt is acted by an exellent Bn Stiller , now arrived at th to of h career as acto .
Far from th noisy and reality of The Wl of Wall Sree , Walt Mitt offers to th audiece a delcious portrayal of te ain charctr 's lif a adventures , hrouh which he will discover hs true sef n will restart a nw li .
Although resnting a more vivacious plot , The Wolf of Street is n bl to keep the attention of te audience like Wler Mit des .
I mt say tha Te secret dream of Walter Mitt is a wel - contructed mov at I strongly rcommend to ayone who wol spnd a ret eving wtchng an entertaing ovi .

It is udoubtedly tr ta in today 's modern wold people commut to wk mstly by their private vehices .
It sees more convnint to them to move on thir own rather han tied to a pblic transport .
It ca be rgued tha pubc transort ystem s been loosing its popuarity in ma ways .
People fe tha they an get to ter destintion on time if ty drie their own car .
It is true in many ases as public transport like bues , trains and trm ha their own specific otes and stops .
his may ause pole in gettin late to heir particular destnaion .
Secondly , publc transport sems to be ong expensive ay by day which has reduced its popularity .
Peopl hereore fid crs more affordabe or them .
In moder society cars ave become mo heaper to b , hch in tu as hled peole to have th .
Moreover , any car finance companies ave made it easy o eery indiviual to purchase the car .
In conclusion , i old say that d to recent avancments in ocety , there has been a considerable increase in the car ownership .
It c therefore be predcted sily that there will be no role of ublic ranport in th futue .
I tik that when you want to get famous becuse of oething that you do ( for example : writig msical ) you hae to ccet what comes th it .
It 's tru tat sometmes paparazzi cross he line and ivde her privae properties which I fd awful .
Howeer , there a ls ose ind of pple hat get amous o dng nothn or us being rich as it 's the case of Paris Hltn .

Dar S/ Madame ( director the film eartment )
I am rting this letter , becase the lt week I read a otie in our STUDENT FILM UB magazine about a movie or thille that I like it and I can advise you .
Wl , last Sunday , I ent to th cinema a I watched THE TIANI , pehas the movie counts us , h tyial story t rich rl falls in lov it th or boy .
But he et of all for me is e sinking of he ship , when it el wn to bottom of the ocean .
the il exlins us ho happened the fact of h same way that in e near XIX century .
The director has wanted to mke te story the best el possible .
He explains us the building of te si , why it sank , w it stood in th ottom cean a how te people helped them n to others .
I reall like the begiing of te movie , because we cn see he ship hen it w really nw , with their hai , table and aoher urniture .
In my opinion I think th e love str is closed to explain btte the sinking .
I look forwa to earing from you .

Wking holidays broad
Introduction
e ai of ts repo is to sare e experience of different students who h been working abroad uring the summer .
In order to do so , I onducted intrvews wh 30 university students .
Pros
Evey single one of thm said hat if y work abroad , you will improve your English a lot inc you will be listeing and seaking it al d .
In addition , another dvantage is tht by worin a summer y can earn some money fr or persal expenses .
Cons
However , almost ever student confessed having et omesick despi the fc tat they ade a large mout of frieds thee .
Aothe rawback is that unless o a raly motivae , it will be difficlt o you to adapt to a new city .
Conclusion
Even if tere r some disdvanages , most studets aged tt this is an amaing experience o to be mised .
All in all , I suggest encouraging student to fin a job abroad during te summer .
there e few this hic I am very keen and passionae of , in the whol world .
one of these it 's surely my sport .
I hve ben pacticin swimmng pool since I was six years old , n I am twny one . this should o lt yu stay without a lu of how much I are bou my hobby .
is is not ju a sport t an extraordinry thing I do in the odinar life , in th eveyday lf .
he I am tired , stressed , depressed , frutratig , sick of he pasin fancies or fake friends , there is jus one hig hat is able to ae me fe better nd sap out of it : tis is , of course , wimming .
So I lt myself drop in the wate of t pool , d as soon as I am completely submerge , all the problems , adnes and heaviness of life uddely disapear , ad that 's the most aaing emotion i uld ev try .
If I d to suggest a sport to do fr children , I would recommend it because hethr it akes everyne be in shape , it is healhy d guratee an uppe level of wealth .
I dvise the parents to let h children ben swiming as soon as they n , proded tey ae interested in it .
It is no worth sayng each ne should follow their assion .
I 'll fnsh saying that evn when I as young if my fahr had asked me if I would ha rather go to a swimming ce or to a cand fair , I would hve urely chosen te ist e .
I find it diffult to have a healthy w of life curenty .
ist of all the nvironent is contaminated a thee substance ge to us by atr , ir , food ... alo the clothes .
We ca n't avd electromgnetic wve arond , alhoug we were living in the outry or f rom he indutries .
If you ant to live ith helh , you mut understand it an try to choose betwn the few rel ptons you ave in your hands .
The main adve it would be to have a balned die : a lo of fruts d vegetables , few fats , to ink ore atr , et .
Then it is ve important to xercse bcaue your body nd your mind nee movement .
If you do n he enouh time for exercise every dy you can me little efors : do not use t lift , use the sars or al eey time yu can .
B the ms important thing f hing a healthy fe is to be uie , not fe stres .
Nowadays we av a hurres lves bu we must to and live ur lives t .
Yor health needs clm , fiendhip , happiness ... You us ke in conact with your friends and to spend time with yourself ( do o forget yo hobbies ad learn n ings ) and you famiiy .
I hin it would be t bes advice .
It is knwn that Iternet makes things aier thn ever nd an be se for everything .
Sme people believe that we ca n't en live withut it .
One of the advantages of e Internet is tt we a meet new peop around t wrld an make riends without taking face to face .
ere are plenty of webs hat can search peple , meet em ad ch with te same interests n commons you ike .
I have very gd friends thanks on te nternet .
However , ther ae a lt of malicious software arond the Interet and you must be aware .
Yo do n't have to do the sil or illeal things , bcaue you will be eposed to this maliious sofare .
In addtio , hat software is reated by nasty people that creates this virs to damge othe popl computers .
In my opini I must express e falities given by e Internt .
It 's all so eas with it and usef , f example you ca oer a pizza to ae to your home
To um up , I 'm totally aree with making friends through the Inenet .
Did you ko that you brain is eercied whe you rea y boos ? ou shoul ra h topc that y prefer like ews , sports , novels , economcs , ealt , fitnss , fo , cooking and you can coos the material that it 's sy and enoyabe to read lie novels , magazines , newspapr , technical books and something like tht .
y do I eommend it ?
Whe o have fiished your studies and ou av gote a j where every a you do h same activities , he brain dos n't ok hard ad you might hav some prblems like forget ord , dates , information that you had earned a e yea o because or memory wo n't work in e same wa .
I think tat your ran is ie ou by , ey th need exercie to be ctive an the way to gt it is reading omething .
I 'm sure if you read or listen to audio ook js 1 ho very day , you are ong to eel a change qucky . I kw that getting rading habits is dificut , but you tat to do it , yu wo n't be be to t eouh of thm ad y will read o pleasure .
Finally , if yo get eaing habi you 're gong to orgaize bter your ideas and you ay feel mr energtc , if yo do n't bliev me , st try it .

It has been a log time since I watched a thriler , but I do member that I atced Th Huger Gmes pat 1 , and I recommend all t Hunger Gms films .

I thnk you are goin to ie th becus u like tht kd of mies nd als they are worth the while and ou are ot going to rget it .
Another thille that is reall good is h cabin in the woods , that movie is reall entertaining , and scary .

Ths buildng is situated in Barceloa , althouh it 's ony a short walk from he magnificent Gaud 's artwork it is n't as famous as thm .
When e Civil War ended , the country s compltely dstroed and eope had nothng to eat .
Particularly in Barcelon , th troub wa th they oul fi on th sea but here was n't an aproppia place to kee it so they cold n't a ne or o day aer .
That situation mu have been terrile for he population but fortunately , there is ways a posible oluion .
A grup of fishers began to wk arun the ciy loking for a god plce here th would have rought their fish .
Finally , they found an ld destryed palace and hy decided to uld the their wn " fish 's shopping centre " .
Neighbours helped the to mk the uilding and ater a few nths , th bgn to s it .
This is a great example of how Spash poplation could go on wh their lie wokig together without governmet 's help .
Nowaday , the building h ben become a luxury ma wt t mt expense brnd clothes .
However , th structure h been kept in ordr to visitors can enjoy ts popular arcitecure 's jewel .

Nowadays , it is mre and or opula to take a year off eween school an unvrsity .
In fact , it is an importan decion .
You sat ie on your own , make your wn decios and plan your future .
It has an advantaes and disadvantag as wel .
On t one hand , there r a large amount of teenages o have no idea r ther fuure .
They do n't kw which uiversty ad field of studying chos .
During a gap year you have the chance to consider all the issues connected with or future .
You have enough tim to try to use your capabilitie and at th same me discover your own calling .
Besides , there are a reat nube of people wh graduated school but do n't hve enough money to continue tir education .
The er off ges h apportunities to gt a j .
In he bginnin it wod be a simply d without ih wages job ut you oul gt sm eerience .
What 's more , you a s this time to travel a rela .
You an gt to ow other countres nd new individuals .
On th oer hand , I can ee also ngatve aspects of taking a year off .
Y start yur study later omparatively with your frend .
It would be more difficult to tar your own life by neelf .
It is also a poit hat en u do n't exeue what u antd to dring a ga year , y are in the same plce when y wee grauating school .
To s up , I tik that taking a yr ff is an importa decision you should gie it a tought bfore you fnall deie .

Ye , I believe that levision entertains nd al eductes .
Watching quz programs ar a main way to educate oneself .
We g to kow aout so ay facts on a uiz show .
atching history channel givs us reat inforatin abou the history of earh .
athing national geographical or discovery channels tkes us into a old of nimal wee we get to see numerous wild animal a their characteristics whh are really nterestin .
Daiy watching nes on television enlighten us on what 's happeing aound te orld .
Being aware of current affair are important in our ie .
here are also many disadvantages of television .
The are plenty of entertainment programs which just consume our time with no ther benefits .
It 's rally depressing to see kids being engross in soap operas or soe ueess rality shows or crtons .
Entertainments a a must , veyone ould take te f rom her busy or heti shedule .
But it should be in a moderate lvel .
If everyone uses elevision wisey , it can do mr ood ha bd .

Fr disabe people thee suld be expanded services to giv hem ay mbilty .
or couples who hv babies ther shoul be baby care srvics .
There should be a r which is 24 hous opened .
The hotel should have a inlusve concep so before people go fo holidy , hey could clculate their costs .
In the case of workers , I ould like to ave acomodation ven by h copay .

The most imprtat aspect at e hotel should have , it soul be oend whole yar , not only in he summer .

Cyberschool ave en atemptng to present heir new project called cberschool .
Cybercool is when students receive
lessons to her computs by their teacher .
This new way of teachi pupils h eceied a ix esponse .
Firstly , being at schools wih lots of other chlden in a clas deelops your socia sils , but learnig at hom , makes you ose cotat it oter .
en yu do the lessons , you have noboy to ct to it about .
Als , staying regulal on the computer is a way to t glasss .
Electronics are bad for our eye .
Some individuals migt even bcom coputer ddicts due to te me they spend on teir PC .
Let 's see .... 6 nd a quarr hours of schol plus an exta 30 minte o homework ..... ht is 6 and thre quarer hours on the couter .
hat is more than a quarter of the me in a a !
It 'll be en moe if he student pay gams or do somethng els on he PC .
Penutimate , ter has en a suden se in obesity because of this e poect .
Travelling to chol at least inclues 1 eer of wakig , nevertheless staying at home don wrk on your PC mak yo less active nd health .
Schools provide you wth ealth food despite h fat we 'll us at anything we wnt at home .
Finally , I ersonally disagree it cyberschol .
It 's unheathy and dangerus .
Cyberschol are n't interested in health and safety issues !
o hat thy are bac home , Pauna found out ha h mom as in town , so by instinct he eided to go and visit her , as well his brther tat s ee eaing her because se taunted hm by being in love wt his best frind , they e n't together anymor , but that w uch a devastating thing .
Gnuinly se kne , at begging hi was n't noug , so by going to their old house as a surprs wol be at east would giv he the chance to cnfont nsead of makng a chos bout it , despite this insinificant fraud sh knw hr m would be really apy to se her daughtr .
She call Jimm nd told hm where she was going , but Jimmy i n't answer since he was at wrk , so she ef a voice message .
The conditi of e publc transport is etting worse ay by da .
Tee are only limitd numbers of overnmet buses on the ra and tei frequency are not good so tey get overcrowded .
People board tse bues t of copusion as tey ae to rach office on tie .
On th other an , metro seric is a good edum of transportation , it goes over h road so you do n't g traffic .
The waiting time is minimum , yu t a tran in very 3 to 5 mnutes .
e re of the ero ran is almost equal to the ther transport eas .
The only flaw of metro ervice is its unavailability in remte areas .
Afer a ew kiometer , u il id a b stop u Metro stations re built ony in mjor rea .
So een if yu trvel through metro , u have to tae a bus or ato to eac yu destination uess it is located ner a mto staton .
People w are rih prefe to travel by ther o cr as hy can take an rut and ive as pr thir cnveniece .
In pubic transport man eope do n't get a et n hv to stand throughout the jurney , it is very exauting especially in a long journey .
While in a private vehil ou can si comfortaby a enjoy ou jurny .
If we ke out te cost acto , tee is t a singe rean fr anyone to travel through public transport .
Many crms such as pickpocketing , ee easin , vilnce , etc tke plac in pulic transport .
It has been an easy taget of terrrsts to plt bombs , so if yo are traeing through a s , you accept th risk .
Everyone ca no afford a car so public transport wud be there bt in future as well but fewer people will use it .

Television crrently occupies a very impotant role in entertainment , howeve , o of the problems that ocety has facd since television became pouar is that it is a ditrctor in ecation .
It is believed , there are ways to make TV c lp educate .

In addition , any of the educatioal programs are no tansmitted by broadcast eleviion and peoe witot cable system , have no access to hse .
So the TV could becoe a usfu tol in t educational process if mor effort is put in this , from th tlvision programming to the pefernce of society-
It is argued tht whether the gernment or teachers have t right to deermine wha subect houd be taught in schools .
In my opinion , althogh ther ae oe advantages if teachers were responsible or this task , I believe that the govrnment is re suitable to la this mission .

Public transport is still itl par of scity and shuld remin as it is .
If everyone stat using car for raveing ; the roa wo n't be enough to everyon as there are sve bilion peple in t word ; and vn or environment it is better to use as ess as possible .
On t of tat , fuel consumption old be too high as we av limited avaiability of ul resources .

Everyone should think bot it which is ealy vital o the society ; a specially t intenatonal bd shod do something out it to motivate pople to e public transport as much as possible .

Secodly we all know that e public transort is cheaper than th private trsport .

Publc Transport with no Future
Ee thoh there have be man efforts to ak pole use their c less , we hav to mit that this battle is aread lost .
Since most of hese puli ransprt amendments have been emedial rather tan something pland foreseeing ftre problems , they have nly been of limited hlp ad , therefore , they have oly wore for some time .
Ti has resulted in ony the very in - need people usi public transport , and the vast mjority of people still s their persnal automovile , with t incvemiences a sety eig an excse .
Indeed , using public tranprt is nt only unae n uncomfortable , but als unhealthy .
On ca n't imagine how many ers ( vir included ) lay on a and bar waiting f a skin to rush in .
Only inking of a mks me azy .
So , little by little , ad as coomic conditio of eopl improves , plic transport will eventually disapar .
At first , I hv to admit ta I hate any kn of sports , because I know I 'm not oo at em .
In he pst , I tid to pl basketball , tennis , in pong and so on , but he outcme mae me depressed and less confdet .
Howeve , ater I came to Ne Zalad , I found a special sport whch dos n't ne any abiiy , trekking .
Th igest bnefi of trekking is tht you can joy fantastic view fo h summit of mouains .
Aso you ar ble to choose a place to go depend on hw you feel .
Epecialy in New aland , there a some beautiful islads and you an get to them by fery easily .
If you ae interested in trekking , you should buy wtr - proof clothes just in cae .
If you do so , You do n't have to be worried abt bad eather n mo .
Do n't foret to brn sm drink as el .
In sm lac , you will find difficulty in finding it .
To conclude , trekking is one of the most enoyabe sots even for eple do n't like spts like me .
t 's tart trekking as soon as possible , otherwise you il miss oppotuity to see fbulous scenery .
During th last decad , t numer of as sed in bg cies a incresed steadily . Proportinlly , air pollution and deaths associatd to raffic aidents have lso augmented .
One way to reduce tose negative consequences is to foster te e of public transport .
However , there is a great ebte on whetr hs is really a od soluion .
Pubic transport is a more efficient wa of using energy .
It mves more people per liter of oi ued and cotaminates a sal fraction of what it would had been if evey assenger had traveled usig an individual car .
Hwver , publc ransort lacks some advntages ol foud hen usn ou own car .
ntead of taking your sa righ home , u ed to go to a more or es a place in der to take a pubc transport , and wait fr the time it is scheduled to arie .
e acon has to be epeatd whn y lve the us or trin at th ed of your jouney .
One thing which we could be sure is that e world is chaging ut pulic tranpot xisted in he past an wll be in th future .
Firt poi , which I oul lik to menchioned aot is co .
You ned to spnd a ot of money wh you nt to u it , wh yo an to insurance it and use it .
Cars ar n't chep and if you hin ht is easier to mve orm n place to anothe whn you have a car , you hve t a point but hre is a lot of considerations which yo should ocur lik : a , nsurance or parig cost .
Moreover , u sould recon about cofort during he trave .
Whe you rivin by the car ou shoud be focus on h ro , you need to thik what could happen , what the othr drivers nt to do and which wy ou shoud choe .
at could be frustrating speciay when u have log oad ad you need to spend long hours divig .
Finaly , the word conviniend f everyone means something dirrerent .
Fo o ersn that uld be option yaht u hv car which is prked aong our road or on you divay and on a tme o could go whenever ou want , fo th oer ha old be pleasr that they cud noy e ri without thinking about n car 's sues , Tey are fitful that they could mt ome ne pople a take prt with others life .

Ma of us hang out togehe during weeens a they hv ecme a group , ie me d my other the close friend , but al " best fred " .
We sually eet tee times a year all ogether to eat a pizza in e ity cnter .
Aother advantage could be teache : thy ar quite stic somtimes but he mak us studying hardr ad this is nt so easy to do with teenagers .
But the most imprtat one is at if o are too red or tie yo an ook out ove a gret sight of uri or muntais fr a las ' window .
But tere ar om disadvantages lk stirs becase we ae at te secod floo . We would like to keep it bt we hv to use too man strair to reach our classroo nd tat 's so annoying somtims .
We share the floor with anothr school and it ha a different tietable ad t bll rings 10 minues before n it makes me confused but I eally li 4B and I oul n't change it .
Are te the es invention ? : Cars
At the sart of the 20th entry , almost no - body ha a ar .
Nowdas , amost everone hs a car !
But is tis a good ting or a bad thing ?
Ca c be useful for severa rasns .
Frsly , they allow us to travel fast by ad , mostly to the exact lac we wan to go .
Furtherore , travelling by a is a vey comfortabe way of tranprt .
For isance we can use cars dio to listen to me rlaxing music , or sten to news whil aking ou way to te plae we want to go .
As y may be concerned , cars ae vry useful but the aso have some disadvantages .
Noadays people ar depending on them o much .
Cs are being used ven wh not ecesary .
In addition , crs ave be increasin the world cron missio and ha causs the ' Ozone Layer ' to th down .
Finaly , f u cr to work , we need to fill them with fu , hich is expensive .
To sum up , cars ve advantages but , on the ther had , the can aso reat prolems .
In my opinion , crs are one of the best and ms useful inventions .
Unfortunately we shold be careful wth e way we s tem .

Ad s wele yars old , a clever boy in hs shoo , always gets te top marks and participate in ms activiis , known r ll te teachers and stdents .
He lso participted in the chol football team n w the state lub .
Despite l previous hings Adam wa alone , has no friends in schol or in abbeywood street in Queenlnd here he lved in Australia an Adam a very annoyed abot tht nd what ake it worth a boy called Johnn who had nsultd him d Aa id n't wan to he a fight ith hi .
two eks lar , Adam began to mke some friends t rom his ad luck , ey wr n't vry od friends , they used to mak roubles nd do n't do the ho work in time .the boy wre Fernando and Lus in ter sevnh ear in shol as Adam .
The ah teacher in school Mr Michael was a ve good teacher wh take cre of cldren in cool .
He realized Ad 's mrs are getting low ad he invlved in some roubles in chool and began to invetigat im .
In the final exam Mr Michael caugh dam cheating and inor e shol 's maager wo suspeded Ada from al other eas d ford i to eeat the year .
In mattr of fact Mr ichael should ae povided some dvice r Adam wh his mak g low u he idn't , an the consequences wer ver bad so , Michael cloed t dor d know at ta omen he h mae a mistae .
I liv in big cit , th cpital of Spain , so thee re different ransport .
I prefer to use t tain or the tu , because they e punctual and because the are a signs were you c s the time ess .
Aso , evy thee or fou inutes you can get on th train .
There are buses o , but I do o like em . Depend on the dot , thr ae traffic problems a u must wat a ong tim in a us stop .
I am fo a small island wre nly there is a form trnspor : the bus .
I am from a lttle town ad I ust wait n hou to go to he city center .
It is awful if you do not have a prvat trnsport .
I prpose to use feer cas .
I ko hs is t easy but tere is an eclogical and cheap transport : e bicycl .
For shor ditane it is a good ay to do xercise and to avod cotaminatig .
Of course it is not a way fr long distance , b sep to ep , the trfic problems ill improve .
For lmost th etie durato of " Now yu see me " , I was confused .
B let me tel you that I as cofused in e best way , nt becuse it a rather wacy bu because hapened unexpece .
her 's no question hat this fim by direcor Louis Letrrier is the ot original n thought - provoking stories I ve ee in recent yers .
In fat , he box - office hit en it was released d t film went on to gross over 35 million .
e plt revolves arnd an FBI squd o face , in a game of t an mouse , a tea compounded of t best four illusionits .
The ae called " Te ou Horsemen " .
Thy carried ou a series of daring roberies against corupt busies leader drng thir performance , sharn ut e slen mony wh their auienes .
As fr as the torline is oncerned I have to say tha the film is eally as - oing .
Regarding acting , taking in acoun that it is a b - budget fl there is no much to a .
It is farly well lyed by acto , su as , esse Eisenberg , Morgan Freen who play teir rl pefecly , making the im light - erted .
If I have to stand ut ny wekess I wl y that is a i predictle .
t me xplain it .
As it is a mvi related to magic tricks en a sequnce is playe a it see simple and esily understanable you kn tt , indeed , it is not .
If o do n't like flms that mae yo think , this film is o for o .
On t ohr hand , if you are ookin for a il hat is extrmey gripping nd can keep u guessing , it 's defntely the right choice or you .
We must edue exm sress from hig school sudent .
Eam sres leads to many bad conseqencs towars gh School Stuent .
Thee consequences vary , one exmple would be that stuents may ge lower grads on their xams , or en fa tem .
hy can also have cnstan oo chnges a high levels of nervousness , since te may have lost any hours of seep whilst studying for a certin em .
As a esult , many ih Scool Students a not cncentrate during clsses , or whst studying since ty have may things on oing throg their ads ( since they 've be studying a lot ) .
Based on l the pobems listd ( and many more ) , we ust find solutions ht ill hep both student nd prossors to de ith exam sress .
e of the solutions I wul give is to hand in tuy ides to the studen .
This will help them as a mtho to study or revi for the exam and redue ther lees of stress .
T study uide does n't need to necessarily be a on and omplex one ( ince those may use them tress too ) ; they may be ut a quk revew wi a cple of coepts and exercises .
Anther simple sution I tnk coul help is to study as wl as to review content during sessios before a cerain exam , to hep the students tdy whlt stl having a class .
The previous re te st possible solutions I woul addres in order to stop once a for all t proble of ress thanks to exa , in which most of the cases , as e previous aragraph explained , leas to many more .
he I ws a child I used to spend thousands hours playing football , nywhre I cold .
Always dreaming becoming a gret player , playing in a stadim roded , apping teir hands looking at what I d th the al .
When I grew up I realize sooe tn late , at I ill never be nor a good either a bad player , and they sai ta I was one of the orst plays ever lid .
Then I dcided to study eninering and becoming one the best enineer eer .
Long ater that d such I s a natual talent abou engeneering , I gan to wrte ooks and essays abu everything realted with my job .
Life becoming biger more and more .
Today ou need more than wh u needed yestery .
People looking fo comfortable esy if .
We a l looking for that without reat diffiulty or effort nd one way to achieve this goal is to study abroad .
Many students today like to study abrod to get hih leel of life to ge tir fe job and experience a ne wy of life .
Studying abad can enhance empoyment oportuniies .
companies are looking f ell eucate eope ih a good experience to re d stuents mre likly to i hei choices .
it your ertifiate you an easily fine a job .
Universities re so a ich ple for bg pprtunity to ge ther if you hv studed abroad .
You a work at a university as a lecturer nd get a high slay .
Students who go to study in another country expeince a variety of lfe .
They met ne people and make friends th students from differnt countries .
Try nw food in competely differnt places .
hey can explore cities in weeeds or acdmic breaks .
Learn h to do everting by themselves a bcoe independent .
To u up , studyig aoad is a geat chace to g a gret job as u av higher education with much ore experiencs .
oreover , yo can learn man tngs an pand or knowledge , hve friends from different bagrounds .
Dea Paco ,

Dear editor
I 'm writing in resonse to te announcement in Internatinl Spots Monthly .
I would lie to say that my favourite sport is biwatching .
I know ha this is something srage but I really enoy it .
To begin th I am interested in birdwatching becase om when I as ong nd I wat to be a biologist en I gr up .
Brdwathcin relly relax me and brig me closer to he nature .
Furthermore I enjoy being able to recogni te difernt spees of birs .
If someon wns to start birdwathing , I tik he shou be ntereted in birdwaching first .
Ts mean tt if he doe n't like it , he will efinitely give up immediaty .
So if someon really wt to birdatch , he should firt know hat speces of bds there are in the aa that he ives .
en he should y a ai of binoculars or a teescoe .
To sm up I believe birdwtching is a rell exciting srt bt o ust like it to sart it .
pots or hobbies could be geat options lik e activities in rder to plan in my colle , howver I believe there are oths which cold be provided o us and it would be iteesting to tak part in .
Do n't you kw to say in e presence of a hu audence ?
Are you nrvous when you have to speak on public ?
The n activity which I hae thought it could be organised nd it culd hve sucess is calld " The Clb of dcussion " .
It et us improving our hearing d speaking skills .
In additio , it could be nteresting although you do n't ave to do hysical actitivy , ecuse of yur cpaciy to redaction a seech , uppor an idea , hv a connected speh il be got better in this kind of activity .
at 's mr , it des n't requre a specific place to tak plce in , it cou be trying nwhere .
I tink tha the llur of his acivit is you cn meet a l of popl and share with he tht experiecs .
Moreover , I thnk that it should beoe a reality because the field of the activity is so broade and it could be useful in other plenty scpe even in you daily rutne .
In concluson , making a speech contributes on our social relsionshps and it alows us to define our ersonaity .
I thn ha my college mt provide an actvty wich is foused on th social abiliie and it taces you how u must spek in front of a mutitude , and wh no cld be tis ?
Da Lucy ,
Thank r your last ettr .
I am gad to ndrstood tht everything is OK about u .
I am vry grateul tt you will he me th seachng oe iformation bout collgs in nglad .
Actually , I am interestd in scence , esecilly area btween chemtry a physis .
Alo , it wll be interesting f me tuition , whh refers to blogy and ifluence in dfferent nd of chemial compouds over t human bd .
You know tat I h leart biotechnology at school in Bugaia .
Please , heck for me , whc colleges provide these subjecs and when ey trt .
I want to kw if it is availble a grant .
If so , what is th criteria for giving it .
Last , u not least , what is h fee ? I want to find a college , which is not so expensive .
Thans a l f your support !
rite to me as on as possbl .
Best wishes ,

Customer satisfaction is much great when he gets service which a value or quality much geater than he epeced .
If service meets oly the epectation and does o provide anything ore tan it , mes cutome satisfction is there but customer would t fe great .
If servi is nt meeting expectation of h custoer or i quality just low expected , it uses customer disstsfaction .
Tis wll esut in consequeces suc as ngative feedback .
In this context it can be conclued that 78% of he esondents are satisfied with bo e usomer services of builds and results of Vasthu .
Rest of the respondents ave positive feedbak .
The factors which hinders other respondents rom givin very ositive feedbac a be eihr dissatisactin cause by custoer servie or failue of meeting rslts of vash to their epectatons .
I like wtching movies a l .
It is one of my avourite free im actvitis .
I ie a kin of movies . Cmedie alwys make me laugh and I like it .
Also , I et rm th rouie while watching it . I c lax and st watc , laugh and tlk to my frends .
Anthe reason y I like comedies , there is a wide variety of this in if oves .
Y can cose wh yu want to watch .
Personaly I , atc a comedy movi almos every evening .
It make my od ette an I fal asleep while watchng it .
I reond to te rticle " White House cals or ' genuine choice ' in Hong Kong eleions afr petion attrcts 0,000 signatures " on SCMP .
I feel sa ad angry to no that 0,000 Hng Kon eople uport this webse .
ey re sho sighted and seems ht ty are brn - wash by radical dmocracy houghts .
People who signed in the website were coludin orein pows to sppress our ow coutry , China .
I think this is traitrs ' action .
The do not have asic loyaty to their ow ountry .
ing foreign pwrs to threaten China is a in of unwise a .
Hg Kongers , bng a Chinese , shold no inhii our own country , with othr countries .
In fact , hina will no be moved by tis , and this wi aggravte h contadictio betwee Hong ng , Cin and he US .
China has he per and freeo to decide th way to settle the diste .
The US n ter countries hould ot drupt it .
It is better t to interfere t internal politic affas en they do t kno lots aut Chin 's olitic condtons .
The US is relly a busybody .
As we a kow , Occupying Cetal is illeal .
he US is spporing this illegal ativity indirecty .
T US always keep " re by law " as eir catchphras , bu Occpying Cntal is betraying t Hong Kong aw .
So it is ery strange for US to say " rule by law " when they suport Occupying Central .
In Occupying th Wal Street , the US id not sees to be mu oe peaceul than Tiananmen Massacre .
Accorng to Wiki encycopeda , BI called th occupir as " teorist " d decided to suppess the dipute as settln terrorist tack .
So the US h no qualification to crticie Chia .
Apart om this , he president eection in te US is fl of unfiress .
I do n no if there is filter fo president candidates , I jut knw that th balots e conted in sate .
The are dfferent umber of reidnts in diffrent stts , but it uses the taes to represent the residents . I do n think the election is ai enough for the US to ask for " real democracy " o Hong ong .
Is t US eally arget to get on Kong ito a demoacy ar ?
I thin o , bt a democrac " country " .
Afer Hong Kong ges " ral emocracy " , th US wil dve on ng to be independet .
The US lwas target on dividing China into mny sma , weak cunries , then it can brea up a cpetitor of itsel .
And it can even occy the broken China to ge interest in it .
et us see counties at the US introdued " democracy " to it .
Egypt , Iraq , Libya , Syria , there ere chaos fr " democracy " everywhere , ad the nx , might be Hong Kong .
I am afraid that Occupying Central would lead to cas that similar to Tunisian Revolution .
The signatr collecion of the Whie Hou now eded .
hna h not take ny furthr action .
I realy oe Hon Kongers that iged in he wesite could think again wt ty we doing a ow harful it is to China .
And I realy think the US could stop pckin on hin .
Learning an ideas and knowing deaied fact bo ar considered rucal for suents education .
Sm people think ha knowing ft is mo easl and pratiable .
Nevertheless , ohrs onider erning idea ad conct is the es w to confront many cademic and real - fe prolms .
In my ew , l completly gre with t idea ht it is important to studes to learn iea and concept than ear acts .
I would li to expain my reasons .
First , learning facts n help students to soe oe id of polems that thy may ace .
However , ides and concepts ie people competitive edge in daling wth othr similar issues .
For example , once I do n't grp an idea tht my teacher have explained in ass , t just remembr facts .
When I do my homework , I in t problem is different than the cs discussed in e cls .
Whe , I go bk to my tetbook a try to relize ideas and cocpts .
I work out the problem easil .
Fo his experiene , I arn ha I do ot just remember fts , but try my best to understan idas and oncept .
thu , I a solve many kinds of proble simply .
Second , learning idas and coceps suport self - eduction grealy .
Consequently , yo can reah hg acaemi lels .
It is eas to know facts rom people aroud you .
However , lrning ideas n concepts need or inestigation n understanding many of t academic etbooks . .
Noways , there ar limited time for a teacher to ovr l point in a cerai subjet .
When , students catch te dea of n opi it will be easy to undetand all ssue related to it deeply .
or instance , wn I was in senior yer in hih schoo .
I took pysic clas .
It was massive materials on a specific sue , u I attempte my best to cach its oton ha mae me recgniz any nmentioned points .
In sum , absrbing ideas and fct is e mst effectiv strategy .
Not ny do stuet learn more in their studying , u also they help studens understanding many ats in u life better han ay other wys .
If ou ask me , o is te person who I admire the most ?
I wuld say you are talking bout my father .
He is so brilliant , he speaks three lanages , play several instruments , d the most mortant of a , he is a man of remrkabl pinciples .
Wen he was youngr , he worked to h government but he had to quit because of h orruption .
He always wanted to have his own busines , he use to say , if yu work r somebdy yu r pat of the rolem , u if you hre eople to work fr you , you a part of he soution , so if yu want to be succesful , be you own boss .
He travelled a o , he now Barclona , Lodn , ais , Stkholm , Miami n so mny places .
He aught me my basic Eglis , to paying enis , to play h guia , to dance , to sg an I n contne counting .
So , if I a n my ds , ben a little bit like him , the wo il be fnishe and I ould say I hav ben a goo athr just li him .
When I t to create in drms , the hme of h future the fis thn , which I have in min is new technology . in my opinon , hmes in t future hav to be diferen , this is conneted wi u society and development .
To egi with , I consider that an of homes , whic will be create in te ture must have robots .
A lot of them .
Thy re designed to ding all things elated to housewrk .
In general ouss could have on space , a lo of winow a lig everywhere .
n one of the most imporant thing f me , ew homes should fl in h sky .
In my opinion , inside they wll be looks still in t same way , maybe me technoogy onncted with n inventions .
One of the ms impressive solton il be swimmg pool in t k , near ar .
All in all , future houses ill be looki more ike arplne , nd es lk normal ome .
Tey will be moe ofortable and seful for our mmunity .
It was a sunny day an I was wi my frien at te bea .
Becas it as ur first da at lgarv , we dided to epore , a i moe of the aea .
We ickd up ur thing an start to walk .
Th ist thng to visit , acrding to th plane , was the lbufeira enter .
We fd a very cosy and traditional houses , the mrkt as very opulry , with a lot of people walking ound , nd e eple were vr ice to us .
The next pac as a restaurant near t bch .
Near the restaurant we saw a very strange hing .
We sw a by draing my fac , but I eve w tht by in my all life .
We deied to go tlkng th him .
He started being nevous when we questin whr he sa ta ir .
He sad that gi , tt he s drwing , is the most beautiful girl that he ever mt in his wle lfe .
He explain that he sa ht grl in the each .
Whe we saw me in front of him , he immediately invited me to dinr with him .
Because I eve ear eautiul wors li at abut me , I acceped h invitation ithut hinkng .
When the night omes I wet to the retaurant tat he invited me to go .
I was dressing a sor d dss and a black shoes .
The o , Rube , was weing a sirt with a brown trousers .
The dinner was mazin .
ine th we ve een in touch and by now we are dating . I tnk this is extraordinary .
Rub is a very ct gy an I do nt wan to lose m nver .
When I was younger , I did n't like an sport .
I trid with swimmng , and I was ound tt so boring .
After th , I sign up into Kaate classes u I d n't like combat sports like hs .
Bt on ay , my sport techer gave me the opporunit to became a basketball player wt nine years o .
ine th a , basketball bcam as my favurite sport .
The main reasn which makes me lv it , maybe that 's the teawork , the feelig of uniy whn you 're in a big tm n he sound of the n when th ball goes into e bket , it mkes you go to the seven heaven .
Ta 's for ure .
ou ould like to beome a basktball player to ?
l right , I 'm going to giv you soe adice .
If I were you , I would remember always a ti of Michael Jodan . "
A player could win a game , but on a tea culd n championships " .
If you emembr tha , and understand it , you wll becom a gret basketball lyer .
I 'm sure .
Al of us are surronded of plastic , plastic is needd in ur eeryday life for a lot of thigs .
For is reason whe a wmn an her fmily decided to ve a whole monh without patic they d to chane trei ie style .
Nowadas thre re a lt of prducs which hv plastic or he are wrapped in lastc so it culd be difficlt to ie a wle month without it .
However this fmil belied tha if hey aried their oa , the would reduce the amount of plastic rubbish .
So they would help to stop a bit he problem f he UK 's recycling system .
This amiy as ta they had to cange thei iet too , becaus of sme of heir usual food .
Such us yoghors , biscuits , tc was wrape in plasic .
So I tin that from my poit of view it ould be difficult to follow ts life style uch more an a couple of months .
There r a lot of produc or food , which are eeded in our life , nd ty ar math with plastic .
Howvr I also ink that it 's mprtant to be concient with the environmental concernts , so some deas like ts could be goo to reduce te rubbish .
To u up I think tht it 's iportat to know that we shold recle plastic as wel as carton , glass , c .
In order to do n't waste energy .
So we can use e platic in a responsibl way bt we have to ow hat we should n't ollo this idea untl the extrem beause we need plasi .

Sitting her lon , si floo up on my litt balcony , wen I heard hos n sw boy rnning .
h first thing I thought s tha ther was a CONFLICT between somoe .
An hen , I sw somethin black no oving in the LANDSCAP of the woods .
I knew a boy s lying there and kn it s dead .
A 15-year - od o , the paprs said .
A Bunch of sirens , ops and pinning ligs were down there .
I watched il they DRAG him away , d hn everytin ot quiet agai as it ter was nobody , so I 'm sue h cops will ENFRE he guy who dd this .

I 'm looking dwn at those woods .
A couple 's coin slow on Frnkstown with a il by h hand , had to be the boy 's bab sister .
They pass through Mason 's bar d stop exact net to he sot the by die .
How do they know .
Then the started to put d REARD lowes wer the boy died .
How do thes people find the st .
Could tey hear my old mind workin to guid hm , ea them a TREND hm an get up u tis amn wheelchair and tke them by the hnd .
But I was in POVERTY , so I coud no go and ke them .

That was an unfai eat .
If ter was a machine that can go REVERSE in th time , I miht could sv hm .

The other benei of livg abroad is an incredible personal experiences .
When ou me uniqe peopl wth amazig tories .
For example , you ay meet someone who has raelled nonstop for 20 ountrie a visited mt of he ountries on the plants .
Therefore , this experience opens you up to difrent was of viewing the wrld which a lter the res of yr life .In addition , it gives our children a muh etter undertaning of othe culture whe they attend international schools .
This resuts in it il cage their lives ad expnd their prospects in the futue .

Not differently of much of the world sports lovers , I 'm ik abot Football !
o jt a raly competitive game ; Football is a ful mx of art , creativity , dedication , hard wrk and tem cooperation .
Een if you are the best player in the whole world , you have always to ply for your team - or ele , be ready to be overcam by or fo !
When a er sklled player finds himsel in a hostile ork evionment ( with tlnted but sefish players w are n't committed to their " tem lay " ) he ends to lose performnce d lac good results in matches .
Sometimes , h real spetacle ds n't tk place in t fields , t in its surrounds !
Supporters of traditional cls can be ry pasonate .
sally , when fcing tough oppents or deisive matches , they tr the stadium in a real lag party in order to intimiate he adversaries ; olorng e enches with lag and jerseys - sometimes building wondrous mosaic to expes their delht .
If someone ks me wat is e mst important thing to trt practicing ( or even fllowng ) ti terrfic sport , I 'd y it 's t passion in warig your clb 's jersey and te respect owads your adversaries ' .
ver country has got is wn histry .
o yrs of wa a difficult ituatons the histy was creating peope 's beliefs and convintions .
It was creaig a culture .
People were bulding new astle , alaes an churches .
Yes - churches .
I hink reigion mens a o fr peope- especially plih eople .
I ant to describe a story of te Monaster of Czƒôstohowa .

Athletes e xtemely trong , probably they might fl in love with a sport at the first sght .
On one hnd we have the people ho lives on their port , on te other han there e ones who do ny sport , indifferenly , because it is jut a way to ls wigt or a wy to sped her re time .

Conclusions and ecommendatios
Tarragna and surounings e a god place to vis a to know their culture .
Everybody cn be a ood teacher r younger peopl .
In my opinion , prents are h same and ey can be great teachrs fo thei children .
Seveal reasons can spport this ie , but I ry to focus on the mo imortant on .
Fit , Parents a a rea ource of expeience which cn be lpful in teaching .
Secondly , they av a clse relaionship wh hei hildren , which resus by feelngs a emotions .
These two reasons ay be nugh for every hil to cnsider is / h paren as valuable teachers .
As metined rlier , Experience is a prerequisite fr eey teacher .
In this respet , arnts have so mn thin to each to tei children .
They have faced with diffeent evnt in their lives an every event has had many lessns r them .
It does n't matter tha hy ve fied or gained ucces on thoe evets , h impotant hig is the experiences th have got from those ents .
In this point of ve , children c alay s heir parents to tac them some ne lesons frm the large source of infinite experiencs .
I yself , have fac with so many cases ht hepe me to ndestand he teaching ailiy of my parents .
Once I w 18 years old , I had to make an important dision about my university ajor .
So I just made a quick decisi based on se research on he internt and some pronal favorites a rorities .
I a hoing ta , my dcision was h right on , u it was n't actually . I had chosen electronic t my parents told me to av some more research and consutatios wih te graduates of different majors inuding electronic .
I di their recommendatin d I totally changed my ia .
here were some aspects that I was eally unware of te .
So by considering diferent ideas n pinions , finally I chse omputr engineerin as my uniersity major .
Now I am graduated in ths major an I am really satisied it that .
So , Prents ' experiences can ake them strong teachers fr teir chldrn .
Parents ' closenes to their hilren can be another reason that make them good teachers .
They are really ose to thr chilren in the terms of feelings a emotonl aters .
They have a stong familiarity abot favorites , skls , talents and all other valuable informain relatd to their chidren .
Rgrding hi informaion , he n teac teir children nd help hm to ke reasonable deiions .
I remember oc in hig chol I ad to make new frinds d I was dubious about my situation and it was a reat ilemma to hooe t st ones .
So I cae to my arens an asked their hep , thy presented the best recomendaions fr making the decison , tn I could ma t bs iends ha I can easily go lon wh .
I am raly satisfied by my parets as my indisputable teachers .
hey have eally saved my lives in iffrent cas .
So parens ca be the bt teachers rgarding their emotinal losenes to their chidren .
All in ll , parents are a grea soure of experince , hich c ep tem to be god teachers .
Also the hav so many close relationshis with heir children , which mas them a trstworhy characters as teahers .
I hope a da at all h children rely on their parents as their teachers .
what I ually do in my fre tm .
I raly ike reaing many kinds of boks , magine , etc.wn the weather is ba , I ov sitting in my favorite armchaire , near the fire place an reading .
I niy to her he rain while I am reading at hme ...
owheer I like very much waling t .
When te weather is good I often go out wi my friend for a walk in th cuntryside or do shopping .
I also love watching films at he ciema or on tv .
I prefer omedy and roanc , but I like triller and drama o .
At least I enioy to tae cae on my garden , hee thre are many flowerbeds wh a l of ids of flowes .
ar aua ,
I am glad to hear you and knw y have bought a w compte game .
Actuly I do n't ik very much the computer games , becaus in my opinion hy ar so bing!I al thin hse aes gt a sort of depedenc , lie h alcohol or e drugs , so thy can be ver dangerous !
I reall prefer doing oher kind of thigs on my compute , like to surf the Internet , to stuy Englsh , etc .

T tle of one of the bes thriller movies I hv ever seen is " Seven " .

That provides , especially to ne of h to detctives who ar investigating about th crimes , a trace to follow in her invetigation .
In e movies ar some references to the Dant 's " Divina Commedia " Italian po as ell as to the Bible .
The film is excellent because of bot a very exciting nd engaging plot , d great interpretation of he main chaacers - te serial killer and h t detecties .
To my mind , soppng hs ot believers ad opponents .

All in all , soppin in it 's intention is an enjoyable action which often mks us feel hapy abt it .
Nevertheless , some people tret shopping too seriously and as a result become addicted to it .
To whom it ma coern .

I thk it culd be a oo ea to r the restaurant " Te o cock " .
The restaurant is harmig nd fascnating , located in te old town 's center .
It 's an ancie brewery which keeps a particular atmosher .
e mu in not eally wi - this is god in my opinion , beause I 'm uit suspicious of the restaurants offering too many dishes ... he resarant rves fresh food oy , depending on te season 's product .
There is aso a good choice of food for vegetaians , so ik and A will hav not a problem to e .
The downside could be the waiting time to ea , because all the dses r prepaed at the tie of the custoers do th orer .
Bt it 's a guarantee for the liet : the food is gra idee !
Te location is informal ad he service is good , e owner n the waiters are riedly , yo fe at hom .
ou can listen li music or a DJ on Friday evnin , it 's really u !
ast but not lea , the price is gd , especially copare with te quality of fo and service .
As e concert finished , I her soeon ll my me .
A man put a mal enveope in my hand and wn away .
I opened it d I could se a ommn C D iide .
When I got om , I layed the CD on the CD player bu it raly was n't any sud !
At tat omet e phone started to rn , I pick it up ... u no on answeared me when I ask ' Who is that ? ' .
I s beginning to get ve nervous when someody Knocke te do .
I opeed it but hee s obody hre !
Suddenly a loud noise was head in h roo an I wo up .
I ws ling on te couch with a mystery novel in my ands!. It ad all been jst a nigtmare!.
All ovr te world , h umbr of oveweght people is gowng .
at to you fee re the main causes of this ?

Obesi is on of h mos important chalnges of the current society due to he ft that people sufering fom it has been growing alarmingly .
Ths ssay wi ook at he se of h e causes and effects of ovrweight among people .
Firty , food habits suc as at food and sedentary lifestyle are some of h in caues of sge in eiht mong peole .
Fo instance , thee are many studis by various bode in the US hw th mr and moe teenagers are sening mst of teir te in ron of TV or computer playing deo gme , they hardly perfor any so of physical activity d also indulge in fa od .
This shows that fied or pakge food d complete lack of exerse a the chief reasons for increase in obest among oung people .
Secondly , bullying among tenaers a se in ert attacks are some of e main effects among eople who ae obese .
For xampl , it shoud be note that , recet stuies by WHO has rvealed th bese people are prone to blying ad tere is rse in number of cass of heart attacks among yng pople wih osity .
This example shos ht peple it obesy not oly suffer from bullyn ut also from ert attcks .
Having lokd at boh cause and effcts of ovrweigh ang popl , it is recomended that people te ca of aing hbis by reuing the intake of fast food and also tke tie o to exercise to led a health liestle for thr own bnefit .

Swimig is on of the ms complete sprt because you use ery part of your body in rder to sustain n advce h wter .
T ideal is to start pracicing this por as hildrn , becaue t oldest you are is more difficult to overcome fea , but it is never oo late to learn to swim .
This sport cmbies the moemen of ms and legs with brathing , as coordnatio betwen hese aties is cruial .
mng h advantages of wiming we can highlght the follwng :
1 .
to delay gin , it incrass meoy nd he abiliy to move .
2 . burn more caorie , because in the wae , the muscls wo 5 ies more than on outside it .
3 .
Improving the respiratory sysem .
4 . Eliminate back pain n bones .
5 . Relax not nl he boy b also the mid , so that e tess decreases considerably .
If yo want to kw mor and learn to praice ts sport , we recmmend atendng a specilied school , there e mny od and nt so epnsive , where ou can count with the support of a ulified nstrucor who wil give you the confidence to start .

Ter is no utur fo publ transport , becue travellng by ca is so much ore convnien .
As you do not have to it fr set ti table and follow ixed route .
You can go anywhere you wan and even durn e night whn h publc tansort is scarce or it cold be nsaf .
Driving you o c givs you mre freedom in traeling d icreases yr sense of indeendence .
However , a r is t always more economical to run because for example , you have to y road axe , insurance , ad mtor tests .
Not to mention the cobustibl .
Gneraly speaking , cars generates more pollution than any public transport .
The main eason of this , is hat cars use dieel or petrol , whereas rais use eletricity .
It is also importnt to ntion tat people who drives is own a os e ime rave on their own .
Finally , another advantg over priva cars is tha it reued the traffic caos .
To sm up , I think te utue in transpr is us startg up .
Fo 7t to 0th March me ad my schoolmates , and alo the 2 M , went to a trip to Sicily .
We stayed hr for 4 days a we vistd aormin , Sacusa , Agrignto , Marsala nd a ltle part of Trapani .
We fw rm ro Al Serio to Catania : to me was the irst time I took an air , and it as amazing , bu at the beinning I had a little bit of headache .
Wn we arrived in Cataia e b driver bring us in a caf√© to have breakfast .
Then we ent to Taormina a we viited a lo of thins : the Grek theatre , Corvaia place and th Sician ' pupi ' , Rman Oeon and a public garden ad other beuiful places .
hn we had lun d wet to ' Giardini Nos ' and we s e ecropoli .
In te eveng we we to Siracusa and we stayed in the ote ecause we wee tired .
The next morning we viite Siracusa and in t afternoon we ent to rtiia island where we hd a little b of free tm .
Fro Siracua we moved to Agrigento wher a lot of us sy in the hotel that ight .
In Garigento we aw the ' Vale De temp ' and a msum and in he afternoon we moed to ' ana Maia ei Grc ' .
We aw as Pirandell 's house , and after this we went to Marsa . during e eening we stayed in the hotel and in the morning we a a museum ad te we moved to rapani here we vsitd the saltwors .
Then we d re time r 1 hour , bu soon we h to go to e airport to take the air ad me back here .
It s an incredibl trip !
I have an unusual ca .
It looks ik regular cars ut has some advantages .
First of all , my ar as hh spe .
Second , it cn y .
Beides , my car is cosidrably powrfl tha ote means of transport .
It does o need a fel because tee ar diffent forces which ase the car in he air .
My transport is ue like th k .
Uin this transport I wi go to New Zeland the ustralia ad other countries .
I at to e troica animals , birds an meet wih ocl popuation .
Besides , I am ing to look migraion of the bigst animals of he word - whales .
Travelling by car is muc re onenient , as man people a , but publc tanport is much better for the nvironment .
Tere are now 8 billion people livin on r arth ad if everyone would ive a car , the moke old be so igh , that we could n't live re nymor .
Many peole ue pbli transport every day d I think this is good for our commuicaton , because we can talk to otr pople .
It is also oo o our enironment beaus thr is ust on bs r 80 pople .
her ould be ch mr exhaust if every person is diving a car .
Public transport wil ncreas in the futur , because every ear there are more trainstations , an more teets .
Te Wepng nge is a thriller full of hauting beauty nd intrigue .
It uraves in the modern Nw York among annyous office buildig and emt - ye crowds .
Th er finds al his friends disaear n by one .
Loking for tras of those he loved , he stumbles un a truth tha was hidden in ain sight .
Only by ookng in the eyes of the stone - cold danger cn he evad the disappearance himself .
He migh hve trked e nsters ino a ap , but uc creatures , almost too evil to be ral , cn never be stopped .
My favourite sort is swiming . I like it beaus it mke me fl fr , independent and happy .
It is an individual bt as team activity .
In my opinion it is one of he haltiest port tre e beacuse u an tain no only your bod ut you ca aso develop yur breath .
I do not practice swimming in compeition but lmot since I was 3 years old .
I lwys had rea coaches ho trained me accordig to my biity so that I di not go nve ove my limit .
I have always felt comfortable as a child with my tk mates .
During ese yers I have changed three times rond pools .
At th momet I am traning at the Turin Sspor nar Mirafor .
Is a pot quite tiring ut u a relax when he coc says it 's ie to take a rea .
If I had to ive advc to someone who wants sarting ths sport I would tl hm not to worry if he des n't ee confident .
If he was afrd of t water it is no recommended to practice this sport , or be al to bak own his ear would be a rat oa .
Al in all I uld recommnd to ayoe to py this ort .
It is a sport that priies ad regenerates you .
If we tal abou my faorite sort , basketball will be .
I love basketball , though I raly play basketball because it is har to fn a stadium to lay basketball in Thailand .
I like basketball because it is on of th eaest sport .
Let 's talk abot the advantages of paying basketball .
I think payig basketball hep me to be healthy .
If somene want to play some spor , bsketball is my firt advi .
It is an eas sport to pa f anyne ho ner play any sport before .
So , nebies can understand and know th rules easily .
These are the toy about basketball , my favourit sport .
It 's tru that ot man peole conide th members of heir amly their best friends .
Nther do I. owever , I have a curious opinion .
On the one hand , yr relatives a the peple o will be aways part of o .
Nobdy n leav a family as here wil be a bloody uion .
So , it would be a god choice to consid tm your friends .
It is more poible losing ontact with a fiend than wth the family .
Otherwise , it happens hat soeties u have an argument with a faily mmer and ou need to ak to a frien to be heered up .
If u talk to a frnd , who is also a member of your family , the siuation could turn out to be a ltle awkward .
All in l , how we ca see tee r many adantaes ad disadvantages of considering the embrs of ur famil your be riens .
From my pit of view , friendship is bed on the honesty .
What 's oe , nt only is yu best friend the person who nver les you , b also is the person wo is always by your side .
If a faily member was like that , it could tur into my best frend .

In my opinion , spot plays a great ole in o life .
This company as the intentio of settng up oe training courses fr saf so I came up wth e ide of havin a course that concenrates on company morale .
I consider this corse as a pririty in order to get vry employee to feel motivated a invled in wat hs company ha to offer .
I tongly believe in the idea of having a comfortable office envioment , becaus we yu like wat yo e doing and also where you doi it , yu will do it the best you c .
I recommend that everyone at is deprtment take the urse , that y we could ae h pereption of all te mployee and focus in what we need to improve and canalize it io profits .
Tis courses will last about a week n I ugest we onl take fm two to three hos p day so it os n't bcme tedious ad we can keep eryone ntersted .
In conclusion tis wil get veryne fee part of the ompany and have evyone 's opinins .
yesterday , I watched a science fictin movie clle ade rnnr .
h mov a first relaed in 1982 n direced by Rdly Sott wo is the directr of Alen .
Th story of blade runer is about a police officer ned dickard wh is working as a killer fr the os dagerous robots on ear which they clled h replicants , and they are dangrous on human .
The film events hapene in Los Angels in lae 2019 , there are 4 robt in the sty n each robot hs h wn character , d the most famous ad dangerous n is called bat , he is a very advnced robot an ha many slls and ailities .
Diard th poice officer klled three obot in the film , t at the n of th mve and before he tried to kill the last rbo , he discovered that baty a emotons and felings istea of h mechanism body because he saved dickard 's life at the end of the film .
Taveling s an important role in our veyday life , we ed to get to work , schol , wnt to meet our friends .
Most of those ans would o be possible , if there ere not for ans of trnsport .
But which one , public trnsort or ou own car we wil be choong more ofen in uture ?
On the one han it is more convenient to he a r .
Owning vechicle is very omfortable and gives yo independence .
It enable o to go everywhere you wt no matter when .
u cn als stop caring aou w much you akig to wk ad on trip , being able to ie l tose thing iide of or trunk hie it is impossible in any other ean of transport ,
On te ohe hand , aving yu on c is expense and no evryne could afford it .
or those people thre is awas aother pton - public transport .
It is not nly cheae , but als savs you from uc roblem as lc of parking laces nd rdue trafic am .
Moreover , traveling by trains , trams or buses proucs ls exhut fmes and as a rsult sves zoe layer .
To sm up , traveling using public transpot is mo enefcial for both environment and travellers .
I am onviced , that in spite of cmfortable cr , ubli transport wl be constantly developing .
Hi Sar ,

Yes , I no , it s a difficult decision to ak , but I am too stressed ee , I need a break , so I decided to travel to ngland , the country I have eve wnted to visit but I 've never been here .

After I 'll need to make some mone , my pents will gve me some ut they wo n't be enog fo six months , so I must find a o !
I eed to k y r om he , ou 're e only person I kn h lie there , so the only one who can hlp me .
The first thing I mus as you is if yu could find a place hee I n ta , a motel or , eter , a shared house . I ow it 's a lot to s but old you sd me a contact of a copany at is looin for a part - ti staff ?

Traelling by car is mch more conenient than ing pubic transport f vrous bvius reass .
But , considrig the increase in private vehicles in our crwdl populated wld , it is recommnded by geologists and c - scientiss that we e public transportion .
By this way , we nt only contribute to saving our eco - system , we also contribute to increasing h national revenue .
Wh mobile phones he conquere r palms , we ha no time to ven meet our parents and chldrn .

Using public transport no only hlp us rec or destination safely , b also gve us ample opportunities to network and be with o pope .
They are afer , cheaper and faster .
ven if cars outnmber user , public tnsport wil continue to help and uport us in a safe and a eathy livig .
Fr centuries the population of the world has been dremt of commuting anywhere comfrtably by r .
How any of us stand fro ur bed already exhausted fom e only thought of ettin io a public transport ?
It was thinking about this ajo problem that , h governments fro around e word has lached the greatest and ambitius la .

Pontevedra in s way to become a green town .
Pontevedra has een one of the mot polluted twns fo Galiia for many years .
We had two actorie nd a reat amon of rafic problems .
We dd not ven knew wat to do with our garbage .
Finally , we polluted our rives .
First of l , e me el you ther has been a get change in pople 's minds .
We thougt the facoris were good because hy alloed a gat amount of peope to wok there .
Ltr , we raized e factories could be moved elewher .
We started to appciate the advantags of walking .
Last but not lat , we also became proud of r beautiful rivers .
When t ne mayor arrived , he decide to move te traffic awa from the cy centre .
At the beginning , th w a uch controversial decsio .
Later , he also orered to cean ur wet zones to .
Finally , he has champied ving Celusas factory to a safer pae .
Pontevedra is going reener .
We have suffered lie every other ity these oug yers .
Nevertheless , our passon is still strong .
We wan to mo away h last actry from the rive .
Althoug we have made great strides , there a still a lot of things to do .
In any countries , it 's consider tha the relatives are t close family and the nly peopl ith an individual can be just the y he is .
Tis point of iw is based on , for xaple , that you shares an important bond th your family or that you ow eveyting abot some membs , like you cousins an the kno veryting about o .
Maybe , most of us ha spent our childhood with our cusns n he re our best friends fr ge .
Siblings are another strong point to suppr tis statement .
It 's usual to hear that this nd of bond is the strongest nside a amil , bcaue everybody thins tha siling are he ly es hm o coud ly on , esite not alwas it 's true .
I should talk in the thd peron because I do n't have a rother or isters , u a close cousins .
In my case , thi role is payed by them .
On th ter hand , we c id arguments against his tatement .
For exaple , the debate aot t statement that ou a not choose yur family , but you riend .
Thus , it fits perfect r tose people ho hv a bad relation with thi amilies .
Th ve to ok r h needs provided by the family in other pele wi whom they an tus .

In fact , he development of dfferen vaccines wuld be psible to get ovr a great da of disases .

If we develop or differnt knowledge areas , we wil achieve a better world .
It is igh time we changed our lifestyle .
My dol wa , is and ll alws be Jusin Biebe .
I remember the first time that I saw his videos , I did n't wrte his st nam correctly n I could n't id him on ouTube .
It strted when I was 12 or 13 years old , s musi meant evrything to me .
He as aways talking about follow your dreams and nver gve up .
In 21 I met a couple ro One Directio cale Larry Stylinson b thy ca n't " come out " because of his managers .
I dire em because no matter hat thei mnaers make tem go through , they alway fid the a to show us how muh thy loe each ther nd how much ty want to be free .
I really ope this " hias " , this is h they clle thir break , they can be happy and end time together wihut fake girlfriends , managers or th media around the .

Famous people live completely in a diferet way tha unpopular peole .
It is believed the ae exraorinary , perfectly beautiful and incredible happy like we s their in magazines ad TV .
Eeybody long to be a well - known and dmird perso leading ch and arefre le .
Unfrunately , tuly it is n't so amzng le it seems to be .
There are a lt of disadvantages of being a sar , of itc norml people do n't ralied r eamle not having a private if .
hee are a o of various viewpints ad I would like to cnsider he .
Famous people haven't go rivae life .
Almost every the mystery come ut a they are still dged , criticisd or jke .
Jornalist an paaazzi constantly follow them and try to atch them in a tupd situatin d enhance ath he cost of them .
Everybody makes mitaks , but hir mistakes a wtitten and kon by the society , ha is unfair ad harmful .
Ty deserve to av a nral life , have myseries , a moment of peac without interet roun the .
ein al the time in a centre of attenon is incediby overwhelming .
It can ed to big ouhy and gloomy .
That is why a lot of i name ufer fr epression or eve y take their life .
On the other se , thr is a pce of celebrity d ty should jt reconcile theselve to ths .
They got so o cmpared it unpoplar people , tht 's why I think it would be unair , if te ave also pivae lfe .
Peoe can nt hv everything nd live like tey want .
hy ought to apprecite ha they hav nd top complaining aboou hir ife , because hre is leny of peopl , wo dram to be he .
Famous pople have to consider how many humans suffer ro famie or wrk very hard to earn the living .
he ae nt got expensve cars , deached hses , he ca n't afford travelling and thei oy entertainment is watchig TV .
The should remmbe the are lucy devils not like tey often think - victim .
To sum up , It is hr to simply claim , that famous people deserve ave a private le and bein ef aloe by aarazzi or no .
Everyone from time to time need a momnt of pace to relaxed ad recover teir srengt .
Howeve , nobo has everything hy dreame ; it is normal , at always in our lvs something ould be ann us .
Famous peope ve to nice , w mch ty hae , apprecciate it and tp mplaining about ot having a private life , becuse it is not such a disaster like th often think .
Da by day , e poer of cnsumption icreases ore a more and one of he areas you c realize thi is in th traffic .
People w hve facilities to uy or finace sothing and loong o coneience , have a grt desire to buy a car .

hese things aes we think if h pubc tansport has a future , after l to do ll the higs ou need in our routin ie to go to work , to go sopping or js to go o wth he famly , is or comfortle by car than by b .
Cars noadys ha technology that llow both driver d passenrs to have a better travel while listening to a mui or use the internet without having to spend hous standing durin th joney .
The goenment nee to invest in btter conditons of the public transport , wit more optios to e transportion of citizens , in orer to make it esie to go frm a plac to another , a rdest the dcision to choose betwn r or b .
Everything has two side a the choic of transportation is nt an ception .
People hav ben debted about wether private a or public trnsport is th ist chce in recent yas .
While reasos an be gien to utify e lattr , I am in favour of e frmer .
irsty , travelling by tin , etro or u can lead to he reduction of gasoline consumption .
As a result , they ofer ow fee and play an imporan role in te enirnment protection .
It a reported that or on undre kilometes runing , eh r was consmed ten to thirteen lters of gasoli , and released a certi proprtin of ir polutted .
Meanwile , ih the sae amount of energy , bus carried fifties of peole , a even up to as ih as hunreds of pople with the massed transportatin .
Secondly , it ould not be denied tht travelng by r is convenient , however people wo greed with te idea oin ut tat high quality and modern public tanport ch as Shingasen in Japan or TGV in urpe ae uch more comfortale .
Trans or MRs
can aso satisf passengers who coud o travel by ple and require to ake lng hau joueys .
There are some places in deelping contrie , for example in emote or highland areas , people ve n seen a c or many years , they hae no choice cept od buses to trve .
In cncluson , public transprtation is stl he rst coie of people in the future .
Nowadays higher educion becoe more ad more ecessary fr startin a gd career .
e 's cosider the attitudes to educaon and stuy in Russia and ustrala .
There re some imilarities ; however , diffrences in he educational system cause ifferences in the attitudes to ducatin .
Uiversity education is valuae in Australia , jus lke in Rusia .
In genra os of eployers pfer applicants which achieved an cademc degr .
Ti attitude is quite simar in ma countries .
During our lst English lesson we talked about t future or plic transor .
It a t an ea task to fiure ou if there is a ftue or nt .
e most important argument was that travelling by r is muc mo convenient .
h act at o cn travel anyhere at any tim is undeniale .
If yu ant to uy sm vegetales fo yr dinner u will av to wa uni the next train arrivs at your station .
Due to the ct tat our iestyle is getting fter , nobdy will hve the time .
So in te nar future thee will be no longer a ue for blic transport .
Mchal wa one of he reatest drivers of all time .
He startd s career whn he a sixteen years old through kr competitions .
fter oy three year he passed on Benetton ormua one tem and tw yea fter he won his rst rver championsip .
Afr o aother tile he signed a contract wi Ferrari ea .
At that point h wo bcoe vey had an stressu because at that time Ferrri wa n't a very oo a in fact hat car was only able to go fst in a stragh circuits .
ichael sowd up hi strengh ad his attention to details woking close days nd nighs wih his enineers .
Three years lar aftr ntense wrk Michael restarted to put his feet on the odium .
In 2000 he won his third diver hampionship with errar and also won it cosecutively o three years .
Thn errri with Michael deided for a nw collaboration , so the geatest become a te drivr tried to improve t car ou of the racers .
In the meantime his mind always thought at Mercedes beaus of his youngest dreams .
ike every German , since he was a oug driver , dreamd being a driver championship with the ntionl ca .
To summarize he arranged a meeing wth th ea of Ferari n te mdia press because he would like to announce his defenitively
retiement .
This unfortunately ws on an xcus he was onl pretending to retied as he already signed a contrat to rve Mercedes .
At te ed of the cofrence ichae coed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mitae .
So man people rund me think that mks not y nse spending comuity taxes in public traspot .
hese persons usually gi arguments uch as that h pubc transport is eve in ime , or tht is diffict to gt our destination using it d without having to tae 3 diferen routes or ve that pubc ransport is not as suitable for a mad up short otice trip as ca be a car in roperty .
In my opinion tese rguments deped on ow efficiently designed is te public traspor sytem , having in oun number of routs , timetables , cost of th tickets n falities fr users wh u it frequently .
It 's qui wel known the benefits tat a oo pubi transpor stem gives to e communty : an iporant reuction of contaminant gases , a hight decrese of acoustic contamination as well as , as consequence of having les cars circulating by our streets , an increase of pedestrian res ue by pedestrians or healthy activities sch as walking , runin or yclin .
All these benefs sury wll ontribute to a better future for l he habitat so let 's give a chance to t public transport .
My town is called a ad it is a small ow situted in Piedmont ea Langhe .

In thi area the are man filds where were bit ind turbin or se the nd and creating eletric energy .

" I was 40 eas hee ees g , I fe motivatd to tai , while I ae the otivaton I can contie ; w I have no an exact dte ( ‚Ä¶ ) I just have set 2017 in Gdalajara " , id Duque , who was the first sportsman ho won a wrld chmpioship of flls fro eigh .

In te male st , the hig - jumpers are hrown u into the waer from a height of 27 meters in height , whereas in the femal copetitin e launch pad is pled 20 meer away .
My avorte sport is runnin .
One ma ask why among al those possible ctvities , this e was chosen .
Of course I do nt count runing indoors , but only outdoors , hie the breze is blowing in n 's fae during the exercise .
Ta is wh I cl a good atvity .
here is nt exactly a god dy fr runnn , for ven th rainy days ae excellent for a goo run .
If one h a unn and wndy weather , it is nice becaus h sun warms one up ad the in helps keep it fresh .
On t other hd , if it is rai , the cod wer cools it down and make one eel less ied durig oe 's time .
is is my favorite sport for it improves health in om ny ways a boost t resistance a quality of life .
h irt ties may be har , in that they require a preparton a edentry persn dos n ave .
There an be om in and almost everybody becomes rely exhausted at te beining .
Aer the fist trias , howeve , improvements ar shrty noticed an e reult oe quickly : beter breathing , ninterrpted and uit sleep , ad an unmistakabl sense of well - beng .
It even hel educin our belly !
Despite being a comn and as to do activity , running needs some care to prent inries nd other disturbnces as well .
Efficient eat expelle ocks help ne redc the uncomortability and kee one 's feet in a nice tempratre .
Notitstanding , a formidable ai of hoes mke a huge difference if e plns to keep practising the spot or a long period .
Go to a octo , a i to analse the type of te to mak up wih an ideal footwear .
hi way , there will be es trouble when praising he exercise .
I must say tt , as a runner , I do not regret it at n tim .
Everybody can do , it is pratial n sipl , d the gls can be set in accord with he person 's ned and restrictions .
Do ot hesitate to go out and y it out !
Take that pair of snickers nd go for it !
I always cosiderd football as a piece of art .
Does not matter how ard the players tried to wn , the onl ting ha maters is he resul .
Players must be considered as a paintor working in a pie of art .
Only reuts wi be recogied at the e .
It 's o e effor they have applied or all the hopes te had .
There expctatios will be considered unusef .
oele wo n't stre a pain at a seum thinking how hard th artist tried to do a good o , th will jde it onl .
Do they like it or n .
The crowd in the stadium only wants thei team to win .
After tha , if hy playd a god ame wll be a plus .
Everything atr a successful esult il be a plus .
So if smeoe ever is woudering sar practising ts spt , they should be aware tha lt of peopl wil be expctin tem to win .
I would recommend em always remembr that , so if higs do n't resul as they expecd , the wo n't feel diapointed .
It 's all pat of he game .
We are pepe and l of us must ha private life inludng celeities .
There is a great number of politicians a film stars who ar followed by paparz who a ying to know more bout tei privt life .
I ree that film stars ad fmous politicians mu have their fre ti because thy are wrking or peope everyday .
They ust have some free time to hv a est wthut being seen .
It is qiet hd to have a rest wh ournalists e ryig to know some exciing things about yr prvate life .
On t ter nd famous oiticians and il stars he chose such lie .
It is a part of their everyday life , tey are us to be on public d he are ud to say smethng about themseves on cameras , so al the peol will nw aut thr life .
Thre are some mmens when celebities ne some tim to be wth their failies a frind d journalists must not touch ch moment .
Evybody must have fre time for yourslf .

In the modern world , the company whch has exllent tuf is more cmpetitiv , and these employees are sally motivted .
Thereore , good laders shoul know how to motvate hei staff .
It is lar tat staff would ped moe time on thir tss if te wee moivated by tei boss , wil unmotivated employees are oe likely to spn les effort in tir jobs .
Generally speking , thre are t basi methods of empoyee moiation : rewrds volving mone and no - inancial rewad .
any leaders believe th money is th bet , howver , from my own pesective , he no - financial rewards e te be approah to otivate employees nd I ill prove my opinion in this ess .
I hd evr been ery frightened unti one da that smehing strange happnd .
One night , I w talking wih my sister bout her lat tr aond Europe , her bt friend , Michal , also a there .
My sister claimed that in hr trip , she had see completely astounded builings , but while she was talking , we eard a ery loud seam .
We did n't know hat to do , so we only exchaned glces , the we decided to go o nd see what had happened .
utsde ws getting very ld n the y was dk , so we could n't see anything u nevertheles we coniue walkin rough t trees when suddenly we saw a vry bi shadow in fron of us .
In that moment we started to un , except Mchel .
When we gt in he house , my sistr and I reized that Michael wa n't there .
We re ve surprised d scared at the same time .
An nd I dcded to go outside to look f ichae , when we went ou , he was in front of e hos , doing stange sounds , when he saw us , smile to us in a malevolent a , th ade us to back inide .
Michael coed the do and new at that momen he hd mde a mstake .
My favort spt is basketball .
I ae noumerous reasons why I choose this sport as my avorie .
One reason why I love this articlar sport is bcaue it 's based on cooperation .
Fo example , if you play asketball ad the al is passed egulrly te your eam is re like to win because psses caue confusion d exhastion to th opponen tem .
My avice to anyone h is sarting this sprt is to simply have fun .
On e othr hand if he choes to play professionaly then he mut try ard .
Regulr exercsin is potentional so that he / she a bui up stegth d endurance
To conclude , I hope my advice should be helful to w statrs of the spo .
O of my favorite estaurants is one locatd in a delightful to called Ubeda .
The whole town is gorgeous and ou seem to be in anther a of hitory .
The restaurant has a characteristic deoratio indeed becus you eem to be nsde a train .
However , t most imprssive thig is h game of flavours tat expode inside yo moth .
My favourite one is a godn gg made of fi .
Te connection beween qualiy an rice is plenty blance .
In fact , there are alway plenty of eope ever dy so I recomend ordering at last o wee befoe ging .
I know ro rsonal experience that it is worth tsting the gourmet saping nu .
I really think it is suitable for e ass because eah on of us could no in dvance how would pay to eat there and besides this could tse the mn cours of this restaurant .
Whout shadow of doubt I am absoluely se ths could be the bet option or our class .
I'VE NEE EE SO THRILLED
I 'm not a great fn of films based od fiton , unreistic cts n eents .
I he alwas preferred to relax urig om series or soap opera , but fer watching ' Flushed ' I chang my point of iw .
If y haven't een it e , after reading this short tet o 'll go to the cnema if you only ave a chan .
HE BIRTH OF NEW TAR
I gess at a nam nn Smith els you nothing .
n hat 's obvious becue it 's th first srios production of ths young , prospecive diectr , whoe ' Flushed " becm a worldwide ht .
It is id that a well - known cast enabled hr to be highly grated fo r pice , bt I have some doubts about it .
TH STRNGHT OF SPCIL EFFTS
Ad that 's why I fnd this moe so excited .
An enormous amount of additonal attractios for viwe provided me wit unforgttable feelings .
Everything cae us a surpris and yo did n't expec that this or that ctio is st tkng plac .
Te movie requires from us to be tronly concentrated on ht is ong on nd I ind it to be one of mostly conceivin facor r thse who still have ome objections .
Th director ive a choice to brden our mind n to om up wth ou own conclson or aybe imaginable nding of the gripping soy .
RECOMMENDANS
For me there is no better mvi to be presened in ou clb .
Taking nto consideration our terest in te ied of thrillers , under no cicumstances cn we miss it !
The rofile of llions of eent gradat and professional pople in Spi is a young person , well prepared d witht wok ho r hining of going aoad as a good chane to t a job .
To wok abroad can offer you a good opportunity , maybe it would never happens in your own conry , instead .
Furthermore , as ell known , saaries are higher in otr European ounties an in Spain , so your li conitins my increase t same as ou career lader .
On h ote hand , going abroad ithou our faly migt be a ealy bad experinc , ecaue yo may thoroughly mss them , aybe because yu are n able to visi tm as ch as you can due to livng far aay rom home .
he weaer ma be a isadvatage , as ll .
For exape , if you go to wok to England y a se ff he riht and sunny Spani days a sy a bi welcome to he frightful nglish weather and depresion .
To um up , th disadvataes of goig abod a hihr ha the advantages , but evr cloud has a siler lining .
Maybe , any people wo hae tdied did it to gt a jb opporuniy in ther own country , u life is life .

Parkour is a disciline in which it man popors is to train your od and nd to be ae to ps through a point A to pot B , in any kid of environment , the safest d fastr wy wiout causing no ha to your body .
Parkur ws develoed in Lies , Fac , around the 180 's .
One of the faundations us to develop Parkour a th Natal Method created by Geore H√©bert .
Baicaly , the method is asd in develp t main foundtios of moviment of he uan body , tey are : swim , u , wal , jump , qudrupe moviment , climb , lift things , balance ad defend yourself .
Raimond Blle was a former Vietnam soulie d worke as a freman in te Fenh ay .
He hd a eat background in gymnastics d , sice he was a teenage , he sed to do a lot of xercises .
T roots of Parkou was deeloped by him and he taht som of Parkour thechniques to the fireman wch he used to work wi .
s so , David Blle , a taught om of th faundations of Pakou too .
David and a group of fiens tried to adapt hi echiques to th ura environment and then he actual Parkour as bn .
Some people say that vid riated Parkour but , in fat , hi fther deelop all th idea of h discipline .
David adted it to te urban environment and creaed new move .
Parkour is n't just a physial diipline , there is ao e philosofical pt . Altruism , " be strong to be usefl " ( it is ctally a frae Natural Method ) , develop your body and min so that in a dangerous situation yu wll be abl to sa yourself and other peoe and so on .
Thereore , is d to i phloofy d h oy that I fell before , ring n afte a tran , ths is why Pakour is my favorite exercise .
Nowadays our ocity a beome vry lzy e to the use of the ar or the mtorbike .
Thr are less pople ho use he public transport in the city becas the prefr travelin by car rather than in publc transport .
Fo th eason , t ue of public tansport is gng down , and sm experts sy that thee is no futue for the public ranspor .
F ot of pople , ravl by yor wn ca is re ofortable than tavl by pblic transport lik bus or metro , bcause you do not depend on a chedul , tt it is ey ommo hen ou ae pubc traspor .
Converely , wn yu tral by you own car , you ae a lot of time durng the journy .
Hwver , public transport has al advantages .
On te ne hand , publc tranpor affords you to waste money , because the pce of the icket is not vey epensive .
On the other , travelling by eto or b olute lss tn going by cr .
The reason is that when y e h car , you normaly go on yor on ad when ou tavel by mro or car t of eopl r traellng at the sa tim as yo .
In my opinion , there are more pople who travel by car eery day , ven for short journeys .
r me , people he bcoe very lzy nd te refe te car rather than pilic transport , beaue you a ta the c whe o want a go where you want whoou spending ous waiin o the bus .
The cosequene of this is ha in the near futur the ubli tansort will disappear .
The company enure t qualiy of water frm prodctio to distribution .
The produc ill be registered wi Ministry of Helt and SriLanka stanerds Assocition d ahere their rules and regulatiuo fr production , storing and distribuion .
We will not compromise the qalit of t producton proce or the prodt fr any ct .
e copan ll ensure tat , the w negtie environmental impact du to t production pocss .
The cmpay will set the retail rice same as the bottld water roducts in maret .
t we will gv a god pice to retailes and hotels to sell u proucts more in market .
The direc uppies to offices , houehods d hoes also will be given goo price with the deliry service .
We will et war dispenses wit a maintenance services to rquird customers in ftue to attrct more customers .
Durin the lst cenury , our y of life has chaged ompletely , even in villages .
For example , cars ar th mn ind of transport beause of his most of the families av mor than n in teir houses .
However , changes always has a negaive side .
Acordin to the lst studie , pollution increases this year in the iggest cities whereas it goes dwn in illages .
On h other hn , iies are more wried aut h to reccle heir rubbish ta in llages .
To resolve ths roubl , my illge has rated a plan to teach its ppulaion how important it is to ta care of the environment and how to do it .
or this reason , we hve ew containers to sepaate al rubbi : we have to tow wa bottles , ans a cartons into te yellow ; pper and cardboa go to the blue and there is anothr one for glas .
Fd and otr things are thrown ito the grn container .
The ouncil so has put er one hndred is arod the villge to kp lean ou streets .
At he school , children are learning how to spen lss wat or ectricity at ho .

Do we need fashion ?
Fashion , a poplr toi .
We all wear clothes , do we ?
And most people think about hat they er , although some do n't care about there clothing .
What hapens when we all st ave to ea the same clothe ?
Do we really ed fashion ?
I taled bot hi topic wt a few oher students nd asked them wht ther opinion is .
In te following pargaphs I 'll te yo wt they old me .
Th irst uesion we dscussd was : ' Does it exs just to ke money for clothin designers d manufactures ? '
Their opinos fst varied a bit here .
An argument some caled was:'In case we remove this wole industry , thn there would be an humanous group of peole unemplyed , and tat would be a prolm . '
The other answere on this it he question : ' When does a company stars king somhing , ju becaus te want sometng to do ? '
This questio made the ote roup dubt a bit , they did agre that a ompny dos n't just stat making something to hav something to do .
This made them all gee ha fashion is there for a reason , and not oy f money .
ext qesion we tlkd about th following quetion:'oes it have too mch effet on odels ? ' Th did n't hve to tnk about their opion , tey all drectl said ' Yes ' .
The old that if you wanted to be a modl , yo had to i in a size of clothing wih is realy small .
here is immense roup of girls who really want to be a model , caused by the fact tha hey do n't f in this clothing yet th ae to ose weit .
uch girls e losig to mch wight right ten beuse ty wnt to be ' perfect ' d got anorexia an thse things .
The following estion which we talked aou a:'Does it he to mu influen on yong people ? '
Here they all directy respone with a ' yes ' to .
In their opinion young peple , ao themselves , were vr buy ih fshio and cohes .
An exampl on hih the al agreed was:'In as o just met your new class , a you hd to choos next to ho you ha to s the most pople were going to i xt to the girl or boy with the redy clothes ' .
Some ad that it even apened tht eole jus bought a prticular kind of othing , just because thy thouht they wol ave more friends the .
The net qstion was:'Des it make society materialistic nd competitive ?
he stdnts were a bit doubting bu agreed on he fact that pele who have stylish clthes are uslly the most popular .
And the 're a lot of pepe o wat to be popular , so hey are ging to b trendy clothing .
he as and probabl the st diffult quetion we discssd was:'Does it afct he ay yu drs d the kind of cotes you by ? '
hey all said it kid of di afet however they ao boght clthe thy ikd .
I skd thm t question:'If you liked a piece of clothg but you fiends d n't , would o he have ught it ? '
They a aid y , bt ith a little oubt .
So , we do kind of need fashion .
But where do we decide on whih lothe we wear ?
n do y have to like you clthes or somene ese ?
Maybe we houl ke in mid th we hould wear clohes in which we eel kay .

Tht lette has hnged my whole ie .
I totaly do not agree with the statment that there is no future r publc transportation ecuse of c existences .
General public a uing the pblic transportation mre than before .
students who are n allowed to drive stil using t public transportation and they wil aways do .
Moreover , te trafcs on areas sch as down town enforced pole to ue the pblc transportation as train , sice th tains ae faster .
Insurances are so expensive in nort Ameca , most of householder are t using e a bease of insurance , n also because of addin cost as fixing te cars , chagng a oils and tc .
Frthermor , Governmen r enhancin te ublic transportation by services they are providing with lower cost . the fair o raid in ublic transportatio re moe les than the cost of divin the car at th sm dstance .
Finally , none will gue that h benefit of using as oe pbli transportation , b tat os n excled the pblc ransporation .

Belarus is no a popar tourist dstinaion owadys but a lot of pole woud be surprised to find rea edieva tmosphere in Grodno , a esten it of the country .

Two ancient cstes remind us of the imes of kings and nobility , qit edestrian streets sow us the life as it cod be in h 80s .
Grodno is situted on the cossroas of gea tradin ays that 's why ne could hea Pois , Jewish , German , Lithuanian there .

RORT ON SOPPNG FAILITIES IN MY TOWN
The reason Lagos remans a meg city is becus of its abudant torist centrs .
Te beaiful seaside an natural ges reserve or Zoo makes it very attrctive to tourist visitors .
A pleasurabe tourism is ot complet without a fascinating shppin cente tat hs evera faciiies .
ATTRIBUTS OF HOPPNG FCILITIS
There are lts of shopping centers in my town with their own niqu characteristics .
hee iclude facilities lie ample vehicle prking lots wit very w chargs or almost fe of chrg , elvato systems to aess any area of te hopping malls in th case of arryng ve heavy loads of urchases a reaxation spots like Cinemas nd gaming centers o kids .
In addition , ost shopping mll do have enogh space for their cusomer to move around wthout ettin any clustering of eopl ; as th is a statory reirement to buildn a shoppi ml .
SHPING RECOMMENDATIONS
As a mtte of fact , Shp - rite is one of the best place in my opiio , that I would adve people to visit .
It products ar more international nd they offer a lot of dicouts to ourist visors .
Bside , this shop is n too far fro h nown natural games reserve in Leki area of Lagos .
nther sopping centr is the agnificen Lgos Iland market .
This is where you would fi sveal shops tht sell most African traditinl artifact .
I will rather advice tourist to y th market a visit to enable hm have choices of priceless procts .
CONCLUSION
I ope fo the explantios , I have been able to convnce you with espect to my opinion bout h shopping centers in my town n their possile fcilitie that aonds as u take yu time in considering vsitin them .
In developed countries , four wheels gain hg appreciation in veryay transportatin .
In cpita cites of Europe e can easil notice how mny people preer their own means insed of t pusing crowd of ublic transportaton .
It is however well knon aft a plethra of scintifc publications that as hr the envrnment ramatically .
On the other hand , modern citizens lie to be part of green revoution n carbon footprint h an effect in everyday deision making .
Many organizations d public authorities encourage workers to use pbic mea of transport to and from the job plac in order to minimize greenhouse gases eissons a save natural resources .
As a esult , before privat tranportation raches its ick f st cenury , it is more probbly gren mobility oveaps it and dminates in people choie .
The is great future for public transport , same for bicycling n on foo travelin istead of cars ad ohe plluting machies .

I utely agee with he statement : travelling by a is much more coneniet , because yu ca go whrever yu want without waiting f a bus or rain at a bu op or sttion .
I think th travelling by car is also more inner d comfortable becase yu only travel wi people you know .
Talking bot oey probal c is or convennt , ev if you av to pa for fuel , ighwy and everything hat is ecessary to te aintenance of the car .
As a resul , if o use public ransport , yu have to pay an expensive subcription d diffent tckes .
There is no future for publc tnsport beuse buss a trains are brke a dirty d pople prefer to avoid hem .
So peol prefer travelling with ther own means of tansprt instead of ayig to travel in a teribe way .
On th other hand , if we do n't s pubc ranspot and ver person use a a , polutio wll nrease a l .
We can also y tht with cars you have to find a pakng , so you can waste time and sometimes pay fr tat .
Eventually we shoul us public transport to reduce pollution , but they ve to be mre cheked and rpired .
I agre with the statemen , fmous eope esrve to have a priate lf wtout lfe jouraits flowing them l the time .

Sometimes happens , that journalist wrte some sill gosspis about famous peole , wich ar not true .
It m be a dager f family of a celebrity , politician , famous eson , because of the some ould broke up .
But on te othr hand , bin famous is a fre oice for many people .
They wnt to be rich and famos n they no , at journalist will be follow them .

If ou 're a queen , member of rol famiy , fr your birth u 'll be oservng by pres and magazines .

Pulic activity is one of h most iportnt hin .
In my pinion , the television s an important rol in te society becas it an ifluece in peple 's life .
I mean people watch televsion to entertain themselves b others maybe watch it to lern a e language with different progams at teeviion ofers or just put subtitles to ae it smpl .
A o of important new cn be shown to people around th wold by TV .
It 's imporant to nw what it 's happening in t worl bcause it n nrich or knowledg culturally , politically , etc .
Besides o need to now if a conlict is developing at the moment or if many severe stuatios are being occurred in your country .
Childr lan a lo of things wth cartoons , it can help thm to improve the spakig and to ow new vocabuay .
The televisin is one of the most important mdi .
So , for ta easn I think televiion can entertain and also eduae .
I 'd ike to add hat tleviion can be h refuge of a peron if it 's d or he reak of someone 's on its free time .
Watching TV c be funny and nice but watcin it in xcess can be bad and ot healthy for you lif .
I aways believe I an become an engineer and coputer technician to nvnt mr things since I s small .
Afr I receive more and more infomaion bout some successfu engineer and invent such as Sve Jos , I realize tat no matter w you ar d ow sart you ar , u an not iv whout a heathy body .
Conseqenty , I believe pysical development is the necssiy in secondary scool lf and I was so graeful for proving me opportunities of exta - curricular activities .
I like h feling of eting sweat and a gre psion in swmming .
Therefore , to maintan my by healthy and my interest , I kee on joining the Sool Aquathon sice I s secndary oe . I partcipated the same evens each yar .
It allo me know my body stae n whether I ae relapsed .
Besides it gave me a mtin to ran harder and never have a thiking of iving up hat I need to kee my swimming traing vey year ad einds me of the imortance of a healhy boy .
Also , uner the harsh training , it tain my willpower and seting go .
I learnt ettng a ropr gal as it is a signifint factor to success .
This goal push me forward to do better an beter ac time .
I realized that o wll make a concession if o do not impov after take pt in School Aquathon and saw ther got mproved u t jt me .
I reckon learing and trying more kin of things can chang my school lif to beome more lorful .
School wr and examination ave me hg pressre so I fou a y to strie a balance that I lernt plang windsurfing .
In my eyes , windsurfing is secial ad idispensable to me .
When I step on the sufing board , all my exaton nd msgivin wee ge .
Under t recommendation of my instrcto , I joined the Jint schol wndsurfing cmpetiton .
On that day I fond somthing wng wi my position on e rult board . I w shocked and eided protest for the wrongdoings of th race commttee .
After several meetns , I go my psitin back nd I have earnt that we shul beiev ourselves .
Also I got trained my boy and ecme oe healh .
h hotet isu nowadays is the global wamng .
Therefore I pad mor attention at global armng nd ways to del with it .
It is art of my dream at I wish I can hve an invention to solve the problem in the future .
To kow re informaion havin a green lifestyl , I participated in the Gren & Organic Health Run 201 .
Also , I learnt communication skills with friends .
On of the purpose of thi event is to encourage running to hav a healthy lifestyle , so I g a bttr physial dveloment .
To ae moe differet experience , I hae joined h " Dialue in the rk " experiential exhibitin .
In the total dark envionment , I eperiene te eelig of the visually isabled d t ifficultie of hei livings .
After undro this experience , I can totally unerstan her nes an I o my new al of helping the in the fuur .
I ge a greater passions in enineering so as to creat om devi to lp them to hve a re comfortle life .
lo I av lent the communication kils wit others and be coniderate .
Uer the colrful school life , I unergo differet te of experience and I finally set my caee goal to become an engineer or a computer technician .
I think it is not a god engineer who oly go skills of enginering .
Theeore I reckon my experience can trained me to be admitte as a suitable andidate of ngneering n I wil rk hard to achiee my goal .
People differ from each other and eryone have various professions .
Beig a politicia or a flmstar has something in comon : tse ople are famus .
And , as a daack of being aceebrity , they r folowed by papparaz amost eerywhee .
ut do n't th eserve to have more rivae life ?
I think ht journalists should rememer about the prate life of fmous people wic is deserved to sty in secret for other pope .
There are a lot of cases known wen journalists would make it difficult for a celebrity to leave som pce because there were so ny of hoe journalists .
And fo ome peop it does n't really matter if it was fund o that someone s in a br for example as log as their films are rely wrh watching .
Besides , bing foolowe by unkon pople ought to be quite a scary experience .
So peole wud sy that it 's nessary for usual people to nw how the politician lives so thy could know if he should be trusted .
That 's fo sure an iporant thing to know or voters .
But as for film strs , is it real nessary to kow h exacty they lv ?
Dea pinciple ,

It is a act that h publc is getting worse ye by year specially here in Peru , oweer we have to thik about the benefits that public transport s , for istance it can be a os - effective way to get to wrk , so hre will be no spc f pubic transpor in the future ?
undreds of eople take buse at y tme , e of the main reaon or hs is that ty have ot got their own car .
As a result , not only is public trasort h option hey have , t it is also the ly o .
It 's kow th ove the year the sstm have improved and new mens of transport av been offered such as trains nd trolleys al of them wit ust one objective to transport a ass of peole at a quick ti .
On h ther hand t number people w can ford a r and e cost tha it involves hav gone up ovr the last w years ad oe of t main reasons they have it bease of the comfort , so they claim that they can et ther ok aster ha pubic ransport .

Dear Sr :
I am wrtng ih regrd to an dvertisment that appeared in the local newspaper ecetly .
hs advertisement queste a group of young pple to wok in summr caps all ovr th USA .
First of all , my name is orena and I hv went - thre years old an I am fo pain and I woul like to o in your sumr camp because I cn improve my English leel and earn ony ; my English evel is so go due to al hs year I ave been in English academy to learn te language and now I am going to ake aoter crtificate ; and ust lke ha I will be ble to communicate wh hildrn .
Secondly , last year I stayed in a beach summer amp nd thee were chldren aged 6 - 13 , besides my prtnr and I prepard water activities hn the weate was good , against ; when the weather w ad we prepared puzzles gae , dventur gaes , etc .
The advertisement talks abt work in t kitchens ; r summer camp w little because it w in a small own so we hd to cook children od n I could do it without problems .
I oo frward to hearing your response .
ors faithfully .

Michale ill never fore the day as long as he lived .
It w on Saturay moning around 10.30 .
He en to he church on th a .
It ws the Seventh da Adventist churc which the ritual ws to orship on atuday .
He a hee not becuse he was a hristia , bt h presence was because of a girl he ha a ruh on .
Honestly , as egt ears old boy w knows Crstianity coe to nothing , his knowled of Christianity was lower than a 3 yar - old child .
nxiousness o t better of hi as he prepare himsel to enter e sanctuary .
In his mind , the only reason I was there was jus to se e rl he ha my crush on and to now me of r church friends .
Th boy had to ph himself an break the ie as the time en by .
hh , I am starting to et lz .
WHATTTT I ISPELLED MIAEL!!icael closed th door and ne at that momet he a made a mstae .
ubli trasport man trveling around t worl an cities by usng trains , bses , taxi , airplanes t .
Sme years ago people blieve that private cars would be h main vecle to moe roun u noadays , e to economic cisis , ms of e people have chged their minds ; they blieve that public transport would be the main way to move round in th ture or man rasons .
First of a , ravellin by cr is mor expsive an travelin by public transport ; as hould ay f gas , insurance , repairin , environmnet fees etc ; trvlling by public traport is more ecologica an cheaper .
Secondly , peope o use pulic transport ae safr thn oter h use private cr ; if they drink more than usual and drive their rs ; ere ar a lot car accidets due to drivers ae druk .
Fially , the traic jam is much less if people use public tranport than usng rvate cs ; the developed countries hav bult a public trnsport syte so to avoid traffic am , wh peple no using it ?
In colusion , public transport wil o be affected by using private ars .
I stonly believe tt in the near uure public ranspot wil be the main eicle to trav rond the orl , sae and cheap .
Michael ha ust oen up , he felt a Little bit thirsty so he went to the kitchn for esh wae .
He sw his brother atching TV as usual .
As he cud n't sle aymor he drssed up and bruht s brother to the park .
His mother ould be probably orkin , she was a raltor a wld be slling a house .
It ws a wnd day so ey kpt ther jackets ad sarf .
hen Mihel and his little brothe , Jackson , arrived at the park , noiced hat ther s n't anyby around .
Th park a seald by a gren tape whih said " danger zoe keep away " .
Suddenly t peple ressed as astronauts ee leaving the pak and advertised to the oung boys to go to their house and ait untl ths unfortuntly even as over .

Whil the ere alkin back home ey heard a journalist commenting what inciet have hapeed to th rk .
Te only thin they could cleay heard was : - Bu this can ony be cased by te contaminaton , athough these windy day hasn't helped .
Jackson stopped walking an get ditracted by a beauifl dog , Michael continued on hi way nawre Jackson was n't olloing him .
Alost arriving at oe n mllig over te thoughts ak hi o conclusions to at uld might hav happened .
And ated to share thm wi jack bt ...
Mchael closed the door nd knew at tha mmen he had mae a stake .
Well , I ink ht this u is trying to sy is ta it oe n't attr if ou ave thousands of friends on Facebook if you do n't even know half of te .
What I tink it 's stupid is that most people use to hide their faces fom behind the scren d no one ans to appreciate a sunny day anore !
What I disagree aot tis video is eause he is generaizing too mc .
I tnk it is cool to ve a soial etwork , and there is nothing wong to let kids njoy the technology tha becae part of r generation .
Hwever , th ut be controlled n especially by teir parents .
I believe the l alues should hv ee taught or cidren in hools .
The thng nowadays is , if u disconnect from all of the tigs we he , people make un of you d sy at you r ld or just do n't ko how to da wi the modern orl .
Well , it is possibl acully , jst like we d in the 1990s .
I 've experienced this , so that 's why I am saying .
Te internet has caused me depression once , I felt really lne and I ue to be soeone who I was n't in e real lf , but I learned h to deal it it .

Introduction
The purpose of th rpot is to describe the shopping faciltie in Pamplona , an to outline se recommending hops tht mig apal tourists with diffent interests .
Shopping ailities
As might have ben expected , a mi city as Pamplona is el equipped to deal wth a large number of tourist a residents goig shoppng .
Witn h ton centre itself tre is a wide selection of stores offering loca crafts , fashion clothing , fod or ie .
In additio , several r ark have space for 000 automobiles ad are coveniently lated on he centre ith easy acces and cha rates .
There is al an extensive lal u twork in orer to provide servces to ll the suburbs around the city .
pecil shops
Alhouh ost touists come to Pamplona for h famous festiva of " Bull Runin on the street " , an become assionte about the cuisine of Navarra . As a rsult , a e sos sh as " LA VINOTECA " n " DELICI " have dediated to eling selected op wnes nd typical fo .
Both sops are located in " Castillo Suae " and their staf speak English .
oreovr , a stre known as " KUXUMSU " ofer all kind of bulls - relte souvenirs n genune pieces that explain the Basque Contry 's cultre .
Recommnations for tourst
I would strongly recommend tha any touist , no matter about eir inteest , should isit the speci shops aforementoned .
There is itle doutbt tat th wil no only find original produt , but il so enich their minds .
Fous eole shold eaize th if they try to ga fmus all e time and waste thei me on it , hey wl not have ter ow rivte life .
But they ar srprised .
In my opinion , celebrities soul remember ht if they wnt to be famous they , probably , will be chaed by paparazzi .
On t oher and , hey r stil nrma plple , who have families , partners and riends and the sometimes wnt to ae a few prive minuts , without cameras , mia , newspapes , flashes and spotlights .
Probably , the want to go on holidays without reognise by other peopl , wthut giin autogrps an taking phots .
Moreover , rm time to tm they pefer to leve hose wthut make up and beautul clothes .
Wahat is mo , I am re , that os of them do it on purpose ecase their man aim is the amos .
d celeritie well now tht ey have to be controversial cas tat is the bet way to ahive their lovly famous .
So g names ry to go somewhere witout guard , without make ups to sow themseves to cause soe juicy gossip aout th to gai famous in h eaiet a .
To um up , famous is ambiaent and people who want to be aous should ealze it before becme a sta .

New tecnologies are chaning e way of thinking pivat ars in a ew muc more av and ecologica way .
On th n hand , pblc transport is wll knon by thir lar amount of benefices lie less polution and more conomical aspects .
Moreover , large crwded ciie using underground or bus ae usual a good way to avod trafic jams , saving im d stress of sad drvers durng commutations .
For that reason , fomeing e use of public transport as been te ma cnern of most of modern govrments .
On t other hand , hug technological improvements in c features like sel - driving , elctrical engines , soar power and ohrs , ae created a nw perspective of conceiving h wy we interact with cars .
Usually , cars need one hundred percent of our attention drng driving . Resulting as a huge disadvantage of car comped to ubli transort ecause we are not bl to enoy driving time by oin something else at h se tm we re dring .
However , hat is rely clse to chnge by ogle 's ef - Die ar which is a w technology able to riv ur r to y destination without mane intervention .

irstly you have to decide if you want to vit the North or t South pr of Ila becuse if y do a ll imrtion tour of te intire Peninsula you visit neither a alf of al o hv to vist .
If yu decd to vsit the orth part I thnk is good if o str fom Trento and his new musm about ntre caled Muse .
It is er bautiful becase it is structued like a mountain ( and so you n sart om th lat lor and th you go down visitng othr floors ) .
Then ou mt visit my ct , Mlan .
The yo mut see the centr of the city ecaue we have the Dme ( the hurch ) , t alery near he Dome , the litle hiden church calld S.atro and , at the e , the Sfrza 's cale .
Then u mu visit Vnie te cit on the wer where every part of the city is a ltle teasure .
If yu like the Egyptin story o can go to Tourin where you a find a huge a beautiul muse abou Anient Egypt .
If y want to ist the Souh pr of tay yo must start your ti from Florence , the bithplac of te culture , hn you mst go dwn to oe th capital city of my country .
ftr tha you have sn the Colsum , te Baiic of S.Peter ad the Trevi ountain d so on u ut iit ples .
In hat wonderfu city you us visit the stau of Jus Christ called " il Cristo velao " de by mable a then y mt vit t cere of th ity , fu of fantastic feature that make ti ity really particular lke Spaccanapoli , Hide Napl , S.Gennaro 's treasure , S.Severio hurh and so on .
If u are a lttle bit ire of a this trip you n go to Sicily where a bautful and special landscape n elcome ou .
Thr ae lots of things to visit in Sicily and th ms important cities r : Palermo , Messima , Siracusa , oto , Rags , Trapani , Agrigento ..

Nwdays , peopl hae ifferent viewpoints abou whether te most principle concern of hoosing an occpation is slary .
Personally , I disagree with ha the mney is te most imprtant consideration for deiding a job , because hre ar sevral facos equally mportant .
I believe tat ote consderatons are as imrtant as money .
Firstly , the core vals d the reputation of the company are neessrily cocerned .
Woing in a omany which is built up th gd oe values d a an excellent reputation could easiy obai the fulfilment nd keep pssin in ob for a long tie .
We would believe tat this ob is worth contributin to fo life .
Secondly , the co - worker reationship d the atmosphere in th wokplace e extremely imotant when hoosing a job .
Having a kind bs or frindly colleagues , for eample , can brin workers te sses of belongig and enjoyment rm rking , hence the woking qualit ma arse gratly .
Admitely , ney is ncessary for peple 's dai lives , atisfing their basic demand .
r example , he expenditur of food , drinks an commditie need he suport fom the steady income .
Furthermore , we may need mch more money to have some actities , sch as worldwide travel or outdoor camping f days .
In addition , in t life - log consideration , alth - care would be incresingl important with peole getting oler , ece enoug amount of money as a stale incm could not be disregard .
In conclusion , while salary still play a le and certainly ffecs people 's choc of profesin , I beleve ht money dos no outweigh all the her fators .
Karate gave me a new pupse of life .
This is o eason wh it is my most favrie sport .
Thee a vriou reasons why I am aboutely fascinate by hi martial art .
Behind every single moement you will find gracefulne a poer .
Once enterig a css , you r able to fully concentrate on the sport .
Ther re certain proceurs in the beginig of a lss which ecourages u to empty your mind and be rad fo class .
Especially in our hectic wod it is ve impornt to in to youelf and jus listen to yur body .
As a matia artis o sta to t a gret itness and your alance wl improve a lot as el as or flxibility .
ay chaacteristis wil increase immensely sh as confdece , se - defene or responsibility .
o will find ht y will not only benfit rom those in your normal life , t als in yu ob .
arate a be started by anyone and a age .
However to see a improveents you should atted regularly and at lst twice a week .
Only the it tarts to ak rat fun and you ertainly wll not regret that yu hae taken it up . Enjoy ! !

I like to dane a t .
On Monday and hursda I dane at a ance - school her , close to " M√∂r Centrum " , clld C - style .
I dance a mixtue of seet ane and so dae .
I also like riding horse , that is ne of t thing I oen do when we ae at Gotland , by e wy .
Right now I 'm ctually in a riding cose every uday .
We are ju hre gi , and I think this kind of riing is so much more fun than ring at a tabe wh b groups and so on .
I really like Spain , we have been there like si times nd th rason is at my dad has a project tere and sometimes he has to go there for a week or less and we av the lck to be ae to join him .
I real like to et sush and oter Asian foo , lik noodles .
My favorite estaurat is a restaurnt in Stockolm at √ñsterml alled : " Ne Peekg " it 's an Asian buff√© and the ake h bet fo .
My favorite subject in school is roably Swedih , Engsh or biologi .
My favorite bok is right now : " The fault in our stars " becaue s a real good subjec d it is sad but great story .
My fvorite movie is maybe " D " or " Grown ups " because tey r eall fun movies with ome sad momen .
On e holidays and after school I 'm oft with my friends nd family .
I hav a lot of friends in my ew cass and I kew almot evryone of the in my old school ( alle Kyrkskolan ) .
One of my other big hobbies is photographing .
I got oe own camr , it 's a Canon .
e bgges ccident in my ie w proably when I was three eas ld .

I lve in Camden .
In camden ver bloc cont with thre or four containers to recycle paper , plastic , glass nd old cotes .
Als , ery flat or use has a recylng bag to recle pper nd a plastic container to reyce ognic wst .
The council recollecs , once a wk , doo to door paper and oganic waste .
Thre s been an extensive campaign to limit e amount of water used to water plans a to wash cars .
Wat is more , people ae encorage to collect rn ater to use in ths activties .
Public transport was made accesble by reducin the fares and main it re or studes .
Nowadays the are a lot of informtion aou healthy , in order to ha good food hits , sleep te amonght of hors recomended by specialist doors , t .
For these reaos I consider tat cold be a od option doing ay port ta yu like or y may be interested in .
In my case I real like doing spinning , I use to do it ly twice er we but now I do ha every time I can .
I thik that in particular , spinning is a hard sport activity because when y was approximately 1 hr over your bik yo 'll obably eel taired .
During h process eple wrks a lot thi egs , mixng different posiios and speeds , And he mot mporant thin , t musi is alays running .
If o want to ls weig ths type of sport is rfect because it belong into te aerobic execiss to br the caloies tat we gt eatng fa foo whers it is suitale to people that ony us doin xrcise to entertainment .
Furthermore from he first tm tha I wa in h g I have known nice ad friely portsman o try to ive me advice no only ho improve my techniques but how avod ijury .
Athough it is kid of ard for young people w finished school inall , to understn that it 's definitely not finis yet , eucation do n't sps from then on and it is one of t mot important thigs to continue going to school .
On he h ther hand , oug people in snia do n't realy have the opportunity to choose , if thy want to go or not .
ey fiish school at the age of 23 - 24 including a further study without a chnce of work or anything else .
To this , I think , it is a way which ges in te wrong direction .
T to moivate people for duation , studying a school is a very hard hing if they all know al hoe Imaginations are not going to ppen anyway , whereas peole in Switzrland av to chose very early in ich dircion they want to go an wat their possiilities loo like .
Threfore , education shld be rechable r everyone , in my opiio , as long as posile , but nl if the oa nd possibiltie are clear .
Only if all of tht is gurateed the motivation wll ise .
Now shopping became n of the best way to spd time ith amily or friends , bu not everyone like it .
r th mot of men hoppin is so brig n xausting , u o the women it cn be h best way to mke betr tir oo , becuse they r so hay whe they by many lothes on sae , cheaper tn in regulr price .
I hink that t sopping is not enjoyable for everyone wen in the hop r a rod and very long queue .
Then yu spend more tim in the shop and you will be more tie .
In he g shoppin cetr yr ocke an be stolen by pickpocket and you can lost a l of moy .
Persnally I relly ie shopping , bcuse I am interested in ashio and I like look good .
So fr me shopping is very enjoyabe and I alwas forge about my pblems hen I ry on new clothes , which suit to me .
But I do nt ie wasting my tim too , so I suall do shopping in Monday , because after the weekend sops re away emp .
Nowadays the echnolgy and the society hae chnged in difernt ways and most peop ave mre free time than yer before .
This cold be goo , allthough ome peole sa we ned n't all hi tm and we have to work more .
First of al cod be said tha t society is spending more time oing relaing hing such as ging to t beach or et frieds , a some epert say that we have to spend mr te orking or studying because people is becoming lazier .
In contrast , te technology he been becoming mo useful and it could do wrs ht we a to do se years go nd hvig more free time uld be beter fo us .
Anoter point is that we can meet oe frinds or visit our famiy if we have more free time n hat is always good .
In other words culd be id that if we have ore free time r ife would becme bettr becase we can eny ith friens and do thigs ith our family .
Frome my pnt of view , hvin free tie is prfect because we an do me things that we are fond of and r quality of ife would icrese

My name is Sylwia .
I was born in Polne , a small town in Ukraine .
My school is located there .
hen I was 17 I movd to yv .
I sud filolog .
A w eas ago I orke as literal editor .
Now I am working as a jornalist at National Rado .
I hate my o .
o y s why is th .
I 'll tell yu .
First of all I t ls than 100 dollrs r my work .
My programs are for he old pepe in different vilages .
My colleagues ar brain - amaged .
I want to grow .
t instead I am writing abour stupid decorations , illnesses a other boring stff .
ex year I 'll be a PH .
I was oing to be a scientist , u I 'm n sure anymore .
I want to have kids d fmil .
I 'm tring to hose the bst tie r all tse .
a I ope with l that by myself ?
I 'm nt sure .
I ee awful .
Sometimes it 's hard to believe tha everything wl be OK .
My cuntry was attaked by usia .
o , save us fr he evil .
eah us ho to ove .
Frendship is one of t ot luable etiments for peope , especially f people wh ae in school days .
Maing new friends and shaing interests with others are lays exciti arts of social life .
en it ome to the best y r stdents to ake friends , se upprt ta particpating in comunty activities or traveling are pefrable , however , from were I am and , joining a sports em is the undubtedy te best choice .
First of all , fr th enertic students , oing sports is their favrte .
Thereore , joining a sports team from wre thy n share se interss an relax is h easiest ay to ow eah ohr .
Training in the same sports team , the stdnts can not ol release hm from whol day 's pssure , b so n bid up goo reltionships with others through the comunication and eercise .
For eample , e champions of Olympic Games , China 's faous synhronied diving athlete , GuoJingjn d Wu Minxia , th o gis enjoy a really go friendshp .
They ecame to know each other because they both joined the sae sports team , n en after exercised and layed togethe ; th finally become two envble frend .
Additionally , cooperation and coherency are always e ain essnc of a sports tam .
Hre , students learn how to work together , how to fight for the same al through acit teamwok , ow to contribute to the whole team ntead of ust thinking of slf , ad even how to ngtiate or dscuss wih ohrs , as ell as h to be ptent and ratinal .
Athugh there may be soe argument or disareement ong tudets , I always think hat everything is going to be ok because e sprs em wil be coerent .
Finally , oining a port tea wil prvide a long period of time f suents to get along ih ch ote .
Howve , if stuets paricipate in comunit activities , f eaple , dng vlunteer o in the town 's lbrary , he would ot ae sufficient im to comunicate ih each her snc most of their tme is full of working .
Meanwhile , studts cn lay wth each other duing travlin , but nly seral das a deficient an mos people will not ep in och with others ter te trip .
Sry that I haven't bee in ouch for a while , but I 've bee really sy lately .
w are you ? hv ou something ew to tell me ?
Is everthing ok with your family ?
Wl , I have a od new for u ! I met a wonderful girl at wec whe I went to the cinema .
I was in the queue when I s her wearing a stylih tigh bak ress .
S is pefect , with r long curly dark hair , a her pale skin .
S h a wonderf dy , ut in her face yu a s the perfection .
Her santed eyes nd her sin lips are gorgeous .
I at to itrodce her sap !
See y soon .
Take care ,

I think he most beauiful building ha I ha visted is the " Monmento a La ndera " .
It 's placed in Rsario , Argntina .
It w built on June 20 , 157 by the architect and engineer Angel Guido to elebrate the Flag Day .
In th ae place where Manuel Belran first raised the Argetna fg on February 27 , 181 .
It as a ower of 70 meters with a viewpont on the o , ad it is fmous f is i la ad h crypt in ribute to Manue Blgrno .
Insie the " Moumeto a La Bandera " o c see istorica objects about the histry of Argenina , in t undrground it 's the hall of honor of American Flags .
If you want to entr to th hall of honor or enter to th mnument it 's ee but if you want to go up to h viewpoint , unless yo are yunger 5 , yu must pay an entrance fee of 10 $ argentines .
The buildi is open fo 9:00 to 19:00 evey a .
Hate the or ov them , villains are he funniest par in every story ard .
Since I s a child , my favourite characte ae being he cruellest on .
Why ?
Obviously because in very sor , book or movie , despite heroes are weaker than ad charcters , they always wi !
Wha a boring situation !
r example , in Terminator 's movies illai s always stronger and more equipped hn hro , but at th end of the movie the righteous wins t battle .
Fiall , lates mvies are bas on cruel , bad , dirty nd strong characte ! Enjoy te !

Bulgran arnts can chose when her childre start school- at 6 or 7 years old .
efre they start school they av to finis preschool .
sually children go to kindergarten up to 5 yers old , n after that th start preschoo .
In is se te sart shoo at 6 years .
Some cildren trt school at 7 yeas l , it deped on when they ar born - at e beinnin or near the e of he year .
e Bulgaran scol ear starts in the middl of September .
So if the child is bor in e frst few monh of the yea , prnts n choose whn ther child ll tart school at 6 ers and few months or 7 yers and w month .
Most Bulgarian prent ar not age hei cidren to star school at 6 ers ld .
However , Bularan govrnmet s tining change e a so a children have to tart at 6 years old .
I thin I ca n't compare eduaton of chldren in chool or tertary educaton btween Bgarian d Australia , because I still do n't ae children and I am not stdding in university in Australia .

Unfortunately , our holiday dd o live up to e claims de by yo .
We hd a number of problems ; he irt one is concering the number of beds : ou offered space to sep or i pesns so we excepted sx e , u we nly had iv .
So , to of us d to hre one be , which is hardly acceptable
h othr proles is about e offerd exursions : You pmised a number of attractions , t two ( he walk up to he motain as wel as the visit of a istoric castle ) re not availbe .
nfortunately , we also ad prblems with nutrition : In you rochure it s to th we wl av a mber of restaurants round , but in fact there ws on o which as , in addition to that , really expensie .
This is in ou honest opinn not aceptale , because in th brochure you talked about more th one rstaurant .
To sum it up : We were ot vey eased with r holiday as we could not enjoy some of h tings you promised to us in e brochure .
We are the opinio that you ould t oer thins whc are in fact not available .
Yours incerely ,

Of course I think tht we should n't watch too muh television .

So peple just atc tv the hoe d lo , and stay in their houses .
They jt ca n't stop atching television , eause there 's js so much wat they le to wch .

As the number of traffic accident h incrasd dramatically ovr te year , finding e best solutions has puttd h government under pressure to whether implementing stricter penalties or ing alternative regulations .
Prsonally , ra safety can t be nured ith eter formr or later mthods .
Insted , it should be a combination of varous actions .
As a matter of fac , sevee punishmens can artly decreae the ate of ofences .
Nobod wat to ay an expensive fne or spen ime in prison , so fear of punishment mit be efetive and prevent peopl to make te ffence a send tie .
Morover , oe 's penalty also can be considered as a mirror at peopl can loo at n vod dig the sa things .
e main ffnces ae diving ver the sped limits , drun driving , drivig without lcences .
s peaties , epends on the severity , could inlude ine , licence suspension , comunit servies or impisonment .
Consquently , those punishments make the drivers have to concentrate on driving oy , thereore , miimie h amount of accients .
By te same token , a ole method could o slve he trafi roblems as driving offence are nt the oly reso that cause traffic accidents .
Authritie should ent more sfety olic on road and ensure by iproving th quality of traff acilties .
In many devloping countries , gvernent rarely attach secial important to oth h uality and uantity of the traffi system , especially in rural aea .
People easily get accidents when driving in narrod or severely damagd streets .
Furthermore , vhile collision are rising greal due to numbe of unclear ro signs .
Traffic ducation is alo an complsoy meure , especially to young generaions as they cover majority of offences .
Pope should be eduatd carefully about ll he safety regulations and lw when they e driving licence , te ore they know the rus , e ss isks are ten on road .
In general , betterment of reducing traffic accdens is importa .
Therefore , it ould be considered carefully on how to ombin bh severe penalties n many other regulatons .
Puic transportation once used to be a convenient and inexpensiv ay to transport neself in te cty .
Hwever , the increasing nuber of r ownersip s een aen place of pblc transportain , providing oe coveience to get around places to lces .
Trveing by cars gives fexibiity in our shedule .
We do n av to concern to cach a bus or trin at certain te .
We cn get on a car wenever we want to go to lacs d drive .
Such convenine of crs n enables us to use o time efficiently .
However , cars can not take ple of publi transportations just for ht convenience .
Maintaining crs is cost asociative .
Driving a c requires to fuel gs , d gas prices are becoming more and re expensive .
In addition , cars require rular maintenance such as o hage and checin tr presres .
Mechanical rolems n fen be a costly poblem .
Unlike public transportaton , one ha to be responsible for h or he tl of transportaion , and it coud be xpenive sometimes .
On the other hand , the pubic transortation is inexpensive .
Not to mention no eryone a affrd keeping a a th ther budget .
In other perspctive , ca rquire to rive .

The idea tha newsapers ll dinish by time due to people 's perspective twad surfing t internet for the orldwde news does not necessaril mean tt it a be taken for granted .
Oe of te mos cotroversial ssue nowadays is ta a large sectr of h society deals with newspapers as a aiy routine .
They ca n't withsand o day ithot skmming through their age with a cup of tea in the mning .
To e best of my knowege , it is a ay of having moe ta a way copin wh t lats techologies .
To begin , h ason for decreasing he popularity of news pprs is hat ost pole , rcenty , rely on bein online most of he time to follow the atest new all around h world .
he secnd mi reason is that online ew is fen fe of chage .
hus , popl re ne at ny time d for fre .
On th other hand , newspapers ar presented in a definite plc , wih lmited time in addton ey ae dail payabe .
Whle some y claim that cribility is the mi relible aspect of publishing .
It is obvos that the dily nespaprs hvin a respectful rputation are he one whc could be acpted by thousands of peple .
In his respect , newspapers seem to be more credib than nuerus webtes that ake up fake sories much more than publishing real news .
Furthermore , reaing hbts he ter own taste , specifically fr those lderl people .
Tey enjoy tuning te pages nd eading t headlnes using her eyeglasses .

In light of th forong discussin , it appears to be true ha the nternt is an incredible aspet owrd globaliatio even in daily nws wrldwde .
Howevr , the newspapers still av their lea in tha perpectve .
It cn be suggested that combination of ot arenas ill poitively influence the way of delivering ew .
La week one fiend of mine told me about a ew cafe that d just opened near my house and tht he thought it wa a magic place .
At first , I did n't belive that his place would be as amazing tat sh si .

It s almos everything that you need in a ca , cmfortable hais ad ofas , beatful eatures and a raly goo - taste coffee tat they ser in most of twenty diffent way and ih l toppings yo c think in .

When I came back fom my job , in the afternoon , I wr somehing comftable , take my bike nd go away ve h stet one with my thoughts and no one could disturb me .

When facing a decision on whether to shop in a shopping center or in small stores , any eople will choose h shppig cter bause you can buy al types of products at once .
Others , incding myself , believe that so in sml stores is the premium choice .
In h following essay , I will outline two eason to uppot my ew .
irt , smal stores provie proucts wt moe unique feaure and different seectin .
ha is to say , most smll stores may have heir own los on mugs or even T - shits an it is mr likely to find hanade products in it .
For nstance , my frien ne bough a ce scuff with ute amal figure in a small store nd I reall lik it after she showed me .
Theefre , he nxt day she brought me back to th soe , we foun u that they d ot ae he same scruff becau it is h nly e .
Although I was disappointed that I could not hve te sam scruff bu this is the fun at tha shop in small stre , u ca alwys id something unique .
Scnd , it is true hat sho in a shoing center is fast an covenent cause n can bu ll types of things togeher .
However , most shopping center provide limitd selections nd sometimes the prc is expensive .
In conclusion , I prefer to shop in a small stores becae it is oe like to find te one and he only produc whle it also provides a sens of treaure unting .
Te changes on television e evident , it could be because e soiey are changing too .
On television we n see at pple consme .
If tv 's programmes re a lot of rubbis , is becuse sme peop prfer hose .
So , we have to take ce of it .
Mayb , here are a lo of reeats of old pogrammes , but se of them r stl watched for a long nubr of eole .
n sometimes , pogrammes a so aggressive and ves people bad messge .
On t othr hand , thee is some channels , which show documentaries d programmes aot specific sbjcts like cience , at or history .
And hre are musical cannls too .
I thnk tere are goo tv 's programmes , but people do n't giv them he value ta they should ave .
Thee e a lot of old programme , u it is n't a proble .
The televion h stil someing importnt to hw .
I am wrtng to congratuate on the excellent Dumplings Fetivl which I tended in Cacove last November .

In my piion dumplin ith spinach tasted geat .
I am ipessed a cabaret h erormed during t fesivl .
Them jes were very unny .
Howeve , there a a couple of small sugestions .
First of a , th vanue itself wa ery crowded n parking alost impossibe to find .
It cud be a goo ia to nd a arg location .
I aw a parets with children but ids did no hve many attractions .
I would like to suggst fre special animators wgo ill entertain kid .
In ddicton tickets were o expense .

Consequently , positive d negative social impacts can be oberved by the population .

Firs of all , transport is te most reevat carbon dixie 's eitte .
As we nw , in all cities a lot of rs ae se every dy unnecessarily .
Proably , if we used up public tranpot like bus instead of private , we would educ the greenhouse effect because of e O2 podced .
Secondly , the ge amout of tter flotin in the ivrs and sea 's water destroys the cosystem nd has a ih viual impact .
Someties , cities get rid of rubbish hrowing it to the waer .
An eas answer could be building mo landfll .
Last , I 'll propose a solution of a cmon an near problem .
Reusing things that we do n't utlie ( like clohes , funiture ‚Ä¶ ) and gi them a ' econ ie ' .
I think we mst be dw to earth d cretie to cut down our daily ras 's production .

Chinese , Snish and Portugues no n of those languagues ae so popular as Englsh is .
Ovr 1 billion people aroun the world speak nglsh as a second anguage because of that it is considered the nivesal language .
Nowadays , it is an obligation to t a better job .
I wl discuss the importance of Elish as a ecnd language in Brazil .
Even hough , tudy a language become asie beause of the nteret , fuenc is harder to get he u study by yourslf .
Brazillians need lean Englih because it pns doors in business a in higher education .
In Bail , regular schools teac fo students e aic aspets of t anguage ad do no let the emerg in t lnguage .
It can explain a little t of Brazil 's lack of English spaers .
Learn Egish as a foregen language wil make a huge impact in razillians ' professional life to get a beter ostion .
To conclude , Brazil h defcincy of nglish speakers .
The brazillian educational system should be aware to develop more students ' langage sklls .
Learn Enlish as a second language will ep brazilians to gt a better j and have ore opportunities in their careers .
It is a ric , graceful ad delightful laguage to learn .

It is sd tat no future or pubc transportation . I think it wen I as youg , ut it is changed ile I am getting older .
Bu it is hanged ecently , I fell own d hurt my nee , so tht I can o drive by yelf .
Now I ned it again .
There r a lot of beneis by evelopig public trasportation .
Frst , it is more onveniet .
Most developed countrie developed h public transportation sytem to low he impt of gwing population .
Then , it is cs effecive .
Shad cost let te hge expense on deelopig and uildig the public stem possile .
Fnlly , it is environmentally .
Public transportaion is prve les energy cosumptio .
I stil thik the public transpotation stem wil be growng on in such a crowded era .
Ho on haven't o use public transportation ? do ou are tat there is no future r public trasport ?
I personly thik so , te reasons are as elow :
First , As we al knw , Cas play a very important role in r life , h more and more cars come into our famil .
Also travelling , of cours , that 's a big part of the function of the c !
The very el develoed highways , roads , ciy strees provide a good fountion f te cars , look at he North America , he highways ee develped anywhere , it 's ally your ow lose if yu do n't dri a car , drive on he(highways )
Scond , Human stat to learn drving at te age of 16 , and they n master the diving skills very quickly ( within a month or two ) , soon they can drie to herever they want to go , and we so se popl at h age of 80 still die to thi dstiations as they got used to it .
so who care to bother aking the public transportation anymo ?
Third , Th public transporation uks , hen o ink abut it , y n icure e crowded subways , irt ses , and t ificulty / hussults between te public transportation ransfer in yo nd .
h wste ime also should weight in , whther it is waiting for th trains , or waiting or t elaed uses , nt to mntion th longr im it takes compared to travelling in a car .
And driving yur on r can be very convnient oo , it can right come to your o arae .
Al in all , Public trasport is t as fs as a r can be ; it 's nt as convenient as a car an provi , so it 's uture is in doubt .
I age with thi statement that bein sf is btter than feeling sorry .
There are t three follwing reaons .
Firstly , no e like to be a .
Li is full of go things why do n't we lok to th full si of the cup instead of lookng at the ept one ?
Big a ad orr will destroy you life , because y will no be abl to work , at and ie in a good way .
All of this wil afec ur le badly , maye you ill ose ur ob or your health will nt be good anyore .
econdly , Eveybody seek safetiy in their lives .
Look around ou , cres and death ar srounding us , all thi people ar dreaming to lie a peaceful le without all th aspects of killng ad sadness .
Pope are fighting as tey can to only rech a cal ife where everyone of he can be safe .
Thirdly , I ive two yar without eling safe and comfortable .
T ar in my cotry ma me fe no lger safe .
o ht reson I beleive tat being afe is absloutly ettr than srry . I wi always remember my dad telling me to calm own , saying ta t life il go on and onday all of us will be stsied wih ti life .
In conclusin , I think that all of us shol see trouh ro -tinte glasses and be happy , because you liv a calm lfe whout anything mkes u sorry .
Be someon amus o a day
If I could change plces fo 24 hours with a famous person , I would like to be Paula Echevrria
I start telling something abot ula Echevarria , s is a very prey and famous actress , she also writes in a fashion blong , she is 34 yars od and she is married wit David Busamente o is a poplar and hadmesome sinr in Spa , they have a daughTer , r nme is Daniela and they are lik a perfct family .
I have chen aula eause se is poular , famus , rich n she has the perft husband but above l I choose her bcause she is friendly , ntelligent an h is lwys smiling .
Therefore she has everything good aobt being a celebrity but e most imortat is that he is a grt perso .
e me conclude by sain that I would ik to be Paula for one ay because N only is h a good professional ut lso a wonderfl role model to be folwed by veryoe .
I would like to talk about my hby of breeding bis , this hby is vy peasant to me and also or many peple , especially we o ha differnt kind of singng brs li cary or finches ‚Ä¶ .
This hbb give me pleasue nd god ses of natue , especialy when I wke up with the sound of the singing birds in my house .
At reent , I hae three kinds of bid , o of hem is yellow cnary , te seon one is finc , and the third oe is cmbinaton of two kinds of bids , Each bird has hs wn special voice .
I 've started this hob snce 207 , and sin then I hv tried to ave many different kinds of the siging bid , I spet one da in t week to tak care of the , feeding tem , cleanin he cages , change the water .
I would ike to recommend ti hoby to many people , because it give us t sense of natu , and fills te house with e joy and ppiness .
By increasing the veriety of car with new technolgy , peope 's demand hnt ' stop .
But are these new comers ill be pacd by publi trnsport ?
As technology nhanced t lie sstem in any way possibe , peopl becom re dependent an ca n't avoid it beacuse of many diffeent attrctios hat hes ar hve .
Anthe reason r using their wn car is hat ey acess in a secon .
Furure more , there are advantages travelling by a a , like seeing the scenery ad als the costs is les in cmpre to pane .
Bu it 's not possible that eer on hav and use their own ca .
In this case thre will be a hue hos .
raic am will cst a ot , suh as polution wch cetainly cas more health problems and will make expense not only for us but or h others as wll .
e solutin is publc transport again , wich enhace h pace of life ad ak easy acsss by subways and special rods .
On h other nd , by icrasing the population we shold evis th regulation with e fst pce of tehnolog .
To sum up , as thought h cars re too coenient to sme extend , but e co ill rece the benefit .
So for sure we wil use pbli transprt but ybe wit some hange .

Speaking English is becoming essental f students and workers .
o thi reason , scool of English are openig in al he big cities as well in most town .
Studying Eglis in our country let you coniue working or udying without hane our hbits .
Aywy , it ust be take int accunt that Eglish courss ae otn very expensive , n you have to study in a constant way to improve class by class .
In fact , uually hee is jut o cls per ee , and it is not eouh without studying by itsef uring h week .
Studying Eglish abroad is the betr ternative , bt it have advantages and disadvantages .
On oe had , ling broad will be pobably no cheap , so it coud be neeed to find a ob , b it would be at t same tie an aantage : wokin th Engis people would help you improve quikly ur speaking d lisenin .
On t other hand , living abroad you 'll need to pek English l te time and yo 'll have t opportunity to learn nglih in a sho ie , and in a ot boring y .
So probably , if you he the oportunity to sty broad several mnths , ou shoul do it , to learn English n lv a diferen exerence .

I am going to write but a short str that I have ea from h book : nd all r loe .
title : h kimno .
Written By Herbert rnes Btes .
There are two main character .
The plot is abt a man , Arthur , twenty - five eras l , enggd to a nice grl .
Arthur en to Lodn to an appoiment for a j inteview .
Te comany rqested im to go back three days later , so he was looing for a hoel that someone ha recomemded him .
He g lot and asked abot the htel in a cf wne by Blanche , a beautiful gr .
He w delighed wth her and fel in lv immediately .
This changed his life forver .
He Forgo is engagement a et to lie with Blanche .
But all was not as wonderful as the expted .
twenty - ive yeas latr he egrets hs decision and wonders what would have happened if he had not met Blanche .
I chose hs story because even thogh is novel s wrien in the erly twentieth centuy , th underlying theme , is still current tody .
And lso I would like to highlight at reflects the impotance of eer decision we ke nd ho it an change r futue .
" Atacama 33 "
" Atcaa 33 " is a recent American movi tat ells the real story of a gru of ners that kee traped in a mine 00 metres underground in Chil for w months .
This group h a lder called Mario aas starrg Antonio Baneras .
e fil is well - devlopd and shows he audience every litle isue d difficulty hat iner ad to go through .
Hoever the first 17 days in the oie coud tun a i tediu becue he director focsed in every ingle feelg of the trapped mn an thei familes .
fter ht pse he rescuers fund he lace whe the miners were hdng an te moment for rescue them sartd .
The characters ee perfect as soon as they were peole frm Chile and Bolva th er involve with h real accident .
Antonio Banderas ade an excellent wrk acting as a deserat leaer committed with the cal people .
Desit ome details , I think you ca n't mis is fil if you ant to know he trt of he recent mirae called " th Chlean minr " .
It is universal knn that opping is not always enjoyable .
Hoever , ohe peoe think in the oosite direction .
I agree that shoping is not always enjoyable .
Everyo know that shopping is a good w to spend time d get poitve emoons or jut rel .
Een though shopping can make bd affet on our health especialy we can fee ire or exhausted in he end of hard day .
At the me time there r on more opnon tat shoping is alws enjoyable .
Pope dcare that shopping can make or mood btte what in cosequence will make as fn .
As for me I do n't agree wt these people .
Qut oen in te shopin centre is not enug air d as the result you can get a eadahe or just fel bored .
In conclusion I would like to y that there are different iws abo shopping ad it 's not surprise becuse we are all dierent .
Do we need h intent to ejo life to e ll ?
Inenet has ben deloped a lo o th last years , and we can use easily r ding any aks .
u it is a go invetion or the wrld ?
To awer these quetions we hve to analyze giving some postive and egative arguments .
On the postve sd , e use of internet hps us to fd easily n quicly a lot of informatio ht talk but all the topics .
hat is more , we ca only he to press one comter ey to id ht we re searcing .
For this reon he st peole hav Internet at home .
On the negative sd , th s of Intert can be a aste of ime in ou lis ; his happens because althugh sear is faster , we a ditract looking at other thing on account of the attractive of the Intern .
Following th above argument , this is the danger of spnd hour and ous surfing te web a not ben in eal world enjoying t live .
To sum up , the Iternet is a good and eficient istrumen if we ko the corect use of it .
If t , it could be a waste of time tat can produc th opposite meaning of enjoying the lif .
owadas it is vr feuent to met new person comi rom broad ho speak different lnguages n speak about thei home countries .
his makes us cris to learn mre about foreign cuntries and teir cultures .
t to larn nw culture we must nw her languages , especially if we an to travel .
Due to gloalizatin thee re ore and mr ultinational companies ha require employees who can peak at least fent English ut if a andidat knw mor langages he can hae more carer chances and hieve o level postion .
In my opinin it is very important to sek seval languages o nl for above resns b also to ain brain , to ae the oppotunty to find a job abrod a , hy not ?
, To hae more fun with friends whom we now in or summer hlidays broa .
Unfortunately it is very difficult to larn foreign languages when we are adult so it is exemely important to teach and to study them since kindergarten age .

In answer to your question abou h us of intent beyoung popl of our age , I tik it is very helpful to get information eser a iker .

h aticl an t lecture ar aout the attitude towards taking medical experiments on animal .
The author lams that the main aim of the scientists is to reduce human sufring en if it demands rearch conducted on animals .
Te lecturer opposes ths ia , as , in her oint of vie , medical experiments on amals are n to be ken .
Firstl , the utho informs us aot impossibility to discover new ype of drug .
h lecturer ansers bck , saying hat different ypes of edicie av different impat on different species .
Sconly , th uthr suggests that it is ipossibl to replace experiments on animals wih ayting ls .
Te lecturer disagrees with that oin of view , becaus it is possible to nroduce computer substituio or do rsearch on tisues .
Thirdly , e athor consders suc tess to ep anml sufring to a minimum .
The lecturer argues tha as a biologist she used to see aimals uffeing without approprite aout of anesthesia .
The topic of the two passages is bout future use of hyrgen based fuel - cell enine .
Te article staes that the st efficint substituer of internal - combstin engines will be fuel - cl engines , because of their seeral dvantage , whie the lecre refus thi pit by stating hydrogen does not have so many adatages .
First of all , he reading pasage ys that intral - cobustion eine relies on petroleum , which wi be depleted soon , u hydrogen ill not delete easily .
The professor contends hs point by xplaining th hydrogen is , in fat , not easily fnd .
She dd that it is not irectl usabl , because ydrogen should be obtain in pure liquid state , which tecnologcally is very hard to be ke under -200 deres celsius .
Secondly , the article states that this hydroe use wi solve pollution probls , inasmuch as it does ot s caron dioxide , u water .
The professor contradcts the idea by sayg that wil not solve t pollution problem , because it rquies to be purified in ode to be used .
She explains tat in h proes of purefication , a big amut of coal d oil is bured , which pollutes facories rather tan the environment .
Finay , e artile says tha the ue of hydgen is ighy economic , becue it rquirs only half of th enrgy of internal - combustion poweed cars .
The prfessor says tt the clam in utre , becau the mteral , rom wch the cells are produced , is very expensve .
he explins pltinum is vr hard to find and without ths metal it is imossible to prodce hdroen .

Some peope claim that universities ad colleges should not spend a reat deal of mney on sports d social activits , as their budgts shud prioritize class an lbrries .
owever , as educational institutions , univerities n college hv an obligtion to provide a id range of knowledge to their students to help them devlop acaemicall and ocially .
let us loo at an example fo a univesit stdent .
he student a a grat deal of assighmnt and projcts , so he pnt more im to access the libabry , becming more ambitin to stud book and uin a computer to searc latest informtion .
Sometims he felt trd to do pars , going h gym to play basetball .
Therere , not oly did he get hg score in the rports tt absorbine a eat eal of nowledge at the libabry , t ruce the study stress and aintain healhy in t gym .
I had a imilar experience .
when I studied in th university , I t in the clases hou by hour in a day .
hn I finished classes , I would ke to acces the health center no ony to do exercses , bu I culd maintain healthy .
Univesity , I also have a o of assighments , so I lie to go to libary to study where is mor quietly , sacious and interne accessible .
That 's why I like to go to school in terms of go facilities and widespead information to facilitate me to be a successful prso .
Sports and socl activiti cn greatly improve my efficiency .
In addition , my academics education lso stand out in my student life .
r thse reasns , I maitain at universtes an olleges sould send enugh money on aademic education and socia movements to prepare students fo thei utue development .
Academc ducatin will always be at th eart of a unvesity .
In universities , sorts d ocal actiites shuld by no means take t plc of a focus on academic stu .
I believe ha universities nd coleges shoud spen dequate budget on academics as well as orts and socl activities .
Teenagers usually do n't knw wh to study bcause they el confusd .
It is a eat ie stae but at the same im is difficult , sometimes teeagrs av problems ith ter famiies , wh temseles , as a result he do n't ow hah to choe .
Many mes wen people leave high school and he go to Uiversity , tey realised afte several months ht the caer thy had hosen it is not fo them .
In the other hand wen tenaers take a year ff is helpul for them to bcome atre .
Yu can work , travel , going to an exchange study , est a do omthing hat you are interested .
A lot of peole think is a waste of tie , u tt is not rue .

I watche the film on month ago and it has really impressive and engrossn efect .
The fim tls abt a movie shootig and advntures of filmng team hic is in Boivia .
They try to make a film which explains o Christoph Colomb conquered to Amrica and mentin about what Coob 's as er .
They come across wit som problems while tey e shooing te ilm and this supply quie a few strong highlights .
The bot of them are imperialism a poverty .
Actually , hy nt to dscribe he hitory of discovery and cnquest by a critia perpectie bu ile shootg the il , appear sm protests aginst the privatization of aer and th tea fal it a cha nd then lm starting to give om social , poliic essages .
The mesges a very ipotant which effect me .
The prate copanis y to kep puli 's all waer hich is vital to live , rain is in dangr ; Een the rai ‚Ä¶
he crucial pont is transformatins and exprerienced contradictions of he charactes .
In or imperialist and capitaist World , we need moe films or rthistc influences whi entio te robles about or life a realities .
I do n't think hat there is no future for blic tansprt n I agree ht travelling by ar is muh more convenient .
If th goenment provide good transport infratructure lik moder a comfor bse , traffic re Meto ine he peoe would rather to us public transport than travelling by car .
Now a days olds are facing te big issues ie climat change and carbon emission .
Governent shoud promte e good mde of tansprt in rder to reduce arbn emission and people wud be encouraging to go green .
ay times because of hu trafc congestion on rod we waste our time . while using public trasport like Mero sae o times .
The are any cit in wor , planning to ar ree dy and promote to e of public transpor .
Departmn stoe are found in all big cites .

In this ft - moving world , hpping is the one of he most imortnt things but I strongly elieved it is nt always enjoyabl .
Fist , shopping comples r ull of brnhes of ig han - stoes , so this an be boring to walk throuh them for a ng ime .
Second , if you ca n't control your shopping hbit , o will buy more and mor tigs you do n't need , so that you a have a poblm with yu budget .
In my opnio here is he reason hat soping is no always enoyabl and full of pleasure .
CONTRIBUTION TO A NGER PIECE
I always lo writing .
I ve alway loved reading .

There are suc an nteresting websites nd blogs where you can find ut somethng very uefl ha yu would he never expected or unsurprisingly , misinfomation .
HY BLOGS APPEL TO BOTH READERS AND WRITRS
Many people will nd blos nd websites usul in ordr to meet new people .
We now ha makig social contacts can be ometimes a proem or a wide ange of peopl , who sometime fnd it a lnely n dauting experience .
However , on he internet yu n ind not ly meetng ponts but praticl a vry thought - provoking ricles in bogs .
In my perience , being under the scren of a personal comper wl ou be abe to show a exhnge ideas or opiions easil as if you have to do in frnt of someone el .
owever , oth readers an writers t only do it as an altruistc and philantrpi way bt to get fame and poularity at th same time . logs and webstes coud give em h cnce to came famous if ty really appeal to a large amount of pple d they will abe also available to er money thanks to he publicity .
Consequently , we should nver blind trust in everything we see or rad on te Interne .

To clarify what he situation is , it is tut that not everbody ma be interested in blogs or webites b e fact is writing or readng in a blog coul give to people a actical way to communicate d sare prefeencie , beliefs or thoughts , however , more or less reliable .

Visiting musums is essential parts of her trav to new places f mny people .
Besides seen touristic or historical places , and attending open a activites peope also want to see musums of the cy thy isted .
Because mseums ofe so many inresting and different hins dffe fro oher places in the visiting iy .
First of a , people vis museums to ler history of the visitig city . We know ht museums generaly estblishd to epose special and unique belonging which are historcaly valuable as wel as to expose modern belongings .
These old things in the museum give us uniqe nfrmation abou the history of the city ad s social lfe .
or example , wh you go to Metropolitan mueu of art in New Yrk city , you can s lo of hstrical monuments and items blong to American history nd also ter countries ' history .
Observng these tems yu a g idea aou te old times of the visiti place .
Secondly , musem are places from ere you can lear culture of the viitng iy .
Many items in mueums has cultura value beside hisorial alue .
F instance rt museums include rt collections such as pintings rom many different artsts .
ome of them ere ae in mden style and some of thm in classic .
You can get idea the culture of the cy fom these paintings .
hird advatae of visiting a museum is that you a have un visiting a musem .
Beside histric n ulural haracter , sm usums al n be soure of un including attracie ativiies .
If yo bored to e classic museums o can go to tematic museums sh as natural histy museum .
There you an ee dinasours fro ol aes .

In su , museums re attrative placs fo ourist to discover about h ity tey visited .
By visiting muses we can lean nteseting detas about te history and culture of at society .
In aditon to ving lts of information we ls can have f to see iterestng thins in the mueus sc as hge dinaours . Y ma feel inomplet if ou do not visit the museum of th new place you travel .
I ca n't age wih a statement at tere is no future or pulc transport .
Tody plnty of ecology orgaistions are trying to rise people 's warness of the evironmen deilemen .
Tey sa it is caused by burning o , so he society demands itself to enclos it .
It is often necessary to hve a ca when ivig in a small ci or ilage without public transport , n it is understandable .
B while ling in a ig ity , where there re lts of us tops , tram stps or metro stations is quite icomprehenible ht eope wan to drive ter w car and be stck at a blc while rush hours .
As h ology organisations says , it is bette for the enviroent , and as we decided , it is bett for us to save our prious time .
Increasingly peopl prefer to s public trasprt ather han to drve a ca fr hese reasons .
It is no true th publc transpor has no fuure .

Dear Chairmn ,
I am writing to o to rai an importnt issue concernin chool lirary .
I oo forwad to understanding and I pe we wl reach a cosenus .
irst of all , it is very mporant to me to dtermie the basi problm of our shol .
For many years we , pupils , hav bee waiting for library .

Tgethe with an unofficial Student council create a ptiion which is to rais te issue among teachi council .
Our priory is gd preparation f seondar school certificate .
o this pupose we ned a quiet pla to learn .
Moreover pupls demand is th possibility to borrow books .
It is the most important matter , because most of us is ot abe to uy ihly ducational books .
Thy are imply too expensiv .
O requet boils down to the fundamental role of education .
It is broadening th horizn of our knowledge .
Besides issues tat have been already mentioned hre is lso undisputed fact that if our school ad a rich computeriz library , it old be more reprsentative .
Giv te rationality of t above arguments , we , pupils , xect a positive considratio to u request .

Or liv has changed a lt from the lst centur due to the technological improvements ad society chane .
But h will hange the people 's life in 50 years ? .
hs is a difficult ueston to be answered too quicly becse we have to ae int account at we hve no enough knowleg at all to do it .
That 's why we have to escribe soe important ideas elated to his topic .
First of all , as we sid befre the pole 's lives ave caned de two ipotant leents which are he tehological improvements and society changes .
The frt one it is er obvious ecause every day the rsearchers are discovering new things and improving t scientif knowledge that allw us to create new invents d improve the l ones .
For exmple , one of te most imortant devics hat ha taken an important ole in our lies is the mobile pho which h changed exemely fast over h lat en years .
Another example is the cars which are aing the same w as well as t mobie phoe has done .
The second one is very important to becuse society has cnged a lot as well as he people 's mind .
Fo nstanc , one hundred ars a wa impossibl to see a woman working and carrying on economilly he whol family lone or studying a degree in h universty , thin that today e very usual and wel accepted in or soiet .
In addition , ter are thr conditions and facts tat has helped to change he eple 's lie such as olitical deisions , global wars a global economical roblems , etc .
To sm up , tee r many ssus that fects eople 's lives d we do not kn how it would chane in the future , b we a sre at in 50 years fro o it would be an impornt ange as wl as it happee tes last 50 years ago .

So o , if you 're thinking hockey is for y I reommend you to buy a pa or gd gss ots .

It was the usul Friday afernoo .
Michael was hom aoe , spending time in front of h TV , watching his favourite movie .
Whil he wa ost in h actin , a strnge n unexpected sound ce rom his siste 's beroom .
He continued watching the movie , thiing it must be nothing .
en there it was again , h sound .
" Hlo , is someoe tre ? " , Michael asked .
Sudenly , a loud ng .
Micel reached for hi baseball bat , ready to look ino ht a going on .
He tipto to his sister 's om , knocked silently , hoping there s no nswr .
Ad there was n't .
" Oa , I ink it 's time I go in " .
He slowy opeed he oo , and a c juped right in fot of him . "
A at ?
Al this was caused by a c ?
My siter shoud defniely clse her windows , I am going out of this hoe , I sould lee this t here and let it in r things " .
chael cloed the dor and knew at tha mment he a me a mistake .
Destination : Disney .
Do ou imagin travelling to the Unied States ?
He y ever gone to a place designated only fo aving fu ?
Disy is he drea of a lo of eple in the orld , many of hem ae sa tht it is a agic an awesome eperince .
Firstly , Disey is nt a ommn detinatio like beaches or mounains , it is a place ha requireds a dfferent mes of transport ince it is in a long distance .
The vcatos stats when h plane takes ff ad nerves and hpiness blend creating an experience u will never forget .
Whn the plane arrives at the aiport of Miami you can preciate e beautiful viwe hat hi lac offer .
Secondly , The entrance of Disney is incredible and colorful , it als has t min characters in it .
Disne has uch a lo of amusement pks whose ake this plc fantastic .
Each of e a a differe pic and amazing coasters perfect to adolecents .
Althogh this place ffer a very good servie to eat , you cn big your w food .
To conclude , isne h so many facilities that it is impossibl to ge bord , you can relax in or otel nd have an unfrettable momt in the roller coasters
I do n't agree with he statement .
I think ha pblic trafc wll be more used in the fture .
Ideed , it is true that travelling by car is much moe convenient .
But cars eed perol .
Fsil rsorces are abot to run o .
We have to therefore coos the ote altnatives .
Fr the ake of tt the public transprt will be improve , nstead of being rplace by cars .
On the her ha , more electric ars are produced very er .
This ecnology will be improved furthermoe in the fuure .
is ac could keep t share of ars .
Fo the above reaon I supect that the sare of public ransport do n't decrease rathr incrase in he future .
Te share of ars could rmain because of the letric ca .
Bt the form of using cas could change .
or example car sarng coud icrease in the city .
I 'm not addicted to films at so ever , bt I prefer to watch e one ha e said to be good and stand out from the othe .
esids that , if I d to hoos a ype of film I ould say , the comedian d h cion ons re the mos appealing to me if they have a rea rmatic a cohent story instead of a fictitious and meaningless one .
Rcenly I sw ome pretty god films called " The olf of all Stree " and " Caita Philips " , fim hat cugt my attention sice he first inute .
Hoestly , they lsted for 3 hour bu th most impressve of l this is that they wee able to crete a singl rld between me d te scre for all tht time .
They really aught my ttention , the had al t characteritics that I consider e basic ones in a film , ot couting it h astonishing acos that made an impressive performance .
All I expe in a film is the ay ty establish connections etwee he actors and h adienc , in a a tt allows them to play with th characters lk if ty wr upets and to cete a coherent ad atractie film .

Becaus of him I am what I am .
I think verbody knows the importance of having a person , o is always there .
A person that tkes a fixed place in your life nd without hat person yo ca n't live .
My bt find is called Chistoph .
He is 1.80 meters tall and 23 years old .
He is a soiler in e litary in thu , wer he rks as a eacer .
In futu he ants to get a gneal .
We have t us yars ago , when we were babes because u moters wre and re gd friends .
He is a er nest person and has sort blond ha and brown ees .
During e holidays and at the weekends , he wear summer clothes .
As you ca think he is a ve straight erso , ho knows wt he was .
But he also can be harmfully nd sesile .
For me , a good person to speak about everything epecialy abot my problms .
lthough we hae many different vies of the ie we understa each other and are et friends .
ny pele around e orl follo pssionately nternational sprs evens .
That cod be a grea y to sto interatinal tensions , lhough criis and wars still eit .
The most imporant evts takes place in some different cotry every or years .
Of couse during these vets ll he wrl wtc it .
Sports in geneal re followed by a he perentage of the oplation .
Usually I do n't ach spors math , I used to do that smeties , but nowaays I 've ben thinin hat it 's ju a waste of ney and ie .
Probably beause I do n't like team sports .
I 'm keen on indvdual discipline .
I do n't want to appear o rigid but I 've seen o many times eple fogt t el problem and think only to hi ing .
Pople seems to be dstact fo thir ral life .
The point is that we have to ak the world tter nt js sometimes , but forer .
Duri the evens eope seem to fall into a peacel ram where all the country love eah other without ow racst eeling .
Whereas oten we se bad behavior .
I 'm hpy aot tha , but I still thinking tht it 's o the rut .
Probably us , as huan race ecesitate of this in of things .
I 'd pefr that people eress thr good behaior idependentl of iternational sprts events .
On te oer hand , sometimes I 'm feing apy during th evet ecase peopl see to be so excite .
In my opinion we have to deal with a lot of other important poi elated to our culture .
I 've ee interested in ay an instrument since I a a chl .
Whe I was young we used to ha a piano in our dining oom because my mther used to play that .
Latent fingermarks re omonly fund at the sce of crime .

Hae yo ever houht w we ed sorts ?
As we ll kno it is an essential part of r life .
I elieve that nobod c do without it .
Firstly , sort is the be way to improve yu immune syste .
For example , playing spor at leas o times a week prevnts diseases and obsit .
at is more , if you ant to get rid of depression or sres - go to the gym .
According to the scientic research mentl health is closely connected to the phyical on .
As or me , I am keen on basketball as it is my personal way to unwn n wor out .
I am int it cause it is quite catc and spectaculous .
Moreover , it is consieed to be on of the most ctie and poplar kins of sort ll arou he orld .
To u up , I belive that if yu want to be menall and physiclly i - try to do some sport ad eercise . As do o wory if u are no so good at it , just eep doig it n enjoy yourself .
Plants ve been widely used by almost all culturs in past centuries for medcl purposes hat are commly known as herbal mdicies ( Izzo and Ernst , 20 ) .
Tese are define as plant - derived ubstances d occur naturally wit no or minimal manufacturing prcesses ha manage and remedy varius health conditions effectively ( ent , 2008 ; Tahjian ; Mri and Jahangir , 200 ) .
Although , herbal edicine hv significantly peormed ll in e treatment and manaement of illness , pole have increasingl cosumed these products via sel - direced thray .
This say wi discuss tat the is onsiderable evidence f h possible detrimenal ifluence on public helt e to e increasing use of self - rescribed herbal meicines and ta a heah criss is likely if no acto is taken by helth rganistions .
The most rcen thriller I 've seen is " he Miserables " .
However , I 'm not refrring to the musical o the intermediate verion ; the oldest version is t refenced o .
It is a movie hat has presents a lo of richss in characters and historical acs .
Y ar abl to analyse human emotions d rationalise oral situations , so it is a movie tht provides a t of fctos .
I foud it vy exciting because it shows a pre - revolutionary era when Ja Valjean is sent to work as a slae r stealing a sml iece of bread .
Aft he en i sentence , he has to solve an moal sitation that pov who he rell is .
It is vr proound to , bcaus it hws you poblems tha old happen bt in a mior scle .
What really akes h dfference is if you choose to hep others or not .
I think pepe o rea the boo ( rtten by Victor Hugo ) , who are intereted in this historica iciden , or o merely wat to analyse human relationships mus see te movie .
Tis is due to the ft th it will each a l about the Fenc daily ie d bou wht insprs pepl to improve an case od .
As th an eft he caf√© , Maria saw ha h phone was sti on the tabe .

In purpose of buildin mo neessar nworks of housng d transot , areas of farlnd , forest and wetland have to be destroyed by many contris oda .
Such lrge - scle building projects has created a large amouts of problems for both human eings an anmas .
As to people who ake their ivngs by selling th products they obtind frm farmlands , foests and wetlands , they will lose their sources of incoes .
In addtion , frmes , huntse , fshermen nd y other people that are ud to ling by such eas ave to move to cities and t to find new jobs .
The e lss likely to in go jobs because most of them e not ighl eduate .
As a result , th will not ake enough money to affod their livings in ran areas and vn face probles of poverty .
Meanwile , id animals hih tke fests and wetlads as their habitas will los ther homes and ind it dffiult to survive in jungls of concte . Enangered animals will be ader to be found after t destuction of tir homelands .
Also , thr il be no frs grass nd grains f doestic animal , such as cow , laps , chichen to be fed .
To euce abve problems , it is necessary or governments to pn careuly before contrucion of buiins and tranport and try their bst to decrese the side effects .

I agree ih the statement that soppng is o always joyable .
Personally for me shopping is er pleasat , bt somimes it can be a ttle tirig .
In my opinion is a few adanage of shopiing .
First of l , if we are in shops , we can b everything we wt .
noter good point of shoiing is fact , that it coud be rlaxing for some peope .
I like uyng some cohes or osmetics .
It ve me so leasure d u .
nyway , it 's al se disadantags of shopping .

In addition there are many pulic trnsport which could rop you f in front of the pa .
wher you can hav an mazig nit
We have an active Nightlife in is ity , le gigs are performed from Wedneda to unday in severa pubs wit fee access and u ciems have alws had a ood movi sting

Wha 's a description of a famous prsn ?

So do n't ll me that famous peopl do n't enjoy bin on the fst pae of th newspaper or any oher agzine .
In my opnion th fm is a ed for actors and musicin of the popular clure .
Despte te fact I sa tht aous people need to be well known , I thn that ca n't be applied on politician .
The personal pace in their life shoul be large than in a movie sas , but they shoud mak their escision transprent for st of t population tho .
It is their work to mk descisions that ensue h beneft of he pope in their coutr , but we do n't need to kn nothng else abu them , aft they com home to pend sme time ih ther families .

nce on a tie , ther lved a boy nmd Michea .
He lived in a vilae near a ailway station .
He was very naughty and ws not much intereed in his studies .
He was a very ig menace and the vlagers hated him because of his mischievious behavior .
One day hil he ws all alne at home , he thught of callig th fe for and lied a pretended as if his hose was on re .
People gathered around his house hearing m screaming out loud and within no time the fe rce ao arrived at the destination .
At h same im , is pants reached e ace and seeing e bg crowd nd te fire force ty o horrifid .
he ran towards teir huse , worried for their child .
Every one s shocked ad no one knew wa s happening .
Later is parents became vry angr and even got him beaten up for hs mischief .
Hi prens solded him and made im make a promise to he ht he wo n't lie ever in hi life again .
He was vn mde to apoogze to ll hs neighboring vilager .
He wn to his room a felt very bad for wh he dd .
ichea closed th door and knew at at moment , he had made a misak .
lst month i wathed the Fat an Furious 7 , a im stred by Vin diesel and my faorite actor , Dwane ' T Rock ' Johso .
this film wa about h preious roberry which had bee acomplised by Vin 's gangs leads to th hatred of a crimina stared by Jaon Stahm .

Morevr , t specia effect whih is displayed re so immense and lead us to feel e emotion of he actos .
Dear Mac ,
I am sorry to har tt y 've got to ge up either prt or msi .
I know how uh you like both ctivitie so st I suppose y ar hvng a hard tim .
Soccer s lays ben prt of your li nd memories of o kid kicking a ball bigger than you are stil vii in my mi .
I sll remember te first day we wen to attend a soccer leso o promised me yo never give up!. You dreamt of becomn a pofessioal player and ecied wh ur life old be li ne ou eached it .
o 've kept working on it for lmst your entire ife nw nd athough yo hv not become a professional one you have eer give up .
Hwever , iano is as part of ou life .
When I firs introduced you to it o were qute sceptical of your possible acievments .
But agin you neer gve up and ow you playing in the 3rd Orchestra in on shows how big you r .
Proof that not only yo are vey determined b ht piano was meat to be .
We have enjoyed usi together o nearly 20 yars and most of o od tes r related to hat .
As yo asked my tae what I trie to do was nohng bt hinkig of you as if you ere my on .
I imgined the scenario with Mathe coming up to me and looing for oe advie .
Firs off , I would take hi to a og journy by ca .
I 'd uggst we take some das off togeter and had for n particular pac he wuld like to go to .
en onc we get on the car I 'd let th music we hd planned before as the ideal background absorb us before uttering any ods .
Only after driving for a while I would ask him to tell me wa he 's been up to lately and if tere 's anyhig he as't ld me bot ut en to menton w .
At that point I would l hi tlking go without stopping him fom interruption .
I 'm convince he 'll speak hs thouht at one without beting around the bush and al h ea an doubt wil slip out .
By o he wll be abe to nswer himself many uetions he 's been troubling with .
ll I 'll ae to do is just point out what t an poins r hat he is o dull to ee .
Because tht 's what an outse criterion is eedd o .
Someone se a jt hep you think out and be nothing ut supportive .
Then he 'll be lst or words as mch as he spoe and he will be lling to pt the whole thig asde d just lse himef in some dnks , although he hasn't cm to age y f tha .
Perhaps th ne day he wo n't ven be able to recall ha the speakig wa about u I 'm pretty sue that after all ee dow himself he il know wha bet ov on is to make ! !
L 's talk abt sort
Do yo av a avourite sport ? I hve !
I really enjoy voleyball and hor ring , although my favorte is swimming .
ve yu ever tid it ?
You shod .
It is a hd port , but when y e it , you foget all yo probles .
Swimming is a antasti prt , esecialy in he Summer beaue in the atr you a get resh .
If ou e statig ths sport , you should n't be afraid of the wter .
Do wh you can do , an when y think that you ca n't do it , try yur be .
o just need practise .
Everyone should have a spor , whe you ar doing it , you do n't think aot anything mor .
You just tr to do your bet .
iving my wn car sees really convenient for ravellin , bu publi trasportaion is the mos effective way to bring people fro a place to other .
Try to imaine tat , if eeryone in the cty a his or her on vehicle , we woud be always late ue to he terrible traffic jam .
In fact , ravelling by c is not convenien en people ha ter own cas r ther family or themseles .
The reason is that we ave to wak up in th ry erly mornng for voiding the traffic jam to ateding sool , working , ec .
e ma advatage of pbic transportaton is tat it c trasport a larg nmbe of passengers at a relatively low co .
For examle , a u an ake mo than 40 passengers one ime at a low cost .
r another , t suba is able to tanspor a number of peoe around the city .
T second benefit of public transportation is ha it can reuce the ai polutin r a city .
Too many vehile in a coned city would crease e carbon emisios .
In conclusion , public transportaton would stil pay an imprtan role of transportion in a city unless the environmental vhices a promoted by the government and the roads nd highways in a ty are maned we or accommodating a huge mber of cars .
It 's really imprtant tht we do hing we should do .
So , we c btain ertain benefits ad more doors that can be opened easily .
There are some eope that spend oo much of thei time doing nothing seful though otes my say that it helps to be more relaxed in their les .
Personally , peope must dedicate most rt of their time on things th shold do f to importan reasons .
First , you gain tie doing essential hings .
By doing so , you immediatey take advatage of the ime in your life doing omething essential .
For example , when I was 17 , I was abou starting my irst day of class in e university .
I started to ee boe with complementary courses on my rriculum because there were th kind of coures that d n't ve any hlp to my uniersity carer which is maly abut Syem Engineering , and I a reqied to tae compementary courses ch as Elogy , Laws , and so on .
ut later en I graduted , I realzd how imortant were thse sujcts .
I was able to explin something basic about Ecology hat my grandfather a trobl ith in the countryside hen I went r a vacation .
That experienc taught me how imporant it is din watever you are required to do - sh as taking complementary courses - without rejecting it , becuse somew it 'll be helful ler in the life .
Seond , if ou avoid doing things only becas thoe do n't lke you , you 'll mis opportunitis .
You 'll dedicae your time ony on things for personal enjoyment ad it really il hurt o .
o insance , a ried of mine called Freddy ws in a social club in the city , he w requested to do a running around te pool for 30 mntes .
He refused to do this .
fter all , n gu decde to do e venture .
He ran for 30 inutes arou the pool an when he finished , my friend started laughing at him .
Nobdy had noticed ht th president of the social ub ha an ward o the runner , n he recied an amout of 30,000 dollars eause of hs effort .
As you c see , my friend lost the opportunity because he did n't like ha he s requested to do .
To m up , it is a good decision if you do tngs that are necessar or neded at t moment thogh you do n't like it .
If you do essential thins ou gin ie in your lie at he se time .
If you would rther avoid essential or require things you 'll lose mny chacs to succe .
So , we should fou our mids makng h rght decson ad pen u ime wisely doing hat is ot importat .
Some people think that omputer are the ms important inventio over the last entur , while thrs think ha ae a lot of nventions ve te history that are more important tan te copter .
Personally , I think the computer brings any changes in the world , and is o ha I think it is the os importan invetio .
ome eople say ht e comptr change te way people e h world , ad this hage te way in which hman percve eveythng hat happens rund he wrld or oly in their social life .
For example , how n pern a be infrmed wat hapes to te ther side of the rld with nl a cick .
For other at , other people nly s the computer to have communicaton wt someon , have entertainment with some movies , wich an be from nywhere , or sipy have some un online wih your friens tha ie abroad or re busy all the ime .
In contrs , some people tink that he computer is just on more vention in te hitory of humanity , and although hey accept that is an important invention and changes the world , they prefer to say that exist inventions more imortant than the computer that nowadys we still use .
For example e paper or the wheel .
Overal , people ae divide in what they think about th mo important invetio in t world an wt changes these obcts make to the world ad humanity , I still think tht e compuer is the mo mportant invention because it t only hnges on at of t itory like the parper or the hel , it changs very aspect of the human 's life .
Prsonally I rfer differn movies .
The choce aways depends on my md .
Most of th tm I ke to wac cmedie , oe stres a adentre mvis because these type of films can help me relax after a ar working day .
I do n't like horrors eause they aways hav a d impact on my mood .
erefore I ee more peaceful when I view something nny , adventurous d undemanding .
In my opinion , people atc movies because they want to spend their leire time .
Movie compnis offer all kinds of vies so verybod a choose something tha he ike .
I think ote media ill lfil thse functons as el .
Fo xaple , ooks also ep us relax .
Beside , we can learn something knew from bos .
Dea Ms Hammon ,
Thank you for yo reply , it s so usful , but I still av some doubts and I ll be real gl if y coul ive me this neessry iformaton .
First of al , I want to know what water pots do you offer , beuse r roup of students would be probably interested in doin something reatd to water , for insance , surf , diving or sailg , due to h ct that th r used to being constanty in ontac with the sea ( we live in Barcona ) and , therefore , they velop a real passion o it .
In adtion , I would also lie to ak y out h type of equipment y can lend to do his knd of activites and sprt I av jut mentoed .
r exame , for dong diving , ae you provided of al he diving ga ( oxygen ottles , wesuits , security elements , etc . ) ?
That is something really imprtnt for us .
As u said , the safet of t students is our maxum oncern , we must be completely sue ta you will take ar of te , chiefly beaus ms of the stunts are still yong and we have a strong commitment to their parnts .
Yours truly ,

In my opinion , his statement uld be said f a peron who lives in a cty th litl rafic or a perso who prefers avel in a freedom way istad of big concerned about public transport schedules .
Howevr , I do n't thi that this afirmaton would be orret fr a person who live in a g city , what is re if yo take in a count t economc aspets .
The most comn problem in crowded ities is that usually they have a lot of traffic ja , nd th is becau the ae too many cars .
Since my view , to u th public transport in hi case hav w important avantaes : e first o you do n't have to ae about pking ; te second e you can move in a relaxed way reading a bok , listening to music or talking with other passengers .
evertheless , havin a r in a bg city is quite expensive nowaays , not only cause the petrol pic is continuously riing u also you av to pay ih taxs fr e r .
In sort , lhough trveling by car is more comfortable d easier than do it by public transport , it is not probably than in te near futr they disappear .
Is it true that there is no futre fo public transport .
As i recogized here r severel ay to improve because we are trying invent a lot of thing vey day .
You would no thin ut hn you are just tinkin yu my hae the chance to invet something new nd usfl for humanit .
Invetors work years to rch hir goals ty re working with ther project lke you every dy .
So we have the chanc to improve public transport .
sig w vehicle , travelling a be re cofortable and easer .Everyone in this wold would have a beter lf .I am elly hpp when I mply s a n us with air conditioner or nything wih can mk trvling enjoybl .
Ms of the pope are frustrated or nervous becase the have to e public transport .
If te bs drivers c flow heir me tble tee wo n't be y aguent .
rtifitual Inteligent is e of e est ay , we an switch drivers to these vehice .
Ty will only follow the odes and wo n't be out of time d there wuld ot be n arguments .
In conclusi we have a lot of things ho o mprove .
We ca aso hel by paying or tickets , es this is impl but these companies nd money to improve thir businness .
Help thme and ejoy your travelling .
A hectic day .
It was ainin at and og wn h ealized tat he ha lost on of t most imortan things in her life .
Can you iagine what it was ?
In fct , probably it as n't a ignificant thig o mst peope but it wa it f e .
It was a rig whih was gvn wy by er moer .
Probably hat day s the worst dy in hr lfe , besdes he has't got married , e ster had ded in a ca accidet , It had been a terrified aciden , he ster was driving rom Ciudadel and she crhed no a te .
She wa outside te church he a fien of e clled to tel th w about h accident .
If I hd known that there wee ull of probls I 'd hav oe on ravel instead to e married .
Hlo I 'm Mathiu Sanabri and I 'm here to de d explain everything aout the se of my sextape , I went to a prty ith my football tea - mates and we were having a whal of time tn some girls arrived and I started to talk wth one of hm , I like her and she likes me so we ent to my room to have privacy an I do n't ko h but ome gys g into my room n started to record my wh th girl and I di n't noted the many days after I received a al from a g ta tell me hat he hav a ey explicit video of me dong thin with a girl and that if I do n't ve hi sme mney he wil put that veo on the Internet .
I think that he makes a wild goose chase he just bitn f mo th he an chew because he ds n't know me and I 'm going to mak him pay o wat he had dn .
In other ways I 'll talk aout Benzema , he is my friend f many yars g but I 'm n sure if he is with me or wth the others gy so I want to listen to their esion of te tor so he is ere to tk about that .
I 'm Near Benzema and I 'm blame for Matieu 's extape .
On of my best friends cled me tw weks ago .
He said to me he needed moey .
I had n't go enough money so I told him .
I 'm gutted because he is my childhood rind .
He talked about a pan about Sanabia .

He mae a video his friend d Mathieu .
He ske to me how mu oney shoud I waned from Mtieu?Ten I asked him h much do y need?He sai about one hndrd housnd euros a after hat I sai " ou can get it".it hidsight , I was wrong because it was llgal .

They polluting ore than fatoy does , by usin astic material , disposing wases in pubic places d ve som people nd to split and use ublc place as their ilet .
Althoug ma factories and people is ollutin th environment draically ut some peopl and orgniation is rotecting the envionment but mos often hese pele are discriinatd fo society .

Ms people like to drive cars instead of usig pblic transortaion .
In my count people go to work by ow ars .
Students go to school or university by ar as well .
As a rsult of horrible trafic jams ok place .
The government d to srt a ajor pulic transportation projects in orde to slve the problem .
Underground metro in Ridh is n of those projects .
Lon distance beween cies kes it difficult to use cars .
Airplanes are the best way to travel through log distances .
It 's fast , esy , comfortable a se way .
ues a much more conveniet for driving kid to shols .
transpot workers by publ transportation or by buses is me convenient for i companies .
Pblc tranpor is a mus and crs wil never replace it .
Pblc transport or travelling by car ?
I think ravelling by ca is a very comfortable ay .
Yout do n't av to think about us timetables n gas .
u only cn go to your car , sit in and rive away .
Al what y need is a driving lienc , a car an a little bt luck tt ere is no traffic .
If you go wth a train , you ee a ticket , tt 's ot very cheap !
ou must know the timetables a at which gate the trai will leave .
o ave to be fast , if yo want a ea to it , sometmes t trains a fl of people and you he to stnd the whole way !
I thnk it 's right , th travelling by r will be mo popular .
You dve the y you want .
Y can tp wherever you nt and there are a lot of oter poits to travell with the cr .

The two mp depict the ma chnges which take plc in Shipsmouth between h year 95 and 2010 .
Overall , it can be see that the city has bcame mr modern , with more transport and entertainmnt faciltes .
n striking change is that a w sttion as been bult , to connect the noh of the ty with the city cente n h road has bn pedestrianzed .
In 1995 , there were geen areas , oweer the were cut down and an airpot and an aprtent bloc were buil in those aeas .
Anther iteresting redevelopment is tht factoy as knoced down to ak way for a shopping centre , and in e ae w a for Chrc wic wa uled down to take plce o a ub .
The urba areas wr demolished , to mae a or skyscrapers .
A fil noabl change is that football stadium s eecte in t south of he ity in 2010 .
I lke playing enns .
I enjoy his ort because of is highly aerobic exercses .
Playr is required to run a oer th fed to cae te ball n to return it to the opponent .
To i e game , a ood strategy should be also applied .
One mt ecognize the fid n the strengths , as well as the weaknesses , of his opponent to make a point .
Thus it is a gme wih a ombiation of brain and physical skis .
For peoe starting to do this sport , one can try to train indiviually .
A wall in a tennis fild a be a gd start to learn ho to i a bl .
It ill be better of course to in a club or to gt a rainer to guide .
Informtion bou e asic theory and tchniue on tennis cn be gathee in nteret / books .
One should mk e efot to practise regularly to ak se a continual progress .
Learning to do juggling wi ao be bnficial .
Many coaches advise their pupils to prctise it for a beter coordination of hand d eye .
u mos imortaly , one should enjoy all of ths with fun .
I exactly do n't understand wy people want to learn bot pivae life of politicians and film srs .
I have to say that everody has te right to ave a private life although hy are famous .
It means nobody should nterfre ith fmous people 's ive .
Unfortunately , a lo of people a interested in ohers .
Famos peopl lo hav got nees .
Megastars can run into bushy probems .
hse happenings ae not strane .
ecaue all e people have got pedicamnts .
B pulic ant to see famous liticians and sas in evey situaion .
For eample ey want to see well - own pepe with he boyfriend / hi girlfriend or want to e them in casal attire or wa to s famous women witout ae - up .
On te other had , shuld be considered his opinion : So of bi names a imrtant fo somee who as them like an idal .
Soiety thnk ha ty haven't gt weakes d lack of ability .
And media apear on the sen .
Medi ma use of th interes and hans to is coin much money .
On the scene of TV , dia closes their defects or removes .
And all h time follow famous eple and their failies .
Privacy invasion seems to be an absolute right of media .
Howeer , being ab to protect against an invasion of privy is a fundamental human right of stars .
T government should give to superstar e right to protection of personal relationships d activitis .
Utimately , crowd - plasng pople alo have t any civi ight just like everyone lse .
Nwadays , mny eople refr owin a r ore than using pubi ansport .
It is more convenient as you can travel straightly to the place you wa to go .
ome ma say ht we do no ned public tranport anmoe in h future .
wever , I think public tansport should be kept as it sll hav thi vles .
First of l , pulic transport provide the experience of e journey .
Public transport is ot ny bus , but also plane n ferry .
They give y th experience of flying in h y or floating on the e .
That is t experience can not given by ca .
Y ca nt know it if yu nly tral by car .
So I think Publc tranport soul rema .
Last but t ast , public transport cn hae th cost of raveing .
Public tranprt is for many people to go to the sae place .
More money can be saved as the cost can be sare with the pepl who are oin to he sae place .
ird , public transport is god r the environent .
The plltion of may car is so uch .
The i pollution make e climate chane .
To sum up , ulic transpt stil have their own values .
he President of te United Sate of Amrica Mackinley says hat , regardng Cua , he ll t meddle unl December .
The newspaper " Times " publishe an intecepted ltter witten by th Spanish Amassado upu de Lowe ht wll mke him esign due to what he wrote about t UA .
ex to the blow - up of the North American steame Maine , the Spanish commisio created to investiate ti exlosion sures that it cod n't be one from the outse , but from te isid .
On t ter ad , the USA comission rngs teir reuts to the Parliamen wthout previousl noif thir results to ain and wh th opposie conclusion of the pnish commission .
Howev , the Spanish government oes not gree with e USA 's conclusions d they rquest North Americans to solve his disagreeent it an iternational abitrag .
Later , the A governmen affirms th do not wat to conquer Cua , but they eman Spin to sign an amistice with Cuns .
Mackinley ask for the arbitratin of he Pope Le√≥n X in the oflict a Spain eclims North Ameicans to t out of Cuban behes in order to show ther desre to pt an e to the conflict .
e Pope reqets he Spanish army to ase imedately he hostities in Cuba .
Later , e United Staes Hose of Representatives aproves a eolution to iitary interene in Cb if necessry .
The Snish Ministr of State publishes a Memorandum relain al th events and conficts made by the USA to Cuba unl the ublishing da .
In this Memorandum , e in evens narrted are e flibustey crimes originated in New Yok and h cane of atttude towads Cuba of the USA after the election of the presidn Macknley .
Als , ti Memorandu specifes th oigin of h conflict , whih resides in th letter wrtten by Lowe and the blo - up of h stemer Maine , he lttr eng remarked concernig the A rejected the panish proposition to crr out the arbitrage ogether .
h 21st of prl EEUU denies he pansh overeignty over Cuba , the 2r of April Spi sends the Memorandum to several nations and the 25h USA declares th w to Spain .

My huband is so annoying , sometims he kep takng and talking without any oal , he dop hi rty sock and clothes al over e use n lways shouting for unh , he sleeps in the middle of good moves and importat sbjets d snres while sleeping .. all he wats to do is t at ad leep

here are widely different iews on the public transport future .
Despt some people would uggest that uch ervie ha no uture becase peope r more rely on car as it is convenient , it is my prsonal blif that publi transpor shold contiue an has its uture .
Two of the principle reasos fr his ae as folos .
Firstly , the socity toay are more concerned about environmentaly friendly .
This is a worth seeing be concerned becase air pollution h negatve impact on our ealh and he ecosystms .
e more cars on te ra , the more green house gse produced .
Therefore , publc transport play an important role to itigate glal wrmng .
For example , if a bus can carry 100 passener , at least 25 cr can be reduced on ad , soved the problem of trafi jam .
In addition , scietist and engiers are working hard to invent nd improve the vehicles , so ty become le harmful to the nvironmnt .
The second argmnt is mor reatd to everyone and has gra influence .
Fr thse wh do nt drive , pubic transport is exremely important .
There are thousands of studnts travel ih public transport to school everyday because they ca o rive a heir parents do ot ae tme to drive them .
Moreover , insurance , petrol , rpair fees e ey expensv .
t everyone a affrd it .
On the other hand , pubic trnsport is good value of mone .
In conclusion , I belive that public transpot should have ftue .
Professioals are cntiuing to develop a better vehicle to make it eco - friendly , and there ar still any peple rely on public trasort .
Everyone deserves to have a rivae li , ee celbrities and trs , who is a life and soul of th arty during teir working hours .
We al eed a helter , hre we n hide from daily difficulties .
Th is the only way to maintan mental hlth and not to fall into dression .
We a say fo ue hat stars d ceebrities ar als people .
It means tha in everyday lf ty are faced ith the same problems as we do .
What is re , celebities as rdinry ople need om tme to rest and soe ime to buid ee relationship ith ohers .
As ordinar peope he need soone to tak ae of them , someone to share their feelings wit .
It des not matter what amount of mney is in tir accounts .
They are not ble to buy real relationships such as friendhip and love .
Te can gin fae nd admiration thank to their skil b their stae personality is ore ik a powerful eation .
Sometimes in everyday lfe thy ar not ev ineresting in terms of character and apeaance .
We l go through hardshis ad failus .
But this should not reach a level tht it lets us fall into mental disorders .
That is h a private lie is so important , especially for stars assessd l he tie by socity .

Michael went to a rip to Poland by hself .

He wet in nd oun an od man standing there .

He led me to a room which sid ' Happy ' at the door .
Whn Mchae steppd ito the oom , I fl something vry resh isde me .

I do n't know why people love spying famous people .
And agazines are full of those thgs .
Anoher useless thing are gossp .

I al think tt the llowing fmus pepe oetimes could be dangerou .
For example , hen fan flow te cb , se or he could be ut , because the trffic is really unpredicabl or when there is a hu mass of fa , they culd hurt each other .
My opinion is , that e famous peole deserve a uet im , he ey are it thei prners or wit famil , t also when te are jus going to t supermarket or gym .

Yeas ago , we used to e thrugh with ther peopl ining up or xting mesges by our mobie phone n as time goes by , owadays we as can counicate by scal networks such as twite , facebook , whatsapp ... Frs of l , we s te to catch up on new , social isues by twitter instead of newspapers , for instane , it 's uually to e pole havng breakfa in a caeeria redings news by i smrtphone , an image so far from yes back .
We ls ca have moe knowledge abou current isues by Facebok pages wich re ot considered apprpiate by oe TV progrmmes su as political discusions , strikes , econy ... As fa I concerne , noadas population know more about wa 's oing on in h orld than in previous years .
One example of this could be Nrt Corea or some Ab countris whee heir ovrnment n to he access Internet to ciizes , in other word , thy wt to mislead abou reality avoiding popultion culd clim bu this nets or up in arms ginst tei system .
On the other hn , we c e mr iformaton about ou kno and unknown peole h e our friends by faceok , uploading hotos at any im , tking a coffee , watching a fotbal match or pending summertime somewher .
So , this means we ae getting es intity and becoming more gossiping at te sm ie , as a consequence of sharin our livs on publi sites .

Tear sarted to fal fro his eyes .
ichael closed t door ad knew at that oent he a md a mistake .
In t presentday community shopping is ne of t most imprtan pat of life .
For some of us ade is a thn for a living , but otr pple treat shoppng like a ood thn to spen time and they ar enjoyig it very much .
o me , shoping is t enjoyable ad I am rying to avoid big hopping centres .
The vey fis raso for my disagreement is tat I do n hve enough money to prchae everything hich I would li to bu .
Things a geting oe a more expnsive and I am really disappoited when I must go out of he ho with nohig and furthermore it ives me a ig mont of sadnes .
The next tin bou unpeasant shoing are enormous lns .
ong for a fw ood - stuff ways end it an hour in a line .
No matt in what te ou come to shop , yu wi wait .
T la , bu n last reaso again ejoyble shopping is tht I have to travel a lot to a store in which I can buy eeryhing I want .
Of course I migt go to a fe ifferent shops , but without driving licee travelling is tough tk .
arring many heav bags is not my favourite id of spendig my spe - tm .
Tere are lots of good placs to visit in azil .
Beautiful n mportnt plaes for the istory of this amazing tropical countr .
Among all of th , o of t placs u must visit in Bril is the mazo heater , locted in Manaus , the town of Aazon Stat , in the north of t country .
Te buildng is important because it w buil in th las century during the rubber age , hen th cit ws on of te os richest city in t world .
Architects , builders , piners a scuptor re brouh frm Europe by ship as well as all h materi construction hat were necesry for its bulding .
It is a sophisticated contrution , full of deail , everyere around te thate , from e flo to h ceilng , everything crefully fashioned accordng to that erod .
Even if it has mre then 00 eas since it was built , al t original fashion re til there , itact , with ll the luxury ready or everone 's visit .
The ace set out important oncerts , presentations and internaiona fstival until nowaays .
T hater is amous not just bcase of its ae , but so becaus it was built in th middle of te jungle .
During the rubb age here was no urn life around h uld , which is completel different fr toay of course since there is a restored quare and a chrc in fron of t theate , that have the sme ge of the heatr and is surrounded by art galleries , pub , ffies , houses , restaurants , where oups of riends , turiss and famles are usd to go to appreciate te breeze in the d of a wr ay d during t night .
It really worh visiting mazo Theater in Mnas , tkng pictures a havng good stories to tell in your life .
Hae ou ever heard bout it ?
If o iv in a sall vllge , you ma know he port I do .
st of l Girls ay it in my vllge .
In big citie tere 's a similar Sport caled Basktball and this one is more for Boys .
Every moday we met us in t sportshall of Mandach .
Before th ssons egn , we talk abt the news in the village and do some exrcise to get warm .
After our Trainer io hows us a lot tpps an triks .
The reason I like thi Spot is ore or less sime .
I can lay it with gd friends , it 's a unny Sport , but it 's also hadly n o can g to your Limit .
In winter we have some aes every two weeks , where ur frien are istors .
In e last season we reached h second place .
If yo want to now more about ths Sport , do n't hesitate to watch a game of us .
You cn ind mr informaions as in the Inrnet .
To sum up I ho to se you on by a game .
In te reaing passage , t writer provdes several theories about the pupoe of th carved sne lls .
However , the ecturr points out th problems in l hs assertions .
Firstl , the uhor holds tht h stne balls were possibly used in hunting or fighing .
In contras , h professor rgues tat they wre impoibly weapons bcause he show no damage .
If they wr used as weapons , they should be broen up or divided into pieces .
Scondy , the writer claims ha the stone bals migh be us as stanrd weights to measure .
Neverthless , the ectuer contends tat e thory is indefesile .
The main reason is tht the rave one bal ar different typs of stones .
It is bcause different ones have iffeent densitie ha the wghts ar different thog thy are unfor in te sae size .
Last bu not lst importantly , th author asserts tha the stone balls might serv a ocia prpos .
The professor , owver , does n't think so because te the designs of the stone alls ae o sipe to show the important social status .
Moreoe , in general , artifac of scial symbol is buried wi its owner after he or e died .
However , the craved stone ball wer no fund er ny gaves .
To sum up , th professor otaly dsagree it e statent in te reading passage .
Life is changing evry day and in the nxt fifty years a o of things wll happen .
Science is developing very quckly an nowadays scientists are discovern ew things .
In the future some dangerous dieass such as ncer or As ill be eated , and there will be no worrie about the .
I hnk peol will not go out of their homes to buy goods an fod or cloths , because professioal robots will be invned ad the will do anyting th ou want , ad they wil oy you ordrs .
Hwver , his c cause a probl f human and some peoe ill ce to the tret of compulsry redunancis .
I woud say that sm problems will happen and people will ose ther os .
I assume tat another problem wl be rbots , because ttle by little te will capture the world d they will become human 's eem , and tht would be one of possibilities in th futr .
In conclusion , I would say that devloping is nt ery od for hua , and little by little th world will be demolishd by human eror .
I op the world wil nt bein detryed by human , but in the end everon knws that t enie of the worl will be rind n nobody wil be alive .

In day 's orld pole ue public transport in every aspect of travelling .
Nevertheless , travelling by ar can be ping a real treath to public tanport because it is much more comfortable .
Firstly , hing a car makes travellig uh easier .
Pole n go whrevr the want and whenever the want withou thinking of buig a ticket or getting to a station on time to atch a bs or a train .
Car gives comort because you a personalise yor space an your ride .
ll t same a is also necessity tda , because very often that is the onl mes to get to were yu need to .
However , public transport is not threatened by cr .
First of al , too many cars make twns crowded and reae traic ja , whih is countepoductive .
Secndly , o ar is making as muh pollution as oe us hich transports ma more people .
In my opinion , pblic trnsprt is secured in the fure .
It will ven get more popular becaus it will be faster , moder , d cheaper tha a travellg by car .
It was e ors night we had evr h .
We had never gone to Michael 's houe before .
We were thinking tha meeting there we will hve a funy night in fieds , but we ee ver wong .
When we arrive we saw an old house whr Michael lved .
He was waiting for us outide .
At first , we dd n't hin that soethng a a ging to hapen .
When we o nside his hos , we s a lot of old pic on his wall , it was like a horror vie !
Michael looked vy nervous to .
After a whle , whe we were plain one of s Computer ae , we heard a scream coming from hi garden .
There were w odis in that place .
Th were Michael 's parents , i father s dead , but hs mum no .
Then , Michael tried to hide their bodes in a oom , witou knowing that i um was ali .
Wh we aw tht we escaped as fast as we could , ad we saw as i mum wakin to find Micael , lie a zombie .
In the end , We hed Michl 's screa .
We ever e him gain , I hik that wen Mical closd the dor an kn at th moment he hd made a mistake .
The best hriller I have ever ad
It w lng tme ago when I have read tis book but it was so good and exciting th it 's sll in my mind .
That 's a oel writte by Sidney Sheldon called ' ' If tomorrow cmes '' .
There is al a fim baed on the book .
It talks about an ordinary young won o ha everything s needs in lfe .
ftr s finds o th her mother has commited a suicide bcase of ome ind of raud she decies to revnge e but she gets into a prison .
Aer she coms out e deide to make anothe revege eause of h ame easn .
This book is ry exiting because there is a lot of things that ae happening and it 's nt monotonous at all .
It has a o of intrigus nd a t of to thik abot what 's going to apen next .
I would recommed this ook to he peole of l ages becus it s something for vryone .
It is serious enough for the oler oes and it a a romantic side for th youger ones .
It is a really good ok that should n't b msse .

Everything happened that summer I pnt in Egyp .
My mother ad fund a new j in some ancient ruis , right in the middle of h esrt . I should ention hat she wa an impotant archaeologist , known a ov the word , and she d to travel to every corer on Earth .
I usd to end my whl holidays at my grandparents ' coutry hous , surounde by geen fields , orst and rivers , but when I turned eighteen my mother thought I was old eough to take a pane on my w d stay ih er r a mont .
I d n't xpect to find nything es ha sand , ht an tourits on my y aross he eser , ve though I was leading myef to a patch of water among lgues of wasteland , the oasis of aiyum .

When I anaged to reah te ousde I d a taxi waiin r me , proably sent by my mother , so at eat I di n't ave to look or aoter one in he stifling heat of te cit .
On he othe ad , the tai did n't even ve air coditioing , so I sen e two hous of t journey trying to n melf with a magzie I borrowed from the driver .
I rached the hotel well in e afternoon , neetheless , he ai was still oppresive and ot lie at midday .
Ev hogh I had to ber the clmte , I s hap ith eig able to e my mothr moe often tan I ud to in as summers .
I had n't met hr sne the begining of st Februry , n tt w five months before then .
Itrouction
Te aim of ti report is to gv some tips fo tourist wh come to e cy . I will roide y wih soe iece of adice about shpping clthes in the cty as long as some recommendations .
Fashion and luxur
In t ciy ere are many fashon shops hre you an ge e most trny clothes . Y ust be aware tha maybe you will sped mor ney than expected , bu if you a a shopaholic , it ill woth it .
NAY 'S s party dresses and wonrful shos that you can u on pecial occasns .

Recommendations
If y are a fasion lover you should vsit Linda and Nany 's .
I recmmed you having a lo nside just in case .
By contast If y a mre likey to save money , the bst option in e treet mare .
I suggest a qui sit to every shop an make comparations in price and quality
A group of young popl from abroad will be visiin my oe town for three monts .
This is a sho report whi will inclue my recommendation about he mos interesting places in my to for hem to eoy .
I hve hosn o most popular plces to av a good im in my ow .
The first pla woud be " uture Cenre " a t second one " Spts Centre " .
In the " Cuture Centre " your young visitors will be able to oin dai cultural activities , suh as theater , cinema nd drawing classes , whereas in the " Sports Cetre " hy will have an opportunity to join may sports activities , ch as bowling , swimming , athleics and karate claes .
Additionally , since the young people are going to sa in my town o a e monhs , I suggest ht they should subcribe to a Polish language course .
It is vey helpful to be communicative in Polish language at least on a basic vel .
he course oul be tre times a week ny , and fuly pa by he olish government .
T course will give yur oun visitors not on a o of fun but al a general knowedge out Polish cultur d atin habits as wl .
In shr , a trip to Poland will be an unforgettable experience or you stdnts .
Howver , they shold be aware of hih costs of ling in my tn .
When I think in fo t first thoug it cmes to my mind is ham , it bring back memories of h Critmas 012 .
I hve fon memois of thoe Crismas ecuse of the ham ad my niece .
In recent yes , I ha been buying he ha in a shop in C√°ceres wich is gely popular a I really enjoy seeig ht my amily is delighte , but overll I enjy eeng my niece , ho is still a chid , ating ham .
vey yer , in my house , we play the same role : my othr a my sister prepare different plate f Chrismas dnnr , and I am highly prbably he respnsile fr carrying hose plates from th kitchen to the ding room , beause e rest of th faml is lot in ter cnverations tryig to save the word .
It w hle I was cmig in and out from e kithe I found my nece tanding on a sde of the table eating ham .
I do n't knw o she took te ple fro the centre of t tale and put it in frnt of her , u she had started to t it , without sking anyone .
It wa an unforgettable momen , I was looking at h slightly exted becse she was eating alon thout help n fast , hic s n still is nusual coming fro h .
If there er mre buses or tans at any ime ( ao in the night ) , it could be onvenient uig them n letting the car in e garage .
nfortnately it 's not posble beaue of the costs that h Economic System oul be complle to support .
So people oftn prefer uing the c n payn for oil instead of h b ticket t having more advantages : not to be contricted to wait for the buse and not to have to take a ai in he ight when ey come bk rm the disco , o emple ..
Recently , in man tons , there is also a new systm r ming arnd the city .
It 's called " City ar " or " Cr Sharing " and it consists in sharing a car , using it fr ur movements ad then leing it in vey part of t cty in h dedicated arking .
It 's a cheap service an it 's very appreciated frm people who eds ar not every y bu only for a little tim .
So I thin tat in a sht time , cars wil take t place of e public tansprt .
h Internship , a flm of Shawn evy with On Wilson d Vinc Vghn .
In his film there are two n ouner men who have lost heir work .
Ty sl clocks , u at a certain time ther factory ha osed .

I think ht there r different types of amous people .
Th mo re famous because he epse their privae life nd all their interet are to making money .
T rt of celebrities r artsts or gd wokers .
ey do not think in oney or ae , simply they enjoy working .
On the n nd , I aree it h statement becaus everyone ha the right to maintain a private lf .
It h to be uncomfortable to go u of your ouse ad find some reporters or paprazi waiting f you to asking or to takig photos .
If something changes in your lfe wil be a notice in television , a eope will invent mours aou you .
ot nw if people take iteret in yo becaus they re real fans or is a rson who ants to tke adantag of you .
On the other hand , I disgre wih he statement beuse if they re pubc people , ans will intret in te .
Tee ae cebrities hat el the life in television and hn do o wan to journalists hse them .
There are other famous people who not appear in televiion n hy are cased by reporters .
Tis is the result ht something new a ocurred a the ant to collect informatio .
It is mpossile to te a private lie if you are a elebrity , ecause pele who lo u want to know aou your privacy .
To suarize , if u exps yorsel to television u will not have a prvae life .
Te be way to keep it is n be a aous pson .
To whom it my concern ,
I woul like to apply for te job of instructor in the USA Summer Camp as advertisd in the newspaper .
Ls witr I h been working as a cah in my basketball team wih kids but ten yers od .

Moreover I am very active n ardworkig as yo request .
In dition I am ve funny a alays I am joking .
It is not a prolem for me to wrk in t kitchens becaus I cook on my hou ad I tink I do vry we .
I thik this job is perfect or me because I love children ad sport .

It is argued that famous people , sch as politicians and ilm sars , dserve to ave a private life without journalists following em l the ime .
On my opnin sometimes trs ' behaviou is very suprising .
To illstrte my pint of vw I at to give some examle .
On the nd amus eole intend to protect eir private live , but on the othr hand they want to be olloed by paparazzi .
First of ll being on h overs of rags hl them ae thir mo attractive for diecors .
The other rason is that aors wat to be reognisable , beaue opuarity giv possibility to earn mre money .
Hollywood fees depend not onl on sills but fst of all on am of this erso .
Fm stars have very duties for example going to t partie organized by othe people fro show bussness .

I enjoyed t past summer holia , it is entertaining d I usually travel arond Hg Kong wth my family during weekends .
I have been to several places duing the holiday , icludng arport , Mui Wo , West Kwloo Cultual Distit , e .
Te summer hliday w quite ng , nerly two months .
I usually wake up at aoun nie O Clock in he mrnin and spen the day by readng newspaper , bks , nd alo digitalize soe ido tape .
I enjoy reading newpapes so I ca get pdate on the latest development of incidents and nes .
Furthermore , it cn also improve my laguage ills .
I usually watch television programs fom Disvery Netwo at night .
Besides , I fnd tose talking aout building asive structures d scienc interesting and I learnt so knowlge from those programs .
To e prepared to the thing to be taught in grade 9 , I also flipped through some textbook , inclding Itegrated Science , Georahy , tc .
And I id the knowledge to be aght in so subjects interesting , while some are n't .
As I am a member of the Robotics Tam , I nt to school for 3 as durig th summe holiday to prepare for a compeiion on ourt of Ocober .
Dspie h hard work , I enjoyed te roces of prepring the opetition a ot .
Nowdas the level of or le has become highe .
We are lookg for beter conditions everywhere .
So a pulic ransport is no exception .
Most people prefer sig tir private r insed of a public transport .
Basicall , there are a ot of drawbacs using this kind of transport .
First of all is a trafic jam , if u stick in a traffic jam in a ig bus y wll waste uch tim then u expected on the road . Bisedes a public transpr are ovrloaded at rush hus .Another downside is that mot of bses a ld and dirty .
That 's why people chos travellin by car ecaus it ' is or convenient nd fast .

Pulic transport is ot as valorated as it shold be atough a lot of people es it evr day .
Here are some of my rason o hinkin that public trasprt is important .
Firstly , it is very good r th nvironment ecause it reuces a lot of cabn dioxide gses which if everybody took the ar istead of aing public transport would polue e atmosphere
Secondly , ravellig in public transport makes much easier to tavel at ush hou or on those moments in hich u should t take the c
Finally , it is a od way of travelling becus it is safer than travelling in a c or in a motobike a alo in te a that you e mc reaxd than in a r and it ave tim to .
To conclude public transport is good fr the envionmnt , it akes much easier n ceapr to travel , nd it , in some way , saes lives .
For thos reasons and some oters I think tht public transport must be here for many yars .
Hllo .
I am goin to tlk about my country .
I live in the capial of Sweden , Stockholm .
A big city wt mor than one ilion people .
I lv in a little part of stockholm called andery .
Dandry is n't inse the ity .
It 's ome kilometrs otside of it .
Becase Danderyd is n't in the city it 's very much ture an ice people .
So Sweden is located in t north part of Europe .
Between Norway and Finland .
It 's a bg country and doe n't have man inhibitants .
Around 9 - 10 milon people .
It 's one of the iggest countries in Europe if yo think abut e area weden have .
Anyway , abt n thousand years ago Sweden , enmak , Finland d Norway was Vikings .
The Vikings where le piraes that lived in the countries I ws talking abot one thousa years ao .
hey ailed to rance and England to puder .
B they also where the ons that first discovered Greenland , North merica and Asia .
h Vikings hee faed fro os people in Europe but they whr so merchants and exlorrs .
The mo people in Swee are christins .
But bease Sweden accept so my people to flee to Swedn fom he war in th northern parts of Africa an the southwest pts of Asia .
Th naure in Sween can be er od , especilly in h northern art of Sden .
If you ae at h most northern pa of Sweden it 's always day in the summer and always night in the wnter .
Also when it 's inter you n see something called e nrthrn lit .
It 's a stange light in the sy in diffren colors that is ver beautiful .
Some st trav to Seden just to see it .
In Sden we he vey goo education .
Mos peop go to highschool and unversity .
There are houg a problem wih jobs .
It 's hd for yong pepe to nd jobs in Swde .
In Sweden we r ey prod of a fre dwnload able rogra where you n liten to almost al e music in the wold .
It 's calld Spotify ad have grown super big .
Thre is als another free program that is called Skype whre u cn talk to eacother and text eachther totay free !
Th gaming comunity in e world is growing fa ad most of te bo that hav a computer play gmes .
In eden gaing is reall bg and here is ao o ga maker that have md a game called BF or Batle Fil .
It have ben a great succes nd is ne of the best gas in t wol .
We in Sweden a al vry pod of our bst foobal player , Zlaan .
He 's one of the est football players in he world and is relly poplr ot in Sweden and in oher countries , espeially in Eurpe .
en thgh we hae a l to be proud of we need to ak a lot of things btter .
In Sweden we have a lot of different peple from different kultures .
The poblem is that there r a lot of swesh people that are razsts .
Not the majorty of core b there are any razists .
Ta can be reay painull for those wo is n't fo Swede from th beginnng .
Or fo those h does n't av swedish culture .
so as I said befre we ned more job .
My hom couty is Hog Kong , whic is a frer Bitish olony .
Ater the andver in 1997 , it becomes a pecial adminisraive regn of hia .
The location of Ho Kong is in Asia , and ts locatn seems to be a bridge etween China and worldwide .
Since it is loted in a secific are between China a the western , both cultures are also bing popula in there .
Dsite the nd in Hong Kong is st 1,100 sq.km , 7.2 millios citizns ae lvin in thee .
rom 1980 's , it is developed as an intenational nancial centre and so may glbal investors hav et up their heaqarters in there .
Compare with other develoed countries , Hong Kg 's economy is stable and competing wth Singapoe to be the rime leader of the Asia .
For languages , Chine and Englsh are e min languages wic sin in Hog Kog .
For he eduaton , every deveoped contry is cncerning with the isue .
ong Kong gornment has invested ls of cpital to develop a better education ysem for uilding a knowledge - based society and the bett future .
It is providing 12-yer free education to ever chld nd th must be educated fo at est 9 yrs .
As mentioned , Hn Kong is a special administrative region of China , those ystems a aw are different from Mainland Chia .
Residents in on ng are enjying hghy - freedom in relign , speech , oganizational , activities , oin abroad during the life .
Oing to those separatd characteristics , actually , Hong Kn can be described as a olouful and brilliant city .
Ging places is of paramount importance for pople , n going quickly vn more ; tha 's why I thnk pubc transpot is not the most efficiet way to go plac .
h e of public tanspor tae more ti than uig th a , whch can be considered as a wae of tie .
ou ae dependent on schedules when o s public mea of transprt , tat is to ay you cn not begin yu journey whn you want .
You must wait for the right time of departure d you mst be at e eparure point at due im , which impes gttig to that specific lac by any oter mens of ransport .
All thi makes usi he car uch conveient due to h fact hat not ony do yu leave whn you ant , u al sraight away ro th ry do of yor on hose .
When yo go by car yo ma control or timing , stop at wl an if you go with someone el , it may be cheaper : provied the os of e ourney wil be te sme , no matter w many passengers ou ak with yu ; while on pblic transport o hould pa a tick for every single rider .
Anyway , to tell u the ruh I 'd rather take a trin , f istance , it ans travelling in a relaxing way , not unning risks of accidents , haing the chanc to red or play " travlling " chess , meeting ew people , as in a tge coach but moving ster

fer a complex and difficult journey , Mohamed managd to rch the Itaian cost in 2011.elpe by a Senegalese communit , he h eventually found a o as a fruit seer in a local market .
Despte his high qualified studis in ducation , Mohamed had to cary on a job in a comletely different fed .
he phenomenon of imigration of eple ro Afric to Europe seeking better opprtunties hs become cmmon in the last decades .
Hoever , nowadays even in e rich Western Europe , mny highly qualified uropean graduates stggle to in an emplyment .
hi h bcom a challenging sue that is leading mst of thm to art the same immigraion pattern follwd by Mohame towards oter Counries .
Unlike the os - War socity , where the Europea economy ws boming , ince more an 5 yeas , Europe is suffering from a profound economic crisis whos majo effect are brne by he ouths , incuing the highly qualified graduates .
Such a phenomenon is also worsene by the education urriculum adped in man schools , which has failed to adapt to the chaes brught in the societ by globalization .
Schools nd job markets e oftn separated like two different wrds .
Therefe , once graduated , qualified youths find temslves to face bh t eonomic crisis an a hostile job markt .
I believe that Governments from different Countie should ce together to nd apropriae measure to overcome the economic crisis and so the vious cicl that leads qlified pople to be excluded from th o markt ad , therefore , contribute to orsen the impact of he ecnomc criss .

Shopping is not alwys enoyable .
Is it true ? I gre wih is statement .
h ?
Becaus , wh we ecided to go for a shopping ad av an idea what we want to buy a it appeas that we ca n't find what we at , we e disappointed and frustrated .
Sometimes , shoping - particularly for wome - is h be way to ameiorate he mod .
Fr example wh tey find what he wa , or fnd something in a smler size , or jut nd a trfle and ar apy .
Unfortunately , shopping also c bri displeasure .
For example , when we staying at the queue , coming to the cash register d it appears that the price on he label is mo expensive .
As we now it , for women shopping is the est way to relax but or mn is just a ortue .
I thik that if her is no pubic transpot in the utue , the traffic ill be a totally ms !
Bcase everyboy drie ter rs and mtorcycle on rod ta th trfic jam wl not only be the serious poblem to the government ut also be th se prole to citizens .
Me vehile on rad that mean more c accidents happenin .
Therefore , t governmen ned to mak a oo traffic olicy to ensure citizen 's safety and welfare of av prvilee of diving on ro .
If ter is so mu vehice on rd , it may ause several problem .
ne is that people my tuk in th rafic jam dring the rush hor , the scond is he more vehicle on ad hat ean the mo xaust would be emitted into th a , the lt ad h most importnt is he gas a l would be deleed .
In a esut , I think if travelig nly by ca is not a wi choice fo ert although it is convenient .
But we need to hink tt there is a bette a to protc the rth and human 's environment ch as ridin icycl or waiti f environmental - frinly car being inented .
No future r public ransport ?
The lifstyle of the people has canged completely in h ast 20 yeas .
Cr e ore como on ciy rods .

Many peope ve to travel longer distances to work , a most oftn hir only wrkin too is the c own .
In addition most of the peole are no ue to walking on fo een in hor distances .
In b citis wre eople live a mre solate ife a lays in a urry .
Even though ter a re and ore rs on th rod , I do not think this endeny will completely reduce h dend for puli transpottion for h following resons :
Trafic jams cause many prbems in g ciie .
In those cities where the nmbe of te residents is ove a million , public transport sysem is widely used .
ne of t mt widely us is th suwa .
Sudnts often se puli transport eteen cies instead of cars .
hee are ma eole who hav experienced a carcrash , or ust simpy afraid of driving , so ey pefer to use public transport system .
Tho pele o ha mental or othr serious ilness es n't allowed or o ab to dive a car , for thm public transport system is ncessry .
Nt to mention that riving a car means you are responsile for yr passnges ' life a it is ss about convenience even if travelling by car means you do n't need to ajust to oer passengers .
I agree with that there is a ler dmnd for public tanspor in maller cities n wns , but it does n't ma it hs no ture .

MY FAVOURIE SOAP OPERA .
I really enjoy soap ope I have se a t of them , ut in my opino de bs one is an Engish one called fawlty Towers .
It ws witig by John Clees an Cni Both d it shows de dly ife in a fictious hotel .
There are four main characteres the owner 's hot a moody n an h bsy wie , and t workers a pleasant maid an a Spanish waer wh does n't spek nglish .
In every cater new clients go to this hotel d have a o of crzy , funy a sarcastic situations , btween orkrs , oers and customers .
Particlary we the owner gives ordrs at e waiter , this stuatons becme hilarious .
It s a shorter soap opea , oly en chapter , t at te ed it seems you now te for a log time .
I recommend it to enjoy .
Its shorters stories ave have a fun and relaxed tme .
As the technology develops rther rapid , it 's a world - wd phenomenon o or us to fi ha lrg - scale buildings and transort networks ae to be bil for h sa of han 's economy , wich meas ast ares of frmland , foest nd wetland r on e way of big ruin .
A large nmbr of prolem are coming up at resent .
Fitst of all , t environment that blogs to both n an wild ive is going to oe bance in he ecosystem .
It indicates that more kinds of speies are endagered or he a unabe to aapt themselves to he remaining lans .
hen comes the problem of human bings .
Vegetables nd other oo pantin on the farmla wi ecreae so much ta h needs of hun m t be mt one ay .
Moreover , wt e decresing numer of trees nd any ote plants , carbon dioxide can not be opd with by those natural macies , which ill lt h remainin ice in te world .
Thus , the sea lvel will go up to influnce the climate leing to warmer days in h whoe world .
As a as I 'm concerned , it 's ritical r governments to take msues to reduce e problems .
Firstly , relevant laws and principles should be pt up to forbid extravaet epanion in the natual ystem .
In addition , supervision of t rotectig tps ed to be undertanken by the government .
What 's more , h importance of he proecton of natur can be emphasized by educating citizn gradually , no matter in caps or in th public places .
Anyway , to k to potect our iving eniroment from being destroyed is to do it by we indivisuas step by step .

h doorbell rg .
Wn I opene he door magie my surprie !
In front of me sod a Hre risna !
I was ane in the oice , it was late ad I h a l of work to do and when I herd th sound of te doorbell I fet rally upset because I wa looking forwa to going oe .
Anyway , he m was wearing an ornge cotume , he a surprisingl al and lim and he was completel bald exet for a long blak ponytail oing o from the ead .
He seemed the most pacific man in the world , so I was n't aaid .
On th contrary , I flt rtty amused when he tarted dancing , rncing a singing an unkow song .
It as rlly hard nt to burst t laughing in his fa !
When he stope , he gave me a colored bracelet that it oul mke me happe .
I was so glad to hae h ths comic omen that I gave h a lttle offer ad I nvied him to come back again !
UNFOGETTALE FRIND
I met her in scond gad , we ee qeuin to go to css , th w the mmen I saw her .
And how oul I have knn that s woul hang my lie frver ?
Sh was different fo all the otr kids .
S s quiet , bt interesting at te same time .
We became friends whn we wee 8 years ol nd we visited each other all h time .
At at tie , I did n't have many frends , she helpd me to overcome my problems nd ust myself .
That is y he is so special to me .
We nev hd anying from eh other .
We are diferen , but I think hat tha is a curious thing aou friendship .
8 ears aer she has becme my best friend , my os sste , my omlement .
e s hard to find , but impossible to frge .
eer looked at his watch n knw tht he hd to do somthing immediatel .
He orgo he had a doctor 's apointment n he was running te .
He finishes gettng ready r hi appointment .
Onc on t ar , he strts to drie like a maniac .
How could he forgot he time of hs appointment ?
He still nees to find an AT to withdrawl some mny to p fr his appointment .
Once he fids oe he pls up th car d goe as fast as he can to get some oey .
He finally arrives .
She was waiting for i .
Hopefull o he nex time he wil s up a reminder to avd this aan .
On e ohe hand , publ transport is inconvenient .
It is crowded at rush hur .
Pickpockets can hae a field day with ll th commotion of ush hour .
Becaue public trnspot does o perae 24 hours a day , means people have to follow a shedue .
Furthrmore , tre re certain forms of tnsportation , such as trains , tat do not travel to he suburbs , so peopl iher have to ak lng istancs to reach the nearst stop or be ependent on o fo of ublic transort to catch another which an be a great source of tress if ter is ever a del .
When it omes to e ise if Pets c be like our family .
Som eople sggest hat we have to avoid treati them this way , while e oers maintain h oposite viw .
As r as I am cncerned , the ater ont of view carries more weight .
I am iclned to elieve tha pets n be teaed as a amly members because hy re loal , have sos as well as they a humn friends .
First of all , Ds and cats are a vey loyal creatures .
hee are ay ogs w ar loyal and trustorthy than ny people in the arh .
Pts can nt deceive or li .
Many dog o example help thei owners an protct them om many daners .
For illustration , My fend h a dg , one day when tey were in hs fr .
A sne tried to bit my frind bt his g at the ast moment saves him nd took tat snake wy .
That is why I lov ps .
He me an action whi many ter people could not .
For that reson I ppreciate my pts as if they re oe of my friends .
Secodly , reason for my propensity of treatin pets as a family member , is that he ave souls .
they feel as if thy are uans .
They fel our love toards them and hey c exchange this loe with us .
Wile they n n express tir emotions in ur ordnary ways .
veyone h to treat hem in a kind wa .
Tey will ner try to hurt any human being so why peope try to ut em .
Domest anials ae a very esitive creatures that we hae to treat them as our bbies .
Another pon that is wort mentioning is ha pt can be considered as human fiends .
We can talk , al and hangout wih them .
Many ople can talk wit her pet as if they undersan them .
On ca alk with hi dog , cat or any other kind of ps as they r ter psychiatrist .
Thy discuss wi tm any life even .
r example , I have an old neighbor who ies alone wt his cat .
He tas wt her d plays wi her .
When I se m n ak im how do you do .
He always told me ht we are fie referring to h and i cat .
Afer seeing how this old n les alone ith his cat ihout suffering from oneliness .
I do not in or fear living lone anymor as I hav my rind whih is my cat .
To um up , as a person rechs adulthood , he nee to decie weather to be a hmn or not .
He has to choose between treating his pet as a famiy membe or t .
I would aru that treaing o pes as or friends is an ndicaton of humanty .
Since hy a creatures ie us have souls and feelis .
he can take car of us ad love us in a very interetin wa .
Tht is why I considr my cat my aitful fend .
Hll Pal ,
It 's sc a og time since we talked st tme .
It was in Martin 's party where here was amazin music n ot of people .
Do u remember ?
I ven't hrd anything abut yu since then .
What have you be up to ? I ' ve jut stared a new j in an important French busines .
I 'm delihted although h weather is awful .
I think t rain wil to when ig f .
The iy wre I live is ice with garden and ht 's oe , a hug lake .
I us to go runnig thre .
I wol like to see yu soon .
Are y tll in Bacelona ? We cn me up next month becse I will have holiday .
Give my regards to your family .

My peect otel wol be near to the each , in te Medierranean oast , because in this re thre are many ourits .
The hotel old be luxoriu but everybody could cme because the prices wod be o , so e hotl would be alwys full , I think that may people nt to go to a luxoius hotl but they ca n't .
h hotel woul ae many services and facilities lie a oo reception , spa , wi conection n ay TV in e rooms , a great hf who d the dishes of the mediterranean cuisine , a wiming poo , a r in the beach a a ot for tris around the medierraean sa .
I wud like to her te point of vieuw of touist to improe th hoel .
Ths is the hoel of my dreas , but the mot important is tat the people wr happy in their acommodation , if hy e hpp ty wil return et er .
One day a frind of mine w ging to an amauer thatre to e a musical and asked me if I wou fancy joining her ; I am not fnd of musicals , vn though I went .
The peformance trned ut to be pleasing , wi a lot of wtty jok .
he acti wa surprisingly motional , ut a bt woden .
After the hw I s introdused to one of the actors , who was my friend 's cousin .
I wandered if he was plannng to eter an drama school .
His nwer astonished me ; he did not want to ecoe a professional actor .
Moreover , he foud being faos extremely rritatig .
I , like most people , tok for grated tht clebritis not ny ek fame , ut aso benefit from it .
The experience gracious living , enjoy glity arties a admire their photos in glossy magazines .
Anyway , it is only one side - What do we know aot e flisid of ame ?
Do we often thik what it meas to live une constat pblic scrutn ?
Ever misake the famo ae is charged against them .
They can do nothing that coul n't be ossipped about .
They are en not llowd to hae anything fr their own .
Paparazzoes ak public teir day - to - day routine , hobbes ad passos .
When it trns ou ha all wh we go use to dolise ae just people wt their shortcomings , we beome disappointed .
We watch merclessl how celebrities topple frm tei thones an ve fin plesure in that .
People , it ds n't atte if they are fmos or not , e just eople .
Nobody is perfect .
h do n't we want to gie peple entertaning us a chance to be themlves ad to have a really privat lfe ?

Subet : pnion on what young poee are interested
Dt : 27.10.2015
re is the report ou asked for abt my opinion ,
what oug pope e intereste in oay .
First of all , our generatn youth people are more
open - minde and toreant in my opiion .
usi sle an
clothes earing changes very qukly .
Television series
or movie do not really change , young people atch old
hws nd new one by tns , so I can o say wat TV
programmes youg people lk to watch .
ow , young eople like dfferent ind of music , I think
pop an disco music is something all you people like .
Because this kind of usc conncts them on arty .
It soothes them , calms te , aggavtes them , excts tem .
Tha is hy music is ery iport thing abou this festival .
Coths them is rder ike I said before , becus fashion
changes swiftly .
Clothes need to be pn nd free , simple ough .
We all wnt to feel good at we wear , I recomed hipi syl
clothes , not too hipi , u somting comforabe .
Of course
it depends wat seson ou ding the fstival .
Wen autumn , winter
te tn I sgges ome oth stle , it s to be comfotable u
fashion enough .
Mybe clorfu nd ol blankets hen someone ts
cod .
All in a , I think those ti help y ad I hope yo wll
ive tos peoe oe good internatinal fesial .

hether movies and TV programs ade in our n country re mo interstig tan movies an rogrms mde in other countries as een widely iscused .
May people re of the pinion ta doestc movies and TV rograms r btter than forin one .
Hoever , I strongly assert at movies and TV pogras mae in oher countries are btter fr the fllowig resos .
To begin wth , forign movies d TV prgrms ae more timulatin .
To elaborate , hir story ae better as thre are more twists a turns in pos .
Altough te lots full of turs , they still very reasonable , d ot mke their auiece fet tht e plots r vry trnge .
Mreover , the special effect are better because foreign ovies usull cs muc ore money hn native to make .
For example , the first one 3 dimensional mve , Avtar , h ove maker spend a lot of nerg and ti on devloping he novel movie genre .
It eventualy made very gd impression on t audine , and e most important for a ommercil move , it realy d very el at the box office .
Addiionaly , eople cn learn more things fm foreign TV programs a mves .
Watcng freign TV rorams nd movies , their viewrs can learn not on freign laguage but also xoic culres .
Furhermore , foreign TV r more internatinal n educaioal .
For instance , we c know man foein news from wachig NN .
The news in CN inluding events which r apening all ver th world .
ha 's mor , the Naioal Geographic n Discovr lo teach me a lot of information and knowledge hic I ca n't learn fo nativ programs .
In contrast , sme peol cnsier that domestc films a more famiiar tha foreign ones .
hy do nt ant to learn so uch becus they just watch ovies fo fn .
There is sme truth in e clam tha watcin movies a TV programs is a laxed activity .
Howevr , I still consider that if people a len some frein culture , or appreciate the spiis which oreign ilms cotain , tey could gt more reflection as recreating .
Plu , watcin foreign programs also could atta the al of those people-- relaxation .
In sum , although the ae some dissning vie , one n stll afly come to the conclusion that foreign fils ad TV prgras are more interstin than domestic movies ad TV progrms .
Although movies in ur own country ar moe popular tha past , the forei movies til play important role on domestic mvie goer 's md
Wth an intese pssin in fashion , I spire to ecoe a professional product merchandser in the pparel industry ad initiate myown bradng business wt my older siste and hr husband .
oh of whom hve re than iv yrs of experience in marketing planning n on a large numer of fabric sources .
Theefre , I la to maxiize my previous experience wih knowledge of psycholgy , skill of product dvelopment design to pursue graduate sudies , and build up my biliy in he Mstr of Fi Art program in Fashion merchanding at Acemy of Ar University .
It is said at t main objective of eleevision is ntrentein peol and ma tei re time happier .
Hoever , telvsion should n't be used nly for this rpose for different reasons .
On th e and , mos people have , at least , one television in their hoes , so it is very accessible to everyone .
For ths easn , instead of entertaining , television shou cntain educatv programmes .
Nowadays , cildren spend more im at home tan before .
They are se to manage different technologies as television or comptr .
I think ta childrn ca n't be supervised r their parents al te ie because they hve to work n mk hom tasks .
F tis reason is important for them having a good educative programme on television .
I ' am not saying that television a to educate r children , u it has to offer prormmes which mae tm revise essential things as numbers or lettrs .
elvision is ry mportnt to gve language ills to children .
Wen I was oun I used to tch television very aftrnon to learn intresting thigs as geography or maths and it heled me a l .
elevision allwed me to ler how to speak Catalan correctly an it also gave me a ood conversation issue to tk with fries .
Food passion !
I lik very uh to eat , when I a , in the ub near my house .
In this place " Stella d'oro " the owne prepare deliciou rol .
In particular vry week ou can fin " Il panin pi√π " , a speca rol created by e fancy of t ook .
Of course I prefer to go to this pub wi my fmily or ih my friends , espcially if I ha to celebrate something , for example birthdays , anniveraries or oething ele .
I rmmber , when e of my daughters celebrated e eighteenth birthday , he pub 's owner pu the numbr eightee , made by cheese on the rl , wt a little candle .
When I go tre I al dnk a good mixed eer : hl lit beer and half d ber th of a good flavor .
Of course wth e roll we alo order a ot of hips .
If we a al tha we e sil hungry we order akes .
hy have ay dfferet ckes : profieol , meingata , tiramis√π n so on .
Of curs if t six of us go together is quite expensie , b if I go only with my usband I do n't spend so muh .
I ugest everyone go to this place bcaue nt nly is the fod good b also the onrs ae er friedl .
The only probem is to find arkin space bcause this pub is in a narrow ro where it is ot easy to find pae to park the car .
Bu if you are lucky you can park .
Sme eople say that soping is not alwas enjoyabl .
Of cure , spending urs in th shopng mll may be tirng .
Bu it cn be also really rlaxing and plesnt .
It is ad ht only mn hat to go shoping .
Espcially with their mthers , glfriends or wves .
t as women thik tht shopping can be an unleasant experience .
Partcularly hen we tak about everyday runni fom shop to so to buy lettuce , me or a too past .
It can be really frustriting .
But wh we think bout going to the shopping centre wth our frinds it n be fun . We do n't even hae to have mny , because we c just go and do windowshopping .
itout pendig mney , we c et inired by ew collections or people ht we e in h city .
I c undrstnd pople who ay at hopping is boig .
Especially when we go ro shop to shop but we ca n't find anyhing interesting .
n I do n't een nt to think abo the siuation he we really nd to bu soethng eause of the cming por wedding .
But we can do onle shopping , which sees to be esir sometme .
It is a good for peopl wh do n't want to lve their homes or they just do n't like the crowded shops .
We need shoppin .
vn if we do n't av to do daily shopping bcause of our mote or someoy ls , someday we will have to go o d y something .
We al sometimes jst ne to get w clothes .
Generally , shoppig can be se as njoyable experience or us a usual need in order to urvive .
A mst fams person om my cntry is Mr. John Stefferson , who worsks in a department store and always plnning h to make people life more comfortable a better .
He deerves to be famous because he hs hi on charity and eps to poor families with little children .
Sometmes I lisen to e raio and hear his coments aot ome global problems in my o cuntry and sme suggest abut ow to make our life better .
The doorbel rang .
We I opened th do imagine my srprise .
There was a itle cardboard x wi my ne on the top .
I picked it up frm the roun .
I was just about to clse the or , when I herd mu fr t kitchen : " ho wa it , ran ? "
" at is it ? " h asked .
I had absolutely no ida .
I strted to open it vey carfuly .
Thr wa a ticket f my favourite msi band .
hey ad a concert that evening in e York .
I taked about it with mum . "
Should I go if I do n't know , wh ed ti to me ? "
She was rprisingly open to thought that I old ty it at leat .
It s n't common from h side .
So I did it .
I ws sitting and waiting in a conrt ha .
The eat next to me wer stil empty .
When it appene .
In th middle of a row was stndin my mum ih my dad , who had st returned from the war .
I we absolutely eited .
It ws the best igh of my life .
UNEXPETE VISIT
The or ell ang .
When I oened t or imagine my srprise ...
There was se , staying rnt me .
I thought I was dramig first .
hat the hell she a doig here !
w da she culd come to my door!hre w no wds to express my feeins ...
She 'd stolen my fiance many years ag .
We 'd been preparing to g married .
I'd een in my country f a while since I need to apl a vis for living in his country .
Sudden , he 'd cut the cnection btwen us .
I cud n't et in och it m whatever I 'd done .
ver ay I 'd tre was ueles .
He 'd se all between us .
Afer a whe , I 'd seen a picture on his facebook page .
It was an angagement in !
he congratulations words elow e pitue was explaining everything : He've g married to somone ese !
I coul n't eleve my eyes !
Hw come he 'd oe tat to me !
Wat happened all tho words he 'd given to me !
Aking him was useless .
Al the anser I could tak was a huge silence ...
I maged to kep calm though there was thunder nsid my heart .
Bt I oul n't speak anywa .
Just loked hr with askg eys .
" He 's ed . " e ad as if s a whispering .
Her voice was weak ad shak .
" I 'd fund hs in his office . "
Then handed me a box nd waked away .
Nthing more ...
Now , after all those lng years have gone by with ful of pain , disappointments , missing nd regrets ; ll I have was the memories which saved by m into a littl ooden box .
I 've never gt e reas made i lev me although all his lo o me , unfortunaely ...
eople ague tha toa 's televiso is a load of ubish , he uality of ay programs is absolutely questionable and in mny ase he language is vulgar .
Reasons y telvison hs inherite this reputation ar several .
First of a , te many repeas of all programs like serials or films do t motite people to ath it .
hen , e large nmer of ntertaiment programs brodcated dscourage those wh want more cultural or factual programs , as th hv ee drastically reduced .
It seems a result of t fct that , after a lng y , peopl prefe to unwnd in front of te televsio , wthing " entetainment programs " rather then ews or wha 's up in th Wrld .
Moreover , on televsion there are a t of advrtiing costantly interrupting h broadct , an of core hs ac is vry unpleasant .
Dsite al hese fct , it is without dou that teevison has chaed our lives .
Thee re lo positive things that we ha to take into consideration befre to condemn it .
For exapl , the wder choose of proras fom all er the World , allow us to dscoer new cultures , w languages ad n societies wihot travelling , a th nhace or knowledge .
In addition to that , th cost of te teeviion as an entertainent form copared to th cinema , he theatre or per is haper a affordable by everyone .
As , it is very importan to remember that we have always he possibility to cooe wha we want to watch an wn .
To sum - up , I hnk television is a er good val for money , the point is big abl to chos wha we want to watch .
Famous eple are eosed to critism nd public opinion , but hat dos it men ?
Firstl , there ar two kinds of famous people : those who an to have a private life and o do n't wt everybody knowing each aspt of their ves and those who sel certin parts of their lives in magazines , journals or TV programmes or heir entire piate life .
Secondly , taking this into acount , I hink tht everybody has the right of ving a rvate life and the right of living without journalists following hem to everywhere .
It 's tru hat teir lives are too mc exposed a th cn ot have a normal le .
Of orse , they cn contrl tha by complaining in a trial .
Thirdly , in my opinion they have th right also of selling ol te parts of thr lives they want .
B in cntrast , tre is t rolem of en he should stop , nd journalists continue sellng iformaton or pictur and it could arrive an embarrassing moment and if yo have sld a kid of thing like thi before you ca n't say nothin .
To sumarize , I blive at everybody desrve to have a private life .
Whe it does n't occur , hey have to go to trials .
Dear Jo ,
It is absolutely rwardng to receive god news fo an old friend who has bn absent of my lif for so log time .
I would be completely happy to prvie you with ome accommodtion whie you stay in my cutry .
I am current working at a plac here I am etting a ret age so I have e possibili to acompany y on yr journey .
We mgh go to the os reresentaive places of Mexico such as : Templo mayor , Canc√∫n , Acapulco , mog ay ohes .
In mexico , a foreign eron do ot fe difficulties to be hid by a compny . I would be leased to help yo with this part of your perience in my contry . I kn that yu are someone who loves anmls ,
peraps we ca go to the cit zoo in order to verify wheter there ae ay vacanis tha fit ith yu .
Something I can do is to make ome research bou the places that eed peopl wo speak Englsih fluently .
As you know , in th cuntry if you ae someone w speaks more than 1 language , you have the chances to obtain a eat job .
Please let me ow if u nd sometng extra while you are here .
Maybe a special diet , secal clothes or any kid of thing ou might need that will o be easy to find her .

THE MOST INTERESING WEEKND ON MY LFE
I had always believ tht th es mories of lif ere when yu meet new pole , e places , gong out with you friends , tkin sun on the beach , thnS like this .
Are butiful momet , but now I reckon that there is n't nothing more interesig tha havng al yo family togethe tlking abot hole background .
Surprising sories that we will not never imagine .
My family re n't so close ad is distribued in mny cities on my country , after some incidts in he past , many thngs canged and each family fllowed their own wy .
Howevr , my siblings and I decided to set up a b surprise to my fathe f h birthday nmbe 50 .
We tried to contat e mo mount famiy as we oud .
It wa a perfec weeknd because there wa a holiday on Monday .
We rnted a wonderful place outide r cit , spectacular amosphee .
It a e most interesting d astonishing weekend that I have lied eve .
Firstly , to s father 's face hn he w all people .
A on time I haven't een my fher so happy . econdl , seein how big is the famiy ow , ma children .
Everything was amazi , a lo of memores , we laughed a lot , we i ny activities like b , tble ames , watchd movies , swimmng ol , among thers .
w I beliee that the best moments in the ife r wh yu ave time wih your family , is th es wy to reharge eegy r everything .
Mn times we p more attention to other things , it can do it in ay opportunities .
Family is one , and we do n't kow wh can se them .
In my opinion travellng by car is more comfortable than travlling by pulic transrt ecause you can choose where do you want to go n e tme you prefer to srt yor tr .
Trelling arou the cy by car was faster than ulic trnsort .
If I won the lottery , I wod buy an lecric car because ou can u pak in the centr of the twn .
And when you nt to mv around our city , if you go by car , ost of the time you ca n't prk your r because there are er few r pars in te ciis .
Sometimes ubic transport is inerestin because y c use it whe u wnt to go to a party a you probbly rink om wine , eer , c .
If y woul ike to go fast to somwhere , do n't s pblic rasport becuse it is very sl .
e problem to use ur car insea of ulic tranpor is the pollution .
If everyone use pulic transport cliate change os not icreae moe .
Hi Conie ,
Hw r you ?
I 've seen your letter and I 'm writing ths to you to a what I do in my cotry to hp savig the eviroment .
At my schol I do n't do at much ecaus we are just ie people that are worried abut the world .
We tied to convince th Headmaster to hlp us monetarily but it was n't enog .
At home I convinced my fmly to recycle and reus e wat that we ca n't drink , to ive to our plas .
w what do ou do at your school and at your home ?

Indroduction
The aim of this report is to otline what are t best plces to have fun in Valenci f youg eple , ht faclities exist for them d hw tese cul be made better .
Actvities around the iy
My ity , Valencia , is a touistic cit situaded by the ea .
Yung people ca enjoy oing to the cinema in the city cente after having so " tapas " an soe drik .
Also , it ould be a ood idea go to te bea to ped t dy and pla voeyball or sunbathn , because this it is lways a good plan .
Valeni , has different rea to go t in the evening , but sme of them required h passpot , so if you ar youger tha 18 it wold be dificult to enter .
Moreover , you can go to ea " Paella " and ride around e " Albufera " of Valencia in a mal bo .
However , he rt and scence mueum , it old be the funniest plan .
Othe activities in t surroundings .
In addition i suggested going by bus around t suroundings of the city , whee ou can do adventure sports , like canenin , cimbng or just wling aron he ountains a enj t countryside
Recommendations
I recomed that tey shuld do both activities , alencia ity nd aso de the urroundings .
Mabe I could check if I can brg you some free tickets for e pubic transport .
It would be great !
My family aand I lk to watch movies all t tie .
We a alwys go to e cinema to watc a new one .
My favourite kid of mve is cmdy a drma cmedy ecause it has iteresing lo and person , wh wtces comedy can lought al th time .
Whle person is watching ti nd of movie he / she is jut relaxing a a a od time .
N I will further develope ur last statement .
As Lod Cohen ( the Dretor of e Worldwide Market Analysis ) sd lottey play is o economicall irrational and uninformd .
He presens a heoy in which buying lottery tickets is no a misgudd iput into walt prductin as sme crtics believe , u a valuable input into craing a sen of posiblty frm scaping from oe 's current life by acquirin wealth .
It is certainl tre th eope w play are almost certain to lse one .
hen 's knwledge is that playing the lottery is not automaticly irrational .
Some people like to calclaed th gain or lose from buying the lotery bu other peoe that ca afford a dlar ticket now prefer to keep teir deams .
Peop do n't invest the money ey sped on lotery .
hey spend it and gt thoe dreams in retur .
Though this as been an amusing deate , we the affirmative side , on the weight of our argument and proof , have concluded that lottry shoul n't be nned in e US a Spai , bcause it is a tradion , it gies hlp , ope a support to public entities d it mus be a rational investment .
Hel dear en ,
I received your letter yesteday .
Sorry f my ae anwr .
I ope my suggestions will elp yo .
Ou ity has only on airport .
irs of l you should id h entranc of th airport .
Then y huld kow that o here will be two kinds of transport .
Txy is e first variant .
It 's the quickest a to oe to my home but at te sa tme it 's re expensive .
Also you an use e s .
u should write me te ext time of your plae arival .
Tn I 'll write back the timetable of bus arrivals .
It might be re boring way to my home ut I lk it r the price .
We u hr the u stop Ploshad Truda u soul eve t bus and I 'll meet y at th b stop .
In my opinion e weather is beter oay tan yesterday .
t it hs een rainig f fur dys .
So it would be ery well if ou ta a war oa nd an umbrll .
Hopig to see you son ,
your friend , Smon .
Rport :
e swimming pool in Brunete hs cusomers from all age groups , t it is especially stable both for young and elderly pepe in order to mprove their mobility .
e building s t changing rooms o men nd woen .
everal bthooms ar vailabl with cold a hot water in tm and a 25 metre - lngth eate pool .
As far as I am concerned there e some pros n cons about the use of the swming pol .
On the o hnd eveythin is very cleaned inclding floor , th and crridors , in addition , if ou are a disabled rson you will t have ny trobe to get thr because there a some mps to help ou cme in .
On the other hand u will have to pa 45 euros a mnth to use faclites , and beides , you ill n be able to do eercise bcase tre is not any gym inside the building .
In my opiin the swimming pool is conveniet becase y an walk to wim if you live in ton bu is vey expensive , particulaly o youg pople .
I suggest ht prie should be lower than they acually are .
Faou peopl have en alwas sorrunded by a o of jornalist a paparazzies who follow thm wherever they go .
The people cud be politicians , film trts , singers , football layrs and so on livin in a onstnt stres ecase tey an not hav a " norm " life , and , ro my ont of ve , that 's nral because thy lie for thi , they are public people and because of hi they have to keep calm ad carry ith it .
Therefore , most of this aous pole complain of is b it is loial hat l the media , televiion , radio and journalists r constanlt evoting very iute of the dy to them because people are interested in tem , in noing wat hy ar doing every seod , in knowing wih wom they are , in knowing what te lie or do n't like , their hobbies , in srt , in knowing everything bot hem .
In conclusion , bing famous is raly dificul d frustrating as ll , but in conrast , ey earn a lot of money and they are ved by so any people though ty have to accept some citics because o verbody has to lve them .
I do ree with a stateme tha shopping is t always enjoyable .
When we nd to b smehing , we ostly choose shppng centres .
It has many disadvantages .
It 's a lag space ih a o of sops , so we need much time to visit a of them .
fer a f hours we are so tired , that we do o have per to do anything ele .
Beides , in the shopping centres there 's a loud energtic music plaed al the im ad a crwd of people , so we get hm with a huge headache .
Mne is noher reason why we do not always enoy th shopping .
We live in a ti of acquisitiveness a pele buy may tings , even if they ca n't afford it .
Of course , pope usuall do ot ed al of tse things .
Th behaviour caes a mal hngver and a iral of redit .
Times in which we liv a cnducive to addictions .
People adicted to shopin in the lng run do not njy this rita anyore - the do it ut becuse tey have to , alhugh they av no ney n no spac at oe r all those things they u .
I think we should learn to bu onl things we eall ed an we ca aford .
Sometimes beter is to visit soe small shops than big centres .
This hould help us ejy shopping .
Public tanspor is the fture .
Tda in big cites pubic rnsport is necessary for tourists , students , is and workers ; but te situation is ey diffeent in sal cites .
In tay there are fw citis ith e hunderground n fen in te saller cties thre a only u .
A god public transport is e sign of a civilized city . in this wy ther a fewer cars so less traffic .
Public traspot also reuces t cr ' pollution ad svs fuel .
I pe r the et generations a better public service n an increasement of is u .
thanks to this e lf stryle our cies wl be mr veable .

The reasons or Greece 's terribl economic situation are that Greece a surrender its currency sovereignty to the Europea Central Bn , by whic Greece could not aply moneary policy to spur t ecnmy , and the Greek goernmnt is very corrupted so at Greeks could eaily dodge taxe .
In contrast , in awan , we have our own curren and th government is efficient ad well - organized .
Clearly , Tain ill n be the next Greece .
Monetary policy could be a very ueful short ter financial tool for a governme to stiulate ts rsening economy , and , from t empirical xperience , mn ountris ave successful applied sh policy .
In 2012 , Japaee cntral bnk unprecedented depreciated Yuan , which hs oviouly improved its exors n revered its economy from stagnaion .
Obviously , Taiwan h i own currency , nw Taiwa olla , and if Taiw 's eonom is worsening someday , Taiwase government coud simply mimic wha Jaanese govrment did in 212 .
Not only Taiwan is diffrent from reec in currency sovereignty , it al ins in government 's eficiency .
According to a lbal urvey , Taiwan wins repuatin in efectiveness , in which Taiwan government has legislated severe laws to prevent corruption .
Terefoe , Taiwanes ae to y taxes by rgulation ad do ot dare to vade taxes .
Without a doubt , the efcacy of Taiwanese government is beneficial to peop 's elfae .
All in a , Taiw has currec sovereignty an is wel - know r it effectiveness .
Therefore , aiwa woud nt be sunk dw like Greee .
As a county , Taiwan has to stick to i ordinary at to create lovly d healhy environment to t civilians .
Oe upon a me a mason aled Nick ta hd a family of four , tw sons nd h fe but hy had onflicts it th stuies of their children , the oey he earned was not enouh to maintain the wole family thy we in povey .

After months of orking in t hus he inished , and his cousin gave him a bons reward of e millon dollars to start with , buying a big houe with eveythin they want .

The pie cat ows the princil cases hich justify why gricultura lands became less prouctive , whera th table correlates thse caues with hree different regions of the word which had land degraded , naey Not Amrica , Europe and Oceania , during the 1990s .
Ovall , it is cla ha the mai cause for land degredation ere defrestation a over - grain .
These cuses aso ad a negtive impact on two regions that were analysed , in Europe and Oceania , and , consequetly , these areas ad higher res in trs of total ld degraed .
A lser look at the pie hat reveals that over - grazing as h most important reaso why land w so degraded , with the higest percentage of 35% .
hs as followd by the deforstation , wih 30% , while oer - cultivatio d 28% .
Finall , 7% could be explained fr other reasons .
It m be jusfied by the fact that hee was an eces of chmicls in the agricultural activity .
This alo ned to be cpared to he table .
Nt srrisingly , these causs plad an important role when we alk bou h ercentage of lnd which wa affeced by the causs , particularly in Europe and Oceania .
In e first case , Eurpe reprented te highest percenage of land degraed caused by deforestation nd oer - cultivation , 9.8% and 7.7% respectively .
Ths as a great impact on tol lan degraded as uope ws re affected , with a total of 23% .
By another side , Oceani had the higes nd degrded rate at 11.3% bacause of ve - graig , which also contributed to ving 13% of land degraded .
By contast , in genrl orh America had te lowet rates in deforestation d over - raing , with 0.2% nd 1.5% espectivel .
fo hs reso , tis regin presened the lowest percentage of land degraded , it ony 5% .
There are man faous uildins in Guangzhou .
e of them is Canto Tower .
If y trael to Guangzou , yu ca n't miss ts series becase th is a symbol of Gangzhou .
Canton oer is located at an ntersection of Gngzhou New cty Central Axes an Pearl River .
It is the hihest tower in China and te third hihest tower in the orl .
he eiht of th tower is 600 metres , th 40 metres man body an 5 metres of is antenna .
The tower ha a specil name clled ' slim wist ' because te hpe of it is twisin .
We n se different picue of the ower fo different agls .
hi is nt only a sightseeing buildn , but alo has a lot of reessional facilites .
Fo xample , he owe has 4D nema , h highest revolving restaurat and so on .
Cantonese always spend their oliday wth their cild here .
Do u ant to go to have a oo afer eading my introucion ?

AR UR FAMILY MBERS UR ES FRINDS ?
Firstly , I must say tat I do n't consider that my family members re my bet friends , not only ecause hey hav othr problems to cre abut u also because I do n't know how to tel them my problems .
However , we considr a friend that rson you can ha f wih , augh nd eet . I 'm ue to do that with my parent and my brohers but it 's not t me as wen I et my est frieds .
oreovr , I think that I should n't ask hm to hv wht we call a " thera moment " as I do wi my best friends when I 'm worried r something or somen , in fact I woud n't ko hw to sart telling tem about tat .
om teenaes have the luck to be on - minded ad thy now o to speak with thr parents and it 's a goo way to solve problms .
In my opnon I think that I should have more confidence wh my faily and remember th they wo n't leave me f omthing I had on in ther way my best frinds n do .
In my on , there is no futu for public transprt , ecuse the te ecessry to gt to th ci centre is the sae walking or by bus .
Travel by bus is expensiv , bored and annoying .
e route mak many stps , in different places , so e ay in the ma is a mess .
Th is like tha all days , excet Suay .
On Sunday , the bs do n't work uti 3 p.m.
om hi hor , there is ny one service every ou , util 10 p.m. Anye of tese 7 bu takes ss a half hor to ge to he city centre , in spie of Sunday ha not traic jam .
ses are slow a isy , and when you can e f of te , o e tired and angry , and probbl y ae not on time .
Is mh mre convenint you wa to the ciy centre .
The ow is not a big city , so h air is n very dirty .
At the se tie , you an g fi wakng approimately 30 or 40 minutes , nd u il n ae h problem for park your r .
You il epen the sa te traelling by bus or walking , but the diffeence is to g angy or not .
Transprtaion is a means of moment of one georahical location to anter by n eas of trasort .
We hve fferent means of transport .
They are transport by lan , by air , by s and by rain .
We know in t lden dys o our forefathers suffered in thr movemen .
If a person wants to trevel fom ano to Lago he has no choc bu to track .
Therefore , is not easy bk there for abody to u othe means because there wa non .
At present there r many meas of transportaion .
T techlogy bought about lts of development in transportation .
We c travel by ir using th aircraft , aroplane , hecopter d rest .
Unlike before we have b ships to use on the ea .
The rain is lso a vey useful eans of transportation and very economical .
I believed that technology really improve or ays ad mns of ur transport .
So whoer wat to star a journey has several oice of transport , eaithr by s , by air , by land or by foot .
I can not orget to tal aout crs , lorry and hicles .
They are very uefl and peedy .

Swmming is my favourite srt in the world , I started it whe I was five yeas old , I really enjoy it , I feel that the watr is my place in t word , I fel free .

I he to simming in the Pran 's river wh all th simmers d coaches .
First , whn I wa in the starting ine I fet could t finish the competition , then whe we were in t ter the coaches i o stop to encourage so a es to wim to he finishing line . I ws so exciting to see our family waiting for us clapping and souting loudy every time one of us arrved .

In this essay , I am going to discuss whethr bildin a byas around o twn is eneficial to our community or not .
Oe of the advantages pointed out by local politicins in the meeting a tat this bypss wold lower th rate of a polluon around tn , which I highly agee it ecase h extra traffc caused due to t pasing cars add to the vehicles used by h locals cause massiv smo in e amosphre , n to mentn being terribl b to t health of the walkng , ycling ciizens , especially ong children , baes .
Another important point is ta this bypass would impove th traffic in the on center .
Mostly durng 7 to 8 am and 3 to 4 pm , when people go an finish wor , that is when we ge h most wful traffic jams , someties it takes an hor to et for point A to B in town hich is a terribly log time not to mentio parents who ha to tae thr children to school , nursery and ten e to or , too .
On th other hand the bypass migt cause a drastic ro in orism in the town .
Hoever , it is also tue to sy ta people who are actally iterested in istorical sies would viit the twn anyway .
ll in all , I would s th byps would be ore of a disadvantage than advantage , becas it would cut us o from people d he town ould receive ls fundn if it 's less important .
Local pliticians should fcus on sustaiability , usg veicles which do o harm the nvronment .
On the th of Ail I met a oup called Emblem3 .
Because I i n't find ny tckt fo the concert in odon I bugh on fr th concert in irminham .
I 've booked e tckt nearly one month eore the event .

Else te ickt o te cncer I bought the VIP ticet as well , so I had to go before to Birmngam , because the etrance to the venue w at 17:00 and as I liv ose to Lndo , I ad to leav at about 12:00 so I d n't hve to sh .
I got to Birmingham at 14:00 , I think , d en , as I 've never ben to Biringam I hd to ok fr the 02 Acadey , where the eent tok pla .
When I arved here , I quee fo the VIP qee .
At 17:00 they let us in t venue and he made al the checkings .
Ate 30 minuts started te acousic perfrmnce wich lasted for bot 15 minus , afterwards we tok pctures .
Wen erybody tok their hoos , mblem t bacstge to get ready or the concert an after one ou it terted .
I eft the rea at midnight and I nt to an hotel ht I did already book onlin .
On the ay after I went back home .
It w e bst day of my life .

o lso mentioned that I wold nee to work in the kitchens helping .
I culd ls add at I know how to cook for os of people .
For all he esons I mentioned beor , I think I am h right person for this job .
I look forwad to receivig yr answer .
Yours Faithfully ,
Maria
It 's tu that commuting to work is n't as onvenint as ong to work by c .
ha 's he reason why more eople prefer to spend mre time stck in traffc istening to sog nstead of waiting a long time to take a bus which is usualy crowded .
On top of tat , akig a bu wo n't necessarily mean that o wll save time ecause both buses ad cars wo n't be ble to mve in the rush hour .
Besides , a car ies you more freedom and flexibilit to ak your n shedule while public transport limits y to a timetble ha t always me our eeds .
fter cr prevailed among the puic , our governets hae tried to pa rouh roas , which promotes pepe to use cars even me .
Nowadays , it mgt be argued if te current transportatin stem would be worig in th uure lk pesent , whil thee is a still big room o ublc transportain remaining as a significant method .
This essay will offe a couple of poins about whether publc transportation will still be around us or if it wl disappar completely .
r a strt , the convenience for us to travel arund would probably be one of te main arguments .
In me countries , h amount of transportation uc as train is not sufficiet , hch focs people to use private cars .
oever , it is also tr hat there a always minors wo he no choic but to take pubi transpot and also for their prens it is definitely oe reliable .
at is aso important is te mpat on the evirnment , which is already consierabl damaged by human tecnoogy .
If a car whi emits no serious global armng gas would be developed , hre oul be no argumen that people had btter reduce u use of rs , yet , as ln as we are manufacturing hm we coud n find oe eco - friendly n fficint ways tha pulic trsportation .
In cnclusion , it is my belief that it is not possib for public transport to disappear in the futur vn ough traeling with cars is more convenient than taveling ih just trai or bue .
But in the same way as ars evelopmet , r governmnt migt have to ake some prores on publc transort to courage citizens to be moe c - friendly .
All of the world is consantl chaging - develop a new technologies , people invented new think .
t wy ?
To ake life easie . Peole away an to ak beter their lfe .
Why not ?
I thik that the ome of e utue ill be dffeent han n , ut the mn uction of te home wo n't chge , because for ages home have ben a lace here people an eel safely .
Evrybody thin hat om is refuge .
In my pinin om in the futre will be simiar to present houses .
Ter aways will be the tchen , bcause we must eat , always wll be he batroo - ou kow why .
A in te home always wi be a room to sleep an elx .
Home in the utre may be more modern and saet .
Everywhere wll be camas and motion senor .
Kitch wil be better eguipped , a be with smt appliancs an peope , w ca n't ook , wil prere the ma by yourself .
May be in the utur ome wil be self - leane ad we ne not can up .
I think hat he differnces between home nw n home in te futur will be small .
Personally houses in th future wil not be osy , ut vry sterile . I do n like it .
Home should associate with fily , happines .
Not wit cd n spaious room .
I tin th statement is somewha ue .
Travelling by car is ettin more convenient .
Traffic accidents , the main roblm of ca travelling , wl be solved by self - driin echnolog .
Although driving by cr is less safe tan using ublic transport at present , dring will be safe .
oweer , thr is also a problem .
Havng a car takes much money .
Using public transport is cheaper than haig a cr , especially living in ura area .
h second proble may be solved by r - sharing .
If oe wants to go omewhee , one can u a shar r which is parkd at desigted ea .
By this method , people have to p sml f for us a car , ot much one uh as having a ca .
If car - shring and self - driving technolog e mixed , it will be much moe convenient han boh te convtional public transport and travelling my car .
ople can go anywhere thy want to go frm nywhre .
Peopl do n't hav to posses their c paying much money .
It ll be a nw pulic transpot .
Al my lfe I practiced sports , bt definitely my faoite sport is squash .
I started to traning when I was ten years old .
I had never paye a raquet 's sport bfore , so I a very excited to hit t small blck bal with my rackt .
hree times a wk I payed , ten I went mr ofte .
The first yea I went to a ournament in Toreon and I win h first plc , drin e frst 3 years I was rnkin in h frst 10 lace of Meico , but he I had to ruce my practics because I had a roble wth my nes .
ly sash is an aesome activity and is easy to ern , I lv that hi game is vey fast and you do a lt of exercise .
e bad ws is that in Mxico is not very common , so it 's a little bit difficult to find a field n is exensiv , more or lss h ric per hour is $ 10 pesos .
o someone new in ths srt I wou recommend be patnt d costnt in h training , becuse the pactie is what ake you btte and helps to improve your level , a filly always enjoy the game .
Alwas been fre .
Never had ny serous rlatinship .
Te longest wa at the imary chool , lasted 2 days , bcase her mother could cook the inst bisuits ever tasted .
Now he was 35 and he was till keeping on smle at the ne of h coleagues and friends marriages .
He was so cyicl to un out to be ve nasty d unpopolar .
Love last wo and a half a year , he ke to reid hiself .
Soon or latr mariied people wi t ivorce .
Look at me , he said , I 'm fe .
No one is happier thn me .
Since one day he met a girl , on e rain , s was n't that beauty but she had , you now , tt smi , so peaceful , so harmnic .
It was lov at frst sigh .
They arted talking lamng or the ran la and fter o hous hey were still chatting .
They aughd so mc tt they both forgot to et out at th ght sp .
The poor tw ha gone too far d now ty h to coe bc .
It as n't a prolm .
Te had a lot of fun .
Finally he arived .
He said hllo to the girl siling .
Michae closed the do ad knew at that momnt he ad me a mistak .
Nowdays everybody has oe or more cars , as a consequence of that , some people bliee that pulic transport is goin to disappear .
Thee are several reasons to believ that ; firstly , may people are influenced by the dvertising which mixe happines wth riing cars an makes popl ink that public transport is ot as a sart option as cars .
In second place , it is not enjyable to wait for the us or the undrgrond .
On the oter hand , there ar a number of reass against t end of the ubic transport .
For eample , yo must ake ubic trasprt insead h car because it prodces es pollution .
In addton , public transport is cheap beuse to buy a car meaning spend a frtne and in bg ites , where r cocered bout th evironmet ch as Amsterdam or Tko , thee are ay facilities as mobile phone pplictions or special offers .
To sum up , no one kos e future ; however , I blieve tat traveling on public transport is as convenient as by car or more becase it is god to ae up money ad to reduce contaminaio .
" There is no ture r public transport becase travelling by c is so much more onenient "
In my opinion es pople ar travlling by publi transport and stared to by their n cars whh is mr comfortale to use whenever you ae in a urr or not .
In e ist ace o feel more comfortable in or own car than in a us for exmple . You do n't ned fear hat omene could sudely stole your purse or ou do n't ae to listn to te others hen you travel by your car .
Stuies hav hon that yor sel esteem and feelings of prtecton increase when yo a a ar drir .
You do n't have to nulge tayig in a crowded place wth pople u do n't ko .
ving me mony an uy a a is the best hing o cn do .
In th second plae t all pulic transpors are in tei bet shape .
Soe of hem are dirty nd sel .
If you hve your own car these thig do n't boter o anymoe aue y wash your car anytime you ant .
In conclusion travelling by a is far better thn usin public tnsport

Recently , studyng onne hs bcome a very populr alternative a to stu .
Although it provid tudents with ot of advntage , not everythng is as good as it soud .
irs of a , stuyin online es not allow students to sk teachers abu questions .
How can ty olve heir problems if there is a lck of student - teacher ineraction ?
What is ore , is kin of students are betwee ighteen and twenty w , when te need to socialise and ntract with oter stdens to njo their free time .
Somethn impossible if they stu onine , wich mean hat their only classmate is he computer or t laptop hy use .
However , his method of studyng is cheaper hn the cmon way , d it lso can be completey free whi is a ig advantage .
Moreer , it allows yo to study with yur w rhythm whout thiking abut th rest .
For these reasons , I prefer the common wa than studying olie .
Neverthless , I can undrstand people w choose h second pton .
It is up to yu !
No Futue fr public transpor :
Nowadays people want to tavel by their wn conveyance by their own car , ie , scooter or something like that .
Everyone wants to hve a stress less / happy journey hether it is r a long route or nt .
It is really realistic too , ecaus we all at to save our tme d ishes r a happy journey time .
No let me tell you t scenario of public transport .
Firt of all we always eed to wait fo it n it will run accoring to the shedued time only .
In wite it is fie we an ajust in cow but if we talk aut summer session we n t adjust when we are travelling in a suffocated nvironment .
We ed to book tickets in advance , in case we are laning to go via public tranport because agai the issue of availability of seats re ter .
I ive in Tiste , a vy beautiful city , ut ths ci a a grt proem : it s a lot of as , mr tan ihabitants .
Of course it 's an xaggeration , ut I say this to conirm tht in ti city the nuer of the cars is very ih .
By h a , he pulic rnsport is not so covenent , because at a certain hours ou can no fin b .
In ur ity the buse st at midight .
Ao the tiket pie is not cheap .
Anothe poblem of the buses is hat if you tk one uring certain ous , it 's iposible to find a place fre to it own .
So travelling by bus is o convenient , t only r time u also for t problems tht you can ind .
T other quston is at Triete is sitated na Slovenia , wher , the price of petro is cheaper than in Iay , so a great numb of inhabtants of our city preer to fe te car directly in Slovenia , where hy cn find uch more competitive prices .
My father lives in Pordenone and he sells cars .
He wnts to convince me to us alternative meas of transport , ut after I see th price of ti ecological vehcle I considered hat I 'll by one of them only if the price becomes
loverer .
Currntly , eple think about if they c e good nglsh in my country or have to move to english speaking country .
And fter that , it depends on h pesoality , atus ( sing , ngaged or mrried ) , nd vn the ages of popl , they wil decide to larn in her own country or go aboad for getting english .
On the hnd , studying abroad is a great opportunity , especially for young people .
ey usually go abroa because te ae not so mc responsiilties us it prepares tir professional futre .
But Ty can only afford it to work as a au pair , water , kitchn porter or ortr that include accmmodation , normal wgs and you do n't ed high level of eglish .
On the other hand , yo igt ind yousef getting hesick .
Of course , you leave a lo of things , su as our fmily , frnds , oods , paces , wn thins , etc . , nd noody put up th bei very fa wy from all tee hings .
oreover , people about mid 's 30 yers od , ey do no sully lee hir contry d try to ge new anuage from a living .
is wa is ceap as well and th have n to change eerthing arond ther ife to achieve this aim .
In addition , with is ages , normally eole ve more carge , maye children , mortgage , partner , etc .
From my opinion , the best w for learning really oo a language it is iving in the me country where people seak it .
So , you do n't hesitae a mo to the new coutry , in hich you do nt ony gt laguage , een different culture and ifestyle .

In te past eople has to anage their time so thy could go to the wor , take cae of thir hildren and maybe als study .
Globalitation tart in the 20 's , so a huge aount of population hs experience this cnge , in my opinion is ind of od .
No eopl can iteract ith other peole fm other countries by texting , facebook or whatsapp .
T ne of expot and import items hs increased in e last 10 yeas consequetly the ife of the people a raed in faster respond .
Everyon neds an isant swer to what ey akng for , if th send an email o mus rceived it in less than 1 minute .
The persona contact shows a decreae in hs time because pole do n't want to face teir real problems , istead they can see all the poblems happened in the orl by ther sartphones .
In e future pepl will comunute betwen hem by their computers , cellphones , tablets d this kd of technology will ed us to a lonely life .
Nowdys , we alreay have thns lik mar hoes , which can nearly do eveything we want to .
And we have some ote media gdgets .
B will ople 's ives really chge so dramatically in th et 50 years ?
In my opinion it wo n't .
I 'm of the opinion hat peope 's lives wo n't cange etemely in t et 50 ars .
Of course there will exist ome more electronica things like some w hnys , with functins we could expect right o , and ther will be some other gadgets .

To t it in a utshel we could y that our lobal wold will be or electronical , and the will be ore gadget , but that wo nt change our lives ramatically .
Hi brother ,
I 've bee thinking about what yu sai to me the previous wek .
It 's tue that we do n't y attention to or radma 's .
he loves us nd she always ook afte us whe dad and m could n't do it .
I believe that we ave't never thanked her wht se dd and do for us .
For ha I 've ha h ide of giving h a preset .
You 're gee with me , r n't you ?
Yesterday I saw a nce present for hr in te n mall of Jrez , called AreaSur .
It was an amaing gold watch .

I think tha a clock would be useful as wl as ecessary for hr .
Wt do u think about buying it for her ?
If yu do n't think he same as me o can hoos another psent , I wo n't hve any poblem .
Anywa , we shoul go to the mall tgeher and thre we will ae the ina decision .
We can go by bus .

Ququ
Wha 's the sfst ransport in the world ?
And t mot comfortable ?
In my opinion a transport is completely safe , however people say t pne is he sfest transprt .
n , myb the cr is he mot cmortable .
It is rue that oh are advtages and disadvantages .
Travelling by car can be enjoyable , dangerous ad rexing , I kew this is a contradiction , but I an explai it .
Relaxing beause you n trave by yuself , wi friends d with yur family .
en y ma a ng tr you can go without pressure .
If ou re ired o c stop at a petrol stati or at a restaurt to relx yourself , nd if in e car tee ar or ssengers you an change with thm , so yo will feel es tred .
Eve travel by car , in my opinion , as a lot of problems .
ome advantages could be :
- asoline is t expensive
- here are n't enoh a pars n ey ar very expensive , for examle when yu travel to Madrid it is impossible to ind a free parking .
- Ote yo cn be involved in city trffic jams , especially in he rush hour .
This sitution ny is present in Caceres whe ther is a rainy y , bt in other cities like Mdid , Barcelona ‚Ä¶ is a dail situation .
I tnk , drivin ca be dangerous because peope ust respect speed limits , n not every time that it is .
Pople does n't wear te eatblt , u phones , an even hre r w dink we they are gng to rive .
Al these malpractice can make they have an accident and other innocent persos are in daner .
Eve hliday , he DGT , in Spain , make an awarness cmpagn to remebr us he good maers whn we are driving .
On the other had , traellin by plne people say is safe then do it in others rasport .
I do n't make ue this ffirmtion .
I 'm afrid to travel by pln .
I ae the moment when t plae is takng of , and when it is touchig off .
I 'm afraid so tht started en I was travelln to Mexico in my honeymon .
In tis mmet there was a topical sor , and t turbulences are horible ; bu a n ime I av tpped to travel by plane .
I kn is the better ption hen you an to travel arod .
It is ru , tha lane is very expense , at least I never haen't be able to book a cheap ticket .
I lo f e perfect oer ut in smer it is impossible to find it .
To sun up , all kind of transport have positive n negtiv aspec , b dpening of o necessity we u one or anher .
Fo example here are a ot of countries where bk is the most main of transport , lk Belgium .
I remember ther were kilometres and kilometres of cycle in , on the cotrary han ere in Spain , hee few cities like Mard or Bcelona , strengthen their us .
I do not agree wih h situation .
This is imle because not everyone a a personal vehicle .
In addition , because of the ga betwen th uer class to e lower class eple .
Public tranprt is one part of social developent .
It will make people fee comfortable .

WAYS TO TAKE CARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT
Introduction
T ai of this rpot is to inform abou e ay in wic my illae aries out measures to look after te environmet .
or thi , we will nalys several aspects su as ht loc residents do wi th rubbish and ow anja√≥n tries to kee he area clean ad ake it attractive to people .
Rcycling : The best way to al wi the rubbish
Nowdys there is more ad more rubbish because of th gh amount of pckage used to wrp products and icreae in consumpion .
In ajar√≥n as in t est of th ilages a towns people e etting se to buyi a nsuming uc more tan tey ued to do in the at .
Howver , in recent years my vilag has en promoting ways r people to get ie of the rubbish in a conscious way .
A numer of recycling bns have been placed around h vilge and citizens are bin encouragd to join severa ongoing courses to ise their aweness of the impotance of recycling .
F these reason , wa people usuall do with their rubbish in their aiy routne is to sort it and put it in the correct bin .
Keping t village cle ad attrtive
Laar√≥n is one of the mo tourist vllges in e region La Alpujarra ; therefore , it is very important bot fo th council and the local rsidents to keep the villge clan .
To g thi h couni es diffrent enviromenta actiities o the citizens to take part in .
For instanc , mothy it is held a competition where participants have to cln and pck rubbsh up rom difrent areas of te villge .
At e end of e competitio those whs ar is caner and attractive eeive an award .
Conclusion
We have to bear in nd h important te envirnment is to us .
If we l wre aware of this and d smehing to hep it in ou daily routines , th planet wold thank us fr his .
There are t opposite opinion out ilitry service .
On one , nd military servce st be mandatory .
thrs consider that it is military srvie is unnecessary nd shold be vountary .
First of all , there is no absolutely sfety in the modern wrd .
Thee are diferent dangers of a militry nare such as trrorist attck , was n othe armed conflicts .
Therefore , cmulsory serice at in the amy gives special military knwldge , whic helps te population to protect ther ountry durng a milary conflict .
As a result , the are more chaces to vercme the conflc wth minimum human losses .
Secondly , the mandatory military seric can develp e character of a perso , making it stronger .
More specificall , it allows for understndng of teamwork , develops organizational klls and ractice discipline .
Moreover , it n educate young people be or self - eiant , beaus the majorty of teenagers at the age of 18 do n know how to be indpendent from thi parnts .
However , the critics claim that obligory military service is a waste of me and has a negtive impact .
or example , it is dificult to find a good job or go to university after militay service , because durig the one or two years of service , soldiers do o deveop y knowledge excet miitary .
ls , the time spent seving in te am cn uproot or separate families or fiens ' reltions .
other big problem is that military sevic is dangerous d has a risk .
Ther are difeent physical xercises that can be harmful to health .
Beside , here a emergencies , whih ca happen th gu or weapons sch as explosions and accident .
Furthermor , tee re haing acs at in h amy .
It means ht soldiers o have lreay served some time , bully and ba up new recruits for fn .
The acts oft turn out to be ragi havi a long post traumatic effect on the young person or en oss of ie .
Army yers ften have an impact on the ole amly , especially in cas of buling or t possibility of being ent to the wrzone .
Fnlly , here is a very complex opc and both opinins av advantages and disadvantaes , but it ca be seen that he militay situation is unstable in e world .
Ti mens ta pele need to know how to poect themselves n militry services is a good ay for it .
I prefer to eat at hm
Firstl , the oo I ae by myself is more trustful than the food tt is made in restaurants .
Because I do n't ko what kids of ingredients te retaurant put .
Also e fo I ak by myslf is much healthie .
Because al of the resturans want to arn mon , so they ill just u chap n not ealty ingredets to cook the food .
But if I ma my own food , of course I wo n't use ny kn of unhealthy ingredients .
So e food I mad by my wn hands is safe tn n other food that is mde in restaurants .
An lso hemade food s better qality an lo pri restaurants .
Secondly , it 's mh cheaper to ea at home , because restaurants want to an money .
So you can save lots of mony if yo cok at hm .
Some people think ookin themselves is to annying or tired so they go out to et .
u actually if ou cook muh you cn ue or nrgy so you an conme ur eigt .
Alo if u cook hree tmes a da your cokng ability will go up .
Tirdy , ating at home is ore omfortale .
he people are suounded by strangers peole ll think they re wachin me so I ca n't do that or this .
But if you eat at ho you do n't ne to be arig that somebody will look at y open our mouth to i or talk too loud .
Also the restaurant do n't know h mh yo can et , so sometimes te gi you o es food you do n't get ful .
Or somemes th ge you o mc food so y hve to throw it away .
Ad as o know , throwing food away is a ad habit to do which kes u planet , Earth will be polluted
Fourthly , u wo n't he to waste yu time gong o to in a restrant d oe ba home .
n sometimes if the are many cutomes you have to wait r the chef to ook other 's ood first . You can ae time if you eat at om .
ifthy , we can have a family time while eating .
Of course , it does n't ean ht you ca n't talk wh famlies when you a outside .
But if you e at me with ur fmily you ca ave a joke while repring dshe or talk about their o private lf things .
Becase it 's not feel fe to ak athing outside bcause te pepe at the next able migt hea wat yu a talking aou .
So by having a family time wie eating home you can ve a tk and be a mu closer family .
Bcuse of hes kinds of advantages n reasons I prefr to eat at home .
To sum up , the fundmntal characteristic of socia media is he dsign of " Virtua profile " , it requires ti to maintain connection btween links , friends ad be part of groups , ts connections ll produce negatives effects espeialy on psychological well - being .
Thi outcome , alog with sveal studies suggests reaonale se of connection media .
However , it is als lkey that people 's li , uh as loneiness n depression , might explin the effects tat social eia can have .
urtherore , it is also osible that in a fute people wl be a sbject responses , pos and ha rooms , in which awrenes of wrong vocabulary , poor routines and ompulsie use .
In cnrast , one positive aspect of ocial meda cover e education area , in which the knowledge , the expansion of ideas , ad he discover of different was of learing will contribut in the community .
oe eople claim ht lie will change a lot in the next five decades , but , how ill it change ?
On he one hd we have technology .
Technlgy hs developed really as in te last twenty years so it 's xpected to delop the same ay in te next ity yars .
Cell phones are a gret exampl of this volution .
Fifteen ears ago cell phones did n't hve msic or a mera , while nowadays they have cmra with hig definiton and you ca download a o of music .
On he other hand we have transport .
ight nw people ar strtng to buy hydraulc cars hich is more o friendly d eaper beause you do n't ed to spend money in as .
Bsng on ths we n asme that ts kind of ca ill be the only ones on the strees ffty yea rm ow .
Science wll lo change .
Eey aspect of science wil evve , r exmple w medical discveries ll be made by dctors .
Chmitry my ave th chce in the nxt fty year to confrm their thories about th exisence of atoms .
To sum up I believe that people lives il chane a lot because eerything wll evolve .
I 'm a teengers nd I ie to wach movies as oter tenagers .
My fvourite knd are coedis , detective d love stories .
I motly like comeies because ty create my mo pu me in high spirites .
They help me to develop a to see the wold to a dfent perspetiv .
People like to wtch movies , because it 's a fun pastime and it substitutes books for la people .
Many people thnk living in te counrtyside provds a better way of life .
ot of us tink it 's a reat idea , b is it better than ou cofrtable lif in the ci ?
Would we live etter without technolog ?
As we kn th counryside a no pollution cmpare to big owns , bcase tre are n't cs , lorries , mpe or any othr motor vehice .
If we livd there , we would t healthier food wt no chemicals , wt it 's go .
On e other , hnd technology mkes our lf easier .
We ca et information , ha wt friends or en order food instantly with Internet , hower unfortunately we do n't av it in he countryside
I are with popl who thin hy would hve no problem to leave tei lives n str a n jo in a fam only to be in touch with nture .
However I think humans have eolved and we r very hpy wit technology nd Internet .
There is no doubt ha usn yor pivat car is muh oe comfortable & convenien f any persn .
ur cr represents a kind of uxury & comfort hich is clearly illustrated during drivin or travellig o log distaces as lon as you hve a comfortable st wth a certain persol zne aea .
oreover , u can cntol ur driving speed as ft or slow according to yor od and so you o your time .
In addition to that , you ca take some es aids the jouney .
Even after yor rrivl , o will hae your own cr to go hr & thre fleetly & freely whenever you lie so you have a flexble schede .
Furthermor , you are not accompanied by se lly passengers or dificlt perss urng our trp as you wl rels your trip with some adorable friens , nie family 's members or close colleagues that you ave chosn .
Besde t presence of a r during a tr is very important r coping with h different coditions envirnment u re facig during e journey .
On the other hnd , public trnsport n bome on hygienic as lots of eople re rowded in a small and loed aea and so a l of breathe & air droplets are easily propagated in his encsed pae n consequently , yo are or suceptible to te varus cntgious diseases especially in th winer season whre the respiratory trt inections lorish e.g. cold & u .
Furthermore , your actions and movements are lmited by the chedule and the track of he transportation mean you are taking .
And so you do n't ow your ime to do at yu wt whenever u lie although this is my leisure , my fee time which means the time of relaxation & meditation .
No More alarms or nois alerts a required drin this imporan nd nic eiod of time .
My ow is one of th ceaest owns in my cotry , the authoities ve be arranged am procedures to ensure ta the on keeps clean at h same ti be evironmetally friendly procedures .
As a rst stp to ke the environment cean and althy is that te garbage needs to be separated int 3 parts tt is h the environmet deprtment decided to ge each house tre eccle bs , o or oo and gree grbae , e for only pers and catroon and the ls is o te rest .
Anohe handy le has been decided wich is te pasti and t gases need to be thrw in differn bins at are avalable for the public udsae in each supermarket center , in thse people a find these bi in easy detination available everywhe .
Al the previu stes and ore r being applied by my wn sitizens in order to improve the environment qualty and go long wih al the rocedures that ep he live happily healthy le .
There huld be a fuue for public transport .
It is more imprtnt tn ever for anyone to tin befor using own cr .
irsly , we have a big ssue on lobal armng . We can no deny that we have re an ore xtrme eaher around the glove e to green house gases .
We are damaging ur pane .
Secondly , we all kw t fssil fuels , we aily run our vehicles by , will not st forver .
We e using up our vital rsouce in fst pc .
We a sd to jut turn the lights or air - conditioning on when we do n't really need it .
It is exactly the sam for driving cas .
A l of us , just urn te ngne of our cars without considering alkin up to the bs stop .
Publc transpot syte in the UK has so many prolems to solve .
The fare is high compared to other European countries an the fare system is compliced .
Th punctualty of rains needs to improved greatly , too .
In my opiion , we need to ave fuur fo public trasort for o futre a it is vial to redc the u of private cars . Travelling by cr is oe convenient but with imprved ubic transpot , we need to edce use of cars .
at is or esponsibilty f future generatin .

' Gravity ' is an otstanding , brilliant , i - fi film , directed by Afonso Cuaron , sarrig Gerg Clooney ad Snra Bllock .
This azing film is about two people fr a crew of astronauts st t in sae to launch t ' HUBBLE ' telescope .
Son one of them w informed that an asteroid hit a satellite and created debrs , which a heading or t Shttle , where the two astrnauts were .
Evenually the debris hit the Shuttle a thus mor debr s created which took the rbt of Eah and moved aroun it wth a vey high speed .
The damges whih h impact of the debris cuse to Shuttle were catasrophi !
All of t rew bu tw were killed .
To survive he astronauts had to get to the Internaional Space Station which wa very far wy fo hm .
Moving to the ISS one of tem ost his life and so on one of the crew remains alive figtig r h survivl .
After h long sequence of events the remanin asronaut frst got to t ISS then wih Rusian pacekraft moved on to the Chinese space tatio calld TIAGONG .
Ad so the astrnaut launched the escape od and got ome !
er stuggle for urival occurs to be successful !
" Gravity " is indeed a great ilm nd moreover , I myself recommend it to you , stuents .
My hmeown , Piliyandl , is pobably t smallest town in Colombo ditict rvides helter for mr than 00,00 people .
The town ha approximately 15 vllags and al of them ar goveed by he urban cocil .
T Garbage contro serice is on of the main supporting subsidiaris of th urban council which was founded two years ago .
iv years ago , the tow di n't ave any garbage control services to manage the dmesti rubbish .
With this garbage ontro system , houshol wate beig ollecte on eekl basis an transprted to recycing enters .
The recyclin centers sort tee grbag d a u into different categories to be ecycld , categorized garbage are then transorted to the recycling procss in t narst factory .
o years ago , te couni tarted a wastebasket distibuting program among th villages wth te inteton of esing e garbage collection process .
Wit this aproach , it is ery convenient or the workers wh are engaged in the garbag control service because hy an colect all the garbage of a vlage in o place .
Meanwhile , e urban council highly iscourae the se of plastic products a other artiiial mtrials for e ae of our w cleanliness .
Villgs on the other hand , doing their est to reduce h ld of domesic aste .
Nowadays lts of peole are iscussing the problems of life in t next 50 yes . in 50 years ,
surely , science a technoogy will
progress , and th could ha se pros and cons .
I think tt in 50 years te pulic transport wll be more efficient .
plaes , train and bes wl be fser and mbe tanks to the prgress of technoloy we could beam - up every where .
ls anks to the progress of medcine we wl aceve ome important goas .
dotos wl be able to ue al lethal diseases .
This will be a great achievement !
oy - ommunicatio , f example , wil le is iportanc . all e communication will be vital , pope wi speak nl on social networks .
I thnk that this will be damati ! also a reationships and frendships will be irual , and tat is aburd .
we wil become robots , no longer people !

Athough he two mvis are of coplet dffernt genres , similarities still exist .
The stories of Stephanie an Ali in Rust and Bone , and Pat and Tiffy in the Silverlinings Playbook ll began with their livs goin through if - aterng eent .
In Rust and oes , Stephanie injurs herself in a brl outsd of a club d wakes up to reize he ha her legs amputad .
li , an uemployed fath in his i-20s who is struggling to ae ends meet and support his oung s , saves Stpanie and helps her get back on her fet .
As tey support each other through thr hardships , love sem .
Smiarly , P and Tifay were so going thrugh hard tes whn the ist met .
Pat d jt oten ut of reab for biplar isorer weeas Tiffany , a widow , who had just ls her job .
Once again , their relationship ega as friend and transforms into love as they help ach the conue persoal chllenges .
In m , both movies portrayed oe as a ceistry reaction tht stems o when two people willing to help ech oher ou of life challenges .
In th mvie of Rut and Bone , Ali akes Sephnie going out and swiming , even has sex wt her , helpng Stephanie to restore her if .
On the other hand , after A sart hs kickboxing arer , Stepnie always caes about h onditios , ten becomes his middleman .
Same as Rus d Bon , in the mie of Silvr Linings Plbook , Pat comanis wt iffay to break away fro h pt ; and Tifay help Pat to get te courage to id te wa bk into lov .
All ty want to do is to rpai th lov menings and find happness in their life .
ot the ovies lad happy edings to the lads .
In t e of Rust n oe , Stephanie is bk to h fe because of Al 's support .
l ealizes he oves Stephanie an he wo n't be he mn he sed to be anymore , ho do n't belee in oe and only wat n night stand .
Ad in Silver Lnngs Plybook , at and Tiffany , ho both ed to stuc in teir misfortne in h pass , leave thir ss behind and mo on with ech oter 's lv and upport .
is t moies give us a cocet : no mtter how wors e lis r , love can mak pple bave d find out the value of lives agan .
Albeit tos things in common , at the beginning of th movies , t depression of chrcters cme from different siuatin .
Pa nd iffan ar trapped in ter psycologically difficulties ; Pat 's desr of is ex - wif can no be fulfilld , while Tiffany can not get over her guilty of h usand 's death .
However , characters in Rust and Bone are suffering rom declned lf uality ; Stephanie lst e legs , n Ali is an imecunius n .
Althoug their hearts a all empty , h hash environent is moe hard to urvve .
In ddiion , loe is portrayed in dfferent ways in these two movies .
Sier inngs Playbook , as a Hollywood movi , describes te love story in a hilarious te .
Th sce is bright and h rhythm is ligh even if in te addest section .
Rust nd Bone , on the oher hand , presents stor in a reistic way .
h director does not avod rutal scee becaus those are exactl pts of ea lif .
In oncluson , every ove movie m be interpreted in dverse wa , whras people cul always fid distinct inspiaion .
In my opinion , being ncluded in h fresh TV news is a he contribution , grea oportnity to introduce yourself in the way you lik it .
It is possible to find many examples whic conims th argument .
In these times , we can folo sbd 's Twittr esfeed , ' li ' his Faceboog fnpage and , of course , follow nw abou those famous pepe .
They 're ben followed contantly by paparazzi , hei pivate potos are beig bought f millions of dollars .
Of cours bei in a simiar ituaion does n't seem to be easy t I think ta it is e of the prices of being fmous .
We should n't underestimate he iportance of societal and environmental problems .
Th both ms be soled ecause of thi great negative influence on the world .
On t o nd , I think ta the ost significant is soceta problems becue hey cause other prbems including eviromental one .
Pele alay u atre and i resources to satisfy the needs .
Hwver , peopl hve exploited e nature sine h last century .
Ter activities causd ls of negative conseuences such as ar , waer and and pollution , deforestation and clite change .
These issues are so burning in developing countries .
Wereas devoped cuntris became aware of hese problms , por coutries hve plty of ocetal problms , so they ontinue to inflece he envirnmen in a negative wa .
hat 's h I consier that societal isus r the most dangrous .
r exapl , developing countries can not protct the environment because of ter povery , lo icoes , an populaion illieracy .
On h the hand , sometimes environmental rolems can be a reason for societal one .
It ok lace when some natural disastrs happened .
Sh diaster as earthquaks , flod and tornados affect a lt of pepl every year .
It has an unwllig impact on society as popl ar forced to save their lves , leave or renovate ther houses , ook for clothes , food an othrs .
Unfortunately , we an not pretend natural disaster , but we can solve societal proles .
In my opinion , t main decision is to deelop pepl 's ptential , inrese their awareness of persoal effects on nature .
If people take responiblity for heir cions , we will avoid plenty of consequences .
As for me , we can aceve thi tough eveloping leadershi .
We must ave strg lades wh il strive f a bautful world .
People ca n't satisfy their limiles neds ; they think only abt their ealt .
A od leader must form a sociy , show an example an provide better alus for people .
He us insire others to achieve appropriate oas and to do their bst r the world .
In my oganization , we strie for peae in the world .
We beleve that we cn develop leadeship in each pern and uh ways we can avod a lot of global problems .
Tis exchange rogram will give me t required knowledge that I can use effetively to evelo Ukrainian society .
Sometimes I have an opportunity and eire to do something whereas I do n't kw w to do it rperly .
I hope tis interntional eperience wil teac me how to work on increasing cuntr welfare .
Thogh the ew problems ocur quickly in our state some peope and commnity , ry to do teir est to develop e civil nd democrtic siety .
We ed eternl hel to find o w to cope with th societal and environment problms .
Moreover , our cutry pas little attention to them so populatio houl do verything on tir w .
For instance , I hope I will be able to get to know evrything aout recyclin rubish and economizg nerg .
Tese skill e necessary fo us , and they hp us to improve a little ur ecological situation .
In cocluion , each problem mt be solved cocening socieal nd environmental isses ha mpde a further progress of our civilizatin .
What is mor , tis project wil ve me availble eperience including spcifi skills ha I can s to sprad healthy tendency in he social phre and careful atitude to the environet .
Television a entrtin everybody toy , it does n't matter he age , can be a baby or an oldet ersn , we can otie tat there are intrestig topics for a kinds of audienc .
It 's a multimedia evice th whle u wath TV , you can listen an see other peole or cartos , and it seem the characters ar alie talking directly to u .
Today th networks he a schedule of 24 hours of activitie , ou a watc e programs at ny time you want to , a if yu do n't like a proram y can change the channel and watch anything els , if th crease of channls and the competiveness , th adince has incrasd al its pwer of hoic .
We he the owe to choose at we want , t wh so man optons we must be awre of or o decisions , I at to say hat , although we have so my optons , not all of em are effective fr us , we are ab to dcid if we 'd rthr se a comedy or a dcumentary .
The prrams tend to eproduce our real life a our desies , such as a soap opea ich presets chraters wh difficult in their lives , u there are also the soluion of ll problem at h end , the ady get marred and live happy wth hs love orver .
Althoug he have a nice ending we need to rmember that the real lif is different nd th diffcul makes art of our lie , they a there to us to ve value to veything we have ad to remmbr us how ragile and , at the same tim , how powerful we are .
We can aso watch a documentar that teh us a lot !
There are documentaries produced with so ma careful at the rovide us with a ot of inormatin , sometimes it 's ch beter th eading a bo or hving a css .

How does Shakespae mae ' A Midsummer Night 's Dream ' mical ?
In ' A Midsummer iht 's Dram ' Shakepeare crates a magical od n settin by usig charactrs , sc as the airies , and vent ( such as trnsformng Botom 's ead into a donkey 's he ) .
Te se and misue of magi of mic play a ital role in ' A idsummer ight 's Dream ' .
Each character in hs play , who is able to do magc , uses it in a different ay , f example : to help ; for teir n ned .
T good s of magic is en Obrn use ' love in idlness ' to mak or rather " fre " Demtrius to al in oe with Helna .
He uses it to hep e ad y to solv t proles in the loves relatin ship as Lysander and Demetrius are in loe with Hermia consequenly Helena in love with Demetrius .
It 's alost a love triangle !
h misuse of agic is wen it causes an argument beteen th Athnians .
As ck misakes Lysande for Deetius n squeezes h potion into s eye , e whol onflct begins .
Ts whole isute cold hve ben avoided if o for Puck 's mistake .
Hweer , jst as maic cused this chos , it als resolve in it .
Withut e misue of magc , th plot would n't be he same .
There 's be no humour to make it intesting .
In his play , th fairies are almost ike the eart of the book .
It is because of te magic of the fairies , h action in hi book is ik a dream .
The fairies nearly control evrything .
e weater chngs due to Obero n Titania 's argument , which mkes ' contagious fog'(2:1:90 ) an ' hoary - headed frosts'(2:1:107 ) .
e faiis lo affet nature as Oeron 's n Titan 's dispute results in t wind ' piping ' to them in ' va'(2:1:88 ) .
D to having fairies as charater , it dds magic as fairies do n't exist in h human world .
It creates unreality an fantasy .
The beauiful language of te fairies ( verse ) kes us away from the odinary human world ta usually talk in pro .
T faiies ' magic is built by h contrast of the liv of e firies and " mortal " .
As a reoccurng thee , uck 's use of magc creates humour , conlic ad balanc in te play .
Puck 's magic also dd to hi naughty , cheeky , ttrctive character in tis play .
The maic of turnig Botom 's head into one of an ass ' , ads more humur to already the sef - confident character of Bottom .
Ti lso leads to mr huour as itania alls in love with Botom and calls him h ' wee love'(4:3:30 ) .
It als cretes the cmpaison of Titania , a beautiful , delicate creture , whist Bottom is competely groesque .
The idea of itania having a ' flwery bed'(4:1:1 ) and th idea of Bottom , at hat time , looking ' monstros ' and ' tange'(3:1:91 ) creats a distncton .
The image of the elegant faiy uee referrg to a ma wh a donkey ea as her ' lover'(3:2:6 ) sem ridiculous .
Obon 's s of mgc is ainly used to help peole .
As well as for s need , he ues his magc to el ' A weet Athenian ady ' ' in oe'(2:2:260 ) naely Helena with e siuation wih Demetrius in t 2 .
Therefore , he is hown as a sympahetc haractr .
owver , Oberon also uss is magic to et he changeling boy fom Ttania .
When Obeo finds out that Puck has tansformd Bttom 's he into a dnkey 's he , he gets anoyd at first at Puck 's mistake u latr realizes that Titania a fallen in love wh a ' le thing'(2:2:40 ) , a n wth an a ' hd .
In he ook , Titania does n't se to use er magic much , nevertheless , se uses it a w ims .
Titania 's uses hr mag to ' bless'(5:1:383 ) te brie b so that Theseus d Hippyta would ve beautiful children and ive a hpy , marrd lie .
In t book , she is n't sow usin it fo her own ee .
Titani 's fairies ar also chaacters o s agic . They e it to protect her ' fairy queen'(2:2:12 ) from ' spotted skes with ouble tonge ' , ' newts and blindworms'(2:2:9 - 11 ) .
Their magic , like eron , is ued to help people nevertheless n f theselves .
Also , the fairies langag is macal as ms of heir lines are spells a ound as if they we in a fai tae .
h lothe of the fairies and their lives r also magca .
T place where Tiania slees is fl of ' oxlips ' and ' eglntne ' .
She sleeps on a bower a she wns a fan me of wing of uterflies .
The food ty ea ik ' aricocks'(3:1:152 ) and ' mulberries ' ( 3:1:153 ) sun eotic as well as ot being u daily mals or snacks which also shows anothr ontrat btwee the humans ad fairies .
T ruit , us above , als sound like ones that would be found in a foret(bries ) .
The language of e fairies cretes magic by imagery ht is absolutely exquisite .
Most of us prbabl haen't heard of ' oips ' ( 2:2:250 ) nd ' woodbine'(2:2:251 ) .
Even the sound of these to wrds son lke fantasy .
Shakspeare 's choie of words creae thi .
He talks abot ' musk - roses'(2:1:25 ) and ' wild thye'(2:2:2 ) giving us this ige of this beautiful and , wt gren grs and a sorts of flowers .
Ths imge will probably look like where e fairies live or asociate it with a fary tle .
By doing ts , we ben to realize the magi in ti play .
In ' A Misumer ght 's Dream ' thre a may spells , e.g.
Flower of thi pure y ,
Hit it uid 's archery ,
in in ple of h eye .
When h ov he dth spy ,
Lt hr shin as gloriously
As h Venus of the sky .
Wn hu wak'st , if sh be by ,
g of er redy .
OBERO(3:2:0 - 19 )
Te lanuag used in hs spell cotain an references to nature ( ' Vnu ' n ' S ' ) .
This is w it creates agic and creats the sting as in William Shakespeare 's tim , they dd n't u many props .
ut by eding this , y ca maine his faiy king chanting a spell on a purple foer cald ' ve in ilness ' and o can understan Cupid ( the ree d of love ) had blessed this flower ih is arhery , ivng you an understanding ta his is a lo potin .
Shakespeare has also usd metaphors ad simls sch as ' let r shine as gloriously as t Vnus of the sy ' to create the thought ha lena shoul look like a ' goddess , nyh , ' in addition to being ' pfect ' and ' divine'(3:2:13 ) .
He uses ndirec word , e.g. He dos n't jst say love potion .
Shaespeare sys ' Flwer of tis purple dye , Hi ith Cupid 's archery ' causing mystery and letng us hik about hat he eans .
akespeare also uses t idea of magic in i conversations with other charaers for example : when Titaia speak to Obern in 2:1:60 - 4 , s mntions nature ay times .
She rfrs to he Mn as ' the governes of loods'(2:1:1 ) and refrs to the seasons quite a lo .
She describes t witer as ' angry'(2:1:112 ) as Winter is sometimes hught of a miserable seson .
Th faiies ecite their sntnces as if they wre a pem or song . '
Sotted snakes ' and ' Thorny hedeogs'(2:2:9 - 10 ) e references to nimas .
Anmals , insects and plats are commonly eferrd to in ' ' A dsummers Night 's Drem ' d tes descriptions add to te mgic .
It create the sense that e firies hougt ha the animal re dangerous n the way they describe tm gages e reader .
T description of the animals an insects makes hem seem as if hey wee evil spiit to the fairies n spirits are magical .
This play lso rfers to ' slep ' d dreams .
After al e bo is call ' A Midsummers Nght 's ream ' .
Du to he magic , he bizarre ents were interrete as a dea as there 's be no easier ay to make the humas derstand th events tt had js happened .
Thnking of it as a dream creates inocence and vulnerability .
so , the tught of all our lovers avng the ae dream makes it seem strange and magical to them .
lso , Shakespeare uses te thught of ply .
He ad the play ' ramus and Thisbe ' hich is a bit like a mii play bed on e storline ' A Midsummers Nit 's Dem ' as tre are two lovers whose parts do n't permit her marige .
When the ' mechanicals ' or workers change into heir characters , it is a t lie mic .
T characters in the ly like ' moonght ' are baic idea of tranformation lik ones th magi creae .
Also , there is t idea of te alteration of form tht ottom 's had gets ' trnslated'(3:1:104 ) xpresses th magcl feeling tht again his is o possible in he human wod .
Ptios are also sd to show a sense of magc .
In h human rld , th did n't use ells or potions .
At ths tim , the idea of potions mght eem unrealistic ad sly t by reding tis a t events h potion cnjurs creates mai .
The effect th ' love in idleness ' has in the ly , crats the plot n so potion play a main role in the bok .
Without mgc , e pl would n have the same elements of huour .
Also , the asence of magic wold alter the overal pot .
T repetitie hem of maic play a significant rol in the lay .
To summarize my pois , I ersoally thnk tht Shakespere presented mgi in th pa by usig thought uch as trasormations , ells , poions and aspects that do n't xist in t huan wold .
I personally hin , witout mic , th book il n be as pouar or engaging .
Shakesear ha done it gan !

Te cit of Old Thebes
Nwadys os schols and universities are helping students to find their ot suitable jbs .
This is caused by the changes tat the labor arkt has xprimented recently .
Enterprises wnt to recuit young an experienced popl d universities and schools have noiced that so they re hands on the task .
I shall consider two of the proose mthods .
It as be sggsted to ofr " wrk experience programs " .
Stuets il be abl to now deeply their tas as employers .
It sems a brilliant idea not onl becae of h knowledge th hey cuire but fo th expience tht it culd bring them .
om enterprises rquir eerienced employers and if oun peope have it , ey will be more likely to be recruited in the workplace .
So , includng in the CV e experence , seems to me , a stp further in t students ' care .
Another a to encourage tudents to find e prfect o would be courses nd qualificatio .
I entirel share this ia .
Uiversiies are supposed to give thei tudent informatn bout e skills tht a work invlves .Bt omeimes universities gve the more theoretical formatios instead of practical formation whi entepries are searchin .
Generally seaking students finish eir dgres with a imitd rane of experience .
I would herefore rue that he bes y to help students is to ombne a kind of " training " fr thir rk li nd some teoretical knowedge .
They ae to learn th skis that a jo nvolve ad the nly a to get this is practicing .
N a d 's we e having " n " number of Internatoal Sports , whee e c prove her ow talent and ve heir sociaism .
My favorte sport is Badminn because we can have lots of fun hle playing .
he shap of the court is in rcangle and is diidd in half by a et .
he mode of playing a be singl 's or doule 's .
her are six main sots : the serve , he ear , he smash , te rop , the forehand and h backhand .
It 's a god exercise to mak on fit d asy to pl .
The fun in this gme is we ed to dr the shuttleock on t other side of the court and wi 's until th opnent responses to it .
My sgestion for te eole wo wants to start thr oby as badminton , firstly o ne to ow the ules n reguations of the pay .
As it 's a mind set gae , the player need to fcs on th weaknesse and t accordingly .
To be a succssful playr oe has to learn so tricks , which elps ther game asier .
An la but t least as a laer one as to keep in mind at , they should ot get deprssed wh they fe tht their game is oin out of her hands , wre inste of that one a to fight nti te last min of the ge in order to decid whether the plyer is winner or loser .
Thus by booing themsels ad to success .

CONCLUSION
If you love the cinema or if you ol wat to tae a brea in your dil rotine and meet new people and mae ew riends you ca n't lose this rea pportunity to turn a gey Monday into an amzing start of e wk .
oe peope argu that , when e weekend is coming the wnder wht to do just for oe day!The would like to have a rt .

So , where to go ? What to do ?
I 'm uggeting ou choose bewen to different places : bea or mountain .
If you prefer to go to t beac b you are no se what to do the , here e some special ideas to consider .
Fisrt of a , rmembe to take food that an be ean easily without much es ( pnish omelette , fried chicken brest , sandwiches , sip ... ) n , moreover , you an b some drinks ad water eause it is n to eat at the beach nd people usually get ngry often after they do smehing like swmming , jumping the waves , srfng a so on .
layig in the sand bying pepe one another or making sandasles might be a great ay to send a da outdors .
Neertheess , if u do n't like sand at l , yu can hoose the other optio in he mountai .
It could be a differen ay to spnd a uiet day in a peceful , plci and restful pace .
Furthermore , gong on a hk mog trees wit a cool breeze around yu can be te knd of place that allows you to forget h bus ciy life , though .
Theereore , hch one of these t paces woud you hoose ?
In my opiion , no matter where you go , just take your camer and take photos in order to be able to remember hat wonderful , amazig ven unforgettable ment .
At he e , the ost impotant thing is to have and enjoy a elaing time .
Purpo

Th second step is to identify what I oul caus h sleep isorder .
En if you have a dorder , yes I can identify fctor that a inrrupt my sleep .
The eading spch of many , bu wth whom I idetify most is caffine efre sleeping and eatng heavy beoe bedtie .

My favourite sport .

Swimmg is my favourite sport .
I practise it evry ay in my chool .

Sm pele think her is no future for pulc transport , ecause travelling by r is so muc or convenient .
Cars actually hv my adantages .
wever , it doe n't mean the public transport hav to disappear .
The main reason to consider there is future for public transport is that , acordig to ecolgists , we must t dow t massive use of cars .
The pollution level is me and more increased by this ecessiv u .
Then , the ublic transport is needed to void me problems in h atosphre an ve the planet .
What 's mr , not only icreases it the polluton , u ls turs ou to be dngeros for u sense of hearing .
In addition , I tin th public transport is a necessary ervce which we should hae access to .
Eeyone ca n't afford a ar or , for a reason , are n't able to drive one .
Therefore , it is too importnt to go on with a public transot business ow and in the future .
In conclusion , from my poit of ve , people fro a over the world uld rater travel by r ha travel by pblic transport bt we 'd beter u hs means of ransort if we wat to ontine lving in accurate conditions .
Dear Mr .

Thank fo you kind understanding
Due to tre will be an international fesival for young people in our region , I hv witen that report in order to know the preernces of the a he teds wic a on nowadays .
Firstly , I he asked but the msic ta is listned to ad about the favourites styles ad rups and e results show us tat te r n't simiar compared to musc ty likd a w ears ago .
In fact , they hardl eer can efned themselves such as pop fn , rockers , ...
In addion , plty of girls wo were interviwe old th could n't stnd regaeton msic , owevr hey usd to want to listen to it in discos becaue they culd danc .
In my opinion , young people do n't have musical clture and magnificent and of music ke Rolling Sone are going to have remaining in te oblivion .
Secdly , I debated ith oun people to television programes that are watchd currently .
Most peopl prefer to wth reality programmes where people hve to live ith unknown eope in ordr to gossip abt them .
However , the ocumtaries ae big forgotten nd only a twenty - i percnt of the wld like watching more ineesting TV series like Lost .
Morover , ll of thm choose wthing TV against reading a boo as fir oion .
Finally , I also tled bou th clohes they usually ear .
It is aid that you are tht you are wearng but in ti rept , we n chec that it is not certain .
Actual , in opposition to t usc , yung eple feel that they can reveal heir behaviour and hei haractr by wich the clothes r being wr .
Nowadays , al peple use te Internet and aplicatio everywhere .
oreover , it is very sy to ake friends and communicated with someod .
Firs of all , taks to the intrne you an meet or talk to pope even if no by your sie .
In adtion , it 's easier to talk th someone tat you do n't meet and yu want it .
Furthermore , if you are a y pson , this a is very seful or you because you n tak ore drectl with someone .
Secndy , if you us e Internet to meeting nw people , it 's a good ay to finding peoe wih simiar iterest . Yu ca enter pplicaion and y can epain hw you look lik d someone is interested in yo .
Finaly , I think that tanks to the internet you ca tk with somne who live in Jpan , u oftn you sp talking ith smeone who is ors front .
In concusio , I 'm age that nteret it 's a ood way to meeing frien because u can know a lot of ople around he wld .
The stateet - ' There is no future fr public tansport , bcause travlling by car is so much oe convenient . ' can be discussed in two different aspects .
ne ay of using transport is to dily travel to wr within e cy , othe w is to use it when you are visiting yu rinds or family outside the city .
The have been god progrs in transport in bot e spects .
Transport has ecome faster and mre convenient , n it can be attribued to t of factor such as btter roas , nw technolois an inovatins etc .
People who ravl diy to wok , usualy prefer public ransport over o car as it is a cheaper option .
Also , as public transort such as meto do not nee to fe traffic , it is lays aste w to reach office .
On h other hand if I would be travelling to see my frends or family in eaby ton or just on holiday to , I wod reer my r .
If o are travelling in you car , it give you flexiblity to choose an way to reach your destinaion , you can ma any number of stppage , an eve stop for or favorte ice crem .
In futue ; environment will alo ecome a key factor in determnig the tate of hse transot medums .
Cuntris toay re trying to reduce ther carbo footprints , they a trying to encourage public transport .
This iniative ill surely help countries to rdue polution .
I think education is on of the most important thing for everyone .
In my opinion , it is , probably , e base of te values of every societ cause o chidren frm now wi be he n or women of the future .
In Span the vast mayoit of schools a stae schools .
This is the reason for the government decsins of ducaton play an essenial role . I ha always tught that it should be reace fr all .
I studied in a state shol and I belive that I t a go educatio n only acdemic training ut also strong principls to liv in ociety .
Th inteet and social networks ae ivoled a g change in our knowledge and behaviou front to he wld .
ro my point of view I fel like we are losing things so imprtant as the effort to rach goa or respectful everyone .
Nowadays , we ar living in a lobal world a we ut lean ow to ie together erefore the educati is the nl way to achieve it .
For instace , knowing oter langage , like English is increasingly d a day .
To s up , education is , in my opinon , te most important base of any soety and it shol be eached whole eope .
No doubt eple need to move fom a place to an other .
There are may reasons for travelling , d to travel fr n place to an ohr people s diferen meas .
thre ae variet of transpor mean .
ome are private nd om are pblic .
Public transport means uh are trains , planes a buses ae now as t mst cheap ad used by al travelers , nd the cost of using hem is something that sit h people who ean not so uch money .
Whre as the rivat mns sc as crs and smll planes are know as t os expensive .
ey cost to much to n them , and to run he .
Their ul a kits are athe xpensive .
The er of the transprts mean are differ , the ubic ons are ae to cary b umer of trvelrs , wher as th private means used by very lttle nuber of people .
This option ay be apied on the cargo lo .
becase the pblic means of ransport can car a ot , and tis help to move cares to very where ih l coast .
Al these points are spprt the importance of he public tanport men , and ensur h useul hy are .
In my view , the public transport wl keep on offering their sevces , and wll neer be effected by e appearance of private means .

Doing spots or ust wathing them ?
Nowada there e ma eople w practis pots , bu other people refer jus wacing tem .
On t o hand , ding pots alow you to hve a healthier life .
Mot doctor recommend doin this .
Doing spors is a od way to forget abot real life , y focus on the cmpetitin nd is ike to have a rs fro e cotidian ife .
On the other an , doing sors is ealth , despite the ft tha there are ris port hat c ause several health problems an oud ead you to deat , ny watching sports seems safer .
In conclusion , peronall despite the dger of some sports , dong sprts is by far better than just sit in your hous and watcing them .

The last film i saw was called " The oths " altough is o a recent fm .
Th film is a horror movie which tes th tory of a rch fmily who lived in an old mason in an abandoned island after the second world wa .
he poblem abu this mansion is tha the sae hids a lot of secrets and misteries which re going to be discoered by its temporary owners who e a faml whose husband wnt to war n died so t real cupans of e ouse e nicols , an easily scre bo , his sster nne who tun to be one of the st impoant character of e flm and hei mother who is called race and a a particuar obsession for caholsism .
Th other charctrs that also take an important part in h ovie ae the servants .
Bertha / mr.tuttle and the te girl ldy w lso hides a lot of ecrets .
e fim decrivs h the oe ha a mother can give to er cldren n easlily tun into an obsession.howee,at mak hi flm so special is ht tht pretends to be a typica horor move but at ts fal scene the is a suddenly change ich turn it mr interesing .
It was made in he right place fo such an unexpcted fil as it was made in a i manor on an abandone fog isld .
I would recomend this film to anyone , eve tose who re eaiy scared sced because it is t as th esto of horor oves , it is a fil in hih yo are cotinuey discovring serets as if yu where anoher hracter .
You wll have a reat time
Public trasort s developed for pope wo were poor nd could not afrd thi w tansport .
Public tansport is he vhicle fr passenger who ca tave from one place to another in ls mey .
At fist this transport as appreciated marvelously .
Everyone el so elighted but unfortunately w eople feels uncomforable when it comes to travel via public transport .
In eary as of ubic transprt , people were on stick to thr normal routine nd dd not wih to earn mor frm heir job or ok .
Today ver sige pern is curiu to ear money as much as hey n nd the interesting art is that this criosity is increasing da by day so is their income .
So no alost 80 percent people c afor their own transpor .
As peple eel comfotable in there own vehicle .
he main advatage of havig your wn transport is tt o do not he to wit or he pulic transport , you can save your tm as ou ony need to accelerate your w transport and die to ou destinton .
Public Transport is sl nw , even though they re very comfortable t unfortunately people feel public tranpot is for poor people and if any middle cas or upper class wol tavl trugh publi transport it oud afct h rspet .
But still there re so many people wh use public transport frequently b tat is only ther compulsion and povety .
When th would be financily stable ty uld surly uy their own veicl .
So in my opinion I gree with th statement tht there is no uure of public transport .
It is a well known fact that transport is qite related with poution .
Th humed fumes are n of the grea problem r the envronmen .
So hat it is a ueston tha required a deeper reflexion r ll of us .
Wheter plic transport might be t solution , or be mor adecate or ot , it is something with aguments in fvour and agaist .
Firsl , many people think public transport ha not uture because travelling by car is faster d more independent .
ou do nt to wait f a speiic tim to cath te bu , o example .
Secondly , eple thnk uing a car is a cheaper option in long tem than tralling by public trasport every d .
However , a lot of pople r becaming mo and mre coscincious about h imortant tavlling by public transport is .
n of the mos iprtant reasons is precisily to take ca of th environment .
Using ubic tranprt reduce te polutin .
hat is ore , when we speak about pollution we are no only talking aou exhumes fums .
We ls speak abot nose .
I am ve happy with te ie to encourage the public tranport 's s u to ak the ities a better place to ve .
If everyone travelled by bus , citis wou be a quite differt th ones we know no .
Dear aul ,
To tl o the truth aot the concert , I id n't think ht it wul be coo ut it was !
I really likd to work with special efect and e best ting tht I leart a o abot hat ehnology .
I 'm looking forar to hearn from you !

Publi transportation is the st opula mthod in travelling to places .
These transportatio ca be easily foun nywhre to reac your destination .
On e thr nd , travelling by ca is more convenient nd safe .
Travelling by car is preferred by some pople ecaue of s convenience and advaages .
For eample , ai bags have en tested to nsue the safty of h passenger and the driver .
In addition to this , we would o take to muc ime in oking for a s which wuld go secificall to ur destination .
But we can not ny te ft at pulic transportation has been around in eas n in ver country as a men of travel .
Most of the peop prefer this ki of transprt , especial those who can ot afford to u a c .
Also , this is the heapst w to get to yu prferre locaon .
I disagree that her is no futur r public transportation as it is still widely used all over te world .
Moreover , this h lped a lot of peole epeially those who an o afford to buy a car .
Howeve , public trnspotation in h futur might be imroved and developed an will still be used by ny people .
Th side efect of depending onl on cr as he in transportation a earkable .
we shuld ncourge public transportation ll we a becaus ver cty now ha hg number of cars u on it 's stret an this umer is going up speedy .hing ts huge inreasing of cars that ill impact badly in public health & environet and infrastructure .
It is mre convenient with moden liestyle to tavel with a car because of the privacy and independently.te remarkable develpmen of c 's uxury and more option .
although it will be ver cost in fl , a service nd effort of concentrion on dring all of his negatiity you can avid it easily by using blic transportation , it shou be cheper than ing yor own car you do n have to lk afer it you a do actvitis wail u e on it like reading or chting with yur friends or having mortant phone ca
e environment impat is an important factor we should consider , having this number of cars lk having thousads of factories in our streets givn us tans of CO2 gs ad ny the pollton ses.he eed e tan or plns or ev buses ow competing ite car 's peed and even more fat ha it in a lot of aces .
Usng pubi trnsporttion is better thn use individual cas , but we shold put ore attractive this inside it and hould ve nw designs nd more privacy nd luxury eans , expanding in electric c and other clea enrg is very important ght n to rduce enironment 's plluton as far as we can .

Dea i / Madam ,
I am writing his letter ecause I am concerned but facilities f shopprs in or aa .
First of ll , I hv to admit I am addicted to shopping n I rally like that there is such an exensiv shoppig area in o ton .
I apprciate also tht it is located near to h osing tate .
Unfortnaely , I thk there are some sects that demand improvements .
In my opinio arkin charges e too high .
Furthermore , th hopping rea lacs restauras and entertainment facilities .
Peoe uualy become hungry ater shopping , so opening eatng places in this area ould be ve beneficial .
In ddiion , h hops arrangemet is actually ry mesy d finding the store I need is hard .
I wld like to popose some solutions , as well .
h prking shuld be fe of chargs , it would attract moe people a incease the income overall .
Moreover , yo huld hane th arrangement of shops nd divide the whole area to ertain sectns ( e.g. cloths , fd , and ose ) .
Fially , opening restaurants th dferent types of food and entertainment acilities like moi theatre and gyms should be considered .
Your ithfully ,
XYZ
My favourte sport is undobtedy joggng .
I am ver luky bease o far from my ome there ar thre parks so I can pactise this spt enever I want .
Usually I jog thre ay a week and , onestly , I could n't do without !
Running in cntat with nature allows me to rlx ftr work and recarge my energies .
ne finished my trining , I go home , ta a shower n ... I fel lik a new won ! !
My adce for those people who want to take up this sport is to start gradually .
The can begin to jog for 15 minutes and tn ncreasng the time so ht thi body a et used to h mucular effort .
Furthermore , it wuld be uful having a chronometer to check ou your imrvement .
I wod aso rcmmend to stretch atr every wok out to avoid any kind of musculr pain .
If you prefer , yo can substitte stetcing with ew yoga exerciss as el .
Good jogging ! !
Ang young eople exist a tatemen tht shoppng is alway an enjoyabe a to spend your fe time .
Personally I am not completely aree with this way of thinking .
On the oe ad , if y have ney nd a lot of free ie you ca spend al d dodging in the mall for onl one , pecia kind of skirt or pair of jeans .
But if you do not hv money , rices can only etroy your dy becase u knw tht yo can nt afford it .
The prices in the shops often e very high and clothes r not good qualitatively .
d whn o want to buy smething in ler price , you need to go to t mall when there ar seasoal sales .
But then everyboy goe crazy , you need to crowd thouh the mob , argue with another person for one , special ir of hes in your ize .
For me it is only a torure .
Also you a be robbed ecaue in croded plcs you can easly fal prey to pickpockets .
Otherwise you need to have time to wak through all h shos n fnd what you ned , every ting on h rc is calling fr ou attentio , after a whl u want to uy eerything .
On th otr had if ou fn a real bargain an buy soething in very low price , yu will be hapy and ontent r he res of the d .
Bt in my ce , it happen raely .
Soe people do no nt to bu tigs by network because he wa to tr on for exape lotes .
For me it is t necesary because every eller giv t siz of his product and then I can check if this thi ill be good f me or no .
Als o ca alway retun it like in te sttioner toes .
Summing I refe doing my shopping by mns of webide or aucton portals .
There I c eily fi at interets me , hat is in my siz etc .
For me it is easier n faser way to buy what I wt , oten in better price .
h diagrams ilustrates the process of mkng bak notes .
e fist sp is dsign hih includes backgound colr , artwork and security ssus .
Ten ove to he nt step , prparatin of metl plates , wile skilled machinits is needed in tis process .
riting is quite relted to the irs two steps beause t esign nd siled mchnists huld both be cosiered .
And wh the shet of bk ots ar being prted , colour on both sides , pecil ink a sightl rie ima should on the bank note .
The most mportant step is inspection , where pritd shet should be inpeced manually d caefully .
It divides sht of bnk not nt tre type , whic re od ualty sheets , arially damaged sets or bank note separated ito good and bad and bad shees .
oever , the is a big diferenc between hese thre tps .
If e qualit of seets and bank otes r god , then he wl be pckage a distributed .
Conversely , b heets and bank notes will be estroed .

I want to tell you abou the cncert in my school , it wa realy oo .

T couse is oing to finish so the teacher want that we go out to a restaurant .
Th choice was n't easy becase t acher is vegetaria .
At last we decid to go to a restaurant near te school .
The owns co ll tpes of cuisin an we can go the after the lesson .
h atmosphere is kind nd failia .
T prices e no expesiv nd foods e vy good .
There are not many tables , but we are only seven peple and this is n't a proble .
There is also a rden otdoor where we can spend a leasant ime together afte lunch .
We will go there next Moda .
I have boed a table for eight peole because u bss will come too .
We will e a legume su as sta , a boile fsh with gre salad as main coure and a dessert at the en .

We re going to pay 15 euros pr persn .
I think it ill be a wnderful wy to finish ou English oure wee we ve suely mprovd in riting , speaking a itening .
Thereore I wnt to say a special tanksiving to u teher .
In my area , ong popl have a t of optns .
I see most of them lik to stay at he arden downtw during the afternoon when he wther is good .
If the weather is n't good enough they n find a lot of cafes opened from mornig unti late night nd hr , if hy are ol enough th cn als order alcholics .
Tere e many knds of cafes , th ones for thos who like srts , art , lierature or music .
At te " Soft Nos " y can ear mic lyed ve every Friday n Sunday evening .

The st rated restaurant is " Mrio 's Pzza " , whre you can eat delicious pzz with h tp ou prefer .
While waiting fr it , yu ca lay with video games placed in he aement .
Nwadays the tp of transport that ou use is a concerning matter of discussion .
ubic trnspot nclue buses , trains , ad subway , however cars , bicyles , taxis are not forgotten .
In the ment of choosing , vry diffrent apets li eolgical effects , t ecnoic iabilty and even time use , te part on the decisio .
Firstly , the c opon is th best oe in comfort , beause u do t depend on a specific tim to travel and odern crs hav th best technology in quiment d facilities .
Thn pubc transport is not as comfortable as the prvious n , becuse luckily o ca id a ace to sit and foget it if it is in he uh hu .
By h other hand , traffic is the biggest troule talking abo transport , rs acilities e replaced by the nd of punctuality and , dependn on th ct , the dlays are a conening poi when we talk about travelling by us or trais .
However , he economic asect is vey important to conser when we alk aout onvenienc , cars e he most expensive ones .
No only bcase of h oil'ices , b al the css of enssurance , e car , the parking taxes , etc .
In comparisson with a bus ticket tha costs four peo a you r sur ta sooer or ater it will come .
To um - up , ether car nor public transport is conidered he pefect option , but coniering long term consequences as is nowadays common in se European countres , bicycles r t best wy .
Riding a bicycle redces traffic , sts , eclogical impact , and ev car crushes .
So , wat are o aitig to buy a bcycl and u a helmet on ?

Many people think that th first impression we ie and our appearce are ver important in o lfe ; bu , it should be lk ti ?
It is ceainly ru tha people a very riti wth the apperance .
We have sbjetive opinions ; we normally judge becaus we hae a preconcepion idea .
We match cloth stile with a lifetle an a personaliy .
That is why appearance shuld t have conequences in r lives .
ot people ould gre hat fshio is something that takes part in o d to day .
Normally , people cooe clths that famous wear or appear in h magazines .
owevr , thre a people who do t foll that , d hey dres e most comfortable clohes o hm or h ste they ike most .
I thn tat tre are many differnt occsons , a eac o euires a different type of clothes .
For exampl , in work intrwies n work that ve a dire contact wit e publi it is bett to se a for or smrt style .
d same hpened with parties , festivals , prts and ohr ents .
Overall , my personal pni√≥n is that we give so much importance to he clothes n t appeaanc thn it shuld be .
Although in some occasions sme clothes syls re required , peope should he redom to chooe what clothesd they wa to ar , and it should not have conseqenes in u lif .
The deah of h pulic transporttion
People do not tin bout te enionment , tey only think about the ie that they will spend on he trafi . the scentsts said th new society it a be cled " h fa societ " becue the the people do not want to do ay exercise , people do not walk anymore , pople ut use levators , etc .
a lot of commodities , this is ta easn of wy ere are not fuure o public transportation , popl do not wanna spend few ie waking to te bus satin or tu get a cab , although te sevice in e ubic transportation it is o ve good because of many hings like the inflation of prices , th way ha the b or ca driver refers to the peons , th way of the bus or cab drvrs drives , etc .
In citie like Mexico soe people hae h opportunity to use Uber , ha is a service tat y an use if yo have a credit card , it is an amazing servic , but no l the opuation he ca or the economic staus to use an uber , so eople hv to e public transportaion , no matter if the buss or c iver yll thm or drve bd , in eico te pulic tranportation in specific the as a not a vry secure sevce , becaus me of t drivers still and indnap , in my ituaion thy ca il you if you do not have yur precutios . but despte of hs is very sad that in that lac eople c not do sme thing because hey do not hav the possibiltie to pay fr oething more so they hae to ok .
In cities like United Sate of mrica where peple have e opprtunity to av a car or a privileged social condition so for th American people public transportation it does not matter , tey ae the possibiliy to ta public transportation or not , thy an decide , so hy decided o commodity .
Th future of the pulic tranportation can be death or can be in grot , it deend on ere do o position your point of iew , in Mexio maybe il never die , t in h United Stas h pubc transportation is o in agony .

ok Review :

I jus read t irst ok in a tiloy called e Hunger ames .
It is an action d thiller book wrten by Suznne Collins .
When I started reading I cold t put it down becaus it is a fascinating tory tt grabs y .
T story tkes pla in a country called ane which is locate in ht wa once known as Noth America .
Katniss the protagonist is a eeage girl 16 whch is forced to poach to feed h family sin his ater died
An increasing nmber of eople begin to disus or he ucess in school or work , the haig an biliy to adapt or adjust conditios or ircumstances is more mportant than hvig excellent knowledge or a fiel of tuy .
Many people air their opinions based on ther own value sytm .
The majority of eople tend to claim that hving an xcellen kowledg or the resach field is the st importat f school or wk sucessfully .
However does he caim eally ring ru , conforming the real situatio ?
I find mslf n on e am avelenth ih such an idea .
It is my cntention tt the eole , o have the ability to adapt or adjust coditins or circumstances have higher percentage be successul in schl or wrk .
As far as I concern , thre a a bunch of rasons to support me perspctie .
To begin with , acqiring th knowledge in today 's world is n a dfficult thigs than it w in the ps .
Tht is to say , the investment of he itenet ma it available fo everyone in the wld .
Peole an ealy btin h lted kowledge by owning a computer that cn accss to th network an hae the abiity to readig .
In other word , he way to get the knowldge is equal to verone in the world .
That is why it is not to be the key point tt considerd the ey to success .
In addition , the education has already aross the wealth g .
To exlain , ter are a ted that ma univerities al over te wld setting up the freely ourses r the people who thirsty for nowledge , also ftn inite te famos scholar to gve a speech to the pulic that is welcome o eveyone .
People in modern socety hae a ot of resourcs to fuher esarch the fild of study tat thy are intreting in .
hu , evryone might be an exert .
Excellent erformnce in the fel of study has not ben determined of factors r your success .
A case in point wld be h laet news bradcased recenly .
Acording to the inestigaton conducted by the 104 human resourc bank , the percentage of peole sing he knowledge in the wok fie that they rm school hs srprising redce in the las o decades by roughl thirty percent , a figr that has nearly ne half compad to that of half - centu .
Say it simply , t things tht schoo tac us wre no longer be used in the rl rld .
This phenomenon had been curiously ma experts .
Does he knowledge fo school av ay different in the wok fied ?
However , after deeper analysis , we und tat th very underlyn contributig factor lies in h fast pce changing world d th tet bo an not catch up with it , knowledge is chaning from ti to tie .
enc , this rsarch remained us tat e ability to dap or adjut to changing conditions or circumstances is the major ctor to sucss stead of aving excelen knowledg or a fiel of study .
In sum , hee may be some pople who m disagree with my osition on this mtter .
They a sa hat havin exellent knowledge or a field of study is the a to success in scool or work .
Howee , I think the reasons I he provided in fvr of my iew point re sronger .
In hi ssay , I wil iscss whther older or younger parents r etter .
Nowadas , te statistics sow hat many peole ae younger th gnrations befre .
I think there are more ounge prents becaus they do not liv in a religious life wic is far mo sicter .
Previouly , the mot wmen sd to g a baby after th weddig with heir parers , bt today , it is not so impotant anmre .
Evry child wish to hve youn pants , ut is it really better ?
ctually th teenagers ae right because yonger arents ae a stronge relatioshi wi their childre .
Apart from this he small diffrence betwn the ages is alo an advantage .
Although less experience is owned , th cognize what a chd wants to do .
On the other and a disadvatag is tha young prnts a t able to protect their babies ithot aing experience on at .
In my age young parents d I ve in common ta we go out in the evenings .
From my oint of view older parets c ive better advice in very difficult situation .
So te child grows up ro a teenager to a idle - agd dul and can alwy looks up to te parents .
Howve e poress in adolescece is important for h ne stg of life so I believe ot ae good at bng up their childen .
To conclude , yu can not change your parents anyway .
It a ee a very log and tirn day , but Tom felt he hd achieved sometin elly good .
Tom had aith this d ill be better than the other .
He did n't rcover et ro e at scare he had that ay .
He sat on his har an looked to the window .
" ..... " he loked to h hnds .
He was shaking .
He shook his head n looked to th ceilin .
He stared to ke his homewo , but he d trouble concntrating as t memories came back to h mind .
" I an't ... do it " he lammed h ea on he ek .
" I ca n't "
He looked to te bathroom dr an wake to it .
He turned the lights on to se his ce .
The same face as ver .
Wh he looked down the bahroo he saw somting on h for .
It as a note .
" Tom . Tom . Tm . Tm " it said .
That sred him .
It old n't be him aai ...
He tune the note to see something
" 192 - 2015 "

No uture for public transport ?
Ca se of our ow a instead of a public trnsort save you money , ie and effort ?
e mot eope pefer a car rather than a public transport .
However he last studies shws a ar is nt always more efficient .
The ight choice of means of tranport makes a bi impt on your time d resoures .
In deciding whehr to cooe car or publc transport we nee to cnsider many factors , such as lengt of jurey , time of the day we travl , ra we travel tough , nmer of us , ather etc .
As there ar cases where r is much more efficient tn ubic transpt n other wy round .
The recent studies found , that tavellig from a suburb to e city centr is much more efficient by combining a bie it a trn .
It sve plnty of time by avoiding traffic jms and there is no need for erching fo a aring spc .
In dition taveling by trai sav a great dal of mone as her is no parig fee .
Moreover here re discouts for regular journeys .
On the other an , the sudie owed , in my othr cass ad especially in irreular trips there is more convenient to u a car .
A car is unbeaable r it flexibility .
It is much more easy to use a ar when goi soping , or making a leiue or an ocasional trips .
Athouh , there are some isadvantages of usig a ar ch as traffic js and a ih maintnance cost .
All in al , in most ass sing your on car a sae you moey , me and effort .
Popularity of cars confirms it .
In spite of that , tdies said there are cae in wich pubi transport is unbeatale .
Therefore it hs a afe plae in o society .
The use of public tanspot as bcome an mportant issue nowadays .
There e ths wo ty to aoid the us of public transport and prefer riving ther w car due to the dvanages it offers .
Hwever here ar hose who reject this n a in favour of he use of publ trasort .
I am oig to explain y I think there is not future for e pubic transport .
A geat amon of people think ta driving you n a s more benefit than using public transport .
Firstly , it allow you to go directly somehere withut finding ut the nformation but th imtables of public tanspot such as ues or rins .
In addtio , sometimes ou have to combine bot of them in order to arriv on im to your work ace .
Anothr benfi of n using ublic trnport is h time you can save .
Fo nstance , if yu have to go anothe ity by bus or tin to yu workplace , t time you ste sine you set ff inreases .
Sain ti in the mornings allows yo to sleep me or to spen mre tme with yor fail .
Moeoer , the e of your ow car has more advatage . raveling by cr avoids getting we wn the weather is rany .
If you trveled by b or train , probly you wuld spe moe me walking along the stres to your fin destination .
spite the bad wather , if you travelled by ar , o could park your car ar your desintion , so that ou culd arre comfortably .
oweer , ther is some people wo prefer the ue of public transport in spite of using the car .
The govrnment usally advis t populton to use plic transpo to c dwn pollution and t amount of gas hch dage th atsphere .
In addition , it is ofte claie tt is eaper than travelling by car .
Althou it hs some benefits , in ms part of t country , eseially in h smalet tons h publc transport is not enough deveope .
To sm up , I believe tht he public transport has no future bcause it mks yo to wae a o of time , it is not enough develpd in sall eas an tee is o enough requecy of trains and buses .
In my opiio it could be useful hadl ever times , so it woul be eessary a great mout of improvemnt .
.H. awrence 's saig " body ought to own houss or furniture - ny more tn they ow the toes of the high od " is an ambiguous syin tat questions the ee of h pope regarding a hg umer of prpertie .
First of l , to a certain dege , I coml wh the ide of controlling te maximum numbr of propertie one holds in i rap , becaus this deies the possibility of exhausting the spaces tat can hol another family .
his speak of e idea of the government or anoter organization aing e cotol ove hoes and their furniture nd maki the eple liin thre only t oner of their o goods .
Ts is an inerestin conpt becue it ca give th govenmnt th moe it needs to slve its oter problems d ds n't necssaily beak any le of personal space .
Second of l , as I d y " to a certain degree " , t id of controlling one 's own hoces regrdig house picking ad what they c do with them takes aw a it of the freedom , which is the complete opposite of wat we hould t to .
Mankd has always strived for freedom in ne y or anoter , d taing aw the contrl of their ow houe , their sanctuary , wil nt be tak lghtly by th .
In conclusion , I can not tell whether or nt te control of the eople 's houses d furniture il bring y help in today 's society , as we are ony hypothetcally speaking , without y form of testing , hoever it oe ha its strong nd ea oints .

In ti atice I am going to write abu my favourte sport otball .
I love footbll eause it 's a team sport .
u fe that you are a prt of te team and veryone is together .
It 's also a realy n sport to pay .
It 's really n when we e playing different cups , Gothia for exampl .
It is wols biges youth cup and re located in Gothenbr in wede .
Another cup that is Sweens seond bgget c ad e called " Pite√• ummer Games " nd it is sortn to " P " .
Bot cups are really n to pa , and it 's extemel u to go far in te cups .
My advice o people tat is gin to tart football is that yo just ha to do yur st .
And t to be a pat of t tm , he it 's mo n .
And hn a football training oes bad , you do n't have to complain so much abut it .
Just keep goi nd ty to do it again .
Of ours y a be angry but it 's ot a b deal .
veryne does wrong sometimes , en t es plaers in t wod .
And at last , it is really fun to ly .
wel , th pat of the d tht I ejy te ost is nigth beaue it 's when I arrive at om a I have inih my whole rutne so I can tae a eak and I can do whaever I wn nd I can just relax so I would sa that ngth is th ms relaxing pa of my day so it is th one I prer the most
Ithn ther e thin ou ned to pn bcaus it 's important r your life but it eens on the sitution because I also ike to let thing be al et them happend because they hve to happend so h majority of ti I refer not to hik about it and just let them happend and n to pan anything but if it 's something related with my future or someein ht wi be really fec me I will prefer to lae it ik what kind of job I wt to do or aut my dregree or things like that

Moreoer , or the parents is easier .
I want to emphasize at thanks to i full schedule an amnt of the coaches , auls like children can do different aivities at t sam tim intead to have to wit .

hre are two choices to trav : by own car an by pubic ranspot .
In my opinion , I prefer to travel by ar or those reasons .
Firs , I ca trvl by my own car whenever and whrver I an .
Fo example , if I travel to my company by b , I must be on time and follow th bus shdule .
Sometimes , bus sceule es no sitable fr me .
Maybe , bu coes to early or too le r me to go to work .
Traveling by car , I an hooe he im .
Moreoer , I can choose my w out to go to ork .
I cn stop at my farite coffe ho to buy drinks or breakst .
Second , I feel comfortable when I tral by my ow car . I hate to travel by public transport because it is sometms to crwed ad noy .
In rush hours , I do not have a sat a I stand al te ie for a hf hor .
In my own car , I can relax with msc ad enoy fresh air .
Furthermore , I do not worry about h thef or any crim which us to happen when I traele by rain .
Generally , although traveling by pblic transport is cheper than by a .
However , I find traveli by my own car much ore vantages than others .
Therefore , I tink public tnsport wl be disappeared in the futre .

We liv in e century of he speed .
ach year we use mr and more tpes of ranport : buses , tram , subway , rain , airplans , etc .
d of course , we use oe and oe personal as .
Do I think that public trnspor ll one in e future ?
s I do .
Oe of e reasons is the ime .
w we are spending t much te in waiting o public transport and of ourse we ould like to get ur destiaton as at as possible , b pbic transport does n't provide uc possibility for us .
Tat is why we ty to buy our prsonal car .
Furthermore we us persoal vehicles or ret crs or travellig , because it is more convenient and gives us the feelings of our independence .
I undertnd copleely ta ome typs of publc trnspor sch as airplans and shps , will exist some time .
But this is an exception because eisting echnoloies do nt alo the usage of sch pesoal ransport as we oud at preent day .
But , the future wi change this situation .

The Vetnamese educton and study sstm is competely different from the Austraian one .
Li to Asia countries , such as : Korea , ina , Singapoe , te Vietnamese education ad tuy syte is really harsh and high competitiv to all tudents , especially for he rimary students .
Firstly , the priay education and study system of Vietnam is er hard .
They have to sudy a lot with fro 5 - 6 subjects in a smster .
Thee sbject mainly fous on math skills , grammar , writing , but there are nt any courses elated to ie nd commnication skill or nnovative siece .
All subjcts are less flexile d all students ae learning th same progams at th same time .
enwhile , the Australian educaio and study system is easier n mo njyable an Vietnamese sytem .
In a cas , there e very f stuents with many more flexible sudy rogrms .
The priar students ar touch many different life ills by teachers at chool .
Additionally , the subjects in e cool e gie ih the am to develop thikin and creativity of sudents .
hey ls la many interetig sort .
Secondly , it is not only from the shol but also Vietnamese parents of the primary sudents are also expected in the education of tei hildren .
They usually hop hat thir chlden t on the hight scor in school .
Terefor , otsde te scol , Vetnamse parents at to send hei children to tutorial classes , such as : ath , writing , grammar , ‚Ä¶ .
Consequently , Vitnamese children have not any life skills ad have many health problem , suc as : short - sighted , tum - ach , spinl column ‚Ä¶ Sdl , the proortio of Vietnamese children who are sor - sighted end to inrease in recent years .
Mewhile , Australian paren als care abot the children but oth way with Vietnese parents .
Outside h school , they send thei ids to sport Centre or go to e ocial activiti .
Sum up , Australian hildren r happier than Vetnames children . I think that primary student nd to spend me time for layin and enjoy their hildhod .
I loed to limb from the wo go .
My irst time was an exciting xpeience I il nver forget : e touch of the rock , h high , the pain in your fingers ... I like clbing becae ths sport makes me feel alive , even somtims I feel fr .
But do n't thk tht cliing is a dangerus atiity!. Althogh you cli to the top of a rok wl , yo lways do it with a checked security material .
Firstly , if yu want to clmb yo will ned , at least , a partner .
o must rely yu life on is pero , so it 's importn you get on with hm or hr .
It is perha f tis reson hat people wh climb are often couples !
Moover , climbg is a sport in ich it 's not o iprtant if you are a man or a woan becas you does n't only use your trengh ut lso your equilibation .
You shuld gi a try to ti musing and thrilling sot that it 's a sor of copetition with youref : every day a litt it highe , evey ay a little bit diffiult ..
If yo take up climbing , I 'm sure you 'll rry on ! !

It was so excting ad unny listenig to ll those musicins , ecase so of them actually did n't have he skills to pla ad did n't have t charm needed to warm up the people .

Througout my life I lived in a f ities and villge located in South of usia .
ah of t cies has unique se of traportation means .
In illage he only a of public transprtaion is small buses , os of which can service up to twenty passengers in any moment of time .
In regional eters os peope commte via trolleybuses and tramcars .
Th latest is transport of choice of st people becus its passengers vey rarly ls tim in trafic jams due to dedcated railwy passages .
Tose wo e not satisfied with pulic tansportaion ssem ma use pvate vehicles .
I estiate moe then 99 percent of tm are cr .
Rael we an s bicycles and scooters .
I used to travel on buses .
t rcetly I ought a cheap bike and really enjoyed riding in sumer ti .
Now , in Novemr , weather in Rssia is not so good so I switched back to bus .
My os recen dream is to ride on EuroVelo oad etwor .
I expect them to be ch mre suitable for ike compared to ocal roads .
I wis oad surface quality in Russia ill improve yar on yea .
Hello my ne is Ni Joly and I 'm sveteen .
I sill go to hi school where I study or languages , rench , Spish , English an Italian .
Thanks to my mom , to travl and to the eple I 've met I 've leat ow to seak fearless a quite flunly in nglsh .
I abslutely love chidren and honestly hey love me ; I hink it is a sort of a gift , bcase not all the peole love children an can t on well wh hem .
I 've a a lite it of experience in summer ay sitting some is ; in Ita it is more diffiult to be a babsitter becaus if yo a ndrage , prens should hve esponsiblity on you so it is better to be over 18 .
I lv playing with kid but as always there are some rules hat av to be followed .
Th os important rule , in my opinion , is " hvng f witut hurtng or gettn hurt " .
During tho few times ih ich I bui my experiene we al played tgethr and we ooked togethe , so I taght the ow to make oe chicken nd some pasta in an Italian way .
Honstly I 'm no the bt cook ever , u I can mke a few od things le scarbled eggs , asta nd me .

Trust in flying with a horse
I eally like may spors on hi world . I go to ge gym daiy to st ft and healthy .
Bt my overal vourite spot is riding horses .
I 'm doing it since I 'm ix years ol .
It is so fascinati fo me to build up a relationship to te ose yu ride .
You know hat is e most important thng bout riding orses ?
It is al about trust .
If you provide confidence , the hore il trust ou .
Wit this relance yu c go throughot everything toeher .
My pele tink , it 's not really a ort .
But believe me , iding uses so much endurance !
What I le mostly abo ll the different sections of riding horses is jumpg .
I feel so free when I n fly ve hse ostcles .
Anoher gd feelng is h speed wen you galop .
Surely th was t everything .
Riding eas lo to clean th ors and lok ter it , ut nevermind , it 's the bet sprt you ca do .
As the production of cars is increase , it seems ta t needs for public transportation is dclined .
Soe insi hat no one ed bu or subway in th future .
However , in my opinion , it rather usfl to e public vehcles as me goes by basd on two ritical easons .
Frs , people do n't want to waste their tme finin parin ts .
e re people have thir own cars , the ore space to pak is needed .
Unfortuatly , ther is a certain limit to sac , so it is not possile hat veryone ue teir c evy day especially in mega citie lke Seoul , New Yo , and ondn .
It is mo convenient to ove from hr to there when ou take he bus or subway because you do n't ave to worry aut your a while woing .
T secon reason is mor important ad obvios .
It is related to the environmentl iues .
Using public mean help to protect the Earth frm r pollutin .
Thr e so many kns of problems which the environmental pollution cuse .
h pollutn is a in of lobal isse of wic eople should consider seiousy .
Withou rducing personal vehicls , thr is no solution of that problem .
Surel , te government wil try to mk a better syte of public transpr because they wnt citizens not to e their ow means .
For these reasons , the wl be the future f e public transport always .
oreoer , it is quite optmistic hat people will need me it rather ha privae tansport .

This topic leds me to think of professional skl " Architecture design " .
Tis resul in dferent of views on wethe peopl age the best things or improvement people 's ives ave lreay tae place .
I hod the belf hat the topic for me is compltely wrong , even so improvements are easy to e and solves h mo of polems .
Fir , the developmen of population still continue , the ace for living sti a serious problem although , the skyscraper already sved e mt of problems from poulatin crisis .
On the oher han , the skyscraper makes more problems , such as pollutin .
For example , I esiged he highy architecture in the highly ppulation density city in Taiwan .
The skcraper rovides mor ace fr excss population ; owevr , the building will produce ore pollution hn h skyscraper constructs by modr materials , such as tel and concrete .
hey wil deroy he enviromnt wh the raw ateria digs ot fro the site .
The polluton must hr the local pole and environment from the sit of raw materials .
hi is why I ntioned tat te problem still exists a the poblm only transforms to nther regis a ype .
Second , he omputer syste ooks like solv he most of roblems ; however , this system mk more daneros in seific situtions .
Th " BUG " must be appears rom man - made ystm becase of te incomplete oing .
Tht is w our personal infrmatio awys leaks to h " hacker " .
For instance , when we joy the eecronic comercial servce and sp the goods on the Internet , the hacker may steal th private inormaton at he ae tme .
Tey will e that information to cheat peple 's money on t hoe and ou wl tus em beause of the crrec personal infomaton .
Thi is oral phenomenon in Taiwan ; hoever , plice ca n't do anything bcause of e haker 's noymity .
Tht is what I sid that h bt impoveent things still no exit , even e computer syst lready solved om rolems .
Of couse , om people may be moved to disage with my position on ti issue .
hat being said , I still fl the reons I have presented was strong ones , suc as architeture and cmpute system .
Der Jane ,
As so as I rea h article abou yor roble , I deided to wite you at nce n ve you me suggestions , since I av the siilar iteest in physical fitness , too .
I feel vry strngly ha the dal exercise is a basic definition which we must kep if we want to be on shape .
To sart wth , a simple wy to wok out is not to et the u fo chool .
For example , you could go on foot or with yr bicycle accompnie by your friends itead.by oin this , you will burn more an more calories daily ithou a special equiment an avng fun ih our ps .
Furthermore , if I re you , I would go with engaging in healh club .
Fr instance , ignng up for hip - hp ace or aeroic classes as I do , it would be a nice ia .
In this a , u wll do a hard - working exrcie witot realising it , as you ll njoy yourself at e same time .
What is mor , it old ep if o work ut at home and buy gym equipment such as treadmil or a bicycle .
By oing th chores of the hos like the wasing is another w to exerie as well .
As a result , you il save tme and embarrassment , especially if yo are t of shape .
To su up , if you follow my otins o 'll see resuts irecly and I 'm sure you will not regret it .
You will nt eel se - confent and glad , but your outward appearance wii be beter .
Friendship toa
Frienship is actual a really important isue nowadays .
Plety of ways ca be sed to ma ew frinds .
Facebook , Twitter ‚Ä¶ all of these ocial newrks offer us the easest way to find nw friends .
Bt are they rea ones ?
In my oinion te est way to develop yur new friendship is , meeting them , have a cffee a drin or whatver .
Talking is tuly the unique y to t to know people and establish strong bound .
Moreover , me guy try to find fiends who alway gree wh hm .
Howver , it cod be a little bi unhealy .
To tell you frnky a bet friend hs to ffr you a different point of vie and what is mor it is important say no sometimes .
For l of tes reasons we have to ta re ur fiendship thes days n scia etworks are ok to be in toch with your friends ut if you wo n't to make nw ones .

Review Silence of h Lams
Thee are may go movies , espcially thillers re alays enjoable in my opinion .
One of those is the movie ' Slence of the Lams ' , wher Clarice , an FBI gent in trainig , has been asked to tal to an imprioned Hnibal Lecter who ha information bou a serial killer the FBI has been ting to catch .
Tre wer sevea reasons why th movie stood out .
First I was reay impressed by the performance of Jodi Foster ( Clarie ) ad Anthon opkin ( Hanniba ) .
I have lwas hought of them as reay good actors , but they wr exquisie in this movie .
No only in tei indvidua pats , but also in he cees the d togethr .
Scodly , the stoyline ws unpredictable and really clvr an for tht realy enjoyable .
You hd to pay atention throughut he ntire movie to eep up ih the sry .
On top of that wa tere tension at all times .
This move is outsanding , I belve ta even pele who are n eally into thiller il enjy wtchig it .
As I mentioned bfoe , are bt the atng and he storyline rlly impressive .
You will be watching with ul interst .
At last is the charcter of Haniba Lecter one of a kind , there is no the movie wre y will find a figr like hi .
Dearest Rene ,
How 's yo frst English lteratur lesson at school ? I hop it d loads of fun with plenty new knowledge acquired !

Duin te reign of Queen Elizabth I an Ki Jms I , ply watcng wa an enertinment o t locals to relax .
As it cost very lite to e nto an open - aired theatre , eveyone jammed d otled to watch lay , thug the poor stood under brig sunshine d ha eir heads burnt wle the rich sat in t shelter with an extra shiling aid .
At the same tm , actos were by dressing and recitng the crips . '

These actors pa ull atention to convenience h audience that it was graceful Juliet rather than a stiff boy ctng .
They used props , thck ma - up , gowns , wigs d all ots of accessorie .
The ' Juliets ' ven had to have thir beard and moustahe and eny their roe throughout the play .
Wa a gargantuan sacrifice of sf - esteem and reputation they d give up !
Oe more interesting fact is hat , both t lovers in the pa were talians but their playwright ad never bee to Italy .
It cul reflect 16th cntuy London was a lting oint of dierent cutures n Skespeare probably go in touch Italian culure by making friends with thos local vsitrs .

As you skd I am going to give the information of how my vilge looks after the eironment .
My village s ben wking on this project for decades they have ee fixing thei tecniues an te stl know a day 's evrythig has cost us a l of effort we started fr th esiest examples ( dividing rubbish into different containers ) to some that re me comlex ( renewble energ ) .
We lve in an aea where its population has l pes of animals wic can e hurt ver easily by human 's activities ; so in our community we have vy strict ues wh referrig to taking are of e environment .
The principal things eveyone us hv at their hoes e tree trah an for the diviion of he rsh ; oe must be or renwabe mterils ( ret of food , pape , aton ‚Ä¶ ) another for plastics and the lat one f glass .
All th enry ing used in the own is renewable eney ; ( hydraulic energy , olar energ nd wd enrgy ) every hous hs a solar panl that gets th u light transforming it into energy , ht provide part of the eergy to each house t days ta the u shines but if there is no sn te village hs a dam beside us hich provdes the enough with aer for h whole village and so wih hydrauli energy ; not nl we hve hydraulic energy but al wn energy ; in the ut skirts of h illge ther is a wind powe lant were h id energy is prodced .
Aso ur wate has one of e best purification thods after we us it we cea it so we do n't contaminate the water of e river or dam .
To r to keep the enviromet clean we hv a ig goup of voluntary workers tt work after their jobs here trying to ee this area as clean as possble by picking all th rubbish and controlling the whle aea in case there is somethig ot normal .
Apart from ths grup of voluntaries every peon of the village is obliged to ake care of the environmnt a e the car as lile as pssible so te pollution is as minmm as posble er the bicycle is the most famous wy of trnport car are n't cmon he are nly ud wen transporting eavy hig or wen travelling long distanes .
Nowadays , mn eole like do the shopping .
But everyone hik in that way ?
Some of them think tht buying tins are ey ring an unnecessary .
First adanage of buying e thns in shos is at it is ry satisfying , in particular for won .
Many of them ar relxed when they are searching for ew , rearkale cltes .
Scondly , we could find shocking brgai in shops .
Sps could give us eve 70 percen of sale , what help ving moe mone .
On te ote ha , dog he shopping is nt only smething njoyable .
ne of the drawback of goi to the hop is ta we pend huge amount of mney .
We wold uy next , ipacticable ih - he hoes , which il spend coue of eas in wrdrobe .
Last bu nt lest disadvantage against fo doing the shpping , in the mall could prowl my pickpokets , becuse th culd o us .
In conclusion , buying new tings is a good idea to spen fascinating time with friends , however we ould as lse a lot of money .
Personally , I do not gre wt th staemet " shoping is not lwas enjoyable " , becaue I like ti kind of sending leisure ti , f instnt , wth my mom or friends .
Thi b chart dels wi the osts of tree different photocpier .
Therore it compares he prchase rice , th warranty expenses a he uning costs of ah prodct .
Interestingly the pruchas rce of " Carde " nd " KD " is most the same .
In " Crds " case the amount is $ 600 nd " KDs " price is vagaly $ 700 .
Hwever " Sebu " ock with a ruchas price of $ 1,000 .
All potocopiers show a very low arranty pri .
In this categoy " KD " exeeds with cost of $ 00 .
Wherby " Crda " ad " eu " score wth wrrnty exenses under $ 1 .
" Cada"s prout h e highest running costs with $ 1,200 .
In the cae of " KD " h running charges come oy up to $ 800 ad " Se " has obvusly te lowest expenses wit $ 600 .
As a long term investion I woud choos " Sebus " model even its purchase price is ve high .
Te reason therefore are its mal arranty n especially running costs .
Te kenn rnnng expenses will ompensae the purchase prc in the futre .
In tday 's world , naly every person take care of wht sh or he is earing .
Mn peopl claim , that wearig fashionable clothes is very imotant .
It sems to me ht tese cohes may hve a high pice an sometime they do not wort it .
Some people ar if thy do ot wear the ates fashion , they wo n't be valuable person .
Th spen a frtune on outfits and wat for being amired and appreciated .
Wearing y nd of lothe have an effect on y , and obiously on yor imge .
I aree ih he idea tat clothes can help in exressing ourselves .
It is vr mportat to choo tos ies hih repreent ou pesonaliy .
For exampe , ome popl esign hir ow cloth and hey sew it t .
In this way , they represen originality just by using eir ceativit .
However , in mo cses pele are not satisfied with their sape ad look .
It is ofen owing to weaig lthes wch do no fit and suit them .
The laest fasho is often degned for li persons , so it is recommend to cose the ight es .
To m up , I blive there e pros and cns werng e ltest fasho .
The ost significant tig is that it is n what makes u beautifu .

Peter looked at his wtch and knew tt he had to do something immediately .
He ran over to hi treehouse on t muntai , where he se to spe time himself or reading a book .
Two days efore Peter received a letter of somee sayig to meet her / hm in he treehouse at 5 o'cck .
he treehuse was built by ter 's father a it w their secret .

Petr an nto his fther 's arms but he disappeared and he promised himself tht he never ever would tell anyone about he secret .
I do n think tht no future r public tranprt bause not al th people can have a car , especialy , or peop in t developing county .
Mreover , here are places on long distance we c no travl by ar , so we ned a train or even a lane .
In addiio , oe people do t like traellig by hir prvte ca on te highways cause they fear the accidents .
Bt on the other hand , l agree to some extent tha travelling by my pvate car is mh more cnvnient .
I ca travel at ny im beng restricted to specific imes , as wl as l ca est at an afe to drink my farite coee .
I enjoy uig GPS duig travellin on my own to explore ne plaes .
Consequenty , we can not dispense wth plic transport , ve if me of us would rater to u heir privt cars .
Some on - building aeas , in som countries , e n occupying by housin and ohr rsidentil buildins .
This wld ha some srious pblems fr both citins nd animas .
Huan beings need mo natal environment to li bttr and to ensue the living qualities .
Inhabit can go to coutyside to hae a pacnic or excurson wih her friens or families to relax .
Ar atral ara , sh as farmland , orest and wetland , re destroyd in large - sae , thee is no clo places wh beautiful cnes to vis .
h consequence is tt ty are easily to et sick with modern buildins , whc would influence thir mental eath , and ven worse .
o anals , they are a rt of nature , wre is the home for them .
Wthou a pleasant place to live in , he are confronting extinction .
If their living aras are occupd by housing and other buildings , thr sourc of food and ate ould be a srius roblem .
As a result , some most vulerabe seies will fae to die ut .
he large - scae buildin land are suporsed to be hei me .
For governments , restriction on exploring hum an is one of h ways to sole these problems .
Policmkers can nact a l in reducg land develoment .
Another mtod is ht naural cology gardens n be provided to hse anials , like birds .
As lon as there are some plas for them to lve , the natul ecology old be balncd .
In conclusion , a wide range of buldigs nd costruction can not only destroy o own ling environmnt , t also ta of animas .

The first thing I lernt ws that we are destroying t arh and , especially , the oceans .

Te second tin I learnt a ta we have to chnge the w of fishing cause the fishermen ki a t of aqutic anias , like dolphins or sea turtles , at they do n't want to kll .
Tis is because they dra nets aon he seabd and cath a the animls that are wimming in it .
So overl I oud recommend hi documentry to everyody because all the pople mst know what we r oin ih the Earth and they must learn to ook fter it becue we only hae one Ert ad if we destroy it , we wo n't ae n pce whee we cn live .

Doors will open by our voice , fotprin or reina can .

There will not be a home without i - conditioning anymo .

Ufortunately we ca n't know that for oe hundred percent .

As I think , earing likes a weapon fo any individua which eabls him to be like a champion .
elon andela said , " Education is h os poerul weapon whc you a ue to change the wol " .
Learnn has no e , We spen all of u lives learn from circumstances we face .
Learning nt only eas to stuy in schools , universities , e .
But it mans to improve you kills , your talents .
Nowadays , you have a l of ay to lear and be beter in yor life a our career .
o example , oe of these way is the Internet .
You can use it to larn ny language or take courses in any fil from your home durng weeks or months as you can , wich nam self - study .
This a be easy ony when o are determined to achieve wht you want .
Alays ememer tat , " Education is wa remains after o has forgottn wha he as earne in school " Albert Einsten said .
is oposition is about e famous peron fom my countr .
Ths humble and famous man is alld Knta Kenneth .
I choose hs m because he was a significant player during t slave rade .
He fought for te libeaton of lvery in West Afica .
He u t Gambia on te world ma .
The Gambia is visite by may tourist becse of i .
Ts hs led to ay black Americn to visit the Gamb fo investment purposes .
Kinta Kenth was a captured slave from Naima uffera .
He ws captred whie unting wih his coleagues in t fres .
Thi was in 1879 durig he slav trade period .
Kna as cpured bease he was ryig to esue his friend wh s lost in he frest .
He can across the slave master in th moh of e rer Gami while looking for his friend .
He ran aay rm hem but th later capturd h with their dogs .
Kunta a sod to lav master in South Amrca .
He work vey had in th ugar plntaion or the slave master .
While in capture , he fought h rights of all the blak slaves in th campus .
He refused to work more an eight ours a d an he refused to tak ders from t save master .
He w rfued ith food bt he kept gog wt his srike .
He was later given the opportunity to lrn Egish lnuage .
He attends he same class wh her relatives of the slave masers .
He did vey well duing their ex and was gve another opportunity to teach Engls to other savs .
He was famous and respectful in the save apus .
u was later beayed by his sle masters .
He organis dmonstraions which urnd o to abolishment of slavery .
He died durng the demonstration .
u s name w written by l estern nation newspaper as the brave man .
Because of his efots that lad to h abolishment of slavery and te freedom fr captured slave in the cmpu .
e ambia is well known by the adventurrs and e touris .
The history of Knta Knt is part of our natioal hstory .
The staue of Kint is situatd in h etrane of Banu .
Kunta was nt only a reat mn in he Gambia but a heo .
Puli ranport is a public medium to bing people from e place to another .
In this era , there are many yes of pubc transport usg by peoe , fo example : bs , trai , monorail , lit - ai - trnsit ( L ) , taxi , an so on .
Most peop uig a ublic transpor to go to thr workplace a travelling around th city .
Some of h woers choosing to use public ransort th ther own ca .
This is becase they want to avoid h traffic ock .
Mostly , they e re preferrng to us pblic tranpot than the car because it cn avd the traffic block nd save tme to gt into thr worklace arlir .
It is aso c ae he one as the rce of the ticket of publc transprt is cheaper compared to ol ost by usig th c .
Throuh al of hese pint , it is not flty to say that is the plic transport stil available n ver usful in our dil li , eve there a a lot ypes of car , hic re more covenient .
so , ter will be a futue fo public trnsport because of s ow benfits or advantges to human society .
It is ver frendly trnsportatin here th people from all places , eet in e trnsort and the cn ke a relationship between them .
Additionally , the pollton , sch as aze , will be dcreased beaue fewe peple using the car .
As a conclusion , there is a future or pblic transport and it so convenient to ue it for travelling .
We wll ot have to orr abut whee to find a park f te ca and we can enjoy th rip .

I have he pleasure to giv his essay to Ms .
Eliot , my special Englis teacher .
e restaurant I oud love to evie for he class is e of the most poula restaurants located jus na the downwn plaa .
It is aled the ' Egypan Cuisine ' and its nam actualy represents what it s to ffer .
It offers a delicious Egyptian menu hch provids enough dishes to cver all tates , as an xaple , their elcious fresh eggplnt traditional aad .
If ter is anythig that favors his esaurant , it s to be the quaniy ty serve ; a surely efficient quantity along t truly special qualit leaves hi rstaurant as one of the best in ton , if nt in e hole cunry .
What about the amazing eccentric atmospher hey have to offer ; ih a ulful liv ad and an elegant dinin se , their atmosphere adds up to th flavo of their fo .
In dditin to that , they will be be to ffer a connected tble that could ft ht whole class , prfessionlly med , he eeting tbl .
To cm to he pin .
This resarant ha to be t ight chce or two reasons ; fisty it offers a taditinal menu whch will ensure to cover al different taste .
Secondly , the lively atmosphere it offers wl surey ke the class entertned during t entire dine - in .
At h end of my essay , I wul like to vote this paragaph and han my wonderful teahe f thi pportunitic chance to ofer my sincere oinion on the topic .
My thanks an I hope fr a wonderful tip regardess of the restaurant vote for .
My irt y at ACU came to me as a srprise .
In t er first clas , I wa asked quesion by h teacher .
It wa a very different experience to earnin in Kre .
It was nt only the firt las tat I ad to speak out in cls .
Athugh it ws nt eas to t use to sh tecing stye , it id n take long or me to ealise hat teachers were expecing from us d why the wre dog so .
Participation in class by asin nd answering to questions demands mre active thinking from us .
Nobody would aue the signficnce and effetieness of oern technology , haing reolutionised al pheres of huma les by providig a great nmber of remarkable virtues , such as mssproductin , infration and communication devices as well as mdicl nd scientfic breakthroughs .
However , it ha lo posed some alaming issues , namely envionmental destruction , and increasng uemploymen an halth concerns .
his essay ill attempt to analyse boh ies of this conroversial phenomenon ith som aplcable supporing ideas .
To bgin it , eviently , technological progress has notcably enhanced ndividuals'quality of lives , controbuting to t economic growh of nmeros natns .
To illustrate , machineries an t use of fertilisers in agriculture have helped to develop masroduction ad raise h availabiliy and quantit of various tyes of fo , hang made them cheaper d me afordabl .
My favourite sport is a Tamil sport now as Kabadi .
I believe may of us do not have a fantest idea abut hs port .
At the outset , et me tl o abu is port nd how it is played .
It is played in a x dawn on the ground in the size of a voleyball court .
A etre line prts the x and a ie is dran inide each box bou 2 feet from e lin which nds th box , ad this line is called proudly as Ellai du(Bder Line)in Tml .
There wil be 2 teams ad each ea consists of 6 players d the players sume te border line as their own border .
This makes h game war - like and ey specal to Tails .
Rus of ngaement re uite imple .
The irs an most importat rule is o do not t th opponent player ho raids your fid(th box)to touch your border(Border Line).The secod rl is You do o let the opponent to cros ve the ' No e 's land'(h centre line),when te opponent toucs th Border of ou's .
The opponent must raise a leg wn the other ne touces the border to tell tm " Lo , I am in yr territory".If the opponent touche h border , he a retreat to hs ield , no shame in that , u he do n't t ay points .
B before rereatig , if he toces anyoe aong tem a leaves their field without tting cuht , then Te raide gets a point and e erson who was tuched by the rader is dad(Out ) .
ah tam es opportuniy to rd other 's eld alternativey , and te first one to aid is dcide by t toss of a coin , as ual as in st games .
A numr is decided to ount the ead ones and hch am reache that numr fis loses the gm to the other .
Rule re petty simple bu te me is qute tough , ou'll hrt yourself relly bad .
It taks a day to coun h scratches on you body after te game .
But tht is he reason Tamils enjoy the game and he chesh it .
Why on earth do they love slits , cratches and scars!Are they sick ?
One an nder , ut we a fn he reason in their Sangam Literature , written circ 30 E .
It ays the braey of me is reckoned by the numbr of scars on his ody excep on his back , because he thoght to be dead in the field is f better than rtreating .
Thre are accouns to a about a woman o c he reas becase e found he son 's body pierced by a long arro par - le wapon in his ac rather in th chest .
So I lie th gam ecaus it eflect he Tami clture 's important value wih is giig hg ank to braery .
I love to pla e game with my friends in my village , a vry refreshing gm , I would say .
no exams or weddn or h firt day of school ,
one of my most ecxiting ay of my life as the 23rd august 2014 .
it c be ver strange ut i as very exited , because ,
on ti te the BBC released te new seris of Dctor who ...
It is a popular Eglish science fiction and it tal about he adventues of te " Dcto " .
the Doctor is an alien om the lant Gallifrey a he traels in l of me n space with h companions that re normally humans . in his eperinces he saved whole planets to other bad aliens .
I think Docor Who is totally different ro other scnce fiction films , it always a done the unhinkabe , the impossible , hings that no one le has een dramed of .
Doctor 's travelsmachine is a Poliebx ... it is mll d be utsid , b it is bigger on te inside .
I li Dotor Who ery much . I always dem to travl everywhere in time n space since I was a little child ! ! !
! if,(one d)I wl have the possibilty to do it I will go to distn galaxies an I wl e how the univese ban .
in my opinion this sei was wonderful and , i hope for th next one !

Emily nw she would ave to come to a decision so .
Th Headmaster hd asked hs scho 's teachers to egin a class in Enlish nd h was ne of hem .
The i queston was if se would ae been able to engage herself in this new activity .
Sh was trying to imrove e Engsh slls since September by taking an nglis ourse , but se had felt eself sill unready to keep a hle mh topic using thi language wt he Clil method , because she ws placed to the B2 level in reading ad ltening while in speaking ad writig t level she had joined doing a specfic tes wa only he B1 .
After thinkig a l about the postives n negatives aspcts of thi question , refers also to t qlity of hers teachng mehod and e tme she h to pend prepang te mah topics in Elish , Emily decide to accept the challenge an to engage heref in this ew adventure .
hn I hik about Te ome of t Future , I can see a lot of nw things tt could simplify my daily fe .
I thik that people il live more ecoogicall .
In he Ho of he Future eveybody will segregate aste nd take care of environment .
Peopl il have the devce ta extinguish h iht wn we leave e room .
We wil ha furntre that do not stain .
We as discover flwer hat irrigate themselves an maine that walk a dog or ws thm when we do n ve enough time to do this .
We wil ll hve vacuum cleanes that will dt everything without our knowledge .
Kitche wil be diffent to .
We wil have equipment ha will prear els fr us wih only one pressin a butto .
Then we wo n't dream about eat , Italian spaghetti because r stove wl do it beter than every Italian coo .
hat is the ki of house at I ant to rsiden in twenty years .
The answer on th questio depends on e fact in which lae you live .
If t place of your happy living is relativel lag cit , ou will sa indeed : " We obviously ned puic transport ! Everyone knows ht hapes on h strets in rsh time ?
You can gt stuk in trafi a for hors ! " .
It seems that if people did ot move yourself ly in their beautiful ars and te a bu or metro , e air would be cearer , t ciy would beom ls oisily etc .
On the ohe hand , if you iv in a sal ton or villge , your answer is : " Of couse , I prefe my own car or biycl to pulic transprt , if I do n't go fa away .
I have more idas where to tave by cr , as publi transport 's routes e "
On your atitud to public transportation highly ffecs e qlity of pubc transport itself .
I men a timetable punktuality , te interval to tne ex bus an so on .
At last , o b te crowd e in t bus or subway car in ru tm , ow convenient f yourself to be the , rather than sitting in our own air - conditione and perfect lokin ar .
at is all I woul like to y at this oint .
" Resoluion nubr e : Obviously will lose tweny poun . Number two : Always pt last night 's anties in the laundry baske .
ually importnt , ill fnd sensble boyfiend to go ot with and not continue to form romantic attachments to any of t following : alcoholics , workahols , commitment phobic 's , peeig toms , megalomaniacs , emotional fuckwit or prvers .
And especilly il nt fantasize about a particular person w embodies al tese things "
- Helen Fielding , Brdgt Jnes 's Diry
I was alys ascnated by this American traditio to make a resolution list .

As my sister constantly says You 're luy because u have a memory of a goldfish Y remember absolutey nothing .
It too me much to admit this again fac .
In contrast to my siste ( she as an extraordinary memory ) I forgt everything easily d ep looing fr new emotos and adventures .
A year ag an idea of beginnig a blg encountered me as advice fro an Eglish techer .
He recommended me to writ in rde to apply my Engish knowledge .

I hope I il see such futr .
I ho it will be real for me to see w humas will land on Mars , ow this will beoe opuar .
I believe tat the public transport does n't have ftre because travellig by r is so much more cnvenient d comfortale .
hen you travel in you w ca ou do n't have to wit a specific me nd you can go omewhere but wh ou avel in public transprt you must wt to the time when the ublic transpot col atch you .
I think ht is he main rblem , ut you can also cange whre u r ging to .
In pblic transport you must go to the point in the ute .
Th seats ae more omfortale in a cr thn in a bus or underground .
That 's wh I prefer Travellig by car instead of pbic transport .
My dear ohn ,
I am very gad to rea this go news , it is the first tep fr the fia result n I wll ry to do my best to give you useful infomation for your inteview .
But bfor that , it is important hat you av a eneal idea about my company ; its business nd gals .
It open more than tenty yea go and still now is the ledr of chimcal sector .
Remember this is fundamenta fo each interview .
The day of th event dss not to formal but also nt to infrmal .

Goo lu fr e fture .
Rcentl I ae seen " Prisone " , a ret thriller .
Tis film is aout a kidaping of t little gils .
Everone in the vilage try to id th hildre .
Th main character is the father of one of the chilen .
Te mn is realy frighene and ti ituaton gts him more and more desprate n he a nt control his reactins .
I enjoye this fm a lt bcaus it atract ur attenton all th tim .
In my opinion it is so really exciting bcaue you are onstantly thinking here t irl are or who ca be e kidnaper .
I would rcomend " Prisners " to he stuent flm lub because it h the features hat you nt .
I believe that if ou r lokng fr an intresting thriller , this thrler is e correct oe .
However , there is a problem ad it is that the lm shos muc violence and it should no be sen by childen , only by teenagrs or older peple .
At ay case , in my opinon it is a ret fm wich an people would enjoy if they e it .
We hav always bn tyig to find or oigin .
We want to kno d understand what is happening nowadays d , r ti reaon , it is important to kow what happened before .
As the way I see it , to fid th orgin of laguges c be similar to now or n family tree .
Because th cn give us a lot of new iormation out us ta we did n't know .
On th ne hand it n be funny to imagine n reat the story of how everything happeed formerly .
u on the ther ad , we can have too muc imagination and to be disappointd with the truh .
Tat alwy depends on what we were epectng for .
In my opinon , there are so many things we ha to discover yet , n much moe we left back as we rgress .
Consequently , it wl be a constantly research on the fied of ur origins .
My favourite srt is not a spot as yu ma think of it .
ost pople who do sport want to be f an stay healthy .
Sport is connece wh moving a lo in any case .
My favourte sport is ifferent .
Well , it kees my fit , but not my bod in t first as , it 's good for my bran .

When it coms to helin communities , people hold different aitudes toward whether young pole nowadays do n give nough ime to helping thir commuties or ot .
Some people think oung peope sed enough tme to hp their communities ; however , ther disagree with t idea .
Although yung people are required to help thi communities very eek , actually it is stll not enough .
It is true that young people e required to hl thei communiti by their schols or companies .
It is ls true that hese kinds of requirements really work , an ma communities a benefited .
Atually , hre ae mn communities still do not receive enough help , or an social issues ad events would not be discused again a again .
an reasons result in this phenomenn .
The ord becomes more and mre competitie , young people have to spend uc im to cultivate temselves to survive in this soiety .
oung eopl r o oly av to send much time to make them be professional in one specific subject , te aso have to kno a wide rage of knowleg .

To um up , he world nowdys makes youg people to surie by themseves , a he do spend much tie to help other .
The Shakespeare 's path to Russia was rher thorny .
hi is n suprising .
hie William Shakespeare wrote is ays an made h Thspian art to fourish in ngand , in Rusa was very dim and iniser peiod of Ivan IV the Terible 's regn .
So , in Russian print t name of Shakespea is mentioned first in 18 .
First tranations apear in he d of 18th entury , but ths is no Shakespear actually ecause they a made om German or rench n the translators change plot as they wat ( d turn em into som tearjerkers as a rule ) .
For xaple , in ne of he " mlet " ranslations he an sbjct of the play turn out to be e relationsip between Hamt and Ophlia and Oelia in a mantime apeas to be a daughter of laudius ( obously to make amet torte 's completely uberable ) .
It is close to unbelievble , but at rst critis and educated people find Shakespeare de , unpoec and unpatrotic ( shame on yu , bid nd naro - minded peopl !
Once more into te breh ! ) .
But everyhing hanges quite aidly te .
T firs curate translation of Hamlt fm the origia is published in 1828 .
By 85 only six pay has eft non - translate .
It comes to fashion an becomes honorable to translate hakespere .
Russian society gradlly begins appreciating Shakepeare 's sil in porraying geatnes , ept , n complexity of a hum ein .
" The sun of usian poetry " , Alexander Pushin tks h English lessons fr the ae of bein able to read Shakespare .
An h drama Boris Goduov is certainy inspired by Maceth .
In the poetical drama Masquerade by other famous Russian poet ikhai Lermontov we clearly rea Othello 's featur .
An thse are ike nodes on e tre of akespeare 's genius .
Since at time Shakespere as ee on of ur favori rtists .
We lo his simplicity and veracity , we dore his multilcity a fants , we appreciate his straightness and udacity , we ize his delicacy and his funny bone of course !

Finally yeserdy at niht , I was studying in my room whn the doorbell an I went to opnd e door nd uside wa , my frid Matu .
Thi ac took me by surprise .
He wanted to exain to me what was the prblem .
At the beginnig I dd n't wnt to talk with m u on secnd ought al people deserve a second chance .
Al in al , He apologzd ad at e end everything is oved
We go on being friends .
Hello , my name is Sebastian and I wil al out Azl Historico , which is a restaurant in Mexico City .
The restaurant location is in the street Isabela Cat√≥lica numbr 30 , suburb Centr Histoic in Mexico Ciy .
zu Hitoico is a dffernt rstaurant and is loted in a patio of an ol building in the zalo , t type of architectur of the place is colonial and between th tbls r some trees , and this tres covs the diners when ey are eating .
When o r eting yo can look some birds who r in te res , so it mak nusal and different tis retaurant than thers .
he srvice are go , e waits serve excllent , he food is delicious , but some periods of t er the plce is ul of peop and yu ned a reserve or wait a lg tie o a table .
Th ct of the rstauant dises is expesive and the cost is around 150 - 3 pesos .
It is so difficu to chos three bes dishes of the pace but hese hee r so of e bst pical food of Mexico : the " Cochinita Pibil " , " Chicilo Negro " n " Car Encipocada " .
" Carne Enchipocld " yo need to coose the et ( pork tenerlin , beef sea or deer et ) and it is accompanied by a sauce of chile chipotle with poatoes cmbay . "
Chicilo Negr " is a dish ad yo ed to cose some of the hree type of meat ht I ai , but this re accompanied by a ombnation of 7 diferent types of moles oiginatin of oaxaca and h last dsh is the typical " Cochinita Pibi " of Mexico .
If you want a different nd unique restaurant u need to go Azul Historico , bcause it as a delicious food , ome times have a regonal music n the service ar exellent .
If we consider the potentaity of this mens of communication , the televisio would be one of he mos impoant nvetion of ths at century .
On he other hand , despite the numerous ocumentaries , nw ad ultura programs which are passed on every day , aothr at that mst be considered is h incedible amount of the so - called rubish TV , which has bee impacting badly on te younger generatin , and e extreme vilence of om movies transmitted eve during times at should be cnidered as a proeted band o children .
Futhemore I should prbbly mention the enormous mount of advertisements tat evy ingle ay people are frcd to watch on thy ae switched on this bx .
In my opiin , the ral pblem of this potentially useful tool is u to the fact th television is essenially a passive means of communication .
As a atter of fact teeviewes are not able to decide e palipest , bt they still can deci to switch h television off .
Over the pt years , human have rneed an improved scientiic rogess ad hi causes a big change in h fe of every ay .
Fis , technology has radically changed he day ife of a simple family : computer seems to be necessary d in eery house there is more TV than o .
Conersely , wih th latest mdical dscoveres , dotors e ab to treat my of e worl 's diseases .
Finally , with t exploitation of w enewabe energy , huan ha an infinite suce of energy .

The are mny diffren yps of music in the wrl oday .
Why do we need music ?

Music is a specia wrd .
It has it 's own rus , tools and he people wh r spcalized in it .
Over decades usc is e eternally art hic evlop day by day .
We ne music in ost of our tmes or ev ever single ay , to enrich u ays with happiness a joy , nd also to mt away sorrows or deprssion , tha ca affect us and pevent ourselves fr ing te best .
Music is a sciece ! e it is .
Which has many branche n typs , hos ar trditional : owned by any part of the wrld , ad he oter intrnatioal tys ht l people vr the world ae share it .
The traditional or local music of a certain are has it 's thumb prin on the persn of that at .
And te istrumnts used in tt ocl musc may vary from sort to another .
Bcause h people tend to make it fom thr own basic culture .
For example , In Northern Sudan pele hve been usd " Tambor " as a raitional spiritual ool r their sons .
Internationaly , h knds of usc r many , howeve , most of them hae the ame instruments .
In paricula the Piano is a niversal tool that is used by mn musicians as a primary cntoller of e rythm of the Orchestra .
st d not the lat , muic is a srt of tratment to those o a suffering , so rgardles of it 's tpe or ationality it 's a kind of micine to t sul .

The pohibitin and destruction of books has occrred in historical periods as h inquisiton , the knowledge was anipulated by t powerf soal statements such as the Catholc Church ad moarchies since the knwledge throgh bos had beom a threa to continue underpinning their power thin the social pyramid ; therfore , tho pwerful social statements cos what books did not volate their hough in rer to transcrbe them .
lthough , some ideas were mintaind ; ( f instance , h astonomy by Galileo Galile ) e boo - burnng cased a delay in the nowledge beaue if boks wer buned , the knowledge could nt circulate .
Nevertheless , a knowledge revolution ws created with the invention of the printing mobile types by Gutnber ( 1440 ) due to it elmet ae ccess to te nowedge rcvering sigificant books from lto , Aristotle and so on , autors agains political , religious ad soia issues ht srea hei ias to more people beomng awar of the power of the wrtten rd , creating social revolutons uch as the French n American ons .
In addition , it s produced the collecive rading through t ecclesiastical mtod wih he purpose of diseminating e knowledge embodied in the books to all social classs .
On the other hd , at present , eople idenify ather nowledge reoluion , te intene in which the access to the knowege is easer and faster eavng sid bok .
From e aboe , as f as I am conened , hn Frakli Rosemon argues th " books n not be killed by fire .
People die , but bos never di " it depends on t historical time and the technial revolution of tis tme taig into account that that knowledge uprising is always accompanied by a technica revolution whc uppors the etrnce of te infomation ; r instane , in e inqisitin , h nowlede wa limited because it a emoied in books .
ltough thre was an oral tradition , the knowledge was accommodated to the political ad relgous thought of h speaker ; so , t most efcient and objecive wa to transmit te knowede s by books nd it was t possible becus of the burning .
Nonetheless , with t invenion of e prnting ype mobile , e knowledge was different r the aess to it .
If one book was brnd , thre were ten books more witout restriction .
In cntast , nowadays , the bos re ot necesary at al ; bcaus of the internet netork facilitate ve more the knowlee .
That is w ; I culd accommodate te hrae by Franklin saying at " the knowlede can not be kild by peopl because e knowledge is infinite . "

This dseas is no jt bout all t physical and health consequences that have , bt also he mental ones .
A lot of kids grow with a dfferen way to think st because the dmge that e lttl ones can case , one example can be the famous " bullying " , the prinipal way that kid ue to annoy the ons tt looks different .
The best way we cn prvet childhood obesity is recmmendig all te famiies some dffrent docto that can help tem to give a saf if to their children .

Nowdays a part of the people buy a t of thig th ey do n't need .
In is esa we r talking about above all with rich peole .
So money , tday , are really important in our life and in th case rich pple are vy ucy .
They hav much moey to buy thngs th they need , ad things tha hy do n't ee .
So it sees th these peopl can live hpply a eacfully , withu prolems , but this is not true .
In fact bve al about ri families e children e in rouble wth ther fami , abe al whe te have eir arets separated .
Also most of the cildren grw up poiled becse of the large amoun of moey of their amily , and they rw up with th thing that te at more and more things .
t in the oer side here are po people that aspire to become rich .
And the people do n't have money for things that ey do n't need an aso for things tht they need .
So in this case the mny ae or important th oter thigs .
So in my opinion toay we ca n't ive withou oey , but we hav to consider more to fel go th your amily ad wth yourself .

I thik that 50 years ago people culd n't ev imaine wha h life wold be like in our time .
Today , hman civilisain is changing at a igher speed tn an time in th as .
If this ill also be he cse o out future , hen I think that tday we underestimate ou futr .
I am sure onl about oe thing : technologies will ave a me impotant plae in r lives .
aybe in 50 years pepe wo n't ok as we do ow , intea will ild nly robots .
Maybe in 50 years we ill find t how r ran oks d we will be able to creat an artificial inteligenc system that would solve a or problems .
I woul ke to tink that in the ftue we will explore more he universe and we wl colonise ter planets .
Maybe by dong th we would be ae to find other civilisatons nd exchange technologis it them .
I 'd ke to think hat we il find a etho to travel throh the unierse at h higher spds than the sed of light .
I do n't think tha peol will lie forever in 50 years , bt I hope tt the lfe of our children will be better than ours .
Hopefully , I have chnce to be alive in 50 years , so maye I will e t futre with my own eyes .
Peter lokd at s watch and knew that he h to do soethig immdiaely .

Hs mother was working and hi dad w ou of to and hat 's why she ased i to make her that favour and he culd n't s no .
So Peter went home to take is walet b bfre that he decide to tak a nap becae he was ird so he started to slp bt it eded up th he slp for er 3 hou and s moer started calli him at the telephone a h was really any because he forgot to bu e magazines fr i grandmother .
So he wo up and lood at his watch n knew that he had to by thm immediatey or hs mother wud be even oe angry than efre .
He oo his alet d then he ran to b the magazines and after that he went to the hospital to give hem to his anny .

A ANTASTIC FUTU
Will ranspor be different in e uure ?
Certainly it wil be .
u how ?
If we thik about the fture , some sketches of famous movies could coe to our md .
r exaple , we cld hnk aot some od cas tha a fly or bece ivisble .
But I do n't think hat in ten or wenty yeas the scienifc rogrss wl be ale to roduce this type of transport , so we should imagine something simple .
Actully , in my opinion , in h fure the wil be faster transport .
In addition , mean of ransport will be bl to rodue less olltion .
En if nowady people do n't ue publc transport , in th fuure te il .
And ho wll ou way of travelling change ?
In the fuure everone wll be able to go on holiday all roud h world snce the trnsport will be faster nd cheapr .
To sum up , I thik ha ans of transport in h future wl make our lie easier , both when we have to go to wor or to school and when we want to travel .
Transport ill ls respect he environment and natue .
Do n't u thik tha ths future is atastic ?
ine deade a preferred to e another w of transporting than his w ft .
In my opinion , ht was the main eason for wel invention .
Scentists oud provid in h past years new transotation tools fom cycles , automobiles up to moorcycle , motorcars , tains , mers tha has en usd to arrange ad accomplish complete ubic transportaton ne through t same country , and smetmes eceeed it to another cuntr boarder uo an agreement bewen thse coutries .
Many pple assured ha ey are preferrng using heir w cars , but they were beig forced to ue the Public trnspor o an reasos such as , te complexities they are facing th t drive 's licene , in addition to e fu hi os .
They were mo ikey focd than having hoosing it as an option .
e 's do n't forge e hrd ims during cold wather chnges especially in winter while reching the bus stations , or teir low chances of having a ood place to i , ma be another ipotant reaso tha ais h private transport scores than t public one , which is molesttion .

Art / Musi is less iprtant than science / echnoogy .
In my opiion , tecnolog become more and ore imprtat tan art whch be a neceary prt in our life .
Mot of pole in is old ca n't live withot techolog .
As soon as we oe our eyes vey dy , we begin to use ecnology such as alam , cll phone and light .
he mre technology we e he more important it is .
Technolgy maes us ay to connect our famiy , frieds d co - workers .
We ca talk to or family and friens immediately , which is ot mited by space .
I can call my dd w lie in New rk now then call my frien living in orway after irs call .
Therefore , if I studied abroad fifty year ago , I ould n't cl my family directly ad it is also nt an easy jo .
However , echnolgy made it esie t years ago and it became more comon in ecen ers .
It ca n't beiev at we kep in touch with our family n friends not oly vce and message u ao video call , now .
Technology is o of imortant part in r lie , whi has made life more cnvenient .
Before couter w born in ths world , we sed pper to st something which we should afford it could disappear or be ruined by something .
Therefore , we use calculaor to cout nubrs in a few scond .
In th l age we caclated number by or brain tat might lead to me mistakes .
O life a transforme into an easy a by technology .
Bsies , t grandest invention is ntenet .
I sit in front of my omputer nd I cquir nes around e world .
If I am hungry , I could order some elicious food online .
As a eron ai ' ' Sitting er a computer , you will g the orl . ''
It is easier to ontract entertainment wch could releas our stress immediately .
In mern world , stress always disturb our life .
Pressure exist everywhere ; fo instance , yu boss was angry and shoted on u or you shuld careull eal with the relationship beween you and your fater - in - law .
he ou ca n't bathe in your li u nd some ntertainment ; for exape , you can itened mus with your ellphone or watchd some funny videos aer all things that bothrd u .
It ler ur blood pressure and release o stress .
Tehnology enable us to tuh entertainment immediately .
Technolgy h changed our ie in many wys which rings many advantags for us uc as convenience , easy to conect frieds an easr to contract entetainment .
In conclusion , in tese three remises I consider that tecnolog and scien is importan rthe than art and music .
Sciece practical mprove our li .

Why te soccer as een on of t bs sort in the world ?

Watching the bsebal me as bors me .
Sometimes , gm just finished with pitchr and cache 's catch bal me .

Sveral ontents could ve an educative valu , for examp thse concerning our relationships it others , or our relaonship with ntue an with differet cultures and reigins .
All these topics by sin creatvity nd new technologies can be faced in a way to mk them soft and adapt to enterain .

Many yar g I used to go to the cinema every Sunday afterno .

Only th pace was important .
Nevertheless Today I usually go to he cinema when I really an to watc a particular film .
My lies abu fims have chged too .
When I was yunger I would rather watch romantic films . I used to cr when e hdsome boy kissed that pretty gl , or I w watin fr the special omen to say good b to the bd ones .
Nowadays I y to choose films th good actors or actrese , special scrps ad plots , documentary stories or spcial renowned Director 's films lk Almodovar , Snchez Ar√©vl o Alex de la Iglesia .

I trongl agree wth a stateent th shoppng is n always an enjoyable thing .
First , here are often a lot of eopl in bigg ops .
Tee com no surprise tht it is toall difficult to find a necessary thin with a god pic in a defined time through a crod .
Once I remember myself hanging around in the shopping mall Akropolis in order to b shoes in two hour . I did ot anaged to get paricular one , beause of ze , which som shops sudely cul not suggest as well as the quality of othrs d t seem to be valuable for ixd rices .
So , I i o by nw shoe that ay , despite taI s happy for gettg rid of crowd and shops .
Seco , shopping mal hv fu paes of dvertisement and lo songs paying .
Tere is no surpris that a peron viit a i shopping mal fer is ong orking ay .
He is tired nd becase of winter he ers a warm coat .
ht de it hapen ?
He hears different kind of ngs , advertisements for sales an this confused person stas buyg things which are n usefl to m in relit .
The prblem gs after the poblem d a rson starts to feel ck .
Also , It is a well - known fact , that it is ttaly o to be with coat in a shpping mll in wier seasn .
The probem is tt a prso has to cary is at in a hd ner his other urhases , what is ot so easy .
Finally , not every asistan is able to advise o apropriate .
There are soe assistants who if you ask or eve do not k , thy art suggesting the best their products as well as t ms expensive ones to you .
This can ke your shopping rally annying , because some type of people need to chec by themselves in oder to evluate e quaity of pduct .
To u up , shopping is no always an enjoyble hing , because it takes time , it is often fl of eole and a prson can be anoed quikly by incompetent assistants , who eager to ep u by suggesting e most epesive prodct .
So , opping doe not lwys provide good feelings .

MY FAVOURITE POR
hoosin a port to practise is a complicated thing . ou should hoose somethng th you enjoy , bu at the same te , somthing yu can afford to pay for .
As a relt of that , I have tried many sports in my life .
My favourite is diving .
Although you may thik that is a dangerous spo , whih can be , the adrenaline rush you feel when you are in t water mae it wrt the danger .
If o ae oing to start pratise it , I would recommend ou to start taking lessons wt an expert instrucor .
It is er impornt to heck t equipment first .
If a not usd to do it u can make a mistake , an then it is when the prt became angrous .
Aft a few lessons yu wil be ble to go divng on yurself ad enjoy he ensation of freedom ta provides you is sprt .
It is ie you would be solated from the word , us you and te can .
I av to sy that it is one of the most amazng feelg that I have ee el in my life .
I encourage yo to try it .
Without any doubt our life is cange quickly and we do n relise about ths .
ow will be our lf in the future ?
To begin with tis , the main change il be the use of eewable resource instad of fossil fuels .
Nowaday , pepl is are of environmtal problm and they will try to igur out .
Fr example , ll future houses will use slr cls to produce electricity .
Mreover , there will be important thecnoogical advaces in ou lf , li as intelligent mobile phones which coud elp us ith day - to - a task .
Not nly ty will be used to telephone , t we cold ay wit te .
he wil cntrol our empty fridge a if o n ot of ay vegetables , your mbile phone wuld warn yu supermarket ad they would ring it .
Hever , Robots will not eplace huns in th daiy tasks .
So at , we hould carry on dt cleaning or wsing .
Altough , cars il be btte than now , th il o fly yet .
The streets wil be plet of rs in te rsh hou .
To concle , it is imposible to rgue against the ac ta peple 's live wi chage in the nx years but , these hages il help to improve our environmn and u diry ie .
It is ofte said , tat sopping is a lasant procedure bu sometimes it becomes botersom .
Hweer , tre are situations we do ot find enjoyable at all .
I will mentin ome of the reasons h d whe hopping can be unenjoyable .
Frsly , wn we do t have enough ime in he moring to go shopping , we hve to do it in the evening he mo people go d buy hings tey need .
Shopng m ause frustration mainly , when we ha to squeeze through the cowd .
Seondly , soping definitely become unenjoyable hen we are not able to fin podcts we wat and desire .
On the on hand , overspending ney .
Sps s a t of tric ways to encorage peple to u more than ey ed .
Nvertheess , poeole tr to save money by eery conceivale means .
To conclude , we have to know hen and to which shop we ould go to avoid stresfl ad not enjoyable situtios .

sbjet : the transports of my local area
da : 4th ue
introduction :
as requested , i he invetigate h featurs of the an mens of transports which are use in my local aea .
my findings ar presented below .
buses :
buses re the m trnport in my ae .
these are very cheap and people who do not have a ar use it to move everywre . hwever , th transport isnot so comfortable ecuse sometimes o mst travel with lots of people .
cars :
people u tir c fo rvel a ong o hot distance , ts is eall comfortable because you a manage the spe nd where yu ill direct .
anothr option :
wen you are o keen on travel by bs d u do not want get th car out the garage , the taxis a be te bt option .
the e the cmbination betwen buses and your on car .
conclution
I believe that thee huld be more buses fr the comfort of people .
hee are several options to hoose , but the oice depends on each .
My favorite spt is Football . I like it because it is a port ht does n't need a o of means to be play .
In my outry or istance , people starts playing fotball at the vry early age .
The only tng ey ne is to have a ball and a piece of land .
Everybody can pratise football .
The other reson why I like practisin football is because it is a collective sport .
By layin foball , you et a lot of peole of yur age and ake ome frends .
Finaly , football is like al sports very gd fo health .
Playing fotball at a rgular bis helps to minain a god health .
My adce to peop h want to ay footbal is to be passionate , to lk and feel fotball .
As I said , it is not mandatory to hve all e dedicated equipment but it coud hp .
They also ve to rememer tat it is a ge of ontcts .
So , it might cause some injuries .
And for those o lie footbll but are scary to ge injued , they sti hv the oppotunit to watch games on TV and play ideo game consoe .
It is ommon to see dring sumer many people in prks practsing pots , like runnig , biking , or just dig evey kin of physcl actities .
Thans god , I liv riht in e front of one big par .
So , when I wake up every morning , so pushed because I am a ry ctve eron , I get suc a motiation to go ot d do somethin .
I sometimes prctie bing , running , or ven dancing on sday .
I pracse also wiming in my apartmet 's pool , and surfing he I manage to get to the eac .
Bu , t only in sumer I practise sports , oce in winter I patise als f sports , like skiing , snowboarding , nd Ice skating , mog others .
So , when my frends ask me which is my favourite sport , a roblematc decisin coe to my mi , simply because I ie them ll .
But one of the sports omes to to he o of my thoughts re ften : Running .
Why do I enjoy running ? .
I do not ave a quic aswer , but I can slide some deas .
First , running is cheap .
If you want to practise his prt , u can simply take a couple of sneakers , and any light sporswear , and start to ru anywhere .
The is no nee of expensie technical clothes , or special ilds , us u , and a place ae nd with enough space .
Nonetheless , if y really want to t into this sprt as a po , y can get to nvest a lot on clotig and gadgets .
Second , runng is simpe .
Yo do nt need to get y spcial training wen you star to run , you know it since you are a child .
Ta said , rnnng is prbably e easist spot to practise .
Nevertheless , onc u started to practise rning , d want to reall ge it it , ad mproe , I do recommnd you to tae care of your health a to ind professional assstance .
Injuries my happen for practicng it often if y do not ko the w you step , or ou do not take t ncessay ie to et th rsistant tha yu ody neds , for exmple .
Faos people , such as politicians and film stars , desrve to ave a private li without journalists folowing tm l t ti .
The relationship between faous peole a ornalist is an attractie focus on our soiety .
In my oiion , it has t side .
On th oe hand , withut thi career effect , the would as normal as we are .
Famos people need a le , family , entertainment and support .
Sometme , they re happy , sometmes hey are sad
ik we l ow tecnology is making h best of it .
Povidig us neds that in e st were n't .
The oiety is growing and as it gros it gs mr usd to techology bein everywhere .
Public tansport is usd every day by millis of peope .
The mayoty ; youn or old age , since they are n't old enouh or ty are o o to drive .
Driin is t reasn why adult people do n't ed to use as much public tranport .
Te just prfer to travel long or short istance in ndividual transport , nown as r .
Tis is eause tehnlogy ha given us this oportuniy , and as time goes by more nd betr moifications are made to ar .
hih tends to cat r attetion and waste ou money in a wa that c me avd up , in ths casse sig public transport .
Tis is happening now , and we e nt eve fully devoloe in tcnoloy .
Imaine th fuure , will ulic transport tll be use ?
Wl it modify u soity ?
il it be god , or not ?
That is something we have to work on .
IN helpin our society grow , but not too much .
Just hat we ned .

Pad is a sor atiity wee y can eno with other three fiens .
It is similar to tnis but te court is smaller than tennis court .
Furtermore , h cot h walls an the ball can bounce off tey .
Padel is my favourite spor because it is so ea to play or eveyon and it is funny when you play with pople h has the ame leve to yo .
The mo important thing that you have to think when you art to play his sport is that it is a gme ad you sould improve your eve fas because it is an easy pot .

In my opinion , public trnsport has ee mprovd during the last ears , beuse cites has en doing a lt of investment for that .
At g ities , such New York , th mai pubic transport is he undrground , whic is sually fast d ot t expensive .
hee are other ype of pubic transpot sh bu , train or vn planes fo long trips .
I do not agre with the ia wch sy that there is no future f public transport , becase it is a perfect y of ransport for ommutrs an nowadays , a lot of peole is conscius ih the global warmig and the envirnoment , d refuses to s th car every day .
In addition , the fuels prc is icresing uring he lst yeas .
In sumar , I think the public transport is a go a to mov a the number of users is increasing every y .
Clre ,
Tak you for wriing , I w worre about yo .
Firstly , it is such a good news to know tat you ae getin sed to or new life .

PLIC TRASORT .
Nowadas , tavel in public transport has een an eerience w ne has faled .
Howeve , exs no a discussion about wa e people pefr , if the puic trnsport or h veicul of oneslf .
Eis a o of beefts of te public transport , at the start , you do nt have to dive youself , you can litn to music , red a ook o waheve u wat without have to y attention to the traffic , is true o that travel by this way of transport el te govrment because you ve to a it , and th majority of them ae chp enought to eveyone .
However , so uch eople love ave tir o vehicule , a cr , a bick , a moto , because tis giv you her kind of eedom , you chose t w , o chose e time , o chose the way in you drive it , th poitive thi about this kind of vehiule is tht you do nt he to take a bu , for example , crowded of people , you ca go alone in your car , or whoever y nt , bu the imporat is tha you chos .
In coclusio , we can say that every kind of transort hs ther wn pros a cs but in my piion the ifference beten both tis is that in he secon y chose o on style .
Extremadura is a mll plac were you a nt fn many transport types .
irt of all , the most of the peope in Extremadura u the ca r ong to the jb , to university or scol .
Te car is a qick , cap and easy transport since you c use it when you wan and you cn park it her you want .
When you use he ar , y do n have to think in timetables a you do n't ve to pay exnsive tickets f travelling .
Hower , I hik that this transport as om disadvantges , for istnce : if in a small ity thre are a lot of cars , he poluton will ncrese and the environment will be njurd .
Also , hen a ty is smal the people should walk to different places since everything is ner to ou houses .
elatd to the use of the cr , I would lie to a ta the Etremadura 's roa ee a big reparation because , r exmpe , the road bewen C√°cee and Baajo is vy damaged ad it is diffcul to drve f it .
In Etrmadura , the second ranspor os ud is the bus .
On the one hand , thr ae buses th connect the seeal nighbourhoods of the cties with the centre of the .
On e other hand , hee are ses for travelling large distace .
I hink that t uran buses ae mprove in C√°cere .
The last yea , he mayor hange th ld buses by new bses without increase the prie .
Now , it is securier to travel han last years .
so , te seats of hs tranpor a oe clea and h bs driver go saying the name of eah sop .
In the bu sp there are devices tht advice to the pele the minute that they have to at to e arrived of the b .
Finally , in Extremadura the transport eat used is the tan .
T tickt is ver pensive n the tran are vy old .
Hello , dear guets ! We re gla to e yu in or city . I want to tel you about interesting ples in my city .
We a lve in Moscow , it is a very i ct , so the a ma interesting paes , where I us to do som actvit .
That 's why I deide to tell yu about some ntereting place in our cy .

In h winter Gorky Park is vr eautiul and there are ice skating rk .
Everbody goes to it becuse it is e st ie skatng park in Europe .
There a dancing square n my romntic alles , ao tre a toboggan slide .
Guys should t go to snowbording .
I think it is ood plays to oher activities .
I like this park , so to my mind it is the best park in Mosw . You sold go to he rky Park .

I introduce myself : I 'm Ialian wth an obsession for the English language
I ca n't sto studying Enlih lauage , I'm a sort of ' englishaddite , bt I wish I wer an English natie speaer , I do n't kno y .
I 've ee studying English at cool
, ler I took my dere in Modern Freign Languages and Literatures , strting my to d fm England to iprve my skill .
While studying at th Unversity my idea was to move to the UK to work ther , t I got married so I cold n't ealize my dream . !
I found yself teaching English in my Counr , far fm the language competence I was longing for .
I wl never top vistng h UK d tring to improve my seakig and writing sills , tnks to to or he .
4 . Do you lrn more at school or on placement ?
Nearly ery eductio will apply a placement in their eduaion prram , to ge te skills n exprienc of their pupis to a higer evel .
t , is it also tat necessary ?
Whre do you actuall lrn more , at shol or on acement ?
First of all before auing his uestion , it is important to ompar the answers it peop who are on e sa eduatio and school .
Beaus there cn be a ot of differences in he characteristis of thoe tw subjes .
After tat , havin said I can clarly write down my opinion abu this question .
I tik that at my school t baance of hi civil educaon is n't igt d fair at all .
Becase he ubers of theory lesns abou r discipline are by fr many hors less than I expected to get .
his make it neal a coplete sef suy educton , whih should n't be tat wy at this level of schoolig .
So eause of this , the pacemen is always a step ahead to choose o at ti qestion becuse they will teach ou irecly more .
In addition , on placement the things you learn a away focsed on that particular o n company .
So the detal a information th teach ou wll be mor sefu in you ftre career an te random informaion about the sbjets at school .
So this maes it already t agins zero for e placeent .
And finally t third a last reasons why I think you learn more on placement than at scho .
Whn u go to scho you ha to follow lesons whic are off cors useful for or knowledge u , te way of folloing this lsons ae ot a ntural work pattern .
In a natal work pattern y ave to do , also like chool , your tasks but the communication is also an mportant part of it .
his iportant way communication lacs at school , ecuse it 's a nearly a one direction wa of communicating frm te teacer .
You hae to make a es ad te wil give yu a ating for it .
Whil on placement the wr oe in an ealuaing way to improve sills .
So wt the these tee arments all going in the same direction to xplin my opinion at his question , I thn it has not to be explained any urthr now .
Oer the lt ear , popl 's atidut has been hangng .
Te necssty declind that working and ving needs to be firly close to eh othe .
Mnagig long distces seems to be normal owadas .
Moreover , peopl enjy being unbound and therefr , he are willing to ravel long distances .
Hoeve , public ransport as be critised more an more over h last years becaus of its inconenvience .
Se peopl go even so ar d do n't assume tat public tranpot il have a fture at all .
A o of public servics ere cut don in order to save mney .
Therefore , buss r not running as often or reglulary as they sed to .
Especially in h countryside , ubic transpor is no alternative to car ue to e lack of freuncy .
Consequetly , people prefer takng te a .
Firstly , because hy gan indepedence therewith .
Secondly , they a vit each plac wthout n ircumstancs .
F instance , there is no ne to chge the us .
It is alo oe convnent to go to work by ar as ou can leave when it suts o n no ecaus the la bus is runnin .
In additio , the car is ao more convenient in respect of the timing .
Aft hvng had a long da at wrk , peop long to ge home as quck as possible .
Furthermore , icket prices have been inreased rapidly in he as years .
Tavlling by tain as a fail or group is ofen ar more expensie than taking e car .
Nevertheless , public transport sll provides several avantage in comprion to taking the a .
Fo xmple , it is no pking spe requir .
Sittng in th bu an also be quite relaxin , epeially considerng th avy traffic drin rush hours .
inall , it till provides a uefu a of travel for l h do n't ave a drivig licence .
In the end , he service of public tranpor needs to change to attract more peopl nd to have a oseer ftur .
However , it will rema in the future as still an people use it or een depd on it .
T urpoe of thi reort is to nform about how h ci of Grnada ak care of envirnment .
Rubbish ad pllutin
ranada an be consider a cen city as regad of ubish reament .
There are t of recyclin points of plastic , aper , used ol , glass d batteris .
n there is a big universitary communiy involved in recycling .
As for pollution it refs , in spite of to hv a decent public rasport , Grana is on of h worst cities of Spin .
Clen Infrastructures
ow a id , Granad have a eent public transport a ow it is bein impoved by ading a metropolitan train .
Howevr , Granada can t be considerer as Ciclyng riendy , tere is les iclyng roads tha in oer ciies of silar sze .
In addiion , the oldtown is nt as involved as it should be in clean bhaviour , bei the University o mke t iggest effor .
Summing Up
I considerer that Grnada sce 6.5 of 10 about akin care of envrnoment .
There is good points but a o of work ut be done to chive the c - fiedly title .
T mt asorbig lce in my town is bviously the ig Cstle .
It was bil in 1754 a renovated in 2007 and nowadays you can e the ne face of his aming place .
he ou will get to th highest toer , you will watch h mst beathtaing view .
It is a plae where y n alays find lds of torist nd foeigners .
Whn t weathe is goo eough close to the castle take pace any kis of partes d enterinments .
Lie fok dane or shooting with a bow .
Unfortunately , tikes are expensiv ut worh buying . I lso honestly rcommend y to see all the lacs around the ig Cstle such as To Mseum or Folk village .
And ha 's more , castl is situated in th centre of e town it an easy waking disance to shops and park .
I cn assure you wil never get bred with his plae and all hngs things connected with Big Castle will make it memorable for yo .
Ho you will ejo your stay .

I do n't appreciate melodramas or love stories much , t th sould be ad ttentio to .
In my opinion , very few peope use ovie for bradenig th mind .
They are simply laxing by such a way .
That y was a terible y with Michal , he oke up and felt totally exhauted after an overwheling irthday paty .
He even di not remember what s hapeed and a serios adache made h i ot nt to ge out of the b .
His mom was disappointed out that , too .
She even di n wat to talk to m after that situation hapned .
Anywy , he is her son , n sh had no choie ut to take re of him in spite of an situation .
She tlke to him:"H bout yu today ? " .
He did n anwer at l , besides , he h the chair near her , and unfortuantely , that hai hit he in a serious manner .
e eve could ot yell a word , jus looked at im dsappoinedly .
Miche lose t do an knew at ta oment he had made a mistake .
My favourite website is Driv2.ru .
It 's a kind of a ocil etwok , but it differs a bit om ordinary networks .
T im of te se is to e togeher people intersted in as .
In this nework you crate a rofle of you r , rit a li of improvemens you hae doe in it , pload potos and ovis aut ou car ad of couse you eet a lot of pepe with h same inerests .
Drive2 users oftn he a lot of technical uesions about thi cas .
So hy ftn need help of professionals .
I hnk tht it is necessary to involve om professional mechanics to iv advce to use .
h other ebite I often use is Google.o because it is t eatest seaching service eve created by human beings .
I tnk it is the best among other searching systems because of it is very fa d yu get on the informaion you asked for nd nothing exess .
I hink that many googl ses wl be happy if the devlopers bring ore useful inormation to th main pag , for example weather information , carrency rates or ho ws .
Moeover google p servic eeds some improvements such as stret name , map accuracy nd mor city paorams .

Te stuy pointed out th he public trnsprt network in h United Stes has not been expaned sice a long time compared to the sitution in Germany , or xampe .

Suffered the rasport sector in the Arab countries of te many shortcomings n poor erformance ad is a form of environmental polution and hs is de rimaril to a lack of e apaciy of public institutions to develop strteges neesary to intevene appropriately nd alloct investments effectively nd imrove he organizational capacity a rsut

Edcationl institutes should dissuade students .
Howeve , if thre is not lck of h rsurce for e field of tdy , Educational nstitues should suport students r their study area .

As a result , n of my subjects fild because I d not hv enough ie to catch on h esons .
At that mome I flt regretfu a frustrated .

My favourite film

When I am t doing my homework d am not lernng English , I li watchng a film .
Sincerely , I found it very difficult to cose t best film .
Thee r ay interesting fls wi vuable lot an famous actr .
Most of them are extremely interesting n wrth seeing it .
The deserve to be in the top e hundred .
Bt finlly I have dcidd to vt r e of tm .
My favurite actor is m Cruise a conseuently th be fl I have ever sen wa " ar aay , far away " , whee he pls starring ol wt his ex - ife Nicoe Kima .
I wa impresse by t productin becuse of the its alable plot .

Both , they as thoug a lot of dificulties nd live poor life .
The aim of te tw personages was to gai a pec of land in Ameria .
They have taken pa in a competition wth riding horses .
Oy faste competiors was gin te land .
Of course , our tandem gain a ece of land .
Th histoic context is recreated in th im .
I recommend yu to watch this fm and I think you ill no rere .
Mos people in al rely too mch toward tir private vehicles hence hy totally bndoned ublc trnspotation .
We c consider it as te man problem of traffic jam in the island .
They say , " there is no future f ubli ranport , becase tavelling by ca is so much more conenien " .
And for me , that 's totally on sene .
I believe that we can do it he .
In orde to do tt , it wil ost us huge tansformation .
Asd fo a grat blue - print of a well - orgnized tranportation ssem , which vers a good 25 to 50 year planning , it also involves ocal culture .
It is finitely a had job to do whn we want to chag Peol 's uture .
A consience that a cage is neede to ceae a btte plac fo popl to liv houl arise first .
People should be remnded ta 50 to 10 peple travelling in a b will make the traffic so muc tter compared to have each t to four of them trap in cr , in oer wors one msive transportation mesur aains twelve or more cars on the sme road .
The next is an nderstading of wt we an do to nature by changing our transportation measure .
Imagine te energy hat we can kp n olution hat we ca stop .
We can chage , we hae to change for a bete future .
Te wold is constantly changing n tecnology is advancing fast .
This affects people 's ivs considerably , so we an say that in 50 years , the lifestyle will be completely different to what we ve today .
We can s 50 years ago we a nt thout to hve technolo currently exit , such as Iernet , TV , smartphones , c .
lso lifestye s completely diferent , the industry ad n developed echnlogy tat nw alow u to be ore effiient an several people did t wrk o cn be dn wth a few of tem .
So , if technology continues to advance as it a done until no , lfestyle will change too .
Perhaps in 50 yas more , we will iv in a world where technoogy maes ou lfe muc easier , u at the same tim we will be depending on it .

The irst rason is becaue I alreay hve studied here thee years ago and it as a wonderful xperience , I t very nice peol fr all over the world , I impovd my Eglih lvel thnks to very illed teachers nd I eall enjoy my stay in xfrd .
The second is a pragmatic reas I ave a fiv year degree nd I orkd for to yeas in a medical evices copny bu nw I am unmplyed .
In Itl is uite hrd to find a o at th oent d I want to t a wr exerienc in he UK u it is ncessary to become more confidnt with my English and tt is what I ho to otain rom th IELTS course .
I already know that it could be touh , especally to be ar rm my family and my girfrind , t it is something tat I fe cul be right for me , ad for my carer .
The thing hat worres me most is to get use to the English wather !
Public transport is common eans of ransport ud in many countries ; Usualy transport people in mas ro oe locatio to anter ;
However as the counties develop and econoy grows nd ie change , people change ad standards of life chane o ; The interaction factors ha lead people to ae their n a r is depenig nd limtng on severa factors ; There r also factrs uch as social and financial conditions that tend to influence eple to he teir ow r insta to travel by pubic bus / train ; We sould als cosder the coniions of rads , access a taffic , giin an opportunity to people to ot and tvel on w car or public transpot ; In om counties tee are separate lanes deicate for public transport which help d facilitate he traffi on codiion of heavy tafic ; Wth traffic technology solution owning a a is always ettr .
anoher factor we shoud cnsier is the public transport ops on h way to detinaton wih reuire to pn ad atc up public transport to avoid late arrival at our destination .
The subject , no ftur for ublic transport is amiguus as te advantges nd disadvantages are both consider on .

Firt at all , I want to explan the communication with he tow ; a t of pople am by ain , it is situatd at h top of the ow , is he bet travl to yours because it is the most quickly , but proing that o prefer to ome by bs , he bu so is near th rain station .
Ther r many shops around the town , for exaple we ha one that where cildre c ake ted eas whereas the parnts cn se them from the restaunt ; ay childre said hat it s the best lace in he wrd .
F auls we have a little ld museum , ere ou can live on day lke sixt years ag , so If yu never hae ben in one , u hould go ecase it is t cost so much , beses te museum has a kinder gaden fo e id .

Public transprt is a usful way to comute om place to place , especially in big ciie .
Besie t advantages r cheap an fast thee re many disadvantages of taking s or tain such as tie , qaliy of srvig , n crowedness .
it is said that instead of taking puli transport , comuters will travel by car because of s convenience . in my opinion ,
ubic tranort will be rdly replae by traeling by ar .
First of all , Publi transport is ued by many people who do not have ars like students and workers . They can affr to by ckets .
o exape , my student ti , I used to ake busses to go to school ery day and come back ome .
Secondly , The infrastructue in the b cities is ot sufficient fr al the cas .
Traffic ms always hppen in the us hours hn there are so ay cas on he rod .
Fossil fue is running t of resurc .
It akes the ptol 's rice increasing vey ay .
It a been affecting to the environment lke climate chane , incrasing droughts , and floodin aeas thnk to increasing the emnds of using petrol for privae rs .
In conclusion , pblic transport would be t exellent tranportation etho for the increasing demands of commting .
Introduction
The im of ts reot is to examine e aailable lca tansort usg and possible improment .
Curently , t local transor avilabe e buses nd taxis .
Bus in need of rpar
The most used pblc trasprt is the u .
h town is covered with more than thry lins most of thm wit a dupiate performing e same pah on the oposte diection .
Hweve , Bue are mosty used by very oug peple and ol people .
Children ftn ue them to go to and back rm school , ad the older population , with increased proems seeing f away , prefe to s the bus to trave ound e city .
In my opinion , te bigst proble wih bes is that they are becoming ver degraded , nd in deerate need of repair .
os of them do n't hav air conditioning , meaning ta in te summer they are tremendously hot , and ome hav problems wit the windw hat case he b to be extemel cld in wier .
e alternative - Taxis
F t averg middle - aged person the lgical option is to e a ta .
Taxis e aailable throughot the ty , ad an be cale by a simpe phone messge .
The bad side with txis is that they are till vy expensive , wi all te xta tae and different zons .
Recommendation
There have been rmors of the contruction of a Mtro in our town .
at wold be an excellent alternative to the curnt means of trsportation , sine th are fast , are n't affected by trafic , n thy are generally heapr ( ice they rely on electricty ) .
Another oion would be to create a system to rent bicycle ; this has een done in ny cities th great rsults .
Hi Davi ,
hat 's mzing , I just wnte to write you an sms and at th se time I 've receivd an ail ro you !
It 's great that you college mates want to isi uth Bohemia .
I love hs plc so much !
I 'll recommend them lot of jeels tha coul be interesting r them for sure .
Frs of all , if they r tying in ƒåek√© Budƒõjovi , hy can spd there at lat the days ith sighseeing .
Anyway they mt visi our ai sqae with my histrica buildings .
hey can climb on " Blac wer " and listen to siing from he to hall .
ere is a hue number of shops in the centre so what about dong shopping ? Sightseeing in ths town is r tourists very cnveient beause thy n rech everything on ot .
If the weather is nice , th could definitely take a ti to Kle≈• .
It 's h biggst hill wher you can go on the lookut tower ad it 's not fr from ƒåk√© Bƒõjovice .
Tere is an interesting oervatory too a what 's me te best staurant I have ver ben in .
Th must definitely order the bst soup in the word .
T best y to get there is by r .
ƒåsk√Ω rumlo is worth seeing as wel .
Tere 's a peasnt historical cntre d a monumental castle placed on the bg rock .
They can see ere 2 brown bes nd lt of sovenirs shops too .
Yu an ak a bus there .
I hope ou friends'll be satisfied with my ti .
If y ant to kno more about t detnation , ust write me a mesage or give me a call .
A he best , Ivana
The statment given in th rubric proposes an sue of the future of pli transport in dvloped countries .
I do n't agree wi this viewpoint due to several reason .
First of l , ehcles designed to carry lae numbr of pepl can t be unnecessary in bi cities .
Mode megapolises are suffering om surplus of atomobiles .
It happens not ony becase of environmental aspect , t enta as wel .
Regular citizens seem to be tired of eternal traffic jams and ads , filled with parked cr .
Thus , it is absolutely possibe wsh of aveage peon , h speds most of the im in owntow , to replace a ca for a bs or an unergound .
The mn reason is general fatige from the ue number of veicle around .
econdly , taing it account of long - distance trips a not be aoded .
Whatever type of journey o took , ou uld be more likely to prefer using tra or lne , because it oud be mc or cnvenent ad would not eand an physical tension .
Meal one can not be excluded , bt that is e differen questio .
Overall , thre are a nmbe of causes to disagre with he sggestio , that individual ansport is getting more and mor opulr in comparson wit publi .
e ny thing , that definitey should be changed in the fuure , is an approach to usage of cars poered by asolie .
ear h Roquetas Concert ll , it cn be fon a Japanee restaurant nmed " Ichiban " , opened a few years ago , it 's not ll known yet , but th does n't prevent that quickly ges busy at the weekends at lunch time .
Although somtime it might be rather noisy , becaue of he peple gtered hee , I find it dor quite attrctive ad , as usual in ths kind of restaurants , elaxing .
e staff is charmig , helpful and pleaant as well .
However , it might be that you had to wat a wle f your food to be served , bt wor it .
Y can choose fro a varity of dishes in their menu - sushi , ki , " ec .
Different kinds of sshimi are ofere - of mackerel , a as , ocops , utter fish .
The sashimi of salmon is my favourite one .
I ae to mentio he soups , especially h seaood up .
Delicious !
It desers to be mntioned the gret variety of rc n noodles - with chiken , ef , prawns , vegetables .
All dishes ar served with a careful presentation , are igly creative ad er attractive to he eye .
A egative pit of the resturnt , in my vie , is t lack of a dessert me .
As a concusin , I recmmend visiting " Ihiban Rstaurant " , you 'll have the cane of njying a delicious mel in a certainly greeble atmosphere .
Reflectiv Writi
I ae dne to te reponsibiliy for my n learning .
Indepndnt larnng has bcome an indispensable pr of nishing teriary - lee education successfully .
However , taditonal teching method , oce - feed the studens , hs me me overly dependent on tchers in hia , which has ld me to folo teahers indisciminately .
Compared wih A course , it tn to be taken responsibiliy for finshing assessments independently , especially r academic writing .
Firstly , it was too difficult fo me to ad in assessments on tim , because I used to spend too mc time on playing gme without techer supervision , so ha I alays d ot have enough te for finishing academic assgnments independently .
By this tren , I hve became a procrastinatr fialy , which enabled me to fce th problems of tim managmet .
In tis see , e tm , " te magement " mens he biliy of otrolling time on pioritizing tasks , and planning effetive scedulig of me to balance stuy d work , nd kepng concentration on motivating yourself to learning towards a goal ( Academic Skills Unit , 2012 , pp.22 - 25 ) .
Develop a srtegy in studyig is vitl .
Rowh ( 206 ) states o will say up late for accomplishing assessment efre he deadline is due without planng in advance .
herfore , he best way is leaving 30 minuts everyday for eadig and beginning to ea at ne .
Based on xamining my atul experience and reearc , I noticed that a gap , unsuccessu time management in indeendet earning is the root case of these problem .
Then I mde a w conscious canges tt I began to manae duration for finihng my homework ahead of some wks , as wl as stopping procrstinaing in th most importan ares of my ie .
As an independn learner , it is my sle reponsibility to autonomic learning , which is a very iortant actor in future passing EAP1 successfully , as well as ivin me an advantage in terms of coping with te callengs of future chelor of Nursing in ustrali .
The mot istrical lace in Span , it is t ty of C√°ees .
It is in the south of pin , there h wether is warm .
C√°ces is visited for an ourist every year .
Moreover , hee a mny things to see n do here .
At th eginning of th th century , C√°cers as conqueted by the Aras .
Te spent ie centuries here .
At the nd of th 14h century , C√°ceres as conqueted by the Romans .
Therefore it is a multicultural n multiracia society .
On the other hand , C√°ceres are dvided in two ain reas , the new city , which has modern ad ig buildings .
As well as the itorical ity , it is short n arows streets .
e center of the historical it is the Big Square , there are mxed Arbs and Romas buildings , and w cathedrals .
The ms iporant palae is Jorge 's palace .
orge wa a nd , ho on an importnt battle gains Ars .
To sum up , if I have to recommend a plae , I ill recommed C√°cer .
Fo several reasons .
In the rst pace , peple r really fun ad friendly .
In th second plc , you would lear he histoy of pain on thse streets .
In he third place , this year C√°ceres is he capital of he gastronomy in Span .
My favrite restaurant is Chinnese .
In ceres we n t Chinnesse food in Food use .
Some peple do n't lke this food , but in ts restaurant ou n e other ypes of oo , for eaple Spanis od and Mexican food .
The atmphere in ths restauran is vey od and very cln .
This restarnt is very big , we wou n't ave a probl .
Waitress and waiter ar very friendly and funny .
Thi resturant is ufet , we aid 15‚Ç¨/pero ad we a eat d drink all ta you want .
Fom my pot of view , this restaurant have one drawback , th waters and aitress do n't go on the tble , you sould go to yu od and drink .
I love tis restaurant , th food is very delicious .
In this e of materials , the listening pssge dicusses advtages of alhol and h hey contribute to improve heal , ad personality and te reading contradict this by evealing own sie of it .
In the listnng passag , the professor discusses the advatages of alcoho and hw it helps to educe har attak ad stros by 40 percent , u to the fat that it redue blood clot , n slowing the deterioation of brain funcion .
In ddition , moderate dinking hlps to eep healty movment , becse som researches has sown ta people o drink moeratly have less proportion of body f , because alchol speed up metabolism wch mkes calories bur quiky .
Moreover , it is stated ht peol who drink moderately have poitive social behavor which means that they are more likely to establish cntact an nn - drnke , and they are re social , popar and they are likely to be married .
On he oter had , te readig contrast this by mentioning disadvatages of alhol .
Firstly it is stated ta alcohol lead to wight an , because it s more clories per grm an any ther dink , a it is menioed in e passage that you need to wal a mie to los caories of gas of wine .
Furthermore studies hav sown ht acohol induce appetite which makes peopl consme more tan they need .
or exampl reearchers ave found that belly fat is related to alcohol .
Secod , alohl can caus sm serious helth issues , especill cirrhosis of th live , eat filre , brai damae and variety of cancers .
hir , alcohol takers tend to aggression and violence .
In fact studies shos that 86 peren of all homicides and 60 pcent of sexl assalts , are linked to alcohol
Wi the development of globalization , there are vrities of impacts or different spects of daily life .
Pepe als have a discssion of ts advantages and isadvantages .
Ths essay will dscrbe bo psitive a negative influences of transportation in Chin by ome examples .
Firstly , thee is a benefit of globalizatio tt popl can buy some special products from varios countries on te inernet instead of buying in e production si .
So transportation of goods has become an imprtant link for bot e pblic and busnesss .
In recent years , there ar some dffeent size of logistic mpanies he been hold , n different modes of trnsprtation a evelope rapidly .
F eample , in e as he an transortations were hps , trains and trucks , so people had to wat ong tme for thi parcels ad letters .
Hwver , now th increasing nubr of consumers a logistic opanies has chose airplanes which an save much te to ransport their arcels .
Secondly , thre is sill a disadvantage of globalization on transportation in ina .
The reaso is ha the development of globalization has et o counry improve its economy .
However , becaue of he increasing standar of liing , a rowig numbr of people have chosen to ravl which has broht a havy presure of trasportaton .
So in order to transport a hue number of visitors wh r not on foreignes but so nativ people , the govermnt d experts have to tink om diferent ways to solve this roblm .
Fr exampl , som cties lik Bejig ad angzhou hav to limit the number of ars whch cm for traveing to decrease te pressure of transortatin in igt spots and it centre .
In conclusion , globalizion on h transportaion as brought th psitve and native effect to Chinse eope .
So in my opinio , peol need to fid ight ys to let globaization puh the standard of or living wherea discussing t advantages and disadvantages .
Ba is a mall vllge of Itay an it is als my tow .
Bra really takes care of th environment .
If yo visit it y wi probably appreciate al th innovations applied to save u environmet .
F example all the membes of the town couci use ies so they are a good exple to al citizns .
So if you wat a bike , to moe easly , you have to ke a ar whih allow you te access to a bis sitate in pecified places in the city .
In my town ca do n't pollute .

I think if we want to protect our envionment starting from te little thigs .
Nowadays it 's vr imporat to be biligual .
Spaking just your native langae is no enough to work or to tavel .
Moreover If you want to find good j yo must abl to speaking two or three language without ay problem .
You sold speak accurately and alo fluent .
I know to spe tre languge .
My native languae is atlan ecaue I 'm om Vlenca .
Also I nw Spanish a besides I 'm learning English righ now .
I 'm livig in Worcste oe ity rom England .
I 'm au air .
The last year I w in Poland and I could see how a important to speak English , wh this iim ou ca communicate ith oer pple , no jt English people if not with around the world .
When I was a child I di n't understand why I eedd to arn glish but now I ca see how impoant it is , for hs reason I 'm motivated to learn .
On the othr han I love traellin and in cse tht you know several languag all will be easier .
You ould understand te guide , h sign ...

On he contrary to arn language te a long tim an y ne to be patient .
Morver he languages curss ca be expensive in my opino te best hin tht you ca do is move into other county it would be easer to stay motivtd beaue you ned to learn it to ind a job or to make frins .
As f as I c s , it 's imporant to know languages no just your mothr lagage .
I encurage everybody to learn languages .
It old be nice an gie o more opportunity to do whatever you nt n do n't lose heart at e beginning oud be diffcult bu bit by bit you will see your prgrss .

Howvr , as a residen of h country , we a not forget bout he history a about o ancestor srvices rendered to t naio as el as r cultur and ideoog .

Today , I will mention about one of the ioic places of Vietnam which you can n mi when travel to Vietnam .
It is Temple of Literature , t irt uiversty of he ntion .
Tmple of Literare was buit in 107 nde te Ly 's dynasy .
In spte of wr ad h destruction of im , Temple of Literatue is tll preseved in good shape until now .
We a still see an anciet trctures which show the main trend of architecue at tha time .
As mn other Asian country , in the st , we were greatly nfluened by th ideology sysem of Confuius , a philopher from Chia .
He blt up a system which baed on 4 essential reltionsips in the society .
Te lessons that scholars at that tim were received , most of the re about his idology .
Oterwise , hey learned mostly abot literature , poetry .
We can briefly desibe th overall trucure of Teper of Literature which consists of si parts .
Frtly , hee were 3 main gates , he center one ly f the kin , e lf ie one was or administrators , h riht site one was fr miitar .
Scholars only could enter by a small gate from asid .
Ten the are five courtyards from h first o to he ifth one fo outside to inside .
O remarkable , featured point about Temple of iterature is the people who passed 4 rounds of xaminaton , the gaie osition titles would be graved their nams on e stone gre carried on sone turtles .
Right at the momen entering , you can se tem fom two sids of te courtyards .
Temple of Liteature is a holow ace r studts evn no .
Bfore th university entrance examinations , may students come he and wh for ter lck .

Dear Ms / Mr ,
I am wriing in regard to th environmental prolem u e rsearhing .
Firt of all , I am gin to present to yo some gnral inforation about th environment in our village .
- Our llage s only 200 ctizens , therefore the amount of rubbih prodce in year is isigificant to e environme in our aea .
- There in a recling facility nar our village and 80 percent of the rubbis is being recycled .
- 60 percent of the houses in h village hae slr panl .
Secondly , I am ging to info ou on how our citizens e tryinq to keep he aea ean .
- There ar cleaig ampgnes twce a year .
- her ae separate rubbish bins for plstics , metal a glass in the hole aea .
Lastly , I am oin to explai how is our vilae kept attrcive .
- Lt yer tere as a campage for renewing and repairing th most tractive pas of te villge .
Al the important buildings n monuments had bn cleaned and repainted .
In conclusin , I ould say th our village is an example for enironmentally conscious iy .
I he this rprt infmed ou fuly on the envirnmental ituaton in ur villge .
Sincerely yours ,
Kina Yevtuhenkoa .
Rept : How Budaest takes are of its environment ?
It 's ver ha to organise a big cit 's rubbish delivery syst d to keep th city cle .
In connection wth the fst isue , udapest compltes the task vry wel .
In Bdapest h rubbish is collected saretely .
In the n ildings there e sally utbins fr each material ( glass , plastic , etc . ) , and around the older buildings there e more and mre sparte dstbins .
So , lmot erybody , who lives in Budapest , has te chance to u this orm of rubbish olection .
It woul be loica th we reycle the garbae as much as pssibl , a there are factories , where he use hi technique , but in Budapest we usually do n't use muh recycled goods recently .
And it is a serious problem , becau in t n so distant future we wo n't be able the handle th garbage - it wo n't be enough space where we could deosit tht .
An anoher ( ne coul say e most ) important quesion about a apital city is : how can is it ?
In tt area Budapes ccomplishes vr awful .
In spite of h numbr of th cleaners , e ow is dirtier th Vienna or Prague .
Nauraly it 's mainly epens on us : if we could u our garbage ito the dubin , instead of letting it on th street , it wold be easier to keep it clean .
Howev , it woud n't be impossible to colct e rbish a cla th stree mor often - it 's just a matter of organisation .
Since yoga entered my life I y to change my common iw of many things .
My liesyle is amn them .
cologial situation is eriously ba not only in my city bu in my country in general .
Rubbish ecycle is e biggest poblem in Kyyiv in my opinion .
Al the rubih is taen to the uge dump a w kilometr off the city .
What a smel !
ut peopl mostly do n't ce about it .
We eep on generaing ubish and using harmful hings .
till we use plastic bags an bottles , phspate dergents , throw bateries away .
Not to mnton diapers ad sanitary towes , aper apkins and any otr things .
Unfortunately we do n't sparate rubbish .
Can y imagine why ?
Bcase recycling is harly developed hr , in Ukraine .
Thr 's no fctorie a plants to recycle all these materials , though we 've aledy got seial yello bn for papr and glas in the cy strees .

e fact ta " shopping is n always enjoyabl " might be considered an universal truh .
Although it is true ha shopin might n be a vr intresting toic , it ms be sted th it is necessary .
There are any diffrent kinds of shopng : e.g. clothes , goceries , furniture , instruments , t .
It a depends on what you ae about to buy .
When it comes to clothes the ae also different kinds of peol , the ones wh do it or necessity and th ones wh do it fo joy .
T forer might not be so ejoyble whist e atter , obviousy , does it for enjoyabe urposes .
Groceries and furnire , as well as instruments , folw the same paten .
It all depns on h tp of peson buying it , their personality ad a wide age of other haracteristcs which wl o be covrd o .
In lt pac , it is undotedly influenced by h pce in which you a buying ( i.e. the oom , th organizaton , t prie , h distance , etc ) and he unknown people who are in it which may cus trobl or facilitate your shopping and ke it more enjoyal .
These factors will be explained in another occasion .
In conclusion , shopng might be both : enjoyable or not .
In order or it to happe , a range of diferent variables av to take place .
Although there are a lot of people o trogly believe he bet way of raving arnd the city is by motrbike , there is so a big pat of the society who is sre it has too many drawbcs to be worth buying e .
Owin a motorbke s advantage .
ne vry mortant positive aspect is that , hanks to h small amount of petrol it eeds , the keeping of a motobike is considerably economical .
In addition , as it is smllr hn a c , parking ecomes much es complicated .
Besides , or th same rean , it is easier to avoid traffic jam .
On e other an , motrikes do als have drawbacks .
For eaple , th lc of safety , which raies the probabilities of gettng hrt if an ccident occurs .
Another disadvantag this kind of vhicl has is the ow nuber of passengers who can rave on a motorbike consequently not everybody fin it convnient or cmfortable owning e .
In conclusion , oing a motorbike an be useful or useless dpening on th lifestyle you have , yu ecnoic status , n th numer of peole you nee to travel with .
He yu ve ben in trouble , which type of transport you should take ?
I a , t !
Let 's imine : you an chse betwe plane , tin and oat .
If yo mus come a og a , hen yu 'll robably o r travelling by plane ...
It 's a good iea , but ... I 've got an aviophoba !
It mks my ever journey unplasnt ad I feel uneasy ll the week before te flight .
But excludin cases like ne : lying is he fastest , t ms ae ad ofen e cheapest way to travl .
We can take a ip by boat .
But this mode of transport is n't so cofrtable , esspecialy hn we must travel onshore , then it 's complicated because rvelling by boat is allowed only by te sea or ay szeabe rer , hic oures r usually plaed ls conveniently thn rod or ee ailway acks .
In ha case it indicates that my faouite way to travel is rain !
For me it a so very impornt adantags , like tht ou do n't and in traffics , reductions r tuents , low risk of acidens , otentialiy of slepig , eventuality of travllin th bi or othr big luggage .
ost railway nes r quite spruce and for me , travelling by tain is pleasure !
In my pinion , everything depending on our preferences , bt ran is general - purpose mes of transport , I rcommnd it !
My favorite sport is adminto , whi I have plaed for eve years nd touched hi spor when I wa in junior hig .
At first , I 'm nt intereste in it , since I did n't any idea ho to play , as I ha only playe basketbal a volleyball , however , I dd n't njo the two at all .
Morove , I ao did n't like to do exercise whic was tied and my strength w exremey weak that eery time wen measure 800 kilmetrs I always raned e at thr .
But wen I ecidd to it asid d catte it my riends , ne of my mle friends , o has sil kept in touc at resent , asked me to play toethr .
After he o te reasn hy I id n't ave y desie to play , he told me to give self a try , d if I sil did n't like it , he would't foe me .
Then , he taught me ho to play , for exampe , he hitting , used t stregth of e whole arm n di nt just used elbo , or yu old feel tired shory .
Whle playing , I rejoiced at this exercise , because I ve never swetd so much and felt refreshed efore .
The funniest thig to me was that I thought I wer a ki who tudie kindergarten o the way he tauh .
Whe hitting bll back successfuly , he would say ' ' good , ep going or you d it '' .
Hitting ball gain and gin , I learned I lov badminton unconsciouly , wih not only inclde runnig b also concntating .
adinton is an easy sport that everyone an ty , js focus on al n hit it bck .
In adtion , bore playing , must wa up your body and rlax ur muscle aftr plying in case suffered injuries .

The orld whee we live now is more sutable for ong people , as may could sa and prove , evn toug , in so ountries , oder people can ave a ecent li withu depending on young eopl .
nfortunately , t reality mpel me to ait that yun pple hs more opportnitis to eno life because of l the technological advance tht older peple ted to o unerstand well .
Als , bcaue of the fact tat the urbanizati hav n helped st contres to adp the cities ino places moe accessible to senior peple .
Th e technologies are somting that we can not love wihut aymore .
But , unfortunately , the e gadgets can be ry difficult to mnae or master , secially for he part of h population who did not lear bot tem while they were hilren or student at th univrsit ( lder people ) .
I am one of the fortunate people ho was brn on the technological era , wich eans ht I he ha access to computers , gps and mbiles , for example , since I ws a lttle child .
The technological euipmnt help me in my dail life in a w th I can no nger tvel or even cmmute in my city wihou hem .
The fact that thse utensils are familiar for youth make them helful and useful .
On the other hd , to someone h did t have thes whe hy wre more yung and aciv , such as grndmothers a grandfathers , he new instruments ar just things hat they a not se nor understand .
The olde people e limited in their abilities to us tecnology at cold be valuable to provide enjoyable time at hm , on the street , in a museum , c .
nother transformation , whh is orolary fm the advans that hmnity hav ee seng lately , is t modification in th cites d or livg abits .
Sice la century , the wold population is more present in e bger cities , whch , as a reult , hav en increasing in size nd in problems .
The urbanization mplemnted by govrnment coss e decades in te cities e ometimes o suitabe fo ll public .
or instance , older people or th nes wi disabiliti have great difficult to use t metr ytem becau of the numbr of stairs .
My mother is a perfec std of case o me beaue she c nt wel the trasporation system in Prs or New Yr wihut en lo and very tired frm all e walking tht sh ha to do wen comming .
Th mobiliy of older people is ertainl reucd if compared wh a yougr rson .
ometimes , he lk of solutions to the reduced capacity of movemet arund on big cities compels the oer population to ty at home .
In this case , they do ot have t possibiity to go u ad eno h benefits hat cities may bring to ther lves .
Therefore , the new technologies ad the transoration in h cties re er beneficial for he younger part of th populaion who is capable of understanding w to mnage h moden instrumen an se all kinds of transportation .
On t other hd , for the older pepl , the modernsatio that we eprience is an obstacl for hm to enoy a that there re out there .
The Active Leisure lub
Introduction
he ai of this report is to give my opinion aut the facities an services e Active Leisure Clbs .
Faciliies
In general the facilities are ell preserved bt e majority of the users think that the insallation shoul have an improemnt in the basktebll and tennis ours maybe he bathroom should be rmodelled .
Advantaes
The ub is locaed in th cy centre and it 's vey clean .
e orkers a very in n simpaetic a enjo teaching .
In oter words I could ay that is t best Clu I know .
Desadvantag
The atiities are expensive .
I beliee tt it woud be a od idea to fall in the cst of some activities .
Curioly the ub is losed On Saturday evenings and on Sunday .
However , the majoriy of usrs want to us te Club at weekends ad to sped eir free time he .
Recommendations
It 's recommend imprving h faciltie , falling in te pric and opening every ay unti 10.00 p.m.
Snce car s inventd , we have been seeng a lag icrase of car ' pruction d of is use .
In early das , pbic trasport sstem was n't vey efficient , as it wa in its beginnig .
Tere were few uses n tey would ak to lon , terefoe witng time s uite high .
However , as ime ent by , improvement s been mae in public trnsort .
Nowadays , they got modern and comfortable and te e n't as late as hy se to .
Travelling by a igt be more pleasant but it ca al be costly , o fuel can be ver expesve depending on the current economy .
ith regards to rafic , tavellig by public transport can alo be quicker , as there is a bu ae d no traffi o tube .
Hever , vr the past years , peole ha been travelling mostly by car whic seems to have led to higher level of air polutio .
This is undoutedly an important envirnmental issu ht shul dfiniely have o attention .
In spite of l cmpaigs aiming the ess e of the r but more of t publc ransport , people still se to prefer to travel by cr .
Celebrties an ther life take intriic place in lifes of contemporary peole .
h procs of becoming this ac rel and common in ur ocety bgn abu 100 ars ago and wht is really absorbig , naly 95 percent of advance ocety can not imagine the wor wihout an ki of information about famo people an their exitene at al .
Te question is if it is god to take a leaf o of their bok n I am going to alk around it .
It is good to have your ique ale sytem , u t stories about people who have een ding goo affects you a your fture decisions .
Probal if y hear about heroic attiude you wil be able to do wihout doubts somehing magnificent as ell .
In hs way I thik tht is od to look up to some celbriies who are righteous .
The second thing is tha if y are in trobl you 'll eel beter hn uual becae of well - known drama ased on factual stories ich happened to he famus pople .
How th English say : bett the devil you know .
Thee re angrs wich appear ecaus of overhining about stars and comparing yourself to them - it is called low self - asesment .
Even if u would like to be up to date with the last nws from celebrities ' privae life a professional career o have to remembr th he dia istort reality .
If soethng is n't atchy will not cach the poele attnion .
The press editors often ater detis heeupon tey get selling wel mteria .
If you beiee tht he mda says true you are wrong .
To m up , I blieve hat it is really imortant to strike a balance and keep it during your whole life .
Of course you can loo up to t celebrities but o have to be aware of te consqunces .
ach kind of uiing light help us , ut the mot importat is to cose the righ d accurate prson .
INTRODUCTION
e aim of this rport is to escrib Scedrin 's Schol of arts f hildrn and uth .
It is o of e best places in our tow where teenagers can develop their artiti skills .
GOOD POINTS
The school prodes lo of different activities o those h e intereted in muic , draing , dane and theatre .
tudents are taught by the highly qualfed taff .
Mre ha th , ll the clsss re fre .
he atmosphere at school is very creave .
Durg the whole school ear a reat nubr of exhibtios , concerts nd performance re iven by pupil themselves nd by invited mucians and artists as ell .
BD POINTS
The worst thing about e school is at not evyone c be aceted to study there .
Children ave to take ntance examination .
T othe thing is that students are not al to refuse aending om clsses the do no like becas those e consideed to be a pa of an educational standard for the particular artistic aea .
ONCLSION
It is deinitely wothwhie to study here , alhouh it is advised to let students choose the activitis ty prefer .
penmenon of homeless pepe became a serious proble ad ma couries a not solve his probem .
he number of these people is increasng nt just in e veloping countres b l over e rld .
In my opinion , homeless peoe re vicms because nood want to iv wihot a shelter .
First of all , being witout home is a horrible prblem .
One of the major reasons for his prblem is ws especially in the Arab countries ke Sia , Libya n Yemen .
Everyday on news We se t refugees wh are in a ierable condition .
Te iv in tents hat do not protect them of cld wathe or dangerous insects .
They do not hve enough fod .
In addition , finacial crisis , amst of h cmpanies hs a financial probem so he idal olution for them is downizing .
ftr a hie the people who are lid off wi not ve enogh money to liv , and hy wil become omeess people .
Furthermore , children street is a result of familis troubles .
Cse of divorce are increasing n an children scpe and prfer to iv in t treet instead of om ll of problems .
As opposed to he idea above , some peple believe that homeless people are criminals and ey ause danger on r society becase they ne moey and food so they ca ste or ll fr this .
To conclu , the world has a complicated issue , so Te governmens and t chartale organizatin must take a quick decision and put a ra solution to sole this proble .
he homeless peol r human beings d they must tak eir rights in lif .

i ther sportsmen ae haing like minnow groune by chance .
I must be lokin ike them from the side .
Everyone 's nervous except fo Jerome Tanny , last years champion fmou fo i threatening pretart grin , that we all cal " hark 's Smil " .
Tany is a uman - rocet ta 's rming up on a neihbor track line .
I no tha my old man avarro is th one to he sweaty hand now !
Evn from here I can see h anxious look and the way he 's fidgeting on a bnch .
Tat 's stane but before the sar my thoughts as if an l stm locomtiv are ong to those dehs of mery whih rall hrd to get to in ordinary life .
ing to t ncreas of opulation , humn beings use more land to build ouses , hich lds to h decline of forest rat .
The large - cal building projects do let human have hoe , but nt the animals .
Tusands acre of forests to be destroye , ltting h climate chnge .
Our cities t f to uh carn dioxied , mking t gobl warmer .
Tus , the winter ecomes colder , d the summer becomes hotter .
Te hnge of climate leads a lo of terrible thing to brakig out .
h flod , drougt , and famie , a of hese makin geat efcts to hman and anals , fo insnce , the loss of properity , the missing of people , which is no god fo the deveopment of umn beings .
For one ing , animals do ot have hme , so som of them become endangeed spcie , ore still , dying out .
For another thig , human will be ard to get cose to the ntre , and te nose of cities will do harm to hum 's health .
I think that efforts ms be taken quily to protect r homes by goermnts .
Firstl , the population should be controled , if human stl increase rpily , there is no more om f human .
Seconly , governments shold teh tei people how to prtct the environment , suh as destroying e armlan too muc is a bad choice .
Thirdly , rseves shod be put up to ovide room for animals , d we c hel th endngere aimals in hs way .
ially , governments should ue the space properly , like mang pans eore st up building , esimaing he effects to umn an aimas .
Ysterday , I wa asked to wrte an atcle about my favorite port .

Most people would sy that running is jt te mos annoying sport ever .

Running ees ou fit in t as as yu get our body a you mind active n healy .
Going fo a u is t bs a to get your mind ee ad to hink bout nothing .
Moreover , yur bran gets oygen and yur by ges movement .
Yu blood is ow able to circuate easily through our aes .

Running il ee be my favorite sprt !

In our oern life moey has always ee pesented as something really iportant .

My opinion is at a minimum of money is only necessary .
This houd be enough to feel u happy lik a cfortable blnket dos .
It sart with your wok life .
At this moet yu ned moey to acquire the necessary to build an hpy li .
Without enough money you ill ot be able to be in good shape to work .

In conclusion , I 'm pretty sure that yu do n't nee muc money to be hapy .
You nd just the ncesary to get an happy long life .
Te rbn myth hat statues could move makes the contmporary pepl frightened .
And e Doctor h , Si - Fi TV series of BBC , exteriorid this terror from the Weeing Angels .
They ppared fist in Blink , e of te Doctr Wo episodes .
ter Blin was brodcasted , it rised cmon fears about stats to tele - iewers in Britain and over the wld .
According to the recent pols in 27 and 212 carried ou by the British magazie , Radi Tmes , the eeping Angels wr picked as th os scriest villain of the Doctor who wice by about haf of respondens .
Thee esults e interstng ecaus Weeping Anges are n e old advrsaries of octo , lik the Dale exterminating a organic ad norganic thing in t wole uivese or t Cybermen tansformig all living thgs into cybor .
Thn , what akes e Weeping Angels frightening ?
To igre t the factors , uanny thory is sed .
Uncanny theo explains an uncomfortable sesatio oriinate fom perceving something famiir as unfamiliar .
This ird felng is especially caused by experiencing something dead or non - livin as life - likeess .
In Blink , Weeing angels ' uncanny traits and awkwad backgrounds in the drama ma audience ave a scary d unfamilir sensation .
It is hard to read te Weeng Angel ' thoughts and motions om their ash - pe fce .
They look unnaural , in spite of thir similar appearance ih human .
Usually , th tend to hide thir face , since angels could not move ee when they watc each oher .
And expresions in their ees are coletely lacklustre , d to the eficiecy of pupil .
Also , thir facial expressions are almost flt as dad an .
hese factor make angels more grtesqu psycho - pass assain .
Then , it seems tat these stutes migh le their spiris , oly wh they got our gaze .
By the wa , th exterior traits of Wepin Angels are o nough to ak ople scared .
But hen it comes to their interior actor , the uncnny feelings are maximised by turning unconscious hysiological reaction into cscious ne .
Te angels move and ttack free , only we people blink their eyes or turn aond ther sight away .
However , eole blik their ee several ies a minute nd th a hardly awre of bliking .
Afer he Dotor 's warning , they ma not ur r back , look awa , an blink as we r protagoniss of the episode .
Beause it seems ie , if we do tat , agels wl come t fm TV a attac us !
Te , strangely , blinking r eyes becomes conscious behaviour .
oreover , there ar good scene ettings to make eole not link by immersing audience in that situation .
In several sces , eeing Angels , the lonely assasin , never shif their positions and postures , vn though proagnists ad sporting players bink , lk away or turn their backs .
Why do tey not me , ev if their prey is near ?
The reason is that TV viewers watch the simultaneously .
To chnge the po of the orific statues technically , dircors hide te anels by actor clsig a openi the dor or conceal the angls behind the actors hrough anning cameras horizontlly , f a mmen .
At at , directors fad ot the cees flickig o e lgt bul in basment for maximizing the threat of Weepin Angls !
At st , Blink fills people wth dread bou the circumstnces the ie in by fling unfamiliar .
After Saly , e heroine of Bin , takes e TARDIS k awa fm Weeing Angels in the derted hose , he hadw her quietly , as if ey might be lad ter for a ln ime .
Fo instace , h anges camouflage temselves as monumet of tomb in grave yad , carvings of the cathedral on h streets , and ornamental carvings in rnt of an antiqu police office .
Consequently , it ake audience nfamiliar with hir circustances .
Then tle - vieers are rrified at the basis of their iveihoods a ople grab up bankets tight !
Ann knew that it was oing to be a ery speal day o her .

It sems at he st popuar sport in h whle word is ooball because it kee all people united so that is y I ove is sport nd t oy because of that , bu it makes me feel very excted and it involves a o of emotion as well then Do yo enjoy watching or playing footall ?
Surprisingly wen y ae rcticing hi sport ou prove yur velocity nd coordination too , so it could be an nteresting point to taking up if you ar not involved in it .
Personally what I can sy is tha pracicig hs sports make me feel strongly lively and n nl we I am playing it , it als hapes when I am watching it especiall drin e world cup .
Curiously her re mn way f taking ae of yurself when you are taking up ths sor so hat I advise you to do is do some exrcise befre y go in the itc , so it not onl prevent yo to suffer from spraid or othr kind of ijuries u minain yu acie to keep your am lel .

In Japan , thr are many rue re st in the Seto .
Te are usually aiing to avoi the hygienic prblems .
Potential ssues suc as rule vioaion ad confits a be ros bcause the foigners y t unerstan the rules .
apanese , as pintd ut by Trompenaars ( cited in Morrison , 20 ) , is highly nfluenced by the vlue of universalism .
Similarly , the hg leve of uncertainy avoidance ad the low level of idulgence ( ofstee 1994 ) cause the Japanese society seems to be obedient nd self - disciplined .
The mn reao or Japanese that ey always follow the rules is to respect and hope no to cause ay confusion to other uers .
Als , Japanese thnk highly of the noyment of bathing in a cean environment .
As a rult in Australia , conflcts ma be caused due to the high lel of indulgence and individualism in Australian cultur ( Hofstde 1994 ) , peple may usually emphasize in thir self - satisfaction and tin of themselves irst instead of the public .
Tey may not consider the public interest n not give precedence to oter ues .
Consequently , the bathng pol may face t hygienic problem , ch as someone does no wash beoe bathing , an scrmbling issus .
In order to achieve ct efficiency , he choice of locations and dco mt be thoroughly considered .
A location whether it has sufficient quantity of water or not is the essential consideration .
Renta cost is also a limitation as it is retively highr in Australia .
Dea John ,
I am rting to rcommed a pace you sould definitely visit whi o 're in Plan .
The pla I 'm writing about is Wawel Royl Castle in Cracow .
It is not nl one of e most important onumnts in the whoe country but also a beautiful plac to visit .
It is a majesical astle conviniently located on t rier .
It 's a huge breah - taking complex of hitorical buildings ad royal grdns .
The pce is fascinatng , because it is lodd th hisory a ce to spd a dy and relax in royal gardens .
I al recommend goig to the vaults under he cthdral , where sine the 16 century may ing and amous Polish people have tir gaves .
Te awel Ryal Castle is an obligatory lac to see , hie visiting Polad .
It is well knon in te whe of Europe an ma freignes are coming to Poland jut to see th Craow city and among oter ting the awel Castle .
I so thoroughly recommend Cracow in gneral as a plce to vist , becuse it is beautiful , full of oter worth - seeing monuments , ue smal afes , various hoce of resaurats nd ivd hotels with rea vie on e iversie .
I hope o will desribe your mpressions out the city after visiti it .
I 'm looking forward to a repose from yu .

vdences sw that many natural system have been affected by climte changes , prticuarly by teperatue raises .
I tnk it is tm we srt takig environmentally fiendl attitudes to hl the planet .
First of al , as dioxies an crbons gases have been increasin ozo pollution worldwie in i cities , awaeess campaigns sould be pomoed to highlight the aternative uage of trsportation .

In addtion , ater ollution is , as wll , a global roblem , as so many indusries dump a lage amount of waste into rier and lakes a also human waste and rubbish end up in the water .
A solution could be done by improving recyling , waste disosa and en , by cleaning up shorelines .
Moreover , fe may ot be posible for the future generations , unlss we start fom now usn rnewable sorces of nerg , like green , to proote sustainability and improve energy eficincy avoiding sde effets to th plant .
To conclude , I firml believe ta we can educe damages d global warming by adopting environmentally friendly attitudes , as the s of green nd clean negy sources .

Now that we have a wonderful ide I thought you would wan to har abot it .

Just xt to h dsk , I would ut on a small warrob ; iven that there would have additional drawer ude e ed to kp some clothes , a large warrob mit not be eded .
I might ut on a mirror on the inteior side of oe of h wadrobe doors .
Wll , I have already explined in detai how I woud decorate o of the rm sides , so now I am oing to tell you what hee would be in the two remaining alls .
First and foremost , though , I av to a hat I am eaer reader ; hat being said , it may be obvos why I vale pace so uh : I eed a plce to put my book in .
So , rsuming what I ws saing , I woul lace two or three bookcass , filng h rmainin space ts w .
On the the hand , asie frm my edrom , I ould lov to ve my o rading nook , where to ad peacefully .
So , if my mental estimtes are correct , thre shoud still be nogh space available to lso place a litte armchair , whe I could ad more comfortably than in my e or in my chai ds , not ery r from the windo .
Oh !
, also , it wuld be really nc to have a footstool , too .
As ar as television is conened , el , bng onest , I haven't been watcig much TV for ars .
So , at mo , I would put on a furteen inche one on th top of n of e bookcases .
Nevertheless , it 's somethig dispensable for me n , for this reason , I think I could get by ithout havg on .
Now that I have alrea finishd describing e arrangement of my hypothtica bedroom , I am oing to alk about i lighti .
Frstly , I would only use eergy - saving ights to lluminat my drem room .
Secondly , my id is pting on , at leat initialy , wo lamps : a wite overhead n nd a rd desk on .
Regarding the dek is just beside th bed , th des lamp could be sed to iuminate both the es and the bd ead ; that way , placing anoter lamp in he furniur wul be unnecesay .
Lastl , I could conidr also putting on a stanard lamp ea my reading armchair , but I old need to actually e up and us my dream broom to se if it is really worh it .
Finally , conerning the bedroom colous , I blive th walls should be painted of a light colour , like ite , beg or , mye a light green . h ceing old be he sme colours as the walls or , perhaps , a darker hue than they .
I sincrely dobt tht I painted th frniture , togh , so thy would display the colour of the wo tey wod be made from .
Ltly , I wud like that my curtains were red , given that is my favouri colur ; hower , I would use roon , which is qit similar , for te crtais because it is more sobr d , consequently , more sutble for my ro .
I think a famly matters uch f everybody .
We do n't choos aents and children , but we ca choose a ood husband or a fe .
My parnts divorced whn I w 16 year o , so I do n't have close relatins with my om a dad .
Athough I 'm very grateful to my mom for eat supprt in t most difficult te of my fe .
My moher ha a t of friends d sh is quite apy .
My dad ha a new faily d it see he is fne too .
My o is 13 years l and we understand ah other very well .
I 'm rather a frid to m tn a strict mother .
He does n conceal anying from me as I try to understand what he really need and upport h .
My hsbnd is alo my be friend as I do n't have anbody loser tha he .
We speak about vrything and respect ch other .
ometmes we quarrl , but it oe n't last long .
I 'm hpy as I have always dreamt of suh a family .
I completely disagree wih t tatement " tee is no future for pubi tranpot " .
I do believe tt wit ie people become mor onscius of t iea of citis cnvnient to everyone .
espte private car is more cnvenint to its owner then public transport , it is not in ue h majority of ie d that means wsting city sce f paking while it could be ud as a public space .
At t same me it is o impossible to solve the as of comfort ad efficacy simultaneously .
For instance neork of taxi cabs wh afrdable prices could combine comfo of person car an wok - oad of public transporttion .
Nowadays al he car manufacturers accepted the task of design robot - driven ar ht in future wld resolve the issue of sfey a availability of tax 24 hours 7 dys a week .
But ow is it ossible to prsade citizens to make a right choice ?
Unfrtuately the main method is to mae private ar if not a lxury then to mk thei uge economically le efficient in favour to pubc transportation .
And underground , lgt tram ystem e stil me clogical n fast .
T i of ti report is to descrie the training coure ha I w attendng la mnth , r a wek and the activties in ich I was involved during tis erid of time .
It turned up to be a disadvantage or me , given ht I am interested in h theor .
I maned to find out vr few things about t theory , ue to the lrg number of participants .
I realised ther is no time to thin too muc hn it comes to pctice , because you have to act quikly and to prove yourself and the others tat you e your knowledge in order to acomlish a certain ask .
The fficincy is n of he most important thing in tems of tie management .
I would strongly rcommnd this training course on time management , considering is seul o just to gi ome theor aspects for those ho want to be or organised , but also if o wan to really mane in a dly sitaton .
As a result of usefl civities putting teory into prctice , you will have a better ance to ahiev your goal .

No utur for te public transpor ?

Gee house gases have put a red light wring on the plat , d countries around he wold e startin to ealze the importance of reduing these aes .
One of t mesurs that we , as world iticens , can tk is to leave our cars at hme a start to tke ublic tnsport or to shar cars wit ters .
Big itie re rowd wih vehicles and as result level of ollution a dangerously increasing .
This is evelopng dieses and alergies that r affecting the citicens .
That is why , many itis has lse their centres to pvate cars and only alos public transport .
Enginers re stying w egines hat are mo nature friendly , but even so , we have to reduce vehicles to help rdue een ous effects and pollution .
Pan ad programmes are being developed to reduce he nber of as driin throuhgt t itie .
Sme of these oave the same destinations .
Use pblic transport is a wa to be green and help to imprv our pane and that is a vr importn task fr all of us .
I do t agree with the statement that tee is no utue for public trnspor .
In ecent years , pbic transport is reall common in ou lie .
rom the Mro stem , th bus , the train , and the hg seed rail , a tee public transportaion ecom more and more polar .
Los of people rall enjoy the ment wh taking public ransportaton because te e ore convenient , ost ls ad more ec - fiendly .
In my opinion , taking pubi transport is ore convenient .
We do n't have to drive by ourselves , ad we do n't have to think which way we should go to rah th destination .
What we av to do is imply go to te public transport stations and ther wl be vhicles that will tk us to anywhere we wat .
Aditionaly , taking pulic transport cost les .
Compred to divig a ca , it only cost us out 20 N.T. dollars or at ost 50 dollars r one single travel .
We hve to pay fr te il if we drive d we all ow that the oil price oe up evy year .
As a rult , I think more people ill prefer to take ublic tranport rather tha rivin due to the hgh price of the i .
Finll , tkig pulic transprt is more co - friendly .
O mother earth has suffered fo air polution f a long perio of tm which lads to grenhouse efec n th rise of e averae e eve .
We do n't wa hese natural dsrders to continue .
Taking public transport c efecienty rdue the emissio of carbon dioxdes and will help the earth to recover fom tse disorders .
So , as a membe living in our mthe earth , we should do our best to protec her .
Frm this pon of view , I do n't thk public transport has no future .
Th abe reasons I menined explain why I do t agree wh th staemnt th t ulic tansprt ha no future because traveling by car is more cnvenient .
an o magie a transportation which never appears ?
You may thin of the te machine , it would only be en on vie .
However , it wo n't be probably be invented afer all .
Is there no future fr pulc ranport ?
Since a century , an transpots ave ben invented , therefore or lves beome convenient .
We n easily trael roud the world .
What tranporttion do we need nd should be invented nw is ad to think , because no place we coud n't go .
I think the transport nowaays are perfect .
Although he public trsport is enough for people eed , it cn be improve its uction .
Fr exame , the speed of transportation a beom faste , usin green energy sorces , imprvd t capacity of the public transportions and so on .
Wi the advance of technology , a lot of roblems have ce to pas , the aturl resources are becomig in storted , an e ar ollutio is geting worse .
This is arful to everything in h orl .
So , we have to consider ow to imrove tese prolems for our ex generation .
Learning of anotr language is ey useful these ays , because of globalization an ao cooeration between cutries .
It is importat when we wrk or study in international area .
It can have befits bu also some dawbacks .
Firstly I would lk to write about benefits .
Pole wo are leaing another laguge or mor languages have mor opportunities in thei li .
It can ave nfluene at her work .
The can have better positio , wor for foreign company , comnicate wih forign companies t .
It can be the benefit at school as wl , because if ou need some information for some project , you can ok at freign liteature to .
Also yu can be part of traveling ad orking experene which can ofer to ou or school .
If y ant to r this option , you need to hae a very good level of particula language .
It is vey good ht tee days chools fer you more languag for learning to choe from ad they recommed learning at least 2 forein anguags .
Of course it can be dffernt in ac ountry .
Another vey important benefit of learning n anguge is tha you can travel you il understand people abroad nd u will know how to cmmunicte ith them .
It helps you to ask people on mny portant information which you need during you jouey .
F example , wch w you suld go , here is god estaurant , how to tael in a country , w to solve your problems , whe is the heapet accommodation and mu ore .
Thanks of erning nother languge you can hve also friends from all the ord ad you n btter understand e culture of nw country .
d what re the drwbaks ?
I think that ter is ot many disandvantages of learning another language .
One of hem can be tat eole h do n understand is lnguae wil try to ask you al the time to hp hem .
It can be reall inerruping if it stil cntines .
nd ometimes maybe you do no want to har what ar peple seaking about in feign language .
In conclusion I woul ke to sy hat te learning of another language wl be alwas iprtant or today 's peope d w genraton too nd in addiin it will increase eed to commnicae in aoher language .

With the process of th globalization , people r eager to know he othr untry tha ever .
In th past , most people consider the museum as te best way to e along with e unfamiliar lnd .
Howver , te sitatin has lreay chaned .
First , as te technology developed , we m find visiting museum is far from convenient .
Peole ung new technique as gradually constitued the majori .
e online visiting is a gd oin in this ca .
h Forbidden City , n of the most famous museum in China , has pene it online version to the ublic , which mans people can visi he Forbidden City on te Internet instead of taking a tim - consuming flht to ejing where the museum locates .
It eads to an increang numbe of peopl choose to usn the nlin musum .
On the the hnd , needless to say , he limitation of musem is tha it can only store som pictures n painigs , it is f from an enjoyable visiting when ou can only se the pictu 2 metrs aw a no tuch .
The senery , e beauty of mountain ad rive , can only be njoyd wen o travel thre on yu own .
Oe I visited the mueum finding some pitues of the ave painting in France , u when I got ance to see the real inting , I found it is mor vivid a ca ho o how geat the France cavean who painted it .
Admittedly , th musu has its owm meris;it is easy to fid on the m and always be emphazised as a symbol of a country .
Howve , mre often ta ot , the hih rice of th ticket of the musem a ru h fun when y get to the cutry .
A documetry , a ok bot the cutue is chep a easy.we c consider it a ecomomical metd .
Visiting museum is undoubtedly a good way to konw bout a country , b not a et y anymore .
If you decide to find sme infrmation bou a tally unknowed lan , h seum is not a wise opio .
e ho of the future .
Ta souns a little bt lik a name of any s - fi or horor .
But why ?
ill o houss lok so terrile in a 40 yrs ?
ll they fy in e sky ?
Or will they be made from iron a have strng or a barred windows ?
Will we ee go out on the treet ?
ut do n't pan , lt 's think rationally .
Technology will ontrl or homes .
With tehnology we will cean our hous , tehnology will protect us , wit technology we will spend our ee im .
In every rom we will hae a big scen , where we 'll be able to se , where r ou children n if evryhing 's ok .
Our fridge will tell us to bu a fresh milk , if thre 's no lft .
u be wll tl us when to go sleep .
I hae only oe qustion .
Will we lve in that hous lon ?
Do we need friends or family membes if technology can take are of us ?
Machines c tell us ots of imporaant infmation .
Doe it an that contac bween peoe il disappear ?
I thik it 's something nobody wats , but it can comes true .
People se mcines and robots because they do n't want to waste their tme .
B maybe they could top tl to ah othr , because it 's waste of te to .
I hope , It will nee happen .

To take pulic transport or not that is a question . Travellng by ca is conveien , howeve , it
ignores the ca congston problems n the polluion fr the C .
Yet , to me public ransort is my
preferene .
Public transport reduce h a congestion problems .
Sice h ulic transport , it decrease people
wrk or travelling by ca .
r exaple , taing e trai form apei , te ty in Taiwa , to Taoyun in he newyear just costs half an hours in contrast nearly t hours awig to he a congston in the highway .
Besides , ae the trai instead of ca ma make a ne fiends possibly if chats wh others besds the ats .
Therefore , pbic transport is e bst option to me .
In terms of protecting envirnent , takin the public trasprt may u dow the crbon emition .
Becaus there e nearly 70 billions people in the world if everye travelling by cr even the half , he pollution wil be the brde to the ord .
It is t urgent tiing to aoid reenhouse roblem tat people houl tink how to decrease th carbo emmition .
To be brief , taking the pubi transport is not ony avoid congestion prblem to ave th tme but benefit o ther nature ture .
dmittedly , travelling by the car as its merits such as mo conveient to everywhere we wat , a ejoy e time with famly in car .
Nevertheless , it cost a lot of problm d plluton .

Good morning , evryone !
Today I 'm gng to inrouce a book about nature ha I 've ra reently .
The book is called " iving Through a Natural Disaster " written by Eve echt .
The reason I hose this book was that it is ally comrehensie in hwing you tha different parts of he world are suffering from disasters , f instance , the Cyclone Tracy in Darwin , Austrli ; the Yelo Rve flood in China and a devastatin drought in Cenral Amria etc .
It oncsely depics the devstaton ad destruction cused by ntura disastrs .
The book is alo vr readable , nt only intrducing te disastrous effects of disaster ut simply ive us an overview of handling natural disasters , so anyone can get to kow the georaphial penomeno .
The most engaging and intriguing par of this bo is ta e pepe wh live along te Yeow ier , how tey suffered fro te lood and how they handled the devastation and ake a bettr solution .
At e begnning , the ellw River s always unashing terrible floods that swept through owns , vilages nd farmland .
It became a as kiler ad make people homles .
eople wre forc to fe by boat bcase of th flood .
eople living along he river wated to pevent e lod coming gain by buidin dykes .
owever it mad the situation wose .
After day of havy ran , the water level becae dangerously high beause the rirbed can t withstand the water when it out of s limitaton .
The Yellw Rivr overflows d the crop on the plains a rined in some areas .Fortunately , the flood also makes h plains fertile and feed millions of peole .
Whil I w fip - foppig throug th pages , I le my imagination run wi wih the sor .
Let 's thi abu how we teaed our mothr of nature bfore .
Now se is extrmel agry after han beings did something rally hurt to e .
After l , she is very kind - hearted d always helps us have a good living .
Evn thugh he mothe of ntre is complicated sometimes , sh wod give us a lit of hope .
e nevr us shuts oe or , a she als open another o .
Acording to wat Charles Dickens si , " it was the best of times " , because th people can ge rarding frm the nature an e a better life because of the fertil land hich cn feed us .
However , " it was the wst of ies " also .
People will continue suffering e dangous floods ad the is no en after many eas unless th goverment take an effective acto to stop floding .
It is aruous for people livng in devastating surrounins .
The Yellow River is a combination of history an modernization .
It arrie a lot of mories from h pas to now , whether it is cruel to peop or ot .
Reading this oo is like unwrapping a preent which is packed in ayes of sheets .
My hert grieved at every wrd portraying e sufring of the pople in he Yellow River .
Meanhie , a surg of sympathy ad esair ovrwhelmed me with lot of thougt - provokng words .
I sincerey recoend this book to everybody h wats to broaden tir horizons n know more ha you have known aready .
That 's all fo my presentation today .
Tank you for listing !
I agree with the ie that sporting evets cn be ncessary r inerntional relations and natinal nit .
In ths essay , I wil think aout the effets of thse popula sorting events .
h World C , Olympics and ote international gas work for easing tensions amon diferent atins .
For example , oth and South Korea are t countrie against each other , bt every year they stil hav a frienly football matc .
During that me , the ns nd the players are the same rmony in unity and friendship .
The fans , suppoter shout , they ven cy together .
Th sports me evts are opportunities to strngthen h friendship between t nations .
On the oher hand , so sorts mthes n ake internationa relations worse .
Sometimes the spors games re full of tension over flo .
The patriotic emotion exlde in unaggressive wa .
For example , during the semi - fial firs e AFF up 21 betwe Vietnam and Malasia tea , te laers played qute violent , the supporters of te t tea we ve tense .
Even after h en of e match assaults occurre between supporters of the w teams .
I thin tha intenationl sporng occasin can be one of he bst ways to es tensions or to release parioism safely .
Howeer , I believe th games c not be he fundamental was for te sound pariotism or peaceul inernaional relaions .

In my opinon te obsession f the business rasforms ociety in a ig in which vey man will be against hi friend nly fr an exellen caeer .
The last point ta h chaed people 's life is he tendency to ave the same thougths or h same goods .
In this ay everyoe is the perfect copy of someone else nd t originaliy or a crative mind is considered as something bad .

Findings
Vien contains a lot of gra shopping areas , that is why I am going to seaciase on h three most popular places .
Conclusions
I would li to star of ih ne of the most renonedl alls - caed " Donuzetrum " .
It is ituaed in Kagrn and can be asily reache by subwy .
It covers about 60 shops .
The mall is inke to an enerainment section , called " onauplex " .
Th Entertainment ecton stays pe after e mall closed .
Thee you can id a cnma , some restaurants and ars .
On the countryside you can fn the recently dfied mall named " G3 " .
I wold rommend o to go there by car .
It contains narly the same shops as h " Donauntrum " ad svral restaurants ad f√©s .
Te " Mariahilferstra√üe " is t perfekt ple fr people at want to aid ovecroded malls .
This street is o oft th mst pular hopping reets of Vienna .

It is not only worthy to aend t street by dy b also by night .

Many people fee that eaning Enlish especially in ' nglad ' or in ' T U ' , is bettr than learning ha in a country that do not have nglish as s mther tongue .
Fr instance , in Peru everybody paks pansh so you are t ccustomed to the languae .
he adntages of learning English abroad are the eeryday pratice , whh you should have if you re in an Eglish country and al h eole wo you get to kow rom l he word .
e argumnt in favour of his idea is that Peruvian people h larn Engih for a short period and ten travel abroa , have an enhanement in just one or two months .
Hwever , e disadvantags re that ou do o nw how to behave in anoter cltur .
And it is difficult to change ur eeryday rouine .
Also , you can suffer from jet - lagged if u travl a lg distance .
In conclusion , I am of the opnon that eople ought to study abroad if they have e opportunity , so apar from your lessons you can interact with native people a ler usually - cmmon phrases .
nna knew that it was goig to be a ery speci da o he .
he kw tt her eighteen birthday apprah and e il spend hm nd all the preceding wek with her friends in pin .
he had to ly nx Monday n go bck et Sunday .
Her rthday wa in Friday and they all wnte to go that night to e greatest club in Barcelona to have som fun .
Other girls left ot earlier because they prepared somhing special for her .
u befre she wnt to the club , sh s invited f one dink with ifeaver from the hotel 's pool .
Ten th people fm e hotel sa her last me .
She did not ppar in the club , ad h id no come to the hotl on onscutive dys .
Her friends cam bck to their country t Anna still is issing .

If you want to meet somebody strange , do not leave your frinds or faily withut knowledge with who nd here y wat to go .
It 's only for our sfety .
Peol trvel less in public vehicles these ay .
ay tins hat life of pubic traspot is going to end .
I believe tt it is tre ecuse the people are mor concned out thr privacy and time taen to travel by h public transport .
In this eay tes worries ar udied carefull .
Prite vehicle offer more privacy th public vehicle .
A breast fedin won can feed her bay in the a witot worryng about her privay .
For exple , If h is sitting on a bu , e could n't feed er child because people sit in the neaby seats the may gaze at e .
On a h y he dy ca n't remove her oat to reduce body heat .
For eample , A lad rael on a bus and if he removes her coat eeryody wl look at e n probbly tese he b in her c she can do wt ev she nt .
Hence , the private vehicles give enough priac ad cofot o a family .
T ublic transport y take me tim to ravel and hve gid hedule than private vehicle .
A ca can be droe very fas in orer to reue the ime taken to travel .
In cae a person ho is going r an inerview for a b , punctuality is a must , hence he ca drive his ca fast or can go earlier in is ca to rec the early .
But he could not travel on a bus er fast in rder to each destination very qickly .
ecause pubi transpot have a fixed timetable .
Hece plic vehicles take mor time to travel .
In conclusion , usage of publc transportato is redcin da by day .
People a getting anxus aout hir pricy a the trip time .
In orr to boost he usage of public transport th government or the governing bod hould consider the factors an mst ind a solution to tse probems .
We almost foret but those days befor the Inenet arrived .
Te technology has changed us much faster n more dramaic an we sed to think .
We had to carry a mp for ur adventue 10 yrs go .
owadys l of what we eed is a fll charged smart pho with the Google ap application .
In the at people could ol hve a pchase from store to store by themslves , no we c brows amost hundreds of god on line and buy it through a simple click .
F this trendous outcome I believe that our ives wl change dramatically in the xt 50 ars , with greater extenio to every aspect of our lives .
In my imagination , h fture would be moe messy and crowded with les species of creature but more of us , the human bing .
We wl fe t more seriu problems of gloal warmg ad other ful environmental pollution .
Some of the countries will be submeged ntirel io the e , sme wl suriv , an less space for increaing people .
Fortuntely the os outstaning scientists wil solve the energy crsis and will in wys to create ew land r living , to can air for breahin , nd to purify wtr and ood for supply .
Oher than th situation I mentioned above , we will hae or memories a knwledge beig relicate in t form of digital dat .
We ca acces all the knowledge fom h Internt as we need .
Wen we have a dementia ( a steady degeneration diease of or brains ) we n tae ack our lst mmoies fro the backup system of on - lie " i Clu " memories .
No lnger do we sufr om studying foreign languages as our eys are capable of translating to the anguage we knon though he linkage to e huge database onlne .
Als , we n hange ou emotions by releasing ome ivisible cheicals hich can rigger o reactions in o brns .
We can expeience the mot extraordinary dreams witou harful ffects to r personalities .
Moreover , our cothing will be ale to hage olours and patterns even te physical functions corresponding to the hanging environments or simpy by our specific commands .
However , e more we feel convenient , the mre amage to our intellect .
We do n't ave to thnk too mch about almost everythin , needing no prson to company wt nce we have al hse distractive deices for joy and reaxatin .
Te distance between pple wll increase dramtially until we finally wake up from all of these unreastic convenience we have .
It sounds like a scry sience fcton , but it my happen if we keep psuing on values of materials .
What thin te mo imortant is to set a right direction r te futre of us .
We hae a lo of problems waiting to be soled .
For eampl , saving te endanger ildife ad e sace ih in he sa is much re imporant tha those invention which ol mae or lives moe conenent .
me - saving and convenince re admittedly consdeed tw essntial alue of mode lives .
Nneheless , we ae to confront e truth hat the esources from al over h world e distriuted unirly .
Te op 50 richs in te world hd most of h ower to control h direction of ur future .
PLAN , TRIN OR OAT ?
Currently there are any means to transport , u if we tk abo lo distances , remain the st popular trains , lanes and boas .
Whch of hese is better ?
We may thnk that depens on how you ke to travel , as ty all have tir advantages and disavatages .
Whe o tavl by land , train is e of the best options .
hoever you ca n't travel by train when o want to cross h sea .
But personally , my faorite way to rvel is by plane .
It is fser than h t , it is no dificult to travl on it an it is quite omfortable .
Also yo can tavel to different places n lnger distances while boating , for example , y cn only travel to places where connetion to h sea .
In srt , lae is e of the bs optons to do it .
Dar Jo ,
I 'm really gd to knw about your future plans , I dfnitley think tt thi year of travelling and discoverying ll be a grt y to gr up , meet ew people of different cultures .
If I ha t opportuny to hep u in your organization , please no doubt that I will certainly do so .
Fstly I stronl recommend you to visit the main capital , which is full of marvelos hstoricl an cultural site sc as museums , art gallres , monuments and church .
Whetr at some point you are fed up wh t and culture , the city offers to you a lo of leisure time fcilities sch as concerts , exhibitions , festival an so on !
From the ai capital o n easily travel by rin or plane ad reach in a few hus all the major ites bh in he orth a in te South of e couny .
As you arrive urig the summr , you should th have a vacation in h South where th beaches re breathtaking , with suh a lean ater and lden long shores .
In connection wit your desire to find a job , you should try to find a temporary job in the trism field : as ou wte , you 're seaching fr a mothly ob and I eckon that a seasonal jb f the summer would erectly i your expectatos .
By e a , a rend of mie rs an hotel in a seaie rsrt and I now ht he a looking forward to an Eglish native spear wh could hlp him ith his oreig guests .
If yu are intested , I could give you his pone umer nd e - al so tht you to are ab to sea about the matter nd maybe find an agreement .

Charles Dickens nd Emily Bronte a both Victorian wrter .
Ther novels have much in commn : first of al the pot is usually pretty complex ( as we can se in Dvid Copperfield by Dickens and Wuthering Heigs by E. Bronte ) , n so are the characters , which r always el described epecially on a psychological vel ; furthermore bh t authors includ in heir works the figure of the oble wh eps the hopeess chid who comes from a lwer clss .
Thee is al a l in contrast , mst evient is the diffeenc bewen te settings : Dickens pefers industrial cities whie Emily pefers rural vilages , and tee choie relet dierent tois , in ft hrles motly dea with thes ik exploited childhood , the miserable conditions of lower classes n the ad consequences of he industrialisation , instead Eiy Bronte is more concerned abo te tem of repecability , even if he female heroins do not reflect Vctorian vals uh as chastiy an ude .
Then we ca otice that the narrator of te vel as ifferen rles : Dikns 's narrator is omniscin , Emily 's one is part of th story itself and a change realing characters ' perspectives .

It is te tt t sce of current mariages is larger and re luxurious an that in h past .
There ar soe reasons for ts situation .
Persnall , I tin this developmnt has bo psiive d negativ ies .
Thanks to increasing living standard , people e abl to afford a bgger and expensive wedding .
If in he past , they just old wedding at hme to save money , now they tend to choose retaurats and hotels insted .
Second , it is likely that nowaays pople ocs oe on appearance , so luxurious nd elegant weddin is an occain o tm to show f .
It et peopl to now ht they re importan or powerfl .
Finally , people he mor relatonshis in ife as well as in business .
Tereore , the nmber gues invited to t weding ae uch more thn that those in prvious time .
A bigger wedng is equired to mt this change .
Obiousl , xpensive n lager mrriage have some benefits .
It is a special se to brng people together .
As a eult , re ew relationships are creatd , people gt more chan to co - orinate in business a help ec other in fe .
Those who losing contact f a log time a exchage current infomation and kep in touch agai .
Furthermore , odrn weddings big to eople ne experiences about food , lifesye ad culture exchangng .
However , there re also some drawbcs it bring aot .
These such b and expensive marrages waste a t of money n ie to repare .
Groms , brids d their parnts usually have to boo resturan , hotl , invite sier and famo masr of ereony to make he wedding eriou .
nstead of that , this amount of ony an ep the cule b hou or a fr a ne fe .
st b not lest , in some cases , ny fo th ske of showing off , my coupl , after getting married , ave to work hr to an money to pay e eb for wedding expediture .
To conlue , marriage is a landmark of individual .
However , a wedding ih a reasonable scale will ithr satisfy the guests or redue he burden for the oule an thr fmilie .
It as a tr I 'll never forget .
At first , wen h ski lift rs up to he statin , I a terified as I was suspnded from t gron .
Some days before we hd decided to ognize an excursin to a ntur tral nearby as sn as we arrived at the ailay stop , we wre so ascinatd by ha suronded us that we ad bn walking for three hurs alog a pat , uddenly , our surroundings appered to be ar ilder than it ad ben before so we stope teking and we d a look at o ap .
Onl then d we realize we ha lost our way , we had not been ayin atentin to ou path , the nly thig we oud do as to go back .
As we were gog bak to the sk li , we hea a stang noise which w comin from th buses beind us .
We tred towards e bushes imediately , we ee worried as we had listened to he radio that a ear could have livd tere .
Fortunately , it was a beutifl dee as aby which looked at us an n ay mo frightened than us .
Eventull , it s a special trip !
er to whom it may concn ,
I am writin to apy o a o in a summer camp in th USA .
I am interested in t jb becas this woul be an pportunity of pending my summer in a mor u ay .
Another thing is hat : I woud iprov my skll in wrkig ih children and I find h mney useful to expnd my academic ualifications .
Frstly , I am a young colge student , a frendly pers and devoted to my tdies . I ejy cooking as one of my hobies .
I lso take pleasure in playing tenns , for e benefits of practisig ports n staying active .
Besies , I particularly enjoy outdoor activities rather than indoor oes .
I believe this job wul suit me r the following reans : I am familiarizd it the envionmnt in sumer camps as I spent my previous summr in o .
Another reason is tht I have gind experience tkin care of children from orking as a abysitter recently .
Furthermore , I have a gra nse of ledrship as wll as the social skills need from being a scout f five years .
All in l I can ssue yu that I woud be a grt addiin to ou team of wokers r al h reasons above stated .
For tt , I hope my leter is taken no onsidertion .
I patienly await an nswr .
With kind regars , atarina
La summer I spent in Oxfor , UK studyg English in language shool for ESL learners .
I kew no one in the city ; my friends d family we far wa , so I felt lonely .
I came to shoo with amot zero knowledge of English , n after try tests , I was applid to lel higher tha ne .
When I wn to class thre was a rou of students h hd alrad tudied together r ome time .
Being apy togthr , th wre not paying attntio to a new girl .
here was o a chance to befried with them , I thougt .
Thrd shol day gone , o of the classmates caugh me in a hall an akd if I ant to join em tonight for dinner .
I was needed practice in speaking so uh , so it wa what h doctor rdered !
Tee was h oly proble : I can not communicate wl in Enlis and I s rally s bout it .
ut when the dine started tee was nothn to wor , because my classmates appeared supportive d patient .
This evening wa so delightful !
I tod tm abou my conty ad family , I was speaing English and ey wer undrstanding me !
It ave me a stong bief in future progress in learning .
Th guy h nvite me , Fancois from France , spoke wt me more hn hers .
Sartin to spend evry evening together , we spoke about past , expressd ou thoughts nd future plans .
Every time when I flt weak about my Enlish he suported me like no one else .
He helped me forget abou my er , bcaus his believin in my success ma me stroger .
Afte two eeks he returne to Frace , but we keep in touch even toda .
I am going to France hi December , ad Frcois will sh me independent Pars !
Hllo Paul ,
Did you remember tt I wet to the Muse concert in Dublin lt moh ?
I 'm sur you rmember because I spoke a lot about this ven .
I was n't a imle spectator .
I wa part of the team !
I was in chag of h tikts sale .
There were ten door in the uilding d my job was to sell tiets at door mber 5 .
I sod 57 tickts at the prie of 55 ‚Ç¨ uros .
I could ee e show from my ple bt the mo exciting hng hapened at the en of the sow .
he artists invited all e saf to a big pat in a restaurant .
It as unbeievabl to speak wh t artist and ask them questions about teir life d habi .
Nowadays it 's omon to thik tt ravellin by r is muh more convetien than travelling by public transport but it 's no rue at all .
Som surveys have demonstraed tha traellng by car is ore expensive that travelling by public ransprt .
Th inceae in the uel cost r exampe , wl have srely a negaiv mpac on the use of private vehices .
Moreove other cos ill act upon the prices of travelling by prvate ehicls .
In the same surveys , h esercher show ho travllig by pblc ansport is safer ha travelling by r .
The annual aveae of cashes caused by public transort measures of 43% , instead of the privat one tt is arond 76% .
As for the pulltion , it oul be reduced if peol s the publi vehicles ; it is well - kow that e CO2 emissins per passener kiometr by pubc mans of transportation are 80% less than a car .
Obviously the quality of ublic ranspor has to be impoved .
Signifcan canges have to be doe eithr to ensure the qualty of service and the conditions of te coaches , rains an other public means of transportatio .
In tis a the cusomr c fee cofotable as they ll in theirown cars .
ESSAY : Yung people in pain e not as healthy as they shol be
h latest esearh cried ut by The Health Department in Span hw ht oung people are not as halthy as twenty years ago .
Tha cou be a highr problem if the tren is maintained for a og me beause puli spending could rise 60 % in he nt 10 yer .
e esons for that may a in he current financial riis at is strongly affectng over os middle clsses in he counry .
The w quality in products ht youn peole eat and the littl ariety in eating habi cul get things even worse .
sides , oo much use of computer and mobie phone is not lping to nd he roblem at a .
Finally , it is provd tht youths are deting les time to do exerie than they shoul an as a consequence , they ae ot improving their eeral health enough .
As far as I am cncerned , I think Spaish government should implent health programmes a advertisement ampaigns in ordr to improve heth in young poplation .
Furthermore , Sanish schools shod pa more atenton to this attr a teach chldren how to devep a healthy lifetyle .
avelling by car is oly convenient in a restricted sense while plic trnspor is veall mo convenient .
Wa is meant by a restricted sense is that for adults , who r healthy d able bodie , having cces to personal transportation is arguably quite attractive .
They cn simly travel hen hy chse and ot be tied to a timetal tat has bee dvised ou of hei control .
However note my emphasis on adu , healthy and able - boie , for yon pele , fo ler peope , fo pple with disabilities beig abl to driv brings moe cots than benits .
A public trasort system is much mr convenien for is group of popl because they wo n't need to worry about he kll and attention needed f driving .
Furtherre t monetary cost in the long un are much tter using public transport bh fr ndividuas and for the wer society .
I totally agree wi ths statement .
Fous people often are annoyed , because every their aion will apea in te magazines or Internet .
They ca n't do trivial this such as shopig or oing to the cinema with their family isensible for the fans and papparazi .
Even hen celebrities r haig holidays pople ask them to give an autograph .
Someimes famous eople lok a litle i differen tat on the stge ad thir face wihout any makeup appear in th Internet .

Hll James!I had already read ou eml and I 'm gog to try to give yo som adie . I know you love doing pors , in specil gf , ad it helps yo a lot to be in shape , but , do yu eally have to do it ?
Is necessary for your healh but , what about if u go runing in the mornings ?
You ep dong sport but in nothr time .
On the oth hand , I know that music is your asion , a in my opnon , you shuld n't ive up music classes , hen o 're stress it helps y to relxes you .
Also u 're aout to finish your clases , so if yo ge up mic , ou will discard all your effort .
Anyways , if you fee tt going to your music class is stressful d ou do n't have time to do it , t a new spor ! may soccer , or go running in the mornig as I sai bere , belive me golf is kind uny but you do n't eercise too muh as yo ould .
I hop ths eter help ou to ecie whatyou will do .

h complxity of human behavior is riical in pot .
As a result of th many tudies ave shown that thletes shuold be otivae to pu themselves bove the record .
You ned a motivation to believe in ou self that u a achieve it .
This attitde is eseciall true to Sportsan d women .
Swimming includes all thes abilities .
One of the mos difficult prt on the Earth ll lar you what it ans ad work , sacriice , pain , strain but as satisfactn , dtermination , prid and trggle .
he complexities in swimmin ae ot nl f h bod or out u aove l for the mn .
If you wat to im evyda pushing yourself abv your limis , you defiitely need a strog psyche a a olid motivation .
People th would to start th sport , they shol no tht this is not just a sport .
Ti is ife .
Y ertainly ill lrn to fail and win u the most important thing tht you will ln is never give up .
Futhermoe like Michael Pelps sid : " Tere will be obstacles , thee il be doubtr , there ill be miakes ut with hrd work ... thre ar no limit " .
Peol have h a need in communication snce e dawn of tme .
Every huan being h a nd in ocialisng d that is the irst reasn why I believe we sta making friends .
Peronaly I sualy get on wi people rtty well and make new frends easily as I am a natral extrvert ( or so I tnk ) .
It usually srts with sma lks or compliments , as at shol I ws taught that xpessing apprtiation to peope an be a go tar of any kind of relationships .
A te friendship tself forms on a base of srong mtul undertanding and th tke a go dea of time .
Finds do not have to share the sae opnion on evry topic , however , they should respect a sppot each ter even if they disagree .
All in l , een dspite te fact that maki friend n be a struggle ( they need o te nd efforts ) , they ge us support and lve and improve r ood when we ee it most .
I wa walkin in te nter of urin he I aw a g , beautiful hotel , with a lot of plice who were trying to manain law an order because the er a t of people lke me that wanted to know wha as ong on .
I w a policeman who w my fren and he exained to me that a man had en kille by someone and he allowed me to go into he room and e th sene of te crime .
I went to see h room of ts oor man , call Mr Sith .
All th room w in order and the policeman xplined to me tt the man , h had been ey l , had al been rich .
Mr Smith was found on the floor ih next to h a glass , wch was completely broken .
I thought tha he must ae calld e reception fr ome wine , as e waitress said that every niht afte he d eaten , he awys dnk a glas of wi .
All nit t bod d lain li this on t flor .
e et day th waitress kncke one , tice , ree tis but no e answered , so she thought tat the ma might hae gone out .
Se opend th om with me keys that ll th waitresses have , and saw Mr Sith lyng ea on the floo .
h detectives nalysed wht wa in the glass and it wa posn .
I hin tat someone who wanted to inherit Mr ith 's mone must ave killed him fo th reason .
In fac I discovred tt Mr Smit 's nephew anted a his fortune .
So he us have kled h ih he poio .
Sometimes pele wil do anytng or som money
Noadays it 's beieved tha it 's better to rk on your own ta to work as a goup .
First I complely agree wih th t then whe I started to tin aut it I ralzed that it 's not lie that .
Firsty I think hat if yo work as a team yo ca help each other and if you have moe peole to talk aou any situation you could ave a better and more completey answer because ou av the ideas a te knowledge of ery single member of h group .
Secondly I thnk that e members of the team gve you suport , lv a comny .
Sometimes the members of a group began to be so close to you that you lo them he same as if they wre part of your family .
Moreover if it is a really nic oup it is unnir to work with tem han to ok alne .
In conclusion , I belee that it 's eter to work as a team than to wr on yur own because ey give you ove , company n o could ss a vey good time
It is ell knon tht an image is betr tan a thousnd ords and that may be the resn for t success of television in a recent urvy as the most imporant inventon of te last 100 eas .

I am refering to the Internet . Born in the 19 's as a military poect to interconnect the missile facilities ad the cntal headquarters , it oon spread to unvesities an educational centes .
This ft , alon th the spreading of prsonal computers , quickly became in a gneralization of its s in te frt decade of e XXI ntury .

Fo more than 50 year it has be the mn enertainment cannl dslacing thrs as radio , theater , cinema and , sady , aso boks .

This experience is unbelievle and unfgettable to me .
It was in winer 002 hen 2 friends and me wr woing in a otel in a vilage called Tignes .

At about 8 p.m in the eening on December 1th , my friends and me we back home .
It s he d of a hard or 's d so we went to e eay ; we were vr tired and we had forgotten to put o a cdle .
Then , disastr struck .
One hour lter ur abl as on re .
While he ire ws spreang all ovr h bedroo , I woke up and Matxi was uncocious because ter was a lot of sok in the bedrom .
Monica and me alld out her name and we lpped her fac .
Fortunatey , we managed to ake her up .
At h omen , some friends d other workers who lived on he same flo go it the bedroom .
At the beginning , we ould n't stop t fie , and although his niht sound impossible , we anaged to put ot the re .
That day I was arai , but w I reember th expeiene as a good tim .
Public transport has een discussed enough but the is always spe for furher discussio .
o t quetio ue iscussin is whher public trasport has future as tavelling by ar is gaining more n oe populary because of its advanaes .
Well , I hin it s uture .
Fis , hre ae always lo of peopl wh would prefer no to gv uch thought where to park their ca or hw to avoid trffic jas .
The meto , which is a eans of pubc trnsprt , solv all thee problems .
In saller towns ithout underground there are usually a numer of us rots to cover the ci ar , so , all o ned is to go to a u op ad to ge on a bus and oon yu 'll reach e destination .
ne shul n't forget at using public transort helps to save mon .
It 's ot a secret that ga , insurance and eparings ar cosl .
Sfty issue is very important also .
It is obios that is safr o the environment th thirthy ca with an only persn nsie .
You shuld ta int acount tht thirty drivers(often inexeienced or aggressive ) pse a greater danger to road users hn than e traned bus drive who eels resonsibiliy for his passengrs d o other particpants of the traffic .
h aswe is evident , I thin .
n the last b not the leas thing is that thee re quit a lot of peop who are ot ble or just do n't wat to drive , so the ly ay ut for them is pubic ransport .
Moever , cities ' authoriies encourage development of public transport bcaus it crates employment , lesens mpact on the environment and contribute to oa saty .
So , my pinion is ha public transprt des have the ftue . Taveling by r is convenie t pubc tranport has undeniable bnefit for long lasting life as well .

And so , she h ooked around to fd a wa .
Te she h found a ate nearby .
As unelevable as it sees , it ha been a gate of time .
It ha ben tol that anyone who steed through it ould be cursed , but lic 's willingness had een stronger hn her fears .
She , without any hesitation , ad gone through t gate .
Finally , after mh time travels , Alice ad is feling .

And finally , she en on to her destination , her beloved homland .
Has ou told me that I will win some lterar ompetitons nd that so eople will speak ll of me , I would n't have believ yo .
e yr wa 201 and I had n't writtn anthing until that y - I just had been ranslting so stories d once even subttles r a Korean movi from English a Sanish .
But at a - it ws on sring n I believe it was ursday - my Englsh teacher told us bout a literary competion .
Th theme was ' I visited the arh in2112 ' .
It sounded lik a quite good hallenge for me so after fnishing e then lessons I quickly sa ow an started writi .
n hn I ote dn he last senten I immedately sent it to the stated ema .
Only then I realised ht there is nothing mor to do , that I have to just wait .
Fst ys I ws a little bit nervus but day by day I sartd orgettin about ny competiton .
But a month ago my mbie phone stare to ring .
An unknown number .
I picked up and har nice woman voice .
And that voice tol me tht I am a winner of a third lace !
So happy wa I !
That moment a bit chane my lie because I 've stared to wite more nd more store .
And h more wn copeitions , te oe proud wa I of myself .
Since I was a child , I had been curio to ko h suff work .
Disassembling games , buldin things of ood n playing Lgo we my favrie hobbies .
Through t years , my interst in machines an elctrical devices increased , so wenever a evice sop wokin I tries to fix it before cllng te maintnance , and my parents aways encouraged me eve when I broke it on .
When I was in secondary choo , n my friends ere draming of be Doctors or Detsts , I decided tat I ill be an electrical gineer or mechaicl engineer , so I entered th cientific branch .
During my tudy , my pares and I noticed at I understand kietc physics mor than electrial physis .
Also , I as good at mathemaics sujects that related to solid geometry , that is why I decided to tuy mechanical engineering .
Since I nroled in e facty of mechanical engineeing , I hd a gal to complete my astr study in Euroe or America .
After seaching and akig , I ond Germany has numerous prestgous technical uiversities , and it offers grat study amosphere f freign suents and supports hem in many ws .
Moeoer , Geman is one of the biggest ndusrial countries in he world and it hs many huge factories .
dditinally , th ivig cost are quie afforable .
For those reasons , I am convinced that Gemay is he best country to coplee my std abroad .
I have ben working as a teacher of mechanial materials in a vocational school ince my radation .
I reay lk this rofession and how good it fel to spread science nd knowledge to new geertions .
Threfore , I have decided that I am gon to continue my postgraduate study d pusue a Ph.D. dgree to work as a teache at a university .
I have been ooking for a while for suitab uversity to aply to .
I rad about TU - Clausthal n I decded to apply to it or mny reasons .
irst , I like th curriculum of h mechanical engineerig aster program .
Second , TU - Clausthal a ery good ratin in engneering at man wbsite le ranking.zeit.de .
Tird , TU - Clausal gis codiional admisso and it has a language cetr .
Finll , TU - Clausthal located in fasciatin nture .
I ho that I get te cnce to cmpete my study at yur university and to gain pracical experience in n of the greatest industrial countris in t worl .
A lot of dfferet languages ar spoken in all ve th wrld , and it is no easy to choose one of them to learn it .
my viw is that nowadays Enish is an important language that it is necessary for almost everyone , so I will choose to learn English irt .
T most common reasons to stud a lngage are the o an trvellng .
Altough in se places pple do n't spak English , yo alays an find somebody who do .
In adition , English is ot too diffiut to lan .
Even hogh you have to study vocabulary and expressions , he gamma is easy to understand and you can be able to do simple sentencs in a fw days .
O of the subjects at school is Eglih .
Therefore , we have to study it , nd when we fnih school we usually continu improving our Enlis efor learning anothr one .
A thin consided , I tink hat English is the easiest option en y want to study a lanuage .
ereas tre ae a ot of otions , we rarely start lening other laguage before we n communicate well in English .
Digital advetsing ; an excing but undesirable business
It is indisputable tha advrtisng has ecme a permanent fixture in our dal lives .
nce a curious novelty ha was agely conidered a rmless addtion to ou sometimes dull and overly fmiliar envionment , it was elcoed as n n informative .
It was als - if n wishe to do so - relatively asy to igne .
B we have w etere a w era of the attention - grbbing business : it digitalisation .
Their transforation from innocent posters to digital screens ranging in size from miniscule to va s made advets all - pervaive .
Researchers say that an average adu in th develpe wold is now exposed to hundreds of commercial messages evr day .
hose inolved in this ucratie biness are in we of h lmost endess possbilties tha recent technologia advances offer them .
Multimedia , adertisin n enterainmnt companis now work in synergy to trget everyn fr todders who can bael pek to pensioners confusd it e seed of life in e n a , unsutly playing on thei needs and desires in order to trn hm all into faiful consuers .
They have so successfully infiltrated eir ow prodct it u everyday existence at we no lnger see it anymore as what it really is : a nuisnc .
Creators of dverts have long given up on informing t consumes n instead opted for seducing te .
Th resul re insincere , misleading and ofte deceiul messages that u mind are satuatd wi .
Perhaps it is time to do an experimnt and hit a pause button d reflet upon this subject matter .
Imagine a orld withu adverts , for a ek at least .
Would it be bleak and born and leav us at a loss as what to buy , or might it just turn out to be a long yearned r respite ?
er Chaian ,
I am writi with regard to th capaign that you are pomting in fvour of an international sports competition that coud be hose in my tn .
As a mater of fact Venice cld be a vry good candidate for hosting the marathon cometition , hich will last o day
Moreoer Vnie is one of he most beauifu cultural ciies in Ital .
T marathonetscoming before or stayng after t competition can tak e advantage of viitig te city , whch offers a gat el of failities
here r t separae communication netorks in th cy , that of the waterways and that of the narrow trees .
Public water buses d privae war txi run 24 hur a d lthouh ls frequentl at night .
he mi cntr an be eahed very eail .
Despt th private seice is vey expensive it is efficient .
Four nd fve strs hote are located in the man area , bu smler hotels d a oth hotel re also vailable to families .
Hotel receptions and trvel agencies are always ready to hel their guests with a wide rag of information on the city 's entertanmens , exhibitons and so on .
ihtseeing ad excursions with private local gies are available on request .
In additin to is there is a significant lack of evening entertainments in te city sc as theatres , cinas and ght - cus .
On th contrary participants will fin a wie range of rsturants , trattorias n bars wit a good selection of menu suggestin local fod .
Som of hes restaurants cn be qie expensive .
In conclusin I think hee will be no obstacles and objections to host this sporng competition in my on wic on th the ha is also a ultral eet o many of the particants .
Yours faithfully

As we know , ths yp of event ca n't take pace without food .
On a Charity n Day the air a filed with he fabulous smell of Indian , Italian and many oter worl cisin .

It s fantasic eperiene , espcially r people for which it was intend .
If y 're ookig or a really od y out , come to next ar 's Chariy Fu Day .

Dea Jae ,
I 'm so sorry that it to me so lng to reply , but I had to ove ou of my arnts ' house last week .
It 's breaking my heart to he tht you 're in so terrile situation .
It must be awful for you .
To be hnest , I 've never nderstod why you eoy boxing ayway .
It 's brutal and I 'm always worried about ou .
You 're such a cue , little girl .
And this sprt ... I 'm surprised yo can tll play pino after all those accidents yu 've had .

I discvere t Enlish language when I was ght , a that amazed me so much that o year ate I starte to take a couse .
English was lso e key or my pasin fo technology , te oe that I undertood te lnguage , th moe I undrstood hw to use compute and the intenet .
out six monts later , I joind a comter class for kid in he sme location tha I took he English clsses a inc then , my love for mputers nd the language ut grew .
ha is wy I wish to rk in te areas of Computer Sciences , ad tudying abroad would give me an extr motvatin an open w doors to how and expn my ful potential .
Besides being my personal favorite for its cultur and languag , he Untd Sats of America offers big opportunities in this area , for it 's grt universities and educatonal system .
I am currenty an intern on a scientific research progam in a rup caed GALP - Logical Programming Teachi Grou , tht , ih te local city al of Araraquara , aims to transform he city into a national technology , reseac and software prodcing ente , accomplishing ts goal by teaing logical thikng and alghoitms to kd , diminshing uture evasion in many exat scincs course .
To bring back from this exchange echical kowedge in programming , as well as new mehds of teachi , wul be outstanding .
lthugh I writ and spek Enish in an dvnced proficiency leel , tis exchange would provide the fleny I need in aademic grounds ad interpersonal cmmnication , as all of te ms relevant paper , research and jornal are written in English , I nt to achieve tis level to me it easier to wre an produce good material fo he sentific community , nd to communicate btter th a cultures .
In Brazil , there is a ue lack of rofesionals on he field of informaton technology in ot academic n work arket , travlling aboa , especaly in t U.S. , oul qualify me in both areas .
Although I prefer h academic fild , workin in a copny reltd to otware desig d creation woud be a marvellous way of aining experience in e field .
I would be happy too , if by any chance I could ppy to summer jobs or internship , as anohe way of gaining xperiene .
Working as an intern at an informaion tecnology company or as a teahe assistant would provide me wth a good example of how the marke wo for th academc and wor creer .
In conclusion , I want to study in the U.S. for it 's differentated educational sytm , for te work and research opportuniie at I might fd , to no btter a culue that amazes me fr its capacity to novate in ll ilds , to beome luent in a lanuag tha I love , to rtrn to my country wh moe knowledge in reas at I woul ot fn here , n , in lng - term , bcome a betr rofessional or taher , wt a od d soid backgund on computer sciences , inforation technology a finaly , system anasis ad deeopment .

" Installtio a " is a e for of expression ade of a mixte of media at orks , used by contempora artss to communicate somehing in a moern way , different frm tradtional arts .
Installations e uualy plced in big spaces beause they hv an important structur with th ma task of akin people reflec on something imprtant that te atst eds to communicate to the biggest numb of pele .
Persally , I have seen only one " instalation art " .
It was siuated ino a stand in Parque Dl Reiro , in Madrid .
It was built by to diferent elemnts .
Th firt , paced in a corner of th tan , w md by a pile of plastic bottles and plastic bkets .
Te second , in h entre of the stan , was a column made of colure plastic basets , srrouned by plastic bttls .
The arist wated to represent the difference between e cologica recycig of platic comaed to te common colection of trash .
Seeing it for the first tm it was imposile to understad he meain of the colum or the ple .
Ony afr havin read the explantion it w possible to ppreciate te installation rt , and to hav he cplete attention to s meann and shpe .
Despite the beay , w form of ats are ey complicated to understn , espcially compared to classical ars .
An example could be the edieval a .
Seeing a Da Vinci 's ortrit or a landscpe painting , it is immdiatly osible to appreciate the bauty of colurs or t accuray of shap and h expession of the sjects painted .
At first ght the painins evke an emotion in the observer , and the name of the piece hels to hae a complete knowledge of the masterpiece .
On the other hand , looig at an istallation art it is ader to have a cer emotion at te first sight without knowing h meaning of it or somthing about the artist .
In onclusion I ink that all form of art are made r e same reason , to communicate something .
In evey istric priod , artists hav represented their li an what they feel in ifferen ays .
Cassical t w more easy o us to undersan ecause it has been studied at sool ad it is very famo , while modern at r toaly nw and more coplicated to nderstand because of their composition and their significance .
In my opinion the differece beteen installation arts an classical rs stands in the eling ta the c suscitate in e audence .
Dear Camp Direcor :

eel the wind !
Kitesurfing - this pot discline is getting me and more popuar not oy in ounries sh as Australia , urke or gypt , bt also in ther ones , just lik Poland or Gemay !
Everyon w ha ever stood on a rfboard and tried to catch the wind with a kte knows how wonrful it is .
A feeling of eing cmpetely free , a joy of moving on a surface of water tnding on a mll bar , an incredible ped - al of hse thngs c easily make you hpy .
he I tried kteurfing by myself for the first te , I ws a ltte bit scared . "
How ifficult it is ! " - ha was my vey rst thought ile seeing om surfers on the Baltic s in Polnd .
But beliv me - there 's nothig to worry abou !
epite the fct that it ems hrd , kitesurfig is one of the easiest atr sports !
If you just lern w to keep a control of your bod stnding on a surfboard and ow to seer a kte , tee 's nothin tha seems ha any mr .
My onl advice is : go to th seaside , in a nice mp f sufers ih a good instructor , an njoy your moments of feedom !

As I said earlier , I graduated fom gh Schoo hich was a ue rlief .
It w aweful .
h stdens wre mean n the tahers dd n't lke me at al .
So on the day the vaation stated I was t hpiest I 've ever been .
hs came te quesion of ht I was going to do next , but I s n't rea to mak tha desission back te so wit agrement of my pents I decided to ta a a - year .
Which was the best ting that ever happened to me .
I ws extremly nervous about a wee before my departre .
I s going to end the nxt 6 months in te Uited Sttes which actualy teriffied me .
As my eprture cme closer , I strted to question myel ore and me if this s a good ea and if I woud have a good ime all those things .
On the big day I st a that I kind of el numb , I did n't nw wat to thk and hat to fel .
The journ to the Uited States was surpisingly ood , I had se friends on t pan who were going to the same destination as me and I actual did n't miss my famy ht much .

I lso got to know myself betr and I have reache a descssion of wht I want to do nex yea , I am gong to study at th universiy .
I hope tha I wil eoy that as mu as I enjoyed is past year , it was truly aazing .
So if u are ever even cosidering h fact of taing a a - year , do n't dub , just do it .
It is amazng !
Wen I ot to the oor , I rlised suddenly tht something wa wrog . I anously turned and oked at the winow .
It was lightly pen .
I felt cold sat on my back .
I w sure tat I d n't left the indow open .
So who ha ‚Ä¶ ?
I s wonderin tha ayb it 's ust my imagination .
I had be taing at home r fie days , I was n't rely willing to see oher peope .
ybe I have gone mad ?
I stared blankly at the winow , unable to mo .
Evetualy , I slowly opened the door n came u of my roo .
I went to t kitchen d st on he chair , nervously fiddling with my bracelet .
It suddenly brk aart , and ll the beads dropped on the lor .
In tat sinier sience , it seeme to be the odest sound on the wrl .
Al of udden , my phone rng .
It wa my best frid .
" Laura ?
Ar o okay ?
We hvn't talked r ages " , e si .

I ha been feeling so lonly for a lo time .
Bfoe I made it to ell somehing , I hard terrible scream and my fend js hung up .
I et col sweat again , jst lie fi minutes ago wn I 'd se open window .
After a little while , I heard a hoarse ice coming fm the rom with the pn wind . "
Lura ?
Coe ere .
We hvent't talked r age " .
It w my best friend 's voice .
We at Mhura Nagr , undertand the need of protecin the environment n hence r comitte to what we do .
We limit the number of houses n th umber of pele liing in the houses because mo people would mean we have to cear vast expanes of land for housing whch wuld mea a reuction in e umbr of trees ad a dathbow to e natra blance .
We as see that people adhere to he ors when they build new hoses and do n't encroach on any pblic lns .
We encourage people commuting to naby places to walk or s a bicycle deending on the distance ad those gig to th sme aas outde he town to oin ca pools .
We also ha a biogas plant in our outskirts th takes car of the rubbish and sewage n e owe generated is ue f stret - lights nd meeting the por eeds of the community ofice .
We dsribute jte bags nnually wt ou communiy log on it so th people cn use them inted of lastic bags .
Eah ea , we encorage schl - goin children to plant trees to teach them the imprtane of trees in safeguarding our vironment so tht tey can ro up to be esponsible tords the environment .

Dear MR . mith
I oud le to appy for the jo as a security guard o he Openai Frauenfeld as advetied in your Facebook - post fo h 18h of Juy .
My name is Mihae Frean an I 'm twenty - nn yer old .
I 've ben oring as a securty uar in a l of places arnd the wod .
I was in a position of a lade fr a atie Perry concert and I worked for Angela Merk whe Fran√ßis Hollan aried in Brln .
I was a paramedic in irt plc but then I wanted to chnge sometng in my le n combined my hobb , which is going to e gy , nd bcam a eurity .
With these xpeiences I can safely scrt popl , whic are knocked ut or a bit l and ca n't stad th concert anymore , out of a concert d hl them .

I ik alos ll ind of sports .
he only exception is volleyball - I jt ca n't pay it , I even do n't kw h .
But I love baseball a hadball - especialy the first one - every me when we a playng basketball at school durin Pysical Edcation , I 'm so hay about it ad I do my bet . I do n't ko how to expain why I love is ge so mch .
Mabe it 's because in basketball , o have to run a lot n you have to be reall fast , n my second favourite sort is running .
Anyway - if omone ake me f advi about basketball , I ould say : do n't giv up if you are n't t bst play on te wol . I 'm ao not .
And truly , w cares ?
If you ejoy ts pot , ju do it and nothing els matrs !
Being famous seems to be the best thin tat can happen to us .
ut no matter w fabulous it looks , it brings me consequences and even problems .
One of he biggest disadvantages of bei poulr is that they are on everybody 's lips .
Public loves to know everything about their dols an they always ty to find out some spicy etails .
Everyone deserves privacy , u pblic fiure shud be aware of the ct at the scity wants to know abt them as uc as it 's possible .
Whther ey like it or not , ey shld be pepare r photographers an journalists trying to chs them in every single mment of their lif .
It mght be hard , bt ey ned to be patint a t o to ce about the pple who iterfres with their personal being .
In my opinion , ournalists n paparazzi should n't tal celebrities on heir private holiy or try to get nto ther intimate life .
here re some brders tht should n't be crsed .
or examle , hn a pular film tar oes to spital because of is relative 's illness , reporters ad photographer in particular should sy ay and leve the celebrity lon .
ve though tey ar wll nwn , they ave a right to have a free time and hy should be albe to se it howevr ty wn to without anyne disturbing he .
It 's ally portant for people to know the bound between curiosity d nosines .
We should repect other 's ight to privay a let them live teir own liv .
Natu is oe of te ost important tee in the Romantic Age , snce it is a realit th inpire an writers , both ovelis and pts .
It as been an important subject especially for wrier from the ' ' first eneration '' lik Willia Wordsworth ; he sa natue as an inseparabl reality fro an , whereas it comfrt in sorow and teces to love n to ct in a moral wa .
In the Romnti Age we can in another iortant subject based on te concept of ture : t sublime .
It is associated with strong emotion cause natral spectacles , like huricnes , waerfalls or starry sy
The sblim inspird many writers likeW. rdworth d S. Coleridge , who d a concetio of it as he feeing brougt by e ve of ininite spaces , ie desert , s or ocean .
The de of the ublime that Wordswoth had is onsidere by mny as te standard idea of e Romantic sublime : orm of nature tat inspie feeling of awe , danger or wkness .
Als Coleridge d a concept of sublime , but for him it as associated with ininit spaes and the ens of pedition and sspens .

et in in e at 1950s ranc , Chocolt deals with te topic of society iscriminatin aainst different eople because of ter being different : weher he r gysies , women that do n't deped on men , or eople hat do n't sae te Chistian faith .
The po reolves around Vianne Rocr , a single mother a cocolate eert , opening a ' choolaterie ' right before Lent in a mall , close - nded French village , the mayor of wch decides to boyot her .
Dung Lent , th protagonist ges to know other outcsts ( mainly wom ) and elp thm .
However , Vianne must ler to solve e on probles d hange th curse of her own life .
One of t stengths of t film is its star - tudded cst : Juliette Binoche as Vianne , Alfred Molina as the ayor , udi Denh as a rmpy , elder oman resented ith the oppressin society of te village , and a yong Jnny Depp as a handsome gypsy arrivng in town with his caraan .
Each and very one of te roe is beauiully writtn an the actors do n't fail in bringing the to life .
Besides th cast , I would le to highiht the origil soundtrack .
It adapts erfectly to th theme of he movie , with a ittl bit of jz manouce , a popular gnre amongst European gypsy communities , and reminscenes of Mexican folklore , as he recis Viane Rocher prepares in the ' chocolaterie ' are a herage from her Mya ancestors .
If I had to find a dwn side to Chocolat , it uld be tt h film fort oes not allw us to hv a deee look into some of the chracters and teir storylines .
Had it ot en written in h ear 2000 , but today , I am sure that this stor woul hae ben turned into a successful TV series in which we could ave lernt more about th past and h fure of thse fantastic characters .
l in all , th is a gripping , moing , nd entertaining fil tht wl make y reflect on some soia issues .
A must - e if , like me , yo eno cema wit strn feale characters on the ld roles , bt you do not necessarily want to watch another dramatic story .
Michel Ciffor was a uky m wh had everything he uld eve want : he ws a thirty - yar - old Englsh businssman rried to a sophisticated mathematician wi whom he d wo sons d a rety tented daughter ; he oned a sucessful corporation nd d a gorgeous chalet ea te sea .
n night , havin nded a meetin with an important sponsor , chael deide to enter a ub with one of is colleagues in order to ceebrate he successful meting .
He hardly ever runk alhol , but thought it would be impote not to , as he had been invited by s colleague .
herfore , he proceeded to have some drinks and to ejoy h night .
Lae that night , whle icael as cheerfu chatting wi the barman , is mobie phone emitted a sound .
He took a lk at it and sa a message rm his wf .
Worried , he ened it d ed , in hrro , how s wife h had an accident and was in hospital .
He rushed out of e ub , on the r and went inside , o knowing th he ws to die in an accidet because of i curnt state .
Michael cloed th doo an knew at that moment he h ad a mistake .
Traelling has become a gat par of our daily lives , wheher we nl go to the nearby ocery store or choose to vsit u reltives wo live in another counry .
Modrn ean of transort e constantly impovin , being faster and oe comfortabe thn vr efre .
However , it is a wise decision to choose carefully between puic and persnal ranspot , because he av bh adantages and disadvantages dpening on whee we want to travel .
On the ne hand , personl cas a great ecause thy allow people to travel whneve hy wn .
Tis eans thy are ale to have a flexible schedul .
Another advantge of cas is the fact that they ar family friendly , meaning tht people who use them do n't have to wor about trvlling ith strages who igt be dangrous .
On t the hd , cars are not only eensive to purchae , they also equie fuel , which is vry expensive .
Someimes it is eaper to use public transport such as busses , trains or airplanes , depndin on te distance .
Travelling across he Atlatc Ocean f example requirs an airlae or a hip .
Trains are a grea wa of transprt across intercotinental distanes , epecialy ice ey have become ster .
Statistially speaking , c accidets a much oe frequent than plane crash or train accidents , so public transport is not only cheper sotimes , but it 's al safer and faste .
ll in all , I believe that public transport ll no disappear o soon .
Arlanes , busses , trains or ships e here to sa because they ar mor practicl in some stuations .

Poland is cassed as a country wh a har histo ad a lo of places remind about it .
Besides their past we can , fortunately ador their eaty .
One of these plces is , undoubtdly , Kazimier , h Old Jewis ditrict of Cracow .
In this small pt of racow , you can meet it Jewish cutre and the architectural style .
Fir , you should visit the New Cemetery .
It was established in 1800 .
Fr those who ter it wll be an ' uforgettabe ' experience .
You walk among ancient , falln tombs shaded by ig tres of geat age .
hn , you really must visit h synaggues : e Temple Synagogue , Isaac Synagogue , The Ta Syaggue an Remuh Synaggue .
The ynagogue is still being sd as a plae of prayer for h few remainin Jewish people in Cracow or o visitors from Israel or other parts of the wod .
For th history oers , I reommend going to h Historical Mseu of The Hisory and ultre of Jwsh People .
It is th olst synaoge in Poland ad was constructed in th XV century .
Inside there is an impressive nber of handicrafts , graphics an paitings .
Finay , you a do shopping on T Nw uare , a roun tadng hal .
You can buy the almost everything : fresh fruits , vegetabes , and househld proucts .
On Sundays , t gamut of rodcts is much oe bigger .
If y r a good browser you may find ome original soueirs of Crac to take ome it y .
I thik e Kazimierz is one of the ot beautiful plae in Pand .
It 's appeali an full of is eeri spirit of the pas .

Parents face with important decisions we raising children , not the least of whic is wheter or not they should allow their children to keep a e .
Som parents uld grasp in horror and reject it whn ther chld asks them if he a kep a p ith him , whereas ote prens wld be more than happy to e their chilren hae a pet .
In my view , I believe that children houd have pe bcause th an enefit from tking re of pets , especally in ter of heir personality development .
Specifically , the len to ta responsiblty hen taking cr of ets .
Tk my cat , ka , fo example , I ound it on the sreet and lt lie keeping it wit me when I was 12 years old .
My mother told me hat ou woul hae to ake cr of it by youself when I wnt to a her if I oul kep e c .
Since that day , I stated to take cae of on my o .
I tok it to th ospial when it w sck , d boug it food when it neded to be fe .
I have herefre fstered a sense of responsiblity since then .
So , accoding to my prsona experiences , I ink tha children can enefit from keepng a p .
oe people might argue that it is always pares o ke car of h pt mos of te time , instead of children themselves .
Nmey , arnts always do things for childen , sch as housework , homwork , eve taking ca of the pe for heir chdren .
Nevertheless , what hoe pople have claimed is a digression rom he topic here .
Th ds o suggest that chlren cn t lar from having a p with the .
Why children can nt lean is because of teir arents , ot becaus of t ets .
In oth words , takin care of ps is absolutely beneficial to cildren so lo as they e gven an opportunity .
Moreover , children cn also earn to sympathize it thrs by keping a pet , apar ro eanig to be reponsible .
r instne , when Luka die we I was 20 ars old , I a so a and heart - broken as if one memer a lost in or family .
After tht y , I started to be ale to sympathize wit people wh ave lost their beloved ne because I hav een through a similar situation .
hs , keeping pes des enae peol to be abe to u themselves in othes ' shes .
Given pon my personal experenes , by takig cr pets , children o ly n larn to take rsponsiblity , bu also an arn to sypathize with others .
In other words , keeping pets is eeficial to childrn in trms of tei personality devopment .
On the other hand , if chldren are not llowed to kee a pet , h parents wll have to coe up it the ay to ke the cidren both reponsible a sypthetic .
We always believe that a city should ner compromise the envirnmen fr the sak of develpment .

People oten forget w imorant it is to he sae t environment on a day - to - y bsis , yet I believe it is not nly t frt step , but the mos impotnt to pblic awareness .
Living in a big city I can cyc to work every day , which I bliev is a great way to eercis ad redce my enviromentl footprint .
Besies , cycing aong a anal allows me to itnss flowers and tree blossoming ad fowls ' chicks growing up , remindig me of te beauty of nature .
However I believe hat it is at hm that I contribute mt to avig natural resurces ; we are , obviously , ver careful wh tring of e taps as we wash our ands , brsh o teh and so on , nd we recycle as much as pssble .
Ye , our most rewardn action has been sating a compst .
We feed worm ou food ad organic waste , which has drasically decreased it .
Mreover , we now use e copst for ur garde path n cacti .
Another god poit : we have converted our net or neighbour !
Comosting has made us more aware of o waste and the aount of packang in the tem we b .
I 'd definitly recommend it to evryon , wether they live in a flat or in a house it a garden .
Shopin is not aways enoyable .
We iv in te mass consumption cenury , whe it requires more ad more tim of ou dai rounes .
F som ti ctiviy is a torture , for others it is the most leaurable wy of spnding free time .
B have you ver gone to e sho us or ilk and bread a came bc wit a full b of goos u no rad ?
First of all , hoppin is unavoidable as it is necesry to so or foo .
It deeds on a prso h fen he goe to grocey , probbly acording to indvidual eds .
Mst of cnsumes do not count time sen in od tres , as hy hav teir ow habits a their atiudes toars soping .
Sme people chooe bgger supermarkets as they ffr greatr ariety of goods , ut require more time , while others just pop ito th losst store and do thr shop eely .
If ou ha a alredy made shping it , it saves yo ime ad energy , so at yo do not need to wander betwen rows in grocery store .
When it comes to partie it is en more tm consumng d irsom , than e ordinary on .
Mreove , the mo anoying is he last stage of buyin goods - waiting in queues in oer to pay .

Secndy , shopping in suermarkets is exremey rriating befoe annl celebrations , or durg seasonal sle .
Hundre gather there , parking aces a ful , again faci longest queue in stos - ow uch unplasant is souds , it is th realiy of nowadays .
People become azy , nervous or dull hile shopping .
Afterwards some get into their cars d ge stck in trfic jams on t y hm , it causes more tenion d disimproves mood !
lso , sm peope end huge sums of money on thins tht re not esntial , they are atracted by commercials , advertisements , ale assistant recommendatns , so ty do ot follow thei budgts by buying everything , as they are excied by t shopping process islf , it cuss regrets and financal problems aftewards .

It comes as no surpris tt women ov hopping .
Althouh , shoing ay be entertaining , it is still a time consuming nd tiresome job .
Being busy and snding ie looking for cthes , presents , souvenirs , furniture or healthcare roducts especial fr women may be a perect y of spending even all day .

Fast oo is oe of ways to sov ta problem .

There are huge positive effcts of atig as foo .
ist of l is cnvenence .
eopl who have just done thir work are vry hgry ; they an t go to home and ck their diet eals by thmselve ut their bodies eed to be provided ener in rder to sustain their lives and coinue their jobs , so nk food is considre the st y to sole the hunger .
To make it clear , te bosses , wo are always busy in thir busines , usully eat at food , they go to KF or ottie Mart to buy them they ve might t fast food by pone ecause of fat delivery .
In aditon , Junk food is er sy to be found out .
The ar numerous stores an restaurants whih have junk food built eveywhere .
Therfre , finding a go place to bu and enjoy a el th fast fo is not so iffcult ad it wll not take time or people to go ba their wor on time .
On e other hnd , eating fas food fequently my lead to om negtie effct on customer 's healt .
Firstl , fast od is unhealth .
Jnk fod contains arge nhalthy hemicals such as hgh percentag of f and cholesterol whic re the most reasons leading customers to obesity n cancers .
Accoding to scintiss they said that people who sualy at plenty of junk food will he mr than 50% of rsk to get obe a even e son .
Furthermore , most of nk fo just solves hunger in a ort time ad the it will quicy return to the customers after he hv felt full .
Finlly is the loss of taitional meals .

As the consequence , ey gradually frget how to ook a impl el n t diversity of halthy fd is slightly ne .
In cocusion , her e a lo of advantage a disadvantages of fst food .
Some advantaes are tat fas food can el to save time and deal wi te temporry hunger r white - collar - wrker , t it can al harm their halh .
The customer should be creful before ty choose fast food to be a art of thei daiy di .
Facebook is the most popula socal networking site of all te .
Within 6 ers , Facebook has ached me than 1 billion ers and till growing rapidly .
I would n't conside yself agaist it , although I am awre of the risks .
First of ll , I think Facebook , f example , is a great wa o shy people to socialize , because it can boost thir self - stee , cnsidering the ft that they do n't hae to meet anyone face - to - face .
It 's lso great if we want to manage r friendships , or create new oe .
As a shy prsn , I can confirm e difference tween ra life and virtual ieracion .
Socal etworing site alo benet thoe w av " unusual " obbies or tose w have a had time fnding peole with simar inerests .
r eample , if ou wn to find someone who likes the am movie genders or eris on scia mia , all o have to do is te in an itrest .
On the ther hand , we are also exposed to mny risks , such as cyberbullyng or onne predaors .
hle it can seem harmless , cyberbullying ases my problms amon teenagers , such as depressio , suicida thoughts or evn wrs .
Spending o mch time on e internet also has harful effts on or fmily lives , becae we tend to forget how important it is to spend im it thos w love us .
To conclue , althuh socia meda seems flwles , we should aways be reful and responsible before we sign up .
Dear Cam Diretor ,

I have alway wanted to be part of something lke is .
I am realy hrdworkig nd love kid , I usd to babysit for my neighour 's is , so loong after ds will be easy for me .
I am lso very cerful a energeic , and am very od at ornising fun activties .

I oe you tin I 'm the right person o hs , I think tis would be a great eperienc for me as well as r he kids .
eopl nd Change "
This is cerinly true n coresponds wi my eperience .
Sme people do manage to ty in the sm place al her lives ad eve work or h sa company , whle others a much or obile in ers of hir jbs and home .
I fe tat this can be attributed in the first instance to the changing natu of modrn soieties .
In the past , it was h norm for ople to liv in a limitd geographical area all their livs and be invoved in the same type of occupation all teir working lives .
There a simly no alternative to his , especially if ou ived in an agricultural society .
Howevr , with th ise of inutry and specalized comnies , it beme possible for workrs to move jobs , oten to laces far aay .
Followng on from ts , as a society 's ealth incresd , people had sills and training to low tem to be mch more selecti about wch employe they want to work for an choices about h a when they wanted to chage he ype of jb they ishd to do .
We a , thereoe , in a situation in many countries tod where to be ihly mbil is something
that pple ak fo granted ad rard as perfectly normal .
Wit t opportuity fo ange coms choice , although circumstnces , economc and personal , ca often for pple to do what the might not normlly coose .
Therefore , it hppes tat som eole nt chnge in their lives but ar not able to effect it .
Th migt be becuse te have tron obligations to fily , ght ne to lok after someoe or might simply not have marketable skills to fnd a livelihood somewhere ele .
There are ther , of course , who are qut hap to ve d or in the same lace all their lis becaus hey do not think moving wou ehnce thir lives .
Some r happy to stay put because they would fd it very stressful to endur cange .
It is perhas the jority nowadays who fnd chne refreshing because of the new opprunities it hlds t and the possibiiies of gettig on professionally and soially .
For myself , I vey muc belg to this grop .

bortion is a conroversial ssue in r society today .
om Pro - choice groups n individus believe tha a pero ave to right of choe , this ncludes the right to ecide if th want to give birt or no .
Contradicting he Pro - choice grps , Pr - lfe supporters conider terminting ay renancy unjustifable .
En thog in ome circustances , suc as life threaening n sexual abuse pregnancies , it could be he best thing to do .
Hence , very woman ut be able to ae aborion as a choe .
Abortion can be gen as an ption in fe threatening.pregnancies .
The presence of a mthr is important in a child 's life espeilly in the first few months .
During the irs mnths , he relationship between a mother n a child rapily devlops .
h baby 's inborn capaity of imitation and relation of visual and auditiv stimulation , is gradually patterned nd thi is supported by te mother 's empatetic response .
( ier.l,198 )
This natura process wol be ntrrupted by the absence of te mther and the ild 's development could be in his case egatively influenced .
Develpmnt of etional and psychological problem such as atrnal depration ca be a resul .
Th child ill hve ifficulties buildng n ustainng relatioshps during dlt - life .
Beaue of this risk abortion an be considered an optin .
Besides , abortion could also be considered in case of impregnation as a rsult of sexual abuse .
Impregnatin as a result of sexual abuse is not uncmmon a in these cases borton should be a choie .
Sexual violence has a devastating imct on victims , all areas of a icim 's life is affected .
Recovring is a hard and complcated prces a when yo add a regnanc to is equation it js makes it vn more painful .
In fct , hi is the main reason why sexually ssaultd victims cose to have an aboion .
ny victims believe that h dditional auma rlatd to caring their rapist child can be aoided by teinating te pregnancy , ad terefore help th pu h assault ehind tm ad recover more qicky .
Even though , n a victims will chos to have an abortion it has to be given as an option .
Even if , abortio has to be gen as a choice in special cas , it is not a soluions f accidental prgnancies .
It is for the person who ecides to hav otus to ak sure to use appopriate anti conception .
Otherwise , u my run the rk that peol seing abortion as an easy wa to get id of an uwante pregnancy .
In oder to reent thi , it is important to apply strct guidelines regarding situation where aotion is given as an opton .
Abortion on has to be approved as an optin in life threatening.pregnancies or if he ther s ben sexually molested .
Undeterred by this , it still the mother 's dcision if she wants to save hr on if or cry an ca or hr rapist child .

First of l , the professor says hat the majority of Italian techers r not ll pepard to do thei work ad , conseuently , stdens do n't hieve te skls they should to success in a fure wk , but I do n't agree wit this sttment .
I think ha t eal problem ta mes or schools so u - of - date coparing to that of other countries is h a teachers ge in tuch ih studens and transmit them tir knowledge .
As a matte of fact tudens are ten seen as emp pitchers reay to be filed by as many information as they can otain .
Teachers should n't alk bot the subjects without caring if thei tuents are relly listnig to what they 're saying or o , and they shod n't let them sdy ut because they mut .
They should ak tir studets li school as a pleasant expeince , as somehin their futue is based on .
econdy , in hi letter the profess suggets tat school ould sed ore money on omputer euiment .
I agree wih his rcommedation because I think it 's mportant for schols to ae he se progresses the soety dos ar by ye , ffring always nw materials and echnoogies , such as cmpters or interacive whitboards in casrooms , making studying more intersting a soetime al easier .
Thi is what , in my opinion , must be chngd in schools to satisfy th society necessties and overcme the od and inappropriate " out - of - ate " system .
Should shols sped re on computers and sofwar tn on extboks ?
Nowadays , sudents ca work with ompters at school and most of them av oe at oe .
Many pole el tat it is good to do their student life easier .
Howver , it also has some disadvantages .
On he o hand , I firmly believe tha students can fi more valuable iformation on textbooks because he have existed for many centuries .
For his rean , I blieve that tey have content more reliable .
Furhermore , if you go to a lirary , u could pen all y seeing books and learnig about different thins so in hse lace there are mny acient oks .
On h ther ha , I personally thi ta pupils enjoyng moe workng with textook becae they can do thi activiy with classmate and they can help eh other .
Also , in my opinion , young peple should not se compuers fo much time because thi could be dangerous for thir health , apearing sight problms or hedaches .
Tain everything into accont , in my pinion every stunt houl have a goo encyclopadia at hom ecause it is much better o tir education .
There is a lot of people I admire , starting with my own parents as they have to wor so hard to end lie n to a t re as we as their employees nd to give us- my brother ad me- a good living tda and futue tomorrow .
We lking about famous eople , I usually pon u J.K. Rowling .
As a wrter - to - be I admr her rk reating a fantastic world of maic and epic as well as drk caractrs whic are recognizable al aoun e globe .
Tha is wy , in act , I am a big fan of Geore R.R. artn as wel .

Friends , colleagues , fami all thes pele who was next to me on tis way to this wondefu ay .
The day when I am oud of myself , happy to loo back and curious to lok forward .
If ou 've been following my blg , you 'll ko that I 've ben on a journey of discovery and creation concernn using techology to create materials d using technology to teah .
I have just started teachig a e , face to ace group of duts .
I ws excited to e back nto e clssoom , I ainly teah online today , nd try ou ome of my n skills on a grp .
I checked te eqipent : I had a computer n projector , both in god working rder , a fat intent connection and a full clas .
I as rady and raring to go .....
As oon as the lihts wet out , the atmosphere chane in the classroo ad I fe e tension is .
ne student said tt she could n't ee well , noter student complined that t writing was too smal , anothr el se was geting to hot rom the projector .
Te group 's native nguage is Amhait ; te have all had to ern Hebr , so English is a third or or som of tem a frth languag .
I 'd chosen a method of techng tht was not sutable or the group .
hs is a roup of beginners , the exprienc of a first lessn wit a w teacher is daunting enough , without addig unfamilia tchnolgy and teaching metds .
So I wtched f the projector , ok t my wte board pen , dusted f my flh cards a reverted back to traditional methods of teachig .
We 've had three esson so far and I 'm horoghly enjoying techng this grop ; it 's a leasue to teach face - to - face ad a challenge to teach dults at this lvel ; it 's really rea to et ' back to basics ' .
Ti experience has reminded me tha although there are ny advantages to using technology in t clas room , it 's n away approrate a it 's helpd me to establs some eqilibrim in my teaching methods .
Instead of creating some online lessons o this wonderful group , I have taken the opportunity to crae sme new rntable materls to hand t in clas .
his ot will be t first of tee on e topic of the resnt Simple tens , it contais a printable infographic covering t basics of the Presen Simple ad two printable worksheets .
Are yug pople less ealth than they were ears ago ?
owadys , there is an ncreasing conen about the halth of oun people , snce thee is no doubt that it is etting ore .
To egin with , rect statistics veal that obese adolescet ' rato is riig .
As we as hat , the ifestyle of our socty is using us to be ore passive .
An last bt t least , it seems that new technologies ar not helping to dveop their soil a intellectual skills .
The reasons col be , firstly , fast foo is cheaper n very accessible for young eole .
In additin , spending to mch time in activities like watching TV , sufig the Intrne or playing video gmes prevent them rom don sprts .
And finally , teengers may become more dependent d introvere bcause of electronc evies such as bile phone or peronal comuter .
Actually , it is t comlicated to change habits in order to be healthir .
For instance , filling e ridge with a great amout of frh frut nd vegetale , dng sm exrcie ad hae som fn ith fends reglrly .
Hi Ben
How ar you ? I 'm taking a year off and aying in Londo fo six months so I op u can elp me if it is n't too mch to as .

Advances in computer science ha created a tremendous lep in technical innovations .
ne of the most reent outstanding nnovatins is robotc .
Lavine , oss and Coontz ( 27 ) define robotics as h combinaton of " utomatin with action d at times a considerable amount of mobity " wic is " ecoming re d moe manoid"(p .
1083 ) .
The ore computer scienc influnes human 's lve , the more important tatus robotics a in the field of engineering .
Only a decade year ao , robotics was jt limited to cietific research .
However , today it is used in more ields , uc as medical treatment , elderly - nursing and archaeological studies , as wll as educatio .
Thi essay will discuss the current social consequences of robtis in the ra of edution , ad then conclude by commenting on its pssibe futur mplication .
In the first place , robotics acvity could provide learnes wt real siuation hch are related to irrelative courses , especially in cientifi and medical ones .
Tnzawa et al . (
202 ) described an exeriment from howa University whih amed to tst ho wel dental stuets could deal th emergency situation .
The result incated hat athough the patient wre merely robts , out of 98 candidates , oy 22% students orectly gave the dianoses .
From a survey , 78% nd 72% of studets cosiderd robot patients to be useful in medical emergey a risk training , whilst 63% of hm hoght it had a grt aue in training o surgcal treatment .
It is obvious th in hs experiment , students could acuire knowledge mre effectively an tecers cod lso realize weaknes of stdets specficall .
Scond , rbotics n be taken advantage of to make studying n teachg effectie and efficient .
University of Southern Denmark organized an experiment , wich amd to examin how well robotics techniques ned I - BLOCKS ( a modar electronic building block sysm ) uld do on lanuae tts .
Surprisigly , e result illustrated tat tese robots an not only put words in rght order grammatically , b als recoise whether a sentence is corec or not .
Furthermore , the I - BLOCKS application could also build structure of robots whi re smart to rac to surroundings , and uid bnary expresson to calculate in real - ime and show both final results an ub - resls ( Lun , Mai , & Plma , as cte in Niesen & Lund , 20 ) .
ith the help of robotics , li I - BOCKS , studnt and techer might spn es tim on studying n sme sophisticated processs a simplified as we .
Nevertheless , robotics is not tat satisfyin ecaus it is cmplicatd to operate which is always the eson why operators re distracted .
u et al . ( 010 ) describe an experiment that med to tt ifferences of ti on operating robots to do tasks .
T grops of participants were asked to do suture - tng ts n a secondary ta with dstracion , sh as deiion - mking , mmory - task .
They a Grop A : tn medical students aged 19 - 27 who ny had general knoedge abot urgery , and Grou B : four experiened surgicl postgraduates .
It a foud tht there ws an apparent diference on aveage spe and completin me he comparng tasks from students ith bac kowedge nd te one from anther group .
Moreor , in the task ith distraction , experienced grup a 1/3 - 1/2 faster in aalyzing .
ven thouh it become mor efficent to sdy ih robotics ' hep , nasy peratig equires muh tme .
eraps being familr with robotics and ood at operating could he ot of his shortage .
Today , mo people not ony in t field of education , but also in diferent fields , have made use of robotc as tool to deepen their explorig and studying .
It is ossibl that e roboics oud be a normal pat of individual 's lives .
Mordoch et al.(2012 ) md some exaples of rootic in daily livs : social humn - robot , soial assistive robot , therpetic obot , menal commitmet robot , re robot , robot - theray .
To a country , robotics cul be new weapns for th future technological war .
Howver , there is oe debate that it is gaist etic to let warrior rbots prtcipate in oder wars and igh it rea solder ( rop , 2012 ) .
Becue of its unlimited otential , robotics will be used a mre widely in the ftue .
However , diadantages of robots and om social or ehica probes should be conidered careully whl obotics is contributing to human 's lve .
In concsion , wt technology and computer science developing , plication of robtcs widens fro sientific resarh to a vriety of feds no .
Beses infuenes on education , robotics a an efct on mdical treatment , nring d eve esgn to future wa as wl .
Even tough rootcs brngs more benefcial coseqences n advantaes th is disadvantages , t shortcomings still should o be neglected and mr scintific research hould be doe to improve applcaton of robotics .
Is her no future fr ubic ransport ?
It directly dpends on e city in hich you lve t , as tm goes by , public tranport becomes mr and more necessary .
Living in a bi city is always a ig callenge .
You uually have to commute to work d it takes you seera hour pr week to ge to yu ofic .
Public transprt llows you to ve time and mone in commuting .
esides , it offers yu pre me to rad and listen to music , provide ou an in a sa n hae a clm trip .
Pulic transport is so necessary in big ctis that a inustr is continuously deveoping new means of transprt .
Not onl an customers choose a wide range of transport to commute , but hey can also discovr technologies that ae nt available fo piate purposes .
On the oher hnd , public trasport is t so acceped in smal illages , as it is not possible to offer a wde range of sevices ad timetables .
In sml ciies it is easiest to travel by car .
In n cs , ublic transprt is far fro having no future .
On th contrary , it should widen its gls an contiue offering e services for he tie being .
There are so ny nice paces in Russia .
Th ar sattered acrss the it .
Evry plae has its w dstinc features .
Some places av sceic beauty in audance wile may ae famou fr their architctural wnders .
In addition ver pron has different tastes , choices and references .
me people enjoy te sight of seni beauty ; some e attratd towards places of istoical nd rchaeological interests .
I av visited ma historical and turis paes in many countries lk Bgium , Great Brtan , Spain and oters .
ut t visit which as a lasting impresson on my mi is th visit of Red Square .
It is the st beautiful ace I have ever seen in Moscow .
Nohere exprsss Moscow , Rssia 's vas nd anient capil lk Rd Sare .
An enormous 400 by 150 etres , R Square es in t centre of oscw and on is four sides stand t emlin , UM ( Deartment Store ) , State Historical Museum and Cathedral of te Prottion of Most Hy Theotoos ( aka St. sil 's Cathedral ) centres of government , commerce , istry and religion .
The sqare is lso home to Lei 's tomb , a granite mausoleum to the eveed founder of Soclism .
Te must - see place is St. Basil 's Cathdral , the beautiful rchiectural symbo of Rsia .
It cludes domes , cupolas , arce , towers , and spires is sure to inpir y every bit as mch in real life as in t photos .
At e norhern ed of e square you wi fin the State History Museu with its huge collection of rtefacs chartng Rusa 's past rgt bak to the sto age .
Al these and ma or like its cultural plas , amos streets conncted to square and gorges as well as old buildings ak it " spirit of Msow " .
Inded , the beauty of Mcow is encantng and have nque spirit .
Comre an contrast Dickns ' and t Bront√´ sisters ' sty of writing .
The man feaur of Dicke ' an t Bot√´ sters ' style of wriing is realis .
All hse ictorian novelists use ery etaild desciptions of places , people and feeing in orer to ae tei novels as ealitic as posible .
Anyay , Dickens ' style is that of senimental realism , whh mixes comy and pathos , whl the Bront√´ sisters ' eaism is plenty of Romantic and Gothic elements and it 's widely infleced by he desolate nlish Mos , wee th re up .
In addiion , Dickens , as long as Charlotte and Eiy Bot√´ in soe of teir novels , se ute frequently e frs - person narration .
For example , in " Dvid Coperfeld " , Dickens 's most autobiographial novel , the tory is tale with a fit - peson narration wth t poin of ve of he protonist as an dul .
Charlotte Bront√´ us the same technique in Jane Er , he materpiece .
Finly , in al cass , te stylistic choices are closely linkd with th themes hey deal wth , which always concerned soial issues .
Tnis is made of several ingredients : usense , emotios , physica skills d training ar cobind ith tactics n itelligenc .
Athlet performace is defnitely enhanced by having a fin physique and natul skils .
Neverthlss , a strong and balanced mind plays a huge role in the game of tennis , as shown by famos tennis chamions , ike Michael Can and ustne Henin .
Much shorter ta thir fellw colleagues , they have always be able to compensate or tir phsical aks wh an extremely go tecnique accmpanied by a strong head .
Moreover , tenns ca be seen as a metapor of li .
You are lone on the tenis court to ac your contender .
It is a battle wher you an cont only on yursel .
Thoug yo migh be fiting or lng a gtting tid nd tired , you have to search f the sength inside yourelf to cotnue ad rach te d of the enns match .
Teni also ies a mesage of ope .
You hae nevr to surrender : until he lat bll s bounced twe on t gund , you ae to keep ighting , regardeless of t core .
Fate ma py a role ut you have still to try ad brn out e best of yourself .
Tennis is cosidered a very individualistic sor .
Nonetheess , it hlps to sae your own pesonaity .
I would dfinitely recommend whoever would like to start this sport to aproch it with a good spirit .
Alhough it igt ook difficul at th einning , time ater time yu will com to reals how tennis wl positiely ipac on your persnal el - eig .

It was a ol nih of ovemer I was exploing a lt temple wih my friend Michael , we have be looking for that tmpe since our een years h temple of h slent cartgraper .
The leend says tht al the maps of h world re hddn into th temple protectd by a guardian called Sneka e dreamer , he is an acint arrio an his objective is to kill everyone who tre to ste the ma of the cartographer .
at te etrance of he teple ere t statues the first a white and the second red , the staues wer carrying a sword de of ld a diamond thse swords were se to fht Soneka and to open te gate of th cartographer , ce we asse th sculptures ur objectiv was to kill the beat and gb t ma of e golden iy .
Ten we had a big nois coming ro side the emple it w Soneka his ppearance was glorious a bg warir using a golden armor d a b sword is skils were unmatched , he was faster tn the sund ur oly chance was to ru to he aut of h cartographer but only o an ss through e door of the artogapher Michel decide to stay out he vaul I rn io th cartographer and Michael closed the door and knew at hat momet he had mde a mistake .
Since the cocpt a pelminary implementatin mdel of the Yidis Centre w developed in my office , it a expected ht World ORT wuld participate in the pojct in a e capacities , rather thn just incluing Yiddish compont in our events , sbjct to the theme .
Some of the aspects ave ee discussed during my meting wit Modehai in Agust .
I thin tha , as Robert once recommended , we should iscus he whole spectrum of our cooperation , not just e seminar , define the feasibl components and have a WJC - WO MOU on such suject signed .
Please ve me or avid a cal should yo is to discus th rther .
Nowadays , travelling by car is much me common han we uld ever imgie .
An because hstory has a way of rpeatng itself I truly believe that th olden days of usin pulic transport are making a come bak .
On the n hand owning a car mea idependence , so hat , we ca travel nywere we at , whenever we wan without bin id own to a set timtabl n furthermore , it is certainly moe comortable th public tansort .
On he other hand , today we re forced to share a transport with other peope due to economic probes that ur countr is facing .
People do ot ern as much money as they ued to , in fact they earn a lot less .
his mean hat people a o ffor a car n l the xpenses hat come wi it .
Thefore , ee though a car is re conveient and moe comfortable tha any fom of public transport , it is alo ls economic han th later whih leave pple ih no othr choice than to s plic transport .
Hi Jo :
Hw are you doing ? I 've hrd in the grapevine at u 're aking a killing with your last pc program .
On t contrary , I 'm ju getting ued to look up every da on my comutr .

1 . INTROUTION
The ai of thi pper is to sh , through a transitivity anlysis of e lyrics from ree diffeent songs , how languge ha influenced roles of gndr
T questions we are going to answer about ths songs e :
‚Ä¢ Although the performers are wome , is th language sed sexist ?
‚Ä¢ Does anyone feel lk a ictm ?
The structure is divided in these sections :
- Method : Data selection- T three ons we will be analzed n t reasns why we 've ose tm
- Theoretical backgroud- A review of our knowledg .
We wi exain se oncpts tht we will use lter in our analysis .
- Analysis : his prt is he practicl part hat wi anwer our questions .
he lyrics wil be explained .
Our tools wll be transitivity analysis and languge .
Furthermoe , we will ve some examples of clauses hat repreent better h meaning of r songs .
- Conclusions : The qstions we mde before will be asered .
With our analis done , his fina prt is where th results of r work is rittn a we can te e dierence between these songs and ha we ought at te beginning
- Bibliographical references : The pr whee he sores e revealed
2 . ETHOD : DAT SELECTION
We are going to compare te yrics om the follwing tee sog : ile Cyrs ' Wrecking Bl ; nastasia 's Left Otsde one ; and Taor Swift 's ack to December .
We have chosen thse the songs becas they al del wit the same topic of breaking - up , t they dscrbe this topic fm diferent ponts of view , even though he the sos ar performed by female sigers .
These songs are relatively modern , but if we ta a loo we will find some sexism in soe parts .
Hoeve , ere 's a hope fo women to find a song at oes n't treat thm lik an inferior ender .
This is the cse of th " free hoie " song , Tayor Swift .
Sll , won e t vtim in thre different ays . We will serh or hse situatins tha share th eelings of regret , made by sme specific situations .
Anastasia 's sog tells a stoy of a vicim , meanwhile the othrs tak abut omen th fll guity bease they av hurtd men .
Also , we think that these song an represent different kins of proesss ad language we ae sen in class .
The material prcesses re ls known as t pocesses of ding .
This is ecaue they epres an action or an activity .
hs type of process has en oud in te tre sog and it is ery proifi .
Usually , in tee types of songs , e performers descrie actios in e reltionsips as el as at the end of it .
h material proesses are carried out by agents , whch coinie with he subject .
e subject of he sentence can alo be the orce if h aet is inanimate .
We hav found this ind of agent in th sog with the lov relationship as the subjec .
In hs cteory of proceses , there is anoth prtcipant known as the afecte , becus te action of te eb affcts or ccerns it .
In our search , h cogition veb hav bee the most common inside of the roup of th mentl ones ollowed by h affection ones , which is quite normal whe describig a ove relationship
SON ANALYSIS :
he main participants e the woman an h man .
h woman se ntal and material processe the sa amount of ies .
Regarding enta prcesses , cgnition is e ty more used .
he material prcsses so some actions tht the girl would lik to eas becas them only make emotional abuse to the man .
S fels srr becaus sh did n car about h in hs delicate situation .
As we c se , the boy gave her ove a s just want to leve him .
Although the reason for the brak - up is t totaly cler , the gir is saying that it s all hr fault .
Th y did t do anythin ong .
If we look to e b process , we will id nly positve thng .
The processes tht appears me uslly are metal n relatinl ( tributive tye ) .
hese cases ar always regarding god actions or howng the go characteristics of the man
.
On the other hnd , the woman just say " I 'm soy " .
h mental processes , specifically the cognition one , tlls us that she had thoht a lt bou what sh did and that e is wron .
h other paticipants appears a few times , but these participants el us important things about he relationship .
Sh cares bout him , about hs life n his family ( even thoug he i n't cre befor ) .
Consequently , ese prticpants ge us om ke to understand better e situation , t actaly they just cfirm what te gir eels .
She is regreing because their elationship get orse nd it was n't what he sposed it could be .
She was him , but " the chn is on hs oor " .
She bre up , but ow sh is on his hand .
Ti ca only be explained because he is a good o nd she w ( probaby ) ofused .
Although now she is sure , she a sufered a lot . " The cold " n " h fear " was nside her .
he els b , u she oe n't really know what to a .
Even though , there 's a sentence tht n confse anyne .
Sh says " swallowing my pide " .
She a to do it , ad is a sacrifice .
Maybe h feels bad , ut no comleely ilty .
This sentce hows a girl who thinks sh is t really bad , though s kno she could have done hings better .

Itroduction
Sports are all arod he community .
They imove ou health and hl peopl neract ith each ote .
Those are a few reasons why it is important o us as a hethy group of people to hae facilities in wic we ca practce th kind of actvities .
The chosen o
In my opini√≥n runing is oe of the mt hepful ports en it comes to trt movng an getting it , in patcular fo hos people who hae o een ing ay ind of physical activit for a long time .
Ts activity wod not demad huge aounts of mony to be doe and th a nn - significant investment would help a large group of people h despratel ne it .
Minimal investment with huge benefits
To star running th commuiy wl eed a few thins .
To begi wi , it is mportant tha the government develops a prgram hich cretes social awareness .
A significan pa of th population in ts twn do not no the importance of practising spts and having a healther life .
Once peoe kw al h benefits tis port has , they will need a space wher to pratice it comfortably .
Wth this in mn oey wul be spent on constructng a running rue where no - e wld have to worry about traff or obstacules in their wy .
Beefi for all ages
There ae almt no contraindicatons to ractie is sport so lmst everybody in th tw has t opportunity to r it at least ne .
Ts ctivit o nl improves yor body n alth but ls els u hve positive thuhts aking everyon fe happier .
Cclusi√≥n
In my opinion improving the pactice of this sport will be a gat ivestmen for our communt and il av a ret impa on our health and in u everyay livs .
he ectue and e readin pssae both discuss how to stop h spread of cane toads in Australi .
owever , the lecturer argues against the reading passage .
e reading assage mntions three ws to revent cane toads from spreading , while the peaker fers tre reasos to refute the reading passage .
The fist point , sugestd by e lecturer , is that aional fece a not st cane toads fm sreaing .
The cae toads ' eggs and young can tods can sred to other ras fo the streams and rives .
Unless e national fence ca prevent the ggs nd young cn toas fo moving through he ater wa , he fence is useless .
Ths , the ecture dipues h idea mentiond in the atice that building a national fence cold avoid th spreadin .
The ecurer 's second rgument invovles aturing and destroyin te toads by volunteer .
It is argd in t listeng pssage that untrained volunteers cod har th native frogs wch r endngered .
Because h oug rogs look ali , it is possibe that the volunteers will ill ros other than ae oads .
In sho , h lecturer questons wt is tatd in the redin psage hat prevent the spredng by volunteers capturing the cane tod .
inall , it is arued in e lstening passe that dsease - cauing virus ha illd the oad uld be a disaster .
The lecure ss that if he virus w bring to the orgnal habitats of cne toads in South America , it wl cue cologial daage to the ocal ecosystem . To su up , the letrer doubt the a mentioned in the reading ta specially designed viru cul specifically harm cane toads and rvent them ro spading .
To conclude , h lecturer discords wi th deas in th passage by presenting hre convincg reasons .
Natonal fence , olnteers , nd virus are not god olutions to e cne toas spreading problem .
" Mission : Impossible " soars agin with sunnng five oing !
It it hd to blieve that olywood superstar To Cuse is till abe to reinvent himel cary the weght of a blockbuster franchise ke the " Mission : Impossible " seris , uch more so after considerng th fact tht he is ow in his erl fifties , nd til lok as fresh as he did in the 25 years old " Dy of Thunde " .
To tar , " Rogue Nation " folows h same bas formula of the movi preceding it : fast - paced action , a focus on the espionage d gadgetry of the ce tm , and some of he os breathtkin set peces Hollywood has to ofe .
Together wit a sld foe and te dt and stylish nd of director Chrstopher McQuarrie , all elements combine to gve this fifth ouing a refined sense of rgeny , perfectin t pce to delvr constant , ve - topping thlls .
Finall , a secial mention goes o Joe Kraemer 's surbly thrillin cor , jt a masterclass of old - school , kickass orchesra ation uic .
With all hins considered , t botom line is ht Crie & Co hae delivered wat has to be considered as the finest film in he eries yet .
Th socal debate beten prress an trditios hs bee oing on fr centuries .
Trogh ou customs , we celebrate our past d kep our cultural heritage aiv .
t it is aso becus of these set of beliefs , mostly of rligious oigin , tha some socties fail to evolve d respond to the ever - cnging eed of al of ther pople .
Oe of te ain adantage of cutra practices is that they llo societies to maintain her identies nd gain economic stability .
In st Latn Aerican ountries , milenar ractice suc as silversmithing , o onl keep e egion in tch with its herita , t hey have become the sole sourc of incme for many communities .
Natins like Mexio and ru , with internationally recognized cuisines , he ken advantage of tir ulinar oot and boosted th proction of locally gron foods , ik chipole pepers nd quioa , to rin ecoomc gowth to their gricultre sector .
On the ohr hd , the greatest disadvantage of traditins , is that religious belie hav ket these very ae populations fom social an human rights prgress .
Gay marriage and rproductive rights ae t recognized by te Costa Rican and most Latin goerments , all becuse of the set of beliefs of a percentage of heir commuity .
In conclusion , traditions should be herished and kept alie for fure generations .
Hweve , the safekeeping of the practices should ever become a priority or the wellbeng of the ollective .
Progrss d traditions are not oppotes in a socie ty were respect nd tlerace for oher is the rioity .

" Prison ha long ben te traditional punishment o peple who commit crmes .
Sme pole believe , oever , ta community service order are more appropriate in some caes .
When do yo think ha it is right to odr pele to wrk in e community to py or tir crimes ? "
In recnt yeas , te most comon punishment fr criminas has be risn .
her are crtan people who beieve cmmuniy svice orders are more dequae in me cses .
People wo bek the aw , should be ordered to work in communty in oder to p for their misdeds , when th ve done a minor offence or if th av acted unintentionally .
Community service orers r more appropriate han prion punishments when people have acted unintentionally .
Sending crimins to prison is a sriou verdict or people tht av mde a mistke .
Nody is sinls a eopl shuld n be treated as serios as being set to jal .
Fr example , grafiti mars in Bulgria re ent to prison r 4 years .
This is nair , because they do not do an hrm to e environment nor to the society .
It is better ht ey do a ertain amount of communit ok , or example clean their graffiti , ich will tech thm how had it is to clen graffiti , d thus , prevent he from making new ones .
Working in the community is re adequate compare to sending pele to prison wn criminals have on a mior offence .
Limiting peole 's freedom bcuse of inor , non - hrmful to th socity imes is inhumane .
Everyoy eseves reedom , desite ts crme .
Altough ther misdeed hold ot be tolerated , I belie that had better do some community wk .
This will elp them undestand teir mistakes and preven he in fute .
o eamle , in Bugara , people wo lay down and rax on th grass in he par re snt to jail for 6 year , becaue ey re cosidere " doing serous amag to the evironment n preventing the park frm furhr develment " .
Community service orders should be us whe peope hae acted unintentionlly an when they have conceded a minor offee , as this will lp them realize heir istaks , ithout them bei imied in freeom by being sent to prison .
This will help em realize their mistakes d thu , qi oig thm .
House at he End of the Stet
The lat movie I watched a Hos Next Doo , a captivating thriller ha tars Jennifer Lawrence , Elabeth Shue n Mr Thieriot .
The plo is about a eenge girl who moes in wit er othe to her dream house , which wa ne to a home here a horrile double homicide ha tken ace in .
As soo as they me in , they hear h rmors of the incden : a little ir brutally mdered er rents in h middle of the niht and disappared , and the ohr child of te famiy rcenly moved in ter .
As h oie develops , it as lots of interesting turns hat let the viewr form his / he own conclusions .
I myelf am a fan of horror movies , whih are highly predictable , so it ws a great satisfcion to se sch a complex fi .
e d completely bew me wy a I beeve it was the st pat of it .
The actig was smooth and credible .
Although it had bad critics , h movie ws well recive by the audienc ; not to mntin Jenier Lawrenc 's pparance right after the h of Hunger Gae was geat for dvertisng .
In conclusin , I highly recommend this film r those w like daa d lot twis .
Actually I intend to suy law bt sinc thee is no ' law ' in te sbjec choics so I hos economic .
I think ta a l degree is such a practical degree and ega knowledge is applicable almot everywhere .
I cose to study law becas I think that law is ver importnt in our scety .
ithout law , th old that we e living in wll not be in rde d peae , bt in hao .
I believe that every humn , oganiztion nd ompany ha their own rights d it is in my duty to use my legal nowlege to ep tem ro infrinement of hei rights .
My sud plan is to nterake a pre - university programm loally to prepae ysef r further tudies overseas .
I aspir to further my tudies in Law at he University of Cambridge .
I wol love to be in an intellectually stimulating enironmnt , being surrounde by the brghtest young mind rom al over the world .
In my opinion , th exchage of thoughts and iws etween all these brilliant pople is exactl ere a totally nw and creative idea wil sar .
Alost eve hom , office or scool has a compter of some ki these dy .
Many people fel ha hes macies are now an essential prt of our livs , but hw necessary ae thy really ?
One of t main advantages is the tme tt n be saved by usi a computer .
This is especialy benfiial in the orklace , where employees a do thr work far fstr han thy oul in te past .
In dition to this , ompuers can be educational nd fun .
From a very young ag chilren n gain asic computr sills throh prorammes tat alw hm to ear , draw , paint and ply .
In today 's technological orl , this knowledge c only lp them in e future .
Hoever , there are various negative aspcts to usin com - puters .
Many bs have ben lst u to th fact tht computes a do a o of tasks more efficienty than hmns .
This hs l to high unemployment in many untries .
Wh is more , computers can atually cause heal prolms .
Endless hors in frnt of a screen cn cause e srain and headaches , wich are serious side - effects .
To su up , it seems ta computers re a ueful additin to our fast - moig world of gh echnolgy .
Howvr , it must be emmbered at he e he to serve us - t to eplace us .
Social networking is a tl used by people l around he world .

It is not only changing h we communict , but how we interct wth each other in daily li .
All social networks ve heir n pros and ns but ertainly tre re some socia networks tt afect ore tha oter .
In onclusio I n say tat th social network th ffects ppulaion h most is Faceok .
It ay be on the verge of repacing raditional ersonl interactions o h ext eneration .
It affects r lives in mny ways , including our communication , self- expression , bullying , isolations , friendships , d vn o ver own sense of manity .
On his ntorking site , ses create page at represent em in soe a .

Proposal to improve Schol 's acilities fo languge earner .
Itroductin :
h aim of his proposal is to make recommendations in ord to prove e school facilities .
Aspects such as space , iernet access and materials ill be discussed in order to make suggestions to improve the sevice for stuents learning languaes .
First , an inspectio to the schoo 's failties was organisd , in odr to assess the school premis .
From the visit , it was concluded that een if the majority of tudent express stisfaction with the space , oe of tem wish to hve more classrooms hat alow a more rasonble numer of students per class .
Curetly , eah clss is ien to 50 stuets which limits tei oportunities to experience one o o activities that enhance the learning process .
It woud be advisable to accommodte class in th min buildin that ofrs enough space for smaller classes .
ecodly , It ws surprising to evdece an absence of Intrne acess in the ompter ro .
ve if he om counts wit a onsiderabl number of computers , e absence of Internet dos o give studns t opportunity to se the man websites useful to imrove thei language skills .
Therefore , I strongly recommend guaranteeing internet acces whch does t epresent a igh co for the academic oard .
The acess il gve learners t possiilit to use technolgical tools hat will ensur a better exerience whe learning languages .
Finly , authetic material in foreign languges as t oun in the shool 's liray .
It is crucial to provide sudets wh printed materil in the target nguage .
Magazines d newspaprs all learners to ave direct contact ith language in real coexts .
Tu , I suget to mae subscritions to international magazines in order to enric th schoo 's lbrary .
Cnclusio .
I strongly believe that if th suggesions mae in this popsal are given attention , the sevice ovided to laguage lernrs wll be strengthen and enhace .
I fe a ep sense of self - hatred d guilt !
How could I cut the rope ?
How woud the entire world in geeral and he moutaineerng fraternity in prtcular , judge my ecsion ?
I must be repared to abase myef in ont of the whole word from now !

Ever since I sartd learning Eglis I have found quite handy watching TV series , specilly thoe which a peectly subtiled , in ordr to ollow h lot properly .
In act , it is qui useful if you a atuall interested in improvin yur skils , wh it comes to listening and speakig .
On the othe ad , I ae ee in search of the series wich catches my attention and it too me vry long until I fially put my fing on it .
e TV series knn as Downton bbey is the est I ha ver se , d in h folowin lne I woud lke to explain wh .
It is set in ngand dung and after the First Wrd Wr .
The whole pl takes ace in t rea called Downton , te castle of Ea Lrd Gathm , his fmil an the servi staff .
Although the sor is focue on the Lod 's famly , te service has an important part to ply , as the world is canging coninuously ad the nobility is gtting ol - fashione .
Th ai point in thi seres is that eery charactr has been absolutely developed , wi its own characteristics and personalities .
Even e bacgroud is clevly coen what eances he intriguing a dramatic crpt .
Needless to say , the actors are sublime and they give their touch to their role , especially Maggie mih , whih is one of my favourite actress .
Because of all these rasons , I highly recommend takig int account Downton Abbey to be nluded in yo top e lis .
I wis to app for the Assistants & managment suppt for the " Asset Allocation & Macro Research " ( AA&MR ) poition as I elieve it is in perfect alignmen with my kill d professnal experience .
My penultimate position wa as chif execuie of a coany wi hotcomposition , which was followed by the creation of a pulication serice serving the " Sll Sd " department of Pictet , then Helvea demonstrated my sen of oranization a easy daptaion to e environment .
My goal has alys been to comie eed wit quality , using od organizaio kils and an excelent maery of different tecnolgical tools .
I possess very good knowledge of pge layou software .
Furthermore , I am fluent in nglsh lanuge , ith oo writing sills .
Coscienious by atur , I always strve to be thorough in my work , to be diligent , and consitntly completing my asks .
In dditin , I am a em player it good interersonal skills .
I would be gad to further expand upon wh I can ofer in an inrview .

Thre is no doubt hat travelling by car is e most comfortable option , but claiming tht public transport ha no uure is too mch .
May people use public transport on a diy sis .
There are pople w wold n't be ale to ravel if it was n't fo publc transport .
Children and eldes ca n't av a driing license , so if they need to go somewhere , using ubic trnspot is their only option .
Travelling by car is als very detrimental for e evironment .
In bg ciies , th ai is ery polled because tre a to my cars . ravlling by public transport lower the impact on t environment , something th mst pepl ae aare of , t stl they prfr to use heir o vehicle .
Using puli transort can al sv me , since o do n't have to spend tie lookig for a plce to park your a .
I definitely thnk ht public transport wil coninue to be very impotant in he future .
In general , opping is sociated with smehing pleasant , b ufrtunately this is not alwas true .
hre are some reasons why peole eave ho in a a od , or een do n't wn to ge in them .
Shopping is not always njoable .
Fo some people , shopping is one of tir obigatios .
For others it is overall a plesant experience he ca o enjoy as much as they would ie .
rstly , shpping may be uncmfortble , because more oten han not we can hear thr tiring music , saewomen an be to intrusiv and the queue usually e very long .
Sometimes women go to the ore , just to watch te new stff , to lok arund n questins skd by sellers me us anry .
In addition , shopping is also a prlem for me .
It is said that the man , ho go shopping more tan n hu is angry a tie .
Sometimes it is also a troule o omen , who want to go shopig wih r patner .
To sum up , doing shopping is inevitable , so we can mae veryay shopping mo enyable .
For xapme , we can take at least one family mebe wit us .
Tis is a great oppotuity to ped se quality time togther , excange ideas and opinions ; opt for eening shopping , spcifically aut alf an our bfor the stores cose if u wan to avoid g crowds ; if possibl , choose ony one stre o ou everyday sopping .
Goin frm e store to aother c aste yur time , cost o a lot in ga , as ll as mentally ad physially exhaust yu ; whe it comes to roducts that yu regulry use , buying in bulk is te best option y hav , sic ta y ou t a bgger quatit for a lower pie ; or just choose online shppig - is a great way to me yr purchases from the comfort of yor own home , wihou hain to go t on a rainy day , deal wh noisy ( and sometimes even smelly ) cowds , pnd mony on s and wit in uge lines .

Everybody h goas hat they wan to achieve .
Having goals in lfe will make ones ' life meaningful an puroeful .
As for my reams for the upcmig years , I hik I ave to dreas in lie that I will do my best and ty hard to relie .
They e studying in an Enlis niversiy aboad ad becoming a programmer .
First , I ant to aend an English university abroad .
Being able to study in an English university will gi me h opportunity to get a etter job ad an exciting experince .
As we all know , nowadays , English proficiency is on e list of the required klls to be employed and the market hihl demands it .
Secondly , he experence one gets fro a multicultural medium is very valuable nd mke one more matured .
d I fel that only an overseas English universi can ofer tht .
eond , I want to be employed as a programmer .
there are many reasns why I at to be a programmer .
primarily , because being a developer is my dea job an secondly because deelopers ke a lot of oney .
I wanted to be a programmer since I was 14 years l .
I was fascinated by ths fld of science .
In addition , aring a fair mount of mne is essential to building my if .
For example , if I at to mrry in te utre , I have to be ale to send my ids to a dece schol ad provi them wth what th want . t to entin wedding part expenses .
To su it up , graduatng fr an Englis university an thn becoming a programmer are currently my mine aims .
Having a od ob d a high salary will make my life richr and more waring .
th th adent of inivdually wne vehcle lie the car , an idividual 's dpendece on publc transort has certainly reduced .
Hower , with ta bein sid , in my opinio , there is sill a lo of future fr publc transport .
I 'd lik to ihlight e factors tht old support my opion in a erain order that pertains to a wier acceptane .
First of all , from a st perspective , ublic tranport is uc cheape compared to a a , especily when a cost reduction conpt like ' car pooling ' is no fllowed .
The financial benefit that public transport givs to th cmon man is secod to none , espeally in cmon stuations like og disnce commutes for daily work .
In addition , from a ' time savis ' angle , increased usage of public transport results in recing rafic n elping pele rea tir detinatins qicer by avoing being delay in raffic jams n light .
From an environmental sandpoin , use of public transport ensures that carbo emissions rm automoiles are preventd hlping in prserving th balance of naure even in bg cites like Toky an Delhi where the caon emissis are very igh .
Modern TV is worth every pound
Cookery prrammes , flms , ocumentaries , talkshows ‚Ä¶ It 's cle ta hee are lts of dfferet programmes on TV nowadays .
Myb yo think of eleviion as a wst of money .
In tha ae , I can guaantee you ht tody 's tll is deinitly worth the mony .
It 's true that there ar ts of epats on TV nd the may be any pogrammes o regard as poo quali .
However , hre 's always a channel tha sends out a new episode .
Besides that , it 's very likely that you can find soe progrmms o like bewen all e trash ecaue of the wide ariet .
In aditon , the price of watching television for a whole oth is mh lower than h prie of tikets f th cinema to watch a ilm for only two hours .
Mreove , when yu sit in front of the TV in yo n hue , you wo n't get irritated by strange , hih m happen in e cnma .
In my opinion , TV provides sometin r veryone 's taste nowadays , incding god uality prgammes , for a reasonable price .
It shold be possible for eveyone to ejy wacing teevsion !

TV Today : chance or hazard ?
Today 's tlevison is e paradigm of our society , because of dozens of ne channels constantly popping up and nly a vey few control are doe on the quaity of wha it 's actually broadcat .
So TV , which could be an invaluable souce of information a entertainment , actually is becoming a i isue to the development of r socey and new geerations in particua .
The ptential risks for ou nw geneations
Having an es access to such a rih offer efore haing developed the abilt to operat corct choices or filter h information received , o kid ad juniors are constantly under atack of agerous bhavior models , being attracted by the nes h seem te mt wnning and cool ones , without any chance to distinguish if the c be taken as a guide to their growth or o .
The absnce of e rents or h fat he usually have no control no ay to drive ther choices makes me vey worried aout th future of or society .
ack to the full poential
It 's not too le , togh , to ry to hav or beloved TV bk to the importance which radio d for our prens and andparents , we nly need to see it as a potntial e socil problem a art a rocess of cntro ad continuous improvement , maybe gving e most virtuous networks th hace to be ighlighted .
I believe hat if public transport has no futre , then our environment will not hve it eite .
Te a is sometime rresented as an ico of freedom ; moreover , wning a modr r is sometims reled to wealh .
Compared to he e of public tranort , o can no dey te cnvenience of uing a r fr mong rond .
However , h use of public tasport , especially in hih density cities , llws people to save time hie commuting to thei study or wokplae , as trins ad ram do o gt uck in traffic jams .
It not only hlps reducing polltion , but also allos ers to se oney , in a orl wee the st of gasolin is expoentiall increasing .
I eleve ht people should limit the u of their cars ol to special occsios , sch as oa trips or long - weekend eisur activits .
Only by oig so , we will hel to preerve our atmosphere free of C emissions , ad all the ri consequences they have .
Dear am director ,
Helo , my na is Zabri .
I read abu ur ummer camp in the internet and I woul oe to work with you .
I m 16 years old , tall , extroverted , ver energetic nd cherfu and fridly .
I lv is , a i m ver otgong .
I thn I can be very helpful to yr amp , helin o takig cr of e ds a also helping o in he kitch beause I really loe to cook .
Besides , I really ned the one for my faily .
But I am doing this because I really noy creing activities with kds a havin a great time with hm .
Wh I a younger i went to a amp , and it was n of the best memries I av so it would be really ret to nw I woul mae me ids make he same way .
I real hoe you accept me in your cmp , and I wa with excitment your esponse .
Tan you .
Toa , I 'd lke to share with you a small bt histric story , also together wit my w view on it .
I hope you wud like it .
In te historical rir , thee s a dynasty called n , drin whc is story took place .
A ltte oy called Lucky ag , howevr , w t so luy as his name uggsted .
In hi ealy age , he los i mothr to illness .
As a rsul , in ode to be ue at he col et the same love from mher lke other childre , is father married anoher woman .
On the contrary , h fact was inconsistent with wat he expected .
Lucky Wn 's stpmothr wa sch a ake - hearted oman that e did as man crel things as she could to tortre this poor by .
One day in an especially chilly winter , cky Wang 's stmother g si suddny .
Nt concerning the hrs environment bt h own appeite , se commanded Lcy Wan ma a delicious meal wi fresh fsh .
In desperatio , he tepped to e iver bank .
Seeing th frozen war srfac , he could do nothing but r .
As time lw , the un san little by little , whch made Lucky Wa el mr and more helpless .
So depressed was Lucy Wg that he mply lay on e ce with eeping .
It was exactly hen he a hesitatng whether we ome to face the beatings fm s sepmothe or not that o craps leped up ot of h ic a flopped to e bk in fro of him .
Surprised and deligtd , t o took e fish me and prepare delicis fish so fo his stepmother .
Moved by this itle boy 's ilia devotion , s stepmothr changed e attitue nd state to love him fom e dep eart .
Ever since then , what fille this famly is just appness and love .
After listening to the mal stor , so people ere deeply med by th hapy ending , however , thers thght it was unralistic .
No mater wt te ct was , or vn it eer hapened , the ory js wanted to ephasize t importance of Filia Piety .
Even if it a a ictio , the goal to ake all t eole in the society be filial coul also be achieved , which wod keep th society armonios as el as oderly fr a long tme .
Also , it was the goenors ' terminal purpose .
Only through hs cultural education combined with her ay , col hey kep ther government eneration by generation as thy expected .
How to ensue an adequately fnanced retirement ?
I am an assetive an proactive gir who is plugging aay towards a reat number of goas .
However , sometimes , whn I am thinking out my future , it is had to imagine what is waiting for me .
I want to live to a rip old ag , u at the am ie I am afraid of it .
Or societ is becoming an increasingy elderly n .
It is in fahin to have a small faily , but have yo vr thought about roblem it may cause ?
he greaest one is e burden of financng care .
At thi a nd age it is flling on te taxpayers .
It oes not boos their confidence in future perspctives .
We often hear tan no obstal is er insurmountable , however , is it true ?
Sooner or latr we will face the muc .
Only in that moment we ll understand tht we ae e of he millions pensioners h need a l of different sevices to liv as flilled and independent if as we deerve .

Hover , step by step we wl work our wa up .
Firstl , I have to say that I dsagre about th tatemet " here is no future r public transort " . I think pubic transport hs lots of advatages , moe an travelling by r .
You do n't ave to earch r parking and you do n't ve to a r parking .
You only he to be aware of hen leae ou public tansport and be here a couple of minutes beore .
o can reax whe ou are travellin , listening music or reading a bok .
Fnally , travelling by ublic trasort is gneraly heper thn avelling by c .
Maybe you sed me urs than travelling by car t I think it wrt it , bcase yo can sve money .
I usually travel by pblc trnsport and it is the half of he cot thn if I do it by ar .
So , I thk t staement woud be like thi " Thee is no future r travelling by car , beaue public transport is so mch more convenient n chear " .
I 'm ot a huge an of sports in eeral , ut I do take pleasure in gaging in smllr scl basketal maches , most of wich would probably al ito the so - caled ' street ' ctegor , or steetbll to be more specifi .
It takes a higher lvel of creatviy n spontaneity to succeed in it tan your usual basketball match , since is flexil rules , no - coah system , intensified relationship between he player ad e crod , and reduc number of participants wie an complexify ts field of possible actions .

On t one hand , pblic tansport is mr convenient or arge cities as it provides ervice to a lrger number of peole ad we avoid traffic jams and e ned to in arkig spots , besides e fat that we wo n't gt worried about leaving our cars prkd on the street and , when we ome back , the a cld have ben robbed or stoe .

I fund out bot this new shop rm frids a piturs onne so I decided to cm heck it ou for myself .
As I ha arrivd just as they op at 1 pm , I had h hle place to myself .
T mority of h space was tken up by a U shp marble counter where customers c st and obsrve eir desserts being made .
Several lounge sofas ere avilable on the sd f bi grous to sit tgeter , u the vie as hat cugt my eye as e floor - to - ceing windo lt in a at amount of naturl liht .
The atio is proaly a bit narow to lace tbles outsie but eope c go ot d enjoy the view when te eaher is cole .
The decor was very simple and ic with abstract paintings hanging on he wall hich ould alude to he tyl of dssers bein served here .
I statd hatting with the chef who ld me that he wanted to srt a dessert ouge or peope to eax and njo essert .
He felt ha a lot of places out ere ted to mk h experiene to rush whre you have to line up for an hr a finish eatin in ie 20 minutes befoe the kick y out .
There are curntly 9 desserts offered on h men with prices rngin rom $ 108 to $ 138 whle thee is lo t famous Improvisation dessert for 2 at $ 328 . I old n't decide wh to g at first becaus hy al sundd so interesting so I askd the chef for eommendations .
He recommned te Bamb Charcoal as the thm is chocote wih a perfect for me !
Each dessert coes with some appetizers to leanse our alate .

The alt roght u te sweetness of th watermelon hle working as a balancing ent so he jui wod ot be too sweet .
I was told ha t drik / soup chages fequntly depending on what wud be suitable at h moment .
ambo Charcoal ( $ 8 ) - I got to ath e chef as he prepared my dessert at t ounter and I s getting or and more exited to taste i artful presentation as it cae to life !
It lierally oked like a iec of absract art paitin .
This wa a chocolate theme dessert wih baboo charcoal c crm , chocoate e marshmall , choolate aviar and raspberry sorbet .
I did n't know ht caroal c cream uld tate like but it was actually chocolte mixed with a it of charcal .
Th chocoate flavo as rich bt t too weet while the raspberry orbe s delightfully tat and tang .
My surprise avorite s the mcrowave spone ck that the chef dded at h ast minute .
He told me that this is a new metho of making songe cke in h microwav that results in ve fluffy texture whch would be hard to achieve in a rditional ove due to temperature constran and timing .
It was very light and flffy hle stil full of flvor !
The dessert also came it a choce of coffee or tea so I opted r h Lim Flower & Lavende Te at tir ecommndation as el .
My tea was brought out with teat and a mall hourlass timer hre I am suppse to wait 3 minutes befe I shol por the tea .

They also ffered me some hone to d it my t en I thugh it was n't flavorful enogh at first .
Vrict - I s ery impressed with e desses at ATUM Dessant as he were delightful f both te eyes and the mouth !
It wuld be perfct if they served alcol as well and hey od me tha they are in talks with h building management to do so .
The price was n't ceap o dessert but if u tk into th entire eperiece nd comard to wat y pay f driks at a bar or lounge , it 's pretty comparabl actually .
They als told me that they lan on introducing a nw tea e meu uing e day so stay une !
I ca n't wait to go back n try l of their dessr flavors !
As th days go by , more discoeies are beng unearthed in a apd pc .

You can imagine that it is eally taumatic fo divers when they enounter a corpse in the water , ot to mention the great disrss uch a diaster ives to te family that w left behind .
The bottom line is : get as uch ut of your iing experiences as you ca , but sy sfely within our wn boundarie set by your pesona eductio and ractice .

I also love to see the spark flashng in students ' eyes when they undrstan a concept , try to epress theelves th Chinese a finally use it correctly .
o me , lerning a language is not only translating the forms to express oeself , but a wa to unerstad o the naive speakers describe ad interpret this world .
A successful mmunication between iffernt culturs will happen oy we we expres oueselves precisely and interpret the information accuratey .
Chinese , as a lnguae course , is concrned wth encong and decoding .
Studnts should master language skills , with which the students can achieve their academi gos .
Meanwhile , sudents should have deeper understanding of Chnse culre and viewpoints .
Acquiring a lanuage d cutur is a lo - er rocess , ich includ learning , prcicing , making misaes n orrecting .
As a lagage techer , I hope my students wi av a deeper ad broaer understanding of this languag , their nteest in this language ll be stimulated by h couse n learn t language constantly .

Although an undertandin of water quality ws nt well undertood , the imprtance of water was appaent to our ancestors .

The main recauton measure was purely by jdgng turbidity of e water d his false practice had remained ever since , ve noadays .

There has bee substantial attention to wries ' self - presentaon n ietity in onli scia media recenl ; Boye ( 08 ) studied how teens present themselves online through Myspac site ; Le ( 014 : 92 ) reports that pople illustrate a diffeent identity in febook thogh using " a ifferent angage and ritng sle " .
He asers that language choice an detity re not " predetemined " n ae prone to chage ( Lee 2014 : 91 ) ; teir hange is rived from th coext where scourse is negotiated and ho " interlocutors iterpret the identities being projected " ( ib : 91 ) .
Therefore , ntext , including e participants , their social prpos , ther means d channel of communication , plays a role in language choic n ientity constrution .
Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) refers to the " forms of participation " in a socal mei d havn the sense of audience in mind as the key elents that an possly hane " the way pepl tnk of theselves " that chags the w he prsent theseves and their identity onine thereby .
He refers to using ncknams , for exple , as a way of self - epressio that can sap h audience 's ind and interpretation of writrs ' identiy .
e ( 2014 ) defines thr ways of elf - presentations in mst social media : ( 1 ) " onlin prfie " ( p. 97 ) , that is the " entry point to social networking " .
In Boyed 's terms , profile is an iporant spc here writs tel the audience " h they a n how they want to be sen " ; a lin hat connecs eople 's " offlne d onne identities"(2008 : 129 ) .
Examining tens ' idetity construction in scal media , he states ha proile is wher tees " express salint aspect of their idntit for others to s and ierpret " ( 2008 : 19 ) ; ( 2 ) " continuous status upatin " tha is updating aut lie and sharng experiences frm th " first person " pint of view and ( 3 ) " sual representation " that is " visua mages " ( p. 98)(emhasized as in original ) .
Continuou updating , as a ay of sef - presentation , is one of te featurs of blog writing by wich blog - witers n share their emotional experiences and views with the audience .
If the weblog - witers prefer presenting th wld rom hir on angle , through ung t firt person pooun , or tl their tries tough te eaders ' yes , by invovin oth grammatical ubjects , is among th focuses of hi study .
It eems tha checkin h Subject , as an interpersonal element in t clause , can povide evidece of my stuet - writers ' self - presentation n invovement in he diourse consructed in teir blogs .
This is also revant to the notion of stance a positio or the existence of author in e text .

Dear Pa ,
Thanks fr yor e - il .
I 'm glad to ear at you are havng a great me broad volunteering for is internaonal cultural organization .
I thnk that it is a wonderl idea to collc different experiences bfore staring university studies .
As yu no I spent last month in Eastern Euoe working fo a similar cultral organization and I have a has - on experence in oraniing a culural festival and particularly muial concert .
I loved my jo there nd if I only had an opportunity to do it again , I efinitey wol .
During my staying ere I was responsible or takng ar of musician and ontating eda .
Wat I especially loved abut my ob her , wa te opportunity to ork in such a diverse group of eople .
I lared w to respond to diferet people 's needs resutig fo cultural differences nd expecttions .
I aso appreciated uch the practical experience I cld get there - how to organise job at th office so tat verything ge smoothly a everyone gs what they want , how to use social mia fr advrtisng a pomotion , o to communicate with press and television ec .
I look forwd to hearing fom you soon an I oe th you 'll find ths experience as amazing as I did .

I agre wi the statement .
It is known tht gossip mgzines r bought by lts of peoe h e interested in ht these people do , th kind of clohes they er or even th tatos they have .
In fact , although the r faous , they e people too , wch mens hat they should be free to do whaeve they ie in their free time .
hs hppens beause som people is famous just bcase they hve hd an afai with a singer or a footaller , so the ony thing peopl nt to nw aout hem is if hat is tre or not , an wen it happend .
It oud come to an end if society changed e concept of " famous popl " .
In the cas of poitician , I do n't mind what te do in their holidays , f example , if they ok propely when they have to .
t I hink there is an exception : monarchy .
I think Roy Family is an exceptio becase they ae upportd by all the citizens , so I thnk we ( as ciizn ) have he right to ow eveything thy do if we wnt .
I mea , it would be better that tre ws more transparec as r as how thy pend " our moey " is concened .
I tink journalists should follow fmos pople only wh he do something related to their profession or the ac that h made them famou .

This is fllwed by an animated discussion in Engish , accompanied by drinks from te coffee bar , whch is open lte , of course !

We 've had , for example , Hug Williams and erge Kig .
Next week we 'll be watching " Dacr in h rk " , by as von Trier , a distintiv Danish filmmaker .
Wil I e o tee ?
We 're expeting you !
We Ele w h hous for the frst tim , h cod n't believe her eyes !
It was a bright sunny ay and the birds ere peacefully singing .
Meanwhle , le a going to receive a birhda present om h bofriend , Ke : a house f both to le .
At first , Ken , ha thought about givig sme cruise tickets as a prsnt .
Bt after a while he thought out sometig bigger , huge and or expensive .
A hoe r tm to live !
Ken w t a small uy , shrt hair , sharp eth ad nse , ght skin , bond hair and s - blue eyes .
That day was t day , Elena 's bihday , and Ken a n't ur ow to gve that masive present wh suddenly he ha an xcellen iea .
He h lready thought about that so he grabbed a blndfold an pt it over Elena 's eyes .
Wen Elena ok it off h a lon away , completely amze wi what she saw .
In ront of her a a stunning hose .
It was enormus , wh uge windows , ite wlls and wi superb views of th se and h shoe .
Elena could n't be happier with he situation .
he alo ppeared to be elievd tha she would n't have to li wth er parents anyoe .
After that memorae momen , she could now have a thrillng life next to h person sh loved .
They ived appily ever after .
That morning , Mchael woke up full of eergy , ad feelig ry optimistic aou his first y in i new jo .
He carefully chose the clothes he wa going to wr .
He choe a bue tie and a ight grey su .
It took him wnty inutes to do is har .
Every inle detail should be perfc to get the best fist impression .
-You only have one opprtunity to cause a good fir impression- he said to imself .
hn he s totaly satisfied with hi look he turnd on n f the ight of i bdrom ight imes .
Michae awas thought ha this itle ritual gave him an extra piece of lck .
He nt out of hs little aprtent and waled full of confidence to t bus stop .
He thoght happily tha he was n only on is a to hs new ob but he was on his wa to i e ie .
When he arrived the receptionist told him to go to hi oss office .
He knocked on th door .
A woman 's oice answered .
-Yes , come in , please- .
He liked her at first .
She was a very in ad intelligent wom , d Michel was sure that h was going to be a perfect bss and he ill work ery easily tgether .
After the meeting and when he was leavn he turnd bc and said : -
Ad congratulations for th baby!- His bos looked at him in anger:- Do y think that I am regnat?- .
-No , no , I men ... , I do n't think u are pregnant at all- .
Michael close te door ad knew at hat moment he h ade a misak .
Our city offers to visitrs a ug rane of posibilties to go shoping .
If u are crzy abou faion bt yo budget is really ort , thee are a t of second - hand shops whee you can buy a t wth a little money .
Wndw shoping through our hi street is anoher option .
ee you il id all trendy brands d much more .
For exampl , pople interested in cooking has sm gourt sop where they will be able to tase r traditional rducts .
A must r al touists atough they do n't wn to buy anythng is the dest shopping centre in the country .
Ts agnificen uiding is siuated in he city centre n it as built seventy yeas ago in an ancie plce .
ther modern malls are located in he suburbs but do n't worry , or city as an excellent pulic tranport sevie to g ther .
When the wather is good , especall during spring , arke sreet ar realy popuar .
You ca uy all you can imagine there but one of them is eally extraordinary .
It is celebrated on the mther 's ay on a , the frst Sunday nd it is locaed in t it 's longet avenue , around a kilometre plenty of flers where you a ak yu wn bouque for your mother 's present .
These re som ideas to enjoy soping while ou a visiing our it b thee are much more to dscover !
Ye , th 's tre tha th ar is a more convenient tan the pbic traport .
When yu 're driving you own c yo a eting a lot of comfort .
u e stting on a comfortable seat .
ou are listening to your favourite usic .
Th temperature level is exact what you like .
An you never , ever , will contact wih othr people .
Wl , there can be some pretty gils among h passengers o sre , but it 's far too often that you ill ae to sit near some stinky bum .
Mor than that , te r is always there when yo need it .
ou hav not wait tll it arrives nd it is never late .
Your car wll awas go to t right plce -- no transport change , no awkward routes .
t -- will it lwas be he best coie ?
No , t at ll !
Wh ou wan to travel the worl or ut going to vsit your paents , which are two thoand miles from you , it wud be beter to tae a bus or a train .
You wo n't be ab to cover ch a distance in one ay .
So in that cs it 's better to leav your a at ho .
And what if te ca you 're drivng will break ?
Just iagine ta you ar sitting in he brokn cr , at nigt , witht any sign of a cr service for fifty miles around yu !
High cst of fuel will defiitey be t leser evil in th situation .
So I 'd he to say his .
On short disancs , aybe o or two hundred mes , a ca is del .
But if y take a big jouney alone , you 'd bttr take an old god u , jt le 100 yeas a .
Peole woud sa that ravelling on ubic transport it is the fuure or or live .
Bu sincerely ter is no future at all fr it , as r ies nowadays a becoming more a more dmaning in ter of mulitaskin , goal seekers and amiy conciliation .
Public transort offers a range of timtabes for trais , buses or metro , b hen it comes to el with the dy - to - day ass we ey ofte fn travellng by our on r it is the esiest way .
For instance , travellng wit children it is ery annoying on public transport ue to all the security ssues iolved .
hre is no sy way to cary our ekly shopping , tuf for th ym or instruments on public tnsport .
We t to steal minutes fr every ho to fid te to do l te thins we wan to do .
Waiti at the s station for o next us afer just roughly missing t las on , being tuck in the mide of a crod trying to each the same train as everyone ee , does n't mke us le any easier at al .
At he en of te day we decide to use our ar , as the way we live today combining work , faly a hobbies all at once , cars becoming moble houses seem to be o best optio .
Dr Pl ,
I hope you 're doing wel and evrything is ok .
I 'm writing to yu because I want to tell you abou my experince .
u wanted to know what I ws said to do befor and duri the concert , so I y to explain erything .
Th concert oo place in Los Angle , it was a month g as I hnk . You an be sure that I hd a tim of my life .
Evrythng was so exciting abut helping at ti cncert .
Starting from sning he invitations to the ost famous people in te cit and calling the shots .
I had to take ae of ohr volunteers .
I had to chck tir wor a corect teir mistakes .
Speking of which , it as n't es .
Dealing with other peol is th hardt part , ecpecialy when hy 're he same ag as you .
I hnk I d my best .
noher good thn is that I had a chance to talk to juralists .
They ame fom different parts of the worl .
Tere were eople fo Russia , erany , Brasil .
That was eally great to meet them and to tk with them .
By the wa , do you know Jes Morow ?
S 's a journalist from th e ork Times .
She 's very famous ad I old her everything h wanted to know about the shw .
Before t oncert tartd , me ad my co - workers had to clean the stage , set up he equipment ad make sure verythng works well : the sond , h igtning and the instruments .
Helping at this concert wa a hard work bu very inspiring .
I 'm gad that I hd a chance to do it .
est wishes ,

My father ha had a bat or as long as I a rember , so I 've bee saiing sine I s a litle gi .
I articularl enjy t sense of freedo that it gives me : there 's nothing better ha being out on t water with only he sound of h waves , d of the wi on the sais .
In my experinc I found that peole ither consider salig a very bring sprt , or a ver angerou one ;
I guss becuse I 've be practicing for suc ln tm , I do n't agre in ethe case .
Inded people c get bored while sailing , if they just sit a do n't interact with he et of the crw ,
d it can be dangerus to , if one does n't know how to move on a boat .
Siling is all abu cooperation , d to ally enjoy it e neds to do it egulrly , to be able e to know te crew n find t ms uitable role on the deck .
Being a gd sailor oe n't mean knowing all about it , the poit of sls , the winds , and so on , o me a good sailor is someone tat knos the boat s / he 's sailing on , and is able to dal with all the posile situatns and lo kind of peope s / he can posily hav to eal with .
If ou tae t tim to ask aound , yu 'll nd out that a ot of e mt xperiencd sailors never to lasss .
So th most impornt piece of aice I would give to everyone is : try ,
d if he first tie is not so god , r again : in different weather conditions , wt different people , and different kind of ats .
Maybe you ll not get addicted to it as much as I am , but I 'm sure you will hae a gat time , and in the wors case you wl have t hanc to meet wonderful peole .
I would ot say that there is no fture or puic ransport .
First of all publc trnspor is f more onenient r pope in big cities .
Our mntly fuel expeses can be reduced by sing publi trasport to ge to the worpace .
Nwaday environmental plution is als imorant tat 's why public transport should be promted as environmentally frienly way of trnsport .
No always car is uc more convenient , for example in a bg city it is far mr convenient to us undergroud thn a car during the rush hour .
When we use puic transprt we a ra a newspaper or book d when we driving a car it 's imposible .
In my pinin nowaday rving a c is very stressful becae of trffic ntenity .
Drving a ar is lo more tiin , driver us be concentrated all the tim .
Of course not lway public transprt is ore convenient .
hen we an to go on a weekd trip to he countryside car is irreplecable fo families wh children or animls .
ls go on holidays by car an be vr comfortale .
th a we re more ndeendent ta wit public transport .
There a my ps and ons bt fr ur we ca n't a that thee is no future for public trasport .
Ths summer I am brinin a grp of 12 to 14 year - old students to Athns n I am lookg for suitable accomodation .
At peset I am nertain about h number of he students , u it will probably be but 15 .
Wie we are the , we no on want to loo at the many attctions in the cit , but we wud lie to visit om of he beautiful places naby , so we are lookng o a reasonable priced otel , in th cit cetre , with good transport links .
It is possible at we will sy in Athens abou n days .
Duig our ty we require the following : twin - bedded ros , in the same hotel , breakfas d on occasion , evening meal .
Furthermore I would le to ask you if there are n individuals who a be able to look after goups le us ?
Are you able to arrange acvities and ocl transpotaion for us ?
Aso it would be great if you could inorm me of some peial discounts , uch as cheaper air ravelling .
I lo forward to hearing from yo as soon as possile .
Introduction

Problems with the current website
A survey was conducted among the 0 people w filled the omplants .
The majority of peole were of opinion tat the te s clunky n har to use an nearly o third of the participan consdere that te design needs to be modernised .
Others problems cited included pretty low uptm of the webte , connection isue d logi roblems , partculary corrct credentials not working .
Wy to address the isses
I tink the website eeds to be revamped to attact more users .
h ook d fel soul follow the " merial design " standards as they re deined by Google a should use ore modern font .
As or te rver and database administrators , they should immediately resolve te issues regarding the backnd prt of th wbsit .
Reommendation
I would like to ae h following recommendations :
Impleme a tutoial to facilitate the usability o ne ues , and lso make it possbl to retake he tutoria as per ser request .
Conduct a survey on a minim of one thousand people on what eatures should te website include .
Dvelop a better fedback system so users can express the concern n questions in a moe detaild a .
I asue y that if these recommendations are implemented , the websie il impre sgnificantly .
Alison rea h no , sile , and immediately put on her coat .
Although it hd ben a tiring day she was very pride of that littl sheet of paper .
h hd just go the job nd h wanted to show what h kills wee .
No one could ha imagined tht she wa such a brilliant prso d whe se gave the article to h bos he latter a quite astonished .
h next dys the bos ordered e to wre an article about the natural bautis of Colombia , a litle Sate lcated in Sut America .
So she left on Monay and he land in Bot√† Tuesday .

he used to ie in a flat so se had never disovere how muh h world was different and beautiful .
Tht eveing she t with a loc gui s was invie to tte he ocl food and to dance with e traditional clothes of hat friendly civilization .
e following a sh ca ba to London where al her family was waiting for he since they werevery curis about th weird Alison 's trip .
Spor is probal as old as humaity itself .
ll ov the world people of different ags a vey fon of spr an gme .
Sport not only helps popl to become srong n to develop physicaly but also make tem more oranize and better discipline in thir daily activities .
Sport helps peope to keep in good helth .
Needless to y that sot plays a very importt role in u life .
It ies us much pleasure and my ments of joy .
It 's popular aog young n o eole .
Many people do mning execies , g in the morning , train themselves in finss clubs ad gyms , ad take part in sport competitions .
Ote people like sports too , but they only ach spors ompetitions , listen to port ws .
They prefer reading interesting aticls abt athletes ad sport vent , but they do n't go in for ports .
There are a lot of kins of sports sh as swimming , wrestling , cyling , box , football , ocey , trk and fied athletics and so on .
There e smer and winter ins of pors .
The summer kinds of sprts r , or example , swimming , athltics , fooball , vollyball , basketball and othr .
he wine kis of sports re , for exale , figure skting , skiing , ice hoky c .
Among the popular spos in our country ae football , basketal , swimig , volleyball , enns , gymnastic , figr skatg d oers .
You can hooe a sport for any season and for any tas .
I 'd like to describe so of the .
In srig and summer man peope prefer to go in for jogging .
This is very popular sor n very seful for our halh .
You ow run and enjoy the beaut of ntue around .
Ths kind of sport is getting more and more pular over the old .
If you go to Europe you can see a l of peple who go in for jogging .
Speaking aout sport I ca n't help saying about fotball , bcaue ths is ery spectacular kind of sots .
The are a lot of foobal tam , football events , and fan clubs in alot every country of the world .
ome ootall players are world famou ; they ae excellent carers and take part in each championship .
Football matches attract a lot of spectators , o coe supportig teir fvorits .
My peopl today go in for exeme sport .
Prhas , they find ordiary sports too brng n unexciting .
It is also kno tht extreme sorts lp to build character and form a srong peronaliy .
Ter are diffeent types of xteme sors , for example , rk clmbing , rafting , sua ivin , surfing , sowboarding , paachuting , hang - lidig , buge umpng etc .
These acivities usuall involve speed , height and a ood level of hsical raiing .
However , they eome moe and more popular en amng the beginners .
Doin such sports peopl learn how to overcome diffcult situatins nd how to survi in an emergency .
It as develops patience a lf - contro , and helps to control your fr .
ore importantly , it givs te sense of achievement .
Let 's conider some kind of etrme sports .
Take bungee uping .
You mp o a ridge and you fall n fall , n then , just before you hit te ground or water , an elastic rope pulls you bac .
In skysurfing you jump ot of an airlane nd use a board to " surf " te air , oing gymnasics in mid - air !
Winer sports have always an element of danger .
Fr exape snowbordig , which hs al the excitement of surfin but on sno , is more danerous evn than siig .
Ic diing is for thse peole who re absolutely craz .
Yo put on diving quipmen a dive under a frozen lak .
And , if ha 's not enoh , you t to wal upside down on te ice !
A lot of people r nt fit nowadays .
It 's a bi prole today .
If o an to feel f you 'd better go in or o kind of sport or another .
I thin at eveyon must do l to be ealthy .
Good halth is better tn he best medicine .
To tell the tuth I do n't do sports regularly and it is not an ssential art of my daily life .
In summer I go wmming as ter is a beaiful od with pr ater where my Gran lives .
In wite I go in for skating .
If I have fe tie I go to e nerst saing - rik with my friends and we have much pleasure , skating togther .
Ts kind of sport is er elegat .
Y shold control ou body very wel if you wish to kate gracefully .
I should n't cl myself a sports fan .
Of ourse , I wath sports competitions on TV from tie to ie , lke swmmig or running .
I admire xtree kinds of prt .
I thn tey r eally cool .
I admre people wh dae to do such spots .
Television is not an ise of genrl onsensus .
It is definitely a way of spendin our fe ime .
However , es it tch us something ?
oe it hp us grow and improe ou knwlege ?
On h o hnd , it is said to lp people to pend quality tme as tey a ean bout h most varied subjects fro he cofort of their homes .
It is possible to watch documentaries , th new , concerts , plays an len about urret affairs .
On h other ad , her are progamme whic bring nothing nw in our li .
Therefore , e sould not wast time watching tem .
Volnt pogramme , raliy shows and oters aik have nothing to teah .
In these cas , TV is undoubtedly bad entretainment .
l in l , it is my belief ht if we use it operly , i.e. , if we carefully choose hat to ee , television can have an iportant role to pl in the learning process of everyo of us , a in partcula , in te life of e oe w can n afford tavellin , bu books or ie in an educated environment .
If yu are ooking f a im that provids yo with suspense and action at th se time , I ecoend you to watch " Now yu e me " .
h fi , directed by Louis Leterier , is but four magicians , know as " he Four Hrsemen " that join togther by a mysterious benefactor , d during hir pesenations they do all kind of illegal suf , such as robbing a ban or ripping off their n bos .
Because of the , there 's an agnt of the F , Dyn Rhodes , th prsecute hem through different states of EE.UU .
e characters in charge of the four magicians are Jsse Eisenerg , la Fisher , Dave raco d Woody Harrelson .
he a capable of makin you think they really know how to illusn soeone .
Mogn Feman is the best actor of all time and prect or th role of developer tricks nd helper of e BI to catch the " ur Horsemen " .
lso hee is no oher tter r the role of aet as Mark uffao .
u it 's ot ju the actg tha it 's great in the fil .
The shot of Las Vegas , e Orleans , ais and w Yk are wonderful , an the fact hat nothing is computerized at h time to witess h mgc trcks it solutely amazing .
So if you ejoy mag tricks , surprises , very handsome acors d slnded actreses , w would yu miss it ?
What I d o in Vacations
During vacations I d n't njoy my tme because I did n't find out that I am a wizard .
Also , lien did not get me d practice surgery on me .
Sadly , I oud n't ee Lad aga nor Justin Timberlake .
I was very isapponted ecaus I id not do any of thee things during vacations .
Sice I did n't discover that I am , in fact , a wizard , I col n't g a magic wnd .
I dd ot go to Hogwarts ot urn my brher into a frg .
Being noral gets od and no beng a wizrd is shabby .
As alien d n't idnap me I did no trave all around h gaxy during this vcations week .
I did nt see t planets nor meet a exy ain grl fr Satrn .
Stayng at hm a day is regrettable a o being idnappd by aliens gets really boring .
After not ing a wizard nr kidnapped by aliens , I did not mee Lady Gaga in New York nor hang out with er and Jstin Timberake .
We thr counldn't ig together nor mk lugh of Kim Kardashian .
No one lkes being " unfamous " a I do n't like not beig Ldy Gaa 's rien .
Indeed , what I d in vacations was sleep e hol ay , hng u with my " Unfamou " friends ad write a ompse two and a half songs .
Wtchng " as in heaven , in hl " as hilarious alhough it is a hror movie .
Bu , lets face it doing thse things is o as wondeful as discovering magic powers , big kidnaped by alies or singin a song wth Justin Timbelak and Lady Gaa .
Finally , e hoidays hve stred .
us a w oe days n then we will be on ur way to ou holdy destination .
We wil be travelin by r to a campsite in Gemany .
It will be ou thrd me at thi campsite .
Even houg it is a large campsite it feels small and cosy .
he cmpste ordes on a small lake hich can be qute cl , even in summr .
However , we usually do nt let this stop us fo gong into he water .
We li to vist the cities and various sigh in e area .
e of the sgts we deinitely wan to e is te foer boder between West - Geman nd Eas - Germany .
We also lie hiking and re plannin on doin tha a couple of times per week .
Th egion wee we will ty hs a nice syst that encourages people to he .
At some poit during your hike you can olect amps in a special booket .
For somewhat yunge chilren this is a nice icentve to participate in thse his .
Soe hikes re short , t ste and soe ikes are long and invlve no climbing at all .
We ill probably stay at this campsite f about thee weeks ad bides t hiking we wi rad and laze bout .
Hello ! My name 's Vanesa , I 'm 33 and I really joy watching sp operas .
These dys I wtch a lot of different soap operas , though my favourite one is -and ll ways be- Frind .
Te plot is abu six young people ( tey 're about 26 ) : Rss , Rahel , Monica , Chandr , Joey & Phobe .
The iv in New York Ct and hv a lo of comicl a romantic adventures , ll of tem related to their friendship .
What could I say aout the charactes ?
Well , Ross is a paleonologist ha orks in th Natural istry Museum , ad he 's Mnica 's older brother .
Monica works as te man chef in a restaurant siuted in Manhattan , sh is Rachel 's best friend snce gh school n she lon for a boyfriend ( she finally marie hndler ) .
Chandler is the funny gy and he wrks as a stock agent .
Rachel a always be daddy 's ittl girl b , hen she brakes her egagement at the bginnin of e soap opera , e loses al r mony nd h to or as a waitress in a cafe ( though se gets a jo relate to fashion wld ater a few years ) .
Joey is ... wl , he 's oey : no so clever , a great n fr the girls and -the most important- Candler 's best rien .
And fnlly we hv Phoebe , a veggie n bohemian grl ho enos iging and playing th guitar and ho orks as a massage therapist .
The os interesting thin of ' Fries ' , in my opinion , is t ve stry between Ross and Racel : the pot stats when Rcel cms to live with Monica in he apartmen and Ross fall in lov ih h .
Ths toy ontiues until the d of h sap opera , when Ross and Rachel finally ave a chid ( Ea ) .
Bt there a a lot of funny stoies , like Poee having her stepbrother 's children , or Joey becoming a great soap opera acor .
I recommend ' Friends ' to everyone .
I think it 's t best soap opera ever made .
Living without Intenet : Is it possible ?
Oh my Gd !
Today is the a . I hav en told hat I wl be moving to my ne apartment .
God nw !
Bt , wait !
It ll as man ot having aces to the Interet for a month !
Will I svive ?
Will my life be the sa ?
First of all , I have to sa tat I total epend on the Internet .
Fo 7 am to 7 pm , my compur is running sufing the Internet .
Nt only I e it r leisure , but I alo use it for wor . I would have to change the way I do things on a daily basis .
Secondl , I av my rinds iving abad . I communicate wt tem usin Skype .
Will I ee to use te phone nstad ?
Unlike he Internet , phone calls are rely xpensve .
I am o sure if I cul afford it .
il I fid mysf wrtin letters ?
Another thng to consider is not havng that open window to h world .
Wl have to start buying magazines and nespapers to be infmed ?
In conclusion , my life ill be copletey chaned .
My aly rutie is based on havig access to the Inernet : alking to my frieds , reading he newspapers , the forecat weter , d so on ... I will have to chane my lie .
The wrog hice an lead to a g mstak hat ca nfuence on our ife a eole arod us .
Michael was a rson that a afraid of making y mistakes .
A e pesn entered his life one a .
Michel wa nervous whn he was aske to do some work toether wit that new fellow .
What if at the boy could be smarter than he himself ?
The onl y was to show and prve eeryoe tha he was he best .
So , he decided to nore him absolutely .
He did n't answer to s uestons an did n't want to use all his ideas .
Th wok wa one and Micael was poud because everything s de by hmsef .
Th newcoer col ol watch it with a sy sile .
hei boss checkd h wrk en .
He wanted to kno his partner 's opinion too .
The poo boy sid he ws inspired by Micael 's enthusiasm .
He praised te Michael 's work .
It was perfect and he wld be glad just to imprve so thigs , to change t structure , to exclude unnecessary facts , to d some bright illustraions d so on .
h boy had canged everything in e content of he work by th end of their conversatin .
Thy both left he ofice oo .
Michal closed th doo and kew at that momet he h me a mistake .
Feeble souls
Mst ople lov donatg mone to differnt chartes , u ha you ee thought why it gies us sc pleasure ? I believe it 's ecase , as humans , wen we e someone hap , it makes us happy , esecally if we e the reason for that appiess .
he problem is choosing w to donte to .
Is it the por , homles children in your country or the starving eple in Afia , or is it some cancer organizations ?
I choose none of the abv .
I 've ever understood why mt people se a clsd e of chariable orgniztions to chos from whn they want to donte mon .
In oter wods , the chose oly from t most ommon cuss .
Whe I think abou dnting oney I e sick chldren ad adults with are diseases , d mal grou of scientists and ctors dng tei best to help them , ut who do n't have enoug mne o resarc . I chose them becuse I kow tt tey r the lat pole wh gt hep - beuse how wud people hel thm if they do n't know aut hm ?
Firt thin I 'd do if I want to make a donation is go on the intern , and search Gogl for are dseaes .
Ten I 'll ok o the disases which th scietsts ar currently workn on finding their cure .
I 'll be left ih a lt to chose from , so I 'll ee which illness is the hadest to endure and choose tis one to dnae my moey to .
I have one of tose unknw diseases , an I coul easl donate to e doctors working on my illnss , but I probbly wo n't . I nw tht there re a t of other pple with dseses that re way hade han my o , d the ne a cure much moe than I do .
Tis kes me ealiz that ee if I ave a disease , as ard as it is , I 'm sll better tha otrs d I 'm grateul .
I 'm grateful I ca bear my sicness nd lve with it , because others ca n't .
To u up , I believ more popl should start doating to te uncomm charity organisations , to the ones who ned moe help .
It wold be sufficient to jut see e smile on their fac .
We shud ll be thankful we ar wht we are , because we could be a lo woe .
According to Berow ( 2004 ) , Airway management is on componnt of anaesthsia procedure to ensure the paien iway is ened .
An example of an intrventin in aray managent is the ventilation mask that Mr. Sharma a using .
Alo , this practice is the prmary consderation for an efficient ot anastesia care ( Scoot , 2012 ) .
The majoity of ptients that has a a eeral anaesthetic , as Mr. Sharma , must recer in a ACU ( Pot Anaesthesia Care ni ) to nitor he ital signs , specially te airways management de to the anaesthesia , imedig a postoperative compicatin ( Scoot , 212 ; Farrell & Dempsey , 01 ) .
The fist 24 hours of pos surgery , is considered the most citcal perid , beause e atient can present , primarily , ug isorders , and the nurse nee to maintn the cardi - respiratory sability ( Popov & Pench , 29 ) .
Addressing t airway managemt after Mr. Sharma 's admissin on PA , te irst procedure hat th nure hould do , is follow he A - G assessment protool , to revew th stability nd the airwy pateny of he patient , sustainn te pulmonary ventilation to prevent hypoxemia n hypercapnia ( Farrell & Dempsy , 2010 ) .
Mr. Shara 's airway hould be pae d cea from mucus or blood ( Pudner , 2010 ) .
De to he urgery Mr Sharma is in upine position , b tis posiion reduces i oxygenation ( Snwbll , 2012 ) , and also n impede the air passe that is related to e anaesthesi effect , whee the tongue ad the lower j fl backwad .
Hen , he needs xygen supy to prevent any arwa obstructio .
Therefore , te oxygen therpy neds to coninue imediaely along wit i admission , via nasal canula or oxygen mask wtin 4 to 6L / mn , until he anesthesi effet are cmletely gone and th patient 's oxygen sauration be restored ( Farell & Dempsey , 01 ) .
Thus , Mr. Sarma is ben given O2 a Hson mask 6L / min , becase he received geral anaestesa n al of his muscles a elaxed nd at e mmet he do n have cotrol over i rlexes ( arrll & Dmsey , 2010 ) .
To help in this issue , the nurse should certifcate ht Mr. Sharma is conforable , n elevate the ead of th bd for a ore urigt psition in oder to faciliate ad increase is oxygenation , helping h to recover fastr his respiraory instabity ( Snowball , 20 ) .
The reson wy wling is the best spor on the face of the Ert
First of all , t me adress h title of this ticle .
I realise walig is nt considered a sort by evryone .
I think it is a wrong way of thinking of spors .
Theefoe , I am oig to explain the avatages of walking .
I would like to start saying it is free .
his could be seen as something minor , but being abe to do the sort ou love without pying is an ncedible dvanage .
Secondly , I ove its reedm ; no p itnded .
You ca walk whenever an wheeve ou ike .
That is priceless .
Tirdl , wking gives you a longer lf epectancy .
Ther are a l of studies that prove thi .
Last but ot least , you do no ee y kind of spcial equipmet or people .
You can go walkig alone nd witout shoes if you please .
Neertheles , you learn a lo of things about any sport oce you start doing it .
Therefore , I would like to share some thing th y .
You can start walkg as you like , despite that , ou should wa comfortable clothes a ses .
The reason is that , th longr yu ak , e more you il feel what you are werng .
The second avce is o should try to ind te bst aces to walk around o .
The sighseing is ve impotnt once you star walking .
I hope I ave onvince l of you to go wling .
I am a true believe in waling .
Do not forget to grt me he we met on the road .
All students ar dfferent in tems of thei cogiive stys , larnng level and chieveents as well as mtivation , personalty , ad pce of learning .
Whe hre r students wih varied lees in English , it may be challengng or achers to prepare for or deliver te cous .
Here are me of my solutions for tis issue .
First of all , etermining the nee of the stdent is alwys th to priority .
Wile conducing a need analis , ou can he a geeal picture of learers ' moivaton in learnig English .
fte tht , teachers are supposed to use artnershi and grouping exeriss and activities in oder to me individual 's ees .
Trogh teamork , studets with vred levels can ooerate and learn from ah other trogh discussions .
It is beneficial for both the uper d lower achevr bcuse th can assst or get help from each other .
Differentiated instructions , giving different tasks for te se actiity , are proved to be necessar in a class with vried leve of students .
Teachers n assign tasks whih hv iffernt levels of diffcuty , or different numbers of taks to students with different leves .
Moreover , insead of usng a cr textook , or using different levels of extbook , crying out a theme - baed approach is more appropriate , and it als aves teachers ' reparation time .
Finally , prearing supplementary for bt the uper or owe lel of studens , so tat h gher ahieers cn stay excited nd chaleged , hil the wer achiever cn also lear by their own pc of earning .
Young people in kraine are more comprehensively developed than young people in US .
o yungters hv open access to nowledge and information hrogh t Internet .
tudents ve moe opportunities to learn language , disver foign experience , as interships and study abrad .
he number of Uranian stunts who tudy road incrase ever yea .
Ou generation is more developed and diverse in phers of moden culture , including arts , music , literature tc .
The most vauable thing is that there a so many supporters of differn trns in l thes aeas .
In Ukrane ung pple are different too .
So peop pref one stye of music , some - another .
That 's wh it 's difficult to dine one general tyle f he geeratio .
Disussng music yles , people in my conty refer p and rc .
We can dene it by list of TOP usic chaters on usi hanels .
There re a lo of Ukrainian executives .
It 's necsary to emphsze tat Ukraian usc as chged a ot from the time of Inepenence and o is developed ey as .
If we spak out TV programs , Ukrainia youngstes ie opular American an Russia erals , like he Theor of g ng , Suits , Breaking bad , t Gae of thrones , the Kitche an so on . I must admit that some representatives of Ukrainian out atc too man serials and waste a lot of their tim .
I thin hi prole is typical o almost all ounties .
In cloths , yousters pefer to ea famous fashion brands .
Ma peopl llow fashion designers .
It 's interestn to admit that tere is fashio on Uranian traditional clohe " vishyvanka " nw .
I he ter reading of my report yo will have some minia understading of Ukrainian relity .
Also I encourage ou to visit Ukraine and to see its sghtsens , to feel cultue a speak to ice pople !
I li in a mall to called i .
It 's in the norhwes of Spain , in Glicia .
It 's a sll town n there are t t ay options of travelling by public transpor .
My town s got a t of litle vllage arud it , and it 's ery difficult to creae a public transport service , because the are long disances between e fferent places , and tere are n enou peope to mke it profitable .
If you want to go to Vo or other ity which is near , th coach servc is a od d ot too expeive option .
The coaches are low , so os of t people prefer the car .
If or destiny is furher away , another good option is to trve by train .
We have gt a small train statn in Tui , so we a go to a l of plces by trn .
Train is mr expensive , bt at h me time , it is mre comfortable .
So I hink tha creatig a small bus line btween h villages will help a lt of peol , especially the ode ns .

ENGLIH - LANGUAGE TV PROGRAMMES IN ITALY .
Introduction
h purpse of this rert is to analy nd assess the imact of English - laguage television pogrames on talian culture and to make suitable recommendations .
Popularity of English - language TV programmes
T presene on electronic devices of English - lauage TV prorammes is becoming more d more prominet .
A srey as carried out in h ot poplated talian cities ad 2000 citizens we interviewed on 22nd Otobe to quantify hei interest in such segment of the natioal TV schedl wih te followg rslts :
‚Ä¢ 40% of hose interviewe , st of which hv proven to be young people , declred thy wch English - language TV programmes at lest five times a we ;
‚Ä¢ 30% of tem sated hey watch te at ms twie a eek , u they wuld so more otn if hy wee subitled ;
‚Ä¢ 30% of tm id ty nver watch tem .
ople enjoy listening to the originl aio , hich entals realism and naturalness .
Besdes , avoiding h dubbing prcss , epises ca be seen in oncrt with their original arin .
Imat on lcal ulure
Although he importion of such programmes has produe positive efets , su as he itroducion of new perspectives on different aspct of ie , it s also produced negtve outcoms .
Italian companies must fe the hallenge s by the market demand due to the importato of any forign traditios .
Recommndatons
It is highl recommended that e government should provide aeqate financial support to traditional small busnesses .
I ould therefore suggest tht lcal poucts be protected and valorised , to be able to reply to t hrat represente by low rice imported ones .
Oe intellient person once aid : ' The world is a ok and hse wh do nt travel read only one pag . '
I totally agree with th statement and , to my mind , eopl should travel a lot because our world is incredible .
But hee is ne ore question : travel by c or pblic trnsort ?
Fit of ll , of course , travelling by car is much more convenient than , fo exmpl , by u .
You n drive wherever and whenever yo want .
Even us in citie , t it lon travelling at long disancs .
But , on th other hand , raffc jm or bad wather can make ur trip inconvenient .
Moreover , there are t my parkng plaes in bg cities .
Secondly , travelng by public tansport is muh heaper .
No a eole c afford travling by a evey y so they choose pblic transpot .
Thrdl , we houl take care of o environment !
Cars pollute our air what leads to many diseses such as shma , alrgy and evn ancer .
Moreover , cs rlease pisonous exhaust fumes n hemicas into h a , which mi with te water in h loud , and th polluted rain , hich later alls , damages trees , lke a buidigs .
So , my avice is to tvel by bicyce ( at ast , use pulic tranport ) because it is envirnmetally iendly !
Summary of the aticl " Bsines √† la fran√ßas " wih w written by Simn Kpr .
By Ao rodeur , student number 1234567 , clss ABCD1EF .
The diffeence in work meetings beteen the riish and race are ta th British want to make decisions ad the France way mor le a debate , as is written in a guide r Franc - Britsh businss relationships .
Te opinion of Simon Kuper is tt he mn reason for the misunderstandings are different languages .
This in contrast to h gid " Light at the End of t unel : Pracicl Reflecios on te French and British in Business " publihed by t Freh chamber of commerce in Gra Briai .
The by he UK 's Foreign Office in 194 published ooklet " instructions fr British Serviceman in Frnc " is sil useful for te mo , nwadays .
The late ato Louis de Fun√®s is etioned as a ole ode by he chamber of commerce 's guide .
When you get hed by a British employer it will be because of your xperiene or achievements as a leader in sports .
In France the lel of education is h man reason or irng soeone .
British does n't speak ou what tey r hinking , in ontrast to the Dutch .
he chamber 's guide was written by bsiness men and women who we famiar wth the hits of bot countries .
omething to remmer is tat pople alw each oher their ow naional habits , up to a ertain point .
In 1995 e Fenc came to notice that their lngush was n't enough fr doi business worldwide .
is is on of the easons y most French under 50 es n't speak English vy well .
Itrnational relationships e bilt by people who can speak the same languish and who ar at h sm lee of thir vocabulary .
The tive speakers seek each oter out , t Britih ce together th t Amricans ad the ench well ‚Ä¶ they are on their own .
If the rench and Britsh spke the same languish venl , the trade would go up by 44 pr cn .
It 's no us to eah rench on schools , beaue t French only except near ntive speakers .
It 's better to talk British nd orc it on the .
¬´ I 'm 22 years old and my nme is Dani .
I live in a smal on caled Gycksb and I 've be part of Unga Kris volunteering programs sice he mmer 21 .
At first , I joined Unga KRI and strted volunteering to hve fun and meet nw peole .
Now tat I have been volunteering or a while , my expectations he changed : Un KRS is stil a pac where I expect to have fu and mee w peop bu I also expct to row even more as a person , to take on resposibilities an ae my fears in iferent social situatin . ¬ª
I choose hs top becaus I think oluteer work is important .
Volunteer work provides an orgnization with free resources to hl it achieve gas .
In many cses , olunteers are crucil to lp maintn life , as whe eas a delivered to hoebund people .
Someies volunteer work , such as rnovaing a lyground , benefits the broader cmmuniy .
And while volunteer wor is imprant for he ndividals and communiti served , it also eefits e vountee .
I ae already one volunteer work and it 's something I want to do aga .
It 's something that makes ar of our grow to adltood .
When I was nineteen , I started and ran my own business , for me , wa ne of te ot excting choices tha I made .
Of course , without th full support of my fami I could n't ve doe it .
At frs , I found it as an exhilarating nd rewarig chalene , although it was a mdes shop .
In fc , I w reponsibl and I had he determnation ad the skills , because I learned it from my parets .
But it was n't enough , he fact of the matter was that I ignord that ein slf- employed ntailed lf - sacrifice , devoting my time , energies and a grat deal of patience with the cutmers , it was so hard!.
hings gradall improved ay by day for a tm and my renees stated growing .
So I dd n't ind woring against time and long hours .
I ot use to it .
I was ver ambiious !
During the next ten ars , I was thrilled about te ct to pu aside in rder to build ou at step by tep .
Whn I t arried , things uckly wnt from bad to worse because I hd to work at two shfts , at he n e sop .
It was exhausting ! !

u life - 50 yers ro now
Most pople think tat in 50 years ' im , we wi have ued up all the Earth 's natural resources .
Th ay that te Ear 's population wi need to find and colonise two planets as u forests an fresh water supplies will vanis .
Of course , l of ts is unrealistic .
It 'll be impossible for people to liv on othr plaes in 50 years ' ti .
Tecnolgy wo n't ve been advanced ough by that ti .
ut it 's ot entirely mpossble .
Thre is a litt trth ad possibility in it .
In 50 years ' time , ayb not l of h nural resources il have en ud up , b mot of it ten wll ave en exploited .
Mankind will have found otr eneg sources , simia to wind owred ergy , solar energ d ter poere energy .
Maybe hy wil be sng aos or hdrogn , since hydrogen is l aroun us d it 's ver powerful .

Popl hold different iws about the caes of crime .
While some peoe aru that bd human natur is th reason , it is undeniable hat soca problems and indigence e respnsile for the prolfration of wrongdoings .
To begn wi , it is ue that human are often born wh greed ad selfishness .
For example , it is not dfficult to e the edia tlking bout a o wo kils his prents o money or a gil ho is murdered by he bofriend out of re due to jealousy .
Thse cies ma be comittd by sensible pele o are o ale to contrl themelves at crucial ime .
Tu , bad natural personality can be e eed of rime .
On the ohr nd , I wold arg tat poverty cn be the mor ctayst for illegality .
It means that a number of law offenders can not sutan thei livihood , and thy desrately xperiene lmied options to ern money .
As a result , he are easily drawn by t alue of wealt , which eads to ileal ativities such as het , kidnapping or du traficking .
Big cties su as Hanoi or New Delhi wines a growt in juvnile delinquey which stly stems from rual and unerdeveloped aras .
The proliferation of these crimes undoubtedly as a negtiv effect on the city 's life .
In addition , the prevalence of ocial media uch as television or h intert is partially to blme .
The effc of adlt moves on the Interet can caus ffece such as rape .
Also , films and video games containing volent scees can stimulate audiences to itate those acts d comt crimes .
Ti is partcularly omon among young people who are nabl to differentiate between fiction and reality .
In conclusion , although human naur is likely to be a cause of rme , I hold te position tht rme occur du to scial media nd pverty .
In th past people used techology as a tool for making survival an easier endaor .
Noadys we are witessng a hft in the role technology is plying in our socity and may continu to ply for generations to come .
In the modern - a world technology is no onger a tool for urvival but it turned to a eas of comuncation ad eterainment .
Mas communication tchnology has made it esir than ever to connect wih people .
At the sae ti his rais the concern of wether technoog s a good or ba ifluence on ou society , is the use of tecnoloy detroying face - to - face inraction n communication btween people ?
Whenever you 're in a ffee shop , standing at a bs stp or taking the tube yo n easly see ho people are connected to each other ung different ort of lectroic vices .
The primary cnern regading this new communication behavi is whehe it mae face - to - face interaction and comunication beween people nonexistent .
This is true in any aspct as hs m ad to living in a virtual worl that oy includes interacting ith pople with textig and social networks .
This eads , among other thing , to the abilt fo eope to be onely , as havin too man virtua rendships auses the inability to establish meaingful relatnships .

But with Coon 's quoation , we can clealy se that it has happened ince years .

These kinds of sports have so advanaes and disadvantages .

According to suies , martial rts have fewer injuries than other sports like soccer .
People wh practie martial rs are es aggressive because hey practice to control her inner energy , n so to respect .
I suggest tat everyone should try martial prts .
But before sartng , yu suppse to evaluate your needs ad ur halt conditon .

In the ther word , ty to understand the philosophy of the sports before learnig the tecniqes .

FRIENDSHIP TOAY
As the majority of you I have friends who are til around me sne ay years g although we do n't see ec ther reularl , others imly have sftly become less important n some luckily hv recently entere my life .
At ome point , all of us have benefited enormously from a real friendship .

unting on someone capable of undrstanding your demands , who shares with you h innermost feeling a wh is abe of discussng posile misunderstandings , is totally rewarding .
As the sying goes " A iend in ed is a friend idee " .
Nertheless , a friendship depends largely on sincerity and empthy .
If you respect yur friends then he wll respect yu .
In other words , no matte h far you lie , a go frid will aways support to you .
Criosly , yu never know wre will you fid a riend and every stage of your lie brings y the opportuniy to te advantage of new eopl who maye atends to the same srt lessons tha y or simply or in the same company .
It is surprising h amount of nce pope next to yo sometimes , an it is a question of spending some time to realize that yo av o n frind .

It as a winter ight .
While mot people tayed at home next to th firepace , I w on the oin of changing my life .
Not only was it going to change my life , t also her person 's life .
Suddenly , te streets of te village were witnesses of th deadul crime .
Some days later , sombody knocked at the door .
When I opened , I was handcuffed straight awy and I prtened to be urprised .
Wen we arrived at the police office , I met an oficer called ichae .
He told me he s going to nteview me . I had rid to t id of e od .
Neverthless , h polic had found out the burid body .
Michael asked me were I h be at h me of the cri and I answered him at I had been at home aing a rst with a friend wo coul ear ou te aib .
While the inerview , I reaised the different ways I woul use to e wy if I were alone .
Forunately , Michael , w d n't thought ha otion , lft th interrgtion room .
Mihae closed he door nd knew at tha moment he ad made a miake .
eter lookd at his watch and new th he a to do something immeiately .
Tm was running out , he thuht to himsf .
Een now , as he stood in the doorwa of this abanoned apartment building he ew that they my be hot on s trail .
Wit over wo hudred thousand ollars in is a he was a gant walking targ .
He sied , knowing ht een the es aid plans crumble a ws gd tha he s tauh to la to police standas .
Peter egan his so disset ino t bwels of h building in front of m .
Rged nd wo , it certain had seen better ds .
raffiti covered the lower prtons le a tistd srt , doors msing , and windows gone .
His fet crunched on the unknown as he alked thogh he badoned allway .
Travelling arther down he found hi destiation , a smal step staircase covered in dust and shrude in a mist like fog .
Peter 's head erked around as h frt signs of s crime ce to light .
A police officers ca w zooming in his direction , sirens blaring .
Now runnin , Pete soon fod himself on h top floor .
H aning tuned to a magnificent grin as he lked out the window d w a black eicopter heading in hs directin .
Home re , he thugt to himslf .
To begin with , I thnk tt ost peol us their car to go to wok d also wn hy go on holiday o to moe theseves aoud t city or town becuse the feel fee and do n't ve to pay atenion to e timetable .
Besides , publc transport is very cowde wt people at peak hrs .
ut , on t other hand , whe ty ravel abroad , it 's easier to take a train o a plane because you rrive faster n yu ed n't find a place to pak your car and if u want to go somewhere o a te a taxi or a bus or en he underground .
In conlusion , fom my oint of iw , if y ae in yo own on or cty , ou use you r ore ofen than we you ae visitig nother ountry n eing t ight .
nway , I do n't think ubic transport h no ture , but public trasport is ud on different ocaions from before and when y go to a place yu knw u wo n't be able to find a place to rk ad you ca n't waste tme looking for here to park .
This daram illustrates the complete proess of note - makig .
To ak bank nes , the fir ste is to propely design it .
Whi background colo and at ork e thorougl cosideed , security issues e one thin ta we can not ovr look either .
After this , metl plates ed to be prepard by skiled machinists so as to proceed to an nte prining , in which sage sheets r used to rit ( eah ontaiing 50 bn ots ) .
Also , special n is printed on bo side of t hee n the images e slightly raised .

In hs tep , worers are eeded to anually inspect he quality of sheets ad divid them ito three groups : good quality , parally damaged qality an bad qulity .

I am writing to inform yo that t package holiays to Mdri you are currently advertsing in your newspper are apparnty o wha th clamd to be .
I lieve yo should be fully informed about the qality of e services in the advertsements you pulih , as you reaer could be neatvely biassed towards your paer ly e to such incidents .
Geerally , t holidy as a whole was good enough as e mot important -in my opiion- aspec , like the quali of he gided tours n the accommoation , w very high .

The turist agncy made roup bookings , whch esultd in the unusualy low price of e hliday package .
Spening holidays with a grop can be ver conveient and for soe pele is e oly way of travlling , but th advertisement did not state clealy that it concerned hi paticular ype of holiday , which made me an som others feel deceived .
Anote point of concern wa transportation .
We had sevel problms , especially wt the bus , which was ofte delayed nd in n case it evn caused us to miss a scheduled guided tour .
I believe ther is plenty of room for imrovement since , although the prblms re not insuperable , tey caused great inconvenience .
Firstly , a better trnsort ageny should be oun or te former ifficultis to be pevented .
Secondly , advertisements should be clerer as it is very easy fo someone to misunderstand thm .
But the most imporant sue is h improvement of te general organization .
Muc tme lot coul have en sed th a few phone alls , r exmle waiting o haf an hor in a queue could hae bn reveted if a cll hd ben made to the museum before we rrived thee .
I assume ta the ourist ageny can think of better solutions than me , but I hope ta my recommenatios wil be tae seriously .

On one hnd , parents should ke responsibiit on their childre eucatio as tey ae a chid 's first contact .
Als , parents ar like odels to foll for teir children , and as children do what they see they will py their parents actio .
Indeed school is th first pae her a hildren intercts with socety .
Hoevr , the wl talk or build a relationship bed on what they s teir parnt din wth other people .
Ulimately , teacher m ha different vaues fro e ons of the paents .
On the oher ha , parents ma have ac of time to pend wih ter cildrn e to demanding jbs an to provide everyting tat teir chilren need , for example pay for ther childre school .
It can also be argued that childen spend most of thr im at scool nd n at home , makng h schl responsibility to pass good cial aues .
Bt it should n be forgote , that prnts have the mo infuence as they ar moes to follow .
To u up , parnts should take ful resonsibility fr their children eucation .
Hower , one should take ito account tat a school ith similar values to th ones of t parents wod be a great help in th cildren raising procs .

REPORT ON THE CURS " ood design using DTP "
The a of this report is to riefly escrib e main strenth nd weaknesse of the couse " Good design using DT " so as to give an oveall vi of it .
DESCRPTION
Th course oo place in t Training center in Regent Steet - Lodon on the 14 - 15 of May , as scheduled .
A t paticipants , whih wee ten in toal , were gve a personal compur for the dratin of the entire course in ore to t into practice what was tauht .
Furthrmore , te organizrs had carefully plannd the whole course , including meals and beverages too .
ACHIEVEMENTS
The tutor , Will Rees - a lecturer of he niversity of Cambridge , scceeded in covering e whe program in an extemely effective way .
To ein with , he focused on desgn considerations with DPT , explaining what softwae to use , and hn he we on to tll us bout typorphy ad fons , layout n balce as el as graphics and logs .
hereore , he coclued h curse by makig olor considerations and showing proofing and printing .
e highpoint , however , wa the ina practical exercss which gave us h oppotunity to test our comprehenson .
FAILRES
Despite t strengths metined aboe , thee ere al some eas ta rquird some atteion .
Not ony was th venue icovenient u it ws also dirty .
Te generl dissatisfaction wa perceived by he ectuer too , who pointed it u to the organizrs wo mediately started oking fr an alternative enue .
In addion , in spite of having paid a ot , the particiants were nt alwed to take y material away , d is resulted in obtaining a les effective reslt as t partcipnts did n't have ny materials to use to revse .
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS
To um up , h corse w generally successful , as e positive eedback received suggests .
In coclusion , we would definitely recommend it to anybody interested in his subject o bth the quality of te course a h unquestionable preparation of the utor .
Nwadas , my countre ave been uine ares of farland , forest and wetland with h intention to construct husing ad transport nework to cater to t demand of peopl .
Ther e many probems create by don large - biling projects , n it is the oernment 's responsibilit to pe wi these problems .
There r some unfavorale influence on eple 's ies .
Because of he damage of farmld , frest nd wetan , it is likely to ed to e pollution of watr a air , hich cn caue t decrease of people 's ving quality .
or exple , in some areas , peple hae to we a musk wil havg outdoor activities ad they miht ne to purchase atr from her towns .
As a reult , thir lifestye can be ngaively affect an thus they woul feel less happy than other people lvd in unpolluted areas .
The mage of habitats ave affec animls in negative ay .
Th have to immigrate to another place since teir homs r destroyed , and drin the imigration most of hm woul e because of lck of water , ih temperature or predaor .
Besides , tho animals who successflly arrive at proper ace to ie ae likl to sffer from diease , because they d n't exposed to such a new enironment before .
Although there re man people nd animals ae suffer fo tes proble , i do beiee that the govenment can tae sme acons to solve them .
Firstly , laws should be set to fobid some projects which use msive problems to h environment .
Secondly , it is necessary for h governnt to warn people h seious problems caused by cnstucting large - scale buildings .
To summarise , lage - scale building projects reate massive prblms whi e armful to man a animals , bu the government can be elpul in solving these problems
First of ll , at the English course which I do at e HZ , I leare an imprved my writin in many ways .
I would lie to answer sme questions fr he guidene on Moodle , to expai how hs coure hepe me to improve my English .
So , e frst wo questions are :
Has my writin improved a o di this appen ?
nd te other qustions : Which areas of my writing wud I lie to improve n did the free writing preentaions elpd me it my writing rocess ?
Scondly , hs my writing improved and in what way id this happen hen ?
From my pont of iew , my writing definitely a improved from e beginning of this scho ye til nw .
I discovere that I know ny mre words ha I thoght an I ca make well - structured enteces w , hich I could n't do so wel at h beginnin of ts school yea .
Thi has to do with the technical grammatical featues I learned in cas as wl .
The way I see it is tht I learned to u cohesion in a correct wa , which makes the paragraphs that I wrie oe cla .
Beids that , I use cohesion which I dd n't s fore this cuse .
A few examles are : fro my point of view nd it ees to me .
Subsquently , I wod like to answe te next two questions .
Whih ras of my ritng oul I like to improve d did e free writing preentations helped me with my witng prcss ?
Although I beliv tha I aread have improved my ngish since the eginning of th school yea , I 'd like to improve my English vocabulary .
As I ee it , the bgger te vocabulary , he btter the writing process .
More ord can be ad in the artice , so tere c be a better explanation of te subject .
It 's my belief hat t fre wriig presentations helped me with my writing rocess .
I learned a lot of ew ords durig t presentations , which I used in my free writing .
To finish , I can onclud hat this English course has een very eful to me , because it as improved my Enlish vey ell .
h way I se it is th he grammatical fetures earned in nglish curs , always can be used laer on in life .
For example , when there hav to be se lettrs in English .
I agre ith he given statement .
Thi is becae all the people deam f a btte futue .
A better futr means havig god food to at witot worying , good clothes to wear , a g roerty , a prvate mea of transportatio d ma mre .
Amn em a private means of transporttio suggests ha there is no future r ubli tasport .
It is already in actice in wsten world .
People fo other parts of the world are alo heading or he ae drem .
Having ow car or mens of transportation is the dream of every individual incudng me .
A single cr will not be enouh or a famil .
Prvate cae per individual is needed .
It has aso become a vital thing or life .
Whehr to go to work or ter places travllin in private vehicle is hassle free .
It aves lot of u time .
We can inule in many thgs if we c manage te properly .
The trend of peronal cr is increain rapidly .
So , I believe tha the is no futur r pblc transpor .
We cn not deny hat thre wl be time whn no eson woul lie to travel by u or train .
It is so much clear that prite transport il overshadow the publc vehcle .
Domesti violene
Everybody kows aout the big probl that our society a , in tem of domestic abuse .
But most of us ju from r ; we ealy do not iagie how hi n afect eople who suffer it .
Unfortunately , mny people are damaged , o only physical b mentally and the worst is hat violece destoy famils nd also involves their sons in te hel it caues .
Children qute oftn fel guilty of an not avoid hese troube or help ther mothers to esce from hm a tend to thin the are doing something wrong wen the obviusly do o .
Te are just the most sensitive n innocent victims of mistreatment .
It is ver serious n ar to solve because victims ave to be ery strong and bre to recognze an fae these situations n eing be to repor tir aggressor so as to manag te matter finishes .
is is so difficult due to the fat ha they usually ee stupi , miserable , hopeless and do t fel oo aout themselves .
her aggressors ae them eome insecure and ty ink that they a aone .
Even , in mos cas , the eel ashamed or afraid of these sitatons and prefe sayig nothing to tell their tuh .
ll thos people who ar livig is abuse ae to nw at thy r really important n deserve to be hapy an free and they are not lon .
Ther re many peope who worry but and e willing to help and support them .
There is aways omeone who you ca cont on in your famy , frends or associaions , bu u st ask for help .
We nee to conser bot sides of the argument for publc transprt use prior to rachig a conclusin .
Public transport is sd for many reaons and a be convenient fo different cicumstances .
There e mny easns fo uin public traport , such as cmmutig in to the central business district .
This form of transpot c be used to avod delays du to traffi cnditions and parng restictions .
It c provid an opporunit o people to complete wr during the jouney .
ublic transport may be the nly tion for individas who do o rive or have access to a car .
It is mre envronmenally friedly cause it a te potential to reduce th numbers of vehicles on the road .
However , the public rasport us n be fected by a numbe of factor sch as mchanical failures and environmental issues .
It y be pensive to u for some individals ad crowded dung ush hours .
Using the ar can be mo flexbl for some inividuals .
A r can be useul for efecive performance of mny asks .
It is easier to chne rotes whe circumstances change unexpectedly .
Howver , a car c be expensive to maiain , rk ad fu .
I think tee is a role or both methods of traspot ater takig in to ccount all of t aove rasons .
Te reass fo us is depenen on th individual and the circumstances .
My favourie film of the lst few oths is " Sen of a woman " .
It 's one of h best Al Pacin 's fis and it 's er different from previous ones .
First of al , in hi film you do n't see a gagstr Al Paco , it 's about a retre rmy 's ooel who suffer from lonliess nd dpression .
It 's wot seeing becaus a young boy , Charlie , helps him gt throug s sadness in a vry luxuros ti to New Yrk .
One prolem is that some scene r too long , like e one in wich they 're havng dner with the coonel 's family .
However , the drama is perfectly ahieved in each scene a they keep you tid to th screen .
So , overall I sronly recommend it if ou ike rdemption stories , d if you want to arn som pieces of advice for your le .
It 's certainly a good chce if u want to wtch a DVD net Friday ight .
e reading dissses the idea of how advanc communication technologies give us an advantages of creting a 24/7 interatinal working y d provids several reasons of suprt .
Th profesor , hoever , dsgrees with points made in h arcle and explains that this system has ts ow isadvantages .
First pin he rofssor addresses invlves t radig 's assertion that creating two or tree teams situated in difernt geographical locations will help reduce the work hors for each tem and at the same tie it will decrese the te frae of getting e project done .
he professor refutes tis point of view by saying tha bsed on is own exprince th eam work could be no so uch benefiial .
Fo istnce , some group could have questions , but it wou t be ale to sk he other grup becau te would sleep at ht time .
Therefor , the workn group wl do i assumptions a my cause a wte of time .
Moreover , the group in alifonia may do work in one way n a group in India do same wrk differnly , so it will be challnging to bing ot of them to the sam w of getting tings doe .
nother poin rm the rtile tha the professor opposes is the claim ta telcommunication helps to solve mn proles that physical separaton uld cause to businesses .
The prfessr points out tat hlding virtual meetings btwen teams in different time fames wl be challenging .
hs , one of the team will have to stay late in orde to alk to ather group causing nconvenience .
It is t ay to proe that there is a reationshp beteen organizational culture and perfrmance .
For a vey long time there as no be sientific evidence ha proved the relationship etwee organizational cltur and performance , uti tudies fond a correlation between these ujects .
The four stuies are put together in a mdel amed ' Organiation Culture Pefrmance oel ' ( OCPM ) .
his model ell us that the cuture is determined by actl behavior of individual or groups of mployees .
The culture is caused by rganizational variabes .
These variables include ineral an external cultural epects .
T exteral spet is : external ient orienaion .
T internal asects ae : dsign of organizatio , communication , RM - orientaton and leadership .
This vaiabls influence the beavior of employees .
Th mode distinguishes three kins of epected performancs : individual- , grups- , and rganizationa perfomances .
Tere is n't a dict elatonship between organizational clture an actal performances , but tere is a dret relationship between organizational uture and expected performances .
The researchers found that tee is a big diference betwen wa the boadoom preach and what t employee 's experience .
A short summay of e OM- model : thee e organizational variables that determine te visibe nd invisble beaior of eployes .
These variables and behavir of emloyees dtermne the pected performance and then here is h actual utome .
Shou smokg be bnned ?
oe and mre people nowadays try to fd sm ws of relaxation , u to a ast pc of ie and sress .
Smokg appeas to hearts of mny pople of different generations , because it gives a fst relief r a short period of time , at is also qui easonable .
It 's a act that tobacco is use as a iht dr o centuries by people of diferent nationalities .
It 's a rl issue fo th government to udertand that if th process of bannin mokrs sars , the ince te will immediately decreas .
Moreoer tbacc contains a vitamin , alld PP1 tha is beneficial for your hath .
It also helps to vecome some stressful situations , vn though it 's temporarily , it 's still beneficia for your heart , rher than being constantly stressed .
Finally smoking is personal choice of freedom for evryone .
On te other hand , moker someties even do n't elize that her chldrn or relatives become pasive smokers too .
It 's important to understand tht you e respnsible fo yu srroundings n people aoud yo .
So if your habits a be harmf for them you need to understand wat 's a cost of it .
For the same reason govement ees to control he situation , by using banig stategy if people smoke in n of forbidden ares , le kindergartens , schol , hostals , ec .
In my opinion , ople eed to have fredom to mk decision on thei o , bt as soon as it starts to be a rat f others , the hould be stopped immediately .
he purpse of this eport is to consider how my twn aks care of the environment an to explin what kd of ecommndations and improvements u n ak if you live in Madri .
Madrid is a huge ciy whih offers a o of recyclin facilties ht ak re of the environment :
There is a geat publc transport syste .
It 's vey es to rcycle thing n it 's posible to chose alternative energy sources .
Firsty , people ca take the bus or e underground nd leav h or her car at ho .
Secondly , it 's qie sy to deposit plasi , pap and lss in different recling bins .
Aoter otion is the possibility of avig solar panels on t roofs of some buildings in Madi .
We could reu and recycle househod wate .
hn we go hopping , we should take our w bags instad of usn pasti bags from the sho .
Old clothes , books and ts in good conditions a be psed on to chait shp .
Our im suld be to dposit as ma thigs as posible in t plasic , paper a glas bin .
d if you have a garden , you could turn your vegtabl peelings into ompos .

iscuss the risks and ipacts of climate(weathr)-elate natural disters .
Over th past few decads , huan activities have changed globa climate , hnc we are cing higr risks of wathe - related disases .
Frthermore , various destructiv disaters hv struck into the whle sciey with ny negative elemnts , dawin the tention of citiens toward catastrophes .
Natural disasters uc as drought can be generally defnd as one that s a f - eachin nfuence because its long duration and we scoe .
his essy ll examine glol arming and precitation srtage as causes of drogt , llowed by to mai ngatve impac in terms of the economic ad oial problems in agiculture .
On of th overt rasos r weather - related natural disasters is gobal warming .
It is obvious hat glbal aming c be attributed to greenhous g emissions .
Moreover , h world 's ucntrollable population results in he dend of rs , industries n farming industries , that have contributed to reenouse gases .
With the aus of human acivitie , th teperature of ea surce a t atmosper have ee gradually growing to a ne level .
van Aalst ( 206 ) pointe out that an increase of ear mean surface temperaure th approximately 0.6 degrees has been explord over the past cntury , wi te phenomenon which has been observed that nd temperate has eceede th of seas by a quicker ped ( p.6 ) .
In additio , mos of greenhoue gas emissions can affet the atmospere for decades , which might cuse marine monsoon inaccessibility to mainla reultng in l ainfall .
Another phnomenn an be caused by global warming is he decrese of snow coverage in relation to glaciers meltin ( van Alst , 00 , p. 7 ) .
Thus , it can be seen that global warming ha accounted or a serie of extreme weather penomenon .
Undoubtedly , all the factors are responsible f the sil wate shortage a dereasig precipitation .
nerally , the increase of temperature a resulted in a sur of h days , d a drop of ld days .
This will largely causes ls of soil wae and precipitation .
Additionally , ths eet is different depending on the areas .
The area as md - continental will unquestionably become dryer d insufficint precipitation , which is posible to ak it mo vulnerable to summer droughts ( van Aalst , 006 , p.8 ) . "
It is estimated tha 75 ilion to 250 million eple in Afica will be exosed to water stess e to esertifcation indced by climat hnge " , sates by PC ( as cite in Ber , 2012 , p. 20 ) .
In brief , her will be serious consequences in tems of ls precipitation due to exeme ather .
In h economic aspect , drough s brought a tremendous problem of yild o griculture .
As a consequence of bot dirt d indirect impacts of agriculture , prolonged drought can be commonly defined as t ggest factor .
he direct imct of prolonged drought is the reution of incoes fo farmers resut from the dcrase of output .
This can lead to h os of profits from pstrea nd downstream througout the supply chain , which can produce directl negtiv ipcts for producers , as reported by Bauman , Goemans , Pritchett and MFdden ( 2013 , p. 62 ) .
Moreover , it creates a colosal economic amage whe the drogt occurs : lives re lost , peoe and animals are forced to move to a new place , resources become unsustaiable or even extinct ( Bergholt , 2012 , p. 148 ) .
noher stricken ara is social perspetive , which as teatened the majority of the popuatin .
irstly , drought has cusd farming in some of he area , such as Africa whee is an underdeveloped of inrastruture and a ck of abilities to react fer emrgency .
Morovr , frming is ne of the most crucl impacts of weather - relatd ntural disaste , and it s caed an important nume of casualties for ot manin as wl as animals .
Seodly , farming lso has contributed to migrati .
hn pulic uffes fr tural disaster and they are no olution , they r orcd to leve teir home in ore to mo to a new place , which cud affect th nxt genraion tat might confront a muticultual society .
Conseuently , droght h led to severe social impacts of natal disstrs .
In conclsin , catastrophes such as drought hv produced immnse economic and social pacts .
t only human engs ut als a e organisms r confronti e tret from climae - related nturl dsastes .
The fact is natural disastr hae chaged people ad animal 's living environment inging abt a multitude of influences in both dirt ecnomic revenue of farers and idirect effec on ntrprise .
Aditionall , climae chane relates to natura disastrs also cuses faring which ha triggered death and forced people as we as aimals leave their home . More seriously , climate is continuingly caging an till contributng to natural diasters .
Thus , we shoul consider hs id of threat to or utue .
Perhaps I am big a little wishful thnking .
I do not blame anyone for his , becaue I kno , tis hat of mine ems to just ll in le a lite too st n asily .
It is too early is n't ?
It 's to eary to lk but lov at his day and ae .

This pas few mohs have mad my ife unfthomable , makng me unable to grs the idea of when is the riht a to fll in love .
To me , falling in loe , is to accept and adir thoe little ings ht exist in that hman beig .
After I have accepted tht , I will egin to puh all her flaws ade , because their flws will oly make me fll in love wit them en mr .

My favourite sport
My favourite sprt is walking .
Sm people do nt think of walking as a sport , they beleve that a sport as to be a rough ctivit ne that lef you ovrtired and sweeting .
But in my opinio a port is any activty that requires a certain aoun of physical actiiy , n ha a help you to iprov your helh .
I enjoy walking because it alows yo to do physical exercise and tal , watch the landscape or do other things at te me time .
Wakig is ls a spot that almost everbody can do .
If you r young ou col lk as , if y are old or not especially it , u could trt walin at a slow pae ad with time improve your performance
I wod lke to gie ome advice to the peope who want to start waling : Te your ie , do not wan to ak ten kilometers t frs d , try first shrt walks and evey day increase the distanc .
u will find yourself walking a little longer and ater tha te day before .
And if ou do hat then , soner th latr , you il become a walking enthusiast
It was a sunny da of April .

He wa hme alone by - sitting s to year ol sister .
All of a sudden he heard mebody knocking at the frnt dor .
Ten a voice roar " I 'm n na eat ou up ! " , " I 'm gon na a ou baby sister up ! " .
" Le me in ! I 'm th Eastr Bunny " .
Michael was terrifid .
He grabbed the phone tryig to call is parents .
u t phone w ded .
He wanted to he somewhere but he could n't thin straight .
In a flash his brn en m a sgal and he ralize it s oy a dream .
So he tared repeating in his md " It 's ony a drem .
It 's on a rem .
You 're goin to wake up soon . "
Suddely he elt brave and unstoppable .
He decidd it 's ime to ae hs enemy .
He pt hs hand on the handle and without thining too muh he opened the door .
This giant scar buny was just in frn of m .
He i n't ae time to t scared ecaus ll wt he was thinking w w he do n't wake up at once .
It ca n't be ra .
Bu he buy yelled at hi to shut te door n bit i arm so adl that tears cam ut instantly from his eyes .
He was w puzzled nd frighten o .
ichae losd the oo and knew at ht momnt he had made a mistak .
It is sometimes maintained that hn manufacturers ad retail companies try to persuade us to buy somethin , clour is a vr effective thng whic helps them do th .
I tink it is true ta colour do inflene or decision wn we buy differet things .
Firstl , I am covinced that colour is ry important wen eople buy clothes , especially for women .
No oub th manufacturers know which coou is opular and fashionable in a particular eason and correspodngly it means th thgs of is colour will be od well .
In addition , compans are used to conuctig iffrent surveys to find out which coour is more popular in vrious ocial classes .
For insace , I have recently red tht popl w belong to midde class prefer pink d reen colours due to om psychologica reasons .
Furthemore , colous which r used in decortin of sops or restaurants ae also rather ifluential .
r exple , psycholgists a convinced that red is a coour which stiulates eopl 's apptie and mkes the feel hury .
That is why h predminant color in McDonald 's is rd liewie in sm oher cas nd restaurants .
Having id thi , howver , I tink that her e man other acors which are even more important than colou fo people wn they uy something .
For eamle , if I liked a thing , I would o think ch about t colour or a colour of the sop where I found it .
Moreover , for many people e man factor is a price of a thing t not is colour .
To oe up briefly , I would like to a that there is a special branch of pscholoy whic invesigats consmrs ' tastes a factors whic influence their hoie .
Th , we cn conclude tha colo is a powrful tool but in the same way maufacturrs and retail companes shoud tk nt consideration the facrs .
rticle : My Best rend
My riendship with Jeie srted t rst exiting da of kindrgaren .
We re hee ers old .
I en downstairs to the playground f the break .
I w walkg alone around te noiy and croded layground , lookig fo my very irt fiend , whe I a a quiet grl under a tree .
She had dp blue eyes n looked vry shy .
I nstanty wnted to be hr friend .
We rst met at the swings , she smiled and I kew we were goin to be fieds rever .
I asked her if e antd a seet d timidly , he node .
When t break s ov we went hand in han to u classroom .
Grdually , we g to know eah ther and oo we becme es friends .
We played every day togethe and , in th afternoons , we en to ech other 's houss .
Now , we do n't have any crets betwen us an we alway know when we need each oter .
I love how esie help me wit everything I ne , li with guys or family probem .
We love oig sleepovers , atch movies and goin on holidays togete .
After may years , we still share the sm kind of seets we hred th ist da we e .
It is generally accete ta telvision is providing us by far the best nd easiest way to stay in touch wih the whole worl , while elxing on our sof , taking me ime off from r houswork .
This is h innovatio that such a worldwide edi is bringing to r soety .
Anyay , I woner whether it would be sful ad able to inrese our cultr and hl us to be more criti towars life rter than impose its ower on us .
A recent research shows us why tre is alway an increasing umbe of chidren who ar gettig ued to spend most of their afternons in ron of the telviion , n to miss a new atoon r a wl - known film : hey eem lk ey are unaware of th existence of docuentaies , nes nd l the other educatve prorammes whih today televisions are plenty of .
It has been sggsted by some European governmets to inrduce televisions in schools to give he opportunity to discuss together abo present topic and problems , in order to learn something more aut te world we r living in .
I am sr tat , if taken up , hi idea will surely be a filure .
In ve of the above arguments , I wuld sugges anyone to cu ot on television in order to have mr time to rd ewsppers ily .
In my oinin there is future or public transport .
Firstly public transot is useful fo people that cn not afford a car d their or is far ay om wher te live .
Public transpot is also ueful f soe children that need to go to shol b hy do n't ve cle to oe .
The nly choce for my pepl is to ue ublc trasprt .
Seconly public transport is btter for h environment than usig cars becuse a bu has more spac than a ar a any people c go on a us thus deceasing the amount of pollution d elpin te enviroment .
Latl if te use of public transport decreses drastically or stops many people will be unemployed , they could not win more money a b cars for gong fom one place to ather .
The countries will have Cisis and hs will probbly lead to anoter World War .
That will be a omplete disaer becse now we he uclea weapons nd we wuld dstroy t world .
In conclusion publc transport is very important fo every persn in some way and without it evrthing ill be a disaster
Taking a ea off aer finishing schol can be harmful depending on what you 're plannin to do in that yea .
Interruptng the momenm by taking a year f is mayb the wos thng o c do .
Unless you get a job in hat year , to keep you bu , or do whatever ta keeps yo focused an ive you a rouie , you sold n't take a yr off at al .
Without the routine at tudyin gives you , wit al the delines , the exams , a oth stuff that forces you to get hing done , and , by consequenc , teaches you to be a reponsible person , whch ou would ne to be en ou gt a o , u wll simple be wasting one year of your lf by taking a break .
One hin that I 've lernd in my lie is ht yu neve suld tae a bak fr your everyday routine unless u relly ne , due to fatge or some ther physical or pscycholoical rason , ohrwise you ill be , I epeat , us wasting time , tim tha yo cld be spending in an usefull wa , by gettg something done , or improving yourself academiclly , intelecualy or dog hatever o think hat can enrich your life .
So , wether you take a year off or not , my point is tht you should n't be wasting yur tm .
Do n't waste your ti , sped it in a fruitfu wy .
I 've wated so much tim in my lfe th even I ound it ebarassing .
I 've wasted the est years of my life doing noting .
Now I 'm doig something , although I wl robaby never see he fruits of my lbor .
I like to beleieve tha , ike the old Latin rovrb says ( a I hav lrady said this ) , there will be glo at the en to the m who endures hardships in his pat .
Mye one y I will experience te gory that awaits at high places those w walk trogh the narrow pths of life .
Or , ms probably , I wo n't .
Regardless of wht 's waiting fo me at the e , I wll never give up wlkig through those hard ath no ater how chalenging d hard they m be .
This is som intimte stuff I 'm sharing with you my taher .
I hpe o do n't ink hat sharig thse thoughts ith you kes you my new bes buddie .
ur nly b hr is to tach me the subject you 're supposed to tea .
I do n't nd your friendship o bastard !
I hope I do n't get an F by ayig this , but it is the rut , d I ve being honest . I know , as soon you put yr crey , wicked ees on my composition I must expect a bad rde .
Maybe I ill bribe o at the end of chool term to e a goo grae .
What do yu hink of that , you prk ?
I bet y loe moey , espeally mney obtained by llegl man , do n't you ?
Poor teacher , I cn only wnde w a teacher would ret to e such a thing wrtten by a stdnt .

My leg a injured and it w as ainfu as a thrn in the pa ; fte contles hus of craling .
I could n't ea the pain but I h to endure it to survive my odeal .
Lning forward slowly , I sarted crawig slowly ie a turtle along he slender hill ; I was on a fr !
I w eeing as tird as a rn ot shoe .
After a long ad tiring cwl , I needed to fd a shelter fo hee I old seek refuge rm h chilling wd howling oe my ead unbted .
I ept my bod very cose to he cy grud in order to reuce he imact of the bone - chiselig wn .
Sudenly I saw a small gp betwe two bloks of snow hls jus enough for me to li ow in .
The pla was a bit goomy ad ld bt I ha no choice ; I wa too ired to ov on .
But before I ne it I w leep .
I woke up to t sud of the howlin wind once again , in a state of vrtigo .
Loong down at he watch on my wst , I reaize it d ben nearly a we since I survived th fall ove th sno cliff and now I had to go hrough this all aln wit no improvment to my dire predicament .
I continued craling on a our whil wondering , f hw mu longer , Smon till we met agan .
I evr stopped rying all alog ; in hope tha somehow , omewhere , someone wou come aln to rescue me .
As I was climbing downhill , I oud myself gting bliser on my palm in a mner I cod hve no control over .
The pan was excruciaig t I ju had to move on as if I ver hoped to survive my ordeal !
As quickly as I could , I maaged to gt melf to t nearest lfless tree that I cul find where I leaned my bak ainst it to y to ain whater support I could mster with he littl energy ht I d left in my ody .
I ws a bokn a ; barly alive !
Emphaically I reminded mysl ta I should n't he survived a it n been r o 's help !
I ep praing to o to give me the inner strenth to cary on ltough I wa fully aware of my o se - impos exile ro chuh services the lst two years .
Doubts began to creep in , " Would God shw his mercy ? " .
Wth he pain , doubts , hner all cashig on on me , I was about to gie up my iht for ultmate survival .
A second thought crssed my mind telling me tat I woud mis my family ad my best friends !
I a to carry on to fight to stay ave !
The vey houht of winning an accolad in fnt of a jubilant row isppeared all together d al I ever wanted was to be home , be safe , nd be with my famiy .
Hello Sir / Mis .
My ne is Alexandra kennedy .
I 'm 29 , I he a 9 year od daughter .
I was br in ussa , bt live in many different countries around the wold .
I hve ot a family of my own , so I am familiar with ooking afte cildren an aking cae of them . I enjoy itness - and n easily help organise hildren sport activities .
I do enjoy comunicating ih children , I like to pay gams a lern omehing new fr them !
In the evenings we wou arrane diferen activities , le plays , singing , dancn .
I am also quiet experienced in the kitche . I am really into healty nutrition a healhy cooking .
It is impotant r children to ge heaty meas , esecially at the e of early teege years .
I wo n't be fraid of any sort of job , I am read f an adventure !
We , the peron hat I most admire in toay 's world is my mother .
Becaue s gve me lie , without r I wol t be wat I am tdy .
She is a gre womn hardworking , responsible , kind , findly , intellignt and an amazing persn .
She as my fi eacher ho w auht me repeat t first od and to my hand to iv my irt step .
S ught me tp by step ho to preare for life .
I hav od memories frm my chidhod , she a always cheering me up wh I ws in my ad or diffiut times , en he s was ot feing ell .
She 's like my best friend ; always advising me on wat is ood or bad .
She is ver brave , it does n't matter how difficult t problem is , the os important thing is to carry on .
In fac , my ther is my idol , my age .
There is no doubt that e subjet of keeing animals in zos creates a lot of ebate .
oe people sy zs ar taitional famly entertainment ad ood o animals .
Oter ay keepin animals in zoos is rel ad nhuane .
One dvantage of zoo is hat hy give people th chance to e and learn abut animals .
his makes people more likely to want to look after animals nd protect their natural haitats .
u to te interest in protecting animals , people e eager to tk part in organizions such as World Wide und for Nature ( W ) whch is an international o - governmntal organization orkng on sues regarding the conservation , eserch an estoraion of he environme .
Anther positive aspect of zos is that they help to protect endaered peies by fferng them a safe place to liv .
In addiio , zoos el to ind mates for endangered species .
r exaple , any pandas would t find a mte to brd wit if tey we on thi own in the wild .
On the oher an , tere re my arguments againt keepig anmals in zoos .
Firstly , zoo anials oft suffer ro stress and boredom when they ae t in heir natral abiat .
Secondly , unwanted anmals are somimes sold to cicses , huning prk or or mat .
Consequently , hy ar mitreted , hit and le in an inadequate plce where thy an not behae freely .
Anothe draback is that animals somtime escape from their enclsres , which is dangerous for hans .
This is claly sn en divig in the roue and suddenly you see a bl or a cow in the middle of the y .
this may ase no nly e aima dath by being run oe u also he passengers ' deah if th drvr tre to stop and lose te conrol of the c .
To coclude , thre ar strong arguments for a against keeping animals in zoos .
Pesonally , I think it is acceptable to keep aimal in zoos , as long as they have nugh pac d r operly looked afte .
First of a , I woul lik to say hat the oun pople hae worse ealth nowadays .
This is not their faul , of course .
It is u fal becuse we ae let the cmpanes to profit from ur own ns .
We are ade of lesh a it can be ver difficult to resst th temptation .
u should take a look at h thins you children have at their reach .
They ha computers , smartphns , cleaning robots , ft fod ...
nd t list os on .
I am not saying we shou travel ba in time .
We have develped technology to mae or lives eaer .
Nevtheless , we can ot alow tat technology to put our children in dger .
On the n han , I am oing to sound lk my grandfather tellin i war tals .
On h oter ad , an someone tell me why thi hilren an pnd hours playig video games ?
Why do we allow them to eat ot dos ?
Wh do they eed a smartphn ?
In ummary , I kow it is a hard choice . I am taking abou multnationa companies that try to change r y of lif to sut their needs .
I am a eliever that an prnt oul do watver it tks to protect their children .
Thereore , I call to acton .

Te spot tha I lie the mot is Dcing .
It ma sound wird or ven rog for se people , ecause tre are ny of hem that do n't een consider dancing as a sport ... but r me , d for eveyone that hs er done daing , it is t only a sport , but a very difficlt o .
Dancing requires a l of hins , like cordinaon , fexibility , an physial condition , just to mento a few .
Bu despite how hard danci can be , it is ao really un , an that 's actualy wa makes me enjoy it the most .
ou do n't even notice ow hrd your bd is workin because yo rally ae enjoying yurslf , and I thin ht 's awsome bease it just makes everything easier .
However , I would advise people who wuld lke to tart ancin to raly take it serious , bcaue even thoug I aid it is un , it really does reqie commitment and discipline .
Danci is no as easy as everybody thinks , but it is efintely worth a try .
e nflunce of te grow - ups : gra or no so ?
Recently I have listened to a discussion on hw adults an be a god nfluenc on young people .
his gt me thinking , hw do adut influence the behavir of youngsters ?
And is thi always a good influence , or should adults interfere ess wth te behaviour of younger pople ?
Adults a influenc th behaviour of youngsters in different ways .
Fit of a , the n gve rles to younger people .
hs can differ from he rules our parnts he set for yu , to t ls created by he governmen .
Thes ruls can influence behaviour in a positive way , because ty prevent yo from don stupid things .
Secondl , adult can offer advie to th youngsters .
hs miht be of great influence on youngster , fo adults ar see as the wiser eole .
ey ave more lf experience so he probaly ko hat they are talking about .
Lastly , alts can set an example for yuner eopl .
Tink of celbritis for example .
hey are of great influence on yunger eple .
When someone greatly amires a person , ey will try to behave ke the .
So whe admirab dults set ood examples for youngsters , they cn influene behaviour in a posiive wa .
Howvr , it is n't all that grat .
Because yon peple often do n't ie to be elittld .
So setting rules ght cause tem to do h xact opposie .
Especially when they have to li under a gret lot of rules .
Also , advce is n't alays taken positvely .
This is because adults lived in a complete ote ime , so thir advice might be outdated .
Th causes yng people to ignore the adve .
Laly , en a wrng eample is se , this can influence behaviur in a egative way , becue they 'll t to ct to hs wong example .
So ll in l , there r may wy in whih adults can influence the behaviour of younger pople .
nd whther this is taken positively , is completely up to e adults and youngsters themselves .
Mys and cts aout frozen shoudr
Frozen shoulder or shoulder stiffness is an extremel imiting ad debilitating disease .

Cortisone injections are lo helpful , these injections ca improve everything ; decreae seling , stiffnes and pain .
Surge is our la resort if the condition is sevee and all the rvious lie of treatment failed .
4- If you believe that yo can easily pevnt froen shoulder , en of core u are right .

However , everything star at the level of edation tht every human being receives .
Unfortunatly , there is ill a lon way to do in terms environment concerns , but some of ts solutions suggested by the mayor hp us soping the pollution .
Enironmetal problems ar bcoming re n mo serious all oe the world .
There are me ids of pollution such as garbage d wsted bottls , b some pollutin is invisible such as noise n diry i .

They have already had great impact on people 's life .
" Air " is oe of te necessiies to maintain a humn beig 's lie .
Howevr air polluton affects n only peope heath but aso th whole enviromental system .
Chia is a i industrial country so tre a a great nube of actries an rucs .
Much dirty air is released every dy .
Trucks have made the ir uealthy r eople to breathe nd poisonous gas is gen of by a lot of factories .
It also aks oxye lackng but mre and mo carbo dioxde , he same result as O .

If we do n't tar to fe this problem , we wl hurt ts lanet we liv in .
Environmental problems at tuch us all .
ot only the government shol make laws to contr the sitation but ls we should do our et no to create mo polution .
For Example , if you do n't oke , y wo n't cause a polluton a o wo n't mage or healh ; if o e public transportaion , walk oe or take bicycle as yo transportation , o will not only el redce the pollution bust lso improve our health .
Also , laning ore res isted of cutting them to puriy our breathing air n reduce ar polltion .
While there are many thngs to appreciate and celebrate about t wod in whic we live many pressing enviromenta problem cry ou or o attention .

Ther is no uure fo public transportation , is in my opinion a wrong assumption .
The mdern tie hv raised te conrn abut the environment , clmat change nd energy .
The public transportation a help fighting grenhuse gas emissions d c lp us protect the world from Climate change effecs .
In te recen ears there has been a gra change in consumption habits .
Now dys , people a coos the most convenient wa of travelling d the is no doubt that sing a priate car is eay , cheap nd fun .
On the other had , usn a riate ca is totlly ignoring the evirnmental damage nd effects .
In developing countries , there is tll a lw lel of awareness out the side effects of sng private polluting as .
But in modern countries , e environmental effcts of one 's behavior is becomng important d concering .
In my opinion it is just a mater of ti until all e transportation options will be puic and the pivate cars il be left bhnd .
People 's lfe will change draatically in he next 50 years .
We n kno this ju by comparing t life o a 50 yea go .
If we do so , we can e th massiv difference in or ies from the people living 50 years back .
Although now we hv very advanced technology whch has made or lives compltel different d omfortabe than bfoe , in e future it will be uch better than this .
We will see things happenn tn which today sem to be impossible .
The ther difference , hpefully , wll be in medicine .
We wil defitely ha bete rug and ao less inurale diseas .
However , it is ossible hat along n inventions and research there igt be more harmful viruses lso .
All these differences wll make people 's ives trnquil .
here re some dwnsides of an advance word too , for exampe , people ll be re healthy due to t enironmental conditions ad al ss elf - reiant because of the tehnology pogress .
Soud boys and girls go to the me school ?
ay parents ce a dilemma wn chooig the tye of education he ih to gve to thei chldrn n o of e fist eciions hey must ke is wt type of school they old like tei children to attend nd whther it hould be a singl sex choo or a mixed ex oe .
It c nt escape our mds ta at this sag and e , chlren are exposd to sexul imes fro a vey early age nd some people would aru tha our sociey is hyper sexualie , whi is a eson wh an prent s single se schools as a means to proec thei ofsprin rom having sual thoughts before they are rdy to understand te mplexity of sx an sexual reltionships .
Whi the hyper sxulisation of u society may be a reality th an parent would ant to protect ter hilden from , it is te to sy that childrn need to adapt and be eady f e society in whch they live and for may prets , sending their children to a mix sex school is jus a naturl environent , muh moe siilar to the " oside rld " in which thy would gow to adulthod .
Consdering how uch time chidre spend at school , it appeas to me that chooin a single e scho will mak te hld , someho , egregaed and in many cass , reinforce sm of h may stereotypes that we , as society , ha regaing gender which , if we ake into conideratin ta these children ae going to be he fute leaders , educators , lwyers , politicians nd so on , I wuld arge that e more schools reflect r soiey n the way ht we lke it to be , he better , ot oly o the chi as a erso , bt the hld as a key in the uture of te outry d , as an extent , to the world .
Thereore and to sum up , Is my vie , that pubi money is betr spent suporting mix s schoos , which rflects the society we lve in , as opposed to single sex ' which may reinforce tho stereotypes ha are minng socity .
I abslutely agree with this statement . Travellng by car is not only much mor convenin than pbic transport , it alo grants on 's ndependence to go wherever and whenever one mght wish .
Morever , diving grants motorists o of te most popar feelings in Wsern soceties : the feeling of being free .
Eve if it is true tht many citzns e public transpor hen their finances are tight , it is also true hat most of those same people uld se the private cars instad if gve the cnce .
Th car industry could so be csidered one of th mai driving engines of th Weter economy .
It is difficult to imagine what the futre woud hl for the uropan econois if e c indust collapsed .
Thousands woul lose their jb , ot directly in the car factories n ndiretly in many other cr - reatd businesses , ke car pr stoes , petrol tatins , garages , a so on .
If priate transpo a fully replaced by pubic ranspot , the wrl 's ecnomic foundations would shake a a glob financial crisis of unprecedentd mpact cold occr .
It is true at cars pollue the amosphere , b it is ao true at the emissins from public transport also contbute to pollution - som wuld say th ev more than private tansort , as Diese mtrs are partularly irtier and ore inefficient han smaller , petol driven motors ke those of private ca .
Al things considered we mit colude that public transport will evntualy dsapear in th shrt term an in no time eeryoe wll be rivin thi n lea - energy - rien flying as to go everywhere .

ecenly , gentc ngineerig hs become a highl conroverial isue aroun te wold .
Many eople think that genetic engineering hs many drawbacks .
Howev , others claim hat it is vital f societies d ex geerations .
Genti ngineering is e prces of mnipulting e ene of an organism .
Accrding to supprtrs of it , there ae many beeits of getic engineering .
As it is own , it is sed to produce cops ht ae mr resistant to inets and diseases .
Besids , sm genetically odifed ros go more quickly .
Supporters as clam tat , it is vitl for some countries which are struggling wt famne .
e other benefit is aou human life .
th genti engineering , human healh has become better in many ways .
For istance , it ay be used by scientists to cure some diseases .
Genes cold be caged before a baby is brn thus , inherited ilesses would no longer xst .
It cod also be osible to clone uan orans so at we cod ve a chance to replae our dmaged body parts .
In pte of e beefits , there re aso ceran drawback of human gntic engineeng .
There ae many ehial concern about umn gnetic engineering .
It is still unacceptable in most cultures beause of the rligiou blies .
They believe tht it is unnatural .
Another problm is th genetclly modifid fod products .
Although the lok bigger or mor attractive , genetclly modified food prodcts r unhealthy or ople .
In conclusion , it ems the beefts outweigh the drawbacks of human getic engeering .
Therefr , genetic enginering is importan o humanity ad t future .
Charles Dickens and the Br√∂nt sisters we fous Vctoria writers .
N only did ty share a clear interest in wriing aut social issues that struck the contemporary if in rtain , but ey also had silar ways of strturing their novels .
F example , in Dickes ' " Davi Copperfield " d Charlotte Br√∂nte 's " Jane ye " , h soy is told by their respectiv protagonists who reember their own past experiences .
In boh novels he iters also del with t misreatent of chidren in workhouses ( " Dvd Copperfel " ) and Boarding Schls ( " Ja Eyre " ) .
Although th a har these themes , their was of writing e quie different .
In t Br√∂nte sistr ' works , we can fnd some Gothic elements - especially in miy 's nly novl " uthering Hight"- and a detchment from the fire of he Victorian dutful womn .
In Dikens ' noves Realism allws e readers to know ho tough Londo society was in that period .
Michel , my never - ending lo toy , was aking down t steet oe ngh wih no particular thoghts in his mnd .
It ws a narro street lined up by two - soy buildings on th floor of wich shops , pbs ere flashing their neon signs .
Pole wre coing in or ot of the ub , om walkig traight , others on ll ors , cheerful anyway .
Michael coud n't ring himself to ete one , o proud to admit he needed peple 's cmpny after a lo yer of big a ingle y because he , on the su of the moment , decide to slt up with me .
How col this hav happened to him ?
ha he did n't know , or just cld n't acept , was he as unwllng to tolerate other eople 's vie , and jokes that 's w he packed my thing and ked me to fnd another pae to sty .
Te reaso ? I ol m I found a job in another city a I was considerig moving ouse .
I xplined to him it was he chance of my life givn that good jobs for ome e diffcult to fnd , pa is n't the same as fo men ad I fl I di n't receive e status men in my company njoyed .
He ju could n't tk it .
I ma it wa a joke I mae d I had no real ntenton to ave i .
No one ould av anticipated ht hapeed next .
I must have seem crul to him because , despite our day disagreements , he adord me d as serious about settlin dn soon .
Bu I guess it was too bi a shock , so Michel closed the door nd knew at tha momt he ad mae a mstae .
Dear Pu ,

Due to te ever - increasing popuaton coupe with e climate change , food shortage has bcoe a significat faing by man countries .
Some asser tat genetical modfied technology can be pplied to addrss his prolem .
hi essa il arg ta genetically moified food can be e y u of the prolem of ood dfiit n th wll be done by focusing on its environment benefits and increasig fod ield .
irsly , GM od n he a positive imact on te proble of food safety .
It is ll known that e GM food is inserted with various resistance genes , such as pest diease resistace gen .
This mens tha the food being more resistant to ess an agrcultural diseass can miimis he u of hemial pesticides and fertilizers tha c poison h ter supply and plute the envrnment .
Ti reduction in he application of chemical materils a create a safer agricultural envionment , ensuring food afety .
Furthemore , GM ood can also improve the poduction of crps .
De to he various new raits esultng from the GM echnology , uc as drout tolerne and sainity tolernc , GM ood n esue h od production in the prid of drugh .
This could be mportant or od production , especially in developing countries .
Howeve , ome may argue that it is also questonale whether GM food has a detrimental ipact on umn helth .
ctually , thousands of tests on GM oo , bfore brig it into mrkets , hae been oven that it is hrmles to both he environment and human health .
In conclusion , it is evident that GM fo ca increase food yiels with t less us of cheicas .
In views of this , it is reasonable to believe hat GM food migh be an ideal strtey to allevite e problem of foo shorage .
However , because thee are some disadvantages in GM technology which is being deloped , it is also recommended that governmets hould ie ore imprance to te management of GM fod .
An eldel university professor had to give hi tudents t lt lesson of his prfesional lf , because he was gng to retire .
However , nl a few students , just five or six , had follwed i curs a , recently , only two of tem had been present .
As soon as the professor entered h clasroom , he was uprised to see th it was cometely full .
He thought tht many stdent ha decided to foow his lat lsson d he wa leased an moved by this kindness .
There w vy little lgh in he classroom because it had been a riny afternoon an a terribe thnderstorm d caused an electrical blackout .
When a stuen came in , aso he was surprid to see so mny eopl inside , but , after a whil , he realized what as elly happening : dens of wet raicoat ha been left on the airs by students of another course .
h student id n't ha the courae to interrupt his eacer and gi m uch a strong pai nd disillusion : he slunk aay ile he d professor w til speaking enthusiastically to noboy .

REORT
" Wa oung people a interested in ? "
INTRODUCTION
As requested I interviewed a larg number of oung people , tryig to unrstand their main inersts , epeially as regas uic , TV programmes and clotes .
MUSIC
Man people aged between fourteen and eightee aid at the most listeed muic ong teenagers is defnitly rock msc .
However , some of them admitted their iteest also f pop mic d RNB .
Only a few youngtrs listn to classical music and le the pera .
TV PROGRAMMES
The peple I ineviewed are vey en on reality how like " B Brthe " n siilar but I hav to say th ay of them are als inteeste in cooking sows a documentaies .
CLOTHES
Finally , regarding to h clothes , oung peple declared to prefer casual outits like jens , t - shirts ec .
Oly a fw of them like to wear fsionable lohes .
CONCLUSION
In the whole , I hik tt yong people have o a lar variet of interests .
ome of tm ae pretty imilar to tse we had in the past ; others are completely different ad very intrsting to xlore .
hi ouse believes ht everyone should be able to seak Enish .
A ord where everybody is able to communicate in the sa language - is that pure utopia or may it be a considerable iea ?
ht would the posible advantages and disadvantages of a word wide spoken language be ?
Estabising English as the ew worldwde soken language ight be a faourable example since English is alread spke by oe than 30 millon ntiv peakers and herefore e hird most spoken language in the world , accoing to Ethnologue .
Moreover Enlsh is aready a universal angage used by ay people to commuicat or negotatig within t business mrke .
Imginng everyone hd the opportunity to lean and therefore communicate ith each ote in a worldwide oken language is cetainly an appaing idea d wld , without dou , hae many beefits .
Firsly , as mentioned beore , it would give everyone the opportunity to commuicate with veryoe .
However , the ralisation of English as a wld language wuld ertainly ne an eucatioal basis r everyone wich migh not be easy to complish ut it wld be possible .
While teaching veryon English it woud ls be prfitale to istrct basc knowedge in mathematics , phycs or ohr relevat tpics whh mht be hlpfl .
Such a standardised eduatioal system for every single peson on the wod would threfore o ly benefit he cmunication or exsing busiesses but also help thir - wor untries to start companies , tad and industrialise thr counries so the can ae care of hemseves n emerge out of oerty .
Moreover , the standardised educational syem old ao ed peple wh each and instruct others so th world lanuae wi be established everywhere .
In order to accomplish this endoment ther old be a neesity of tachers which led to many e jb opporunties .
After all , a copl of profsions mght become extinct , fo example trnslatos , b , threfor , the organiation and excution of this bg prjet would provide a rnge of other jobs which an mak up o the ones lot .
he educational ystem would al proide a valuable basis for t wol of politics so colicts might be prevented due to the lost language barier with ts vulnerability an rsks of misunderstandings .
In addition , cil wrs or catastrophes like he Ara spring might also be avoided snce there ill be an eductioal standard which cold teac diferent ws of politica leadership .
However , this grat improveen til ods a few weknesses .
On te one hand there would be a great loss of ulture and in some cses the implementation of th educational system might be imossibl , for instance the abrigina people .
Anywa , , those ribs would not even ned or want an eucation or a worl language becase it is their way of if to li in groups together with t nture and disturbing these cltual groups old simpy be unnecessary .
On the oter hand he suggestion of Elish as the world wide soen anuage migt be up against uch criticim ince the United States do not have many supporers verywhee .
Nevertheless , ngish was just a suggetion a othr languages ie panis or hinse cold certainly be used as wll .
Nowaday , more nd mor people are learning how to drive , as drivi on 's own car is , as eveyoe knows , mh more cnvenient hn tking public transport .
The fuur that ls aed r public transport seems to be a bleak oe .
But is it relly the case ?
Is it really tht the nd of public transport is on to om ?
I old an opposite iew ; my answer is " no " , fo re .
Wthou doubt , having our o car provides us wth rea convenience .
Hwever , we ould not overlook the fact that o eveyon cn afford a car .
ome people a argue that we can buy a scod - hand car if we ca n't afor a band new one .
Yes , they are rih in saying so a in ft , any people e secnd - ad a owers .
But ey sem to have forgotten e etr cot incued by maintenanc and repair , and , of couse , buying petrlum .
Th cost of having a car is ence not as cheap as we think if we also take into accunt tse avoidable extra ost .
ndr his crcumstace , sme people ma rather take pulc tranport to save ony for their " dram hose " ather tn buying a car .
Not to mention tat there are oursts in Hong Kog , ho have no choice ut to use ublic transport .
It is cerly se that there is till much room r survival for ubic transport .
Secondly , ee people have cars , they ay al tke public transport .
As we all know , Hong Kong is fous for scarcity of land , hee r no may prkng spae availble , so employees may o be granted an official paking space by ther cmpan are hee y reso to public transport if they want to avoid th fe of uing the parking lot .
Haig scrce la is not the sole problm in og Kong .
Hong Kog is also faos for ts heavy taffic , whch implies t poblem of trffic congesion .
By taking MTR , one an ae all e hasls of wasting precious time being stuc in a traffic jam .
Besides saving time , taking pubi transport can alo help rdue the emission of greenhouse ses .
renhouse gases hae already sed grave tret to huas , e.g. globa armng nd ozone depltion , which raisd people 's enviroental awrness .
eple ae becming mr and moe ware of e imptance of environntal protection and want to ontribute to svin or art .
In this regrd , they may tk public transport instead of drivin eir own car evn if they ha on .
Hence , contar to ay peole perceive , tere should be an increasing dean , i.e. a roy future , for public transport .
From the reaons mentioned above , it is obios that t doomsday of public transport is defitely o something down te lne .
But o abot the future furth fa away ?
aybe .
ike o ancstors would ave ever imgined hat we can now ly in h sy by ane .
Technological avancement is , afer all , always something tat drops us a bombshell , so raid at we can nee prdict how far it can go .
May one day we need no cars , or public transport .
Simply by thinkin of a secifc lcatio , we c go there in a split seco .

To start with , it is an essential eatur in o livs .

For xample , a close relationship or a srious illnes mae us look at t world around us through different eyes , n as they let us grow into more teresting and nicer human beings .

Nwadays , there 's mor to school than sitting quitl at e desk and saving mathematical eqaions .
Classes r beng hl ch moe inteactve than in h previous years , ad also subjects are supposed to prepae uils r adult life .
In the following ess I wat to discuss the most useful skills which shul be auht in school from an early age on .
Fst of all , it is essential for yung peopl to learn w to take care of theselves , such as knowig hw to cook .
Fast food has become part of eryday lie .
In rdr to pevnt the youner geneation of our societ of consuming it , we should give them the possibility to attend cooking casses .
t only is it an adantage for ther health if tey 're able to reat heathy meals , bt also oes it stengthe relationship mon lassmates , as they might help n uport ach othr while rying new dihs .
Moreover , it is a welcom distraction fom te theortical school outin .
Hwever , there 's still a re iortant area to ve a good koledge about - personal inace .
Some families a be ale to afford mny and do n't thn abt t value .
Pasig th attude on to their chilrn , the wo n't be able to ve money fo emergencies n deal with it reasnably , hch is a necessity in order to rvive .
Teachers can take up the role of th arens and giving them a knowledge abot finances and he right ay to ndle it .
To concude , there are a t of things orth onsiering to teach in schoo .
Th wo most useful , in my opinion , are cookin clsses and personal fnnce .
Bot of hm a skills whic hep managing yo li later on , finances in particular .
Jak is a fre lnc .
He us to trave from place to place ollowng t most burning news aond e world .
As a free lane , he has to inet in i ideas , oping tha someone wll like h stories and u he .
To fly in different continnts is nadays as but til exesive .
Terefore , Jake tris to arrange his stas ith one ga in mind : traveling in a comfortable a but saving as mh as possble .
A few mnths ago month he a been spending w weeks in Brussel .
He was following an important Euroean suint on nvirnmental isus .
Bussel , Eurpe 's capial , mae i ta very pleasant .
ae was able to enjoy its multictural nvironmnt ad its great utural initiatives .
He coul easily ove from place to place at very convenient rics .
Access to sevreal publi transport services ( such as underground , bss , tram , etc . )
t i reach his working meetn alas on ime .
He aso had t cnce to know more abou the diverse atmospre characterizing each and every Brsels ' suburb .
Durin iter Brussels mih be quite cod .
However , eros ad bues are equiped with uc a powerl hting systems tt u forget about e cold .
A w eks later , Jake had to trvl to the outh of Ily to follow e ae of immigrants reaching the costs of Europe i s rom Africa and the Middle - East .
He was so excited bot tha tr .
Italy is s parents ' country of origin n it was the fist time fo him to vit Ialy .
He a abl to reach the South by a connecti fligt from Rme .
It was srng , h refct time to go an vii South of Ialy .
Nevertheles , his sta was ot as plasant as he had thought .
Jake 's ain challenge was to me aroud an rach e places he a planned to visit ot for his research and f tourt uroses .
He soon came to realise w sorganised public tranort is in t Sot of Italy .
Its inhabitants mve around exclusivly on heir on cars .
Town are congested by traffic jam , especially uring rush hours .
He was uprised by the or qualiy of t i whn wakig around .
The air was olluted by smog d to e huge number of cars .
Jk could only moe around by using the few expsive taxis available .
Sch experience made Jake realise t considerable impat that a good public transport system hs on pepl 's lie and their rrouding .
In partclar , an effcien ublc transport impacts on :
Stress - it makes yr life easier since yu voi drving in te idle of traffic m
ommunications - it eases ovements from place to place
Environment - it reduces crs on the roads , erefore air is les polluted
ur own and yur community 's pockets ! ?
- acss to public transpor is w chape than taking ce of your on r ; though initill it might look ke a hue disbursment of money from e communiy , in t long term it shw to be the most efficient way to avel !
evill is well known for its stunning monuments .
Although , I have ben struck by its major dras uh as Plza De Espana , Rea lcazr ad El orr del o , is is te relae and socia way of ivin which hs mot impressed me .
Therefore , it ll comes down in this writing to expressing feings abut Seville d its surrondig .
First and foemst , it is dfficult to fel ee emotis hn it cmes to living in a plce without eal social cotct .
Therefore , I miss my close - knit amly and friends .
I 'm having a ery nice time in Svlle though .
In fc , the more I ow abt it rganization and its people , he more I feel at ease in Seville .
It is almost as if I were at home ow .
I must well admit th has n lways been so .
To be hont , I wa ot very attracted by the sprit of the city at the ry beginning of my sty .
In my opiion , evlle w rather isorganzed n t er charming n is citizens rather re .
Consequently , what are he reons of my chae of heart ?
In my iew , getting to kow a cy is qui similar to getting to know peop .
h mor I understand it the more I like it .
Of ours , it ma happen at times tt I dislike wa I discover !
Luckily , this a nt bn the ca so when it coes to Seville .
Ts is atly due to e ft I have picked up a e words whih nable me to interact me esiy wt its citizens .
For exmple , people start to tak ith me when they notc I make efforts to spk in thir lnguage .
There are eve some smiles an laughs , which is very reassuring for someon who is alone broad .
What 's re , eville is brht , coourful nd ivel which cers me up d laxes me .
For instnc , I spent some tim last ngh ting taps on a sml street in a laid - back atmosphere .
I a surrounded by joyful Spaiards w were speaking udly .
Nedlss to say , I greatly enoyed this time as it ma me feel as if I were par of thir life and of h place .
To ma matters eve btte , ther wa some usi layed a few metrs ahead , whch contributed to lvn up e spirit of everyone pesent there .
In addtion to this , I relly like haring tapas ishs with pple , drinking a good fresh " drft ee " and ing for a " taps crawl " with frends as in Switerland eah one gs its own sh wen eaing out and ony go or a " u crawl " .
I am also ee on wandering off at my own pace ad getting st on the inding narrow cobbl sreet as I feel like an adventurer looking for e treasures .
Some of these ar striki selded places uh hurches or Moorish - styled houses .
Thus , scouring Sville is like rwinding the tme and being propelled in te pat .
On acount of a this , it is es to understad wh my perception of Seville has sigificntly changed ver time .
As f as I 'm concern , the ity is no onger a museu displaying sumptuos and ostentatious monuments .
It turns t to be now a vry welcoming and relaxing ace where warm - earted people live and where I greatly njoy spenig some tie .
AT AN AMAZING COINCIENCE !
Hav you er witnessed the collapse of a myth and the birth of a new ta at the same tim ?
his er , in Ial , for the first me in more than 200 years , it hapened a weird coincidence : the political leader Silvio Beruscni a th singer Liabue mrke their caeers on te ame day .
On the oe and , Berlusconi compromised his positin we sm journalist old the ord some wretappings of his wih wuld compromise his future poitial career ; on he ohe , Luciano Ligabue won the awr fr h et ong of e ear , bringing his carer ever forward .
Unbelevable as it m em , this is rell a bizarre coinciden .
De Jo ,
It 's great to e om news frm o .
What a luck a you are to have a year fe !
If I had also a year ee , I wou nl prefer tavellig ot working .
Swtzerland is rell a great ace r travelling . Yo should lan two ifferen prios to visit sitseeing places , ne in sumer an the oer one in winter .
mous sightseeing lces are really diffeet during winter ad summer .
If you decide to ground in Genea , I suggest you to vist irst the north of Switzerland rm h west to he st an thn the south of Switzerland from t east to te west .
Switrland is a mal coutr also ak your time and spend enouh te in eac place .
Conernig or inuiry on woring in my countr , it 's really difficult to g an authorisation to work , especially f periods loner hn a week .
Therfor , I suggest you to wo dring your ravellig time .
For instance if you plan to ta more than one wk in erma in Wallis , hink to try to id a lac wre u could hel in a restauran or a sho .
But if you prefer to rk uring a full three - month piod , you shoud a your employer a work ermi .
In any case , do n't hesitate to vsit me and my family in Lausane .
I lo forward to seing yu during your trip .
eter loed at his wtc and kne that he a to do sometng immeditly .
Twenty minutes ad passed , t Sarh was still inside the oue .
He started to bite hs nls , restless .
Se sid ha she would go out in five mintes .
What if she was in trouble ?
What if the own of th ouse s caught her ?
Fe more mites went by , n he decid to get ito the bungalow .
He clibd te tre cumsily an managed to enter through h op winow .
It s a dark night , so he cou barely se .
-hre is no ned or o to cli through the window , like a thf - said a sft vice .
h shock made Peter gasp .
Befre im there was a tall , drk won in black .
He ad n't seen her wn he had gone into the oo .
is eyes we adjusted to e dakness no , so he oul recognize her .
--Tris .
Tris ' mile became bger .
-It has been a long time , Peter .
May I ak o why ou r reakng into my house instead of knocking at e door ?
w ude of ou !
There w no anger in her voce , but amusent and something else at eer coul t distinguish .
-Whee is Srh ?
She mu be here .
Tris 's smile faded way .
- Yo e the ol person that came here in te lat five hours , Peer .
Unless ...
Th silence that followed he words was oppressive .
ey both knw wa wld appen if ris 's husband found ut a stager in his ose .
- I must find er befor he dos it .
Peae , help me find her .
S could be in dnger .
Ts sighed .
--Sorry , my friend , but I 'm not gn na face my hsband gai .
Ths me , you are on your n .
Fist of al , the publc transport is obsolete .
ae a look at th highways na h bg cits .
They a full of cars ech a eery d .
If there were a fuue for public transport , tat ould n't happen .
Taelling by cr giv you idependence .
You ae not ie to th timetble of the public transprt .
Yu can choose hen yo would like to go .
Yo can as hooe where y wol like to go .
Finally u can hoose who wol tave with yo .
Those e gat advantaes everyone can see .
Right now we have a problem : h oil reerves re depltng .
That is gng to happen sooner rathr an late .
It could seem to pin towards puic traport , neverteess it will psh r travelling even furher .
The reasn is that , once we r fee from our oil hckles , we ll sy faewel to most of i problems .
Ther ll be no mor greenhouse gsse , o can forget abt scalating gas pices d , finally , you wl not rmember air pollution .
Last u not leas , we are entering a digital era .
Computers d smartphones are becoming moe prominent in our lives .
hy woul I travel to a meetng in a diferent cty when I cn meet through Skype ?
I can not fn the eaon .
It 's a ast of time d ohe rsourcs .
In summary , te public tranpot is dyig .
We ned to emace h advnes of technogy ad we wil be fre of those teribl experiences .
I eno wthing sap opers on TV d he bes n r me is EastEnders .
This TV seri is mainly based on worng clas people and rpresens various thnic minority communities incluin African and Asian Muslims .
This hw is articuarly good as it represents how peple ro different ethnic backgrounds can engage wth ch thr .
It sws that ethnic inority pole can inegrate with the mjority Caucsian peole without losing their cultural and tradiionl valus .
In adtion , it provides an opportunity o peple ro differen bckgrounds to peep into t cultue and traditions of ritis people .
Although this soap inlves a lot of chting nd ploting between characters , it also shs t importance of family alues . I would defiiely recmmend ths drama serl to oter people .
It is important to ai awareness about different societies due to the fact tat Britain is bcoming such a multicultural society .
To travel roun the world hs always ben my deam since I was a little y .
However , wha is he best ans of trnsporttion to se he world or yurself ?
As a as I am cocrned , I ould refer to travl by boat .
A couple of god reaos are behind my choice .
First , to travel by ot is a very relaxing d cafree expriene , compared to being conined to a ver narrw and liited ltte space on th ea of a plane .
ecnd , people on the boats are granted the opportunity to see bautifu ocen les , while taking a lane oes n't provide this luur to ak a oo at t birds in the sky for plaes a travelling at su a high speed .
Third , when it coms to travel , what really mttrs is not yr destinain .
Fro my persective , it is the proces at is more vauale .
Therefore , I would choos to lengten the proces of travelling , and a comfortble voyage on the sea would cerainly becoe my fist choice , since it gurantees a long nd plasan taelling eperence .
I am writing to complain bout te suggested bar on smoking in ulic ras .
I wrk in Caf√© Ni , a wel - own restaurant , popular wh vitors in he centre of town .
I am very cncernd about this proposal , for a nume of reasons .
Frtly , I do not unestand why th is being impementd so quckly and w there a been no discussion - there is no time fo ayne to feel comfortable with the iea .
Secondly , it is unthinkable to suggest it in outdoor bars a rstaurnts - such an idea is comletey unworkble .
To upport my argument againt this poposal I would ik to expln what happened hn the authorities tempted to introduce a n on smoking in my home own .
It was unucessful , and the politicians h to evers hei decision .
In the ist place , w pepe did now about tis lw , and , of course , ot busins opposd the idea .
A non - mokig policy as introduced by some restaunts ; the consequences ere teribl : a lge number of thi customers vanished .
If is happen in caf√© Noir , proably I could os my ob .
In my opinion , introducig speifi non - smoking areas in ths type of establisments col be an excellent idea .
This wud ppear to be a better solution .
Da Mrgaret ,

Before moving to Augsug , I stuied biology for two semestes in Erlangen , bt so notice that it w n't th right subect of study for me .
So I sitched and I 'm hay to s tha it was h right decison !

A Rel Vacation and A Dream Vation
To me , a vacation is a specific trp or journey for recreation or tourism .
And I usually pend my cation with my family uing school reak .
However , there a tw ins of acatin , a rea vacatin and a rea acation .
One summer vacation , I went on a tip to ais with my famil .
It was a 10-y ip .
And we ad booked l our hels in advanc .
It seme to be a dream vaaton .
ut it turned out to be totally different when I arrived tre .
It ws in th afternoon when we arrivd .
hen I walked o the airport , I was attracted by the beautiful scenery .
Te stret , the f√©s d the people ored a beautiful pictur .
At night , I expected to av a roantic French iner at a osh restaurant .
But no , instead of sitting in a resturant , my m ook us to a supermrket to get se sandwiches f dinner .
In t next following das , we mostly had brea and sandwiches for our meals .
d we d oly ter when we were thirsty .
ring tese 10 days , we walked a lot inste of catching a b , ecause it saved mony to .
t it made my es sore eery niht .
Tis is kind of h al vacation r me .
Even though I was in a romantic city , I could n't eny my vacation in a roantic w due to the lo budgets we had .
To me , a dream cation is like gig to a beutiful island lke Palau , whe I can enjoy the sunshine d the sa .
And I oul lik to go there with my boyfried .
When I am there , I ould strt my ay by calling roo servic for a wonderful breakfst in b .
Afer , I ould hd to the sandy bec ad relax in the su , eeling the breeze .
As he day goe on , I would alo go swimming in the deep le sea , go norkelin or just l on he beach .
Lyin on he beac is very relaxing an it is e perfect thi to do on vacation .
Oe the su goes down , I wuld t the bars to have so drins and enjoy he nightlife .
Ad I would aays have my meals at some luxurious restaurants .
is is the kind of rea vacton I want so bad .
Vacations hould be relaing , not tring .
her a always the dfferences betwen a real vacation n a dam vaction .
And it is al on account of the bdgets we ve .
Onc I ae enough money , I ll have my ream vacatos ce tr .
From now on , I will ve my moey to tun all my vacations nto my dram vacations .
Wen I finihed th high school , I trted working as accounan in my father 's carpntr .
He produces doors an windows on wood .
At the begnning it was realy difficult to me because I as a little hy with cutomes and I was n't used to woking among noisy machinery n shouting workers , ut aftr a while ie I learned to gnore all of th !
Very soo I realized that his j was n't or me .
I was working in a very small conry and my ofice w isoate , so I did n't hav any contct wit other popl and my j started to get brng .
It tok me 12 yrs to get the courage to uit because it was my family compay an I fel rlly orr , but I ha to grw up d improve my rofessonal skills , so I egan to look f a ew job .
Whe I received an email from a copny bed in the centre of Milan , I wa reay excited !

I learned tht a man de anythin to conquer a woman , he even oes a lot of hateul ings o him such as going to r hom every night to st tgether or to hang out , hile later you ind out tat he has gng to places eept hi house .
I learned a man says anything just to sut you up and not discuss jus to have some lve moments .
He dos ot end an argument and give a psitin to unerstand your pint , he this he is right a oe t wt to tink abo it .

Recently I watched a film caled " The ixh Ses " , d I 'd totally ecmmend it to anyone ler th 13 .
Te movi is s in the United States around he 99 's , so we could say the lm is technically modern , though I 'm sure that in se years it il be coniered a classic .
It 's about he story of a litt y that is haund by a big secr , he is isited by ghost .
i mother does n't nw abt this , but sh is worrd bou hm .
So she decides to ae him to a chil psychologist .
The boy sn becomes friends wth th psychologist , and he stted noicng plenty of things but this exceptional boy .
I 'm nt noally keen on trilers , but ths is defintely a must wtch .
e boy 's acting is really something , such a thing hat his acting earned him a nomination for the Acdemy Awards .
I found this moe oh exiting and emocional , ot thumbs up for me !

In my opinion , shoping is not alays ejoyabl .
What 's more , shopping is lmost always unnoyable .
I jus hate it .
he whole proes is ardous a neve - wrking .
I am a omebdy type .
ery tme , hen somthing compels me to leave my " astle " , I feel under the weather .
Especially , when it comes to go hoping .
It ust winds me up .
Shoppin cenes are lcate in the city centres , so evey rad trip lasts ages ( I lve in a subu ) . Thusly , hen I gt to the mall , I am alredy bent out of shape .
Afterwards h crowd of eole is ramming me , wn I 'm ryig to walk .
The lighting in hop is obnoxious .
My ee istantaneously start to hurt .
I 'm not able to find a nice ger .
Althoh , if I find ometing ute , it wo n't ft .
And the worst thing - te queues .
I hate th wholeheartdy .
At he nd I 'm ivd ad exhausted .
Thank goodnes we live in he inerne e n I can do shopping withou leaving my bed .
1 . e author cmpares Easter to a pgn sprig festival , becus they are associated wih happiess .
The y Ester ad specifically Good Friday is clebrated is raduall deprived of religious cotent .
People do n't ant to to contemplate Chrit 's suferig , but they ant to move dictly to the cheerful part of Easter celebratn , so to Eate Snda .

According to th author , people " flinch fr consideration of Goo Friay " ue to tre aoos connected ith this ay : el - sacrifice , sfering and ath .
e wa self - sacifice is se as changd enormousy - we no onger ant to sacrifice ourlves , cause it 's unpopula n it is in contradiction with te idea of cosuerism .
Wha is mor , we a becoming different to oer eple 's suffering n that 's why we r n't willing to think about it , even on Goo Fray .
Suffering as well as death is pushed awy from ur rl lfe - we do n't wt to experience them but rathe watch it on differnt kinds of TV shows .
3 . L'real slgan " Because you 're worth it " proves the author 's thinking ha we are unilling to crifice ourselves .
In a consumptive lifestyle we wan more ad or for ourselve , bt ot fr other peope , because it will equre self - sacrifice .
ete looked at is tch nd knew tt he hd to do something mmediately .
It s a h summe day , everyone s wlkig to their usual destination ; work , school , buy some groceries , pick up te laundry or their clothes at the ceannrs , everyne exce Peter .
He wa sweating , looking at people in a confusig way .
" Do n't he know what is happening ? "
Suddenly , Peter stated to u , whl he ra , he loed at his watch , over and over again as if by looking at his watch ie would op .
u this was t e case , time continued to ps by , ever so slowly , mking eter ven ore nervous .
He stpped at a great big building knowing that th fastes ay to gt to e t loo of t bilding was by taking the elevator , bt what if the elevor stopped ?
He deided to tak t stairs and so he di .
He ra up e stairs as at as he coud .
Half way through his joune , he tripped .
To him , it felt as if im ad stopped fo a momen , but time , as time alwa does , ept ging .
Peter smiled or a bri moment as he rememerd his obsesion ih Einstein 's Theory of General Reltivity , he thugh " finally I undestand it " .
He calmly stoo up , ooed at his watch , hen cosed h eys and realized that tere was nothing ese to do .
Nowadays , it is ha for many yung peope to do physical exercie frequently .
It is a well - known fact that smetime they efer watching TV on the sof or paying computer games comfotabl to oin pyical actiitie .
So , it is necssary to fin a soluion in rer to ma yung people keep t in a motivated wa .
Ther can be no dob tha technology sould be a ol to motivate young people .
It is clear that most of them use cmputers a wch television almost every day , but hle the re doig this they re sitting in a comfortable sof .
I fee ry strongl that couter games could be an enjoyable a to do physical eercise whout going u of home .
In the marke , yo can fin a wide rang of comper games or video games to ep fit , su as daning to the rhythm of la hits , playing tenni , oig aerobics , rning ...
Moreover , schools can ay an important le in kds ' fitnes .
It is tu at an young ople do extra activities related to sports lke otball or asketball .
Ahough sm schools offe the hane of doing these , any thrs do t do .
I fimly believe that wee the shols to ofer kd a greater variety of sports , there c be no doubt that th would do mo exercise .
In this way , childr cold do the sport he prefer as a routine .
To sum up , it is important moivating the young people to do physal exeise .
School programmes a techology cld be effctive method to achieve ths oal .
It see to me tt school programmes would make young people be couraged to ke it because in ths a , they do ther fvourite sport in a rouine way .
It all started it jumpn ver the big lac trashcans .
I was 9 years old when it happened for h irt im .
ck in t time , wn I successfully psse th third grade , my paents decided to let me pck the psent that I nt as a reward .
h vey ist thing cae to my mind was a air of inline roller skates ; I used to look o of my window , or sitting on my huse 's dor tep and s my neighbors skating and trying to do som tricks an jumps , an al I wanted a joining them instead of watching tm ejoyin their times .
My parents took me to TOYS R US to get what I antd .
I a to he outdoor toys sction d I piced he kate I lik .
I ried cule of sizes to see which one fits more .
I could ot be mo excted to join my riends .
After tt , I wt back hoe , I put them on , n I ent outside to skt .
I fell ove a hundd times in a few das .
By the time , I got btter , a I started to lear o to do tricks and jump over small iem .
hile katng a a whim f my friends and me in the beginning , I ound yelf in it .
I ew that skating is the tin I want to do or the st of my life , the tig I want to tell people aou whe the ask me what yor favorite thing to do is .
In a cule of years , I beame mch bete and I learned to do many tricks lik sating backwards , the Snk n the Ziga .
I learned how to jum over ay items , sch as chair nd e trashcans ha my neighbrs use to jump over .
Howeer , at was nt nough fr me .
I kept trying to nw mr aou skating .
I entered middle schol ; I mt two friends ho also oe to skate , ohmmed and Khalid .
We decided to go skatig on the next weeend at th ar , which s a de walk path by the sea .
When we met on the weekend , I noticed that ty wre different ; they he different skates , and dfferen methods of skating , hy slid on edges and skated on t par beches .
I realized that hi is what I am loing f , a new additonal ecitement to d to skating .
I had to wi for tw moths to buy a n par of skates , b tis time it is aggresive skates .
When I startd aggressive sking , I d to lear how to blance my weigt using hay two - hel inine skates .
his knd of skating taught me how to tae risks a n to be arid .
After a while , te group xpanded , a we used to go arond h ton , Yan , to searc for gat edges and rails to slide on .
In addition , we md r o kate rails , a we used ome help fo my rend 's brother , who is in fact an Engneer .
Once on a weekend , it wa my last er in middle chol , I was at te prk practicg as usual .
I foud three peop skating , and aan , a nw kind of skes , and new methods .
Their moes wer so smooth ; it a more like a bllt .
I wa impressed .
I introuced myself , and as I thogt , he were isng ro a diferet city .
We discussed dfferent toics , but inly skatng .
e more we get dep it the coersation , he more I wn to lern this tp of skatn .
It turned ot that the were wearing roller hoce skates . "
hse skates are lit , smooth , n perfe for reestye slalom skatng .
" On of them sid .
The words " freestyle " and " sllm " augt my attention .
hy shed me what slalom sktng is .
They started to put small cones in one lie ih a bit of space in between .
They pled some music ad sared to skte with the rhyth . I a urprised , I h mixd feeling , and it wa indescribable .
I kpt staring at the with ide opee moh nd eyes .
The buttrfly feeling in my stomach started to appe .
I ke at at moment that I want to change my style of skating .
However , as t skaters suggested , I bougt a ai of hcky skaes .
I d not have he ability to order t ons onine ba thn , thrfore , I et to IKEA , a bouht sall colored cups an used it as coes .
I en to the same pr .
fer couple of hour of tryin to get used to my n skate , I put the cups on .
I opeed some tutorial vdes on YouTube and sated to practise .
In a short time , I beame so god , and oe of my friends haged rom agrssive to slalom saing jst by seeing me practicing .
My guess is they h the same reacti I h whn I saw the tee skaters .
For me , skating is not ju a srt .
After almost 3 eas of practicing to do tris , to creat a prfect match between my moes an t rhythm of te ng I am playing , a to r to rea e perfetion , I realized that lalm skating is mre like a performing r than a spor .
A frestyle skater h a ake a perfct combo of tricks ta matches t hyhm is an artist .
When I stopped looking fr enthusiasm , fn , ad excitement and trted ryng to flfill my heart , brain , and by 's desires by sting , I knew fr su sating is ot just a por or a bby .
Skating is a liestyle .
Abt one year ago , I movd to Philadelphia , Unite State .
Ulie weathe in my untry , Phladelpha is always rainy , wet , ad loppy .
Tis weather was an obtcle , it a imossble to skate in this condition .
However , I was not ging to gv up on skating that easy .
I ad to find something to ep me going , to flfil th missing part in me .
A friend sggested giving ice skaing a sho , ad r me , everything oth tryig just to be ble to skate ain .
I went to an ce rink , I ented hockey skae , nd I sarted to skate .
I did no imagn that it ould be tha similar to rller skating .
Wa I leared in 10 ars , I had h ability to learn it on ice in oe month .
It was just a mater of balance .
Tay , Afte 10 yes of skating , I wnder someimes what my lf ould be without skating . I believe that skating is a hg prt of me , Mohamed , and I am osiive that if th art a missig , my pt in life would hve anged and I will never be the same erso I am ow .

Students us lean their lines by het .
h mt effecnve wy is to practis very lesson or ten mnuts at the begining n end .
You c give thm he ly ith gps to read though and inlly get hm to perorm a number of times without a scrpt .
Some larnrs wl n want a spiaking part , you can een s te to be pomters .
Reasons for ong a lay : learners il learn hole chunks of language in a cear context ad they will learn not only their pats .
It gives earner the opportunity to demonstrate differe thei sils at te languae classroom .
Al they can see ho much language th can produe .
In a world of increaing environmental awaeness improved pubc trnsort represents he way of the futue .
Although people do noy the convenienc n privacy of travelling in ther own private vehicles , in my opnon thy may choose public transport if it fulfl certin onitions .
These condition fall ino three boad categories : attitudinal , iancial and logistical .
Frm an attitudinal perspective , people mu fist be convinced of the benefits of public transportation .
An educatonal or pulc reations campaign must be launhed to snsitize tho who mht hae disregarded this possibility before .
People shul be familiarized with the enironmentl , socil and persoal beneits r presen and fure generations .
his is ne step .
Fro a financial prsective , pbli ransportatin mst be a ler and vabl eneft to consumers .
In ote words , it must be more affordable han driving to work every da .
Fo example , if pele now that by using b and uway , they c save enough oney to tak a fre oiday ech year , many more inviduals old be persuaded to travel in this way .
hs is aothr crical ste .
ro a logistical perspective , public transportation ould be convenient for commuters .
City planners d transport oficials ust ensure that fequent a reliable public tranportation is availale r each ciizen .
Fo people to make th abt of traveling by bus or subway , they must ko that tey will be able to get to vriou laces on tme .
ransport vehicles must be we mainaine , subway n u drivers should be customer - oriented ad service mu be punctua and efficient .
Tis is an additional importnt ep .
In conclsin , through a uli - pongd approach , it is posible to increase the s of ublic transportation .
iy offiial nd politiins can lead th way by utilizig these fms of transport themslve an brinig abot cang thrugh persona example .
Thn , oe citizens will fllw ui an we may l hoe to live in a cleaner , less pollte environment .

On te on hand her ae adly ny bnks in tse regions , so te do n't hv accss to bank erices .
But on h ther had the numbe of mobile phones has risn .
So now e most imptant factor is that mobile nes ae eaching the remotest ars in te world .
Through ts many peple wold have access to mobile banking and in addition to that it makes money vailable so it n be used in shops .
According to Hnna Dideck te lgest potential is that migrants o use mobile bankin to send moe ome .
I hope I could hlp you wt this informatio .

For today 's teeager it is har to iaine life before mobile phones althogh it d exist only some decas ago .
Few technica inventions hae d uc a deep mact on ur daily lie as ti litl thing .
However , there are varis advntages and disadvantages to a mobile phone nd everyon has to dcide for him- or herself in which way to us ths mdum .
First of l , te mobile phon is a great way to " ta conneced " l the time . Chating with your friends , styig inform of the latest nw , rdring olin , etc - u a do l ese things smultaneously , wherev and whenever u wan .
This aspect h also enabld employees to become homworkers as he do not long need to be present in an offce to gt a job done .
Furthermore mobile phones allow last - inute - hnges vry easily .
No ne to mak a fix appointment wit a frnd in advace , as you can lways agre to cll ech othe once evryoe is on the y .
Howver , the biget strength of e mobile phoe is ao e bigest rsk in my opiion : beng conected all the time creates a l of sres for people , as yu are always available for verone .
Therefore you do n't hae ny tme to rlx , which is essential , evn rom your lisue duties .
h sae is valid for usines life : if employes r available all the time , they take the wores of the daily business with he to their home whih mean a lot of stress .
Last but o least , the mile phone enbes worried parents or suspicious parner to tac te chi or the loved oe neay permanently .
This a be seen as lovi worr aou someoe ut so as a si of istrus .
Finll , the moile phoe offers both disadvatages and avantges in daily life .
However , I personally think tt it shod nt be regarde too critially but should ol be handled responsably , accorig to n 's prsonal nees .
I recently sw a film called Passengers .
It 's about 2000 people that wt to go to a new planet to start a new li and their tri was going to take approximately 120 years .
Before the trip started , h compny wo deced to make this rip said that everything was perfectly caclated so that it s posible to have any knd of problem with h spacecraft .
But they wee rng .
The fst 30 year all was going good , ut suddenly omething bad happend .
ne of t cabins broke do ad the person who s inside it waked up .
These u was calle Mak and he was engneer .
nce he realizd ta he was te only person awake he nw soething s wrong ..
He a oing to be alone fr the ne 90 ears .
He could n't continue like tha so he hacked one of h cabs of a woan ta he loved .
he irs 2 years all s perfct uil the day number 73 .
Sh discovered that h dd n't ave any problem with the cbi , it wa ak wo hacked it .
Since the , they never soke again .
It oes ot sem like ear have passe since I firt m her , but it was some ie o indeed .
It as such a hot smme tat it s imssible to turn off t venlator and I ws a bored child with a lapp . I a gned in on the social network Tueni and I liked passing all te tme chatting .
O d , a girl cale Irene talkd to me .
Se told me that she was bored as well nd that she also had two brothers .
She was a very friendly person and soon we wee chating every dy .
Altough we were in the sae schol , we a n't aled before .
It was nearl ugust wh we deided to meet .
I was really excite .
ren was taller ha me , brown - eyed n dak - haired .
She pked me up to r house .
Ad ha a beutiful hous it wa !
She a a swimming ool , a lttl garden and a lovely bunny called " Suki " .
We tyed thee l the afternoon , talking and aughing lk we had been friends for ages .
I knew it ws t beginning of a grea friendhp .
That o meing made it a ay I will never frget .
uis wa convinced th ts e prject wi be an incredile opportunity for hm to ry n thngs d sud different fields , which he enjoed , he loved to read about cence , inventions , a say up to date with t ews .
But he immediately hought - why ot ntinue oin what I love while I do somthin w?-
Tat 's exactly what he began doing .
He sen an e - ai to the tu omany explaning hi situation and uden intest in this project .
The ompan immediaely replied telling i hat thy were sorr if they d n't rel da arier , u hey could n't since th system crased an i n't allo tm to sen electronic il , just to receve .
They told tat it s alright if he a interested in othr projects , bt he til nedd to ge th sam working pformance .
ey asked him about tis project and what was s ida .
Louis told te that it was relate to an instrument to exple new places .
He dd trust t company , b not ha uh for tm to know everything he thought .
The ompany tld Louis that te did n't want to bother m , ut that ty wre intereted in investing in thi kind of proects , becas it as related to the purpose of the company : eplorin .
But Louis new ha he invention needed to have a grea design tht implemetd portability , that is why he needed to refi his ideas or this project to be ed in an immense typ of useful ay .
e ompan old Loi at they wantd to compromise in his project an hl Louis .
ter , tht same day , Loi wnt cave dvig in the mainland .
He antd to conquest as mu teritoy down the s level as he cou .
He thought that it as a great wy to relax and hink aou ting .
He loved he ide to ecend to he bottom of the sea were his iea would n't be tak awy or heard .
When he was exploring the botto of the sea he ied to grab a ro , bu just when he touched it scatterd into dust , which vanshd in the bulk quanty of watr around him , that 's we he nw the next important thing that h inventon nede to have : resstnce .
There 's a lo of resure in t deep parts of th sea and ha hapned to the rok was the cer poof of it .
lthugh it lso eeded to be fleile it needed to be tugh .
It needed to be his way .
If o , h consmer of ths product will end buried .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to utine actions aen by the authrities of Mi≈Ñsk Mazowick in he sphere of preserving the evironment .
What happens to te rbbish
The ocl overnent of Mi≈Ñsk Mazowiecki has recently implented ne laws which concer rubbish segregaion .
It is bigatory for the inabitants to put their different typs of garbage into separa bins .
Although itiens usually obey hoe ruls , in some ases th are completely neglcte .
Hoeve , eople who ae biggr houses nd to compst the organic wste and tat makes up for the isobedient .
The situaion with household iter looks mch bete rather than what happens on the seets of he it .
Wast is thrown on the grnd and vr few people e concerned aout his proble .
own 's actons
As no all inhabitants ae sensitive about the envirnmen , it is h local goernmen 's responsibility to decrease e harmful effets of pole 's actios .
Authoties mae sue tht ubbih bin r placed in mll ditances since this is e mt common reason why peopl thrw litter on te ground .
There are mny workers eployed so hat e waste is picd up .
Not al doe it give jo to eope , ut aso as a good iact on the to 's scenry .
Oe of h most challenging ises in modern cities is trnsportation .
Cities ave een planned to satisfy people 's needs to travel al around te city .
w we can bserve pepl movin around the city using bikes , undergrond , pblic ranspor , a cars .
Althugh there a mn people who uggest ht public trnsport is no loger a suitable otion because cars ae consiered a mr convenint option to trnsport , there are more bnefit using pulic transport than tavelling by car , suh as reduction of traffic , svin money , n decreasing of olluton .
Firsl , a car ould ary ol 5 people at a time .
A bus or an underround gon can carr from 30 to 100 peol at a time .
he refering to cars , we can cosiderably reduce te nuber of ehicle on t streets if we ue puli transport .
The less we use cars , the less taffic we shall e in te road .
econdl , hvig a ar implies different costs to be affoded .
or eample , car reire petrol to function .
If a person constantl us hi / her a , he / sh shall need to a for re erol .
Equally imporant , a car rqires maintennce and it shall be another expense tha the owner s to cver .
Finally , if evey person drives his / her n car , pollution hal considerably increae afeting a conditions .
I w getting rell ord .
I d to tnd beause we wre shifting our house and h just sld almost all of ou uniture on L .
The floor was very dirty and I could not vn go out because al the people wo antd to bu or furniture were stadin near our door .
My mothr sai that it would be rd to go at that time .
I was so annoyed that I coed my eyes and wished for a chair ...
en I opend my ees I sw a beautifu hair with range and green stipes .
It had four red wooden les and it ookd very comfortable indeed .
I immediately sat down and began to fl relxed .
Suenly the chair jerked up an went straight out of th wndow while I a stil siting on it .
It swere beautiully avoiding a tree n landed on he ground as softly as a butterfly .
hn I realized that the char had whees along wh a ' nir & teleport ' button on the armes .
I ight have ressed te nitro button by mistae when I sat dwn .
I presed teleport and said , " Botanical garden " .
It actuly took me there !
I had a great time taking a stro thee while peole watchd me wih tei eyebrows raised .
I anted to explore moe about the air but I kw ht I houl go home by em .
So I pressed teleport and said , " Hoe " .
That 's where it oo me .
As on as I reache there t chair disappeared d I landed on the flor with a thum !
My mother came d said , " Ge up !
e floor is so dirty " and sh went .
I uess it is back to norml now so I wil have to ge up gan .
I leaned agait the al and hought about my aventure .
Today we ha a class discussion about taking one year off between leaving scoo and tartin univrsity .
Difeent though came up , but my personal opnin is ht it oud be a wondeul thin .
Takig a year off miht help eple who are uncertain aot hat to do nx to make up their minds , while trying e thins and making new experieces that will be usefu lte on their ivs .
It wud crtinly be couteproductive and a waste of time if the ie wold be spet oing nothng and just passing e te like it were a long vaction , but if it is used to me nw experiences , a year o a chng the future of a person .
It an be a gat opprtunity to travl , eet w cultures and pepl , or it an be a cane to wrk to sav up money for bei ae to affd the cost of the univesity plnned on ttendin .
Or maybe during the year ff sombdy could also decide that hy do n't wa to contnue thir sudies , becaus hey lread fond hat they ant to do or be .
Personally , I would ov to take one ya off , and I tin I would spd it travellng arod Euope .
Se prootion , which is the set of arketing actiities undertaken to boost sales of the prduct or service , a beoe a vital tool for marketng and ts importace s been increasing significantly over th ers .
In spite of some controveries , sles promotion ha already demonstraed a mas of positive ipat on both sellers d buyers .
The m of this presentation will be to analyse the aims and approaches of sales romotin as well as to evalua bth benefits an drawbacks sales promotions provide .
For thi pupose , h presetation wl be divid ito four section .

Dear rader ;
My name is Ivan Longo , I 'm 19 years od and I ws bo at Val d'Isr , Ialy , but lst year I moved to Barcelona , in pai .
I 'm the oldest of 4 os .
I 'm studying a degee on Bioechnolog at IQ , hee in Barcelona .
In my fee time I like to meet wh my friend , go sking , listening to se musc d watching films and seie .
Th summer I old like to come to n of your cas around h U .
Why houd y cotact me ?
I 'm a very extroverted guy , with experiec takin care of children as I 've een working as a skiing trainer for 2 years now , his winter it will be th third .
I ko how to tet childen a w to make them he fun , something hat would help me to organise ctivites and vens r them .
I 'm so very el - confdnt a independent , as I ive lne , what s make me a vey good ooer .
All of this abilities make me thk I 'm the perfec man for your job .
He to hea from you on ,
In
Wit ay w course , there are some certain expectations e will have .
At te beginning of this coure , as a firt year postgraduate student , I was ambitus for creating a new mechanicl rduct or at leat ar of it at th end of this core by applying knowledge ad sils hat ae provided throughout the ourse .
Eght mnth woking in the indury as an assistant mchaical design engineer gave me the ery basic coept of echanical design .
Befo akin art in his cours , my concept bout mechanical design wa about aplying ether self nwledge or working as a part of a em to design mecanial prodcs tht ar easy to be mnufacturd , durable and financial relile .
My thoghts about mechaicl dign were soewha mtch with he formation ht is proided in the first three weks .
By attendig te fist three lectures , I son realized tha my eneral concept about mechanical dsgn is qite simple as my thoughts about mehanical desg is purely just creting n products .
I recognied ht mchanical design is ot just about reatng mechanical products .
It can be sn in ny aspects ranging fr poducng a maintenance process , improvig performance for a specifc part of the mechanical ystem to creating the whoe new product .
Th is becaue deite haig exprience in industrial esign , I as evr tking part in h design roess om the iitil stage .
Therefore , my knowledge about mechanial design is rather limited .
Bein paced in a project eam workin or Sydney Water about producing a mitenance xcellet stanar , I started to ead th course outline d lecture notes more carefull to fn ot where to start and what I shold do to deliver a good outcome .
The frst thing I ve oticed is the importac of clarifying all t requirements wi the clens .
This was demonstrated during h Poject Introdutios sessio as ll as lectre noes , client intervw task an clien feedback ( which is ort 25 oint in e totl mark ) .
As soo as I t my grop , I iscovere hw far ehnd I am in trms of uin English to demonstrate h ideas and ure th attention from ther grup members .
Hwevr , ths alo is an oppotunit to me up d wk with hm every we , whs English is their first language , to mprov my oral communcation skills and persuasion .
Because in orer to delir a succesful nustry project , I not oy hae to make a good product , t al have to be good at introducing my idea and persading custoers .
Te final considertion is the sef - caliration , which ao is the poin tha I have nevr considered beore in a dein pross .
This is such an essentl activity that llows me to uge my performance , keep pce ith he group and no to be lf behind .
To um up , at the end of eek three , my expetation f this course are to be able to appl my eflecive thinking in ny further deign process , to be ble to deliver a persuasive technical presentation , to be effectiv in verbl ommunication kills and presentation skil .
Lt bu not lea , I oe I n ean to work effectiely ndr any circumstances as a eam meber or a te lade by the ed of his course .

In today 's world , d to the fact the great comfrt of cars , pulic tnsport is ikely to disappear .
Firsty , is it true tha crs are he ater way of trasport .
After all , tee are many pope wh ca n't afod a car .
In ddition the cr is n of e means most used t only its quickness but al because he ct of publi tansport is increasing evy year .
From my pit of view , many peope e cars we to h awful quality of some buses , trains ‚Ä¶
We should also consider he fact tat nowday life is so busy that we ca n't waste our tme takig public transport .
However , cars n case some problems like traic ams nd accidents that old be avoided using pubic trnsport .
To concue , it seems to me hat it is fine to u ars sometimes u whether th quality of publc tranort as betr , h amount of polluion and acciets would decrease .
In recent years , many regions of e worl hav aced an issue aout water scarcity tht y affet their development , especially for those cunties undergoig poverty .
Due to t increasing population of h world , cuntrie are likely to need oe freh wter to irrigte crops to sisfy their popuatio .
herefore , water scarcity may ose a theat to eople 's liin standards .
Th essay wil analyse e prble of water sarcity in ustralia and recmmed some viable alleviation solutions .
It will examine responses icluding e recycling water , the devlpment of technoloy about purifying ocean watr and multnational sharng aout water resources .
Recycln wastewater is an effective metod to solve water scarcity roblem .
Ths is because here is a uge nume of ter usage presenting in pele 's aly life , they just ed to be cllcted to filter wast parts .
However , he use of recyled waer for ail routine is less omon , becaus mny people are epelled by the thought of watr tat comes from or tlets or rans .
For example , those ecycled watr can be utilize to water plants in a gardn , but if he are clear eoug , residents only need to at them to wash dishes or even drink .
Th , staes should make it possile to purify t wastewater to an enough safety lev .
Moeoer , developng latest techlogy but puifyin ocean water can be regarded as a iale aleviation stategy .
As is well kown , about 70 er ct surae of earth is covered by oean water , so ery region surounded by ocean like ustrlia aks the most of ocean watr esoure to reease the presure of fresh wte need .
Although , gvernment e likely to face economic strs initily , which means they have to invest more mony io ugrae technology instead of other field such as education , infrastructure and mical care , this strategy could affect dwelers ' hyical helth nd pmote their living standard .
Sharing diffent water resures with neihbouring countris a be another tategy whi an el to alleviate the prolm of waer carcty .
Countries with abudant resources cn give asistance to nations wth water scacity .
In this wy , those states of droht regions will obtain enough time and tehnical aid to overcome water problems .
Despite over hared wae rources cold lad to olence and even internatioal tension , few countries sufered these pobems .
In conclusion , wtr shortage as presented a challenge to individua life and globa enironment .
Tis eay hs discussed three alleviation strategies wih the potential to reolve he probem of wter scarcity , incldin h use of recced water nd ocean ater nd international aid .
While these approaches re kely to solve the problm partially , the might have a positi imact on water shortage in a ong term .

Nowadays we wtch te rfection of actors all ov te world .
Te range of techniques the use to tike the auience is colossal .
Facial expesson is sid to be mr importat f the film actor , whereas body anguage a oice intonation are paid more attention to in the stage acng .
Besides , camera work , props d special effcts deserve to be caed silve scree features , while staging implies actors to convey thei pla through body movements a energy .
It is evidently ht those ypes of acting are diffrent and he actors should adapt to h conditions the or in in one way or anoter .
But let 's take a cloe ook at wa performance capabilitie they have d mih use urin h acting .
The stage ator is armed with props , costumes and igh as wel as the film actr .
e only prpondeance of ilm cting vrsus sge acing is in camera / editing work d special effects .
But those e jstiied by the presence effect stage actors might render active in omparisn to film actors .
So I wld ay those yes of acting are evn in e snse of external facors .
Regarding ctin tecniques , stag actor do e their bd langages as mch as film acts .
The oly thing tt differ is that il actor a everal taes oppoe to stage actor who has to play perfectly at one das .
nd controlli your ice is alo impotnt for t film ctos , in spt of having the spport of audio operators , they till hv to dal th he same prolem as stage actos tat is keeping yr voie expressios in compiace with th acting , eonate moving , comunicate eoions d feelings of eir mode chracte .
The e pint is that the hle rne of techniqus mks that acng pieces erect .
I would s , it ds n't mate re u prfrming on he stage or in front of e caera , u shul use your facial expressin , ody lnguae , ntonation n timber of vie as if you 're acting as your mn character , emody all their treat and features appropriaely to te sitution .
In othr words , no matr what ki of perormanc it is , the only hing that matters is using all your ailities to model yourslf on our er , get t feel of thir role .

I hve bee poving my abilities by overcoming arduous competitions since I chose ths career as a lawyer nd resecher cmplying wih my passin in persuaso and prolm solving .
In 202 , I was anked th amongst 0 candidates comptng for 40 places at the Unverity edera of Paraiba .
Throughout my undrgraduate studies , my pofessonal skills we rcgnized at the internships at t Fdeal our of Law and the most famos fiscal law office in t State .
At this period , I was t intern coordinator and I created a manual on the procedures employed by the entire Court .
At e law office , I suervsed t ISO 80 procedures .
On h other side , in recognition to my academic performance , I graduated with a Bcheor of Laws ith Great Honors in 2007 .
I was pacd in he to 10 wih a GPA of 8.73 out of 10 .
My bachelor thesis , foundd in Econmic Law , wa unanimously awarded by the Juy th th maxim soe of 10 .
Ts first success as a researcher contrbuted to my interest in goal regulation of trade , at conucs me to this LL and he international busnes trnactions dman .
ince my Law school graduation , any achievements enourage my proessional development .
Fit , upon graduation , I immdiatly joned a highly econized firm , performing a duble role of lal conultnt n sub - managr , when I s only 22 years old .
On te same yar , I succeeded h strenuous Brazili Bar exam with a remarkabl score of 9 t of 10 .
After almost 2 eas wrkig in complex litigation , I had acquired e matrit to urse an intrnational career to wrk ithin and cross - boer contracts .
Therefore , in der to quire the excllence extnt demanded , I peialized in Economc law with a mster 's dege at the Univerity ari 1 Panth√©on - Soronne in 009 .
Following my LL graution with aga cum laude in th top fi , I enrolled in a PhD in Interntinal Ecomic L at e niversity Pai 9 Daupie in 010 .
Due to my interest in aw n ecoomics , I developed a multidisciplinary research applying e econmic analysis in contemplatin of illustrating th mtua influence of rules n econom transactions on th lga cetainy of transnational transactions .
I proondly comprehend the theoretical ascertanmet f ths crer , which is th interatinal tre requires ratonal economic decisns th legally bindg consequences .
hereb , new regltory sources re created in reponse to the globalized legal cntext .
In conclusion , as an nternational legal professional , I must be prepared fo lternativ mthds of ipute resolution regarding ross - border transaction , ving the increasingly requirement to lok byond domestic w to fi approriate solutions .
Furthermore , I aleady prooundy understand th iprtance of linguistics in an international sphere d to my experience as a foreign lawe and as a teacher .
Hecefrth , I aim to consolidate my career by mastering the lea responses to the developments shaping international trade tod .
The LLM in Interntional Business Regulation , Litiatio an Arbitraton at Ne rk University is irefutbly h postgraduate pogram that I need to ense the oucome aimed .
Ma has volvd over the yes , sne t invention of the wheel , to pac craft xpedtions .
r specie a acheved eat ings , but epite all t great discoveries , thee is stil on problem we have not been able to suppress , a problem tt has been hautng us sine uemorable imes : racism .
In the 19th century , slavery had ben eradicated om Aerica , b son another rblem originated an took its place .
he movie " e Coor Purple " displays a vriety of situation from Afo - Americn people who suffered bcause of tir skin color , know as acis , which can be defined as the pejudie or disrimination from one ac to another .
In this period of tme , th Caucasian re felt superor to the Afro - Americans , the had the control d they wee in charge of te political and economic activity , wil t Ar- Americans i the hr work ; as shown in th move , most of te n where in carg of the crops .
They did no ave a chance to rceive y kind of ducation at all , it was absoltely foridden , n tha is h te ould not aspire to more importat jobs .
Afo - Americans were comletel segregated , Cacasias found it impossible to lie among tem , that is the main rean why each race had their own churh ad their houses where separated to .
Afro - Aericas were afrd of aising their voices to express thei inconformity ainst th pression ey wre suffein , and to iht to obtai quality was not an optio ecause a sgn of rebelion was cruelly punished .
oreover , women in the Aro - Aerican ciety wer threatened in the mt enigrting ways , en were the undispued auority in e hse .
Woen were in charge of t huehold chores , some of them could get a job as a servant of a Cacasian family .
It makes me fel sad to realze that racism is still a problem from which scity sfers . I wonder , Why do we hav t necessity of feeln superior to her people ?
We are all equal to God 's eyes , nd I believe we l have he same rght of ivng a pceful life based on mutl respect .
It had en a log a rin a ; Tom ad ben wring all y and was very tired and hungr .
He decide to go and have dinnr at a restaurant which a ve near hs offe .

They elt really hapy together , a Mlly asked o for a date .

Public transport is more useful n btter than travelling by a .

Since car produe exhaust fumes ich slowly destroy our plnet , we huld start sing ublic trnsport mr ofen .
Although there r man other plluters , such as big idustris , pole should str wih the easiest resolutions .
Athogh mny countries do n ofe a od public transport service , one people get r of car ther will be or money for t improements .

Thank or sarin !
I really enjoye reading ou blog out shadowing tudets .
I lk the wy you ave eampes how you fe and how you would change your own lessons .
I live in the Netherlands and at our chol it 's the same .
ur ppis hae to si o any hor a day , ad they find it ad to si still ad to be silet .
I alo think that a lsson went well if he did n't talk and d their work .
However , wh I was redig your article I felt shame due to the act that when every teacher teahes the wa I do it is logical that ou students ca n't be uie ad ca n't it wthou akin a mov .
Morever , whe we as tchers have a tuy day , I e tired myself by siting l y .
ur key takeaway # 3 wa shocking o me , h feeig of being a uisace is dreful .
In my opinion I am ey ptien nd willing to explai dfficut topics over and over agi .
I rall ope my students feel the me , otherwise I ve to change my attiud ! I et paid or being a teacher and ,
as I see it , it is my job to clarify n elp my puils to understand .
Your experience ge me food for thouht especally when you wot tha our pupils re sttin passivy and lisenng durg approximately 90 per nt of their clases .
I am ing to look at my lessns again to se if I a hnge thos lessons and try to ak my pupils active .
I tch at Basisberoeps level and I hve already trted to us oe acivities were they mus ue an Ipad and make pictre or short fims .
For example , my pupil had to learn the differece eween this d hat nd I lt them mae a hot fil about pointing at things in shol saying : ti door , that wnow , his is my techer , ht is a chair .
Hoevr , I find it difficult to s civities every lessn because they are ime consumng .
lthogh the min resn that pevets me rom usin them are my collagues .
I do n't see tem doing activtie , it look as if they are jt oing the lsson n want to use a bo a that is it .
For instance , when I er that another English taher inished Unit 5 and I am stll at Ui 4 I fee incompeently .
It gives me t eling ha most important of teaching is doing all e exercises in th book n ettin l the work done .
Maybe u ndrstand this discepancy between acvate pils an te pressure of t schol boar r the bet tes results .
In other wor , how c we connce school bard ad colleagues that it is bettr r ppis to ean in an atie way ?
Maybe h only one s 'll ever ve .

Everythig a looking erfect and it was something sh enjoyed noing efoe the acciden took place .
Hr mm would probably want her to srt to live no matter what .
S felt butteflies in er stomach .
She slowly stated to sle .
The s music that was playing in h earones mae r feel ven me confident .
e psse next to the a where her boyfiend was gttng high with me , known to her , boys .
She nted to stop m .

ichael knew he s fading wa , eer consumed by a feeling of apah .
He hardly ew h he ws anymore .
Te dark ouds abe t k , full of life , seemed to mock s little desre to ive .
He oud heard e tunders shouting th rage , a rag he wished he oul feel gan .
He stared at an obect on the bsde table , t ojet ht could free him from this hell like existence .
Thinking about it relived him , made m feel excted about th unknown , th unexpeted , ayb a the quesion vr asked , maybe , finll , they woud be answered .

A tear stated running don his face as he lked at e couds .

He pace a hk ovr the door , tied the bjet to it nd tandig on a chair ut the objec around s nck .
He lokd at the clouds , thy were sil ry , and he for a mont , he saw a tinn fragment of a raino .

The memers of my family ae my es frieds
amil is an group of people closely related by blood .
his is easy word to unrstand , u it hides moe thn deinatin says .
Behind ths ord I see my brohe , parents and grandparents and el very rm feling .
I hik h mt important things in th amily are lve a support .
All the pope need these things and e bt giers are fami members because they gie unconditionally .
My family members a h ie expresion their wam feelin ih hugs , kisss a beautfu words .
r example my parents hug me every day .
My mother ake me breakfast eer oring and my brthr rngs me cookies , whe I av a bad mo .
Tese sma thig gives me a o .
lso they always support me no mater what I do or hnk .
The secod imporat hin is that I can ways coun on my family .
Usal friends a fen say " no " or et me down , t my fmly never doe that .
hey a lways reay to hlp me , they never e me down .
Th third very important thing is trus .
My family knows ot of my secets , they kno my ories and joys , they know that I am thinking about tings .
And I like to trust my thoughts an secrets to hem , ecaus I knw that my family is loyal to me , and ter mouths ae closed .
To sum up , I can a that the members of my faly are my st frien .
They fulfill all the function that my friends h , and ty fulfil them ev better .
Nowadays , our environment is really affected by the rea eal of progress hat technology as made in h as entuy .
As a resul , some sources of energy like nulear powr re used fo our dily life .
But , is nuclear ower good or us ?
Let 's begin by considering h arguments in favur .
Huge amounts of eery ar generated by nulear recors .
Moroer , hy nly need a sll quantity of fuel to be produced .
Fosil fuels are r os common eery source , even though , they rodced a terribe ffet on goal warming on account of releasing gases to e atmosphere .
They wo n't last oreer and tis will increase the use of nclea energy .
Just lo at oil , natue takes millions of yer to form it a we have almost ede it .
Let 's turn to te arguments against .
Nuclear powr plants have a ih ik of pollution in as of ccient .
In addition , hey pruce nuclear waste which is a major roblem for the environment and public health .
A hings cosidred , I bliee that renewale enry will be te ost comn energy in t futre as it ds n't damage gobl rming although it is expensve to afford .
No , it is t rational beaus ccoring to te economic theory , u huld spe ou mney on those good hih yld the maxmm tlity per dollar .
MUx / Px must equal MUy / Py .
If x / Px is less than MUy / Py , than it is the consumer 's duty to b more of good Y. If MUy / Py is less thn MUx / Px , han the consumer must us more of good X. When yu rk mr , y c onsume mor , each additional ni yieldig additional , marginal utility , so you continually increase the um of our total utility .
Following the tradition of economic reaoing , oe is better .
he may be right bout ht eadmill because there is a ccl in hch consuptin resul fro work wich necessitates further cosumption , but theory would indicae that hs is a positive , sf - perpetuating cycl ecuse increased consumption yields inreaed ulity , therefore maximizing utilit .
The ok says tht the rule to follow is to ry consumption utl t marginal tility for every dollar for one tin that you ae consuming is the sam as the margil utility fr very doar o another thing that you are consuming .
Ms. Luhr 's dissaisfactin from r crent tatu in u society mt come fom e failue to vary her consumption of a variety of material goods .
For ods , the marginal utlit may tar to be es than it s befre fter a hile , and then we a advised to switch our uing to othe gods .
Ms. uhr ees to find h gods which work for her .
Then se wold n't be talking abot the negative aspects of wr ecause it is wr hch allows her to consume and maximiz er utility .
Her til are at their higest he mr she consumes .
In my view Ms. Luhr is succuming to her emotions rather tan her logic becuse everyone knows tat icreaed wrk yild increased wath and creased uility , d thi is the ultimat al of a ational person who is acting selfishly which is how ecoomists thi popl act .
If Ms. Lhr were rly ing selfish and self - intereste , sh woul obtain grear satisfaction from greater consuptin , b h statement is deyin this tenet of ationalty hich is so importan to eonomc reasoning .
She os n't want more .
She must be irtional .

as Ferr is a mnstay of fashion photography sin e le 960s .
T peak of s career a in the early 80-s , after h legendary Kno Tado 's advertising campaign .
Ferer 's cmpaign for Knzo wa one of the os popuar nd it defined hi as a successful photographe .
ans urer as born in Switzelad in 39 .
After studyng ar in Switzerland , he worked as a graphic designer , illustrator an artistic rector in Lndn .
Traces of s previous career are evdnt throughot h wk in s careul compositions ad pecse styling .
In 166 , Hans Feurer travelled to Africa , ring ich rip he deded to becoe a photographer .
He retuned to London and bgan to comile a portfolio .
17 Feure 's career en up like a rocket .
At the me time he woke for the Prelli caedar in 1974 he also featured shots that appard in Elle , Voue , mero , tc .
More than 30 years a , in he reme deserts of North America , Hns Feure s iven free to ptograph Knzo Takedo 's 1983 advertising campig .
Th caeer of a Somali - American fshio model Iman also egn aftr this pionerng shootng .
Tes iages bcame th subject of Feurer 's eponymos ok , lashly ilustratd it 7 phtographs , illutrating s five - deade lo care .
The bo includes Feue 's photographs for e 14 Prell clendr , for Kodak and for fashion magazines su as Vogue Italia , ll Frnce nd Noa .
Weight iftng is iolves th aic d most natural human movements .
Obvisly the weih is the esistance , which wi hp the individual to gan strength nd ss .
Every time I go to te gym I ee lk I have to breaking my limits and place them wth the eelng of success .
Success mak me keep going .
h est advice I can give for a ewbie is to do nt go t gym at all without knowledge .
Every wrongly executed rep will take you closer to an injury .
Tae your tme a mke a plan .
Look up on the nteret w to xcute the exercises ropery .
Eating healthy foods re the other pat of ht sport .
I raer all that a life style .
The w competition lifts in order are t snatch and the clean and jerk .
Each weightlifter receives three attempts in ah , an the combined toal of e ighest w successful lifts detrmnes h oerll result with a bodyweight ctegory .
Bodyweigt categoies are different r omen and men .
A lifte who fails to comlee at least oe succesul sntch and one succssfu clen and jr als fais to total , d terefore receives an " incomplete " entry fr t competion .
The clean and press was once a cometition lit , but as discontinue ue to iffiulties in juding poper form .
Dickes and he rnte iters wrote in very different ways .
Dckns 's style is full of sentimentl realism : he describes realit with a senimentl tone a he mxe comedy and paos .
Converely , the Bronte sisters are influnced by he preceding Romantic work , d their novels cotain thic eleents suc as ghss and t drk ominus atmosphere .
If tir themes are considered , it is immediately clear ta Dickens builds an extraordinary ige of the Victorian society , with a wide rnge of chacters and stores which reveal the conditions of chldren and the poor ; instead the Bront ' novels contain the Byroi heo , a ml figue wt a dark past w nts to find se revenge , as Hatclif in " Wuthering eights " or forgiveness as Mr Rochester in " ane re " .
In contrast with Dicens , the rote sisters deal with love and pychologicall complex women as protagonists .

Enviromenal prolem tday are mor worrisome , if we ot do something o our planet , in a f years we wll suffer the consequences .
No time to speculate , it is time to c ad implement all thee masure we know .
Enoug talk , is tm to me a decision : we wan a tter world , or , we wn to e it detroyd in a fe yeas .
We stll have time .
Simle things lk reycling garbage , waling short ditances insed of using cars , not thowing garbag on the srees or oceans , ca mean a considerable chage , because if we a the small ffots of ec of us , e results are traslaed into illons of people .
I recommend implementing a campgn called " No more blah blh blah , it 's time to save t world " , we may ot hve sup powrs d not be " Surman , Iroman , Captin Amrica , Batan , etc . " and we save th plaet fom intergalactic threat but unlike tem , all tgether we an av the planet from an even greater threa , its total destruction ue to pollution a environmental problems that we ourselves hve caused .
Ju as we have the courag to provoke , we ave to hv the orage to do omething to fix , e us bece ha super hero that changed he world and made a change f future generations to have a healthy environment to lie .
Jut hin but ou fure n in you fmly , and he ou se rubbish lyin in the street , remembe that you a beoe the superhero that soedy be satisfied because he id sometng to av h planet .
It 's im to bring the uperero we have inside ; od lk !

Ara of facilities

The T ommandents provide Israel wi th oral raework for mantainin it .

Israel obedience to commandments was no a matter of submission to the divine will as much as it a a response to love

La Terrazza " is e classic Neapolit restaurant , hat aks izza and all the eapolitn pecalties , as all h type of ried .
It uses only fresh ingredients om napes th come here evr a .
The pizza has a really soft bs , a lo of tmao aue nd frsh leaves of basil .
T place rmembers the atmophee of the little alleyways of Naples , with pctures of the most aous Neapolitan people on the wll .
ou an sit there and wa for your zza while watching the footbal match or bring yr pizza ho .
The owner Patrizo , is ealy nice n you can often find m t of te restaurn tlking to some guest .

In increasing numbers , peole re using public transportation and local communities are expndng public tranport ervies .
Every segment of socety - individuals , famlie , communities , and businesses - benfits frm public transportation .
But , in fa , the car rovides mh better mobility needs , bt in the big ctie as on t contryide .

Do yo suddenly lose onfidece wh o have to spak to soeon ?
I ad the same problems , but I 've managed to fnd some was to overcome them .
Frst of ll , adopting a positive atitude is essential .
ou should never be afrai of making a mistake or wry that people wi laugh at ou .
onl then can u reall star to speak .
Most people listen fr t meaing of what you are ryig to a , a do not notie yor mistakes .
Secondly , you shoul ty to get as much speaking ractice as possible .
In class , nswr as many questions as possible , a try to partipate in las discussions .

This is a very comon argument : t tue geis stans t so much th n ot be msunderstod , so if he is not recognized hen he is not a genius .
Bt this is fuly reasonig : it ccpt t idea that a enus is lays recognized on h bsi that in story geniuses hv always bee recognized - which is ot true , or at least is not eonstrable .
hey tak for ranted that historically eniuses ave aways een recognied , but in realty ey are only talki about geniuses that , in ac , hae be recognied .
Thy know nothing of those h ha not ben recognized and that may have been completl erased rom hstory , and herefore ca not be used as an opposite example .
To u up , because t geniuses that we ha decided to recognize as such have ben reognized , the are hat a the niuses re aways recognize : pur self - refential nonsense .

Some ay think th it is beer to have casse wth discussion of profsor and udent .Oters may disagre .
The prefr classes wih lecte and alst no discussion .
In my opinin classes ith discusson ae better .
Fit , class with dicussion between professor and student ha an dvantage o he sudent because the lea how to interact with her llow stdnt .
Doubtless , such ineractions ih oter people will help o to broadn yu mind ad learn new thigs .
This wi enrich your pesonlity .
For instance , a year ba I was in nrth Txs university in USA , there s a alth manaement and policy css with alst no cture but th lot of time for open discussions .
In the beginning , I though hi was disavanage but this was ot true .
On on day we spoke out medical treatment cos in dferent counr a one of my frend , ole was from Niria .
Cosequenly , he was abe to te us how the cost of the treatment r les , how doctors are dedicated , and how everybody hs access to prmary hlth care .
As a rsul we al know what to be doe so that we an make little changes in e reform to essn he cost of te treatment .
As yo an ee , pe dicusion in th lass are elly impoant sic ty braden ur horizon and help you to understand different nation 's policies .
Seod , pn discussion in the cls hep you to evelop certin skills in order to become an independent thier and speaer .
It is evident that independent peaking a thiking sills ar valube fo your career .
or instance , I s really afraid of seakin in fot of many peol .
oweve , this health management n policy clas with oe discussion as helpful or me insofar as I arned o to pek in frt of other .
In order to get good grades we are frce to participate in discussion .
As a result I ovecom my anxiety n tarted speaking in ront of tos students d I fund ts not difficult as I expected .
Th experiec augh me ha it is eter ti prticpate in a class with oe discussio becase it provide you with speaking ad thiking bilitie which are imperative for your aeer .
All in all thouh some my opos my opinon , it is clear that lasses wit oe discussion a almost no lecture are reerable bcuse interaction wih other student wl broaden your mind nd ou become a better speaer and thinkr .
Tha is why eer niversit soud ofe suh classs .

o woke up as a beam of sunlight lanted throuh a rac in the wall of the old cain .
He stared at the clock hanging in the al an frowned .
It was late , and there was a lot of work to do , so he 'd btte catch up .
By te te he arrved at he rivershore , some of his clleagus were already digging he itch .
Te river s flowing dow wit ret noise , nd its level was lowly rsng up , as it had been happening for th lat few days .
he crops mit be floded vy soon if they dd n't do anting to avoid it .
Everybody was the : e Smiths , ith their three bro - shouldered so ; th Newtons , who ve brought sm of their stallions to ep us reme e earth and the stons ; and th sli guy who lived in t farm in t northern hills of h vlle and who name nobody kne .
They wrked all day log , restlessly , until hey er breathless n their nds we bleeding .
Ten , thy wored a bit ore .
Finally , Tom could hear Matthew houting fo the other side of e fid .
The decided to stop util the next dy , as h d a almost finished .
He gazed at it , a bit rried about the posibiliy of mor aining during the night , but proud of hain put te farm in heter .
It had ben a vey long a tirn day , t o felt he had acievd someting really od .
We uan eing are highly socialied cretue in he world .
Therefore , it is ievitable hat we hve to learn to be par of the scity .
Prents , in some cases , e mentors to childre .
However , cnsidering t complexity of t socity , I beieve it bette to ern in schoos rater than from parents .
First of all , tere is no denying that arents may teach the chilren enormous fundamnal ivin skll , on which teir progeny count .
Nevertheless , the skills are ot diverse nough or chlden to deal with secific problems wn lving in a ompex socety .
F examle , one of my senior high scool 's classmat had encountered communictio problem involved in e ther 's family .
As a conseuenc , they never ak to eah othr inc then .
Following t preous pargrph , there will always be people of ifferent livng syes , attides , and beliefs in vry spct of ne 's life .
Hae we o lie an learnd the skils in a grop , especially in school , we wil n be skilled efor entering e socity .
The society as a whole is a pae where ot copetition a cooperation take tn continuously influne every member .
If we only lv in our oriinal famil , parents wl probably forgive us hn we make istake .
In contrast , living in a society is another ory : people mght blame , cmpete , or ve hurt thers no matt w ou are .
Lering in schools , hwevr , provde valuable opportunity r children to lea not only from teachers , but alo om relationships between peers , and as a result , proves te wy for being independent in te future .
In a nutshell , hre is a great del of knowledge needs to be gained for hilren in ord to live in a ciety .
chool , a place wi divrse sudents along wih teir attitude towards lives , might be ette th learning merely with the arents .
T best sprt in the world .
Have you ever tried unsuccessfully mre than 5 sports in on ne month ?

If u like te grt viws from a high hill , as el as having a relaxing time wh ourself or sarig it ih ohr peple , gof is the perfect sport for you .
h only disadvantage I coul find is ha golf is n't such a cheap sprt to do , as it reqirs a o of expene a als a good menal nd pschologica halth , which is the first hig I recmend to work on if you wnt to ejoy golf rom he beginning .
However , as lng as you can affrd it and you 're provided with atence an enthusiasm , y shuld n't miss t oportunity to pa is amazing sort .

Sometimes it seems to me that there is an ocean outside .
It swly rustles and claters ad it 's pulsig waves atact so much ha you ca n't stand sitting still much loger d o are ready to throw up everything d run towards it .

Long befre r journey I knew that I would love this cntry , I woul fl in love with ocean ad sea on for all .
I wa wrong only aout one ting : I h loved it lg ag .
I a been adoring the s and dreaming abu it when I had nvr see it beore , never her it before , but definitely et it t by skin but my hat .
We spen tn days on e Atlantic seaboard , in a smal town - C√°i .
The main avantage of it is tt h ocean is awys near at hand , no matter in what part of the wn yu e .
Lk in all t seaside tns , it 's always windy there .
e wind is often sron and old , n it blows off as n tousle th hair in sh a way th it ca n't be combed a more .
So , that 's why I gave up the de to do it and decded to be a shaggy - gil= )
Also I rememb wea perfume of Spanars ( and San itself ) , spreading through te sreets of old town n mxing with the sll of fri fish th is ready to be sere in uerous br , cafes a restaurants .
I remember he wamth of twilight wnc lure you to the hert of this to .
I remember the lauh of eple , sitting at the tables and chatting .
I remember children , runnig about the small squares in fof of t cathedral ; elderly peopl in wheelchair ...
All tese memries r always with me , d to go hrough tm ain I do n't een nd to cloe my eys , everything in my mind heart is oo ivid to forget .
Tdy I am riting about earnin aother laguage .
It could sm something very useful , wih no drawbacks , but each oin as a head an a tail .
Learning anothr language is a wnderul way of learnig about another counry .
Chc the languages you kno and comare te to th eple fom tose countries .
A language it is te capital hng to learn beause it is he way people commuicate ad organize hei thoughts .
Furhermre , it gies ou the chance to enoy th works done in ha lnguage .
ht 's an incredible opportunity .
Neetheless , wh you are learning a language , it brings cofusion .
Yo eed to change th ay you organize yor thoughts in order to ster it .
On the one had h old on culd be hr wired nt your brain .
On h oth ha , the new language neds an additinal effor .
It also s anotr neative effect , ou have limte tim on th plnet .
There ar an incredible amount of higs to earn .
W would you waste yo time lerning a n lauage , when you robably do nt know enogh about your own .
In summry , learning a language is something eautiful , seful and entertaining .
It an be hard nd it ha t downside .
Bt , as a laner of my third lnguag , I am a firm beliver it is t riht choice .

Is chane always od ?
hage is always od .
Bu sometime the ce of change , the irection of change or th consequences of change can make it no god at l .
Le implies hange .
No change , no lie . atue is fe and death , costrction n desruction .
No hange , no Nature .
To op e change is impossible Tha would be against Nature an against ourselve .
Every hman ctio rovkes a action .
Evry sige word cues a gesture , a hoght , a chane in the others .
ery step marks a fotrint in th ground .
h smallest wo cnges the enironment .
Any desion chane futue .
Life is chang .
B this change h a rhth and it is better to repect it .
Li ad change hve alo a directon , an ai : gowth .
Everthig that does n't go is dead , and death is the opposite of life .
To inhibit the gwth of a living being is a cruelty , but sometimes it happens .
Think of those hinee women oblied to constrain the feet .
Thnk of the Olympic Champion Naia omaneci , artiiially stopped in er phsical development to prerve her graful childih body .
Equll cruel , it is , in my opinion , to accelerate he pace of growh by forcing .cildren to ok like dult or by inducing little girls to ress and behave as femmes fatales in ieo - clips or magazine cver .
Nature is so change , b in a cycling directon , n in a natural rhythm : t movement of celestial bodies , the rotation of Earth , the alternation of days an nihts , t sequence of season ‚Ä¶ , in short , th weel of life .
We lived in a time of accelerated chanes .
Technology allows us to do an learn in one life 's time more ting tn our ancestors were able to in svera generations .
But at h same me we are working against aure - let 's tnk of pollution and clmate change - nd aanst o own man naure : distress , allergies , strokes a heart attacks e nowadays more n more reuent .
I tnk we shoul readjus the rhythm of chae in order to be able to reinterret , in a positi sense , Lampedusa wrs " everyhing mu change so that everything c stay the se " .

What is cultural literacy ?
I was researchng sm definitions of cultural iterac .
It seems to me tt the following definitions show an ovall context of what is cultural literacy .
Cultural literacy is the abilty to nderstan and participate fluently in a gve culture .
Culturl lteracy is Knowin abot and respeing the cultures of others .
In order to be ulturally iterae , you ned to be amiliar it al manner of things , frm Wterloo , Hamlet and " Call me Ishmael , " to the Wife of Bath , the Man Cata , Tutankhamen , e Pythagorean Teorm an 1066 .
To be famiar wit somehing is fa diffeent from ein an expert in it , nd it 's entirel mnaeable .
A litate rader nows t object - languge 's alphabet , grammar , and a sufficient se of ocabulary ; a cuurally litere persn knows a givn culture 's sgns ad symbols , incldin its langue , particular dialecti , sores , entertainmnt , idioms , idiosyncrasies , nd so on .
The culturally literate person is ale to talk to a udertand others of that cultre wit fluency , while th cuturlly illerate peron fails to understand culturally - conditiond allusons , reerencs to pa events , idomaic expressions , jokes , ames , placs , etc .
According to UNESCO litercy is at h hat of asi eduaion f l and ta creaing litrate environments and societies is ssentia o chievin h goals of eradicating poverty , reducing child mortality , curbing poplaion groth , acheving gender equality and cheve sustainable development , peace ad democracy .
My persoal opiin culural iterac is the way to understand , learn d kno about oter culture .
Also yu can be undrstoo by other cultus .
Nwaday , th majoit of tengers are not so lse ih eir amiles as ty ud to be n mostly hey are farher apart from their arnts .
The g betwee 13 to 19 is the revolutionary one .
It has bn shown that they gt along tter wt thei siblins than teir arens .
I share this opinion wh e revolutionary ones .
I gt alng wth my siblngs very el but we do not see eah other very uh .
As a result , we often communicae and we do not exchange pinons as much as othe families do . I do ot consider them to be my bet friends because I can not peak with them as freely as with my friend .
ot to mention that when I am trying to talk to them they aays space t and then y tht they have their own problem .
That really ge on my nerves .
A friend wil sta on and lien to u in patience .
To su up , I do o consdr my family to be my best riends and neiter th do .
I think it is fair to sy basketball is on of the mst ppular srts on the planet , oth in numer of viewer and pyers .
There is probably an array of motives to exlain sc peomenon but for me tha happens for n prticlar reason ; the shot clock .
The sot clock is a timer that dicttes the amount of tme during which one tea an maintain possession of h bal .
Th de behind it is to qickn the ce of the game n preventig it from becoing talled .
A corious fact is that ou of the five mot popular sorts in te orld only basketball eeps trk of posesson time and to me th 's xactly what sets him apart from the others .
Whe watching or payin any kind of sport , here 's nothing rse ha a tm or a plyer trying to ste tme untill the clck runs ut , th ame ecomes dll an borin a yo ca n't ejo t xcitmet that only te pempo styl of play an provide .
T bottom le is ; a fst paced gam is a uch more ecting experince for players and viewers as opposed to a slow aced o an tt maks the " hot ock " fundamenta to the dynamics of the game .
And for anyone trying to beome a good basketball plers the t mos mporant thing to understand ( as it is for most pors in general ) are te values of practice and aareness .
Practice is t one thing that can increase e pobability of esreable results d awaenss is hat gives o te ability to apt to ifferent situation , n the combinati of t tw is h only way to success , so if yu want to be a goo player you ned to put your energy and fus on practice an stay alert and surveing t court at all ims so o ca be aare of what is appening aroun you .
me pole claim that the yoh of today is less hethy than he wre two decades ag .
Although several causes f his problem ca be ound in t modernisation of our soiety , this modern society n lo prvid olutions for the amelioration of t leve of itness of young people .
n of te reasons o th worsening of t health of young people is the increasing use of cars .
Nwaays , prents ta their children everywere by ca , werea they would av to go everywhere by bike or by foot weny eas ago .
Ths is a result of the decreasing price of cars du to inovaton in h ar ndusty , wich enald more ad more people to buy a r ( and use it ) .
oweve , possbiliies to make t oth heathier ae also provided by our modern civilisaion .
F example , commercials c be used to stmulate yungstrs to tak up exercise by showing he positive effects .
In concluion , I eel that not on he ground fr h o level of fitness of today 's yoth , but also te clue to g yougstes iter , es in the mdernity .
Go hriller movies have become increasinly rare in he last w years , and to find some amo big productions cstng famous acos is eve harder , if not impossible .
Most of thee , in fact , ave very predictable plots , are full of clihes and sice it 's so eay to figr u how they will n , they a sally vey boring .
Ti is why I a very srprised wn I came out of the theate aftr eeing " Looper " an thought " y , I jst w a thrlle ith Brce Will in it , and it was tually a realy good one ! "

My xpetations wre no very high , but I have to y h moe s surprisingly go , in fact it was no borg at al , and ad a fw bi twists which took me ompletey by surprise .
Tm travelling is ol a mean to the devlopent of th story , d e future ociet is quite simir to the resen one , so even if you are not big sciece fiction fans , I sugst o give hi movi a chance , I am re you wo n't be disppinted .
In the compeitive wod tat we inhabit , dominating a techique and havin a deep knowledge of a give feld is essential for both academic nd rofesional ucces .

The iherent tendency to pvide te best to our offspring catalyze parents to invest in tei kids as to prepre them for an unpredictable future .
T hste that results from this procss doe n't allow parents to thnk over sm potentially harmful myths that they tae for reality , egarless tht it y compromie teir kid 's motivation and ef - confidence , all becaue of hir " is talent nate or can it be acquire ? " .
Contemporarily , the most ide - spread blef is ta some people are brn with a talent ad some unlucky oe simply are n't .
Tis assertion ma boost the confdene of parents whose children show a remarkable ability in th erl infancy , as though this capablity could be he celestial sign that their toddler is gifted or gon to gow as chil prodigy .

The normal response to this conclusion is , as I an may pele who gae up learning a language simy becaus fluency is o of each if you do n't have this ie vailabl , is the ls of otivation .

Although educated peope in the past h e same desre to larn as educated pele today , tos who wr onsidered educated in he past oul be considered less educted today .
That 's becae there 're many cientfic acts have been evealed .
Furthermor , information about ese acts have become mc mor availbe .
Also , pople tday tend to get highr degres than people in the past .
T great expansion of knowledge aes peope more educad than befr .
Tody , eople know mre about pheomna ht wr onsiered obscre in the past .
For eampl , people today kw or aout pace , genetics , and diseases .
Ta makes them mor eduated .
Furthemoe , it 's easy to kow about these valuable isoveries .
There 're many me libaries and learnng curss available than before .
In aditio , information abot anythin ca be fund easily on the Internet .
In th as , gradatng fo high school a considered an achievement ; tday it 's o .
To be considered ll edated , people should grauate fr a college .
lo , there 're oe peop who ontnue thei edcatin ater gaduation from college .
In conclusion , te averag lvl of education in the past is n't enogh tody to be considered educated .
Ti winr , I may be able to trav to Cornwall , UK .
Going to the UK hs been a dream of mine but goi to Corwall , hoever , might be a litte of an eapade dring the wnter , considering that I 'm ony used to th relatively hot Egyptian weahr .
I have ead that ornwall is usually flooded in inter , and that the weather mgh make transportation a pin .
Hwever , I 'm interested & excied but h jorny bause it wl allow me to have a myriad of new experieces .
On the other han , I hea people e generally onvival and naue is beautiful in Cornwall .
I oe ta my fortitude will hlp me urng ts ort sojourn .
My life has been on a boring plateau for a while o nd I s ookng r a chane as well as mor personal ureon .
A historical place of importance in my country .
There is a place , in my country , which played a vry imprtant rle drig old Ward II .
is is a frest , crosed by he border betwee France an Switzerland .
As it as ull of spruces , it was ea to ide frm t Grman atrols and people from both sides of h bodr helped Jewish , spies and English , Canadian or American pilots to fl through Switzerland .
A n oo pla from Sou of France to Sitzerland , spscially to t to save thousands of Jeish children .
People w participate to that " way to fredo " ner ask anything in exchange .
They did it feey .
They ever spoke about it tl a few ars ag , as tey were considered like riminas by heir conries as they had broken the law ding ha time .
But nw , they tol the whoe world about it , some of te re n cnsdered as heroes in Insrael for wha they i uing these ad times .
Their sry a written and folks fnlly could dicove wha happened thee between h ears nineteen thrty - ne and ninteen fty - five .
Last month a moument ws rected in their memory so that nobody forgets wa happened in tha large forest here - as the people wol say in that time - German oldiers can n guard all wo , ulss they tood ehind each spruce ....
Nwaday , pulic transprt is a usful and onveniet way of travelling , especially for studens , pele with low socioconomic tatus or for everyone who ants to go to work or school by bus , tai or by subway .
It 's also true ha re people have cr tn aye 30 of 40 yers go .
ars are a goo way of saving me epcially whn waitng o ublc tanport , maily , bus .
Bt a disadvantag it ha cars maineance and g is or expensive than paying or pulc transport .
On he ther hand , car ae always there wn you nd thm and ou do n't have to depend on nyting when you have a car .
Airplanes ar becoming more an more useful f peole wo travel fo rk or even want to ge to anoter pace quicker an fer .
I ao think that thee woul be ewer eple usin pblic ranspot in the ftur bu om il still be available because it wo n't be possible for everyone to afford to have a ar or travelling by plane .
As in al educational rocesses , assessment of he programme planning must ake place .
here are dfferent ideas to be considere as far as assessment is cocered .
In t rst place , we hve to know why we evluate .
The unction of evalation and assessment mt not only be the recgnition of h rsuls of the learning process itlf , t alo ho his press to place , therefre we wi ned to s diferent instruments of ssesment .
After e assesment an evaluation we will be ae to adjust he neessar pedagogic elp to idividul students , nw up to which point the poposd aims ae ee acived and we ill be able to jde the progmme planning as a whole .
Assessment a evaluation ill provid information , as wl fr the eaher as o the students .
T eacher ill udertand the student 's difficulties bette ; s / he wi know h level of ssimilation of the dffeent kids of contents nd be ae to modify futue pogramme lanning .
As fr as t sudent are cocerned , they wi be able to correct inadequate strategies or ehavour , no th ifficulties te encounter in te laring - teaching procs and evaluate their proper pocess .
ecndly , we must be sure of wh to ases and evaluate .
As to the students , we ill ave to cnsider e knowledge and sils they have acquired , their attitudes an their soial behavor .
As to the techer , we will find out whete the programme panning as adeqate or ot ad if s / he s sufficiently impied in te learning - teaching process .
Tirdl , we ave to keep in ind th instruments for asessmet and evaluatn we are gog to use .
r our programme plnning , we propose the following instruens or techniques :
Sciet is continually haning , ever since we crate the firs civilizaons .
However , it h a special importnce nowdays , in a orld tt moves so quickly .
The fir thing that come to mind on his subject is tecnoloy .
It has sc a quick growth ta it 's impossibl to predict w much transformation it will suffer .
It should mak a l of tasks easier and more ficient t , apr frm tt , I do n't expect it to have a de impact on or lives , onsiering oter aspets that will certainly overcome ts one .
Tt brings us to seond point : resources .
As the population row eponentially , te resoces fl to go along .
We hav jst started worrying about that t th atons in course are fa from enough .
h rd truth is ha until somnoe has to face the situation hislf , it 's qite dfficut to restrai frm wasting eery , food , materials , wat ...
ut in the ner futre most of us wil have to del with it and terfore be forcd to mae dramatic changes in r livs in der to urvie .
Fially , and on a more poitive ton , we 're walking towards a gobl ord .
This mns brders re getting hinner n thinner , and cultures oe nd mre siilar .
As thi m cue us to lose traditions and clturl identity , it will einitely bring mor pportunitie or veryone .
De Jo ,
It 's rat to ar from you !
It 's really god ta you 're coming to Urgua , I would be pleas to elp o .
Frst of l , ther are a lot of aces to visit here and I uld like to ake you to , Punta del Este , Piriapolis , Cabo Poono , La paloma an oth eautifl ples .

The pupils hve been taught English since hei vry firt meeing wi e Enlish language in shol so they are cometely faliar in uing Engish as classroom language .

The evaluation starts by unfolding the brain storm fom a 1 , and then it coninue by he pupils applying all their new wor and knowledge bout America .
Hereby we want to ceate consciousness in the pups'minds about their nw knwledge .
The e of the evaluain is that every pupi wrte a os - it note that answers the ollowing questns : What ae I learned from ti course ?

Wh people ecom homeless ?
Oe of the rasns is te ar pr ecaue tey can not t a job .
I eieve we cn decline e nber of homeless peop in Japan by providng them with information ad kills .
Thos wh bcome homeless usually do nt know that thr is a system to hel poor pepe .
For exmpl , if they do nt ha enough money that is eded to hve home and to buy thins necesary to live , they can gt a financial support by government .
Howve , those wo do not knw about it c not get such support .
Homeless pele ed to unable to collect informatn because of ak in eans to do it .
We nd to let them ge information .
Skills re lso neded to ge a job .
The skills include th ability to cmunicate with people and to cnqur hrdships .
I have seen a TV program abot hmeless people .
In the program , n homess man quit i ob becaus he cold not have a good reationshi in the ffce .
He tried svral jobs b he could communicate well in none of them .
He was tred of hmsef , ost interest in orking ad became hmeess .
The , he came to know ht thr a a class ta rovide homeless people with skills of lening floor f free .
He decided to join he clss .
Smetimes the lesson s hard , t th staff tere paised im when he id wel .
Little by little , he grew intert in woing .
He came to no ow pleasant it is to overcome hard situations .
He as learned to o to build a go relationship wih pople through talking his fellows .
He finally waed to find a job ain .
If ore lessons like this are provided n more homels people gt the skills , the proem of homelessness will beco ls serious .
To conclude , givig infrmation out support hat they c receive from the government , an skil is vry helfu way to slve homeessness in Japn .
At e momnt , a goernents around e world argue about climate change .
Som of them tink global warming is t ot significant problem , depite thers believ deforetation h a higher impac on our wor .
w I ll discus both sides .
On the e hand , global warig is a result of many emtte oxic gases .
hese are , fr example , carbon dioxide a methane .
As we all know , res store arbon dioxide .
So , we cn s , with less deforstaton there would be less global warming .
Bt at are the results of glbal warng ?
h prary outcom is h increasing teperatre , n this lads to melting glaciers .
Thee glaciers a abita for plr bers and many othr arctic anmal .
Th melting lcier il bring a highr sea lvl .
That means ostal cities wil be flooded .
This flooding lea to stavaton because of fewer avest yields nd tis creates many refugees .
On the other hand deforetaton is , as said , anthe pa of gobal wamig d to less carbon dioxide storing trees .
Bu ncinrate a uge part of he rainforest ans a destrucion of t habitat of willife .
Glbal warming is a primary cause of starvaio u also es deforestation .
Because the roots do ot od h fertile soil , nd now , it will be blown away by the wnd .
To sum up oth isues have normou impacts on r world .
In oth animals n people are affectd .
B in my oinion , you can stop global warming by topping deforestation first .
Te y can focus on global warming .
Michael ad Ccilia had ee maried fr 6 years .
Even though their couple was of e quarelling type , everyne around them , fried and family agree on te fact that the pi as as sod as a rc , an despite he up and dwns , lov had always o in th nd .
B smetmes , Micael a a tendency to go too r with his word .
d each time it occurred , Ccilia burst in ters , and Miche a to ro h sobbig wif like a bb .
Thy ad kept ting to have a baby r yars , u espite thi attempts , no child vr ame .
Michael grew btter .
He was torturing Ccilia with proaches .
On night he wet away slamming te door , ill cursig while running dn the stairs .
It tok him ree days to am down nd u the tins in pespecive .
We he finally came back hme , his wife was nowhee to be see ... Michael ruse to e bedroom .
Going straight to the wardrobe , he opened i door .
It as pty ...
Michael losd th door and knw at that moment he ad ade a mitake .
Nowadays , exerence is more mportant thn academic knwledg to gi a job .
mployes ty to find eployees that have practical sils rather tn omal quaifications .
owevr , expeience is extremely important , I disagree tha the academics are not imprtant .
First of all , formal education is essental or empoyee , it is consderd as a fundamental basis of n pracical job .
Suces in a jb dpeds on th amount of thoretical nowlede tha a person ha in academic institution .
In addition , very phenomenon is based on theory .
Wn eployees face any problm or diffilties in work , it ust be rfered to te heor that explain this phenomenon , without kning thi theoy employees ca n't overcome these difficltie , o instance , engnering scince sems practical , but each pat of ngieering sciece is bsd on theories .
Thereby , engneers must take deandng knowledge to be successful in a career .
Second of l , heoretical ulifications ar crcial for employees , as it heps t people to tink ad ove all problem in a fair w .
Scienific approch is more importan to del with problems , beginning with determining probles nd te studying all factors nd related nfomation .
Then employees e ae to suget the bst solution , this approach is developed in frmal education .
Moreover , tudyng in a uiversity provides an opprtunit to interact wi a wide range of ople and thu build unique communication skills ha a very impotant for employees .
Finally , knowledge could ae an pen - mine pson who has abilty to dea with prolms in fairwy .
To coclue , theoretical knowledge is more imortant than ractical skills .

Some people are convinc ha public transport has no futue beaus he car is so much more convenient .
Thee is more than one ay to lo at this statement .
The e of public transport hs a l of advanges , ut on e othr hd , ome disadvantages c be distinguished .
It depends on where a wat kin of place o ant to reach n it deends on the time of th day
In this aticl both sides a discussed .
Frs what are e advantages of uig the bus , or trai ?
When trveling to city cntes , choosing public tansport is to be advised , because parking a car in e ci is ally expensive d it is vry ar to find a space .
When in te cnter ad wanting to enjoy various sights , by r it is hd to g from on place to t other , because the ircuation is dene .
IN that wy it will tae a l of ou ti , while the us or raway have teir o bus lans , and hence are running smoothly .
In ha se the choice f blic transport will be referable .
We traelig to rural reas , it is uie diffiult by public transport , beaus ometims there is hardy ay no tan or bu for te far out paces a the tin villages .
Aother robem might be the timetable .
Because not a eole ging to these place , th schedu wl be very tgt d the bus will only leave once every hr .
If there is a bus or tain aailble , it wll sp at almost every illag .
Mot of tese buses will make ay sos whh makes it ve more time onsuming .
In th end of the d you should choose public transport or car accring to the purose of your tp .
nd sometimes plic transport is better and omeimes sing th car is betr .

Strongest allegation on the Jra system or ' inrmal justce sstem ' has been t unfairness against innocents durin e course of decisions and execution on variey of its rules n regulations .

Scendl , wih the increasing of t earth 's population , the aea of farland is als decreasing .
Pple in economically developed rea are in the pursuit of the perct lfe and the people in h ndevelopd areas a strving .

Very ofen peop say " Fmiy is the most important thing in fe " or " My family is my biget support " , and I agree .
Whe something mportant hppens , the frst prson I will ll is a ember of my famly .
Bt th , evry one an a while , oe cn aso hear store of brthers fighting over the nheriance , or a parent not speaking to their chd for mkin a wrong life decision .
In the maorit of cass , memers of a famil hve the same blood nd genes n they also share living ace .
This reslt in common opinions , support when there 's a problem and mual understaning witout ny word .
On the othr hand , we tnd to have iher expectations and ss patience he it coe to ur loved oe .
The mmber of or famly in ded are yor st frends , u only if yu do n't take them or granted , if you respect hm and their space d opion .
One should also bear in nd that omtimes it 's necsary to copromise , especially when it comes to material or fiancial issues .
Once ou accet tht your sibing , although similar , is n't the sa as ou , or that your chld has a differt view on thir future , it 's easier to ebrac the dffernces an be a supportive family member .

Computer 's have become an essential pr of our lves in the lt few decae .
Ty have replaced ay things ik books .
It is true tt because of computers , we do an thig st d aily .
owever , ey stopped us fro dng mny fun things as well , what ar tho things , do we really need computers , e the really hping us ?
We use computers to he us with so may differen types of things .
To begin with , thy hp us solve really complex mathematical equations .
Te were invnted to help us calculate thigs in the first place anyway .
Compers are an essential rt of NAS , since they ry to clculat rally omple equations to help he solve the mysteie of sace .
But us , ordinary people , do n't se omputers to sol equatins , we use them to type things , print things , esgn thing , ma game and to do much me ...
We mae prgras ha ak omputes do very interesting things , like graphics .
A we se graphics to me ll kinds of thgs , like games or 3D ous models that help enginees .
rthermore , he mjor thin that computers made easr f us is , communication .
Hmans are social animals , we communicate cause communication is in our gnes , if we do n't communicte we go isan .
So computers hel us do tht , ty hel us share or toughs ad feelings with other pople eaily .
Finly , while doi hs the actually save us from usin a lot of paer .
So coputers help us with so any tngs nd alo save tres .
In the other an , computers ve very ba effects on bt to us , and h envroment .
o example , research ha hown that not cmputers theselve , b the thngs we use or pla on hm re addictive , lke social netwrks or gams .
Also looking at a screen is tirng fr ur es a if ur eyes t oo tired hey a et damaged foever .
Depte th act that computs decreased h use of paper , they 're still harmful to the enironmnt since the conume tonnes of electrciy .
Computers made our lies easie without doubt , so it is nrmal that th have soe ad ffecs .

Scools and working lif : a report
To the Italian eucation athorities
In this repot , I will decribe the schol system in my country , point u it laws n conclude giving suggestions bot ow they coud be addressed .
Th currnt ituation
In Ita , students have to decde btween grammar chools n tehical inttutes as thir secnday school te .
Most people think that choosi a ammar school is the bet opton , because it opens te door to niversiy , while technicl institutes a u in a crner .
Tt is tually a mistake , bcaus the schools who best prepare stdets to working life are technical institutes , wo emhasize h re world applcations of he studd ujects through laboratories and indusry experinces .
nversely , graar schools extremey focs on theory .
In fact , stdnts learn lots of forula ad princiles wihou actually liking them it one another in order to se te in el fe .
I tin ht problem sold be addressed .
Suggestions
What I would ugget in order to deal wh this probl is to itegrate me labratory expeience also in ramma schools , like cemistry exerimets or bactria oservatio wih micoscope .
Futhermore , schools shoul offer a yar in idusty for students in the last two yers , which wold t only teac hm a lo more tha school only would , bu it would ao attract more pele to the schol itself .
Cnclusion
People should get sd to the fact tat mst companies will also cre about your previous work experience , and the ide of gaining ha hrough chool wld be really appealing .

Subjects that sould be tught at school .
Nody a argue with the ft at educatio is a relevant priod in t development of a child .
Laning nw languages is very important , but also studying subjcts elted to comuter an technology like comter programming is ecomig oe and or usefl tn acien langages like Greek or Ltin .
hs is beause tecnology ha become a relevant too fr or d std in particular an an important instrument in lfe in general .
It is quite edent that learnn ancet languges toda is ot as relevant as it is used to be in te past .
On one hd , it allows the students to undrstand an translate acient texts and elps them to arn about cuture from the pas .
On th other hand , thi de not bring too many mloyment opportuities .
Recent surveys poved that the study of the anguaes does not add mh to th sdents future sccess .
Reted to learnng computer programming , it uaantees a od living .
It is a nown fac that there are very few compur pogrammes .
Furthemore as technology chane more and mre , there will be a greaer demand of ese sils in h futue .
It is evident that technology is in every asct of our livs .
In conclusion , here are a lot of ubjects ta might be ught at school , but there is no doubt tha Comutr Progrmming soud be included as a higlihted subject in te syllabus of ay scol seios programme .

Whe they droped ter second bum , I ws so excited about it and I waited like 2 hous on the ine of a music sop to get it . Years passed by , an I was still a fn of them , as I am w .
I ae been ollowin hem most 6 yers in a row !
I ca n't wait for tem to go bak to l the stges and arenas to sing , becaue I 'm going to their 2017 or 2018 tou no matter wa , as I did back in 2012 d 15 .
Groban : All that ecoe
' All that echoes ' , by Josh Grban , is the sixth studi album of ths American singer and sogwrier .

If ou offer me the chance to join your team , you shall o be dsppointed .
I would appreciate a rey at your erlies convenience .
Please cntct me regarding any quere you may have .
Yors sincerely ,
Thse days , travelling by c is ecming ore popular amng uran people .
Ths knd of traspot is egaded as a covenint way .
Governmnt build moe roas ad more families e abl to afford ca .
As a resut , som people hol te opinion ha in he utur , there il be no publc transport .
However , I disgree wt this da .
Instead , I suppose that pblic transprt will play an esenial part in future life .
Ther are thr advantages of pbli ansport over priate cars hat I ant to explain .
On one hand , it is evirnmentally fredly to us public transport rther than cars .
Nowadays , buses uing eletronic powr inted of petrol ae appeared in urban cites .
Tey produce no gas to te air , leading to lite ai polluton .
In the eanhile , if peole prefe to take bses or subways , there will be es noises in the stret .
On e ote han , buses nd subways can accommoate mo passengers while a cr an nl contains 4 to 5 people totally .
Compad wt cs , public rnsport has laer capability of conveing , which saves ace nd costs ss .
Last but t least , fwer r acident will hppen if eople chos to use public transport so trafic jams wl be avoided especially in rush hours .
Thu , it wil be moe smooth and pleasnt for passengers to trave on e ro .
In conlusio , pubic transpot is a cost - ffectve ay or pople to travel , whch also cntribute to th sstainable development of socit .
" ducational institutions have a responsibility to dissuade studets fom ursing fils of study in wich hy are unlikly to succeed . "
The statement claims hat the educational intitutions are responible for onvining tuents o to put too much efot on fies or subjects ha he e ot good at , whh I can not gre with .
This statement fails to consider the main functn of eduation , which is ot training superstars or efect robos u teaching tudents o to face n slve e problems thy are confroted instead of cape .
Th esponsibility of education institutions should be heping and guiding udents to ak their own deisions , n maing ecisions f students .
Among various purpose of eduation , in my opinions , he mst imporan on is teaching students to olve prolems .
Confronting he challenging instead of turnig aside , trying to think of possible solutions instead of giving up at te beginning , always being posiive to unknw istea of negative ad retreating , all thee are th main reason hy h humankinds cn keep improving .
Tranferring thes knowleg and experiences to yung pepe is the meanig of education .
If the educational instiutins always stopped students om tying ju ecaue they hae ls chance to be successful , we 'll never hve people such as hoas Edon or bert Einstn , h were considrd as stpid kids in chol u d n't give up trying .
Convincing students to ae a more comfortable ro by gving up th possible risk is definitely n he proper attitde the educational institutin soul hae .
n may sggest that veryone need to ler to sess the rs before inves , hever , teching stuents how to assess not assessing f stdents is he resonsibility of ductional instiutons .
Truy that knowing one 's limit is t irst step of brining out the mximum vle of one 's tent .
It 's not sma to encourage people doing wt xceed their ability .
Nevertheless , t ability of idetifying limi of onesef ca be be learned from eperiences .
One wld never knw he / she n swim or not withou umpng io t siming pol .
The respoibility of the educational istitutions is to make sure ha he / h wo n't be in danger in the swimming pool instead of dissuadi him / h fo gting close to the water .
Educatina intitution should guid stuents to ave better el - understanding and elf - asessng , n persuading he to fllo the pre - decided road .
Las bt no eat , what is the definition of " ucces " ?
How do the educational institutions judge a student ein likely to succed or ot ?
Wt if a student would ather to do smethig he / she likes intead of he / h is gd at ?
o everyone is lving for t kind of succes whih mo pepl gree wth , such as wealh , fame or power .
o some peopl , liing a lfe which enable hm do what the like and like what they ae oin is enough to be considred as a successul lfe .
They might not be the top , bu they are self - actualed d stisfie , and only in uh situation they ca provid most to the word , just like Albert Einstein a si , " y n to becom a man of sucess b rather to become a man of valu . "
Considerng all the above , I can t agree with e sttemnt that persuading student no to pursu fed of study in ich they have ss possibility to be successful is the esponsibility of e educational institutions .
In my opinios , t purpose of th education is to teach n uie studnts hw to fing the problems a mkig the ow deiion properly , not force them to accept what have alredy been arraned or them .

For last ten years Michael h be woing in a ell - kno comay in Ldon as an accoutat .
He did like is job u as we all kw , someties people suddey fee th ha to chang something .
They do n't know exactly what they houd do , wat to change - buy a e pai of shes or mayb do something more - oe to a differen ci or ven to a freign couty .
Mchael ad exactly the ae problem .
On da he woe up much earier than used to .
He prepad a offe for himlf and turne he TV on to watch he nes .
He sat on a sofa in front of a television ad uddeny he realised he fact tt every mornig ws xctly the same , othng has changed snce su many years ! "
I wo n't stand it y loge " - he thought .
u what to do ?
A czy idea came to his min .
Sinc Michael a a chi he has alays drem of oing to Ausraia , where he oul ractse kitesurfing for l da long , meet open - minded people , chill on a sady beah ad drik a oo Australian alcohol .
" Why should n't I give myself a chance to me my dreams come true ?
Peope hve only n lfe , not more ! "
At that moment he was prety sure hat to do now .
He tok a heet of paper n a pen and strted to write .
Afte 10 minutes a resigntion ltter s ready to bring it to icael 's os .
He arrived on te compay as qikly as the crowded London 's strets llowd i .
" I nd to talk to bs " - he said to Jne , h main sertary of e company .
Without waitg for her answer , he jut nt to the office , gave to ike , his boss for 10 years , an envelope with a resintion leer and lf .
It a tok aout 3 inute .
Michel closed the dr and kew at that momnt he d made a mistke .
Soetimes we do things we do n't want fr no apparent reason bu some other tmes we know exactly were we ar gting to .
Michael had cheate on hr ad he did it consciously .
There ws no way to shine a ifferet liht to that fact .
He tie in his mind to go back to that moment , wen h lips were ettng cosr to Jane , to that ls lok efore the embrace , to the preous smile .
hre was no o es to blm b him .
egrt had be filling up i soul since last Friday .
He could not keep his betrayl inside any lnger so he enterd te living oo an tol her .
The wrds coming up from h muth like a ltany , alost mechanically as he elized that there was no turning ac .
Tars ran down Rachel 's fae .
No word , t a sing comment .
S just stoo up , tk er purse , nd eft .
Th relieve of telig her w instntly replae by a btter hollowness .
He now realized .
He did n't do it for her , he oy did it r himself , to get d of hs urde but it was far oo at .
ihael cosed the oor d ne at hat moment he had made a miake .
The Beautful am

Th 90 mintes is he most enjoed time of the eek though because of th adrenalin rush hat is associated with ver ting that is dne on the pitch .
As a fan supoting a team is js o prt of e sort .

Tes ar js some of t man things that make me ove hi sport so much .
In the st century , advice is somhing that is only given ad tat give advie is never tan .
With egard to hi sport y dvce in my opinion is a good advice a I ave just a single adie for a perso tartng is sport d tat dvice uld be to enjoy everythin related to t sport .

I love to wrt .
It is a mthd I us to eax , uwin and rviv myself .
Our mind is lways full of toughs .
Some of these thoughts make us smile , some frown .
But a these ae addressed thrgh writing .
Writing should be done naturally ; only hn it serves its el purpos .
I he written many poems , few rtcles n even a e storis .
It is certainly a plasure to wrie and also reang what I have written , afer a ln time .

Othe than self , I have had few pople readng wa I ve wrien ; very w , I must say ; maybe only 2 or 3 ; and they were not critcs or experts .
So , I hv e to submt myself to some serious critiism ( wl , calling my wrtngs literature is a huge jo in itsf ... anay ) ; t s , I wuld like to lace my written works ( hwever small and w thy may be)r qualitative disussions in front of pople who really a identify the good nd t ' t - so - good ' writing .

Fisty we ogt to consir at friendshi is not uniquel a human emotion .
Frendsip is overall an acto of will .

My family loves me whatever I think or whtevr I do , no matter if it is coret or not .
They lov me jt becau I am me , fr wh I am .

They fel happy when I am apy , the are sad hen I am sad , they eno themselves with my ucces .
hy a , definitely , my best friends .
The ainting is an amang oe and one hould definitey ak a look at it in ode to appreciae is full beay .
Th Mona Lisa is perha Leonardo aVinci 's mot famous of paintigs .
It is an o painting , pinted on poplar od .
The painting is most famous f the smile of he wma , which peope have been trying to decipher f a log time .
Mny belive that th portat is that of DaVinci hmself , while many also plac a lot mystic connections ith this painting .
The porrait epicts a woman 's bust , wt a distant landscape tat is visble in the acdrop .
Leonardo ud a pyramid esgn to install te woa in a simple and calm manner within the painting .
T woan is sho with her han folded , with her bras , ek , and face paited h same colr as her hands .
Th light is diffus so at the various cures and geometrical saps on e painting are de visible thrgh it .
eraps he most intresting thng about t painting is the woma 's smile .
Many believ that it is inncent and inviting , ile others elieve it is hat of smuess and is a mirk .
May scientific studes have ben undertkn to determie te exact ntur of h sile and the real reao reans a mysery .
It is elived th evry person sees he smile differently because of the changes in the lighting tha Leonard preseted .
he wmn is own sete in an open area , a beid er is a vast andscape , which recedes to an icy mountin .
So winding paths a a fa away rdge is also perceptible in th bakground .
The painting is an amaing e ad ne should definitely take a look at it in order to apprecia t full beauty .
Te paintin is currently on display at e usee du uvre , in Paris .
Oe he pa f year , t Internet has become an imortat part of ur lve .
We use it to commnicte with fries , to play gmes , to ath series , the lit is endless .
Unfortnately , it is not perfe .
Becse e re pepl s the Internt , t greater t cnces r of pople misusing it .
Luckiy , he governent intervee to preserve the saey of th Internet .
ht it comes dn to is , shul t Internet be oe tightly controlled by governmets ?
Without he interference of e government , criinal ay se tei chances to ta advantage of internet uer .
They cold t ino ur computers a sal our information .
Th uld use hat information to get ino ou bank accounts and stal ou mony .
Howevr , if the government were to monitor th citizens actins re closely , it wod be considered an invasion of our pivcy .
Nooy wants to have thir private da to be xposed to th ye of the governent .
This brings me to the next iue .
The reason why the government eve tk action is to ensure people are abe to njoy e internet , but a or tightly controlled inteet would destroy that puros .
Everybody kes to hve e freedom to explore the interne .
So ty wold not appreciate it if there were sudenly restrictions put on them .
To sum hing up , h govrnmet should nt control e internet mo tightly .
It is fi e wa it is rght ow .
That y , the most of the troubl would be et ay from t inteet while at t ame ti , the inernet users wuld till hav t feeom to explore the we .
A pepl born iolnt or do hy ecome violent beaue of h te are brogh up ?
How d we become the person we are ?
Is there smehing that makes us unique ?
Is it he ges we ae orn wi ?
Or are we a poduc of our on ives ?
It is cla that gen ply a ver important part in the person we are .
Family characteritics such as ye nd ir colour ae inheried by childr from their parents as well as some diseases and mental disorders .
Therefore , what we need to conider is wheter u personality and personal skil are brn or made .
ose who ld tat ntue a a srongr ifluece than urtur on devloping our personl idetity wil laim at certain persoality raits a lo determined by ur genes .
Nevetheless , dentical twins tha were separated when they were vey you d hve been raied in different environments show differences in their personalities .
This provids evidence that life experiences n surrounding hre y rw up have efind he kind of persn o ae tday .
Regarding persnal skills , there a a lage number of cases in which chldren were brn giftd for th same field as their parents having great otential for a spcific at or science since early chidhood .
However , natre es n't lways edw us with nborn abilities .
For nstnce , parents tend to instil hei own passions in their children n , consequently , thy wil liely be interested in te same aademc or ristic field .
According to hs fact , parents ofe shape thei children 's lives ncourging the to flow in thei footsteps .
Likewise , some people p their ucces in life down more to the parent 's training tha to their innate talents .
So , to conclude we wud av to argue that th nature and nurur ake us h we ae .
As I s it , persna identiy is e result of th neraction of our netic structure and the environment which surrounds us .
Te problem is o to seprte tse two influences and how to find ou which the stronst is in ea cae .
ear ra !
Thanks a o f your ettr .

CONVENIENCE IS O THE MOST IMPORTNT
Nowadays , evy one of us travels a lot .
We do at for wrk or to final g a rs .
I , as a young women , sualy travel just as a hob .
Since te technoloy h improved in recet yar , we now have a huge variey of diferent ay to ravel .
Is it posile to choose which one is t best ?
The most cmmon answe oud be probably e plne .
There a so many advantages .
It is e fastest and he st comforabe one .
Of course , r tese aciliies o have to pay a lt of money n tht could be a prolm o some pople .

It coud also be rely comfotale but we do n't s it often .
It 's mor fo exoic trips .
Traelling on a boat for ue is a gret adventure .
t there is lso an inconvenience - it is als expenve .
A it is hard to pla a trip lik ths .
What aot the train th ?
This is he bst option fo me .
In my country trins are n't eally fast and there could be problems durg e rip but that 's for me makes it more interesting .
During the tip o can do ay tings - om sleeping to meeting ne peple ad making f .
It is aso qite sae so you do n't ae to woy about the accidents .
I wsh I cold travel every dy .
The tri is an adventure and the ways you can travel are a big part of it .
Even thogh a mode of transportaion is o ad , fo me the train is e best otin .
back in 20 , I traveled from Poro Alegre to o Puo by ca , a orse ht took 18 hours driving straight , suey vy f peope would conser it conveient .
cars are handy nd rivng can be leaant , t oy when the drier is in good mo , wit no traffc as or caters on the oa ( really common ituations in Brzil ) .
ince ancient times ist public trasort , and it sufere nmeous attempts of assassination , in Chn f example , the dynasty Yuan prohibited public transport ( at ha age , charrits ) because of er ha Hn people could plot d riot againt mogo 's dictatorship in it ; te stuatio inveted at early socialist regime he , in 10 , Mao consdeed prsonal cars as instrument of orssion n ymbol of devilish cpitalism .
Of course , none of these radical meaure st lo gainst the er basic human instinct : laziness .
we hae cas so we do n't he to ak , in te am fashion , peop who ca n't affd a r wil wt public tansport , een if a bike could be h solution .
The convenience has itlle to do wth t ft of public transport , countries wt hi HDI(convenience to be drivers ) , lk Geran and England , are those wih beter pubc trnsport system , nd tey ar vn bsting it .
Unless se extraordinary mutation happes n change us to some labor - lovrs , personal cars and publc transport will rue sd by side for all etenity .

Chapter 9 : e KM-3J : The second conrontatio
Tt night he ime lew by , b things started to ge weird , Marcus was talking with an Autralian guy aot the pros tat he had fond related to dinosaurs , he was interesed in them , ut Marcus did n't lk is point of view about thos pecies , the guy tod him they were bad retures with no feelings , nd Marcus thought ty ere awesoe and te most lovely creatures he had never heard about , the guy thought Marcus wa crazy , so he flew rom th Fdral Palace .
Meanwhi , ark d Michael were talking wth Russian ladies , they wee beautful and flawless , he scientists started talking about sciene an that so of thing , and suddenly th adies vanished , the men started crying .
Jc , was rguig with an oficer bot Mexico conquest ( the officer did n't nderstand nthing beause ack was dnk ) , and uddenly , t office took f his cotum and a strng mk , and in that moment ‚Ä¶ Jak a stonished ecuse th offier s ot an ofice , he w ra !
Jck tied to confront hm , but as son as he tried to do that , he snaped hs ingers and a lot of people cam aoud him , he had a ew tem , he deided to name them " T KM-3J " , a villains ta , their names were Karolina ( s decdd to cange his nae ike that bcaus he sed to say th that etter as e favorite e ) , Melanie , Miley ( te we bot twin , the most beaiful ladies of th wrld ) , ax , who s an expert in t ilitay ied , and Brad owley J. , nobody a known h last name until th moment : Jnior , he was mbarassed abou it , he was descndant of a weird woman , howeve e w he mother .
The KM-3J pt Jack into an immense a , thy were planning to kill him and lace is dad body in a grave , in tat y teir friends ould fin hi buried , but they were not that evil , hy just put him to a da room and tied is hans in a air , it was exactly e ae thing he was dreamed about .
While ack ws there , he herd rad alkig with Mx abut thi ne pl , it was relaed to a giatic apon ht wold soot oxi stes at Ne York ty , so in hat wy , verybody wud beco a zombie .

Comfort , time ad interna pace r reqird to make erning effiient .
Hence , it is not possile to do b and study sde by se .
Occupation and education disturb oe anoer .
I strongly opos this statement bcase handling both hee together is easily possible with srng willpower .
I wil elaborate points to support my opiion in e fther paragraphs .
Firstly , thre are a lot of pepl in wester countries , who do a pr - me tudy and rk ll - tie or ic - versa .
It all epends on h prefrece of te individuals .
If he wn to bear some hassle and ecome moe prductve in thei ie , thy can anage both things side by sde .
This not ony makes em knowledgable b increase tir potential as well .
Secondly , there r a f parents who a t bear th expenses of their chi 's education .
Resltantly , they put their children no some lbor so that they can earn moe for e family .
But it do not mean that the cil has to bandon is dream of acquiring education .
With firm determination , tey can continue ther education and wok to fd her amily as well .
Finally , soetimes peole think they have completed thir ducation , but wen ey get a fll - me job , hey ealize tat diploma or dgre can increase their chances of promoion .
Moreoer , some empoyers slect e potntial employee fom colleges ile they a studying n pay f hir Mastrs or Advaced Diplomas because thy see her prft in that investment .
Hee , studying ad working side by se helps candidates to row profesionaly .
In conclusion , woking and studying is vy much osible .
It ut depends on the dedication and etemination of the person .
People should do both sdy an work si by side to mk themselvs more killed an capal .

Th oles memory of or relationship is a hrt skirt d some crocodiles .
Two perfect stigmas for a mn an a woman in enera .
e tak is unambiguus and seemingly easy . I suld be al to describe my view of Aercan man and his behavor ecause of my experience as an adl , a woman , a we , a mther and simply a human being ih various roles in lie who has been mlion times happy and million ime uhappy .
Howeve , I am n - American a I iv wh a man who surpises me every day in a pitive and also in a negative way . I can not describe my wn husbad .
Is it really pssile to desibe a a at all ?
No . I think tat I can epict th one American man within a certain peiod of time , b it is mposible to ite h trt since I he never sen him aive . I can rite sbjectively and my obervations of h hrugh the Intere ill be ditorted by my w lie , experience ad surrounding I live in .
Let me introduce one Amerian I got frinds with on Facebook .
s nme is Kyle .
A typical American am , rgt ?
However , he is n typil .
He is special .
I like his humor , because he is able to ake me smil .
His snsitvity is visible through his cefully chosen ords d his cency in his grammticlly correct sentences .
I ore hi imgination because he is able to idna y on a cloud to a ever never lad .
He is wise an brave , ecaue he was not sare to teach me altough he is not a teacher .
Bt wt bout those snakes ad guns in i photos ?
Woul I be ble to overcom my own phobias and be fair ?
nd what about those open - erted quotes , loe songs and petc opnins he sares on his wall ?
Is he a romantic d a iller in ne ?
He is te man tuc in a generation where loyalty is jst a tttoo , love is just a quote d ling is he new truth .
He is he an nd I am t wma who live in th world , in which the ma wears a short skirt and the oan is as ouh as a crocoile .
He alwys ries gentle words , uses cute mieys , Facebook kisse and hug , but whn I ask i in what a he loves me , he answs " as a Christian " .
ell , it 's ll iht .
I 'm relieve .
Howver , th wan inside of me shut : What ?
He does ot love me as a woman !
ow come !
I would like to point o another his attribute hich is his prd .
hen I asked i , if he hd read a ook The Little rine by Exup√©ry because I am feeling lie a fox , he askd me in an ofended mnne , if I kno Lary , the comeian .
Kyle is raly prideful , bt so ar al the men .
I do n't believe in the friendship between e man and the omn .
ere wi always be som kid of sparkling ither alluring or repulsing .
ext thin I like out him is that he never pushes me it anything .
If I want to sleep , he stops i n imagination to le me rela and res .
So he is tughtful .
I must be honest r a hil .
He rose up my ow enslved desires .
I have always watd to ly , to trvel , to paint , to wrte an to lov .
And I am left to love without ay support .
He asked me to observe hi r a week .
Hwever , I am scared a bit of te consequences of this ecrt adventure .
Wht if it beks me down ?
I mean what if he tmes me like a fo ?
He is a hunter .
Al the men e .
In following section I will write about his sexalit an dealing with an arument .
It as easy to draw him into the love affair or to ke m orny , t it wa quite difficult to tat an argument with m . I think that he is a god writer because he is able to describe is sexual dreams a hougts liely and vividly .
Hweve , as him a question from his el life nd he will iv you a ne - wor answer .
This could hardly saisfy an ordiry questioner like me , not only an interviewer from a daily journa .
I belie he is tede a carul , but impatient and clumy at th sme ime .
He forget of everything hen he punge int hi Neverland .
No attr wha you write , he follows his own lust .
On e other hand , he is disciplin , becaus he is ale to stop with his imagey at on .
He is cute , anyway .
As I wrote before it was not hat esy to make the argument wit hi .
I tried to u different strategc inputs that cud elp me to argue , for xample : Y are totlly uninterested to rd beteen lines ! You never listen to me!I even called him a lmox a stumblebum .
He ju et qiet and begged me to stop .
He did h est to calm me don .
I was impressed an I fnd his a good feature of hs personality .
Yeerday I wanted him to te me th sto of is life .
He ent wi e tip rom Calfornia to Texas a hn to Phoex .
If you like adventurers , wl , he is t rght man o you .
Sport is a part of mn . I should not byss this issu .
So I sked i hat hs favouit spor is .
He ikes baseball , but he des o play baseball actvely .
He likes watchin it .
He actively does hiking , nting nd cmp ridig .
The week has pased , so we e at he end of this advture orse .
Kyl is a stong and charismatic individuality an he values s privy a lt .
Hnesly , I ased myself , if I would like to be h futur wi .
I ponerd th many times .
And sure , I wll .
However , I am not tat crzy to marry t man wh I not know in real le .
But I do ke him nd I lved the cuse .
It surely tuht me a lo and enriced my whe lfe .
Thank you , Kyle .
In the end , I woud lie to ad a quotation by Fnz Mrc .
I do no know wo ranz Marc is .
u I identify myself th his vw of male d fema relationship .
" Blu is th mae principle , stern and spirtul .
elow the female principle , gentle , cheerful n sensual .
Rd is matter , brutl a heay and always the colour which must be fought and vanquished by h oter tw . "

Purpose
As requested , ti is a rport concernig the envronmetal coditon within my wn .
The iformation blow evluate th chief mesures tke against pollutin and environmental dame as wll as e population 's nteret d involvement in an optimum preservation of e aa .
Recycling
Throug a series of progrmms and events organised by local vluntary organisations both adults nd chidren are nsructed abot the impotance of waste redution and eccling .
Therefore , in e last few year here s ben a great improvement in raiin awareess an commitmnt amng an incresingy larger sector of th poplation as far as he selectie colletion of houshld reuse is concerned .
This is cerly illutrated by the growing numr of rcyclng facilities the residens of our tn hv at hir disposal .
Public Trnsport
Since ehaust fumes r consiered to be ne of the maj pollutants nwaday , te local autorities ar oing everything in their power in order to iduce itizen to travl mr by ean of public trasport , in the detrment of the biqutous private cars .
Consequently , ther are bus which run at short intervals on various rtes , so that eople can ariv at tei desinatons rapil and convenintly .
Unfortunately , nly a limited number of people r willng to leave her comor one fo the sae of h communy , thus makng ollutio by dint of heavy traffic a remaining and inextricable prblm of ur soiet .
Public Cleaning ervices
Our loal publc clanin services are rsponsible nt ony for te efficient removal , storag , cllecion a transport of waste mteril , but alo o the maintenance and good care of natural areas a green spaces witin r community .
he soe purpoe of her activity is to ep our to clen a neat , makn it an appeaing an pleasurble lac to inhabit .
Cnclusin
Taking verything nt consideration , it would be fair to conclude ht there are numerous ay in which on can protect the environment ad ta cae of e area in which they esde .
Howevr , as wt all issues presen withn society , a dual comtment from t citzens and authorities shud be regadd as a key factor .
Red fire ants originated in Brazil .
ire ants are very aggressive .
Tey oft swarm on their pre swify and sting repeatedly to paralyze it .
If we disturb a fr t net thy uld relentlssl sti us , injecting poion it our bod .
Te sting old be fatal if we ve an allerg .
Even if we do n't , stinging will caus a burning senstion , swelling ad en a bliter at the point of sting .
In md cases , e sting uses tch .
In severe cas it cases nuse , vomiting or dizziness .
In t US , millions of people re stung annualy ad om have died from thir njuries .
ie an threaten mor han umn halth .
In infested ara , they injure livestock , pets an wldife ; dmge crops , plants , electrical equipment , a irrigation systems .
We shoul e pesticide reatents to reuce their numbers .
ee will be several inventions in te next yas .
Nowadays we ca n't pedit h im of future devices though I gss hat they will be mainy related to eradicting currnt illnsses .
Cancr , o insace , is surely e of the preferences or h cpanies that invest large aounts of ney in R&D.
oreoer , it is a profitable sk if they make up new medications to help pople suffeing fro that illness .
Personally , I consider urng cancer te most calenging goal fr e next generation of reseachers and invenrs .
Although I advocate new remedies fo canc , I think that there is noter problem in the worl that ocety should ocs on .
It does ot i in rih countries because it concerns to poor countries .
It is usually forgotten beause it baely affects our daily rutie .
However , wn we ak about hunger we mut regard it as the main probl of the orld .
That is t reason why I have been thinking for a long ime about a e deve to eraicte staratin .
It is o ompletely developed u I an dvanc sme ideas about it desin .
It cosist of a pill where we bnd lots of diferen elements .
Altogter hey provid the nutrients to coer t eed of feedng of one peron in on day .
Manufactuing cots are not expensive and thee pills do t expire .
hy c be conserve for a long ti and shipping cos are very low .
I conside ha it coul contiute to feeding many pople and it could deinitely en with the most unair roblem of this wor .
LIFE IS BEATFUL
There must be somethng vey speca bout a movie when , after the third im , o 're stil getting o of the cimen thking " I hav to see it agin " .
ht 's only ppened to me one , and h im was if is Beautiful .
Starring Itlan comic Roberto Begnini ( who lso wrote and ireced the moe ) in h min ro of Guido , this live lovin tragi / omey it 's but a Jewish faher trying to shil hi young son from te horros of the nazims in te Italy of Mussolin .
For ht mter Guido ceates an imaginariy game for i child nce thy are deported to a concenraton amp .
He tls t o tht they re competing with othe to in a tank , so the little Guiosu√© d n't realise what it 's rell goin on aoud him .
e strength of the movie reies on the goofy , lovin , eccetric character played by egnini , h exceptional comic talent and is aility as diectr to eal wit sch elicate topc ike Nzism while anging to drive through a thick line bettween comed and drama .
h Original soundtrack reatd by Nola Piovanni it 's also a beautiful , delicate plus to tis masterpiee .
Life is beautiful was reiient of numerous awar incluing the Ocas as f best foreign pictur , best acor and bt oriina dramtic score .
Wat trikes me more was that dspite t fact that it 's e on the ev of th II worl w , he film is n't really abou h holoaust but a bittersweet fable about han curag love d he .
If you aredy haven't se it , hich I dob , I ghly recommend it ; it wi make you laugh ut loud but als along he way ou 'll find yoursel cover in tears , uaranee .
Football , to me , is more than just a game .
I have learned a o of thngs from it .
When I joined h tam freshman year , I id n't realie hat I was etting into .
Foobal reqires trmendous amonts of teamwork and sptsmanship to be successful .
We worked l summer in h weight rom and a on the tak to t in physical and etal shape befe the eaon .
Se , football is more of a mental ort than anythng ese , so nning on the track wa n't only about getting in hap . We would push our minds by running as had as we could ev if we felt like we were going to ps out .
At th beining , I was imature and oly thought of myself , omtimes ev giving up we I w ired or hurting .
Then after the third gme I had a seson - ending injuy .
Imaine working ll sumer and the only being able to play three games !
I needed srery on my m ad at east five mohs to recover .
Needless to say , I was sideied f e st of the season , u his actually hped me realie that sinc you never kn whn you ast ly wil be , u should y your hardest in football n li .
Aer freshman year I decided that I old alwy ve my best effort .
Playng arsty football has tught me so much ore an just wa my asignents are on a particular lay or how to boc . I have learned to tink about others irt , and realied how important working har is .
Being it l my friends , even sweating and leedig ith hem , really made us bond as a group of hard - working young men I know wl uccee in life .
High - cool football is more ta just a sport .
It is a learnng ground or may to stenthen their personalit a character or thir lies .
One thing my coach alwy sys is , "
Imagine that you hve jus ru 100 sprints d a gin bear starts ching you .
Are ou js gong to stand ther and le it attack ou bcause yu e too ire ? "
Te answer , of curse , is no , because you n always put it in noter gar evn if you think ou ne to gi up .
This to me means that you can always control your attitude and effrt .
So , no mttr what , if y maintain a geat atitude and always give whatever yo 're doing yu best effort , y will have no regrets .
Honestly , I could nt agree more , as the webste as it is vailable today is an inconvenient tool poviding insufiient informton .
I woul like to suggest improvin the bsite in he folowing ways .
First , it is difficult to navigate th currt wesite versio . We could move the sarch bar lose to the top in order to mke it asie to fd .
Besdes , addin a scedle to th let secion uld be an advaage , as u customers would be ale to fn t opon tey ed in a ore covenient way .
Scon , e theme is odated , ad developing ew design can be a od move to atract mor clnts .
Minimaistic deig is oh stylish n ser - friendly , as it ds not mply any lement requring website visitor to load hey module , a hre e no uncessary banners that distrc th user .
Third , implementing sverl dvanced solutions , sc as a calculator , a galey n li chat , could make u age more useful .
As to othr aspet of our website , it igh be a good idea to enhance its performnce by means of ptimizig t code an remving advertisements ( whih dcrease te wesite value while brining little profit ) .
ll the tsks a be completed witn a moh , nd I would be gla to be nvlved in he improvemt of our website , as it is an important aspect of our wk , because it represents e company , a representation is key whn ttacting client is concrne .
Before fousing on e top of technology itself , I uld li to mention some aspects elate to education .
First of l , Spaish educational laws are in Europe , nd probal in the world , the onl ones wic have chaned the most in the las 30 years .
Thi fct lads he teachers to be unsre of hat they e doing .
Besides , thee are no results tat can be analysed or cheed .
Secondly , there e to sorts of schools in Spain - public and private- , which prouces a i difference in e edational knowlege .
Whi pulc ones must obey govrnmental las strictly , prive schools have some privileges .
Knowing ths about the Spaish education system , we cn ow talk abou technoogy .
I obviously agree that nowadays technology is necessary .
So , he schoo and the educational intitutons in genral av to updte e wy they teach .
Technology does not imply a e nstrumen to be taught ut a n ol n sore of nowedge ( if ue corctly ) .
In fact , using technology withot changing e cotent wuld be a total alure .
Techrs must lean h to use tse new technological deves in rer to get their students motived .
Moreover , they shoud comprise te ps infrmation and t ne n .
hu , this wud help tudents know how h wor hs evolved ad o it will be .
In ther words , tehnoogy should be used as a too for the students be aae of the development of society n s advatages and disadvantages .
This ew technologies aso help in t teaching development .
We can mae dynam classes by beig in contact wh the schools , in h case of subjects sch as Engish and Frech , students oul improve hei skill by being in contact wi sdents from differen countrs .
lso , teaches cud replae their methodologies following the best one and te ones which cntrbute to have qualiid sudents taied to face evryay lif situatios .
In conclusion , as a great teher said , we have st centuy students learning ith 20 entury ols e 19th cntury knowege .
hu , ther mut o be a technological reolutio but an educationa on .
To the Mayor
I am writing to exress my concern about the smokng ban w l .
I ear that suh a huge move would damag bsinsses and ny wrkers would se their js .
At present , I am working for Cafe Nor , a wel - now etaurant popular with visitors , my of who ave told me tha if such a ban were introduced , th wol woud n enter into restaurants n intead , they would meet fends at home .
On top that , I think h aount of ntie you have ivn people is unreasonable .
There needs to be much wider public debate , an if a majority are , they should be gven nough ime to g us to .
To supprt my argume , I would ie to tel y wht happened in my country hn ch a a a inoduced .
irt , it wa almost impossible to enforce it .
Thre were no nouh police to go round checking any publi lace .
Secondly , business suffre , with people objecting that th should be gin the right to smke if they wished .
In the n , the government changed the law , encoragin peope to provide n - sokin aras .
This approach strkes me as uch more realistic nd I urge y to reconsider it before it is too la .
We wll ta about a technology that miht soon isturb t orl .
B first le me exlain e process taken to manufcture anything .
e manufacturing poess follows three main stages : designing thn poucing te consumn .
For a quik glmpse , this technology provides e abily to precsely cone y tanibl oject .
This dirctly affects the producing sae , alwing mor effcint production .
More efficient producto means cheaper goods , and by roviding them cheapr the cosume nw has the ability to purchase more of these goods .
Higher purchasing per means at we cn uy more gods using the se amount of moey .
In othr wor , money old hae or vlue .
So , let 's sy , o hve $ 100,0 o , o would ave $ 10,000,0 fifty years om w .
Y ten could pay you debt , et a n r , buy a new house , invest or retire , or do ust about anythng u wld do if you curenty have $ 10,000,000 in you bank account .
Looking at it throgh a broader scope , country deficits would be sled , hugry people wuld be ed , and th homeless wuld ge accmmodate .
But why wud the goos be heper ?
This is th effect of a redution in th ct of podction ; les production cs allows he proucer to educe the price of his goos while mintainig th inial poit .
With competitio ging him no choice at l , t prdcer is forced to ade by the marke equlibrium .
Surprisingly , h prdcer get to maintain his prois due to te prortional decrease in prie as we as the cot to produce .
This aomatic , effiient , qui , ecise technolog reducs th amount of labor needed , save wse initially caused by human errors , saves time d produce at better qality too .
In cnlusion , this revolutinry technology has potentia to vast impve te wy we manufature u oods , and in he process of doing tat benefit the whoe world .
Dogs and cats are aled " furkid " n only becau their bodies e oered with ur , bt ao because their hsts egard pes as kd .
I nevr realized that a furkid would eric my lie unti I met Casino , a smt , patient d andsome Goldn Retriever raised by my wife 's fmily .
I an stil recall the dy Cathy an I brouh Csno to Taii iy Hll , walkig im along the eparment stre pavement , and paying with m al a long .
our days later , he suddenly passed wa , and he day became our lt mery ogether .
His body was cemated d buried on a mountai in northrn Taiwan .
A sweet olive tree was lante with his ashes .
We vsited him everl times oer he years , a decided to tke e sweet olive tree home with us hs ear .
I miss Casino so muc .

You a never really say a ting is wort unls yu have indulged yourself in it .

And you can never really say a eacer in the mountain is iserable nlss o have xperienced eng ne .
When I knew I uld be asined at Gala aional High School , I sid it 's the orst hing th ever happened to my career .
When I knew I oul be tehing at t rmotest hi school in Ozaiz , I said I a so unfortunate , and when I knew I woud be spending my dys in the mounain , I id my ife wul be miserable .
Indeed , negative vibes fild my thoughts ftr having known that I s to practic my chosn profeion in the place I feared the ost .
But ftr a year , I was all wrng .
My fit paragrph aptly expresses my exact realzation .
To have been assigned in the mounai is neve a wst siuation ; I have never been unforunate , and misery has eve been my colague .
In fat , being a eacher in the mountain is bei he bst of h I am , bing te mt fortunate of e alve , d being the happiest I could ever be .
es , Gala Natioa High chol has given me thousands of easns to be happy and to eel blessed .
In he , I he learned more tha te lessons I hve taught .
Th school as a whole a become my great mentor .
It has auht me lessons I cul n't have learned had I nt ben her - the lessons tat do o only help me improve my teaching profession but lso help me become e righ person of my ministry .
Gaa as paved the way for me to becoe tt techr I lon to see .
I may hav ee fr yet from ein an ideal ne , but I know someday , havg Gala as my guiding light , I an ecome one .
As to my coleages , I am grateful to be in a small group of individual who st of te time hres the same line of inerst with me .
We r so small a number , t that does o inde us to hold ay hool rogrm and activity at its est .
With our sheer creativty and nthuiasm , we aways made it a point that every school activity is worthwhile .
We never ettle for any mediocrity .
That is us - the teahrs of Gala .
And that 's on thing I le the mst .
Together , we aspire for soethin beond better .
My persnal relationship wt my co - teaers is the same as tha of a typical Filiino famly .
It 's t al e me at we are in good terms , t we ow to ourselves tha we care for each other .
I y have hrt some of my coleagues in a certain circumstanc , and they ma ha urt me o , but at the end of the day , it 's lays camarerie among us ha domates .
And it 's l at attes .
As to my students , I fe realy so fulfiled .
At first , it as an extreme chlenge for me to hnde students in he mountain .
Ther needs speak beyod intellectual hunger .
Every da I g to deal it tudets weaig diferet faces of lfe 's resntmet .
As a eachr , it took me mch of everything I hve to cm to trm to evey piifl fate of my students .
Hee , e value of UNDERSTANDING t student even beyond hat th manin of such rd n express has en dramatically instilled in me .
And that 's one of the lessons I conidr a gem to kep to mself forer .
Students in the mutain hav a lt of dferent untold stories of ter lives .
These sories once hard , ca open somebody 's heart to lear to love learnrs despite everything .
That is wt exactly happened to me .
As I listened to my students , I have come to realize the very essence of my existence as thir teacr .
Consequently , I ve seen the ne to attend to their needs .
I y hve ot perfectly carried out my responsibilities , t I kno somehow in my e year stay in Gala , I av mae a difrence to my students ' lives .
My everyday iteraction with my students has bn my everyday fulfillmen .
Eventally , e huge challenge I hav h ha tned into my inspiration to do etter in my jo .
My students hav a t of weakneses in mn aspects of lif , but eeing thm enduring was motivaig me even more to gi tm good asons to eep on kepng on .
My dear students a have n known it , b really , tey are to the source of my ier srengh .
There were ime I wanted to back f from te my deands of rk , t I lways found myself figtig .

Der S :
It is o an easy ta to explain the importance of this exam for me , since I do not have any specific objective in mind tha requires a amridge certificaion .
Simiarly , I do not have any study methods in the sense of systematic mecanisms to lern English .
What I a say is that I hav been lernig Englis since I was twelve , n it has ben a plasre ro the start .
My irst mmor elaed to the English language is of lrcs ; I love pop usic an used to transat ogs comosed by lto John nd Lennn and MCartney .
ext I started to read oks suh as he Harry Potter erie d boo by erge R. R. Mati .
I am lso an attentive listener of BBC Radio or .
These are my study methods , if I can say so .
bot the asons to take he test , there is little to say .
As I ave said , I hae ben learning nglsh by e sher pleasue of it ; but , having ome ths far , I hik it is time to get se id of frml recognition about my level .
hat do pele think about teenagers ?
Why rather neatie ?
Lots of people think , that teeagers r stupid , have a small knowledge bou life , do not he enough experience , are annoying , difficult to understan .
In my opinion we huld n't hik lk tht .
I gree tha sme of yong peole bhave really bal , they smoke , sho on their arets , drik ber , do not improve themseles .
Bt most of teenges are een mr intelligent than adults or rderly peole .
At shol , at home hey ve to pe th lots of problems and ry to olv them .
I strongly disagee ha they are ot experienced .
They sometimes ve to lp tei friends or even thir parents in ifficult tasks ik psychical problems , ve hem tips .
ometime it happens tha a couple , which has a hld in age frm 12 - 16 , querls .
Te oug person ha to be strong , t to understand the stuatin .
Tennagers also have to make serious dcisins like choosing secondary scol , futur job , whc wa they wl go in thir li , if hey nt to be in relationship with someone .
Those examples sh ha teenagers have to cope with lots of problems .
Most of hem are ale to .
Of cose it 's only my opinion .
Ways to collect and record information for future generations
Fidin te best wa to collect and store iformation for the futr is not just a problm in or working ife u also in or private life .
Tha is h rasn h our class attnded a panel discussion on this seciic opi .
Diffrnt wys of accumulating ad string information were presented at the discussion .
I would lk to phasise o options in hi esa .
n way to t the information neede is to interview people from he neihbourhod nd ither wrte dwn what is being aid or record it as an aio - ile .
This wa you do nt only gather pln data but aso emotions fom pople .
Aditionally , it happens th while speakig of a artiular event suddeny more memores nd stris come to th arrator 's mind .
Howeve , sometimes h narator tes to fil in the gps of s / hr memory with imainary parts or tre to embellish cetan parts of the story .
nother interesting way to find out me aout the past is to ollect od hotogrphs .
This is an impressive a to document a change over may yer , bu on the other and it is chalengng to keep photographs in go condiin .
For me personally , he best wy to colec and record iformtion r future generaons is to intervie peple d to tor the information in an aproriate way beuse of three reasos : Firstly , I have the chnce of no getng ust o story from a prso b maybe tw or thre more .
econdy , I an cah te the narrator'smotins .
Thirdy , I do not hv to be concered abut loss of qualtiy of photographs and picturs .
Wh I was in Bali , I had a great nig that I aays remember .
My huband ad me ent to a dine on the beach of our hotel .
h weather ws ve ood and we enjoy aving dinner barefoot , sat on the sand .
T dinner was deliious d we tasted lots of new flavours of alinese ood .
fter dnner , we saw an intersting show of Balinese anc and music .
When we thouhgt ha the igt h finished , we ha e prect desert .
Despite it a er da , we could ee something moing on h and .
It w er i ... We could n't lieve ha we were seeing .
It was a vry ig n beautiful trtle !
Bt ...
It was ls and cou n't fin the y to te ater .
We shouted ad two waiters of te hotel came quickly .
They turned th turtle and oo it to t wtr , hee freed it .
Th t turtle sarte swimming n diappared of our sight .
We er very happy because of seig the turtle and hope to co back to ali to se it agai .
In trms of hoidys , oe pople lik to visit their own coutries , while others prefr ing abroad .
I think goig boad is much more xciting .
Visiting their own cuntr certainy h its advantages .
Frt of all , y do n't have to take very long trips .
Also , you can have the opportunity to discover new place jut next to your home .
Besides , is type of acation is usually less expensive tan going broad .
On he oth hand , many people peer visiting oher countries .
Actually , thy like the idea of visiting an unknown land , wher everything is different , fr the wether to the habts .
Futhermre , they so like goi abrod to visit important n fmous cite around the rld , ik aris , Madid , e ork .
In my opinion , traveli to a foreig country makes people open their minds to other cuures .
In act , going abroad is a nice y to make new friends , y new thin and improve a foreign anuage .
In ddtion , if y ln yur vacaon ey on , y can also save mone on lanes or hotels .
In concluson , I think it 's impotat to know both ter own countries and forein lnds .
It was tee in he morning when the phone rang .
I was just aot to go to ed wh I suddenly heard th phone and I got cared cause I as ale at hm , and I thoht ha it could be serious news .
It was in Augus , my parents and my brter were on hoiay in Malrca f a we , and that ae da my sister nd her boyfrend travelled from Yecla to Paris in a pacage travel .
At tha mmnt I tought ta an accident or a siila something a ppened to my family but fotuately it was n't so .
A girl was on the other side of the pone and she ld me tt my sister and her boyfriend were n't wi h other passengers .
They did n't ae mobile hone beuse it happened a lo time ago .
Th il I 'd ike to tl about is " Secet Life of Walter Mitt " .
It is a fantastic lm wt beautiful views nd an exciting stor .
Th ma chrcter , Waer Mtty , works in a well - known agazin " Lif " as a manager of pto negativs .
ne da he gts a pcel from a faos traveller .
In is leter he says that one shot fm th fim is the bes picture he ha ever mde .
Unforuntely , Waler n no find the sho , so he has to oo fo e traveller which is not sy .
He has to travel to remote parts of t world and hve se vey azing adventures .
In th end , he manages to meet he trvller d find t whre he shot is .
I wo n't tell o any or as it can sil h story , but the film is dfinitey worth watching .
In addition , I c say that I 'm charmed by the an character who is developing throughout e hole film .
If ou lke complicated stories abut dreams a ho to make he true , tis story is defintel for you .
Free of poke pain & frequented by the locals , there is a dining gem in Nova Grca .

For seasonal food served by oblging & goo humoured waiers , you will fin nowhere bete .

Oe of Slovenia 's qalified somneller will help y choose frm h good wine cellr , so this is the place where I recommend or css c relax , eat , rnk wl & njo the hpy atmospere .
I old lke to talk to you about a usicl whc I saw recently .
It is called " Les Mserales " and has much to recommend it , includig he plot , h cast ad , of course , the soundtrack .
The ilm is set in Fane in nneeenth century .
Just aer e French Revolution .
It is an adapttion from th original book " Les isrables " by Vitr Hugo .
The idea lying ehind t sry is that jusic and lw r t the same thin .
Th main charactr , ean aldean , played by ug Jackma , is jaile fo stalng a lof of bread , in a tr to avoid his nephew 's dath .
en afe being et ee , he becoe a thief again , however this time he is not condned bcause of a prer .
Bt do nt worr I am not going to spoil te ening .
All it occurs during the irst pat of the fi .
egaring the soundrac , I cn oly say ha since I saw he flm I ca not help singig evey song a the tie .
All in al I hink that it is n of th bes films ever made .
Tavelling by ar is becoming more covenient .
Cs re improving , becming sae d environmet frindlier .
A lo of effort has ben t in reucing the fumes , etc .
Moreover , peple ve ecom mr aware of th environment prtetion .
hu , mor nd mor people , when buying a new car , also consider its environmental friendlnes and th possible impact on the communt .
Also , cr get more afrdable in may contris .
For example , in Ina nd China the tehnologial advances hav enabled tem to as prdce ealy affordal crs , which ar also imported .
Together wi that , more eope ar getting familiar wih driving and eeing more confident about driving ter w car .
Once you kw o ourself how mfortable it is to hve a ca , there 's very litl chance you wl go back to publi tranprt .
oweer , there ight be still rom r publc transport in future , especilly in b ctie .
I man he undergound in the first place .
It is very economca in terms of tie , istance n people capacty .
As fr buses , tey might be histor in decades to come .
Althouh I do n't quite like watching oap oers , I w strted watching this particular show with my family .
My mother likes watchng sap opras on tv nd h got me hooked nt this new tv ho - iknmp .
h ow looked promising throgh its promos , wic were basd on a ery famous old hindi song .
The ld actos were wel known tv strs .
The show was bad on the jouny of a aried cuple , liin in India , who et separated du to oe misundertandings .
e couple have 4 kids n afte separaion , 2 kids live wh their mom and 2 with eir d .
he dad , wh is a cardiologist move to US and starts a ew lie there .
Th mom on the other hnd ecids to stay ak ad wors ar to give r children a decet life .
e sh starts with he eldt daughtr , h live wh her mother tyng to contat her ther to ask im to be a part of er wedding ceremo .
T fthr who ad owe to neer look back at frs ignores her ruests , however , upon insistence om i otr children and hi sister grees to go bac to India .
The rs of the show is bad on h interactions between l 4 childr and how the work toeher to unite their faily .
It 's a typical Indan so opera in which ov conurs ove everything .
Atough ot very practical , e ow is u to wch as it brings out te Indian alue and at the same im teahs he mportace of omen being indpendnt n le to ld lie on their own .
Innovative entrepreneurship an be erceived as a specia procs of creating , testing an implementing of t nw poducs ad materials , he new a of esource utilization and the new kind of management in busiess process to find advanced opportunities for ( non)commercial use .
The first tes has hown that I am very otiated an my skil amost ft to the possibility to be an entepreneur .
However , the attude hat I have is not very appropriat for entereneurship .
It is impotant to underline that the driving factors ( motvaion ) determine beaviour of entrepreneur and sow the reaons r acting .
In e test were accessd the answes a I was ond ut as a peson that has ih ontrol appeal meaning that I hv great leadg skills an a ne to oranize nd to moderat .
In he motivation at I also received ig cor in need of calenges as I prefer to ak difficult projects because I believe hat they might develp my nowledge and ablitie .
orever , it is really importan for me to be n oss en though it eds mc ore responsibilities .
Neverheless , in the et I reeied fer oints in " nd for acieement / sucess " than it w requre for bin an enrepeneur .
As I oud out ere were tw problems about lack of points .
Th frst e was sed on profi orietation of the entrepreneur in te test .
h above - mentioned situation mean ha during th assssmet were not takn io acoun othr goals ta entrepreneur might have .
r intanc , it can be h social sustainabily and a ned to develop the locl empoyment situatio or an entrepreneushp as a hobby / lifestyle .
he second prble ws bed on essential role of getting a feedback .
Hweve , t test evaluaed as important feedbck parnts and friends oinon ad I do not agree that it miht be essential unless they are spcialsts in tt fied .
Nevertheless , I might ae a reasonable risk in ce it can positively influence business .
PLAN , TRAIN OR BOAT ?
Evryone likes omething oe or less , ee whn it comes to litle hings .
It is crtan that each of us loves to travel , but everye lies th mt comforable means of transport .
Fr me , the best way to travel is tai , because I hik his de of transportation has e mot pros .
e of the things tat is ve importan to me is te ric .
I 'm not going to pend a t of money or a icket , ecaue I 'm sdying so I jut have a pat - tm job .
If we chek the prices of air avel , we ca be disappointed as well as of rael by at .
Fortunately e rin tickets e cheaper .
noter vry important thing is the rael tim .
Plane ies very quickly , but o have to be at he arort at lea an hour erlier .
In te se of a sip , travel tim is immense .
Trveling by tan is qut ast , a pleasant , I can sfly travel to mor plcs woldwide an popl tkng a ot or pae trnsprt .
After the summary is to cerif that travelling by tri is the mos advantageous , but t mo importan rason y I chse jouny by train a ac that I have a motion sickness , and I 'm afraid to fly .
At t d of a decade in whih tchnology s made eormous leaps , I am thnking about how much present vision of ous will change in the ftue .
Despite many differene in h human natue , the present houes do n differ so uc between themselves .
Most of e hos have walls , dors , wiows and a built on solid grund .
urthermre , hy ha flat or slpig roofs , ne or mo floors .
Se ae situated in the neighbourhood of paks , forets or lakes .
On te oher and , reentl , re often many new n mor advanced projects are realizd by daring architects .
Ty often do not ue t popular brick ut glss , wod , plastic .
But can o imagie ht in h nar , unspecified future all homes wll be ie that ?
Bult by uing the mot modern technolog , full of h lates inventions which a ca creae ?
Of course , for people to live btter , but it woud be useful to odrn house to be onstructed so as to do not daage he environment .
I thi ite few scientists still surprise us , and the house of the fure will go beyond he imit of our imagination .
DEVELOPMENT IN E TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN SPAIN
There has been mjor changes regarding the teaching aroach in te last few ears , t there is till ro f improvemnt .
If we focu on th teaching of Englih as a foreign language , we possiby could s thi oe clerly .
In th ely 1980s the aivity in t classroom was focused on grammar .
Hwver , speakng , istenng ativities and h massive ue of I.T mark the schedule owadas .
All these chages make h learnin proces much more un , creative d pracical for the studens .
The new eachng aproch is based on o student can effectively e the language rather than on the nowledg of e language they actualy have .
Ts ne outlok on e teaching procedures consists of the use of te so caled alternative assessent as a way to ealute learns ' skill .
A gramar es shows knowledge aot he language , whrea altrnative assessment sws learners ' ability to efficaciously use the angage in he context of a al situation .
There are many reasons for sin aternativ assessment echniques : lerners demostrate things leare , te responsibility , otivation y increase and they hav the opportunity to use langug or ctal urpses .
It is imprtant to noice that the difficulty to crr ou he chane towards the ew teaching aroach- referred to bve- lies no with the udents tmselves but with h ld generation of teachers , sie thy sometims hv trouble applying e ne outlook on eucaton mthos .
In concluon : The w of teaching is channg in th lat few yer all over Spain .
The mn reason for that ould be found by overlooking t tters lated to ew teaching mthds dvelopd recently .
However , a moth transition to t e appoach is still necessary to overcome the masie education - related challenges Spain ill have to ace in th upoming ears .
In the ea 2020 here was conflict between Japan and the Uted states .
h conflict wa de to tend creation , citizens between oh untries ante to ee who reaed better and biger trends .
Tis cnflict was an inentve or clothng soes to sel new and weird thns f a higher pri .
Law enforcers also wanted f their country to win , and in te United Stat polceen arested any aanese person they w nd sent them ba to Jaan .
h apanee governmt mae a coptition to see whch of hei citizens as h best trend - setter .
he wnne 's reward wa the ability to rule over Japn for a y .
Afte tw ears , e winner was dcided , an he made Japn go into pvrty .
One the ay was over , the Jpanse government tried to rvers a of the damages done , bu it ws impossible .
The inne h changed Japan 's landscape , what once as te amaing ci of Tokyo now was a sad an dirty ty .
Japan akd the Unte states o help , ty gladly agred , and hey draged Japan back up to their normal status .
Jaa ot a lt , but it a able to g bc up on its feet .
Everyone as happy for some ti and true pec between the cuntrie of the world h been achieved , bt hen te Unied tates enslave Canada and tried to enslae Jan as well , but he were able to defend themselves .
Japan launched a counter attak and enslaved h Uned Stte , and then proceeded to conqer t world .
A new r was ceate , it was the most brutal ti period in h history of mankind , it was known as mn thng most people nmd it " The pan Era " , b it was so brutal tat the official name w " The Dark Yelow r "
I wud like to recommend th folowng mve : " The perfume " .
This vie can be considered a classical thiller , t with svera aspects tt makes it unique in this gender .
Fst of al , the istorical eiod is the victoria a in France .
Landscapes ae rally wnerful .
The buildigs , dreses , a habits of popuation are dispayed in ul etail .
Seondly , we have an amazing cript that can be considered unique .
Te story tl us the importance of te erume in l aspcts of r lifes .
T movi 's main plot decribes e early yers of our tarrig , a poor orphan , wich tas advantage of his powerful smell sese to fn ou nw jobs .
We will discver te importace of a uniue fragrance nd how to mi h ngrdients in th right proportions .
This ea wil rate the atmosphere to tl us a story aot crie and ssion .
ially we wi discove a fantatic ending that we would never imagine though the moi watching .
h ovrall rate of this movie is eally high and it is a movie to remembr forevr .
Nevertheess this is not an a auiences movies , becae it ontain har scenes ot suiale f chidre .
If peope can rent this mvie or watch it online I would encourage wach it as st as possible .
Few other odern movies are so great in comparson .
e two hours tha u will spend watching the movie will beme niqe in your li .
Many peole believe tha public transport will be replaced by private one in the nearest utre .
Th ain reason is e connience of travelling by cars in comprson ith using pubic transport .
part from tat , there ar mn ohr benefits in buyng a ca instead of using ses or unergrund every y .
First of all , an automobile give uch a valuable thig as pivacy .
For example , driving a car we n wear whatever we at an listen to the music on any vole .
If th ca is large enough , it can be even a perfect plac fr sleep .
Additionally , if we are eage to travel utside the town in order to hav om est fom a hctic rhyth of lif , it wil be more comfortable for us to use our crs .
Only our n vehicle c provide us wt an oprtunity to in y quiet and pleasant pla ouside the city .
Public tranprt can ake us us to certain locations .
Ts , it is cear that prvat transport uch as automobiles h plnty of adntages .
On the ther hand , we a stuc with difrent problems whle traeling by car .
Fr instance , saying in traffic ams always steals muc our prcius ime .
Cr accidnts are e typcal reasn for ths phenmenn .
It mean that travelling by cars c ven be more dangerous than using public ransort .
Geneally , bus drivers are ch or experiened th autombie os , therefore , accidents caused by public trnsport happe quite rarel .
Ti makes travelling by public transport much safer .
hu , I would aru ht driving a car requires muc attetion n understading that careless behaviour on e road can make a seris amae to other people .
In conclusion , I believe that ubli transport ll eventually lo is dominance u to h act ha l popl want to be independent and travel on their own .
Anna knew tat it w gog to be a vy specia day for hr .
h was woen up very early by e un coming thrgh her window .
She opened er sleepy eye , smiled etly and g up from her bed idly .
She et downtairs to t oy bathroom and had a hoer .
After that , h resse up and went to the kichn to make a reakfast .
She turned on th mic and tarted to prepare a halthy meal .
After aetng delcious sla n diking ta , she went to e ro to do r ar d put th make - up on .
Anna s a bit stresd , but she a sre , that everything ill be lright .
While she s etting rea , s hard a doo bell .
She cm dow and opened the door - it w e moher .

Anna 's moher loked at her tenderl and hugd her one again .
She came in and noticed tt e dughter is a lite nervous , so she decided to ake a coffe , i and talk r a wie .
As they were talking , Ann 's best fends came up .

My all - tme fvourite sort is basketball .
I started playing at t ae of even , when my moher encouraged me to in a basketbal club .
It was ver enjoyable ro the onet , d as been a fantastic exprience to earn the sport togethr wh othr chilen .
nother key factor was the coc , h kew o to convey the skils and techniques to children .
Moreover , I wa ascinated by the eling of belonging to a am in hich ach memer hares e ame gol d valu .
Ths is an important feature that will als help anyone in all phere of lif .
One also learns to work ha and discipied in orr to chiev success .
All these points led to me playing basketball for almot thirty eas now n I 'm still hooed by it .
If smeone woud a me for advc on how to start laying basktball , I woud probably sggst tating wih a trial practise ad if the person enjoys it , he / s can join the cub .
When choosing a lub , I beiee it 's important that an expeience coac is present who knws how to teach t basics .

One y in the post , I had an argument wih a m wo studied in th same iversity as me , n I challenged him to fight wih me : I thought it would solve the problem between us .

That de me get crazy and angry , so I knock m down wh ny one nch .
Aer that he od the teacher who was responsible for at class , and called me ito her ro and asked me questions .
At that time , I was eall roud of myself that I could beat m so easily .
The ay after , I was hnking eely ad just realized tha I was wrong ad soud not hurt i becau I was angry .
I deided to alk to im ad ske him to forgive me .
I felt relieved he forgave me .

Hi , my name is riscila and I just realized tht I am a rter , oo .
I am Brazilian d I trted to lrn how to write in Portuguese when I wa 7 years ld .
I think hs period whn we tart to wre is magical , becaus we can access an enre nw commuication world .
rom 7 to 18 years o , I ainly wrote for scho during classes , homwork , a tests .
When I was 16 , I lid in Nicholson - PA - USA .
I was an exchange student n attende ig cool there .
hat ws the fist time my work as assessed by the way I rot in English .
is exprince was ery importan and mde me more confident about my English skills .
Back to Brazil , during colleg I strte researching and wrting aout econmics .
I lov economis , so I kept studying a I have t a masters and a PHD gree in lbo economics .
I h to writ a dissertatio and a thesis and , I ll not lie , these wriing processes were ve hard , bt I leane a lot about academic writing .
Today , I work as an economics prfesso at he edral University of Goia , in Brazi .
Because of my work , I ave to wrt all th tie to my students , to my colleagues n to the acaemic community in general .
I an to discuss t resul of my reserc ith evryone tat is interete in it , from Brzil or fom any othr plce in te wold .
Therefore , for me , writing in Enlish , nw , is ore important than eve .
I expect tat tis corse will help me deveop my nglih kills , so ht I can wrie my papers , communcate and discus my research in more effective way .
In moden word , public transport ecome less mpotant as travelling by c is said to be me cnveient . Traelling by car also reduces their tm of journey an tey do n't need to wit for a particular s .
It may as ecause as peple re getting richer hey do n't eed to go for a public ransort as more comfortable option is lways here waitig for em .
Thouh public tansport is more avantageous to t environment , people jst want to ge thi personal needs satifie .
The world is movng fater and evryne hs to be fas enugh to compete with ths modern world .
While comparin the awbacks of public tansport with modrnized vehicles , pulic transport may not sees to be a btter choc .
But this is not true .
Mre usge of vecles ay cause serious prblems sch as depletion of natural resources ad environmental isues such as pollution .
Altough h mainenance os of ca is quite expensive , it does not stop people frm usig as since conveniene maters to them the mos and not mone .
Many people think th public trnspot is only or poo n not r rch .
If it continues , no resource will be spared o th uture generation .
Everone should remmbe , " Natre has enough resurcs to stisfy u neds , ot ur red . "
Nowadays , ma peple around h gobe ae tryig to acquire a second language , whn it cmes to deide between laning in our own country versus learnig road , we can find everal pros d cons th might get us airly confused .
On he o hand , an advantage of tudying in your ow coutry is that you would be able to shr with people with the same problems durng thir erning process as y .
However , a major raback uld be the lak of exposure to te languge tat is itendd to be learnt .
On the othe hand , e most iporant advante of tudyig arod would be precisely , h exposure , which uld help you undestand the laguag ro nativ speakers ' ont of viw and be wae of how som expressions or words r actuall used .
However , as a isadvantae , we ust consider the cost of studying abroa , ecuse it ca be rather xpensiv .
To m up , the best way of learning English , or rather he est plc to do it depends on each person 's means and learning yle , u definitel it is possible to acquire a second anguae both at home and abroad .
Pele ty to skip Good Friday becue , her is no feast in th day .
Moreover , it is the sombrest day in a year , which recalls pople te Crucifiion cased by pope 's ins .
People refe to eet happiness and poitve thinking then talking out a death and a suffeing .

Accordingly , he autor compares the Eater to a pan prin estival , wee pople were joul ecuse of spring cmig just as a Christians 's cheerfulnes of the Resurrection .
2 . We flinch frm consideration of Good Friday because we do no like thinkig of a sad stution .
People choose pleasant ntertainments ntead of talkig abut a dth , a suffering n a sef - scrifce .
Today eple r not willing to arifice themselves for other people .

Above all , peole are not sd to undrg suffering and what is re brutal death .

Dear Ali ,
How e things with you ?
r u still rking ll h hors d ses preparing o your exams ?
I 'm sorry I haven't written f ae , t I a very busy with the chool project I had to do thi month .
Thak again for all yo hl .
I 'm very gad I can fnaly do something for you after everything you 've doe for me .
So you need informatio bot my counry 's eating cusos ?
el then , let 's start with th time we eat nd wha we eat at those moments he in ollad .
On weekdays , Dutch people ke their breakfast , hic usuall consists of a fe sadwiches , somewhere beten 7.00 and 8.00 a.m. In h weknd , we tend to slep in n therefore ake our breakfast a bit later .
Around 12.00 a.m. , mst people hav luh , whc also consists of sandwiches and is jst as light as breakfast .
he the cock strikes 6.00 p.m. , it 's time f innr , the ony warm mal of the d as well as e heaviest meal of t day .
Let me als tell you soethin about traditional utch meals .
he most imporat ones re probably hotcpotches : mashed potatoes d vegetables , oft combin with smoked sausage .
In my opinion , some of them a absolutely revoing .
A traditional utch meal which I think is fa more tasty , cnsists of little thick panckes , seved am wi eltd butter and icig gar .
Those pancaks are cled " poffertjes " .
They an be eaten any tme of th a , for breakfast , lunch , supper ...
Wole genrations are brouht up wth thi dih , yummy as it is .
Is this nogh information for your proec ?
If y want to knw more bot Dutc eatin habits , just wre to me , d I 'll wite back , giin you a other information you mgh need .
Anyway , I really ned to stop ow , ice I hae got to get down to my homework .

My favourit y to travel is most definitely by plan .
There e many reasons why plane travel is h wy to go .
First , on a plan , I can get to my destination mch faster .
his means I an actually go place .
In a few hous me , I a t to sm f - awa destination .
I can mk it a quick tp , o .
I cn go to Paris fr a long weekend , for exame .
The plane will get me there quckly so tat I can av
go shopping , a ome lovly rech mels , drink ts of ne and return before work on Monday .
Boats trp e lon and bring .
I wt on an Alaskan cruise in 997 .
It a freezing ld and ost of th time we
ere js sitting on the hi wit nothing to do t et .
I also go a sic .
I definitely do n't reommend it .
Trains ar also oring , uless o tae a bullet train , and I get mtion sickness .
Therefore , when it coms to ped a being able to go places , planes are definitely he best tpe of trasportation available .
I highly recommed a plne tri as soon as pssble .
In today 's intercultural world , one of t best asses people nd natons can have is tolerance and a deep appreciation of cutura values diffret from their o .

I ha never felt so nervous ... I looked in the audience , everyone was looking at me .
On the lt side I saw my prents , okay , nhale , exae , I can do this .
I ha always reamd of ti , being a msial star on broawy .
I conpeted in singing competitions when I was younger and I ok acting casss .
My parent aays spported me , they lways beievd that I coul do this .
I arrived in New York a four months ago .
When I as taking a lk through the neighbourhood I saw ts potr bot the musical wicked ad they ee lking r soeon to lay the ad .
Of curse I took ths opportunity nd two week lae I d to do audition .
I fel like I mess up but th next y I got a all that I got the role .

Many pepl sill consider teevisin only as a w to relax , get entertained and stop tinking abut ll h problems tat might wry them .
It is also important , houg , not to underetimate all the educatonal possibilities ha it gies you , as sometimes you can lan oe rom a documentary than from a scol book .
What emerged fom e dicussion we a in class , is that plnt of stuents spn their fr time watching useless reality or TV ows , rocratinating instead of sudyng or school .
As it is a very comon phenomenon btween teenars , schools should show them tha televsion as enbles you to ear oething new .
A cle xmple is that wtchin elevision in another languae is of vit importance if you aim to lea ne vocabularies or improve your cmprensive skills , and it makes studying a language really fun nd enjoyable .
On h ohe hand , it is difficult to focus nd p attention whie you are in frn of a TV screen .
Getting distracted is extremely likely , threfore pele atchig educatona programs may end up switching the TV of or tunng over to nothr annel , as a good movie or any ohr entertainment is way mo appealing .
Had I choe whether considering television educatioal or not , I wold definitely a it is .
Neverteess , we shoud us it in an apprpriate way nd be caeul about wha is the oures of the infrmatin told during a tv ho , as th might be misleing .

Sarah o off her bike and looked throuh t windo .
She immediately niced that the lass wa bren , probably shatterd in pieces by tse boys who invited her to ply th hem at the nsion .
Sarh w not exactly the coolest girl in the scool bu she came anyways , thinkig tht abe f one se woud be acepted in their group ... u no o as to be en behd that window .

She was just abut to open e door to check the inside when ddenly a scream ecoed fom te house , te or slammed open and the grup arted running at ful sped chased by four ig spiders who just discovered that their hoe had just been occupi .

Somethig was wron !
S as sue about tht .
S kn hr usband betr than herself and had noticed his strange behavior for a while .
Usuallly he was energetic , ll of confidence , reay to ary .
But not ny re .
He was absent - minded l th time , he did not iten to er d hen h asked i a questio , he just shrugged his houlders or wrinkled h nose .
aye they uld not avoid h eve - year ic .
Mybe he had a mistress .
B h had no inntion to gie up .
S had fought to hd for tis lfe nd she would no et their long - stadin relationship to be ruined jt lie ha .
Tey me ch other nine years ago .
By acciden he tougt .
Accidet which a been wel prepard by her .
h ways planned r tps carefully .
Her motr was a shy woman wh did ot know ha to do to escape rom poverty d evn toug she had o or the jobs all t ime , they did t know if they would hv omewere to seep te next night .
So he wa her escape .
He was wel - ff an funny .
He a not stuid u you ould nt exet an perls of wisdom rom him .
He hd ver worked but they ha en living in a 40-room hse ith a he grden and so many servants ha she oul n remembered heir names .
Ty had ver worried abot ony - all bil were paid by his trut found .
Who would an to lose tis ki of lifestyle ?
So she decied to as hi straght away .
" r y haing a mistress?",e asked one morng when they were having breakast .
He ad t sen tat coming and became white as a sheet , raised hi eyebro and just exploded .
" Hw could y en say that ? I wou never ever do thi to you . "
At that momnt he was like a bear with soar head .
She wanted answers ad to have the he needs to be alive not dead of heat attak .
So she tried to cal him on .
" What is goig on than ? And do t ie to me ! Yu have alays be a very ba liar ! "
He held his breath fo a seond , pused is lps
and then wrs just slippe of his tongue .
" We are bren .
We do nt have y money left .
So I av found a job " .
" Are you kidding me ? Y have never wrkd in your if .
What can you possly do ? "
" I am a porter .
Every morning I went to the prt and unshipped .
Nbody ter knws me so o shold be afraid ta some of our friends would recognise me .
Nobody wil neve knw hat we are oor now " .
It was her turn to hol her breath .
She ws just nub .
He w strog as an ox , for sure , but woking as a portr ?
Ths should be sm kn of oke .
He was waiting for her respos .
She had aays een level - headed ad ted to ce up with a la .
" We c move to smaller houe or ired some of the servants ? "
" That is impossile ! Wht oud our friend sy ?
An where I wul t my wi collecio ? I would rather wok as a porter than live in a 20-oom house "
They definitely a dfferent de of pover .
But before clearing hat she wanted to ask ne oe iportant question :
Where , for G 's sake , had the money gone ? !
It w a cold winter afternoon in England when Michael was born .
Sine he ws a little o people around he ne tht tis chil a a strange character .
He wa realy oody and he could move fm exreme appinss to the most bslute sadness in a few seconds .
he he gew up he struggled to as hs illness and he became a sane , strong , handsome ung adult man .
However all eople in his neighborhoor eard him bease of is ps .
Michael a always felt alone and he a e up with tht situation .
Therefoe , he decided that he was goin to et ew eope o beginning a w lif .
At the age of twenty yeas he acheed a ob as a pesonal taier where he eared eough ony to en a ft .
In this wy , he mve to hs w neigborhood whre everybody respeed im .
One a he fell in love ih o of h emale customers .
She was a bautiful , blnd , tall , Polh girl called Magda who worked as an architct in a studio in the cener of Lodn .
Thi relationship hd en excelet since first ti tha they hd met each other and tw mnths later they decied to becom lovers .
Michael 's ne life was working out fr the bes t it is very ificult for anyn to ecape from s past .
lthough h life was perfect , he ega to fee si and sad ad he remembered is pa life when he ws a hld .
Slowly he became illness one or time .
Although he had been trying to ind ts , his personal problems we ovbious and Mga dd n't fel well with him .
Finll thir relationship roe up d Michael fel in is illness eeper than ever .
Tre months ater Magd a walkin with h new boyfriend an ichel sa em , he w otaly insane d jeaous , he caught an enrmous stk fro th narest tree nd he bt te as srong as he could .
h attack lasted to edless minutes whic ee full of uffering , blod and an .
The oung couple of lovers fell on the oor n Michael g ay to his home .
His nsne evil mind go wy ntil his fat .
At th moment everyhig changed , he remided h childhood , hs recovery and his sn life , the Michael clsed the doo a knew at at omet he had de a mtake .
In my pinion pblic tasport is doomed , ecause travelling by car is much ore covenint d at te ae tie e easiest way to reach an estinaton you wish to gt to .
On the oe hand , public tranprt is slow n uncomfortable .
People hav to t nx to other people they do n't know for a ng ti , in oher wrds , yu may be siing nt to suspicious passengers .
Pickpockets are frequen and you might end up bin robbed , losin yor money , credit ard nd personal ID card as wel .
On he other han travelling by ca allows you to establish yr w ac , even when o tavl to a place yu do o know so well .
hs means y c set te ti ou want to eve , becas yo do ot hve to espct a specific timebae .
Furthermore , you can chse an alternative road , rater than taking a in road .
This wy y il hv the chace to hav more relaxing ourney thrug the cuntryside , affic wl no be so intens and aggrssiv , nd finall you can plan the time you nt to rive , using a G or other technolology to hel you plan your jrney .
To sm up , raveling by public transport can be advantageous we you travel inside a tw , u we you hae to tavl outside your specific teritory , nothin is bete ha a r .
Michael has been worin very hard , and just semd to eally be oer whelmed by all e work he had een crying out throgh he course of h month .
Well on this particular mrning , Michael em to be getting lon quite wl , he appear to be enrgetic an very vibrant that particular mornin .
His atention to detai peared to be trst worty and correct , and normally h attention to detail is not somthing tat is challeged because of w reliable he is .
Wll as the d s coming to a close Michal ad a disinct feeling ha something jst w n't correct ut he dismissed th feeling nd contind with his da as he uslly oes .
Well the days reponsibilities in Michael 's ind had been sucesfully accomplished a he felt relly confident abo l he had accomplished .
Needles to y Mihel could n't have been any mo deceie thn he had ralizd , because the nfortunate thig is that whn he was oig his walk trouh on al of h department the inventory ta was suppos to be submitted as in fac inaccurate .
Becaue after Michel closed th doo and kw at tha momnt he had ae a mistake .
Dar Jane ,

Nothing is worth than getting stressed out about .

I cnsider myse lucky becau I knw I a always count on them , d becase they love me as much as I oe them .
However , this does n't mean at my arens , escially when I wa a child , aways told me " yes " and mde me do whatever I wanted to .
On h contrr , I gro up with many " no " , ad I do ot lways aree th the in diffent siuatios .
But they auht me al the important alue and od manners , and I 'm ateful to them for tis .
r owadys I e aroud me is wh are pease in veryting by their parents : they b them haever hy want , a behave as " friends " .
I believe that this 's wrog , because by doing so he 're not doing their el .
Parents mt be parents , and friends must be friens .
is does n't ean tat prent shud ep themselves distant from hir so ; on the conrar , a son sould tak to his fmily , skin for adce or just to confront eac other , because cmmunicaion is at the base of relationships of every kind .
I ust thk ha ac of us in our life plays a role , an that doing parents is not an esy job , u hy should t to do eir bes .
he Miracle rort Bangkok ,
The miracle is an etraordinariy large resort .
Counting 33 storie in te in building it cul be the biggest resort in Bangkok
The resort mainly focuses on chidren , hic is in my ys a good idea .
The focus on hldren ca be und in he huge contibution th Kis Club h on the daily life in the hotel .
You can find Kds Club 's Members everywhere in th hotl , except for your om .
T hoel hnles prvcy very well n I can guess ost of the guests wll apprecite it .
However , walking distance in the oel are way too fa for famlies wih yung children .
You in yourself walking five hundred meters to the imming pool .
Ta doe n't seem to r , u whn o have mal chilen , you could be walking thi twelve ies a day .
A quick trip to the toilet chages ito a 1 kilometer hike , which is not pleant we y have sll chilrn .
In cnclusion , he Miracle Rsrt is a ery beautiul ad appealing place to go .
There a plenty of things to do , and e amince in t hotel is reaed , so you cn really enjoy our holiday .
A oe compact buidin would be mre aprecited by most of the people .

A Le Affair with Baking
hat is it about cooking shows ?
h is it tht whenever Ia Garten , Ana Olson or Nigela Dason is on , I td to op everythg tht I 'm doig nd jut get fixated on e TV ?
The Food Netork has become my favourite channe I can tune to it the whole dy !
It 's so relaxing and er inormativ , I never gt bord .
Cookin shows r n to watch , u my ot avurite shows r those but cakes an pastries .
I really enjoy bkng tha I often by books abot it .
Cheesecake for me is the simplest yet most sophisticated cake there is .
To ma n , just hik some eggs ad sugar , dd some milk and a e drops of vanilla d then pr onto a grasd ke n ad ak .
Afte a ople of minutes , take the cae o of the oven a let it ol own .
It 's best served when chilld , so better wt r a few mre mnues before diving int it .
To decorate the cake , ip sme cram n top wih frsh fruit .
Introdction
Th purpose of thi rprt is to outline some aspets of my experience , sc as , ith hom I taed , hre I spent the week a wh paces I visited .
I will also ke reference to sme suggestions tha mig help to iprove h excange programme .
Particularities of the exchange
ecenly , I spnt a eek in Switzerland as a part of a students exchange programme .
I staye wit a loca fmly , whc appens to be t fmily of h person tha stayed wih me when he oo part in the same programme .
s nam is John , and like me he is geting a degree in Phisics Engeeering in th he hat someday he a work at a rserch ener , such as CERNE , convinientely placed a few mes away from s house .
I strongl recmend ta the programe orgaisers shld make interest free lan , available to people wihing to participat in an exchnge .
This would allow considerable numrs of talnted tudnts to bnefi from an opportunity whch he wuld otherwise be nable to te .
Befre adresing h qustio of what is etter for young eople , I would like to emind that both activities ( spending time on a computer n watching televison ) are harmful or childen's / teen 's healt .
At e the side it 's imposble to imaie o lif withut computers d televisin .
With te help of computers young eope an met ne frien , find out a lot of information , take part in orum and discussions .
Surfing the Intrne nee imagination , loical thinking and knowldge .
Young peope are abl to choose wht ey want to watch / read / listen to , and te choice is practically unlimited .
Television ca n't give uh an oppotunity .
Precisely here is found t crux of t problem .
Thee ae plny of re ites with otent r from mraliy ; many computer game impose cruelty .
And the idea that , spending tim in Internet 's ats you eople devlp hir social skls , is problemtc .
I wi it woul be so !
But getting ue to the Intene 's rules of comunication , ty migh find it diffcult to face up to ralit , make friends in h real worl .
For my ar , I sed a o of time on my omputer ( learin Engish and working ) .
u whn I wan to relax I 'd rater watch TV with my friend tan loter awy time itting alone in fron of the comput !
This resturant is recommended to me by my unt ho was working just around the corner of this restaurant a few years ago .
This restaurant specializs in southeast Asa cuisine a it is alled The Cai .
Personally , what I love bou tis restaurant is the ambiane .
It has a uique moden - rustic interior degn suitable fr any ocaion be it a irthday party , faml gathering or ven a date wih yur loved one .
Besies ta , this restaurant is locad in h hart of one of th most oular cities in southeast Asi , Kuala Lmpur .
I was own wy by e brethtaking vew of the ciy from my winow .
om my expriene , I el that h food served in this restarant is of ine quity not to mention w deiciou t food is .
ot only that , I ws ost o choices as I flipped e meu as there was a uge variety of southeast Asian oo that ranges from ha food , Indosian od , Chinese food and the list oes on .
T food on he menu was amazingly not for ilusration purposes ny as the fo tey served looed exactly ike e one in th menu .
In my opinion , I think this is the most suitable restauran for tis special occasion as eveyoe woud ave a wide vriety of fod to oose fom nd just et t iw of the ci enhance the night .
So as e end of trm is getting cser and losr , many students ar being stressed ut ad it is cetainly t differe fr me .
t if you know hw to deal with you nervousity during exa period , you can take the success of passing eas for granted .
Firstl , crate ou imeable .

Plac it in th ot vible ad strategical point in you rom and stick up to it .
Speaking of etal ad psical helt , you should definitely get enough sleep .
ithout a mind and body egneration , y will not be ble to learn as fast and as effectively as you wod after a od et .
To kick off ur day , give ur body eoug eergy , in he fom of protes .

Commnicaton is on of h igest robems among today 's teenger .
I remembe whn I was a kid the only thing I ue h phone was to call my rind to play on the tret .
The telephone as connience , someting usd to help people comunicte , to make teir lives esir .
Internet changed people 's routine .
Today , te Internet is n of th ost effetive and effiient ays to communicate .
Telephnes chage , technology beame smarter nd aows people to stay connected verywere ey go .
Ahough e large nmber of advantges that Internet d phns ve to us , the s of technology affect people 's ability to communicate ac to fac .
We communicate throgh our accounts , emails or chats .
We ut take turs talking ( chatting is maybe more corrct to sy ) and most of e ties wihout y aim .
sig messages peoe forget to s grammar or ven make fl sentance .
Bt tht 's not the iggst pobem .
The worst thig is ta people do n't know w to talk to each other , ow to make cnversation with n people or ven though old friends .
Emoticons relace emoton , chats replace calls , usernams replace people .
Nowadays comunication ac to face is something rare a most of he times accident .
Peopl just tk urs talkig wtout putting any purose or feings .

T beauty of tis sport is hat as ng as you got a ball you a spend hurs dribbling or shootg on ou own .
I think tat you shoud start practicing is sort bcuse it helps you phyically an mentally and it is a god y to socialize .

He ha taken her t to a five - star estaurnt , to which she insisted that it as t much , whh t Michael to insist that it as ay .

A tal wa of felings sprked inside Michael 's head as he mvd his lis along with arianne 's .

Parents rk otsie the home al d .
Although they want e et fo heir cildre sometimes is difficult because he are tired d tey tend to prepre jn fd and allow them to spend hei time on the internet or laying th he game machine .

I 'm goig to talk about doctor w , a British i - fi TV show abo an aien caled the Doctr ho traels thugh ime and space in a police box called the TDIS ( Time an Relative Dimensin in Spc ) .
h first episode aire in 963 and since tn Doctor Who s bee one of the ms famous si - fi TV shows on telision .
Actually , last yr s its 50th annivesay and to clebrae it a special episoe in 3D was broadcast .
Since he TV how ire the character of the Dcto has been plae by 12 ators , th newes n was nnounced on ummr last ear , whic is when I as visiting Lonon with my amiy .
It relly caught my attention how relevant Doctor o is in th UK because amost every time I turned on h TV there ws somne talking out who coud be th ew Doctr , it appeared in the news , in newspapers and he day the B ws gog to rveal the ne of th act the evn made a speca shw about it .
However , I really liked experiencing that beause I hd nev ee the med in Sain pay so much atention to a TV show .
ince I as in London , I thght it culd iit The o Shop , it is a ho dedicatd to Doco Who and it a a museum with costumes an ther things ta have ppeaed in he TV show .
We di n't have much time to go there becas it a far from u hotel so I had to go nl wt my father whi the ret of my family was somewhere else .
If we h stae more tme we would ha bn able to spend more ime at h shop ut anya , I loved going there and meeting other popl who also ike Docto Who and I bought oe merchandise from th shp .
When te BB finall announe who w going to play as e 1th Doctor , many fans got upset abou tei choice beuse he thought the new acor ws too old and they sai tey did n't ie it .
But hpefully no vryone ws like ta .
When an imortant TV so gos through ch a b chane ot everbody lkes it , that is why te sme thing hppened wn th BB announced who would be payin as e 11th Doctor .
Nobody likd him at firs u now that he is leaving everybody lve him n wants him to sty .
Acually , I 'm o of those fs who are sad about he 11th Doco leavi because he is my favourite one , as he was e one I experincd Doctor Who wh ecase I started wtchng h TV ho when he ws playing the main le .
Anyway , eore the BC had annuncd wo was ong to play he octr 's role , te fns had statd aking suppoitions abot who oud act as him .
Sme said ha he would be played by others famous British acor u thes thought ht an actrss houl play the ne oe .
I found ou abo Doctor o because a friend of mi saw people talkin abut it online and s told me aout it .
hen I starte watching it I thouh it as a bit weird b I edd up really likig it .
Thanks to it I ae met a lot of peop who share he sm interests as I do and I have dscovred some of my fvourites TV shows .
I like Doctor Who beause tim travel ha alwas caught my attentio , also I like it beause the plot is incredible , something tht appned on seaon one can be onncted with some of the ast episodes .

In the fir place , it sems to me that it is really important , th for hildre ad parents to communicte in rde to organize teir lives taing into account t changing schedules .
However , it is also remarkable that here are pror times to ak on t phone , and pror tms to learn .
Of course , we ll hav th right to communicate whenever we want but , most , whenever we ee .
sing t one during breaks t the students fos on the lesson n he , have a i of disration when they re not ther and , what is mo , keep parents relaxed bcaus te can communicate wi their childr and talk about what tey ne .
That is hy I totlly gree with ichrdson 's modality dealing wi this mporant issue which is prsen in students , schools n prnts les nowday .
Secodly , I would like to mntion that I aree wt the periment hat is aking place in soe districts about permitting studts us thir mobil phos for eductinal prpoes , nd what is mo , ih Richardson 's facing this issu .
Technoogy is n of the most imortat parts of ur lves , so we shold incoporae it to r abits .
Of couse , when we ae taing out children and education , it may se a bit complicat ice th subject s both advantages and disadvantags .
For instance , it is really otiating for students to use technlogy in the clssrooms .
Hover , tachers run the risk of losing eir responsibility her , and students can lose their eucational w lookng at the hones as a way of entertainment insea of as a a to make educatn njoyabl ad effective , as you say in one of your aragraphs : " The ichardsn ecisio is a sound alternative to stdents scretiely using thei pnes under their dsk " .
I nsider at soehing shoud be done in order to balance pr and cs of having moil phones pesnt at chools becuse , firstly , sudents are h os who ust be present nd , wht is more , tir lernig pross also mu be there .
As I said , it is really important that parnts can cmmunicate wi thir chilren because they ar taking care of tem n they e thir parents , so ty ave h right to communiate with tem whenever th ne .
Apart rm that , I strongly elieve that technology can be incororaed in t classroom , ut eachrs and schools are t oes w ave to control this activity so that it n be ositie both for students and teache in rdr to make th lerning process moe mtvating ad effecti .
All in l , I thi that schools shol not tp taking into account this iportat subjec .
Technolo d , mostly , mbile phones are ar of children d parents lives , so chool do n't have to ban it , t look or alernatives in order tht they do n't ke a negative effet in education .
Richarson 's methodology is fantast and I think ta thre a mre , nd it is impotant tat we nw them in order to be inrmed abt ti importn issue .
I lk forwad to reding more articles about this sbject .

Th is e orld of globalisation where the entire world is o arket .
Every person is markeing imsel ; is slling himself ; is prsentng himef as a decorated ft - item .
Tis is h , athoug we have h luxury of extravagant knwledg under ou feet becase of interne , we encouer coplictions and complexities in th decoding of our relatnships and in decihering this perennial low of knowledge .
I , fr ha reson , certainly agree with the staement of te gen issu .
With kowledge an infomtion , things become comphensible ut or complex .
The relgion of Scientology is known as one of he fatet grwin relions of e wod .
It , today , has milins of foloers who believ in its philosophy that reincartion is the ruth and a uman fls tied - up because of te onstant ul of th srins of h past lives .
Interestingl , Scientology practitioners use technoloy to prove their hypothetical statments , o he hav constructed achnes tat exhibit t working of bras through waves and softwares that question a practitioner and provide him with a solution to is orries .
In cntras to is , the religions tat have surivd since the earlier tmes had dicree knowldge , however they hd a mc deeper impact .
They wee impe yet profound , relyn on the comprhensible philosophies of forgiveness an karma .
Scientology provs ho t acquisition of widespread knolege has't stoppd the birth of e religions , however , irically , it has ae the philosophis of life mre dramatic wih t mysterous omplexities of tchnology .
Likewise , there are many cospiracy theorts in te worl who time an again irculate rumours regarding h xistenc of a secret organisatio ( illuminati , for instanc ) tt runs the world secretly an pos fo all e r - tme ars and terrorist - attacks .
The theorits ascerai ta the organisation is ar religius and part political ; it les over e ntenational media , theeby being mnpotent .
Furthmore , ey concoct stories ad concepts , publicse them wil making animated versions a oe t internet .
Te brilliance of their presenations is so acute hat an orinay n is lmot force to fee enlightene in his ignorance , finally becomin braiwashed .
The same tehnique is ud by politicians , conoclasts and leaders wh polte th mind of e eople throu th medum of technology .
They present coplex infrmaions so smrtly that an ignoant fool feels like a sagacious monk , whence he bcmes te folowr and a voter .
Thus , by all mans , today we hav an easy accssibiliy to knowledge and we hav a wide rae of reources to allote d obtain endless inormation .
Nevertheless , her is a stomach - wrenching mystery nd indeciphrabe oes aound hat sometimes makes a coon man wonder abou h vulnerable existnce ad unknowingly beig - exloited life .
I choose oion A : I think it is a god idea or cldren to travel on public transit .
Ther ar several reasons why I support tis coce .
First , it is unnecessary to spend more money on schoo buse beause by Grade 5 children are able to tak care of themselves and each other .
They can communcate well d ae war of dangeru situatons .
For example , if the see runk or dty eople on pubc buses , they could avod sitig near them or eort hm to the u drive .
ecod , it is a good opportunit to edcate the in lf skills such as knowing ot to sit in priority eas or lev itte on the bus .
In cntrat , I hik tat he arent who sist thr children shuld on trave on school buss prtec them too much .
In daily life , many youngters need to go to school and bk by public transportation .
In other wods , if prens spl ter offspring thn they my ecome too dependent nd incapal of fnctionng well in societ lae on .
In concluion , it is not only a goo chce to te the cidren on an adventre , ut als help them beome independent young auls .
I think this y can asis them in adapting to society arl .

Subject : End - of - er party
The aim of ths proposal is to compare the t proposed vnes Riv Boat Disco and Milord Comedy Club and to recommend oe ased on he surve carried out among the students .
Entertainment and fo
No ny does Rivr Bo Disc s its own experienced DJ , but it lso has a bufet which is or thn appropriate or this occasion .
Although Milford Coed Club offers a fu nigh ith ur establishd comdian , the ny food availale is snacks .
However the main isadantage of e ico is ht it ends vry earl at 10:30 pm , wheras the comed club is ope util 2 am .
rie
e pricing for the dsco is vy reasonable because it offers the nue , entertainment ad od for $ 25 .
vn tugh the price is $ 5 smaller o comedy club , it is wtout fd d by th ed of the nih I do n think ere would be much difference .
cation
The boat is located at h Crofton Harbour ad some ens of trasprt wold be necessary to gt hre .
It wuld be possible to rganize a bu , which ould be preferae to gng separaely by cr .
However the comedy club is asy to fd and is ccssible by metro and tai .
Recommendation
I woud suggest the ver Boat isco because not ony dos it offer a bffe , ut ls the peopl are me likely to converse wi each other while listening to sic thn to a comedian .
" Manjiae Di Roma " - An Italian Restaurant
This Italian rsturant is in Mo√ß√£o d near the school .
It ws oped about fr yrs ago by two frnds o had previouly worked at pizza plces .
As yu entr te restaurant u are met with the traditional Italian restaurant red towels nd a bt of a rusic feel , behnd the couner you can se the cooks making the pzza .
Tere is a ret vaiety of ishe , fr starters to min dishs an dessrts , my recommendation is garlic bread as a stare .
As a main dish you can choose anything from pas to izz of ll kinds ( even choolte ) .
This resturant is ey affordable , te prices are extremely reasonable , especily if you 're a stunt , becaus there 's a special mnu called " student 's mu " were you chse w ingredients fo you pzza ith or without Fench fries an a rink for about three uros .
Everyone in the saf is extrely nice n very often the oners cme to make small ak with the liets .
A in al , I thk this wooul be the best restaurnt o our las to go , sice it 's cloe to the school , it hs od prices and a friendy ambience .
Alo everyone noys Italian food , so veryone wold be plesd .

It is amazing .
Becase of h lack of space , pele hd come wt a brilliant ia of creating these floating ouss , they e made of a special type of glass d hve a sphrical hae .
By finding th solution , they ae me space to work on earth n they even rotect he environent .
Not to mention th huge adantage tat pope e protected fro earthquakes becau these houses do n hae dirt conact with the art .
his ida is oe tn brilliat !
When it comes to their obs , people work on earth , like oldtimes .
e wa they go to work is worth knowing .
They hv car , not like te car eople fom 014 we ud to , ut they stil cal them ths way .
These ars can go ow to teir destination a th , go up again ntil te drir pushes a button .
Thi buton is lled " find me and come to me " .

Once the button is pushed the car ins he driver a literlly picks im up .
The streets look al new nd improved .

People are still huan eing and act completely norma .
They eem hppy th the w the ive an embre the change in everything .

I read your adversement in th Cloud magazine ad I cnsder it an interesting experience .
I 'm an Italian naive spaker aged 27 ad I 've ee sudyng por Science at Mila Uniersiy .
In 2012 I got th Cambridge first certificate in English and I 've ben imrving my Frech to pass te eam .
It 's six mnths since I stated teching ymnstic in a primary school ne Milan an I discovered that cildren a mre competitive d honest than adlt and I appreciat his .
I am also aware tht hy are reckes , so I recently attended a First Ad course , which has given me the cofidence to dea with mergncy situations .
I lways try to motivate hm wth se educational pa d I make the understand o imortan it is t group .
The schol wl be close in Summer , so I 'll be available from e 15t of June to e 3th of eptember .

Taking a gp - ear before starting a universiy is a lifetie oportunity for lots of eopl .
It 's a time to develop oursef , to travl , to find riends .
You ca so spend that im working and saig moey r future years on niversty amp .
It is the only tim in or life to do tat , to be hones .
After you fnish studying , you will have to immediately start working unless yo wa to live wh ou pares fo h rest of ur fe .
But the ear rght afer you finish hig school is a perfect me to fd yoursf , to ecide what y want to do with our if .
You can go on a rd tp rund yr country or travel somewre vr distant n learn things you 've never heard bout on our ow skin .
It oud also be potentially yo as chance to sped so much time ith you hig scol frend .
You wll deinitey part or wys during college and tis way you c make memories that wi last r a lifetime .
I think everyone should take a ya of after leaving chool .
You only live once and wasting such a geat posability is unthinkable .
Ove e last decaes , the spread of technology in ou aly lfe hs marked h begining of a new a .
Computers , mobi phones , h Internet ave undubtdly changed our way of thinking and behaing .
But can we safely rega ti technological advance as a proper achieveent of modern times ?
ertainly , cmputes n similar devices gi us te priceless opportunity to mke our ives simpler .
From booking a flight to videocall a distant fren , anything seems vry handy owaays .
However , the mai drawback of such advanc is that we now rely more on computers than on ou capities .
We are slowly but inesoably loosing readinss to solve robems , unless we can suf the Internet , so tat en a single y withou technology woud urn ot to be a nihtmar .
ow mn tms in the last ten years have we given up GPS and used a common pper map f a trip ?
Jt a fw , right ?
Ralty is tht the fast - paed orld we r currently livig in is stealing us u ow tme .
Nobody ge lt anymre , nobody discover something on his own .
We all alk dw he me ath because this is how it is mea to be .
We conslt Tripadvisor , we die for positve ratings and we increasingly forg to care bout simple things .
In my vi , we shuld l riconsider he rol tt cputers hav gained in our lives .
Technology is n reality and should never replace it .
I had never fel so nervos before in my lie ... !
It ws the last year I was attending the igh chool nd fil exams were aproaching fter than I thought .
Sudenly a plethora of concerns filled my ed up : wat to do afer the shol ?
What are my pns fo te future ?
I did n't ow anythng at all .
The only thi I kew was the da of the exams ws bcoming more treatenig as tm wn by .
nd finll , as fr ll , th day arrived .
The most stressful day of my life for sur .
I remember I began to bite my knuckles because of h tenio , an as bcause of a girl near me who cul n't tp cing nerousy ( it 's a pet pee of ine , I have to admit it ) .
Then en finally it w my turn I seated in rot of e teachers and , slowly , I introduced my seech .
Fifteen mutes later it w a over nd I felt a rand n erson .
After ts evnt I n co th eerythin !
As it w sad befe , he brief time of observation dos no low obtaining tha mh nformaton about ow CLL is relly implemnted in a particular educatinal contex , een so e ata collected n e folowing cnvesation wi t teacher , contributed to oain an interesting picture abut how Arts ad Crats is onsidere and cried ut une CI umbrela .
CLL implementation is always a chaleng for e teacher , but it seems to be evn me difficult whe talking about ubects as Arts and Caft whh ar more based on the acquisiton of skills and he development of anther lauage , the artistic .
How to prode student with more real and relevant input , in the dai routine of an art class , sems to be a dae fr Ar ad Caft teachers , wo need to bing together t development of the artistic langue and he leaning of a foeig language .
Despite the difficulties ta CLIL teachers have to overcome , t tuth is ha th atmosper of CLIL lessons is in me way specil .
What surprised me more positively was h level of eer support , t cooperatin n th comradeship .
It is interesting to e how the stdent resot ec ther looking for help in a natural way , without h interveton of the teacher .
Peer supor is somehing that taches expect and promote in all ubjets , but it seems to emeg moe genuinely when talkng about CLIL atmsphere .

Mny people have he impression tha eaning a language is only possile through rd work : studyng rammar rules , learnig vocbulary by heart and bryng your head in a book .
However , there are in ct sevrl methds tt you n emly houd yu want to eome a liguist .
In is essay I wil dscus two of thee : te immersion mthd , and the clasroom method .
Firsty , t mmersin method takes t inpiratin om he way in wih we a lernt to spea ou natur tongue : implicitly .
With this metod , learnr ae simly expos to the target langug , either by going abrad to le in e country where it is spoken , or by having a native tachr .
Thr is no explicit ocs on gammar ; insad , the learners ae expected to " absorb " the anguag and its rue .
This metho s t avantages , as it is he way we al lean to spak , and so it is arguably more natual .
Aothr dvantage is that studets ae unencumbered by oercomlicated , onfusin metalanguage .
Secondly , t classroo ethod is e oe ih whc ost students ( especially if they are oldr ) ae famliar .
earners e normally auht in their mother tongue , and r given rammr ues , whih they then ply to the langge they are learning .
This method als has ts benefits , t least logistically speaking , snce many students do n't have cess to nativ peakrs or r ot able to tave abroad .
Furthermore , sme eaners respon beter to an epicit focus on rules , hch me thm awr of h stakes they are making .
Wil both mthods cleary hav their advnages , I elieve that ut lmitig students to either oe or h other can hae a negative efect on language learning .
Having a native speaker will ve student maximum exposure to the language , whie at e sme time a focus on ules will gie thm t tols for self - correction and sel - study .
I fully beleve hat thi combination method is h mot effective way r sdents to learn nglis .
No we are ging to evaluate the an charactheritcs and diffrences betwen a pellet stove n a pelt boier .
Let 's start to cus ou attentin at th pellet stve .
The diagrm shws a compac sructure ad the siplicity of the achine ; it has thre main sections : the feed sction , the combustion camber an the blower(i.e .
fan ) .
In the frt oni pt it is pssile to feed with the ul ( i.e. the pellet ) that leads to h combusion chamber ere h pelet wil burn to generate h heat necssar to warm up he i .
Beneath he comustin chaber there is he ash tray necessary to cllect the ah geeated by the comustin of te pellet .
As manion above th hat is necessary to wrm up te ai that , thnks to te an , will be blwn out to h room in order to wr up the external mbien ( e.g. oo , batrom , kicen ... ) .
Ti is a pretty copact machin bt it 's not very effcient nd ery clan .
Actually , it prodces a high amont of ollution such as a a exhausted gas tat contains micr- d nano - partice .
e 's focs now on he pellet boiler .
The structure is prty muc e same as th pellet stove , the difference is hat instead of a fan here we have a pum due to the fact ha e goa of the boiler is to warm up waer and send it to the heaters all oer the ous , so it 's edded a pump to do ht nstea of just a fan ( the pourpose of a a and a pump it 's the same : move luid rm a pot A to a pont B , but in e case y ave to oe i and in te second case aer ( they have a diferen density : wter as 00 imes t density of air ) .
Lie in he stove tere is a feed section where you an feed th pelet that ill go drecly to h combustion chamber ( according to the control system ) in order to br it and generate te heat to warm up the water .
N , thanks to he ump the ht water is able to reach th upstairs oom .
Basically th wo rely on h same methds : burnng pellets to war up a fluid ( air fr the stov d water for the boiler ) .
My om wn , an inernational ci , attracts millions of torits from al over te word ever year .
Koing a clean and tidy city is no less ppeling to h tourists than bautful scenry and bargin shopping , both the authority and he citizes understand th ned to kep o city clean in order to eep t tousts coming , therefore tey ae seros in protecting the environmn .
To keep he ct clan an tidy , people adopt an environmentally frendly atiude in daily life : ey refuse littering , if they can t find a ubbish bn around , they keep rubbish in small plastic bg ; at home , they seprat the recyclable ite from the rubbish before they et rid of the rubbish .
hey follow t government 's avice to t h ir coditioner temperature at 25 degrees of Celsius .
Th governmen plays a crucial rl in taking ae of the environment .
It build sewage ites o the ispsal of he ct 's wase .
It educates the citiens to cultivae thr sene of protctig e ct 's nvironmnt .
We ae lucky to live in a cty where boh e auhrity an he peple have a strog nse of environmtal rotction .
We are sure that th tourists who isit our ciy can ee it and hope tht they il he sead the message he they go home .
Among a variety of sports , ther is he fooall ls kno as soccer .
Footbll can be played either as a hobb or as a job .
Since I was very oun , roughly at the age of thirten , fooball became my favorite sport ad it as an acivity that I could never stop doing .
As the tm passed , I became more skilled at football .
I signe up for a feminine football team in my city .
O eam trained wce a week fr abt to or three hours .
We had u own trainer , hich ws a man who played football before .
There e three main reasons wh I enjoy plaig footbll .
Firly , it is a way to get out of th rutine , ccasionaly .
It elp to release h endorphins ad anxiety levels in my oy .
Secodly , it has hlpe me to improve my heth condition in several ys .
F xample , it conributes to my cardiovascular ystm .
And thirdy , it is an activit where I av be abl to make n frids ho , beside playig footbl as me , r vr similar to me in other features .
If y oe o would like to tat pracicng this dnamic and amazig sport , I wul tell ou to try it as soon as possible .
As ou get involved it football n you nroll with his sport , yo ill learly notc the benefits it bins to yur daily li .

' I thin we 're being fllwed ' said Sara to me , as we pulle over the street .
We 'd had a lovl mea in on of h os charming restaurants in Rome .
Depit the fact hat We 'd a to share a table wih others tourists , we 'd had a great time .
Sr ha eft ur hire - car kes on o of th table n had ad no attention to them for a hil .
Whn we were bou to leave we realizd that thre wre a short letter on t tbl . ' I hav ur ar keys .
Wait fo me , pleae ' it said .
We d n't understand a thing because the car eys were ut in front of us .
So we rushed out te rstauran on susicon of theft .
We 'd ben drvng or al an ou whn I notice tat there were a hie r behind us .
Sra tred to get i of it but the whi c a still there .
We pulled over e man oad .
e other a drier ae up to us slowly .
We wer rally afraid . '
You 've ha th wrong key and he rong a ' said the n .
As soon as the man eplained evything to us we realised hat we ad mistaken car keys in the retarant because both of he were exactly alk .
We exhang adresses and as ti went on we became go frens .
I eded up working to Mr Smith ' company in Madrid whr I 've bee working the for 20 years .
People sem to be livin quet comfortab ives nowadas .
We have rached an age of high technology .
Humans will mot lely continue to improve this technology and make tei lives better for he fuure .
We ight live better lve in e future .
When thinking about h the les of peole will be lke in the nx 50 years , h first thught tht comes to my mnd is a peon sitting lazily on a ofa tha can adjust itslf to his / her will .
The rson f the laziness is tat he wr of te house il be done by robts .
is is how I think fe would be in the xt 50 years .
Root wil continue to be mproved , till tey wl be able to do all wk at home , so no on rc enough to fford a oot would bther to do t wr himself / hersef .
h oot wil be be to do thns like coking , fetching , washing cthes ad dishes and cleaning the house .
The me would only do the paperwork hemselves .
However , nt everything bot the lie in the next 50 yrs will be positive .
Water is already growing scare over time .
Eventually , it might bcme so mh of a precus rource that it will be ed as the international urrecy instead of dllars .
We will have to find an altenativ dinking sorc ...
Shopping is my favourite pastime , and I smply ca not magne anything more relaxing and joful than spendig my hard - earnd money .
t wih a heavy heart I have to agree wit this statement .
Why ?
There might appear a few situations , when shoppin instead of joy c brng a hedahe .
Frst of all , it is quite har to eny hoppig wen you are frced to do it .
The best example hr could be he rgular , eve - week filling - the - fridge shopping , whih in rinciple can ot be pasant .
Personal I am ot able to fd athing exctng in hanging around exremey high supermarkt sheles and pushn heay tolley . Crowd in evry crner , wful d unplesat igts and e necessity to run from on end of te arkt to another , beuse these shos e orgnied in the way , hic forces you to e erything , in order to id what you eally ned .
That a th exremly ong queue for the ash ds also a nt vy encouraging .
What is me I hte do shping hn I really need to uy something .
Because here is this iked , unwritten rl , accoding to which if you are looing fo something , thee is no the slightet chac you will ge it .
ou will not be able to ind the right se , the right colour or simply anything which would suit your taste .
Shopping ih or usband , boyfrend , ther or any representative of the mal kind , also cn totally ru he most ruitul shoping ever .
I beieve they ar genetically progamed to tak away all your ' joie de vivre ' .
Th constant grumbig , regular checig he im , thi nxiou nd adif acal expression - o on earth it could create a favourable onditions for opping ? !
And belev me there is no diference if you e shppng for youself or fo them , it always lok this wa .
In conclusion , shopping ca be d usually is a reat opportunity , not ny to expand content of your wardre , t also , to relx and sen a great time .
u ust ae to avoid sermarkets , y clothes in advce - so thr wi n ppar th siuaion , when ou need something really badly a it is n in or cset , an of course of th male company , btter choose h female copanio .

Education and techoogy ae deeply related , to a certain etnt in that edcation ha sufered a series of cange throughout the past 20 years .
In resent times it is ver common to see people learning courses hrough a comuer .
Online learnn s bcome a mdrn phenomena in order to gain knowede ; however , ae - to - ce learning is sll the better leaning option chosen by students .
Althouh tere are many differences amo these two , siilarities can be fou as well .
The main similarity bewen fac - to - face leaning and onln larning is that thy oth proide valabe learning skills to tudents .
urrently , exist l ypes of couses via te Internet , at any cadeic or voatinal eel .
F instance , degre coures , ater courses or jus an pdatig course can be fnd .
Adding to this , boh learning optons requie time and dediction om suents ; otheris , knolege il n be properly delivre .
On the other hand , diferences between face - to - fc learing n virtal larnin ar umerous .
Firtly , online earing conve flexibility in ts shedule .
Studetd can ttend course when they decide , bu away respecting de dates .
Aoter difference between face - to - face learning and olin learning may be that fce - to - fae larnng allows students to develop human - relaionships , herea nline learning is quite impossible on this to happen .
During fae - to - face learning students have a teace - sudent relationship , as well as a peer - to - peer relationship , allwin tem to develop iter - personaal skills ad coexistence .
Ls u no last , time snt on hese corses ar dffeent o .
When doing a fec - to - face course besides having an ttendane shedule , people spend more time commuting to he lace whe h course is gien .
In current days , traffic jms e a fc in big cities ; thereoe a lot of time is os comuting .
Consequentlu , boh learning optins have heir ositive and negaive asects .
Assessing thes similrities a dfferences eac stdent h h option to chose h opin whch bette suits in hi lifetle .
Pechiea Borromeo , a litle town near ilan , hs an agricultural relit and there re many possibilities to wak around and to trn yourself in a running parcour .

oreign language learning in my contry
Introduction
Te purpose of this reor is to comment on the way peole , and espeialy chldren , lean languaes in my coutr , what freign languages they learn and where tey arn them ad to recommend changes in t language - learng system .
Languages people learn
Tee r many languages people in my country learn , but English would be te most popular as it is a world wide anguage .
Wit Germany and Austria being ur neighbours and hs busines artners to ma ech copanies , erma is the second most opular foreign laguage spoken , folloe by Russian , French , Iaian ad Spanish .
h learns laguages in my country
Mostly , it is children at schools w learn languages .
hey start learning English or German at the ge of eight .
Oter langae of their choice ollows at secoary school .
However , thee might be a proble ith the choice as no every secondary school ofers e.g. Spanish or Itaia , so studns he to choose a language the do not prfr .
Sudents at some schools alo hae a possibility of echage rgrammes but hse can be quite expensive an n every famly can afrd su an event .
Tere a alo mn duts wo wan to learn or just improve thr lanuae skills .
Adults uually tten language courses , or use a arity of on - line urses .
ecommended changes
I wold recomend te government to increase salaries o Spanish , Italian or rench teachers to ersuad th to tach at schools inste of giving private lessons .
It uld lso be wise to donate schools ha pepre echang rograms for their students , so that more of the could ffrd that .
ea Mr Williams ,
I sa your aertisement for languge courses in London d I am writig to fnd out mre abu the courses you offer .
I am thinking of atnding a couse fo w or three wek in Augt .
Could y please sd me moe information and detais of prices ?
I uld paticularly ke to know how many students attend the school , nd how many students tee are in a clss .
I 'd also like to know wha resourcs the school has .
F exampe , is hre a librr wer I can stuy in the evenings ?
oul yu tel me something about the staff ?
Are ey all qualified teachers ?
I wld be interested in having mre dtails of the socia and sport
progrmme .
Are the actiities ncluded in the pre of e course ?
Could yu tell me bout the cost of accommodati too ?
Also , can o tl me what amenties there r near h scool ?
o
exaple , is there _ park or inma nearby ?
I lo forar to reciving your reply .
Regards ,
It oul be great if ll of us he a healthy lie .
Howver , young pople genrally do n't pay enouh attention to their ealth and fitns .
hre ar an young people who follow Hoywood stars or famous ingers and wnt to ve the same bodie as the .
As a consquene , th become slim and they do n't igst enoug pteins n vitamins to hav a eathy li
On t other hand , teenagers are bcomin moe deendent on cellphones , video games and tlvision wich make hem beng or edntary .
Being away on he bed or on h sofa is not recommended , whereas going outside an ru or ride a bicye uld be a better option .
This way hey would be ong physical exercise .
Finally , to be heathy it is also portant to e balanced food .
Snacks , fast foo , fried fod ad sweets re part of young peope 's lie as thy ca find he everywhere : in h sops on t street , at parties ad in shopping malls .
In conclusio , young eope hould behave differently owrds their health n ftnes .
Bng sedentary ad eating fast ood wil t bring them anywere .
Th tatemet is rthe too categorical , beuse to say that her is no uture is ing o far .
It is true though , that public transprt would o be te gneral public 's fist chice .
Sometime the reason fo doing so e not to do with conveniene but , rather moe to do wth economic sues or matters of onscience .
If we think slfisly , then the a is the obvious choice .
It is easy , ast and , we can almst park it right outside ou destnation or at walking distance -sorter ather than longer .
It is initially expensive b it is so hand that we end up thiing it is part of us and even thk we can not live without it .
Raising pepe 's awareness of poution and how we mus have a more sustainable existence is what mks us look r ohr ess sefish n handy options .
Publis ransport is aways going to be slower , less flexible ad mh less conveent but we have th reassurance tht we ar dog what is best fr our pnet .
We are compying to the norm .
In conclsion , public transor will alay hve a futur if local governments ha policies to promote it .
It is ner e attractive option , t it is the o whic shows more solidarity .
Government jobs arry it tem serous resosibilities .
It is therefoe no urprie that a perso 's age and experienc me under scrutiny when positions in govement need to be filed .
Mn feel fluential government jobs shol be reserved or ose who are older a have more experiene , hile oters fee th critrin o these postios should be capability , namely whomever is mos be to carry out the ob .
Ths esay il look at bth ide eore drawng a logical conclusion .
On the on hand , many argu ha younger peope should be made ineligibl for important goernment positions , and the implications of this opinion a cea .
Those operating at senior levels withi a country 's miltary , for example , require fel experine to preent disastrous decisions that could cause he needless los of life .
Were younger people aloed to ast tack their ascension within a country 's militar , they could fin themselves having to make critical choices sed more on theortical suy than ractical exprience , d this cld hve catastrophic results .
Thus , is it understandable wh an eel younger government woers should be icubate bore gien promotion to important positions .
Hweve , thre are svral plauible counte to this agment .
For one , youge workers ing creativity and esh deas to governmnt .
F example , oun government workers in Canada successfully puhe to inrase HIV understanding and disel sigma attached to the isease in the 190 , a development that encouraed tolerance and reuce irrational fa .
In addition to resh des , it should be emembred that to et a vernment job , one has to succesfully engage a rigorous screening process .
If a younger pson engges tis process as well or btte ta an olde person , it is hard to arue hat age should be a decisive factor when offerig employment .
It is cer rom the reasons that ther is merit to warding important government career options to youger people .
Althouh the ave look reveals solid videce for bt sides of t arument , it is felt that the healthiest apprah to desinting gvernment positions is to ensure canidaes flfil rigorous training programs .
us , a pero 's age shold n be csidered a universal precursor to t awrding of government obs .
Promtinal Objectie :
One of the promotional objectives is to increase e awaenes of Trvago in Hong ng .
In order to achieve ts objectives , Trivago investe more money in the promotion in 2014 .
For example , it promoted thir search engine by the television commrcial and Yutue adertisement .
h Youtube advertismet means h viewers have to be enforced to watch h advertisement before they atch me video in Youtube .
Since most of e people atch the elevison t us a few minutes or do not jus watch e or two deo(s ) in Yotube , they will be enforcd to watch its advertisement more than one times .
Triao hs a vey simple and rememberable tagline hch is ' Hotels ?
Trivago ' .
Te audiences re eas to think of Trivago when they are thinking abo hotels .
Also , Trivago ants to incrse its marke sha by entering Hong Ko Maet .
Many Hong Koger love to travel and go to difrent country to ee t culture and njy the diferent lifestyle .
Man of them ty to pl he cheaest a f hir trip nlude booking the wothiest hotel .
If they aware te enfits of using Trivago , they will love to use this as they ould spend lss time to compare all the hotels .
Therefore , Trivgo use t advisment to increase its market sare in Hong on .
Moreov , Trivago is trying to enhance t company image in Hog Kong .
Tivag is not uc comon in Hong Kong .
me people even robabl do t kw wa it is .
If Trivao wnt to ain beefit from th Ho Kong markt , it s to develop an enhance teir bnd imag .
oig prootion is oe of the ways to imprve ts iage .
Tivago is ying to eresent at it is the mos convnien hote sarch engne in te market .
Te last but t he least , Trivago wants to bost its dwnload rate in the mobile application platforms .
Almost l t advertsemnts ar encouraging audience to ownloa s mobil appliction .
If there are more peopl download its mobile application , it mens more pele to kow s brand a us t servic .
urrent advertsing strategy
We found one of the Teleision advertisements whih is curetly undertaking in Hng Kong .
The advertisement is abot 16 seconds .
There is a arator introduces the funtin of Trivag a demonstras " how to e its mobile application to search for a worthit hot . "
At the las of t deo , the screen shows a talin a the website of Trivago .
We will analyze is srateges ro different perspectives belo .

As the tagline is catchy , if th tagline is cntinuosly applid on the other advertisements , it wi n be easy to try from th main dea .
Other communicatio tools
Trivago oes not hoos rdo to be their media as it is atiquated .
Peoe urently seldom listen to the radio .
Attenin of the rdio commercial is w .
Also , radio advertisemns nly contain verba effect .
Wtout e visual effct , it becomes less attracive .
Evn through peopl iste to the rio advertisement of Tiago , ty proably do no know how to spel h wor ' Trivago ' as it is not a normal vocabular .
It makes pope hard to search Trivago on the Internet .
herefore , the product awarness diven by rdio advertisent is n enoug .
Newspaper is lso not a good media since newspape ha ben rcently replaced by onin ewspaer .
Likewise , Trivago is an nlne servic so Newspper advertisement a not appropriate for it .
astl , hir spkespeson cosequent high os in promotion .
nd here is a risk of hirin a spokesperson as he may not bring an execte rern fo the company .
Sometimes , if her is a spokesperson in an advertisement , e focus of adience aybe shifts from he produc to t spokeseson .
e pomoing bjective is diffcult to be achieed .
Threfor , telvsion commercial is liel the ms suitable method to promote s brand in og Kong .

Do you know " The Flying Duchan " ? I considr hm as the Dutch Suerman of 201 , since he has won some imortnt spors copetitions .
Do u also kno Cwn Basie ?
Wl , I cnsider hm as t eanst Dtch clebrity of tis year .
" The Flyig Dtchmn " , also known as pk Zonderland , is a gymnat from Groningen who was he irst mn worldwide to do an incredibly difficl ercise on the parallel brs .
By performing this exercise perfectly , he became t World Champion this ye ( n he also o the gld mel at e Olympics of 2012 ) .
o th achieement , I admir m quite a lot .
Clwn assi , on the oter hnd , is an actr of a TV - programme for children .
Aftr a live sho , he mde a lttle rl crying by shouting at her nd ten iced r in te bak .
W wud you treat toddlers so badly ?
To smmarie , my hr of 2013 is Epke Zoderlan , because of his achievements in the gym .
My villain of thi year is lon Bassie , sice I think his bhaviour is unacceptabe !
Clearly , tael in our own ca is much more comfortable tha on public trasport .
For tis reason , many people ow believe that ther is no future f pblc trasport .
These people believe at er he et few years we will ee a severe decli in h amount of people using bs , tais , tram , etc . to get plces .
In my oinion , is is dissapointing for a number of rasos .
First of al , pblic transport bring us closer to other people .
We share moets with tose popl uig the ame mode of tanspot as us .
Also , it is an excellent wy of savig th environment .
By sing public tranpot we redu our carbon footprint and help to ave the Eat .
Furthermore , we also se time : as cities become bger it becomes more and more difficult to ark , which in turn lads to us wastig te looking for somehee to park , or wasting mon in expensi carparks .
In conclsion , I believe that public transpo hould be a necesar pt of everybody 's lif , we soul se it every da to sve the Erth , mone , an time .
If you 're looig for a great fil to watch on a riny ay , I totaly recmend Alice in Woderlan .
It oud give u all the magc of a fantasy film based on a book .
Directed by im Bron , h story is a retelling of fatas noel lic 's Adventures in Wonderland .T fil sho a young Alice Troubled by a strange recurring dream , h ls of her beloved father , an unwanted marriage proposal , and the oppressive expectation of the society in which e liv .
Unsue of what to es , sh che a rbbt in a blue aitcoat , and accidntaly fall into a lage rait hole Frm which e eergs in a forest , were she is greetd by many strange creaures .
Tere Alice wil sta an adventure where se must say e d evil ueen and restore e White Queen to power .
e il features Mia Wasikowska as Aic .
it er sweet face , pale sk , and grea acting , s looks perfect as a onfused n bave girl w has to sav tat " wonderfl " world .
ut we must not forget abou th marvelous acing of ohnny Deep ( as e mad hatr ) a Helena onha Carter ( as t red ueen ) , wth thm the fl woud n't be the sa .
But it 's ot just the acting that is great in this im .
The cinematgraphy is fantastic , it wonder digit landscapes .
Bt ha really ake it gical is the makeup and the coume design , they really managd to create somethn amazg with h apparance of charactes .
Finally , h fi d t gre touch of Tim Bron as direto .
If you enjoy a classic bok , but wh more action n a litte bi twistd ; watch Alice in Wonderland .
I totaly recommend it , you ll not be isappointe .
Is sciene evil ?
People 's opinions on this question differ widely .
I tink that science ha atere our lives in a ositie wa .
Hr e som act to upprt my view .
Fistly , I should say that life nowadays is unthinkable withot science .
In h century of advancing commucations d technlogy it is hard to iagine the wrl witout medicine , astronomy , computers , and hitor .
People tda ae interested in learning about h surrounding ord , aou new civilzation and stant planets .
Scinc explains to us a l of t tings tat we previously were not aware of .
Wiout s hl , fo example , we wod have eer realized were we have cme om .
It alo give us clues tht there my be life on other planets and we might not be the mot superior beings in the world .
By uing computers nwadas it is very convenient to find te nformtion y e looing r .
There is no scret for he human beins today ecaus they have explored every lac on th Earth .
Tey climb te highes mountains , dive in the depths of oceas , and conuct dangerous experiments a a fo the sake of science .
h rsent bele is tt sienific approach wl solve al e problems d do awy wih all ificulties .
With its elp , f example , people are abe to coe ith natural disasters .
We know how to destroy il clouds which c use rea daage to our crp .
We are also abe to protect ouseves fm various diseases and hel th sick .
That is why sience is so significant nowadays .
On the othr hand , the greatness of sciec goes tgethe ih is disadvantages .
Fr example , we e oblied to agree that sciece has give no nswer to man 's doubts .
he obsession to know everything h d so of us to make dangerous experimens fo hch we a with r lives .
To conude , I wl only sy that science makes our lves easier .
With it hlp we ce wi dferent situations a at is wy it is so fundamental to uman existence an I think is n ev .
At some time or aoher , ec and every young person mu provide thmselvs with the ecessry skills . ¬´ What ca I do o my lie ? ¬ª .
When you start to onsder interess ad strengths , it maes sens to conside your iterest first .
After ll a sccessul caee is best meared in hw saisfying ou find it , and it 's easier to develp strengt and skils han to acually have to lern to ind something iterestin .
While we are studying we may n think seriously abt o .
But in a ew year time our job wl be e of the most important things in ur everyay life .
When someone ass an dult " what do you do ? "
tey nearly always epl wih hir occupation .
Work , for mst of us , will be the defining spect of lfe and tu of ur idetity .
Through o work we fn an identity , we can fi statu , itllectual stimulation as well as wealh which nables us to buy comft .
We a wk out ou plce in the wol .
O working identities cn change vr tie , our idenity and behaviours as a young gradute are diferent from those of t professional expert and rom those of t eior leader .

Factor behind the decline
There are mre than 00 old , badoned , ocal buidings in r capitl ty .
B mos of the re about to be declined by town planners .
This means we will lose a pa of r national histoy .
Whl the fact that thse uilding are no seen as wohy of preservation is an imortat fato , demlitin is ore frequently case by a lack of pblic fnds .
Firsl , demolition is artly caused by ho valuable the old buildings ar estimated .
Old local budings ten do not rovde opportuitie to make any money , thy only cs tow paners a lo of mony because they probably eed to be renovated .
However , even with these arguments , deolition is mr frequently affected by a lc of public funds bcause it cvers the par about te hindsight of an aproprate budget for eventually enovatin as el .
With no appropriate uget it is unreasonable to keep old buildings wich are useless whe they are n renovated .
A bov that , withou pubic fnds there are too few eope o shw te care about the te of histrical buildings .
Ths might cause that tw plannes will think there e o enough easos to keep hem .
Ate a , the facor with he mos inflence on decline of ocal bildings is t lack of public funs hic make it possible to ke o d buildings , or at lst a ew of them , ecase these funds frequenty accumulate money or projct like renovations .
Any form of public transport lk a b or a tin is t much of an inconvenience especially in a lrge ity such as London .
Iagine going to work on a ain day : you av o hand on yur umbrell and th other clutching your a , te wind is bloing ist on your fce ad a pudl of water is sprnklng tin dt of et dirt in your sileto while o are making your w to a bus station .
o a oo scene , is it ?
Definitely t a good way to start yor ay .
Ined , the method by which a peson go from point A to oit B c spell the diferene between a good an a b dy .
Transportion is very iportant in our daily life an in th modern wold we live in , the ery least that we expect from almt anythig is inconvenience .
This is why , ms of us , prefer to travel with our on ar raer ha by a pblc tranprt ; not ny ht it keeps us within our prate sphere , it lso keeps us dy travelling on a rainy y .
Yes , we ae willing to spn more in the name of convenience . We 'd rather pay a efty pre for gas th be inconvenienced in a public tranport .

Fame nd the attitude to fa hae been one of the mst thought - provoking topics .
Students usully find it very inspirin d engaging to discuss this sue beause it is er difficult to give a clea - cut anwe and so , it mke he procss of discussion ery exciting .
Ther may be a significant number of rgumnts hich suppor the statemnt that fame is a good thing .
My personal attitude to fame is athe ambivalent .
On the one had , I personaly think ha e desire to bcome faous is a great driving force tha stiulaes peopl and brings a lt of benefits to others in ts wake .
Spotmen are n of he os vivid examples of it .
If we take footbal clb , for example , we c see that the desire to becom ell - non and popular mks football plaer very dedicated sportsmen .
They can fiht aganst the odds to be in te top league .
It is remarble ow muc stmina nd sirt a be deontrated by such sportsmen .
Their dsire to be at the tp cntriutes a lot to the fame and reputation of their clubs n countrs as well .
Wht is eualy importnt and ads to te importance of ae is th somebody 's desire to be famo a have a triggering efec on others .
It eas that othe eople feel challenged an do n't want to fall beind nd lok uderogs .
Without ti stimulus tey may ae been inactie .
On te other hnd almost eqal number of peole may maintain a contrasting point of vie .

Such people tried to achieve their goal irresective of t means .
I a illustre my wos by he example of military campaigns .
T dsre of some counr 's aders to beme famous and to loify their nams as great commandes brought abo wr n conflicts between countries .
Hundreds and thousands of inocen people a fl victim to th insatiable dsire of sc fame -seeking prsonalities .
So , ll in all , we a ot answer this question as " e " or " no " becaus hee is almost equl nube of amples that hp to suport h contacing points of viw .

By he ime my high schl yar ee on , ad right when I attene uiversit , I deveoped certain peilection for ypical healthy Spanish , unavoidiby combied with less fst food due to the sal diners with friens .
The main ause of ht change was ta I had to hve breakfast , lunc a inne at my college dorm 's inin room ta had amazinly good coks , Tey 'd ook eall god dshes ch as cocido , garbanzos and paella .
Wonderful inventions su as the train , u n airlane hae lowed us t freeo to travel and exploe this great planet or a lwe price .
ndustrializatio gave us te abilt to mas produce public transit vehicles so that everon cou be free to move .
ravellng by car may be more convenient on an individual ais but pollution is a dnger we have to fce .
If l of used cars , the leves of polluion would be incredibly high .
Public istitutions sold encourage e e of puic transport , especially trains as they use electricity and ae es olltant tha thr ens of transport .
Ter is a prblm , though .
Prices of train tickets n be ry high nd they shld be redce .
Trffic is a rely g problem in ciies nowadays ad only the use of public transport cn make a significant difference in h quality of lf in our ctis .
If those who r publ transportatin systems ope to mke them greener in t future , they 'll ha to co with solutions that re oh enery efficient nd ffective .
In onclusion , I hnk that pubc transprt s an important rol to pl if we want to prerve e qulity of ife in r cites .
I elieve tht my backround is suitable r this position .
My first degre gav me a gd trak record in physiology and anatomy , d the experien , as a biologicl scincs ' student and as a research fellow , allowd me to uild a scentific inking .

I live in a small vilag , in he Germn region of esse , caled Griesheim .
Th city authorities have a very sict policy regardng wste disposal .
Al citizens are nvolvd in h process by organizing their waste in the corresponding bin nd by making good use of e waste calendar .
Every house in the vllage has hre containers :
- One f the paper ;
- One r the b waste ; and ,
- One for t wst that cn not be eycled .
In addition , ellow plastic bags re pvided for fe to separate t lstic , ca d icks .
The cs of e waste disposa ervice epeds only on th volume of n - recclable aste produced .
he yellow bags and te gas are processed at no cost , whatever e voum .
here re ao plic conainers r glss a lothes all roud e vilag .
Eventully , th citizen becomes part of a ery meticulou recyling proce by looking up to the cost .
On the other ad , the ity provides a punctual public transport sysm , vey convnient .
This ysem relies on the tram .
rams re availbe 24 hours n tram stops ae enly distributed ; it kes no more than 8 minute alking from o sop to the nxt e .
e bu network complees h public transport srvie .
To ride is another sitabe opto , if e weath allows .
The city is be frenly an ike phs are avaiable .
Large orets and coury roads , where crs are not allowed , are al part of h offer .
Jack nd t gret , furry waffle .

He knew he would n't last a day in the heat , bu there was nohng bettr tan a w waffle .
He aw on his mommy 's eleision tht if he ws h first person to ty the wafe , he wold get a onu of a hundre bco stips .

Have o ever stopped to think that exst some standards in e socey ha everyone knows and follows althogh some peope do it uconsciousl ?
These standards are called unwritten rules which can be dined as unspoken rles impoe in each culture to mke the populatio to li more civily ( ob Greene , o Unwritten Rules Circumscribe O Lve - Paragap 6 ) .
In fa , since th begnning , h witten ules have helped to creae the civilizations hie t unwritten rules hav helpd to maintain hm , allwing life to be more harmonious .
For exmple I ca ct h imptance of the unwrttn rules in my own culture , the Baziian culture .
There re ome apect ad actis that everyone o lives in Brazi needs to flow , and thse directy reflect h vales of the Brazilian cultue .
e of the most imprtant unwritten uls that u should foll in razl is relatd to the vol paterns .
When Olqi said tat h siuaion ad he envronment eine he corrct te of speech ( 1995 ) , he a talking abt h Arican Amerian Communication , bu he is al describng e Brazilian communication at the same time .
Even thugh ther is no defiite consenu bout the exact vocal patterns in Brazil , thr r some facts about te exremes of it .
First , razlians fel uncmfortable when pple cos to hem raise eir tone of voice nd cntinue speaking loudly during a og time , ithut they av ear reasons .
It mes tht y pretend to trsform t dilog in a moolog ; oreove , unnwn people in th same environment of you frequently do no wat to ko bou ou tiking .
Surprisingly , on t other hnd , a speech too o is seen as an antisocial rule , ad can be interpreted as an offense .
In Brazilian ultre , if during a conversion a person speas t o , the liseer will assume that th speaker doe not wan to contiue with th dialg or does not cr about wha o ar tlkng .
In bth the extremes of a speech , lud and w , there is a violaton of e vues of a good communication .
Therefe , when you r in a conversation , it is iportant to py attention to eecute ith successful h unwritten rues of vcal attern .
As voca patterns are consierd so important r Brazlins , personal teritory is aother nritten le that is eas to e people usn on the streets daily .
When y r in a space ht you el comfrtable being around oher peopl hat you do not know , hi spae is yr personal territor .
And , it can chnge cording to your egre of familrity or intimae wh the oter erson .
In som countries like he United Sates , whose respect of persona territory is extremel important , the public an the intmae space can va between 25 feet n h touching ( Ewad T. Hall ) .
In Brazil also there is this difernce between the public n e intiae spac , yet the magniude of this is ot th sae of h U.S.
Although h Brazilians have a sorter persol spae in comparison wit th United States , ty ar no tolent with strangers ivadng it .
So , even hough the distance btween people ar shote in Brzil , bh countries vlue the ia of maintaining a space ha both pepl eel comfortable , call persona space .
Although Brazilians usually do n wory aut distance mae by othrs , people from different cultures bieve ht Brzilans spend mu time ookin at others .
As a reult , some eple cn mke misinterpeations .
For example , in som culture , razilians an be consdeed ue by woen because ey like to eep a constant y ontact , ad or these wmen this meas a lack of respect or ivason of priacy .
Differently , foreign mn oft believe tht tey are ing esird d to ti constant e contact .
In geeal , this supsition is not regarded as tre for many people in ur culture sne razilians believ that constant eye contact is n of the mos important onts to mintain a good diao .
According to artice " nverbal Communiction : Seaing without Wrs " , ey contat is iportant bcuse " insuficint y ontact an crete communiation barriers " .
In fact , in Bail , the ey contact is primordial , being considered witout nteest to speaker or tht the speaker is botering o if you do not gie enough attention hen you are talking to .
T source of is rle is easy to be identified especially hen he paren are talking to thi kids ; it is hard to get exclusively the kid 's attention , u t parents inistenty eeat , " ok at me whn I am taking to yu " .
Therefore , this iterction demonstrates that e ey cntact can hve a strong infuence in t clural vaus of attentieness ad respect with he otes ' opinion .
After being socially judd by the society , we can perceive the diect influene of nwitten rle in our cultural vlues when somen beaks at leas ne of them .
In Brazil , the social ues ike vocal pattrns reflect in he communication values which can be decisive to keep a gd commuicatin .
Also , the pernal territory a governed by rue tha vy depending on t country , and in razi a considered sml , u everyone hre appreciates this cultural value .
Eye contct is aothe important cultural lue whih is us by Brziians mning resec and interest o others .
As in Brazil , ac ounry around the orld hs reflections of th unwritten rules in th ulural values .
Because of these varieties of vues and ues , usually there a some msunerstandings between people of dfferen nations .
Respectig these rules is h irst stp to understand the nd avod some conflicts .
In addition , you shold avoid uge cultural value ro oth couties based on nwriten rules of your wn .
It was a rainy Monday aternoon nd Michae was gaing t te widw thinig about s life , when he sw i frind , Jo , dashing throuh the street .
Wondrin what he mih be doing , Mchal shouted :

- I 'm late for my piano lessn ! I rell ave to go , see o later - John replied panting .
- Oh , oy , bye !
Michael ad a chemestry tt the next y , wever he was n't in t mod to study and so he decded to al Al , his best fried :

Do u want to go out ?

what about th one nt to the shopping cente ?

See ou thee at half past six ?
- Ok , see you later thn .
Michael grabe hi co and crept t of s house in oder ot to wake up his prnts .
He remembered that he still ad n't studied for is chmesry st .
Michael closd the door an knew at that moment he a ade a terible miske .
According to Ferguson et al ( 23 ) , ietary nitrate ( NO3- ) supplementation , a its reduction to nirte ( N2- ) d subsquent conversion to nitric oxde ( NO ) , reduces blood pressure .
Bn , Morton and Braakhuis ( 212 ) als argue that nitat is considered a ptent vasodiator .
The reson for ts is that h nitric oxide relaxes blood vessels and diates hem , which helps the blo flow or asly d lowe bld pessure .
Thus , h induced vasodilation may affect oth systolic and diastolic lood resure fter te exercise .
Nevertheless , a tudy of e e Eglnd Journal of Medicine claims that only the astolic blo pressure is affected by nitrate supplement , onc it ws not fou in their study a signifiant cane on sysolic blood pressure after nrate supplementation in healthy volunteers .
Surprisingly , he current study has found significat changes in both systolic and iastolic blo pressure pst exercise .
Tu , h invetmet on researh abo the inflence of nitrate supplementation soul continue , te aim of whic wud be to improve sports prformnce ad improved quality of ie .
In conclusion , th results of the present study indicate that supplementation of beroot juice has no significant effect on 700 m rowing ergomete performance .
It is unquestionable hat soe research fund significant improvements .
In this present study , however , the rowing time of h participants was no shorte than imes ithout supplementation .
Iportantl , it was not found serious chages in blood lactate levels either .
It w asume that etroot juice would increase e oxidation and would educe he lactt prductin .
Nevertheles , t nitrate supplementaton did ot chage the lactate leel significantly .
Finally , it was cofimed tha nitric oxie elaxes bod vesels , consequently redcing h blood pessur .
By his action , beetroot juice may effectively protect e ardiovasular sytem durin exercising .
Despe he present fidngs , it is necessary more reserh to udestand the effects of nitrae suppemenation .
By this tion , athets my improve hei performace as well as quality of life .
Dear edtor ,
I rd yr article but technology n education in the newspaper yesterday an I am writi tis letter because I strongly disagree th yor personal opinon about teachers an education .
Due to the ac tha I am suding to become a teacher , I have sme mr knowledge about this subje tn any othr peole becaus I am in the school classroom evr day ad I fa t relity of it eery d .
To begin with , I agree with you that tcnology sometimes makes the ducational proce esir and more pleasant in this way ta tudents have no idea that ty broaden their knowledge .
Of cuse , I make use of computer an pojector drig my teaching daily , ecause this is a pleasant ad entertaining actiity for childr .
Afr a , my objection is that intractiv leaning is not te only way for children to be educad .
he traditional educational process y sometimes sm to be boing d dull for cildrn but a teacher shld be a prt of this process as a guide .
Witout teachers ' guidance , elf- sudyng ay ring some probls to children , such as possible misunderstanding .
Newoking eucational cotent r t afe at a .
It is ommon for childre to watch violence scenes .
So , te taher is a necessy part of the educational prces .
Noadays , oun ople gradute fom univesities , wh com up it new n nnvative ideas out educatonal process ad so the radiion will be updated xt yas .
To be re precise , new educational ehods promoe h students ' teamwork .
In other words , students ave the opportunity to discuss with their classmates in ordr to soe a mthematic rolem in coopration or to lk abot a subjt .
Frthermore , we it 's necessary go tudents cn hep the ther classmates to imrove themselves .
In hs kd of educain , teacer is only the gue who lps studets to discove the infomaton on heir wn .
urthermore , it make cildren more ociale .
In contrast , interactive learning my bring ome advantages but it can aso mak children ntiocial , eause they ler on hei own witou th need to be in t school with othr people .
They do n't nee to co - operate nd to wr as a team .
This is bad , ecause it will be necessary to ork as team in tir utue job nd hen ty will fe serious commniative polems .
To um up , I am o against interactive learnin and te use of tchnlogy .
My prsoal opinion is this is no sufficient to cover the education process .
I think tht it is effient he here is a combination of traditional education an interactive learning .

Dar Mr Michal Wllis ,
Thank you so mc for this opportunity , I am very grateful o eveythig .
I think English is in fc very important because first of all although not being the most spoke language in te world , it is e ffcial language in a arge number of countries .
Most of h ontent prduce on t ntrnet ( 50% ) is in English n las b not least altogh larnig English cn be challenging and steals soe of our reious time , we n see tha it is also ve valuable to lern d ca also create many oppotunities .
Aout th accommodation , we tked d dided that we would pefer to be wth English speakig familes because of what a great portunity it is fr everyone to actualy tst their speaking skills .
Ths is a once in a liftime opportunity and I am crain tt we will cersh eey sond of evy minte there .
I was actuall about to email you about the activities ta e to be planned .
Regrdig the stdents preferences , they all love the outdoors , like ars an rvers an thy also love a good museum because of thei thirs f knowledge .
All in all , nythig tht will ke them away fro bng bored n with nothing to do .

I agree with the statement bov to sm extent .
On the ositve ide , travelling by car is more reaxed because yo do not have to ely on others to riv for ou .
ctally ou have more freedom in wic roads to hose n you can have breaks whenever ou feel a ned for ome time of th street .
In addition , driving by youref u ar not limited by e satins y hv to visit .
Goig by trin fr example , yo eed to get to he next train sation n afterwards from th destinaton tan tation to your taret .
Often enough o hae to rel on her services such as bses or axs to reach yu destination .
On h her hand , using public transportation is good fr he environment becaus t amou of gs , electrciy n otr materals is a lot owe r head .
Furtermore y he he chance to take a nap , do some work or watc TV while u are beng transported .
Mreover you a be lucky to avoid bi traffic jams especially if you re aking the tin .
Avoiding traffic jams , constrctin ite , ccidents nd ter obstacles yo may being affected by may reslt in a lower amount of tm pen trvelling .
As a conclusion you can s pubic transport will hav its use even in the utre . While gng by r may be more comfortable frm time to time , he reasons I stated boe le me to t conclusion that public transprt is necessary .
It is popularly belevd hat he golden er of public ransportatio wil be ende so due to th hav se of automoble such as ars , cabs d vn .
Public ransportation mes like trains and buses have been immesel helpful to th neral pubc throughot the past cple of decdes .
On th ther had , taveling by cr is getting for oplar tan it ever was th development of science and technology .
People wo are based on rura nd emote rea re always prefer to use public tranporation according to he researchers from Columbia Universiy .
Howver , in some countries , public ransportation is a nightmar because it has ot been maiained by the goernments pperly , tis is one of the ma reasons which ad led people to se prsonl vehices rather thn rlying on pubic transportaton .
No ony people in ountries where it ha poor public transportation b ao the most deveoed countries , there is a hgh tendency of using car stead of depending on publ transportation .
Despite the fac at usig cars eing expenive , may people sill prefer to se their ow vehies ecaue it ses thei valuabl tme .
Public transpotaion , on h other hand , consumes a t of time to travel fo one distce to another .
e of hig power efficiency and linear high ower amplifier ( HPAs ) e growing .
Power eficiency and inarity ae importnt factors in many aplicaions such as celulr communication , wireless communication .
Higer powr efficiency and lnearity cause decrease oer consumption , incease lifetime and reduction of interference channels .
Clas - E power mplifier satisfies those goals wih lineait echniques .
Class - E power amplifier PAs work as a witch d can obtain theoretically 10% power efficency . Class - E power aplifier ( PA ) was introduced by Sokal in 975 .
hse PAs ork as a sich ad can btain 100% Dain Efficiency heoretically .

Bt what exactly makes p sorie so fascinating ?
There coul be a lot of reasons , li the iea of lvng in an adventurous y or doing thns in secret ; t in real life , what ind of person does a secret agent ha to be ?
Fst of all , bng a spy requie special slls ; not everybody is suitle for hs kid of life .
For insace , the aility to ber ot phyial and psychological sres is o sometng u can asily learn .
In t same ay a scret gnt h to be ble to take risks en euired .
Therefore bravr is very important : nobody needs a fearful spy .
A ecet aget work undercover , so is most imrtant qality is possessing gret kil in yng .
