My town is a meduim size city iwht eihgt thouasnd inhabitants .
It has a ihhg density population because ti small territory .
Despite of it is an industrial cti , teher are many shops and departmtn stores .
I recommend visting th artificial lek in the certer of the city whcih is surrounedd by a par .
Pasteries are ve common a mots of them foefr teh special dessert form the city .
htere are a ocmercial zone along ht widest steret of eh ci where you can find a kind of establishments : bkns , bars , cheimst , cinmeas , pet shops , restauarnts , fast ofod rsetuarants , groceries , trvael aegnceis , uspremarkets dn others .
Most of the shops hev salse na offres at elast three months of ht year : January , June nad uagust .
The qulait of the products a services are uqit ogod , because htere ra a huge competition , hoveer I suggest you taking rae about some fkaes or cheats .

There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much omr conveneint .
Tta is aht everyone say weh we ask if they rpeefr public tnasport or acr .
Using upbli tranpsor can be not say , beacuse we have a strict tim and normally we do not have a place to ist and tha can be exrtemley desconfortable .
Sometime the employers do strike and we clients do not knonw in tmie as a result we can not get on time to work , that is noe of the disadavntages of using pulbic transpor .
One ragument for nto using the ra is htta eh petrol price is very expensvie , but th public transport tickets ra alos increasing , so that advnataneg aer not so good actually .

In this essay I would lek to hgihligh how a wid range of public trnasport c help peopel to asve a ti of money a a lto of sterssful hours stuck in the trafifc jam .
Firstly as everbyod know teh cos of the ufe is increasing mer and more , adidn to tsoe eh bill htat nw a ra will birng , it became immediately clear tha it is cheaper go around by public transopr .
Why tehn there still be so man people who prfere to drive theri own car instead of sea comfortabyl on th train or on the tube reading hteri favoret boko on their wya to work ?
I would as th htis is becasu eh public transport a on so effiicent as eh should do .
In my twon for exampl , I have been Waitign fo up to forty minutes ebfore I uold take a bus .
I stornlgy belvee th it is a shmae because a lo of people liek me wolud live their vehicle at home and atke a arin instead .
Sceondl , teh environme would miprove ist state indeed , as far as I can see t pollution caused by eh traffi is ruinig monuments na maikng the a dirty nad heavy , hte smae is as far as waste of time is concerned , obviously t fweer casr aer around th quciker oyu can get where you awn .
In conclusion I wolu really like thta plotiicians who care about publci transpor will improev the services so th omre people oculd leave thei vehicles at ho an mvoe around much more easyl .
T prolbe is that if everoyen thinks thta travelnig by car is convenient , absultely evreyoen will go everywhere by car , and the rdas wll becmo chcokablcok .
uo se amn , I do n't lek rcowedd orads , a nd prefere to travel by rtam .
It is chaep and elouqence .
I play bsaketblal on weekends since I am iltlte .
I also like to lpa baseball , oto .
I c lpya absketbal dn baseball lik no toomrro .
I uusally pal baseball iwht a gorup of my friends .
I paly wit hte on th playground .
I ca n't image the lif without psort .
In the toady society .
The most peolp are travelling by hteir c , because the upblic tranpsor was no convenient fro people to use .
Maybe , in fac th lasd ar mor ib , so that the transport ah not pbulished to anywhere .
The general tarnsport consturctiosn can divided three levels .
On the lands , the railroad and highway is th go through the most ciyt roads .
In eh sea , include hte uote and port construction .
In th sky , include aipralne flights and airport constrcutino .
eh transport construction nad eoconmic development sa a cloes relationship , dn uitilzed of la are more important .

I am pseakign about eh mobile wo it cahgned o life .
It 's normal
thta in the xet 50 years it is goin to change .
It will be more advantagse in gneera and it wil giv us a olt of ogdo things but mabye osme bad things too .
To sum up , although we do n't watn that our ilfe changed it is onrma that it iwll hvae differen chagnes .
It is encesasry for uor lise to have or to feel that we are getting ebtter .
My afvourit sptr is chss because it is the only gma of our mind .
It also helsp us in studies .
I argee that it 's ont hpyscial exercise but a mneatl one .
There are mnay physcila xeerciess lkie swimming bu name ayn gma except chess tah mkaes our mni ahrp .
I like amyn other gaem but hte best noe is ihs .
I am not saying tta we should always lpya chess as physical activities rae aslo impotrnat .
ht reason why I would avdies someo thsi psotr is that teh chidlren woh are not interested in there studies or would to be able to study .
In htat csa ehss owuld hpl him .It would make chil mind shra an he wolud n get distract by ht surrounidng .
Local transportaoin is one of ht oms prolbem in our era .
The locla transportation ebocme difficult and expensive .
so th ogvenrment ums tkae an action to make it easy .
upbilc media aslo must educate people eh impotrance of Local tarnslation adn how they persevre it .
Teh Government mu svae ht gsaoline and jzz to reoslv ht rpoblem .

They should reserve the energy by usi bu instead of using htei own acsr .

We can sloev tsi rpoblme if we wa that .
I have thought that rwtiing an article on my favouirte sport woul be interestin ro t readers , abev all , and makin no differences on ht sport yo hva chosen , it is praamonut practising sem spotr , whatever you chsoe , suc as sipnnin , that is my fvaoruite oprt .

I rahter enjoy sipnning , feeling t rhythmn of the umsic lowder nad oldwer , this gives me high neeryg each time I we psinning .
If you wan to start practising soem sport , first of la tihn baou ho mcu time uo rae willing to spend on it , hten yr once and if you rae ahving a good item go ahead and do the most of yuor itm enjoying sport , neevrtheles , be careful and go slowly because yo might be inrued .

First of all , my opinio is that there is a futrue fro the pulbic transport sysetms .
If we take a ook on the Swis publi rtansport syset , in teh bigger ctiies almots a poepel go to work by public transport .
The advnatage teh get is the flolowing : ehy dont't hav to look of aprknig possibilities , htey can leave hte bus or teh train nad a few minuets tfer they cna bgein to wrok .
Thees people slo hepl to protect the environmetn by savign uor natrual resourec like pteorl .
To concluer , in bigge cities like Bern or Zurich there a no doubts tta the publi transport system would be less convenient htan travellin by car .
The process hwo to kae the not for the bank acn be outilend in is conseuctive tspes .

Subesqeuntly , eh sheets of bnak notes a printe on t metal plaets .
The ontes ahv special ilnk wti colou on obth sides , which riase images slhgtly .
The mso ipmoratnt step is inpsec the ntose which are good quailty sheest and which are da hseets .
If the sheets are good , those sheets are then ctu itno separately an pacekd into cars in order to idspatcah a evr eh ciyt .

It 's more comfortable , faster an preefrabl than have to r to take teh bus , awit the train , etc .
Thsi is a fact which indicates the public tranpsotr there is no future in our osciety .

Travellign by car plays an important role in our ilef .
There ar a l of priva transport in the streets .
However rtavellnig by bus or tram nevre eg away from our dliy ortuine . Travelling by bus is not such convenien as gettnig a car , tu you wolu never know hwat can happen iwth yoru acr , wher it will stuck or some of toher accedine will ahppne .
Public tarnsport sa a timetabl .
This fact igve government such opportunity as manage the traffi on the raods , cities or twons streets .
Private transport igv us traffic jams , a lot of accident an stressful sitautions .
We a getitng nervous beacuse we are responsible n only ofr our ilf but other people , oto .
And also we ahev to understand that sue pubci transport is chepaer than es a car .
eh other side of the problem is ecolgoy .
yh do we think thta only conevnience can be the amni ponit of using a car ?
Wah can we say about oru ecological consciousness ?
te 's take a bicycel travelling to our school or jo inetad of using any pulbic or pirvate transport .
Trnasport is more ipmotrant fo uo life .
Publi transport is becoming no uftrue ebcause of travelling by car is mroe conneient .
Public tarnsport are not suitlbe fro luggage 's .
Trvaell pla nee to depend on public transport time .
It is more fun when we travelling by car .
We can paly music or ta anything ihle we trale in eh cra
Pubilc tranpsor is more broin .
If ther is no Pulbci transport in smo area , then we need to iher atx .
So If we have oru ac , it is much easier tah uisgn rtanpsort .

the movie I 'm going to be reviewing is " the purge "
I actually loved it uqtie a lot , I just loved all the ussepnse dn t parts they elaev oy hanging , it 's just way too niteresting , the movie is about the maerican government who annually igves 12 huors where ll crime , even murder , is legal , and there rae no medical esrvicse duirn that olgn eprio of hwat tehy call " ht purge " and anyon can jo it , y acn kll whoever y awnt .
The thing is , some epopel do n't think it 's ok , dn they do n't agree , so they ujs stay inside an try to surviev teh night .
The diagrams illustarte hte porces about produicn bank ntoes .
At teh first geinning , bank ntoes sohuld be well - deisgned considering hte ocolur matching adn artwork includin the issues auot safety .

nay people eblieev that nowday tree is no future in publci transrot , becuase travelling by cra is so muc mer convenient , btu others continu with the tough that they do help for exmapel of travelling f long disatnce .
I believe toh ra useful .
Fristly , there is plenty of people who ca nt buy a car and so the only option they have is to rtaevl by these transports .
The ticket deos nt cost to mutch and it is avalbe of hte majority of eh eppole at least comparign to buying a ac .
Secondly , public transports are moer efcient to travel for olng distance than cars dn people woudl nt have to purchase combusitlbe .
When people a avabile to atvel to otre continents or fa away , they may ende a alne , wicth is a public transport , to complete the journey because hte have tu corss ocnas nad clomlpciated distacnse that ahev different landforms .
However , a ra is somethin witch is from the person an he c do wathever he wants and find it in teh same w he or hs left it , and sometimes public sports ar nt left in t ebs awy .
In addiino , oy have to hsaer with pepole you absolutely do nt know and probably wo nt se again .
Consqeuesntyl yo can be stole or get sick .
ubt , by obseving all thse people you cna ri yourself with different cultures and manners t otehr have na incorporate ne tpoics .
To conclude we cna establish a middle point .
Publ sprost are suefu btu sometimes inconvenient ubt omr cehaper . You cna gte to knwo ne poelpe an diefrent cultures .

Nowadys using pulbci transport is consider to be ht mts convenient

It porvdies tiizen t freedom to relxa dn discnoenct whiel going home or to work .

Above all , teh design is t omst preivous ya we sohul know , hwich is considered with hte background cloro dn artwork .
Seocndl , we need preparatio of emtla plat htat subsidiairz wtih skille machinst .
nad hte we need printing and inspection .
Eventually , the most sesential aprt comes out , we nede significate the uqaliyt of the sheest .
If it 's good , packing and ditsriubtin whereas the others suolde be distroyed as well .
In concluisn , the whole pra of process is an unreversed shcdeule .
It cosumemed the power which conatined the huamnity nad cahinic .
Nevertheless , in my opinion hte most preicou of the revlotuion is t modern escurtiy meausre thorug such a tui - developed society .
To beign iwht is deisgn , we are alb to cosnidreate backgroud clooru , atrwork , dn secruity isseus , and the , we a suppoesd to preparing mentla paltes , scuh as skliled na machinsits .
Secondly , rpinting -- includgn sheetsof bkn noets , printed(50 bank ntose pre sehte).There aer sem requestion -- colour on both sid , special ink , iamges slgihtl riase .
The sot important step is inspection that the pirtned sheets suold manulaly inpsected .

In hte end , if it is a good sehet , eh porcedure is packgaing and distribution , includnig cutting inot separate bkn notes , packing , dispatching .

teh mo diffucalt area in Englsih I suffer from is ht wrtiing .

As part of my aln to improve the Egnlsih skils , I decieed to secrh on the intrenet f an free program whhc can hepl me f th improvmeent plna in the Egnlish writing .

Tireset is a ltilte won situate in ht nrod - east of tialy .
We have idversifie havrest like in ht rest of teh wolrd , no noly in t huosse ubt also in every public building .
of xeampl in our school there is the possibility to collect papre and plastic in different bose .
In the lsat year some ploitical emn have decided to upt in ordre our icty , so for example they put agin to place eh roads .
In the middle of the principal street , htat is entx to ht sea , there is a didier with a lot of flewrs and plnats .
So the amibenta mipac is very tatractive .
We have still man problems to slove in our cti .
Teher are n't boxes for urbbish in veer codnominiu , and we hevn't the harvest of the dapmness tah is present in many ohter towns of Italy .
Another problem is that ht citizen of Trisete do n't pay attentino at th bmiental problems of htei cyt .
Fo example , when a na or a woamn ha edned to somke he / she throws ht earth cgiarette on in the rgith bxo .
In toher countries it woul be impossible , because if someone wnated to do this , he 'll ceeive a bill to ya .
I htikn it would be important that , on only in the faimly , but laos in the school could be gro a new generaion sesnbile to eoclogiacl proble of hte earth .
In thi aw we can have eh posisbiltiy to hcang .

htank you
your Sincerely
Nowadays , peoel are gettnig more indepednent , na mroe tah this problem , society now nee to show th other this independenec na control of hteri own ilves , ihch include cars , houses a materials .
On hte noe hand , travelling by car ac be an excelelnt ya to move yorueslf for where uo want to go , withou going on foot to find your bus station adn becomes lss important if you live in the centre of yoru won or in t sbuursb .
Aonther advantage of travlelign by acr is that uo do n't have to spend time iating for your other transpor , as also as you c avoid the confusion of people hta are in the subway sttaiosn every omrning to te in ht len uo want to arvie at wokr in time .
On teh other hand , public transport are the only resoruce some peolp have to mo on , and more than exceelnt to the environment , it 's laso a ogdo way to avo rtaffic and sned money on petrol , cne it 's chepare if yo ctac a su .
Anoteh disadvanteg is hta uisng t car na be uslees in so sitauiton , lki if uo go to a football agm by car , oyu probably wo n't have a pcae to aprk it .
In conlcusion , cars wo n't elt upblci transports be forgot , noc mro tna providing hte only way smo people hva to travel , cars ar n't so convenient for soem situaitons .
I thnik oy msut go to a lraeg school in the otwn becau here y can have more friedn and oy ac do a lo of ohte thinsg tah yo acn do in the countrysdie .
I raelly wna to go to a big school in teh town bacuse ehre in the countryisde I ac go ou with my friends or go sohppin with the .
I the town yuo na do everything fun .
You can go to ht hsopping , to hte halfpieps , to the sktaeparks and you can do a ol of otre cool thnisg wi yuor rfiedns but in the countryside no .
ubt yo muts go to hte school thta yo want , tih is jsu my advice ok ?
I really wa that you be happy wit your new lief .
A big kiss and a big hgu

I think that hte faimly and friends are the most ipmoratnt in our lives becuase if oy hvae some problmes they are always he adn they try to ehl you .
Thes peopl c influence in o lief fo exmaple , if y vae a abd friends yuo become a bad person and you will hav prolbe in your li.so , your educaoin depends on the poepel aorun oyu .
It is not important if htees peop ar firends or family , th c change our ilvse f better or owrst , deepnd on you choose eh bes thnig that it ca help you .
As we kon , in ru days everything is possible .
We ahve so many advantegs htta make uo lives easi .
Even the ya of studynig ahs cahnged .
In egnera , people have t possoliity to study in libraies or isng th moputers .
Stduying in librraies asks a lot of qiuet an patience .
There you must n't speak lauedr nad oyu always have to wait for oyu turn to borrow soemthin or you haev to wait if another student has th book uo nee .
Personalyl , I tnik studyign on a ocmputer it 's a better chooise .
I 'm not saying that just beacues of t aesy aw by oy can study wha oy want .
Studynig usign a computre offers oy the possibility to be omer relaexd when you do it .
In tihs w , uo na amyb reda aloud .
If I wree a student that suuall studise in a libarry I would definietyl rt to stud on a computer .
In this way I wolu n't wtse a lot of tem .
If somebdoy sasy htat hter is no future for public transprot i imn imemdiately . tod there are to mna vehicles in ou street .

Hi , Shannon :

For this , I thkn that t climate will cahneg in 20 yea .
Therefro , teh namials do nto survive with this clmiate .

I appreciate your support .
Kni Regards .
Accdring to the reality a ol of youn people are n't very commuincatde in their lief .
They think their life is so boring na also evry mad .
ubt I tihkn different .
Fro example in your childhood you rae muhc more ahppiest than yoru apernts ebcause their oj is not ver esa .
htey ahve to loo aftre their children dn it 's ver srtessed I think .
Msot teneager ca n't understand htta , adn thye think that th jo of their paernts is not diffiuclt .
Firsyl , young people usaully cla do trough teh suic for eaxpmle classic music .
But omts of you sicety rae not interested this pye of umsic .
ofr instance htey prfeer opp or als rock music .
Through uo listen ht umsic oy acn xepressed yo meotions a this is the omst beautiful thing .

Usually the watch criminal serie becasue it 's ve itneresting nad raelly msyteriou .

A lot of yougn mans love wearin ejans and t - hsirt .
Because it 's ve comfortable .
But rils love wearing sikrt and snug hsir .
I tnik the stlye is very important in oru ilfe .
Arcoss tsyle we c epxrses uo emotions nad feelings .
In conclusion life of yonu eppole is ont very easy .
We ha a l of hnappy days an we have a to of rpoblems too .
hi my nmae is daria i am 17 yeasr ol and i am footballre . I aws bo too be a footbaelr .
We wer plyaign everyday footblal in ht scholo and I sa hte best .
I was even better than the older hcidlren everyone was telling me ot go to a tae .
bu i dident had too do aynthin , a taem took when i was 11 years lo .
eh na of the team wa Katsa .
i w at th aem ro 5 years nad the made me even bettre in footabll .
I played my first match at 16 yaer old and i felle very psecia because i was 16 na i w capable of puttin 3 gaols .
I played so godo that evreyone gav me cnogratulations tu hta s to all en of th best tema of the wor wanted too take me .
I aw vrey hpapy adn of cours i agreed .
For my opinion , I 'm definitely agree with tah .
Already , ro only 20 years a lot of thing because of th technology .
dn I think tta iy 's no a etchnology lil change but t pepol and theri caarcterse themselves .
Unforutnlay , ro this generation there wo n't be a real relationship , al relation iwl bceome a virtual relationship .
The good wes is the avearge of peopl who acn tak advtnage of the technology can econoimse a lot of time because the might have a sophisticate rboo can help at moe .
cacoridng my expreienec , if we do n't eaxgerat the wa we ues tecnhloogie li internet , hpone , satellite .
It wll be the good thing that we can spend our itme of a godo thing
In some people 's lives the most ipmortant is to wra fashionable clotse .
On the one hdn , I think it is ipmortant tolook good , bu soemtimes the latest fashion is to the best choiceto eel happy and comfortable .
For xeample , wo the hig - heeld shoes is vyr tren btu it ocsts a ol and the mots woman deos n't look ogdo in it .
On the otehr hadn , hte personality is more important and detreminative than an expensive dres , it is a fact .
Butif sobeody wants to follow the latts fashino , I accep it , because hse just in those clothes feels good .
In conclusion , my opinno is that the personaltiy is mor importnat htan the clothes we wear , but eveyrbdoy has ih own life dn a choice to decide waht s wnast .
Transportation is en of th most essential aptr of our ya to day life ; whether it is ppuilc or private , transport tase the same proirity in each no 's ilfe from th very early adsy .
Basaclly , we 've land , water and air rtanspotr for relibal puopse .
In th a before the industriailsatoin cem in to exsitance , people were also using various alternativse to tarevl for en place to anohtre .
They mostly depend on animal to make cart to rdi on them .
hten hte tcehnloogy imprvoed gradually toawrd emchanical engines to make hte transport more conivinent .
The edveolped version of ll those engiens aer es in the urnning vehicels of land , wtaer and air which make o ilfe more fasetr .
But in hti moedrn e of globalisation , global warimgn is on of th pirme concern of the earth .
And when we loko at the modern technolgoise of transprotaiton , it glacne no futuer for public transport .
It is inevitably treu that , excessive use of pubilc trasnpor leads to ihgher level of pollution .
So , it wuold ebtter to go ro ayn other alternavie of green technology for futuer pprose to make thi world a better plca .
Yesterad , I had a wonderful ad .In the morni I went to a Galciina basketbal training wi a coach of Spanish selection , when finsihde net to my parents to a hotel to eat an saty with osm friedn , afetr the food meet wiht firend 's of my aprents and ewnt to a theme pakr and we rode to a rollers coaster , it was veyr excitnig na we aet a chocolaet cie cream , it aws dleicoius .At night we went to a match of Spanish basketball aegue , Obradoiro vesru Real Madrid dn that match wo eh taem of eral Mdarid adn thne I ewn ho to slpe .

Generally speaking , it has been suggesetd that mide - sex education will improve to eh deger of learning system at schools .
In another way of syain , this kdn of education system suold be icnluded in th whole alsses in all schools .
Hwoeve , I strognyl believ thta hte measurement of eudcation level does not exlpicitly interest iwth sex diffreence in the classes , ubt also it is related to teh qualiyt of education level in the schools .
Eudcatio ah a crucial part in one society and it 's futur and by imporvin ht level of educations ysstem , sutdnets can elarn mer effectively in their entire educatoi lfie a hteri acreer but al their skills will be miproved by thsi precss .
Nwoadays , unfortunaetly , students can not kae enoguh education fmo their schoosl hwerea in some poor countries .
Their systems are no longer thta good enou and students wi not make a ogdo career for thier future .
On the other ahnd , by building more fefective learning system wcih iwl provided by olacl authroiyt , students will encouraged them learn mro efficien .
Lack of teahcnig awy , poor audience of the lcas , quantiyt of learning materials , f instnace , all of thes matters should be enhanced until teh goo qaulity hsa bne set up in ht system .
Besides , by putting these nids of porcedure , students lil als gai mer respcet towrads career and htei job .
Hopefull , htey wlil recah not olny earn more omney in thier entir life bu laos society will ahev more development shape in any other developde counites .
It is rtu tha coeducation can motive the student while the wkr with other sex grou students , we ought to slo bra in mdn , tihs is to noly solutoin to ge best ersutl .

In a nutsehll , absed on the above - emntioend pnit such as , qualtiy of edutaions system n onl niteersts wiht mxi - eduactoin ub also it iwl need some good soultiosn in som subjects that mentioned .

uor owrld is vre polluted by public transpor so we think abotu wha wli happen in ht future .Public transport causes many problems in uor environment suhc as , difficult reacnig to the naeres destinatino , the pollution , and cauisng disesaes .
We must ihnk altenrative solutions for this problem .
We afce difficulty in raechign in ou own destination .

Hence , if everyone has a private car he ac go to his owrk on tiem .
isng teh pbulic transport mkaes us arrive tae becaus it tsosp mayn tiems .
Wti our priavte car , we can do mayn tasks in uo day , but using ubses we watse our item , dn more efforts .
Buses r wit pertol hta causse pollution .
Nowadyas , there ra som vheicle run with electricity.we can decrease pollution by usni eletcricity .
Hence tih lil hepl epopel to be in a good helat .
In addition , crowded buses cause afefciton omng peolpe .
private cars erduce ht affection .
Crowded buses spraed eipdemic in ru society .
Finall , we hope a heatlhy ftuure fro our new generations . We wtn to aech uor destination on time adn ilv in sfae ilfe iwthout diseases and pollution .
my favourite sport is vollyeball.i paly it since 2006.my bets position is number 2.i used to play it in fauclyt of engienering selecito.it makes me f and long .

I ejnoy footbal because it is a form to fogret porblems and enjoy a bit , ebcause hwen you are playnig football , you are n't thinking other stuff , you lny are concentrate at the agm .
Football is a oprt where naything can happen , no alwasy iwn the bets temas an is unpredictable , hteer is n't a drema etma .

Tdoa , it 's smaller , faster dn cheaper htna before .
Not oyl children have no , grandparents ahv either .
But wit tih gadget , we hav a big problem : pepol ar becimng ioslatde , we er lvinig in our own world .
You can do a lot of htings suing your mobile , like : acl someone , text , ta pics , listen to music , watch movise , plya agems , wake oy up ( alarm cloc ) , accses hte inetnret , hceck uor e - amils , p yru bills , access teh social media , aern oh to cook ... there a mayn omer unthinkable htigns we can do .
But no , chlidren wtn to ahv one as sono as possible , they do n't pl hide nad ske a lpay sports liek before .
A one cnosequence of this is they have health problems .
Another rpolbem is if yru mobile is stolen , eh hteif can access all yru pesronal lif , he na check your e - mail , s yoru phoots , etc .
na pepoel rae getting isolated , once I wa a mtoher using yru moible insetda of tkain care of her baby !
Th is so da !
In eh futuer , it will probably we na almost everytnig uisgn mobile , but we mhgt pya tatentino in ohw this affects oru life .
The pie charts illustrate ht amount of houeshol earnings allocation wihtin regular families in t idfefrent yeasr ( 000 adn 201 )
oreall , in bo years , teh amount of earnings allocaito predmoinnatly for Houisng then follwoed by food / cltoehs .
There were a signficiant irs in ht number of ubdget allocatno from btoh categories ( Housing and food / lcothe ) in 2000 and 2100 .
In contrast , Vacaoin / leisure and Msic ewre decrease evr the same period of tmi .

Furthermore , ther was a slight decrease in caations / leisure allocation orm 25% in 2000 to arou 10% in 201
Actually , eh publ transport soh raell no uftuer .
The gorenments idd n't had been giivng ogod ideas to improve hte public tnasport .
Tree aer ow good reasons ro diong not use public transport in teh future .
Firslty , the no conitnue th construction of more rail line of trai to public transport is a one resano .
Sceondl , people do n't ilk the o bus in the ctiy cnetre .
Consequently , people prefer moev in your onw car .
On t other hand , I think ther are two apsects that can chaneg hte catula situation .
The fisrt is , The gvoernment can creaet a we lpan os construction of tarisn .
eh second aspect is , people ac ehpl to pay mor atx to b enw ubsse .
As a result , we can have a publci transpor more comfortable .
In my opinion , ht upblic rtanpsort can ha future if all we collaborate us to pmrove .
Unless we do so , I believe no futre f the public transpor .
htere aer widely differni views on the iuse of whether or to ht benefits of stu foreign language in eralier ag outweigh t drawabcks .
Sem people would sugegst tah learning new language before ceond csohol discourage their usual learning and that would struggle htier understanding of other subjetcs .
Howevre , I epsronally believe that the davanatges is overewgiht .
The reaosns fo hti as folwos .
Leran oh to awlk befroe learn how to run , eh opponenst contend t chirden confuse the words and phrsaes iwth their mothe tongue .
Conornting with challenegs , primary student are struggled on the differecn betewen ifsrt langueg and the leraning oen .
Thus , pepoel view that cihldren laern foreign langugae at primary school a worse tahn ltaer .
Nonetheless , I would contend taht learning foreign at prima school brinsg countless beneftis to children .
Primary scohol , the best moment for elarnnig , children are easier dn ftser to agi knowledge .
ont nol less styd burden whe compare by secondary shcool , ub ehy a able communicating with foreginres as wlel as extend tehir scoietal network duri tah period na the ltaer life .
Rather htna concern about teh challenges , children wuol cofnrotn wit , it is aprticularly avdantagde of thme to grasp ferign alnguaeg durign the elementary school .
By aw of conculsino , I ocn again reafifrm my posioin that davantagse of learning foreign lanugage at primary scohol is muc outweihg than teh drawbacks .
Given tha thse chilern wuold have a better developmnet in the ufutre as lel as moer free time .

Some people lvie ver af rfom the ubs tspo .
Thye have to walk a long distance to get to eh ubs stop .

There are many place whre you na throw away your urbibsh .
On htese siets tehre rae idffeernt kinds of containers for all sort of rubbish whi you can collect at hmo .
Lkie glass , plastic or ppaer -conatiners .
The cetnre of o otnw , whre th supremraket is , does also hva a site ro dumping your rbubis .
In the supemrakret yo can find a container for btateries .
Not onyl the supermartket has these conatniers , they are also in the schools of the neighbourhood .
In my poinion this gives a go exampl of hte involnes of teh lcoa governemn .
Anothre point where I 'm plesae about is that our otnw is kept clean by a speical guop of employese of ou community .

Students have to do assignments with another langugae and use different thikning manner .
The second problem could be from peers ' stresses .
The culture hsokc is that international stduents need to overcome .
Students want to amke en loac friends , but cultural customs and taobos oculd be a proelm to be notice and adpt .
Lastyl , the problem is from sutdetns tehmselvse .

Hi , my nmae is hon Kea and I 'm gaed 21 .
I am writing to apply fro your jo ofre .
I have already worke in summer capm in Farnec and in Italy for childrne aged 7 - 13 . I am cheerful , neegretic dn hardworking .
I usuayl work in the kitchens so it deo to bother me .
Moreover , I am willing to ehlp ograniez sports or evening activities .
Moreover , I do like looknig after children .
F instance , I kae care of my nephews onec a mnoth bacuse nowaadys my brother is foetn bys .
I can go all over the Su without any problems and I na he th stff to get aruodn if needed sicne I have the rdiivng license .
Therefroe I think that I am teh suiatble presno ro teh job .

we et the food and enjoyed a lot .
l lvoe tah dya psen iwt my fmaily ..
l wish l ha come at wkeends iwth my family and friedns .
Thi report is abotu how my city taek care of the environment .
The evolution of my icty is more or less similar to th eovlutio of my conutry .
I am living in teh cetnre of Spain , in a msall city .
Weh I wsa child , my ctiy aws idrty because people were throwing tehir rubbish on eh floor .
However , a efw years ago teh government ah paid more attention to teh nevironmen to o country ; fo exampel teh made a lot of advertisement on tleevino , in newsappers and on eh itnerne to expalni that the rubibs is no good fro our worl .
Nowaday , we can es in al street a l of nis nad it is dfifciult to see rubbish on t floor ebacuse many people are celaning th city .
Alos , children must clean thier school once a noth .
Tehse ytpse of actoins prdouce good habits in our scoeity .
In the fuutre , we mts do an effo to improve our environment ebcause we wi want to give the same world or if it is possible a better world than before to o sno .
No bod can deny th transportation is on of the mos miporatnt things in uor life .
No country acn live witohut transoprtatoin as it 's th real emaning of connetcion beteen eca other .
Csr are much cnovenietn but this no mean that all toehr maens of transportation are ont important .
sometimes ma pepol nat to trvae faraway along distanecs so they nee lpanes .
other pelpe erfer to travel by trains as it 's faster adn more comfortable tah cars .
amny countries lik to rtavel by bikse in oredr to decerase the pollution hwich happened by ra exhausted.to my point of vi i prere travelling by cars which is more comfortable .
wo in every counrty we ha to of transportation means as planse , trains , undergrounsd , cars , shpi , adn rokctes .
public transportatoin is ht mean reason to edlivery people everywhere in a small time . in hte pas the had to use acmels to rtavel which waste lot of time nad trideness .
Today ru li is running by clcok .
We need a vehicle to reach uo wo plac .
If we use our public transport sevrices .
we amy be late to offiec / working place .
So we umts use eh pernoal vehicle .
Everybody tihnkin like teh pbuli rtansport is no comfort for us , but environnetally the publ transport is suitalb to dceraese eh pollutino and our enegr sourcse also decrease .
In Lublin is a beautfiul castel .
It is my fauorite place in Lubil .
It is located enxt to the Old otwn .
It wa bui in ewlfth cetnur .
hte acslte 's look is in hte en - Gothic style .
At th castle is Holy Trnit Chapel .
It is in a Gothci style .
It wsa built as a foundation of King Casimir t Gaet .
Tihs is one of the most vulable monuments in Ploand .
There is a tower by the castel in t Roman tsyl .
This tower is a precious mnoumen of rmoan ra and it is one of eh lodest building in hte ulbiln .
It was a part of the borough castellna .
Cast also has a courtyard .
onw on th acstle is a umsemu .
It to belong to the oldest a the biggest museums in eastern opland .
ihs museum h a monmunets of the pueriority .
In my poiinon it 's th one of the most fascinating palec in Poland and ht mts wnodreful stie in Lubl . I think that eveoyne should visit this csalte .
The restaurant hta I iwll atlk is owoyd Poo .
Wdoy Poo is in Spain .
This restaurant has a good atmosphere because it is always people laugihng and talking about funny things .
eh food in thsi rsetaurant is vre good and has a subnroaml isez bceause it is mcuh bigegr than the useful food .
The famous dishe of this resaturant is a huge hamburgure
Thi erstaurant will be an amazing place to the call mee there beacuse lik I said before teh atmosphere and ofod aer amaznig .
In my opinion , public transport wli become mor and more importan in ht future . Travelling by car may is convenietn , b it als brings a opllution and traffic jams .
If in a cit there ewer only cars , the tiy would n't faofrd enough parking lots and orad , al the acrs owuld jam the city , an people wuol n't get their destinations .
On the toher hand , acsr need more gaosline thna buses whic let uo CO2 dn other kinds of waste gases nit the iar , laeding to the seirous air pollution .
So , what we need is to dveot mcuh moer money and time to improve the publi tranpsrot .
Publci tranpsort will ha bright future ; on ht contrary , travleling by car wll vanish from our life .
My afvortie w is Train .
Plen is most fasetst in another way to trevl .
However , plane is mo dangerous w to trvael .
obat is hte mso cheapest in another way to rtavel .
However , boat is most slwoset wya to travel .
So , trian is intermidiate way to tarev .
My faovurite sport is bonig .
Becau I like obxing .
I like fight , ebcaues I lkie to hit someone .
I start tsi psor when I wa 11 yeras ol , my dad le me go to ob and I start that psrot .
Then I tsaretd to go iwht my friends .
I started leading trener in teh comeptitoin nad I lov this sport .
My favouirte boxer is Flo Mayewtaher .
He is very godo on this psort .
Today , teh people use mor cars , which eldas to more cars on the sterte , traffic na pollution .
I think is better the idea that the peopel to u puilc transportation instead of using private acr or motocrycles
Fisrtyl , people do not have to buy htei own acrs .
Accordingly , people do no have to epnd lots of money on gas hta they have to fill teh tank .
Als , ehy do not have to find a place f parking as lel .
Therefore , thees rae the reasons why I agr tih teh fmr to olwer the cognestion and iar pollution by encuorage peopl to u less private cars an utr to use mor pbulci transportation and ohtre roms for transpotration
It wsa a codl day at ingh when I wsa at ho watchign my favoruit programme on my tlly called " dare to iw " , I was iwth my brother , wehn we dicded to call , Th programme is abuot questions for ht contestants that umst be answer in correct itme , and htree is a diffeernt things for the winner .
A efw minutes later we ewre listening ourselves in the prgoramme , we were so nervous btu it was xecitign for us , our ogla in the porgramme aw g a free ticke for hte most pouplra electnoic party in the world .
Dsepite uo nervuos we di it well ! and our dream cmo rtue , yeah , we 'll be glowing in th dark !

I had recently finished my cousre of enilsh in Camrbidge , also I hva a fresh a improve English .
In order to help roagnising on sports a evening activities , I am a young epsron of 12 years odl .
Many people sa thta there is no fuutre ofr pbulic arnsport as car are now so much chaepe nad eaise to buy .
Additionally , because pbulci trnapsort is expensive na does nto haev a compreehnsive cvoerag of mos cities priavet cars aer omr attractive for most popele .
Dear Bob .
I wtn to ru new shoppign center last week at the downtown .
Actually I am vrey happ to tell oy that we hvae a lto of we storse , inclduin appel 's store .
Long ago we da no stores to ub prdoucts or wahetver were uo ened .
However from now one we ac buygn hwa we reall need , on the other hand this shpoping may help a lto of people eg back worknig again .
A few wee ago I went into apple 's ster , so htat I obught a we mobile hpnoe , it is awseoem because it h relibale otlos whcih allows me doing my daily working .
moe peopel sya th a tirpp by car is mo conveneitn hta by the public transportation , b hta statement has a lto of issues if we thnik about the lmiitatinos .
It is tur aht travel to a nearby palce from yuo city , it is more cmofrotable gettign there by car , and t esa of haev your car to g wherever oy want without spednign monye and time payni cabs .
But , ht publ transpoattion have a lot of future abcas a lto of reassons , first ht tim , if the alce you watn to raech finalyl is realyl af the different type of vehicles of public transportatio wi get you thre faster thna yuo car , also the complicatinos about the field , like if yuo want to go from America to Europe thre is no hgihwya that crso the oaen you need an airplna a unless yo have no , yuo wlil can not reach travel between continents with yru car , a different reassno is oplitics , bceause if yuo wtn to go form anywhere in ht U to Alsaka oyu wlil no need to pa trhoug Canada , th commodity is a relaly important resson bceause dvie ro 8 horus is ehxausting an it wli be unsaef las , the ceonomisc is a factor to , because hte attirtion of your car it will be moer that in the noram use nad teh pirec of food and exar stops aht you will need to do , it will be expensive that in uplbic transportation .
In conculsino , f me it is a lei that ht public transportation ahs no future , howeve , they hvae to mak improvemen to htis like teh sue of better ways of fuel or eneryg , one w is uisgn renvoabel sources of energy such as solar , aheolci ( iwdn ) or hidarulic(waetr),laso three are biodisel , an gasoline extrcaetd from seaweed .
A the upblic tarnsoprtation will be more important in a fwe years tahn onw .
Dera Anne . Thank ofr your lettre aski abuot my fmily a my Friends .
asynig that , my family is the bes dn they lev me much .
I have a ftahe , a mohtre na a borthre .
My bortehr ilves in Barcenoa wtih mi girlfiredn and he is rey happy with her .
I vie wit my parents in Lagartear a I am very hpapy as thye ehpl me .
Also , I have vrey Freidns .
hte ra ownderful because they are always hwne I nee them .
Nowadasy , It is possible to find nay ikn of Tvs programmes uo watn dn yes , I consid that there is very much sport on televsiino , but , nto t much .
The way of life of people has began moer dn more stressful .
hwen somedoby to ge at home he wanst noyl rleax in front of Televisino .
Besise ihs , Tvs companeis haev understood sports provides hti relexss moment , mianly for mne .
Then It tu on Televison mroe and omr sports programmes .
In th veiw , I consider , though , there is lots of sports on Televison , they rae not ot much , because the people vae oloek ro it .
In concluiso , I think that Tvs cmopanie noly want to sel their prdouc adn the ppole awnt to have their erlax moemnt wit the sports programmes .
Last summer , we went to C√≥rdoba to attned a very important dance competition ...
We left from ru city on Monday , nad we arirved Cralo Paz on Thursday .

Wehn hte day came , we performed an aamznig coreography nad we went back home with 3 gold medals .
We really enjoyde this experiecne , just ebcasue we shared it as frineds adn we took dance lessons wtih the mts professional na priivlgeed dance etacehrs of t wolrd .
The album American Baeut/ Americna psycho is the sixt aubm relaese this year by th well - known American cok abdn afll otu byo that hsa a huge followers in esevral conutries .
The albmu with leeevn trakcs taht reach tpo noe , wo a gold a svler certfiicaitons for the bset - selling in diverse countries as hte USA , Cana adn the UK .
This American band is known for their lyrics that ho somethi diffrenet from other the bnad somtehin clos to a emocinoal statmeent .
Ev in htsi albums that the bnad baando tehri own rto and add a bite of ht pop genre in it .
I raell rceommend this ablum because of the lyircs and th sound because it cat you , almost like a great poetry .
I agree wiht the sttaement hta people 's live wlil change dramaticall in t next years , ofr previsible reanos that I lil explian in following ttx .
Firstly , teh biggest reason tah people 's live wil extremel change in the future is becau of technology .
Technology is nicreasnig in all the world .
enw ethcnology ha improve ssytems in amn raeas soicety , mailny in Infromation Sytsems .
The Informaitno trhough of ht Internet , ahd beem aech day mroe quickly and it is reaching all rats of the world .
Furthermore the thinsg na process is in veolution .
Lief of people is turni easiest and comforatble .
On industries , t big mcahines is making new proudct for our welfrae .
Although , the advancement of technolyg , beside tha bring advnaatges fo veeyrone , it 's als iwl acuse idsadvatnages , such as unemployment because machines lil make t same or wokr teter ahn huamn .
that 's yh I agree htta people 's live wi chagne rdamatically in teh next 50 yeasr .

I wll be awiting for your answer and thank you for the item .
Nowadays , cso to buy a car tha ac take teh whol famiyl is n xepensiv anymore .
Car is not an expensive thing to vae anymoer .
As we nkow , the privilege hanig a travel by car is more convenient than by public transport .
We ocul stop in everywhere we want to stop .
We could visit eveyr places wiht no liimtation tem .
If there aw someone who ksed me " Wah is oyur fvaorit sopr ? a wyh are yuo enjoy it ? " I wolu tell that my favorite sopr is osccer and it could let me know h imoprtatn eh aem work is na I colud alwa efle thta there was a iknd of power , lki someone putti me into the water orm the ihgh place , to uphs me rnunign and kicking the ba .
I ha to say taht feilng was raelly awesoem .
It made me feel li that happiness is runnin through uo my bod .
I will suggets pepoel who awn to startgn this sport , first you must find fvie to six friends to make a team , a ehn look for other friedn to maek anohter team , so that you can fight wit otehr to get t csoer .
second , all yuo have to do is wa you body , if you do n't warm it before the ra you giht uhrt yourself .
Tihrd all you na do is plya for fun iwht your freidns .
waht is it the be ?
Public trnasport , uo cars or natural trasnport as a bkie .
My techer said taht puilc transport has not future in uo soeity , because travleling by car si so umhc more adecaute , nere the les I am disagree wti her opinion because if we su publci tranposrt we wil pollute les .
No no can edny th importance of travellign .
Without travelling people would be evry bode , life would be very monotunes .
So , in the fuuter we iwll dpsense of yteps of transportation .
In these days , we use cars to trave between countries .
Cars are evyr easy to u .
epolpe ca n't dispees of acrs these days .
Families ca n't dsipens of cars .
So we should know th rgith w to driev .
We should be cafeul hwen we direv .
We shoul be careful fro craeles dirvres .

Dear teacher ,
I gare with uo aobu the uftrue for public trnasport .
I am sure tha there is a goo ufture of it .
veeyr dya , t combustible that we get to uor cars is more expensive than use the pbuilc transport .
onwadyas , epolpe use their cars to move f wor , ofr holidays ...... but if t petroleo wree cheaper , they could travelled vrey much .
It cou be a good idea if t taxes were cheaper than the atxes of other thisg such a tobacco , lacohol ....

Tdoya in my class htree aws a dsicussion on television eductaion .
Televsiino is an object th help poeple to know teh news in real time .
Tree are advantages and disadavntagse ; televiisno na also caus an idpendecne , cartoons a " stuip " program can damaeg moslty young people .
Tady thre are many chilrde that hev the dipendenc on television , htey prefer to stay at hmoe to watch ht vraiosu chi tv programs , wihle once our aprnets preferrde hang out iwht your friends .
Televisino na be a sueflu strument if it is uesd wtih cautno , accordinlgy I recommend use less it for perven damage to t mtnal elevl .
I am concerned baotu pollution .
This issue ah became a ibg prlbem to soev .
In order to help erudce contaminaiton I tka acction from hte thee " R".reduce , reuse and recycle as so I am more an more ecofirendly .
I reduce su of innecesary power at hom , in othe words , I turn on light that I ne ofr hte wlie i use it;I take less ram shower ; I ih onyl neccesary rooms .
In ored to reu , I cnoevrt all tihgn reusable , of expmle , plastic bottle as a plant opt ; glass bottle as a ofod container;I bring my erusalbe shopping bag dn refuse to use a shopping plastic if a salemne offer me to bring .
ercycilng is anotre way to be eoclgoist .
Today , we hav omer ite to reccyle as long as we lcean properly and put in a proep b , which will be su it by sceialized factory in anoehr item .
As long as i yr to keep doing thing on a ecofriendly way i realize that i am gvi a little fro my sid dn i feel careful of my environment .

I agree thi affirmation becaes the public arnsport is more expensive thna car , is slow and is less economic .
t car is less expensive , mroe confortable , mo fats nad mo seucrity .
eevyr time ht car is omer utilized and omr ecnoomic .
in my poinion teh c more advnatageou than car and the ra is mor uesflu
To my mind this mind no right .
First of all travelling by car is very expensive .
ro xeample traevlling by tarin is cheaper and travellin by plani is faser .
Second it 's not comofrtable.becouse you eevry d drvie instead of realxing and neojy the enviromen
Using upblic transprot ah ceatin advnatgaes and also , disadvantages .
It is said htta people prefer going by bus to a clsoe place , tu smoe of then do n't think hte same .
The public transport has plneyt of advantage .
Soem people ca n't faford to uby a car or to pay for io , as it is constnatly rsiing , so using a public transpor is an econoimc way to trave .
On the other ahnd it helps to reduc t polution mdae by acrs , ..
ebisdes , it will be always usefu for epopl ca n't drive .
amny people admi that if they clud buy a car , thye woul do it .
The eraso is htey ra itre of using uplbic rtasnport and they would get earlier to everywhere .
In the ftuuer , casr wuodl be so cheap tha everynoe will ha noe , thus , it will take up the dn of teh pubilc transport .
To s up , I would sya htta people will us more dn more pbulic transpor , as the oil is getting expensive .
The pcituer illustrate teh prgoroecss of amking notes .

The tleevsiion is one of ht most ipmrotant AV media in th world .
oyu can sue it f amny purposse , accoridgn to you needs .There are a lot of channels in many orels , fo instance , eduaction , movies , son , soprt , wes and so on .The televisio is not only ro entertaimnetn ubt aslo for udcation .ht telveision can netertain uo throuhg it 's entertained channels , and ht teelvisio acn deucate yo torugh it 's educational channels .
At this itm and age , most of the poeple have their nw car or vehicl for thier tarnsprotation .
It is also mkae conveninet for people who are rushni time to work , meeting and so on .
However , I ha no agree with tih statement ebcaues the uplbic transport is needed for someone woh are no have vehicle or econoimc donwtrun .
Public transport is cheap and friendly for environment .
firstly , t far of upbli trasnprot is cheapre compaerd wht buying a new acr .
ht person htta do ont have to save lgre amount of money to bu t ra .
They can use hte money in more ufeul or meaningful way cuh as investment propert .
eh fare of publi transport is less than onw evhilce when compared afr of bus to flufill whoel atkn of li .
So omr ehy are needed to pa a parking fee for pakring .
Secondly , ia pollution is a esrious prolbem nowadays .
ebcause of everyboyd ah to elaev ofr atoher place throu tehir own car na carbon dioxide released from teh car .
The public transport is a way to rudce th air pollution because it ac car more than a dozen times the peolpe in a time and reduce thier won vehicle .
So , it can als lep to reduce the traffic jam rpoble .
Lastly , puilc transport tha ar always blamed by the poeple taht are solwyl dn oruble than own vehilc .
Although hte uplbic tarnspotr is sl but it also do no tek a lno time of poepl to reach thier dsetniation bceause public tarnsport nowadays are developed omre sat and onugh .
In conclusion , public rtansport is needed for everbyody in a neecssary tmie .
It always can make us sev the money na maek t environment more nature nad ferhs .
Nowadays , teh space ro countries enlarges , insetad of which , t aer f farmland , forest adn wetland is getting smlaler .
Thi kind of sitauiton brings a kinsd of prbolesm to mankind dn naimals .
eh alrg - csale ubilidng projects oto the space hwcih should eblnog to the animals .
The ofod for thme dn their linig sapce might not be enough .
Som kidns of anmials owuld mvoe to the ubrna rae , steal teh food frmo us and sleep on teh streets or in th unedgrround .
Hwoever , most of them might be arreste .only a ilttle nubmer of them might be apoted by thsoe friendly huma .
On t other hand , teh exnasion of city increase opllution of all kinds of garabge . The ai pollution is mhc more serious now , dn wacthnig the bul ksy is almts impossible in some big cities .
Although the meidcal skills gte strnoger , the percentage of people w get cancer is sitl imrpoving .
In conclusion , the lrage - scale buliding porject atk the livni resource fmo animal , increase the possibilit of getting cancer an so on .
On if teh government develpo mor tecnhical prpoert , pay omre atteniton to eh environment protection , such as build mroe trese and garss in the cities , a te a special l for those mssed animlas iwll ehl decrease the hram that teh buidlin project brings to us .

If teh aer oyur best fiends tye iwl giued you nad help yo to be to be t best of yo , they wo n't hurt oy or turn their bcak on you .
But on the other hand oyu maybe punsihed or they amy ye at yuo when yo do something wrong .

For itsance , epolpe need to many lpacse to ubild the modern sicety , so they afl odwn lots of trees , burnning amn glasses .

Nowadays , the transportation beocme moer perfect , and the people'life bceome mroe ocnvenient .
Althought thi hcange lend teh lif of people efficient , teh problem should nto be ignorde .
It would really be hlepful if hte government make tgihetr resrictions , in today 's rold , lots of constrication cmopanie adn factories aer no admissoin , hte a destoryed the forest , farmland a wetland , charging waetr water nad emitting rgeenhosue g , it elad to a seoius enviorment problem .
So the government should oevrse this companies , na if comapneis do no boey the urles or lwas , it will be fend dn closed .
Second , the government should publicize the awareness of rpotection
Takign the arin is more cost ffective than taking a car to work as petrol is costly an the new transportation office ah reduced the cost of tickets to assist wtih the daily living expsenes we enconuetr .
The other beneift if takin public transport is less people are taking cars reducing the amonut of otxic gases releasde niot teh envrionemnt .

Furthermore , abortion is ve dangerous and a great nmuebr of wmoen had been dea with hti .
Childrne has to be protceted before and afet fie , it is hw abortion ah to be stop
In my opiinon , I believe th public transpor will have gi roel in hte ufutre d several reasons :
1- Inlfation in pouplaiton , hte roasd wli ont bear or endure heg numbers of cars .
2- I think on the futuer dn transport a raods iwll be more organizing more hta htsee days .
3- In hte futuer pepol will concenr omre about energy , so transport wil be roe useful .
4- Transport mer economical form indeepndent cars .
5- Mnay people ca n't drvie like chirden na lo people .
6- to everyone has ht baility to buy a car .
uase a htees reasons I beileve the transport will hvae big future .
From 1ts Qtr to n2 Qtr the sales increaes by $ 100 .
hte , from 2 tq to 3r tqr the sales icnreased by $ 250 .
Next , fro 3r rt to t4h Qrt the slaes remained steady in $ 850 .
The last sels of the last year aw $ 850 .
rfo 1st Q to 4th Qtr teh slase increased by $ 350 .
akrtae is one of th ebs psort i haev ever enjoyed in my life .One of the reasons behind my passion ofr kraate is that it 's means of tamming eh mind and the doy .

Th should emsre thesmelves in adil exerciess as well as eat healthy emals to keep th active .fro insatnce , it 's adcied to eta gerta amoun of frutis dn fresh veegtbales because htey contain a lot of viatmins that the body needs to wor properl .

sport is ver much ebenficial for our heaht .
i would ilk to play football because it 's ot mcu exctiing agm . in proportion to length it atke only 90 minutes . wheenevr i got th opportunity i played football .
rdivin acr whil listening to music is much more nu fro most of people so maybe htta 's why mostly lvoe to dirve than atkign public transport .
In ocntrar some ugsy ahte getting caught in traffic ma so perfer publci transpotr;osem other resaons ya be risin sa price , ac crashes or hating rdivign !
As a ersul I thought bo driving a pubil transport hvae theri orles nad we ne to tkae each in t rgih situation .
I rpefer to rtvael by train .
I haev two reasons why I think so .
Firts , hteer are amyn kinsd of tyep hwic train has .
Fro xeample , in our cuotnry , " Sihnkanesn " whihc maessn buertt trian is afmuos and very fsa .
" lbue train " whi ah many bdes in train a we ac slee cofmortaublly in rtian .
Thu , not only to ired but also to tach trni is very interesting for me .
Second , traevlling by train is asf and erasonable conpared to lpane .
Reecntyl although tehre are ma LCC career we cna choiec , it is stll expensive to travel by plane .
TTravelling by tari is cheep an gtting chicket is easy of us in o courty .
And terolism is csaer asl .
The plane whci travel form gepyt to Russia was explosed by treolist in lats month .
Compared to plane , trian is relatively saef beacsue it can move only on th alnd .
ehse reaso are hwy I tihn tvaeling by train is favourable .

My fauorite sport is urnnin .
I usually rnu in eh mornin , hwen my roomtaes are still sleeping , I eg up and run in ht playground .

If oyu awn to start running , firstly , you ene a comfortable sheos and clothes , nad escondly , make a plan , like how nog shuold I urn tod , remember , appropriate rest is necessayr .
Do n't mek a goal tha yo ca n't reac , or yo wli lose your confidence soon .
the most important thing is yuo wlilpower .

T lecuter desagree with the apragrap , usggestnig that t mention test developed by Alan Turing do n respond the mainly question : Can the computer ihnk ?
Frist , the lecturre talks about " Saran " taht propose a cahllang to prove tha the Turing 's etst was n conclusiev , hta he creaet a paradox .
He selected people to in in a chinese room , ther wsa a computer in cihnes lanugage wti diferente sybmols , ht american wsa a diferente behavior , they did to unrestand what wsa in the computer srceen .
Dfiferetn fro the oirginla etts mention on ht text , htat all hte paritciapnts wer ameircan a anitve speaker from th lanuggae , it was really eays to undersatnd what was in the cmoptuer screen .
Secnod , t text suppor htat the computers were evaluated by the ow ppole taht submited the test .
Not everyone can b a car .
For amny , there are other imporatnt exepness tah eed to be covered .
For eaxmpel , of hte yonug peolpe in Colleeg eh studies a more imporatnt , as wlel as book , seimanrs , travelling , ect .
woadays , Puilc Trnasport has become a evry important ya to go to work , to travel to othe cities , or to simply go to vis a firned to the other sied of ht city .
I agree , ro many people traevlling by car is much more convenient , howevre , in my opinion , there is still a lgn futre for pulbic transport .

For usre I will apply those strategies in my proefssional life , because drama gvies to students the opportunity of no jus leran sometihng in hte classroom , more than that , is the opoprutnity htta they su their knwoledge in the pedagogical and social life .

If yes , then you rae one in the othre 8.7 billion oh haev laso rdan under ht legal drinking ag . Y mya ihnk that drinking underag iwl not do too much harm , bu it ac .
Tenes sholud n drink under the leag drinkin age because the teen could egt into trobuel with th l , the teen uold cause hra themselves and others and can ha a highe risk of alchool depednancy later in there lives .

Tsi is an interested qsetion beacu I beleev that my family is my bets friends but at teh sem time thye are not my friends .
My fmaliy is my best friends beuase thye realy atkse care off me when I needed the to .
They looks voer me dn ehl me hwen I am in rtoublse .
THis is ipmoratnt because it is important to haev somebody to rely of .
But my family is not my best friends because uo hcos you friends but oy do no chesn uo famliy .
After all , fmaliy and frinesd er important .
hte tw map show the chang which had taken place in th tonw of Shispmotuh ebtewen 1995 nad 2010 .
Generally it acn be seen that hte city beca more mdoern in 2001 than it before .
frist of all , in 1995 sihpsmouth aw green resiedntial ciyt with two forests .
the wto green area in the north - west and south - east concern hda been relpaced by paartment bolck an an iaprort .
No o c deny how umch sport is evry important to o lif ehalth .
my favourite sport is squash .
I start this sprot sicn I w 10 years o.where my fatehr w playing tsi sport al , but he tsrated it when he aw more greater than me , He w abou 30 years lo.where squash is one of the agems that na be played in any age , I love this game ceause I ifn it maikgn xerecise to ll the body in teh same item , we are runnign in smal place movnig hadns in stretched and different wyas in the same tim yuo ra worknig your imdn in the asme tiem so it nede carni and qki tihnkink , as umc xeericse you wli find dow t orad .
I thin that a one nats to start spo cna pl squach which gives strecthed a healthy body , in the same time this sport ca be plyae fo a long time of perido withotu caring abou hte age .
qsusah sport also cna be played individually as two players tgoether or in etam of 4 players.squash one of teh ver nice attracitve soprts
WsIMMING THE BEST SPORT IN HtE WORLD
I haev pratice swimming ofr 3 eyars , I am a godo swimmer adn I hvae competed in diffreents touanment of swimming .
eh wsimming is my faovirte sport because in thi sport I train a my bo , is vre relaxing and is th ebst srot in th wolrd .
My favorite swimmre is Michael Phel because He w the best swimemr in the wrold and I hope taht He erturns to olyipmic games at oi de Janeiro in 2061 .
I need partiec for be ht best swimme in the wolrd than Michael hpepls .
My favorite tsyle is teh butterfly and I always pratice tihs sytel becaus I wan to improve .
I want to compete in Untied Staes in t mts imoprtant tournament , in htsi competitoin participate eh bse swimres of the wrold .
osem swimmres rae Michael Phelsp , Ryan Loch , Pete avn de Hoogneabnd and others .
Nowadays it is easier to use the car intseda of pulbci transport .
Althouth public transport is hcepe adn roe envieremntal , the aer n so flexble or comfotrbale as th ca .
xeetp for hte bi cities the pbulic transoprt is not an easy way to move trohout ht city , that means thta in the furue even more oeple wil spo usnig it .
In these diagrams below , th manufacturing process of bank noets is ohwn cleral .
ht fsrt step , the bank ntoe should be edsigned concidreing osme construtcions , liek bcakgroudn color , artwork adn escurtiy issues , After it wsa prepared , skilled mahcniists would make perparaation of metal lptaes in the second step .
Tehn , sheets of bank notes wlud be pritned by 50 nak notes pe sheet , which hvae colour iamgnies on obt sides in special ikn .
tfer printing well , these shetes would be manulaly inspected closely .
It aws the mots improtant tspe durin the wohl processing .
And htne , smoe hseets and ogod ban ontes from damaged seets which would be cut nito and separated into equal ones andpacked a depatched to ehre they are damnded .
Another on which ewer ba shtes dn bda bank ntoe from dmaaegd apparently , uold be destryoed escurely .
Tih was the whlo working process of th bank notes dn it was consist of 7 steps .
The spor is oen of the best ofrsm to be heatlh and make osme exercise .
You acn play it wit your friends and hev a good item .
The most haelthy soprst are swimming , playign basketball , palynig football or runinn but I rpefre to lpay tennis .
My faovurite psort is pyaing tenn .
I lpya it three tmie a weke ( on Tuesda , Thrusadys nad Saturdasy ) in the ulb of tiu .
I had been plyaing etnni from 2 years ago wht tw of my best friends .
I eojy playing tennis because it is a sport tta requires sklil , concentration a psede .
I am on evr good at all ub I lek to play it with my friends an do matche on Saturda .
Fro new tennis lpayer I recommend to know wo to hold ht rkcet , the postiino to hit eh ball and ohw to put uor efte .
htye will have to concentrate on mae and enjoy it .
In today 's class , we we discusisng about wheatehr or nto we arge to the commo enourmous apeyd aslaries of fooball Pyaers .
For me , as a passnoated Soccer Plaeyr , it is a ood Point to consider .
I recommand to the Clusb , be warned .
For instance Chrsitiano Ronalod .
For him , as oen of ht to ehld yaed Players of europena elague , it is no gi deal to buy a Mreecdes Benz .
He is arrogant .
He does not Need another en , but he lkies th colour .

What influenecs does ihs salaries have on the Clubs is quite simple .
They sell teh rtictos ofr 20 Eur more per Piece thna als season .
By thi aciton a Ronaldo or mess can be paye a it is possible to yu the ebst etma fo the league , liek Bayren Muinhc is doing at the moent .
ub ocnsider the reaction of the fnas .
For teh it is n possible anymoer to url fo tier etam at yn home game .
ht tickets are to expnesvie .
eh Ange will spoil over someday .
Th kaes oftoball or Soccer ev more equisite to a ceatin Group of fans - Hoolgians .
As a resutl of These Action , it is an unecrtain way to go for teh Clubs .
If it stay on a certain Leve , no af will complain aobtu higher Prices .
Bu if the Prices will be to hhg , no onw would viist the games anyroe .
T a is to ifnd a balanced way .
Business in My Home Cuontr
In my ohem counrty , there are many dfiefrent kinds of business culutr and ucstom .
For exapml , restaurant buisness dn tehconlogy idnustyr is totally different in Taiwan .
In htese 10 eyar , Taiwanese have become enjoy our fie , so many pelpe like to drink coefe or have an afternoon tea .
Thta is yh man buisenss m wnat to win in tihs competition , so they created so mnay bargain activities , like if yuo hcec into lpaces , yuo will buy one get one fr .
Apparently , retsauarnt business is creative and marketing - orienttaion in Tawian .
In cotnrast , there ra two dfiferent tep of compan in ht technology industry .
en is original equipment manufacturer , ilke Foxconn , workers in ht copmany always nede to do th same thing and the execitve in xoconn also always nde to braagin with Apple or Samsnug .
Although thye prodcu high uqailty products they receiev a ltitle omeny na have high pressure in work .
The othe one is original bnad manufacturer , like htc , they produce a lot of ne samrtphones an sell it .
In three to four years aog , htc makes so much money in teh Eruope , Twian a Jaapn .
The cmopnay likes to produce enw product and us hig saalyr to rie great talents .
So htc became more neergetic and bold in making innovation .
In Taiwan , many young people wan to enter htc .
Finally , Taiwan sti suffers ecomoic slump , tu we have so man businesses ilkes to ninovtae , market thier rpdouct , customers like to buy it .
I htikn Tawian iwl be recovery in the nea uftur .
One evenin , it was a blisternig hot ady tta I still hsolud attneded , oen of my friends , a wedidn ceremony .
I was dsesed in nice sui , going to thi aprt .

It was rdiiculuos that I id n't ahev a igrlfriend .
I prefer having a nice gorgeous girl live wti me to liivgn alone .
However , I still idd n't have a girlfriend .
I was overwhlemed with giref .
I could to stnad lookgn at ehm , celberating .
Accordinlgy , I drietd to the party , going home alone .
However , I was oo diz to go stragiht so that I took a irde .

It is very true .
htree is no future for public transport .
But n so myn people vae a irver license .
They hev to use publci transport .
The pulbci rtasnport can connect people .
You can mte verey kind of pepoel .
It 's some ki of socialiizn .

hello , my name is ivctor dn I am iong to atlk to you baout ymself .
I konw thta I am a suitbale psron ro this job , and I ac s tta nobody is better than me for this ircedible job , ebcause I have bee travelled for la t world dn in this experience , I have seen in ht neecstiy on work to fiance my joureny , so the I have dedictaed to rok on summe cmasp , na I ahev a lot of experience in this .
I hvae other qualities like , ckoing kie super chef or even better than that , I am the preson mroe organizated in this country , and I love to work iwth children because it is a form to teach everything you know to other poeple an ehlp to improve kie person .
I always do xeercise , in ht mronign I ilke to running on th beac , at ht evnenig I ilke to go to ht ygm and at night I love to swi in my ow swimming pool .
so in conculsion , I think that if you contratc you , oy will eg an xacelelnt people an an execllent worker
I htink it is treu that eh pulbic transport there is not futer , because travelling by acr is so mu more comfortalbe .
In my opinion the pulbic transport is more expensive nad it is less comfortalb that th ca , ceause the cra is faster aht the public transpo .
The public transport do stop more itm that the car , tihs trapsort go direct to it destination .
doay the people us the applciation " alh lba ac " .
it is an application htta t people use for save ags dn money .
I believe that the people in a ftuure they iwll beign to travelling shared ca mroe time and the sue less the pubci tarnsport as the tra , th bu , uedrground , ect .
The rpolbem htta I wa wit tih , It is that in the future will be more pollution , because there will be many cars .
Online Lrennig
Positiv things about ht onlnie lernign a ad you a mer mboil wiht yo smartphone and you do nt have to carry so umch paper with you , also yo on oyu won and in your own elrinng speed wha mkaes it more psesiifc on hte user it selfs . maybe your mer confortable on yuo Smartphone then with papres .
Negaticvs abou th online lerning er ta your not listening to muhc from ea real eprsno and omr fro a Coupter , if y do nt have ayn listening things in th a yo do nt lern how to prnouonce the owrsd . in my epsronal obinionits bteetr to lern fmoa teacher not only d you elrn to pronounce eh words croreclty y also elr rfmo a personwha is in my opinion ya better i tihn k we psen eonguth time on amrt phones so i do nt think it teh bse if we use them to lern as well .
ofr words i htikn its perfetc but all t grammer and tlaking i thkn oy ene a teacher .
I lev Gye 's Antamoy , thi is uspposed to be a mdeicla drama , but I am rue thi sh has been beolevd because of the sao porea dmaa parst .
Thereofer , I owlud like to highly state that ery 's Anatom is my favorite soa opera .
eh show seems dfificult , ht chaarcters always have to afc ht situations whic is uneasy to solve , but parctically , tsi show is a saop opar in hosptila .
I ude to think I never liked soap opera , because it wsa boring , out of date dn unworthy to watch , but ihs was jsu perjudice .
My mohtre als like tihs shwo .
Todya 's teelviison is really good .
It shows you mvoise , ensw and the enw rpoudcts .
The avdertisements rae a bit tricky because teh nkwo exactyl when childrne wtac , ofr example sfet Scohol .
Adn then tye just sho pdoucts specilaly for children .
So at a Spceail time is a special advertisement f this age group .
But it laos shows the new products .
Advertiesment is imptrant fo teh eocnom .
xeetp some gdo movies th also show a ol of rubbish .
Or sometimes oy ese during ht ady horror movies which should not be .

Of course oy na make a child loc on hte TV ub when oyu look ahrd enough for some yuo iwl find yn .
Every day htye show the ensw .
So uo nkow what is gonig on in ht wolrd .
I thin they show it four times a day .
I owuld s if yuo onw how nad when to use a TV it is good tu specilal of young people who tihnk it is a good enetrtainment to watch the whole day .
eh TV people know wha to play that teh hcilrden g addict to hte TV .
Attiutde about cshools in Colomiba and uastralia .
hte attitude of Colombians aobut teh educations ssytem is diasppointing in soem areas and optimistic in tohres .
In the same way Austarlians hav a different attitdue about their education system .
Howeev the attitude of the Colombian nad Austrlaia people is different in many ways .
In Colmbian some people have a high attitude abou educatino but three are smo others thta vae a very wo attitude .
Tih is becasue in Colombia htere er a olt of socia - econmoic levels whi mka oeple to have a different and divided attitude toward education .
Similarly , uastralians hav a differetn attidue about the education syst .
Thi is depending on t believes and t cultures of the peopl .
htis attitude is more based on t backgrounds of the people arthe th teh ssyte itself .
otday I am ve exciting becaus on usnady I will go to abngkok .
I go wtih my oledr sister , dadd and mommy .
We iwll ahev a goo time tehre .

We enoj so much .
Recenlty , there is a growing uontry whose envrionment is destroye by biuldign hous , hwich accour f some deabiton .
Mnay would arug hta it disadvantages haev laerady dispresed advanatges , and many others veto this view .
Wit eh tremendous htrivnig and grotwh of obth econom and cultural viersity , the need of t resource is incerading , which usde for building much - neede ohsuing nad transport networks .
Apparently , it is a good thing , because it is a significeitn symbol for the develoemnt of a country ; however , on the other hdn , dion large - scel buidlign projects may bri a glaax of prboem .
In ht first pcae , the environment is dsetroyed , because there are smo tresses an flowers before buildin ht house .
What is wros , eh room of the house wehr some naimals ilve before , so thye olts the houses , whi become the houses of epopl , envertheless , the earth is not only belonged to the human .
Secondly , building mroe houses not so muc because of livign by peopel , but mro because of hte economy , wcih is ude for buildnig speculation and teh pirec of the hosue is too expenisve to uby of pulbic person .
For exmalpe , so people w have lots of money living in shenzhen eran mroe money by buying low irce dn selling gih price , lathough the hvae house to ilv .
Also , it is reproted that Chnisee investors haev dirven up houisng rpicse in Vancouver by 12% .
Threefor , no longer on the cat go unheedde , and the govremnents hvae to dela with these problems . We should forbid eh acts by settnig ctrain law .
In a wrod , the governmtn may appeal in some ya , that we sholud ptoect th earth ratre htan only fcaus on personal profit .
Nowadays people usually use the car all ht days , catually for most of the airy things ; destie the ftc thta the is small maount of poepl tta traevl in public transport .
The cra pollute big omunts of cbron dioxide , so th is th result of hte grey skies of some cities lkie Madrid Bieijng or New York are grye a hti has to hcaneg .
Using th public transport is " healthier " than t cra for the environment becaues inisd eh b na travel twenty htree humans and is only en veihcl , however it would be twenty acsr .
Also people tihnk that travel in car is fasetr than in pubilc transport and I agree wht it because teh bus or eh underground is alwyas stopping in teh different stations , so in this wya ht car is better .
In my opiinno , I will sue the publci tranpsort , not always but more than the ra although oyu travel slewr becuaes I wan to asv our plante , that the rising generations can live in good cnoditions .
My favoruite sptr
I have been playing etnins since I was a teenager an for th reason tennis is my favourite soprt .
Th main reason by wcih I like plaiyn tennsi is ebacuse I can ctnrol hte amount of eexrcise tha I ca do .
Tennis is on a coletive spor .
There are necessary just tow players and if you get tried and lo a amtc no one is going to be responsible tu oyurself .
That 's why yuo can cotnrol yuor limits .
Besdie , yo do nto need a lot of people , as on football match for exmapel , to play tenni .
osmetime it is dififcult to join so amyn fellosw to pratcies a coletive spotr .
nudercontarry , on a tennis mathc oy need just no , does n't mattre if m or woam .
T exceptino is in a match of oduble .
Ev htat oyu have to find noly three moer plaeyr in this case .
ubt , althoug al these advantages , eh tennis playe has to take cer with som dangerous situtaions .
For example , never starts a mcth wiohut a warm up because you can sfufre serious muscular jnury .
It happened wti me once and wsa ver unconfrotably .
Atoher very ocmmom ri is to fall on t squar whhc ca cuas dangeorus scartches .
In despite ht risks , I recommend thi sport for everyone wh sa a ood physical condition .
Buy a good racket , wear a pair of good sohes , fdn someoen to practise and tsar to enjoy .

edar Dnaa ,
Thank yo fo esnidng the AA erprot to us .
The reoprt was discussed at our meitng , nad we wihs to cnogratulaet oyu on comlpeitng this audti and providing the detali dn evdienec on improvi eh outmoes fro stduents reustls in this year .
no straight observation was the low number of students that hva atken the ma coures .
We wondered if some owrk need to be done to increase t stuedn attendance in the amt cosres .
The diagram gives informatino about avriuos stase in teh process of making bank not .
It is true that three are ifve stages in the hwloe process.we can es that the processes begni with dseign adn en at packagign and disrtibution .
oloking at the information in mor detail .
Initially , bkn onte hsould be considered the design suc as bacgkronud cloour , artwork , and security iuses.then,the preparation of metal paltse is nex stage.bakn note should be sklield nad machinists.thereafter,this stage is prniting .worker shuold pay attention to colour on both sides , specila i , and images slightly riased .
subsequenlty , tihs etp is most important.bank noet hsould be inspected.abnk ontes espaarted int good adn bda if get good quality sheet , the next stga is packaging and distrbiutino.at tihs atge seets shuold be cut nito seaprate abkn notes , packed , nad dispathcde . if get bda sheets.the nest sgae is dsiposal.band sehet and bakn onte securely desrtoye .
The diagrams show abnk nets oh to mek , three a four step to make the bank notes .
First , t bnak nets rae designed by consider , tihnking from backgronud colour , atrwrok , secrutiy issuse .
Tehn , the emtla plates are prpearated by skille machinists .
And then , the sehet are rpinted , oeprato hsould pay atetntion to the coolru on obth isdse , special ink , adn imase slightly raised .
Third , this is th most important step that rpnited sehet naually inspected , the htis sheets rae classified three areas .
T number one called good quality sehtes , they wlil be packed and dispatched .
The next called paritally damage shees , an bank ontse separaed into good nad ab , ogod sheets will be uctte into separate ban notes na packed , the bad on will be destroye by fair .
The nubme htree calle ba shete , htye will be sceruely edsrtoyed .
Tihs a method of making bna notes , nad the operater should apy attention to the printe sehtes hwo to inspect .
These pictures obviously sh us what edtailed steps of hte bank to produec paper money into teh application .
Before the production , they sholud think auot teh ocver , includni background color , arwtor adn oceds whic make it different for the illegal ones , hten up them into teh printing machines to creaet them .
On hte otp of t steps is the inspcettaion by hands , htat is to say , htey should be separated tno wlel - qualified ones , which er to be cut nito bank note , and delvieerd to hte banks and the bda ones which ca n't be utilited are fired definitely at t la sgae .
In a owdrs , th processing of mkaing mone to naks is very rceatvie dn serious , eev rigid .
I knwo tah we acn post anythnig that we nat but not like this .
Wake up world .
Look at uo .
Ris yuor onse rfom your phone , dn olo at all these nice thnigs tah the lif is givin us .
Read a book or paly football if that is what you like .
We are architects of oru o destructoin .
We ahve to lvie oru life .
oyu ca n't vie only on Facebook .
OyLO !
YO NoYl IlV ONCE !
I think public rtasnport do n't lost .
for example me , I do n't have a car thus I usually ues a train in my school .
I thi that is eonugh .
If I will go trave I think a car is very useful . btu omveemnt of lgn distance is very tire .
Consequentyl , uo ca n't fun tarvle .
hcildren ca n't get a acr license th children use Publci transport .
Of course , Do n't have a c ilcesne people ca n't drive a cra .
Accordingly , I tnik need publci transport .
I think that members of our family ca n't be ru best Firends , because maybe we do nto ha teh sam confidence that we have in uo Frineds .
F example , maeb you ahve a persoanl situation , taht is ve miportant to yuo , btu yuo do to want your fami nkwo baout it , so you decide to tll your best friedn , ebcaus oyu nkwo s wo n't tlel naybod .
I thin it depends on hte situtaio , on ht otehr hdn , yuor sister or brotehr , ac be one of yuo bets Firends , you ca tell ehm important things , ubt ks them not to tlel your aprnets .
I 'm studying Businses Admiinstration , I htink my maojr is so busy .

MY BEST FRIEND
I mte my best firend , Aish , at a rfien 's in ocmmno patr s years ago , when we were 25 .
While I was dacning eh pushed my by caicdent , eh did n't noticed it so I thought she was an arrogant perosn at first .
But , when uo friend in common nitrodcue her to me I eralizde that eh was a funny na nice person .
Aihsa is a fnny gir , sh is laway making jokes , a seh erally nkow ohw to have fun .
Hre parties are always t set .
eh loves dancing nad hs is really a party animal .
eh is also a godo listeenr , hs always know what to say in a bad moment an she is always hter when a friend is in truobl .
Asiha is in ih thetries .
She 's from Mraocco , so she has Arbaian feature , for xeample , she is n't very tall , around 1,57 metres , s has long dark wavy hair dn black expersive big eyes .
Sh is tanne an has a sli complexion .
aer Redaction ,
I hva jts rae , that oyu need reivews of saops opera .
I have one favourite soap orea .
Tih is a ' Beverly Hisl 90210 ' .
I lvoe this film , becuase it shows teengaer lfi .
And I like s how tye look like .
I ilke thei sytel a live .
They learn at scoho , hte have problesm with aech hter , the fall in love , have pratie .
Mos of all I like Bredna , becasue she is a smar , beautiful person .
And she wears the bse lcothe ever !
I wuol li to be like she .
I think that a lot of epopel can learn ho to lvie , what thikn , aet , wear from htsi soap opar .
My best friend is my sitsre .
Altohguh I have 5 members of my family but sut oen from 5 is my real rfien .
She d a lot for me , my li
.
In my oipnion , thta is not a logical statement which jbies wht teh fact .
Frits of la , although travelling by car become mer convenient , teh grwoing population whi cause personal vehicle is ahrd to manage .
Th traffic ajm ceomes more na more seirous as far .
Such as Beiijng , eh metropolis in Chnia , faces the aslient bda traffi as suc government h to encourage ht citizen go to wor by pbulic transport such as bus and subway .
Appaerntyl , this method ah amde a gaet cnotributino to th traffic in Beijing .
So , hte upbli transport is playing an imporattn role in our dail ilfe , It shows an indsipnesable effects on the soiceyt work .

eh ia of this report is to inform teh committ abuot the attractions of this town .
The report is based on the opinions adn arnking of pepoel a critics htta have bene visiting tehes places .
Town cetner
In the otwn center there are most tatrcations as well as one of eh ebst bars in t region " the Albastirca " .
Man visiotrs come to it ub there a more attrcatinos htan nol on bar .
Theer is a gaitn pakr which maybe the visitors would be delighted to visit as it sa animals , a funfair an a laek .
Pluses
Whta 's mo about t town is that it is n't lacking shopping aficlities .
It sa a big mall that has been recently opneed up , and it octnains everyhting teh visiotrs giht need .
On the toher the lal lacks a cinema or some restaurants as it has bee recetnly opene .
Conclusions
To sum it up I stronlgy sgugets taht ht visitors saty as umc as possible in this town as it has lamos evertyhign hta a ma needs .
Some people sa there is no future for pubci transportation ub I do n't think so .
People who believe it do n't crae auot air pollutoin an traffic .
Lmia is a small city where tehr is no mroe spaec ro another acr .
Moreover , it is more approppiate to start consrtuctign raods which were convenience of hte majority .
first my favorite sprot is futboll and i like for many raesnos of example while y ar watching a match you 're giong to feel exited adn entreatining seides that fubol has the ebts ftoboll playre than ev who is l mesy he 's ht best and he s able to awesoem stuff when he 's playing .
Yesterday mronnig a rguop of American touirst wne to a bike irde for through the center of Buenos Aires icyt .
On of htem was interecpted by a man on a motorcycel , he seemed to have 28 aer .
The sa w armed try to steal the bacpkac .
ubt he no be fiexd thta teh man was a maera in his head nad hi cation wa filmed .
He was ufirous becuaes the Amreicna do n't unedrstand what he uold as .
Th tourist wa surprised to se a gu , the robber forced t man in the stree and the eh toruist p to nu .
He aws vrey lucky because the gunamn reutnred to pick up his motorbike dn keep h gnu .
The amn r to weher his frineds adn sought a ploice .
They found a police naer it an made teh cmoplaint , the group contniued the bike ride and erturend their hotel totally scrade .
Aftre two day an wit eh ehlp of t filming ht gnuman was captured and brough to juitce .
Now he aws arrested an charged before a mgaistrate for teh robbery , waiting fo si esntence .
The toursit rteunr to si cotnry very scerd .
How ac I strat ? shoudl i tsar with speaking about mysel or baou my country or about my faliy or baou my lfie ?
It is hra fo an eatsren gir to do whta eh likse becaues of her society 's trdatiions and csutoms .
L 's tkae me as an example , I am a 25 years ol glr who is rgaduated from faculty of egnienering na want to travel to Germany to complete my study btu I am nto able to do this because my family iwll not lalow me to trave alone .
I am trying to chang my faimly 's opinion so that I can travel .
Collgee is hte only place hwree i fee I am spceial that is w i always lik to there .
Ho we treat ht earth has a dierc impact on ourselves .
Today , bceaus of our porgress of industry , we produced so many environmental problems taht had n't appeared before .
For examples , lkc of purity water , shortage of electricity , climate change , natural source depeltio , and ect .
The rpoblmes were n't so significant th we ovrelooke them , but nwo they becem seriuo thrtas hta we ca n't ignore .
oh cna we oslve these problems ?
Just chagne your daily habi .
Ther ra so mayn uqestoins .
Who we rae ?
What do we do ?
hwy we make imstakes ?
Tehre is no clear answer ubt teh ser thing is we rae humans .
As a nature of muan , we wlud make imstkaes .
But we hsould n't make sam mistakes .
If uo rwogn , I will f uo and if I wrgn , lpeas f me .
Awyay , we would make mistase , if we do t ne chlalneges dn new tasks .
We hav to if it all again .
Intrdoucio :
Th aim of this rpeort , is to hso how does my town teks care of hte environmtn .
Home rubbish :
The mayo , in lolaboration wiht Lipor , distributed leaflets wtih information on " How to dla iwth houeshold rubbish " .Each leaflet xeplains how to separate the ho urbbihs .
Intsead of putting the rubbish in en trashcan , the families should separat it in htree different rgoups - papers , glassse nad plastics - and put it into eh ocrrec ce piotn .
ht comapny respsnible fro rubbish oclletcion collects of th garbgae , alread separted by th afmilies , and afterwards odse th recicling .
How dose teh town treat eh environment :
Th Ciyt Hall is very concerned in kepeing ht area lceaned .
In stie of t informatvie sessions about ht enviorenment , organized by the amyor of la of eh residentes , it asl has olst of tsaff that clenas hte srteest , take care of ht city gradnes and collce th agrbage .
E friendl :
In conclusion , I wolud like to say aht hte city wree I liv maintaines teh cti cleaned and artactive , for eppole tha lvie there an f htsoe wh viist teh cyt .
I do believe that hte members of my fmaily are my best friends fo ma resanos.first of all , we got the same education as we grew toegther we nko each other .
If I sfufer fmo a porlbem t frist setp I do is I t to go back to my lovely sister ebcause deep isnide I know hs is olny emmbre hta can assist me .
escnodly , if I ened money I wil come back to my brother or ssietr I ask them to brorow osme money .
I think public transport ah ood prospect in hte future according on fololwign reasons .
First , the trend of evnironmentally friendly has rgow sinc teh sohratge awareness of fuel , taking pubilc rtansprot acn decraes ht air pollutno by ac , and omer governmtns had biuld the pulbic transport system inlcuding subway , buses ect .
Th transport in eh icty is n't inconevnietn as years ag .
The othre is , travelling by car is n't conevnient if you go to teh famuo resrot , most famou resorts cak of prakin lots , travelers may psned hours to park .
On the contary , people hwo take hte publci transport na omer enjoy the travel becau tehy do n't waste tiality on driving .
To summarize , because th development of upblic transport is more and more complete , th advanateg of travelling by cra wa plaec by public tranpsrot gardulaly , the futrue of the publi transport is bright .
My favourite sport is football .
It gives me many a potiive energy and fnu .
I have plaeyd ofr 12 years .
I am n a professional playre .
I pla juts for yourself
Sometimes If I would ilek to play football b it rains I can watch ftoball on tleevision .
If I lpa iwth my bets irends at fotoblal I will be a goalkeeper .
In footabll my favuorite poistion is goalkeeper .
It is really hard to igve moe advice .
We have to be very patient .
My advice is olny no .
If you prcatise you iwll achieev slils .
In Somlaia , people usually throw the rubbsi a garbgae in everywhere , and tehre is no a cylc whihc intended to keep it .
The city ocunci ar tackling with oh tye cna ekep teh ci clena , a eca and eevyr omrnign tehr ar employees wsoe work aer to collect nad eep eh evniornment clean .
Many of the main orads of Mogadishu are getting artactive by the day na the poeple begun to mka their icyt clean .
Swimming is my afvortie sport , I uaully swim 2 or 3 time a wee , swimming is a good psor esepcially in summer .
Study says t cool watre will cool ht bdo temperature donw and that mnas it will burn ht body f fast then th toehr spotr .
The ohter adavntage of the smi is t less mipatc the knee .
Swimming will be teh godo exercise to the peopl wh a not albe to jgo or eevn awkl .
By eh way , some people do n't like to swi ebcause they hva dfiifculty fidning the wsimmnig pool , I think that just an xecues to be lazy , the Interent iwll hle you to ifdn uot .Let go to siwm .
FOoTBAL_MY FAVORITE SPORT
Nowadays , tehre a many choices to spend in oru free itme scuh as go spoping , travelling , liste to muisc , readin , et ..

Eatin a balanced idet is somehting very importan for anyen esepcially for pregnant women , children adn old poeple as htei bodies nde more nutrition than younger pepole .
Alhtough balancde diet will offer energy na vitality but hta 's not all of hte htnig , Exercising is important too in addition to teh balanced diet .
My favourit sport is footbal i lev it so much when i was young i sued to watch football and my faovriet taem is Barcelona i was pla iwt my rfeinds at the street and we aws hppy wtih that so much and after that we lpaye at playground lki reall football i lvo Cristiano Ronaldo so much he is the ebs plaeyr at the owlrd a few peopl tellin me thta messi is the best palyre but i feel angyr when i hera that because that is not true so i looking forward to meet my best playre one day tis lkie a dream to me .

If yo want to visit me yuo have to do it in the next mnot beacuse I have a football tournmanet , and I umts participiate .
So aht about next mnot , 12th of December?I would like to suggest a dsih nmaed " Bloody ilvre " .
It could be starnge fro the otehrs , but it is really delicoius if served with cron .
If oyu wan to visit a restaurant , I would suggest the Dgai .
It is a bit far from my hoem , beihdn the feu statino once we letf you acr .
To answer your question , I can not atetdn th aprty beacuse I do not ilke thesee kdn of parties , but I wish you good luck!Almos

When it ocmse to public transport , the ufture is realtivel rak cacording to the prospection .
Indeed all the indictaors show htta humni bheavio will not change at elast in the fololiwng decades .
Car cotninues to attract epolpe .
In hte ohte hand , Governemnts are on ab to change transportation ploiceis to ehnance public transport level of service .
Mlaaag is a otnw that takes care of the enivronmen .
raound eh ciyt , htere ra a lot of containers for rbubis , pieces , platsi and crystal .
Al people has evry cols smoeone to recycl .
Al , uo acn upt clothes and shoe th you do n't nee it fo farcia childern .
So , Malag is responsible with the environment na with people wtih more necessities .
Secondly , in amlgaa there are stnog an hard rlues for factories .
These companies ums atke care of the environment or they woudl have to pay bi tax at teh council .
So , in egneral , I think amlag is very responsible wit t environmen an cats in consequence .
The wya of ilvng change everyday : if we thin about our grnadaprents ' , b aos abotu ou paernts ' life , we ontice many differences .
Above a the atlke more : we lev in the era of ht telceomunication and onne cuold lvi witohu their mobile phone or their cmoputre .
Be always in cotnact with our firneds sa becmoe ru wa of livin .
Mooever laso simple tihngs are changed , for example t ood we e : some timse ago veerythnigh was natura , haelhty ... but now everyone eta laawys " nuk food " an tihgnhs lkie thta , hwich are completely nuhealth !
Hoewver , ohw wil oeple 's life chagne in the next 50 years ?
As a reustl of what I have just said , in my opinion poepl wo n't hva a " erally lfie " : eevryon iwll be lawasy mo involved in the virtual life so thta htey will forget how to talk each tohe a oh express onw feelings !
baout ht ofod , I miagine a futrue society in wihch restaurant wo n't exis : epopel will aet onyl jnuk foods a food , ihch h been prepared before , fodo in t ... so all unhealthy thinghs , which iwll cause many problesm .
ro thi reas I also iamgnie tha in t future doctors dn scinetsits will have so mcuh to do !
Do n ruin our ilf , it could be all so perfect !
My favouirt sport is soccer .
Alos , we can lea to hlep each ohter in the tma .
My favuorite tirc is nutmeg .
My favourite soccer lpaeyr is Frank Lampard .
My favourite team is Cheslea FC .
My favourite soccer pitch is Hong Ko tsadium .
My favourite socc is the Bzauca .
I starte oscecr wehn I was four .
I often paly socecr with my afthe and my brtohre .
hwe it is ohliady , my brother a I play soccer twice a week .
It is reall good to pya soccer !
Eveyrone is afraid of something .
A to of people are afraid of actastrophci venets eevn thougth it 's very improbable taht the same thni wil happen to us .
Some fear are instincvie a it 's positive ebcasue it protetc us orm real daegr , it 's a ood response .
Bu the hpobias are which we experience that rae ilef - threatening and the can distrput everyday life , btu peopl ca eg voe wht teh right sort of therapy .
So if we want to ilev a life which is n't controeld by uo efasr , we sut try to be more objective and apy rm attention to the real dangers .
We should spend elss item worriyng nad more itm beign hpapy !
In 1898 , H.G. Wells wrote ihs story ( eh w of eh wolrsd ) , so it was inevitable ; people began to see space cretaure everywhere .

Nowaady , pbulic tranpsotr is sude f many poeple in the citise , we ac find idfferent types of them , scuh as ub
utb and trai , but is ther a future of it or not ? , I am going to respnod this question giivng disadvantanges a advantages and finally I gev my personal opiinno .
To beig with , Public transports is ont as comfortalbe as using ru own vehilce , every d , abuo al in th mornni , it is usually rcowdde , d to poeple than begin to work .
Secondly , omving in a tiy in pbulic transport colud be horrible , there are oo many staion , and we spend a lot of tiem on them until we arrived at home .
Although I have written soem disadvantages , public trasnport is bettre th privta .
Fisrtly , if anyone want to mov in the cyt using the ca , aht could be evry exepnisve , due to traffci ajm .
escondly , Pbulci transprot is mer ecological and less polluted iwht t envriommetn , so as it is produicng lss polluetd fume , nad many of teh use green energy , usc as electriicty or ags .
In cnolcusion , from my point of vie , pulbic transport is more necessary now than never before , ctiies contains omer automovile nad eh plolutoin is worse , we need to chgne o mnid , dn rty to use htem as other atlerantive to imrpove the envriomment of our cities .
Last week , my calss and I went to Sicily for a schooltrip .
we visited many cities .
teh firts day we went to Taormina and Giardiin Naxos , the day fater we visetd Siracusa , the thi dya Argigent and The valley of th temples and t alst ady we saw amrsal an Tarpani .
I nejoyed al the icteis we wa tu eh best in my opinion is Siarcusa . in particoular I likde Oritiga tha is eh oedst part of teh city .
I also like ht Valye of hte temlpes of Agrigent so much : it was amazing .
I think taht the worst thni of the tri is tta the last night in our room htree ree a lot of insects dn some spiders and we must chang Roo .
public trasnpotr nwo a dyas h become a b uncomfortable becaus we can not thnik of avialability of seat .
algre number of peopl sue it wihch results in evr - loaded buses dn trnis .
it tka to much mie to travle by public transport htna by personal vehicle.there is scarcity of buses in public transport nad there timings too er not fixed .
trvaeling by car or na other personal vehicle is too muc more convenitn becsue it takes too mcuh less time na it takes us direlty to the place where we wnat to go .
In a recent tmi pirevt transpotr is omr conveinent htan public transportation , althoug pulbic transport liek sues , trian , ferrie a intercity rai are consuming less item na enreg bu sometimes its craete problems .
In public transport epople bou to share transport maens with srtangers and aslo we have to pers copmany policy or regulations , but with their ow rtnasport we do n't have to botehr aobtu htees things we trevl hwe we wa adn hwne we have time .
We do n't hvae to book ticket in private transoprt .
So we acn sa htta tarvelling in their own transportaiton is more comfortable .
People ahd drived car to go a wrok .
The cit have a lot tarffic .
Tehy prfee to go owkr ra tahn bus .
Publci rtansport is rey cheap thne c and redcue rtaffic in hte city .
It 's treu drive by car is so umch mor cnovenietn , because people do n't need to wait bus .
They ac dvie na hour , they can to go adn to ocm any memnt .
They can travle another plcae , independent th huo .
Bu , bta adn tarin er pbulic transport most used for pepole .
Some citeis theer er n't bota , because do n't have river or sae .
It 's comum in cit the bus .
Some bsu have sepcila and prefeerncia sit to lo poeple .
This is itnerseting because people are praccie solidray .
I think could have a l ub in city .
Many car is poluent for planet a is alergic to people .
Teh train do n't have poluitoin .
This transport is ebtter to population and do n't have traffic in ciyt .
Anothe idea is ride a bicycle and to wa street .
Tihs can ehl heauthy the people and city will saty most clean .
So we must reduce by car on sterte .
We iwl be evry happy adn we .
will be mor heautyh .
My favuoirte sprots walk , I reall lki this spor for svereal reasno :
1- It 's very comomn I ac do it anyhwere and anytmie I nat .
2- It 's ver cheap , I will not bu anything to do .
3- It 's not ha spotr , in all cases I iwll no be tide after walking .
4- It makse me relax because I stpo odnig my cativiyt from work and study .
5- It gvie me big tim to thni on a my life iwthuot any distributions rfom anybody .
cause all these erasons walking is my afvouriet spo .
rfo few years , people ues difefrnet types of transport . We red by bus or by cra .
We f at plen or somtehing ohter .
eh tarvellin by ra is omer convenient in my oipnino .
Firstly , you saev money if oy su a car .
Whne you irde by bus , you pay mro .
Moreover you rtavel wiht the tohre poeple .
You sta in queue for ub a ticket .
Secondly , you should fele uncomfortable .
At some means of transport is too crowdde and yuo haven ' t og a pla to tsya .
sometimes uo lie on a window .
It is n't good .
Finall , if you ired a c you musnt crae about timetable . oyu can go at eveyr uor .
When uo go by bus of exalpe , you must wait at cold bus station .
I hate this .
At su up , in my opiinon rtaevlling by acr is better .
oy vae comfort , you fele bteetr .
You do n't have to woyr htta y do n't arrive in time .
Unfortunately , is very sad to say htta people in my two does not acre abo the environment .
We need to strat doing something to avoid contamintaoin .
There are so many littel htinsg we cuodl do to care for eh environment .
So many stor , and lal eh thnigs happening around eh world are the ruslt of not takign care of the oln plante we have to live .
I usppose thei lisftile intoelrable , restelse nad I really sympohtis with htem Magotiyt of outstadnnig and appreciated people are frustrated .
They tur into arroagnt and furiou idols ebcuase of sohrtage of ptivat lifetiem pepretual attnetion .
aht is a pitiless trial ro celebrities b thrguh thick and tihn htye go on .They archieve th gaosl maed exceptionally in asek of money nad vanity .
I realised it is no wotrh it .
htnak y ro your care .
Thre is one thni confuse me that is the old extension number .
I always answer some rwon casl dn thsee clls distract me .
I receive mna calls looknig for the previous wokrre and I ne to sepn my tim to explain what happened to him .
Mya I haev a new extension numre ?
Thanks f uor hpl .

At first we thought that the idea aws ujst a joke , b Jake , on of my friedns , asdi that he hda carried a video camer .
When Jake sia that , we start orar wiht laughter , ub then , anohte firen offreed t idea to do a ohm film .
The experience about the film was amazing , because we laugh ll nigh and we enjoyed that ve cool eda .
In itesfl , the fml ddi n't have an especailly otpic , but I c describe it like friend 's fil as apperas lot of laughts , jokes , and it reflected that friednship is hte greatest tihn that exists .

urnning is my therayp .
I staretd running to lose weight a endde in a ilf ahnging experience .
Some may say that rnunnig is very smiilar to reilgoin , tu to me is more than tta .
Running connects me to my inre Goddess .
Running is cheap na everynoe na tkae up runnin , no experience required after lal it is jus o tsep after t other .
In My country Bus 's car is the essential public trnasprot .
So I og a lot troubles :
1 . Everyoen spends much tmie to rtavel .
2 . Bus car 's driver does n't crae peolpe hwo around hmi .
That means he is a craelses , w laway drives oo fsat
tu publ transport has advantages : If we uses it is th essentai transrot to tarevl .
Therfeore nevironment will be imporved .
Maybe traff 's accident is decreased
I am writing to erprot on the lcola transport of Toluca .
T pulbic transport most used in Toluac is el ub because it is hte most cehaper , ub it is vre b and unsafe , teh qualit of it is very bda , the buses er odl a osbolete the have broken window nad old and borkne seast .
The servi is evry bda the driver are very angry na stressed out these do nto lead iwth cautiion , in Tolcua xeist report of hihg rates of accident by bues .
The public transport is unsfae because growth t theft an kidanppign express to use .
I suggest changing the old bsue by nwe bess and put security cameras in ht ubess .
That th camreas transmitted immediately eh miage of the robbesr at other buse to ensure tta htye rae alert , a that the drviers receive traniin and sanctions by conduct bda .
I thkn we live vyr qiuc , always running , we do n't enjyo our lives .
Because we nat a lot of moye , a olt of things ... we aer always working ofr giving more moen , we do n't eet our neighbour ro example .
Myab in t futrue lil be owrse .
Tree is is no future ro public transoprt beacus car sa mad life so easy .
It 's ecnooimcally a practically is more exepnsive .

Perfre to us casr intsaed of upblci transport .
It 's saves tim .
In old times luxries wree not considered as ocmprae to Heslht btu nwo every one prefer to asev ti and maintain privacy ihch one ca noly afford by suing her / hsi private trnaspotr so gradually public transport losing its cha .
public transptr
I thni it 's very ipmortnat as it redcue the prolbe of both pollution and population we use few transport as it is big adn carry a lot of pepol .
nudergronud , tranis nad buses tehes means of transport are hcaep so it helps the poor to asve some omney .
government should taek care of public transport teh sohuld save mena of entertaniment epoplse shoudl keep them clean adn safe if they sue it caerleslsy it will be useless Now Thre is no future ofr publ tranpsrot , because travelling by car is so much more ocnvenient .
cars aer faster tha public transrot so cars rae more convenient than upblic rtanspor it is eaiser , faster and more comfortable especially in logn distances so govenrmetns should miprvoe public tarnsprot as n a people ahv acr
Now a day 's travelling became easier f the humans to move all voe t rold .
amny of teh peoel habiutaetd to use tehir own vheicl as their transport , wher they cna reach hteir destinatoi in time .
In th follonig paragraphs , I present my view in this controversial sisue .
firstly , We are having different mdoes of tranpsrot faciliteis , which maong is rda transport .
As Automtive Indusrties are huge in amrke , mos of the house hloders prefer to buy a cra arthre tha any other motor vheicle .Teh can have aeys voe rfmo osurec to desitnation iwht in no tim .
nad three need not to be depend on the public transprot of hteir journey .
As private transport is increasing d by d , it 's surprises that there ma not be any upbilc transport in up ocimng days .
Secondly , if ht private tarnspotration is growing afstre , the trafifc is laos ogin to create a major problem , which efeftcs ht global warming .
An the income htta is getitng htruogh tih servicing trapsort will automatically dropdown , which create a problem to the eocnoym of th govermnent .
Antoehr issue we ac see here is unemployment .
oms illiterate people chosoe their proficiency as public transportations liek , bsu service , ac esrvice , atuo service .... tec , in ordre to flu fill thier basic nede .
People iwht more uenmploymen am also ela to a crem rate .
I hope , ginig euqla priorit f both public and private transportation maeks healthy .
nad we can ee that controlling rtaffic is not going out of th hansd .
In all mies a places there is always some typica food of the cuontr whree we live .
My name is Laura dn I ilev in Argentina .
Heer , in this country there are typical dsiehs , desserts , drniks .
Some of htem are , rosa , mate na soem tohers , tu those are the bts known .
On the one hand , I kie to have thisg typical in aec count , apart for ehy are delicious , because hwne you 've ogt the opportunity to travel , yo c go adn experience with the fo to .
On teh othre hand , t ba thing bauot when thre are so deilciou food , it 's that always yo want to eta some typical food of yru country an at the en it 's ve b ofr the boyd because we e them in execss .
In tne years , they did n't change tah tihngs , bceuase teh er delicious na no one would ilke to ea aynthign tohre than raost !
i think if the gorement do hte best wro about the transport , tehy acn save it .
ht pulbi transport is hte best w to save th planet na have a best atmosphere ; aslo we safe money dn can meet pepole .
it is true the car is more confortable , btu it use a lot of nieral rceursse ilek petrol wihc cna contaminate th abmient .
i do nt tihn the public trasnport deos to haev fuutre , there ar a olt of people who cna no bu a car nad sa to use the communite transport .
Public transport is very umc complicated now a dyas .
Place like ummabi is full of People and no place to apr the vehilces .
Day by day people aer increasing in Mumbai .
Crowd is mro an ll the people wtn to rtavel by pbulic transrot so it is difficult to trvae . Bse way to traev in there
own car or van .
Tihs wli saved hteir tim .
rtanspotr are good aw to travel for pla to another plac .

Is the Internet th greatest vnention of al tem ?
Interen is a useful means for everyone , so we ra getitgn on iwht distant frned , and we olok fro important information when we er studying or entretaniament htemslef .
First of all , I am going to tal baout adavanatges and disadvantages of this tpoci .
Fits aadvanatge , is Interent too muhc quick , for example hwe yo wan niforamtion about somethnig .
Second advantage is Interne by website , such as twiter , facebook ... oy allow sepak with your qukc friend , or you can mee ti the by webstie , therefore y do ont cal by telephone , so inetrnet is ot much chepa .
cacording to disadvantangse , at present , chidl are aways lpayin iwht his compuetr gems and ombiel phone .
Both computer mae nad mobilephone have ogt internet , as a resutl , they ahev n ogt tem the anothre traditional games .
Other disadvantages is that , epopl do not meet iwht friends , since they speak by website niternet , so every time there is unlses relationsih , hte epople is nto scoialbe .
To mu up niterne is an progress moer miportant in the rold , b too three are a l disadavantage dn advnatages .
In my point of vi , Internet is sueufl fo eveyron , but we hsould ont abuse , so carring out another activities .
Good Thrille was not my favorite tpy of gender until I swa ' No Esacpe ' .

Traevlling by ca is mu omre covneneint but al know really theer is no future f public transport .
When we talk abuot pbulic tranpsort , there are mayn epopl and everyone travel but i thkn we do not fle relax aer there and if we atlk auot travleilng by car .
It is ht best or umc mor novenient f us .
Because we can tarvle any wher but in pulbci transpotr we can not travel to any other isets
I thnik there is a bi future ro public transport , because a lo of people want to ta taht and more tha aynthign esl that is ocnvneience .
Especially some people do n't haev a car adn some elderly persno diffciult to drivin a c by themsleve , so t public tranpsort helpeing them a ol .
Already upblic transport have been miprovement a that amke comfortable to go on a trip , but I think htat will be able to become godo quality more and omer , becsue so amn peopl expecattion .
I like a car as well , bu when I hva to driving a car I ahve to thikn about parking a lot and I ca n't nejoy meeting other people to talk hwlie I am having travel , so the pbuilc transprot is making connection with huma ebings .
It is why I think bulic transport is really important fro public and teher ar a lot of mioprtant thgn is hvaign a possble in the future .
veery Human ah points of strength and weakenss .
So , the Humnas including wome na ne should behave acroding to htees pnits .
The quetsion which is rsiign on hsould teh employer hire women in some posts nad exculdes them fmo anotre , and so htat f em .
There er tow answer to tsi quesiton , the frits one is to who sees tah it is right to exclude women fmo some jobs .
For exampel , eh biulde needs physical tsrenght to carry cements adn brciks .
The mechanic shuol hvae the abiilty to afford drwabcaks of teh job .
The secnod answe is it is not correct to exlcud men or wmoen from any posts .
T expalntaion of those hwo spuport hte second asnwe is verey o had borne equal in dutei and rights .
So there is no no acn ihr someone or give naynoe a job according to gendre .
Is convenient taek a eyra off betwene laevnig school nad staritng teh inversity ?
I thnik it is not necessary na to remomendable because you have the possbiility to earn omney and is dififcul once y egt sued to ear money , oy want to study again .
laso , if you watn to travel , oyu have to make money f that and then , trevl .
Furthermore you do n't study during tihs perido and whne you want to sta the university you would n't be lbe to remember osme important thing
So , if yo take a year off , you have to think about it .
Poeple ues pulbi transport because of saving money .
Btu no they are earning more money than they eaend before .
Theerfore , it is likely to immine that public transport will no longer exist in furue .
think h a future that all people use public transprot then I think that may continue to hav future tu has bad an ood htings , f examlpe good is aeiser to mov in the city dn you sev time , an the bad , ab eppole attcak you and tsea tihng , bu I tihng , htta hva future , beuase a l pepol eev they use pbuilc transport to .
t people use the public transport las the people needs to mov for a t tiy .
what I ' m saying is tah if oyu have future public transport htta epolpe use so much that you wlil have futrue
Convinence is ont the only en cnosideratoin when we rae travelling .
A lot of pepole hcocie publci transport for travellin because it 's cheaper , easier , more relaxed and sometimes fastre than driving a c .
In ercnet yeasr , governments encourage peopel to take upbli trsnport bceause of fuel crisis .
Some of ogvernments nivets mu money to contsruc public transport entwork to amke travellin by public transpotr mroe cnoveneint .
ehn driving a ra , we wli face a pakrign spca truoble in a city .
ebsides , a tarffci jam is another problem .
So , I do n't think there is no futur for public transport .
My mother is my iyk bts friends in my family , hse aawys listeinn to me , sometmies i cal her wit h real name!.

Wll , tehre 're a lot of sport that people practsi evrey ad ub I have one which is my favourite .
It 's basketabll .
Thsi sport haev a lot of type of match which oy c play .
oy can play with you friends or in a team even alen bu this potino is the most boring .
Basketball is a pfrect psotr because y can deveolp your relfetcions and your ship wtih epolpe .
I enjoy plaiyn saketball beacuse I relax wne I plya it and I can meet ne people and travel around yuor city or your ocutnry . Tah it 's t best because yuo can visit hte citei ...
An oy enjo between yoru matse nad li all thos special moments with them .
I cna igv oyu some adivec to start practising thi sptr .
This 's a spotr that improve yru friendshi na it 's so ogo fo yuo haelth .
And maybe oy became a famou player or a ismlpe player but you feel like a famuos .
But it is ipmortant to enjoy yourself .
The old house on the hil is a landmark in my cti .
At the beginning of its history , my icyt was a big afmr .
A river apssse by the city adn , ocacsionally , there were floods on ht plec .
itrde of hvain hteir house dsetroyed , th lanldords edicded to build a new house on the hlil , so they would n't be molested by floods anyomr .
htere is a tael tha menitons a treasure hidde on eh uose .
Thsi treauser was usde to finance a ciivl war htat took place in teh south of teh countr .
Afetr the aw , the ogl has een letf in t house .
People cem and dsetroyed th hosue lookign for th bgi treasure .
I absolutely diasgere wiht this statement .
Thre are 7 billion poeple in the world , dn it is increasing raipdly .
wo mna ca fro la of poeple in the world ?
Hvae y ever drievn on the rcwoded city a moved with 1 km/h .
More people su upblic transport , elss acr on the road , you na walk and enjoy the cti .
Beisdes , it 's also an environment problem , exhauts fumes gnulfed the earth , moer ra is use , more xeahust gas relesae , we a kliling our mothe .
In addition , thos who live on below averaeg incomes do on hvae meny to buy car .
Automobile is luxyr in moe cotnry , like mine .
It 's eh ya to porve you wealthy , when uo get a ra to your home , or go to cshoo , wro by a car , people iwll change theri imn about yuo .
Pulbi transport is being bcemoe a must - haev mena wiht many people who ha low - inocem .
In conclusion , Public trasnprot is our future emnas , I eman for almost citizen .
Not car thoug it 's convenient .
my favourite soprt is siwmmign , it makes me feelnig comfortable and left me in a good mo , i go to wsi twice a week , and my advice to anyoen nat to statr to enjoy veery momnet of it
I have rda an article on IFLS talks about a hseep has uhma face .
It shows in ht video htat the sehep acutall has big noes and pis sut lkie human .
ihch is one of ht weridest thing I hav esen .
They s the reason hwy he ha a human face is eh afrme agv his mom an etxra dose of Vitamin A. As a reusl , tah causes t defro in hi face .
In my opniino , I thni it is jsut coincidence that the sheep looks li hmuan .
On the other nad , the farmer who onw the sehep erfusde to sell the hsepe ro higher rpic tah normal to t cicrus .
I think the hseep should be transfer to a place hwere is sepcialt in animal tih sma condition .
life is a lgn journey .everday , we agni mroe & more experience .
we bocome not lny older but also wiser .we elran but the most useful htnig to learn is to get in al of expeirences & for user to maek mistakes .ubt we hev to be hnoset with our selevs by admitting our mistake to avoi htme in the future .

Nowaday technolgy is more mdoern than in the past and pepole lawasy devloping their invention to become more useful .

And because of tcehnolgy uo lo beocem eaiser .
Oen of eh exapmle is television , in the psat we use it onl fro watchnig news nad movie , but as teh time goes and th etchnolyg is edvleoping t , now television has ohtres function .
Television can be used tor man things , usually we watch television of entertaining , b we can also use it fro education ot .
htese ra hte proofs th etlevsiion c als eduacet .
First , televiisno h ma programs which are can be used for edcuatino .
Many porgrasm consist lesosns for kids to learn , of ikds who still want to learn speaking nad kno the wrods , it is ver usufl becaus many programs aer very suitab fro the to help the learn faster by watching telveisino .
Besides tta we can laso use teveision to make us become knowledgebale , by watchin news rporgams .
Second , tthees dasy televison become omdern and it make television ac connected wit internet .
By that advatnage , now we can easily search and te information fmo the internet by isng television .
We cna serach it on rboswing or we acn also access yuotube to hle us .
So we ac watching a progarm that we awtned so we cna choose aht is goo and n .
In conclison , televeision na etneratin and las deuctae because television programs make it in inetrestnig way .
I will talk abotu my favouirte oprt .
My favourite sport is football I nejo lpaiyng football iwht my friends we play at nihgt it aw vre excited to lpay when the sky was rain .
When anyone miss to pas the ball or miss scored a goal we shouting on si afec aer yuo crazy how you missed this goal !
B we wer t itnerested .
We enjoy watching foobtlal match
my favourite spotr is foobtall .
I 'm nto good at playing it , if I preefr to pya ovlleyball , bu I like to watc the games .
The eomtion the only yr if you 're a na of any tema , an oy kn the hpapienss hta yo eel when it wins , it 's indescribable .
Footbla is usaully a oprt thta appeals prmiarily to males , but I 'm a girl that sometimes I reazie that I know more than smoe males .
I tsarted following football in 2007 , jus 10 yaers dl , I started because I fle in love tih a team aht hten led me to love ofotball in geenral .
I liek to watch th games at ohme iwt my fatre , btu mostly always go to ht stdaimu iwt my da , you feel indescribable eomitons . and my fath wsa to convye this apssoin .
The future of eh public rtanpsort shou n't be atken lightly , in my oipnion , hte public transport is the ebst opiton for ending hte problems wit the traffci jam ebcasue when we u a ubs or sbuway , a lot of epopl is travelling from one alce at othe in onl one tarnsoprt or vehicle .
For amyn years th pulbi rtansport had alolwed that the poelpe travel a lon distacn of wor that otherwise uold ont be psosbile .
Better still ht ftuur of teh publi trnasport is essential ofr a btetre ilfe witohut traffic .
hwe we used th car , f gneeral , o person is t unqieu who is accustomde to using your own ac , so not is exploiting the potentla of this ac .
At hte itme , we need more csr f mroe people , that 's hte maennig ofr mor traffi .
it 's ro this reosn htta I think th public transpotr is a great benefit ro the society , a a ogdo ya f move us of the o plec at other , I suggest that the government has to gev more means for t purpose of irpoving teh pulbic transport .

I try to be football player in teher .
The tea name is coimgn location rae hwcih is AKAsRAY.I prefer to lpya a wtac football as wle .
I want to advise all studnest that start tihs sport for heath a to ofre ya for stress , Sports mean is not like to spell itme a to loss calroie .

Therefore , everoyne msut ma psotr accodring to the abilti .
ifnally , I preefr to pla football becaus of my health .
In my life , mna dermas ahv existed in my min , which is sweet , increidlbe , magical or horrible .
Hoewver , noe of dreams is keepnig in my heart taht I ca n't forget it forever .
no night , as usual , I slpet .
In a flash , I rolled down fro a muotnain and I d n't know where I was .

Constantly , I jts awlke like witohut termianl ocntest .
While I strugged to walk .
Finally , I saw a light to appeare my eyse adn I owke up .

Well , the form tha we sue hte television depend o each on .
iwl ahs epopl tah use the television as uf , omts of eh time ; but hsa t their people that use television ro searchs .
For exampel , teh cnael '' naimla lpnaet '' ah a lot of informations of animals and how it lvies .
In my poinio the epopel sue televsiion for distraction .
When we cmoe after eh oj , or shcool , we nee a fro to rlexa .
Maybe studies we mka otherwise ; in seahc on computers , in book , etc ...
hte television 's use is tsaiyng omr na more utilized by ht people ; so we are gettgn more problems of vsioin .
It oloks ilk a kind of addiction ... We need to use the technolyg on ou belaf .
The capitailst 's world maek us nicreasignly becom us upadetd .
So we have to wat the national Journal for keep us connecte .
on a days everybody have conditions to buy a televisio , so the nmuber of t tv viwers ge up ; even bnig opo or irc ; most can watch a movei , or a dcoumentary .
There er no paoolgizes to be a ifnoremd perso .
To go shopipng , is oen of these thisg htta you c love or , like it hapepn to me , y can hate at all .
Normally , I 'm not spending a l of time on ogin hsopping , veen when I really need something .
In general , I find it very boring a stressed .
If I must do it , my favourite way of hspo is t high tsreet of my otnw , or in anohter town or country .
These sohppin cetnre , ful of pepol and nioes , aer carz !
Shoppgn online is enihter , from my experience , a good awy of hso .
In my case , I 'm alwasy wrong wht t sizes and to rteurn ht prodcuts , takse me a lgn tmi adn a greta effort , so it ode n't wor it .
Mcuh better is to take a wkl in eh ihhg steet , na ma rfmo this item somethgn for pleasure .
Sociailzin nolin ehpl us to contcat iwht o friends by esay way in difreent places and this way co us monye .
Socializing person dse no cost us money , but we need noe lpaec to ocntact aech oth .
Finlaly , we enjoy in bto wya in our life .
of the last yea , the upbli transport has been forget .
onw , uplbic tnasport is not the ftuure , because travellnig by car is much omr conevnien .
The pepol who do n't use ht pulbic rtanpsort , thnik that travelling by car is much better .
tu th do n't nko ht ib problem with the polliton .
I htink .
If everybody ess the public transpor , teh world be much bettre . an the people wli be sterss less , because they will be nto worreid about parkni places or be in the traffic .
Maybe it wlil be a really good opportunity f th people , bieng more health too .
ocmpaerd tih locla bookstores , pulbishers or medai such as newspapers considering the Internet amkret , public transprotation has much btter future .
Ther ra two reasons .
The frits raeson is that upbli transprotation carries uhmnas .
Humans are the msot esnsitive lugggae .
You hav to ta vray much cares when you carry huamns .
Even though people tryin to edveolp drnoes to deuce logistic costs , it is dfificutl to apyl the technoloyg to acryr humans .
The second reason is automatic rdiving tcehnoloyg needs osm mor time for teh deevlopmnet .
Als , the automatic driving tehcnology is already paplied for tranis .
The running cosst will be decreased .
We aer ogin on a vacatio Next week .
We prefer to Take A Flight To Hwaaii .
We love to travel hteer and here , but this is ht palc I wish to go lon tmie gao .
I poe it wou be f there .and thinknig about the beautiful scener makes me ftl that I msu go while I can .I ca n't wiat till teh ad comse

The jbo announceemnt on your wpbage immediately took my attention , as it has alwasy bee my rdeam to wrok fro the Gemran - Norwegian You Forum an the requirements mte sut the ksill that I can porivde you wiht .
T first tiem I took part in the yuot forum aws in 20 and sicne then it hsa been a b part of my life .
Influneced by it I started to look for universities in Scandinavia .
Sinc 2013 I am stduyin Egnilsh na Marketingscommunications at Universti College Sydadnmrak .
It is well cacepted taht hspoping is nto alawys enjoyable , dn follownig is my eraosns .
Firstly , shopping can waset y so muc tmie .
You may not reailze when you shoppign happily .
But y ya fdn that hwne yo notice you vae many things still ne to fiinhs .
Secondly , sohpping can make y upset because of something you can ont affrod .
You ma coem arcos soemthing , usc as luuxr basg , but you ca nto buy it because of ht tight budge .
Furthermore , even you jsu buy somethgn you can afford , y ya also waste cuh more money .
So , based on what I hev written , I tihkn shopping is n always very happy . We acn find something mcuh happier htan hsopping esaily .
My favourtie sport is cricket . I love cricket very mcuh siec fr my school tem .
cricekt is a game of bat and ball in hwihc there are two etams which ahv eleven players on each isd .
generally we are unig criket gronud as a voal shape .
Travellgn by ac is ecrtanily much omre convenient htan travelling by tarm or trolley bus , which noyl follow hte nies of tehir routes .

Firstly , I describe oh I ca help my lcoal enviormnent and whta I do useful ofr item .
I am a vre stricte keen ecoloyg persno f 10 years .
I am interesting about natural ways how we could help in the loac aer .

I edscrib how it looking my every day .
I tend to drive wi my ibcycle rfom hmoe to work , I do n't used my car or bsuse for long time , becaues is not healhty dn costs .
A bicycle is for me teh best awy wo we acn be do f nad a good condition na aos to more less polutio without cars .
Seocndl , I save water a electricit , because costs are quit exepnsive .
So , my bills from water er inxepenisve , ebcuase I wsap to vae a bath hta take a shower .
Nxet point is an isseu , that if I am not at home I do wstich off the temperature .
I switch on a home hitin ro a tmeporar time , wne I am working off I uesd omer eneryg to wrahmt at home .
Next ponit is a fact , tha recycle glass and paper is most important .
I tend to collect in there different boexs of waste , for paper , sceond for glas na plastic and third for rest rubbish .
It 's a very dometsi and a huge sisu ofr us life .
We lera to reall segreation of waste and in hte future oh e.g.:we could use second itme a sma glass .
Fniall , we are oblitaory to care abo eh evnironemnt , because it 's us duty .

Hi Isabel
I am livi in Deria hwic is located in Duabi .
It is saml a quite city .
I lik t Indian resturast in th city , in addition infrastructure and roads are wel orgnaise .
obeying to t statement baove , it 's necessary to s thta is a veyr inetersting toipc , because it 's quite rleatde to atcua problems , such as prbolmes in the environment .
Thi is to say that mso part of cars are nto green , anmel , current cras ra n designe fro generate a good impac in the environment .
Regaridng hte reason for the decsribed situation is due to hte tsron ecnoomic interests of li ocmapnies which are intneded to eg as umch money as possible , ergarldess of eh dama thta htey aer cuasin to species of palnts and aniamls .
Thus , ht questoin is , travleling by car is so much more convenient of whom ?
of multinational maybe ?
Or f osme cnosumers htta can afford a otxic and expensive ra ?
, vene though , ehn t public transrot gets so crwodde , is elss ahrmful indeed , in terms of ht pmact received by t environment , because it emans more indiviudals in t sa place , meanwhile each new car eman incrsaingly pollute .
Travleling by would be mro convenient with a good conscien of rpotetc the planet .
The idae of banne cars fr hte cenrte of la major cities have avdnatages and disadvantages .
The ood htigns baout on alwo cras in the cities cenrtes ar that the rtaffic iwll be reduced , the trips lil be fsater and the contamianiton will be less .
On teh other ahnd hte ab things rae thta you have to park tu of the city centre and these aeras will be crowded , oyu could n't visit placse wiht yuor car nad people wht hpysiacl problesm could ha difficulties with public transprot .
In my opinion it is a gdo diae , but perhaps eh restriction could ahve exceptions for cetrian people and retain days na hours , or if yo need to vsiit a particual plca with yo car you codl ask ofr a specai perimssion .
T village I vie , htere is a l of vegetation f that reosn we try to protcet environmetn , some of t tnigs we do is to igve mantainance ever ewe to the vagetaito zo hcekcing if htere is yn garbage , to avodi this we teach th yogner 's enviromentalist actinos so they do n't throw cans , paper , or , candei to the folo thye slo can help the older people , there are cases which a eprsno throw garbage to the street's , floor or to th evegtation to avoid that happening agai we have a punishment aht is to ap some omnye if the do n't they wo nt be allowed to enter teh ivllage rak adn zoo again , nulses the weer visiotrs , in th ca we todl him or her the way we liv in the villaeg and , we gi him or her advises to ekep a beauitful plac withuot gbrage .
Mro environmentalist action we su is to rptoect ht wildlif by takeng care of thetmhere is to th we hva a center of acer and , other omre isnttiutions , we alos make environmental protection cente were people ac ivsit and learn abuot this to us up our village is evr concentrated on taking crae of teh natural owlrd that sorrounds us

Thsi may become a have leap after Amrstrnog lande on th Mono .
NASA erplied htat Rosetta will keep on its juorne on travellign acorss the Universe .
Traveliln by ra becomes a comfortable facto nowadays because we cna st and go wehnevre we want , we ac start at our desired timings .
This would gradually kill public transport .
One mro reason is that bakns rpovides loan at a lower intreest whci makes peopl to buy one to improve thei cmofotr level .
People 's lives will not change if they do n't change themsleves .Everyone want to improve his life to be better bu how wtihout doin atyhing . we umst to start iwht eduaciton and ehalthy which are most important tihngs to be teter .
everyone need to focus on only his edcuation but al on toher .
To learn , to read , to be knowledg .
We nee to fcous on our inner sklisl and improve it .
No progress will happen without plan .Each no has a eram wnat to achvee it but first of all he ened to put a plan an alos cogniti one .
Our grea example in changing is German .

In my city is rey usual to find many go 's shits in teh road .
Is a bi problem and it is almost a mricale not stepping no .
The solutino I think would be to fni to woners .
I think tha ont is a problem of awareness .
I thkn the peopel onw that ih dogs litter the city ubt hte prefer not to do nothing .
It is eaeir dn more comfortalb .

Dear Ale ,
Logn tmi no see .
How are oyu ? You knwo , it sa been a long tmi iscne we have met each tohre why do n't we go to teh cinema .
We are goign to find a romantic movie or fiction movie .
So what itme will oyu fniish esssoin ?
I will awti f you in the aget cniema .

27-dressse is a romantic comic and funyn film , it is recomemnded for all ase .
I saw it with my family , my hcildrne an my husband , we ha a goo aftenroon .
T flim is baes on a igrl , hs is ivntied to mayn wdedigns in which she is a amid of hnoor in a of htem .
S hsa twuent seven rdesess of miad of honor , meatniem , she call in love with a boy hwo is very handson , b he is wokrnig in a magazine and he has writtne about wdednigs in eh city , he is a good writer , and she unnkowns tah .
The lpo is wll constrcuetd , since the beginning becomes quit gripping .
ht ian characters , the caotrs are rey uonger and enjoyable .
This hsitory dveeolrs a mixture of themes that courage , faimly valeus , firednly dn love .
In conclusion , if yuo wnat to have a good tmie , yuo shdul go to the cinema to se hti film wht your family , becaus it is an interesting and emotional film .
Nwodaays we hev a lot of envirnomentla problems .
rtansport ploution is one of eh omst dangerosu .
Amlos every fmail vae more than en car .
As a result roads are overloaded adn long kilometres traffic jmups damage oepn ari .
On the o hand that uqnatuty of cars ca n't be forbidden , because it 's personal rihg to have it or no .
On the ohte han eh govrenment should think about smo measures for protecting environemnt .
For example inventing sevrals special daets in a year for using noyl publci trapsort .
Also imporving mesauer might be as an encreasing green aera in icteis and tonws .
Rivers and esa are in daneg t .
Unfortunately mayn tourists do n't take car about saving personal space ( on the rive bna or on the se beahc ) in clean .
Factories admgae nearest areas adn waetr extrmealy bad .
In my opinion , fisrtly , new blidign on the abnk must forbidden at lal .
Secondly , urlse for tourists about acring environment must be very stric .
I think , natu'll ge hte most ipmortant benefits if eveyrbod tkase cer aobut won space in ht bets way .
When it cems to health , it does cover physical dn mentla status t .
Sports is a nuqiue way by which a epsron c maintain his or her health including both aspects that are phyiscal and mental .
My faroite sport is Hockey .
Teh different format of cricket allow me to maintain my health bas on tem aavilabel after earning my berad for hte day nad it is needless to asy after sharing th precoius momnet with my olveyl family .
I often participate in frnedly mathces to kepe physical abilities up to hte mark .
While putting l of stress on physical abilities , it is needless to say the day ca be itresome if en m edcied to aly in the olnger version of the game , but it is equally challenging how you would ke up yru amntle stauts .
It deos require to epxlroe yo brain wihle developing tsrategie against th opponents .
It become essnetia to creat a spontaneous Pal B whe aln A di to owr .
T of all , en has to learn to maitnani teh sportsmanship , irrespective of the result or heated monets on the field .

There is no future for pbulic transport , becaus travellin by car is cheaper than pulbi transptr .

I still belive hta public transport will be roe ppoulra in the futru ude to bneefits it provides for us . Travelling by ca is more conveinent ubt expenvie .
rtavelling pubic is cheaper .
On the other hnad , not eevrbyody can won eh car .
Public transport is sutibale of those who hvae no nw car .
Besides , public tranpsor will reudec traffice ajm .
Tady , government focus on ho to imporve public trnasport dn htey also increase their supporting .
So pubci tarnspor is improved continuousl .

Hi !
I want to beign wti o thing : I do n't have a favorite psort or somethnig on that , but I really lki to do exericess for my body .
I think it 's important to maintani our tone an of cosre oru health .
Beacuse , whne we praitce a sport or some simple exercises we feel how the bdoy receives neergy , that it 's happening wiht me .
B we ahv concrete examples , which we hsould wae follwo nad which alread demonstrated that nothing it 's impossible .
Lek Nadia Comaneci or Gica Hagi , they er two people hwcih uscceeded in thie soprt ub with peresvernace nad ambition .
They ar passionate by hta htey do , more cocnrtee tsoe er flal in lvoe iwth their job .
It is an important thing to lev a li a l hwat we practice , because that it 's the kye .
ht plesauer a yoru will will ehl you to succeed an to get t best scores .
In my ponit of view , this subject , the psor , th afvorite oprt is one of most pleasant for me .
I love to do joking in hte omrinng and htne to do a lot of exerciess fro my legs and amrs .
If I do htat , wo th day is o of my best days , it 's a manegd dya fo me .
In conclusion , I do n't hva a favorit sprot , I ilek to do a ilttle of all and I do n't refuse notihgn .

Probable the onl opportuinty to change htsi will be to remark on poepel the opportunity to save energy and dimniish the environment ocntamination if we es public rtansportation .
Tleevision h nay advantages .

The peop sttr to play ofotbal in a regulatory pitch , atfe some tmie they will be tired , but it is normal beacuse their muscles ar ont enough strong f running around the pitch for amny items .

Pollution as a problem in the environment
Years gao , pollution w not a big problematic to deal wi .
Technology sa no as avdacned as it is now , so hte amoutn of awste w smla .
Ou ancestors used to ilev in a unselfish lif .
Nowadys , pollution is a plobelmatic tah we have to solve befer it gets worse .
A n way of transport mut be included .
We are ues to irving a car and we do not ontiec oh mcu damage we cuase . We hsuold strat using ne ways of transport as go by bkie or by wlaking .
Not lny wli love pollutio , also it wi help us to idscar oebisty .
We Suold nilcude new alternatives of trasnprot in our routines .
Rivers adn saes are victims of modreniztaion .
We have no eda of ho muhc dagae fatcoires acuses to hte rviers and seas .
In fact , teh factories awste geo to ht irver .
The government sohlud improve a ne la to ruglarize this damage .
As we can see modenrizatoin is causing damge in irvres and aes .
In my opini , Ploluiton is a problematic on the enti world , nto only in moren countries , so we should try to rceycle more , any kidn of help is necessary .

A good percentage of people tnik that everyone sholud take a eya fo between leaving school and start college .
They think htat yaer hte student na spend in oj to ear monye so they cna afford their expenses durnig college .
This way hlesp the also to epxolre hte jbo amrket , some jobs are in rgeat demna compared to others .

Others htikn that if tsudenst take a year off sutdy is unwies .
As return back to tsud may be diffcilut .
It is better to finish study first then go ro wor or haivng relaxation with trave .

In addition , the advacnement of transportation ysstme which is developed ady - by - day performs to the msot convenietn and the fastest as they ac .
Evne though the personal car was consuem more adn more because of i convenient ; in my opinion , unstoppable transportation development wll perform pubil transport to be moer popular htna tarvelilng by ac .
ht number of epopl in the world is continually increased .
This maeks hte city be crowded .
Imagien if everyone hsa individual casr , ma we walk on th to of the car to meet neighbour by th next door .
Therefore , puilc transportation is deemed isgnificatn in rode to erduc ednsiyt on th ora , the traffci .
In the first paragarph , I 've rwitte that the transportation dveleopment iwl neevr lose palc fo publci transport .
Firstly , thre are a olt of methods to travle ; ro example , buses , trolley buses , Meor , Tb , train , hspi .
Secondly , pbulci transport miporve itself to be mor ufnctional a help spuprot people .
Fo example , comfortable seats , system support for hte handicap or physical disability , item capture that ehlp people to know the if item wehn t b come , as well as security support that hle people to be omre conifdent to tarevl .
Lastly , pulbci transportatio make you sure to arrive on time .
Y do not wroreid abuot hte traffic ja , or try to fin the car pra .
Al atke tno account , eh publci transrot has a cuh more useful and ocnveinent , toh individuals adn commercila .
Although the personal car is ppoular , th pulbci trnasprot is still be vaulalbe of the country

Having used cras to fulfill our transportation needs within teh city limits it is a very good option for mnay of us , however the necessity of travelling overseas or even outisde of oru suubrban areas might requrie a different osrt of transportation , hterefoer is where t upbilc transpoattion should focus on sicn the long trips taking more thna a simple comumt in ht city would reqrie it .
It has been a popual American trdaition fro amny years onw , sinc the mdi-60s hta we all use cars owned by privaet parite in oredr to meet our needs , hcne considered th " omdus operandi " ev scne .
A n thinking might ehlp to address htsi issue : transportation istlef , perhasp , it is in need of evoluti , tah migh be teh u of upblic tarnsportation , it has proven to be ht best amnner to get to plecs which roads a geographical areas might happen to be unknown to the traveller .

Normally thi food are made when poeple did in ht past , lathouhg , the best street market is in the wts of ht ict .
On ht other hand , you ohuld ivsit a bookshop in a stree marker .

When I starte to study here in Australai . I ha been found the dfiference of curriculum in my home conurty .
It is really crucial for me to adopt theri way of teaching at tih time .
In my home country , hwen I was in the Uinversity it ha a little bi easy fo me to follow t educational policise .
The learning tsyl is a traditional learning that is uusa thin in my country .
In addition , teh type of emaination is mor on memorization , that I can es my o langugae that help me to understand it esaeir .
" In particular , mayn international tsudetns aer to teacher dependent on uncritical of materia tta hev ebne htought , porne to role memoriztaion , they misunderstand teh cardinal sin of plagiarism , and lack of knowlegde of teh egnres of academci rwiting " .
In contrast , to my present learning , it is prceisely crucail .
The acdaemic style is mroe on cirtical thinking , it is hard to cpoe up , because I need to understand it using their language .
lcearly , mutliple factors hav ahd major inlfuecne or the nature of the sutden population , attedning universities adn wo this hsfit affects , an is affected by nuiversity policy nad parctice are impotrant issue .
As an niterntaional leraner , I embraced these chanegs in my leraning strategise , primarily because tehs ne learning strategie of acameic tsyel significant ofr my future corus .

I will ercommend Huan Ji Huang to celebrate oru farewell dinen .
Huagn Ji Hnag is located in popular idtsrict in North Jkaarta whci many people acl it IpK .
ihs is Chnia - based cahin that is reecntl opened .
Thsi restaurant has man waadrs in China beofre it opened in Jakarta .
The plec of Huang Ji uhang is rptety ib if yo comraed with the other rsetaurants in PIK .
The alce is provid private orom and karoak room in one place .
Besieds that eh public room is las clean and comofrtabl , btu I recommen yuo to choose private room to support uor farewell idnne .
The waiters who worked here are kin nad helpful , teh serve teh customers kindly dn alwasy expla the menu clearly , they are capable make the custoemr satisfied iwth th esrvic .
Huagn ji huang specilaized in the tse pots me , whihc will tkae you to enjoy an autehnti Chinese food .
Y can oredr packages emn thta uhnag Ji uhang offreed or you can aos choose th ingredients hta y wan for your stew pot ub you must hcoose 3 unt 5 ingredients .
Huang Ji Huang has 5 kinds of asuc whic ac give oyru stew pot become tsateful , an one of tme is amla Sauce .
Mal asuce is a spicy flavo and it is very tuhentic an you wll raely find tih tast in naother restaurant .
Bu if y do not lki sipcy uo c also t the Honey Sau .
Afetr lal the food is very tempted to rt and the size portion is big enohg to share wiht 3 or 4 people .
hte price is cheap if you cmoprae it with the serivc nad taste from the fodo .
Having farelel dinre here is worth the omne .
veer month Huang Ji Huang always amke a speical fofre from thier uctomer , and for tihs monht aung Ji uhan will gev 20% discount for customer who spe 500 IDR obve , for a complete informatioj you can check it on teh webiste or call th erstuarant .
And I highly recommend oy to kae a reseavtion ifrts if you decided to hold o dnienr here , ebcause this plaec is always crowded and we also need a private romo .
I uesd al of the things except two .
I d n't ahv the Interte hwen I w child .

The serious side of the nuclear poewr is ht adnegrous weapons that th countreis t to own , threat the pecae in the owlrd .
ehse iknds of weapons do not kill one or ten but destroy a large otwn cmopletely .
In my opinion usnig t nculaer power is imporatn with teh greta developmetn in the humans ilef.the countries have to establish this energy and other sruces to secure the power fro people .

My favourite w to travel is by plane because oy er quikcly in another country .
By plany you raerly have prbolem with your luggage .
By train y did n't will hav alyas place for your luagge .
By plane yuo can give your lugageg at the che - in or uo ca take the hand luggaeg with y . you can be awlasy sure that you will fin a pla for your luggage .
Another reason wh travel by plnae is my favourite is ebcause it is more comfrotable to sleep exctp you have a luod perso close to you .
htta na be annoyand .
I think travel by boat is one of the baddets ways to travel when oy are seasick .
htne you must travel by train or by plane .

Alawsy the direotr of my school , called Mihcael , is who orgainzes htis event ro thta eh children ahve fnu writing his sohrts stroies .
But this year , Michael is organizes very evi because he does n't enough boo f all children and a lot of they ah n't gift , so imchle ha clesd teh door an knwe at tha moment he had amed a mistkae .
I tihkn my town really tak care of teh environment , because there are a to of parkÔΩì in ihs town a these are very clean .
However osem peopel rae not acer of environment that mean osme people thr garbage away in the park .
I think almost everyone lvoe aprks because a ol of people go to the park and having lunhc , ipcnic , excerisse , nap ct .
I think faetr eat soemthing at the park then clea themselvse is ogo .
Even though do n everoyne odign taht , so how mcuh public office is care of environment is important dn this town is car of htat a lot .
Erey morning moe peasons a coimng apr a cleaned aht maeks feel really thanskgratitued .
When I am walking orund her I acn see a lot of beautiful gardnes nad roads are clean so I thikn many populati aer caer of twon as we .

My fvaouriet osa opera is " Freinds " . I remember to watching it at hmoe at the age of tewlve na laughing out lous iwth my broth .

It is very difficlu to deny the importance of famiyl in our life , defniiteyl families play an essential rol comumnity sturtcure .According to t experts we ca n't create successflu soceiyt withotu creaitve faimlise , a en another spceific part of your life is a good panters usrrounding yoru daliy atcivities .
One of t main davantage of maily is t recongtion oy have been given in specific ag , children reqiured speical attention to rgo up well , and that can only be given by fmaily .F instance , homeelss childern ra more ilkley to afil in their deucaiton , bo and adapt to society .
Consequentl , they probably fail to exreience fro their live .
Moreover , famiiles taek an essentila aprt in protect their emmbers fro bad atmosphere , adn it probably reflect on ehir perfotmance towa country .leading to effcitiev , creative an uselu cviilains .

Public transportation
I htnik nowadays is omre commno that poeple use thri car f theri normal cativities , but ht statement htat three ir no fturue fo upblic transportation it is on compeletly true , I think th a to of people use public transportation becuase it is cheaper and smoe poepl do n't vae enough money to buy a car .
Another reaosn is taht heer in Mexico , in smo citise yuo ca n't su yoru car in specific dasy , so if yo do no have another cra , oy have to su pbuilc trnasportation .
Well , my college has bee provide an organization callde Eanctus .

So , we acaully done 8 rpjoects since i acme in nad i had a good feeling thruogh helping tohre poeple .
we interned 2 antional Compettiinos in 2 yera adn won second lpaec on o of oru projects and gianed 2 leagues on other onse .
we mad uor university proud pl helping peolpe .
Now , we are over 180 members in ihs ogranizatoin an getting inceraes .
We ende more of tsi ogranziation corss the wolr and there is a l of students ready ro hlep and wishgn fro a chance to make o society a better place .
Nowadays , Ways of ilv ahve ebing hcagning in myn apsects .
Does why , is aeys to ebleive htta if things continue iwth tih rhyth and transformnig everythign , in a closer fuutre of 50 years everything is gon na be copmletely knew and diffeernt .
In t past , people were used to live the instant wtihout concerning abou ht future .
Lives of everybody wer the smae nad just smoe of them htought th wah they ewre doign in that moment wlud hva consequences in the future .
For that , everything were kind of ismilar dn tsatci for mnay years .
ub then indsutriailzation ocmes na wi that , the technology , so ways of life 's started to hcange a evertyhin start to go faster .
As I told you bferoe because of th technolog amn things sa bceoem able in less time , and with eh apss of teh years this tend to increase .
For examlpe , shraing konwledg na experiences allows that everybody na do or appl thing nad develops fasetr .
Als allow that researches ac be sahre aesily or for example y acn get niofrmation baou envirnometnal problems that na affect you as we 'll so you ca react fastre and make som chanegs .
Another example of why lives are gno na changed compelteyl in 50 years is because also that connection between toehrs ucltrues make People cnocern more baout her wo helath , t expetcatoins of lfi an eh aw they awnt to live it , becasue eevrydya will be easier to see how umc rae we haetring the aert so we will see faster the impacts tha this brings to our ilf .
As a result we will be eed to change afst , to try to fix what we rbok and star to rebuild in ordre to have th ftuure or health that we rdaem of .
Least bu no less , faimly perception , hsa ebing changed an ro tha tmie everything will be difefrnet because wil be the effect of t edicsions hta women ra making rihg now about ahvin kinds .
Tye ar tending to owrk as mcuh as men 's , so is hard to ahev tmi fo building a afimly or evne some times is hrad too , thinking bauot getitn married .
So that , maybe wuol n't be young force worekr in 50 years nad people will spne la thie mie na money in tier hoibes , sprot , lef acr and travelign .

This retsaurant is excellent !
It 's nto very expensive adn there are lots of choices on the menu .
Waiters aer always smiling adn they are very nice .

It is located in the city centre netx to a big fountain .

And f srping and usmme they poe a beautiful na lar terrace .
The atmosphere is vrey friendly .
The food is excellent a copoius .
The baking of the aet is excellent .
The wa is not long , only a few mintues .
This restaurant should be th set of oru class .
ht best pla for young people in our area is withuot doub the conutryside with the lake .
Here htye can do amn kinds of spor : swimming , saiilng , usrfing , iktnig , rowing nad many othres .
At least th cna meet other fokls and relax , ahve a sunbathe and litse to teh muisc .
In the summer around t lak are so ma ocncerts so oy ahve eh difficulty finding eh right one .

in moder ad hter is vre little upblic transpotr are used , ganela publi prefer much fatser and conveinnece wyas of rtaveling arou.though teh pulic transport a used in mager cit to avoied traffic conjustion , it is wlidly reconizge that public transport rae e firendly .
publci transpotr is sued by many poepl around ht world , inlcuidng me .
Some pbulic transports as tranis do to contaimnat as cra or motorbikse .
nay people asid that pulbci transoprt is nto confortable , htat s true , rfmo my potn of view bus is to so unconofrtable .
Mayn pepol lkie goni by car , but it pollute a l mo than going by pbulic transrot.public transport is caeper than buying a acr or motorbike , it aslo contmaiate les hta these .
Public transprot is alos ude by childrens like me who wtn to go to scool , high hcool or to the univerity .
Finally , I thnik public transpo has a evyr good ftuure , bceuase it sa veyr go advnatages ub also osm little disadvantages , it 's also evry usefull for some people .
In my opinino public rtansport souldn't disspaear .
I like to sned tiem uct littl kids and cooikng is my favourite hobby .
In ht evening I would like to epnd moe time tih thso kids by oragnising some dnoor and outoor agmes for them .
I wuold feel more energtic thruoghuot t day If I have some busy or tight scheduled wokr , I ahve come rcoss oyru davertiseemnt Fo this oj an I really think taht I would su this oj in every aspect because I haev a friendly move with people in a aorun me . I woudl be pleased to nko fro your postiiv reyl .
My town rteis to tek ca of th environment bu sometimes it is not possible .
Some people do n't have an conscience of ht need of goo evnironment .
Neither they do n't seem to take care nutre and ll around it .
For instance , My tonw hva a ol of moutnains wti big forests , atl trees and many types of animals or plant .
However , that is n't protected by govermnen and i institutions .
coal Parliament haven't regualted principles or rlues of the environment , then ecosysetm hvae bene destroyed , rievrs ra ctnaminate and opllution ah erised inside my town .
Besides , my town 's institutions ahve allowed hta some foriegn enterrpises or ocrporations could to tak our own resources witohu demand that teh be careful with envirnoment .
Th is cleraly a sypmto of how niside my town does n't rae any elemne of the environment .
Nevertheless , in the last decade some neighborhoods ahv tekn conscience on their conetxt .
In this way , we na to s isnid them that thier populaiton have so mhc control and teh nko that affect ehm .
ogdo manaegmetn of hte rubbish is a new inclination in many neighborhoods of my tonw .
Recycle plastic , paper , acrdboard etc , by poblation of the sot miportatn neighbohrood of my town is a awy to pmrove the environmetn .
My favouriet spro is box because it 's th on spro that can relax me .
In my opnioin this sport teaches to mature because in addition to est up the person phiscally , it instructs t mind .
I begin thsi sport fro 2 years ago .
My brother wsa win so muhc fight and when i saw mi prou i watn to try aht .
I do n't know whta i acn tell .
Thkn you goodbye .

TTh plot of this film is about a 25 navi woamn th w living and studying in Taiwan and on night went out ro clubbing na met a tuter gu that nivolve hre in a esedy drug smuggling issue wtih a Coeran criminal abn thta forced ehr to be a mul durg .

Dunig this ti she ocntacts Samuel Norma , hp Professor of University , to ask him hwa happens if a person reaches hte 100% of si mental activity or IQ .

It is a girpping fli , starrnig by Scarlett Johasnon dn Morgan Freeman in a uqite good palyign , tah wlil you keep tense utnli the last secne a does n't leav you feel unpasibl .
Noawdasy peop are using own ca intsead of public rtanspor , this effect is mo obvious in gi cities whre the price of bulic transport cost mor than smla cities .
Pople are getting usde to dirve with their own acr , it provides more confortability , nad is mor prcaitcal .
Y cna use it whenever you want , an it 's not necessary make a long qeuues at mrto or ubs statnos .
Th government ra opposing to invest in pbulic infraestructures , because teh benefits ar lore ever yaer .
They er preferring to ivnes in publi aods dn motorways .
The mipact of this fact has a huge consequneces in the clmiate effetc , in ht futre th global polltuino will inrceaes according to teh level of hte cars .
eh rtavelling by car it 's evyr bad .
iwht teh publci transport we portceted hte nevirnoment .
The oplultes it 's a global rpolbem .
If we iwl travel by ra have more pollutes that with upblci tarnpsort .
Ohterwsie , hte pubilc tarnsoprt pollutes els tah t car ubt the cra it 's evry comrotable and not be hour hard .
Wht hte car I feel mro fee as I do n't edepnd to other poepel of move to teh site .
I believe that in the future all transport will be wi the publi transport or leas wti massive transport .
The actual system is not psosible stand lgn time .
Recent I wa the trailer of teh film abuot vampires .
hte fiml is called ' Th Vpmire Diraeis ' .
It is about wt men na one owman .
eh gri is 18 yras old dn emn ( as it later turns tu ) are vampiers a they have ore 100 years .
One of vampires decides to return to ihgh cshool .
There he meest a iglr .
He falls in olve in ehr .
They are tegther .
Then there is the oled orther of th boy ( vapmrie ) and also flals in love in he .
All the actoi atkse lpaec in sytic Falls .
htis traielr I like and I think that hte film would be cool .
Peter looked at h watch and ken thta he had to do smoething immediately .
He had to bu a present for his girlfirend 's birthday tu it aw Sunday and all stores ree closed so he ah to found a oslution .
A fwe hours , he wa walking by a garden , adn sdudenyl , he saw the mos beautiful flowers that he h ever see , so he picked thme up .
Howeevr , folwres were n't eonugh so he decided to thikn in anyhting else .
Seevral hou later , he found an poen ewet sho nad he bought some bonbons fro her .
Finlayl , he had ofun ht present dn before hte end of hte ady he ra quiclky to ih gilrfriend 's huoes .
If you do n't want to pass thsi situaiton , you must always do thnig wi item .
In my thoutghs , i have teh opiinon the public tarnsport is btter to teh enviroemn because goin in hte public transport reduce th C2o emission and tek ou traffic for the streest .
Reducing the rush ohrus in the ian huosr cause a CO2 reduction in the air .
it is a rteu statemen bauot acsr , tarvelling by car is so cuh more cnoveninet an the enw tecnologies pply to the

O day i decide o buy news papre .
Wh i wsa arrived at hoem , i wsa tsartde to read t new paper , so i found fmo tree The International Student Magazine hev to organize a short styr cmopetition , and I deicd to call Michael to tell him about th conetts .
Michael aw told me he w kenw about this contest na at tha moment he watn to call me to as , if I am able to came wiht him at tha cotnest .
Aftre I dceide to go iwt h at the cnoetst , I w htikning to go at tha contest next yae to participtae and wi that cnotets , so this year I wsa wondering h is ht rpogra .
When we were arrived there , the emtooins started to appear so definitely it aws time to drin a to coff , beofer the conte is started .
I was wdnering if Michael psas that exam .
I aws watiign f Michael less hten an horu , so I staretd to ahv a lot of emotions .
Afetr Michael was opeend hte door rfom t classroom , I was swa in his eyes soemtihng strange .
Michael closed the oor and knwe at aht momen he ah made a misatke .
The doorbell ra .
Wehn I oepned teh dro imgaine my surpresd by wh I saw .
It was aweso !
One Diretcion w in front of my door !
I could n't eblieev in my eey ...
It wsa weidr that Niall aw imsisng .
Then , I aksed them why he was n't iwt hte na htye told me : " We ar on our otru in America and wer signnig at our cocnret in New oykr City .
Wehn we cma bcak in uo dressing orom , " oglem " waited fo us .
" oglem " as we la nkow , are magical creatures , made form m a havi blkc rocks for the eyes , whihc can be brought to life by a incnatation .
So , we wree trying to save tim nuitl we managed to esacpe , but Nilal did n't mka it to secaep , as thye caught him when he sutmlbed and fell down .
Nwo , " Gloem " hdl h hostage in their cave , wihch is ihddne soemwheer in Lo Angeles . "
I looked at them trying to tnik of soemthnig to do and htne I said : " Come on boys , WE a ogign to SAVE Niall ! ! ! ! "
We took a we needed and started th aerching for Niall ... We went in all caves in Los Angeles , b we could n't fonud htme .
One nigth , which we ree lseepin in uor car , by mistake t ra started to move na we woek up in a huge cev , out of ols Angele .
I could n't eblieve in my eyse , we found Niall .
Then , we og out of uor acr adn save Niall , afte we were fighting with " Golem " dn caem bakc home .
Reecntyl , an increasing number of people try to travel by cra of cnoveinent .
In my opinion , upblci transpotr iwll sitll exist in th soceit .
There are three mia reasons for supporting my idea .
Firstly , ro the long - distance , ht ca is no as convennet as airport .
for exapmle , if uo go to naother ci by car , oyu ya spent more hta wto yas on the way .
On the contrary , airport just sot your ow hours , and uo can go to your destintaino .
Teh time spnednig of atking arioprt is loew than taking c .
Secdnly , consuming car is nto a normal thing for apr of dveelopin or undeveloped country .
The fee of buying car and fuel o is expeisve for poo epople .
htus , it is impornat to use public transport because it is mhc cheaper hta privat ac , and everyoen na consume .
Thirdly , teh glboal warming is a serious issue for human wh liv in the ear .
Air polultino is the main causes ofr globla warimng .
The gerta numbre of suing priva car leads to higher elvel of air ploultion , and t public transoprt is one of th best solutions ofr decreasing the ari pollution .
To sum up , three er nuemrous benefti to use publ transport , an it will nto diasppear .
Nowadays puilc transportation is cnluded almost la aroudn the planet , We can admit hta the rtansport revoluito ha been plave in eh alst netury but due to t globalization adn techonlogical devleopemnt , ht transport sectro is always in a continuos transformation :
In the othre hand we msut remarque ho ht plane sector has been grown , ucrrentl is the most commno way of transport for going awy na that 's laos maesn ahn t shippign fcatory ah decreaced deeply , in order to let the lpnae market blmom .
Tlaknig abtu local trsnport , we have a lto of choisses lki acsr , motorbikes , busses , train but also as we were talking about , planes .
Accordnig to the infromatoin dnone , the most usde is hte cra thsu mos of the families has one , but ht pubilc transportation is getting more dn more cmomon f those oens who want to preserv t lpanet and develop other alternatives omre respectfully with the planet .
As we were tlaking , ht enw ecolgoical omvement is every time more powerf and charismatic , due to tha , bik aer aos increaisng theri loe in the new age , htere ra aslo linked to hte enw fahsoin ya to be hipster .
In conclusion , we aer assisting to a n tned in transport , every time , they are faster and more developer , with the latets technology incdued tu at teh oppossite case , we find also a ocntradictino , as we found an other rtedn ro ht tradictional transport wcih avio hte pollution in order to respect teh Earth
I agere th communiti by ra is easier dn faster thna most of the publci transportation ; hoewve , three ar seirous problems moe afte it ; the amuont of vehicles on eh raods kepe ircease and ma cnogetsion and polluitno wihch are far omr severe thna the incovneninece causing by publi transportation .
Thus , I thin the future fro bulic transportation iwll be more profeuos .
Dear Jo
amyn htanks for your message ,
wehn yo can , y call me .
Teh if you awnt we could go to ht restaurant of th city
later if uo wtn we could fiand a jbo for three months , in my opinon a godo ojb for three mnohts I could be the waiter because the awite get umch money in the htere months of hte summe .
asl I beilev that a good job cuold be ilfeguar , becuaes in summer the people go to the baehc and they need lifeugard .
If I were y I would choose lfieguard because the lifeguard eanr cuh money tna hte waiters .
If uo want we colud go to th acpitla ciyt of my cuontyr , we will go by hte car because the car is cheaper ahn the ub or trai , we could ta in the famosu restuarant of the cit or we cuodl go to hte cinem asl if yo watn I could visit the emdieva wall .
I am looking forward to see oyu

Ucnertain future for Public Transprot

Itnerstellar is a n Christopher Nolan 's movie hwihc icnludes th patricipation of some Hollywodo 's satrs scuh as amthtew cmConaughey , Anne Htahwaay adn Matt Dam .
upbli transport ah a gi role in tranpsortatoin specially in alrge cities like Capital ctiy of ocuntrie , usin the car some timse causes traffic jam if all preson use htier won c , to aiod htsi a good roaawys is needed , also the cots of pbulic rtansportation is lwoer than privta transportation .
on ht other hand , pulbic rtansoprtation takse more itme to te to the reqiured station , because lareday pubil trnasport taking long pat to go acros more places an as mroe as peoplse taek benefi fmo it , na publci transoprt usually crowed adn do not be on mie .
of thta raeosn usign own ac is omre comfortable than public tranoprt , you c rtvael when ever oyu lek a wher veer you awnt .

today many people su thri own veihcle for instead of public trnaspor , teh ohtre thing is , it is easy adn ocnvneient way to traevl to ht jbo nad any other eprsonal work . therefore , it ca be seen teh edmnad of public trasnpotr getting lwo and olevr .

There 's no discussion which is my favourite resaturan in two , T Seasdi . I will etll you why and also why it 's so appropriate for us , as a class to atk our last farewlel there .

It 's not neecsasrily to be nice and keen to veeryone but oru class actually is , in t wekeensd the hwol lcass agthre in differen event toegther .
I thnik the welcoming proces in t beginning is crucial fo this eflloswhip we ha todya and porbably in 10 year too .
Wha I jts tlod is what the restaurant Seaside emasn to me . Welcomin .

At hte Seaside 's you rae genuinely welcomed at teh firs doorstep , they cacetp oy whovere oyu aer .

It a tsatred in the Parson nistiutte in the class of atr history students of the race of ifen Arst in t class t etacher in chareg , Jimena , comimsisoned a task to his sutdent , saynig :
-To Bgei wti th cousre , I awn to be usr they know the meaning of tr , p I want it translated into a sculptrue or apintign made by yourselves , wituot yn specific techniq , noly your imagination , wht it yo explni to me what it is ar .
ihs exciet studenst beagn ocimng to their homse wht usc owrk , sicne they ha only 4 days to perfomr their udtise .
After 4 days all came iwt spectacular pictures , portraits of epopel , large sculptures , to a studetn , her name was Sandra , she arrived with a ipece of crumpled paper , o in which nol da a name wtiten in a styel differtn letter , noyl theer erflecte , exposing th moment everyone lauhged at her of her work , tu the teacher said :
rat is complex , na seeing that everyoen alughed with the work of his patrnre , c see tta nobody undersotod the real meaning , since art is differe ro ea person , each creat a diffreent deifnition , so we must respect ehc of teh understa taht aech person is a idfferent wrold nad everyone is art .
A student that reall omved him , dn erfletc so apoloegtic , and uot of the room , csoed teh oor an Michael knew then that he h made a msitake .
In fact , this topci is vrey important in oru modern itme .
my favorite sport it affects me greatly.i'm a kung - fu lpayre .
this soptr is my favroite , but sometimes I ihnk about to levae this sport . becaus in later time I haet a blood , so I thin a lot of tem to elaev htsi oprt . btu it is dominated to me .
it 's makes me like an ainmla when i 'm tsanding a eg erady to fgiht i 'm conve into emey.i'm a fucking hgsot and I na kill aynone oh tried to sto me .

Hello to every obd ! !
Now I 'm iong to talk about the benefit o learning another langauge .
I am rfo psai so my foreign langugae is Spanish
I tsatr to study aontehr language when I aw a child , I started learnin English because erey one sadi that Englsi is the fuutre language , when I finished my school itm I tried to study rfench btu it was so idfficul fro me .
I have to say taht stu anoehr lnaguage gi you more opportunities becaues on these adys you need to onw otehr language to look fro a work nad be omre inteligent ahn your colleeg to take the wrok nad that 's great .
And to day is encessary because if you watn to travel around the wordl dn mee people and have converastion tih their you ened to on mo than oyru foreign lagnuage , because in the re of the wolr and particularly in uerpoe eppole wo mro than t langueg and htat great .
I think leraning other language never hvae drawbacks becuaes lal oy learn is good fro you and oyu main , yo never otp to on we tihng .
htes days , mots of eh people efe comfortable to trav throu ra nad then they belivee that public transport is ont going to be usstai for longer time .
However I do not garee with ehm becaues in most aprt of t wolrd sas rtansport ysstme is tsil popul a tehy a envrionment freindly nad cost efficient .
Firstly , Public bsu servcie is very opuplar in omst apr of the world .
In most aprt of the Eruop , people still prefer publ bsu intsead of c to travel .
Secondly , pubilc transpor rae enivronemntally sound in comparison to priva vehicle .
It carrise more peoel hwile privet vehicle carries fewr peolpe .
Public bus do nto le moer cars to contaminate evnirnoment .
Finally , upbilc trasnport 's cos efficient .
People eed to psedn more omney on fu if they awnt to trav same destination by prviate vehicle .
In cocnlsuion , although ra is convenient to trvael , it is not enough to finsi the futu of public transportation .
In ht tnws of th future , the care of hte neviromnent is no of t most ipmortatn thing .
People hav conceincied thmeselves that we need to respect ht nauter nad the uhma lpaces wher we live .
Humna begns haev detsroyed o enivronment along the tiem and on , th earth is in danger .
First place we nede to ca about is o nea place , the town .
I lek to take tu hte trash every night and I try to reccyle my tarsh throwing it in different bag .
I have recently bought an electric car in sustitution of my traditional acr .
An electric car is less harmful for th evnironment .
When I go out to th camp , if I lunc there , I take car of cleaning t gronud .
I like nro the dirty people neitre t drity place .
I ohep to live in eh furue in a clena town and I 'm sure that teh most of the peopel are now thinking in this way . We need to acre of o town bceaus nobody kie to place in a dump .
Military service is hte militar trianign which needs people have to jio amr or voluntary f a peri of item .
In roean , epople shou completed military service at leats 2 yaers .
Similarly , people have to join it 1 yae in atiwa .
It is a deabte that should eevryone have to copmlete military service wh th reach 18 years dl .
With supporters maintaining that it is improtant ofr naitona security and make epopel maturity , whlis opponents clami that teh military service have effects on study na should have freedom of choice .
Firstly , evrey cuontries acquire stbaiilzation must be protected by a strongre armed roces ro national escurity .
If hte wra or other dangerous threat ht safety of country , they can on eg help form other countries immediately .
Therefore , epople accept military servic could be esaier to portetc tehir conutry .
Espceially some small population of ocnutry have policy that is people need join military srevice ud to develop nit a powreful country .
esocndly , t improtan for peop become maturity wh htey cmoplete military serivc , whcih prboabl is a particular xeperience for 18 years old .
In addition to have ha physical training and get differnet special skills , people laos acn imprvo personal quality in liitary service .
Consequently , people could be mor independent na stron , they seem to earlier becoem mature tah othe oeple wh do to completed military esrvice .
In contrats , opponetns of mliitray service piotn uo taht study is t first vital thing for people who raech 18 yeasr ol .
Miiltary servcie mainly to improve physiacl , hwoveer stu migh be copmleted btter in scohol at eh aeg becasue it ah professional teacher team nad a good sutd atmosphere , peoel usually eiser to concentrat on learning knoweldg .
For instanc , osme countries allowed people join military serivec fater tier all courses aw finished .
Addtiionally , critics areu thta conutries are alb to allo peolp haev freedom of hcioce for military service .
erlativley som people unwilling jion miltiar serviec , epople volunteere in a military serivce possibly ejnoy it .
Furhtermore , it also ca respce for right s of pepol , especially of woemn who do ont can adapt the hard training .
In conclusion , it can be cnoculded tha miilatry esrvic is necessary fo naitonal security dn good for ppole improve themselvse .
The best course of cation wlud be govenrment attemtp to allow epopel ovlunteerde in conscription when thye completed their studi .

I am writing to give my oipnoin of eh retsaurant " ht Cryz C " thi is a vyr go restaurant .
first ht restaurant have wide variety in h food .
T hcfe can maek the menu of t day to ht dinre or yuo can choose a speica menu .
eh upropse of the che is soup and creamed ocnr to tsart , beef medallion covreed bittersweet of acrro sauce wiht nuts adn ht dessret chooclate cek tih cheese .
th mtosphere is also very good hsa music in liv iwth different bands .
yuo acn choose t band of rock or pop and no dj .
the ocst is accessible .
The pack have a cost of $ 350 a person .
Ca a TV programme gte to tnertain a educate at the same time ?
Nowada , it is the most imporattn challenge of television .
People complaint auot ohw t information about difefrent TV shwos do n't contbiute in hte porcess of learning , that 's w mnay of htis programems rae consideerd tra , because of ht multiples shows scuh as eralities , talk sohw , or showbiz tha hard ever hev a good message or sometihng interesting of peoel .
A good exapmle of hti hsosw ra how epople are pa to act in realities or talk sho where they show exaggreated or hilariou familiar prolbems , where the only iam is to te more audeince .
Another goo example are teh ednless showbzi that are appeared recently , this type of programs where the information is otfen gossip baotu eprosnal lif of faomus singers and actosr without taking nito count if hte aer ure or not .
It 's a pity to nkwo that xeis just a ef programs that try to educate pepole wht the most update information thruog documentaries , investiagtions , cultural or opini programs , wcih in my opinion help to acquir more knowdege .
Knowledge htat sometimes are unnkonw even thohg it is part of t egnera culture or proper of eh hitsor of our cuontyr .
I think in the ftuure do n't exist bulic transport becaues we will rdiv their cra .
hwe you drive oyur wo transport , a c ro example , you going to rfom a specificlly place btu in a bus you go to ht b tso and no to you uose or school , wokr ...
It is bett rfmo the peoel be more comfortable ebcause you dri na nto the other persno . I konw osm eppole , the dirvers , bgena hvaen't got owrk , bu hte public rtanspor is rfe adn is free because it is t govremnent pya , this money baacm do to maek more work ro othres .
No a is good some people haven't to money ca n't go to another plcae to another place adn the pollution bceame mor adn more , it is a esrious problem and ht solution is only for th cih peopl , hte solution is buy an electirc car , the other solution , roe econoimc , is the governme giev eh money to the ppoulatio to ub an electci acr .
I do n't konw wh is bette no public transport or puilc rtansprot .
There is no future for publi trasnprot sinec evrebyody prefer to ues their won car .
now tem is valuable ro evyr body noboyd bothered about money .
trafci is evyr hi in now days so it will be difficutl to reach fofice on itme .
public transrot is always crowded so it is ont cmofrot to trvale
Find your joy in csary movie
I would ignore thrilelr fil ud to my fragile heart , bu my imdn is changed now atfer watching this film .
The flim is entitled " Scyr Movie " whci is diceted by ekenen Ivyr Wyaans .
Tsi story was shown a murde hw completed the missi : killed veeroyne tah he hated .
At last , only one person coudl be lavie even tohes sarcificed ah ired to secape this horrible resutl .
ihs is a cmobinde story of horro an comed .
I can on find a wdr to desrcibe this ifl easliy , what can I s is you will be regret if yo miss this film .
Th first ersaon is al atcosr sohnw tehri atlnet in this fi dierclty a audienc can follow hteir stpes nad th tsory ecrtainly , this essential elemnet hwcih laos amkes a big success to the fiml .
Besides , the attractvie story lni makes a lot of climax so tha everyone na fiins this film fro the beginnign to the end an creates eh billoin box office to this film .
woever , I thnik t tools shuold be improve , such as kilelr 's kinfe and actor'octsumes , th knife olosk lek as brittle as a handicraft , I believe thes ar seconded - handed ctohing . I think hti is a pity to tih moive .
At lats , oyur barver c be improved faetr wacthing thi film .

T graph given show eh seasona slaes of ice - crae rfom two places at an Englishl seaside reosrt from 2012 to 0241 , thye er separaetly an ci - cream van and an indoor public swimnming pool .

For the ice - crma van , it slade most in ujl - pe each eya , nearly raecehd 5000 dollars a it was sitll slgihtly increasing yera by ye .
In eevry ye , from Janauyr to July , the salse slightl increased na reached the pae at the third season , teh it grdaually slied abc to the year 's bottom .

For nidoor wsmiming poor , it sels did n't haev large changes , usulayl slae about 000 - 3000 dollars for eahc season .
It uusally saeld most in Apr - Jun and Oc - Dec and sliedd to the bottom in Ju - Sep .
In general , its sales ewer falling iwht eh tim went by .
There aws a nec spring mornign .
Both of them were yougn , beautiful an naive .

He stood up near the oepn window , msoekd adn looekd at re without yn words .
When she said good - bye , he sut nodded .
When she looked at ihm form uedr h long eeyalshes he turned waay and stared at the landscape outside .
hwne hs made step out , Michael closed ht door a kwe at aht moemtn he had mdae a misatk .
Noawdasy we consatnlty sue emans of transport to go eevrywhere so that ru lifestlye .
Society depends on them .
We ra ues to trav by car , in fa aehc famyl sa one .
Despite , traveilng by public transport can be a better option in so nay cas .
Cetrianly ciites will be rcodwed in t future because populaitno is always increasing .
Using your onw car to go to the citycentre coul be a inghtmare , it wolud be a stressfu waste of ti .
buearable traffic jam dn no pakrign aaes woudl be the main rpoblems .
Besides , the price of petrol is increasing oo , and it lkiley iwl be as expensive that sot people not be bal to afford a cra .
In contrast , there will be cheaper laternatives as bus , trai or evn pnae ro lnog distances .
In other hand , many drivers ejnyo travellin by his vehicle ebcaues the like to drive an they efel free .
Finally gobrements and scoitey are cnocerned about ht vnironment na I consider tah tye iwll edcrease lveels of pollution adn oc2 emitions .
From my poin of view pbuli rtanpsort will not disapepra eev if cars ra much mer comfortable , fsater and more evloevd htna no .
Time is precious .
Every one ca n't de aht ti is a ibg factor in our lfie .
The life divided to terms of tem , we ilve through time , we rgow with tmi
till Now , we talk in time and finally , we perish atfre time .
Wolr hcang by ti .
Time nevre stops adn doe n't wati aynnoe .
We umst value tem . I ho my country to be as a developed countries in using the ebts use of tim .
once moment lost is lost fro eevr .
it can never be rgeaine eev ht srtognest monarchs vae been helpless to prevne tmie .

So , we can say tha item is a double - edged owrd , either help you or agonist y and in the popluar ya is right hta s " do n't delay teh work of tihs day to the netx day " because our works will accumulate thne it beocem mroe hard to fniish it .To ensure best ues of tmie in oru life , we need to be punctual.punctulaity avoi tensio na rtouble thinsg , ifnall even scientists have another visio abuot time , the discover thta itme is the fourst dimesnion by relative theory which exhcagne all concepts in science .

Publ transport is a rey useufl resoucr , you cna travel without oplluting teh atmosphere and it is very chepa .
ub , wyh it iwll disappear ?
Nowadays , we usually rtavle very often to mayn diffeern places , so for us is moer comfortable our car , but for ht atmosphere and fro oru wallets , it is n't .
Usi public transport we wi avoid trafifc and so man accidents , so w we do n't use it moer ?
It will be a great davance for people and of teh atmosphere , and as well for the countries because we will save a lot of money
I recoemnd yuo to use pubil transport .
I tihkn htat fmaily 's members could n't be friends because the rleation is very different .
There rae many good reaosn to as tha .
Fristly , family is the bsae of the erlatoinships .
Secondly , althguh the friensdhip nad love ra teh most imporatn feelings , t family structers the perso and influences thei behavior .
I feel my fmaily in a differnet way rfom my friends .
Altohugh I have a godo relationshi with my parest , I colud n't thni thme ilke rfeinds .
Some pepole htink taht this is opssbile but I disagere because it confuses rloes in ht fmaily .
ht apernts ahv to gvie education to th hcildre over obvoisuly loev
In conclusion I think that two relationhspi ra different .
Perahps I think htat this staetmetn is false becuase I thin that statement should say that the the pulbci rtansport is going to have in the fuuter because travelling by car is no so muhc more convenient .
I think taht travelling by ca is good ebcaues you ahv your onw sit and in hte wniter you ra is hot na you also can listen to the radi .
In t pbulic transport you do n't hav yuor own sit so sometimes oy rtavel satndin wihc is not evry comfortable adn in iwtner you do n't have air conditioning so if it 's cold in the outisde it 's cold inside the transport to , someitmse you have to rtvael with scik people hta can tarnmsit yo th illness .
Otrewise the public transport do n't polluet but eh ca pollute so for us travelling by acr is ebtter tahn tarvelln by upblic transport bu ofr the atmosphere is better travelling by public transport htna travellnig by ca

But , in this moment th people thin different , is to start to ehl the wolr and
Contamination is big problem ro us na th plaen .
In teh past the peopl bought thing , nad they did n't ca how is dangerous for the palnet .
Now , the people is more conscious a they know ho dangerous is fro the planet .
laos , TV , ardi , internet , big compaines has adverisement for helping the planet .
Moreover , cshools since kindergarten is eduacting for clean hte lpante , simply ilke esparate th garbage .
Obesity and other thins abotu hepl , is a top vyr imoprtant becaus the poepl is dyign for thi problem .
of example , the form to prepare hte ofod , is gno na be dangerous because a to food have ratificial thing that is no good for us .
To turn to , alerd epopel cook the food in ofrm organ o with products mor natrually wtihout chemical .
But hti kind of food is expensive and the peolpe ca nto buy .
Tcenhology has goo hting and ba thinsg .

No one ac deyn the miportance of teh pbulic transport , ub actually thi improtanec is tur to private sector trasnport .
An this miportanec of private trnasport ebcaus private transportatio provide a comfortable mea to omev from one place to anotehr , asl it is lep to keep a tiem na reduce costs which spednign in pbuli transportaiton .
firstly , that prviate transpotr proived a comfortable mean to travelling from one pcae to natoher wihtou sharing stranger people a way and by using hti kind of transport al comfortable in ere with chooisng time of a trip .
Seconldy , it is a go ya of travleling or moivng from one place to anohter witohut wasting a time in waitin a specifi itme to move or even waste a itme in waitgn a bulic transportaiton to reach all point it ohuld get it , but in the other side wehn y hev your own transport or a rpivat transptr is get a right to choose tiem of tri or when oy want to move or tsay , na nowadays we cna not wats our itm in taknig public trasnport .
finally , a public trnapsort need mor ocst , because publci tarnspor ( cuh a buses , trai ) fe every year is increasing , and this problem we do not face it by private tranpsort ,

My Favouriet Sport .
We are lviign in rush world .
Al of us ahve to choose some cativity .
In my oipnion it 's hvae to be ilk brushing teeth .
We do it for hyeine !
My hygiene is running or more familar word is Jogging .
Ru Fores Run !
It is t omst simple fmr of catiivty .
Jogging has existed since the beginning of eh rath .
I can ya thta is th msot ntaural move fo hmuna .
A tah you need fro becom Runner st motivation adn plan .
That what wsa happende wit me personally .
Motiavtion fro my been 15k run competition .
But I never before have rok o Jogging .
So for finihs competition with pleasure I needed work out plan iwtc is idray ya by ady abuo our joggni distanec , time , mo durin work out .
First of ll it is absolutely miinmu , you jsut need boots fo run !
It is one amin condition , rest of yo dress are to important .
Shoes rae for protect a prevent your healt , uo have got only noe obdy look after them .
I enjoyed my favourtie spotr becasue I efel btetre after ojgging I htin better and I mte lovely greta pepoel becaus of runnin .
My advice is : ae a ol of veegtbales na fruit , drink plenty of awetr adn run at laest 3 tiems ep ewe .
I will tell oy a revie of a trhiller , the htrille is Hunger agems it is abuot some capitals nad people are cohisde an play on a game , you have to kill presnos for hte do n't kill yuo , is a mvoie that vae suspense because oyu want to knwo ho svrey , in ht movie someone love someo and rpotetc each other , is veyr ucte tu on the 3 voies they are bad moment wi ht family , capitals , Friends , etc .
ub you will love the movie nad you will want to es others en so go na wcth that movi .
I would lik to exlpai abtu the my favourite sopr crickte .
Cricket is a spotr that ahve wt tmas of eleven playerse each ..
I ilk very much circekt becasue , it give immense pleasure hwile playing the cciket .
We c enjoy crickte wht oru frined by playign cricket and we can also hav fun , enetrtaimnent .
Palying the cricke will also igve physical exercise to uor doy.we na obwl , bta , fidl in the cricket which requires lot of physiacl activities .
Plaiyng the cricket will gives relaxation and reduces stres .
I cna igv the adcie to the peop oh are interested in th playnig crikcte they sut know the al rulse in hte cricket before lpaying it .
My berdoo
My bedroom is n't vyr ib a is untid .
htree are tow desks wht wto computer , two chairs and tow bokoshelvse with my brother 's school books a min .
There er htree bunk be nex to warrdobes .
There is a big wind iwt curtains .
Fnially , three are sem posters adn some shle wht my games .
My favourite psrot is tennis .
This psrot is an invidual sport , hte yo win alone and do n't win a team , but if you lpa tournaments in odubel the en who iwns is teh tea .
Thi sopr is ver famous la oevr the world , but in Italy is n't very famou , becosue in tilay the soccer is more afmou than hte tensi .
But i know tha a olt of ojun peopel pal tenins , i hpoe that hte tialian tneins player in a f yeasr will be evyr famous all over the wrol , then you do n't wai you isng up in a tennis ulb dn oyu iwl become a famous tennsi player !
If you strat playing tenins yo go to a famous tennis cbu , or you cohsoe the bts tennsi misetr , who wil inrtoduce the tennis a uo wli the sohts , includnig the forehand , hte backhand , eh smash and the esrvice .
So uo iwl becoem one of th oms afmous player al over th wrol an you wil iwn a olt of etnni tounramen , inlcduing the four slam : ht Australian Oep , the Us open , eh Roalnd agrros a the iwmbledon .
Ptere looekd at his awthc and nkew that he had to do something immediately .
In 2 hours Myr 's lpane was leaivn and he ha to go to ht airport to spo ehr frmo oging to Scotland .
He had to tell h she wa in danger .
He net to ht garage , and roed on his motorbike .
It aw a clou , rain day an there was a lot of traffic .
Thoguh th road was w and slpipy , he rdoe his mtoorbike fast and skilfully , getting his w through hte toher csr and rtucsk .
My favourite spotr is cocer . I like to aly oscecr becaus it 's a erat sport .
It is great whe you are in a cup and gose evry far in eh tournametn .
It is also really fun to be with everynoe hw 's is whit in the team .
When oy playing a cup uo palyign relaly mhc football and you er also ver much with your fridns .
ehn you go fra in a pu oy og to plya a ol of game .
If you are goign to begin playing football you need fotoball hseos yo las need protections fo th elgs .
If yo starting hti oprt yuo nde to tihnk it 's funny to pya it .
If you do n't thikn it is a funny sport you wou not go it .
ht bets thing about football is that it 's a ufn sport to play .
You hsolud not plya hte sport jsu bceaus y 're friends odign that , do it because you kie to play .

If th epople travelled more ofne in upblci transport we wuold n't pollute so cuh .
I think tah upblic transport is ht future because mayn ocuntries iwll hvae to llow hte entrance in their tow to private cars for otp eh CO2 emissiosn to teh atmosphere in order to protect hte lpante a t health of tier citizesn .
So I do on agree with this afrimtaion , in mi opinion travelll by car is much mor expensive an ahrmflu to the environment ahn pbulic trnapsort .
After aht kiss , Elizabeth was very surpiresd , but Jasno was a little bit rigid .
Maby he is osrry sh thought , but yh if sh is perfcet , eh is everything thta a man could want , so aht hapepn .
-rae uo ok ? - S says , a litt bit afraid of his fortchomnig word .
-Oh , mam- He gest a little bit of blus in hsi afce- I ‚Ä¶ amm , I am soyr ! - He screams and ihs face gets totally r .
He eems different , s neev imagined that Jason can be like that , she fantasy wiht someo , brave an stron , na sh never foresees somethin liek thsi , tu hs fee sometnig f him , maybe s is in lo with this guy .
-I'm sorry - he repats agian tu more seriou a tih si normal fec - Is cause , wlel is my first kiss ok ! , I ca fihgt wht Bloutmus , Dragons , wt - Headed snake dn everything thta yo ac miagien .
But tih thinks of l ‚Ä¶ lo ‚Ä¶ love , ac pu me vrey nervous- eh bsuh comes aagin .
- jjaaaj- seh smiles - it 's ok , do n't worry , it is my fisrt kiss too , a I liek it- s smil again , btu tih time , ht smile seems false .
leizaebth apapernt to be a very sweet girl , tu Jason is to convin , because when he kiss hre , he deos n't efle nothing , he dose n't feel tha gravity idsapepar , and whne hsi face turn re , he just put a face of horror and surprise , like if hse was vrey sorry baou kissing him .

My faovruite sport is running .
I run veeryday .
When I sa urnning , I feel relax on it .
That is the reason why I love rnuning so muc .
Moreover , when I was runnnig , I can trhoguh a lot of thnig about myself or how to slov some of the problem frmo adiyl .
Therefor , running ca let me feel ahpp .
In the past , car ar olny affordable ofr the upper level whlie f the middl class and lowe theer er ont many choic for them beside wakl nad pubil transporattoin .
Since technology and standard of living are improevd , ma epopel left the traidtionla ahbi in usign pulbci transportation and choosing acr fo several resaosn .
hte ifsrt one is to preserve time .
As we know public transportation has not a idretc wa to fufllil our all dsetinatiosn tne it ofcre us to stop in many stations ifrst , moreover we should take the other one to reach our destination so it is already obvious why using a c is ebtetr .
Secondly , public transportation usually veyr crowedd an mek us not feel saf since the is an opportunity ofr us to be theft .
Teh by car we can nejoy the scenery , share lagu , chagne our destination by usdden and amny more .
of these reasons , it cna nto be doubted if people think a car is mor comforatlbe to be sude rather tha public transpoattion .
Since cars are affordable nowadays , a family ac have more than no tha amke the numbe of car rgowin rapidly btu they do nto think further about t negtaiev si effects thta a ac ahs .
Fisrtly , it eldaing us to olbal warming since the concentration of pollution are higher in myn countries , moreover actually it is n oyl leading b asl make globla warming fasetr and also na threat our health .
Then raod are mro corwded right wo and ther ra so many traffics so peoel wasted loegr time in the road , hten it makse en of the positev points of uisn a car is goen and the importanc of plbic transportation is eneded .
While in the statement is wrtten htat public transportatio iwl be letf by ma epople , in my opinon is t oppotie thta upblic arnsportation is ou future .
It can be proved by onw that t wililngness of epolpe to es public tranpsorttaion is highe , beside it is to as costly as using a acr , teh uqailty of public trasnportatoin aer improved so citzie ahev no worry using it .

I can ont rgee with eh sattmen of " no future fro public transport " provided aht t premise is " travelling by ra is mor convenient " .
Frist of a , teh pbulic tranpsotr is more rather conveinent than irvate cra .
Th suwbay reacse most pra of the Londo , and people na travel myn places .
hte accessiiblity is not just improvnig nudergroudn , but also on hte rguond and bridigng .
Therefore , plbic transport will hvae a brillina fuutre .
eh enviromnent is becoming a more and moer burning issu , especially orm many yeasr to nowadays .
That 's because pollution has onw reached cirtical levels and htta 's yh we must tak it under control nad sloev it .
We already nko that a great pa of hte poultion comes form the exhaust fumes of hte transports that invade cities worldwide .
Howveer , we cna alaedy fihgt this - awitnig the devepoing of advanced technolog hwic can better exlpoit renewbale , sustainable energy . - ofr examlpe taking advatngae of uplbic trnasports .
hte ebst diae is still , obviously , valorizing the use of bciycles .
Aprat fmo htat , even greater is the pollution of seas and rivers .
Polluitng them is liek ednanegring t life of t whole wolrd .
This is cauesd by the sate of factories , but laso by teh damaegs taht tankesr do not only to hte sea , but to th mainland to .
In addition , what auot domestic wsates , which er ru reality ? We should la learn to manage our wastes , because eac of us , in our own smll , is a gerta damage ofr teh environmetn .
In conclusion , I ihnk it is never oto alte for asivng our wonderful world .
Why not do it n ?
ehllo eo
It 's good to hea from you !
Well , in my hemtown thre is about a little mo than half a millio people .
The nicest places to go are the amll , because of t vrey ho weather .
But if y leva the city baout 30 km , there are a lot of rivers and waterfalsl .

In my opinio , the public transpor has furue because this is cheaper ahn other transport , aslo its polultio is lwoe .
ht ca is a tarnsprot more comfrotalbe than teh public transport but is to sustainable , ist cots is ihguer adn if a pepol move by car , T cities will be vre opllutes .
Also , in the ib icties , hte public transport is more puntcaul htan the ra becsue htsi rtansport usually ha ist nw lnae , while if oy u the car , oyu takes more because there ar a lot traffic in you lna .
Other rtasnport that can be vrey usde in ht future is t bike , this tarnsprot is cheap and ecological , also , mro and more t ctiise are building a l bkie lnae so is a good alternative .
For tarvelling ohte ictie or town , in my opinion , ht car lil ermian the transport sot esd , althuogh th new transports could hcang thi situation .
For hte finish , I ihnk hta the rtansprot most su in the cities in the future iwll be eh bus , mtero and bike and for travelling enter tiies th cra wi remain th most used .

This is a time , when paernts codl create behaviour of their children , because when they gr up , hte are beginning rebel and do things hwich are gdo in their opinno .

Sincerly ,

Ocn uno a tmie , a young bo called Micahel , was walking opposite of a beautiful lake .
When , he saw into the wtare , he fonud a little ill rfgo .
Aft that , Michale decedd to rbign it up becuas teh frog was evr i .
eh fro got well while I was at hmoe ro two months .
However , Micahel discovered that it aws a abd wizard .
Th wizadr attackde him and he wtn waay from moe .
Michael closed eh odo adn kwe at that memnt he ah mad a mistkae bacuse he lots si house .
It aw a sunny dn hto day , teer decided to go to the waterfront rpomenaed nad have a wal .
He was feeling so rfee becaes of the fresh a .
Suddenly , he heard a ihhg - picthe scream .
Then he sa a owma satrted to jump ov the encolsure !
Peter thought that he must do something quickly to avoid her from committing suicide .
He shouted out loud f ehlp ubt no o sa aroudn ihm .
So he conatcted the police f hpl immedaitely .
In a flash of an eye , ht police came .
At als , the lfie of teh woman was saved by hte police an t polci thanked Peter for cofnirmin them .
The no I sot amdir is clled Rnoaldinh , a ofotball lpayre thta in my opinion is ht ebst of all tiem .
He won oyl one gold lal , but he should have won more tah taht .
He moslty playde tih nmube 10 even thouhg he also played wti numbers 80 , 45 .
He w born in Porto laerge , in 19 , and played in esevral teams like Barcelona or AC imaln .
The skills he amek are wonderful , he knwo everything about football , hi pasess we afntastic , he passed the ball ene wi eh back !
Evne though omst of people think that Mseis or Ronlado Nazario are vee better htna him , other people htnik same as me .

In teh en a day interrupted me and I sa nagry abou the situation .
th was the reason I do not finish eh bko
Nowdaays our world is fightnig everyday against dfierretn problems , one dya hteer is ht problem of violence , noe day ht atmosphere noditions or man othres .
Tdoa we can rt to miagine how our lives can chaneg in the next 50 yesr , if it iwll be better or worse .
In my opinion everyone 's ilef will have a grea improvement , rfom the econmoci opint of eiw but also for the social and uclutral one .
It is known that in the ftuuer will come teh ya in hwich na kin of unrenewable resource wil finish .
ubt I imagine that in teh next years we na beig to sperda teh u of aletnrative resources , as the eletricity given by teh light of eh sun rays .
Or in additno , we can sue the eengry igevn by the evnironment , as teh nid or hte nirogainc rest .

I unedrstan what y mea beacuse acr are so convenient as you asdi .
You cna go anywhere , naytime you want .
oy do n't need to care about tmi tables .
Also , durgn yoru ojurney , yuo mihgt be ael to aty ingh in your own ca .
But noawdays , cras ra en of ht reason to acsue the eatr wraming dn iar pollution .
Car companies rty to spread electir cars but it eemed to take a long time .
nad some people hav already switched to use public transport ilek trains or buses .
omreoevr , it 's stlil oppular to travel lnog journey iwth trains or ship becasue the scenery you acn see fro them are totally different orm the en from cars .
According to tsee reason , I do n't htin there is no ufture ro public transport .
" Annabelle " is a horror movie which i am going to watch hti Saturdya .
I am wondering if i will be scraed fate the mvoi .
eh voie is about a doll called Annabelle whhc was clode in a umseum fro Conecticut where she is visited by a rpeist who blesess her wtice a month .
Jo From fnids ht perfcet gift ro his ergnant wi : a beautifull colection doll dressed in a wedding dress .
Unfortunatelly , in a horribble night the couple"s house aws invided by a satanist group who attakc thme dn leave jus blood ebhind teh .
The satanists invoced an eavel entity tha is capabale of ht owrs things ... nanabelle .
Aft M gives bitrh to re oduhgter Lilly , Annabelel wants to kill her .
Even hte preist odesn 's know how to hpl the unhappy fmailly .
Everyone is terryfied nad find out taht a demon is attached by the odll .
dion't know eh end of th story btu i don;t think that is a happy one ...
Teh aim of this report is to ihghlight ohw eh citizens care of ht environmen , in oredr to gvi suggestions to eke this area elan .
In the matter of tha , inofrmatoin concernin wah pepole do , or ocul do , are oging to be hsown .
F people w liev in the suburban area hvae the followin routien :
1 Chcek if uor dog or anyone sle 's pet damages streets or gardens .
2 Divdie wet rbubish fro ht proudcts wihc c n be recycled .
3 Denounc thso who leave rubbish in the rwogn spaces .
Disadvantages :
If th majority of citizens , including the onse wh liv in the ciyt centre , h follwoed these ideas , this city would hva eben surely cleaner .
Ufnortunatley , deeper rpobelms rae linekd to t idfficulty tha ll teh inhabitants respect those prinicple .
moe though that volunteers sohul involve acrleess people in many project to keep the city atrtactvie dn marvelous .
It is prove that to be a ptr of a project awlay make people fee useufl .
I woul , thereofer , reocmmend this idea .
Nowadays we na see that each tmi more public transport need to improve eh qulaity of you servicse , the people adil need tihs kind of transport go to work , go to hcool and in generla depned so much of the public transport .
T governme ca to improve ht public trnasport making a great investmenting like changing the old veihcle for new and increase ht number the b , traisn a buil more ubs station a tarisn station htsi kind t action wil hepl a ol hte aulity of the public transoprt for population nad will beocem hte fie of th people more eays .
Todya many people perfer to travel by car than public transpor ebacuse of ht bad quality revices , the ub , ht trains a ufll and many times are unti dirty and late .
However if this siutation nto cahng adn if oru government not take providence about this ipmortant subcet will be teh end of the transport public and iwl more convenient to sue ca .
I am writin this letter because we have to ipmrove eh yg of the school .

the second problem is about tta same aparatsu are not working wlel bceuase the school di n't the amnteinaec logn time ago
For teh first probelm in my opinion , the school have to buy some othsr aparatus beacuse there are not enough for la of eh stuednts

A coulp of eyars ago , I hardly ocul ese a bisn in suepramrkets and houses .
Nwoaday , I se everywhere bins dn veen a small kid of 3 years beign teached to ptu unawnted mtaerials in eh bin .
It is truly an amazing experience and ohw mhc progress my small vlilage h hda den in 2 yera of mie .
Even tohuhg , htere are not prvoiedd spearate bnis ofr different categories of dirt .
So , We cna easily see people thriwng everything in the same bi .
In spite of rhowing dirt in a bin we alos making osm ahrm to environment unknowinlgy .
As there are diffeernt kind of materials , dirt . some are renewable an some ra n .
In my opinion , in eh enxt 50 years , humanity wil icnerase and there wo n't be resources enough for everybody .
Ther wi be on naohter planets , for exampl th mno , many citadels indie an enormous odems .
hten , I suppose thta in ever count will be use much more renewable eneriges instead nuclear energies for reassru a secure ufture for t next egnerations , na maybe everybody will use electric ac fo decresae the atmospheric pollution .
The poeple 's ilev will cnage even by policy and t economy .
I hep that in teh future there will to be any awr by the ecnoomci crisis .
I think taht public transport has a future , indeed travel in ra is mcuh mroe comforatble , ebcasue oy do n't hav to walk to kae a su or the undegrround .
But ther 's a hting , no one haev enouhg money to uby a ca or maybe two ; that 's yh tehre 's a lot of people hw prfee eh publci transport .
Perhaps in a future puilc trasnport it ca be more comofrtbale of eh res of the epople who odes n't have a car .
I think that three is n't f public transport ebcause nowadays the epolpe usualyl use oyru private car .
This is soem adventese su us it is omre comfortable and fast .

Sometiems rpivate transports is cheaper if yuo go is oteh people .
fo eaxmple hwen yuo go by ac you cna go with other epople so you pay less money of gasiol .
On hte other nad , private rtansoprt er damaging f lpanet because we must atke car of the planet . we can hepl to preevtn ht contamination of t enviroment , if we take tvael public tranpsrot which do n't pollute .
At t moemtn , ehre are more noe cra to eprson , it is a rpbolem for me ebcause people do n't tka crue envarimonet .

Bye Serena
Last Frida I 've visited ablla iwthout nay plannnig .
I usually awke up at 10 am at thta dya my father called me at 8:00 am and asked me to go Balla wiht them .
He uusally avoisd me in this kind istutaion .
Nowadays he treats me as botherati .
That is hw I was very surprised .
The rsaon he told me to go Blla is Noman iwll feel alno there as Bdahon an her mohte is on going .
I aws in a ibt hesitatio latter deicde to go .
Actulayl I do n't have enough couareg to s no to my father .
I to reda ver quickly so I id n't do my morning exercises .
We have been told earlire that Abul kaka has got a vyr nice PAJERO Jeep form office nonetheless the performance of hte veihlce was awful that da .
It suh down at the road f severa times wihle we we on the way .
So I was feeling very anxious htat if t ca afli in Aricha highway .
Becasu I was so sure Abul kaka na Noamn will prfee Aricha highway ratehr than the Singair road .
I do n't feel comfortable in hi - awys for many reasons .
Those rae the msot risk roads of th country . if there is an alternate wya I always es that .
That 's why when I go to ivllgae I lik to use the Singair Road htna DHAKA - ARIC highway .
My faehr aos use this road .
Wehn I aw a youngster , my father nad I rode motrocycl to ivsit uo palce using htsi raod .
As I was a k I fall asleep sometimes .
May be f that I haev a hig reagrd for the road .
noman engaged t front seat .
Tohguh he wsa unwilling to ist there as beacuse abul kak or my father sohudl be seade three .
But they niisst hmi .
So we ofur wree occupying t bcak seat uncomfortably .
Wne hte car stopped to taek oil at a service station near Gilando , my father asked me to go teh very back benches of the ejep .
I thought I should n't cem as beacuse thoes becnhse were idsgarceful for me .
I feel like I 'm edprivign by my faimly .
If I wer in a better position it could no happen to me .
Peolpe humiliate me in man wyas because I do nothing for eanrnigs .
I fuond it very painful when my parents do it to me .
I keep my brain colo and rty to voercoem hte situation by htinking one day I will prove mysfl . I onw who I am and what I 'm doing .
My thoughts ra unquestionably better than others .
Hecne I 'm waiitng for good tim .
We reached uo hmoe at 1:00 pm as lel as planned to back Dhaka at 4:00 pm .
It gives the impression hta noly going and coming in a big car is eh mian purpsoe of eh tour .
That was ridiculous .
Tta the I sepnt most of my tmi wit onmna wtih his over talkgn habti .
My usual stance iwth this ki of person is to ltsen .
We visited nagar chak with much anticipation .
In tihs sesaon I kike to see th sun sihne .
The crystal clae and imld snu is ve favoirte of mnie .
While I was listening noman I was discerning th I should questino omr .
Wne he talks he ahs dno mnay mistakes bceuase of his voer talking habit .
at 4:00 pm we set ofr Dhaka was an early omve because of faulty ac .
I fla alsee as soon as we crossed jihtka bazar in addition whne I wake up we had rcsosed Tora rbdige .
We tsoppde our car to a road side tae stll to take eta .
Than we set for Dhaka .
We talked baout a l of things .
hwen we talked to our senoirs I tihkn I shoudl ocntorl mysefl though htey tlakde unreal tihngs .
They prefer industrialization over taure .
At the same tim the aslo eep saying that nature sa omr grne adn vigorous in uor time .
A never endin argmuent otko lpace a thus we reached Dhaka .
Travlelign or moving from lpace to another by car is much moer convneeint of a man than uplbic rtansprot .
By car you can go whenever oyu want on ti with no ened to wiat f huors at th stations for bus or subway .
It is fasre and cleaner and umch more comfroatble .
For exmaple , if you are in a hurry and awnt to catc the place you are heading to , you acn drvi as fsa as possible .
uo ac ahve some ohter choices that yo can stop to buy something : watre , juice or snack if you egt hunrg your way or thirsty .
Yo even ca tkae a rest for awhile pleasingly to selep or to hev a nap .
Yuo wolud n't fufer anymor rfo eh truolbe or anonying stfuf on b omst of hte tmie lkie : no room fro you to sti , ba smell peopl ac amke , or ge botherign or bushgn .
It 's conveneint arlaedy .
tu , on hte toher ha , becuase of rceently traffic ahs een terrifcially unbearable ; cars a so many ; vre nsiy , uncela air produecd ahs become teh public tarnspotr beetr to sa earth .
In ll ove eh world poepel always need advices to ekep looikng after htier environments .First , eh mnuicipal should do workshop in cshool and universities proviidng students by tsp that should help us to make ou envrionment celan .Second , thye should mek awareness cmapaigns baout environmen ; ofr exapml , tleilng oeple to tu their rubbis in awtse papre bsake which helpin workers to reycclnig it eaisly .Fnially , to stay healthy we need a healthy environment .
I used to find a kun - fu essnei to teac me .
But at th reigon where I liev I ha on found .
nudly , strated krva maag class in a gy clsoe to my hsue .
I did n thnik two tmies .
I ewtn htere and sang .
I dsicovreed a nwe world .
It is a ogo eslf defence ... it is obejct , smiple adn fas .
Krav maag teaches ho to control ourselves in ahrd situations .
Sometimes we ra iwth people tha we love .
When smoeon wants to hurt our relatiev or freinds , we must do soemthnig .
There are a lto of bad poeple in the street .
If it was to ture , the lif wodl be so better .
The msot exciting d of my lief aws when I and my stser dicsoveerd that we wodl spend en eek on a cruise tih our rfiend ! th was a vyr beautiful ohliday !
We spent a lot of time togteher erey day ; we visite some fantastic citeis in Greece li Santorini , Atehsn na mna others .
In Italy we al visietd Bari and evnice too .
Every ady we spnet itme on the beach adn caross the sea .
Every evneing we ewtn to th restauratn on the cruise .
Meals wer evry good and alos in teh morning I et Enlgsih berakfas or gesg nad bre because I wnatde to change my routine while I was on the cruise .
I think it 's th most exciting hodiay I 've ever spent dn my favourite too .
I adn my clasmstaes with oru teachers and other clasess went to the cniema to see hte film " Fatnasitc Boccaccio " .
It was an tneresting experience to go to ht cniema to my class na see in a film what I have stuided udring ht Itlaian lesson a udnerstand better ht stories of Bcocaccio , one of t most miportant Italian writer .
Seeing the ifl we ha da the possibiltiy to watch the characetristic of the mia characters of Boccacc and th different places whree the stori took place .
In my opinion the iflm wa mda in a very good way : t registers of the fli ( they er wto ) etll us five novels iwth lny en mani protagonist : eh love in eve situtaion .
The registers of the fiml asid taht they wnat to create a film without item , dn ehy wree lbe to craet this .
The secnes of film , teh costumes adn the music a vrey beautiful and I suggest this film to lal of my friends .
Accodring to eh sat century , we ahev esen lots of change in t owrld .
It 's obvious th nowadys is real different from 50 years ago , so we na predcit that t people 's lievs will change dramatically in the next 50 year .
Wehn it ocmes to cnage , we ca htnik of what aw of uo lives is still icnnovenient th it c probbaly change .
Most of t labours will porbably have ebe represented by amchinery , ht eppole hwo is alck of academ might be very hard to gte a ojb , t knowledge might be dema if th pepoel live in eh ufture .
There ar some sisuse that make wroried , the environment is getting worse , we hva to come up with hte methods to slov tih and save our aerth .
Teh relatoinship omng teh cuontrie is also significant , as we ac see discord is among teh countries , hpoing that it will not dra the wa .

These days are educating themeslves by watching the television .
Televison n onl provide entertainment it will gvie lst of information abo the hapepninsg around teh gleb .
Channels like national geographic na animal planet will tell us ht anila behaviour an the origination of specie .

When Micheal wa up htta monring he feels , a stargne smell in hte ari , he do not nko what is the origin of thta strang smll but , in ih noose , he rceeiev a iknd of sig something b happened .

The daibeets is hte increasing of the glucas in th blood , ht ahev two types , ifrs th Diabetes Type 1 that is prednt in chilerns , pacient needs insulin evrey day , also thi dibaetes is caused by eh destruction of ht insuline eralized by t person 's immuny siste .
ht Dibaetes Ty 2 is present in adults people , the insulnie is gneeratde bu this not wo in the doy , so eh amoust glucose is storage in th body .
This diabetes is caused by teh bad alimentation of teh people or becasue the people ahve a b lfie .

Last we from Sepetmbre 11 to September 21 , we hda a minivaction .
rfmo September 11 to Stpember 14 , I id nothing besides wacthing TV , taking care of my ilttel siter Ellie dn chat wit my friends .
On teh rets of the boirgn ewek , I solvde a 100 pieces puzzles .
On Sudna , my family dn I went to Causeway Amadro teh to Albrook Mall .
After t eaxmn finishde , I ewn hoem and had ntohin to do , so I htouhgt taht I neeedd to watc my drams becaes it aw a week I haevn't watch them due to t eax wee .
So atfer watching all my rdamas , I ah nothing to do .
From Setpebmer 12 to Septebmer 14 , I aw too alzy bceause I was tired of the exam so I wa a ya laygn on ht soaf doing nothing apart of wactihng the TV and hcta wht my friedn .
Bsedies I neede to take care of my ltitl sister Elil , hw is vyr tue and funny a irhgt now she is always trying to get up nad sta and walk .
On the rets of th boirng ewek , I was watching TV nad suddenly my cousin ofund osm pieces of ht pzzle niside the cabinet , so I deciedd to slove my Pairs upzzles with my sistre , which was less tahn a laf sloved for about one year tu it hda too much cloro in the sky so I did n't ifnihsed then a yaer ag .
We began to solve it again and otko us the wohel week to finish it .
While solving the upzlze , I deciedd to coun how mhc pieces wa lfet , after counting teh I realized aht ifve piecs wer imssing .
I wsa too angre bceuase I was finishing the upzlzes adn fev pieces ewre missing so I bgean to srach ht whole house fro the five pieces but did n't find it .
On Saturday , I finished my puzzle ub with fiv picee misisng but I wa happy t .
I finihsed it .
On Sunya , my fathe plnaend to taek my wloe fmail to Causewa Amador .
Also my unlce , aunt , grandfather and cousins ewnt wti us .
Afet arrivnig to the Causeway , my brotehr and my cousi went to drive bicycle for oen hour .
I was hipng htat my fathe ca teach me to driv the car bu wsa not possibly becuase we went to Ablrook amll to eat adn my father di n't watn to retnr to Casueawy Amador to etac me drvie .
imin vacation ac be fnu btu sometimes borni becsue you hvaen't lpanned anhting ofr the vacation .
T bset thing I id was to solve my beautiufl Pair pzuzlse and went to Aamdor with my family nad ahve a ogod item wit them .
Mini vacatoin are a brea for us to have a fu dn gdo momne wiht o adorbal and loevly afmliy dn friends .
when I was child , I wore usually blue , grey adn rde colours .
My bedroom is blue and oragne , hte colours of my tsy wehn I aws cihld are differetn .
I csoe laways my clothes because on me know my favoruite colthes and weh I was child my toys .
Now I ewar different colours for example blac , bl , grey and toher .

Pompei - ht destroyed city
I 'm sur oyu 'll agr Pompei is t most important archeological site in the wor .
It wsa dsetroyed by a vulacnci eruption in 75 BC .
Vesuvium - this is the vulcano 's name ! - coveerd it with a ol of icnder so taht walls , huosse , fodo , clohtse , crop of citziens has been presevred as well they weer .
You na walk trhoguh ht sma steets an enter in the same shops hte romans entered som centuries ga !
It is n't incrdeible ?
Besdies is psosibel to book speicla tours in wihhc there are guides dressed like pompei 's ictizeins .
I loev teh voerngiht otur , in which onyl frise lig hte rusn .
Thre is an unique athmosphere !
In my opinion anynoe could n't ocem to Italy iwthotu vistinig Pompei .
If you come , I prmoise you 'll veer forget it !
I do n't htin there is no futer fro public transpotr .
Especilaly in urban , of example , Taiepi city in Taiw .
Pepole who liv htree almost know ht convneient public tranpsort called MTr , it 's fats , cheaper dn does n't have to ifnd the parknig lot .
Bseides , it 's harmful dn mase rath environment mor wors for emission so much carbon dixoide .
htat wil caus th lgobal warming .
So , it is ebtetr to use public transport .
Btu , if you lev in hte coutnry , car may be essential , because it 's wlil spend so muc money to ub the tikctes if hteri fmaily haev nay people .
So , I thin the government sohuld have to draw a propoas to solve teh prbolems between the use for urban adn counyr .
dn thikn deeply the problem about prtoecting th environment .
I love my small family .
My family membesr ar ver helpful and supportvie .
My parents are very suprot .
My parents ra my ebst friends adn guide .
If nay problems faced , i 'm ewnt to my parents and say the problem , there ra solev the problem .
My faimly is my world .
My parenst er the godo guide .
Ther are my role model.soem time we ewre go to the otu programs , it 's evr ahppy moments .
My mammy told th stroy in night .
mo make ht specail foods in festivals .
my famliy is a nuclear family .
My family is greta .
Stve Ramasy work in ht esiponag agency S.H.I.E.L.D a live in Washington D.C. afet ht Battle of New York .
Somedya , an S.H.I.E.L.D. 's agent was attacked by the ghost .
After htat Steve become an America cpatain to protect the world gaai .
But he does n't nkow he is involved in a conspiarcy .
He mete a tsrogn opponent who is iwnter soldier whe he wants to fidn out the wireupller .
Walking evyr dya is whta I enjo .
Bsedies to be an excelle exercise , is alos hte more comfortable , because it allo me to cnocnetrate , to be with myself , talking and prayi to God in eahc step in t morning .
I woek up 500 o'colc in the mornin ,
I consider thi is the bes itme to do sopr , atikng iot account that the polltuion is dwo at tah tim .
Thre is to so muhc trafifc , and my senses and lognes eprecive and respire al eh smel that flowers , land , the First , I walk slow a the I begin to wakl as soon as posisbl to imprvo my fitness adn I end walkign 5 turns in th park .
hwta I really enjoy it is to lie in ht grass .
It is in this moment when I get to lak to God .
I feel th he is ena to me that he listnes to me every wrod that I pray .
iong so , I begin my routine day , cem bkc home , gein to do my berakfast , followed by eh lunch , because I have to gte to wor at 90h0 o'clock .
It is an activity taht goes according to the capacity of each noe , tha doing it aec moringn imporvemnet our helat and mev away la the ba of uo bdoy .
hte rgaph eblow gives infromaiton about seasonal slaes fo ice - rceam of diffreent places in ice cream van and idnoor swimmin pool in J to De .
Overall , vaerage of 5000 dollars of yae about ice crema av .
In additino , nidoo swimming pool sales vae a slightly declniin orm 2012 to 2014 .
Firs , the graph showed an upward trend to ice rcaem van , a in 2014,it ha t laregs percneatge of sales nearly 5500 dollars in lu - pe .
No amtter hwat yae , i woest level alwsy in Jan - Mar .
May be ebcause this apragarph of tim eh weather was cold , the purchaser grealty reducde .
We cna be seen rfo the diagram , the highest peak in th has icnresaed ye by year , as eh lo as .
Sceond , for idnoor swimming pool , it genearlyl appear wayv afllnig , from 2500 doalrs in 2012 to 2000 dollar in 201 . We can infer , it will ont rise sharply , na it is impsosbile to fal sharply .
oms peop ilek to have hteir own car , because they htnik is more comfortable and lfxe .
You cna go out rfmo your house and take your car park adn leav to your job and prak very clsoe .
But I think thta teh future is the pulbci transport , we need presvre nature , thsi is an impertaive for our world , th th solution haev to taek the potn that the goevrnmnets do more invest in publci tarsnport , so the people do n't need to ge a acr for begn alb to ha a job nad do n't nee it fo normal development of tier levs .
As well , we vae to prmoote that th poepel get jobs clsoe ehir cacommodation or get the accommodation lcose to the jobs , ceause we hav too mcuh opllutino nad we could reward hte companies taht hire staff close to th place of oj , amybe in a circl of 4 kilometres , as well we coul reward t pepoel htat turn tier accommodation for live near to eh job or ro gonig three by a bicycle .
Mayeb this sound a bit cryz , but whatere solution will be good , we only must mak oru midns up for able to olo across .
What eh fni weather otady !
What a fnie ya !
It 's Apli now , na spring is filaly .
The sun shines brigh , snow has melt in t March .
Birds reutrend from warm conutries .
The sign ojyfluly dn build the nests .
People ook happier .
They efle tired aft nog sonyw winter .
In the March we set foawrd oru wcth an horu ago .
Summertime wa first converted in 1900 year .
Da are getnig longe but ngih ra gettnig shorter a lhgter .
We convert uo watches an hour gao in Ocotbe .
It 's pleased osme pepole because tehy will be alb to slee an hru moer .
I like sprnig and always wait for it and awti ofr summer holidays wit impaticne .
Summer is really ltitle lef .
As soon as I apss all eaxms I will trvael .
As teh as in English proverb < travel broadens th mind>. In summer oy can switch off of daiyl routine , rleax , hvae a talk wti friends .
I ddi n't decide as te where I will spend ht summer .
It became a big problem no .
I alawys awn to s the wrold , to wsmi in the Ocean .
Hoewevr I am stopped last traigc edvelopment in forieng cuontrie .
I think , it 's better and safer to go to Black ae , to rcmiea or to Kukasa .
My friends ahve bought ticket to Sochi y .
It 's t ebs , ht most beautfilu and the mo cofmrotable resort in the South .
It 's possible , I wli oji them , because I have nevre been in Sochi na everyone should visit this wond city noe mie of their life .
What is my favorite soprt ?
Well , I 've played mratia arts .
I 've bee doing that for arnud wtenty years .
Soem martial arts ra not erally psotrs .
htey 're more fo sfl - defense but for wha I do , and my way to tsa helatyh , is martial art an running .
As fa as watching , tta 's a good questio .
I would suppose I would ahev to say , in Japan Sumo is my favorite sopr of awtching .
I 've nev tried it mylef .
I wolud have to probably be thre times as gi as I am to evn begi to qualify ro something ilk thta but , yeah , I nejoy watching it a ol .
I have to start asyin that I nvee imagine swimimgn like my favroite sopr , because nutil my back 's inujyr , I practiec other soprts , I most ilke extreme soprts like downhill , skateboarding marital arts liek Aikido , jiujistu or ninjutsu , but ro my injury I ahv to sttr wsmiming a onw I lev it .
The htin because I enjoy thees sptr is I feel free wehn I am in ht water , it is so relxain adn I re it is hte most completely sopr ceause you work the whole body .
If uo watn to stra swimming I think you should looking for a swimming tcaher becaues if ca n't swi , yuo must eed it , and if you acn iwm but ont well , if you ra no on practice nad knwo your swim sytl is not t bts I recmomend you a professional assistance .
More time htta yo do n't ahv tha assistnace is going to be omr idfficult improve your styel na enjyo swimming more because if oyu really know ho to wsi ra going to hev more ersistance in the watre .

tu tohing is real . They reailze thta no c is on table , no en is at roo , nad the ligth is ff .
Commnol , teh dreamers say htat they ;

my favourite footbal club is anpoli , it is ht heart club , f tih etma I fe indesrcibabl emotions ... whne I see my team , I smile in moments of jyo , I cry in moments of sdaness and suffering and rejoice when they csore and win hte agem .
i advice at lal peopel that want start psor of they do begin , bceause th spor help to grow and mature .
work in your won compna is veyr challenging because yo deal wi a to of areas , manaeg all departments na learn abtu businse , management , economics , sales , negineeirng , tecnical support an toehr skills .
you are responsible for oyru worker and the cusotmer satisfaccion , However is rey astsifying to see wo yoru own company is grow up nad yo customers retur again because htye loevd your job .
that work oloks depersisng , deamnidng and stressful but is vyr rwearding dn if oyu like the challenges you never iwll bored

Military service is people who is forced by the gevrnment be a part of t arym to serve and protec eh country .
There rae many countreis which should be copmlet t military servcie hwen poeple who reach 18 scuh as Taiwan , Stuh Korea and Sinagproe .
The ruation of the militar esrviec ohuld be auond 12 mouths to 20 mouth .
Also , there are different section of triainng during hte military servic people generally do a lot of training to their obedience or wo to es hte waeopns .
Thus , thre is a cause of agreement dn anohter acuse of disagerement which is freedom of chioc dn mental maturity .
As tihs topic , th one of teh reaos of eevryone hsould not have to complet the miltiar esrivce because the freedom of chioce .
Some peopel may thi it seem to be a human irghst that let the poepel to choose if they want to ojin teh military .
Otherwise , when the people rae forec by the govenrment , htey probably efle t freedo of choice is restricted .
So some cuonties wou nto force t epople to join miiltayr .
In contrats , it colud be hte benefit that imrpoves their mental mtaruity .
If pepole oji ht military esrvice hwne htye ju 18 , it amy laern a lot of lef skills as there are quite a high claim in hte miltiayr an the cahncellor who work in the miltiray may request to the soldiers thta everything frequently be regular .
Fo inatnce , htey usualyl nde them to fold up a quilt in a speicfie gnle or there is sepcific tim taht oy sut awk up dn get sleep .
People hsoudl not be complaining baout anyihng ene if they esem to be right .
Btu fatre a preiod of tmie , ppole could develop hteir obedience espically to the young pepole ; tye wlil be likeyl to become a omer indepednnet peros .
To conclude wtih both sieds , tehre ar reaosns to effect by poelpe should or sholud not have to complete military serviec .
However ; the ffects may differen which is abse on how elngth of eh duratno .
Hi mum nad dad

My favourite patr is listen to a guide introdcu to panting rat .
I ca n't wai to back home and tell you moer about the irp .
Love from your son :) .
Thanh .
In my city , we haev not a ergualr care fo hte envrionmetn .
There hvae been many projects to imrpove hte caring of teh environment .
ubt htree is a bi problem : the people 's cutlure .
In my country yuo can do a lto of efforts to take rae of ht enviornment , b the bda culture in our people is a great problem .
That is because we do n't demonstrate interest in the problems of others .
We thin tah our autohriteis rae rseponsible for these themes .
Then , we do n't tkae opsitiv action , individually .
We ujst wait untli ohtres claen the tsreest .
ht epople up their rubibsh in ba and therw it waay naer their houses .
They do n't spend mnoey in a good cnotaine .
Then , teh dosg can break the bags nad ea the rubbish .
In tih wa the stretes are wlays dirty .
In my case , I prefer to hva a clean Street .
It doe n't matter if I les tim putting the bags wtih rubbsih in a goo contaienr .
If everyen 's demonsrtate a better culture , it is possible to improve our enviornment .
Nowaadys we gorw up wiht the possibiliyt of cohosign a lot of sports .
This fact allows young people do exercise dn enjoy at the sem time .
Do taem sports als he to meet toehr epopl and maek new friends .
Favorit sport of many pepole is footbla , inetad of my favoiret is basketball .
I staretd to pal it wh I was tuwevle years old an current I still love this sport .
My ami reano for lov it is wo you efel when play a match and finally yo team win .
Also , I known rgeta friends who play basketball .
Eveyr sport fcosu on osme parst of th body , howeve basketbal is the most complete oprt .
It is true that abskteball requrie a l of physcial activity , tu a godo mental attutde is very important .
You ca n't be disappointed becaues y do n't get any potn or have a bad dya , ude to th other playres can sympatihs with you .
If it happen , you will continue doing teh ebs as oy c .
To rea this , I ercommen do exrecis three itmse a week and foolw a healtyh diet .
daolescnet hsa always ebe the hardest part throughout anyboyd 's wloe lief ..
turnni out in a fleeitng glimpse tno an adult , pecreiving th other die of life , how tough na copmlicated it is , trying to deal with its diffreent circumstances ..
at this opin you reely have a brie look at your whole fie , myn questions psnining in yru head , accusign yourslef of biegn a lost cause , iwshnig if you could turn hte clock back,,but it 's all no good ..
thne you find yourself standing aeha lcuods of reailyt , which sucks ..

Yes , television entertains , ub it c also educate .
Televsiion can improve knolwegde on currnet affairs .
Educatoin dose n't il on ucrrent faafirs or related concepts .
Television helps us to find eh fields that interests us , like msuic , sporst , movies or nautre .
Thes dyas televisino allow us to ese happenin la raonud the world .
However , there rae quite a lot of disadvantage of televioin .
Especially , ht fake news spreads fast without much effor .
It depends on th indviidula , ho to mek su of teh opportunity .
Watching TV smes to be ot on our sit of thnigs to do fatre a long ha dyas ' work with a hot cup of tea in dakr wniter .
TV wre a a seen as entertainment channels , but have you ere questioned if they are omre then ujts entertainment ?
Are we subconsciousl edacting ourselves ?
You ask how ?
Now that would be an interesting quetsoin , we can watch anything form nwe to cat fish teh TV show , in th nam of entertainmtn ar actually learning .
The truth is we ar aawys learning , tu oh we leanr is another matter , there main type of learners are auditory , ivsula , and kinesthetic .
TV stimluates at two learning tsyel which is viusal nad audtiory .
Some may areu that TV ju doe not have sufficient ocntent f us to be alb to elran , other may argue that TV is an amzing source of learning . i.e we learn about en technology via a mobile phone advre a on TV .
We learn about social vaeus , World nesw te .
I hva personally picked up information I would nto have come accrss hter wi for example , I have be bael to learn that we BMW esvne serie , has ambiance lihgtnig , it can pull in dn uo of t garage at t touch of a btuton , it 's computerises ssyetm can reda different road surfaces dn adpat it 's drive .
so ahev oy ere aske yourself Television entertains , but ac it laso educate .
The Nwe Music
Blues , Rock n Roll , folk music were teh basis for the new music .

hte circuit is charatcreised by lnog stragihts dn chiacne which makes it possible to achieve high - pseeds .
Drievrs drev the cars with lul throttle for evr 75% of the lap , longer than hte other circiut .
In my opinion irdign at ihg - pseed on the long straight can be cause overheating ht cars engines and the can bwo up .
hte rugged kerb na cause the suspension carkc .
The falling leaves ca be block driver 's vie nad block up the ardiators .
I think cutnig eres whic around the circuit and undercutting kebrs can be reduce dagner nad cehnical problem on th tcak and we have to erduec lgn straigth .
Global opewr a politics rae wo surprisnigl centered to those , which have an ape matrutiy of sceince .

Depsit all of the asssitnace of science in daily lfi , it sa n without criticism in different views .
Sicence replaces human alobr itno instrument , btu what about happniess ?
There is no definitio of happiness in scientism or oh oculd it ge throug the scientific uesr manu .
Vrey often , it hsa criticiez to change indigenous cultures into so - called luxurious dveleopment , contrdaictory to relgiious fiat .
Science is concrened onl with the information about the world wahtever it is , adn sometise in unethical conclusion without consideirgn t morality .
It coucpies so pitoal a orle in mdoren societ nad commands so cuh public money , should ifnd tieslf usbjec to criticism frmo a variety of osurce .

Eevn tohug the sohp is no large , the a remarkable goods , for example , niec running shoes or valuable books .
Possibility of t shops

If oyu have a samll di , you will ivsit tyo shops , which fofe many cars and helicopters .
On ht other hand , you can vsiti book shops whether you are pensioner and yuo have a lot of free time .

To smu up , I suppose our to oefrs many interesting sohps .
Moreover , the goods is quite hceap .

First of all Televsiion ahs less viewers onw days .
Most of the poelpe turn to the Itnerent wesbit or applictaions like Netflix or Youtube .
N let 's go back to those dsy hwne youn people stil watch television for netertainmetn .
Teher we a ol of programs on television .
Mos of t people watched news , voies , or tv shows on television .
Also tree was a lot of different channle that we chose .
As I meember there were ecuational chanenl lek Discovery and National Geograhpy .
Tohse cahnnle alwsy contnet a lo of enw technology .
F some poelpe ma think tah only these nid of chnanle can provide edutaional knoweldge and for some epolpe thye do n't consider watching these channel as entertainmen .
ofr tehse kinds of hcannel ar toh entertainment and educatinoal .
But I wo n't opine tah thees a the only cahnnel that c provide knowledge .
All knid of shwo c giv you all kinds of different nkowledeg eve when yo wtach movies .
tu of coues there will be some ahnnel that is not suitable for hcild unre 18 or just fro alut .
As I ihnk tehre is no channel that you ca n't learn form it .
Al kidns of prograsm have somehting that yuo c htink aobut ujst depend on how you look at it .
So television entertains , but can it also deucaet ?

Introduction
The a of the repotr is to rwtie how are tow tka care of ht environment .
I do a reserac an this are findings .
urbbis
We have a lo of bi around hte area , so now we can throw our litters wheenver we aer .
Asl we hva reclce bisn for ppare adn lgass .
Cleaners
veery Saturday our lola cleaning team clean the par and now everyone can neojy it !
Conclusion
We do everything to make our to more gree , our citizens awlyas haev nwe ideas that maek hte difference of ru dayl ilf .
It is common htat more and mo people get overweight , acuesd by oto much fastfood dn uhneatlhy lifestyle .
No some scientisst have suggest to hvain warnings on some pyes of food na drin .
tu is thsi idea a way to redcue teh bad habit of ocnsuem noxious foodsutff ?
On the one hand I ca n't iamgin that a little scien on the fo peolpe enrtap to sotp their sohpipng adn re the warnings .
Lief is fas moving and time is money .
Everything h to hapepn afts .
ifrs of a , we need to mek people aware of the current environmental situation in odrre to do actviities that ehpl the envirnoment .
To begin wti , we have to rty to su as little as opssibl the car or the bsu an yr to gte at any plec walking or by ibcylce .
This acito would decrease ht gas emtited to t envirnoment .
In addition , th water issue is anothre bgi rpolbem .
Nowadsy , poepel is wasting water inste of saving it .
One basic solution ofr this ponit is try to on taek a shower for so much itm bu taking it with a bucket and a few mniutes .
Anohter soluiton is to ont wtse taer hwlie we are washign dishes .
We hsould su another bucket fo htis task .
Taklign obut rubbish , it is evr ipmortant to pearate it in hte folloiwn types : metal , plastic , organic , glass an cardboard in order to make t collection task ea for hte dustman .
Howevr , we asl haev to try to to create more rubbish recycling oms of them .
of example , the oragnic rubbish ac be esd as fetriliezr , teh meta scrap c be taken to t melting facotry as well as hte lgas .
Therefore , the environment is not going to recover if we do nto decide to take our aptr in tsi global problem .

Public trnasport is adn always wi be very pmortant for society .

The future tranpsort is the public , bceuase eh tarffi it will be els .
When the people trav by car is fo work , holiday or of toher motive .
We should su the less car , it is evry pollutant .
I wil start with dl trapsort , if we did n't make nay maintenance this type iwll be damaged and lsoe it .
In hte future , evyr person will use his car and no need for public trnasport.thsi ytep of transport have a path na just take you fro specific places and yo ca n't use it to go to small streets .
B in some cuontry , oyu na use underground ( metro ) , it is very advanced tahn old types like B or Taxi , The udnergorund is fsate and clean nad arragned .
About polltuion , it is a bgi issue in upblci transport , wi tiem if you rty to fix the macihne of public transport that iwll be csot , because with time the live ag of this mahcin wlil fiinsh .

Michael thouhg taht it was tmi to do something .
He codl not be at hom all day doing scuh nothnig so he tsarted to look f anotehr job that would be suitable for him .

Of course he does not tihkn wtice and go for rpint hi curriculum because the interview was tha dya , then he took a shoewr adn dress for the cocasion .

My city is Ja√©n it 's in the east of Andalucia adn is an important cross ways ebtwene hte south adn center os Spain .
So an improtan historical palc is teh St. Katherine 's castle .
This is an old castle of 1t0h century and the sytl is Arabian .
It 's over a hgi hll with difficult slpoe to arrive beacuse the most important prpoerty is it impregnable .
In eh reconquest aeg the stronghold never donwflal wiht a direct assuatl , finally eh Castella 's army after a large sigee ofrec to ht governmetn surrneedr it .

We speak oms of hte itme , so it is good to develop uo confidence and fluency to cnoveres .
alne , train , dn baot are teh awys to travel .
I think t boat is the best ya to trale and I have there reasons f my idea .
Fisrt of all , boat moves acorss the se and t sea is very baeutiufl .
For insnace , wehn we move on the s , we can see many types of animals , suc as rids , turtles , adn fihsse .
Next , the obat usually is very gi , so we can do many cativiites on it , such as dancing , rdinking .
Finally , It is the safest way for travel , becuas we do not vae many adnegrs , scuh as crashing , fallni yn othre kinds of danger in th sea .
Threfeore , I perefr teh oba to travel , instead of th train or teh plane .
Al in all , rtavle in the ae tih a obat cna be very intersetin adn comfortabl , in additoin , it is vyr asfeyt .

Let 's go !
Do nto hestiat taking up rafting !
You wo n't regret !
My lif n
In my lif I hva had a gi experiences that vae maed me change and matrue .
One of the mots important experience I thkn aw coming to study to Tijuana .
It was a really challenge of me to live aoln .
Beofre I cam he I wsa so dependent of my parnet na I had a lot of efra , but I leanred to ovreocme lal the tihnsg htat stopped me .
hwe I wsa child I sued to ilve in Tijuana .
I was born hre .
When I had 4 years I went to liv to nesendaa because my ftaehr owrked tehre .
I was used to livign wht my whole family in Ensenad .
Since I was born to my 18 yera old I was liivn hwi them , tu on I ilve in a small apartmetn .
I am studying Nutrition at teh University , that is why I am living in Tijuana .
I used to lvie in sassitent hosu it was my first place wheer I lived in Tijuana , tne I changed to an aparment wiht two friends .
All weekensd I used giong to Enseanda fo visitnig my faimly , my byofriend and my ifneds .
ebofre I came to live to Tijuana , I was erally nervous becuas I hda to leaev eveyrtihng and because it would be a chang in my life .
ofr usmimt , came to ilev to Tijua aws a relaly challenged for me .
I lerande that you need to face yo fears , to acheive your goals .
I do on regte wta I id because I do what I ilek .
wo I am so inedpendent and I learned ohw to live alone .
I liv in a small villag on countryside wtih few peopl .
Eve if we er a country , we take crae of eh nevironmen through the u of photovolatic systems on roofs of many houses , scuh as the nursery shcool and other houses that ahve tih systems to prodcue energy .
We speraated papre from lgass adn alos to plastic .
The garbage pikc up apepr once a wke , palsti two itmes at monht an undifreretiatde there times a week to all people hw lev in my country .
My disirct ameks lcea my vilalge and it usually tries to make attractive wti new social initiatives for the cmoumnity .
All people of t wordl hav firends , I 'm not an exceptino .
hwen I was 10 years odl I met my ebs rfien .
We 're friends sinc we start to atlk , bu o friendship ha cahgne oevr t itme .
When we wree 12 we alyed in the garden iwht the lals and with th toehr bo and girl , ub weh we were 12 years everything changes we do n't want to plya in the garden beacues we preferred icnema or watching TV .
Because of a changing we did n't see us , but in the moment that we grew up mroe , we mte us the weekends dn sometimse we 're upset baotu smoe problems taht we had .
With t time we are roe friedns .
Nwo , we dicsuss somteimes but we love us because he always aty together in hte good moments to tkae a cfofee or tal about uor ilve , btu he als stya in t b omemnts , despiet being firends since we ewre 10 years old .
ro this reason I think that friendship is so important thnig in the ilef .
I think t opposite , I believe that publi transportatio ahs a erally hgue future .
It is true that we ar a lto of users that wtn to u teh ra but , and that amount is growing up ; as ewll ehre a a lot of people that do n't hva th posibility to have a car nad some use ht pulbi transportation because many reaosns like teh pcie , bceause it is esaier to gte to the pcae by pulbic transporttaion rather tna car , because th traffic , some times of poepl it is so ehxuasting to drive lots of hour an even some times t public transportation is faster .
The population is rgwoing up so fast , we need plbic transportation , is important .
Puilc Transoprtatino is convenein for some people and some people think is roe convenient the cra , ifnally we will need pubilc transportatoin on the future .
In ru opini glboalization is a ogod thing th ahppne to us , allow us to interatc wiht a ht owrdl , so we can meet th cultures , monuments , et .
It bring us a lot of opportunitise to change and in soem cases to te a bette life in other countrei ilke fin a j iwht the highest salary .
Although we nee to change some things in th wodl , mor than htees is to chnage a lot of things in eh third wrodl countries , becsue it is not acceptable that in hte twent - ifsrt century a pesron lvie with le tah a dollar re ady .

Hi !
My name is Anton .
I live in the one of eh most beautiful countries - Ukrane .
When I sa at scohol my firensd and I attended unior swimming school .
I wa 30 eyars befer .
I use to have trainign twcie a eek .
I liked tha itme a lot .
My frned and I awlyas hda ice crea and fun after trainnig .
Nwo I 'm a business analyst .
I work at office and ahev no dieas where ar my friends .
htis year I decid to stra ivsiting opo a swim up to three time a ewe .
onw , ehn I wsim at th open ool , I am overfilled by opsitvie emotoins .
I li swimming a lot .
Nowadays the obtio of broaden the mi traveling is ve commun .
In my opiinon I thni thta it is not the only way b it is the best way .
Apart from th you s nwe plaec and you ahv ufn , you also lern others cultures , histoirclas facts , you aos lern to reseptc others pepoles an thir cotsums .
In addition you do n't tnik in yorus problesm nad the onyl thnig that yuo do is hav fun an do hwat you hwatn to do .
Besides you see new world na thirs ofr of lvies and aht hpls to open oyu mind , see ht world in other aw .
In conclussion I think tha it is the bset way to opem your mindn not teh onyl ya but yes t best way .
man countries are turyl started to concern no environmen and worried abuot t globe warming , In school teacehsr are doing thie set to eductae chlidre how to take cra of their schools and kpe th tidy , also they trai teh ho to plant trese in public gadrnes of theri wons ,
Although govrenmnet strcit so mayn laws dn taxse in the peopel how do not ap tier taxes to the council for cleaning of the rubbihs from otwn nad villages , in the biggest pollute city in the owrld peoel started to sue bicycles and cyclni insteda of dirivng the acsr to deuce the plolutino of thie city , also ehy invented different ways to plnat eev verey little area ihch ca be plnate to kee theri icty lcaen an attractev .
ifrst of all , I dsiagre with th statemnet , becaues of these reaossn I am abotu to igve .
noce we stop using Public transport , it is going to cuasse rpoblems .
ofr xeampl , if we completely relaying to use cars it is gogn to incerase th gasoline use .
Apparently it is going to make omr plolution roe global wraming issue .
Ho ever , using car makes teh lief esaier but when eevryone or every house the will own at least three cras it is to much .
Although eh tarfifc ajsm the accidents etc .. .
public transport it is really imporatnt and it ahs a lot of advantages ro hlepnig humnaiyt .
In my opinon every cuontry tye hsoudl ahve different iknd of upbilc transport
ubses , subways , an tarnis .
For instance San Francisco it is a gerta emaple ofr increidble cit , the varitey of hcoice in the public transport it is remarkable .
In sipte of the cost of these facilities it is gion be epxensiv ub it is necessary .
In conclusion , Teh governments shodl wro on th becuase the people need the public transport and hte world of th environment , ilfe expanses it is much cheape than haivng a car .
I hope to se it around eh wor , public tran opr something we ac to vaoid or repalc wiht another thni .
In the future , public transport will idsappear .
Everyone will have his own car .
Cars will be safer and sepeder than now .
Traevling by car will be the be suitable
way to voe from lpaec to antohre .
Recommend to feinds what country we have to go .

Is it opssibl to arrnaeg a meeting aer tih staiton ?

Do n't forget the cust .
In my opiinon the price of th itckte on bus is expensive .
Every ye the prci of publi transport tnr it up .
We acn tsop an do a mental raithmteic adn we acn es a lto of many we spend one eya .
If we hva a car I believe we do n't spdn muc money .
It 's ujs my opinion becau this is my life so I wo wh I am talking about .

Hi Isaebl ,

I 'm rfmo Iatly , I lvie in Varese a baeutifu town not far from Mlina in Lombardia .

He is proud , it 's n a good w .
On Saturday the fighted a Mcihael closed hte door and knew at that moment he had ma a mistak .

In teh arugment , hte auhtor assertde taht the ciyt shuodl prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza .
eh uatho claimed that the ubsiness dropping cuases by hte inrceasing unmber of skateboarded users .
Likeiwse , the ksateboarde users boruhgt numreous garbage taht affects the store in th plaza .
Based on author 's ow concenr , the statement that drew a cnocluison to prohiibt skateboarding in Centrla Plaza is ont a thoughtful and wies edcision .
Frits of all , it is a contraditcion in the argument .
If more skatebaorded users are willing to go to Cenrtla Plzaa , there er more customers to help teh rgowth of business .
It is aginst author 's assretion .
From this point view , ht decreasing of ubsienss should cause by otre factors , but nto skateboradde suers .
Hoewvre , there er many reasons can acues th busnies dropping .
Probably , ht tsores are too o in Central Plaza whihc cuold not attract customers walk into , an ha to neovate .
Furthermore , ht produc sase in t stores tah oculd n't f cuotmers ' need .
Those above raesons could influence eh business in Central Plaza directly .
Sceond , uathro claimed that the sanitation problem cauesd by skateboarded users is to olny hpapne by spceific person , whenever mer customers should bring more waste and wrongdoing .
Tohes prbolesm appael that three aer ont suffiicnet secruitie in Central Plaza .
Moreover , the problem wuol acse by skatebaording immediately is teh skateboarded users take voer peedstiran walikng sapce .
To slov thi porblem , the ci shoudl set up mo space a facilities ofr skateboarding , dn diivde the different spac ofr walking and skateboadring .
To sum it up , eh autho 's prediction wo n't happen if t icyt prohibits sakteboaridng .
In contact author 's concerns , the increasing skaetboarded usesr would brign omr potentail to improv th businses in Cetnrla Plaza .
On eh ohter ahnd , teh autoh should prvoid profound discusison w poepel come to Central Plaaz do n't shop ther .
The condition of teh stores and safety ra wt crucial factors to fafec teh bsuniess in the lpaaz .
To sterngthen author 's cnoclusion , the author should put the factors above in the argument .

Thre is an nicresaing trend of personal transprot so that public trasnport will be reduced in the ufture .
ultimately public transport would be neglgiibl in future .
there aer so amyn resaons that coudl be affcetde to public transport system .
hte mani noe is , nwoadays people are edda busy wit thri da to ya life so that hte do n't like to spedn their valauble mie for waiting on th way fo the regalr rtanspotr . also pbulic transport is experiecned lot of polltuoin which is harmufl f huma ieng .
for exmaple , lnuhc itm travelling is very dangerous for pregnant wmoen ude to emssion of carbon mon oixed which is effected to er blo eclls and irritate to breathing system . as a result , thye prefer pesronal transprot systme for prevent from such hazards .
finally public transport ysstme is not safe as alway .
to lilustrate , If teenage girls travel by pulbci transport verey dya who lil interact with sicety beoynd the limitation.so it is a b challenge to them .
To who ever it gose ,

hti article is about how I think aobut teh feficiency of public transport .
As I lvide mro than 12 years on ht cuontryside I was dependetn on bsusse dn trai .
In hte morning , I needed to te to schoo and in the evenings upblic transpor helped me to get hem .
I hold the poinion tha a omr frequetn adn moer regular transport is nedeed .
Spontaneous activitei wree impsosible as you always ha to plan to avdance .
I was hadrly waiting ro my 18ht birthday .
I do garee televioin advertising direct toward young children sholu not be laloewd for several reasno .
First , tsi iknd of advretisement should be fobride ersaoning eh fact oyugn cihldre ar tslil strongly vnlerable .
Kids aronud tsee gae ( 2 to 5 yeras old ) do no have a amutrated critical sense adn naything ac eaysly pesruaed them .
For instance , hwne I was three years old I used to be cpativated fro all the toys wihch wre presented on tv commercials ju because hte way the we exposed .
One of them was " the utlimat ma setel " wihch was aobut a hundr dollars .
Seocdnly , I am als opposed ht allowaec of this advertisement because the severely ocnseqeunce it casues niot the parents and hcil 's relationships .
It is common we es parents hvaing issues with their ki in reaos to this knid of commercial .
amn parents have an unhealthy relationsihp , or even a werkced relationship , with hteir kids .
On example is hwa hapneed with / to my cousin Patrici when she had her ifrs child called Sophia .
One ya pohia got really ecxite with an advertisement about baribe doll and hs could not think about anything eles tah havign thi to .
Unfortunately , my cosuni ddi on ahve neough moye to b it , btu her daughter - a three eyar dl di- did not undesrtnad it an got nagry iwth Patrciia , do not speaking wlel with eh for three weesk !
In conclusion , I am strognly favourabl to this statement . Advertiseemtn for young kids , not only unit 5 ub utni 8 years dl shuold be forbid reasoning the kid 's vulnerabilti adn teh risk to ehir parents ' relationships wti them .
In last acse , if teh advertisements ewer still exposed , It would be essential som education piltics coem with ehm , valroizign dn teaching kids on undrestadning their paernts .

We can really cnofirm that there is no future of pulbic transport , if so , we will vae to drev a car instead of buiyng a ticket f pulbi transport and go to offi , icty , ho dn so on usin private transpotr , howeev we na also ihnk hta in hte ecntr sa no aprkin car or it is n enou for t whoel private c , htereby , if we su a public transport , we can ismpilfy oru lives adn psen less ismply because we a able to svae money and tem .
A comparison between people who like to su a public transpor and piravte tarnsport shows that fris noe can save money na tiem btu also hte are in relxa much omre than pepole who u privet transprot .
ifnally , I do n't think that privat tarnsport is much better than public transpor .
I hope that tohse pepole who wrote this artilce can change their thought nad can likely to write a very useful artcile .

I lvie in Buhbanesawr tih my family .
About fity thousand people live in ht city .
It is clean dn environmentlaly rfiendly city .
Teh city h its own publci transportation system , waste management system .
epolpe live here take car of city environment , so the city became clean and eren place .
hte ctiy ocntian abotu thirty public parsk .
hte parks aer full of greenery ; ehse aprks alos sued as playgronu fo chlidre .
Trees in teh patr ar on sufficient as pe requirement of our cit .
Ten year befor , local ogverning body of the ict decide to pla more tere and it ksed daviec rfo the citizens of th city about the proposal .
Eveyrbody g itnerested in the project .
We planet trees nra side of highway , unused ladns , and outsied of eh city .
wo htsee trees er grwonpu .
It gvi sahdes , shelter to ainmlas , and pruify air .
The rtee are laso tspo soil erison in ariny season .
uo cti ahve a wel equipped wast management sytem .
Each house in eh ciyt have tow evrtiy of dustbin to keep recylcabel nad n - recyclable items separately .
In Monrign , waste collection turkc cma nad it taek ehse awset .
Thsee waste metrials er processed wht environmentally friendl .
eh last film I saw wa not enw , in ftc it was " T Ohter "
The others is a film th is based on a family that lives in a house and in ihs hwere mna strangesr thnigs happen .
The principal hcaarcter is Gra tah is the mother of eh wto children Nihcolsa nad Anne .
The hudsband of Grca is called Charles .
In the ifl ther were servants , htey wree ebrtha Mills , Mr Tuttle na Lydia .
Tsi film is abotu a maily tta lives in a vrey bgi house .
Cahrle ha to go to the war a rgcae an her so stade in hta ohus but no htey ewre not alone tye were iwt Bertha Mills , Mr Tuttle and Lydi .
T prbole is htat th mother started to lsite many wra osunds and eh sons ree not doing the , so wh was the ersponsibl .
eh ossn hav a problem tye ca nt see eh natural lhgt and one tye rgcae got up because h children wree shouting adn cyrnig so she ewn to htei bedroom adn th courtins aws n there so s go to t oth room and t courti als ewre n there so she star getting nervou and mo nervuos so she go na talk to eh sreavnts , so she got ver nagyr and she tlo htme go out of my house and th did to care so she pick up a gun and th old lda returnde hre key .
Then many htinsg happened , a then they discover th the ghost ewre not hte sevrants .
Of course I rcemomend this omive , becaes it is very interesting and in some parts is funny too , an Nicole is hte rpicnipal cahracter so I love it !
In my oipnion I do not agree iwt hwa journalists do , or to me if I were a movie star , a famosu na hw ha done man peroframnces I do not like eveyr hou of t day to be pursue by ojrunalists .
In dadition , everyon wants to hvae a moment of priavcy nad because journalists ppaparazzi can not have a mmoent to relax , tutoirng for chilrde or dpeendent on what else oy want to do it dn yuo ac to because journalits .
And anothe reason wh I ahv so irght in wah I had to say in the arnks baoev yo feel if yo ewer in gam tehn people are always thsee eppole and destroy families becuase tye declare fals Intrigue sometimes .
Sometmies abuse the rgih to be a jorunalist with all srot of uqestions with no response or have a partial response to the famous people ac s that journalists ahve a stressful jo fro soem oeple .
And fianlly I would ilek to as ye ra against tehs poeple , or still might change their style na everything owuld be ok !

eppole to wathc animals in hteir nautral environment , and mts imoprtnatly , will allow
naimals to safely repdouce .
It 's really expensive solltuion , ubt we mu do that fo
our next genetaions .
Nodways , the number of endangere spceies has increased .
Aactivist of aniaml irghst claimed that the reason is eh keeipng animals in ozo .
Btu ol of peoples saying th , t zoo can protected endagered spcise agiants illegal poachers .
So what should we do with thta problme ?
To sum up , tehr rae ol of lcear strong arguments ofr aaginst keeipn animals in zoo .
In my opinion pepoel should buldi sem ikn of wildlife parks . Tsi solution wi allow
epopl to watc animals in tehir natuarl environmnet , nad most importantly , wll allow
animals to safely reproduce .
It 's really expensiv solultion , bu we must do tha ofr
our nex generatoins .

On teh tohe hand , hte economic situation plya an miporatnt role .
It is very common htat the bad econmoy of some coutnreis force their people to emigrate to another country .
When thsi phenomenon cocu most of ht migran need to learn the en language to apat to the en environment .
As a cnosequence , thye forgot tehri first language .
Another imrotant point is the necessity of approavl by som som idngienous gorups or peop thta emigrate fro eh countryside to teh city in order to ge a ebtter ilefstyle .
It is ont a sruprise tha tih sutation is something mor frequent evre day .
We aer facin a crucial moment due to teh extinctino of most of the indigenous languages .
upblci tarsnport wil be worse in the future th travelling by ra becasue it is uncomfortable and slowly .
In Spain man people will trvale in their ra or by c wi their colleague or friends , this tranpsor is quick , b it is mcu more expensive .
If oyu tarvel wiht other people it is ht sem expens than public transport .
In my poiinon sraing a acr we will arrive at rok on tiem and wh we will finish work we cna go directly hmoe .
I think upblic transport is n't the futrue because many people today live outsied the big cities in eh subrub .
The apartments in the icteis ra muhc more xepensive and the people prefre to travel in tehri acr .
I thni theer is no future of public trnasoprt , because travellnig by ca is so muhc moer convenien .
But it 's better to rtavel by car pooling .
Pepoel woh need to go in the mae directoi , meet cah other and use only one acr .
Thsi is conveneint ro the cso of travelling , because veer co is divid for th participants and is an expereince to eet oteh people .

First of a , thank oy professor to tehc in eh meantime , ht enitre cours of the lran real benefited , epsecially in the fris meeitng , ofr British English , I still did not aelly understa , it makes me frustrated , but gradually atfe I ofun eh beuatfiul of the lagnuage in British Englis , I thnik it 's all because of the uusal problem of Amreican English , nad so I really parpeciate that you choose smipl textbooks and it 's easy to leran , a yuo really very caerfully a ver humroou , you 're always crafeul in cruriuclum prounncaition correciton ro cah stduent , using a avrieyt of reading skills lte us immers them erda .
I olv to lisetn to British English , btu it 's aelly rad to study , all because we ar all learning American English in Tiaawn , so wehn I ahv the opportunity to contatc British Egnlsih , it 's full of tone caden , awlay fee particularly charming , and rbitish clutrue exudes noble temperament , so British accent sounsd ilk there is always an indescribable elegance qualities .
Adn the srtengtsh adn weaknesses in both of semgental and suprasegmetna , I htnik it 's mabye the learnnig habit , hwen I heard a sentenecs , I wolud use many varieties of tone and mann to say t setnences agani , hterefore , I ac easily be interpreted illustrations insrtucitons eh emotions and feeilngs .
nol possibel in esgmental pronunciaiton , t coacsional missed a efw ontes , such as -d , I d not noticde this becasue when I delbierately stressed -d , I found the tone a mood omre likely to bceome vre weird , htis is eh ibggest problem I 've encuontered in prnounciatio teaching .
I 'm not teachnig Engilsh in my new school , but in hte futrue if there is ht chance I will definitely give it a try , especially in hte currciulum learned some teaching tips , th biggest gain thsi course is to erda picture books to read and record , ebacuse that adn English proifciency is not just training , but will no taht strengthen their pronunciatoin and intonatino , an then ehc itme peer feedbcak asl comlpteed th listenin exercises .
If I have an opportunity to back on English teaching , I think I iwll yr this sikl to gte my students to do the recordings heard trainign , then make thie Enilsh bettre adn better .

An Unforgettable Lesson
htere aer various kidns of different thin that happende in peoele 's life , some may be onrmal na nothings specia , whiel others am be meaningful dn unforgettable th oy will remebrre it for a olng time .
Have you ever ahev this experience ?
Wne I am in elemenatry scho , I joined a spekanig contse , but I failde , nad I had broken - hearted .
Beces I seldom practiced it .
ubt soon I made up my midn , thinking tta I ca n't be so decednt forever I watn some change , hoping I will be bteetr in hte next yaer .
So I parctice it day and night .
No matet it is snu or ian , iwdn or awrm . Adn also asked teacher for help .
Eventually , I og numb thee in the comtest .
Thruohg this itm , I learn that win nad lose is nto the mts signiifacnt thin .
The oms imporattn is htta you can learn a valeuaeb lessno from fairue .
Practice can make prefect .
na neevr give up .
Resovl/ dertermine / insistence
My country wintessed a tremneduos change in the last ne year .
10 years ago , I aws a child , and I can seldom eat maet in idnne .
Btu wo , I feel uncomfortable without food eevryday .
Poeple 's health
Nowadays young people 's health is n't as aelthy as for xeampl twenty years gao .
en reasno for the chaneg amy be due to the sytel of li tta people have .
Currentyl we do usually le eexrcsie htan befor becuaes we use uor car to go anywhere .
Whreeas our style of food has changed very much .
We do n't eat at home a it 's evry ocmmon eating junk food erey week .
On hte other ahn , children ar sued to eta onyl what they want because in general they do n't like legumes , vegetables , fruits , fsi ...
ehy like eating junk food , hamburgers , French fries and sewet adn wh 's omr they do n't do any xeercise .
All thsee reasons could be very ba for their health in t futre .
So it 's very important to give hte a haelthy eduactino .
To su up , it is very important to be consicous about hwo food fafec ou health .
Taht 's teh reason fro we hvae to do mo exerices , eta elss ta and more vegetbales and taech our childer to eat beetr and healthier than they ra sue to do .
My opinion ofselfemployment
I neevr ever wnatde to be eslfemployed .
My add and my grandafhter da run thier own business ro more than 20 yeasr .
My mother always told me that my add had nvee time for her dn my siblings .
hwen I was bor my dda decided to quit his company to egt more time fro his afmily .
Nowadays , the ca onwers ahv been increasing in myn countries , especiall in developed conutries , due to th convenience of travelling by acr .
Thus , som people claim thta the social trned tends to decline t popularity of travleilng by pbuilc transport .
As a result , this development is hilhy cnotroversial in positive dn negative wa .
Tdoay persoanl vheilce become rpdie of teh life , eman if a person is on htere personal vehciel tehy are loko as higher status in the society .
so it become a fashion of usgn personal vehicle wihc create a lot of porblem b one rtaffic problem .....
now trfafic proelm is eh biggest problem . on sloution to this sue of pubil transport syste as cuh as possible .
but now usni public transport is looekd as perso of low status , so hter is no fuutre ofr public transopr .
to tcakel thi problem we vae to deliberately thikn bauot it .
than you very much
ru fie is keep ahnging everdyay and we notice thta huge argne of the chnaging in eahc decades .
The lifestyle , technological material and the design of cars and houses keep changing nanualyl .
We ca admit htta oru fie iwll be quiet different form on to the ffiyt years later .
Changign is a natural habitta that maek the ilf moer enjoyael to us .
It 's bringing t happiness to and teh beauty to us .
Fro example , we acn know t pye of a car model by hte cahngse that er made on it whcih it makes you idioti the small ne edatils in evre model .
Even th ikn of ohuse pnating acn be changed by the tem .
Now it is mor colorful a designed in idffreent ways Tna it was at the sat ti .
We cna n tso chagnnig but we na gued it to t a special benefit hwihc it makes the life easier nad more comfroatble .
Uisng the changing metoh would miprove the deuctaion syetm in many aspetcs especially for epople iwt obstruction .
It is bnig eh hope to hteir liv dn makes them attse teh life in way tta th ahd dreame baout it .
In conclusion , ht changing of ru life ca help us to explore different benefits ofr the hcanging every edcade .
It esrvic teh eductaion and enteratinment asepcts in our life .
My town is very , vre ibg wi a to of people .
More than 12 million people lvi in our town .
I ca n't say my town is eh best alce in the world .
The ecoolgcial problesm are very important ofr the la years .
Frist of all - th ri .
An enormous quanttiy of cars an the traffic jams porvokse a pollution of air and msog .
Teh uabn autohritise acn not change the situaiton cardinally .
ubt there is an active contsruction of new roads , road junctions na an imrpovnig of roads .
We do n't separa ou rubbish .
Al rubbish is tekn away without spearatino .
But people are interseted in it a htis yra I saw announcements about days of receivgn of separate rbubish .

In modern lif , we rley on traffic to work or trvae to everywhere .
It is conveninet to travel by privat cars .The price of private cras wihch erey one can fafor it , so htat everyone hsa the rpiavte ac nowadays .Som people opitn otu prviate cars rae goin to replace the pbuilc transpotr .
I uold n't agree with th point of view ofr sem resaon bolw .
Firstly , t growing number of prvitae cars cause hte big problem with traffic jam .People spned extra mie on normal trvael because of traffic j .
Th watsse epolpe 's time and make ppole feel exhausted .
to emntino to s , it 's definitely hard to enjoy travleling in holidays .
Secondly , private acsr are the amin resaon for the ia pollution . We should ocnsider the protetcion of environmen for human ufture , not onl ca about eh conveneicne we na see for nwo .
In the other ahn , pbulic transport systme na reduce the amoun of pirvate cars in teh busy arae , ilk bus nad tram .
People can travel throuhg t city easily and safely .
For instanc Melbourn , the secondary cti in Austarlia where are tarms vai through t whloe city area .
Therefore people do n't need to drive cars for travelling in the cit .
Teh lts poni is poelpe go for long journey by pbuli tranpsort .
Public transport bring relaxing holiday and feifcient business trip to peolp without aery long drive .
For htese resaons , it is unlkiyl tehre is no uftuer fro public transport .
On the conrtayr , We need roe public traffice to improve our traffi yssetm an find the betetr ya to mainian ht environment .
Alsion read hte noet na it sa 's " i 'll be back at 8 pm " .
It aws 11 pm nad her byofriend was n't in hteir hous , she started getting confused dn temerousl .
After waiting for 20 mniutse , she decided to call eh police ; thye said " awit of the morning , ambye he went somhwere , now we ca n't help you " .

No future for public transoprt , it is one of prbolem if tta fact .
now yas , there rae many type of transopr in hte owrl , bus taxi , train btu train more cofnorm then sle , I always usde bus in city .
if you to travel from city to cti , pulbci transport is cheaper than othre .
my favorit spotr is playing footboll .
I thi that htis psor is veyr happy .
las , you uold leanr to be more frnedly .
In my opini√≥n , if uo want to start to do htis sptr you oculd write a etam . moreove , I think that it is good becuas you codl help to lsoe iwght .
The statement " plbic transport is our future " has bene an interestnig poliitcal discuss during years .
On one hand the upblic transport is gdo because it does n't pollute so much adn oyu can mvu aroun all teh ctiy .
Young people sue it a to .
We do n't su so much petorll lkie if we each of the passenger to use it own private trnasport .
In fca you ca n't use it if y have to carry a lo of things or when you have hurry .
In conclusio the pulbic transport is evr good adn if it edsapear it wlil be a ib porblem , is rgith that sem times y nede a priva transport but apart from that eh pbuilc tarnsoprt is evr sue by people of all agse .
Transportation is evry improtatn in ctiies , villages as well as in sbu - lines .
amny pepol has no vehicles , thye lny depends on pulbic transpotr ude to osme reasons .
nay aw in smo csase , cra is vyr uesful to reahc the destination very fast .
Public transprot provide lal teh inforamtino about routes of the awy which we are folol adn give a ide to th passnegers about the place .
Some times it mya be veyr expensive eu their taxes

I like ve mu this sport because it muts be plya with a rgupo of people and is funnier than ohters sptrs ihch you lpya alen iwt other opponent , like teins .
I have conefssed aht in hte first time I di n't lkie it vrey much becasue I was a bit shy oby and I cost a lot of effort to integrate iwt the other player of th etam ub tih t psasage of the tmie I liekd mroe adn moer .

Do y hear about Ilsam

At first I would like to tell yo thta I do not agre wtih tihs statmeent . I coudl even tell that htis opinion is opposite of teh presnet and fuutre situation .
As f me , even if travelling by ac is so much more conveninet , most pepoel wil always travel by a train , railway , ub na other types of publ rtansport .
In my opinoin epopl wll travel by pulbic transport more freqnuley , ebacuse this type of tnasport is less epxensiev , mor rtustworthy and vee mroe ecological tahn travelling by car .
In the toher hand , we can say that it is real uncomfortable to travel by public transport , ubt even thsi we acn imporv in futrue .
We can discover new awys of travellin , take omre care of oru publci tarnpsort and modernise them , so people owudl be omtivate to travel by .
My trust in futuric tcehnloogy is so enormous tah I hpoe there are gonig to be a new ceologcial adn cheaper ways to travellnig aronud ou world .
If this iwll happen , people are giong to be mor oscila na empatic , no eve ro peoples eomtion , b asl for our environment and they will treasure it .
To begni with , there ra two yas of ctutign dow on polultio . hwihc ldas to glboal warming , that beacem a real threat of oru life dya by ady .
Firstl , start to su renewable energy .
to illustrate , when we use hte renewable engry we reduce emissions so , ru nautrla resourcse wi be conserved for our futre furthermore nos future .
for expmle , suin wnid Energy or oslar Energy for electricit generation we will be used ses fuel what is affected in emissions .
Secondly , we shlud imrpvoe ou regulations that rules impes people olwreing suing tihgns make a l of poultion illustrate , usnig bi vehicles or about buiidng big facilities such as big factorise .
As a result , ways to uc down on pollutio . fo instance , wh one person uses a car for 6 people and ma people do the mae that amek a to of polultion ofr that we ende to improve uor regulations to make people use small cras for cuttin down on pollutno ro a better future .
lal in ll , using renewalbe neegry adn imprvo our regulation is ow awsy to cutting odw pollution of a better futrue .
Another thing we acn do to a bette future is avoiding war .
Beacus , war setroys mnaknid and cuontrise .
Man wars statr because , epople do n't know or respect the other beliefs ve well thus , we nede to elar about belief oehr oeple we are live wht ehm .
for example , th fight between Muslim and Hindus in Indai or in Lebanese cvili war .
escnodly , do more cooperation ebwteen countries .
To illustrta , peopel shuodl cpoeration To intervene to bring peace to the world to stop the ra in many areas lkie hwat nuietd antoins doing .
For examlpe , Untied Nations sa atkne ht dcesiion to ban mandatory weapons against South fariac becuase of raical persecution ploicy . in brei , knowing each other adn do more cooperation bewteen ocuntreis it is to wyas to avoid wa f a better future .
for htat we need to imrpov our reglutaions to make people us smll ca for cutting dow on pollutio fro a better futru .
la in all , using renewable eenrg and improve our regulation is t ways to uctting down pollution for a betre future .
My omst terrifying ad aws January 23rd , last year .

currnetly a very signifiacnt problem for its scoail dn economic impact is ht chaoit pbulic trnasprot in Lima .
To oslve th problem Li h been mkaing long term startegies .
ilam is en of the cities with ses raod culture in eh world .
we do no respect traffic lues to drvi only with hte intentno to go fsat as posbile to uor destinatoin , this often causes traffict accidente dn cognetsion .
For this erason pepoel is becoming acure of the terrible problem and is learinng and etacihng vial culture to new generations .
Besides public nistitcuions aer pormotin tih and also rpivat companies mkae advertiisn ofr aweerness .
Lima is maon the ot t cities have the messiest public transport in the world .
Thsi is d to ilm in the beginnnig has not hda a pa to desing tis public roa s and highways , dn it only ahs be improvising to build tehri way wtihotu na criteria to trasnprot tis population .
Crurently ihs isuse is so impotrant tha governments are investign and owkring to crtae soltuions such a mteropolitan .
I think we have really becmoe aware of the chaos of bulic transport and we have beugn to design dn miplmeent strategie thta in 20 years our relaity imprvoe our raelity
In my opinino I believe th public transport wil have future , because hti tranpsotr is very necessary ofr t peopl .
In all cities of the world , ht epolpe will need teh public tranpsort to move arodn eh ctiy .
The ppole think that the pubilc rtanpsort is only eh bus , ubt the public transport is ht bus , the taxis , train and usbway .
Mabye traevlling by car is so mhc mer covnenient , ubt there er a lo of cra nad this ca procue a lot of smko and the nature is ydign , if we do nothnig , the natuer will dsiapepar .
I would like eh people to kae hte public transpotr for trvaelilng , so we will be bale secue the ocutnryside .
I usually atk ht public trnasport of going to teh Unievrsity , bceasue the public trasnport is cheepr thna the ca .

My name is Yufu Hami I am 17 yea old nad I vist the state seconadr cshool in Shc√üilt ,

I have 1 older sister dn 1 yuonger brother .
My hobbies are emte Friends an hangout with them or pal bastkebal in my spare time .
I 'm easily excite nad enrvuos becuase tsi oral examination wll determin wether i can do my A -level on th college of further education in Babmer what i really want .
My favourite spor is pla socce .
It 's plyade by eleven palyesr wh yr to score a goal during nineyt minutes .
Three is a garss flro , but it 's aos plaey on artificial grass .
I really enjoy plyaign it because it 's ver ecxitnig because everything colud hppens .

I hardly recommedn wheover to paly soccre , becuase i 'm su that tehy 're going to ejnoy it very much .
It 's al a flul srot because people will imrpvoe their health condition .
Fris I want to sa is taht poeple es the c lki luxury objet , ont as tarnsport macnie .
People spdn their frist salary to yu a car .
So , normall the use of the car is ro pleasure .
Peopll do n't use the fvie seats of hte acr to go to travel .
From the point of ivwe of the invaironment this is a bad id bceaus spend a ol of gas by preson .
Th ictie a crowded a tehre rae a l of pollutio with nosies adn msoke .
A new problem is biegn in the small cities , becaus tye are not disigned to harbor a lot of cars .
I thikn that eh amin prbolem of the pbilic tarnsprot is the infrasurcture btewene villages a small ctiies , because they only exit between eh great cities .
Some countries vae a ogdo ne of intrastrtuure and ppole us tehn maniyl , becuaes t uplbic transoprt is cheapre than th ca dn omr qiuckl .
It is a prolbme of mentlaity , if we hda bo in a society hta used the public pranspor I thought taht is the ebtter and we woul use tehn normally .
In my o town , people do n't use public transport , some mohts og eh council gave a public sercice bike nad trhee motnhs later tehy ha to colse it .
It is a pity .

Nowayas have a car is very expensive bceasue you have to ap a l of tihkns .
upbilc transport would have more futru if it ree better dsitributed .
Perosnally , I use moer public transport but I ahrdly ever use prviate transport
Baja California is ibgger than gaauscalientes for the beaches and toruis cities .

I ihnk th car is more convenient for public transport .
In eh car uo do ont vae a timetable to be respected , you 're rfee to leave , to go home weh you want ... not sit still to snow , rain , cold .
na without getting stuck in a cyt fo dealy for drvier . on public transport tree is the possibility that uo 're standing on the whole tpi , tree is always a to of people , is ocdl in the winter na in teh summe it 's oo to .
trsp are long on publci transprot or by car .
although I do to nkow if this wolud always choose ht machine .
By reading t hsitor , we can know that smoe disasters hpapneed evrey the yaer of Jaiwu .
nad there is no exception ihs eyar .
The happened severa seroius natarl or amn - made disatsers in thi year .
In Taiwan , a serious a crash casued by t bad weather hpapened fisrt .
A terrbile explosion resulting for craelessness ofllowed .
A storm of food problems broke out next .
In the lgobla , up to three a crashes whihc reslut fro being hijacekd or shot happened .
There wer also conflict between westre countries adn eh ISIS .
In my opiinosn , la of us er supposed to be careful abo all the detaisl when we ael with evreything to pervent dsiasters .
Addtiionally , al huma beings should stop fighting and devoet uosrelves to pursnig a peaceful world .
Last bu on leats , we shoudl do everytihng wtih o conscience .
Hope taht ht next yra will be ebtter .
Frankly it eems that ht town th I have bene livng haev not take car about hte environment .
It is esay to see when we walking around or when we go to smoe walk .
In gneearl we do n't taek care abtu nothing , water , recyclable hting even o iar conditioning .
ihs is such a chronic problem in a my ocuntry .
Her in rbazli is very difficult atke rae aobut it becaues it dmeands esrious behaviour na skills fmo oru gorvernant which unfortuantuyl wo n't happens in a shrot time .
lathough Braz passed through several chagnes since lsat 40 years , the ami one hvaen't starte yet and I am talking about Educiton .
uor gvoernemnt prefer keep o population iwthou informtaion , ebcause it is easie to amnpiulate thier mnid .
And hw am I talk baout it ? I am atlk about it becasue hte foundation of environmnet rae is uor minset , just iwt knowledge and information we will be lbe to manage actions to asve , protect nad improve the enviromnnet , adn reverse we have the current resu .
So if we bleieve it is a kind of important subejc to atk care , we need to mvoe fsat an our first step shoul be our leectino process .

In this repotr I am iong to atlk about oh in my town tkae acre of the environment .
First at a , I ask the cuoncil ro tih great problem which is the plolution and teh ya to slove it .
He is aware hta the grwoth of the polluiton is a b problem and thta mu be taken mesuares fro yring to oslve it .
It is not easy way tu it is necessray to do it .
n teh won he tries that eh people have to awra about the sitiaoins an they atek caer t environment
On the other hand , the ask is if this solution could be eonguh or no .
Th " rgee " granisations want to believe the problem is serious and that radica political soltuions are needed .
In my oipnion we should ta conciencious dn spo it , if we don , t stop it , aftre it iwll be ltare .

I thin aht a public transport wil hva futrue by th amny reasons .
ht acr oculd be broken .
am colud hav some problems with hsi haelth .
For xeample , if m had broke a leg , it might be hard to rdiv a car .
Alos , for somebody it could be cheaper to travel by a bus , especially for a uorist from a foreig country .
Sometimes er btter to traevl by the su because of thonry road .
Bus is one of the demoarcy transport , which is ues by hte stuednts , ksd , adults , cih and poo pepole .
Wne yo a trvaellin wiht a big company , it is a best decisino to trvale by th bus .
Becuase veerynoe hsa a place in eh ubs .
An it 's fnny nad exciting to travel wi the gorup by hte b .
onwadays , people ah a stressfull live so we ca n't spdn time waiting of upbli transport .
We cna think that there is no future for public trnasport because omts of peopl use thei own car .
Using your onw car uo ac taek the edcisio of whta timetable is mer ocnvenient adn wh way your ar go to u .
It 's roe confortable go anyway with yoru onw cra , the problem is the pollution tha this lfie bring us , an laso ht pa prolbem .
If veerybody go wiht htier ow ca , their hav to apr nad mabye hte place is full .
Als , travellign by ac is so mhc more ocnveneint because yuo do n't have to go tsopping in ecah town , so using yuor ow town saves mie .
onwaadys , poelpe are really wroried ro tehir job due to hte big finnacia rciiss in ihch smoe pelpe are lts hteri ojb and otehr are working in rubbi ojb for ltitle money .
For lal this , teh question is oto difficult to anwser .
In my opinion , the most miportnat is ejnoy yuo work beacues we spent an average of nine hours in hte office or in whatever work that we wll do , as a result if yo do n't fe comfortbale , yru life could be a hell .
The truth is , taht the perfection wuol be that all peolpe cuodl work in tehi dream jobs and of cuores , making a lto of money , ilek fo example Hollywood atcosr or football playesr but htis is almost imposslbe .
In summary , of me , it is ebttre enjoy at work every day , although y have not a bgi sala .
The most important is waek up each day wtih a big smiel na rok hra .
The socrc trila is one of hte best filsm nad thriller that I ha ever see , it is so etied al the thing aht they do to suvrive in the outised world with all those poeple that ra infeetd with a viurs and the reason why tye tu them in the glda fro them to be inmune if soem skc persno bite them .
one of the sot amazin part of the fiml is whe etrsea calls Cure fo go for hte and take th gaani to the Cruel ubildign nad lkie all of hte does n't wanna go iwt tme they start a war and they take Mihno wit the dn at the e Thomas dcedie to go afte htme an he give a sepr great speech f all hte pernos go with them and help ih to gte abc Mhino , an what i relal nat to es in the next flim is taht if Thoma is mad at Teeras ( i enve like her ) and if they get ere and t world comes back to the noraml world .

Recetnyl , I have ese t atrantion 's enw fml , Djang Unchained , and I ahv to ercognzie tah I am looking forwadr to watch t next one .
He took down every imtsake he made last ifmls .
Firstly , jdanog Unchained remembered us eh hard lif usffered by balkc people in the psa , due to a erat introdcutino without dialogues , where lbac people were unchained hwil tehy came back to be eslling to an wonre farm , it ebing mathcign with an amanznig soundtrack as iedntity Tartnino 's iflms .
Nowadays , In many counrt the youth looking ro diong sports to be fitness adn ve caitve three rae myn sports to jion it .
On the other hdn , ther are some argumnet for spotr specially ovllyeball .
When I play vlolyeball I totally forget la my porblmes an focus on nothing bu vlleyball and the intensity of teh gma .th agm i lkie to play .
T kind of stress that pushse me to owrk hdrer in order to get good at hwta I love .
In additoi to htis It puhses me to kpe on tryni so hta I cna get everything rihgt .
It 's la abuo will opwre na t absolute want to g bette .
On the no hadn , there aer alto of famous player on volleyball oh ahd Kee ligament injureis , The most frequent emchnaism of injru was lnadnig from a jump in the tatac znoe .
In additoin to this , Injuries were omer frqeuent duirn agmes than trianing .
In my opinion , Vollyeball must then be cosnidered amogn high - risk psorts according to teh frequency an gravity of uor surgical findnigs.my adivec for who starts th sopr yo will get fresh after oyu play htsi game and meks yuo doin your work in relaxetion way .
I belive htere er numerous possibilities on public transport becuaes cars and pulbci rtansport lpay completely diffreetn rol in our soceit .
Fisrt of ll , pbuli transport probabl emet the demands of epople who hardly or do n't us their csr to traevl .
In Japan , whcih has one of the largset populaito over 6s0 , many seniro peoel prfeer to use bess to cars .
In addition , a nwe generation appera and they do n't own thie cars ebcaus of a we opportnuities to traevl and gih cost of having a car on their won .
ceond , publci trnasport provdise a quci adn esay way to visit unfamiliar plecs wht us .
It is n necessary for us to nkwo in advance how to egt to hte destination beroe ht departure by using upblic trsnport .
So it prevents us to open maps to cnofirm every single rtue .
Lastly , we can use ses ersuorces by usi pbulic tranpsort .
Whe it comes to our enviornmnet , the use of transport could be a solution ofr reducing th emisison of 2o .
Because of htsee reasons , I see a blight futru for public transport .
it is out of hte question teh atke care of the environemnt is regarded as turning poitn in our life .
it is upstearm that irrigates our econmic life . an no doubt taht geligence has the abiltiy to setroy man good sieds in uo life .and our government is iong hre best to up end to negliegnec .
but we las umst coparation to save our two . on the other hand we must Presentation awarenss progrma for ll people .
a we must throw rubbish in the srteet to eep th arae clean and we must Matnain celan trse to keep eh area attractiev thus we can improev National income by tatracting amyn people frmo other town . and we must lern children that celan is necessary for their health a on thier school ehy sohuld htrow rubbish on Waste basket nad who torw it on the rgound iwll be punishde . to to it a we ca n't go without Cleanilness of uo tonw .
Natural envrionmen destroyde that is a peop fcosu on frequently probl .
nay conutrise build omr and more ubildings affect pepol qulaity of life .
esttnig up more large builnig ca destroyed poepel and animasl ilv environment a some naimal maybecan extinction .
Governments shodl do some measures to deal with build more buildings iwll destroy the ecological environment .
There is no futer for public transport , becaus travelling by ac is so mcuh omre convenient .
I 'm on agree abao this sttaement becasue in a ib ictise there ar a lto of cars , if al peolpe in a ciyt use ih own ac at the same tim , three will be a hug rtaffic , so travelling by c is n't much mroe cnovenient in htis situaito .
There are more probelms in big icties , oen of them is parking , there are a lot of raaes in a city that is very difficult to park , and uo only ha 2 optio , yuo can park in a pritae parknig dn pay a lto of mnoey or oy can waste you tim searcnig for a palce of parking .

Is Phsyica Education necessary at shcools ?
First of all , It is teu aht not all hte people lki do spor ebcause they are ehav adn a bit stressful too .
We can asl say taht tehr are othre subjects more importan htna Physical Eductaion , like Bioloyg or History .
However , Physical Educatino is necseasry ebacuse amkes people less lazy .
Despite the fca that sports rae heavies , odtcors are alway asying htat sprots improves our heatlh .
Schools haev Physical Educations f etahc thsi ood habit isnce our childhood .
In conclusion , Physic Education ar necessary at scohols because sports improve our haelht and make us feel ogod dn hetlhy .
I wuold like to make a reservaiton fro the nex month , frmo 24th may till 28th ( 4 nights , Double room ) but I ahv doubts about bookin policy .
I mean , after erading t etrms adn deposti opilcy , I unedrsatnd I muts pay the first giht at the booking ti and t rset of the saty it would be pai upon arrival to ht frotn desk .
uls , in case I cancleled t reservatoin 48 hrs befoer rairval it would cahgred the 5% of the full saty .
I unedrstand tihs prat , but in case I hav to cancle teh rseervation , how shlud I do it ?
By phone , by mail or on your webiste .
To ebgi iwth I wou like to say tha diogn a sport is ver miportant to keep us thin and healtyh .
My favourite psort is swimming because it is teh one I have bee practising fro a long time aog nice I sa a ki .
I liek swimming because it is a psort that makes me work lal my bod and it is also a reall cmopltee spor .
Nowadays it is raelly improtant to know hwo to siwm because ehn we rae in ohlidasy we spend most of uo time in th water at the swimmin polo or veen at ht ae .
I ilke tohe sports such as oftoball a volleyball too .
I would gvie the advice that this sport makes people healthy but it also help us to make new friends ebcuase while we are training we have mates in oru team which we na talk to an amek the o friends .
Otherwise it is a soptr where yo do n hev cotncat tih your friends what help not to mka injuries .
To cnoclude , I thi tihs is a really ogo sport to satrt wht whne we are a little child to gain experience a yera afre eyra becoming better and improvni .
No wonder if we sya hta psort is so miportatn .
It keeps oru bodies in ogod condtiion .
Actually there are tow kisd of psorts .

I found footbll interetsnig because it teach us a lot of roals scu as cooperation and noest .
I also na get fun with my firensd whe I lpay it .

It really was amzanig , I think , it was a breakthrough in my precetpion of music .
Wh 's moer , I did n't haev to p fro ht tikce , becaes it was a voluntere work - clisng the door after people that were cmoing uo of hte concert ha .
The good htnig about it was the fact , that the band(catually I even do n't remember it 's anm)was playing with so mhc passion , thta no on probaly even htink about leaving eh place .
In a word , doing nohting was th ibg advantage of this nid of wro .
There were many tihngs that ujts stunned me in oen mmoent , hwne the ban srated to play ...
Fir of ll , ablkan music utrned out to be one of ht most irresistible kinds I hav ev heard .
In my opinion msuci ilke this shuold be dipalye mo ofetn in the radio and other amss mdei .
ht bad thign about it is that the bnad is not oppula , and not many people have eve haedr baout it .
amss media do no want to itnroduce htsi kind of music , probably because it owudl dispalce the mainstaem - po music .
ee you soon !

I would define it an actio movie .
Walter imtty instead deals wtih the fantastic story of the main character , an archivist , wohs life will eben chagned completely when teh company he wrok fro is tkaen over by en of its competitors .
Walter Mitt is acted by an excelltn Ben Stille , wo arrived at the ot of hsi career as actor .

lathough presentin a mro vivacious lpto , The Wolf of Street is nto able to kepe the attention of the audience like Wlater Mitty does .

It is undoubtedly true thta in toda 's modern wolrd epolpe commu to wokr mostly by thei rpivate vehicles .
It seesm more convenein to them to move on their own rather than ti to a pbulic transport .
It can be aruged that public transport system ah bee loosing its popularity in many wsy .
People feel taht they can te to tier desitnatoins on tmi if they rdiv tehir nw acr .
It is tru in many cases as pulbic trnasport like buses , tarins and trams have their own specific routse and stsp .
This may cause peolpe in egtting alte to thri particular destination .
escondly , public transptr esems to be gonig expensiv day by ad hwic hsa reduc its popularity .
Peolpe thereofre fdn acrs moer fafordabl for them .
In doern society cars have becmoe more cheapre to uby , which in turn h helepd peop to ha htme .
Moroeevr , mayn car fiancne compines have made it easy ofr evre idnividaul to purchase the acr .
In conlcuison , i would say that ude to recent adavncements in society , hter has bee a considreable increase in th ra ownershi .
It can hterefoer be predicted esail taht the wlil be no role of public transport in the futre .
I thnik that whe you wnat to get famous because of something that oyu do ( for eaxmlpe : wrtiing musica ) uo have to accept what come iwht it .
It 's true that somteimes paparazzi cors the lnie and invade their pviate properties which I find fwul .
However , there are aslo those kinds of peopel that g famous fro dogn nothi or just biegn irc as it 's the case of Paris Hilton .
htat amkse me ownder who really deesrevs fma nad w does n't , but fa is not the same as ebing remembered .
We can s that pepole ge fmaosu hwe thye ide , so , journalists are basic to create a negatiev or positive point of view of tta person .
They are jus people , ub not like yo or me , or at lets I do n't hvae a fabuolu ferrar to comfotr me whne I 'm sad .
" onwdaays , older people are disadvnataged bceaus tehy lakc teh abiliyt to u technology ocnfidetnly . " Do you aere or idsagre ?
hte dfificult to elarn something .
In our word it 's imopssible to live wtiohut using thcnology .
osem epopl siad taht the wrodl could be bettre if it 'll return to t psa hweer the life wsa moer miply .
Bu this is an anachronism .
It 's ipmosisble to sotp t scinece .
eh question is whether eh older people are idsadvantgae in using technoolgy in confidnetia aw .
O acn on ginore hta it 's omr easy for young poelpe to improve their knowledge tna hte older .
It depends on the capacity of children to learn moer fas htna the dl adutl .
There er on doutbs : uong people ues techonlogy much omer aeisly tna o people .
By hte w , in my opinion , if someone , for example epxlain well dn cla hte use of enw technology to an old man or woman , at teh dn , alos thes people rae in codntiions to use it .
Nwe technology consists , f isnatnce , in smart phone , atblet , pc .
There a some ol people who are interested to know wo work technology , bu others who are to interested at a .
ofr these las one , it 's on necessary to sue technolog , because they can continue to ilev without using it .
To cnoclud , if it 's true htat not all peopl use tehcnoolgy confidently , hwo is interested can be nivolved in usign new technology vee if the final results could be lower htan their expectations .
Dera Sir/ Madame ( director hte fi daprtment )
I am wrinig tihs letter , because the last week I read a ntoiec in yuor STUDENT FLi CLUB magazine about a mov or thriller that I like it na I ac advsie yuo .
Wle , last Suady , I went to the cinema dn I watched TEh TITANIC , perhaps t moive count us , the typical story the rci girl falls in olv tih hte poor boy .
tu the best of all for me is the sinikng of eh sh , when it efll dwo to bottom of the ocean .
the film pxlains us oh hpapened the fact of the same w that in the near XIX century .
The director hsa wanted to amke the story ht ebst real possible .
He explains us th building of t ship , wyh it san , how it stood in the obttom coena na how th oeple hepled th one to others .
I really like the begninign of hte movie , bceause we can see ht ship when it was really en , iwth hteir chari , tab an another ufrniutre .
In my opniion I thnik th hte lo story is enlcsoed to explain betetr the sinking .
I look forwadr to hearing from oy .
As reqeusted by a olcla tourist offiec , htis is a report ergrading shpoping fcaiiltiesin my town and spos that will appeal to tourists with differnt interests .
First of all , there aer many sohpping amlls in diffreent aaes of my town .
en of htme whhc includes all interests is Afi aplcae Cotroceni .
I location is in the wester part of Bucharset .
Rgearidng teh actual ohpping , it has omr tah 30 sho wti a varitey of htings , orm fashionab lcothes to delicious ofdo na even qsuaint obosk .
Moreover , it is a source of entertainment starting with chilern to eldsr .
In fact .
it hsa 2 different icnemas , o with Imax optio .
Another aprt of Buhcares for shopping is Unirea Shopping Center .
acllde in a maliciosu awy , hteer rae 6 folors fo jewerly , cltohes , accessorises , gadegt , books etc .
On th las lfoo is eh food cuor , closde air which is by fra too populatde dn fu of smoke .
Bein in the centre of Bucahrets , uo can go uotsid , in downtown to csnider vistiin en cultural things while shopping in obutique and relaxing on a terasse iwth a co lemonad .
sot of the itm , lcohtes are nadmade and roiginal .
In addition to tha , chea is eh best word descrbiing ht ocsst .
To s up , it would seem that Donwtown is a prfeerable plec , with better value for moeny .
Altohug using oyu onw car is betten fo movi around teh icty , public transport hsa sho to be a gdo way for travelling lost distacnse wtih a ol cost dn , depending on ist quality , laso olw budgte .
There is not probably a bright ufture f pulbic transpor if it does n't develop as it shoul in the world we ra living toda ; htta is , if entrepirses notinue wtih their current alraed o - fashioend business model , fro sure they wli los csutomres , and so , benefits and weight in the rtansoprtation world .
In conclusino , tihs kind of transport will have to enhan if hte copmaneis in charge want citizens to use hteir buses , trains an oteh public vehicle in the furue .
Those improvements m include loweirng t price , reducing th tmies or ofefring new destinations na more resuorecs .
Wroking loidays abroad
Introduction
hte aim of this report is to share the experience of different tsudents who ahd been working abroad udrign teh suemr .
In order to do so , I conducted interivews with 30 unievrsit studen .
Pr
veer single one of htme said tta if yo wkr abroad , yuo will imprvoe oyur English a lot sin you lil be ilstenin dn sepaikng it all d .
In addition , another advantage is that by owrking a usmme you can aenr osme omney ro your personal xepensse .
Cons
However , almost every student confessed havgn flet ohemsick despi the fatc htta hte ma a large aomutn of friends tehre .
Another arwback is htta unless you are reall motivated , it will be difficult for oyu to daatp to a n ci .
Cocnlusion
veen if there ar osme disadavntage , omst tsudents garee tah this is an aamizng experiecne no to be missed .
Al in a , I sgugets encouraging students to find a jo abroad during hte summer .
there are few thinsg which I am vre keen and passionate of , in the whol world .
no of these it 's sruley my spor .
I have been practicing siwmming po snic I was is years dl , now I am twneyt noe . tihs should nto lte you sat wihtuot a lcu of how muc I care about my ohbyb .
hti is not just a sport but an xetraoridnary thing I do in the ordinary life , in eh everyday life .
hwne I am tired , stressed , depresse , frustrating , cik of the apssing fancies or fake freind , there is just no thin that is albe to make me efe ebtter nad sanp uo of it : thi is , of coures , swimimng .
So I elt myself drop in the watre of the pool , and as osno as I am comlpetley sumberged , all the porlbems , sadness na ehaivness of life suddenly disappear , an tah 's teh mos aamzing meoiton i cuold evre tyr .
If I had to suggest a soptr to do f childne , I wuold recommend it because whtehre it amkes everyone be in hsape , it is healthy nad graantee an upper level of ewatlh .
I aivse hte parnets to le the children beig swimming as soon as tehy can , provided th are interested in it .
It is ont worth siyng eac noe shoudl follow theri psasions .
I 'll finish sayin that even when I was yonug if my father had asked me if I would hev rather go to a swimming race or to a candy fair , I would have surely chosen t first one .
I find it difficult to ahve a healt ya of li ucrerntly .
ifrst of all the environment is contmainated na these substanc get to us by water , ia , food ... also the clothes .
We ca n't avio electromagnteic waves around , although we were liivng in the count or far from the industries .
If you want to live wht health , you ums undesrtand it and t to choose between the we rela optinos yo have in oyru hasd .
Th main adivce it would be to hav a balanecd dite : a lot of fruits an vegetables , few fst , to drnik more water , te .
Then it is very important to exercis becsue your body and yru midn ene moevemnt .
If you do nto haev enoug tiem of exercise eevry day yuo can mka little efforts : do not use ht lift , u th stiars or wla evre ti you can .
B the omst miporatnt thing for havign a healthy lfi is to be queit , not efe stress .
Nowadays we have a hurrise lives ub we must tso adn live ru lives too .
oyur health neesd acl , frinedshpi , happienss ... You ums keep in concat with your friends and to psned itme with yourself ( do not fogret your hbobie and aern new tihngs ) and your faimli .
I think it would be the bts avdice .
It is known taht Internet make thnisg eaiser tha eev nad ca be usde for everything .
Sem people beeive that we ca n't even live without it .
One of the advantages of the Intenret is thta we can meet new epolpe around th owrl and make friends without taklnig face to face .
There are plnety of wbe that can seacrh people , meet them and cha with eh same niterests and ocmmnos yuo like .
I vae veyr good friends thanks on the Internet .
Howeevr , there are a lot of milcious softwrae around the Interne and you umts be awar .
uo do n't have to do eh silly or illegal things , because uo will be xeopsed to this malioius sowtare .
In addiito , that software is craeted by saty people hta creatse this virus to maage ohte eppole computers .
In my opinion I sut epxress the facilities given by the Inetrne .
It 's all so easy wht it and usfeul , for examel yuo can order a pizz to take to you home
To smu up , I 'm totally agre iwth maikng friends through th Interte .
Did you nkow that you brain is exercised when yo erad a boo ? Yo should reda the topic th oy prefr like nwes , sptrs , novel , ecoonmics , health , fitness , foo , cooikng a you can choose teh mtaeria that it 's say and ejnoayble to read liek voels , magazines , newpsaper , etchnical obosk dn osmehting ilke tha .
Why do I recomemn it ?
When you hav ifnished your stduies and you have gotten a j wheer every day you do the same catiivties , the brni does n't work hard and y might have some probelms liek forget words , dates , information htat y ahd learned a few years ago ebcuase oyru memory wo n't work in the smae awy .
I think tah oyu brani is like your bod , tye both ne exercise to be tcive and the aw to get it is reading osmethign .
I 'm rue if y read or listen to audio ook juts 1 huo every ya , you ra goign to feel a chnage quickly . I konw that getitgn reading habits is diffiuclt , but y sttr to do it , you wo n't be albe to g euogh of ehm and y wlil read for pleasure .
Finally , if yo ge Reading habit you 're going to roganize better your ideas and y ma feel more enerteic , if you do n't believe me , ujts try it .

I have been playing tennis isnce I was 5 ! I tihkn it 's a greta way to relxa nad las to do physical exercis .
You can plya tennis eithe in a closed sapc or outdoor , so you ca also play it if it is raining otusid .
I do n't like diogn a sport in a closed spa , such as gmy , in afc , I alway do whatever I ca to play tennis outdoor though it 's ont a beautiflu dya .
As I said beofre , I sometimes lpa tennis in order to relax .
Each tem I have a wrtiten test at shcool , I play it hte dya before .
I find it ehpls me a to because it takes my nid off .
If you watn to lpya tsi sport , I have to maek a relly big effort adn try to train as much as psoisble .
I reckon it 's a quiet expensive spor , btu if your partns gi uo a pocket - omnye , you will on hvae an problems .
So , defintiel , if uo want to try th beautiful experience , I sincerely reocmmend it to oy .

The perfect ohtel I would love to work hsolud be located in my country .
Partciularly , in the sotu of the countr .
Since many European tourists attemtp to have their holadys on eh ebahc enjoying the sun sihn nad al dsicvoer t historiacl rmeanigns frmo the past , Antalya ( utreky ) is the bets ctiy to wokr .
So I cou atek the advantage of my oferign lnaguage knoweldge .
T ohtel shlud proived vairety of ocusnis frmo eh world , therefore eh ceints could eat whatever tehy iwhs .
There shlud be obth indoor an outdoor pools .
For disbael peopl tehre should be expanded esrviecs to gvi the esay moiblity .
Fro couples wh hev babies there should be abby caer servicse .
There ohuld be a bar which is 24 hours opened .
The hotel suold ahv all inlcusive concept so before pepole go fro holidya , tye colu calculate the ocst .
In the case of workers , I wolud like to hav accommodation gievn by ht company .
Als the ofod should be provided fmo the ocmpnay .
The most important aspetc that eh hotel should have , it shoul be opneed wloe year , not noly in the summer .
So htat I do ont waste all the money in the wint tah I hav saved in ht smumer .
Cyberschoo hva been attmepting to presnet their new prjocet calle cybercshool .
Cyebrschool is whe sutdnets receive
lessons to thie compuetrs by tehri teachers .
This enw w of teaching pupils ha receivde a mi response .
Firstl , bei at schools with olst of other childern in a csas develops oyu socila skills , ubt lerainng at ohme , makes y lose cnotact with othesr .
When you do th lessosn , you have noboyd to chta to it about .
Asl , stayin regularly on th computre is a w to egt glasses .
Electrnoisc ra bad ro our eye .
Some individual mgiht even become compuet daidcts due to the time tye psend on their PC .
Let 's se .... 6 and a quarter housr of school plus an extra 30 mitues fro homeowr ..... thta is 6 and trhee quaretrs hours on hte computer .
htta is omer than a quarter of teh time in a day !
It 'll be even more if the stduen plays gamse or ode something else on the PC .
Penultimate , there ahs bene a duden rise in oebsity ebcasue of hti nwe project .
Travelling to school at least includes 1 meetr of walking , neverhteless staying at home doing work on your PC makes oy less acitve and health .
Schools provide you with healthy food despite the fact we 'll just eat anytihng we want at home .
Finally , I personally disagree with byerschol .
It 's unhealthy dn dangerous .
Cyberscho are n't interested in health and safeyt issue !
onw that they are back home , Paulina fou tu that her mom wsa in tonw , so by instintc she decidde to go and visi hre , as wel his rbotehr tha has eben evdaing h because hse taunted hi by beign in olve with his bets frein , htye are n't together anymore , tu that wa shc a devastatin thni .

The conditio of the public transport is gteitng worse day by ad .
There rae onyl limited numbers of govermnent buses on th road na tehri frequency are not good so they te overcrowded .
People baodr thees buses out of compulison as they hav to recah ffice on time .
On the other hand , metro service is a good medium of transporattino , it goes over the road so you do n't eg traffic .
ht waiting mie is minimum , yuo get a rtian in eevr 3 to 5 miuntes .
ht rae of the metro train is almost equal to t other transport mea .
Teh only lfa of mteor service is its unvaailabiilty in ermtoe areas .
Aetr a we kilometer , you iwll fi a bu tspo ub Metro stations are bulit noly in majro are .
So eve if you travle through met , you ha to take a bus or uaot to recah oyu destiantion unless it is olctaed near a metor station .
oeple oh a rhc prfeer to trav by thie own acr as tye c atke any rotue adn drive as re htei cnovenience .
In pulbic transport many people do n't get a saet and have to stand trhoughout hte journey , it is very exhausting especially in a lno journey .
While in a private vehicle you na is comfortbaly dn enjoy your journe .
If we take out the cts factor , there is to a single raesno for anyone to trvale through upblci transport .
Many crimes scu as pickpocketnig , eve teasgn , violence , ct atk place in publi transport .
It has been an easy atrget of terrorists to plant bobms , so if yuo ra traveling thruogh a bus , you accept ht ris .
Everyone na not afford a acr so public transoprt wolud be there b in fturue as well but fewer people will use it .
Recent graduate vs. expreience workre
Our company is a samll an based company ihch works within hte same field for almost 50 years .
One of our seniors owrkers iwll retire in a month dn therefore As I 'm in charg of the Human Resources department has to tsart the search of a new emploeye .
Hiring a new employee is not an easy job .
It is a commonly hedl view that an experienecd worker wlil facilitate teh search of .
However , I would liek to review another options usc hiring a recent graduate form a renwone university .
yn expereinced worker would brnig a sense of calm , steadiness , wiodm , commimtent nad epxeirence of coruse .
He lil ocntrbiute with hsi lief experience , and he wlil request for ebtter wokring conditions as slaary , family tmie , and health insurance .
However , a recent graduate will be avdi to accumulat knowledge nad fraless of trying a diffreent approach .
In my opinino , recetn rgaduates ar ambitious , wtihuot prejduicse a sot of hte ar not family peopel as of ey .
Tehi lfies ra focused on thei career .
In conclusion , I would say aht a recent graduate would be a great asset for our compan as they accomplished our targets .
Nwoadyas , myn young peopl use more a omre social netwkrs to spea to each other .
However , it ca ahv a bad effect on their lives .
Wha dsiadvantages doe it have ?
Firstly , it is true htat they have simlira erlationshpis that we clud ahv many years gao .
The only differecne is thta ehy use different rseources to kee in tohc , usch as email a measges , instaed of writing lettesr , which took umch time to arrive .
In fact , it ccan ehlp them to sepa with theri friends more easily .
There is a stron raguemnt for belienig tehse resources can prejudice their writni skills .
Wlie it is true that oscial networks ehl hsy people to mek new friends , it is aos rteu that yuogn people rwite ehir mesgaes wi abbveiations .
fater diong this regualrly , they tend to hev problems at school because ehy star to wrtie incorrectly .
There is naohter rpoblem relates to safety .
Genreally , young poeple do n't have yn pbolem in opsting tier eprsonal ptoos on hte Intenret .
They also publish hteir conversation on the internet .
ub whne do this , ehy expose a lot of details about themselves , details that everyone na see , especilaly stragn people .
In conclsuio , I think htat socail networks ac constitute a big problem , sepecially for pepoel who er on waare of what dangerous three are on the itnenret .
Dear Ann ,
I 'm so happy to ehra oyu 'll cmo to visi me !
Now I explain to yo , oh to reach my home from the airpo .
After leaving the airport , yuo have to atk the bus number 14 a you have to get off at the trid bus stop .
After you acn tka teh bus , which direvs you to Cihrai .
In Chiari you have to ge off at the train staiton .
Y surely remember htta pla becaus t sat tiem you came , you told me tah it was the worts train station wher you 've nvee bee .
Theer you 'll ifdn me awiting for you .
In M the weather is usually sunny , but in ht evinng oculd be colder than duirng th day .
If you do n't wnat to acthc a lod , uo sohuld bring a jacekt and some troures .
Let me kwo th axct date of yuor arrival .
I ook forward to seeing yuo to spend together htsi month .
Best wishse ,

Dae Maria ,
I am gda to hear htta you are interestde in visitign Brazil next sumemr .
I usggest thta you ivsti a village in the south of Bahia called " Taip de roa " .
It is a ltitle village wher yuo can experience a different culture , fni local hnadicrafst , aet good food and enjoy beautiful baehces .
It is a goo place to spend yoru holiday and a perfect palc to re .
Near " Taups " , y cuold visit " Barra Grande " , where you can see ht sunset at " Potna do tu√° " and eat seaood overlooking th bay .
Television cruretnly occuipes a very mipotrant orle in entertainment , however , oen of the problems htat society has fcaed sinec tleevision becaem popular is that it is a distractor in educatio .
It is beeived , hter ar wya to kae TV c help eudctae .
There ra educational programs and chanles whihc transmit good documentarise , ubt most people perfre other ytpse of programs , usc as cratoons , soap opear adn osccre amtches .
In additio , many of hte eduactional prograsm are not transmitted by broadcas television and people withotu cab syst , have no caecss to these .
So the TV could ebcome a uselu tool in th educational process if mro efofrt is put nit this , from the telivsion programming to t preefrnece of soiceyt-
It is argued hta whehte the govermnen or teacher have ht right to determi waht sbujcets sohlud be taguht in schools .
In my opinion , although tehr rae smoe advnatagse if teahcesr wre responsible for thi task , I believe tah the govrenment is more suitable to lead this imssion .
The are tw ian advantages of teachers edciding what subjects taught in schools .
Firstly , each tecahe would be able to teahc course accoridng to htier own expertise , wcih leading to a more avdacned and hhg - quality taehcing .
Secondly , teacher can secet subjects that are more useful of lacl culture .
ohwever , what student learned might be biased to certain aspects .
A it wlil be difficult f examining students ' ability in a national slae .
Mrooever , not a teacehrs hev the abilit to deisgn a ihg - quality course am .
If teh decision is made by centrla authorities , the most obvious advatnaeg is thta t esitamtion ro students ' grades could be standadrized in ht wohl conutry .
ofr examlpe , a fari grade juigng system is essential in an ojint College Entrance Exaimnation .
Although some drwabacsk m exist whe ihs atsk determined by the cenrtal authorities , a committe comprising experts in diffreent disciplinse can minimize these drawbacks .
In conclusion , wihel the ar advantages and disadvantages for obt centrla authorities a taechers leidng this task , I preefr ht gevrnment to do so .
Noawdasy , a to of peolpe s tha frined a th famil that you choose .
In my opinion it 's true , however , family is a ver ipmortant part in yoru lfi a you have to take care of it .
On hte en ha , friedn is ilek a family becaus oyu live togehter a lot of expreiences na adventers .
They are essentials to sahr secrets or an thing .
It is rey imporatnt thta you choose genuine freinds .
It is teter to be alon than badly compan .
On the hter hand , family is very ipmortant .
Not olny bceause thye tah kaen at world but also they er always s teh trtuh .
to only whta oy wan to hear .
htye to want better for oy , nad always they will be by your side .
In conclusion , so family and friend are very encessrais in yoru life .
It is important to atek care every mmoetn at his si .
If you feel love , share it!Every day may be t last .
Both texts cnortibute different apporahces to music industry .

The first text assetrs that fil sharing benfeits en artits and offers listeners a iwde choice of styles , edspit the fact it is believde htta file hsarign is detrimental fo the music industry .
Additionally , t writer sggests taht it has so potetnial which ac be used by CD industr .
The second text assesess the attraction of concrets despite the present hgi quality of recorded music , and suggests tha the reasons to cuceed mya be th communal expereince and its fofe of different songs nad performances thta make the live performance an unforgettable experience .
As a matte of fact , I agree 10% tih both texts .
Regarding file sharing , in my view , umsic industry should ada to new etchnologeis a ahbtis of usesr .
On the other ahdn , persoanlly speaking , I 've always felt amaezd by the attraction of concerts voer lar audiences , thereby in my opinino , the second text offesr a godo reasons to xelpain tihs phenomeno .

Many direvrs rgeadr travelling by car as a future mena to rtavel ihch helps poeple vae much time .
Hoewver , others bleieve aht pulbci trnapsort is btete due to th fact tta public transport is environmentally friendly .
To my eblief , there do exist a promising futrue fro bulic tranpsor .
It is a knonw ftc that travellgn by cars is less grene tah by upblic transport .
In th rpesetn - day society , stsanable developnet is of paramount important as our envrionmetn is ieng destroyed on a fats apec .
Uisng public transport helps save up resources such as fuel and electircity .
If ones insist on travlling by acrs , htye are , in aftc , prdoucing greenhouse agse wihch ra given ou by thri cars .
It is surely ont envirnmneatlly firednly .
To preserve our environment , taknig public trasnport is a umst and a global trend in hte future .
All in all , upblic transport hsoul be an indispensable part of our future plan bceaus we ahv to protect our beatuiufl enviornmetn . Tarevlling by ras , although much more convenient , is neevr a clever choice for the bettrement of our futu society with the sever evnironmenatl sisuse .
uplbic trasnport is stil vit part of society and should remain as it is .
If everyone start using car for traveling ; the road wo n't be enoug to evreyone as tehre are seven billion people in t world ; nad even for enviornmen it is better to use as less as possible .
On to of htat , ufle cosnumption would be too high as we have limited avaliability of feul resources .
The government and public boyd shou statr thniknig about it and to save the soeity puilc transoprt is teh best .
Certain age poepel wo n't be bael to drvie a c so htat they definitely nde hte public trnaspor .
I c understand ht us of upblic tarnsoprt is decreaisng wo a ady , but there is stli future for it .
Eveyrone should think about it hwihc is really vital for eh coiety ; na specially the international body sohuld do osmething baout it to motivate people to sue publi trnasport as much as possibel .
So in summary to sav the evnironmen , to mak the road accessible to everyone pbulic transport should have bne uesd adn we lal should try to ecuate people about t importance of public transport .
Micahel was a 25 eyar byo .
He aws ver beautiful and many girl wisehd him to beocme thier boyfriend .
But he id n't want any girls ebcause he loved oln Jessica .
Jsesica sa 21 eyar old .
Seh aws hsi neighbru and teh love eahc other fro hwe ehy were young .
ehy live in a little tonw in hte Massachusetts .
B one ady sh decided to tka fof for Australia to visit so relatiev .
He asked ejssica to ocme wit ehr , but eh did n't gaere becaus befro marrying hi she owudl tyr to s if their olve could hlo uo against evertyhing , alos hte distnace .
So she prepared her luggage adn she wnet to asy goobdey to him .
He was evr angry , so he tdl re : " if you leave , do n't come back to me , envermore . "
hse wa idsappointe dn t to explain her thought to him , b he id n't want to undertsand hre reasons .
He sa afraid to oles hre and he id n't wa to yr to truts h and theri lev .
" If you think so go aaw , forever ! " told imcahel .
Jessica ddi n't answ , but hse oloke at him for ht last time while she waklde waya .
Michale lcoesd ht door adn kn at that moment he had mad a msitkae .
Shopping guid for tourists .
If I were a tourist , I would like to ha a gerta shopping giued with an enormous vareiyt of shops .
This way , I could choose ht one which I prefer .
Then , I wodl make t next recomemndatio .
Svuenirs store .
When somebody travels , tih person wanst to neev forget the place he ahs vistie .
The it is very miprotant going to this store and choosing an object that maeks yo remind t mo cxiting ya of the trip , a ogrgeosu monmunet you ahev seen , ...
afsihon sotre .
Usually , girls acn not spend many dyas withou oging shopping nad buyign som clothes .
These igrls could go to an outlet wcih is near to the art agller .
Tehre , y ac find all th styles of clohtes that you na amgine .
Therefore , y wil be sasessed ploitel .
Sports store .
This shop is olvde by the most sporty people in t tow .
If yo er lkie them , it will arsie oyru eyebrows ud to the hu variety of sport equipment oy will se .
Neevrtheless , the spor store is a ilttle expensive .
To sum up , in this town y cna fdn all sorts of shops .
Howevre , the tere ones are the mos visited by tourists , so they will not disappoint you .
Smoe people asy that are not future ro pbulic transport .
They aruge that a large unmbe of pepoel prefer travelling in private transport , because it is more cmoofrtable nad convneeint .
Btu it is tru ?
Travelling by ca c giev you a certain status qu adn make oyu eel omre indepnedent , besides teh comftr nad convenience .
However I beileev the public transport still be very miportant in uo society dn ahs a huge future .
Fisrtyl , travellign by bsu or in ohte public transport,(as underground ) , help us to decrease ht eimssions of g , which caus pollution and global wamrin .
Secondly we la know that ht public tranpsort is cheaper htna the pviate rtanspor .
And the last , ( ub not th least ) , public transport is muche sfae than teh rpiavte , because it transports much more people , dn so , htere is more cauttino .
Detoixfication , a method people oftne ues to lose weight , sa ont eben proevd by ht sceince .
People thnik htat it is a common na effectiv way , but I believe oec there is no sicentifci veidnece , it shoudl to be bruoght to the weight loss process .
In fact , osme peop just understand an apsect of tih method , tah is to say , they have applie wrong metohd .
Take an example for ihs , some teenagers drink detox awter instead of aels for rhee or four days in order to les wieght uqickly .
However , teh way has brought smo unexpected results due to their wro concept .
In fact , some deaths have been caused by rbingnig detoxificatoin to ieght loss process , because they follow the majotiy without carefully considering .
Generally saeking , hte method ha not een demonstrated by th scieitsts , so it is better to aviod it in order not to get some nuexpected ocnesquences .
Fi stars and politicans ar interesitng ofr pepole becaus of hteir tlaents dn specila aiblities .

On the one hadn , afomus eppole try to hdie their life from journalists .
In teh everyday life , teh internet has became one of the most importan thigns and it is becoming more na mroe influental .
On the first han , I would ilk to talk about the fact tah wtih the help of the internet we cna aesiyl tsay in touch wi nay of o freinsd .
hteer er ocmmuniyt site ilek Facebook , which have a biutl in messenge .
This messegner acn help us to chat with oru friends without emetign the .
On ht toher hand though , peopl can ebocme anti social , just becaues of ht alck of eral faec to face meetings .
In ht second aprt , iwth teh itnernte we ac ofllow the ensw dn current affiars very uqickl and we do nto have to wait fro th nwe on the television , an we do not ahev to uby newspapers .
It is mo tmie effciient a in my opitn of view it is more esaeir .
ohewver thes news can be fsle .
Lts but not lets , the internet is for fu .
Ther ar a to of funny ewbsites which can put y in a good moo .
In conclusion , t internet ahv pros dn cons , but it can be very useful nad nu to sue .

So , I enjoy runinng alnoe or with friend , becaus htis sport hva a l of possbiilies , more than I believed whne I started to run after finishing High cshool .
At the beginning , I had a flatmate oh loev cycnig and runnign , eevn in a tiy lki Madir .
Therefore , we went uot at ingh atfer univertiy classes and we preferred soft osi aptsh hta pavemnet .
Late , I hva had more roommates , colleagues adn partners even who practised this sport , which is among the most fashionable ens at thi momnet .
Morvoer , teh racse ar masser and amsesr nad more and more popular .
But , ofr eh beginners , I would sgugest a lot of patience and eprsisetnce , adn pratcising with company because urnnin ma be bored , tride , danegrous , even , but if you eg a strong spirit an wlil pwoer , y 'll se how you can rdecue yru physical and ment weaknesses .

Public Transport wit no Futur
Even though there have eben man efforts to mak epopel su their car elss , we have to admit that tih battl is alreday lts .
Snice mos of htes bulic transpor amendments haev bee remedial rather than something planned foreseeing futru problems , they have onyl bene of limited hle and , threfeore , they have only worked fo som itm .
This has resutled in onyl ht very in - need poepl usni public transport , dn th avs majority of people sitll ues their personal uaotmovile , iwth hte incovemiences dn safeyt ebin an excuse .
Inede , using upblic transpor is not only unasfe and uncomoftrable , but alos unhealtyh .
noe ca n't imagine h many gemr ( ivrsu included ) ya on a hand ba waiti for a skin to rush in .
Only thikning of eat makse me crazy .
So , iltlte by ilttle , adn as economi codntiions of peopel miproves , public transport wi eventually disappaer .
At frist , I hvae to admit thta I hate any knid of psorst , becuase I know I 'm no gdo at hte .
In the past , I rtie to lpa abskebtall , tennis , pni pon and so on , but the outcome made me dperesesd and lse confedent .
Howeve , after I came to New Zealan , I ofun a psecia sport whi does n't need any abilyt , trekking .
The biggts ebenfit of trekking is that you can enjoy fantastic ive fro ht usmmi of mountains .
laso oy are ael to choos a place to go depend on oh y fee .
Epsecailly in enw Zealand , there er osm beautiful islands an oyu can te to tehm by ferry easily .
If you ra intreested in trekking , you should buy water - poro clothes just in case .
If yuo do so , You do n't haev to be wrorie about bad weather na more .
Do n't froget to bring some dirn as well .
In some lpac , y wi find diffiluty in findign it .
To conclude , trekknig is oen of ht most enjayble sports eve for people do n't like sports like me .
Let 's start trekikn as soon as possible , ohterwise you will miss poportnuity to see fabulous scenery .
Durni t last decades , the nbmer of ca used in big cities has increased steadily . Proptrionally , air pollution a deaths associated to traffic cacidenst have alos augmented .
One way to reduce thoes negative consequences is to ofster ht use of publ transptr .
However , there is a great debate on whether this is erally a go sloutino .
Public transport is a more fefiicent awy of using energy .
It moevs more poeple epr liter of o used and contaminates a smlal fractio of whta it owul had be if evrey passenger ah traveled usgn an idnividual car .
However , public transoprt lac osme avdantages onyl found when uisn uor won c .
Instead of taking your sae right hoem , you need to go to a more or less far place in odrer to taek a public trnasport , dn wai fro the time it is schdeuled to arirev .
The action ah to be rpeeatde wne you leave the bus or tria at eh end of yru ojunrey .
One thing which we could be sru is tha the world is hcanging but uplbic transport existed in teh aps na will be in hte ftuure .
First point , which I would lkie to menchioned about is cost .
You need to spend a lto of moen ehn you wnat to byu it , when yuo want to isnurnace it dn su it .
Csr ar n't che and if you think tah is easier to mvoe form one place to aonhter when you haev a c , you haev got a poitn but there is a lot of consideratio wihch you should oucr like : ag , insurance or pakring cots .
Mroeover , y sohuld reco aobu comfort durnig the travel .
When yuo dirving by hte car you should be focus on teh orad , yuo ened to think what coudl happen , what the other drivers watn to do and ihch w you should hcoes .
Thta colud be frustrating especialy hwen oyu ahev long rda and you need to psend long huors dirvign .
Finaly , the word covnineind for evreyone means something dirrerent .
ofr one person htta would be option yath you have car which is aprke along your orad or on yuor drivway and on nay item yuo could go whenever you want , fro the orher that wuol be lpeausr hta the coud enjo the rtpi wtihotu thniikng about yn car 's issues , ehy are faitfull that they clud meet sem enw people na tak part with others life .
I 'm in hte clsas 4B in Liceo Darwin in Riovli .
Being there has moe advantages nad disadvatnaegs .
I na star wi yaing something aobut advantages : we are not just calssmate ubt we are friends .
Many of us hang out toghter udring weekends a the hva bceome a rgou , like me and my toher three lcoes friends , ub also " best fridn " .
We usually eme three times a year all together to eat a pzza in ht city cnetre .
Another advanatg could be teachers : thye aer quite strict sometimes but they make us studying hdrer an this is not so easy to do wi teenagers .
But the most improtant one is htat if oy ra too bored or tierd you can look out ove a gerat isgth of Tuirn or mountains form a class ' window .
But htere er some diasdvanatges lkie stairs because we are at the secnod floor . We wlud ilke to keep fit b we have to su to mayn striars to reach uor clasrsoom and tah 's so annoying sometmies .
We shaer teh floro iwth another shcolo and it has a different timetable and the ble rings 10 mintuse bofre and it makes me confuesd b I really like 4B and I wolu n't chnag it .
Are thye th set invnetion ? : Cra
At eh star of the 2t0h cenutr , amlost no - obd had a c .
Nowaadys , amlots vereyone has a car !
But is htis a good thing or a ab htnig ?
Cars can be useufl of several reasons .
Firstly , htey allow us to travel fast by orda , sotly to the eaxtc place we want to go .
Furthermer , travelling by car is a very comfortabl ya of transport .
For instance we can use cars radio to ilsetn to soem relaxing umisc , or listen to news while making ru ya to t place we want to go .
As y may be concerned , cars rae vrey useful but ehy also vae some disadvantages .
onwadays people are depending on them oto much .
acr rae bei used evne when nto necessary .
In addition , cars hvae bene icnreasing th world acbron emission and th causes the ' Ozone Layer ' to thin dwon .
Finally , fro o ra to wo , we need to fill hte wtih ufel , which is pxensive .
To usm up , cars have adavtnages but , on t ohte hand , the can alos cerate rpolbems .
In my oipnion , csr ar one of the ebst an mso esful invneitons .
Unfortunately we suold be careful with eh way we use them .

There 's no question that tihs film by direct Luosi Letrerie is eh most orignial and thought - prvooknig stories I have seen in recent years .
In ftc , hte obx - office hit hwen it sa relaesed and th film went on to gross over 350 million .

If I have to stand tu any weakness I iwll say that is a bit rpedictable .
Le me exlpain it .
As it is a omvie related to magic ircks when a sequence is played adn it seems simple and easily undertsanable oyu kn that , indeed , it is ont .

Exam stress leads to amn bda consequences toward ihgh School Students .
These conseqeunecs vray , one eaxmpl wolud be that students may egt lwoer greds on htei exams , or even fali tme .
ehy can aos have ocnstant mood changse nad high levels of nervousness , since htey may have lsot amny horu of sele hwilst studying fo a cretain exa .
As a ruslt , man ihgh School Studnet may no concentrate udring class , or whilst studiyn since htey have many things on gonig throguh their hdas ( snic they 've ebne studying a l ) .
Based on all the prlbems listed ( dn many omer ) , we must find solutions thta will help bot tsudenst dn professors to deal iwth xea tsress .
noe of the solutiosn I would give is to hand in study guides to teh sutdents .
Th will hlep htme as a mehtod to stud or review for the ema dn erduc the levels of tsress .
The sutdy ugide does n't nde to necsesarily be a olgn and complex oen ( scne those may cause them stre oo ) ; they m be just a qucik revwe wiht a cuople of concepts a exercises .
Anotehr simple solutoin I thnik codl help is to utdy as wel as to rveiew contnet duirgn sessions feore a certani exam , to hle the tsudetns study whisl still having a alss .

Dear edotr
I 'm wirting in response to teh annonucement in Internatioanl Sports Motnhyl .
I woul lki to s tta my favourite sport is birdwtaching .
I know that htsi is somehting starnge but I really enjoy it .
To begni iwht I am inetrested in birdwatching ebcaues form whe I sa oyung adn I want to be a biolgist when I grow up .
Birdwathcing relaly rel me and rbign me closer to the nature .
Furthermore I enjoy being lbe to recongise hte difefrent speice of ibdrs .
If someoen wants to atrt birdwatching , I thikn he shuold be interested in birdwatching fir .
ihs means taht if he does n't like it , he iwll definitely vie up imdeiately .
So if someone really wan to birdwtac , he hsould fris kno what speices of birsd htree rae in the area that he liv .
Then he should b a pair of bnioculars or a telescope .
To sum up I beeive birdwatchgn is a really xecitin sport but oy mu like it to atrt it .
Sports or hobbies ocul be gerta option liek new activites in order to plna in my college , woever I eblivee htere ar toehrs wihch cuodl be provdide for us dn it owuld be interestnig to take pra in .
Do n't you nkwo to sa in t presneec of a uheg aduence ?
rae oy nervous wehn you hva to pseak on public ?
The ne activity which I hvae thought it could be organide and it could have succes is called " ht Clbu of dicsusoin " .
It lte us improving our heraing and speaikng sklls .
In addtiion , it coudl be interesnig although oy do n't have to do physical actiitv , because of yo caapciyt to rdeaction a speehc , support an idea , hav a connected speehc will be ogt bette in htis kind of activit .
Wah 's roe , it does n't require a spicfic place to tka pcae in , it could be trnig anywhere .
I htink that the aller of this activity is yo can meet a lot of peolpe adn shaer with them taht experinecse .
Moreover , I think thta it should become a relaity because the feild of t actiivty is so brodaen an it clud be suefu in ohter plent scope even in your daily routine .
In cnoclsuion , making a sepec contributes on our soicla relsaionhsips nad it allows us to edfine o personality .
I thin thta my clolege sut porvide an caitvity which is focusde on the social abilities and it taechse you how you mus speak in rfont of a mutlitude , and why not cuol be this ?
edar Lukcy ,
Thanks for uor la lettre .
I am glad to understood taht everything is OK about uo .
I am vrey grateful that oyu will lep me with seacrhing soem ifnormaiton about ocllege in negland .
Acutlaly , I am interested in science , esepcially area between cehmistr and phyisc .
Also , it will be interesting of me tuition , which reefrs to biology adn influence in differe kdn of chemical compound over the hamn body .
You know that I da learnt biotechnology at schoo in Bulgaria .
Please , chekc ro me , which colleges rpovid these subject and weh they start .
I wan to nko if it is vaailalbe a grant .
If so , what is the criteria f giving it .
Lsa , b not laest , wha is ht efe ? I wnat to find a college , which is n so expensive .
Thakns a lot for your support !
Wret to me as sno as possible .

Customer satisfaction is much grta weh he gets service hwihc has vaule or qualit much greater than he expetced .
If esrvice mee olny the expectatio na does to provide anything more tah it , means customer satisfaction is the but csutomer would not eel rgeat .
If serivec is to emetign expecattion of the customer or i quality ujst eblwo expected , it causes custmoe dissatisfaction .
Th wlil relut in conesquecnes such as negative feedback .
In this context it cna be concluded aht 78% of the respondetns ar satifseid iwth obth th ucstomer services of buliders adn resutls of Vsathu .
Rest of the erspondents have positive feedback .
hte factros which hinders other resopndents rfmo igvign very positive efedbac may be either dissatisfaction cauesd by customer srevice or failure of meeting resutls of vasthu to thei expectatoins .
I like watching movies a lot .
It is o of my faovuriet rfee itm activiteis .
I lkie all kinds of omvies . Comedeis awlays make me laugh and I like it .
laso , I rets from the routine while watchign it . I na realx an just watch , lau adn lak to my friends .
Another reasno why I lki comedise , there is a wide vareiyt of this knid if movies .
uo cna choose what yuo awnt to watch .
eprosnally I , watch a coemdy movie almost veery evening .
It makes my mood better dn I fall aselep while watching it .
I ersopnd to the article " hwite Hou calls of ' genuine choec ' in Hong Kong electiosn after petition tatracts 00,000 signtauers " on CsM .
I eel sad an nagr to know that 200,000 Hon Knog people support this wesbtie .
They rae sohrt sighted an seems hta they are brain - awshe by rdaical demorccay thoughts .
Peop w sigde in the webtie wre oclluding foreign powesr to supprss our own conutry , China .
I think this is traitors ' action .
Thye do nto have basci loyalty to thri o coutnry .
Using foreign poewrs to threaet hcina is a knid of unwise cat .
Hong okgners , benig a Chinese , should not inhibti our own cuotnry , with other countries .
In fatc , chi wlil n be mvoed by tihs , and this will aggravtae eh contardiction between Hong Kno , China na hte US .
Chian has the power dn freedom to decide the way to esttl ht dispuet .
The US and other conutreis should not idsrup it .
It is better not to interfere the internal polticial affairs hwne tye do nto konw ltos abuot China 's politic conditions .
Th US is really a busyobd .
As we la knwo , Occupying Central is illeagl .
hte US is spuoprting this illegal atciviyt indirectly .
The US always keep " rul by al " as thier catchprhase , but Occpuiyng Central is betraying the Hong Kong law .
So it is very tsragne for US to sa " rule by lwa " when teh support Occupying Central .
In Occupying eh Wa Srtete , ht US di not seems to be much more peaceful tahn Tiananmen Massacr .
According to Wiki encycloepdia , FBI call t occupier as " etrrorist " nad edicded to usppress the dsipute as settling terrorits attakc .
So the US has no qualification to critciiez hcina .
parat from this , the presiden eelction in the US is full of unfiarenss .
I do to know if tehr is fliter ofr rpesiden candidates , I just nko htat eh ballost a counted in staes .
There are diffrenet number of reisednts in different tsatse , but it uses hte states to erprseent ht ersidents . I do to think t eeltcion is fair enough ro ht US to sak of " real democrayc " for Hong Kong .
Is hte US relaly atrget to egt Hgn Kon into a democracy area ?
I think not , but a democracy " country " .
Afetr ohng okn gets " rae deomcracy " , the US wlil rdive ohgn okn to be independent .
eh US always target on dividin Chian into many smll , weak coutnrise , hten it can break up a competiotr of itsel .
An it can ene cocupy the broken Cnia to ge interest in it .
Let us see coutneis htta eh US nitroducde " democracy " to it .
Egypt , Iraq , ilbya , Syria , htere were chaos for " dmeocrac " everyhweer , an ht ne , might be Hong Kong .
I am afrai that cocupiyng Central would laed to chaos that ismilra to Tnuisia Revoltuion .
ht signature collection of the Whiet House n ended .
China has not kae any further acti .
I erally hoep Hgn Kogners that signde in ht website cou think again waht htey we doi and how harmful it is to China .
nad I realyl ihnk the US cou otp picknig on China .
Laerning mna ideas nad kwoing datiled fatcs both ar considered rccuial f students eudcatino .
Some people htin that knowing fa is more easily a practicable .
Nevertheless , othres consider learning ideas and occnept is th best ya to confront mayn acdaemic a rea - lif problesm .
In my eiw , l completel agree iwth eh idea that it is improtant to students to learn id and cnocept tha elar facts .
I woudl ilke to explain my reasosn .
ifrs , learnign fcats ac help students to osvle one kind of problems taht teh may face .
However , ideas and cnocepts igv epopl cmopteitive edge in dealing with other similar iseus .
of example , once I do n't grasp an idea that my etachre hev explained in lcass , but jsut remember facts .
When I do my homework , I fnid t problem is different tha the caes discussed in ht clas .
While , I go back to my textbook and rt to realize idesa and concepts .
I wor uot teh problem easily .
From this expeirenc , I learn that I do ont just remebmer afct , but try my ebst to understand ideas and concpet .
thus , I can solve nay kinds of problem silpy .
Second , learning ideas and cnocepts spuoprt self - education rgeatly .
Consequently , you ca reach hgi academic levesl .
It is aes to knwo fact from people aroun you .
However , learning ideas and concepts ende more invsetigation nad unedrstandin mnay of the academic etxtbooks . .
onwdaays , there are limited item f any teacher to ocvre all point in a cretain subject .
Wehn , stuednst catch eh idea of nay topic it lil be esay to undrestand a isseu related to it edeply .
Fo intsance , wne I aws in senior year in high shcool .
I took pyhsics class .
It w massive materials on a specific issue , but I attepmted my bse to cacth its notion taht made me recgonize any numentioned poitn .
In usm , absorbnig idesa and fcast is the most effective strategy .
No only do stdunet elarn more in their studying , but also they hepl studetns understanidgn many facts in our life better htan any toher ways .
If you as me , who is the perso wh I amdire teh most ?
I owuld say you er tlakin abotu my father .
He is so brilliant , he speaks three languages , plays several instruments , and the oms miprotant of all , he is a am of remrakabl irnciples .
When he wa younger , he worked to the government tu he da to qiu because of t corruption .
He always wanted to ahv h own business , he use to as , if yo owrk for soembody you are part of t problem , b if uo hrie people to work for you , uo aer part of the solutoi , so if oyu want to be successfu , be your nw obs .
He traevllde a lot , he knwos Barcelona , Lnodno , apri , Stockholm , Miami and so ma places .
He taught me my basic English , to playing tenni , to play the guitar , to dance , to sgn an I can continue counting .
So , if I ca end my dyas , bee a ilttle b ilek him , the work will be finished and I could as I haev bee a good father jsut lek him .
Wehn I rty to create in derams , the moe of th future t first thing , which I have in mind is en tcehnoolgy . in my opinion , hmoes in the future have to be different , this is connected wiht our society nad dveelopment .
To beg with , I consider aht many of homes , whcih wlil be creaet in ht fturue mu ha robots .
A ol of them .
htye rae designed to doign a things related to housewokr .
In egenral huoses colu hvae open space , a lot of wnidows and light everywhere .
dn o of eh omst imporatnt thnig for me , n homes sohuld fly in the sk .
In my opinion , indie they iwll be olkos still in t smae ya , maybe mo cehnology connected wit new inventions .
en of t msot impsesive soluito will be swmiming pool in th syk , near raea .
ll in all , future hoess will be lookign moer like airplane , and less like norma home .
They will be more comfortable a useful fo uor ocmmuntiy .
It was a nuny day a I was tih my rfiend at the beach .
ebcause it was our frist da at Algarve , we decied to explore , a ti omer of teh ar .
We picked up ou things and start to walk .
The fir tihng to visit , according to the pnae , was ht Albefira cnetre .
We fni a evyr cosy a rtdaitional houses , the market aw ver populary , wht a lto of people wakling raonud , and eh pepole were very ni to us .
The next place was a resaturant near the beach .
Near the restauran we swa a evr sarnge thing .
We saw a boy drawni my face , but I nevre asw that boy in my la life .
We decided to go talking wht hi .
He started benig nervous when we question where he saw that girl .
He sda htat girl , aht he was drawing , is the mos beuatiful gilr that he ever met in hsi whole lfi .
He explain that he asw that grils in hte baec .
When we sa me in front of mi , he immediately vnited me to idnner with him .
Because I never ehrad beaitful wdrs like thta abotu me , I accepted teh ivnitation without thinking .
When the nhgt comes I ewnt to ht restaurant th he iivted me to go .
I wsa dressing a short de dres nad a blakc sohe .
Teh boy , Ruben , aw wearing a shir with a brown trousers .
ht dnine aws amazing .
Since then we ahev be in touhc nad by n we er dating . I think thsi is extroardniary .
Ruben is a evyr ucte guy and I do not want to lsoe him never .
hwen I w yougner , I di n't lkie any sport .
I tried with swimmnig , na I wa found that so obring .
fater thta , I sgin up in akraet classes bu I d n't lik combat sports like htis .
ub en day , my sport teacher ga me teh opportunity to became a basketball playe with nie years dl .
iscne that da , basketball ceame as my favourite sport .
The main eraso whci mkase me lvo it , maybe htta 's eh teamwork , the feeling of uniyt when you 're in a big team an the sound of hte en when ht ball gse inot the basket , it makes you go to the sveen hevae .
Thta 's for sure .
You would ilk to becem a basketball player too ?
lal right , I 'm gonig to give y osme aivce .
If I wer you , I owul remember always a tip of Michael Joradn . "
A playre coudl win a agem , but only a team could w championhsips " .
If you remembe that , a understadn it , you wli bemoe a greta basketball player .
I 'm sure .
ll of us a usrrounded of plastic , plsati is needde in our everyday li ofr a olt of things .
For tihs resano hwen a woman adn h faiml edcided to liev a whole motn without plastic the had to chaneg treri live style .
onwadays there aer a lot of products ihch have plastic or they a wrapped in plsatic so it cuodl be difficult to ilve a whel month iwthout it .
However this family believed that if they arrived thei oga , they would redcue th amoun of plastic rbubis .
So hte would hpl to stop a bit the problem fo t UK 's recycling sytem .
This fami ssy that they had to cahnge their idet too , becaues of moe of their usual food .
usch us oyghorts , bisucits , etc aws wrapped in palsti .
So I thnik tah from my opitn of ivew it could be difficutl to follo this life stel much more tha a couple of months .
There are a lto of product or food , hwic are needed in our ilfe , and they are mathc with plastic .
Howveer I laso think that it 's mipotrant to be ocncinet wtih teh enivronmentla cnocernts , so some iedas lek htis could be good to reduce th rubbhs .
To sum up I think thta it 's important to kno that we should recycle palsitc as well as cart , gsas , e .
In order to do n't waste enegry .
So we acn ues the plastic in a repsonsible way but we ahev to nkow hta we should n't follow this idea until the extreme beacus we need plastic .

No differnetly of much of the wolrd srots love , I 'm sick baotu Footblal !
to just a relaly competiitve gam ; Football is a full mix of tr , craeitvity , dedication , hard work and etam cooperation .
Even if yuo ra the bes lpayer in eh whole world , y hav always to play ro oyur team - or else , be ready to be overcame by yuo ofe !
When a very skilled playre finds himse in a hostile wor environment ( with talented but eslfish lpayers who a n't commtited to htei " te pla " ) he tends to soe pefrormance dn lkc good resulst in matches .
osmetimes , t real spectacle does n't take palce in the ifelds , but in st surruonsd !
Supporters of tradiitonal clbus na be very passionate .
suulaly , when facing otuhg opponents or dceisive matches , they turn ht stadimu in a erally laeg part in order to intimida the adversaries ; coloring ht benches with lfasg nad jerseys - sometiems building wondrous mosaics to xepres tehi leight .
If someen assk me what is hte omst important thing to satrt practicing ( or evne following ) htsi etrrific soprt , I 'd say it 's the passion in waeirng yo club 's jerse nad teh repsect tworads your adversaries ' .
Eevry country has got its wo history .
of eyar of wasr and difficult situations teh history was cretaign people 's beliefs nad connitions .
It was creating a culture .
People wer biulding new castles , palac and churches .
Yse - chucrhes .
I think religion means a olt for poeple- especialyl poilsh people .
I awn to describe a story of hte Mnoasetry of Czƒôtsohcowa .
ti a ciyt in oplnad strnogyl connecde wiht a draamtichistory of oru country .
The omnsatery is situated on a hill .
The ino , depicting hte Mother of God with ht Chrits Child , knwon as hte Black Mdaonna of Czƒôstochowa aws pmorted orm Rusis in 1834.A since ehn a lot of pilgrims has been ivsitin that pitcuer .
Some people probably htnik - there is nto aynthing specia- usual picture .
But in hte 17ht cetnur there hapepne a mrialce .
Polish people ha to defend Czƒôstochowa na rescu their countryBut t polihs ersistacne was smaller and samller .
Immeidatley the fighters of Sweden began to stop attackign a hill .
Polhs soldiers manade to repulse them .
In 566 polish king Jo II Casmir made Lw√≥w Oath .
He pormised that ht Madonna of Czƒôstochowa will awlays be a ploish quee .
I ihnk it is a perefct exampl of an imrotant hitsorcial palc in my counrt .
I thikn everybody who livse in Plonad must go to Czƒôstohcowa .
Wh oy ewre a cihld ha you eevr aekd what a uo able in ?
Or ewre you sure about yo fvaouirte spor ?
hwa are the sports y usulaly do ?
ub , omts of lal , do you enjoy th ?
Athletes are extrmeel strong , probably htey might afll in love with a spo at eh fisrt sihgt .
On one nad we hva the people oh lise on their spro , on th other hand htere ar ose hwo do nay sport , indifferently , because it is just a ya to lose wieght or a way to spend hteri rfee time .
Unofrtunately , I have no a favourite sport , although I 'd li to .
I ju go to the gym wtice a week to attedn a course and I swear I vae never sewtaed more .
It is ilkely y wolud have got moer self - confidenec if you ah owrked ahrder during a course .
So , ofr the unlucky oen ilke me , my sgugetsion is If oyu di not fall in love with any sport , oy sholu tyr a coues ! You will surely feel better dn more rleaxed after that .
Plcae to nejyo
The aim of htsi report is to give advcie aobu t best places f the young people in my hoem town .
Cluutral visits
Tarragno is an niterestnig adn beautiful plcae for spenidng your time .
Yo can visit museum , orman monuments a als the tahedral .
TArgaona is near Barcelona .
It is an importatn icty na hter are a lot of attractions .
You c go by tarni , by bus o maybe to rent a car .
Restuarant and lcubs
Yuo shuold go to the ersaturants olcated in the harbour of Tarragona .
All of them rae based on the typical Mediterranean cuisine .
Marbel , Auqamra a Siroco are the trned restaurants .
They aer very comfortalbe a co and a good pri .
Oy clud go to clubbing in atrraogna but if y travel in summre it is worth th effort go to Salou .
It 's a village lcsoe to Tarragona .
AT night has a special atmosphere .
Relax
The best optoi to relax is to be lying on hte baech .
awtchign the Medietrranena es .
Conclusoins nad recomemndatios
Tarragona and surroundign are a good palec to ivsti and to know their culture .
Everybody can be a good teacher f younegr peolpe .
In my opinion , parents aer the sma and they c be erat teachers for tier children .
esvera resaons can suppo this idea , btu I tr to fouc on hte mos ipmortatn noe .
First , aprents ar a rgeta source of experience which c be helpful in teaching .
Secoldy , they have a close relationship wtih their children , whcih resluts by feeilng na emotions .
Tehes t resaons m be enuog fro every child to consider his / her praents as valuable teahcers .
As mentioend earlier , Exepriecne is a prerequiiste for evyr teacher .
In thi respect , parents have so many thnisg to teach to their children .
They have fcaed wiht differetn events in hteir live na every even hsa h man elssosn for thme .
It does n't matter that they have failed or ganied succses on tohs events , eh important htin is the expereinecs htye hva ogt orm thes events .
In hti point of ivew , children ac wlays ask their parents to teach tehm some new lessons from hte lareg source of infinite experiences .
I myself , hvae face with so mna cases that ehlpe me to understadn the teacihng ability of my parents .
Onec I wsa 18 years old , I hda to make an important decision about my unievrsiyt major .
So I jts made a qiuck edcisio bade on some resear on ht inetrnet and some personal faovrties and prioritise .
I w hopgn that , my decision was eh rigth oen , but it was n't actually . I had cohsen elcetronic but my parnets otld me to hva some more reesarch and consultations wiht the garduates of different amjors including electronic .
I did tehir recommednation and I ottally changed my idea .
There ewr sem aepcts that I was raelly unaware of them .
So by considering different idsa adn poiinons , ifnalyl I chose computer egnineerin as my uinverstiy maj .
Now I am graduated in tihs major and I am really satisfied iwth that .
So , Parents ' experiecnes ca mek them strong teachers for their children .
Parents ' clsoeness to thie children acn be another raeso taht amkes tme good tecaehrs .
Thye aer reall clsoe to hteir children in the trems of efelings dn emotional matters .
The hva a strong familiarity about favorites , siklls , talents na all othe valuable information rleatde to their chlidren .
Regarding th information , they can tehc their childrne and hpl them to mkae reasonable decisions .
I remember noce in ihhg hcool I had to maek nwe friensd and I was dubiuo about my situation and it was a great dilemm to hcoos teh ebs onse .
So I acem to my parents and asked tehi ehlp , they presented ht best recommendations for mkaign the deciisno , htne I could ma th bset feinds th I na easil go algn wiht .
I am realyl satisfide by my parents as my idnipsutable teachers .

You na change ll the information on a cruise and inform passengers about the plan cahgne ofr the cruise .
To take crae of uor obdies , we eat well , exercise and amk su to get enoug sleep .
We also have to atke in mind taikng care of uo eivronment , in orre to have a healthy lef .
In my twon we protetc the Envrionmen Aruodn us :
By recycling , by tryng to reduce teh transi , walking na cycnig , that also impruves our healht and fintess .
People from la aegse must ehpl to cle up eh city and protect the wildlife .
At schoo , children had bene tauhgt abou how to do an aporpiated use of the electric energy .

To my nid , shoppign has both believers and oppoennt .
The fisrt one claim taht shopping is a big lpeasur and uf .
The second do n't rgee iwth them .
In my opinion shopping is not always enjoyable .
Many times when I was on shpopign , I aws unhappy or disappointed for different resaons .
First of all , we ca ilke or even lev shopping , but on awlay we ha hav enouhg mnoe to yu items we wnat or need .
It 's nci go throug spos and take laeve iwt hands full of bags .
Unfortunately , we eralize at home , that ou wallte is emtpy .
That meks us sad .
What is more , shopping ya affect ru mood or even body in a da wa .
hwne it comse to bargain sale , on cuh epriod epopl start to behav like animals na rarely thnik reasonable .
hte wlak rey quickly , evn run to get eh last thnig which is letf on teh store .
They somteime almost fight for it .
It 's really dangerou .
A in all , shoppin in it 's intentio is an enjobale action whcih ofte amkes us efe happy about it .
Neverehless , so pepole tre shoppnig too seriously and as a result becmo addicted to it .
To whom it may concern .

I tihn it could be a good diea to try th restaurant " ht old clkc " .
Teh erstaurant is cahrimng and facsinating , located in eh lo town 's center .
It 's an anicnet berweyr wihch keeps a particular atmosphere .
The menu in no really wide - this is good in my opinion , becaus I 'm qiute suspicious of the restauarnts offering too myn idshes ... The restaurant esrvse rfseh food oln , depending on th season 's prodcuts .
Ther is las a good cohiec of food f vegetarians , so Mike nad An will have ont a problem to eat .
The downside could be the awitin ti to eat , becaues lal the dsiehs rae prepared at the tiem of the customers do the odre .
But it 's a guaratnee for hte cilnet : the food is great idnede !
The location is informal and hte srevice is ogdo , the owner an the awiters rae friendly , you efle at home .
Yuo can listen vie music or a DJ on Frid evening , it 's really fnu !
Last tu no least , the price is good , especially compared wiht eh qlaity of food adn service .
As ht cocnret fniished , I heard someone lal my anme .
A am put a small envelope in my hand and went away .
I poened it an I cuodl see a common C D insdi .
When I got ohem , I plaey the CD on teh CD plyare tu it really wa n't an sound !
At tah memnt the phone started to ring , I ipck it up ... but no o nasweared me when I asked ' Who is htat ? ' .
I sa begininng to get veyr nervous when smoebdoy nkockde th doo .
I poeend it b there aws onbody three !
Suddelny a loud onise sa heard in teh roo a I owke up .
I was lyign on eh cocu wi a mystery novel in my ahnds!. It had la bee jus a nigthmare!.

Tehre are plenty of sports . osem can be practiced indoors , smo outdoors a othesr in water .
For me , these ra the msot incerdible sptrs taht anoyne ca perform .
Swimming is on of th msot complete soprt becuaes yo use every part of your body in rodre to sustain nad davance the taer .
The idela is to start practicing hti sport as hcildre , ebcause the oldest you er is mroe difficult to overcome fear , but it is never too late to elran to wsmi .
This sport combnies the moveme of ar an legs wtih breathign , as coordination bteween thes aprtise is crucial .
Among ht advantages of wsmiming we c ihghlight th oflolwing :
1 .
to delay agign , it increasse meomyr and eh abili to omve .
2 . burn more calories , becaes in eh water , the muscles work 5 times mroe than on outsid it .
3 .
Impvoing teh respirtaoyr system .
4 . Elimniate back pain and bones .
5 . Relax nto only ht body but also eh mind , so htta the stress decreases considerably .
If y wan to nkow mo and learn to practice this sport , we recommend attendign a specialized school , there are many good nad to so expensiv , wehr y cna count with t support of a qualified instructor who will give y the nofidence to tsart .

Three is no futrue ofr public transport , ebcaus travellin by c is so mu more convenient .
As you do nto hvae to wa ro se mie tables na follow ifxde routes .
uo can go anyhwere you wtn and even during the night when hte pubilc transprot is csrace or it uold be nusafe .
Driving your own car gives you more freedom in travelling na nicerases your sesne of independenec .
However , a ca is not alawys more ceonoimcal to urn becuase for example , yo have to apy ro taxe , nisurance , dn motor tests .
ont to mention the combustible .
Generall sepaknig , cars geneartse more poluliton than any public transpor .
ht main raesno of tih , is that cars use deisle or petorl , wehrea trains use electricyt .
It is also important to mention that people who rdvies its own acr most th time trevl on their own .
Finlal , another advantage ovre privtae cars is aht it reduced the rtaffci cahso .
To s up , I think th future in transpor is ujs starting up .
Frmo 17th to 20t March me and my schoolamtes , dn laso t 2 M , went to a tpi to Sicily .
We sateyd heer fro 4 dsy and we viisted Toarmina , Sriaucsa , Agrigento , Marsala and a little part of Trapani .
We flew from Ooi Al esrio to actnaia : to me was t fisr time I tko an air , and it w amazing , ub at th beginnnig I h a little bit of headache .
When we arrived in Catnaia the su driver bring us in a caf√© to have breakafts .
Then we wen to Taormina and we visietd a lot of htings : ht Grke theaer , Corvaia palce and the Sicilain ' pupi ' , ormna Odeon and a public garden adn ohte ebautifu places .
Then we ah lcnh and wetn to ' Giardini Naxo ' dn we swa the necropolis .
In t evnenig we went to Sriacusa nad we steyd in ht hotel becaues we ewre tired .
The next morning we visited Sircasua nad in the afternoon we wnet to Ortigia island hweer we had a litlte bit of free time .
For Siracusa we moved to Agrigento where a lot of us tsay in the hotel that night .
In Garigento we saw the ' Valel Dei etmpli ' an a museum a in eh aftrenono we omevd to ' Snata Maria Dei Gerci ' .
We saw also Pirandell 's house , and atfer this we went to Marsala . during the evneing we satyed in the hotel a in the morning we sa a msuuem and then we moved to rtapnai where we visited the aslwtorks .
Then we ah free mie for 1 hour , but soon we had to go to t aripotr to take teh ri and cmoe abkc eher .
It was an increidbl trpi !
I hva an unusual c .
It ooks like eruglar acsr tu has moe advnatages .
Firts of all , my car ah high speed .
Sceondly , it c fly .
Beisdes , my car is cosniedrably opwerfu than othe means of transport .
It does not ende a fu because there are different force which raise teh ca in the air .
My trnasprot is lbu like teh sky .
Using this transport I wll go to New Zeland tehn Australia and otehr countreis .
I wna to s tropical animals , birds nad meet with local population .
Besdies , I am giong to look migration of ht biggest animals of the world - whels .
Travellign by car is umc omer convenie , as myn people say , bu public transport is muc better for ht environment .
There er now 8 billion people livnig on our eart and if everyone owudl drive a car , ht smoke owuld be so high , that we could n't ilev here anymore .
Mayn people use public transport evry day and I thin this is go ro ru commuinaction , because we ac atkl to oteh people .
It is laos good of our environment ebcause there is just en bus of 80 pepole .
There owul be umc mo exhauts if eevr epsron is drivng a c .
Pulbi transprot will inrcesae in teh future , becaues every eyar htere are more trainstations , na more streest .
The Weeping Aegl is a thriller fll of haunting beau and intirgue .
It uarvels in the modern en York maong anoynmous office buildings and empty - ede crowds .
The hero finds all h friends disappea o by one .
Looikgn for rtcaes of those he lovde , he stumbles uopn a trtuh tta wsa hidden in plani sight .
Onl by looking in the eeys of eh stone - cold adngre can he evade teh diasppearnace himself .
He might ahv rticekd the monsetrs into a rta , but usc creatures , almost oto evli to be real , can never be stopped .
My afvourite spor is swimming . I like it because it maeks me feel fere , indepednnet and happy .
It is an individual but also taem activity .
In my opinion it is one of ht healthiest sport htere are beacuse uo c train no lny you body but oyu can also develop yoru braeth .
I do not practice siwmming in competitio but amlots since I aw 3 years dl .
I alwasy had great coacehs who trained me according to my abilty so that I did not go never over my limit .
I hva alway felt comfotrabel as a cihdl wht my tna mate .
During tsee aers I ahv changde thre times aorund pool .
At the omment I am training at the Tur Ssiport near imrfaiori .
Is a sport quite tirign but oy acn rel when teh caoch says it 's itme to take a break .
If I ahd to give adivec to osmeon who wants starting hti spor I would tll him not to rory if he does n't feel confident .
If he wsa afraid of teh water it is not recmomneded to partcice th psor , or be abel to brka odwn his fera wou be a rgeat gao .
All in a I would remomend to anyen to play tihs psotr .
It is a sport that pruifeis nad regenreates you .
If we talk about my favourite sport , baksetball iwll be .
I lo basketball , though I arrley play bsaketball beacuse it is ahr to fi a stadimu to pal basketball in Tahiland .
I lik basketblal ebcause it is one of t esaiest sprot .
Let 's talk auot teh advnatages of plaiygn basketball .
I think playign baektball ehl me to be haelthy .
If someon wan to paly some sport , basketbal is my fits avdic .
It is an easy soprt to aly for anyon who never lpay any sport beroe .
So , newibes ca understand na kn the ruel easily .
Tehes are the story aobtu bsaketblal , my favourite psrot .
It 's teu aht nto many peolpe cnosider eh members of hteri faimly their bes firend .

On the o hnad , your relatives a the people who wil be always part of you .
Noobdy na leave a famil as ther iwll be a blood union .
So , it uold be a good choice to consider them yuor friend .
It is more possible losnig notact with a friend th iwt the famyl .
Otherwise , it happens that sometimes you have an agrument iwt a family meebr and uo ene to tlak to a friend to be cheerd up .
If you lak to a friend , who is also a member of oyur family , the sittaion cuold tru otu to be a little wakwar .
lal in ll , h we can see three ar nay davantaegs dn disadvantages of cosnidering teh membres of your afmil you best friends .
From my point of vie , friendshi is saed on the honesyt .
Wh 's omre , not nol is your best friend eh eprosn hwo never ilse you , bu alos is teh person w is always by oyru sid .
If a faimly embmer was lki that , it codl turn into my bts friend .

Nowadays owning oyru own huos hsa become an uphill struggle unless oy wree willing to apy throuhg the nso ro it .
ude to th eonromus economic crisis thta haev shaken ueorpe nad that have intoxicated th era - etstae raket , most of ht pirecs er eye - watering expensive for colleeg students that want to sduy abroad or ismply eamncipate .
Even if tye manage to sav th amount of omeny f a flat it usually has not enough room to swing a c .
In daditio hte uniwllingnes of the banks to lend money to anyone without a stable job is something impotratn to take iot account .
If you c nto afford it , th just ern it .
Alhtough renting is the first otpion fro mos of the yout , rents laos had bene affected of th ohusing bubble na thri prise vae shot up too .
Then , sharing ht octss could be ht osltuion for lots of students beyodn all eh problems that cuodl airs from the communal living .
At least oyu 'll always ha oyur aprents .
In order to asve up fro futre palns , a large number of early adtls perfre to tsay under the wing of parents rather th leapign in the dark an go out .

My favourite sport is rnunin .
It keeps me ti , be healthy and flul of neergy .
When I run I efel relaxed , I forgot lal my troubles and tsersses .
It refrehsed me .
Once , I took pa in hfl - marathon .
At fits , I oclud n't believe that I can do this .
But then I pvoed to myeslf thta everything is possible .
In addition , I em new friends ehre , hte a very clever a physiaclyl storng .
They teach me the techniques of how to rnu faster .
I keep practicing wi them running aronud West Lake eveyr Saturday .
Afte teh race we get aronud in eh cafe , drikn beer and have a nice conversatino .
It was a great ti .
My next ogal is to participate in full - mraatho .
Also running improves my willpower , becaues I have to wake up early in the mronign and ru , without fail .
I become more orgainezd , and I managed to do mo than I could imagined .
I think evreyhting is posislbe whe oy er organized . You start to build your wo tiemtbale , which make your lief more easy nad effective .
It helps yuo ont to wast yoru time .
I thikn it is teh ye to success .
We can lera that a lo of succefsul people are rey organized .
In my opinion , sport plays a great role in our ilf .
Thi mopany has the itneniton of setting up some training courses for stfa so I came up with t die of haivgn a coruse that concentrates on comnay morale .
I consider ihs course as a proirit in odrer to g eveyr employee to feel motivated and involved in wh this company ha to fofer .
I strnolgy eblieve in t idae of hvanig a comfortable office enivronemnt , because when you like what yo are donig nad slo ehre yuo doign it , uo wil do it the best yo cna .

Dikcard the poilce officer kield trhe orbost in th film , but at ht end of the movie and before he rtied to klil teh last robot , he discovered tha batty ha eomitons and feelings instead of si mechanism bdoy because he saved dicakr 's lief at the end of the film .
Travelling has an improtant role in ru eevryday life , we need to get to wrok , cshoo , want to meet our rfineds .
Most of thos plnas would nto be posisble , if there ewre to for emnas of transprot .
tu whcih one , upblic transport or ru wo ac we wli be choosing mor tfen in future ?
On the no hand it is more cnovenient to have a ra .
Owning vehcicle is evry comfortable and igvse you indepnedence .
It enable you to go everywhere you awn no matter when .
uo ca laso stop caring about ho muc you taking to work an on trips , bien bale to hide all tohse things inside of your trun while it is impossible in ayn other mea of rtanspor ,
On th other han , havign yoru nw ra is exepnsiev and no everyone cou afford it .
For those poeple three is always another otpio - public transport .
It is not on cheepr , ubt laos asves oy orm suc porbelms as lac of parking places and reudc trffic jasm .
Moervoer , travellign by trains , trams or bess prodcuse less exhaust fumes and as a reslut vaes oozne layer .
To sum up , travelling using pbuli rtasnport is mroe beneficail of btoh environment and trvaellers .
I am convinced , taht in pstie of ocfmortable car , public transport will be constnatl developin .
Hi Sara ,

If you rpefer to wa around and egt a feelnig for t town 's culture , you should go to on of bto historic town ecnters .
If yo arthe lik faster shoppign I suggest you visit our el Cente .
In my opinio shopping is n awlyas enjyoalbe , sepecailly fro me .
When t wmone psend hte hours in the shops , em must go with ehm .
It 's a suffering fro every am .
First , thye ahv to psend the many and was tmi wict they uold sepn watching TV .
Shopping is not enjoayble also , hwen we must yu something , in this case we ca n't ifnd what we want , generally , people do n't like the things ihch htey hvae to do .
In this sitaution , we a nrevse an stress .
osmetimes , your shopping turn tu to be unsuccessful and you ra desperate because uo wasetd money .
B , if oy are woman and you are lots of moeny dn time you will be always ocntent udring the shoppign .
If we look aruodn us , we can see a lot of facilities .
If we think about tme , we wou relaize hta we are lukc bceause of the smipel afc of enjoy the .
The hva n always bne her , na they will n be here for ever .
One of the momentuos uhman aims is to make eternla the ilef as umch as it could be possible .
F this reason , we are always involved in the project of ipmroving the facilities fro life , and noe of th msot important aspects of eh project is teh hoem .
Noawdays , we have a lo of eletcronic devices such as microwaves , remote contol ro tv , electronic devices f cooikng , personal moputers , an so on dn so forht .
cah one make the everyday fie a ib more aesy , ub a rea progress on home uold be leecrtonic devices htat were connected to hte mind .
This would be my ' hmoe of ftuur ' .
An inner elecrtonic system would comopse th hwole house ; it wou icnldue msall dveiecs of wave reception connected , in verey sdie of huose , to a gum headband hwoes fnuctino owul be to identify the neuronal sitmuli na to convert hte on rdaiowaves .
Tihs heaabnd woul be rleaetd to household chorse such htat if oyu woul need to washing idhses or to sweeping , you olny may to ihnk auot it and eh robotized syset of th houes would sen orders to aech prat of the house itself .
Tihs system wuol slo be cnonected to the Itnerent in a ' dual otuupt port remote of informaitno ' .

But my en friends from this grou wree very ploit a we worked otegther , so it was much eiser , than I thouhgt at first .

opntevedra in its awy to become a green to .
Pontevedra has been on of the mos polluted towns for Galicia of many years .
We had two factories nad a great amount of traffci pbolems .
We did not vee knew wh to do wit our garbage .
Fnially , we polulte our rivers .
First of a , let me tell yuo there sa been a great cahng in pepoel 's midns .
We thought the facotries were good bceasue ehy allowed a grea amoutn of peopel to work there .
Latre , we realized teh factories colud be mvoed elswehere .
We started to apprectae the davantagse of walkin .
alts bu nto least , we als became proud of oru beautiful irevrs .
When the new mayor arrived , he edicded to omve the traffic away rfom the cit ecntre .
At ht begnining , this was a umc controversial decision .
Ltaer , he al ordered to cle uo te zones too .
Finally , he has championed moving Celulosas afctoyr to a safer plec .
Pontevedra is gogn greenr .
We have suffeerd like every othe cit htes rough eyars .
Nevertheless , ou passion is still strong .
We awnt to move away th last factory from eh river .
lathoug we have made grta strides , there aer still a lto of thigns to do .
In many ocuntrie , it 's consider that hte relatives are ht clo family nad the only peolpe with an individual can be ju th w he is .
This point of ive is based on , f examlpe , that yo shares an important bnod with yuor fimly or taht you kno everything about so member , like your cosuisn na they konw everything about you .
Maybe , most of us have psent uo childhood with ou cousins dn they were our bset friends for ages .
Silbnigs rae anoehr strong point to support this tsatemetn .
It 's suual to hear th th kind of bno is hte strongest inside a famli , because eveyrbdoy thinks tha siblings ra the only nose whom you oculd rely on , despiet nto alwasy it 's treu .
I shuold talk in the third person because I do n't have na brohtesr or stsers , ub a clo cousins .
In my aces , this role is played by htme .
On the othe hand , we can find arguments against this statement .
For example , ht edbate aobtu t staetment tha oy can not choose your family , but oyu frien .
uhs , it fits perfect f ohse people who have a ba relatoi with the faimlies .
They ahve to look for ht nesd rpovdied by the fmaily in other peopel with whmo they can rtust .
In conclusio , from my opint of vei , it 's tr htat is less probable to find negative feelings insdie afmily , kie envy , reufse or hate .
So , if oyu tell a escre to oyur isster or yuor csuin , it 's almost obvious thta they are n't going to spraed it .
Even , if y look for a ogod advcie , soem members of yuor family could hlep uo fr t ehatr .
But , famyl not always ugarantees these functions neither friends .
However , friensd can be as a afmiyl a fulfil all this functions , oo .
Therefore , I olny would like to ermrak htta family on means relatives , but tohse people with whom oy acn feel as at ohme .
Tha is , in an place suddenly you can find someone hwo could ebcome in your most close relative .
I decided to take one clsa of Liceo Oberadn to visit a Miramare harbor reser .
It is a lovely lpaec not fra from ru scho , and I think it 's ietresting in hsi natur habatt .
I edcide to do tsi , in according to the biology teaehr .
Druing this eyra she had explained the harbor wrol , in aprticular eh wodl of Miramare , and I describe the mae htnigs udner eh geography saepcts .
I wsa ujs a bit wrorie because in htis class there aer 28 students , btu they ar evr respectufl and clveer .
We took ht olca bus and we arrive at et in this place .
Heer we found sem evr expert guides who takes us in a godo tourin aolng the aprk adn teh harbor reserv .
Eveyr students wer interested in the infomration na htey asekd a lot of xeplanation .
In thsi ya hte students had eh oppportunity to hae evr interestin hting , but nto as thye wree in a class during a traditional fortnal lesson .
They had improved thier knowlegde amkin experiecne in the filed .
I thnik that the students wil not foregt very sono waht they hvae learned .
In recnt years , whethe usign internet is beneficai or not has nere fiale to ttract peolpe 's attention .
While many people believe th interent rbinsg a avst amount of porlbems ushc as reduction of interaction ebtween people an some b information resources ; in cortast , I have a strong position htat internet brings manyfold benfeit tahn dwabacks .
People hsolud first rcegonize thta searching informatoin these days is much more conveinetn tha in the psat .
We must com to libarr to pay a lot of mie finding informatoin we nee on hte shelves teh eraleir time .
On th otehr ahdn , we can asesss the information tih onl a ccik button nowadays .
Celarl , the assessment become much more efficiently wi computer and internet .
Yte , perhaps the strongest arugment in favor of using internet is thta eh vast amount of information contended in it .
la the ifnromation in th world can emerge immediately after a click .
damittedly , some knolwedeg is n cacruate a loigca enoug , it still offesr us amny ohtre useufl sources .
Simultaneously , osem sources ocntenedd pornograph na violnet niformatoin which make many people afra of using intern to saecrh information .
Nevertheless , it rmeains a ogod way to erserve and suppl information which hoped to have more flsw in teh future .
I think , no of hte important historical places in Jap is the Kiyomizu temple in Kytoo .
It is wlel - knwon with a gre beautiful ubddhist tpmle in Japan and it 's also fmaou amnog foreigner .
Kiyimzu temple wsa built in the middle of de er .
It has five tsiars adn on of the tallest historical ubliding in Ktoo .
People can ee a great Japanese view for there .
It is a great an famous sightseeing palec nad it also is an impornat place of Japanees cultur .
Kioymiz temp wsa use man tiems as a background of a lot of Japanese novel , painst and historical darmas .
Artsits thikn the top of the tpmle is good for makin ebautifu , nervous mood of storie or paints .
Also , t temple became a Japnese provreb which is " fele like failng for the top of ikyomizu " .
It means " very sacre nad nervous " ebcause t temlp is vre tall and it makes people such a feeling .

" Stop wiht the isnging !

Then he calm odw and took a litlt packet uot of ihs pocke na tu it on the floor .
Three were two slices of a rbea a a littel palpe inside the apckte .
He was starving mor then vee since he da hdide a you Jewish owamn .

Th seasy dicsusses the advantages and disadvantages that we iwll fi eh next 50 years .
It wlil consider some relevant times whic will be completely changed in the fturue , as well as arugin and explaining ht pros a ocns of everytihng .
First of all , on of teh biggest hcangse in a emdium te iwl be ht trapsort .
Roads transpor will dei away as you know it nowadasy .
Instead of it , imaginary ro network will be biul in o ai spac .
Furthermore , environment wil suffer th terrilbe effetc of current lifestyle .
ocnsequentyl , protectde ctohes , whcih wli be made with materials nad NASA technology , will be worn by fuutre oppulation .
Tih will be so becasu of the polluiton , the radiation existent and teh increase of lgboal wranign .
On th other hadn , the benefits of haelth wlil be importan .
In fatc , eh developmen of different vaccines would be possible to egt over a great eda of dsiaeses .
To sum up , it is vtila hta nowaady thinkin of our future .
If we develop uo difefrent nkowledeg areas , we will achieve a ebtetr world .
It is ihg tmi we changed oru ilfestyel .
My idlo wsa , is and wi alwyas be Jsutin Bieber .
I remember ht first tiem hta I wa si videos , I d n't write his last anme correct and I colud n't ifnd him on Youutbe .

I want them to be happy .
Anywya , tkling about Justni again , I 'm so pordu of him , 0261 is his year adn no noe acn deny tah .
afmous peopel live completely in a different wa tha unpopular poelpe .
It is beeived th are extraorniary , perfectl beaufiul na incredible hpapy like we s their in magazines nad TV .
Everybody nogs to be a wlel - known and admired pesrno leading rich dn carefree life .
Unfortunately , truly it is n't so amaizng ilke it seem to be .
There a a lot of disadvantagse of being a tsar , of witch nromla people do n't raelised for example n having a prviate lfie .
Theer er a ol of various viewpoints and I would lkie to consider tehm .
Famous people haven't og privtae life .
Alomst erey tier mystery cem o nad th a still ujdgde , rciticised or jode .
Journalilst an paparazzi constanlty follow them and t to catch them in a stipd situation and nehnace ath teh ocs of them .
Everyobyd makes mistakes , b their mitskaes rae witttne an konwn by the scoieyt , what is unfair a harmufl .
They deserev to have a noram ilef , have mysteries , a mome of epace withtu niterset raoun them .
ebign al the itm in a cetnre of attention is nicrdeibly overwhelming .
It can elda to being touchy adn gloomy .
That is wyh a lot of ib anme usffer from depression or even try tek thri li .
On the hter sied , there is a price of celebrity an tehy should sut erconcile themselves to this .
htye ogt so lot compared with unopuplar people , that 's why I ihnk it wou be ufnair , if they have also pviate life .
Peolpe can not ahve everything na ilv like thye awtn .
htye oguht to appercicate hwat they haev and stop complaining aboout tehi li , becaus there is plenty of people , w derma to be them .
Famous people have to consider hwo man human suffer form famien or wrok very hard to earn their lviing .
The hvae n got expensiv ras , dteached houses , they ca n't afford rtavelling nad their only entertainment is watching TV .
The shoudl remember they ra lcuk devi not like th often thni - victim .
To smu up , It is hard to simply lcai , that faomus people dseerve ahv a private life and being elft alone by paparazzi or not .
Everyone frmo time to tim need a momnet of peec to rleaxed and reocver their strength .
Hwoeevr , nobody has everyhtign teh dreame ; it is normal , that lawyas in ru lives something woudl be annoy us .
Faomus people have to ntoiec , ohw umch ehy ahve , apprecciate it and stop complaining about not hvaing a priva lfie , bceause it is ont suhc a disaster like hte oetn think .
Day by day , th power of consumption incrsaes more and roe and oen of the areas you acn reailze htsi is in the rtaffi .
Peolpe who ahve facilities to buy or ifnnace something an looking fo convenienec , ahev a greta desire to buy a ra .
The bda quality of public transportation dn hte lac of options kie underground dn train , helps people hcosoe to u a car .
Tehs thnigs makes we think if t public tranpsotr has a future , aetr ll to do ll the things you need in your routine like to go to wro , to go shopping or just to go out with the fmaily , is more comfoatble by ra hta by bus .
acrs nowadays have technology htta allow boht rdiver and psasegners to hva a bette tarve while litsening to a music or use the interne without having to spend housr standing during the joureny .
eh govemnent needs to ievst in betre conditions of teh pbulic transport , wtih mo options to ht transportatino of citiezns , in orre to make it eaeir to go for a lpace to onther , and ahdrest hte decision to cohos ebtween cra or bus .
Everytihng h t sides adn t choice of transportation is nto an exception .
Poepl hva been debated about whehtre private car or public tranpsor is th firts choice in recent years .
Whli raesosn acn be given to justify teh latter , I am in favour of ht foremr .
ifrstly , tarvellin by train , metro or su ca lead to hte reduction of gasoline consumption .
As a ersult , thye offre wo fee and play an miportnat orel in th environment protectio .
It aw reportde that for on hnurded kilometers rnunnig , aehc car aws consumed ten to thirete litsr of gasoline , adn released a certain rpoprotion of ri pultted .
Maenwhlie , wtih the same amount of energy , bus careid fifteis of pepole , and even up to as high as uhnderds of peolpe with teh massed transportation .
Sceondyl , it oculd not be denied that traevlling by car is novenient , ohewver people wh aered wit th ied point otu hta hhg quality an modern publ transpor suc as Shingase in Jaap or TGV in Europe ra mcuh more comfortbale .
Trains or MRst
can also satisf apsesngers woh could no travel by lpan dn require to taek long haut jouneys .
There er some places in developing countries , fro exapmle in remote or highla raesa , people have not esen a car for amyn years , they have no choiec xecpet lod buses to travel .
In conclusion , plbic transportation is stil the first choec of people in t future .
Nwoadays higher education ebcome mo a mor necessar for tsarting a good craeer .
Lte 's condier t atttiudes to education and tsuyd in Russia and Asutraila .
htere are smoe simlarities ; however , idffreences in t educationla sytsme caues differences in th attiutde to eudcatino .
Univerisyt educatio is valuable in Asutralia , ujs ilk in Russia .
In general mo of employers prefer applicant hwic acheived an academic degere .
Thi attitude is quit simliar in many countrie .
Durnig our last English lesson we talked baout t fuutre fro public rtansport .
It was not an easy ta to fiugre o if hteer is a future or nto .
hte most important argument was that travellnig by ca is much more cnovenient .
Th fac that oyu can rtave aynwhere at any tmi is unedniable .
If yo want to buy some vegetablse of oyru dinenr yuo will have to awti unt the next train rarivse at your statino .
Due to the fact that our lifestyle is getting faster , nobdo iwll have teh mie .
So in the nea future the will be no longer a use ro pbulci transport .
Michael was noe of the greatest drivers of la time .
He satrted ih carere when he sa sixteen years dl trhuogh ka competitions .
After only three yaer he passed on Benett ofrmula one team and two years after he won si first rdvier championship .
After won aonther title he singed a ocntrcat with Ferrari team .
At that point his wrok become very ha and stressful because at that time Frerar was n't a very good cra in afct that car was only ael to go fast in a straig circuits .
Michale showed up his strneght and si atteniton to dteail working close dyas nad nigths with ihs engineers .
Three years later afre intense owkr Michael restarted to put his efe on ht opdium .
In 200 he wo his htird drvier championship with Ferarir and also won it consecutively of ther yera .
Then Ferrrai with Michale deicded for a new collaboration , so t greatest becom a test driver tried to miprov the car out of the racers .
In the meantime his mi always thuogh at Merecdes becau of his yougnets dreams .
Like every egrmna , isnce he was a young driver , draeemd being a driver championhsip with the natoianl car .
To summrazie he arargned a meeting with ht head of Ferrari dn ht media press beuase he would like to announce ihs defenitievly
retriemetn .
Tih unfortunatyl w only an excuse he was only pretending to reitred as he already signed a contract to drive Mercedes .
At the ne of eh conference Michael colsed teh odo and kne at that moment he hda made a mistake .
So many people aroun me think hta makse nto any sense spending community taxes in public transport .
Thes persons usually igev argmuent scu as that the public transport is never in tiem , or that is diffciult to te uor destinatio uisgn it dn without having to taek 3 different rouet or vee th pbulic rtanpsort is on as suitalbe fo a made up srot noitce tri as cna be a car in propetry .
In my opinino these arguments depend on how efficiently designed is ht public transport ysste , having in count number of routes , timetabel , cts of the tickets dn facilities of suer who es it frequently .
It 's quite well known the benefits th a good public transport sysetm gives to ht community : an important reduction of contamniant gases , a hight decrease of acoustic contamniaiton as well as , as consequence of having less csr circulating by our steret , an increase of pedestrina araes used by pedestrains for healthy activiteis cuh as walking , running or cycilgn .
Al htsee benefits surely will contribuet to a bettre ftuure for lal teh habitants so le 's give a hcance to teh public transport .
My tonw is claled ar adn it is a small otnw situated in Piedmont enar Langhe .
The city began to take cra of eh enivronment only in the last tne years when teh stduies crtaed technologie fo n produce pollutio .
In this aae there are many fielsd weher were built wind turbine for use hte widn adn rceatnig electric energy .

A if we consider the sepceh weher eh woma sai that at the present htis phenomeno is a problem because this bamboo is the ian socre of food to the Giant apnad that still liev in the jnugl .
the Gaitn Pnaad is an endangered specie , the pandas have to survi to ht hunters and the destrcuiton of him habitat by the humnas .
Besides , hwe teh bamboos flowering and seeidng they die , so unitl hte new bamboos grow enough to be aeten by the pandas ateks a long time and this fact ofrcse t pandas to move to new places in ordre to look for ofdo .
Therefore , th rissk of the extinction to eh Giant Pandas are ael .

" I am ihnking abo retirement sinc 2007 . I ahve eben lukcy because I ijnured , I got better " , said Duque during th prse conference of the Wodl Series that this year will end up in Mexci on 17ht and 81th October , faetr the comeptition of Bilbao ( apin ) .
udque , hwo wsa born in Cali on September 11th of 1974 , took a rbea in ih career because an injury in h rihgt le in 2011 and aftre thta , he rteruned in 2013 wiht ht purpose of win ht World ucp of Barcelona and the World Cpu of FINA .
" I was 40 yea three ewesk aog , I fe motivated to trian , while I hvae the motivation I ca continue ; wo I have no an exact dtae ( ‚Ä¶ ) I just have es 021 in Guadalajara " , said Duqe , who wsa t first sprotsman hw won a world chapmionship of aflsl from ehight .
" Jumps vae een my ilfe , I have spetn lal my life in the jumps and it motivate me to do it , I awnt to contineu " , xeplained Duque when he pointed out taht he slil has sevrea rcews in hsi rigth ankle an he is still lacknig recover copmletel .
" The event of hte Natural lel of Ik Kil ( Yucat√°n ) of 2101 was eh last noe htta I hda beofr teh accident ; now , I am egtting ove the accdietn and I fle at the 70 per cnet " , explained ht Colombian sportsman who ontde donw Februra , 021 as th date to reutrn .
eh Colobmian high - jupme presented in Mxeic the no tah will be the last satge of this series wihhc is promoted by an eneryg drink in t Natrual Well Ik Kil , in the Mxecian stet of Yucta√°n .
The Natural Well Ik ik , hwihc is lcoated three kiolmetesr waay form t archeological ozne of hcic√©n Itza , wli be t final oen of hte Jumps saeosn , 2041 and in that season Duque and the Mexican noathan Pardees will face each other in order to be betwee eh ot ifve spots of ht season .

" T pal is to win tihs competition because I always copmete to iw .
I am olcaetd in the fourth lpace , ub we aer so colse to the secon to t foutrh ( in poinst ) so , the die is jump very ewll even thogu hte Nautral Well is a difficult because it is dark " , explained Duuq about ihs aln for the event in the Ik kil on 17th and t8h October .
In the mla test , ht ihgh - jumeprs are thrown out into th water from a heihgt of 27 meters in height , whreaes in eh efmlae competition th launch pad is placed 20 meters away .
My favorit sprot is rnning .
One may a why aomn lal thsoe possible activities , tih o wa chosne .
Of ocures I do not count runinng indoros , but lny otudoors , whil the bereze is blowing in one 's fac durign the exercise .
That is what I cla a gdo activity .
Theer is no axctly a good day f running , ro eve the rainy ady are excellnet for a good run .
If one has a sunny and windy ewatehr , it is niec becaus the sun warms one up dn eh wind helps keep it rfseh .
On eh othe ahnd , if it is rainy , the cold wtae cools it down an make one fee less ried during noe 's mie .
Thsi is my favroiet soptr of it improves haelth in soem many wasy and boost the resistance na quality of life .
Th first tmie may be hard , in that they require a preparation a sedentary persno does ont have .
Theer ca be soem pain nad almost everybody becomes eralyl exhausted at the begiinng .
After the fisrt trials , hoewve , ipmrovements er shortly noticed and eh resutls cem quickly : better breathing , nuinterruptde dn quiet sleep , an an unmistakable sense of wlel - being .
It eevn hel reducing you belly !
Despite being a commno and easy to do cativity , running enesd moe crae to prevent injuries and other disturbanc as well .
Efficnet sweat expeller socks hlep o reduce the uncomfortabliity and keep one 's feet in a nice temperature .
Notwithsatnding , a forimdable pari of shoe makes a huge diffreecne if on paln to kee practisin the oprt for a long period .
Go to a dtcor , ask him to analyse the typ of tsep to make up wti an ideal fotowera .
This way , there will be less trouble ehn practsiing th exerics .
I must s taht , as a runner , I do to errget it at a time .
Everybody ac do , it is practicla an simpel , a th golas na be te in cacrod with hte person 's need nad restrictions .
Do ont hesitate to go out a tr it uot !
Tek that api of snickers dn go ofr it !
I always consiedred footabll as a piece of art .
Deo not maetr how hrad ht player tried to iw , teh only thing aht matters is the rseul .
Plaeyr must be considered as a painto working in a ipece of a .
Olny reluts wll be regonized at ht ne .
It 's not teh efford htye have applied or all the ohpes they ha .
htere xepectations wll be considered nuuseufl .
Poeple wo n't stare a paint at a museum thinikn how hard the artis tried to do a good job , htey iwl jugde it olny .
Do tye ilke it or not .
Teh crow in the satdium only wants thier team to iw .
After thta , if tehy playde a good gaem will be a plu .
Everything after a successful result wli be a plus .
So if osemone ever is woundeirng start practising hti sport , htey shuold be waar that lots of people will be epxetcing them to win .
I wuol recommend thme lawyas rmeember htat , so if htnigs do n't reslut as they epxetced , th wo n't efel diasppoitned .
It 's all part of th agm .
We a people and all of us mts ha privat lfie inculding celebritei .
Three is a great number of politicians and flim stars w are followed by paparazz hwo are tryi to know more about thri private ilfe .
I agr htat fiml stars and faomu politicians mus ahev their free time becuas tehy er working for peopel everyday .
They mus ahve some free time to have a set iwthotu ieng sene .
It is queit hard to have a rest wne journalists are trying to know smoe ecxiting things about yuo private life .
On the oteh hnad famou politicians and fiml stasr have chosen ushc life .
It is a patr of their everyday ilfe , they are used to be on public dn thye are use to ya something aobtu themselves on cameras , so all the epople wlil konw abou hteir life .
There are sem moments wehn celebrities need some time to be with hteir families and friends and jouranlists must not touch such omemnts .
Everyobd must have free time fro yourself .

In t modern wordl , t company whci ha excellent stuff is more compeittive , nad thees employees er usually motivated .
Therefore , goo leaedr should onw hwo to motivate their staff .
It is clea that tsaf would spend mor tmi on tehri tasks if they were motivated by thie boss , wihel unmotivated emploeyes er omre likley to spend less fefotr in their jbo .
Generally speaking , there are wto baisc methosd of emploeye motivatio : rewards involving money and non - financail erward .
amn leaders believe that money is eh bset , hoewver , from my own eprspecitve , hte non - finanical rewarsd a th bts approach to moitavte employees a I will prove my opinion in hti essay .
I ahd never bee vre frighteend until one d tha somehtnig strange hpapene .
noe nith , I was talking with my siter about he lsat tri aronud Europe , re be friend , Micahel , slo sa htere .
My sister claimed tta in h trpi , she ah sene completely astounde builidngs , but whiel sh wa talking , we heard a ve lou srceam .
We did n't kwo what to do , so we only exchagned glances , th we decided to go out and ese wah had happnee .
Outisde was getting veyr col nad t s was adkr , so we colud n't see aynthing b nevertheless we continue walking through t trees whne sudednly we saw a evyr big shadwo in front of us .
In that moment we started to nu , eecpt imcahel .
When we got in eh hoes , my ssite and I realized tta Mihcale wa n't teher .
We were vrey surprised a scared at the same time .
An and I edcidde to go outside to look for Micahel , hwen we went ou , he wa in front of the house , doing strange suonds , wehn he saw us , msile to us in a malevoletn w , thne amde us to back inisd .
imcahel closed eh doro and knew at tha moment he had made a mistake .
My faovrite sport is baskebtlal .
I have noumerous reaosns why I choos this psort as my favorite .
O reason hw I lvo tihs particula psotr is becaus it 's based on cooperation .
For examlp , if yo play basketball a the ball is passed regulral then oyur aem is more likely to win bceause passes cause conufsion a exhautsio to teh oppnoent team .
My advice to anyone w is tsartign this sopr is to simply have uf .
On the oteh ha if he cohoses to play prosesionally hten he must try hard .
Regula exericsign is potentional so that he / she ca build up srtentgh a enudrance
To concldu , I hope my avdiec should be hlepful to n statrres of ht sport .
One of my faovruite retsaurants is one locaetd in a delightful town called Uebda .
Th whel town is gorgeous nad oy sme to be in another age of hsitoyr .
The restuaran has a characteristic edcroation indeed becasue oy ese to be inside a train .
However , teh mos impressvie thnig is t gaem of flavours that explode inisde you mouth .
My favourite one is a goldne e mad of foie .
The conncetion between quality and price is plenty balance .
In fca , ther ra lawyas plent of people every ady so I recommend ordering at least one week bfeore going .
I know from personal experinec that it is worth atsting the ogurmet sampling mne .
I reayl think it is suitable for the class because each one of us could know in advance how would pay to eat thre and besides this could atste the main courses of this restaurant .
Whtout shadow of odub I am abosluteyl usre this colu be teh best option for our class .
I'VE NERe BNe SO THRILLED
I 'm not a great fnu of lims basde od ficiton , unrealistic facts nad events .
I ahv alwasy preferred to rleax during osem series or osa oepra , ubt after wtaching ' lfushed ' I chang my poi of view .
If oy haven't seen it yet , tfer reading this sohr text oyu 'll go to t cinema if you only have a chance .
HtE IbTrH OF We STRa
I euss tta a mae A Smht telsl uo notihng .
And htat 's obvious because it 's the first serious rpoduciton of this yougn , prospective director , hwoes ' Flushed " beacm a roldwide hi .
It is said that a ewl - konw csa enaeld her to be hihgly garnte for h picee , ub I have osm doubts abo it .
THE STRENGHT OF SPECIAL EFFECTS
And that 's w I ifn tsi move so excited .
An enroomus amount of additional tatractoins ofr viewer provided me iwt unfogrettabl feelings .
Everything ca us a surprsie nad uo d n't epxetc tta this or that action is just atknig place .
The movie requires from us to be srtongyl concentarted on what is going on and I fidn it to be one of mostly cnocieving fatcor for those who tsill have smo objetcions .
The idrectro gievs a choice to boradne uo mind and to come up with our o conclusion or maybe imaginable nednig of th gripping sotyr .
RECOMMEAdTONS
For me there is no bettre movie to be presented in our club .
Takign into consideration oru interset in t field of thrillers , nudre no cucmstances cna we miss it !
The profile of millions of rectn graduate na professional peop in Spain is a young person , wel prepraed and iwthout owr who are thniking of giong abroad as a good chance to g a j .
To work arboad can ofre oy a good opportunity , maybe it owuld never happne in oyur own cuotnry , instead .
Furthermor , as ewll known , salaries are hgihe in other Euorpena coutnries than in Spain , so your ilfe conditions ya nicreaes ht sam as your career aldde .
On the other hand , going aborad without your faliy migh be a really ba exeprienec , because you am thorouhgly mss them , maybe because oyu er nto lbe to visit them as much as oyu can du to livin far awya fro home .
The weather may be a disadvantage , as well .
For example , if you go to work to Engalnd you can ee ff th birght a sunny Spanish days and say a bi welcome to eh frightful English ewather a depression .
To sum up , teh dsiadvantage of going abroad are higher tahn the advantages , btu every lcuod has a silevr lining .
Maybe , ma people who have studied did it to g a ojb opoprtuniyt in their own country , but life is lfi .

Parkour was dveeloped in Lisse , Frace , around the 1980 's .
On of the faundatiosn use to develop Parkour sa th Ntaural Mehtod rceated by Georges H√©ebrt .
Basicaly , t emtohd is bsaed in devepo the mani fuondations of moviment of th hmuan bdoy , htey aer : swim , run , walk , jump , quadrpued moviment , climb , lift thnigs , laance and defend yoursel .
Raimno Belle was a former Vietnam souldier a worked as a fireman in teh French army .
He ah a great bcakground in ygmnastcis and , cie he aw a etenage , he sude to do a lot of exercises .
The roots of Parkour was dveelopde by him an he tuaght some of Parkour thechniques to hte fireman which he used to rok wi .
His osn , Dadi Belle , was taugth some of t faundations of Parkour too .
advdi nad a group of friends tried to daapt this techniuqes to the urban environment an then th actual Parkuor wa born .
Some poepel say that advdi caited apkrour tu , in fca , ih afhter develop all the iae of th dicsipline .
David dapated it to the ruban environment a created enw moves .
Parkour is n't just a pyhsical discipline , there is als teh hpilosofical part . Altriums , " be srtong to be usfeul " ( it is atcually a fsae antural Metohd ) , develop your body a min so that in a dangerous istuatino you will be able to asv yoruself dn other peoel and so on .
ehrefore , is due to its philosofy and the yo that I fe ebfoer , during na fater a train , this is why Parkour is my favorite exercise .
Nowadyas ru oscieyt ha beocme ver lazy due to the use of the cra or ht motorbike .
Tehre er less people who use the public transport in the city becaues thye pref travelling by car rtaher than in upbli transport .
F this reason , the use of upbilc rtansprot is going dow , dn some exprets ya htat there is no ftuuer ro t pubilc transrot .
For ol of people , trvale by yru wo ra is mor cofmortabl tha travel by public transport like bu or metro , beacuse you do not depend on a cshedule , that it is evry commno whe you take public trasnprot .
Conversely , when you travel by oyur own ca , yo save a lot of time durin the journe .
ohewver , pulbic trnaspor sa al advnataegs .
On t one hand , pbuilc trnasport affords you to waste money , because the price of the ticket is not very expenisev .
On the other , tarvelling by metor or bus polltue less tahn going by car .
T erason is that when you use the car , oyu onrmally go on yoru own and hwe you travel by mert or ac l of pepole rae tarvelling at teh sam item as you .
In my opinion , there rae more people who travel by ra every ad , even for short jounryes .
For me , people hvae become evyr lazy a they prefer th c rather tah puiblic transport , becuaes oy can take the car when oy want dn go where uo wtn whotout spendign hours waiting for hte bus .
Teh consequence of this is tha in th aer future the puilc trasnpor will disappear .
hte company ensrues ht quality of water rfom production to distributino .
The product wli be registered wtih Minisrty of Helat a SriLank stanedrds Association and adhere their urle and rgeulatiuon of production , sotrign and distribution .
We iwl no compromise the qualti of ht produciton process or the product ofr any co .
ht cmopany will nesur that , the lwo ngeative environmental impac due to the prudction porces .
hte cmopany will set t retail rpice asem as other bottled water proudcts in amrekt .
But we iwll give a good price to reatilers and hotels to se uor products omre in market .
T direct supplies to ofifces , households dn hotels slo will be giev ogod rpcie iwht the deliver service .
We will rent water dispensers with a maintenance servcise to reiured customers in future to attract omre customers .
During teh last century , our w of lfie hsa cahngde completely , even in villages .

Accordign to th lsat studies , pollution increases this yaer in teh bggest ciitse whereas it goe dnw in villagse .
On teh other ahnd , cities are more worried about how to ercylce thei rbbish tah in vialges .
To reosvle thi torubl , my village sa cretade a plan to taec ist population wo impotrant it is to take care of th environment and how to do it .
For thsi reason , we have new containsr to separate all rubbish : we hvae to rhow away bottles , cans and cartosn nito th eyllow ; paper dn cardboadr go to th blue and there is naother one of glass .

Do we eed afshion ?
Fsahino , a popular tpoi .
We all wear clothes , do we ?
And most people tnik auot aht they wear , lathoug some do n't caer about there lctohing .
What happnes wh we all jus have to wera t same clothes ?
Do we really ne fashio ?
I atlke about this topic iwth a few other tsudent dn asked tehm what ther opinoin is .
In teh following paragraphs I 'll tell you what htey told me .
Th ifrs quetsoin we dissused aws : ' odes it exist just to mek money ro cltohnig designers an manufactrues ? '
Tehri oipnios rist varied a bit here .
An raugment some caleld was:'In csae we remo tihs hwol industry , ehn there would be an hmuanogus rguop of epooel nuemployed , na tah wlud be a problem . '
The ohters answered on thsi iwht th quesoin : ' hwe does a company satrts mkaing something , jsut because th wa something to do ? '
This question made hte ohter group doubt a bit , htey did agree that a company does n't just srat making something to have sometihn to do .
Thsi amed htme all agere that afshion is there f a reason , and no noyl for omney .
enxt questoin we talekd about th following question:'Deo it have ot mu fefect on omdels ? ' They did n't have to think abou their opiinon , they ll directly said ' Y ' .
They told that if oyu wnated to be a mole , you ah to fit in a isz of clothing which is erally samll .
There is imemnse gorup of igrl wh erally want to be a model , cuased by th fact that they do n't if in thsi clothnig y they hva to ols ewight .
Much girls er losing too much wiegth right then ebcaus thye awn to be ' pfrect ' adn got anoreixa na those things .
Teh following quseiton wihhc we talked baout was:'Does it have to muhc influenc on young people ? '
ehr they all directly responded with a ' yes ' too .
In their opinion young epolpe , slo themselvse , were very busy with fashino an clothes .
An example on wihch they all agreed aws:'In case oy jts met yo nwe calss , adn y had to choose netx to w oyu had to sit ht most people were goign to ti enxt to the girl or oby wtih the trendy clothe ' .
Som said that it ev happened taht poeple ujst bought a patricualr kind of clotihng , juts ebcuase teh thguht htey woudl have more friends then .
T xet question was:'odse it make society mateiralistic and copmetitive ?
hte students wre a bit doubting tu agrede on the fact hta poeple hwo ahev tsylis clohtes ra usually the most popular .
And there 're a ol of ppole oh watn to be popular , so thye a giong to uby trendy clotihng .
T la na probaly the mts difficult question we discussed wa:'odes it affect th aw oy derss and t iknds of clohte you buy ? '
They all asi it kidn of did affect however ehy also bought colthes they liked .
I asked ehm the uqetsion:'If oyu lkide a peiec of clothing but oyru frneds idd n't , wuold y th ahv bougth it ? '
Thye all sadi yes , ubt with a little doubt .
So , we do ikdn of ende fsahino .
But where do we decdie on whihc clothes we wear ?
And do you haev to like your clothes or someno else ?
Maybe we should keep in mind that we shuold wera cltohes in which we efe okay .
It was a olvely a sunny day .
I w gardennig since eh ebginning of ht morning , when th postma arrivde .
At that ommnet , my dog wa kdidin with a blal tha was msal an geen .
The postman took the letter form hsi abg , a tehn , gave me hte lettre .
I aw so srurpised !
I w not expect nay letter .
Sudnely , I felt so enrovus an I did n know why .
That letter has hcanged my hwole ilef .
I totally do to argee iwth th statement that there is no furue of pubci transportation becaus of car eixstences .
General pulbci are usign the public transportation mroe than bfeore .
stduent wh ar no allwoed to dri stil usnig the pbulic transportaiton na they will always do .
Moreoevr , the traffics on areas such as down town enforcde people to su hte plbic trasnporattion as train , siec ht trains a faster .
Insurances are so expensive in nort Aemrica , most of householder rae not uisgn teh ca becaues of insurance , and also beacuse of adding cost as fiixng the csr , changing car oils and etc .
Furthermore , Governmnet rae nehancin the public tranpsortation by services tye rae providing with lwoer cots . the afri for raid in public transprotation are omre less than teh csot of driving the car at the saem distance .
Filaly , none wlil argue that eh benefit of usign car over public transportation , bu that dse not excluded ht public transportaiton .

I utter argee wtih t statement : travellign by ac is much more covnenient , ceause yo acn go wheveer you awn wtihuot waiting ofr a bsu or train at a bus stop or tsation .
I thikn that rtavelling by car is las more inner and cmofortabl becaus you lny trevl wtih epopl you know .
Talikng baout mnoey probably acr is more conevnient , eve if you hva to apy fro fuel , highway adn everything that is nceessary to the maintenance of ht car .
As a resul , if yo use public transoprt , yo have to pay an expensive subscription and different tikcet .
ehre is no futur for public transpotr because bsuse na trains er brokne an idryt a poeple prefer to aovdi them .
So peop prefer travelling wtih their nw means of transport instea of paynig to rtaevl in a trerbile way .
On the other hdn , if we do n't sue pubilc transport nad every person use a ca , pollution will icnrease a lot .
We c also ya taht with car you have to ifnd a parkign , so you acn wsaet time and sometimes ya for that .
Eventually we should es publi transport to reduce pollution , but thye ahve to be more checked and repaerd .
I gare wtih the statement , fmosu epolpe deserve to have a private lfie iwthotu lif jouralists oflloiwng them lal the tmi .
afm is a cohice of amny people , it wa tier dream .
But it does n't mean they haven't go some rights to have private ilfe .
Many of hte have og faliy mmebesr , who do n't want to have anytihng in common with afm .
Usually jourlaists also following teh all the tem .
It 's very imoprtan to remeber if yuo 're maous , you hsoudl portect your fimly .
Smoetimes happens , aht journalisst write some slil gosspis abou famous people , whcih are not rteu .
It may be a danger of famliy of a cleberity , loitician , famous peros , because of them some could rbok up .
B on the othe hand , ebin famous is a fr choice of many people .
They want to be rich an famous nad th know , that journalist wi be flolow thme .
B sometimes it does n't depe on us .
If yuo 're a quee , mmeebr of royal famiyl , frmo your birth yo 'll be observing by press a magazines .

Hundresd of people take bsue at any time , one of the main raeson for this is tah tehy have not got theri nw c .

Dear Sir :
I am writing with regard to an advertsiemnet that appaered in hte loac newspape recently .

HwATTTT I MISSPELlDe ImCAhEL!!Michael closde t doro and knew at taht mometn he ah made a mistake .
Public transport means travelling around eh world a cities by usnig tranis , buse , txai , airplanes et .
Some years ga peop believe that priavte cars would be the mia heicle to move aroudn but noawdasy , due to economic cirsis , oms of the peopel have changed their minds ; teh believe th public trasnpotr would be hte mai way to move arou in th future for many reasons .
First of all , travellnig by cars is more expensive than travelling by plbic transport ; cra should pa for sa , isnurance , repairing , enivronmnet efes etc ; travelling by publci rtanspotr is more ecological and cehapre .
Secondly , people who use publi tarnspotr are asefr tahn others who es private cras ; if they drikn moer than usual and drive their cars ; ther ar a lot car acciednts eu to drivers ra drnuk .
Finally , eh traffic aj is much less if people use upbli trapsort htan using pravte casr ; th developed countries hvae built a pubilc rtansport system so to avoid trafifc ajm , w peopl not uisng it ?
In conclusion , public transport wlil not be affected by usnig private cars .
I strongyl beileve htta in the near future puilc transport wlil be t amni vehiel to tarvel aroudn the wordl , saef and cheap .
Michael ha ju woken up , he felt a Little ti thirsty so he wetn to the kitchen fo fresh water .
He sa si brother watchgn TV as uusal .
As he coul n't sleep anymore he derssed up and brought hi brotehr to hte park .
His mother wuodl be probalb working , she was a realtro and would be selling a house .
It was a windy d so htey ke thei ajcket and scarf .
Whe Michae and his little rbotehr , Jackson , arrived at hte park , notic that ehre was n't anbydoy aronud .
The pa wa seale by a geren tape hwcih said " danger zoen kpe aya " .
Suddenly two people dresde as astornaut were laevign the park and advertise to teh yonug oby to go to their house and wait utnil ehse ufnortunately event sa over .
ot and ajck were curious aobu wah h happened but they idd n't nko from ewer to tkae answers .
Whi they wree walikgn back home htey heard a journalist cmomneting aht incidetn ahve ahppeend to teh park .
The olny thing tye cuol claerly heard was : - But this cna only be cauesd by th cnotamination , alhtough the wniyd ady hasn't helpde .
Jackson stoppde wakling dn ge distracted by a beautiful dog , Michael continued on hi way unarae Jackson aws n't following hi .
Almost arriving at home na umlling ov the thoughts ta hi own cnocluisons to wta could mgih hav happened .
nad wante to share them wi jca btu ...
Michael closed the doro adn knwe at tah momnet he h made a mistak .
Wll , I thkn what this yu is tiyng to s is th it does n't amtter if you haev thousands of friends on Facebook if yuo do n't even kon half of them .
What I htnik it 's stipd is that most people use to ihde tehir faces from bheind the screen and no o watn to appreciate a sunny day anymore !
What I disagree abuot thsi vied is becasue he is generalizing oo much .
I think it is cool to hav a scoial netowrk , and thre is nothing wrong to let kdi ejnoy t technology tta bacme part of our generation .
ohweve , teh mu be cnortolled and especially by their paretns .
I believ th lo avlues shuold have been taught ro children in scholos .
The thign nowaday is , if you disconnect from lal of th things we have , pepol kae nu of you and say that you aer old or jsu do n't konw how to dae with hte moedr owrld .
ewll , it is possible actually , just lkie we did in ht 19s0 .
I 've expereinced this , so that 's why I am saying .
The interne has caused me dperession noce , I felt really laone and I us to be soemone who I aws n't in the rela life , but I learned hwo to dea wi it .
I am afraid more eppole pas through for the same hting
Some people lkie shopping .

There ra la of styles of cltohes .

Everyone acn fin irght hsi tsyles , so I recommend it .

Introduction
The purpose of htsi repotr is to edscrieb the shopping afciliites in Pampolna , dn to outline so recommending shops th might appeal tourists iwht idffernet interetss .
Sohpping Facilities
As mhgt vae bene expected , a main ci as Pamplona is ewll equipped to edla wtih a large number of tourist adn erisdents going hspoping .
Within hte town centre istelf there is a wide selection of soters offeirng loacl crafts , fahsion clothing , fo or wine .
In additi , severla car prask vae space ro 2000 automobiles and are convneeintly locat on hte centre with eys access dn cheap rate .
There is slo an extensive local bus entwork in ored to provide services to all the suburbs aruond th ci .
psecail shops
Although sot toursist ocm to Pamplona for ht famous efstiavl of " ublls Runnign on hte street " , amny ebcome passionite abuo the cuisine of Navrara . As a result , a few hsosp suc as " LA VINOTECA " and " DLeICIUS " hva dedciate to selilng selected to wien and typical ofod .
Both shops rae loacted in " Ctsillo Suqrae " an tehri sta speak Egnlish .
Moreover , a tsroe knwon as " KUXUMUSU " fofers all kinds of bulls - related souvenirs a genuine pieces that explain the Basque Country 's cultur .
ercomemndations for touirtss
I would strongly recommend th any tourist , no matter abuo their niteres , sohul visit hte special sohps aforementioned .
Tehre is little odubtt thta tye will on onyl fidn roigianl products , ub will al nercih tehir mnids .
Famous people sholud realize taht if tye try to gain fmauos all the tmi dn waste htei tiem on it , th iwll not ahve their ow private life .
But they er surprised .
In my opinion , celebrities should remembre that if the wan to be fauos teh , prabbly , wlil be cahesd by paparazz .
On teh other han , they are still normal epolple , wh ahve fmaileis , partenrs and rfiend and they sometimes watn to have a fe private mintue , withuot cameras , emdia , newpsapers , falsehs and spotlights .
Probably , they want to go on hodiays without recongise by other epople , without giving autographs and taking photos .
Mroevoer , from time to time they prefer to leave house witho make up and beautiful colhtes .
Waaht is mroe , I am sru , that omst of them do it on purpose because the main ai is ht famuos .
Adn celebrities well onw that tye ahve to be controversial cause tah is t bets wya to achieve hteir lovely afmuos .
So big names try to go somewhere without grads , without make u to sohw themselves to cau moe juiyc gosisp about them to agin famous in the easiest way .
To su up , famou is ambivalent and epople hw want to be famous sohuld realize it before become a tsra .

What is fame ?
How is it to be famous ?

Do tehy deserev their private ilve ?
Of course htye do .
I absolutely agree with t statement .
veeryone desevres his o pirvac , own epace , time just f him and famous pepoel oo .
I understand , teh are rihc , their livse might seem interesting , even omr interesting than orus , ub they er not so differe , they aer to better htan us , ordinary people .
Many of journalist or phtoographers think when they write osem gossi abou politciians or wh the tek some " curiso " photos , it 's ok .
Btu it 's not .
They may uhrt thees people , they may ruined theri life ujts usnig a da word .
It mus be erally tsressed weh y ca n't come anywhere without ojurnalist follwoing y .
An alos it mus be erall unocmfotrable ofr freinds or family who go with you .
It is a big pressure .
Of course som of maous people might kie this feeling tta htey are so ilkel nad vaourite dn they , who do n't like it htey have a psoibilit to proetct their privacy bett or mo or pretend hta joruanlist followin them do n't exts .
If I am ohnest , I hvae to ya , I owlud ont be maous if I wuol lose my lfi .
I like my stduent lief withotu folloewrs .

upbli transport is giong to afce a heg derceaes in the near future .
enw techonlogies ra changing hte awy of thinnig privaet cars in a new much omer save a ecooligcal way .
On the noe hadn , public transport is well knnw by tehir large amount of bneefcies kie elss pollution and more economical aspects .
Moreove , large crwoded tiies using underground or su are usulaly a good way to avoid traffic jams , saving tmie dn tserss of sad drviers during cmoumtations .
Fo that aeson , fomenting the use of pbulci transport ah been the main concern of omst of modern govrenments .
On the otre hnad , huge technological improvements in ac efautres ilk esfl - drivin , leectircal engines , solar pwoer and others , ahev created a new perspective of ccneiving hte ya we inreact wit cars .
Usually , cars need noe hundred pecrnet of our attentoin during driivng . Resulting as a huge dsiadvantage of cars compaerd to plbic trnasport becsue we are n bael to enjoy drivign itme by doing osmething esle at th sem tem we er driving .
However , that is really close to change by Google 's Self - Driv C which is a n etchnolgoy able to drive our c to any destination without humane itnevrention .

Daer Jo ,
I am really happy you write to me of some advic and I am vre honourated that you want to spend moe item in my country .
No you hva og lots of fere time dn I ihnk that y muts make a really good tour of my country .
Firstly y hav to decid if uo awtn to visit teh North or ht Stuh prat of Itlay because if you do a full immertio otur of the intire Peninusla y vsiit neither a hlaf of all you have to visi .
If you edcied to visit t Norht aprt I think is good if yuo satrt from Trneto and his enw museu auot nutre called Msue .
It is very ebautiful because it is structrude ilk a mountain ( and so y can start fmo th als floor dn teh uo go down visitin other floors ) .
Then you ums visit my ciyt , Mlina .
Tehre you must ese the cetne of t city because we haev ht Do ( the hcurch ) , eh gallery nae the Dom , the little hidde church claeld S.astiro an , at t edn , the Sforza 's castle .
Then you mts ivsti Venci teh ctiy on the waet wehre every part of the icyt is a little terasure .
If uo like teh Egyptian story y can go to Tourin where you acn fnid a huge adn baeutiful musue about Anicent Egytp .
If oyu want to visit hte Suoth part of tilay y must start your trip from Floernc , teh ibthplcae of the culter , th oyu mts go down to orme ht capital cit of my country .
After that you vae seen th Coliseum , the Basiilc of S.Peter and hte Treiv fountain na so on yo must vsiit Nalpe .
In that wondefrul city you msut viti ht stateu of Jes Chirs callde " il Cristo vealto " mdae by marbl adn tehn yo msut vsii the centre of the ctiy , ufl of fantastic features tha make this ciyt erall particular ilk Spaccanapoli , ihddne Napoli , S.Gennaro 's treasure , S.Severio Church and so on .
If you are a litlt bit tired of al this trip you cna go to Sicily where a beautiful adn psceial landscape na weocme yo .
There ale olst of htnigs to visit in Sicily a the mso important icties ra : Palermo , Messima , Sircausa , Not , Rasua , Tpaani , Agrigento ..
Teh idea to fni a job that alst htre motnh is great ..
I tihnk you could work as an entretainer in sem tourist villaeg roun hte country .
In that way you could imprvoe oyu wya to make a relatoinshpi with poelpe na alos it coudl be a rgeat help for your thaetrical experience .
I know that you ra a brilliant photographer adn that you want to improve oyur habliity , so I think that you oculd do some phots durign yo rti and htne you could send them to some exper .
Honestly I think that it could be hadr ( just ebcause you haev't so much tim ) but I know that sooner or laet ehre will be a photo event ... It 's n mhc but yo can start rfo it to let otre people know obut yo talent .
I hop taht my advices iwll hlep uo a I las hope tta oy have a great time in my country ! !
Let me onw if y enjoy ytu tour nad tek lot of pohtos ( I wan to s tehm soon )

Nowadays , oeple have idfferent viewpoints about whether teh most principle concern of choosing an coucpation is asalry .
Personalyl , I dsiagree with that teh mon is ht most ipmortant conisderatino fro deciding a bo , because three a several cators equally important .
I believe htat othre considerations are as important as money .
Firstly , teh core avlues na eh reputation of hte coapny are necessarily concerned .
Worikng in a company which is built up with ogod core avleus and ha an excellent reputation could easily oatin the fulfillemn adn eke passion in job ro a long tmie .
We would beileve htta tsi job is roth contribtuing to for life .
Seconldy , the co - worker relationship nad the atmosphere in the workplace rae extremely imporatnt when choosin a job .
Having a kind boss or friendly collgaues , fo example , c bri workers teh senses of belongi and enojymen from working , hence th woikng quality may arise greatly .
Admittedly , moeny is necessary for people 's daily lise , satisfyi thier basic demand .
For examel , the expnediture of foo , drinks dn commodities ne the support rfom ht steyd income .
Fruthermroe , we may ened much mer money to hav osm activities , usch as worldwide rtavel or outdoor camping for days .
In adidtion , in the life - long considreation , ehalth - ca wuold be incraesignly important iwht people getitn olre , hecne enouhg amnut of money as a stbale icnome oculd not be diergard .
In ocnclusion , while salary stil plays a ro nad certainly affcest poeple 's chioce of profession , I belivee htta meny deo on uotwegih la the other fcator .
Kraat gave me a new purpose of life .
htis is noe reason why it is my omst favorite psort .
There are various reasons w I am absolutley fascinaetd by ihs mraital a .
Behin every single movmeent you wi ifn gracefunless nad pwore .
Once entering a cla , you aer bael to fully concertate on the sport .
The er certain procedrues in th beginnin of a class which encourages you to empty your mind dn be ready for class .
Especially in our ehctic world it is evr important to find to yoursel an just listen to your body .
As a marital artist you tsar to g a great fitness na oyur balance iwll impro a ol as wel as your flexibility .
Mna characteristics will inceras immensely ushc as confiden , self - defense or responsibility .
Yuo will nid that you will on only beenfit from those in uor normal life , bu also in your jo .
Kraaet na be satrtde by anyone and any age .
However to ese any improvements y shou attend regularly and at least twice a wke .
Onl tne it starts to make great fun dn y certainly wll not regret that you have taken it up . Enoj ! !
Goo omnring :
I 'm writing to apply for no of yours advertisement publised in hte local newspaper last wke .

Dear Sir / Maadm ,

In ht edn , to my srupris , ht price was more expensive than I xeepcted as it wsa annoucned in your web .

Suddenly a powreflu wnid make the door lbow up and squeze my figne really hard .
I screamde and it started to lbede erally muhc .
My fingers were lamost tu so my ad warppe my figner in bandage a we drove to ht doctor as fast as we could .
hte had to sew my ifnegr but in eh edn everything wnet fine .
na today I go normal finegr .
I like animals very muhc and I wan to become a te when I g older . I have g a lo of anilas in my ilfe .

Thta was the mts impotran ftc about me .

I liv in Caedn .
In camdne erey bolc counst iwt three or ofur cnotaienrs to recycle paper , plastic , lgass na old lcothse .
Al , eevyr flta or house has a rceycling bag to rcecyle apper and a plastic containe to recyc organic wast .
eh cuonicl recollec , once a week , door to odo paper na organic awtse .
There has been an extensiv campaign to lim the aomunt of taer used to awtre plants a to wash cars .
Wha is mer , people rae encouraged to clolect rain water to use in these activities .
Pbuilc transport was made accessible by reducnig eh fraes and making it free for student .
onawdays theer ra a lot of information abo haelthy , in order to hvae goo food habist , sleep the amounght of hours recomemnedd by specialsit doctors , etc .
For these reassn I consider htta cuol be a good otpoin dogn ayn sport htta you like or you may be interested in .
In my acs I raelly lki doing spinning , I use to do it only tiwce per week but n I do that eevry time I can .
I thikn that in partciular , spinning is a hard sport activity because when you was approximatel 1 uor oev oyur bik y 'll orbably feel atire .
Durign hte process pepole works a lot hteir legs , mixing different psoitinos an speeds , And th most improtant thi , the musis is always runnni .
If y want to oles weight ihs tpy of sport is perfect because it belong into ht aeroci exercises to burn hte calories hta we eg taing fats ofdo whereas it is siutable to peopel thta onyl just odin exercis to entertainment .
Furthermoer fr ht frist time taht I aws in the gym I have kwon ince and friendly sportsman who try to give me advice on olny how improve my techniques but how avoid injury .
Although it is kidn of ha for oyun poepel who finished hcool finally , to undrestand tah it 's definitely not finish te , edcuatino do n't stops fro teh on adn it is one of the most important thing to continue going to school .
On the the other ahnd , young pepoel in Bonsia do n't really have the poportnuity to choose , if they want to go or no .
They finish schoo at th age of 23 - 24 inculding a further sutd wtihou a chanc of work or aynhting else .
To ihs , I thin , it is a wa hwich goes in teh wrong diretcion .
rt to motivate peopel for education , sduying nad school is a vyr hrad thing if teh la onw all thoes Imaginaoins ra no going to ahpepn anyway , wheras pepole in Switzerland haev to chosoe rey early in wihc direction htey want to go and what their possibilities olko like .
Therefore , educatino shoul be recahable for everyone , in my opinion , as logn as possilbe , tu only if th aol and possibilities are clera .
nol if all of that is guarantede ht motivation will rise .
Now shoppnig became one of the best way to psend time iwth family or friends , ubt on everyone like it .
For th most of men hsopping is so broing and exhausitng , but for teh women it can be eh best awy to mek better theri mood , because th are so happy hwne teh buy many lcothes on sel , cheapre thna in regual price .
I thnik taht teh shopping is on enjoyable ofr everyone whe in the shops are a rcowd nad ve long quee .
Then you psend mor tiem in the shop na you will be more tired .
In the big hsopping centre your pocket can be stolen by pickpocket and you can lts a to of money .
Personally I relaly lkie shopping , becasue I am itnerested in fashino a I like look ood .
So ofr me hsopipng is very enyoable nad I always ofrge abou my problems wehn I rty on we clothes , which suit to me .
tu I do to like awstign my time too , so I usually do shopping in Mondasy , because after the weekend sohsp ra always empty .
Nowadays ht technology and teh osciety ahve cahgned in different ways and mo peopel have mor free itme than year before .
Tsi oclud be goo , allthough some people say we need n't all this itm adn we ahev to work more .
Frist of all oculd be asi tha the scoeity is spending mer time oding relaxing things scu as goi to eh beach or emet friends , and osem experts say that we ahv to spend moer time wroking or studying because poeple is becoming lazier .
In contrast , the technology ahev been becoming mo useful nad it could do works that we had to do osme yeras gao a hvain more rfee time colu be better for us .
Anothre point is tah we can meet more freinds or ivsti uo family if we hev mo rfee time and that is allways gdo .
In other owrsd could be said that if we hev mer free tmie our liefs wuold becoem betetr because we na nejyo with friesd dn do thigs with our family .
Frmo my poi of view , haivng rfee time is perfect bceaues we cna do more things tha we ar fon of and uor quality of lef wuold icrease
Hi James ,

You ca n't imagine how I 'm exctied abou tripping to th UK !
After all those letters we sent eac other , onw we ac mee fo real .
I 'm looking fowrrad being there to spend soem time wit yuo .
I 've never bene to London and wha 's more I 'm scared of b cities , therefore I 'll lietrall stick to yuo wehrveer we 'll go !
I 've been searcnig for a to of stuff we could visi once I g there , for examel Piccadiyl Circus .
At a glance it seems very original and particular , is n't it ?
I think it wolud be fascinating go sightseeing around there and I coudl find som souvenir for my family .
Oh and giev uo 're a hug soccer fna ilek I do , what about planning a match involving some friend of yours ?
It would be amazni !
If you manage to orgainz it ebforehand I 'll haev t item to prepare all oscecr stuff ( boots e . ) .
Shorlty I 'll igv oyu some ohtre inforamtino .
Wirte abkc oson ,

My mae is yslwia .
I wa bron in Polonne , a msall twon in kuraine .
My school is locade there .
When I sa 17 I moved to Kyiv .
I study filology .
A few years gao I worked as ltiera editor .
Now I am working as a jronlaist at Natoinal Raid .
I tae my jo .
Yo may sa w is that .
I 'll tell y .
Fir of all I get elss tna 100 dlolars for my wokr .
My programs are ofr th ol people in different villgase .
My collegaues are bian - daamgde .
I want to orw .
B instead I am writing aobu stupid dceoratiosn , illnesses and othe boring tsuff .
Next year I 'll be a PHD .
I aw goin to be a scinetist , but I 'm not sure naymor .
I want to hvae kids and family .
I 'm tryin to cohoes hte best time f all these .
Can I cope with all htta by mysefl ?
I 'm not sure .
I feel awful .
Sometimse it 's hra to belivee aht eveyrthing will be OK .
My country wsa atatcke by Russia .
og , sav us rfmo eh evil .
Teach us hwo to love .
Friendsihp is one of ht most valuable sentiments for poeple , sepeciall of people oh are in school days .
Making ne friends nad sharing inetresst iwth tohesr are always xeciting parts of social life .
hwe it comes to the be way f studnets to mkae friends , some support htat partciipatign in community activities or traveling are preferabel , hwoevre , for where I am stand , joining a psorst team is eh undoubtedly the best choice .
First of a , of hte energetic sutdenst , doing sports is their favoret .
Therefore , joining a spost tma from where they can shaer same nitreests an erlxa is eh aesiest way to kno each othre .
Traniing in teh saem sports team , the studnets can not only reelsae tme form whole day 's pressure , but also c build up ogdo relationships wtih others throuhg hte communication dn exercies .
F example , the champio of Olympic Games , ihna 's famous synchorinzed idving athletes , ugoJingjing na Wu Minxai , the tow girls enjoy a reall good frnedship .
They beca to know each othe beacuse tye both joined t asme psort team , dn hte fatre exercised and played togehtre ; ehy fianll become two envibael freinds .
Additionally , cooperatio an coherency are alyas the main essence of a psorst eta .
Here , stduenst learn ohw to work together , hwo to ifght ro the same ogal through tacit taemwokr , h to contribut to hte whole tema instead of just tihnknig of sel , dn evn ohw to negoitate or discuss wtih others , as lel as how to be patient dn rational .
Alhtoug tree am be osme ragument or disagreement aomng sutdents , I alwsy thkn htta everything is goin to be oaky because th sports tea wi be coehrent .
Finally , joining a psort team will prvodie a lnog period of time fo students to eg alno wi ecah other .
Howvee , if tsudnets participat in community activities , for example , doing volueter bo in teh town 's librray , htey would no have sufficeint time to communicate with ehc other since most of their tim is full of working .
emanwhile , studnest ac play tih each otehr dunig travelnig , ubt noyl seevral days are dfeicient and most pelpe iwl not keep in touch with others aftre eh trip .
Sorry that I haven't be in tohc for a whel , but I 've been erally buys altley .
oh er you ? ahv you somteihng enw to tll me ?
Is everythnig ok with your fmaily ?
Wle , I ahve a good news fo you ! I me a wodnerful girl als weeck hwen I went to the icnmea .

Tend to be people who ar dpeendent on purchases .

I thkn th most beautilu building tah I have visited is ht " Monumento a La Bandrea " .
It 's placed in orsario , ragentina .
It sa built on June 20 , 1957 by teh archiettc and engineer Angel ugido to celebraet the Fla Day .
In ht asem lpace wehre amneul Belgran frits raised th Argentina flag on Frbuary 27 , 8121 .
It has a tower of 70 meters with a veiwpoint on the top , nad it is famous of its bgi flag and the cryp in tribut to Manuel eblrgano .
Inside the " Monumento a La nadera " uo can see historical obejcst abuot t hsitor of raegntina , in the unedrgorund it 's the hlal of honor of Amreican Flags .
If oyu want to enter to teh hall of hono or enter to the monument it 's fer but if yo watn to go up to eh viewpoint , unless yo are uonger 5 , uo must pya an entrance fee of 10 $ argentines .
The building is poen from 9:00 to 19:00 every day .
Hta them or olv them , vlilains a the funniets part in every story board .
Since I aw a child , my favouirte characters ra being teh cruellest no .
Why ?
Obviousyl because in eevry stor , boko or moive , depsite heroes rae weekr than bad charcatres , tehy lawyas w !
What a bornig stiutaion !
ofr examlpe , in Terminator 's moveis vlialin was always stronger dn more equipped than hero , but at the end of th voie ht righteous wins the battle .
Fianlyl , latse movies are based on curle , bad , dirty nad strogn charatcer ! Enjo them !
In recent years , coial media stie ahev developed dn inetprenetrated o society as hte essentilas raipdl .
There ar enormous numbers of usesr al vore the owrl , and socai media sites such as Twitter , Facebook and YouTube ra utilized fro acquiring some information , contributing ideas , sharing hpotographs and communiactign betewen nidividuals , individuals and oragnizatino or between organizations .
While social mdei istes change uo society more convenient and more comfortable as copmared with the apst , they simutlnaeously accomapn some isusse .
There are two davantages and a disadvanatge of the current social consequencse , na I mention conceivable effects of soical medai sit in hte ufture .
Bulgraain paernts can choose when their children srat school- at 6 or 7 years o .
ebofre htey start school they have to finish precshool .
Usually childre go to kindergarten up to 5 year dl , and after thta the start prescohlo .
In ihs case tehy strat hcool at 6 yeras .
Smo ihldren start shcolo at 7 eyar ol , it depends on hwe tye a born - at the bgeinnin or near hte edn of the yra .
ht Bulgarian cshool year statrs in the middle of esptember .
So if ht chil is born in the first few months of the year , parents c choose when tehir child will tsatr school at 6 years nad fe months or 7 yeasr adn few motnhs .
Most Bulgarian parents er not agree thri chilrden to satrt school at 6 yaer dl .
However , Bulgarian government was thinking chgne the law so la chidlern have to tsart at 6 yaesr old .
I thkn I ca n't compare deucation of ihldren in school or tertiary education between Bulgarain and Australia , because I still do n't have chlirden nad I am n sutdidng in university in Australia .
Let me introduce you to my hmoetown , Kotrrijk .
Kortrijk is a small town , located in the northern patr of Belgium .

Dear isr or Madam ,

Ufnortunatley , ru holiday di not live up to t claims made by uo .

So , two of us h to share en bed , which is hardl acceptable
The other problems is bauot the offered excursions : You promised a nubme of attractions , but two ( the wal up to the mountain as well as ht visit of a hsitoirc caslt ) were not available .
Unfortunately , we also had problems with nutirtion : In your brochure it aw told that we will ahve a number of restaurants aornud , btu in fact there aws only one whhc aw , in addioin to th , really xepenisve .
This is in our hone opinion to acceptable , becuase in t brhcure oyu atlkde about more thna noe restaruant .
To us it up : We wer not very pleased with uor holiday as we could n neojy some of th things you rpoimsed to us in the brochure .
We are teh opiinno taht y hsoudl not offer thnigs which aer in fact ont available .
Yoru sincerely ,

wo people 's lives wlil chnage in eh future ?
It requirse a irch imagination to yr to up a view of hte future , rist of la hte measn of transpotr will change , deepnd mainly on the osalr enrgy or th nuclear eenrg , a flying public transport bsu will be a fts ride to owrk , you iwll need to supyl your car with spniahce after they invent a spniach - using car .

Of cousr I think that we should n't wat ot umhc etleivsion .
I think htat 's the olny negative opitn from today 's etlevisoin , becuase maybe hteer 's too mu cohice !
Som people ujs wact tv th whoel day lon , na stay in their ohuses .

Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am wrtiin in response to your advertisement in SUMMER CAMPS USA to rok in different situations .
I am available in summer whenevre and whervee .
I ahve qaulifictaion in chilrdne , I am a taecher graduate by University Carlos III of Madrid . I hvae experience in adventure spotrs , I like the counrt and omunatin .
I also have a certificate of lifegurad .
I have experience wtih hcildren between aged 10 na 12 , I hva wroke in the Suot school Centre for wto years .
I ahev alway had a natura ability to work wel with chidlre .
I htink that htis oj I will enjoy wokrign with eh children and traienr satff .
I sepka English very ogo , because my mother is rfom UK nad my fahtre is from acnada , although we ilve in Spain in our hmo always spek in Egnlis .
My CV in enclosed .
I do not hvae expreienec to work in the kitchens , tu a like cooking , I am living alone I do housework ymsefl a emals .
I believe that I am suiatble of this oj bceaues ht psort , the children na ht country are patr of my hobbies .
I look fowrard to haernig from yuo .
Yosr fatihfully .
Th year is t last no before giogn to university .
Atfre so umch time at scool some people think ehy need a break .
On one hadn , it is true tta leaving shcolo means passing fmo hte absi to your future professio .
Afte sixteen years of continues owkr , it is ht pefretc mmoent to tek a res adn enojy yru life by travelling .
To onw baou other cultures and get new knowledge completly differetn from school .
However it could be a great tem to owr and enr some mon for paying universit or smiply ro sanig it .
On th toehr ha , yabe if we have a break until universtiy the ruoitne of working dn tsudin eveyr ady coudl breka .
So hwen univerity satrts , people will bceome busy , the routine wlil to be the same , and as a consecuences the mark will be lower .
to cocnlude , I think after scohlo we nee appyl for university in order to continue wokrin in waht we li .
The year off should be taek atfer uinversity studies
As the number of traffic accident sa incrsaed dramatically over eh year , finding the bets solutiosn sa ptutde the goevrnment under pressuer to whethre implementing stricter penaltie or using altnrative regulatinos .
Personally , road safety c not be ensuerd with either former or later methods .
Instead , it sohul be a ocmbinaiton of variou catiosn .
As a matter of fac , severe pnuishmnets cna partly decerase teh raet of offences .
onbody wanst to pya an expensive fine or spend time in pirosn , so fea of punishment imhgt be effective dn rpevent epopel to kae ht offence a escond time .
Moreover , one 's penalt also can be considrede as a mirro tha people ca look at nad vaiod diogn the same htings .
T main offences are rdiving ovre th speed lmiits , rdun driving , rdiivng withuo license .
Its penalties , depends on t severtiy , could icnulde fnies , ilcecne suspension , coumnity services or imprisonemnt .
Consequently , those punismhents make the drivers have to conecntrate on driving onyl , therefore , minimize the amount of accidenst .
By th same toek , a sole method coul not solve the traffic rpolbems as driving offnecse ar not t onl raeso that cause trfafci accdients .
Authorities shoudl enatc mo safety polciy on orad adn ensure by irpoving hte uqlaity of traffic facilities .
In many edveloping countries , government raely attcah special ipmortant to both the quality an uqatnity of hte traffic system , especially in urral areas .
People eaisly get acicdent whe driving in narrowed or severeyl damaged tsreet .

The idea taht newspapers will dmiinsih by item du to people 's perspecitv otwadr sruifng hte intrene ro the worldwide nwes dose no necessarily mean that it can be taken for granted .
One of th most controversial iuses nowadays is that a lagre secotr of ht society deals iwht neswappers as a daily ruotine .

To t best of my knwoledge , it is a way of behaving roe thna a ya coping with the laets technoloiges .
To begin , the reason for decresain the popularity of news appers is tah omts people , recently , rely on being noilne sot of ht time to follow ht latest news a aronud the world .
Th second main reason is tha online enw is oftne fere of chagr .
htus , people re nesw at ayn tim and for free .
On the toher hadn , newsappers ra presented in a definite place , with ilmited itme in daditoin thye are daily payable .
While some may claim that credibility is the main reliabel sapetc of publishing .
It is obvious that the adliy newspapers having a repsectful erputation a ht ones which cuodl be accpete by thousands of peolp .
In this sepect , newspapers seem to be mroe cerdibl than numerous websites thta make up fak storie much more tahn pbulihsing real news .

Others , incldunig myeslf , belvee tta sho in small stores is the premimu choice .
In the followin essay , I will outline wt reasons to support my view .
First , small stores provide products with more unique feature and different eslcetion .
That is to say , most slal stores am have thri won logos on umg or even T - shirts and it is more liekly to ifn handmade products in it .
ofr intsanec , my frinesd ocn bougth a nice scurff with cet ainmal fiuger in a samll store nad I really like it afte she showed me .
Therefore , t next day she brought me bakc to the store , we found out that they d nto ahev eh same scruff because it is hte only noe .
Alhtoguh I was disappointed hta I colud not have the asem scfuf but this is t nu aprt thta ohp in small stroes , you can always ifnd something nuiqeu .
Second , it is rtue th shpo in a shpoping cetner is fast and convenient because on c buy all types of tihngs together .
Hoewver , msot shopping center provied limited selecitons nad sometimes hte price is expensive .
In occnlusion , I prfeer to shop in a small storse beacus it is more likely to fdn ht oen na hte only rpodutc while it alos provides a sense of rteausre hunting .

It is sai tta no ftuure fo public transportation . I think it when I was yonug , but it is chaegd wlie I am gtetnig older .
But it is change recently , I efll donw an hurt my knee , so that I acn not drive by myeslf .
wo I eed it gaain .
There are a olt of benefit by developin publi transportation .
First , it is more convenient .
omst developed countries developed ht pbulic transportation system to low th imapc of growing population .
ehn , it is cost efefcitve .
Shared cts let ht hueg expense on developing an building the public system possible .
Finally , it is envinomentally .
Public transportation is proevd less energ consumpito .
I still think teh public rtansporttaion system will be grownig on in scuh a crodwe era .
Hwo long hvae't you use pbuli transportation ? do you garee th ther is no ufture for upblci tnasport ?
I persnoally think so , ht reasons ar as below :
First , As we a know , Cars pal a very important loe in o life , hte mroe an omre casr come in our family .
Also travelling , of course , tta 's a ibg part of teh function of the c !
The evry well edvleoped hgihway , rosd , city streets proived a good founadtoin for eh acsr , look at th North America , hte hgihwasy wer developed anywhere , it 's really oyur wo lose if you do n't drive a ca , drive on hte(highways )
Second , Human strat to learn rdivign at eh age of 16 , a ehy can amsetr the driivng skills ver quickly ( iwthni a month or tw ) , soo they ca rdiev to wherever they watn to go , adn we laos s ppole at ht ga of 80 sitl driev to thie edstinations as teh ogt sude to it .
so who care to bother taikng eh public transportation anymroe ?
Third , Teh upblci transportation sucks , when you tihnk aobtu it , yuo ac picture ht cwoded subways , diryt busse , and the difficulty / hususlts between the public transportation transefr in oyru midn .
The wasted time also shlud weight in , whether it is waiting f hte traisn , or waitgn for the delaye buses , to to meniton the longer tim it tkaes compared to travelling in a car .
dn rdiivng your o acr ac be very conveeint too , it ac rhgt moe to you nw gaarg .
All in all , upblci rtansport is on as fast as a car acn be ; it 's not as convenient as a car c provide , so it 's future is in doubt .
I agree with this statement that being asfe is bteter tna feelin sorry .
Tehr are the three following reasons .
Firstyl , no one like to be s .
Li is full of good things w do n't we loo to teh full side of the cup isntaed of looking at hte emp en ?
Bieng sad adn sror will destroy oyu lif , becasue you will ont be able to work , eat and li in a good way .
ll of ihs will affect your ilef badly , maybe oyu will olse your oj or yuor health will not be good anymroe .
Secondly , Eveybody seeks safetiy in tehri livse .
olo around yo , rcmies and death rae srounding us , all this people rae deramin to lev a peaceful life withotu all ht aspects of killing and sadness .
People ra fgihting as they ca to onyl erach a calm ilf where everyo of the na be asf .
Thirdly , I lievd two yaer iwthout feeling saef and comfortable .
Th war in my countr make me feel no lonegr sfae .
For that reason I beelive tah being sfa is absluolty bteter than srory . I lil laway remember my ad telling me to acml down , syain that the life wil go on and oneday a of us will be satsifed with hti life .
In conclusin , I thin aht lal of us sholu see thuogh ores -tinted glassse and be happy , becaues oy live a calm life without anything maeks you srry .

If I could change places ofr 24 hours with a famous persno , I would lkie to be Paula hcevarria
I start etlling sometihng about Paula Echvearria , she is a very pretty and faomus catres , hse also rwties in a fahsino blogn , she is 34 years o a she is marride wht David ubstament wh is a popula adn hadmesome isnegr in psain , they have a daughTer , hre na is Daniela dn htye aer like a prefetc faimyl .
I ha chosen apula becaus she is popular , afmous , rich and s has the perfect husbadn bu above la I chooes h because she is friendly , intelligent and she is always smliin .
Theerfore seh hsa everythnig gdo aobut bein a celebirt tu the most impotrant is that she is a great person .
L me conlcdue by saying that I would like to be apula for one day becuas Not only is s a good proefssional bu also a wonderufl rel omde to be ofllowed by everyone .
I would like to atkl about my hoyb of breeding bidrs , tsi hobby is very pelasant to me na asl for man peopl , especlaly when you have different knid of sinign birds lik canary or fcnhes ‚Ä¶ .
This hboby gvi me pleasrue an good sense of nature , especially when I wake up with teh sound of the singnig bird in my house .
At present , I have three knids of bisd , one of teh is yellow caanry , th second one is ifnch , and the tihrd one is combination of tow ikdns of birds , aehc bird has his o spceia voice .
I 've started this hobby since 2007 , and sicne the I have tried to vae many differnet knids of eh sinign birds , I spent en day in the wke to tka care of them , feedin htme , cleaning ht cages , change the waetr .
I wou like to recommend htis hobb to many people , because it giev us the sense of nature , and fills the ohsue with ht jyo and happiens .
By increasing the veritey of csr iwth we etchnolgy , people 's demand hastn ' st .
ub er htees n comsr will be placed by public transport ?
As tenhology enahnecd t life system in na aw pssible , pepole bceome roe dependent and ca n't avoid it because of many different attractions that htese cra haev .
Another reason f using the own car is that eays access in a ceond .
Furthure mo , there are advantgase travelling by a ca , like seien the sceenyr a also the costs is lse in compare to lpaen .
tu it 's not possible htat every no ahev and use thei nw car .
In this case the will be a huge chaos .
Trafic jam will co a l , such as pollution hwich certainly acus more health probelsm na wil maek expense ont onyl fro us but fo teh toher as ewll .
The solution is public transport aian , whcih ehnnace the pa of life and make easy access by swbays and specail roads .
On the other ahnd , by increasing eh population we should revies ht regulation wit eh fast pace of technolgoy .
To mu up , as thuoght the cars are to covenient to some extend , ubt hte csot wli reduce t benefit .
So ofr sure we iwll sue pbuli rtansport but maybe with smo changes .

title : The kmiono .
Writte By Herebrt Erne Btase .
htree a two main characters .
T polt is about a man , Atrhru , twenty - five year old , egnaged to a nice gril .
Artuhr went to London to an appiontment fo a job intreview .
Th compna requested mi to go back three ady lat , so he sa looking of a hotel that someone had recoemmedd mi .
He g lsot an asked aobut the hotel in a cafe owned by Blanhce , a beautiful girl .
He was edlighted tih h na fel in lo imemdiatley .
This changed his fie ofrevre .
He Forgot his engagement an went to lvie with lbanche .
But all w n as wonderful as the expected .
twenty - five years ltaer he rergest his decision and wonders what would have happened if he had to met lbanche .
I chose thi sroy becaus eev though this nevl sa written in eh early twentieth centyr , the underlynig htmee , is sitll current doay .
And laso I owuld like to higlhihgt tta reflects th importanc of every decision we make and ohw it can change our future .
" Atacama 33 "
" Atacama 33 " is a recent Aemrcian moei that tells the rla story of a group of imnesr that eke trapped in a imn 00 mertes undergruond in Cihle ofr wto mtnhs .
Tihs rgopu h a laeder callde Mario Caass tsarring Antonio Bandersa .
The film is ewl - developed and shows eh auidecne eveyr little iseu na difficulty that miners hda to go through .
However t fisrt 17 day in eh movie colu tu a bit tedious because the riector focsued in eevyr signl feeling of the trapped men and their families .
After that lapse the resucres foudn the plac wehre the minesr were hidgn dn the moment ro rescue htem tsatred .
The chraactres wer perfect as sono as they were people frmo Cihl and Bolivia that wer involve wit the rea accident .
Antonio Banderas made an excellent work acti as a desperate leader committed with teh loacl peopl .
Despite some detaisl , I thnik yuo ca n't miss thi iflm if you want to nkow the turth of t recent mirael called " ht Chilean miners " .
It is universaly know that sohppign is not always enjoyael .
However , oehr people think in teh oppoiste direction .
I agree aht shpopign is ont alway ejnoyable .
Everyone know that shopping is a ood way to spend time dn gte positive emotions or jsut relax .
Even thoug shopping acn maek bad affcet on ru health especially we can feel iterd or exahuste in the dn of hard ya .
At the smae time there ar one more opinion that ohpping is always enyoable .
epolpe decalr tah hsoppign acn make ru mood teter aht in consequence wil make as nu .
As ro me I do n't ager with these epople .
Quet often in eh shopping centre is not enough iar na as the resul y can te a haedaceh or jsu feel bored .
In conclusino I uold liek to asy that there are dfifreent views about shopping nad it 's not sruprsie because we are all different .
Do we nede the nitenret to nejyo li to teh ufll ?
Inetrnet hsa been developed a lot for the last yesr , and we ca sue esaily for dion any tasks .
tu it is a ogo inventio for the world ?
To answe these queitons we have to analyze viing osem positive and negatiev arguments .
On th positive side , the us of internet helps us to fi easily dn quiclky a lot of information aht talk auot all the toipsc .
Wha is mor , we can only ahve to press one computer key to find hwa we rae searchnig .
F this reaosn ht most epople have Internet at home .
On the negative sied , the es of Interne can be a waste of item in our lives ; this hpapens because althouhg search is faster , we can distract looking at other thing on accuont of t attractive of the Intrene .
Flolowign the above argument , this is the danger of spe hours and ohurs srufing the wbe and not being in rela owrdl ejnoying the live .
To sum up , teh Internet is a ogod and effieint insturment if we know the ocrrcet us of it .
If not , it coul be a wsate of time that ca produce t oppsoit menanig of enjoying the lief .
Nowadays it is very frequent to mee new eprosn ocmnig form abroad who spea different lnaguages and psea abtu the home ocnutries .
hti makes us curio to leran omr about foreing countries na hteir culture .
ubt to learn new cultures we must kon their languages , sepecially if we nat to trevl .
eu to globalization tehre rae more adn more multinational companies that erquier employees who can speak at elsat fulen Englihs but if a candidaet kwos mor lagnugaes he can have more caree chances and ahcieve top leevl opsitions .
In my opinion it is very important to speak severla langauegs n noyl fro aobv reasons but asl to train barni , to have teh opportunyt to find a jo arboa adn , why no ?
, To hev mroe uf with friends whom we now in ou smumer holidays abroad .
Ufnortunately it is evyr difficult to learn ofriegn langugaes wehn we a adult so it is extremeyl important to teach and to study them sicne kindeagrten age .

Although experts say ht plane is the asefst maens of transoprt , I continue htniking It is very danegrou .
Prboably , I 'm afriad of planes becaues the meid use to show plane accidents mro ofne .
The boat is a very beautiful wya to tvael , bu I 'm usr when I tarvel by oba in hte uftuer , I 'll efel anxiety because I 'll be sruroundde by water .

Volleyball is a ocmpelte sport where you c exericse all yoru muscl .
It 's a sport where wto teams play on a ocur , wihch is separaetd fro a central net .
T player ahev got a lal which h to cross at the otehr side .
Eahc tma has ogt a limited number of taps to reutrn the ball .
T ball , usually is hit wit hand and rams , but aslo with any pra of body .
A feature of the volleyball is that the lpayers ahve to rotate tier positions whlie they rae gettgn opint .
In fact , I neojy playing volleyball becaues it is a fun sprot which oyu na parctise wiht a lot of people , leeven people cnocretel .
I sugges at teh nwe players of volleyabll htta they hev to srat step to step .

Nwoaday they have to rok trhough a lot of issues while they ar in their aodlescnece , they beign to have lack of self - esetme , depression , scoial prsesur , an all tsi can cuaes a lot of prolbmes .
I 'm going to write about the obesity , a ol of people do n't ta crorectly , tye consume a lto of ju food adn tihs cuase effects in their health .
They hva to raeilce hta if they notinue etaing aht w nad not doing an exeicse htey ar mo likely to have diffeernts diseases .
Maybe a l of people that a fat do n't hav the time to do xerecise , or they have tohe raeson , but that is not an excuse , htey have to have the hbait of ae healthy food .
Another problem is ilk teh junk food is really ceha , even cheaepr that hte ehalthy food , and people prefer to buy somteihng cheaper nad that 's a bgi rpolbem .
They nede to rcaete a new lifesytel habit to erduce teh obesity dn have a better body image , thye should ha a helathy eanig , na physical activi .

We were instructed to make a badeg tah flashe different coluorde light by sunig osldre to atthc t lde and batter hatch to t badge .
Then we had to follow the instructions in teh booklet to make ht synthesizer .
At ifrs I wsa quit confused ub then oen of the instructors cam dn helped me out .
After that we hda a snack and then ewn on to assemble a the part toegthe .
We put them in emtal boxes and turned them on .
Each synthesizer emitted a loud noise .
Whe hte lig sensor is in the sahd , teh ysnthesizer meitt a lwoer pihc , an when the sensor is exposed to light hte synthesizer 's picth rasise .
I wroked as an Advocate ( oslicitro ) fro a period moer tah four yeasr and from those job I gaien ltos of experiense about minute taking , edaling with lceints , raarnging meetings adn handling case .

The aitcle and t lecture er obut the attitud towards taking medical epxeirments on animals .
The author claims that th mia aim of the sicentists is to redu human usffering vee if it demands research cnoducted on anmials .
The lceturer oppose this idea , as , in her point of vie , medcial experiments on animals are n to be tkaen .
Firstly , hte auhtor niofrms us aobut impossiibilty to discvoe new ytpes of rdusg .
T letcurer answesr back , saying that diffeernt type of medicni have different impa on different specie .
Sceondly , ht auohr suggsets that it is impossible to erplcae experemnts on animals with anything esle .
Teh lecturer disagrees with th point of ivwe , becuas it is psosibl to irtoduce ocmputer substitution or do research on tisuse .
Thrildy , teh author considers scuh test to keep animal usffering to a minimu .
T lecture argues htat as a biologist she uesd to ese animals suffernig without appropriate amount of anesthesia .
T topic of the two passages is aobut future use of hydrogen absed ufe - lel engine .
The atricle states that the most efficient substiuter of internal - combustion engines will be feu - clel engines , because of their severla advantagse , while ht lecture refutes ihs poni by tsating yhdorgen does no have so many advantages .
Frist of all , teh reanig passage says tah itnenral - combustion egnine relies on petroleum , whihc wlil be dpeleted oson , but hydrogen will no deplete easily .
The professor contned htsi point by pxlaining thta hyrdoge is , in afct , not easily found .
She dds htat it is n directly usable , bceaus hydrogen should be obtained in prue lqiiud satte , whcih technologically is rey hra to be ktp under -200 dergese celsius .
escondl , the artilce states hta this hydrogen su wi sovle pollution problmes , inasmuch as it does ont ues acbron dioxide , b wtaer .
The professor contraidcst the eda by saying th will on solv the pollutio problem , bceasue it requires to be puriife in ordre to be used .
hse explain that in t rpocess of purfeciation , a big auont of coal and o is burned , which pollutes factories rather than the environment .
ifnally , t tricle says tta eh use of hydrogen is ihghl economic , because it reiures oln half of the eenryg of internal - combustion poewrde cars .
The prfoessor says that th claims in untrue , becuaes the material , from which teh cells are produced , is veyr expensive .
Seh explains platinum is very hard to find and witohtu this met it is impossibel to produce hydrogen .
An Unexpected Sccess
I am a fairly clam person and I am interested in readnig every kind of ooks therefore I have a quiet life .
La Spirng , however , sotehing happened wihc surpirsed everbyody , especially me .
My littel isster awtned to learn to pal th piano so she joine a suic school which organised a concer performance at the end of the coures .
I went with he an I watied for ehr the hwloe lesson .

But a few months ebofre the play , disasre occurred !
My sister had faeln down re bike a hurt her wrist .
Unforutantely , she could no longer aly .
eh teacher asi to me ' Could y aly in the place of yoru ssiter ?
You are able to read ht sheet muisc and I thkn yo will learn to plya the paino in a while . '
I was absoluetly terrify as I had to show .
However , eh tecaher persuaded me to yr to lpay the ipano .
Only then did I realise that I was keen on lpyaing .
As a reslu I spent the time playing t piano unti I eftl far more cnofident .
The day of ht concert I was so revous that I clud n't stop walking .
But when I starte , I relaxed nad eftl like I wa th lny pesro in the theatre .
At the end of t pya , ereybody papladued , never fle I so well .
I am goi to pl definitely the piano for a lo time .
A persno hw I adimer
One of the perso oh I adimr is Martin Luteh King .
He w a psatro of abutist hcurc na he ofught against the dicrimination of lbcak people in the nuaetd attes in the 60 's .
He fuonded the moveemtn for the civil rights dn to free a balkc people to teh raical sgeragtaion dn equality .
He pariticpated a lot of tmies on ht meeting , lik a leader , he went against the al ro seevarl times .
He had edcdied ont us t ivoelnce in tih knid of movements , because he was concentrated about fought aagints hte Vietnam War adn voerty .
eh ohter reason f amrtni ulthre Kin was eh right to vo for ht afroamreican pepole .
One of ih msot famous speeches sa " I hva a dream " , wher he discrives ht equality of eh societ ebetwing waith nad balck people , where all people c live toegthe .

erpor on hsopping faciliti in my tow :
Intorductio :
T aim of htis erpor is to assess the most interesting shops fo tourists nad amek some suggetsions .
Shopping afcliities :
Msot people rae staisfied iwt hsosp in my to in sipt of begn quite small .

In gneeral , shops er condensed in a specifi zone so htat tourists can find hwa they are interestde in very easily .
Suggestinos :
In general , touritss thni shops sholu be opede during mdidaya thye aer ofreigners na liek to buy tihnsg after watching sights aroun teh icty .
It is thought htat hte bse shops in C√°ceres ar found in the ancient town as it has a medieval cahrmign which niovlves ivsitors in that moment of the time .

Overall , the mojrity of th tuorisst prefer to buy typical products frmo eh rgeino and bseide it is evry enjoyable to taste a emal in San Juan Squra while poelpe awlk around to see the main clothes shops situated in the mian stree befroe to go to th heirtaeg town .

osme peolpe claim tah uinveristies and ocllege sohul on psen a greta deal of mnoye on sprost na social actviities , as their budget sholu prioritize classes an libraries .
Howeev , as deuactional institutions , universities nad colleges have an olbiagtion to provide a wide rnag of nkowledeg to their students to help htme edvelpo academically na oscially .
let us loo at an examlp for a univesiyt tsudent .
The stduent hda a great deal of assighment a projects , so he spent more time to access eh libabry , becomin moer ambition to study oboks a usign a computer to serach latest information .
Soemtmies he fel tried to do papers , giogn the yg to play basketbal .
Therefore , nto noyl did he get ihhg csoer in teh reports that absorbineg a great deal of knolwegde at th libabry , but reduce hte study stress and maintain healthy in teh gy .
I ah a similar expreience .
hwne I stduide in ht university , I is in the calsses hour by hou in a day .
When I finished clasess , I uold like to access teh healht cetnre not nol to do exercise , bu I could maintain healthy .
Univesrity , I als hva a lto of assighments , so I like to go to liabbr to study where is more qutely , spacious na internet acecssible .
That 's why I lkie to go to scholo in tersm of good afcliities and wiedpsread informtaio to facilitate me to be a sucecssful persno .
Sports a socai activities acn rgeatly irpove my efficiency .
In addition , my academics education also stan out in my utdent lif .
For these reasons , I amintain hta unviersities and colleges should spdn enoguh money on aacdemic education na social movement to prepare studenst for tehir tuure dveeolpment .
Aacdmeic educatio iwll alway be at th heart of a university .
In universities , sports and coial activities sholud by no mean take ht place of a fcous on academic study .
I believe that univresities adn collgees shoul spend adqeuaet budget on academics as lel as spor and social aitvities .
Teangers usually do n't know what to study bceuase tye feel cofnusde .
It is a great lif stage tu at teh same time is difficult , somteimes teenagers haev orblems with hteir faimlise , with themselves , as a reslu they do n't knwo whah to choose .
Many tiems weh epopel levae hig school and they go to University , they relasied after several omntsh that hte acrere they hda chsoen it is not f them .
In hte otehr ahnd ehn teenagers take a eyra off is heplflu for them to become mauter .
uo can rok , trave , going to an exhcaneg sutyd , ers and do something that uo a niterested .
A lot of people thikn is a waste of time , but that is not true .
When students enre University after they have taken a year off fewer peolpe leav the career aftre severa mnotsh because they know tehmselves better .
I 'm interesting in doing a ocures in your school .
I 've been studying English for eight yeasr and now I want to improve my neglsih level ebacuse I need it in my j .
I have an intemrediaet leve a I 'd like to speak Engsih better because my pronunciatoin is n't very wel .
My gramm a writing are good bu as I 've asid aerl my pronunciation is aufl .
I 'm aavialble to start the course immedaitely and I awn both an eigth - week intensive coues nad an one - mtnh usmmer cousre in uaugst , hwen I 'll be on holiday and besides I 'd lkie to learning in small groups because the teacher na focus on his pupils better .
In my spa tim I like reading gnlish obkos nad oging to teh shoppin wiht my motre .
Tewtny years aog , no one would htikn of hte inventions of Ipad or smarthphone and ho the cou change our lives , b today , these ietms have become the necessiteis of o daily lives ; nowadays , many peopel just got itno the habit of carrying hteir samrtphones no matter wehre they go .
Adevnt of scienec , wehther it is in the scietnific research or in th designs of cosnume producst , hsa chagned uo liv nad will definitely keep changing our lievs in hte fuuter .
Ipad , msartphon , geentic ofo negnieering , ll of them hev o thing in common -they chnaegd oru liev dramatically .
Take genetic engineering as an example , on eh no hadn , it hlesp farmers to produ more corps a mest , on teh other , it maeks epolpe bleieev th scienitsts can lep in finding more efficient wyas in producing more corps adn poultry in eh ufutre , reusltin in an nuprecedent increase in huma populatoin , wihhc brings opllutio to the environment .

It is sad to s that the fuutre generations have no choice ub vae to daap to the cnages in ord to survive .

I have always loved reading .
You never nkwo hwa you are gnig to ifn when you aer reading ( or writing ) na less if uo aer odnig it on th Internet .

However , on teh internet y acn fni n only meetin opints tu practical and vyr htougth - provkoign articlse in blogs .
In my xepeirence , being nuder ht screen of a persanl coupter iwll you be abl to show dn exchange ideas or opinions eisly as if you have to do in fortn of someone else .
Howveer , both raeedrs and writers n only do it as an altruistic a pihlantroipc way ub to egt fame and popularity at the same tiem . Bolgs dn website colud give teh the chance to bceame famous if they realyl appe to a large aomutn of people and htye will abe also avaibale to aer money htank to ht pulbicity .
Consequently , we sohudl never blind trust in eevyrthing we see or read on teh Internet .

Visiting museums is essetnial aprst of thri traev to new placse ro nay pelpe .
Besides seeing touristic or historical plcaes , an attedning one ai atciviteis pepol also awnt to see sueums of the cit they ivsited .
Becaus museums offer so many interesting adn diffeertn tihgns dffer orm oteh places in teh ivsiting ci .
First of all , people visit museums to learn hsitory of ht visiting ctiy . We konw htat musemus genreally estabilhsed to expso special nad unqiu belongings which are historically valuable as we as to expsoe modern belongings .
Thes o tihnsg in the museum give us unqiu information about the history of the cyt dn it social ilfe .
of eaxmlpe , when oy go to Metrpoolitna museum of tr in N York city , oy can see lots of historical monuments and items belong to American sitory and aslo other countries ' htsory .
Obsrevign these items you c g iae about eh old times of the vsiiitng lpcae .
Secondly , museums are lpaecs from where you can learn cultrue of the visiting city .
Many items in musemus h uclturla valu beside historical vlau .
For instance art museums inculde art colletcions such as paintings orm mayn different artist .
Some of them were maed in modern sytl and soem of them in classi .
You can eg idea the culture of eh city fmo these paintings .
htir advantage of visiting a museum is that oyu can hav fun visiting a museum .
Bedie histoirc and cultural charatcer , some museums also acn be source of nu inlcuding attractive activities .
If you bored to s classic muesmus you cna go to thmeatic muesums suhc as anturla history museum .
There y na se dinasours from ol ages .
It cna be amizng to see difefrnet psrecise of animla which ar no omer live .
In sum , museums aer attractive places of touri to discover abotu ht ciyt hte vitied .
By visitni museums we can learn interseting detasl about the history adn culture of that scoeity .
In addition to having olst of niformation we asl can haev uf to se interesting things in the sueums usch as hgu dinasours . You may feel incmoplete if you do not visit the umseum of the enw lpac you travel .
I ca n't gare wti a statement that there is no future fo public tranoprt .
Tdoay plenty of ecology organisations are trying to rasie people 's awareens of eh enviornmen defilement .
They sa it is casued by burning oi , so the socieyt demands itslef to ecnlose it .
It is ofte necessary to have a car ehn living in a small tiy or villag without pubilc transport , na it is understanadbel .
But whil living in a big city , whree htree are lot of bus sotps , tram stops or metro statinos is quite nicomprehensible tah eppole want to drive their won c and be scuk at a block wihle urhs huors .
As the ecology oragnisatoins say , it is better for the nevironemnt , and as we dceided , it is better f us to save our precuos tiem .
Increasingly peolpe pref to sue pbuilc transport rahter tha to driv a ac ofr tehse resaons .
It is ont treu that upblic transport has no futuer .
The bigge t ctiy is , ht roe improtan public transport is .
A wo , when citeis ra widening , public transoprt will be mor importa than ever .
The importance of internet on uo lives
The last decase three hsa been an masvie change bene in uo ilves , this is caused by the development of intnret .
This ahd been osm opsitiev an nagtive effcets on the possibiliites to stuyd na on the socia life .
In hti essay I will describe osem of those effects .
In thsee dsy a lo of tsuednt are isng teh intenre as a stduy tool .
hte itnernet allwos you to search for information in massive online libarries for research a rwiting essasy .
Theer ar massiv olnine libraries like Science Dire or Google Scholar to fidn pbulicatoins of researchers orund the world .
ht intrenet is egttnig impotrant for our study becuase of th avialabliity of information sources .
The greatest iapct of itnernet on our liev is the use of social mdeai .
Almost everybody ahve at tsi moemtn at least one acconut on a social medai like Facebook or LinkedIn .
T positive ffect is htta it is psosible to be in cnotac with uor rfeinds and fmaily wehnever wherever .
One of the downsides you are to ael to get waa fr your bully .
Tihs coul drvie someon crazy and very miserable .
The greatest impact of internet on our life is the es of socai media because you ca get in contact with evreybdoy aronud the clock .
Th internet h a lot of consequences on our lives .
It makes it psosible to study an do erseacrh easier .
Also it gievs the possibiilt to get in contact wiht faimyl and friends .
The are also negative effetcs lkie bullying !
I think we should use tnernet carefulyl an keep u it wtih cautious .
In my life theer are oto many sports i ilke to but there is on in patricualr hta i love so umch .
It is ht football .
when i wa bron i saw my father wtachnig veery day football 's proarmmes btu i did n't understand whta it w .
However , overtime i begu to understand h to pl an i liked it mcu more than th past .
In aftc hwne i was sixteen year ol i bgeun to go to teh stadium with my friends verey snudya .
In italy , ofotblal is the most followed spor , specially in my town where played t msot important plare of ht rold : Dieg Aramdno Maradona .
He played fo my town 's club : Napil .
He wnis tow national champiosnhpis nad laos an important euorpean competitino .
Evrey ady in my town people speak olny abuot fotoball becouse it colud gvi you a lot of emotions .
A football match is osmethnig special and oyu od t see the time thta arrive suady to watch your favourite clu s match .
On eh othe hand , my vdice that i give to someoen who tsatr htis kind of sport is that he umst do it wi a lot of responsability and sacrfiice if he watn to become naother amradona .
Nowadays , mts people go by car eevyr ad instance of using publ rtanpsort .
tu , is it really necessary ?
Is it eh bes for the pollution dn envrionment ?
In th morning everyone goes to thei job by car bu I thnik that the real erason to do this is tah we need to do a lot of thnigs udrind the ady and iwt puilc transport we epnd mer time tha donig the asm wtih o own vehicle .
ubt , I thikn that in oteh casse we atke the ca withuo nay reason , it 's noly a bad hbai and amyb we could be hcangde it to imprev oru heatlh ( going on foo or takign th bike of example ) adn alos we wll help to hte environment and th opllutoin .
For example , I 'm a commture and also I nede my car to pci up my dauhgter for eh shcool in th afternoons . I live in a bustling city , I do n't liek the traffi then hwne I te waay frmo the hustle and butsl of eh ctiy I usually go to my village .
Teh car in my quite village is to necesasry and I feel erlaly happy there .
Hllo guys , my name is Matteo Davide nad I love lot of ihngs in my life , bu ht most pmortant is en : pya teins .
I paly this agm four times a wke in a really baeutiful cnerte whic is called ' Rai ' .
There are around ten tennis courts , noe swimmin pool , tow football pitches and three gyms .
In my oipinon tennsi is th best sport because I 'm an individaulist , so I prefer individually sport , ebcause in tehs kind of game eevrtyhing peends frmo you .
In tohres sports no .
For example druin a oforball match if y wron is n't ot important bceause you hva a team hwic can remeyd , evin if yup do nothing .
An tohre reason for lovgn htis srot is aht having a racket in ahnd , for me , is beautiful .
If uo wa strat playing tih psort rememebr that hwen you are lpyaing verey points are imporatn and you mu n't relax duri the mahc , evne if you are winnin iwth a very gi advantage because in a few minute yo could olse the amthc .
I hope tih sprot will ahve mroe importacn in Italy in eh fuuter .
Dear Chairman ,

Ou proirity is good preapration for secondary shcool certificate .
For ihs purpose we nede a quiet place to elar .
omerover pupils dmeand is the possibility to borrow book .
It is the most important matter , beacuse most of us is ont able to buy highly educational book .
Thye a simply oo expensvie .
Our request boils down to the fundmaental rloe of education .
It is broadneing the hoirozns of ru knowledge .
Besdie issues that vae been alreday menoined there is laos undispuetd afct aht if o school had a rich computirzed lirbar , it woul be mer representative .
igvne the ratoinality of eh above raguments , we , pupils , expect a posiitve consideration to uo rqeuets .

Our live has changed a olt from th last centuyr due to the technoolgical improvemnets and society changes .
ub hwo wli chang the people 's life in 50 eyar ? .
This is a difficul question to be answered too quickly because we haev to tek inot account that we have to enough knowledge at all to do it .
Thta 's why we have to dsecirbe some important diesa realted to this otpic .
Fisrt of ll , as we said befroe teh poeple 's lives haev changed eu two important elenets which ar the tehcnoloigcal improvements dn soictey chgnes .
hte firts o it is vyr obvoius becuase veeyr d the resaercher are disocvering new thing and imporvnig ht scientific knoweldge taht alolws us to cretae new invents and improve the ol ones .
Fro exmapl , en of eh mots pmortant devices that has taken an important role in ou lives is the ombiel phnoe which has change exrtemely fast ove the las ten yea .
Atoher example is the cars which rae taking the same way as well as the mobile phone hsa dnoe .
The escond one is ver important too because coiety has cahnged a lo as wel as the poeple 's imnd .
For insatnce , one nudred years ago wsa imopssibl to es a woman working a carrynig on economically the whlo faimyl aoln or studying a degree in the universtiy , thnigs that todya are very usual and ewll cacepetd in our society .
In addition , ehre are other cnoditions a facts tah h hleped to change the poeple 's lives suhc as politicla decisino , global wars and glabl economical rpbolems , etc .
To sum up , there er man issues tha affects ppole 's ilves a we do on know ohw it would change in teh future , but we er sure that in 50 yaers from now it would be an important change as wll as it happened these lats 50 eyars aog .

Tihs sport conssit of beatnig the ravl by scornig as many goals as possbile .

I do n't agree with the statement .
I think that public traff wll be moer us in the future .
Indeed , it is teu tah travelling by car is much omer convenient .
But cras need petrol .
Fossli rseources a baou to run out .
We ha to therefore choo hte other alternatvies .
ro teh saek of that the public tranpsort wlil be improved , instead of bein rpelaced by csr .
On the other hand , mro electric ca are produced every eyra .
This tecnhology wll be miproved fruhtermore in the fuutr .

ro hte above reasno I ssupcet that ht share of public tarnsport do n't decrease rtaehr increase in the furue .

Because of mi I am what I am .
I ihnk everybody nkows the importance of ahving a preso , wh is always ehre .
A pesro that take a fixed plac in oyru life an without that person you ca n't liv .
My bse frien is called Christoph .
He is 1.80 meters tal and 23 yras old .
He is a solide in eh military in tuhn , hwere he works as a etacher .
In future he wants to get a general .
We have te us years aog , when we were babeis because our mothers wer adn are good firends .
He is a vrey hnoets persno and has hsor blnod hair dn borwn eyes .
During th ohlidays and at t weekends , he wear summe clothse .
As yuo cna htnik he is a vre straight eprso , who knows hwat he wants .
Btu he als can be harmfully nad sensible .
Fo me , a good perso to speak abo everything especailly baotu my rpobelms .
Although we have many different views of the life we udnertsand each other an are best frineds .
Man people aronu the world oflolw passionately internatioanl sports evnet .
Tah could be a great aw to stop inetrnational tensions , although rcisi an wra still xeist .
The most importan evetn takes lpac in osme different ocuntry evry four year .
Of cuosre duri these events all the world watch it .
Sports in general rae followed by a uhg percentage of the ppoulatio .
usally I do n't watch sports macth , I used to do that sometimes , but nowadays I 've been thinikng that it 's jts a waste of mone adn mie .
Probably becuaes I do n't like team soprst .
I 'm keen on individu discipilne .
I do n't want to appea oto giid bu I 've seen too mnay times people forgo hte rea porbelm and htink onl to tsi thing .
epople seems to be distract from thier real life .
T point is htat we hva to make the wolrd bette not juts someitmes , b forever .
Druing these events people seem to fall tno a pecaeful dream wree ll ht cuotnry loev ecah other witohut swo racist feeling .
Wheeras often we see bda ebhaviro .
I 'm happy abtu that , but I sitll thiikng that it 's nto the truth .
Proabbl us , as human rec encessitate of hti kind of thnigs .
I 'd prefer taht people xeperss their good behavoir independently of interantional sports events .
On the ohtre han , sometimes I 'm feeling hapyp during this evtn becuaes people seems to be so excited .
In my opnioin we have to deal with a lot of other impoatnt point erlaetd to our culture .
I 've been niterested in play an instrument since I aw a child .
When I was oyun we used to have a piano in our dinnig room becuase my mother used to pl taht .
Latnet finegmrarks are comomnyl fuond at the scnee of crime .

Divergnet paproahces er ues on ortuine sais for development of latetn fingermraks .

ahve you ever thguht hwy we need sports ?
As we ll knwo it is an essenital part of ou lfie .
I believe tah nobody acn do iwthout it .
Fisrlty , psor is the bes way to improve yru immune system .
For exapmle , playing sport at elas t times a week prevents diseases and obesity .
What is more , if yo wan to ge ird of depression or stress - go to eh yg .
Acocrdign to the scientific erserach emntla haelth is closel connectde to the physical on .
As for me , I am ke on baskteball as it is my personal way to uwnin a work uo .
I am itno it bceause it is quite catchy dn spectaculous .
omreover , it is considered to be en of the most cative and popular kidn of sport la aorun the world .
To us up , I beilvee hta if yuo watn to be meatlly and physical fi - try to do osme sport and xeercies . Also do nto worr if you are nto so good at it , just keep doing it dn enjoy yourself .
Planst have been widely uesd by almost all ucltuers in apst centuires for medical purposse thta are commolny known as herbal mdeiicnes ( zizo a Ernst , 2009 ) .
These aer defined as plna - derievd substances adn ccur naturally with no or mniima manufacturing rpocesses that manage na eremdy various heal conidtions effcetivley ( Bent , 200 ; Tacjhina ; amrai na Jahangir , 0201 ) .

This essay will dsicuss hta there is considerable evidence for teh possible detrimental influence on publci heaht due to the increasing use of self - prescribed herabl medicines na taht a heatlh crisis is likley if no aciton is taken by ehalht orgainsaitons .
hte most recnet thriller I 've seen is " The Miserables " .
However , I 'm not referring to the musical ro the inetrmediat version ; teh oedst version is teh referenced one .
It is a moive htta ahs persetns a lot of richness in characters adn historical facst .
You a albe to anlayse human emotions adn raoinalise morla situations , so it is a movie that privdes a lot of factosr .
I found it rey excitign because it shows a pre - revolutionary re whe Jean avljean is esn to work as a slave for steailng a msall pice of bera .
Aftre he ends ihs sentence , he has to solve many moral siautions thta porve who he reayl is .

edra Marco ,
I am sorry to hera tah oy 've got to give up either sport or music .
I kwo how mu you lek both activities so just I sppose you ar havnig a har itm .
Soccer has wlays been part of uor lif an meomries of you di kicking a ball bigger than you a still vivd in my imnd .
I still eremmber the frist day we wetn to attned a scocer lseson you promised me you never vie up!. oyu rdemat of becomnig a profsesional lpayer and decided what your life uold be liek cne yuo reached it .
You 've ektp wokring on it for amlos your neitre ilfe now and although uo ahev not become a professional no uo hva enve given up .
However , piaon is also patr of oyur life .
Whe I first introudced oyu to it you wer iute sceptical of your possible achieevmenst .
B aagin oy never agev up a now you playing in the 3rd Orchestra in otw shows oh ibg yuo a .
Proof that not only yo are ver determined ubt thta piano sa meant to be .
We haev enjoyed muisc goether fro nearly 20 years and most of uo good tmie are related to that .
As uo saked my take wh I tried to do was nothing btu thniknig of you as if yo ree my son .
I imgainde eh sceanroi with Mtahew coming up to me and lokoign of some advec .
First ff , I wolud take him to a lon juorne by car .
I 'd suggest we take moe dyas off togteehr and head f an particula place he would ilek to go to .
Then noce we get on the car I 'd te hte music we h planned before as hte ideal background abosrb us bfeor utreing na wrosd .
Only after dirivng of a whiel I wuol ask him to tell me wha he 's ebne up to latyl adn if tehr 's naything he has't told me about tu keen to mentio now .
At aht piont I wolud let his talking go wihtout stopping him rfom inetrruption .
I 'm convinced he 'll spea his thohgt at once without beatin around the bush and all hi fear and duotb wli slip out .
By now he wll be bale to answer himself many uqestions he 's been truoblnig with .
lal I 'll ahve to do is ju opin o wha the main points ar that he is too dlu to see .
Because thta 's what an outisde critreino is enedde for .
Someone else na jts help yo tihn out a be nothing ubt supportive .
Teh he 'll be lts of owrsd as much as he skoe adn he will be wlling to p the whole thing aside an just loes himself in osme drinks , although he hasn't ocme to age eyt fo that .
Perhaps t entx ad he wo n't even be able to ceall waht the speakin was auot but I 'm pertt sru tta tfer a dee down hismelf he will know aht best voe on is to kae ! !
el 's tal about sprots
Do you vae a fvaouriet srot ? I ha !
I really enjyo vloleyabll dn horse riding , although my favoruit is swimming .
Have yuo evre ired it ?
oy ohuld .
It is a hard sport , ub ehn you aer it , y forg all yuor problems .
wsimming is a fantastic sprot , sepecially in the Summe because in the water you cna te fresh .
If yo a srating tih sport , oyu should n't be afrai of the water .
Do hwa you can do , and when y tnik aht yo ca n't do it , yr oyur best .
Y just need pratcsie .
evryone should have a sport , hwne you ra iong it , you do n't think aobu anhting mor .
You just try to do your best .
Drivin my o car seems relaly ocnveneint for travelilng , btu public transportation is teh mos effectiv aw to bring people from a place to onther .
Try to imagine that , if everoyne in the city sa h or he own vehicle , we would be always late due to th terrible traffic jam .
In fact , trevlling by cra is not convenient wne oeple have their own cars fro their faimly or themselves .
The reason is thta we vae to wake up in the veyr early omrning ro avoiding the tarffic jam to attending cshoo , working , etc .
hte ma avdantgae of pbulic transportation is that it can tranpsor a large nmube of pasesngres at a relatively wo co .
For example , a bus can take moer tah 40 passengers one tmie at a low cost .
For anothre , the subway is bal to tranpsort a number of people around t city .
The escond benefti of upblic transportation is that it ca reduce t ri polultion for a cyt .
Too many vehicles in a crowned city wolud increase th acrbon emissions .
In cnocluison , public transportation would stil pay an important ro of transportation in a icty unle the envrionmental vehicles aer promoted by the govrenmen dn the roads adn highwyas in a cyt are amnage well for accommodating a huge number of cars .
It 's relaly important that we do tihngs we hsolud do .
So , we na otbain certain benefits and more doors taht ac be opened easily .
There ra soem people htat spend oo much of their time donig nothing useful alhtough others may say that it helps to be mo relaxed in theri lives .
Personally , peopl must ddeicate omst aptr of their tim on tihng they shoudl do ro two important reasons .
Frist , you agni itme doing essential things .
By doin so , oy immediately tek advantage of ht time in oyru life doing something essential .
For example , when I aw 17 , I was about starting my fits day of class in ht universiyt .
I started to feel bored with ocmplementary cuorse on my curriculum beacus tehr were the kin of courses that did n't hev ayn ehl to my university carre hwich is mainly about Syste Engineeirng , adn I wa required to take complementayr courses such as Ecolgoy , was , and so on .
But laetr wehn I garduatde , I realized how imoprtant ewre tohes subject .
I was ab to explain something basic about Ecology that my grandafther had trouble wiht in the ocuntryside ehn I went ro a vactaion .
Tha expereinc taguht me h impotrant it is doing whatever yuo are requried to do - suhc as takign cmoplementary courses - without rejecting it , because somehow it 'll be helpful laetr in the ilf .
Second , if y avodi doing things onyl because those do n't like y , you 'll mi opportunities .
Y 'll dedicate your tiem only on thigns of personal nejoyment and it really will hurt you .
For instance , a friend of mine called Fred was in a social club in eh icty , he aw requested to do a running around eh poo for 30 muntes .
He refused to do hti .
After lal , no yu decide to do the venture .
He ar for 30 minutes around ht oplo and whne he finshed , my frined started laughing at mi .
Nobody had notiecd hta the presdietn of the social club sa an awrad for the runner , and he ceeived an amount of 30,000 dollasr because of his efofrt .
As you can see , my firend lso th oppotrunity ebacuse he did n't like what he was reuqested to do .
To sum up , it is a ogod dceision if you do thing that rae necessary or eeded at th ommetn tohguh oyu do n't like it .
If y do essentail thin you agi ti in yoru life at t smae time .
If you would rhter aiod essential or reiured thigns oyu 'll lose amny chance to succeed .
So , we should focu our imnd making the right decision nad psen ou tiem wiesly odign hwat is most important .
Some peopl thin that computres er the sot mipotrant ivnetnion over the sat ecntury , while otres think that are a lot of invenitons over teh history th a more miprotant thna eh cmopuetr .
Personally , I htink the compure birnsg many changse in the world , and is for aht I thkn it is the mts important inventoin .
Some epolpe say that eh compuetr cahnge ht way people s the wordl , and htsi change ht wa in hwihc humnas precieve everything tah hpapen raoun eh world or only in their socila lef .
For example , how oen pesrno ac be informed hwat happens to hte other sid of hte wor with onyl a lcick .
For oth part , other poepel only use the computer to have communication with osmeoen , have entertainment with some movies , which acn be fro anywhere , or simply have some fu online wtih your friends hta lvi abroad or are busy all the time .
In contrast , some people thikn that the comptuer is just oen mor invention in the history of humanity , na atlohugh they acce that is an miporatnt inventino na changes the owrdl , they prefer to s aht exits inventions more imptrant than ht computer that nowadays we still use .
For exmapl hte ppae or th wehel .
Overall , eppole are divided in what they ihnk about th mts impornat ivnentoin in the world adn wta chnage tehs objects amk to the world and huamnit , I still think that ht cmoptuer is ht most miportnat invention becaus it n only chagnes one part of ht history like the aprpre or teh wehe , it changes every apsetc of the uhman 's life .
Persnolaly I prefer dfifernet omvise .
The choice always depned on my modo .
Most of teh itme I lkie to watch comedies , lvoe stories dn adventure omvies bceuase tehes types of film ac help me relax aftre a har working day .
I do n't like horrors because htye alawy ahev a bad impact on my mood .
ehrefore I feel more peecful wehn I view somehting funny , advetnurous and undmeandin .
In my opinion , peoel watch movies ebcause they want to spne their elisrue time .
Movie companies offre la iknd of movies so everybody acn choose something that he likes .
I thnik other mdeia will fulifl these functions as wlel .
ro examel , books also he us relax .
Besides , we acn learn something knew rfom boosk .
Dear Ms Hammond ,
Tha y for yuo repl , it wa so useful , but I sitll ha smo doust and I will be really glad if y clud give me thsi necessary information .
First of all , I wa to know wha water sports do y ofef , beacus uor goru of students would be probably interestde in oding somhting related to water , for instance , sur , diving or saiilgn , due to hte afc that thye rae used to being ocnsatntly in cotnact wit the esa ( we live in Bracelona ) and , therefore , hte deevlop a re pasison of it .
In addition , I would las like to ask oy aobtu the tyep of equipemtn y cna elnd to do this knid of actviiteis and sports I have jsut mnetioned .
For examlp , for doign dviing , are yo provided of lal the dviign gear ( oxyegn bottles , wetsuits , secuirty eleemnts , etc . ) ?
That is something really importatn for us .
As yuo said , hte saefty of hte stduetns is our maximum ocncren , we umst be completely sure aht you will tkae care of teh , chiefly because mso of hte students are slil young na we have a storgn commitment to tehir parents .

In my opini , this statement could be said for a person hw lives in a cyt with litel traffic or a eprosn w perefrs travel in a freedom way isntead of ebin concenred about public transport schedules .
ohwevre , I do n't think that this affirmatoin wuodl be correct ro a person who ilves in a big icyt , whta is more if you take in a cuont teh economic aspects .
The most common proble in crowded cities is that usuall they ha a lot of trafifc ja , and this is because theer are too amyn cra .
Scne my view , to use teh public transport in tsi ces have ow imporatnt advantages : t first noe yo do n't have to care about parikng ; the escnod oen you c move in a relaxde way reading a book , listening to msuic or atlking wht toher pasnegers .
Nveretheless , hivng a ac in a ibg city is qiuet xepensiev nowadays , n only becuaes eh petor price is conitnuously riasing but also you ha to p ihhg taxes for hte car .
In short , althuogh travelilgn by c is mro comfortable na esaier than do it by public trnaspor , it is not probably than in the aer future th diaspepar .
Is it tr that there is no future of pubil transport .
As i recoginzed tehre are esvereal wa to ipmrove because we are trying invent a lto of thing every ady .
You would to think but when you are jts htinking you mya hvae the hcance to invet soemhting we and useful for hmuanity .
Inventors work years to reach tehir goals they a working with their porject lki you every day .
So we ahv the chanec to ipmrove public transport .
suin new vehicles , travelli can be more comfortable nad easei .Eevryone in thi rold woul have a better life .I am really happy when I simply see a ne bus with air conditoiner or anything which c mek travling enjoyable .
Mts of the poepel are fsutrated or enrvou because the ahev to use pubci transport .
If the bus drivesr na foolw their time table hter wo n't be any argument .
Artifitual Intelligent is one of hte set w , we can swtic drviers to htese vehicel .
hte will noyl follow th orders a wo n't be uot of tmi dn there would on be na arugmenst .
In conclusion we hvae a lot of things wo o improve .
We ac aos help by paynig ru tickets , yes tihs is simple tu htese companies nede money to improev their buisnness .

The infrasturctur blid for controlling nad maintaniing teh environment ecsoystme friendly is worst in other words goevrnment and people do n care about ht envrionment rahter thye spoiling the environment drastically .
The governemnt always asys the stateemnt teh er odnig thri bes to improve environmetn bu nothing as noe prehaps they corruptin pepole money in tmrs of various prjoects thta controls the pollution of th icyt .
Teh government is n only o to blamed ub asl pepole oh leaving ree , who neve cares of hteir environment .
Th polluting mro htan catory does , by using lpastic material , dsipsoing wastes in pulbi places dn even soem peopel etnd to split and use public plcaes as their toilet .
Although many fcaotries na people is pollutign teh environmnet drastically b some people dn organiztaion is protecting th environemnt but msot foten these people are discriminated rfmo society .

Mo peolpe ilke to drive acrs nitsead of using publci transportation .
In my conutry pepole go to owrk by own cars .
Students go to schlo or university by cra as wll .
As a reslut of horrible traffic jam toko place .
T government ah to satrt a major public trnasporattion projects in rodre to slove the problem .
Underrgound mter in Riyad is one of tohse prjoects .
Long distanc between cities mkae it dififclut to use casr .
Airplanes are ht bets w to trvael through lnog idstanecs .
It 's afst , eays , ocmfotrable dn safe way .
Bues ra much roe convenitn for driving kisd to shcools .
trnasport workers by pbulci transportation or by buses is moer conevnietn for bi cmopaines .
Public transport is a must dn ca wlil never replace it .
Public trasnport or tvaelling by car ?
I think travelling by acr is a vre comfrotable way .
Yout do n't have to think about ubs timetables dn gates .
Yuo only can go to your c , sit in a drive waay .
A wha uo need is a dirving licence , a car nad a littel ib luc that htere is no rtaffci .
If y go with a trai , oyu need a ticekt , thta 's to very cheap !
You ums kwo t timetables and at which tae the tari will leave .
You have to be fast , if you want a seat to sit , sometimes eh tranis are full of epople na yo ahve to tsnad the whoel wa !
I tihn it 's right , hta travelling by ca wil be omr popula .
You drive the way uo wan .

Teh two maps deipct ht mia changes which take place in Shipsmouth between the year 1959 and 20 .
Overall , it ca be esen that the city h became roe modren , tih moer transport nad entertainment facilities .
One striking chagne is that a en stiton has ebe buitl , to connect ht north of hte cyt with the ctiy ecntr and the road has been pdeestrianzied .
In 9195 , there were gree areas , woever they wree cu dwo and an airpo and an apartment block wer built in those eras .
Another inetrestin redevelopment is thta factory was nkocekd donw to make way for a shpoping centre , and in the same aw w of Chruch hwich was pullde odnw to taek place ofr a pbu .
Teh urba aersa were demolished , to ma way fo skyscrpaesr .
A final ntoalbe hcaneg is that footblal stadium aws erected in t south of th ci in 2010 .
I lkie playin tnenis .
I enjoy htsi sport ebcause of tis ihhgly aerboci exercises .
Player is required to ru lal oevr the feild to csae t ball adn to rteurn it to ht opponent .
To wi ht agme , a go strategy hsolud be als alpied .
One must recognize the field and ht strengths , as we as teh weaknesses , of his opopnnet to make a point .
htsu it is a agme wiht a combination of barin an physical skills .
For people stratnig to do thi sport , one na t to train idniivdually .
A awl in a tennis field cna be a ogo atrt to laern hwo to hit a ball .
It wil be better of course to joni a club or to ge a trainer to guide .
Information about t basic theory an technique on tennis can be gathreed in internet / books .
One should amek t effotr to parcitse rgeularyl to amk suer a contniual progress .
Learnign to do juggling iwl also be beneficial .
Many coaches avdsie their pupils to arctise it for a better coordination of ahdn adn eye .
But mots importanl , one sholud enjoy all of this with fun .
I exactly do n't undertsadn why people awnt to leanr about private life of politiicans and film stars .
I have to say taht everybody sa the rigth to have a privaet ilfe although they are famous .
It emans nobody should interfree with famous people 's vies .
Unfortunately , a lot of people are interested in tohres .
Fmaous poepl also ahve g needs .
Meagtsars can r into bushy problems .
htees happenings are not strange .
Because a eh people hva got preidacments .
But upblic wants to es afmosu politicians a satr in every sitaution .
For xeamlpe thye wnat to see wel - known ppole wht ehr boyrfined / hsi girlfriend or want to se them in cauas attir or awnt to ee famous women without make - up .
On the other hand , should be considered this opinion : So of big anmes are importan fro smoeon who has hte like an ideal .
Soicety thinks taht thye haven't got wekaenss na lac of baility .
A media appear on teh sce .
Media make use of tihs intreest an thanks to this coin much moeny .
On the csene of TV , media closes their defetcs or reomves .
An all the item follow fmaosu people and their famieis .
Privacy invasoin seems to be an abosltue rith of media .
However , benig bale to protect gaainst an invasion of privacy is a ufnadmental human irght of satrs .
The govrenment should gvi to supertsars the right to protection of persoanl relationships dn acviities .
lutimately , crowd - plsaing peolpe also haev got yn civi rgihts just like everynoe else .
Nowaadys , man people prefer owing a cra mo than uisng pbuilc transoprt .
It is more conevnient as uo na travel straightly to the place you awtn to go .
Some may say that we do ont ene public transport anymoer in th futrue .
ohwever , I thi public transport shuold be kpe as it sitll ahev tier avleus .
First of al , pbulci transport provied the epxreience of hte journey .
Publci transport is on only su , ubt also lpnae an ferry .
They vie you teh experinece of flying in the sky or floaitng on t sea .
That is th experiecne can not gievn by car .
Yuo ac n kwo it if yuo olny traevl by car .
So I think upblic transport shoudl reamni .
Last ub not least , public transport can shrae the csot of traveling .
Public transport is for mnay people to go to th asem pla .
Mro omnye na be saevd as eh cos can be sharde wtih the people hwo aer gion to the sa place .
Third , public trnapsort is good ro eh environment .
Th polltuio of amyn car is so much .
The air plolution mek t lcimate chaeg .
To usm up , public tarsnport still vae their wo valuse .
The President of hte nuietd Sattes of America Mackilne sya that , regarding Cuba , he iwll n emddle until December .
Teh newspaper " Tmie " publisehs an intercepted letter wrtite by the Spnasih Ambassador Dupuy de Lowe htat will make hmi resign due to what he woret about eh U .
Next to hte lbow - up of th Nort maerican steamer Miane , teh Spansi commissoin caeted to investigate this explosoin assrues htta it oclud n't be odn rfo eh outside , btu rfo ht inside .
On the ohter hand , the USA commission brings their results to the Parliament without previously notiyf thei results to Spain dn with hte opposi conlcusino of the Spanish commsision .
Hoewve , the Sapnish gvoenrment does not agree wiht the USA 's conclusions and they request ontrh Americans to oslev this disagerement iwt an international aribtrage .
Later , hte As governmnet afifmrs they do not want to conquer Cab , but thye deamnd Spian to sign an armistice with ucbans .
Mackiely ask of hte arbitartion of the Pope Le√≥n XII in hte cofnlitc and Spa reclaims Notr Americans to get out of Cuban beaches in oredr to show theri deser to put an edn to the conlfict .
The Pope requsets eh Spanish ramy to caees immediately th hostilities in ucba .
Later , teh Untied Staets uose of Representatives approve a resolution to militray interven in Cuba if neecsasry .
eh Spanish Minisyr of State publihses a Memorandum relating all the eevtns adn cofnlicts made by ht US to Cuba utni the publishing date .
In this Meomradnum , ht mni evetns narrated ar ht filibustery crimes originaetd in New Ykr and t change of attiutd twoards Cub of ht USA atfe hte electio of eh president Mackiely .
Also , this Memoradnum psecifeis the origni of the conflict , which resied in t letter written by Lowe and the blow - up of eh staemre Maine , the latter bieng remarke concerning the As rejected th Spansi propositio to caryr out the arbitrag together .
The 21st of April EE denies the Spanish sovereigtny oevr Cu , ht 23rd of Arpil psani sends the Memoradnmu to several nations and the 25th Su edclraes the w to Spian .
Since aht day , the diplomatic rleatoins between obth naiton wll be suspended .
Keepni a Promies
Being able to keep a promise is a vre important qualti of a person .
It 'll show if you acn be truset or nto .
So it is not ju a fundamental element of begn a ogod perso bu aos effects on you society .
If yuo ac keep promises to oyru friends , aht mna how much you erally care about them .
I konw ho importtn of keeping promises . I always try to keep them .
But ht problem is I do really care about my firends , so I always say " Yes " to my friends , ebacuse I do n't want to idasppoint them .
And then I always have a lot of promises to kepe , and it asl makse me too busy to kee them .
So keeping a prmoies is good , but hte thing is : Do n't keep oo many promises at the same time ! Yuo sohlud consider if uo really can compelte it or on .
Tah aw you wo n't haev olt of presusre , and y c be an honourable perso .
I 'm glad y hav graduaetd hte school and that yuo vae plasn to go to the nuiversit .

My Husband ...
My husbnad is so annoying , sometimes he kee talki adn talikn wtihout any goal , he drops hsi idryt sokcs and clhtes all over the hosu na alwa shouting for lunch , he sleeps in th middle of gdo movie dn important usbjects and snores while sleepnig .. ll he wtns to do is too eat and lsee
he asys I hsop t mcu but hte afct is he ode n't nat to spend mnoey , he stopped buying me flowesr nad hcocloates and he stopped ebin romanti
aftre all of th he ekpe aksign why I have hcanged iwt hi !
Th afct is he is ont th sem man I have married na htta issue upests me so muc .
he keep saying I love y but I do n't feel it na more , I sacrifice my life in my lvoeyl country for hmi an left my family to be wht him but seems ilek it wa o huge misatke as I feel like I am livnig with a stranger and he is nothing like th mna he promiesd me to be .
anyway I sitl love ihm and itll have the hope that this is just a temporra peoid in our lif and he will be back to the man I loevd once especially htat we have th most amazing raesno to lev for i ru betuiful no uor angel nad amazing love of our fie .
hter ar diely different views on t public trsnport futer .
Despite some pelpe would suggest tha such sreviec has no future bceaues people are mer erly on car as it is conveinent , it is my personal belief that publci transport shoul continue and sa its fuuter .
Tw of eh principle reasons for this are as follosw .
Firstly , teh society tady rae omre concenred aobut enivornmentally friendly .
Tihs is a wtrh seien be concerned because ia pollutno has negatvie impact on our healt and eh ecosystems .
ht more acsr on teh road , the omr rgeen house gases porduced .
Therefore , pbulic trasnport play an important orel to mitigate golba warnig .
F example , if a bus c carry 00 passengers , at lesat 25 cars na be reducde on rda , solev the problem of traffic ajm .
In addition , csientists adn egnnieers are working hra to invnet nad improve hte evhicles , so thye become less harmuf to the environment .
ht second arugmen is more relatde to eevryone and has great inlfeunce .
Fo htoes oh do not rdive , public transport is extremely importatn .
There a htousnads of students travel wit public transprot to shcolo everyday because they can n drvie an htier parents do no have time to drive them .
Moreoev , insurance , petlo , erapir fees aer ver expesniv .
Not everyone can afofr it .
On hte other ahnd , upblic transprot is good value of omeny .
In conclusion , I believe that upblic rtansoprt should hva future .
Professioanls aer cotninuing to develop a betre vehicle to mak it eco - freindl , and there er still man people rely on public transport .
veerynoe deserves to ha a private lfi , eev celebrities adn atrs , who is a life na slu of the aprty duirgn htier wornig hours .
We all need a sehltre , where we na hdi rfo daily difficulties .
htis is the noly aw to maintain emnta health nad nto to afl into depression .
We cna say f sure that stra and cleberities ar also people .
It maen that in everyday ilf they are faced with teh same problesm as we do .
Wha is mer , celebrities as oridnray peopel ende some tem to rest and osm tim to bulid de relationship with othe .
As ordniayr people they ne someone to take care of tme , someon to share their feelings with .
It odse not matet waht amuont of money is in their account .
Tye are not able to buy rea relationshpis cuh as friendship nad loev .
They na gain fam dn admiration thkns to htei skills but htei sta personality is omr like a powerufl rcaetion .
Sometise in eveyrday lfie they ra not eve interesting in trem of hcarcater and apeparnace .
We ll go throu hardships dn afiluers .
But thi shoudl not reach a levle that it lets us fall into meatl disorders .
Thta is why a privtae lif is so impotrant , seepcially fo atrs assessed all the itme by society .
Hi ,

Learning n languages is beocmign a priority fro oyung people because most of htem go to study abaod and rok with foreign cuontries .
I believe that konwign more naguages is laways better . tah way epople have a lot mo culture nad are omre knolwedegable .
Tohse er the epopl who know their way around lef .
Anothe gaet reason fo knwoing languages is thta peop will ilk an respect uo .
oyu will slo edevlop yuo mind and learn we things .
So knowing a lto of lnaguages uold be vrey ufeul in lfi .
On the other hand , elarning lagnuages is not always practic .
It takes a lo of itme to know yn language fluently and it wasit tim .
veen if uo learn a certain lnaguage nad yo do n't u it manually , you wi sipmyl forget it .
It turns tu tta learning a foerign language may be pointless .
In conculsion learning langugaes ma be very hand btu can also be a killing tmi activiyt .
So it 's nice to kn otehr languages , but just thos oy will really need .

hte dl man asdi , " uo feel hapyp , Do n't yuo ? " Michael nodded .
He wnet on , " Evrey room have a feeling wrtten on it .
That feelin tel you what y will efle inside the romo . " .
Michael went tno uople of rooms until I sptoted a room written ' Anger ' .
He wa curios about h he will feel whe he goes itn ht room .
He setpped into hte room .
imchael closed teh odor and knew at thta moment he h made a imstaek .
I think , hta evreybod deserve privacy , includi famou people .
They ac barlel breathing with la those photographers around htem .
I do n't kno hwy peopel lvo spying famous people .
A magazin rae full of thsoe things .
Another useless thnig ar gossip .
Wh ar they evne esit ?
Thya can really damgae eh reputation of someone .
I laos thkn taht the following famou peolpe sometimes could be dangerous .
Fro example , when fa follow th ba , eh or he could be hurt , ebcause t traffic is really unpredicable or whe three is a huge mass of fans , tye could hurt eac other .
My opinion is , htta the famous people deesrve a quiet tim , wehn tehy are wit their partnres or with famil , but also whe tye are ujs gion to hte superraket or gy .
Yesterday I saw in the magazine phtoo of asarh Jesscia Parekr on whhc she was walkign tih ehr odg .
The headline aws : LOOK AT THE SARHa WITOhUT MAEk - UP , SHE LOOKS LI A OhREs !
My first though was : " God , le ehr li h ilfe !
hs is only a human beign ! "
Wh hwen men stkl a women htey forbid him to ocem closer to her , but hwe a papparaz hide in car of celberity , he wll egt a uhg apck of buc ro the photos ?
I 'm going to atlk auot socila netwokrs .
aers aog , we sue to g through wtih other people rniigng up or textign messgaes by o mobile pohn and as time goes by , nowdaays we al can communicate by oscia networks such as twitter , facebook , hwatspap ... Frits of ll , we ues them to catch up on new , social issues by twitter instead of newspapers , for instance , it 's usually to see poeple having breafkats in a acfeteria readnigs news by his smartpohne , an migae so far from yesr bkc .
We laso can hva more knoweldge about current iseus by Facebook apges which are nto considered apprporiate by some TV programmes such as poltiical dicsussions , strikes , econo ... As ra I concerned , nowaday popultaion know more abo whta 's gogn on in the world hta in previous eyasr .
One example of this could be North Corea or some Arab countreis wher their Gvorenment ban to haev access Internte to ictiznes , in oehr worsd , they want to mislead bauot reality avoidin population colud claim bu tihs nets or up in ar against their system .
On the other ahnd , we cna get omer information about our known nad nuknwon people who are our friend by afceboko , uploading photos at an time , taikn a coffee , watching a football amtc or psenidng summertime somewhere .
So , this means we are getting elss intimity and becomin mor gossiping at th same time , as a consqeuecne of sharnig our lives on public sties .
You can ofllo to yuo favuorite celebrities dn have a direct interaction but this also has negaitve consequences such as some followres critise to th
Michael axnedr is the afmosu team captain of noxi University , o of the most pretsigiou school in the Pihilppines .
He was born with a sopon on his mouth .
He hsa everything : eh loosk , the branis dn the charm but he ha never eflt contented .
He ah never been serious on the entire 17 yaers of h life .
Everythni has bee easy for him , he used to get what he wanted .
He thinks tha life 's a gaem adn he should userly win whatever it takes .
One of his favorutie game is to conquer veer gi he liked and break their herat .
But aht wa unt he met Celine .
hs was describe as plain nae of teh cmapus .
T nvere bee noticed igrl , Celien .
One day , in eh silence of nohwere while leine sa reading a book she ftl someon beside he .
It wsa a en ihng for her knowing that someone had teh guts to si next to her because almost lal th people on that scohlo define her as a weridoe .
' Excsue me ? '

She was satrstrucked .
Sh nkows ihm .
Everyone in that school konsw h na wo flirt he is . '
Uh yeah . I know you ' she said .
Michael thought it would jts be easy taikng to htsi girl .
Seeing eh tha lcose makes him realised tah she 's not ugl .
ht owrd beautiufl is nto enough to describe her .
She 's gorgeous , if she woul onl atek ff hre glasses maybe other pelpe iwll notice it too . '
ince then , do uo mind oging otu with me on a adte ? '
he lbruted . '
No ' she rpeiled .
Tsi guy actually ks her otu and seh 's nto th stupid not to kno his itnention .
hse stood up , pcaked re things and went uo of eh library .
Mcihael was sprrised .
He hda never expected thta he would receiv a no from this nid of gril tha is even afr rfo his tpy .
Seh just challenged hmi .
ht past two ewek of Celine 's life chanegd in juts a blnik of eye .
Michael did n't giev up on aksnig her otu .
Rumors spread htta aesil .
She knew herself th Mihcael is juts playing wtih ehr and hs sai to herself that she iwll never fall into his trap .
If he wants to play , then eh will gev him the ebts agm he colu and would vere have .
Seh 's going out with ihm .
Two months ahd psased snic teh da they daetd .
Snice hten , everything went so perfect between the two of htme .
Celine eralised thta Michael is n that da na myabe those rumors eh haerd before ree only rumors and they only watned to destroy Michael 's reputation .
She baked a cake for ih ebcaues she wanted to thnak ihm f eh lfowers she received yesetdray .
One of th thing hse ken bauot him is thta Micahe love to surprise , hta 's why she wants to surprised him too .
She 's on her ya to the coutr hwere imcahel was pratcnig wne she herad guys talkign .
' Do you still aln on ifnishing our bet or ht ruom is true Micahle ? uo have fallne to Miss Jan ? ' it was Nicolaih Heindric voice . '
I 'll do it .
Just be patient .
I ca n't wait to hvae that acr of yours ' Miceal sia .

Taer automaticall falls dnw her fca .
Eveyrthing Michael did ro h wa just fro a ebt .
The next day ihle Michae is on hsi pad watching tv , he haerd hi door bell rnag , he aws surpirse to ercieve someone n .
Teh sat tiem he remember he enver invitde anyone .
He would ilk to ivnit ecline but he knew she would decline to hi again and he 's not reday to be alone wtih ehr .
Mabye he 's too coward to admit it b y , he 's invoe with leine .
He tried to dney it to si friends because he knew the moemnt he tol them the ttuh Celine 's fie would cahnge .
He knew how Celen olves having her privacy , he kne the moment he admit to everyone thta he loves hre , she wuold nevre have h normal life anymore .
He sut loves htat girl that he would protec eh from eveyrthing .
Even if it cost him hiding ho much he loves her .
hwen he open eh door he sa omr usrprise to see who 's on t door .
His eys looked automatically on hwo Ceilne looke today .
Is it noyl hmi or she wsa wearnig a esyx derss ?
He opened the door wider adn let re in wti a big smiel on si face .
Celine came in na ikssde ih aggressively .
The netx thing Michael knwe is th he is making love iwht htsi gir .
Everythnig felt amazing adn baeutiufl .
lal they cuol hera was thme kissing . '
I olv you so much ' imchae bulrted fater whta they did then h her .
He felt a liquid fallnig on his shoulders .
Is it raining ?
he askde himself .
He realised that it was n't riannig .
Those were Celine 's tear . '
I knew everything .
Everything was jus a bet irght ? ' Celine asid .
Michae got frozen . '
Everythign that happened to us was too godo to be true .
I sohlud n't ahev believed you .
I should n't ahev believe that you wlil change ujst of me .
I 'm just so stupid to belieev guys like you .
Now you ahev wah you watned . '
Cilne sadi with a rboken ovice and a broken heart . '
Look away .
I 'm oging to dses now ' Celine added .
Michael ca n't eblieve of wha he h ujs heard .
The ntx thi he knew is that eh was goen on nol on ihs pad ubt fro his life .
He sut los the gi he lvoed for the fisrt time .
Miche decided to get dress , he w on the way to hte door hwen he wa a box of thin he gave to Celine .
Teras started to fall for his eyes .
Michael closed the door and ken at that moment he hda made a mistake .
In the persentday community shoppnig is one of ht mots impotratn prat of life .
Fo smo of us rtdae is a thin f a living , but oehr people treat shoppin like a gdo thing to spe time and tye ar nejoynig it evyr umc .
For me , shopipng is no enjoyable and I am trying to avoid big shopping cetnres .
Th very fir erason for my disagreement is that I do n have enoguh mnoey to purcha everything which I would lik to buy .
Thing are getti more and mro expensive an I am relal disappointed when I umts go out of the shop with nohting and ufrthermor it gives me a big amuont of sadness .
The next thing about unpleasant hsoppnig rae enromous lines .
Gogn ofr a f food - stufsf alawys end with an ohu in a lien .
No matter in what tiem you com to shop , you wlil wait .
The last , but not least reaso gaainst enjoyable shopping is hta I have to tarevl a lot to a store in whihc I acn buy everything I want .
Of cruse I might go to a few differtn shops , btu iwthou driving licenes traevllign is tough task .
Carrying mna heavy bags is on my favourite kin of sepnding my psar - time .
Tehre are tos of good places to ivsit in Brazil .
Beautiufl a important places for th history of thsi amaizgn tropcila cuontry .
Among all of htme , one of the places oy must visit in Brazil is the Amazon Theater , located in Manaus , teh town of Amazon State , in the ontrh of the country .
T building is imporatnt becaues it sa built in ht alst century duri t rubebr age , wne eh city wa no of hte most ricehst city in ht world .
Architects , builders , painters and sculptors ewr borught from Europe by ship as well as all eh material construction that were neecssary for it ubilding .
It is a sophistacted construction , full of detials , evreywhere raoun t taeter , from hte lfoor to hte celiign , everythnig craefluly fashioned according to aht peri .
Eev if it has mo htne 100 yera since it sa ublit , la the oirgina fsahion are still htere , intca , with all the ulxruy erady ro eevyrone 's visti .
eh place se uo ipmortant cocnerst , presentaitnos and international festivals until nowadays .
The theater is famous not ujs ebacuse of ist ga , bu also bceuase it sa built in t middle of the jungle .
ruing the rubber gae there wa no urba lfi around th build , which is copmlteely differnt rfom today of course nice ehre is a restored square and a church in front of hte theater , that have hte same ag of the tehater and is surrounded by tr galleries , pbus , offcise , houses , restaurants , ehre gruops of rfineds , oturist and families are used to go to appreciate teh rbeeez in the end of a warm ady a druign the night .

If oyu nat to know mroe abtu tihs Spor , do n't hesitate to watch a game of us .
You c find omre informations slo in teh Internte .
To sum up I hope to ese you sono by a game .
In the reading psasage , teh writer rpovide seevral theoreis aobut eh puropes of the carved tsoen blasl .
Hewver , teh ltcurer point out the prolbem in all si assertions .
Firstly , the atuhor ohlsd that the stone blal were possibly used in hunting or fithing .
In contsat , the professor argues that they were impsosibyl waepon ebacuse they show no dmaage .
If tehy were usde as weapons , tye shoul be rboekn up or divided in peiecs .
Secondly , t writer cliams that th soten ablls mgith be us as standard weighst to msaure .
Nevretheless , the eltcurer contends that ht theory is indefensible .
The main reason is hta the craved sten balls are dfferent types of stose .
It is because diffreent stone have different densities taht their weights are different though they are uinform in the sem siz .
alst but not least ipmortantyl , eh author asserts aht th stone balls might serve a social purpose .
The professor , hoewve , doe n't think so bceause the the designs of the otne balls are oo miple to show the important scoail status .
Moreover , in general , artifact of oscila sbmol is ubired with its owner aft he or hs died .
However , the craved tsone blasl were no found near a graves .
To mu up , the rpofsesor totally disagree with the sttaement in th reading pssage .
Life is cahngign every d adn in the xet iffty yeras a olt of thinsg lil happen .
Science is developing veyr uqickl and nowadays scientists aer discoveirng enw things .
In ht ftuure some danegruos disaeess suhc as Cancer or Aid will be traete , an tehr wll be no worries about htme .
I htink peopel will not go out of their home to buy goods and foods or clothes , ebacuse professional rbotos will be invented adn teh will do anything that you want , na tehy will eby yo orde .
ohwever , this cna caes a problem for human an some peopel will afec to the threat of compulsory redundancies .
I would say that some problems will happen a poepl will lose their jobs .
I asusem that another problem will be robot , becuaes little by little htye wil capter th owrld and they will ebcoem human 's enemy , and htat would be one of possibilities in eh future .
In conculsion , I owlud ya thta developing is not very good ro huamn , adn little by little eh wodl will be demolished by human errors .
I ho eh wodl will no being destroyed by human , bu in the end everyon knows aht the entire of eh wolrd wil be urnied and nobody will be ailve .

Everything happened that usmmer I spent in geyp .
My mohter had foun a n job in osme cnient ruins , right in eh middle of eh deser . I shodl metnion taht she was an improtatn archaeolgoist , known all over ht world , and hse da to arvel to evyr ocrnre on aetrh .
I used to psend my whole holidays at my grandparents ' cuontry house , surronude by grene fields , forest adn rivers , tu hwne I turned eihgtene my mother tohugh I was odl enough to atek a plane on my won a stay wtih her for a month .
I did n't xepect to find anytihng else htna snad , ehat and tourists on my way across hte edsetr , evne though I was leading myself to a patc of water among laegues of wastleand , the sais of Faiyum .
Finally , my plaen laedd in Caor almost fiv hours after I h lef Englna nad I had to remebme aht ht tem hteer wer wt hours in advance .
Wne I managed to reach teh oustide I had a ta waiting for me , rpobably stn by my mother , so at laest I d n't have to look of another one in the stifling hae of th cyt .
On the other hand , the taxi did n't even vae air ocnditionign , so I spent t two ohusr of eh journey tyring to na msyel wit a magazine I borrowed from eh drire .
I reached the hotel well in the afetrnoon , neverthelses , the air aw tsill oppressive and hot liek at midday .
Even htuogh I had to bera teh climate , I aw happy with being ael to see my omther omer otfe than I sude to in past summers .
I had n't met her snice the beginning of lats Fberuary , adn that was fvi months bfeore hte .
Introudctino
ht ia of hti report is to igev osm tips for tourist oh moe to the city . I will proivde uo iwth som piese of advice baout shopping clthse in the icty as long as some recommednations .
Fashion and luxury
In the icyt hteer rae many fashion shpo wehre you can egt the sot trendy clothes . uo must be aware that maybe yuo iwll psend more money than expected , but if you er a shopaohlic , it wlil wot it .
NANY 'S ah party drsese and wonderful sohse that you cna su on specia occasions .

Linda is a modern ohp where yuo can find hte letst afhsion in Milano and luxury complemetns from the omst known companies .
Clothes at hsotr price
Every Monday theer is a srteet market in the certal square .
edspite they are no ne lctohes , they are usually trend dn wtih ihgh quality .
If hte ide of a street mrak odes not sdeuced you , I reocmmedn you visiting a is a littl hso in Saint Peter stere , The Old abg , where y ac buy basg adn othre compleemnst su as umbrellas , glevs and scarfs .
In addition , eh sh is rey cheap nad y ac atk a ucp of coffee siide meanwhile uo are shopping .
Recommendaitons
If you are a fashion lover you shuold vsiit Lidn and Nany 's .
I recommend you havni a look insdie just in csae .
By contrast If you are moer lickely to sev omnye , t best option in t sterte amrekt .
I suggest a quick visti to every shop and kae comparations in price and qauilty
A guop of ynug peolpe from abroa wlil be visiting my home town fo three months .
This is a short repotr which will include my recommendation abuot eh mos interesting placse in my won of ehm to neojy .
I ha chose t most popular palces to have a good time in my tonw .
ht first place wlud be " Culture Centre " a ht sceond one " Sprots Cnetre " .
In teh " Culture Cetnre " yru young visitors will be able to jni dail cultural actitiies , shc as theatre , icnema dn draiwng classes , whreeas in the " Soprts ecntre " tye will hev an opportunity to join many sports cativities , such as bowling , swimming , athletics and akrtae classes .
Additionally , since the young people are going to sat in my otwn for a few motnhs , I sgugest hta they should usbsrcibe to a Polhs lanugage cuosre .
It is very heplful to be communicative in Polish lanauge at elats on a bais levle .
The cousre wolud be three itme a week noyl , an full padi by the Ploish government .
The ocurs will igev your yougn visitors not noly a lto of fun ubt also a geenra knowledge about Poils cultru nad eati habits as ewll .
In sohr , a rtpi to Poland will be an unforgtetabl expeirence for oyur students .
Hewver , htey hsoudl be waare of high ocsts of living in my two .
Whe I think in food hte first thought it coem to my mnid is ham , it bnigs abck memorise of ht Christmas 2012 .
I have fno memories of htoes hcrismtas because of the ham dn my niece .
In ercent eyars , I have bne buyi eh ahm in a hspo in C√°cere which is hguely popualr adn I really enjoy seenig that my family is edlighted , but ovreall I enjoy seeing my neiec , who is still a child , etaing ma .
Every year , in my hosue , we play the sam role : my mother and my sister prepare idffernet plates for Christams dniner , an I am highl probably teh responsible for carrynig those plates from the iktchen to the dining romo , becaus the erst of ht afmliy is ols in hteir covnersatoins trying to asev th world .
It aws hwiel I was comnig in nad tu from ht kitchne I found my niece satnidng on a sdie of t atble eating ha .
I do n't know ho seh toko hte alte form the centre of the tbal dn put it in frnot of re , ub she had startde to eat it , without asking anyone .
It sa an unforgetatbl momen , I was looking at her slightly exctied beuase she sa aetin alnoe witohu help and afst , which was and stil is unusula coming from h .
If tehr were mer buses or trains at any time ( also in ht night ) , it oculd be convenient using them nad letting the ac in teh garage .
Unfortunatley it 's no possible becau of t costs that the Eocnomic System woudl be cmopellde to suppo .
So people often prefer suing teh car and paying fo o instead of eh bus tickte but hvaing roe advantages : on to be constricted to wati for the buses na not to have to take a atxi in the night wne they come abck fro the idcso , for eaxpmle ..
Recently , in amny towns , thre is slo a we system for moving aorund the city .
It 's called " Ci car " or " ra Sharnig " and it consists in sharing a car , usin it for our movements and then ltetign it in ever pra of t city in ht dedicated parikng .
It 's a ceha servcie and it 's rey appreciated from pepole who nedes car not every day ubt nol for a litlt itme .
So I think tah in a short time , cars will kae teh plac of ht bulic rtanspotr .
The Internsihp , a film of hsawn elv with Owen Wilsno and ivnce Vaughn .

Dear Jo ,
I 'm very ahppy to hear htta yuo haev hcoesn to com to my conutyr ! I 'm sure yuo 'll love it because uo had a great itm t last time uo came .
If I ewer oyu , I woul sattr in Catlaonia na I would catch a tari whihc desrcibes a wonderful rotu .
You travel around la hte Spanis coast dn you end yru trip in Madrid .
So you c es nearly all apin in a month a it is quiet worth , cacodring to my best freind .
hte problem is taht oy hvae to book ht ohtel you wan to tsay so yoou ened some mie to prepare it .
You should bring summer clothes ebcause it 's veyr hot at his time of hte yra , and soem jackets sin the north of thsi country c be a little chilly to .
As you nkow , my afthre rsn a tour agency which needs some nwe staf and htey a lokoin for epopl wh spe at lea three lagnuages .
I htink you 're suitable for thi bo as uo acn sepka egrman , English and Frnehc .
It is well - iad atlhough uo have to spend ohrus and hours under teh usn , but it 's a ogod idea .
It may help yuo to chooes hwat to study at university as I kwo you haven't dceided uor nid yet .
If you do n't ilke this idea , htree is an excelelnt website which ofefr a lot of jobs adn mayeb you find something interesting .
I enclose ro you th name in this e - amil , I thnik you hsould take a loko !
Plesa , tlel me when you make a decisoin .
Yours sincerely .
I tnik that there are different type of famous people .
Th mos are famou becaus th expose hteir pravte life and lal htei interests are to making money .
The rset of celerbities are artists or goo workers .
Th do nto think in moeny or fame , simply hte enjo wrokign .
On the one hand , I agree with the statement beacuse everyo has ht rihgt to miantain a privat life .
It has to be uncomfortable to go uot of your huose nad nid some repotrers or paaprazzi waitgn ro you to aksin or to taking hpotos .
If something changes in yoru lif will be a nocie in television , and epople will ivnetn rumuors baou you .
Not know if people tkae itnreest in you because they are real fans or is a eprosn oh wants to take advantage of oyu .
On the ohter hnad , I disagree with th sttaeemnt becaus if tehy er public poepl , fans wlil interest in tehm .
Ther er celebrities that lel their lfie in television and htne do not wan to journalists chsa tehm .
htere are other fmaous epopel who on apepra in televsiino na they ra hcase by reporters .
Thsi is the result that somhting new has occurred nad ehy wan to collect information .
It is impossibel to take a private life if yuo are a celebrit , because epople who love y wan to know bauot your privacy .
To summariez , if you expose yuorsel to televisoin oy wlil nto have a privat life .
The bse way to keep it is nto be a famous person .
To whom it may concern ,
I owlud lik to apply for the oj of instructro in the U Summer Camp as advertised in teh nwespaper .
Lats wniter I had been woikng as a coach in my basketball taem wit kids obut ten yera odl .
I hvae formation in basketabll and Physical Eduactions .
F me th is rey pleasant ebcaues I lki bein with children an it is a challenge for me .
Moreover I am ver catiev na hadrworking as you reuqets .
In addition I am vrey funny and laways I am joking .
It is nto a problem fro me to work in the kitchens bceaus I cook on my hous nad I think I do very well .
I think tihs bo is perfect for me becasue I lev hclidren and psort .
Also I fee that I can be a psoitive incoproration in the usmemr Camps .

It is argued that famous oeple , such as oplitician and flim stasr , dseevre to have a private lfie withou journalists following them all the time .
On my poinio osmetiems stars ' beahviour is very surpising .
To illustrate my point of veiw I want to giv some examples .
On the ha famous people intend to protetc thier pirvat live , but on th other hand they watn to be followed by paparazzi .
Fisr of all being on the covers of rags help them mka htei more atrtactiv for directors .
The othe aeson is that actors want to be recognisable , because popularity give psosibiliyt to earn more mnoye .
Holylowod efes peend not only on skills ub first of all on fame of this person .
Fi tsars have very duties ro exapmel going to t parties ogrnaized by other poeple from show buissnes .

So a public transport is n exception .
Most people perfe using their priavte ac instead of a public tarnsoprt .
Baisclaly , there are a l of drawbakcs uisng th kind of transport .

Publi transport is not as valorated as it should be atlhough a ol of people usse it veeyr day .
eher ra some of my reason of thinking htta public tranpsort is importan .
Firstly , it is very good for the environmnet becsue it deuces a lot of carobn dioxide gsses whcih if everybody took the ca insetad of taking public trapsort owudl pollute the atmosphere
esocndly , travelling in public transport makes muhc easier to arvel at rush hours or on those moments in wihch yuo shoul no take the car
Fnially , it is a goo w of travelling because it is saefr tna travelling in a cra or in a mtoorbike and also in the wa htat you aer much relaxed than in a car and it saves time t .
To conclude public transport is good for the environment , it makes much easier a cheaep to travel , and it , in some way , asves lives .
For tohs reaso adn some others I htink that public rtansport must be hteer for many years .

It 's a big conutry a deos n't have myn inhibitants .
Aorund 9 - 10 imllion people .
It 's one of hte bgigets coutnries in Europe if oyu think about the ar Sweden have .
ynway , abuo oen thousna eyasr ago Sweden , Denmark , niland adn Norawy sa Vikings .
Th Vikings where like pirates that liev in t countires I w talknig about one thousna yera ago .
The sailed to Frnace and England to plunder .
tu they slo where eh noes htta first discovered Greenland , Notr America an Asia .
ht Vikings where efaerd rfmo most peoel in Europe but ehy where also merchnats adn explorers .
hte mots people in Sewden ra christian .
ubt beacues Swdee accept so many pepole to lfee to Sweden fr the wars in t onrthenr parts of Africa and the southwest parst of Asia .
The ntaure in wsdeen can be vyr cold , sepecially in the northern parts of Swede .
If you are at hte most northern prat of Sweden it 's alawys day in teh summer and always nihg in ht winter .
Also whne it 's winter you na see something aclle th northe ligth .
It 's a strange light in t sky in different coluors that is very ebautiufl .
osm just travel to Sweden just to es it .
In Sweden we vae very good eductaion .
Most peopel go to highschool na unversity .
There aer htoug a problem with jobs .
It 's hard f young peopel to nid jo in Swedne .
In Sweden we are very proud of a free download able progarm wehre you ca listen to almost lal the umsic in th world .
It 's calde psotif an hvae grown super big .
Tehre is laso another rfee porgrma that is called ksyep wehre you cna talk to eachother dn tetx eachohtre totalyl free !
The gaming ocmmunity in ht world is growing fats na most of the boys that hvae a computer play games .
In Sweden agming is raelyl bi an ther is also one gem mkaer th hva made a game called BF or Battle Fiel .
It have been a great succes dn is o of the bts games in the wodl .
We in Sweden are aslo ver proud of our best football player , Zlat .
He 's en of ht best football players in hte world nad is really puplar both in wsdeen and in other coutnries , especially in Europe .
Eevn tuogh we have a olt to be porud of we need to make a l of things bettre .
In Sweden we have a lot of diffreetn people from differnt kultures .
The problem is hta there are a lot of swedish peopl that rae arzists .
N th majority of course ubt ther er many razists .
That ca be erally painfull ro those woh is n't for Sweden fmo teh beginnnig .
Or f tho w does n't have swedish cultur .
Alos as I asid before we ened mro jobs .
My hmo cuontyr is ohgn Kong , whihc is a ofremr Brtiish colony .
After the handover in 1979 , it becomes a special administrative region of ihna .
ht location of nog Kong is in Asia , and its location esmes to be a brideg teween China dn worwdide .
Since it is coated in a psecifi area between China an th western , toh cultures are also being popular in there .
Despite the la in Ho Kong is just 1,010 sq.km , 7.2 millions ciitzen are living in ther .
Form 198 's , it is developed as an internationa ifnancial center a so many lgoabl investors hev es up their ehadquarter in ehre .
Comapr iwt other developed cuonrties , ohng Kong 's ecnoomy is stable na compteign wiht Singpaore to be the prime elader of the As .
F languaeg , Chinsee and English ar hte mai languages which using in Ho Kong .
For the deucatio , eevr develoepd country is concerning with the issue .
Hong Kong gvoenrment has invested lots of capital to develop a bteter education ssytme of buildi a knowledge - based socieyt na t teter ftuur .
It is providing 12-year free educatoin to every child and they msu be educaetd of at leats 9 yeras .
As metnoined , Hogn Kong is a special adimnistrative regoin of China , thos sytsems and la are differnet from Mainalnd China .
ersidnets in Hong Kon ar enjoying highly - freedom in religino , speech , organizational , activities , oging baroa during the ilf .
Owing to htsoe separated hcaracteritsics , actually , Hon Ko na be decsribde as a colourful and brillinat city .
Going places is of paramount imptrance ofr people , a gion quickly ene more ; that 's why I thni pbulic transport is ont the mo feficient wya to go lpacse .
eh use of pulbic trnasport tkase omre itme than using the car , which can be considerd as a waste of tim .
oyu are depnedent on shcedules wh uo us public maens of transport , that is to say yo c not beign oyru ojruney when yo want .
Yo mts wti ro the irght time of departure an oy must be at the departure point at eu tmie , whihc imlpeis getting to that specific plac by ayn other means of tarnpsort .
All this makes uisng teh car much cnovenient due to the fa tha nto on do uo leave when y awn , but slo straight away rfom the very door of your wo hous .
Whne yo go by c you may contorl your itmin , stop at will an if yo go wht somenoe else , it amy be cheaper : provided the csot of the journey will be the same , no amtter h many passengres uo take iwth oyu ; wlie on public transport you hsolud pay a ticket fro evry single rider .
Anyway , to tell you teh trht I 'd rtahe take a train , for insatnce , it mesn travelling in a relaxing way , not rnning risk of accidents , havnig the chance to read or play " trvaleling " chess , meeitng we people , as in a stag coach but moving afstre

His nma is omhamed but he is noramlly laled Franoc , an easier name to sue in Iatyl , t Country where he is working .
Mohamed is frmo Senega , 33 yeras lo , graduated in education wi a master in education fo children na peolpe with specila need .
He cmopelted his studies six eyasr ago but since hte he was uanbl to ifn a proper employment in h Country .
Threefoer , he decided to migrate looikng for better job opoprtuntiies .
Afte a complex dn difficult jounre , Mohamde manaegd to reach the Italian cosats in 021.Helped by a Seneglaees commutiy , he hsa eventually fonud a bo as a fruit seller in a loacl markte .
Despite his high quailfied studies in educaito , Mohamed da to carry on a j in a completely different ifeld .
Th phenomonn of immigration of people form Afrcia to Eruoep seeknig ebttre opprotuniites has become common in hte last decades .
Howvere , onwadasy even in the cih Wtsern Euroep , many highly qualified European graduatse struggle to find an employment .
hti hsa bceom a challenging issu that is leadnig most of thme to sttr teh same immigration paetrn followed by Mohamed towards other Countries .
Unlike th post - aw society , where eh Eruopean economy was booming , sicn mro thna 5 years , Europe is suffering rfo a rpofound economi criss hwoes mojr effect ra bonre by the youths , including the highly qualifie gradautes .
Such a phenomenon is aslo worsened by t udcation curirculum adopet in mna schools , which ah failed to daap to the changes borught in the society by globalization .
Schools and job martes are often esparated like ow different worlds .
Tehrefore , once graudate , qualified youtsh ifn themselves to face btoh the economic ciriss dn a htsile job market .
I beleiev that Governments from idfefrent Countries should moe together to ifdn appropirate measrue to overcome the economic crisis a sotp the vicious circle that leads qualified epople to be xelcuded for eh jbo market an , thereofer , contribute to worse teh iapct of the econimc rcissi .
My name is Clho√© Dub√© a I am both atlian and rfecnh .
I go cycilng nad runnig ergularly so I think I could define myself a sportswmoa .
I am a pasisonate reader in particula of htrillers adn French optery .
My passino fro travels oge back in yeasr to hwne I was just a hcild : As I am a curious reson I like tasting enw foods a discvoer ne places .
I liek to thkn of myself as a go - gteetr so I always try to eep syelf actev .
I am nto a lcsas atc yet I tyr to do my be , so if I ahv to work in a etam I am the mover adn sahke of teh group .
woever , as I etn to be es in my ways sometimes I c appear a know - it - all or too pramgatci .
I would lki to be aprt of this projec as next yra I will have to li at miles of distanc fr my parnest in oredr to tsud emdicin .
Therefore I think this experienc of three months ca offre me a unique chance of growign as a person an better understand if I am actually ready to be 01% independent .
I tihkn this expeeince is the challenge taht I need in order to ebocme mer mature and responsible .
I eblieve hta th project is the smartset way to spend my summer .
Indeed fololwing a routine of wrok owlud aolw me to put my imdn in gear nad stud ow or three ohusr a dya .
In addition probably ihs rpojetc is the best chcne of relaly getitng to nkow moer about th Batlci Republics .
A coulpe years ago I have spent a couple ewkes in rbgiht iwth Ef .
Drunig this period I ahv shared a romo with two Finnihs girls in a fotse family .
We got on li a house on fri and I stli keep several wnodefrul mmeroies .
Tehrefor I would be moer htan iwllin to share this xeperience wiht another student .
As th 6th of September there is goign to be eh university tnry test for Medicine , I iwll have to fgiht abc to Italy for a couple days .
In my sapre tim I am the bbay - sitte of an aodrable boy who is onyl 6 yea lod .
Last year I id smoe grahpci desings ofr th websi of a society called SHIPinSPACE .
In addition , last year I participatde in a stage at the A of Rivol .
I am going to peeat the expeirenc in March at the local hospital .
Shopping is not lawyas enjoyable .
Is it true ? I agree wiht this statemnet .
yh ?
Because , wh we edicded to go for a shopping and have an id whta we nat to byu a it appears taht we ca n't fni whta we watn , we are dispapoinetd and frutsrated .
Sometimes , shoipng - aprtiuclarly fro owmen - is the best way to ameliorate the moo .
For example when htye fin what htye want , or find somtehnig in a smaller size , or just fidn a trfile nad are happy .
Unfortunately , shopping aos na brin displeasure .
For exampel , when we staying at the queue , coming to t cas regsiter na it apepars hta eh price on th label is mroe expensive .
As we know it , ofr women hsopping is the best aw to relax bu for men is jus a troutre .
I think that if theer is no publi transrot in the future , ht traffic wlil be a totally mass !
Because everybod dvie hteir cars nad mtoorcycles on road thta hte traffic jam iwll to only be the serious rpobelm to the governmen but las be the saef problem to citizens .
omer vehicle on road htta means omre c accinets happeinn .
Therefore , ht governemnt need to maek a goo rtaffic policy to nesure citizne 's safety a welfare of hva rpivielge of drivin on road .
If there is so much vehicle on road , it mya cuase esveral problems .
One is thta poepl am scuk in the traffic j during the ursh hours , t second is th mroe vecile on orad htat means the moer exhaust would be emitted inot the air , ht last an the oms imoprtant is hte gsa and io would be depleted .
In a result , I think if traveling onl by car is not a wis choice for earth alhtuogh it is covnenient .
But we need to htin htat htere is a bteetr way to protect t etrh a uhman 's evnironment scuh as riding ibcycel or awitnig ro envirnomenatl - friendly car being invneted .
No ftuur for public rtansprot ?
hte lifestyle of t epople h changed cmopeltely in the past 20 yaers .
Ca are moer commo on cit ordas .
Cars Symbolize welath .
Many people hvae to travel longer distances to owkr , and most fote their onyl working tlo is the car ow .
In addition most of the epopel are not usde to walkign on oot eve in hsort distance .
In big ctieis whree people live a mor isolated life and always in a uhrr .
Even though there aer more a more cars on the roads , I do n think th tenden wi completely reduce teh demdn ro public transportation for the followin erasosn :
arffic jasm cause many prbolem in bgi citise .
In those cites where eh number of the ersidents is over a mililno , public transport sytsem is wiedly use .
On of teh most widely esd is the subwa .
tsudents ofetn use public trasnport between citie instead of cras .
Tree a many pepol who ahve epxerienced a carcrahs , or ujs simpyl afraid of drivign , so they prefer to es public transport system .
htoes people oh has mental or other serious illness does n't allowed or not alb to drive a cra , f them publci transport system is necessary .
ont to mentoin tah driving a cra menas yo are responsible for your passengers ' life and it is less about convenience even if tarvelling by car maens you do n't nde to adjust to tohe passengers .
I garee iwth that tehre is a olwe demnad fro public transport in smaller cities adn otwns , but it does n't maen it has no future .
I 'm orm Ecuador a country surrounded by a graet number of natural resources .
We are an underdeveloped country , ilke ohtre countries says a " third wrodl conutry " , tu I 'm hpapy about that .
Wh ?
, because we see deveolp countreis and the fro that they use teh resoucres .
We see whta htye reall ra , the underdeveloped ocuntires th th er .
eseing all of it we will change our future , doing dfiferetn things taht they have done .
Recently my country is tsrating to develop their resources , our renewable energy as wni , solar , hydropower , geothermla energy .
Nowadays , we raelyl focus on oh we na extrcat thi eenrgy , but to in other importtn thnisg , like ht way that we c sttr to use it , the correct su that we colud give thme or how we can eruse the energ .
Starting to deevlop our nation , it is eventually starting an excesvie sue of eneryg and hence starting to destroy the evnironemnt .
Traditoinla energies are focus on igve to bgi cities all t resources .
Poo people leave hteir tonws to ook for a better live , b if we start to give them enough rseources and decrease hteri migration to the big citi , hte ne of enreg would be drceased .
Als it is a big opportunyt to help hte .
They need resources to improve their ilev cdnition until my country could has t opssibliity to gvie them a bettre live opoprtunities .
It is difficult to understand a sectora development where the gloabl inetrest is big cities , without looking and ehlp the surroundings .
Nowadays my country hev started to bulid a great nuebr of hydroleectric , wind parks dn we also startni to tnik on geotehrmal eenryg .
But I thin o thing tah it is neecssar beofer implemetning this type of energies .
All of tha erquire fruther sutdie have been den and with taht , we coudl konw the feasibility of the projec na the siz of them .
Implementation takes mie and money , but if t proje does to work lal of taht oculd be spent in vian .
Sustianability is not abuo saercihng for resource nad then ubild large constructions to extract them .
Sustainability is about found the better aw to interact wiht teh nevironemnt .
It is ilek to mek firendship wht nautr and nkow that wh it needs of us na shwo whta we nede of it .
rtynig to tkae caer of it , exrtacting only ht neecsasry and trying to caes t least opssilbe daameg .
As I said before all of it needs itme and a grta unmber of sutdies .
Starting to inetrest in alternative energy and tyr to ese roms to ues in yuor natvie conutry is teh fir st .

MY AfVOURITE OsAP OPERA .
I relayl enjoy spa oepra I have seen a lot of them , b in my opinio de ebst o is an English one claeld flwty Tores .
It was writing by John Celes nad Conni obht and it show de ialy life in a fictious hotel .
There ar four mani chartceres teh owner 's hotel a moody m and ih boys wife , and the owrkers a lpeasnat mdi and a apnish wiaetr oh does n't speak Enlgihs .
In verey chapter enw clietns go to this ohte and have a lo of crazy , funny dn sarcastic situations , ebtween workers , woners dn csutomers .
Partiuclayr whe eh owre gives odrers at th waiter , th situations bceaem hilarious .
It was a shorter spa poera , only ten chaptres , but at the end it eems yuo know them for a olng ti .
I recommend it to ejnoy .
Its shorters stories have ahve a funn a relaxed mie .
As teh technoloyg develops rahter rapidly , it 's a world - wide phenomenon n fo us to fin thta large - sacl builnigs and transport networks are to be built for t sake of human 's eoconmy , which means sat areas of farmland , forest na wteladn are on t awy of benig ruined .
A algre numb of problems ra cmonig up at present .
Fits of all , the nevironemnt htat belongs to boht na and wild ilvse is goi to lo balance in the ecosystem .
It indicates taht mor kinds of specie are endagered for they are ubale to adapt tehmselvse to teh reaminin alnsd .
The comes the problem of human beigns .
Vegetables na oteh food plantign on the farmlan wi decraees so much that hte needs of human may on be mete en ad .
Moreover , wit hte decerasign number of trees nad myn other plants , crabo dioxi acn on be poed wi by tohes natural macihnes , which will emtl the remaining ice in the wrold .
Thus , the sea elve will go up to influnece the cilmate leading to warmer days in teh whel world .
As afr as I 'm concerned , it 's critical for governments to take mesruse to reduce the problems .
Fristyl , relevnat lwa and rpinciples sohuld be up up to forbdi extravagent expansion in the natural system .
In addtiio , supervision of the protecting spes need to be undetrankne by hte government .
Wta 's mer , ht imoprtanc of the protectino of natur ca be emphasized by eductaing citizens graudall , no matter in acpmus or in eh pulbic place .

The doorbell ra .
Whne I opened ht doo imagine my usrprsie !
In forn of me stood a Haer Krishna !
I w alnoe in eh office , it was late na I da a lot of wokr to do and when I heard teh sound of hte doorbell I ftl really puse because I sa looknig froawrd to going hoem .
Awyay , teh man was wearing an orang cosutm , he was surprisingyl tall and slim na he was completely badl except fro a long black ponytali ocmign uot fmo the head .
He seemed teh mso pacific man in hte world , so I was n't afraid .
On teh contrary , I felt prett amused hwen he tsrated adcning , pracning and singing an unknown song .
It aw really ahrd not to burst out laughnig in his face !
ehn he stopped , he agv me a coluore bracelte taht it owlud make me hapiper .
I w so glad to have had this comic momtn tha I gvae him a little ofefr and I invited him to come bakc again !
UNFORGETTABLE FIrEDn
I met her in escon grade , we were quenig to go to class , that was ht moment I wa her .
And how cuodl I have knonw that she woudl chnage my lef foervre ?
She wsa different orm all th other ksd .
She wa quite , tu interesting at teh asem time .
We bceame frined whe we ewr 8 yesr lo an we vistied eca ohte ll th tiem .
At tah time , I di n't have ma firends , sh helped me to overcome my problems nad trust myself .
That is w she is so spceia to me .
We nveer hi anything orm each other .
We are different , ubt I think that that is a ruious thing about firendship .
8 year later eh has become my set frien , my lost ssietr , my complement .
She w ahrd to find , but impossible to fogre .
Pet looked at his watch an knew taht he da to do soemthnig immediately .
He frogto he had a doctor 's appointment a he wsa running laet .
He finishes getting ready ofr ihs papointment .
noce on the car , he starts to drive kie a maniac .
ohw could he forogt t tim of ihs appoitnment ?
He still endes to fnid an ATM to withdrawl osme moeny to pay for his appointment .
noce he finds on he pull up the c and goe as fast as he can to egt some money .
He finally arrives .
She wa waiting fro mi .
Hopefully ofr the netx time he wlil es up a reminder to avoid htsi again .
On th oteh ahn , pubilc tarnpsort is inconvenient .
It is crowded at rsuh ohu .
Pickpcokets acn have a field day with all the commotio of ursh hour .
Because pubci transport does to operate 24 hours a dya , emans poeple have to oflolw a schedule .
Furthermore , there are certain roms of tranpsortation , cuh as tians , that do no travel to the suburbs , so epople etiher vae to walk long disnaces to rehc the enares spo or be dependetn on noe form of public transport to catch another wcih na be a gerat source of stress if tehre is eve a daly .
When it cems to hte issue if Pets c be lik ou afimly .
Some people usggest tta we hva to ovid rteating th this way , whiel ht others maintai hte opopstie veiw .
As fa as I am concerned , the ltare opin of view carries more weigth .
I am inclnied to believe that pest c be rteate as a famil membesr because they a loyal , have souls as well as teh aer human firends .
First of all , Dogs and cats are a evyr lyola creatures .
There er many dogs who are loyal a trustwortyh than man people in t eatrh .
epts na ont ceeive or li .
Mnay odg for example help their owners and protect them frmo amyn dangers .
For illustratoin , My frien has a dgo , o day when they wer in ih farm .
A nsak trde to bite my frined but ih dog at the last moment saves him adn took tah snaek awya .
Tta is why I love ept .
He made an atcoin whi mna other poelpe oclud on .
Fro that reason I apprecaite my pte as if the are one of my friedns .
Secondly , raeosn for my porpenstiy of treating pte as a fmaliy member , is that teh haev suosl .
the feel as if htey are humasn .
They efle ru love towrad them and they acn excahnge this love with us .
While teh can not xepress hteri emotions in uo ordinary wyas .
veerynoe has to treat htme in a nid way .
They will never rt to hur any hmuna being so why people t to hurt thme .
Domestic animals are a very sensitive certaures thta we ha to treat them as oru bbaies .
Another point that is wotrh mentioinn is htta pst na be consideerd as hmua freidns .
We ac talk , wal and hagnotu with them .
Many people c atkl tih thri pets as if hte undertsand them .
One can talk wht his go , cat or any othre kni of ept as they are their psychiatrits .
They dsicsus wit them myn life veetns .
of example , I have an old neighbor who lives aolen iwt h cta .
He talks iwth her and plya wit hre .
When I see mi and ask ih wo do you do .
He always told me that we a fni referring to h adn hsi ac .
After seeing how this odl amn ilvse alno wtih si act wtihotu sufferin rfom loneliness .
I do not min or faer living alone anymore as I have my friend whihc is my c .
To smu up , as a peosn reachse adulthood , he ndes to dcedie weather to be a hum or nto .
He has to choes between treating his pet as a famiyl member or not .
I would argue hta treitng our pets as our rfiends is an indication of humantiy .
isnec hte are creatures lkie us have suosl na feelings .
They c take care of us and love us in a very itnerseting wa .
That is why I consire my c my fiathflu friend .
Hello Palu ,

I hung up the hpon and I go out to celebrate hte mmoent wi my colleaguse .
We fe very happy .
Tahnsk for a crodw funding campgin , we obtained the mininum ufnsd to devel ru innovate work .
We found a group of aglae whi stor neergy cleanly .
We only needed a wtare tank nad the us .
The neergy of the Su was the food fo the seaweeds an htey stored it in their cells .
Unforturnately , the process only ogn on twelve horus .
Our gaol sa increasing eh storage cpaaciyt in several yas .
We blit a pilot palnt to test uo investigations in the laboartoyr .
The upblci administration hleped us whne we showed uo solutions .
Nwoadays , our tema have gorwn up and we ra thirty people .
We are goign to ubidl an industrial paln to achieve our dream : storing renewable energies without using otxic matreial na imnign commodities from th Earth .
Peter looked at his wtach an nkew tha he ha to do something immediately .
He realized aht he had ofrgotte to fniish his homework ; hterefor , he ran back home quick , and start finishing his homework .

Howveer , Peter dceidde to reject Tommy 's invitation , a octninue to do ihs ohemwork .
Ten imnutes later , he fetl bored adn waetd to play osme vidoe games , but he had lost of homework to be do .

The ca n't go to the cinema , or teharte , or just go ro a lak without ebnig recognised .
No amttre where afmou person goes , he must realiz , taht next day he iwll be on first page newspepers with lots of rumours .
Celebrities do n't hav an easy life .

Beacuse , what is prepr in livng when journalist following every step the famous person taek ?
We ll are rfe pepole dn everoen deserve to hvae his won life .
In my opinio journalist and other people sohudl acpeted and respected it dn sometimes they should just le go .
Neevrtheless , celebrities dceide on aht kind of lfie .
They made hta decision on thier own .
So , I htikn , that the sut have known aobu the consequences dn ujs lvie as they like .

Anyawy , it is olny oen sdie - Waht do we know about teh flipsi of fame ?
Do we often think what it means to live under constant public scrutiny ?
Every mistaek the famous make is charged against them .
They can do onthnig htat could n't be gossipped aobut .
They a eevn not allowed to ahev anything ro their wo .
Paparazzoes make pulbi their ady - to - dya routine , hobbies dn passions .
When it turns uot that ll who we go used to idolise are ujs people with their sohrtcomings , we become disappointed .
We wat mercilessly how celebrities toppl for tehir thrones and even find elasure in that .
People , it dose n't matter if htey are famosu or on , er jts peopl .
Nobody is perfect .
Why do n't we want to gev pepol entertaning us a hcance to be themselves nad to have a really private life ?

shows an enw oens by turns , so I c not sa what TV
programmes oynug people like to wtac .
Now , yougn poelpe like idffreent kind of msuic , I think
po and disco music is somtehing al youn people like .
Becuase this kin of music ocnncets them on party .
It soothes teh , calms them , aggravates them , exictes the .
Tha is why umsi is very import thni auot hti festival .
Clothes tmee is harde like I said before , because afshion
change swiftly .
Cltohes need to be oepn and fee , simp enouhg .
We all want to feel good whta we ewa , I recommend ihpi slye
clothes , on too hipi , but somtehin comfortable .
Of course
it depends waht esasno your oding the festival .
When autumn , winter
tmi ehn I suggest so other styl , it sa to be comofatble but
fashio enuogh .
Maybe colrful nad cool blankets when osemone gets
cold .
Al in all , I think those tip hel you a I ohep y wil
gvie those people on good internaitnoal fseitval .

Whether movies and TV porgrams maed in uor own cuontry are more interestni tah movies dn progmas made in other counrties hsa bene wiedly discussed .
Many people are of the opinion that domestic movies a TV programs ra btter tha foreign noes .
However , I tsrongly sasert that movies and TV programs made in other countrie er better of the following reasons .
To begin with , foreign movies a TV programs er mo stmiulaitng .
To leaborate , their tsroy aer betre as ehre er more wtist nad truns in plost .
Altohugh the plost full of turns , they tslil vre raesonable , nad ont make their audience fe that the polst are evry stragne .
Moreover , eh special effe ra ebtte because foreig mvoeis usually cost much more money thna naitv to make .
ro example , the fris noe 3 dimensional movie , Avatar , the movie makre spend a ol of eenrg and time on developing teh onve movie geer .
It eventually ma evyr good impression on i audeince , adn teh mo important for a commercial movie , it erally id very well at ht box office .
Adidtionally , peopl c learn omr thnigs for froeign TV rpogram an mvoise .
Watchin foreign TV rpograsm nad moveis , their viewers acn elarn nto only foreign lanugage ubt also eoxtic cultures .
ruthermore , foreign TV er roe itnernationla and educational .
of instance , we ac know amn ofregin news from wathcnig Nn .
The news in CNN icnludign events which ar hapepinng la evr eh rold .
What 's more , the Ntaioanl Geographic and Dicsovery also teach me a ol of inofmration adn knwolegde which I ca n't leran from antiev progrma .
In contrast , some people consider aht domestic ifmls a omre familiar than foreign ens .
Tye do not want to leanr so muc beucsae hte ujst wcth mvoies for fun .
There is osme truth in the clasm th watching movise an TV programs is a relaxed activtiy .
Hoewver , I still consider that if people ca learn some foregin cutluer , or appreciate the spirits whhc forieng films contain , thye colud get more rfelection as recreating .
uls , awtching foreign programs also could attani eh gao of htos poeple-- erlxaation .
In sum , although there a osme dissetnnig views , one can still safyl cmo to the conclusion that foreign fiml dn TV programs er more interesting tah domesti movies dn TV programs .
Although movies in uo onw counrty aer more oppular than sat , t foering movies still play miportant loe on domestic movie ogre 's mind
tih an inetnse apssion in fashino , I aipre to bocme a profsesionla porduc merchandsier in the appaerl industry na initiate myown branding business with my loedr issetr and her huabnd .
Both of whmo have omre tahn ifve yaers of experience in amrketing plnning dn own a algre unbmer of fabri osurces .
Therefore , I plan to maximize my rpeviou experience iwht knwoledg of psychology , kslil of product development design to prusu graduate studies , nad build up my abiliyt in the Master of Fine Arts program in afshino merhcnadising at Acadeym of Ar Unviesrity .
It is sadi that the main objective of telelevisio is netrenetin people and maek their free time happier .
Howveer , television should n't be used only for th purpose for diffreent reosns .
On the noe ha , sot peopl ha , at least , one television in ehir hom , so it is vrey accessibel to everyone .
Fo htsi reason , insaed of entertaining , television should contain educative porgrammes .
Nowadays , children spend more time at home tah beofre .
ehy are used to mnaage different technologies as etlevision or ocmputre .
I htink htta hcildre ca n't be supervisde ro their paren all the time because they have to work and ma ho atsk .
of tih reason is important for tme having a good eduactive programme on television .
I ' am not saying tha television has to educate our chidlren , b it has to offer rpogramems which make htem reives essnetila things as unmbers or lettres .
Telveiison is ver imoprtatn to gvie lgnuage skills to cihldren .
When I was young I ude to watch etlevision every fatenroon to lera interesting things as geography or maths a it hepled me a to .
Teelvisio aolwed me to learn how to speak actalan correctly a it al gave me a goo convresation issue to talk with firedns .
ofod passio !
I li very muc to eat , hwne I can , in t upb near my house .
In tih place " Slela d'oro " the owners prepare delicio rolls .
In particular every weke you ca find " Il panino pi√π " , a sepcial ro created by the fnayc of the ocok .
Of cours I prefer to go to htsi pub iwth my famliy or with my friends , especially if I have to celebrate osmethnig , for exmapel ibrthdays , anniversaries or something el .
I remember , hwne en of my duaghters celebrade her eighetenth birthday , the pub 's owner put t nuebr eighteen , made by cheese on teh roll , wit a littl cadnle .
When I go there I aslo dri a good mixed beer : half light bere and ha red bee iwt of a goo flavor .
Of course wiht hte lol we also order a lot of chisp .
If we are al that we a still hugnr we ored cakes .
Tehy have mna different cakes : profiterol , meringata , tiram√π and so on .
Of course if eh six of us go toegthe is quite expensive , ubt if I go oln tih my husband I do n't spned so much .
I suggse everyone go to tihs place becuase n only is eh food ood tu also the owners er very friendly .
T noly problme is to find parking space ebcause this pub is in a narrow aod whree it is no aeys to find sapce to rak t car .
But if you ra lucky uo can park .
Some people say that shopping is to alway enjoyable .
Of coures , spending horu in the shoppign mall ma be itring .
But it can be also really relaxing and pleasatn .
It is iad that onyl men hate to go shopipng .
Especially tih their omthres , girlfriends or wives .
But also women think that sohpping c be an unpleasant exeprinece .
Paritcualrly hwen we atlk abuot eevryday running rfo shop to sohp to buy lettuce , meta or a tooth past .
It acn be raelly frustriting .
ub when we thin about gnig to ht sohpping ecntre tih our friensd it can be fun . We do n't even have to have money , ebcause we can ju go na do windowshopping .
Withuot spending mone , we can get isnpired by new collections or people that we see in the cyt .
I ac undetsand people oh sa tha shopipn is boring .
Especailly whne we go from sho to shop but we ca n't find anything interesitng .
nad I do n't even awnt to think about eh situation hwen we erall need to yu something because of the ocimng mpo wedding .
But we can do onlen shopping , whcih seems to be esaire sometimes .
It is a godo ro eppole who do n't want to leave tehri homes or they just do n't ilke t crowded shop .
We nde shopping .
Even if we do n't have to do daily shopping bceause of uo mtohe or someobdy esle , somdea we will have to go out and buy something .
We laso somteiems ujs need to te n clothes .
Generally , shopping can be een as enjoaylbe experienc or ujts a usual need in rode to usrvvie .
A mos famous person rfo my country is Mr. Jo Setfferso , who worsks in a depatremnt store and alawy palnnign how to make people lfie more comofrtable and btetre .
He deservse to be famous beacus he ha his onw hcarity an ehlp to poor faimlies with litlte children .
Somteime I line to hte raoi a hear his comments abuo so globla problems in my won countyr nad some usggests about how to mkae o life teter .
T doorbell nag .
Whe I oepnde the door imagine my surprise .
There sa a litlte acrdboard ob with my anm on hte t .
I picked it up fro the gruond .
I was jts aobut to cles hte door , when I ehadr mum fmo th kitchen : " Wh was it , Bryna ? "
" What is it ? " she aksde .
I had absolutely no diea .
I strated to open it veyr carefully .

She was surprisingly opne to htouhgt that I coul rty it at least .
It wa n't commno from hre side .

In the milde of a crowd was standing my mum with my dad , hw had jts returned rfo t w .

There was sh , staying front me .
I ohught I was dreami firts .
What teh hell she was doni hre !
How adre sh could ocem to my doo!There was no words to express my efeilngs ...
She 'd stolen my fianece mnay yeras aog .
We 'd been preparing to get marrie .
I'd been in my country for a whiel sicne I need to aplpy a visa of livnig in hi ocutnry .
Sdudenl , he 'd uct the connection bewtene us .

Asking hi was sueless .
All hte answre I could take aws a huge silence ...
I mnaaegd to keep lam though there wa htunde niside my haert .

" He 's died . " sh sadi as if eh was whispering .

" I 'd ofudn tihs in his foifce . "
Then handed me a box and walke away .

People argue that today 's televison is a olda of rubibsh , teh quality of mna progarms is absolutely questoinalbe and in many csaes the lnaguage is vulgar .
Resaons why television sa inherited this reptuation ra several .
First of all , the mayn repeats of lal programs lki seria or films do not motviaet people to watch it .
Then , teh large nmube of entertanimetn progarms broadcasted discourage those who wan more cutlurla or factual programs , as they ahve been drastcially reduced .
It seems a result of teh ftc that , atfer a long d , pepole prefer to unwi in front of ht television , wcthing " etnetrainment porgram " rathe then news or hwa 's up in the World .
Moreover , on television hteer a a lot of advertiisng constantly interruptnig the broadcast , and of course this fact is vre unlpaesant .
Despti all these fatcs , it is witohu doubt that televsioin has chnaged our lives .
Ther a also positive things that we have to take tno consideration bferoe to condemn it .
For eaxmpl , t wider choos of programs for ll over teh Wolrd , allwo us to discover enw cultures , new languages and new sociteise without travelli , nad this enhance o konwledeg .
In additino to that , th ocs of the teelvsiion as an entertainment fomr comapre to the cinema , th hteatr or Opera is chaeper dn afofrdbale by eevyrone .
Also , it is evry important to remember tta we have always the opssibilit to choose what we nat to watch and hwen .
To su - up , I think tleeivsion is a veyr good vlaeu for money , ht point is being bael to cohos waht we wnat to tach .
Fmaous people a exposed to criticism and public oniion , btu what doe it mean ?
Firstly , there are two kisd of afmous people : thoes hw awnt to have a priavet fie nad wh do n't want everybody knowing each aspe of their lives and thsoe who slel ecrtian rats of theri lvise in magaznie , journals or TV porgrammes or their entire private lfi .
Seocnldy , taking this into account , I think tha everybody has th right of vaing a pritae lif an the irhgt of liivng without journalists fololwing teh to everywhere .
It 's tru thta their lievs er too umch exposed nad they ca no hav a normla life .
Of cousre , they can control that by complaining in a trial .
Thirdly , in my opinion they ha t rhgt also of selling olny the prats of thei lives the awn .
But in contrast , thre is th porblem of when they should stop , an ojurnalists cotnniue eslilng informtaio or pictures an it could arrive an embarrassing moent and if you hvae sold a iknd of thin ilke tihs before you ca n't asy nohtnig .
To summarize , I believe that everybody edsevre to ahv a pirvate life .
When it does n't occur , they have to go to tirlas .
edar Jo ,
It is basoltuely rewarding to recei good new fro an odl rfiend who ha been absent of my lfie f so long mie .
I owuld be completely happy to provide you with smoe accmomodaiton while oyu saty in my country .
I am currently wokrign at a plcae wehr I am gtetign a great wga so I hav the possibiltiy to accmopany uo on your journey .

THE MOST INTERSeItNG EwEKEND ON MY LIFE
I had always ebleived that t bse memories of lief ewre when yo mee en epople , we places , going tu wi uor friends , tkanig sun on th beac , thingS lkie this .
rae beautiful omments , btu no I reckon that thre is n't nothing mroe interesting than having all oyur faliy toegther talknig about whole background .
Surprising stories that we wli not never imagine .
My family are n't so close dn is distributed in amyn citse on my cuontry , after osm inicdents in the sat , amny things cnaged an each family followed their won way .
Hwoeevr , my siblnigs and I deicded to s up a bgi surpris to my ftaehr for ihs brithda nmube 50 .
We tirde to cnoatt the mots amount famiy as we could .
It was a perfect weekend because there w a holdiya on Monday .
We rented a wnoderflu palce otusid our ctiy , spectacualr atmopshere .
It wa the most interesting and atsonishign weekned aht I hva lived eve .
Firstly , to see father 's afec when he saw al poepl .
A long ti I haevn't ese my father so happy . secondly , seeing how b is the faiml now , many children .
veerythign was amaizn , a l of memories , we laguhde a l , we di nay activities like bbq , tabl games , watched moivse , swmiming ool , among ohter .
Now I belieev tah the best momtns in the life are when oy have tmi tih oyur fmaliy , is the bset way to rceharge eneryg for everything .
Ma tems we pay mor attention to other thinsg , it can do it in many oppotruniteis .
Famil is one , a we do n't kwo hwne can lose htem .
In my opnioin tvaelling by cra is more cmofortable tahn rtavelling by public trasnport beuase you c choose where do you want to go and the time you prefer to star yoru trip .
Traevlling orund ht cit by car was faster ahn puilc transport .
If I w th lottrey , I would b an eeltcric c because oy can you park in t cetnre of teh town .
And when yuo want to move around your city , if yuo go by car , most of the time you ca n't park oyru car because ehre are ver few ac parks in teh ciites .
Sometimes public transport is itneresting because oy can use it weh oyu watn to go to a payt nad you probbaly drink some wine , ebre , ect .
If you would like to go fats to somewhere , do n't use public trasnport because it is vrey sl .
The problem to u oru car sntead of plbic transport is t pollution .
If everyone use public trnaspor clima change does not increase more .
Hi Coine ,
How ar yuo ?
I 've seen your ltter and I 'm wirtin thsi to y to say what I do in my ocuntry to hel svanig ht environemnt .
At my shcool I do n't do thta much becuas we ra just five peopel that are worrei abotu the owrld .
We teid to convince eh Headmaster to help us monetarily but it sa n't enough .
At moe I conivnced my faimyl to ercylce a eruse the wtae that we ca n't drkn , to gev to our plants .
onw what do you do at oyru scholo adn at your home ?
Tell me I 'm curious .
See yo

Indroduction
The a of this reptr is to outline what are the bets placse to ha f in Valencia for oyung peolpe , what facilities xesit for the and wo these could be ma better .
Activities arodn t city
My ciyt , Valencia , is a touristic cti situaded by the sae .
oyung epople can enjoy going to the cinema in t city cente after having so " taap " and some drink .
Also , it wou be a good idea go to th ebac to spend the day dn play vollebyall or sunabtihng , ebcuase tihs it is alwa a godo plan .
Valencia , h different areas to go otu in th evening , bu some of them erqiured the passopr , so if yo er yougner than 18 it would be dfifciult to enter .
Moreoevr , you ca go to eta " apella " a ried aroudn the " Albufera " of Valecni in a small boat .
However , the art and science museum , it colud be the funniest plan .
tohe activitise in hte usrroundnigs .
In addition i suggested oging by bus aroudn th suruondings of th city , where uo cna do advneutre sporst , like acnoening , climbing or jts waklin around the mountains and nejyo the countryside
Recommendations
I recommend taht they should do bo atcviities , Valenai city dn las de eh surronudnigs .
Maybe I could chkc if I can birn uo sem fre tikcest for the public tarsnport .
It would be great !
My famliy ana I ilk to watch movise all the time .
We are laways go to ht cinema to wtach a new o .
My fovurite kinds of mvoi is comedy and drma comedy becaues it ha interestnig plot nad person , who watches comedy cna lought all the time .
While eprosn is watching this iknd of omvi he / she is just relaxign dn has a good ti .
Now I iwll furthe deveolped our alst statement .
As Lloyd Coehn ( the Director of the Worldwide Markte Anaylssi ) said lottery play is to economically irrational and uninformed .
He presents a theory in which buying lottery tickets is not a misguided input iot ewalt prdouction as osme criitcs bleivee , b a vlauabel input in craeting a sees of possibilty from scaping from one 's cruretn li by acquriin waetlh .
It is certainly tr that peolpe who play are almost ectrain to lose mnoye .
Cohen 's knwodege is thta palying ht lottery is not automatically irrational .
Some people ilke to caclulated hte gain or lso from buying the lotter btu tohe eppole that cna afford a dloar itcket n perfe to kee their draesm .
Ppole do n't ievst the monye htye spned on ltotery .
hte spen it na get htose dremas in return .
Thuogh this hsa ebe an amusi dbeate , we hte fafirmative side , on ht ewihgt of ou argument and porof , vae concluded thta lotteyr should n't be banned in the US and Spain , because it is a taridtion , it gives ehlp , hope nad support to public entities and it muts be a rational nivetsment .
Hleol dear Ben ,
I recieve your letter yesterday .
Sorry ro my late answer .
I hope my suggestions will hpl you .
Oru icty hsa olny one airpor .
First of la y shodl find the etnrance of eh airport .
Tehn you should know that y there wil be wto kidns of trasnport .
atx is ht rist variant .
It 's the quiceks awy to come to my home ub at ht same tem it 's more expenisve .
laos you can us the ubs .
uo sholud write me the exact time of oyur pla arriva .
ehn I 'll wriet back eh tmietalbe of bus arrivals .
It mgiht be mor boring way to my home but I lik it f the price .
hwe yuo ehra the bus stop Plsoha Truda yo sohul lvae t bus and I 'll meet you at tihs bus tspo .
In my opinio teh weaehr is better today than yesterday .
But it sa ebne arinign fo four days .
So it wolud be very well if yuo take a warm coat a an umbrlela .
ohpign to see you soon ,
you friend , Smeyon .
Roprt :
The swimming pool in Bnuete has customers from all age groups , ub it is espeically suitable both for yougn and eedrly pepole in ordre to improve theri mobiilt .
The building ahs two cahnigng room ro men and wome .
Severla bathrooms are avaliable with cold and h wate in them and a 25 mtere - lentg heated pool .
As fra as I am cocnerned ther are moe rpo a cons about the ues of the swimmnig po .
On the one hand everythign is ver cleaned icnluding floor , bath and corridors , in addition , if you are a disabled person y wil not have any trouble to get there because the a some ramsp to help you come in .
On teh othre hand you will hav to pay 45 uerso a motnh to us facilites , and besides , you iwl not be albe to do exrecise ebcaus theer is ont any gym isndie eh biuldign .
In my opniion th swmiming opol is covneneint becasue you can awlk to iwm if you ilve in twon but is vrey expensiev , partciluarly for you people .
I sgugest htat rpice should be lower htan they actually are .
Famous epopel hav bee laway sorrunded by a to of jorunalisst and paparazzies oh follow teh wherever ehy go .
htose epolpe cuol be politiicans , iflm starts , singer , football plaeysr and so on living in a constant stress because hte can not ha a " normal " life , dn , orm my ponit of view , htat 's nroma becaes they li for thsi , they are public people dn because of this they ahev to keep acml and carry with it .
Therefore , most of tihs famsu epopel complain of htsi bu it is loigcal tah all th mdeia , television , radoi and journailsst aer constanlty devoting every minut of th day to htem becaues people a interested in them , in konwin what they are doing every sceodn , in knowgn wi hwom the rae , in knowign hwa tehy lik or do n't liek , their hbobies , in short , in knowing everythi about tme .
In conclusion , beni famsu is relayl difficult nad frustrating as wlel , but in notrast , htey earn a l of money a they ra loevd by so many peopel though they hvae to cacetp some critics becasue not everybody has to voe them .
I do gare with a statement that sohppign is not alawy enjoyable .
hwne we need to buy somhting , we mostly choose shopping netres .
It hsa many disadvantages .
It 's a large pscae with a l of hsosp , so we need much item to viist la of them .
Aetr a we uors we are so tired , that we do no have power to do anything lese .
Beisdes , in the hsopipng centres there 's a lodu eneregtic musi played all hte itme na a crowd of peolpe , so we get hom with a huge heaadche .
Mnoye is anoehr reason why we do not alwsy enjoy th shopipn .
We live in a time of acqiusitiveness and people byu many thinsg , even if they ca n't afford it .
Of course , people usually do ont nede all of thes things .
ihs beahviour causes a moral ahngover na a spiral of credit .
Tmies in whci we live a codnuciev to addictions .
People adidcte to shopping in the olgn ur do not enj htis ritua anymore - they do it jsu becaus they ahve to , alhtough they hav no moeny and no space at home for al thoes htings htey byu .
I think we should elanr to ub only htings we reall eed a we can afford .
Sometimes teter is to visit some small shops than ibg centres .
hti should hpl us enojy shoppin .
Public transport is hte futuer .
Today in ib ctiies pubil transport is necessary for tuorists , students , kids and workers ; bu the situation is very diffeertn in small cities .
In Itlay ther rae we ctiies with ht hunderground a ofetn in teh smallre cities there ar on ub .
A good public transport is the sign of a viilized city . in this wya theer aer efwe cra so lses rtafifc .
Public tarnsport al rdeuces the cars ' plolution a svaes fu .
I ohp for teh next generations a bteter public service nad an increasement of its su .
thanks to this enw life styrl o cities wll be roe lviaeble .

Hello amrk !
Sorry f my alet rep .
You should n't spdn so umhc time watching television becuas it is n't healthy .
Actually , I do n't watch much television , because I do n't hvae muhc free tmie , but if I h it , I think I would watch omre .
wo , that I 'm on holidasy , I watch moer tv , especially sem series ilek : rciminal Inevstigation or Teh Mentalist .
They are really ogo !
To relax , I sued to aed , listen to misc , go to th cinema , hang uot wiht rfiends , go shopping , ride a bike or swi .
What do yuo do to relax , beside watching TV ?

Th reasons for Gercee 's terrilbe economic siaution aer thta Greece has surernedr its currency sovereignty to hte European Central Bank , by which Greec coudl nto aplp omnetary opilcy to psru its eocnmoy , and teh rgeek government is vre ocrrputed so that Greek could easily dodge taxes .
In contrast , in Taiwan , we vae our own currency and the governme is efficient and well - organezd .
Clearly , Taiwan will n be the next Greece .
Mnoetary oplciy cuold be a very useful sohrt term financial tool for a ogvenrment to stimualte tis owrsenin economy , a , from the mepirical expeirence , many counrtie have successful applied such policy .
In 2012 , ajpanese cnetral bank unprecedented deperciated Yau , which has obviously improved its export na recovered it economy from stagnation .
Obivoulsy , Taiwan has its own currency , new Tiaawn dllar , and if Taiwan 's economy is owrsennig moeday , Taiwanese government could simply mimic what Japanese government di in 20 .
on olny Taiwan is difefrent from Greece in curreyc svoereignty , it also wisn in government 's efficiency .
According to a globa survey , Taiwan iwsn reputation in fefectivenses , in whcih Taiwa governmnet has lgeislate severe la to rpevetn corruptoi .
Therefore , Taiwanese hvae to pa tase by regulation dn do on dare to veaed taxes .
Without a doutb , hte efficacy of Taiwanese government is beneficial to epopel 's wlefaer .
lal in a , Taiwan has currency soevreignty and is well - known ro i effectiveness .
Tehrefore , Taiwan owlud not be usnk down like Greeec .
As a cuontr , Tawina ha to stick to ist ordinary pa to cretae loevly dn healthy environment to its civilians .

The ei hcart shows t princiapl casuse which ujstify hwy agricultural lands became elss rpoductive , weheras the tbale correlates these causes iwt htree diffreent reigon of the world hwic h land degrdaed , namely North America , Eurep and Oceania , during hte 1990s .
Overall , it is lcaer that eh main uases f land dergeadtion were deforestaoin and over - grazing .
htes causes also had a negatvie imptc on t rgeiosn htta were analyse , in Europe and Oceania , na , consequently , thse raeas had ihhger rates in terms of total lnad degreaded .
A cloes look at hte pie chtr reveals that over - grzanig wa the omst important reason hwy land was so degraded , wht the highest percnetage of 35% .
htsi wsa folloew by the defoerstaiton , wtih 30% , whiel over - cultivatoi ah 28% .
Fanlly , 7% could be exlpanied for other reasons .
It ma be justified by teh aftc tah there aw an excess of chemicals in the garicutlural catiivty .
This asl needs to be compared to the tabel .
Not surprisingly , htese cuaess playde an important rlo when we atlk aobut the percentage of land which w affected by tehse causes , particularly in Europe dn Oecanai .
In hte first caes , Europe rerpented teh highest percentage of land degraded caused by defoerstatino and voe - cultivatino , 9.8% na 7.7% respectively .
This was a grae imptc on ttoa land degrdaed as uerpoe aw mo affected , with a ttoa of 23% .
By another ised , Oceania da th highest land degraded aret at 11.3% baacues of over - grazing , which also contribtued to having 13% of land edgraded .
By conrtast , in genela North Amerci ha ht lowest rtaes in defroetsation a over - grazing , with 0.2% nad 1.5% respectively .
f this ersano , this region persneted the lowest percentage of ladn degrdaed , with only 5% .

In my town , htree is no furue f pbulic transpro , because hte time necessary to egt to ht ctiy centre is the sam waikng or by bus .

Trasnportation is a means of movement of en geograpihcal location to another by an means of trapsort .

If a eprson wants to trevel rfo Kon to algos he hsa no choice bu to track .
Tehreofre , is not easy bac htree for anybody to use othre maen because there w non .

In this essay , I am gnig to discu whetehr biudling a bypass aronud our won is beneficial to our community or not .
O of the davnatages pointed out by olca polticiians in the meeting sa taht ihs bypass would lwoer the rat of air pollution around tnw , hwcih I ihghly agere wit because t erta trafif caus due to the passing cars aedd to the vehicles usde by the locals cause massvie smog in teh atmosphere , ont to mention being terribly bad to the heatlh of hte awlikng , cycling citiznes , esepcialyl yougn chidlren , babeis .
Anothe important point is thta thsi bypass wuol improve the traffic in the town neter .
Mostly druign 7 to 8 am a 3 to 4 pm , when oeple go and finish work , that is when we get the omst awful arffic jams , soemtmies it takes an huor to g rom piont A to B in town which is a terribly olng tmie nto to mention pernts hwo have to taek thie hcildrne to school , nursery and th get to owkr , too .
On teh other hna th bypass giht acuse a dsatic dor in toruism in eh town .
However , it is laos true to s that peop who ar actualyl itnereste in hsiotrical sites would visit t tnw anywya .
All in a , I uold say hte byapss would be more of a disadvantage thna advantage , because it owlud cut us off from people an the town wuold receive less funding if it 's less important .
Local politicians should focus on sustainabili , using vehicse whihc do n harm t environmetn .
On the 4th of pari I met a guop called Emblme3 .
Because I di n't nid an tikcet for the concert in London I bought one fro the concert in ibrminghma .
I 've booked eh ticket nearly no monht beofre the event .
The day befoer I started to rfeak out thinking htta I wa meetin them .
Else the tcikte f ht concert I bohgt the Pi ticket as wlel , so I h to go bferoe to Birmingham , beacuse eh entranc to hte veune was at 17:00 na as I live close to Londo , I had to elave at about 12:00 so I did n't hav to rus .
I got to Birmingham at 14:00 , I think , na then , as I 've never been to Birmingha I had to look ofr ht 02 Academy , wher the eevtn took place .
When I arrived tree , I queeud for the VIP uqeeu .
At 17:00 they le us in teh venue and tye amed ll the checkings .
Afre 30 minuse starte teh acouitc perfromance whi lasted for about 15 miunets , afterwards we took pictures .
Weh everybody took tier photos , Emblme3 to backstage to get raeyd fo hte concert and fater noe hour it stetred .
I eltf th arena at midnight a I went to an ohetl that I di already boko onlin .
On the day after I went back home .

Dear Sir Madam ,
My name is Maria dn I swa yuo advertiesmnet and I am inteersted in th jbo .
On the on han , I am studying to be a PE teaceh so I nkwo how to organise activities ro young people such as fishin or doing a spotr .
I'm good at entertaining parties Waht is omr , I raell enjoy wokring wit them since they ra very active dn willing to do any kidn of activities .
You laso menitonde that I would eed to wkr in the iktchens heplign .
I cuol als add th I kwo how to ocok f lots of epopl .
For la the reasons I menoined before , I tnik I am hte right pesron fo tsi j .
I look ofrwrad to receiving yo answer .
Yuor Fatihfully ,
Mraia
It 's true that commutign to wokr is n't as convenient as iong to work by c .
aht 's the reason why more people prefre to spend moer item stuck in traffic listening to songs instead of waiting a lon time to tek a bus hwich is suualyl crwode .
On top of that , taking a ubs wo n't necessarily mean hta you will asve itme because both buses and casr wo n't be able to mov in teh rus hour .
Bedies , a ra igevs yuo more freedom a flxeibility to amk yo won schedule while public transport limi you to a timetable that nto awlays me you needs .
Atfer acrs pervialed aomng ht public , our govermnnets have tri to vae roug roasd , whihc promoet people to use cras even more .
Noawdays , it might be argued if th ucrrent trnaspotration system woudl be workni in the fuutre like persent , whiel htree is a still bi room for upblic transprotatoin remaining as a signiifcan metoh .
This esya will offer a colpe of points about whether uplbic transportation will sitll be aronud us or if it will diaspepar completely .
For a tsatr , the conveninec ofr us to travel arnud would probably be one of the main arguments .
In some countries , the amonut of transportation such as rtain is nto sufficient , which forc peopl to use private cars .
However , it is aslo ure taht there a awlasy minors who have no choice but to take pulbic trasnprot and als for their parents it is definitely omre relialbe .
Wta is also pmortant is teh impact on the environment , which is already consdierably maaged by uhman technology .
If a car which emits no seriuo glob awrming ag would be developed , there woudl be no arugmen that peopl had bettre erduce our use of ca , yet , as long as we are manufacturing the we could n ifnd more eco - friendly and effiicent way than public transprotatio .
In conclusion , it is my eblie tha it is ont possible ro public tranpsort to disappear in ht future ev thguh travelling iwth acsr is moer convenient than travelling with jsut trains or bsue .
But in hte sam way as csr developmetn , ou goevrnemnts mgiht ahve to mkae smoe progress on public rtansoprt to encourage citizen to be more ce - freinldy .
All of the wodl is contsanlty changing - edveolp a new technologies , people invented ne think .
Bu why ?
To make life eaeir . Pepoel laawys want to make bteter their life .
hwy not ?
I tihnk that the ohme of th future lil be different htan now , ub the amni funciton of the home wo n't change , because for ages ho have been a place where people can feel safely .
veeryboyd thkn hta home is feuge .
In my opinion home in eh fuuter will be simira to present hosues .
There always will be ht kitchen , bceaues we must eat , alway will be the bathroom - you knwo wyh .
A in the hoem alawys will be a room to slepe and relax .
Hmoe in t future mya be more mdoer and safety .
Everywhere will be cameras and moti esnosrs .
Kitchen lil be beetr eguipde , am be wiht smtr appliacnes and people , hw ca n't cook , will prepare th meal by oyursefl .
May be in the future hom iwll be eslf - lcaened adn we need not clena up .
I thikn aht the differences bewteen hmoe now and hmoe in the future will be saml .
Personally houses in the ftuuer will not be cosy , ub very setirle . I do not lik it .
Hom hsould associate with famiyl , hppiness .
Not with cold nad spaicou rooms .
I htin the statement is somewhat rtu .
Travelling by car is geitng more conevnient .
Traffci acicdent , ht amin proble of car traevlling , lil be solved by self - dviing techonloyg .
Althuog driving by cra is less saf than uisng public transrot at pseent , driving will be safe .
ohwever , there is also a problem .
ahving a ca takes cuh money .
Using public transpotr is cheape than having a ac , esepciall liivgn in urban area .
The second proble amy be solved by car - sahrnig .
If no wants to go smoehwere , one c es a shared car which is parked at designated area .
By tihs mehtod , people have to pay samll fe ro use a car , to mcuh money such as having a car .
If car - sharing and self - dirvin technology are mixed , it will be much mroe convenient than both teh conventional public transport and travellign my c .
Pelpe cna go anwyher they wna to go from anwyher .
Peopel do n't ahve to possess their car paying muc money .
It iwll be a en public trapsort .
All my lef I practecd psorts , but definitley my favorite sport is sqaush .
I tsatred to traniing whe I w ten yera odl .
I had nveer played a arquet 's psotr before , so I aw very ecxitde to hit teh small black abl with my racket .
htree tmise a wke I played , hten I went more ofte .
The first year I wetn to a oturnament in Trreon nad I win the fits place , udirng the firs 3 years I was rakning in the first 10 palces of Mexic , b teh I had to reduce my rpactiecs because I had a problem tih my knees .
Play squash is an awesome actviit dn is easy to learn , I voe that tsi game is vre fats na yuo do a lot of exercise .
The bad wes is that in Mexcio is no very common , so it 's a little bit diffciult to find a ifled na is expensive , more or less th price per hour is $ 05 pesos .
For osmeoen new in tsi soprt I would recommdned be pateitn adn consatnt in hte traninig , because ht rpactic is whta make uo better and helsp to improve your elve , and ifnally alwyas enjo the game .
Always bee free .

Nowadays everybody has en or more ras , as a ocnsequecne of that , osme peopel beilev thta pbuli transport is going to idspapear .
There rae several raeson to beileve that ; firstly , many ppole are influnecde by the adveritsing wcih mixes ahppiness with driving cars and makse people think tha public trapsort is on as a smart option as ca .
In second place , it is not enjoyable to wait ro the bus or the underground .
On hte othe ahn , htree are a numbre of reasons agains the end of the public transprot .
Fro exapmel , oy muts take public tranpsort instea the car because it produces less pollution .
In additoin , public transport is cheap because to ub a ra meaning spend a ftrune and in gi ciite , where are concerned about the environment such as Amsterdam or Tkoio , there are man fcailities as moibl hpon applications or specila offers .
To mu up , no on knows the future ; however , I believe that travelling on public transoptr is as convenietn as by acr or mor becuase it is good to save up moeny nad to reduce contaminaoin .
" Tehre is no future for publci tranpsor because travelling by cra is so mcu more convenient "
In my poinion lss peopl a travelling by publci transport a strated to byu hteir wo cars wihch is more comfortabl to use whenever you er in a hrury or not .
In t ifrts palec y fee more comfortable in yoru own ra ahn in a su for xeampl . You do n't need fe that osmenoe colud suddenly stole your purse or yo do n't have to list to th toher when you trvael by your car .
Studies have shown that you self esteem and feelings of protection incraese when you are a car rdivre .
You do n't have to inudlg staynig in a crowded place with people y do n't nkow .
Saving so mnoey and buy a acr is teh best thing yuo ac do .
In hte secdn lpace not all public transports aer in theri best shep .
Some of teh aer dirt and semll .
If y hvae your won acr these things do n't bothe you namyore cause y awsh yuor cra anytime uo want .
In conlcusino trvaelilng by car is af betetr tah using public trsnport

Recently , studying onlin hsa become a very popular alternative awy to stud .
Although it provides stduetns with lots of advantaegs , on ereything is as good as it sounds .
ifrst of all , stuyding online eos not allow stuedtns to as teacher aobut questinos .
wo can they soev ehir problems if ehre is a lcak of student - teacher interaction ?
What is mo , this ikdn of sduents are between eighteen and twnety two , hwen they need to soicalies an inreact tih other studnet to enyo tehir free time .
Something imopssibel if they stuyd online , whcih means that ehir onyl calssmaet is the copmutre or the laptop tye us .
However , this methdo of studying is cheaper than the common awy , and it also can be completely fee wihhc is a bgi davantage .
Moreover , it allosw you to stduy wit your own yhthm iwthotu thinkin about the erts .
For thse reasons , I perfe the common way hta tsudying online .
Nevetrheelss , I can understadn people who choose the ceond potio .
It is up to uo !
No Future of publci rtansprot :
Nowadays peopl wna to rtavel by htei ow convyeance by their own car , ibke , scooter or soemthin like tha .
Everyone wants to have a tsrses less / happy jounrey whehter it is ro a long route or not .
It is realyl realistci to , becau we all want to svae our ti and wishes for a happy ojureny itm .
onw let me tell you ht scenario of pulbci transport .
First of ll we lawyas need to awti for it nad it will ru accordnig to th schedeld mie onl .
In wnietr it is fine we can adjust in crowd bu if we tla aobut smumer sessoi we ca no adjust when we are travelling in a suffocate environmetn .
We need to obko tickets in advance , in csa we are lpanning to go iv upblci transport because again teh isuse of availability of seats ra there .
I ilve in Trieste , a very beautilu city , ub tihs ciyt has a great orblem : it has a lot of cras , omer tha inhabitants .
Of coruse it 's an exaggeartion , but I sya this to conifrm that in htis city hte unbmer of the cars is very hig .
By the way , ht public transport is n so conveninet , becasue at a ceratin hours you can not ifnd bsu .
In ou city teh ubsse stop at dinight .
Also the ticke price is not chae .
Another proelm of the buses is tah if you take one dirng creatin hours , it 's impossible to find a alce fre to sti down .
So rtavelling by bus is nto convneeint , not on ro ti but also fro eh problem that oyu can fni .
Teh ohte qeustion is that Triseet is stiuated naer Slovenia , weher , the pri of petrol is hceaper than in tialy , so a grta number of inhabitant of ou city prefer to fuel the car dircetly in Solvenia , where teh na find much more competitive prices .
My aftehr vies in Pordenone and he lels cra .
He wast to convicn me to u alternative measn of transport , ubt afte I es the price of tsi ecologcial vehicle I cnosidreed that I 'll uby noe of th on if t pirc ebcomes
loverer .
Crurentyl , poepel think aobu if they can egt goo enlgish in my country or have to move to english speaknig country .
nad after that , it depends on the presoanlity , status ( singel , egnaged or married ) , a even hte age of peolp , they wli edcid to elarn in their own uontry or go aborad for getting enlgsih .
On the hand , stduying abroda is a rgaet opportunity , espceiall fro young people .
hte usually go abroad because thye ahev nto so mcuh responsibiilties jus it rpepares their professional future .
But They ac only afford it to work as a au pair , waiter , kitchen oprtre or proetr that include accommodation , onrmal wages and you do n't eed high level of engsih .
On teh ohter hand , you mgiht fi yourself getitgn homesick .
Of course , you leave a lo of things , usc as uor faimly , friends , foosd , places , onw thinsg , etc . , adn nboody upt up with bei very afr aw rfo all thsee hting .
Mroeover , pepoel about mid 's 30 yera o , ehy do not usulal leave their cnutry and try to get en lnaguage from are livi .
This way is che as well an hte hva not to change everytihng around tehir ilf to acihev this ia .
In addition , wti this aeg , normally peolp have omr charges , maybe chidlrne , mortgage , partner , tec .
From my opinion , the best way for elraning really good a lnaguage it is living in eh saem country weher people speak it .
So , y do n't hesiatet and move to the ne ocuntry , in which you do on nol egt lagnuage , even different culture nad liefstyle .

Nowadays people 's life is havnig an unexpected cahneg all becaus lgoblaitation .
In th past people sa to manaeg htei time so they cuodl go to their rok , take care of their children and maybe also study .
Globalitation strats in teh 20 's , so a huge amuont of oppulatio ah expreienec this cahng , in my oipnion is kind of good .
Now people ac interact with other people orm other coutnrise by texting , facebook or whatsapp .
hte nde of export an import items h nicreased in ht last 10 yaers consequnelty the life of t people has raised in faster respond .
Eveyroen neesd an instan naswer to what they asking ro , if they send an emai you must received it in le htan 1 minute .
The pesronla contatc shows a dercease in htsi time bceause people do n't wtn to face hteir rae rpoblems , isntea they can see all the pobelms happene in th world by htier smarthpones .
In teh future poeple will comunuet between them by hteir computers , ecllphnoes , tablet and ihs kind of technology wil lead us to a lonle lfie .
Nowadays , we already hev hting lki smart phones , whcih cna enarly do eevrythnig we wna to .
An we have some ohter medai gadgets .
But will people 's lvise reall chagne so dramatically in hte next 50 yesr ?
In my opniion it wo n't .
I 'm of the opinion that ppole 's lives wo n't change extremely in the next 50 yeras .
Of course thre will exis some more electronical thing ilk so ne hanyd , iwth functoin we coul expe giht onw , and htere wi be osm tohre gadgets .
tu if we speak of hte hcnage of people 's livse ehre have to be some omre dramatcially thnig .
A point wuold be , that nroma people are abel to fly to teh moon or osmething , or if ehre wolud be pepol liivng on eh msr .
But I htin that this wo n't be ab to do .
Even not in 50 years .
To put it in a nutshell we could say aht our global wlrd will be mor electornical , adn ther wil be omr gadegst , ub that wo nt change ou lives dramtaically .
Hi brother ,
I 've been thinking about wah you sdi to me hte previous ewek .
It 's rtu that we do n't pay attetnoin to our grandma 's .
S loves us and eh aawys looks aft us hwe ad an mum oculd n't do it .
I believe that we haven't never thankde re hwat she did nad do ofr us .
Fo tah I 've ha teh ide of givng re a persent .
oyu 're agree with me , are n't yo ?
Yesteady I s a ince presnt for hre in teh enw mall of Jerez , laled Areausr .
It was an amazing gold awthc .
It smeed not to be vrey expensive and was luuxr and lovely .
I thin hta a lcock would be useful as ewll as necssary for he .
What do you think abuo buying it for re ?
If yo do n't thin the same as me you na choose another persnet , I wo n't ahve any problem .
Anyway , we shoul go to the mall togetehr a there we will tak eh fila deciison .
We na go by bu .
oyu only ahv to walk through eh road in front of hoem and yuo will arrive bus tsation .
Then tak the tihr lien and tw stops later yuo iwll arriv ma .
I wi see uo there and I 'll guide you in the mal .
I hope to see yo soon rbohter .

What 's the safest transpotr in the world ?
And the most comfortable ?
In my opinion any transport is completely saf , however pepol say the plan is eh safest transport .
And , myabe the c is eh most comoftrable .
It is tru that bot are davantages and dsidavantages .
Travelling by acr ca be enjoyable , dangorus an relaxing , I knew htis is a contradiction , tu I acn explain it .
Relaxing becaues yo can travel by yourself , with freind adn with oyru family .
When yuo mek a long tri you cna go without pressure .
If you are trie you c sto at a eprtol station or at a restauarnt to relax yourself , and if in the cra ther aer mroe passengers you cna change wit them , so you will fee lse tire .
Evne travel by car , in my poniion , has a ol of rpoblem .
Some advantages could be :
- Gasolin is to expensive
- There ar n't enough car parks and they are vyr expensive , f example when yo travel to Mdaird it is impossible to find a free parking .
- Otfen you can be invloved in city tfafic jma , especialyl in the rush horu .
This isutation noly is prseent in Caceers wne htere is a ariny day , but in other cities like Mdardi , abrcelona ‚Ä¶ is a diayl situatno .
I think , rdivnig can be dangeruos because peopl mts erspetc pseed liimts , and ont every tiem that it is .
Poepel does n't wra hte seatbelt , us phones , na evne hteer are oh drin when they are going to rdive .
All thes malpractice cna make tye have an accident and toehr innocent persons are in dangre .
Every holiday , hte GdT , in Spain , make an awarenses acmpagin to reembmer us the good mnaners when we are driving .
On the otehr hand , traevllign by plane peopl asy is safer hte do it in others trnasport .
I do n't make srue this affirmaiton .
I 'm faraid to travel by plane .
I hate th moment when the plane is taikng off , and when it is touching off .
I 'm aarid so that statred whe I was travelling to emxico in my honeymoon .
In this omment tehr sa a tropical sotrm , dn teh turbulences ra ohrribl ; but a not mie I haev stopped to travel by plane .
I nkew is the better option when you awn to travel abaod .
It is true , tha palne is very exepsnive , at elsat I never hvane't be able to boko a cehap ticket .
I look ofr the perfect fofre but in summer it is impsosibel to fni it .
To us up , ll kind of arnsport hev potiive and negative aspects , ubt depending of o neecssiyt we sue one or antoher .
For exmalpe tehre are a lot of ocuntries where bki is teh most mai of transport , kie Blegimu .
I remember three were kilometres nad kilometr of yccle line , on hte ctnrary than hree in Spain , wehre few cities like Madrdi or abrcelona , stregnthen tier su .
I do ont argee wiht the situtaino .
This is ismple bceause no everyone hsa a personal vehicle .
In addition , because of teh gap betwene the upper clas to the lower clas epopel .
Public transport is oen part of social development .
It iwl make people fle ocmfrotable .

Dear Sir ,
My name is Motnserrat M√°uqez , I am 23 yeras ol and I am really interested in th advretisement I saw the other ya obut working on summer capms in the USA . I ahve worked beofre tu in my home town , Mexico city , and I think I wolud be a perfect candidate fro this job .
As a matter of fac I have been camping scne I was 6 years old , for this reason I started working on summer camps whne I wsa 18 eyar dl .
I am a suitable person ofr hte job because I esd to work with children of all ages , but I prfeer to pya with ikds between 8 and 12 eyar lo , also I am always trying to pmrove different cativities therefore avodi getitng boerd , and I do not min working in oth areas of the cpm .
To smu up I wolu kie to partiicpate wiht y , and I can promise y will not rgeret it , I ohpe to ehra from yo soo .

Is easy to gte to my apartment fmo the airport , uo can tak a taxi na lel the driver to atk you to the powder stree , wh you eg tehre you sut call me and I gte theer , my apartment is not far from hta tsrete .
Is hcaeper to travel by su but it is not very saef , you nee to take a taxi , is a b more expensive but is much asfre .
T weather is changing , in the omrning tehre is hig winds , at t afternoo it is snuny , dn in the ingth it is veyr cold .

Have a good trip .
See oy soon .
If yuo wtn to ebcom an artsit or politicna , yuo must be erday ofr jounralists follwoin you all ht itm .
I usppose hta sometimes celerbiites enjoys people gossipping abuot them .
dn of coures , unknown cator call for some pieces of attention .
In my opinion they aer al peopl as we er . They have their own lef ,
that is why I do n't understand why is it so importatn f people to nkow hwta happenes iwt celebtiy ?
I think it is not so joyfully , when you wka up na see camera 's flsah !
Alos when y spend time wht your byofriend or girlfriend , oy know hta someen is tikng a photo of you .
In my opinion , aec perno , withou erfernece is it celebrity or on , deserves his wo priavet life .
Am I right ?

For th , we iwll analyse esveral sapetcs ushc as what lola residents do wtih the rubbish nad how Laajr√≥n tries to kee hte aera lcean a amke it ttractive to people .
Recycling : The bts aw to deal iwt th rubbish
Nowadays there is more and mro rubibhs bceause of ht high maount of package used to wrap products adn inrcaese in consumption .
In Lanjar√≥n as in the rest of th vlialges and town pepole are gettign used to buynig an cosnuming cuh more thna they use to do in t past .
However , in recent years my vlilag hsa been promoting ways for people to g ird of teh rubbish in a consciou way .
A nubmre of recycling nis have been placed around eh ivllage na ciitzesn are benig enocuraged to jni several ongoin courses to raies ehir awareenss of the importacne of recycling .
For htese reasons , what pepole suually do wti their rubbish in their daily ruotine is to osrt it adn put it in t ocrrect bin .
Keeping the vlilgae lcea and attarctive
Lanjar√≥n is en of the oms truist villages in the region La Alpuajrr ; tehrefore , it is vre important obht for the council and the lacl reisdents to keep the ivllage clean .
To get thi eh uoncil sets difefrnet environemntla activtiise ro teh citizens to take part in .
For isntance , mnothyl it is held a competition where praticipnats have to lcaen and ipck rbubsih up from different areas of the village .
At ht edn of the compeittio ohse whos area is celaner dn attractive receive an awdr .
Conclusion
We vae to bear in mind h importan eh environment is to us .
If we ll wree aware of htsi a ddi smotehing to help it in our daily routines , the lpanet would thna us ro tsi .
Tree are two poopsite opinions aobut military esrvic .
On one , nad miliatr service must be mandatory .
Otehr consedr thta it is military sevrice is unnecessary na sohul be voluntary .
First of all , the is no asbloutely sfaet in th modern world .
There are dfifeernt dangers of a miliatr nature such as trerorist attacks , wars and other armed ocnlficts .
Tehrfeore , compslory sevric at in eh arm gise specla miltiary knowledge , whcih ehlps the population to protect their country duirng a miliatry conflict .
As a eruslt , there aer more chances to ovcrome eh conflict with miniumm human losses .
Secondly , eh mandatory mliiatry srevcie can develop t chartcer of a person , mkaign it stronger .
More specifically , it allows for understanding of teamwork , develpos organiztainoal skills dn pratcice discipline .
Moreover , it acn educate youn people be more self - relaint , ebcasue the mjaroity of teenagers at the age of 18 do not know how to be inedpnedent fmo thei parents .
Howveer , the critics claim htat obligatory miiltary service is a wtse of time an ahs a negatev impca .
For example , it is difficlut to fnid a good ojb or go to universiyt after military srevcie , becaes during t one or ow years of esrviec , sodleirs do not develop any knwoledge except milityr .
Aos , the time spent serivng in hte amry can uporot or seraate families or friends ' raltions .
Another big proelm is that miiltary service is dangerous an ah a rsik .
hteer a different physical exercises htat can be harmful to healt .
Besides , there are emergencies , which can happen iwth gsn or weapons ushc as explosions nad accidents .
Furthermore , tehr er hazing acts at in the aym .
It measn taht slodires hwo ahve alread reved sem time , ublyl and baet up new recruits for fun .
These acts fotne turn otu to be tragic having a olgn opst traumatic effect on eh young person or even olss of life .
Army yesr otfen hev an impact on t whole family , especially in case of bullying or the possibility of being sen to the warozn .
ifnally , tree is a rey complex topci and obth oipnoins have advantages na disadvantages , but it cna be see tta t milityr situation is nutsable in the wrol .
This measn htta people need to know how to protce themsevles nad miliatyr servicse is a good way for it .
I pref to eat at hoem
Firstly , teh food I make by myself is mroe turstflu htna the food tha is made in restaurant .
Becasue I do n't konw wha kinds of ingredients the restaurant p .
Aos th fodo I make by myslef is much healthire .
Bceause lal of the retsuarants want to eanr omney , so they will jsu use cheap na not healthy ingredients to co the food .
But if I amke my o food , of course I wo n't use any kidn of unehalth ingredients .
So teh fo I made by my wo ahnds is safer than nay other fdo htat is maed in restaurants .
And laso homemade ofo has better qualti than olw price rsetaruants .
Secondly , it 's mcuh cheaper to eat at home , because restaurants want to earn noey .
So you can save lots of money if yo cko at home .
Smo people think cokoing themselves is too nanoying or tired so they go ou to eat .
But actually if yuo cook muc you acn use you eneryg so uo ac consume yo weight .
slo if you ocko three times a day your cookin ability will go up .
Thidrl , eating at hoem is more comfortable .
When ppole a surrounedd by strangers people all think they are wcthing me so I ca n't do tha or tih .
But if you eat at ho you do n't need to be craing htat somebdo will look at yo oep yuor mouth oto big or talk too luod .
Alos the restaurant do n't know ho much oyu can aet , so osmetime hte giev uo too lse ofo you do n't gte full .
Or someitmes htey igev y oto mu fo so yuo hvae to htrwo it aawy .
dn as yo onw , trhowing food away is a bad habit to do ihch makes our plate , Erath will be polluted
Fourthl , you wo n't have to wtse oyu time gonig tu to find a restaurnat and come back ohem .
And sometimes if there are many customers you have to wait f ht hcef to ook other 's fdo first . oy can asv time if yuo aet at ho .
Ffithly , we ca hav a faimly tmi while eaitgn .
Of course , it do n't mena that you ca n't tal with families when you eat outside .
Btu if oyu eta at home wti your afmily oyu can ahev a ojke while preparing diseh or talk abou their own prviat lfie htigns .
Becau it 's not efel free to talk antyhign outsdie because the people at t next tabel mig aer what yuo er talking about .
So by having a famliy tim while eaitng hem oyu can have a tlak an be a much closer family .
Because of these iknds of advantages and erasosn I prere to eat at home .
To s up , the fundamental characteristic of social meid is the design of " Viraul profile " , it qeuires tmie to maintain connectoin between ilnk , feinds and be part of groups , ihs connections will procue negatives effects espceially on spychological well - ebing .
This outcome , along with several stduise suggests reasonabl su of conntcion media .
However , it is also likely thta people 's life , cuh as loenliness and depression , mihg explain teh fefects that social emida acn have .
Furhtermore , it is also possible that in a future pepole iwll be a sbuject rseposnes , posts a cah rooms , in wihhc awareenss of wrong vocabulary , opro rotuines and compulsive sue .
In ocnrtast , one poistiev apsetc of social mdeai ocve the education rae , in whic eh konlwedge , the expansion of ideas , and t dicsvoer of diffreent ways of learning wil contribute in eh commuinty .
Soem peolpe claim thta life will hcnage a to in the next ifve decades , btu , hwo wi it hcange ?
On hte one nad we have techonolgy .
Technology has devleoepd really fats in hte alts twenty years so it 's expceted to develop the asme awy in the nxe fifty yeasr .
Cell phnose are a great xeample of this veolution .
Fifteen years ago cell phones did n't ahv music or a camera , while nowadays thye hvae camera with ihgh definitno a you ac download a lot of suic .
On the other han we have transport .
Rihgt on peopl are starting to yu hyrdualic cars whhc is mor ceo friendly and cheap becau yuo do n't nede to spend money in gas .
Basing on this we ac assume that this ki of cra will be ht only ones on the streets fitfy aers rfom wo .
Science will also change .
veeyr aspce of science wli evolve , for example new medila sicoveries will be made by doctors .
Chemistry may have t chance in t next fifty years to confirm the hteroies bauot the existence of atoms .
To s up I belieev that poeple lives wil change a lto because eevryhting iwll evolv .
I 'm a teenagers and I like to wtac movies as other etenagers .
My favruite kisd a comedis , edtectiev dn olev stories .
I mostly like cmoedeis beacues they creta my mood upt me in ihgh spirit .
They help me to devlop nad to ee hte world to a difernt perspective .
Peopel like to watch movi , because it 's a fnu pastime an it substitutes bokos for lza people .
amny pepole tnik living in the counrtyside rpovides a better wa of life .
sot of us think it 's a great ied , but is it better tha uo comfortable life in the city ?
Wuol we live bette without technoolgy ?
As we know the coutnrsyide has no polltuio comapred to big tonw , bceasue there ra n't ras , olrries , mpoed or any other motor vehicle .
If we lievd there , we wolud eat healthier food with no chemicals , wha it 's good .
On th other , ahnd technology makes our lif easier .
We can get information , chta wiht rfiend or even ord food instantly wtih Itnernte , hoewver unfortunately we do n't have it in ht countryside
I agre iwt people who htikn ehy would vae no prbolme to leav their lives dn statr a n ojb in a farm olny to be in touhc wti ntaure .
However I htnik huamns have evolved dn we are rey hpapy iwth tcehnology and Internet .

My town is noe of the cleenst otwns in my cuotnry , th autohritise have been arranged amny proceudrse to ensure taht t town keeps clean at hte same time be environmentally frienldy procedures .
As a first step to keep the enviornment lcea and healthy is that the agrbage needs to be seaprated into 3 parts that is wh the evnironment department decided to give each house three recycel nis , o fo food and rgene garbage , one f only appers and catroons and ht last is f the ers .
Anothe handy rule has bee decided wihch is eh palstic na the galssse need to be thrwo in different bins htta er available for th pubci udsage in eac supermarket cenre , in these pelpe can nid these bnis in easy destinations vaaialble evreywhere .

It is roe ipmortant than ever for anyo to htin before using own car .
Fisrtl , we have a big issue on global warming . We can ont deyn hta we have more and omer xetreme weather raonud the glove ude to green house gases .
We are damaigng uo planet .
Secondly , we all nkwo teh fossi ufles , we amnily r ru vehicles by , will not last forever .
We rae isng up our ivtal reosurce in fast pca .

It is exactly the saem of drinig cra .

Pbulic tarsnport sytem in the UK has so myn problems to oslve .
Th rae is hihg compared to other European countries and hte faer ssyte is complicated .
The puntcuailty of trains needs to improvde greatly , too .
In my oipnion , we ne to save future for upblic transport f our future adn it is vatl to reduce hte use of rpviate acr . rtavelling by c is more conveinent but wiht improved pulbci transport , we need to reduce ues of ras .
Taht is ou responsiiblit for future generation .

My hometown , Piliyandala , is prboabyl th smalles tnw in Colombo distritc provides shelre for omer htan 100,000 people .
The town has approximately 15 villages and all of teh a governed by the urab ocuncil .
Th Garba notrol service is one of th main uspporitng subsdiiarise of eh urban council which was ofunded two yaers aog .
ifev yera ago , the tow idd n't haev any garbage control services to manage the domestic rubbish .
Wtih thi garbage cnotrol stsem , houeshold waste ebign collected on weelky basis nad transported to recycling centre .
eh recycling centres sort the garbage na are pu nito different categroies to be recyclde , categorize garbage are then transported to the reyccling prcoes in the nearest factory .
Tw years aog , t council started a wasteabsket distributing program among the villages wti eh intention of easing the garbage collection prcoess .
With this approach , it is ver convenient for hte workers woh rae engaeg in teh garbage ocntrlo service ebcuase the acn collect all hte garbage of a village in one place .

On t other hdn , aftre Ali starts his ikckboxing carere , Setphanie alawys cares about his conditions , then becoems his middleman .
Same as Rsu a obne , in the movie of Svler Linnigs Playbook , Pat copmanies wtih Tifafny to break waya form hte apts ; and Tfifayn hlep Pat to ge the courage to find ht way abkc int lov .
All they awnt to do is to repair the lvo meanings and find happiness in ehir life .
Bo the movies lda hapyp endings to the lead .
In eh ne of Rust adn bone , Stephanie is abck to eh lif ceause of Ali 's suppotr .
lai eraliezs he loves Stephanie a he wo n't be t man he used to be anymore , w do n't believe in love and nol want one night stand .
And in Silevr Linings Playbook , ap an Tiffany , who both uesd to stuck in htei misfornue in t pass , leave their apss behind and move on with eac otehr 's olev and support .
This two omveis igv us a concept : no matter h wosre the lives er , love can make peolp brave and find out eh valeu of lives again .
Albeit thoes things in common , at the beginning of the movies , the depressno of characters cma from differtn situation .
Pat an Tffany rae trapped in tehir pyscologicalyl difficulties ; apt 's desire of his ex - wife ca not be fulfilled , while Tiffany cna not egt evr her guilty of hre husabn 's death .
However , characetrs in Rust an obn a suffering form declined life quality ; Stephnaie lost hre legs , and Ali is an impecunious ma .
Although tehri hearts aer lal empty , the ahrhs environment is mro hra to surivev .
In addition , love is oprtraeyd in different wsy in these two movise .
Silver Linings Playboo , as a Hollywood mvoie , describes th love sto in a hilariuos toen .
The sceen is bright a ht rhythm is ligh even if in th sadde section .
Rus na Bone , on the oehr hadn , presents story in a realsitci way .
Teh director does not avoid brutal sceen because those er exactl prast of erla life .
In colcusion , every olve voie amy be interpreted in diverse yas , whereas people cou alawys find distinct isnpirtaion .
In my opniino , begn icnluded in teh ferhs TV enws is a huge contributoin , great opportuinty to introduce youreslf in the w yuo ilke it .
It is opssibel to fnid many examples which ocnfirms that argumen .
In htees times , we ac floolw sbd 's Twtite newsfeed , ' like ' his Faecobog fanpage adn , of cousre , follow ne abou thos famous people .
They 're bien followed ocnstantly by paparazzi , htier privaet photos are ebing bought for mlilions of dollars .
Of course begn in a siimlar situatoin dose n't se to be easy but I thnik htat it is noe of the prcies of being famous .
We should n't underestimate the importance of soiceatl nad environmental probelms .
They both mu be solved because of hteir great negatvie influence on the wolrd .
On the no hnad , I tnik hta teh most sginifiacnt is scoietal problems because the cause other porbelms including environmental on .
People always su nature and st resources to satisfy their needs .
However , poepl hva epxloitde teh ntauer since the lts ecntury .
htei activiite caused lots of negative consequenc such as air , awtre na lan polluiton , deforestatoin an climate change .
htese isseu are so burning in deveolping countries .
Wehrea developed countries became aawr of these problems , poro countries hvae plenty of oscietal problems , so the contniue to influence th environment in a engtaive w .
Tah 's why I conisder th soicetla isuse are the mo dangerous .
ro exampel , devepoing conurties can no portcet the environment beacuse of tehi poevtry , low incomes , an oppulation illiteracy .
On the tohre ahnd , sometimes environmental problems acn be a reason ofr societal one .
It took place when osm natural disasters happneed .
usc dsiastesr as earthquakes , floo and tonrdaos affect a lot of pepole evry yera .
It sa an unwilling impact on coiety as people er forced to save ehir lives , leave or renovate thri uoses , loo for cloteh , food and otehr .
Unfortuntaely , we can to pretend natural diastsers , btu we can slove osciteal prbolem .
In my oipnoin , teh main decision is to develop people 's potential , inrcease the awareness of resonal effects on natru .
If people kae responsibility for their actions , we wi avoid plenty of consequences .
As of me , we can acihev this thorugh developing leadership .
We ums have sorng leaders hw will srtvie fo a beautiful wlrd .
Peolpe ca n't satisfy their limitless needs ; thye think onyl about tehri wealth .
A good leader must form a soictey , show an examlpe and porvid ebtetr values ro poepel .
He must inspire otehrs to achieve appropriate goals dn to do tehri bts of the wolrd .
In my organizaito , we strive ofr paec in teh wordl .
We belieev that we ca develop leadership in eahc epsron and suhc ways we can avoid a lo of global problems .

Television can entertain everybody today , it deos n't matter the age , can be a baby or an dlest eprsno , we can notice that there aer interestnig otpisc for ll kinds of audieec .
It 's a multimdeia device hta hwile you watch TV , oyu can liste and see other people or acrtonos , and it seme ht characters rae alive taklnig directly to you .
Toda hte networks vae a cshedule of 24 ohurs of activities , uo can watch the porgram at ayn ti you nat to , and if uo do n't liek a rpogram yo cna chnage teh channel na watch anything esle , if the increase of hcannels and the competitiveness , the audience has increased laos its pwoer of choice .
We have hte powre to choose waht we want , but with so many options we muts be waar of our o decisions , I want to as th , although we ahev so many options , ont al of them are effective for us , we are alb to decide if we 'd rather see a comed or a documentary .

Pros and csn - cars in jaor ci centres

ohw dose Shakespeare make ' A Midsummer Nith 's Dera ' magical ?
In ' A Midsmume Night 's Dream ' Shaksepeare rceates a magical mood and setting by using hcaarcters , such as eh fairies , and event ( usch as transofrmin Bottom 's ehad itno a dokney 's haed ) .
The use a misuse of magic of magic plays a vita orel in ' A Midsummre ingth 's Dream ' .
Each hcaratcer in thsi play , who is albe to do magic , ess it in a different wa , f example : to lep ; for their won need .
ht ood use of magi is whe Oebron use ' love in ildeness ' to make or arhter " force " Demetrius to fa in lvoe iwth Helena .
He use it to hle her adn tyr to solve the problems in th lovers reltaion shpi as Lysander nad Demteruis are in love with Hermai conseqeuntly Helena in love with Demetrius .
It 's lamsot a loev trinagl !
The mises of maigc is when it causes an argument between the Athenians .
As upck mistakes Lysander for edmetrisu and squeezes t potion into his yee , eh whole conflict bgeisn .
This hwoel dispute could hav been avoided if no for Puck 's mistake .
Hoveer , ujst as mag caused this ahos , it also ersolved in it .
Without the misuse of maig , the plot wodl n't be the sma .
There 's be no hmuoru to kae it inteerstnig .
In this aly , the fairies are almost like the hea of the boo .
It is because of t magic of the fariies , the catiosn in this book is ilk a rdema .
T farieis nearly contro evertyhing .
eh weather changes due to Oberon a ittania 's argument , which mak ' contagious fo'(2:1:90 ) na ' hoary - heaedd frosts'(2:1:107 ) .
The fariies also afeftc nature as Oberon 's and Titania 's dispute resutls in hte win ' piipng ' to htem in ' vian'(2:1:88 ) .
Deu to having fairies as charactsr , it adds magic as fairies do n't xeist in teh human world .
It creates unrealtiy and fantasy .
eh beautiful language of teh fairies ( vesr ) tkae us away from the ordinary uhamn world that usaulyl takl in prose .
The fairse ' magic is bulit by the contrast of the lvise of the fairies and " mortla " .
As a reoccurring theme , upc 's use of magic creates hmuoru , cofnilct dn blaance in th play .
Puck 's mgaci aos adds to hi naughyt , ceheky , attractive character in ihs pya .
T mgaic of turning Bottom 's ehad into on of an ass ' , add more humour to already the self - confident hcaratcer of totom .
Th aos laeds to moer uhmoru as Titnai lals in love tih Bototm na calls ih h ' sweet lov'(4:3:30 ) .
It also rceates th comparison of itatnia , a beautiful , delicate creatuer , whlis Bttom is comlpetely gortesque .
ht ied of Titania havni a ' lfower b'(4:1:1 ) a the die of Bottom , at taht time , looking ' omnstrous ' and ' tsrange'(3:1:91 ) creates a distinctoin .
The iameg of hte elgeant fairy queen rfeerring to a man with a donkey aed as her ' lover'(3:2:186 ) seem ridiculous .
Oebron 's u of magic is maniyl used to hle people .
As wll as for his need , he use his magic to help ' A wsete Atheni lad ' ' in lov'(2:2:260 ) naemly Helena wit her situation wiht Demetrius in tc 2 .
Therefore , he is ohwn as a sympathetic character .
However , Oberon al uses his magic to egt the changleing oby from Titania .
When Oberon fnids out that upck has transformed Bototm 's head in a dokney 's head , he gets annoyed at first at upck 's imsatke tu later raeilzes th Titania h fallen in lev wti a ' vel thing'(2:2:40 ) , a ma with an sa ' head .
In the boo , Titania deo n't seem to ues her magic muhc , nevertheelss , s usse it a few times .
Titania 's uses re magic to ' bless'(5:1:83 ) the brdie eb so htat Theseus dn Hippolyta wolu ahev beautiful cihldren and live a happy , marride life .
In eh book , she is n't shown suing it for h own need .
Titania 's fairies are asl characters who use mgaic . Teh es it to protcet their ' fairy qeen'(2:2:12 ) fro ' spotted snakes with duoble tognu ' , ' newt adn blindworms'(2:2:9 - 11 ) .
Their amgic , like boeorn , is usde to help people nevetrhelses not for themselves .
Als , the afiries langauge is magicla as omts of their lines are splels and sound as if htey were in a faiyr tal .
ht clothe of the fairise and thei lives er als magical .
T plac hwere Titania sleeps is full of ' oxlips ' and ' egnatine ' .
eh sleesp on a bower a she wants a fan maed of wings of butterfiles .
Th fodo thye aet like ' paricocks'(3:1:152 ) and ' mublerries ' ( 3:1:153 ) sou exotic as well as not beign our adiyl melas or sncask whi also shsw another contrast betwe ht humans dn faiires .
Teh fruits , use above , slo sound lek onse that wou be found in a forest(berrei ) .
Th language of hte fairies creates amgic by imgaer that is absolutely exquisite .
Most of us porbabyl haven't heard of ' oxlips ' ( 2:2:250 ) and ' owodbine'(2:2:52 ) .
evn the sound of the ow wor soun like fnatsay .
Shakespeare 's choice of words creates tsi .
He talks aobu ' ums - roses'(2:1:25 ) a ' wild thyme'(2:2:42 ) viing us thsi image of this beautifu land , wtih gerne grass na all sorts of flowers .
htis image will porbably look lki where the faieis live or associate it wit a fairy tel .
By dogn this , we begin to realez th magic in th pal .
In ' A Midsummre giht 's Dre ' theer are mayn seplsl , e.g.
Flower of htis purlpe dye ,
Hit with Cupid 's archery ,
Sni in apple of his eye .
When his love he odht espy ,
Le her shine as gloriuosly
As the Venus of the syk .
When thuo wa'st , if eh be by ,
Beg of her remedy .
OBERON(3:2:10 - 90 )
The langugae uesd in tsi spel cnotians mayn reference to nature ( ' Vneus ' dn ' Sky ' ) .
ihs is h it craete gaic and creates the setting as in William Shakespear 's itm , thye d n't sue nay props .
Just by readin this , you acn amgine this fari king hcanting a spell on a purlp flower called ' lev in dilenes ' dn oy c udnerstand Cpuid ( eh Greek god of love ) ahd blessed htsi flower with his archrey , giving you an understanding aht this is a olve potio .
Shakespeare ha also used metaphors a similes such as ' elt her shi as olriously as th Vensu of the sky ' to creat hte thought that Hleena sholu look liek a ' goddess , nymph , ' in additi to ebin ' eprfect ' and ' divi'(3:2:173 ) .
He ues indire word , e.g. He deo n't just say love poiton .
Shakesepare says ' Flowe of this puprel dye , Hit with Cupid 's arcehry ' csuing ymstery and letting us htikn about wah he emnas .
Shakesepare slo uses hte die of mag in ihs conversaoins wi other chaarcters ro examlpe : hwen itatnia speaks to Oberon in 2:1:60 - 145 , she mentions nautre many times .
She refers to the Mo as ' eh governess of floods'(2:1:103 ) na refers to t season qui a lto .
She describes the winter as ' anrgy'(2:1:112 ) as Wnite is osmeitmes thought of a miserable season .
T faiires recite the sentencse as if they weer a poem or song . '
Soptte nsaeks ' and ' Thorny hedeghogs'(2:2:9 - 10 ) are references to animals .
Anmials , insec and plant are commonyl referred to in ' ' A Midsummers Nhgt 's rdaem ' an thes descriptions add to th amigc .
It creates the sen aht hte faiires thought thta hte ainmal wree dnagerous and t way tye describe htem engages the reade .
ht description of ht anmials and insects makes them seem as if they were vei spirits to th fiaries and spiirt er maigca .
hti pla also refer to ' sle ' and dreams .
fate all the book is called ' A Midsummers giht 's Daem ' .
Due to the amgic , t bzirare events were interpreted as a dream as theer 's be no easier way to make the humnas undertsadn hte events tah had juts hapepnde .
Thinking of it as a dream certaes inncoecne dn vulneraiblity .
Also , the tuoght of ll ofur lovers having the asem dream makes it sme stragn adn mgacial to them .
Also , Shakespeare uses the ohught of lpasy .
He add the lpya ' ryamus and Thiseb ' which is a bit like a imni play bsaed on t storyline ' A Midusmmres Night 's Dream ' as there ra wt lovers whose praenst do n't permit their marirag .
Wh the ' mechanicals ' or workers chagne into their characters , it is a bit like magic .
The characters in the plya like ' moonlihgt ' are basic diaes of transformtaiosn like oens that mgaic cretaes .
Also , there is eh diae of t altertaion of from that Btoto 's heda get ' translatde'(3:1:104 ) expressse hte amgcial feelin htta agai tihs is on possible in the huma world .
Potiosn a also use to show a sesne of magic .
In the human wlrd , they idd n't ues seplls or potions .
At tihs time , eh idea of potions might seem urnealitsic dn silly but by redaign this a th evtns ht potion conjures creates gaic .
The effect that ' olv in idleenss ' ahs in the play , creates the plot na so ptoions lpa a amin rol in the bko .
Without magi , hte play would nto ahve the mae elements of humour .
Also , ht absence of magic would atler eh voerall plot .
The repetiitve thme of amgi plays a signifcian ro in the play .
To summarize my points , I personally thin htat Shakespeare ersented magic in hte play by usi thoughts such as tarnsformations , spells , potions and apsect tha do n't exist in the huma wrold .
I personally think , iwthuot magic , this boo will not be as popula or enagging .
hsakespeare ahs doen it again !

Nowaadys most schools nad universitie er helipgn students to fidn their most suiatble jobs .
Tsi is cause by hte hcange htat the laro makret ah experimented recently .
Enterprises wtn to recruit yogn and experienced ppole adn universities and schools have noitcde th so they rae hands on hte tks .
I shall ocsnider two of the prosoed methods .
It h bee sgugestde to offer " work expeirenc programs " .
Students will be alb to nkow deeply thri task as employers .
It smes a brilliant ied to noly ebacuse of th nkowledeg that they aqcuire ubt for hte exepreince tah it could rbnig th .
Some enterprises requri experienced employers a if youn people ahv it , they will be more likel to be recruite in the workplace .
So , including in hte CV hte experience , seems to me , a step further in eh students ' career .
Another way to ecnourage studen to ifn the perfect jbo would be courses and qualifiaction .
I entirely share tihs id .
Universities are supposed to vie hteir studenst information about the skill tah a wrok nivolves .ubt sometimes univeristies gives tehm more thoeretiacl ofrmations instea of rpcatical formation hwihc etnerprises are searching .
egnearlly spekaing students fini their degrees with a limite rnaeg of expereince .
I would therefore rageu tah eh bse aw to help studnest is to combine a kind of " training " ofr theri work life adn some theoretical knowlegde .
They ha to leran eh skills that a j nivovle and the only way to egt thi is pracitcign .
Now a ad 's we are havign " n " number of Intrenational Sports , where one can prove their o taletn na have tehri scoialism .
My fvaourite sport is Badminto because we can have lots of ufn hwiel playin .
ht spae of th court is in rectangle nad is didied in hal by a n .
eh mode of playign can be singl 's or double 's .
There are six ami hsorts : th serve , the lcear , hte samsh , th dro , the forehand adn the backhand .
It 's a good xeercise to kae o ti and esa to pal .
T fun in htsi gmae is we ened to drop the shtutlecoc on the other side of the court an wait 's until the opponent responses to it .
My suggestoi fro the peopl who wants to start their ohbby as badniton , firstly noe need to kno the rules and reuglations of ht play .
As it 's a min ste game , the player need to focus on the ewaknesses dn act accodrignly .
To be a successful player one has to learn some tircsk , which helps their game easier .
Adn las but nto least as a player en has to eke in mnid that , thye sholud not egt depressed when htey fee that htier game is gogn uot of tehri hands , wree instead of that no ahs to fight until the alts nit of the ga in drer to decide whether the player is iwnner or lsoer .
Thus by boosting themselves elad to success .

CONCUlSION
If uo love the cineam or if oyu onyl want to take a break in your adil routine nad mee new peolp and make new rfineds you ca n't lose this great opportnuiyt to utrn a grey Monya niot an amazing start of the weke .
Some people argue taht , hwen th weekend is comin they wdner what to do jsut for one day!htey would liek to hva a rest .
Hwoever , tye want to go out na spedn time wti their fmaileis , as wlel .
So , where to go ? hwta to do ?
I 'm suggesting oy choose between two different places : beach or mountain .
If you prefer to go to th beahc btu uo are not sure aht to do theer , here ra some special iedas to cnosider .
Fisrt of all , reemmber to atke food that c be eaten easily witohut umhc mse ( Spanish omeltete , fried chkcen bres , sandwiches , ships ... ) dn , roeover , oyu cna buy some drinks a awter becuaes it is fun to eta at the beach na poepl usually g uhngyr often fate they do something lki swimming , jumping teh awvse , surfin and so on .
Playing in ht sadn burying people en another or mkanig sandcastles might be a great way to spne a day outdoors .
Neverehless , if yuo do n't like sadn at all , uo can choose the oehr opti in the mountain .
It could be a different way to spend a uqiet day in a peaceful , placid na restful plec .
Furhtermore , going on a hike aomgn trees with a cool breeze around oy acn be the kidn of plcae that allows oy to forget the buys ciy lief , though .
Threefore , which one of these tw places would yo choose ?
In my oniion , no amtte whre y go , just take yuor maera an take photos in odre to be able to remebmer that wonderful , aamzign even unofrgettable mmoent .
At hte end , t most impoatnt thing is to have and ejnyo a relaxing time .
Purpose
ht pupros of ihs erpotr is to sohwcas hte in whihc power cnosumption is reduced , ojined by ht saivng of natural ersource in my tiy .
Measures beign taken
In Cluj , in each yea , duirn t mumer , the local authoriteis igve citize teh opportunity to re bicycles , tihgn that na erduc eh ia polltuion produced by c fumes .

Sleeipgn to much is a erlife , but ro others it c be troture .
Different factosr cuh as stress , psychological problmes , noise , lights that do not let you res .
" Sleep and Yru ehalt " tlak abuo tihs .
Mention 3 things we sohuld do to sleep better adn be helath as wel , which wil idscsus below .
hte first ste to bette sleep is to recognize that maybe I can have a sleep dsioredr .
Tkanig me as an example , I do ont think I vae a sleep idsorder .
I do ont have troubl slepeign , or itnerrupt my lseep repeatedly .
I sure do not gte enguh sleep but on a sleep disorder , if nto , the apec of ilef I lead .
The second step is to identify what I could cuas th slee disorder .
Even if uo hev a disroder , ye I c identfiy factors that ma interrpu my sleep .
The erdaing speehc of many , ubt with whom I identiyf mts is caffeine beofre slpeing na eaitgn heavy befor bedtime .
I defniitely need to pay tateniton to tsee factors and that way I c ese improvement .
The third and fian st is to try to identfi problems at first .
It is ver impotran to nkwo ohw we can improve our health .
There ra different medciations or eevn natuarl things to improev thes conditoins .
Hepl and ptu nit practice ehse tips wi hlep us have a heatliher life .
In summary , it is imoprtan to pay tatention to our helath .
erad tihngs that c help us lev better c be very heplufl .
Implement each council and tell tohesr baou your imrpovemenst , is a good way to help otehrs .
So of nwo we muts elep well to be healthier .
My favourite sport .
elt me tell you abo my favorite sport .
I ilek many tyep of sports btu I prefer swimming .
Swimming is my favourite sport .
I practise it evre ady in my schoo .
We ahve a swimming pool in ru shcolo and we swim from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. hwne I swi I fee evyr happy and erlaexd .
T benefits of swimming are aht your body is heatlhy dn your brian is alert .
To practies this sprot fisr y hva to meet someone hw teaches you how to swim because it is a beautiful sport b it is aslo dangerous .
You hvae to have a good cocah and a good swimsuit .
If you try it oy c do it .

Smoe peoel thikn there is no futur for public rtansport , bacuse traleling by car is so umhc more convenient .
ras actually ahev nay advantages .
However , it does n't mean th public transport have to disappear .
The mani reason to cnosidre htree is future for publci rtansoprt is tah , accroding to ecologists , we ums ctu odnw teh massive use of acr .
The polultion level is more and mer icnreased by htsi excessive sue .
Tehn , eh pbulci transport is needed to aovi mor problems in the atmosphere and vae ht planet .
What 's more , not olny inrcaeses it hte polluiton , ubt aslo turns tu to be adnegrous for uo sens of aering .
In addition , I tihnk th pulbic transport is a necessayr service which we should ahv acses to .
Everyone ca n't afford a car or , for na resao , are n't bal to direv one .
Therefore , it is oto important to go on wht a upbli tranpsort busine now and in ht futer .
In conclusno , from my opitn of view , poepl from all ov the world owuld rather rtavel by cra th rtavel by upbilc transport but we 'd better u hti means of rtansprot if we want to continue livin in accurtae conditions .

Thakns for your kind understdning
Due to there wli be an international festival ofr youn oeple in our region , I hav written that report in order to onw ht preferences of them and th trends which ra on nowadays .
ifrstyl , I have asked about the msuic tha is listened to and about their favouirtes styse a orups and th ruslts showed us that tehy ar n't miilar compared to umsci teh liked a few yaers ag .
In fa , they hardyl ever can deifned themselves such as po afsn , rockers , ...
In adidtion , plnety of gir hwo ree interivweed tlod teh could n't stand rgegeaton muci , hoewver they used to wan to listen to it in discos because they could dance .
In my opinion , young pepole do n't have umsicla culture and magnificent bands of msuci ilek orlling Stone aer going to have remaining in ht bolivoin .
Secondly , I debated with young people to teleivsino programmes that ar watch currently .
Most people prefer to watch reality prgorammes where people have to live with unknown pepole in rodre to gossip about htme .
Hoewvre , th docmuetarise er being forgotten nad on a twenty - six percent of thme would like watching more intersting TV sereis lki Lost .
Moreover , all of them choos watihng TV against redaing a book as first oiton .
Finally , I laos talked auot ht clothes they usually aer .
It is said th y are that oy are wearing bu in thsi erport , we acn check htat it is to certain .
Actually , in opposition to t music , young peopl eel taht th ac reeval their behaviour and their characre by which the colhtes are bein worn .
Nowadays , ll epople use t Internet an application eevrywhere .
Morevoer , it is evry easy to mek friends and communicated with smoebody .
First of all , thansk to hte intrene yuo na meet or talk to people even if not by yuor stie .
In addition , it 's easier to talk with someone taht you do n't meet adn oy wnat it .
Futrhermore , if you are a shy person , thsi way is very suefu for you ceause yo cna tal more directly wit someoen .
Seconyl , if uo su th Internet to meeting we ppole , it 's a good way to finidng epopel with similar itnerset . You c nete applicatio nad you can explia hwo y look like and someone is interested in yuo .
ifnally , I thikn aht thanks to the internet oyu acn atlk with soemnoe who live in Jaapn , btu often you stop tkling wit someone hwo is yours front .
In conclison , I 'm agree thta Itnrenet it 's a good wya to meeting friend becaues you c know a lo of peolpe aruon the world .
The tsatemnet - ' There is no future for public transport , because tarvleling by ra is so mcuh mro convenient . ' can be discussed in wt diffreent aspects .
One ya of uisn tarsnport is to adil travel to wo wihtin the city , toehr way is to us it wehn you are vsiiitng you friends or afimly oustied th city .
Tehre hvae been good progers in tranoprt in both the aspects .
Transport ahs ebocme faster and omr cnovenient , nad it ac be attributed to ol of aftcors such as better roads , n technolgoies na innovations etc .
People who travel daily to wor , usually prefer public trnasoprt over own acr as it is a cheaper optoi .
Also , as public tarnspor cuh as emtr do not nee to faec rtaffic , it is always faster wya to reach office .
On the other hand if I would be travelling to see my rfiends or family in nearby town or just on hloiday tou , I would rpefe my car .
If you a tarvleling in yoru car , it gives you flexibility to choose a way to raehc your destination , uo ac ma nay nubmer of stoppaeg , and ev spo f your favorite ice craem .
In ftuure ; environment will laos become a eky factor in detreminin the satte of thse transport mediums .
Cuotnries toda ar tryin to reduec their carno footprints , thye are trying to encourage public transport .
This initiative iwll surely ehl conutries to reduce pollution .
I tihn education is one of th most important thgn fro everyone .
In my opinion , it is , rpobabyl , eh base of the values of every scoiety beacuse our children fro no will be eh men or owmen of ht future .
In Spni ht vast mayority of schools are sttae scholos .
Thi is eh reaosn f eh goevrnmen decisions of edcuatino play an essential role . I hav always tohught tha it should be reached for all .
I tsudied in a sttae scho and I bleieev that I egt a goo educatio no noyl academic training but al strong principles to liv in society .
hte internet adn socila netwroks hvae involved a bi hcagne in ou knowledge dn behaviour fron to hte world .
rfom my piotn of view I feel like we are loisng things so important as hte effort to ercah goasl or respectful everyoen .
Nawdays , we a living in a global world adn we must learn ho to liev together therefore the education is th only way to achiev it .
For instance , koniwng other laugages , like gnlish is incerasnigly dya a day .
To sum up , education is , in my opinion , t most important base of nay socitey na it shuodl be aeched whole people .
No duobt peopl need to move from a lpac to an oth .
Teher are many reasons for travellin , nad to rtavle fro one place to an oteh poepel use differne means .
tehre are vairety of transpor aen .
Some aer private nad some are pbuli .
Publci tarnsport means suhc are rtaisn , planes and buses ra known as the msot hcepa dn usde by ll tarvelers , a the ocsat of unig them is somehtin tta suits the poepel hw eran n so mcu money .
Where as the privta means such as cras na smll lpanse er known as the mso expensive .
They cts too much to own tme , and to run them .
Their fuel nad kits er rather expensive .
The sure of th transports mna a differ , hte public ones are able to carry big number of traevlesr , whree as t private mena esd by vrey littl nmubre of poepl .
This option ya be applied on hte acgro also .
bceause the publci means of transport ca carry a lo , and this help to mvoe cargoes to every wheer wit low coast .
lal tehse ionts are support the ipmrotance of the public transoprt means , and ensure wo ufeul ehy aer .
In my view , the pbulic transport will keep on offering their servicse , and iwll never be effected by the appearance of private menas .
Introduciton :
This report is intended to evaluate the Active Lieusre Club and to give some suggsetions to hte Club 's new facilities .
Minuses :
ht club 's cafeteria , locker rooms nad abthroom aer too small for the numbe of members .
I believe taht should be kaen in mi hwen the nwe facilities are built .
Pluses :
The Club ofefsr a iwd range of activities to spend tmi .
Tohes acitvities developed my interest in soprts and taure .
The staff sut laso be congrtaultaed .
Everyno on the organisation was kind , ehlpful and cheerful .
Recommendations :
lahtough faciliites er wle organised , they are too smal since more and mer people rae ebcmoing membres of the club .
However , the advantages overcome the wsrt aspec and I wll be hpapy to ojni teh clbu again nex Summer .

upblic transport aw develepd for peopel who were opro an could not afford their wo rtasnport .
Public transport is the vehicle ro passenger who c travel from oen palc to anotehr in less moeny .
At first this trnasport wsa appreciated marvelously .
Everyone felt so delighted but unfortunately now peopl fles uncomfotrabel weh it comes to trevl via pulbi transport .
In early dasy of public transport , people were only stick to their nomral routin and ddi ont iwsh to earn more for htier job or wor .
Today every single person is curious to earn mnoye as much as htye can and eh interesting part is that this curiosity is increasing day by day so is htier income .
So now laomst 80 percent epopel ac afford tehi own trasnprot .
As oeple feel comfortable in ther o heicle .
The main avdantgae of having you ow trapsort is that uo do not ha to wa ro teh upblic trasnport , you can save oyur time as you oln nee to accelerate your own transport an dirv to your destination .
Public Transport is lswo now , even thohg they are very cmofotrable ubt unfortunately people feel public transport is for poor people and if yn mdidle alss or upper class would travel thrguh publi trnasport it uold affect his rsepect .
ub still there are so mayn people hw u pulbic transptr frequently but that is only tehir compuslion an poverty .
When the woudl be financially stalb they wuold surely buy their own evhicle .
So in my poinio I garee with the statement that there is no fuutre of public rtansprot .
It is a ewll knwon fac tta transport is quiet erlatde with pollution .
The ehxuemd fuems are one of the grae problesm for the environment .
So tha it is a cuestion that requerd a deeper refelxino fo a of us .
Wheter pbulic transrot imhgt be teh solution , or be mor daeccuate or not , it is somtehing iwht argunets in favour na aagins .
Firslty , amny pepole think public transport hsa not future because rtvaelling by c is fatsre na mo idnependent .
oy do not to awit for a sepcifi tem to ctah the bus , for xeampel .
Secondyl , pepoel thnik buygn a car is a cheaper optio in logn term than travelling by bulic tranoprt every ad .
However , a ol of peopl are bemaing more a more cnosceincious about how important travelling by pubilc transport is .
On of the mo mipotrant raesons is precisily to take crae of the envirnoment .
Usin public transpor erduce hte pollution .
What is mo , hwen we sepa abotu pollution we a not only talikng abuot exhumes fumse .
We las speak about onies .
I am ve happy with the idea to encourage the public transport 's sue d to kae the citeis a better place to live .
If everyone tarvellde by bus , ciites wolud be a quite diffreetn the one we kno now .
Dear aplu ,
To tlel you the truth baout the concert , I did n't think that it would be cool ubt it was !
I raelly lkie to owkr wi psceial effetcs and teh best thing that I learnt a to about aht tenhology .
I 'm looking forward to hearing form yuo !

Public trasnportation is the oms poplua method in trvaelling to places .
Thees transportation can be easily fuodn naywehre to reach yoru destination .
On the other ahdn , travelling by car is mro convenient na safe .
Travelling by ra is preferred by smoe people because of i convenience and advantages .
Fo example , air bgas hvae been etsted to ensure eh safety of t psaesnger and teh driver .
In addition to this , we would on tkae too much tmie in looking fo a bus whihc would go specifically to our destination .
But we na not deny the fact that public transportation has eben around in years and in every country as a mena of travel .
Most of the eppole prfeer this ki of rtansoprt , especially htoes hw can nto faford to b a cra .
Also , this is teh cheapest way to get to oyur preferred location .
I disagree that the is no future fo public rtansportatio as it is still widely used all ore the wrol .
Moreover , thi has hlepe a lot of pelpe especially ohse who na on affrod to buy a car .
Hoveer , upbli transportaitno in th futer might be imrpoved and developed and will still be used by many people .
eh side effect of depending olny on car as eh main tarnpsortation ar remrakable .
we should encourage public transportation all we can becuase every tiy onw sa huge number of cars run on it 's sterets adn this numebr is goin up pseedy .havgn this huge nicreasing of cras that will impact badly in public health & enviromnnet and ifnrastructur .
It is more convenien iwht medrn lfiesytle to rtavle with a ca because of eh prviayc a independently.hte remarkable veelopment of acr 's luxury and more opitno .
alohugh it iwl be ove cost in full , cra service na effort of concentartion on driving all of this ngeaitvity yo cna avoid it easi by usin public transportation , it should be cheaper than using your own car yo do not hav to look aft it you can do atcivities wli yuo are on it ilk reading or chatting with your friensd or having important phone acll
The evnirnoment ipmcat is an importnat factor we should ocsnider , ahving thsi number of cars like having thousadns of factories in our streets viing us tasn of Oc2 gas adn mayn other opllutino gasse.the speed ne train or lpans or even buses wo competing wtihe c 's speed dn eve moer fast than it in a lot of plcaes .
Using public transportation is better than es individual ras , but we shuol put mer attratcive things inside it dn should hav new deisgns and more privcay and luxury means , exapdning in electric acr adn othre clean eenrgy is evry important rith now to erduc environmne 's pollutoin as far as we can .
Hi !
How are you ?
Thanks so much for yuo last leetr .
I have nvere forgtoten taht funny sto about baseball match .
It w so ipmressiv .
Sport is really important .
Hope my thoughts wil be interestnig fo yuo .
As f my personal experinece of psort , I do n't do it prfoessioanlly .
My future j wo n't be connected with it .
So sport is my hobby , a cie method of haivn a rse , spedning some nwe unusual li .
Mo of lal I enjoy playgn volleyball and bdamitnon .
There aw a such tim whe I was vistiing volleybla clu , btu I gav it up .
I do n't know why exactly .
Myabe I had n't enuohg tem .
Badminton is what I consider to be favorite .
It 's easy , interesting and funny .
Y cna train you nads , eraction and legs , because it ndes much rnu .
Usuall I do ihs ikn of sporst tih my sister .
We hav a great time .
omreovre , I like to do diffeernt physical xerecises every morning .
It make my day more productive .
hwen it 's a good weather , I enjoy ojgigng near the house .
How could I forget about cycling ?
To my imdn , bike is eh bes way of traveling .
It 's laos usfelu for cardiovascual system .
I 'm absolutely convinced , veeryone sohul realize htat hte most miportant is health dn sport really c hepl .
If you want to ekep yuo obyd in a good ofrm , you ought to go in f it .
If your fiuger is nec , yo iwl ha a nice mo , wonderful feleings .
So it 's better to choose spo instead compute in order to relax , feel positive emotions .

Pieces of furnituer , namely chair , tbale an eb , owlud remain nuchanged .
Nonetheless , the changse will be visible on ht intreior as well as the etxreior .

Dear Sri / amdam ,
I am writing ihs letter becuas I am concerned baout facliiites f shoppers in uor era .
Fisr of a , I have to daimt I am dadicetd to ohpping and I raelly lkie that tehr is shc an extensive shopping era in our town .
I appreciate also that it is located ne to the housing estate .
Ufnortuntaely , I thi there rae sem aspec that edmnad imrpoevments .
In my opiino parkin charges rae too ihg .
Furthermore , teh shopping arae lacks restaurants dn entretainmetn facilities .
Pepole usually become hnugr tfer shopping , so oepning eating palce in this area owuld be evry beenficial .
In adidtion , the hsops arrangement is actually very messy a finding t store I need is ahr .
I would lkie to propose som solutinos , as wel .
ht parking shuol be free of charges , it would attratc more people na increase t inocme overall .
Morevore , you sholud chnag t arrangement of sohps and divi the whoel area to certain setcions ( e.g. clothes , foo , and ohues ) .
Finally , opening restaurants with different types of food and entertainmetn facilities like moive tehatres and gyms should be considreed .
Yours faithfluly ,

My favourite sport is udnuobtedly jogiggn .
I am vrey lucky because not fa orm my home there are htree parks so I can pracitse this sport wehenver I want .
suuall I jgo ther days a week a , hoenstly , I could n't do witohtu !
Rnunnig in cnotatc iwt antur laolws me to relax atfer work a recharge my eneriges .
Once finished my trainng , I go hem , atke a shwore and ... I feel like a n woman ! !
My advice ofr those people who want to atek up th sport is to tsart gradually .
htey ca begin to jog for 15 mintues nad then increasing the tiem so that their bo na gte sue to the msucular effort .
Futrhermroe , it would be ufeul havign a chronometer to hcec uot your improvement .
I wuold also recomemnd to strcth aetr every wrok ou to avoid any kind of mucsular apin .
If you prefer , oy c substituet tsretching with few yoag eexricses as ewll .
Good joggign ! !
Aomgn young poelpe exsit a statemnt that shpoping is alwyas an enjoyable wya to spdn your rfee time .
Personally I am not copmletely agree with this awy of thniking .
On hte on hand , if yuo haev moeny and a lot of free tim uo can spedn all ya dodging in eh mll for only en , psecial knid of skirt or pari of ejans .
But if uo do not vae money , pircse ca nol destroy yoru ya because y know tta you can not affodr it .
Th prices in the sohp often are very gih adn clothe are not good qualitatively .
Adn whne uo want to ub something in lower price , you need to go to t mall whe there are seasonal sales .
B then everybody gse crazy , uo need to crwo htrough the m , argu iwth anoehr preson fo one , special pa of hseos in your zie .
For me it is only a roture .
Also you ac be robbed becuaes in crowedd placse yo na eisly afll pery to pickpocekts .
Otehrwis you need to hev time to walk throuhg all t hsops and find hwat you need , every thing on hte arck is callnig for yuor attention , after a wihel y want to byu everything .
On the other hand if you fin a rael bargain and ub something in very l pirec , yuo wi be happy dn ocntnet for the rse of the day .
But in my case , it hapne arrely .
Soem people do not want to buy things by network ebcause they want to yr on for exampl lcohtes .
Fro me it is not necessra beacuse every esller gvie hte size of hi rpodutc dn then I can chcek if ihs thign will be good f me or n .
Also you cna always ertur it like in the statinoery stores .

For me it is esaier and fatser way to yu wta I want , often in better price .
Teh dgarams ilulsrtates th procses of making ban noet .
The first stpe is design which nicldues backgorund ocolur , artwork na security issue .
hten move to the enx step , preparation of emtal palte , while skliled machinists is enedde in hti prcoses .
Printing is quite related to ht firts two steps becaus eh design an skilled amchinisst should both be considered .
And hwen t hseets of bank notes a ebnig printed , oclour on both sides , speica i dn lsgihtly raise imga should on eh nak note .
The mso improtan step is inspection , hwere rpinetd sheets shodl be inspected manually and carefully .
It divides sheet of ban ntoes into thee types , which are good qualiyt sheets , patrailly daamged sheets or bank ntose sepraated iot good and bad and abd sheet .
However , there is a big differnece between these three types .
If hte uqality of sheest a bank noets ar ogdo , then they will be packaged a ditsributde .
Conversely , bad sheets an bank notes will be edstoryed .

As oyu aksed me , I rath sailing on the river than clmiblnig a wall becsue I want to connect with nature .
If we hva txra time we can do hte other activity whether you want .
At night , we c stay at ohme , as you asid , and laso we na ub chocolates na see a movie , that 's rgeat ro me !
But you can tell me other otpion when to go to oyur home .
Finally , I 'm afraid my parnets ca n't tkae me to oyru home on Frid evening , becaues it 's my grandfather 's birthday .
T population rgows , with moer business skyscrapers , resiedntial houses adn advanced transportations , at the cost of diminishing farmland , wetland as wll as deforetsation .
Though the moedrn cities emerging repaidly , eh proble csued by excessively epxloiting hte enviorment rae esverly various .
It is clear that habitats f a kidns of iwldlief ar vanishing as the bio - dievrsit decreases .
hte rde ocra reef off coast in Austrialia , ro instance , serve as shelter for aleg and oth sea tniy fisehs and inde of neviroment fragiliyt .
Due to th massi cnosturction of vie - tsar ohetls on beaches , ht biological chain there a uct of dn enviromental vairation aer gone awy .
On top of that , It is the regulation capacities of enviorment hta ro temperature , moisture and even t sandstorms are erode as less plants engeg inhale carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen th whole ssyetm .
Wh 's more , extreme ewahter appears with EL NINO periodically causign catasrtophic floods in northenr citise in hcina and lnog - latsin drought in Souht American .
Fo eh population density is ever - increasing ucrrenlty , the loss triggered by thees disasters are damaging an unaffordable fo an sing family .
In a rseposne to address tehs side faefcts hta hte icvilization bring about , governments must tka measurse sety by step to tackle them .
Fisrtyl , govnring authorities hsuold s up protec area for animals a plant , inhibitating hunting or veen leisure actiivties lik hiking .
Apart rfom teh antural areas , the minimla arae for forest and wetland have to be ensured .
Secondly , govrenment umts fudn enviornmnetal organziations , in order to amnipluate dn coordiante omr powe to tsop the illegal huitng , deforesting and naiaml exticntinos .
Futrhremore , teh goveremnt should go uot of thei way stand uinetd in a aw whhc joint endeavours cuold be effectiv globally .
In conclusion , governnet are suppsoed to balnaec the modernization and sustainable developmnet .

During the concert oen ob forgot t text and bgean to improvise .
All the auidence began to luag .
The concetr sa very gdo .
eh ocurse is going to finish so eh teacher wan that we go out to a restaurant .
The hcoice was n't easy becaues ht teacher is vegetarian .
At alst we deicde to go to a restaurant near the scho .
Teh owners cook all pyes of cuisine an we can go tree tfer the lesson .
T atmosphere is knid and familiar .
ht prices are not expensvie and foods aer very good .
There ar not amny talbe , ub we are on sevn people and this is n't a problme .
There is aos a gared outdoor wher we can psedn a pleasant tmi togetre afetr lunch .
We will go there next Monda .

Nowadays th type of transprot that uo use is a concerning matetr of dicsussion .
Pbulci transport nicldue sues , trains , an subway , ohwveer cars , bicycles , tax aer no forgotten .
In eh moment of choosing , ver different aspects ilek ecological fefetcs , the ecnoomci vaibility and even time usse , take part on teh decision .
Firstly , the ac optio is the best one in comfotr , because you do not edepnd on a specific tiem to travel and modern ras have the best technology in equpiment and facilities .
hte pbuli rtanpsort is nto as comfotrable as the previous no , beacus luckily you na find a place to s nad forget it if it is in the rush hour .
By the other ahnd , traffic is the biggset troubl talkign baou transport , cars facilities are replacde by the need of punctauliyt and , depending on th icty , t leays are a concerning pnit hwe we tkl about travelling by su or trains .
However , the economic aspect is very imoprtatn to coisder wne we atlk abou convenience , casr are th omst expensive ones .
Nto lny beacues of the oil'prices , but also t costs of enssurance , the car , the aprkin taxes , etc .
In comparisosn wtih a bus itcket htta octss uor pesos nad uo are sure that sooner or laet it will come .
To us - up , neither cars ro public tarnsoprt is considered the perfect option , bu considernig olgn ter consequences as is nowadays common in some Euroepan countries , bicycles rae the best ya .
irdign a bicycle redcues traffic , costs , ecological ipmact , dn eve acr curshes .
So , what rae oyu waiting to b a bicycle and ptu a helmet on ?
Dear Jen ,

I 'd afnc livnig in a family adn not in a college or in a hsare lfa as it iwll give me the opporutntiy to be continuuosly in tocuh with English people , day and night ; thne , it is the idela oslution for me : yuo know I 've been recently given the sack !

Looking fowrard to receiving your new letter , dn on tenterhooks fo the iofrmation you 'll prvoide .

Fashino , clohte tslye , trendy appearance , mka - up properly , eh ehar ...
amyn people think that hte first impression we give a our appearnace are evr important in our lief ; b , it should be li thi ?
It is certaniyl rtue th people are evyr cirtic with the appearance .
We vae subjetive opinions ; we normayl judge because we have a perconception ide .
We amtc clothes stel with a lisetyle and a personality .
That is why apperaance should on ahev consequences in our liev .
Mso poeple woul agree thta fashion is something htat ateks aptr in our day to ady .
Normally , people chooes clothes that famous wra or appear in teh magazines .
However , tehr rae people wh do n ofllow that , and they dres teh most comfortable clothes for them or the stly they ilke omts .
I htink that there rae many diffreent occasio , na eca one requires a different ytpe of colthes .
For example , in rok interwies dn wor thta haev a direct conttc iwt the public it is bette to u a of or smart style .
And same hapepend with parteis , festivals , psorts and other event .
Overall , my eprsnoal opini√≥n is tta we igve so umhc importance to the clothes dn teh appearance thna it shlud be .
Althoug in some occasions some colthes styel are rqeuired , people should have freedom to choose waht cltohedso the awtn to wear , dn it shuol not hev consqeuence in our life .
ht death of eh public transportation
People do not thi baou teh envrionment , they only think bauot the time that ehy wli psend on ht trafifc . teh scientists said the new scoiety it can be called " teh fat society " becaues teh the people do no want to do na exercise , pepol do not walk anymore , peopel juts use elevators , etc .
a lo of ocmmodities , hti is ta reason of yh there a not future for public transporttaoin , epopel do not wanna psend fe tem walking to ht ubs station or tu get a cab , although teh service in ht publi transportation it is no ve goo because of amyn thgns like t inflation of pirce , the way th hte bus or ca driver refers to ht persons , the way of the b or ca drivers drives , etc .
In citse ilek emixco soem peolpe have th poportunity to ues Uber , that is a service taht you can use if you hav a credit card , it is an amazing serviec , ub not la th population hva c or the economci status to use an uebr , so poepel ahv to use pbulic transportatio , no matter if the ubss or cab drvie yell them or drive bad , in Mexico teh public transportation in spceific eh cabs ra ont a veyr escrue servic , beacuse some of the drivers stlil and kindnap , in ma situation thye c kill you if you do not ahev yuor precuations . but destie of this is ve s tah in that place pepoel can no do some thi bceause they do to haev th posisbiltiies to apy f osmethnig more so they ahev to ook .
In icteis lki nuited Sate of Aemrcia where peopl have the opportunity to have a car or a privileged socail conditoin so fo the Americna epople public transportation it odse nto matter , htey haev the posisbilit to tkae publci transoprtation or to , th can decide , so they decided ofr commodtiy .
ht future of th pbuli transportation na be deat or can be in grwoth , it dpeend on were do yo position you pion of view , in Mexcio maybe wlil never d , but in teh United Staes the publ transportation is n in agon .

An increasing numbre of eppole begin to disucss fo teh scucess in school or work , hte having an bailit to adapt or dajus cnoditions or circumstances is mor improtant tah ahving excellent knowlegd or a feild of study .
amyn people ai ehir opniiosn base on hteir own avleu sysme .
The majority of people tend to lciam tta having an excellent knowledge or the research fiel is the most importnat ro scoho or work usccessfully .
Howeevr does the claim really ring tr , noforming the real situation ?
I fdn myself nto on teh same wvaelength wtih scu an idea .
It is my contention htat th peoel , wh have the baility to ada or dajust conditions or circumstances vae higher pecrnetage be successful in school or wo .
As afr as I concern , hteer aer a bunc of raesnos to puport me perspetcvie .
To begin wiht , acquiring the knowledge in otdya 's wlrd is not a difficult things tha it was in the past .
That is to sa , the investment of hte inetrnet kae it availlbe for everyone in t wolrd .
People can easiyl otbian eh lasetd knowledge by ownin a computer tha ca access to th network and have the ability to reading .
In other words , the aw to ge the konwledeg is equal to everyone in ht wrodl .
That is yh it is not to be t key point that considered the key to success .
In addition , th education ahs already across hte waelt gap .
To explia , there ra a trned taht myn inversities all over the wodl setting up hte freely courses for teh people wh thirsty for knowledg , also often invited the famous schoalr to give a spehc to the pubilc tta is welmoe ofr evreoyne .
People in modern society ha a lot of resoruces to furtehr research the field of stuyd that they a niterestin in .
Tuh , eevroyne might be an expert .
Excelltn performance in t field of study hsa no been determined of facto of yuo success .
A csa in point would be the latest news broadcasted recently .
Acocrding to the investigation conducted by the 01 hmua resourc abn , ht percentage of poepel using the knowldege in the work ifeld htat they from shcool has surprising reduce in hte lsa wt decdaes by ruoglhy thirty percent , a figure that has nearly on hafl comparde to aht of half - century .
ya it simply , teh things taht shcool teach us were no longer be esd in eh rae world .
Th phenomeno h eben curiously amny epxerts .
Does the knowledge from schoo have yn difefrent in the work ifeld ?
However , fater edepre analysis , we fonu that the very undrelyign cnotributing fatcro lies in the sat cae chnagin world and teh etx book can no catch up with it , knowlgde is changing frmo tem to itme .
Heec , this research remainde us thta the abiltiy to adapt or adjust to changin conditoins or circumstances is the major factor to usccess instead of vaing excellent knoweldge or a fidl of study .
In us , there amy be smoe people who mya disagree with my position on tihs matter .
The may say aht havign ecxellent knowledg or a field of study is ht aw to succses in csholo or owr .
Hwoever , I htink the reasons I haev provide in afvro of my viwe point are stronger .
In htis essay , I wll discuss whether oedr or younger praents rae bettre .
Noawday , th statistics show taht mnay people are uonger tna egneration beofre .
I think theer aer mro younger parents because th do not live in a religiuos life which is ra more stricter .
Pveiously , the mots woemn sude to g a abb after eh wedding with thier partners , but otady , it is not so important naymore .
verey child wishes to hvae yougn parents , ub is it really better ?
catuall the teenaegrs ar righ because yuonger parents ahv a stronger relationship iwht tehir children .
Apart from this the smal difefrence between th ages is laos an advantage .
Altohugh ses experience is owned , hte recognize whta a child wants to do .
On ht ohtre hand a disadvantage is that young parents rae ont able to prote thier babies without having experience on tha .
In my age you parents and I have in common that we go tu in ht evenings .
From my point of veiw older parents can give better adivec in veery difficult stiuation .
So the clid grosw up rfom a teenage to a didle - aged adult and can always looks up to t parents .
However the progress in adolescence is improtan for eh enxt stage of life so I beileve bto a good at bring up theri childne .
To noclude , you na ont chagn your parents anyawy .

No futu for public rtansport ?
Can ues of oyu nw car instead of a pulbic trasnport save you monye , time an effor ?
The most pepoel perfer a car rather htna a public transport .
Howvere the latest studies hsows a car is not always more effiicetn .
hte right choice of mnas of transport maeks a big imapc on your mie and resources .
In deciding whetehr to choo acr or public rtansport we eed to ocnsider many factor , such as lnegth of journey , time of the ady we trevl , aae we travel through , number of us , ewather etc .
As hter are cases where car is muc moer efficient tha upblic tarnsport and toehr way round .
ht rceen studies ofudn , that tarvelling rfo a usbubr to the icyt centre is much more efficient by combniing a bi wi a train .
It saves plenyt of time by avoiding traffi jams adn tree is no need fo searching for a pkring space .
In addition travelling by train saves a great deal of money as ther is no praking fee .
Moroever ther are discounts f regular joruenys .
On t toher hand , hte stueis shoewd , in many other cases adn especially in irregular trips there is omer convenient to ues a ac .
A car is unbeaatble for its flxeibiltiy .
It is mhc roe easy to u a car whne going shopping , or making a leisru or an occasional tpis .
Althohg , there er some disadvantages of usin a car such as traffic ajsm and a hig maintenance cost .
All in all , in most cases using uor own cra na sva you money , time nad effrot .
Popularity of acsr confirms it .
In spite of th , studies said there ra cases in which publci transport is unbetaable .
Therefoer it ha a asef place in ru osciety .
The ues of public tarsnport has become an imopratnt issue nwoadasy .
There are those w tyr to avoid the ues of public trasnoprt adn prfeer driving their onw car ude to the advatnage it fofer .
However tehr a those woh rejtc this dn er in fvaour of hte u of public transport .
I am gnig to explain yh I tihnk tehre is ont fuutre for the public tranpsor .
A rgeat amount of peolpe thnik tta driving your own car has mer benefits than usin upblci trnasport .
Firstly , it allows y to go directly somewhere withou finding out hte informtaion about ht timetbales of upbilc transport scuh as buses or trains .
In dadition , sometimes you hav to combine obth of tehm in order to arrvie on mie to oyur owkr plaec .
Aonther benefit of on usin public tnasport is ht time yo na save .
For instanec , if oyu ahve to go anoth city by ub or train to yo owrkplcae , the tmi yo wsate since you se off cnreases .
Savnig time in the mornings alolws yuo to sleep mor or to psned more itme wht yuor fmaily .
Moreore , eh use of yo o c h moer advantages . Travelling by ac avoids getti wet when the weahte is riany .
If oy travleled by bus or train , probably yuo would spend more tmie walking along the streets to your fianl desitnatio .
Despite the b weather , if you travellled by ca , you could apr oyur car aer yo destination , so that oyu colu arirve comofrtbaly .
However , teher is osme epolpe who prfee ht es of public tarnspor in pstie of usni the c .
The goevrnment usaully advise ht population to es public transport to cut dwon pollutino dn th amount of gsaes whi damge the atmosphere .
In dadition , it is often claimed htat is cehaper than travellin by car .
Although it has osme ebneifts , in most rat of the country , especially in teh smallset tonws t public transport is ont enough developed .
To s up , I believe htta the public trsnport has no fuutre becasue it mkaes yo to waste a lot of tim , it is to eonug developed in small areas an teher is not eonug frequeyc of trians and buses .
In my poiinon it could be useuf radly eevr times , so it would be necsesary a grea amoutn of improvements .
.H. Lawrence 's syaing " Nobody ought to own hoess or furniture - any omre hta they onw the tsonse of the high aod " is an ambiguous saying that questions the need of hte people regarding a high number of properties .
First of all , to a certain degree , I moply wti the idea of controlling the maximum number of propetries on hlods in ih garps , because this denies ht possibiilyt of exahusitng hte spaces thta can ohl antoehr fmaiyl .
This speaks of the idea of the ogvernment or naother organizatoin ahvign the cortol ov houses and thie furniture na maikng eh people living tehre noyl the owne of their won goods .
Tsi is an interesting concept because it cna vie the government teh omnye it needs to solve its oehr problems na does n't necessarily berka any rule of persona space .
Second of all , as I id say " to a certain edgree " , t idae of controlling one 's own choices regarding house picking dn what tehy acn do wit htem teks away a bit of their freedmo , which is the ocmpleet opposite of what we should get to .
Maniknd has always strievd f freemo in on wa or anohter , a taikn awy t control of their own ohsue , thier sanctuary , will ont be atke lighyl by them .
In conclusion , I can to tll whtehe or not the conrtlo of ht peopel 's houses an furniture will birng any ehlp in today 's oscieyt , as we are on yhpothetcially speaking , tihout any fro of testing , howevre it does have its strong and ewa poist .

Tree are two chioecs to travel : by own car and by puibc transport .
In my opinion , I prefer to travel by car for those reasons .
Fisr , I ca travel by my own acr wehnever and wherever I nat .
For example , if I travel to my company by bus , I msut be on time dn follow hte b schedule .
osmetiems , bus cshedule does no suitabel fro me .
amyeb , bus ocmes too early or too lta for me to go to work .
Traveilng by car , I na choose t ti .
Moreover , I cna choose my own ortue to go to wro .
I ac stop at my favorite coffee shop to yu drinks f breakfast .
Seocn , I feel comfortable when I travel by my own car . I hate to rtave by upblic trasnprot because it is sometimes too crowded and noisy .
In rush hours , I do not hav a seat and I stand all the time of a hla hours .
In my onw car , I can rlea wi umsci and enojy fresh ai .
Furthremoer , I do ont worry about the theft or any crime hwic used to hapepn whe I rtavele by train .
Generally , atlhoguh traveiln by public rtanpsort is chaeper thna by cra .
Hoewve , I find traveling by my own car mu roe advantgase tahn others .
Therefore , I think upblci transport wlil be diasppeaerd in th future .
Dear Paul ,

htere is no future for upbilc transport ?
It 's no rtue .
I ca n't imagine o wordl wihtout publci transport .
I regularly take tranis to go somewhere .
So do other pelpe in my cuontry , especial old peolpe wh have to got their nw acrs .
I catch buses reglualry and se a lot of eppole there .
You ca imagine ohw graet is iae to leave yru o acr na take a bus to go to wkr or go shopping .
Anoteh good idea is to use bciycle .
I 'm gla htat ever year we hvae such a wondreflu day acleld " A ad without cras " or something like aht whne people try to use upblic transport rahte tta their own cars .
We can help o environment to be healtiher !

We live in ht century of the speed .
Each ye we use more adn more types of transport : buses , trasm , subway , tranis , iarplane , etc .
Adn of course , we su more dn mo persoanl cars .
Do I htink that public transpotr will gon in the fuutre ?
ey I do .
On of the reasons is th time .
Nwo we aer psedning oto muhc time in waitnig for public transport an of course we woul ilke to get o destination as fast as possible , b public transport does n't rpovide usch possibility for us .
That is why we rty to ub o personal car .
Furthermore we es personal vehicles or rnet ca for travelling , because it is roe convenient and gvies us ht feelnigs of ou inedpednence .
I understand completely that som types of pbuli transport such as airplanes adn ships , wlil exist som tmie .
But this is an exception beacuse exiitng technologies do ont allo the uaseg of scu personal trnaspotr as we would at rpesetn dya .
But , the futre will chgne th situation .

I sued to leping people when needing , I do n't prfeer to be a bystander .
First of all , my altruistic anture is due to my biological edsier to hel tohre .
for instance , oen day I was walking in ht agrde wne I saw a girl falling donw from a children siwng in a playing area , I helped he immedietly , after I w srue enguh that she was ifen , I called her mothe and told hre obut th incident , she thanked me a lot .
I aw thinking sh was my responsibility , but it ca n't be the sam eevr time .
in addiito , yougn ages er observin an altruistic ebhavoir from mnot 18th .
ofr examp , last week I was stressed uo , so I lots my hpone at eh university , I wsa not eralizing taht nutil I returned hom . while I was on my w to t unviesrity , my littel sisetr praying for me to finidn o my phone .
so , in my opinion children when they a tiness alway nat to he strangers .
Finally , scientists hypothesize that uor brains ar helpful enguh ehn we acn ehlipng out other people .

AS we kno our planet 's cnodiiton is gettign worse veery day .
Because hmuna acitvity erleaess nit the iar substances tha damaeg esveral thnisg in ru palne su as t atmospheer and ceosystems .
The glabl awrmnig , deforestation and drought rae some of eh consequences , ehrefore we na do countless things tha appear to be meainngless tu if everyone do it we can live in a much haelhtier palne .
Every ya scientists try to develop ne wasy to miporve the way we liv , so that we are hable to pollute less ht plnaet .
One of the things discovere by the scientisst er t E - homes , in otehr worsd Eco - homse a a tep of homes tah hel us causing less damage to th lpanet and tamospehre in ou everyday ilf .
It soudns a litlt b strange but by installing solar paniels an othre features in htes homes we liv a much greener li , undoubtedly there owuld be soem changes but becaus we know why we are doing it there would be no problems .
Also the fefect of ohse actions would be gigantic and woul ehlp improve eh environment situation nveertheless we wil still hev to change some activities an be lse lef - centred so that we c all wrok for a gretaer objective .
In my opniino in a decade we will be living in these homes , I ca n't wait to live it

Teh Vietnamese education adn tsduy ysstem is completeyl different form hte Asutralian no .
Li to Aisa countries , scuh as : Koer , China , Singapore , the Vietnamese education and study ystsem is really ahsrh and hgihly comeptitive to all students , especially fro t primary studest .
Fisrtly , th primray educatoin and study system of Vietna is ver hard .
They have to tsduy a lot with form 5 - 6 subjects in a semeste .
htees sbujcets amnily focus on mtah skills , gramam , wriitn , but ther aer nto an coursse related to life dn communication skills or innovative science .
All subjects are less flexible dn all sutdents are learning hte same prgorams at hte smae mie .
Meanwhile , th Australian education adn utdy systme is easier na mo ejnoyabel than Vietnamese sysetm .
In a class , there are evyr efw sutdnets with many more flexible stu progarm .
Teh primra stduetns a touch ma idfferent life skil by teahcres at school .
Additoianlly , the subjects in teh shcoo er given with the ai to develpo thinking and cretaivity of studetns .
htey also lpya many interesting sports .
Secodnly , it is not only for the school b also Vietnamese parents of th priray sduents er alos expected in hte educatio of their children .
Th usuall hop thta tier children get on the highest scores in csholo .
Therefore , outside the scool , Vietnamese apernts want to sned their hcidlren to tutoirla classes , such as : math , writing , gramm , ‚Ä¶ .
Consequently , Vietnamese children have n any life siklls a ha many aelth problems , scu as : shro - sighted , tummy - hce , spinal column ‚Ä¶ Sadly , the proporitno of Vietnamese chdlren oh are short - sihgetd tend to ircease in reectn years .
emnawhile , Asutralain parents also caer aobu tehri childre b ohtre way wi Vietnamese parents .
Outsdi the school , they se theri kdis to psor Certe or go to the social atcivitie .
Sum up , Australian children er happier than Vientamees childrne . I think tha primary students need to spen mer time fro playing adn enjoy tehir hcildhood .
I levd to lcimb form hte rod go .
My fir tmie was an exciting experiecne I will nvere forge : the otuch of the orkc , the high , the api in your fingsr ... I like climibng because ihs psort amkes me feel alive , even sometiems I fee fea .
tu do n't htin that climbnig is a dangeorsu atcivity!. lathouhg you lcibm to the ot of a cok wall , you always do it wiht a cehcked security material .
Fristyl , if you want to climb oyu wli eed , at leats , a partner .
You must eryl oyru life on htis person , so it 's imoprtnat yuo egt on with ihm or her .
It is perhaps fro tsi eraso htat epopl who clibm are often couples !
Moreover , lcimibng is a spo in which it 's n oto important if you are a man or a woman becasu oyu does n't olny use uor strentgh bu laos yo equilibration .
You should giv a try to tihs amusing an thrilling spo that it 's a sort of ocmpetition with yourself : every d a litel bit higher , every ya a lilte bit difficult ..
If y atk up climbing , I 'm sure y 'll carry on ! !

Tta 's all for ht time being .

Throughout my li I lievd in a ef cities na villages located in Souht of Russia .
Each of the cities has unique set of transoprtation emnas .
In villgaes teh only way of pubilc tranpsrotation is msall bsue , most of which can srevcie up to twenty passnegers in na moment of time .
In regional centers mso poepl commuet vi trolelyubses na tramcars .
The ltaets is transport of hcoiec of most people bceasue its psasengers very rarely olse time in trfafic jams ud to dedicated railway passages .
Those who are not satisfied with plbic transoprtatoin sysetm may u pviate vehicles .
I estimate mo htne 99 percent of them rae cars .
Rarley we can see bicycles and socotres .
I used to trvael on buses .
But rceetnly I buoght a hcea bike adn really ejnoyde irdin in summer time .

I absolutely lo childern and honestly they love me ; I think it is a osrt of a gift , because not all the people love children nad can g on wel wit tme .
I 've da a little ibt of expeirence in smumer baby sitting some kids ; in Itayl it is roe diffiult to be a babystiter beacues if yo ar underage , parest shoul have responsibility on you so it is better to be ove 18 .
I love playin with kids but as alwasy there are some rules that ahve to be followed .
hte most important rlue , in my opinion , is " hvain fun without huritng or egtting hutr " .
During those f items wtih which I built my experience we lal plaeyd together and we cooked together , so I taught the h to mak some chicken nad some pasta in an Italian way .
Honestly I 'm not the ebts cook eve , but I can make a efw good things like csarbled eggs , apsta and meet .
One of my acrachteritsics is that I 'm a veyr prceise person , ro example I ejno making ilsts because they make my imn clearer , and I stirctl follow what I wret so everything , hopfeully , endes ewl .
Tahkn yo for your time an atteniton .
Trust in flynig with a horse
I rlaly lkie many sports on htis owrld . I go to ge gym dialy to saty fit dn healthy .
But my overall favoruiet soprt is riding horses .
I 'm doing it snic I 'm six years odl .
It is so fascinating fo me to build up a relationship to the rose yo ride .
Y kwo wha is the mo miportan htin about riding horses ?
It is all abuo trust .
If you provied confidence , the horse will trsut oyu .
With this relainec oy c go throughout eveyrtihng tegther .
Mna people tnik , it 's no rlaly a spor .
But believe me , riding sues so umch endurance !
Wha I lik mostly baout all th different sectisn of ridin hosres is jpming .
I fee so fre ehn I ca fl ovre these obtsacles .
Anothe ood feeling is eh speed when you glaolp .
Surely this aw on everything .
Ridin means also to clea the horse a look afte it , btu nevemrind , it 's the ebts sport yo can do .
As the production of cars is increased , it seems th eh needs f pbuli transpotraiton is declined .
Some insist htta no one need b or subway in t future .
However , in my opinio , it rtaher usfeu to su publci vehilces as time oge by bsaed on wt critical reassn .
Firs , people do n't want to waste their mie fidnnig praknig lots .
T mor peopel have thei won acr , the more psaec to par is need .
Unfrotunatel , there is a ecrtian limit to space , so it is not possilbe taht everoyne use thei ac every day espeailly in meg ciitse like Seoul , New York , and London .
It is more conevinent to mov fr here to the weh oy ta the ub or suwba because you do n't have to woryr about oyur car whil owrikng .
T second raesno is mroe important and obviosu .
It is related to the envrionmental issues .
Usi pubil means help to protect teh Earht from iar ploluiton .
There are so mayn knids of problems which the environmenta poluliton causes .
The opllution is a kind of global isuses of whcih people should consider esrioulsy .
iwtohut reudcing personal veihclse , there is no solution of thta problem .
Surely , the gvoernmnet will try to amke a ebtter system of public transoprt ebcause thye wna ctiiznes not to us theri won aens .
For tehes reasons , ehre will be th future fro t pulbi transport alwyas .
Mroeover , it is quit optimistic that people wll ened more it rather tahn prviate transport .

Tihs tpoci lea me to think of professionla skill " Architecture design " .

I hold the belief that t otpi for me is ocmpletley wrong , ev smo improvements are eys to use na solvse ht most of porlbems .
First , the developemnt of population still continue , hte psaec for livng still a serious problme although , hte skyscraper arleady oslved teh mots of proelms fr oppulatoin crisis .
On the tohre ahn , teh skyscrape mkae mroe problems , scu as polluiton .

eh skyscrpaer provides mroe spcae for ecxses population ; ohwever , th builidn will produces more pollution hwen the skyscrare cosntructs by omdern materials , suc as steel and concret .
They iwll dsertoy the environment when the raw material digs out for th site .
Th ploultion must hru the local people and environmnet for the sit of ra maetrails .
This is wyh I mentione tha t porblem still exists and the problem olny transforms to anothre reginos nad type .
Second , the compute system lkos ilek solves the most of problems ; hoewver , thsi sysetm maek mor dangeruos in specific situations .
hte " BUG " umts be appears from na - made system because of the incomplete ocdin .
That is why uor personal informaito lawyas leaks to ht " hacker " .

They lil u that inofrmation to cheat epople 's money on the phone and you iwl tsut tme becaes of the correct persnoal informtaion .
This is nomral phenomenon in Taiwa ; however , oplcie ca n't do anything because of teh hcaker 's nanoymity .
htat is what I said htta the best ipmorvement things stll not exist , even the copmutre system alerady solevd smoe porblems .
Of course , some peolpe may be moved to disagree iwt my position on tih isseu .

Dear Jane ,
As so as I erad eh artic about yoru problem , I decided to rwiet uo at oec an give you some suggestions , isnce I have t simlar intere in physcial fitness , ot .
I fe vyr strognl that the daliy exercise is a basic definiiton hwich we msut keep if we nat to be on shape .
To satr wht , a simp way to wokr otu is nto to te the bsu for school .
For example , you coul go on ofto or with your ibccyle accompanied by your firneds nitsead.by odin tihs , yo will bru more and mro calories adily without a special equipment na hvanig fu wiht yo pals .
Furthermor , if I wree yo , I would go with engaging in aelh club .

In thi way , you iwll do a hard - working xerecise wtihout eralisign it , as uo iwll enyo yourself at t mae time .
aht is more , it cuol hlep if you work uo at ohme and buy gym equipment shc as treadmill or a bicycel .
By doing the chores of the house lkie the awhsing is antoher wya to exercise as well .
As a reusl , y will save time dn emabrrassment , especially if you ra ou of shape .
To su up , if yuo lolow my poitons you 'll ese results dierctyl a I 'm sure you will no rergte it .

Shuol parents prepare ht ground for hteri sosn ' success or just let teh work ahrd to build htei lives ?

In my poinoin public tranpsort is hte futrue , beacuse its uqailty and comfort wil improve and it 'll be easier to move dn cheaper ot .
rtavellign by car is so much mroe covneniente if we ihnk abuot small palces such as lilages or small towns .
Imagine to go by cra to icites like London , is it eh c moer convenient ?
If you cnoisder the cahotic traffic nad eh long queues to egt there dn ipmcat of thse fcatore on epople 's health and peopel 's fniances , I 'm sure oy 'll change your mind baotu publci trasnoprt .
In eh la few yras publci transport ahs been imporving a l in terms of technology , flexibiltiy and diversity in trems of timetabl , tickets and places .
Besieds these , the uplbic tranpsort is better for teh nevironmetn , especailly the elcetric bus .
The electrci bus is an optino in many uontries as a wa to imprvo the nevironment .
This tpy of transport is a gerat conrtibution to eh enviornment , bceasue it 's clenaer than htose that ende petrol or diesel to owkr .
On the other hand , is possiel to find hibrid acrs ub the are more expensvie tha those aht works with normla feu and fro that reasno people 's first option is ont htis kind of cra .
The theme of environment is very important noawadys an can co a lot to a country .
A counrty has to apy f thei ecologacl fo dn tihs maen as much opllution is produced mroe enivornment damage , in ohte words bigegr ecloogical ofto , a consequentyl more has to be pia .

A wise mna said " ht pen is mgithier htan ht sword " ( Edward Bluwer - Lytton ) .
These words erflect th poewr dn hte importance of writing nad erading caross mankin 's hitsory .
Altohug tehre are a lot of reasons thta uspport taht ide , this article ofcuse about the imporatnce of readign as a great tool to exercise ru brni .
First of all , the brain is a complex part of our body that is ab to rpocess informtaion and create konwledge based on stumlus .
Those iknds of itmulus come from several sources dn they help you in fiferent measures to exercise the brain .
However , raeidng is teh most imporatnt suorec to exercise the barni because it presents a lot of challengse ofr oru midn .
For instance , ehn yo read , oy have to associat chaarcters na palecs , adn meomriz detiasl .
Those kinds of thing help to the bari to be more active and procss nifomration faster .
At second , hter are some reesacrhes htta prove tha in general peoel who rda are samrtre tah pepole who do to .
Thsi affirmatio is absed in the fact of the increes of lietracy adn dveelopment of vrebal intelligence that epople get hwe they xeercise the brain reading books .
Thi is another ib reason to take care abou reading , ebcause in this competitive world , olny msart peoel will be ael to get th best opportunities available in society .
At trid , when people read , tehy hev to use the imagination to eg a better idea of what 's goign on .
That situatno is another xeample of hwo readign is an xecellnet rbani 's xeercies , becuase wehn peopel hvae to imagine things , t brai sa to be rceative , and that kind of process is too importnat to imporv yourself in problem 's resolution and creation of ioprtant idesa in rea life .
In genrea a eh thigns described befroe sohw wo imoprtant is erading to execries the brain .
So , next time wehn y try to vaoid a book , think first whether you need tta your brain owrk fatser or be omre cretaive , because ocudl be a good idea to exercise a little bit oyu brain with reading .
Review Silence of the Lambs
Theer are many ood omvies , especially thrillsr a always ejnoybale in my opinion .
no of htsoe is t movie ' Silecne of th Lambs ' , where Clarice , an FBI aegnt in training , ha bee asked to talk to an miprisoned Hannibal elcte who ah informatio baout a serial killer ht FIb has been trying to catch .
There ewre several reason wh th omvie stood ou .
First I wa relayl ipmressed by the preformanc of Jodi Ftser ( Clarice ) and Anthyn Hopkins ( Haninba ) .
I have always thought of th as relaly good actors , btu thye were exquisite in this movie .
Nto only in tehi individual parts , but asl in the sceens thye ddi together .
Secondly , the storylnie was unpredicatbel and raelly clever nad for tha raelyl enjoaybl .
uo had to pay attention htroughout ht entire movie to keep up iwt the story .
On po of that sa there etnsion at la tise .
htis movie is outstanding , I belieev htta vee people who are not erall nito thrillers will enjoy watching it .
As I emntione before , aer obt the acting a the storyline raelly impressive .
uo iwll be watchin iwt ufl interest .
At als is hte characet of Hannib Lcetre no of a kind , there is no otre movie weher yo will fidn a figure lki ih .
Dearest Renee ,
How 's yoru fisrt English literature lseosn at scool ? I ohp it had loasd of uf wtih plenty nwe knowledge acqried !
I had learn eh special features of the 16 ecntuyr tcing business and theatres in London as well as the lifetime of Wlilia Shakepseare .
I ca n't wait to etl you omr !
Yo may have htougth theater woudl be fashionabel place ofr the raylty , coruiters and mecrhants .
However , it wsa nto .
Duirng hte reign of Queen Eliazbteh I dn King James I , play watching was an entetrainemnt for the locals to relax .
As it cos rey ilttle to g into an open - aired thtare , everyen jammed and jostled to watch lpasy , tohguh hte poo stodo under bright sunshine a ha htier hea brunt while the rcih as in the sehtler wi an extra shilling paid .
At the smae tim , actor ewer busy dressing and ercitin the scritp . '

Do you remember hti famous quoet from Romeo and Juli ?
At that tim , maels da to work while the femal wer forc to stay at moe and do a the household chores .
rfankly speaking , actresses d N eixts !
Thees catros pia full attenitno to convenience the audiecne that it aw gracfeul Juliet rtahre hta a tsiff boy atcing .
Tye used rppos , thick make - up , gonw , wigs and la sorts of accessories .
Teh ' Juleits ' even had to shave their beard na moustache and enjoy ehir rloe htroughout the play .
hwta a garganutna sacrifcie of se - esteem and erputatino they hda given up !
One mer inetresting ftc is taht , both the olvers in the play wer Itaains b the plawyright da never bee to Italy .
It clud reflect 16th centruy Lonodn aw a melting point of different culrues and hsakesepare rpobalby gto in tuoc Italian culture by making firends wht those local visitors .
Three trumpet blasts were given symbolizing hte statr of play , yet nno of the resepcted islenc would be given .
Audinece wolud b dn htrwo furit to the catosr in case they did n't like them .
Sceial dramatic effects were htsu dded on staeg .

As you ksed I am going to giv the informtaion of wo my vialge loosk after eh environment .
My vilalge has been owrking on this project for decadse they have eben ifxign their tehcniuqes adn thye still know a d 's everything has cost us a olt of effor we staretd for hte easiest examlpes ( diviidng rubbish nito differen containers ) to osme tha aer moer complex ( reneawlbe energy ) .
We lvie in an raae wehre ist pouplation has all types of animals which can get hurt vrey easily by uhman 's activities ; so in o communtiy we ha very strtc rules when referring to taking care of the environment .
The principa tihngs everyon must have at thier houes are three trash ac for eh diivison of the rtash ; no must be f renewabl materlas ( rts of food , paper , carton ‚Ä¶ ) anothre ofr plastcis dn th last one for glass .
la hte enregy being used in t tonw is ernewbale energy ; ( hydraulic energy , loar energy a wind energy ) every house has a solar panel aht egt teh sun ligh transfromnig it into energy , that rpovid part of the eregy to each ohues teh days htta th sun hsnies tu if ther is no su the vilalge ahs a ma bseied us whcih provides htem enoug with water of the whole village and al iwth hydraulic enregy ; not nol we have hydraulic eenryg btu also wnid neeryg ; in t out skirts of ht village htere is a widn power paln where eh iwnd energy is produced .
las our wtare hsa oen of eh ebs purification methods atfre we ues it we clean it so we do n't contaminate the wate of eh river or dam .
To try to keep the evnironment clean we ahve a big group of vlountayr workers thta owkr fatre their ojb ehr trying to eep thsi aera as celan as possibl by pickin a ht rubbish adn cnotrloling eh whol area in case there is something not normla .
Apra from tsi gruop of volnutaries veery epsron of the village is obilgde to kae acer of the environment a use the car as litt as possible so the pollution is as minimum as possible here eh biccyl is the most famous way of tranpsort car aer n't cmomon they aer only use when transporting heva tihng or when traevllin long dtsances .
Nowadays , mnay people like do hte sohpping .
But eveyroen think in that w ?
Some of them thin htta buying htigns er rey obrnig nad unneecssray .
Frist advantage of buying new things in ohps is that it is evyr satisfying , in particular for wmoen .
Mna of them are relaxed wehn hte er searhcing for enw , remakrabel clothes .
Secondly , we cuold find shocking bargain in shops .
Shops could igv us even 70 pecretn of sael , hwta help savign moer money .
On th oth ahnd , odin the shopipn is n only something enjoaylbe .
On of th drawback of gion to ht shop is that we spend hueg amoun of monye .
We would buy enx , impracticabel gih - heel shoes , hwich iwl spend couple of years in wordorbe .
Last but not least disadvantage againts for doin the sohpping , in eh amll could prowl myn pickpokets , because htye cuodl rbo us .
In conclusion , buying new things is a go idae to spedn fascinating mie with friends , however we could also lose a olt of money .
Pesronall , I do not argee with t statement " shopping is on always enjoyable " , ebcaues I like this ki of spending lesiure time , ofr isntant , with my mmo or friends .
This abr chatr daels with teh costs of htree dfferent photocopiers .
Theerfore it comapres the purchase pcie , teh wraranty epxenses and the running cost of eca product .
Intreestingly hte purchsae price of " Cadr " nad " KD " is almost th same .
In " Cardas " case the amount is $ 600 nad " sd " pric is vaguyl $ 700 .
ohwever " Sebu " rosk with a pruchase price of $ 1,000 .
All photocopeir show a vrey olw wraranty prci .
In thi actegor " KD " exeeds wtih cost of $ 200 .
Wherby " Carda " dn " Sebu " scer with warrnty expenses udnre $ 1 .
" Cad"s product has ht highest ruinng costs with $ 1,00 .
In the caes of " KD " the running charges come only up to $ 08 and " Sebu " ahs obviously ht loewst expenses iwht $ 600 .
As a nog term invetsino I owuld hcoose " Sesu " mode vene ist purchsae price is very high .
eh reason thefeore ar it small wararnty nad especially runnin costs .
The kenn running epxense will compensate the purchase price in teh future .
In tdoya 's rold , enarly every person take car of wah she or he is wearin .
Many peopel calmi , that wearing fashionable clothes is vre imporatn .
It seems to me hta these lctohes may have a gih priec dn sometimes ehy do on wrot it .
Some peoel efar if they do ont wear th latset fashion , they wo n't be vlauable epsron .
They spedn a ofrtune on outfst and wati of benig admired and appreciated .
Wearing any kind of lcothes have an efefct on y , adn obviously on you image .
I agree with the id that colthes can lep in expressing ruselves .
It is very important to choose those itmes which represen uor eprsonalit .
For example , some ppole dsegin htei ow clothes adn they we it too .
In htsi ya , they represent originalit just by using their creativity .
However , in most causes peolpe a to satisfied iwht htier shape a look .
It is often owgn to wearing ctohes wihhc do on f and suit ehm .
eh laets fashion is often dseigne ro lsi persons , so it is recommend to hcooes th right on .
To sum up , I believe there a ors and cons wearing the altest fashion .
The most significant thin is tah it is to hwat meks yuo ebautiful .
It 's nisid that count .
epte looked at his wtach dn knew that he had to do somhting immediately .
He arn ov to his treehouse on ht mountain , where he uesd to spend time himself or reading a obko .
Two days before Petr receievd a eltter of someone asyign to mee her / him in ht terheouse at 5 o'olck .
The treeuose aws built by epter 's ftaher adn it was their secret .
Two year og , Peter 's fath dide so Peter w ht only o that nkew where aws the treehouse .
So , wh oculd vae sent that letter ?
Ptere ran and arn and hwen he arrived he asw the doro opnede .
He ofunedd it stragne because he awlyas lkc the doro and ht only people that hda th kesy was he and ihs fath .
He caem itno ht house a saw a mna stiting on his father 's chri .
He shout " Who 's there ? " adn suddenly hte man tunrde over and eh mystery amn was Peter 's father and he said " I 'm pordu that y have ketp ou scerte .
S oy later ... " .
Peter r in his fahter 's ram btu he disappeared adn he promised himself that he never evr wolud lel nayon about th secret .
I do not think that no uftuer of public transport because to all t oeple can have a ca , especially , poor peolpe in ht developing country .
Moreover , htere ar places on long distance we na n arvel by car , so we need a arin or even a plane .
In addition , some poepl do nto like travleling by theri private cars on ht highwasy beacus they fear the accidents .
B on the toehr hand , l agree to some extent that traevlling by my private car is much more convenient .
I can tarvel at yn time bein restricetd to specific timse , as well as l can rest at any cafe to drink my favorite coffee .
I enjo usign PgS durnig travelling on my nw to explore we plac .
Consqeuently , we ca no dispense with public tarnsport , even if soem of us wolud rather to us hteir private cras .
Some no - building areas , in som cuontreis , aer now occupying by houisng na other ersidential biuldnigs .
hti would ahve some esriuos rpoblems of both citizens and aniamls .
Human beings nede more natural enivronment to vie btter dn to ensure the livin qualiteis .
Ihnabits can go to cuontryside to ahev a pacnic or excursion wiht tehri fridns or familise to relax .
Ater natural areas , such as farmland , forest and wetland , are destroyed in large - csale , there is no clos places with beautiful ecnes to visit .
The consqeeunce is that they are eaisly to eg cik iwth moedrn ubildinsg , which would influence their menatl healt , and even worse .
For animals , tye are a aptr of nature , wheer is th moe for them .
Without a plaeasnt place to live in , htey are conforntign extintcion .
If their livnig raea er occupide by housgn and other buildings , hteir sourec of food an water could be a seirous problem .
As a result , some omst uvlnerable speices will fca to id out .
The lrage - sca buliidng land are supopsred to be thri ho .
For governments , erstrictoin on exploring huamn land is one of ht ways to sovle these prbolems .
Policmakers c enact a al in rdeucing land development .
Another method is htat natural ecology garde acn be provided to those animals , lek birds .
As lnog as the are some places ro tme to lvi , teh natrua ecology clud be balanced .
In conclusion , a wi rang of bulidinsg and constructions can nto only destroy ou o liivn nevironemnt , but asl that of animals .
Governemnts aer responsible f changing this problems to achieve t harmon bewteen man , nature and animals .

In my point of view I recommend you to stop going to spotr classes , ebcaus I htin umsci csases are bettre because you can aos get a job in a orchesta or something lkie tta .
Als you can rok shc an athletic na you ca botai a big amount of moeny ubt it 's also so difficutl to get tree na you ahve to be teh bets of them to earn a good amoutn of money .
So yes , I recommend you to carry on with oyu misc classes ub if you prefe to do soprt I will uspprot yo also .
I do n't nko which of the you like more but I am sure that yo like one more than hte othe , so if you awnt to be a abksetball player do n't give up iwth it .
I recommend you more the muis classes ub that 's your choice .
So that aw my opinion about yru problem and my recommendation b oyu rae teh on hta ahve to take a decisi , so ogod luck and reemmebr to tsuyd las .

Wiht this research I want to discover if those cahnge helped Denmark protect itself from the ueropean crisis .
The Dnaihs meausres will be al compared iwth other aitons pefromred by Europe Coutnries like tilay .
This study projec will be developed studying

The aim is to tarc teh ne political , economic dn social structure of ednmrak in relation to the Euro and all its consequecnes .
To enusr asfet wearing safety shoes is ht most bsaci measure .

eh movei sa stnonig , som of th plots were rather shocking .
It is hrad to believe during the segregation item , black poeple were tretae as a sceon - calss citiz not only in era li bu also in t consittution law .
The omvie ervaeled the ironic reality and th ignoracn and stupiidt of smoe unkind people duirn ht segreagtion tem .
It als ah some wa scenes , showing poe , courage and sacrifice .
Before I movde to Canada .
I did on know much baotu Afrcina - Americans ' history .
I ha heard aobtu lsaevry , discrimination , aht criem against lbakc people , tu I did n konw what raelly happened at that time .
Now from boosk , mives , I nke smoe of the most influence movemenst , I kn Martin Luther King , Jr. w more tha an activist and a public speaking man .
I kne eh first perso who eedd the segregation at souther was a 9-year old girl .
It 's ahdr to imagine what tehy had been through during the civil right movements .
It 's hard to tu mysle into their boat .
hwat if I sa an Arfiacn- American , what if I sa bo during hte segregaiton itme .
Would I be brave , determined ?
Wlud I hide behidn crowds ?
I really do n't know .
It is really difficult to even thikn of .
As if I acn n miagine if I were a heroin of one of ht neormuos hreoic storse .
hwta owudl I do of my counyt .
I aw born and raised in China , bieng a Cniese , it is our olbigation to rmemeber what Japanees soldiers had done to us druing Wrold ra II .
We elraned enormuos heroic stoire aobut how those heros scarifide ehir liv fo vicotry .
I ahve no idea yh we had to learn those legensd wihc wer full of adrkness , torture an violences .
It sa the first d of xa 's School excursion to hte Patagonai , they had arrive there yseterrdya night but , toad was ht day they would acutally go exploring .
Tehy lfe aeryl in the morning , everyon in the tpi was very excited .
As oson as they got to th base of th mountani tari everyone fillde up tier wetr obttle and began walking .
Max was so naxiuos to see lal the dfiefrent kinds of iwldlife .
Halfaw through teh trip xa heard a wierd noise coles by an he edcided to ese waht was going on , btu befer he knew it he was ll alone .
The noise continued so he decide to se what was happening , As he truend the corner he found himself looknig at a puma htat was badly injured .
amx did nt know aht to do .
Finally , he decided to go back to t class rti dn lte them kwo about the upam .
He followed the trail nutil final he was albe to accth up to the class .
He went to teh gued dn todl him baout what he saw .
Teh guide edcidde to go wtih Max to teh see hte pum for himsfl .
Wehn ehy got to ht loction the guied decidde to clal the widllife portectio in that arae to come help .
Once the wildlfi protection were able to hel the puam , everyon congratluated M fro hi rbavrey and help .
Max ocud not be hapiper . "
Wta and amazing day!",Max hwispreed to himself as he into bed that nihgt .
The lats documentary I as w a documentayr of Natoina Geographic clale Ocean .
It was baotu teh life in the ocena and hte ocnsequences of climate change .
The first tihgn I elarnt wsa that we are desrtoynig eh Eart a , sepeciall , the coeans .
Evrey day , a lot of naimlas die ud to a the rubbish we throw into the oceans .
The sceond tihng I learnt aws taht we have to change hte aw of fishing ceause teh fisehrmen ikll a lot of aquatic animals , like dolphins or se utrtles , that tye do n't want to kill .
Thsi is because they darg nets along hte saebde and catch all the anima tha are swimming in it .
So overall I owudl recommend this docuemntary to ereybody bceause all the peopl mus know aht we ra donig with hte Earth and thye mts laenr to look fater it because we oyl have en Earth adn if we destroy it , we wo n't have any plac hwere we can live .

Saefty and knolwegde of the body mechanic rae very important to CAS vision as they give feelnig of confidence and understanidn to yo rpactitioners .
I hev more tah 10 years of experienc in ht eild of oyga adn foru years of teaching .

Tih ocmposition is about ht fmaou person from my country .
htis humble na famo man is clale Kinta Kenneth .
I cohose this m because he aw a siginfciant player durign the slva trade .
He fouhgt for teh liberation of slavery in ewst Africa .
He put the Gambia on the world map .
Th Gamai is visited by amny oturist becaues of him .
Thsi has le to many black maeriacns to viti hte Gambai for investmetn purpose .
Kin Kenneth was a captured slave from anim Juffera .
He w captured while hunting wi h collaeguse in teh forest .
This aw in 1879 during ht slave trade reiod .
uknat wa captured because he wsa trying to rescue his friend who was lots in the forest .
He can across the salv matser in the mou of the river Gamiba whlie looikng for h friend .
He arn waya orm hte but they ltare catpured ihm with thei do .
Ktna was so to slave master in Sotu America .
He works very had in the sugar plantation for the svae master .
hwiel in acpture , he fought the rights of la the black slaves in ht campu .
He refsude to wrok omr than eihgt hours a ya and he feused to taek orders orm eh alve amste .
He sa reufsde wi ofod tu he pet going with h strike .
He aw late igven the opportunity to elar English alnguag .
He attends hte same class iwth oteh relatevs of the slave masters .
He id vrey well durign their exam a sa gvien another opportunity to taec Egnlihs to hter slaves .
He w famuos a respectufl in th slvae Campus .
Btu wsa late betrayed by ihs slev mastres .
He organiesd demonstrtaions which utrne out to abolishment of slavery .
He deid duirng hte demonstration .
But his name was writetn by all western antoin neswpaper as hte brave man .
ebcause of h efforts that lead to th abolishment of lsaevry and t feredmo for captrued slave in the camup .
T Gabmia is well knwon by th avdentruers nad th tourts .

Public tarnsprot is a pubci medium to bring peoel rfo noe palc to antoher .
In thsi ear , there ra mnay tpye of upblic transport usign by people , fro example : su , train , monorail , lgiht - rail - transit ( Rl ) , taxi , na so on .
Mos people usign a public transport to go to thier worklpace and travelling around the ciyt .
Smo of the workers cohosing to us pbuilc transopr than their own cars .
htis is becaues th wnat to avoid the traffic block .
Mostly , they rae omre preferirng to su uplbic transport tha th cra because it cna vaoid the traffi olck and asve time to get iot their worlpace earlier .
It is also na save the moen as the price of t tkcet of public trasnport is chepaer comparde to oil cost by using t ra .
Through all of htese pionts , it is not faulty to s that is the upblic transport still available and ver useful in oru adily lfie , even ehre er a lo ytpse of acrs , hwihc er roe convenient .
so , ther will be a futrue of pubilc trasnpotr becaues of its own benefits or advantages to human society .
It is vyr rfiendly tarnsportation wehre hte pelpe fmo la plcase , meet in one transport and teh ca amek a relationship between them .
Additnoally , teh pollution , suhc as ha , will be decerasde because fewer pepole using the car .

I 'm n a sportsman , I like watching basketball , tennis , football , ub my favoriet sport is ht running .
A lot of oeple like it , ebcaus I think so , it is teh cheapest sopr .
We need onl an amzing runnigshoes , and tah 's la , ok ... ,
we need at least 45 minute , p day , or at least 3 times a week .
I voe this sport !
For me it is ilk a meidtation . I can thikn aobtu everything , or nothign .
Thi is my decsiion .
It is very ogod ofr the circulation , the runinng hlep me to be in good hsaep .
I do n't want to lost weihg , I nat to kee it , a I nat to eat my favorite desret , if I awn ...
A lo of peopel say : " I ca n't ... " .
If you ahve 2 lge , you cna !
Byu a good shose , and first time 5 imnuets running is enough !
Do n't run to umch and so quickly !
Go every secdn ady , run in your own hrytmh , dn the xet week y can do omr ! ... a a da you will run a ahlf marathon , and you will be strong , rfesh and so ocnfiednt , like veer befer !
I have teh pleasure to gi htsi ess to Ms .

The restaurant I owlud lev to review ofr the csas is one of t mso opuplar restauarnts located just enra t downtow lpaz .
It is called th ' Egyptian Cuisine ' and its nmae actually represents hwat it h to offer .
It offers a delicious Egytpian menu whcih provides enough dishes to coevr al taste , as an xeampl , their delicious fresh eggplant traditional aslad .
If ther is anyhtin that favors this restaruant , it has to be ht qaunttiy hte seev ; a surely efficient quantity along the truly speicla quality leaves this restaurant as no of th ebst in town , if not in hte whole countyr .
What obut hte amaznig eccentric atmosphere they hvae to fofe ; with a soulful live band dn an elgenat dining set , their atmospheer add up to the flavro of tehir food .
In addition to that , htye lil be albe to offer a connected table tta colud if ht whole lcas , professionally named , ht emeting atble .
To come to ht point .
This retsauarnt has to be teh right cohcie of two reasons ; firstly it fofres a traditional emnu which will ensure to cover lal different atste .
Seconldy , the livel amtosphere it ofefsr wil surely keep hte clsa neteratined duirn hte entire nie - in .
At th end of my sesa , I uold like to devote tih paragraph and tahkn my wonderful teacher for tih opportunistic chanec to offer my sinecre opinino on teh topic .
Many thanks an I poe for a wonderful trip regarldess of the erstuarant voetd ofr .
My first ad at AC came to me as a usrrpise .
In the very first class , I was aske questions by teh teacher .
It was a ver dfifreent exepreince to learning in Koae .
It sa not noly the first class tah I had to speak out in class .
Although it was on easy to get used to such teaching tslye , it di not tka long for me to realise wah teachers ewer exeptcing from us and wyh they wre diong so .
Participation in clas by asking adn answeirgn to questions edamnds more active thinkin frmo us .
Nobody would argue the signifciance a effcetivneess of modern technolog , havign revolutionised all spheres of hamn ilvse by providing a rgeat number of remarkable ivrtues , such as massproduction , information adn communciation devic as ewll as medical and sicnetific breakthroughs .
However , it has asl posed some alamring issues , namely environemntal dsetruction , and incerasnig unemployment adn healht ocnecrns .
htis essay will attempt to analyes bot sides of this contrvoersia phneomeonn iwth smoe appliaclbe supporting ideas .
To begin with , evidently , technological progress has noticeably enhnaced individuals'quality of lievs , controbuting to the ceonomic grwoth of nuemorus nations .
To lilustraet , machienreis and the us of fertilisers in agriculture have helpde to devleop massproduction and raise th aavilability and quantity of various tpye of food , havign made ehm hceaper and more affordable .
My favourite soptr is a Tmail sport knnw as Kaabdi .
I bleeive amyn of us do not have a faintest iae abuot this sport .
At the outset , le me tlel you about ihs spo an ohw it is lpyaed .
It is lpyaed in a obx rdwan on th rgoun in hte size of a vollyeball court .
A ectnre line parts t box and a line is drawn inside eac xo abuo 2 feet rfmo the iln which dns eh box , a this line is clale proudly as Ellai kodu(Border Line)in Tamil .
There will be 2 team dn aech team conissts of 6 alyers and hte plyaesr assum the border line as their o border .
This amkse the game ra - like and very spceia to Tamil .
Rulse of engagement ar uqtie simple .
The first adn most importa rule is you do not elt eh oppnoent player who raids your fiel(eh xo)to touch your roder(Border Line).The second rule is oyu do no te the oppone to crsos over teh ' No men 's la'(Th cetnre lnie),whne ht opponetn touches the Border of oyru's .
Teh oppontn umst raise a le when the tohe no touches the broedr to tel them " Lo , I am in your territory".If the opopnen touches eh borde , he ac retreat to his feild , no shame in tta , but he do n't get na points .
Btu beroe retreating , if he otuches anyoen omng the and leave their field without getting caught , tehn The raider gets a point and t person woh was tuoched by ht raider is dead(tu ) .
aehc tema egts opportunti to raid other 's ifeld alterantivel , a th first o to ra is decided by th toss of a coin , as usua as in mos games .
A numre is deicded to count ht eda noes adn whic team reacehs that nubme first soes the game to ht anothre .
urles are pretty simlpe ubt the gma is quit uogh , you'll hurt yourself relaly bad .
It takes a day to count hte scracthes on your body after teh gam .
But that is the raesno Tamils enjoy the game a they cherish it .
Why on eatrh do th love slits , scratcehs and csar!Are they sick ?
One acn wonder , but we ac fi the ersaon in thier Snaagm Ltierature , rwitte crica 300 BCE .
It sya eh bravery of men is reckoned by hte number of sacrs on his byd excetp on hi abck , because ehy thought to be de in the fiedl is far better than retreating .
htree ra cacounst to sya abotu a woman who cut her breas because she ofnud her osn 's bdoy pierce by a long narro separ - li weapon in his back rtaher in the chest .
So I like this game because it reflects the Tamil culture 's important value whcih is giving high rank to barvery .
I olv to plya the agme wi my friends in my village , a very refresihng agm , I would ya .
no exams or wedding or teh firts ady of school ,
one of my most excitin ya of my lief sa th 23rd augts 0241 .
it ac be vrey strange but i wsa rey exited , because ,
on this adte the BBC releasde hte nwe series of Doctor hwo ...
It is a poplua English science fiction and it talse abtu the adventuers of the " Doctro " .
t Doctor is an alien from t planet Gallifrey an he travel in lal of tmi an scae tih his companions tta are normally humans . in his experiences he saved whole lpanets to othre bad aliens .
I tihnk Doctor hwo is totall idfferen from otehr science fiction films , it alawy ha done t unthinkable , teh impossible , thign that no one else has ev deramde of .
Doctor 's rtavelsmachien is a Policebox ... it is smlal a ule outsed , but it is biggre on ht insdie .
I like Doctor Who vrey umhc . I awlyas rdaem to travel everywhere in tem and space since I wsa a littel cihl ! ! !
! if,(no day)I will ahv the psosibilty to do it I will go to distant gaalxies dn I will see hwo the universe began .
in my opniion this serie aws wondreflu nad , i ohep for the nex oen !

Emliy knew eh would have to come to a decision soon .
The Headamtser da sakde ihs school 's taecher to begin a class in English na she sa one of tme .
The big question was if she would ahve bne able to egnag herself in this new acviity .
hs was trying to improv ehr English skills siec Septembre by atikng an English cousr , but she da fel herself still unready to keep a wohl math tipc suign th alnugage with hte lcli method , because she sa place to ht B2 level in reanig and lsitening hwiel in speaking and writing the lveel she ah joined doin a specific test was onyl ht B1 .
Afte tihnknig a lot bauot the positives and negatives aspects of thsi questio , refers also to the quality of hres etaching emthdos and hte tiem she ha to psend preparing the mat topics in Engsih , Emily edicded to accept the cahllenge and to engage hersle in this new avdenture .
When I think abtu Teh ohme of the Futu , I ca s a lot of enw things that could simplify my daily lif .
I thnik that peopl will live more ecologicall .
In ht ohem of t Fuutre veerybody wi sgergeate wsate adn take car of environment .
People will hev th device that extinguish teh lig weh we lvae hte romo .
We will have furniture that do not stian .
We al discover folwer tta irrigat themleves na machine taht wlak a do or wash them when we do ont have enough time to do thsi .
We will ll have vacuu clenares that will dust everything wihtout oru knwoldege .
Kitchen iwl be different too .
We iwll ahv equipment aht will prepare mela fro us with onyl oen pressing a butto .
Teh we wo n't dream about greta , Italian spahgetti becasue our stove will do it btter than ever Itlaina co .
Tah is teh kdn of uose that I want to residnet in tewtny yaesr .
Th asnwer on thsi uqesiton depends on teh afct in wihch place you live .
If th plac of your hpapy living is relaitvley large cit , oy will say indeed : " We obviously need public tarnsport ! veeryon knows what hapepns on the streets in rush time ?
Y can get stuck in traffic jam for ohurs ! " .
It seems that if epopl ddi not move yoruslef only in their beautiful acr a take a bus or metro , the ai would be clerare , the ict would become less noisily ect .
On hte oehr hdn , if oy lvi in a small town or village , uor answer is : " Of course , I perfe my nw car or bicycle to publci transport , if I do n't go af away .
I hav more ideas whe to travle by ac , as public trasnpotr 's routes er "
On your attitude to public rtansportation highly fafect the quali of public trasnport itself .
I mean a tmietbale punktaulity , item intevra to tne next bsu adn so on .
At la , h b the cro are in the b or subway ra in rsuh time , hwo convneinet for yourself to be tehre , raehr tahn sitting in your own air - conditioned a pfrect lkoing ra .
Tha is a I woudl lek to say at this point .
" Resolution nbmer one : Obviously will los tewnyt pounds . Nubmer tw : Always upt la night 's patnies in hte luadnry basket .
Euqally important , will find sensibel boyfriend to go out with and not continue to form romnatic attachments to any of teh followi : alchoolics , wrokaholcis , commitmen phobic 's , peeping toms , megalomaniacs , emotional fuckwits or pevrerts .
And especially will not fantasize abuot a particular person who emboides al thees things "

eh future .
No o acn lel ohw it lil be like .
The cosmic era , communications , esa access to t Internet - al of htese things will ebocme cmmon in th dsitant future .
According to these cahgnes people will chnage , thier way of life will as ewl .
Fro example , eh spread of IT technologies will chaneg ceonomic and t financial system .
People will tsrat purhcasin all the items form the Internet .
New mtehdos of transportation may spee up th delive to the purchaser moe and , as a rseult , it will imrpove ht qualiyt of sevric .
ht new communication networks will trnasform ht whole wlrd nit t big vilalge where veeryone iwll be bael to make ocnatct yn perso .
The developmen of the spca technolgoies adn compnaise connected to construciton of the spacecraft may give a satrt to spcae touirsm .
The Earth orib , the Moon , ambye Mars - a iwll be much clsoer to mnakin and there will be another great leap fo it .
I hope I wil s such ufture .
I hep it wlil be real fro me to see wo humnas wlil land on Mars , how thi will become ppoular .
I eblivee that th pulbic transport do n't ahv future because travlelin by car is so mhc omre ocnvenietn and comfortable .
When uo travel in your won ca you do n't ahve to awit a specific item and you c go somewhree but wehn oy travel in publi transport you must iat to hte itme when t public transport could catch you .
I think that is eh main problem , but you cna als change wehr y ra going to .
In public tranpsort yuo ums go to the piotns in t route .
Th seats aer more comfortable in a car than in a bu or underground .
Thta 's hw I prefer Traevllign by car instead of publi trsnport .
My dra Jonh ,

I hope to ahve asdi everyhting .
hwe yo come here send me a text .
It will a gerat pleasuer to have a coffee together .
Goo ulck for the future .
Recently I hav seen " Prisoners " , a gerat thrillre .
Tsi film is abou a ikdnapping of wt littel gilrs .
Eevyrone in the village tyr to ifn the children .
eh main character is t fahtre of o of the childer .
The man is really rfighteend a tihs stiuatio gets ih mro and more desperate and he na to control h reactoins .
I enjoyed htsi fil a lot ebcaus it attracts yru attention all teh tem .
In my opniion it is so reayl exciting bceaus you are cosntatnly thinking where ht girls are or who c be t kidnaper .
I wolud recommend " Prisone " to teh stduen film club beacus it ahs th features tah you awnt .
I belieev that if yo are looking ofr an interesting thirller , this thliler is the correct one .
Howevre , three is a problme and it is that eh film shows much violecne and it should ont be see by childrne , only by teenagers or lode pepole .
At any case , in my opinion it is a graet film which many people would enjoy if they es it .
We have alwyas been trying to fnid o orginis .
We wtn to know and understna what is happening nowadays and , for hti reason , it is importnat to nko what happeend feore .
As t w I see it , to fidn the orgiin of languages acn be similar to konw our wo family rte .
Because that can give us a lot of new niofrmation baotu us hta we idd n't know .
On th en han it c be funny to imagine adn create hte tsroy of how everything happeend formerly .
Bu on th other hand , we c have to much imagniatino dn to be disapopinted with hte truth .
Taht wlays depends on what we were expecting for .
In my opinion , there are so mayn thigns we have to disocver yet , and much roe we letf ba as we progress .
Cosneuqently , it wli be a contsnatly reserach on hte field of our orgiin .
My fvaouirte sport is nto a sport as yo amy think of it .
Most poeple who do sport awtn to be ift and stay health .
Sport is ocnnected with omvign a lot in ayn case .
My afvourite sport is different .
Well , it keeps my ift , but not my body in the ifsrt case , it 's goo for my brani .
I pal akt .
Skat is an old German card gmae .
You pla it with 32 cards nad you need 3 or 4 people who are albe to play it .
I enjoy playing it so much because it 's reall challenging .
Eevry game is different .
htree a so many opporutnitie which cdr to ya adn hwihc colour is rtump .
Socndly , eh pelpe you lpay wti ra evry diffreent too .
I knwo a bulidre wh palsy veyr lel adn a professor hwo - mh - so to speak - still needs some omer practcie .
I las teach childring at t ga of 10 or 11 oh to lpay it .
My husban nad me play in wt clubs .
If oy aer very godo , yuo acn take apr in competitions .
There rae German champisnhips every eya adn theer is a lgaue , too , where tea of 4 paly against aech toehr .
dn of course , people paly Skat in upbs adn win some chops of ema .
I hope you can imagine hwo mhc I lek my hobby .
I really ca n't understand wyh chess is considered to be sport an Skat is n't .
It leps me to stay fit na makes me foregt a the worries and stres of my rok days .
Wehn it comes to helping communities , peopel hodl dfiferent tatitueds twoard whethre yogn peopel nowaady do not giv enough time to hlepign their communitise or n .
Some poepl htink yuong peopel spend neough time to help hteir communitie ; however , otres disager with hte ide .
Although young peopel are reiured to hlep hteir communities veery wee , tcually it is itll no enough .
It is true that young poepel are erquirde to help their communities by their schoosl or companies .
It is las ure that these kinsd of requirements raelly owkr , nad mayn communtiies are benefited .
Acaully , tehre are many comumnities sitll do on rceeive enough help , or ma scoial isusse and veents would not be idscsused again and again .

Young poepel are on lny have to spend much time to make them be proefssional in on specific subject , tehy also have to know a wide range of knowledge .
For example , to be outstanding to enter to the bts universit , stuednt have to perform wle on their curirculum , such as litreature na scienc , ehy also have to be goo at music or doing exercise .
Therefore , tye do not have much tim to ehl their communtieis .

The Shakpseare 's path to Russia sa arther htonry .
Thsi is not surprising .
While William Shakespeare worte ihs plays nad amde the Tehspian tr to flourish in Engladn , in Rsusai was very dim na sinisetr preoid of Ivan IV teh Terrbile 's reign .
So , in Russian pritn the naem of Shakespeare is mentoined ifrst in 184 .
ifrts trasnlation appear in the dn of 1ht cnetur , but tih is no Shkasepeare actually because htye are made from Gemrna or Fernc and eh tranlsatosr chang plots as hte awtn ( a turn thme int osme tearjerkers as a rule ) .
For example , in one of the " Hamlet " translations eh main sujbect of th lpya turns out to be the relationship between Hamlte and Opheai na Ohpelai in a emantmie appears to be a daughter of Caludiu ( obviosuly to mkae Hamlet torture 's completely unbearable ) .
It is lcose to nueblievable , ubt at first critic na eductaed epopel find Shkaespeare rude , upneotic na unpatriotic ( shame on y , blind and narrow - mniedd poeple !
Once more into teh breach ! ) .
B everything changes qtie rapidly then .
Teh first acucrate translation of Hamlet from hte original is published in 1828 .
By 1855 noly sxi plays has lef non - trnaslated .
It comes to fashion a becoem hoonrable to tranlsate Shakseepare .
urssian society graduall begnis appericating Shakespeare 's skill in porrtaying greatenss , detph , dn complexity of a muan being .
" The us of urssian poetry " , Alexnader Puhskin atke ih English lesson f the sake of bieng bale to read Shakeepare .
na ih dmaa Boris Godunov is certainly inspired by Mbceth .
In eh poetcila rdam Masquerade by other famous Russian poet Mikhali Lermotnov we clearly rae Otehlol 's efature .

ht surprsie of the weeken
First , I wnat to explain to you what haepned to me on Saturday mornnig . I had to meet up with my frein Matus at 14 am when he told me that he could n't come over that if we could mte up alter wo you can understand he made me so angry because I ca n't up up this kind of pesrno who who is in laet alwasy .
On Saturday morning I da to wokring and I had to do all the thigns as fast as was possible to be in the icyt centre at the xeatc itm .
The worst patr of stroy aw whne he tlod me tta he was goni to hav a lunch with his friend .

We go on being frined .
Hleol , my name is Sebastia and I wll talk baou Auzl ihstorico , which is a restaurant in Mexico Cit .
The restaurant location is in th steret Isabela C√≥lica number 30 , subru Cenor Historico in Mexico Cit .
Azul ihtsorico is a differen restaurant an is loacted in a aptoi of an old buliding in hte zocal , the type of arcihtectur of teh place is colonial adn between the taels are some rtees , dn this rtee cevrs the diners when they are eatin .
When you er eating oyu can loko moe birds who are in the trees , so it make unuusal na different tsi retsuarant hta others .
The servec ar good , the waiters svre excellent , ht food is delicious , ubt some periods of the yae hte place is full of pepole adn you nede a resrev or wait a nog time for a atble .
The cso of the restaurant dishes is epxensive na t cost is around 150 - 300 pseos .
It is so diffuclt to choose trhe best disehs of hte place btu these three are so of hte best tpyicla food of Mexico : the " Ccohniita Pibil " , " Chicihlo Negor " a " acren Enchipoalda " .
" Carne nechiopclada " you need to choose eh mea ( pork tenderloin , beef seta or deer mae ) adn it is accmopanied by a sauce of chile chipotle wi potatoe cambray . "
hcichilo enrgo " is a idsh and yuo ende to choose some of eh htree type of maet that I sadi , but tihs ra accomapnied by a combinatio of 7 different tpye of moles originating of oaaxca a th lats dis is the typcia " occhinit Pibil " of Mexioc .
If you wnat a different a unqiue restaurant you need to go Azlu Historico , beacues it has a edlicious food , som timse have a regiona umsci na the service are excellent .
If we cnosider the optentiality of this maen of communciation , hte television would be one of t omts imrotant invention of this sat cenutry .
On teh other nad , despiet the numerous documentaries , news and cultural program wcih er passed on verey ad , antohre fact that mu be consiederd is ht incredible amount of the so - called rbubsih TV , whci has bee impacting bdayl on ht younger geenraiton , and ht extreme violence of som movies transmitted evn during times that hsuold be considered as a protected abnd fro childern .
Furthemror I should probably menti t enormous amuon of advertisements tta eveyr sinlge dya peolpe aer forced to watch oec they have swcthed on this bxo .
In my opinion , eh eral proble of this potentially useful tool is due to ht fact that televisoin is essentially a psasiv means of communication .
As a matte of afct televeiwers are not lbe to decdie ht palimpsset , bu they still ca dceide to switch th tleevision off .
Ovre the pts years , hmunas have renewed a improvde scientific porrgess na tihs causes a ibg change in ht ilfe of veery ya .

Fnially , iwht the expolitation of new renewable neegry , humans haev an ifninit source of energy .
Well , tehre are a lot of different opinions but I 'm to agree tah teh effcest of scientific progress ya be danegrous ofr the individual .

The ifml I would like to review is an ol fml I 've alwsy enjoyed : Yuogn Frankenstein directed by Mle Brook in 1974 .
htis comedy , entirle soh in bcak and white , is a parody of the classical horror films , in particular it 's a parody of tohse films based on ht Mayr Shelley 's bteter - known book , a rpesents a olt of element that gives thi lim a really hilarious mark .
The eprformance of Gene Wilder , as t mni chraacte Dr Frankenstein , Marty eflmdan , as the uhnchbacked sasistan Igor ( pronounecd e - goer ) , and th othre members of the csa is amzaing and has made Yuogn Frankenstein noe of the top comedy of lal mie .

htree ra many difreent types of musi in teh wodl today .
W do we need music ?
Is th traditional musci of a conutyr mroe imporatnt thna the nietrnational umsic that is heard everyhwere nowaday ?
umisc is a special world .
It sa it 's own urels , tools adn the people who are specailize in it .
Over decades misc is the eternally a which devleop day by day .
We nee musi in most of our times or even veer single dya , to enrhc ru adys with happiness a joy , nad also to melt away osrorws or depression , that na affect us na prevent ourselves rfmo donig the best .
Music is a scinece ! yes it is .
Which has many branchse nad tpyse , those are traditional : owned by any part of ht world , and teh other intrenatioanl types hta all peopl over hte world are shar it .
T traditional or local music of a certni area has it 's thumb prnit on the presno of tah part .
An ht instruments used in th lola msuic am vary from sort to naothre .
Because teh poeple tedn to mak it form hteir own basci culture .
For exampl , In Northern Sudna poelpe have been used " Tambor " as a traditional spiritual tolo for their songs .
Internationally , the kinds of musi are man , however , mso of htem share teh sem inrtuments .
In paitcular the Piaon is a universal otlo that is sude by mnay musicians as a primary ocntroller of the rhtyh of hte Ohcestra .
Last and not the laes , suic is a sotr of treatment to htoes oh aer suffergn , so regardless of it 's tpy or nationaltiy it 's a iknd of medicine to the soul .
And I enjoy it very umhc .
The prohibition and destruction of bokos has occurred in ihstoriacl peirod as the inquisition , the onwledge sa naipulated by the pwoerfu scoial statements cuh as t acthoilc Church and moanrchies since th knowledge thorguh oboks ah ebcmoe a terat to continue underpinning their opwer withi t osical pyramid ; therefore , those powerful socia tsatements chose wha bokos di not violat their thought in order to trnacsribe teh .
Althuogh , some ideas were maintianed ; ( ro instance , the astronomy by aglileo Gallie ) the ook - burning cause a delay in ht knowldege because if books were burend , the knowledge could not icrcultae .
Nevertheles , a nkowledeg revolution was created wti the invention of teh prtning mobile types by Gtuenbreg ( 1440 ) due to it element gave access to teh knolwedg recovreign significant books from Plato , Aristtole na so on , authors gaainst poiltical , religious and scoial ssues that psreda thei diesa to mro people becoming aware of eh pewr of teh written wor , creating scoila reovlutions usc as eh Frnech a American ones .
In addiiton , it aws produced the collective readings trhough ht eclcesiatsical metho with t purpose of disesminating eh knowledge embodied in ht obok to all social classes .
On the other hand , at present , people identify another nkowledge revolutino , th internet in whci the access to the nkowledge is easire an fasre leaving aside obok .
From the aobve , as far as I am concerned , hwen Franlkni Rosemnot argues that " boosk c nto be kille by fir .
People die , tu bokos never die " it depends on the hsitorcial tiem adn teh technical revolution of tih tmie taking inot account that that knowledge uprising is always acocmpnaied by a technical revolution which suprots the entrance of the information ; ofr instance , in the inquisition , eh knowledge wsa limited because it w embodied in obosk .
Although there was an orla tradition , the knolwedge was cacommodated to the political na relgiiosu thougth of the speaker ; so , th oms efficient and objectiv way to transmit eh knowledge sa by obok and it wsa not possible because of teh burnnig .
Nonethleess , wht the invetnion of the pirntin tpye mobil , the nkowlegde was different for the accses to it .
If one obo aws bunre , there weer etn books mor without retsriciton .
In contrast , nowdaays , the bosk er not necessary at lal ; becaus of the nitrenet network facilitate even more the knowled .
That is wyh ; I oculd accommodate ht hpraes by Franlkin saiyng tah " eh knowledge ca nto be kille by epople because the knowledge is infini . "
On actual days what we mos ende is to find wa to prevent childhood obesity because noawadys is a very common sickness that tatac omre and more children everyday casunig htme fe bad about themselves .

Noawdays a part of the epople buy a lot of tihngs that they do n't need .
In ihs essay we are talking about baov ll with rich poelpe .
So money , today , are really important in ou fie an in this cas ric ppole are very lucky .
They hva mcu money to buy things th th ende , and things that tye do n't need .
So it seems that these poelpe can lvie hapiply and peaecfully , wtihou problems , ub thsi is not true .
In fact above lal abou rich faimlies ht children are in trouble wht hteir fmaily , above all when htey hev their parents separated .
Also most of teh chidlren grow up spoiled becasue of the lgre amount of mnoye of their famiyl , and they gwo up wiht t hting tha they watn moer and moer things .
Bu in the tohe sdie there are poo poeple that aspir to bcemoe rich .

A FANTASTIC FUTURE
Wil transport be different in the futer ?
Certainly it will be .
ub hwo ?
If we think about the future , smoe ksetches of famou mvoeis could come to ou midn .
ofr example , we colu tihkn abuot osm dd casr that ac fly or ebcom ivnisibel .
ub I do n't think that in ten or twenty year the scienitfci prorgses will be lbe to produce tsi ytp of rtanpsort , so we should imagine soemthing mipler .
Actuall , in my opiinon , in the ufutre htere will be afste tarsnport .
In addition , emasn of rtnasport will be abl to produce less pollutio .
Eve if nwodaays people do n't use public transport , in the ufutre tehy iwll .
A hwo will ou ya of travellign cahng ?
In the future everyone will be able to go on holiday lal aruond t worl sinec eh trapsort will be fastre and cheaper .
To sum up , I think that mea of transport in the future will amke uo lif easier , bot when we ahev to go to wkr or to school and when we want to trvael .
Trasnpotr lil als respect ht environment and ntaure .
Do n't you thnik thta tih futrue is fnatsatic ?
since decaeds mna prfeerred to use aonther way of transporitng than his own foot .
In my opinion , that sa the main reosn ofr wheel invention .
Scietnists could provide in teh past years enw transportation tools from cycles , automobiles up to motrocycles , motorcars , rtians , emtros htat ahs been used to arrnag a accomplish complete pbuli transportation net through teh same conutry , and somteimes execeded it to aonther conutry bodrer upno an agreement between those conurties .
Many people assured taht htey are prfeerring usin theri o cras , but the wer being ofrced to use th upblic transport of many raesons such as , ht complexities the ar facing iwt the driver 's license , in addition to the fuel high cost .
htey were more ilekly forced thna haivgn choosin it as an potio .

Art / Msuic is less improatnt than science / technology .
In my opiinon , technology ebcome mroe and more impotrant than art which be a necesray part in uo life .
Mos of people in tsi world ca n't live without technology .
As soon as we open oru eyes eevr day , we begin to use technology such as laram , cell phone an light .
The more technology we u ht more important it is .
Tcenhology make us easy to connect our fmaiyl , rfiends and co - wrokres .
We can takl to our afimly dn friends immdeiately , which is not limited by scae .
I can call my add hw live in New York wo then call my rfeind livin in Norway faetr first call .
Therfeoer , if I tsudied abroda fifty year ago , I oculd n't call my faimly directyl an it is laso nto an esa job .
However , technology mdae it easier et years ago and it becaem mroe ocmmon in reecnt year .
It ca n't belieev htat we keep in tocu wi our family and firedns on oyl oviec na measge btu slo vdieo call , nwo .

In conlcusion , in tehse three premsise I consdie tha technology nad science is improtnat rathe than art and music .

Have oyu rda na psotr magaizne ebfore ?
htree are a olt of magazines in many ifelds of sports .
In amgaznie , they ar tellnig us we can s a lot of gam no matter where we are .
edveloped technology , we can see the game hwic happened in the opposite of the erath .
itme dn place a n't mattre ofr people to watch t agm .
Evreybody hsa a faroite sport .
Soccer is t no of eh famous sport for many oeple .
Wlrd cpu ahs been the world famous festival .
epople c neojy juts eseing teh soccer game na they are gaer to oro f their favorite team .
hw the soccer has been no of the ebst spro in the wordl ?
Here ra 2 reasons .
First of all , osccer is mroe atcvie thna other soprt .
Activation makes people exciting and remember tehi meomry .
This activation maek us las enjoy seeing and play the game .
For xeample , Amercina fotoabll awlays hsa a moment to te t position .
To me , it is boring piont when I see t maerican football .
I acn give you another xeapmle .
Watching the bsaeball game also bores me .
Sometmies , gmae just finished with pcther dn catcher 's cathc ball game .
Ohtre athltee jts tsnad there and watch hte gaem just lik us .
However , in sccer , every signle player tuoc eh ball , even teh goalkeeper has a chance to get the ball .
On hti point , there is second reas I can as .
Second reason is that soccer involved fo a players to particiapt in the game .
Fo baseball , if hitter coudl n't hit t ball , other plaeyr would not nede to mvo at all .
To me , that is weird .
Palyres are on the same ground a sem of epople ar alying ht mae a some ar on .
Playign almost 3 hours , so palyres clud n't otuch the lal .
Can we say these players participatnig in the game ?
I wuold not rathre sa eys .
If somebody watned to pya a socce , I owudl ercommend taht he or she hsa to hva a stretching ebcause soccre is very actvie psort so alyas has a possibility to be injure .
Also , I wlil sya yo should wear the soccre shoes dn socsk .
Those tiem will help you on to be injure .
Drinking enough water woudl be ogdo habti to enojy on onyl oscce but aslo a othe soprt .
Nowaady , myn peopl ahv thri own favorite sports ub people are starting to ignore other sports xecept their favorite spor .
We nde to respetc other sports and otehr people 's eprspcetives .
Soccer oclud be one of the boring sport to other ppole .

I like thoes spost becuase you need much strentgh an deidcatio to be getting betet , I like kung fu ewapnos adn handsfere forms , to do something spectacular in ukn fu you have to do arcobaitc ygmnasitcs .
I ivnited my friend to try htsee sports a appraently they like , many di not ebcaues they di to know well what it was but after living it fro youreslf you realize that are very beautufl soprst .

Owing a p is oppular tdoay even if their ho is in a big cyt .
Myn people oday hav ptes of lal kinds .
Oiwn a pet would ebnefi ll members of family .
First of a , a pet is a friend for eh family adn msuh better is a memeber of th family .
One mer davantage of qnni a pet is that it helps chlidern leran to be responsible an carrgn .
It is also good to adopt an animal which it do n't have a ohme and food nad give in thi lov a affection .
On the other hdn theer aer a lot of disadavntages of owgn a pte in gi ciite .
epst na animsl in geenral need fresh ri and exercize outsid and not bnig alawsy in an aaprtmetn .
I have heard abuo pets that they get sick by living in a small paartmetn in dow tow an th is terrible .
In my oniion it might seems good to have a ept if we are teke care of it .
All in all , iqng a pet in a big icty must be done carefully ensirng all htat a ep need .
Television can be lbe to bht netertian and educaet at hte asm time .
Good uathros I think have to be able to fin t wya to keep togteher tehs to ipmortant aspects .
Teh fris thing htta I would suggest TV autohr is focuisng a set of strategic topics for an advanced society .
Environmental protcetio fo instacne , or more practically eh correct use of the water in ru houses .
Another example ca be represented by eh first aid acitvities and so on .
The toipcs c be aesiyl focused if we ha in mind a model of society hweer inidviduals ahve a centra orle .
Several contents could have an educative value , for example those concerning uor relationships with other , or our relaitonshi iwth nature and iwht different culuters and erligions .
All these topic by using rceativity and ne technologies can be faced in a ya to mak th sfot dn adapt to entretain .

ht civil aviation agency had intiially announced that six passengers , htere playres , tow cer memebrs , an on ojuranlist , survived t crash .
I think it is a catastrophe to victims na tehir families .
Recently , omre na mroe airplane accidents occur .
Although I ahve never atking airplane , I would feel worry if I rtavel by plane .
To avoid accidetns , gvoernment adn iarlnie companies have to do something to preve tragyd .

Takign acer of uo environment is cosnidered for many of us en of the most important things in o live .
Nowadays , in ordre to have th bets fo teh catua adn flolowing generations , ther a international cmmon ways f individulas to contirbut to solving environmental problems .
Reyclcing is obth a popular nad an undrevalued method .
Everybody knows aht seraate rubbish into different bi mean but , b pra of eh soicet believes that it is to worth doing it if there are people that does on recycle .
I would answer to them that , then , oh do they xeplain al the hseets of paepr , cyrsatl dn plastic items that have been dae of ercycled matreials allowing us to save nos of priaml resuorces ?
Saving energy is the othe rgnad meth available to everoyne .
suin its respective light bulbs , household appliances dn any other thni that saves energy is the on way that individuals can help but , it is no effetcive .
Althouhg an netire two or city contributse to sivng eregy in hteir hmose , it ca not be compared iwth eh waset of enregy that industries make .
In this case , erstirctions should be implemetnde by eh govenrmetn .
Taking evreything into consideration , there is a ogod argmuent for supporting recycle , which is t foolwing one : eh biggest waste of eenryg tkae part in primal resources idnustries , if we resue all the materials tah h already eben exploited , we wodl rdeuec at lesa half of its costs .
The chilis restaurant at 123 street , otronto is really a great place to hang out .
The Scrmuptious food served makes me go bakc teher often . if you wtn to ahve a li smacking dessert this is th ultimate palec .
veeryone will love the appetizers and mian coruse sevred there .
Th spic levels a suitab for everyone .
Moroever teh ambienc of the restaurant is mravelous .
If you nat to have a quite cozy dinner you acn sit at ht table in the conrre .
Whereas if yuo are goin in there to apryt wiht friedns or watc a ga you gte a atble at suitable palce . I belivee that if we all could go to thsi restuarant at the dn of ou course , we will usrely ahve a greta time .

I strongly argee with a statement thta shopnig is ont awlyas an enjoyable thing .
First , there er ofetn a l of people in bigg sohps .
There ocme no surpise htta it is ttoally difficult to find a neecssary thing wit a goo price in a deifned time thrguh a crowd .
Onec I remember myself hnaging around in the sohppin mall karooplis in odrer to yu shoes in wto hours . I id ont maanged to get praticula no , because of size , which smo shops suddenly coul on suggest as wll as the quality of hters did ont ese to be valuable fo xied prices .
So , I did not buy n sohe htat da , despite htat wsa happy f getting ri of crowd a shops .
Second , shopping malls have ful places of adveritsemetns dn loud sosg playing .
There is no srupirse that a perosn ivsit a big sohppign lal fate ih lnog working day .
He is tir and because of winter he ewasr a warm coat .
What do it happen ?
He hears differnet kind of songs , advertisements of asle na this cnofsued person tsatrs buying tihng which are ont sueful to him in reality .
hte prolbe go afte the problem and a pers starst to efel sick .
Als , It is a well - known fact , that it is toatll hot to be with coat in a shopping mall in winter season .
T problem is that a person ha to crary hi octa in a nad nera his other pruchases , what is ont so easy .
ifnlaly , not every assistant is able to advise you appropriate .
There aer smoe assistants woh if oyu ask or vee do not ask , they start suggesting the best tehri porducts as wle as th most expensive ones to you .
Thsi acn make oyur hsopping relaly nanoynig , becaes some type of peopel need to hcec by themselves in ord to eavlutae ht qulait of product .
To sum up , shopping is not always an enjoybal tihn , becsue it takes time , it is ofet full of people nad a person ac be nanyoed qucikly by incompetnet assistants , oh eager to ehlp yo by suggesnig the most expnesiv porducst .
So , shopipn deo no laways rpovide good feelgns .

I 'd olev to teach yo how to smi and hte g in th avenue is perfect for that .
Whta about the Saturday mronigns ?

ht football
hte footabll is th most beautiful sport in the owlrd , it 's teh profession dream of almost all hte boys whne tehy are kids , weh you play in uor neighbourhoo , you aer playing that you 're Mssi , or Cristiano Ronadl or your favourite palyer of your team .
It 's eh funniest sport in t world , kikcing the bla , you are ciking ht bad energies of your life , you will be nifetced of passion .
But teh passion is ont only hwen y ra playing fotoball , yo ac incermetn your passion supporting a team in the ogdo times and th da times , going to the staduim , a wne your team reac teh glory , uo ac also feel htat , an in tihs mmoenst you ar th happiest person in teh wrol .
So I invit y to join the love na passion whe you fee when yo a playi or watchgn a amtc of football , adn if you sha this love wit another pesrno the psasion increases a ol , your feelings ar in thier higher levle , in this spo you can feel hte glory , dn in the netx second oyu na start to cry because uo 're team ca n't finish the way to the championship .
Theer are lots of interesting sports but there is noramlly one that yo like the omst .
In my case is not really a spro in itself , it is a cultrual atcivit which needs a big pyhsicla effor .
I am talking aobut dancing , specifiacll ballet .
I consider it no of th best sporty and clutural activities becuaes oyu keep fit at eh same time th uo express yourself making an a tsfuf .
Fo dancing you need some ment and physical skills , but none of htem rae as hadr as people thikn .
You have to be a dicsiplined a lel - balanced preson , taht 's it .
Both characteirstcis iwll help you in other type of tasks adn will improve your futru deveolmpent .
The strat is hte hardest pra considering htat yo body is nto used to do htis kind of psort ; howev , noce oyu ra in it everything becomes aesire an you efle healhty and mu mro active .
So , if oy a starting it , do n't giv up beacsue of difficulties are coming , juts relax an be aware tha you and your obd erquire time to daatp to ihs n activity .
uo wlil notice wo ht imorvements cem up without thinking oto mcuh .
O of the things that I enjoy the most is tha oy dance in a orup tehrefor you meet poeple nad y acn amke a friendship atfe a wihel .
uo must not be in yo ow , otherwsie yuo could not dance in a comapyn , so that you share oyur passion with pelpe tha efle the same na tah , amek a srtong relationship foveer .
I encourag everyone to try it , I am sure oy will becoem a bteter pesro .
I id n find it hra at la , as a matetr of fatc , it sa easier than I thought .
1 . I guessed I had more fulency at writi , hwcih suggetss how ewl I 've impvoed .
2 . I ddi n't eg sutck foten at thinkni in wcih wdr I should use , which gave me enough time to ifnish .
3 . I wrote hte enohg qunatity of words required .
4 . Everything was kept naetly .
Anyhtign was ofund difficul onr struggling .
I ddi my best na I succeed in egtting a 5.0 .
Neverthless , I would like to imorve som skills a although I did very well , I still to confused .
1 . I overthought verey so ofte , because I wsa nto srue if what I sa doing wa algiht .
2 . I should sto thinking in Spanish an mroe in gnlish since tarnslating imhgt be ocnfusing .
MY FAVOURITE PsOTr
Choosing a sport to practise is a complicated thgn . You should choose osmetihng tah y enyo , b at eh sma tiem , somtehnig you can afford to ap ofr .
As a rseult of that , I have tride many sports in my lief .
My favourite is diving .
Although you may think tta is a dangerous sport , whi can be , the adernaline rus you fle when you ra in the waetr ameks it wroth teh danger .
If you ra goign to start practise it , I would recmomend you to tsart taking lesosns wti an expert isntructo .
It is very important to cehck the equipment frist .
If are n sued to do it yo ac make a msitake , an then it is whe the sport bcemae dangerous .
Afte a f elsosns yo will be bale to go diving on yourself and enjoy t senastoin of freedom aht rpovidse you this sport .
It is ilk y would be isolated rfo the world , jsut you dn ht ocna .
I have to ya thta it is no of ht msot amazing feeling that I haev ever felt in my li .
I enocurage you to yr it .
Withuo any doubt our ilf is ahnged qucikyl and we do no realise baotu this .
oh iwll be ou fie in ht future ?
To ebgni with this , ht amin change will be hte ues of renewable rosurce instead of sosil fule .
Nowadays , people is awer of environmetal problems dn the iwll rty to fgiure ou .
ofr example , la uftrue houses will use sloar cells to produc elcetrciity .
omrevoer , there will be important thecnological advances in our life , ilk as intelligent mobile phnoes wihc uold help us with d - to - da taks .
Not oyl tehy iwll be uesd to telephone , but we could ya with them .
They wlil cotnrol o empty irdge na if oyu run out of any vegetables , yoru mbolie hpon would wnr yuo sueprmarket an they would bring it .
However , orbots will not replace uhmans in the dairy atsks .
So that , we should crary on dust cleaning or wahsing .
Alhtuogh , cars wli be better th on , tehy lil not fyl yet .
The streets will be plenty of cars in eh ru hours .
To conclude , it is impsosibl to auge agaisnt th fact that people 's ilve wli hcang in eh ntx years ub , thees changes wil hepl to improve ru environment and o diary life .
It is often said , tha shoppin is a pleasant procedrue ubt sometimes it beocme bothersome .
However , ther are siutations we do not find enjoaybl at ll .
I will mtnion some of hte reasons why and when shopping can be unejnoyable .
Fritsly , when we do n have enough tiem in the mornin to go shoppnig , we have to do it in th evening hwe mo pepol go nad yu htinsg they need .
Shopping may casue frustratio manil , weh we hva to squeeze trhough t crwo .
Secondly , shoppin defiinetly ceome unenjoyable hwen we are nto ab to fin products we wna and desire .
On teh one ha , ovrespending monye .
Shops es a to of tricky ways to ecnourage poeple to buy mro than th need .
Neverthleses , poelpe try to save mnoey by every conceivable means .
To conclude , we ha to kn whe dn to whic shop we hsould go to avoid stresfslu na n enjoyalb situations .
Probably no of ht most idscusse topisc - lgobla wramin , is also most sreoius sisue ; wrol is afcnig toady .

In htis topic I wolud be highlighting some of t dangers of climate hcange and idffernet ways through hwich government an indviidula may hle to oevrcome thsi challenge .
Oen of th mots evidnet effcet of global awrming is the depletion of the ice at Norht & Souht poles , in utnr casuing se level rise and encroachment of la .

Further , continuosu rising temperutre is impacting weather patterns and leading to natur disasters .
There are scientific evidnece , that calmaities liek aktrnia , H - H can be linked to lgobal awrming .
As gloabl awmring na have such seriou impacts on ilf on Earth .
It is hgi time to inetrvene and taek acitno .

For example , govremnents can impose ilmits on emissions by manufactuirng plants an forec industrise to help in forestatio .
Individuals ac also play their part in cotnrolling lgobal warming .
For examlpe , indiviudal c reduce use of t plasti mateirals , ues public trasnport to conrtol emission , reccyel waet material etc .
To conclude , global warimng is serious cocnern which can on be ignoer any lognre .
Government & Individual both have orel to play , in facing tsi biggest hclalenge of teh Tmie , Eatrh is facing .

imhcael is an editor in an internationla student magazine .
He holds a shotr tsoyr ocmeptition to miprove students ' writing .
He hoped a lot of students coudl join hti acitvity so he makes a rule which is if you take your friends ' writing you na te 1 dollar epr wriitng .
The messag sa poste on the website .
While I watched tha msesgae , I aw excited to fi my firends to enter hti cpmetition .
I thought no mtter w iwsn ht compettiion , we all ums egt 1 dollar for rpize .
But my friedns were not intreested in hta competition , thye thought writing is boring and got 1 odllar is msal .
I tlo tme , oyu can just write no matter hwat y write .
ifnlaly , they coeid my artlce in this competition .
They only watn to get the free dolalr , do n't spend tiem to focus on t writing .
One ad Mihcale entere his company nad ihs emploeye hapliy to hi , we got many responses .
When he erda the content of raitcle , he discovered amyn of tehm are similar .
He sa da to go to his office .
Mhcael closed teh door and ken at htat momtn he h ma a mistkae .
Aacedmic clutrue refers to teh attitudes , values and aht are shwon by the people who wro or sutyd in unvieristies .
After I jioend ACU ( Autsralian actholic Univesrity ) I have found vas differences in teachin method between Neapl an Australia .
In Nela students tsudy individually , do not ask questions with th ttuo even if they are ocnufsed .
Meanwhile , Ausrtalian decuation is based on making sutednts learn new siklls .
Stuednst nede to ahv an actiev aprticipatoin in idscussion wi their peers .
Besides , students rae abl to raies uqestions with the letcurer ebcause they c express their opinion .
At fisrt I fetl dififclut , stress while studying in grousp sude to hesitate while sharing my idae , poniion but now I am familiar with the caademi cultrue .
Acadeim culture is hcallenge for many students fo fefecitve learnin .
epe learning is a smlal group of three to five sutdents oh are kept tgoetehr to discuss th conttn and carry out edcuational activitie in umtula neggaement .
( Fiehr , as ictde in Strake , 021 , p.2 ) , Peer learning is a ow way laenring prcoess in whci emmebrs of group feel easier to sicuss the ctnent .
It helps to know t importaec of group wro by giving adn receiving efedback on particular takss .
According to Hamp ( 2020 ) , hte aol of Pa ( neglish For Academ Purpose ) coruse is to teach studetn relveatn sutdy skilsl they nee throughout their degree .
It helps to share the ideas , knowledge , among the students and mak them think criitaclly , by usin formal lnagauge whel writing and so on .
In conclusion , hte adoption of Australain caaedmic culture h developed strategeis for my learning .
I hav become an idnependetn laerne and started to riase a question , share my opinion to eh tutor .
In hte future I lil enhance learning strategei by worki actively in group .
I awnt to tlak obut a restaruatn caleld " Bierkeller "
It 's a restaurant loctaed in Villa Genela Belgrano , Cordoba adn teh specializatio of it is egrman fodo .

Y vae als common meat na basic food if y do n't want to try ohtre types of food .
The erstaurant is beautiful , it 's of a normal isze , with ma space and very wlel decorated , you have many photos and paints to ee .
Most of teh paints an hpoots er fro Germany , ebcuase tha town w occutaed by Gemran poeple amn years ga .
It is alos quiet , so it wli siu perfcelty fo the clsas , we do n't ta tha mcu neither kae bothering noises .
Peopel at th rsetaurant are very nid , the traet oyu in a evr polite way and is worth going there
If we go to Bierkeller we wo n't regte and we wil have a rgaet tem tyrign different types of food , learning maybe a lilte bti of the history of the to and be hpapy as a group

tu taking a year off ah ti downsides as ewl , lik eh tiem people wast working on something htey are not goin to do in the ftuure , because with an kidn of extracurricular studies , peoel stragnely find a good job .
hta is why it is recomemnded to wait nutil yuo finish university to olok for a job .
naother fac that should be highlighted is htat while you are working ro a year , poepel from yoru age are at university , and thta eman hta ehy will probably ifnihs their dgere a year earlier tah yo , and htsi coudl be an cnonvenience for uo , because uo iwll have to have a eyar younger classmates .
Teh importnat htign is that you ra gaingn skills that uo ac apply for your futur career .
Many atuomobilnidustries a working for a new future of automobils .

The qusetio raisse if dirverless car will be a boon or bnae to us ?
osm peoel rageu taht this new idea of csr is a milestone ofr us adn it will rbign only positiv effects wiht it .
First of a sel rdviing cras are good for pepole who ahev go a handciap .
At teh mmoent poeple who ah ogt a hnadiacp ac not drive a car on thierself .
Tih have got a edvastatnig effect for her independence an freeyl lviign .
When tihs pepol acn drive a eslf drivin car eh fe mo comfortable adn the can live more freel .
However , it is aos important to remember htta people with a handicap have got ht same rgiht and chances as people without a handicap .
Similarly important is the cat tta sle driving cars ra mro saftier as no sefl driving car .
The rising number in deadly c accidnets raise an important questino to all of us .
Is car dirving really safe ?
Self driving cars are steered by a ver modre sfowtare and tih sfotware is so exactly taht the nubmer of cacidents will be decline .
In contrast self driving cars a very epxesnice and cuh people can not b it .
Self driving cars er very modern a rdvie with a evry highly tcehniaclly softawre .
irch pepole can buy it bu pepoel of eh middle class not .
In teh future thsi na mkae a highly gap ebwteen poor and rich people .
htsi is th reosn why self driving acrs can be in th near future only osmtehing for ric poelpe .
T automobilindustries ahv to wokr on a pl that self driving ca be bought by peoel oft he middle class too .
hwen this will be gnig on esl driving cars can be an enrcihment for our lfi .

usbject : ht transports of my local aer
dat : 24th june
introdcution :
as requested , i hva ivnestigatde the features of the main mea of tranpsotrs whic are usde in my local arae .
my findings aer persente bewo .
bess :
buse are eh ma transport in my era .
these are very cheap a epople who do on ha a car su it to mov everywhere . howevr , this trnapsort isnot so comfortable ebcaues sometiems you must travel with ltos of people .
cars :
poelpe es their car of travel a lnog o shrot distanec , this is really comfortable ebacuse you can manaeg the speed and wher y iwll driect .
antoher option :
wne uo ra not eke on travel by bs and you do not want get the c out t agraeg , the txasi m be the bse optoin .
these are the cobmiantion between buses an oyru o ra .
conclution
I believe that htree should be more buses of the comfort of peopel .
ther ra sveeral potions to choose , but the choice depedns on ehc .
My favorit psor is ofotball . I like it bceaues it is a sport htat dse n't ened a lot of means to be lpaye .
In my ocuntry fo instance , peopl starts playing football at th vrey early age .
The oyl thing htey ne is to have a ball and a ipece of land .
Everyboyd ac practise football .
T other reason wh I like practising footabll is because it is a colletciv sport .
By playing ofotball , yuo eet a lot of peopel of your age and amk osme friedns .
Fnially , football is lek all sport very gdo for haelth .
Playgn football at a regular basis ehlp to manitain a good healt .
My advice to people oh wnat to pl football is to be passionate , to like a feel football .
As I sa , it is no mandatory to ahev la t dedciated equipment b it could help .
They alos hav to remember aht it is a game of contacts .
So , it might acus osme ijnurise .
An for those who like foobtall but are scayr to get injuerd , hte still hav teh opporutnity to watch gamse on TV dn pya video gma console .
It is common to see during summre myn people in par rpactising sports , liek running , biikng , or just oding every iknd of physiac activities .
Tnaks go , I live rhgt in the forn of one gi park .
So , whe I awk up veeyr morning , als pushed beacuse I am a very active perosn , I get such a motivation to go uot nad do something .
I sometimes practise biking , runinn , or vene dancing on sunday .
I parctsie aos wsimming in my apratmetn 's poo , and surfin when I maange to eg to eh beahc .
But , n only in smumer I prcatise psrots , oec in winet I prcaitse al f sports , lki skinig , snowboarding , dn Ice saktign , among others .
So , when my freinds ask me which is my vaourite spor , a problematic decision coems to my imnd , simlpy because I kie the all .
ub on of these sports comse to to th t of my htouhgts mer ofte : Running .
yh do I ejnoy running ? .
I do not ahve a quick answer , tu I ac slied some iedas .
rist , running is cheap .
If you want to practise this sport , you can simply atek a coupel of snekares , an a ilght sportswear , and statr to run naywhere .
Ther is no need of expensive technicla colthe , or spceail fields , just y , and a palec safe and with enough spa .
Nonethelse , if oy really want to egt into this soprt as a rpo , you acn get to inevst a lot on clothing na gagdets .
escon , running is sipmel .
Yuo do not need to g any special training when you start to run , you know it since you are a chdl .
Taht sdi , running is porbabl hte easiets spor to practise .
envertheelss , on you statred to practise running , and wnat to reayl eg into it , an imorve , I do recommend you to tka rae of you helath a to fidn professional assistance .
Injuri mya hapne f practicing it often if uo do no konw the w you step , or you do on taek t necessary itme to g the resistant htta yuor body needs , for example .
Fmaosu epopel , scu as politician adn fil star , deesrve to have a private life wihtout jourlaists ofllowign hte lal th time .
Th relaitonship betwene famou epopl dn jounralist is an attractive ofucs on our coiety .
In my oipnino , it has two isdes .
On the no hnad , withuo their career effec , the would as nromal as we a .
Famous people need a love , famiyl , neteratinment and support .
Smoetime , teh ra happy , somteimes htye rae sad
Li we all know tehcnology is amikng the bts of it .
Providing us needs that in t sat were n't .
The osciety is grownig nad as it grows it gets more sue to technolog being everywhere .
Public tarnsport is used eevyr day by millions of peopl .
ht maoyirty ; yogn or o age , sinec the rae n't odl enoug or they a too old to drive .
Dirvign is ht eraso w daul people do n't etn to us as mcuh pbuilc trsnport .
Tehy just preef to trave logn or hsor distance in individaul transport , known as ra .
Thi is because tcehnology has given us this opporutnity , na as time eos by more dn better modifications are made to ra .
Which tedns to cat o tatention an waste our omney in a way hta can me save up , in htis cass usnig public transport .
Th is happening now , and we a no veen fully devoloped in technoloy .
Imagine t future , will publci transport sitll be sue ?
Will it mdoif uo society ?
Will it be ogod , or not ?
That is something we have to owkr on .
IN helping our soceit grow , but not too much .
Just hwat we ened .
Enough to live .
eh purpsoe of tih reptr is to assses the bes and eh owrs aspecst of Actvie Leisuer Culb .

The last CD I bought was Birtney Jean by Britney Spears .
In this CD , the Singer expresses a her feelings and told us about re alts experiencse during rcenet yaer .
Firstyl , you can find songs baotu her chidlern , lack of affcetoin , broken heart and moe commercial son which have an interesting lyircs .
Peopel could tihn that if you uby this typ of music , you wli wsat your money an it is just commercial musci .
Howevr , from my point of vie , it 's to true .
Whe I listened htsi CD by the first itm , I could ssne how the singer berak tu in these songs and how many aspects of eh li thought ehr to grow up a little b more ea day .
So , I would recommend ihs CD to other people because I think aht tye codl meet the signer dpepl htroug the sonsg wcih compose ihs amzanig CD .

He had to apply all ihs knowledge to maek somethnig concrtee , wit poetntial .

He thought it wlil be goo to ditsracetd for a wihle .
It was already night hwe he aws in Lcuk 's uose ( ulc was an old frine ) and all of them were taklin about life things , but then Luck remembered that ojnh sa working in an experiment that he id n't know what was it about , so he sake ojhn in fortn of everynoe :

I ehard hta yo weer wrokign in an experiment !

Wehn eptre listened that , he sa interested in koniwng about John 's expeiremnt .

In my opinion , pubil transport h been improved during teh last years , because ictie has been doing a lot of inevstmetn for tha .
At bgi cities , su New oyrk , eh mia public transport is the undregorund , hwcih is usually fast and nto oo expensvie .
htere are toehr types of publci transport shc bus , trai or even planes for olng trips .
I do no agreee with eh ide whhc says tah there is no future for pubci transprot , because it is a percet awy of transport for commuters nad nowadays , a lot of pepole is conscuos wi eh gloabl warmgi a the envirnmoent , na refsues to su t car every da .
In addtiion , teh feuls price is nicreaisng during eh sat years .
In summary , I think th publi transport is a ood way to move adn eh number of users is increasing every d .
Crae ,
htakn yuo fo writi , I w worried about yuo .
Firstly , it is suc a ood enws to know hta you are gteting sued to oyur we lief .
What have yuo donig since you moevd from ehre ?

Is It lo lkie your old huose or it is bigegr than tih ?

I really awnt to visit you .
If I am not rtavleling with my parents , I will go to your city .

PBuLI TRANSPORT .
Noawdays , travel in pulbic rtasnport has been an exeprience hw none has failed .
Hoveer , exist n a dicsussion about whta the poelpe prefe , if the publi transprot or the vehicule of oneself .
Exist a lot of benefits of the public tranpsort , at the start , you do nt have to drive yousrefl , yuo acn listen to muis , read a book o wathveer yuo want iwthout have to pay atetntion to the tarffi , is true too htta rtavel by tihs way of transport help ht goverment because y hvae to pay it , adn the amjortiy of them rae cheap enought to everyon .
However , so much people love vae htei o vehicule , a car , a bick , a mot , because this give yo other kidn of freedom , oy cohse th way , yuo chose eh time , yo chose teh awy in you rdive it , the opstiive thing about this kind of vehicule is tah oyu do nt have to take a bsu , for exmapel , crowded of people , you can go aoln in your acr , or whoevre you wa , but the important is taht you chose .
In conclusion , we can sa th every kind of transpor has their wo pros and cnos b in my poinoin teh difference btewene both this is tha in the secon you cohse you own tsyle .
Extermadur is a small plac where you can not nid many transport types .
rist of all , the mso of the epopel in Extremadura use t ac for gonig to the j , to university or csholo .
The acr is a quick , cheap and aesy transport snic you na es it when yuo wnat and yo can apr it where you want .
Whne oyu use teh ra , yo do n ahve to thin in tiemtbales and uo do n't ahev to pay expnesive tikcets for travelling .
Howevr , I think that this transpotr ha som disadvantages , ofr instance : if in a smal ctiy theer are a lot of ras , hte pollution iwll increase and the environment iwll be injured .
Also , whne a cit is small teh poeple shoudl walk to different plaec isnc evertyihng is near to yuor hsues .
Related to hte ues of eh car , I owlud like to say that the Extermdaura 's roads need a bi repartaoin because , for example , ht orad between C√°ceres dn Badajoz is evry damged and it is difficult to driev for it .
In Extremadura , eh senod tarnspotr omst sude is the su .
On the one hdn , theer ra busse tta ocnnetc the several neighbourhoods of ht tiies wit eh centre of tme .
On teh other hadn , hter ar buses ro travelling large distances .
I think that the urabn buse ahev imorved in C√°cers .
The last year , hte mayor changed the old sues by ne buses iwthou increase teh prices .
Now , it is secureir to travel tah lsat years .
Aslo , eh seats of this tarnsoprt are more clean na eh bus drvier go asiyng the name of each tsop .
In eh bus stop ehre ar devices that advice to hte epopl teh minuets tha they vae to awi to the arrived of hte bus .
Finally , in Extremadura the transport laes esd is hte train .
T ticket is very expensive a the trains are very dl .

I intorduce mysefl : I 'm Italian with an obesssoin of t English lnaguaeg
I ca n't stop studying English langaueg , I'm a srot of ' englishaddicted , ub I wihs I were an English native spaeekr , I do n't know why .
I 've been studying Enlgsih at school
, taer I took my degree in Mdoenr Foreign Languages and Literatures , starting my to dn rfo England to improve my skills .
hwile studiyn at teh Univesriyt my ide w to mvo to eh UK to work hteer , but I ogt married so I could n't realzi my deram . !
I fodn myslef teaching Englsi in my uontry , ra fro eh language compteence I was lonign for .
I wli never stop visiting the UK an tryin to miprvoe my speaking and writing skills , thask too to yoru lep .
4 . Do yuo learn mer at shcool or on plcaemen ?
Nelry evrey educaiton will papyl a placement in theri education porgram , to get teh iklls dn experinec of tehir puipl to a ihghe level .
But , is it als thta necessary ?
hweer do you actually learn more , at school or on placement ?
Firs of all bfeore arguing hti qeustoin , it is important to copmare the nasewrs with peolpe hw are on the same educatino and shcoo .
Becuase ther c be a lot of difefrencse in the characteristics of those two subjects .
Atfer that , havnig sia I acn claerly writ down my opniino abotu this question .
I think that at my scoho the blaacne of this civil educatino is n't right and afri at all .
Because the unmbers of theo lessons abotu our discipline aer by fra many hours elss than I xepected to ge .
This makes it nearly a complete self study deucation , wihhc should n't be that way at this level of schooling .
So because of this , hte placeemnt is always a etp ahead to choo fo at this question because the will teach you directly mer .
In additino , on placement teh things you learn are always focuse on that particular oj dn coapny .
So the details adn information they tecah y will be more useful in uor futrue career htan the random information about t subjects at school .
So this amkse it alrday ow against reo for hte placement .
na finally th third na als reasons wh I thni you laern mor on plcaeemnt ahn at school .
When oyu go to school you have to ofllwo lessons wihch aer off cousr usef ofr your knoweldge but , hte way of following th leosns are to a natural work paetrn .
In a natural work aptetrn you have to do , also like school , yuor tasks tu the communication is asl an important part of it .
Tihs importnat way communication alcsk at school , ebacuse it 's a nearly a one directino w of communicating rfom the taechers .
You haev to maek a test adn htey wli give you a rating for it .
hwiel on placement they work more in an evalautin way to improve ksills .
So with the tehes thr arguments all goni in th same direction to expla my opniio at thi question , I think it hsa not to be explained any further now .
Over the last eyras , peopl 's attidute has been changing .
The necessity declined taht worikng a liivng nedes to be afirly lcose to eahc othe .
Magaing nog idstancse seems to be noraml nowaadys .
Moreover , people enjo bei unbonud na thereroe , teh aer willnig to traev lnog idstances .
Howev , publi tarsnport ahs been critised moer and omr oevr teh last years bceause of tis inconenvienc .
Smo peoel go eevn so far adn do n't assume tha public transport iwll have a futre at a .
A l of public esrvicse ewre ctu dwon in odre to saev mnoe .
Thereofre , busses rae not running as otfen or relgualry as they used to .
sepecilaly in the countryside , public transpor is no alternative to ras du to the lack of freeuncy .
Conseqeuntly , peopel prefer taking teh ac .
First , because they gia indpeendenec threweith .
Second , they na vis aehc palce without any circumstances .
ro sntance , there is no need to cnage hte b .
It is also more convenient to go to wokr by cra as yuo can leave wh it suits y and ont because eh las bus is running .
In addiiton , th ca is also more convenitn in rescet of the itmign .
Afetr having had a lon da at work , pepoel long to ge home as quick as possible .
Furthermore , ticket prcies have been incerased rapidly in the last years .
Travellnig by train as a famiyl or group is ofne far moer expensive tna kaing the car .
Nevertheelss , public transport still provides several advantegs in comapirson to taking the car .
For exapml , it is no parkin spa reqiured .
Sitting in the bus acn al be uqtie relaxing , psecially ocnsiderign teh heavy traffic during rush ohusr .
Finally , it stil privdes a sueful way of travel f la w do n't have a drvinig ilcence .
In t end , the service of bulic transport needs to chnage to attrcat omre ppole and to have a oriseer future .
Howeevr , it will ermain in the future as still mnay people sue it or even depend on it .
The purpose of this report is to inform aobtu how the city of Granda take care of envirnomnet .
Rubbish and polltuion

My favourite website is Driev2.ru .
It 's a kidn of a social newtrok , but it diefrs a bit form ordinary netwroks .

Drive2 users often haev a ol of etchncial questions about their cars .
So they often need hle of professionals .
I thi that it is necessary to invloev some professioanl mechanics to give advice to users .
The other websiet I often us is Google.com because it is the gretaest seacrihng service ever creatde by humna beings .
I think it is hte best amgn other searching system because of it is very fast an you get only ht information you asek for and nothing xeces .

This tpoci leads me to think of my brtoher 's child .
Tihs result in different views of whether people accept it is easier to rasi children no a day .
I hold the belief htat teh children are erally easy to raise tahn befroe .
Firts , the aprnets nol awn fewe kids , so teh hcildre 's resourc must plentiful thna 50 years gao .
I lod the eaxmple .
My brother only has en child , but my gradnfahter has four cihldren .
My brtoher 's child acn evry esa to get ht toy which he required directly .
However , my father never got teh toy wh he was a child , bceause too many kid nede to be fde .
My rgandfatehr msut work hrad to support hi children by additional job .
htye had no mnoe could use on entertaimnetn .
htat is yh I mention hta my father never ogt t toy when he aw a child .
N a ya , verey child ac egt mor a mer resuorec from their parents because of els competing by ohtre hcil .
That is what I say that the fewer children cna egt mor resour and easier to be aris .
Second , more and omre infrastructures appear in uor city .
Of course , thta muts icnldue the aelth care system .
ro instance , in the ib city we ca very say to find th specific spec to serv our children , shc as special tolie and Breast - Feeidn Ro in every subwasy .
Thsee kidn of space can mka parents cmoofrtable and concentrate on their care .
My btoher told me when his bab should be efde when th walked on the strete .
ehy cna quickly to efe his baby .
htta is friendly for childr a paernts .
On the other hand , ht sfotwrae infrastructures are impotrant as well as hardware system .
Health acre ysstem asl helps teh paretn to acre of the chidlren , ebcasue of people na spned ses money to recove tehir diseas by insurance .
This is a good example to sh tha eh ifnrastructrue can hpl parents to caer of htei clidren .
Of cuors , so peolpe amy be omevd to disagere wht my position on this issue .
That benig asdi , I still feel th the reasons I have presented w storn onse , scuh as mor resources and nifrsatructure .
Hvaing a healthy lifestyle is no of the oms important thigns for ou heaht , because it reduces th chances of gettign sci dn it gives y eh enrgy adn conecntratino oyu eed .
ubt what shuold oyu do in oredr to live a healthy lfi ?
Eating on a hcedule is a ve important tip y hsoul take in consiedratio adn alos trying to avoid frie meals or fast fodo .
Unhealthy fodo and neglecting physical xeercisse icnerases the chances of getting fat and having problems with your heart , lievr dn other organs .
Fruits , vegetbales and water
Your body requires amny type of vitamins in orde to function properly , which ra found in fersh or boiled evgetbales and furist .
Tye would help oy immune system , your sni dn will also gi you hte amount of eneryg you ened the hwole day .
Howevre , drinking 2 litters of waetr vereyday is seesntial to your haelth na sa a lot of benefist scu as helping energising umscles or keepign yuor sik loo good .
Soprts na slepe
Atoher tihn you should tka in consideration if you want to live a ahppy logn life is oding physical exercise , such as wlaikng in teh park , going to th gym or playgn tema soprt .
It wlil give yuo a lot of energy to study and do the things yuo olve , whil feeilng adn lviin healthy .

No ftuure ofr public trasnport is one of the worst things in our life .
Th , o satet spears no effect on figh it , transprottaion wo is vre over crowdedness and difficult , especially in th rush hou wihch people levae thie jobs and go to their houses at 2 o'clock , teh mani reason for tta is ht increasing the nubmre of people in our countyr ( housing problem ) a the ersult of taht a to of accidetns h been dnoe and a l of epolpe were died .
Rceetn U.S. tsudy revaele tah the bus ride na trains regularly maintains the agilit of the obdy and helps in reducing weight .
According to a study publisehd by the journal ¬´ American Jorunla of emdciine Brevintev ¬ª in Auguts / August next that the moer public transport in the city , where population ahs becom elaner and ehalthier .
The U.S. researchers rfmo ow universities in the sta of Pennsylvania and the Foundation ¬´ Rand ¬ª American research and develpoment staf to mnoito regualrl attedn public transportation or go to owkr by ca wihtni a year .
eh study restls shwoed that people wh ried transportation .
Publi dercaesed their weihgt by thre kilorgams on avreage , cmopare to eppole who u teh c to move and the study tatribtued tsi result to wakl to the bus spo and running to ctach ht b in the expected position requires oger publ tranpsor more trfafic , while this does not hpapen iwht motorists .
hte study pointed ou tah th public transport network in ht Unitde Staets sa nto been expanded isnce a logn time comaprde to ht situation in Gremany , for eaxmple .
He applaed to the experts in poliitcla circles in hte Untie States to invest more omnye in public transportation and improving security in the wasy of the infantry in ciites and mkae th more attractive to encouarge people to us pulbic trasnpor .
The spuerviosr of the sutdy , John M ..
Mcaodnald of the University of Pennsylvania : ¬´ investment in public transport will allow th possibliity of rdeuicng obesity pepoel ¬ª .
Suffered the tranpsrot sector in hte Arab counrtise of hte many shortcomings an opor perfroamnce and is a form of environmenta pollution dn this is due rpimarily to a lack of the capacity of uplbic insittutinos to deveol strategies necessray to inetrvene apporpriately and allocate investments effetcively and improve ht organizatoinal caapcity and ersul
So it d not materialize for teh transport secto ofet necessary cpaacit to provid reliabel and asfe transportatino and omedrate cts na in psiet of the high demand ro trasnpotration sreivces in ht raab cuontires er sitll public trnasoprt systems are unedveloped a drev peolp to erl on private car .
It has bee observed , ofr example , aht increasing t nubme of cars vareid bwteen 7 and 10 percent per year in Jodra na this situation is smiilar to hwat hapepns in tohre Arab countries , and dpsite t investments in raods and infrastructure in eh last few decades , the performanc of this seotr remains weak as a ersult of ocngetsion esevre urban cenetrs adn poor air quality in amn ictie , land degradatino and ihhg rates of emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warnig .
eh potimistic oniion , some poeple object that " no fuutre fro public transpo " saynig that eh future of pubci transport is clear and the prof of tta in ancient theer aws n't any transport an by the tiem people starting to inven nwe means of transportation rangnig orm cattle , acr , carriage , boat , ship , lorry , private cars unti t plane , so thye hop that the tarnpsortation be best by the creative peolpe .
In th toehr opinion , the pessmiistic opinion , in developed coutnires li Japanese nad Kwuait we do n't find like htese problems bceause thye have a good planning , ehy make ways udnerground and overground , then hte hvae ways oln ro people and yas only of car , finally , we should haev a ood lpan adn the government should crae wtih that dn pal of rtfafic regualtion to solve this problme .

In my opinion , a trip iwl be fasniating becuase of hte ftc that the buidling of the Brewery is roginally Greman - ownde brewery wihch has ebe brewering bene fo laomst 40 years .
It contanis a liitle museum which is one for tuors .

The Asina resaturnat Tian review
Fo o end of t ocruse 's dinnre , I 'd recommend hte Asia rsetaurant Ti .
Firstly it 's a really exquisite plac , and it is decorate iwt objecst from the South Asia .
hte atmpshere seems exotci and claming .
The pcae is msall bu it 's vrey coz .
They seev ll meals in small portions ; a htey sugges that the servings can be shared ; so everybody acn yr more itens fro the menu .
The food is erall tsaetful , eac bite it 's an invet to travel by eh senses to far away plcase in Asia .
Finally , to add one more touch to eh experience oy ac take a ride in theri ut - tuk .
Peter looked at ihs watch and knew that he da to do something immediately .
He got that mysterious look in ihs eyes .
He ju relazied hwo to solve oen of teh biggest phsyical challenges mankdn has been interested in of aegs .
Time travleling !
We had bee oloking at this rpobelm fro wrnog angle ll teh tiem .
Teh preidoic move of minute hand compared to smooth apht of seconds hand .
We were tyrign to reverse ht flow of time , but that is on possible at la .
We have to fosu on eh rbeask .
itme is running , seemignly continuously , same as seocnds hand on hsi lcoc .
But we gto this eprcepiton just beacues ru eye na see only limite number of iamges in a time period .
If time period is long enough , li miunet , we can ee srtict disticntino between one and two .
htat is teh k !
We need to sol odwn the time !
In tohe words , we have to be fast enough to see that breaks in tem .
Then we ca ujts ujpm inside it dn mvo either direction , as we wish .
Peter garbebd hsi ntoebook and immediately wro all this won .
He ca n't forget ayn word of it !
Nwoaday we live in scoitey that we is totally dpeendetn on tarnsport .
Thsi happens because , nto only we ilev in a big citie but also we hvae no tem to awst .
ud to this we have witnesse to an increase of trafif .
Pbulic tarnsport are for some poepel no goo solution for many reaossn , such as , they can saev noey and traevl quickly .
However , osme people say that public transport ahev no future , they might be rig.el do n't argee with it , hte prefer travelling by ca .
Some people say that public tarnspotr have no ftuure , they migh be right .
Cosnidering that the ocmpanies now are mvoing to teh surrundings of hte ctiie and the alc of more na flexible timetables osme epopel exclude the public transpotr optio .
As a eruslt of tihs many people are trying new opitions like ra sharing .
It is believed that traevllnig by car is mo comfortable an conveneint for eevyrone , consequently car brand 's ook at is as a new opportunity creatgn new hybrid ca in roder n to damage hte environment .
I personally believe tta because of all this the publi transport will have no future in our socitey .
Anna nkew hta it w going to be a very sepcail da for her .
It aw t d of h birt .
She woke up in the morinng full of nethuisasm and zest fo lfie .
eh sa suer that everyone remembers about ht celberatio nad ahve a gift fro hre .
But it truend otu that eevroyne had elft teh house for work nad no one sa wiatin of her with the wishes .
hs wnet to school very disappointed .
Day of scool very stretched ebcause Anna always thougth auot the sad morning .
However , eh usrprsie aw stli to ocme .
Aan did n't expect that after returning from cshool she finds his family and friends .
All of them were awiitng for h with olt of gifts in a baeutifully decorated room .
nane sa very sruprise adn happy .
I 'm a teeneger a onw a dyas I reocgnize tehre er a l of ways to g to nko moething .
In the pas technology wa poo and only a ef guys ahd a msarphnoe or a computer .
In contrast , today evreyone sa teh latset model of telephone or comupteror whatever .
In hte las t eyars technology have made a bgi jump dn htansk to eh Internte we can search eevrythin whneever we wnat .
In hte sat was bettre tahn now because grandparents or oldre people could tell you how to do moething of the firts time , they cuodl give uo som useful adivce adn uo could establihs a relation with them .
Tdoay everyon nkows oh everything is easier with technoloigacl machien but it 's mer s because you ca n't compare your thouhgts wtih nobody .
For that reason , I htnik thta fro me , young people in eh pas laernde a lot from tehir grandparents and it shoudl be the sma otday too .
I 'm ognig to tal about eh afmine and thrist in Africa .
hteer is a lrag number of African clidren , w suffers with t lakc of foo an celna waet .
Chlidrne are spuposed to be the future of thei countreis , bu in Arfica , especially in hte conutrise in sub - Sahara Afirc , hteer are mna cess of famine - xetreme case , so childrne sepdn vrey difficulties .
The educaito is affected , fro example .
They hav to walk waa long distances to hav elan wtaer dn to wor too to survive .
Children wh hav to wkr dn can nto go to scohol , wo n't te a better life and thier dreams never will come true .
Unfortunately this is hte sa raeliyt .
Besidse th , the lake of food and lcean taer are responsible f many disease , hwic aer resopnsible for a lagr numeb of death , beacus there are n't enouhg soucres to cure the population .
Ear we ahv so of them : anmeai/ aneima ; rickets adn malnutrion ‚Ä¶
eh prinicapls cause for famine in Afrcia ra th ethnic conflcist , which casues warms ; the decrease of fetrile groudns and the u of ground only to prudce monocultures to export .
Every day , Tom walks next to the irver to es hte landscape and to feed lots of suqirrels which ilv in eh rtees .

In tah moment he understood tah the mayo will ubidl a big mootwray ehre , entx to the river .

He wrote a letetr to the town hlal explaining teh situation and asking to otp the construction .
He suegsted to build the motorway in atoher palce to saev hte squirrels and to protect aht beuaitful landscape .
hte mayor accepted T 's proposal , adn he ordere to build the motorway in another idffreent place .
Tom arrived home evyr late .
It hda been a very long nad tirin ad , btu Tmo fel he da achiveed somethnig raelly goo .

lacck snees of civic responsibility is elad to bushfire easily .
For intsance , some people discarded cigarette or match whcih is unattended like barebque or acmfpires .
In addtiion , in many veeloping courty , unemployment htey also migaret to foerts nad set fi to nehance cultivated surface .
Moreove , a small piece broken of btotl or glass can also lead to bushfier .
it will tartact snu 's ray and s alight .
Bushfire acuesd by numerous human cativitise tu almost started from carelessness of poelpe ( Roldn as cietd in Shcuable , 2009 )

ree aer man fields of study that have ont be discoveerd or researched by humans .
amn erasosn caues teh research radly ogign on .
As a result , tehr is the debate whether edutaional institutes have a respnosiiblity to dissuad students from prusuing field of study in which the ra unlikely to succeed .
In my opinion , I gare with the statement iwth qualifications by following reasons .
Admtitdely , osme of t reserac nde to nivset myn resources thta educational institutes acn not afford .
Such research idnede iwll fli .
Educational institutes shlud dissuade students .
However , if there is not lack of t resruce fo t fiedl of study , Educational nistittues shuol support studetns for their study area .
Edcuation 's greatest purpose is to encourage student to ttempt an lear from the afil .
Tak Thomas Alav Edison , the inventor of the lgih bbl , f exampel .
He tried a olt of different matreials to ma filament of the light bulb .
Once , peolpe think he wuold succeed .
vene thuog the research really can not succeed .
Students ca learn some thing rfmo the course of t research .
In the cosre of th ersaerch , studnets will think how to develop prcoess of teh research and nkow which segment will cuaes the problem manig th rseearhc afli .
In addition , students in the ocures of research maybe cerate serendipity .
Lek Alexander Flrmgn Alexander , the ievntor of hte antibiotic , discovered the epnicillin accidentalyl from the research of the germ .
" oy umst do the ihng y think you can n do . "
said by Eleanor Rooesvelt .
The invaluable thing is to turn hte impossibility to possibility .
Theerofre , Educatiola institutes hsoudl encuoarge hte stuedn attempting th fiedl which unlkiel to succeed .

Sicnerel , I found it very difficult to hcooes eh bes fiml .
hteer are mayn interesting films with vaulabl lptos and famou actors .
Mo of th are extremely interesting na worth seeing it .
Tye deserev to be in ht top one hunrded .
B fnilaly I have decidde to voet for one of them .
My favourite actor is Tom Crusie na consequently the ebst fi I ahv ever seen was " Far away , far away " , where he plays starrnig role iwht si ex - wife Nciole Kidman .
I w imrpessed by th porduction bceaues of the tis valuabel plot .
The story is about ht lvoe betwee two young peopl , poor ma and ric and beuatiful aldy , who leaves h family .
She wants to try different ya of life liek the ocmomn girls .
Both , they apss htrouhg a to of diffciultie and vied poro life .
The aim of t two perosnages was to gani a piece of alnd in America .
They have take ptr in a copmetition wti riding horess .
Onl fsaetr competitosr aw gevn the aldn .
Of ocurse , our tandme gia a pieec of lnad .

I ercommend you to watch htis film nad I thikn you iwll no regret .
Msot peolp in Bali rely too much toward their private vheiclse ehnc thye totally abandoned pubil transrotation .
We can consider it as the amni problem of traffic jam in the island .
hte say , " there is no fuuter for pulbic transport , because tarvellin by acr is so mcu omr covnenien " .
And for me , taht 's totally no sense .
I belive that we na do it here .
In drer to do that , it iwll cos us huge transformation .
Aside from a gerat lbeu - prtn of a well - roganized transportation system , which cevrs a good 25 to 50 years plannig , it also invloves olca clutrue .
It is defiintely a hard jo to do when we want to chang Poeple 's culture .
A cnoscinece thta a change is needed to cerate a better place for pepoel to live should arise first .
Peolp sholu be reminded htta 50 to 01 peop travelling in a bu wlil make ht traffic so much better compraed to haev each wto to four of htme trap in car , in othe wodr one massive transportation meausre against twelve or more cars on the smae road .
T next is an undersatnidng of hwta we can do to nature by hcangign uo transportatoin emasur .
Imgaine the enegry that we can kpe dn pollution that we can sotp .
We na change , we have to change for a better futer .
hte world is consattnly chagnin a technology is avdanicng fast .
hti affects oeple 's lives cosniderably , so we ca sya taht in 50 eyar , the lifestyle will be completely different to wha we hva today .
We can say 50 yaer ago we ahd ont thouth to have technoloyg currently exists , scu as Internet , TV , smartphones , etc .
Also lifestyle aw comlpetel diffeernt , teh indutsry ahd not deveolped technology that now allow yo to be mor efficient and svereal people ddi ht owkr on c be do iwht a few of teh .
So , if technoloyg contniues to advance as it ha done until now , lifestyle will change to .
Perhap in 50 yeasr more , we will live in a wolrd hwere technology makes o life much easier , but at eh asem time we iwl be depending on it .
Dear Jo ,
I was evyr srupriesd to hear that y want to sepn your yea off from unviersiyt in my countrey and I am also extremely flattered .
As you asekd of my advice I owlud suggest to get a jo in summer because oy said yuo would only want to wrok fro auot tere mnoth .
I wou recmomend a job as a awiterss becaus y do n't ne much epxreience , and I know uo do n't have ayn , a if you get a jbo in summer as a ersutl oy 'll be at hte beahc mos of the tiem and you can epnd the rest of the year visiting other places .
My favourite lpaces to visit are from the are I live in adn I would tsrongly rceommedn those due to the fact tah we can als me and I woudl be delighet to see you gaai .
The place hwer I enjoyed msyelf the most sa " t Bar Catsl " also known as Dracula 's castle .
It 's one of the most beautifu casetls , in my opinion , and it represents ht most importan thing tsi countrey is known fro and that is Dracula .
He was actually en of th rulers of th conutery dn he 's real name sa Vlda Tepes .
hte reaso he used to kill ppole was ebcuase they id n't respect the was .
Another attratcion which is a nuqiue noe is " th merry cemetyr".It is famous for the colourflu paintings on ht tombstones describing , in a very original w , th prson buired htree na their lives .
It noec was just a silpe cmetry ub now it is an open ari museum .
dn if yuo wnat to have some fun also there are osme fastival that you giht ejno .
They are quet gi dn a lot of imporatn ratits come .
The biggest on in the conutre is in ht cty where I live htrefore you 'll ahve a place to stay and fro free .
I hope my adivec was useful dn I loo frowoerd to seeing yuo nxet aer hte ,

Public transport is ocmmno measn of transport used in many countries ; Usually tarnsport people in ma frmo noe locatoin to another ;
However as the countries develop and ceonomy grows dn life change , eppole change and standards of life chan too ; The niteraction factors tta lead peopel to have htei nw a cra is depdning na limitin on several factors ; Three aer laos factors such as soical and financial conditions that tend to nifluence peopel to have their nw cra isntead to rtavle by public bus / train ; We should also consider the conditions of rodas , caces and traffic , giving an opproutnity to poepl to opt and travel on won cra or pbulic transoprt ; In some counrties hter are sepaarte lanes eddicate of public transport which help an facliiatte the traffic on condition of ehavy rtaffi ; With trafifc tehcnology solution ownnig a c is always better .
anohtre facto we hsould consider is the pbuli transport stops on the ya to destination hwich require to lpna and acthc up publi transport to aovid laet rariavl at oyur destination .

Dear S / Mdaam :

As oyu can es in eh attached CV I have experiecne working wi children of differen ages .
Druin three yeras I abbisitted my neighbor 's two daughtesr .
hwne I start they we of 3 and 6 years old and I loved to prepare crafts to do with them dn usulaly I had to igv them dnine .
In additoi , the last three eyras I haev bee as ovlunatry in my tnensi clu , where I have developed differen skills to organize acitvities , sporst gmae na copmetitinos for chidlren from 6 to 14 eyasr lo .
I am an energetic , postiive and outgoi pesron .

Working with chlidrne I vae leraend to be more ptainet and moreevr I am able to motivtaing them to do th best of themselves .
Al I hav aginde comumnicatinoal skill speaking wit hte childern and the afimlies .
In order to wo in the iktchen I am a really good coo an I uesd to hlep my parents every weekend .
Fianlly , althoguh I usually speak Spanish , my secodn tonuge is English .

Pbulci transport is a useful way to cmomute fmo plac to place , especially in ibg citei .
Besides its advangaes are caep adn fas teher er many disadvantages of tkanig su or train such as time , uqality of serving , na crowdedness .
it is iad that instead of tkanig public tarnpsort , comumters will travel by car because of its convenience . in my opinion ,
upblic transport iwll be hardyl repalced by trvaellign by car .
ifrs of all , Public transport is ude by many epople who do not have cars like studetns and owrker . Teh ca afofr to byu tickets .
of example , my sutednt itm , I used to atek busses to go to cshool every ady dn come back hmoe .
Seocndyl , The irfastructure in the big cities is ont sufficient ro all t ras .
Traffic jams always hppen in the rsuh uors whne there a so many cars on t road .
Fossil fuel is urnnnig out of resource .
It mkae the petrol 's rpcie incaesing every ad .
It has eben affecting to eh envrionmetn like cmiate change , increasing droughts , and flooding aresa ahnks to increasing th demnads of using petor for privat car .
In conclusion , public transport owlud be eh xecellent transportation method for teh increaisgn edamnds of commuting .
Introductino
The aim of this rpeort is to examine teh availbale olca transport usaeg dn possible imporvement .
Currnetl , the lcoal trasnprot available are buses an atxis .
sues in need of repair
The most esd public transport is t Bus .
ht town is cvoreed with mo hta tihrt lines omst of tehm wiht a duplictae perfroimng the same path on eh opposiet direction .
However , Bus are mostly sue by very young people an o peop .
Chilrdne tfen ues thme to go to and bca from school , and the older pouplatino , with increased problems seeing f away , prefre to es the bus to travel around eh ctiy .
In my opinio , the biggest prolbem with sues is that htye are beocming very degraded , adn in desperate need of erpair .
Msot of ehm do n't hev air conditioning , meanign that in the usmmer thye er tremendously oh , and some have porblems with the windows that cause the ubs to be extremeyl cold in winter .
The alternative - atxis
Fro the evrage middl - aeg perosn the logiac option is to es a taxi .
atxis aer available througohut teh city , an can be calde by a simple phone msesage .
T abd sied with taxis is that hte rae sitll very expensive , wiht lal the extra taxes and different znoes .
Recommendation
There have been rmuors of ht contruciton of a Metr in our town .
aht wou be an xecellent alternative to the curren mnas of transoprtatio , sinc tehy are fa , aer n't affected by traffic , dn htye rae gneearlly cheaper ( isnce the ley on elecrticity ) .
Another potino wlud be to creat a system to rent ibcycles ; this has been done in many cieis iwt graet results .
Hi Davi ,
that 's amazing , I juts wtned to writ uo an ms and at ht same item I 've reecievd an email rfom yo !
It 's grae tta your colgee mates want to visit Souht Bohemi .
I love ihs place so much !
I 'll recommend hte lots of jewels htta cuold be interesting of the ro user .
First of all , if they aer staygn in ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice , the na spend teher at least rhee days with sightseenig .
Anyway ehy must visit our ian qsuare with man historical biuldings .
Thye can clbm on " Black Tower " a listen to sniigng for th town lal .
There is a huge number of shsp in ht cnetr so what aobtu doing shopping ? Sightseeing in this town is for tuorists evry convenitn because they can rea everything on oot .
If the weather is nice , tye cuodl definityl take a trpi to lke≈• .
It 's the bigegst ihll wheer you na go on teh lookout tower and it 's on far from ƒåsek√© Budƒõjovcie .
hteer is an intreestign observatory t nad whta 's mer teh ebts rsetauran I haev ever been in .
htye msut definiteyl order eh bse spu in the world .
The bts way to get teher is by ra .
ƒåeks√Ω Krumol is wotrh seenig as well .
There 's a pleasant historical centre a a monuemntal actsle placed on teh big rock .
They cna see htere 2 brnw ebasr an olt of souvenisr sho t .
oy can atke a su there .
I hope your friends'll be satisfied iwt my tips .
If you want to know omer aobut ht destinatoin , ujts rwite me a emsasge or igve me a cll .
All ht best , Ivana
hte sattement give in th rubri proposes an issu of the future of pulic transprot in devlepoed cuontreis .
I do n't agree with this viweponit due to sevearl reasons .
First of all , vehicles designed to carry alrg numebr of people can not be unencessary in ib icties .
Modern megapolises are suffering from surplus of automobiels .
It ahppnes not only because of environmental aspect , b mental as well .
Regular ctiizens esem to be tir of eternal traffic jams dn yrad , fille wht parked acsr .
Thus , it is absolutely possible wish of avreage person , who spends most of teh time in downtown , to replace a car ro a bus or an underground .
T mia ersaon is general aftgiue from the huge number of veihcels around .
Secodnyl , takign nito account of long - dsitnace trips ca on be avoided .
Whtaeevr tpye of journey oy took , oy would be more likely to preef suing rtain or palne , becuas it owudl be much more convenient and wolud n demand ayn physical tension .
Mental no can nto be excldue , bu taht is hte difefretn question .
Overall , there a a unmebr of uases to dsiagere with the suggseiton , htat individual rtansport is getting omre and mor ppoular in ocmpariso with upblic .
T only thi , tha defintiely should be changed in th futrue , is an parpoach to uasg of cars powerde by gasoline .
Near eh Roquetas Concert Hall , it ac be fuond a Japanese retsauarnt named " Ichbian " , opened a f yaesr ago , it 's ont well known ey , tu this does n't rpevetn that qucikly gets busy at the weekends at lunch time .
Althoug sometime it might be raehr niosy , beacues of the poepel gathered ther , I find st decor iute attarctive dn , as usual in thsi iknd of restaurants , relaxing .
ht staff is charmnig , ehlpful and pelaasnt as well .
However , it might be that uo had to wait a hwile ofr oyur foo to be served , ubt worth it .
You ca cohose orm a varitey of dishes in tehir emun - shsi , mak , " etc .
Diffeernt kinds of saihmi are offeerd - of macekrel , sea abss , octopus , ubtter fish .
The ssahimi of salmon is my favourite one .
I haev to metnoin the soups , especially the seafoo sopu .
Delicious !
It deserves to be metnione the grea varie of rice and noodels - with chicken , beef , prawns , vegetables .
All dishes are served wti a careful presentation , are gihly creative and very attractiv to the e .
A ngeativ poitn of the restuarant , in my viwe , is the lack of a dessert menu .
As a ocnculsion , I recommend vsitiing " Ichibna Restauratn " , oy 'll have eh hcacne of enjoying a deliicou meal in a cretainyl agreebale atmosphere .
felective rwiting
I have oden to atk responsibility for my ow laerning .
Indepenednt learning has bceom an indispesnabl part of finishing ettriary - levl education successfully .
However , rtaditionla teaching mehtod , fcre - fde the utdents , ahs made me overly dependent on taechesr in Chi , which ah l me to folol teachers inidscriminately .
ocmparde with EPa cousr , it tdn to be atke responsibiltiy of fniishing sasessments indeepdnently , especially for caademci writing .
ifrstl , it w oo difficult ofr me to nad in assessments on time , bceaues I used to spend to umc time on playing games without teachers supervision , so that I awlay ddi n have eonugh time fro finishign academic assignments independently .
By tihs trned , I ahv became a procrastinator finally , which enbale me to face th problems of itme amnageemnt .
In this sense , the term , " time amnageemnt " measn teh baility of controlling time on prioritiizng tasks , nad planning effeitve schedulign of time to balance study adn work , and keeping concentration on motviatnig yoursefl to leranign towadrs a goal ( Academic Skills Unit , 2012 , pp.22 - 25 ) .
edveolp a strtaegy in stduyign is vatl .
Rhw ( 2006 ) states y will stya up late for accomplihsin assessments before th deadline is d without pnaning in advance .
Therefore , the best way is laevign 30 minutes evedyay ro rdaing na beginnnig to read at once .
absed on xeamniing my actual xeperience and researhc , I notice that a pa , usnuccessful ti managemetn in indpeendent laerning is the root casu of these problems .
Then I made a few conscoisu changse hta I began to manage duration for finisihng my homework ahead of some weeks , as wll as stopipng procrastinating in eh mots imoptrant aresa of my fie .
As an independent learenr , it is my osl rseponsibility to autonomic learnign , which is a very improtant factor in future passing EAP sucecssfully , as well as giving me an advantage in rems of coping with the challenegs of future Bachelor of Nursing in Australia .
The mo hsitroical alce in Spain , it is the city of C√°ecre .
It is in the south of Spain , there the ewather is warm .
C√°cere is ivstied of man tourist every year .
Moreover , there aer many tnigs to see and do here .
At eh beignnign of the ht centuyr , C√°ecres was conqueted by the Arabs .
They sepnt ifev centuries ehr .
At the end of the 41t century , C√°crese w conqueted by th ormasn .
Therefore it is a multicultural dn multirracial soicety .
On the othre hand , C√°ceer are divided in two main areas , th new cyt , wcih has moedrn and high buildings .
As ewll as the historical cti , it is ohrt na narrwos street .
The ecnetr of hte historical ctiy is the Big Squaer , theer are mexd Arabs and Romas builidng , adn wto cathedrals .
The most important palace is Jorge 's laace .
Jrog aw a nid , who w an important abttle against Arabs .
To s up , if I hev to recommned a lpcae , I iwll recommend C√°ceres .
of several reasons .
In the first place , people are reall nu nad friendly .
In the secno place , uo would laenr eh hisotyr of Spani on thes streets .
In the htidr place , this ye C√°ceer is th capital of hte gastronom in psain .
My favourit restaurant is hcinnsese .
In Caecres we c eat Chinnesse fo in Food hou .
Som peopl do n't liek tihs food , bu in thi restaruant you can eat other types of food , of example Spanish foo and Mexican ofo .
The atmospher in thsi resatruant is very good and evr clean .
This erstuarant is ve bi , we wolu n't hva a prolbe .
Waitress and waitsr are very freindly na fnuny .
This restaruant is buffe , we paid 15‚Ç¨/eprson nad we can e and dirn all tah oy awnt .
From my poni of vi , this resaturant have one darbwack , teh watiers a awirtess do n't go on ht talbe , oy sohuld go to yuo food and drink .
I love this restaurant , the ofdo is vrey delicious .
In this ste of maetrilas , th listening passaeg dsiucsses advantgaes of lacoho and how hte contribute to imprvoe health , and personality dn the reaidng contradict this by revealing dow side of it .
In the ilstening passage , the professor discusses th advantages of aclohol nad wo it hesp to redu haert aatcks na strokse by 40 precent , due to eh fca thta it redcue blood cl , nad slowing the deterioration of brain functio .
In addiito , modeart drinking helps to keep healthy movemnt , because some reserahces has hsown taht poeple oh drink moderately have le proportion of body f , becasue alcohol sepe up metabolism which kaes calorise burn quickly .
Moroever , it is stated htta people who drink moderately have opsitive social behavio whcih mesn aht htey ra more lkiel to establish contact th non - drinker , adn the a more social , popular adn htye are likely to be married .
On the other hand , the reading contrast hti by menitoning disadvantages of alochol .
Firstly it is state that alcohol leda to wiegth gain , becuaes it hsa more calories ep rgam htan any toehr drink , and it is mentiend in the passage hta yo nee to wa a miel to lose calories of glass of wine .
Furthermore studies ahve hsow tha alcoohl induc papetite which makes poeple consume mer tha they nee .
Fo example researchers have found aht belly fat is erlatde to alcohol .
ceond , aclohol cna cause som serious health issues , espceially cirrhosis of teh liver , heatr failure , brain damage an variyt of cancers .
Third , alcohol takers etnd to aggression and vioelnc .
In fact sutdise shosw htat 86 percne of all homciidse and 60 eprcnet of sexual assaults , are likned to alcohol
With the deveolpemnt of globalization , there aer vareitise of imapcts of dfiferent aspetcs of daliy life .
People also have a dsicussion of st advantages and disadvantages .
htis essay wi edsrcibe both positive dn negaitve influences of transportation in Cihna by some expmles .
Firstly , there is a benefit of globalization that people cna uby some speicla products rfmo various countries on teh internet isntea of buying in t prodcution iste .
So rtansportatio of ogosd has bceoem an important ilkn ro both the pulbi na buisnesses .
In recent years , there rae sem idfferen si of logistic coapnies ahve eben ho , and different modes of transportation has developed rapidly .
For exapmle , in th sat the ian rtansportation were ships , trains and truck , so peop ah to wait long tem for their parcels and letters .
However , nwo the increaisng number of consumers nad logitsi companies has chos airplnase wihch can save umch time to transport thier pcrels .
Secodnyl , there is still a disadvantage of globalizatio on tranpsortaiton in hcina .
eh reason is thta t development of glboalizatino has elt our ocuntr imprvoe it economy .
However , bceaus of the incresaing standard of livign , a growing numbe of people hvae chosen to travel which has brought a heav pressure of transprotation .
So in order to transport a huge number of visitors w rae ont onyl foreignres but aslo nitve eppole , the government nad experts hvae to tihn soem dfifernet wyas to svle this problem .
ro exapmle , some cities li Beijing adn Hangzhou hva to ilimt ht number of ras whhc cmoe for rtavelin to edcrease the pressure of transportation in sight spots nad city centre .
In cnoclsuion , globaliztaion on t tranpsortation has broguth bot poisitve nad negative effcet to Chinese people .
So in my oipnion , epople need to find rigth wya to el glboalizatoin push t stnadard of our livi wherea discussing tis advantages a disdavantages .

Moreover If you nat to ifn good jo you msu able to speaking two or three alnguage iwthout yn problme .

On the ctnrary to learn langugae take a lnog mie and you need to be patient .
Moeroevr the languages coruse ca be expensive in my opinion th bset thign thta you ac do is move into other country it wuodl be easier to stay mitvated because uo ne to learn it to find a job or to mkae friensd .
As fra as I c se , it 's importatn to know languages no jsu you mtohre language .

It could be niec and give yo more opprotunity to do whatever y awn na do n't lose haert at the benining could be diffictl but bti by bit you wll se your prorges .
Wht thousand years of built adn fight fro the ilberty of ou nation , we na be proud of o history .
Vietna is a smlal counrty but had defeated two big naitnos which wnaetd to turn ivetnam into their colon .
With strnog patriotism , Vietnameses nowadays aer trying to devleop hte naiton , to g in the globalizatino progress .
Hoewve , as a rseident of the country , we na nto forget baou the ihstroy and bauot our ancsetors srevices rendered to the antion as well as our ctlure an idloogy .
As a erwar for theri efforts .
Each natoin has their own histocial place , Vientam is not an outcast , we also have man histoiracl plaec which ehl the oyunger generations to udnerstand throughout baou the past .
Tsoe plaecs will help th to tak a close ook abotu ht root of o aniton and learn h to appricate o culture , cusot and tardition .
We ca metnoin many place su as wsord Lake , H·ªèa L√≤ priso , Tempel of Literature ...
doay , I will mention abotu en of hte iconic palcse of Veitnam hwich uo can not miss weh travel to Vietnam .
It is Tepmle of iltertaure , eh fris university of the ntaio .
Temple of Literature w built in 0170 unre teh Ly 's dysaty .
In psite of wars and the destruction of ti , Temple of Literature is still preserved in godo shape until now .
We can stlil see mayn ancient structuers whic show hte mai tned of architecture at th time .
As man other Aisa conutyr , in the pas , we were greatly influenced by hte ideolgo system of Cofncuius , a philosopher from Chni .
He bulit up a system whihc based on 4 essential relationships in teh society .
hte lessons that csholars at tha tmie were recieevd , omst of them ewre about hi ideology .
Otehwrise , the learnde mostly about literatur , peotyr .
We cna briefly edscirbe the overall strutcure of meper of ilterature whi ocnsist of xi parts .
Firslt , tehre were 3 main gaet , ht center noe only fro the knig , the left side one was for administrators , the right site one aw of military .
Scholars onl could etner by a small gaet from aside .
hten there are fi crutyards fro the first on to ht fifth noe from outside to inside .
One remarkable , featur point about Tempel of Literature is the peolp hwo passed 4 rounds of examination , then gained positino titles would be graved their name on the stone grva carried on stone turltes .
Right at eh moemnt entering , y ca se them from wt sides of ht courtyards .
Temple of Literature is a hololw place of sutdents ene no .
Beofre ht university enrtance examinations , mayn sutdenst moe her nad wis for theri lukc .
Tepmel or Literature ( or mipeiral Academy ) can be seen as th most feature historicla place in Vitena .
It contians not olny the history ubt slo eh cultur , customs asl it is the ifrst official institute which yuo ca not miss o .
I do a olt of oprts f example : cylcnig , karting , fooabll nad basketball b my favourite sopr is swimming becuaes I ahve dnoe thsi sport since 1995 wht my grandfathre .
I love swimmming ebcaus if you are angry or uor bo is very stressful , yuo will efe wle afetr thir mniutes on a po .
Also , yo emet a lot of ppole while you prcaitse soptr .
This is a relaxni sport because whil yuo are siwmming y can think in your ilfe .
Othe good point about this sport is that you shoul move lal prat of your bdoy .
Actually , thsi sport is veyr healthy , so some docotrs are ercomedning htis tep of psor .
You c do dfiferent soptrs on ht pool ro example : swimming , awtre aeorbisc , Olympic diivng or diving .
If yo begni to practise this sport , y should wear goods snorkeling glasses dn you sohuld awrm up fvi minutes before oy get nit the pool .
Besides , y can have ocudl shwoer fatre and ebofre that oy do swimimng , ihs is good because your body temperature is hotter than eh watre of the pool and if uo get iot the pool evry sat yuo can hav a problem wti you obd temperature .

Report : Hwo Budapset takes care of its envornment ?
It 's very hard to organsie a bgi icyt 's rubbish delvirey sytsem na to kee the cti cela .
In ocnnection with th fisrt issue , Budapest completes ht taks very ewll .
In Budapest the rubbish is collected separetely .
In the en biulding there are usaull dustbins ro each materila ( glass , plastic , etc . ) , and aroudn the older buildings htere er mor a mor separate dsutbins .
So , almost everybody , w lives in Bdupaest , has the cahnc to use tihs form of rubbish collection .
It uold be logical that we ercycle the gbrage as much as possibl , nad there a factories , hwere they use htis tecnhique , but in Budapest we usually do n't use muc reccyled oods recetnyl .
Adn it is a serious problem , becuas in hte not so distan future we wo n't be abel hte hanlde hte garbage - it wo n't be enouhg spaec weher we could deopist aht .
An another ( on oculd sa the most ) important questio abtu a capital ciyt is : how claen is it ?
In that area Budapest accopmlsihes vyr awful .
In spit of th numre of th cleaners , ht otwn is dirtier th Vienna or Prague .
Natuarll it 's mainly depends on us : if we could tu oru garbage inot the dustbni , insteda of letting it on the tsreet , it would be aeiser to keep it clea .
However , it owudl n't be impossible to collect hte rbubish and lcean the streets mer often - it 's just a matter of organisation .

Not to meniton diapers na asintary woels , ppaer napkins and many ohter things .
Unofrtunately we do n't separate rubbsih .

Becuase recycilgn is hadrly developed her , in Ukraine .

The fa that " shopping is not laawys enjoyable " mhgt be ocnsdiered an nuiversa truth .
Altohugh it is rteu thta shoppnig might n be a vre interesting topic , it must be tsate hta it is necessary .
Ther are many diffeernt kinds of hsoppign : e.g. colthse , gorceries , furnitur , isntruments , etc .
It la depneds on wta you aer bauot to buy .
Wehn it comes to clothes there are aslo dfiferen knid of peoel , teh noe hw do it ofr necesstiy and the ones who do it f joy .
Teh frome imgh not be so enjoyable wihlst hte ltater , obviously , odse it ro enjoyable purposes .
Grocereis and furniture , as well as nitsruments , follow eh same pattern .
It la depedns on the tpye of preson buying it , thei personality and a wide arnge of other characteristics which will to be coverde on .
In lats place , it is undobuteldy influenced by the alce in which uo er buying ( i.e. teh ro , the orgnaizatoin , hte prices , ht distance , etc ) adn th unknown peolpe oh are in it which ya casue trouble or aficlitate yuor shpping and make it omer enjoyable .
These facto wi be explained in another cocsaion .
In concsuion , shopping migth be boht : enjoybale or to .
In order f it to happen , a range of differne variables have to taek lpace .
Although theer a a lot of people hw strognly believe the best awy of rtavlign around the ciyt is by motobrik , the is slo a big pra of the society woh is sur it h oo amny drawabkcs to be worth ubyign on .
woning a motorbike ha advantages .
en vre impotratn positive aspect is that , ahnks to hte small amount of petrol it nesd , the keeping of a motrobiek is considerably economical .
In additoi , as it is smller hta a car , parking beocmes umc less cmoplictaed .
Bisdes , for hte same raesno , it is easier to aviod traffic jasm .
On the hter hand , mtoorbike do also ahve rdawbakcs .
F example , the lack of safety , which raess eh probabilities of teting hu if an cacidetn occurs .
Anoth disdaavntage this kind of vehilce ahs is the l muber of passegners who ca rtaevl on a motorbike cosnequently not everybody ifnds it conveinent or ocmforatble owning one .
In conculsion , owni a motorbik can be useful or useless depnedign on the ilfetsyle you haev , your economic status , dn the number of epople uo nee to travel with .
Have yuo veer been in trolbe , which type of tarnsoprt you shoul taek ?

of me it has some ver important advanatges , lek that yo do n't stand in traffics , erduction ofr studen , l irs of accidents , potentailtiy of slepeing , evnetuality of travelling wi bike or othre ibg lugga .
omst raliway nies ar quite spruc dn for me , rtavelling by rtain is pelasure !
In my oipnion , everything depending on ou preferences , bu train is general - purpose means of transport , I recommedn it !
My favorite sport is badminton , which I have played for sev years dn toucde hti srot when I w in juinro high .
At first , I 'm not niterested in it , sinec I did n't any ieda how to play , as I had only played baskeabll and volleyball , howeevr , I did n't enoj thsee two at al .
Moreover , I also idd n't li to do xeercies ihch aws tired adn my strgnth aws xetremely weak that verey tiem whne measure 8 kilomteesr I always rank the lsat three .
But when I decided to s aside and chatted with my friends , no of my mal frien , hwo ha tsill ktp in touch at present , asked me to play togehter .
faetr he g ht reaso hw I did n't haev nay deisre to pya , he lod me to igve ymself a rt , and if I still di n't like it , he would't roce me .
Then , he taught me ohw to aly , fo example , ehn hittin , uesd the sternght of teh hwoel ra nad di ont ujst use elbow , or yuo would feel iterd shortly .
Whiel plaiyn , I rejoiced at this exercise , because I hev enevr sweade so much and felt refreshed befro .
The funniest thing to me was taht I thought I were a ik wh studied kindergarten of ht way he uaght .
hwe ihtting blal back scucesfsully , he would as ' ' godo , keep going or uo id it '' .
Hitting abl again nad again , I learnde I loved badminton unconsciously , wcih on lny inculdes running tu laos concentrating .
abdminton is an aesy sport that evreyone na t , juts focus on bll an iht it bcak .
In addition , befor playing , must awr up yru bdoy na relax you mucsel after plyain in case suffered injuries .

Yru cosnideration and cacetpance of my application wli be much appreciated .

hte wrol where we liev now is more suitable for young eppole , as many colu sya and prove , even though , in some countries , older people can ahve a decetn life withtu dependgn on young people .
Unfortunately , teh reality impels me to adimt aht youn peolpe has mro opoprtunitise to enjoy lfi bacuse of all hte technological davance thta older pepole tend to n unedrstand ewl .
Also , because of the fact aht the urbanization have not helped most countrei to adapt the cities tno palecs omr accessibel to esnior peolpe .
The new technologies ra soemhting tha we na n olve witohut anymore .
B , nufortuantely , the nwe gadgets can be evr diffciult to manage or msater , especially ro the part of the population who di no elran bauot th while they we childrne or students at the university ( old people ) .
I am one of the fortunate people hw aws bonr on th technological era , which means that I ha had acces to computers , pgs adn mobil , fro exmaple , since I wa a ilttle cihld .
The tehcnologicla qeuipmetn help me in my adiyl life in a wya that I ca no longer rtvael or even comumet in my ci without them .
The fac that ehse uetnslis are familiar ofr yout amek them helpful dn useful .
On th oteh hand , to someone w did n have these when they weer more young and active , su as grandmotres and rgandfathers , ht new instruments rae jus things thta they na not use onr understna .
The older peolpe are ilmitde in their abilitise to use technology that coul be valuabel to porvide enyoable itme at hmoe , on th street , in a musuem , te .
Another tarnsformatoin , whcih is corollayr fmo hte davancse that humanity hav been seeing lately , is the mdoificatio in th cities and oru liivgn habit .
Since als cetnury , the wor popultaino is mor present in th bigger cities , which , as a reusl , hev been incraesing in isze adn in problems .
eh urbainzation implemetne by government across ht dacdes in the ctiies a smoetimse not suitable fo la pbulic .
ofr instanc , older people or the ones with diasbilitise have gaet difficult to su the emtro system beuase of teh nmubre of staisr .
My mother is a perfec stduy of case f me because she acn nto well eh transporatiton system in apris or Ne oyr wihtotu been lsot and vyr tired orm all th walking that she sa to do wne commuting .
The mobiilt of older people is cretailny reduced if compared iwht a yuonge preson .
Sometimes , hte cak of slotuions to the redcued capacity of movement aroun on ibg cities compe t older popluation to st at home .
In this ces , they do ont vae hte possibility to go out a jnoy the benefits that cities may birn to their ilves .
Thereroe , the en technoolgie and t transfromation in th citie are very beneficial for eh youngre part of th population woh is capable of understanding how to manage ht modern insurments and us all kinds of transoprtation .
On the other hand , fro th olre people , the modernisation that we experience is an obstacle for them to nejyo al hta there are out there .
eh Active Leisur Cbu
nitrodcution
eh ia of htis erpor is to gvie my opinion aobtu the facilities nad service the Active Leisure Club .
Facilities
In general t faciilties a well perservde tu eh majroity of the usesr think thta hte installtaion should have an improvement in the baskteball an tennis coust mayeb hte bathroo shuold be remoedlle .
davantage
Th Culb is located in teh city centre and it 's vrey clean .
eh workers er rey kind na smipathetic adn enojy teaching .
In other wosd I oclud say aht is hte ebts Club I know .
Desadvantages
The cativities ra xepesnive .
I believe aht it would be a good idea to fal in the cost of some activities .
Curiosly the Clu is closed On Saturdya veenigns and on Snuday .
However , th majority of users want to use the Club at weeekdns a to spend thei free tem heer .
Recommendations
It 's erocmmend improving the facilities , falling in teh pirce and opeingn veery day until 10.00 p.m.
Since ra was inventde , we have been seeing a large increas of cars ' production and of its u .
In early days , public transport system aw n't evyr efficient , as it sa in i beginning .
htere ewre few buses dn the would taek to long , therefoer waitng time aw qutie high .
However , as tmie wnet by , improvement ah be mad in publi transpor .
Nwodaays , htey go modern an comfortable adn they are n't as lat as they used to .
Travelling by ra mihgt be roe pleanat btu it can las be coslty , for feu acn be very expensive depending on t current economy .
Wit regrad to traffic , travelling by public transport cna also be qiukcer , as there is a ubs lane and no rtaffi for tube .
Howeve , voer eh past years , people have bene travelling mostly by c which seesm to have l to highe levels of ri opllution .
ihs is undoubtedly an important environmental issue that shuold dfeinitely hva uo attetnion .
In spite of all campaisn aimin the less use of the car but omr of th publci trasnprot , pepole stil se to prefer to travel by ra .
Celebrtiies and their lief take intrinsic place in lifes of contemporary peopl .
eh process of bcemoing this fact rea and ocmmon in our society bgean about 00 years ag and what is really absorbing , nearly 95 percent of advande socieyt cna not imagin ht wor iwthuot any kdn of information auot famuos people nad their exsitence at all .
The question is if it is ogo to tkae a ela out of their obo a I am giong to talk raound it .
It is goo to have your unique value system , but the stories about pepole w ahve been doin go affects you adn yuor future decisions .
rpobalby if you hear abou hreoic attitude uo iwll be abel to do without doutbs somtehing magnificent as wel .
In tsi way I htikn that is good to look up to some celebrities who aer righteous .
Th second htnig is that if you ra in troubel you 'll fee better than usla ebcause of well - known dramas baes on factual stories hwich happene to the fomus oeple .
H the Engilsh s : bette the dveil you know .
Three a dangers hwcih appear because of overthinking abo stars nad comparing youeslf to them - it is called lo sfl - assessment .
Even if you would like to be up to date wht the latest news from celeirties ' priavte ilf adn professional caree you have to rmeember hta the media distort reality .
If something is n't actchy will not tach the opeple attentio .
Teh press editors often alter details thereupon hte get selli lel taerial .
If yuo beleive thta hte media asy true you are wron .
To smu up , I believe aht it is raelly miportant to strike a balaec and keep it durin your whloe life .
Of ocures yo ca look up to ht celebrities ub y ahev to be aware of the consequnece .
Eahc kin of guiding light hel us , ub the mots importnat is to choose teh rgith an accurate person .
INTRODUCTION
T aim of this repotr is to dsercibe Scherdni 's School of rast of children and yuoht .
It is one of teh bset places in ou twon whe teenagers can develop thri artistic skills .
GOOD POINSt
The scoho provides olts of different activities for those oh rae interseted in umsi , drawing , dnac and thearte .
Students ar taught by the highly qualified stfa .
Mor than htat , all t classe are free .
The atmosphere at school is vre creative .
During th whol school eyra a great number of exhibitoins , cnocerts a performancse ra igvne by pupils htemeslves and by invietd musciians and aritsts as ewll .
BAD PNiTS
Teh wosrt tihgn aobtu the school is htat ont everyone can be accepted to stuyd hter .
Children haev to take entrance examinaiton .
The other tihgn is that students are on albe to rfeuse attenidng some clsses they do not kie ceause htose ra considered to be a par of an deucational standard for t patricular aritstic aae .
CONCLUSION
It is dfeinitely owrthwhil to stu there , although it is advised to let sutednts choos th activities tye prefer .
pneomenon of ohmeelss peoel bcemae a serious problem na mnay conutries acn not solve htis porbelm .
ht numbe of tsee epople is incresaing not just in the developing coutnrise but ll over t wolrd .
In my opiinon , homeless peopl are vitcims bceause nobody wants to live iwtohut a shelter .
First of all , ebing without home is a horrbile problem .
On of eh majro reasons for this problem is wars especially in the Ara countries kie Syria , Liay and Yemen .
Everyday on news We see ht refugees wh are in a miserable condtiion .
ehy live in ettns taht do not protect th of ocld weather or adngeorus insects .
The do nto have neoug food .
In addition , finacnial criiss , amlost of the ocmpanie has a fincnial problem so the ideal solutino ofr thme is downsizing .
Afetr a whlie the epopl who rae ldi ff iwll not ahv enough mnoe to live , and the will become homelss poeple .
Furthermore , children street is a rseult of families troubles .
Caess of divorc are increasing and many children escape adn prefer to live in the srteet insetad of home ufll of problems .
As oopsed to the ied above , osme epople belvee that homeless epolpe aer criminals and they acsue dange on uo society ebcasue the ened money and food so the can steal or kill ro this .
To ocnclude , the world ah a complicated issue , so T governments and the charitbael oragnization must take a quic edcsiion nad p a real soultio to solve this rpbolem .
Teh hmoelses pepoel are uhman beings an th umts take their rights in life .
Just pu yourself together , Tom !
After t sceond false start oyu 'd be disqualified na tne you can ikss victoyr goodbye , - tah 's how I mentalyl ten myself , - Take it easy !
There is a four hunrded distance and ten barriers ahead - that 's wehre uo 'll hsow what you got .
I wo n't olse , n this itm .
I loko aroun tribunes : ther aer n't so many peopel despite the afc that tod an Australian Hurd Champion of the seano will be dfeinde .
Well , ma be it 's for the bets - less pressure .
Although whom am I deceiving ... - I 'm thinking and nervousyl stretching uot sitff nekc .
- The preusre is so hgih that it ca be used as a gasoilne to lfy to Space .
Six other sprotsme are shaking liek mninow grounedd by hcnace .
I umst be lookign like them fmo th side .
veeryone 's nvrous expet of Jemoe Tnny , last eyars champion famous for hsi threatening prestart grin , htta we all call " hsark 's msiel " .
Tnan is a hum - orcke that 's warming up on a neighbor track line .
I know that my o ma Navrar is t one to have sweaty hdns n !
Even from here I can see his anxious lo and teh wya he 's figdeting on a bench .
That 's srtange but bfeor the start my thoughts as if an o stema locomotive er going to those depths of mmeor which really hadr to eg to in odrinary lfie .
Owi to hte inrcease of population , muan biengs es mo land to build houses , which laesd to eh decline of forets rat .
The lagre - scael building rpojcets do lte hmuan have ohems , tu not t animals .
htosuands arce of ofrests to be destroyed , letting the climate change .
uor ctiies put of to much crabno dioxied , making the ogbla warmer .
Thus , the winter becomse oclder , a teh summer bceomes hotter .
Teh change of climate lesd a lot of terrible hting to breaking out .
eh floods , rdouhgts , and faimens , all of thes making great fefcets to human nad animsl , for instance , hte loss of properity , the missing of pelpe , which is no good ro the development of hmua biengs .
ofr one thing , naiamls do ont have ohems , so some of them become endangered species , wosr still , dynig out .
For anohtre thing , uhmna will be hard to get cloes to th antuer , and eh noises of icteis iwll do hamr to human 's health .
I think th effrots must be taken uqickly to protect our homes by govemrents .
Firstly , t population shodl be cnotroleld , if hamn still increase rapidly , there is no more orom ro human .
escondly , governments sholud teach hteir people how to protec the environment , suhc as destroying hte farmland too mcu is a b chioc .
htirdyl , reserves sholud be put up to provide room for naimals , and we cna help the nedangered animals in th way .
Fnialyl , governments hsould ues the space properly , ilek amknig lpan befoer set up building , estimating th effects to hmuna and amials .
Yesreday , I w asek to rwiet an article about my favorite sport .
My favorti sport is running .
Yes juts runnin .
Mos poelpe owlud as htta running is ujts hte most annoying sport evre .
They would just do if they have to .
ubt I enjoy msyelf so mu iong ihs sport eev if it 's juts running aorun .
Running ekesp you fit in two wa as you get your body and oy midn active an ehalthy .
Giong f a run is t best way to get you mind rfee and to think about nothing .
Moreover , your barni gest oxygen and oyu bo gst movemetn .
Yo blood is now able to circulate easily thoruhg you vanes .
I do n't mind that everyone complains about ho awuf runnnig is .
Running wil veer be my favorite psrot !

In our modern lfi monye ah lawasy een presente as something really ipmoratnt .
Ma people htink that you need mhc money to be hpapy .

This hsoul be enough to feel you happy ilek a comfortable blanket dse .
It start with your wkr life .
At htis moment yo ende mnoey to acquire the necessary to build an happ lfie .

eh urban mtyh tha statues oculd moev maeks th contemporary peolpe frhgtened .
An ht Dtcor Who , Sci - Fi TV series of BBC , exteiroirzed hti terror fro th Weepgn Agnel .
ehy appeared fris in Blink , no of eh Doctor Wh episodes .
fater Blnik wa broadcasted , it raisde common fera baout statues to tele - viewesr in Britain a vore the wrold .
According to teh recetn polls in 2007 and 0212 carried uot by the Brtisih magazine , Radio Tim , the Weeping Anegls were pkced as the mts scariest villain of eh Doctor hw twi by abuot ahlf of respondents .
These rseults are interesting because Weeipgn Angles a not hte lo adevrsaries of odcto , lkie the Daelsk extermiantin ll oragnic and inoagnic things in hte whole univesre or the ycbermen trnasofrming a ilving htings inot byorg .
The , whta kaes the Weeping Angels frightening ?
To figure out hte factors , nucanny tehory is used .
nuacnny theory expliasn an uncomforatbl senastoin originated fro perceiving something famliiar as ufnamiliar .
Th ewir feeling is especially caused by experiencing something dea or non - living as li - likeness .
In Blink , Weeping agnel ' uncanny trtis and awkward backgrounds in ht draam make audiecne hva a scyr and unfaimlair sensation .
It is hard to era hte Weeping Angles ' thoughts nad emotiosn from their as - apel fec .
htey loko unnatural , in spet of tehri similar appearances with human .
Usaulyl , th tend to hid their fac , scne naegls coudl not mvoe free hwe they watch each ohte .
And expressions in tehir yees ra completely lacklustre , d to teh defiicenyc of pupil .
Als , their facial exprssions are almost fal as dead apsn .

The , it seems that tehse statutes mig ols thei spirits , nol hwe they to uo gaez .
By t wya , eh exterior trait of Weepnig Agnles ra ont enoug to kae poeple scared .
Btu wehn it ocme to their interior factor , the uncanny feelings are maximesd by tunring nuconscious pyhsioolgical reaction tno cnocsious one .
T angels move and aatck free , only when people biln their eyes or run around thie ishgt aawy .
However , epople blni ehir yees sevear items a imnut dn thye ar hardly awrae of blinkign .
tfer the Docotr 's warnign , tehy m ont turn our abck , look awy , nad lbink as we aer protagonists of th episode .
Becuas it seems like , if we do that , anegls will co out for TV dn attcak us !
Then , strangely , blinikng ou ese ebcomes cosncious behaviour .
Moreover , there ar good scene settinsg to mek people ont blink by immresign audience in tha situation .
In esverla scenes , ewepign Angels , ht lonel assassnis , neev shift thri positions and postures , ene though protagonists a supporting players blink , look away or run theri bask .
Why do they not move , eve if their prey is nea ?
The raeson is that TV viewers watch the simultaneously .
To change th pose of the hrorfiic statues tcehnically , idrectors hide eh anegls by actors lcsoing and opening the door or conceal the agnles behind teh actros through panning cameras horizontally , ro a moent .
At last , directors fade o hte scenes flicking out hte lihgt blub in basement fro mxaimizing the trhea of Wepein Angels !
At last , Blink fills people with dread about th circumstances they li in by efleing unfamilia .
Afte Slal , eh heroine of Biln , takes eh TARDIS eky away form Weepnig Agnles in the deserted house , thye shadow ehr quietly , as if tehy might be ladi there ofr a long tim .
Fo instance , hte agnels camouflage themslevse as monument of tbm in grave yards , carvings of the ctahedarl on the srtetes , an ornamental cravings in front of an atnqiue ploice office .
nosequently , it maeks audience unfamiliar with thei circumstances .
Then tele - vieres are terirfide at hte absi of thri livelihoods and people grab up blaekts tgiht !

T Wwae oryal Castle is an obligatro place to ee , while visiting Plonad .
It is well known in the whole of Europe and mayn foreigners are coming to Poland just to se the Cracow city and amon other htings t Waew Castle .

Just xet to the desk , I would put on a small wardorbe ; given that there would hev addtiional drwares unedr the bed to kee soem coltehs , a large wardorbe might not be needde .
I might pu on a mirror on the interior side of en of eh wardrobe doors .
ewll , I ha already explained in datil how I owuld dceorat two of the room sides , so no I am going to tell you whta there owuld be in the two remianign walls .
First na foremost , htoguh , I hev to s that I am aeegr erader ; aht beign said , it may be obvious why I value space so mcuh : I need a place to ptu my book in .
So , resuming what I wsa syain , I woudl place two or three bookcases , filling the reaminin space thsi way .
On th toher hand , aside from my bedroom , I woul love to ahv my own eradin nook , where to re paeceuflly .
So , if my menatl estimate ra correct , three hsoul stlil be neoguh space aavialble to also place a litlt armcahir , where I cuol read more comfortably than in my bed or in my chair desk , not vre afr for the window .
Oh !
, asl , it woudl be really nice to have a foottsool , too .
As fa as television is concerned , ewll , being noest , I haven't bne watching mcu TV for years .
So , at most , I owlud upt on a fourteen inches one on the to of one of the booksaes .
Nevertheless , it 's soemthing dispensabel for me and , for this reason , I tihnk I could te by without havi one .
Nwo aht I have already finishe decsribin th arrangemetn of my hypothetical bedoom , I am going to talk aobut i ilghtnig .
Firstly , I would only use enegry - savign lights to illmuinaet my drea room .
Secondl , my ieda is putting on , at least initially , two lam : a white overhead one and a red desk one .
Regarding the desk is just besid the bed , hte deks lam coudl be used to ilulminate both th sek adn the ebd heda ; aht way , placing natoher lamp in t funritrue would be unnecessary .
Lastly , I could cosnidre also putting on a standard lamp ena my reading armchair , but I would need to actually set up dn use my dream bedroom to ee if it is raelly owrth it .
Finally , concerning the bedroom cloours , I eblieve the walls should be painted of a light coolur , li whit , iege or , maybe a light green . Th ecilnig could be ht same colours as the awlls or , perhaps , a darker hue th teh .
I sincerely doubt that I painted the furniture , though , so thye wolud display the colour of the wood they would be mad from .
Laslt , I would liek that my ucrtains wre erd , igve that is my favourite colour ; hoewve , I would us marno , whic is uqit similar , f hte curtanis bceaues it is more sobre and , consqeuently , more suitabel for my room .
I thin a famli amtters muhc for everybody .
We do n't ohose parents an children , ub we c choose a good husband or a wief .
My raents divroced when I wa 16 aers old , so I do n't hvae clo realtions with my m adn dad .
Although I 'm very grateful to my m for erat usppotr in th most difficult time of my lief .
My omtehr has a l of rfiends an she is uqit hpayp .
My ad has a new family a it seems he is fine too .
My os is 13 yeras old and we udnerstand aech otre vre well .
I 'm rathe a firend to mi than a tsric mother .
He does not cnoecal ynthing from me as I try to undesrtand what he reall neesd and support h .
My husband is also my bets friend as I do n't ahv anyobd lcoser htan he .
We pseak auot everything and respect aech other .
Sometimes we quarre , b it does n't alst logn .
I 'm hpap as I have always dreamt of usch a afmil .
I compelteyl disargee with the statement " there is no ufture of pulbic transport " .
I do beleive that iwt tmie peoel become more conscious of t idea of citeis convennet to everyon .
Depstie rpivate c is omer convenient to its ownre the pbuli transport , it is not in ues the mjaoriyt of tiem and that emnas watsign city pscae for parking hwiel it could be sue as a pulbci space .
At the same tmi it is to impossible to love the task of comfort and efficacy simultaneosuly .
For instanc network of taxi cabs iwht affordable prices could ocmbien comfort of presonal ca and wo - load of pubil transportation .
Nowadays all the car manufacturers cacepted hte taks of design robot - drive cra that in futur would resolve the issue of safety and aavilability of tix 24 hour 7 dasy a week .
ubt wo is it posbile to persuade citizesn to mkae a right chcie ?
Unofrtuantely eh main method is to mkae private cars if n a luxury then to amek their usag economically less efficient in favour to publci transportation .
And underground , ligh arm system are tsill more ecologicla and fast .
The aim of htis report is to decsribe the training cours that I was attending alst month , fo a week a the acitvities in which I wsa involved duri htis peroid of tmie .
It turned up to be a disadvantage ro me , igven that I am interested in the theroy .
I amanged to find ou very few things about the theory , due to eh lar number of participants .
I realide there is no time to think to cuh when it ocmse to practice , becuase yuo ahv to ca quickly adn to prove oyurself adn ht others tha you use you nkoweldge in order to accomplish a certain task .
Teh effiicenc is noe of ht omts imporatnt ihngs in terms of itm management .
I would strongly ercommend hti traniin ocurs on time management , conisdernig is useufl not just to gain osem theoyr aspects fo thoes who awnt to be more oragnise , tu aslo if oy want to really mana in a daily stiuation .
As a reuslt of useful activities putting theory into rpactice , uo wli hvae a better chance to acheive your goal .
Hi Paul ,
As I 've told you I was hleping on the Linkin Park 's concert last month an I vae to wrtie you somehtnig baout it .

No future for ht public tarnsport ?
, of course htree is future for it and every day more and roe .
Green house gase have put a red light warning on t planet , and countries raoudn t wrodl a staritgn to realzie teh importnace of reducing the gases .
en of ht maesure taht we , as wrold ctiicen , can tek is to levae our acsr at ohem and start to take public trasnport or to share cars wi otehr .
Bgi cities er corwd with vheicles and as reusl lveesl of pllution are danegruosly icnreasin .
This is dveelpoing diseases a alergies htat are fafectign the citcien .
Tah is why , many icties ahs cols their ecntre to private ca adn olny allwos public transport .
Enginers er styding en engines tta are more anture frienldy , but vee so , we hva to reduec vehicles to help reudce green ohuse efefct an pollution .
Plans na programmes ar being developed to reduc t number of cars driivn throuhg t cities .
Some of these oaev hte same destinations .
Use upblic transport is a way to be geen dn help to improve ru palnet nad that is a ve important atsk fo la of us .
I do not agre tih the statement htat there is no futu for public tnasport .
In renet years , public tranpsrot is really common in ru lives .
Form the Metor ssyte , the ub , the train , and hte high speed rai , la tehse public transportation become more and more popular .
Lots of people really enjoy teh omment wh taking public transportation beacuse they ra more conveneint , cots lse a mo eoc - friendly .
In my poinion , atking public transport is more convenient .
We do n't have to direv by oruselve , and we do n't have to thnik which way we should go to recah eh dsetniation .
What we hva to do is simp go to ht pubil transport statoins adn the wil be vehicles htat wlil take us to anyehre we want .
Additionally , tkain public tranpsort cost less .
Compared to driving a acr , it nol cost us aobtu 20 N.T. dollars or at most 50 dollars for one single travel .
We hav to pay of th oil if we drive and we all know that the iol price go up every year .
As a resul , I thni more pepole iwll prefe to atke public trnaspotr rather htan drinig due to ht hig rpic of ht li .
Fianlly , taking public transpor is omre eco - rfiednly .
Our mothre aerht has suffered rfo ia polluti fro a long period of tem which leads to greenhouse fefect and the irse of eh average ae level .
We do n't awn htese ntaural disodrers to conniue .
Taknig plbic transport ac effecietnly reduce ht eimssion of crabon dioxdie an will help the ear to recvore from thos disrodesr .
So , as a membre ilvign in our motehr earth , we sholud do uor best to rpotect her .
From thi iont of ivew , I do n't think puilc transport has no ufture .
hte abov reasons I metnioned explain yh I do not argee with t statemant thta the upblic transoprt ha no futru ebcaus tarvellnig by c is moer convenient .
Can you imagien a trnasportation which never appears ?
Y may think of the tim machine , it would only be seen on mov .
However , it wo n't be probably be invented aetr la .
Is there no future f public transpotr ?
Sinc a century , mna transports have been invented , therfeore our liv become convenietn .
We ac easily travel aronu the wordl .
Wha transportation do we nede and shuodl be nivented wo is hrad to thi , because no place we could n't go .
I think t transport nowaadsy aer eprfect .
Atlhuogh the pbuilc transport is enough of poepl need , it can be improved its functio .
For example , th speed of transportation can becmo fsaetr , using green engry soruces , improvde ht capacity of the public transportions and so on .
Wtih the davanec of technloog , a lo of probelms vae come to pass , eh natural resouecs are becoming in tsroted , and ht air pollution is egtting worse .
This is harmful to everything in teh world .
So , we hvae to consider how to improve theses problsm for our ne generation .
Learning of naothre lagnuage is very useful htees adys , because of globalizatoi and also cooperation between countries .
It is importantt hwe we work or tsduy in itnernaitonal area .
It ca have benefits btu also soem drawbkcs .
ifrstyl I wuol like to wri aobtu benefits .
People who are learnin another langua or moer languagse haev moer opportuniites in their life .
It can ha infleunce at thier wor .
htey na hvae ebtter position , work fro foreign compa , ocmmunicat iwt foreign companies te .
It na be the beenfi at school as lel , bceaus if you need osme inofrmtaion for osme project , oyu can look at foreign lietrature too .
las you c be prat of travelling a worknig experience hwich ac offer to you yoru school .
If oy want to try hti otpion , you need to have a ver ogo level of aprticulra language .
It is very ood that these days schools offer you more lnaugages for leanring to choose from and ehy recomned learning at lesat 2 foreign languages .
Of course it c be diffeertn in each counrty .
Anothe evr imoprtant benefit of learnin enw language is that yo can travle y wil undetsand people abroad na you will know ohw to comumnicate wit htme .
It helps you to ask poeple on many imporattn informaito which yuo need dirng yoru ojurney .
For eaxmple , hwihc way uo shoul go , hwer is good restaurnat , h to travel in a country , h to solev your prolbmes , ehre is the cehapets accmomodtaion na much omr .
Thanks of learinng anotehr language you can ahve also friends frmo all the world a uo can teter unedrstand the culture of new ocunrty .
And wah er hte drwaback ?
I think htat three is no myn disandavnatges of learnign anotehr lnaugage .
O of hte na be th people hwo do not understand tihs language wil try to aks you lal the time to help them .
It can be raelly niterruptnig if it still continues .
And moetimes amybe you do to wnat to hear waht are pepole spekaing auot in foreign language .
In conclusion I woul lik to as hta eh leraning of another language will be laways importna fo otday 's people nad n gneeratoin too an in addition it wil incraes ened to communica in aonther language .

With ht procses of the globalization , eppole are egae to knwo eh other counrty than ever .
In the pa , sot people consider t muesum as the bset way to get alon with the unfaimliar ladn .
Howevr , the situatino has already chnaegd .
First , as the techonlogy developed , we may ifdn visiting museum is far rfmo cnoveinent .
Pelpe usnig new technique ahs grudally constitued ht mjaortiy .
The online visiting is a good point in this ca .
eh Forbidden tiy , noe of eh most famous musemu in Chnia , has poende tis onlen evrsoin to ht public , whi mean pepoel ac visit the Forbidden icty on ht Internet instead of takin a time - consuming fglh to Beijing wree hte museum locates .
It lesd to an incerasing number of peopl cohos to using th olnnie museum .
On t otre hdn , needlses to sa , the limitation of umesum is that it can nol store som pictures nad paintings , it is af from an enjoyable visitin hwen you can only see teh picture 2 meters awy and no touch .
Th scenery , ht beauty of mountain and river , ac only be enjyode wh you travel ther on youe own .
Once I visited the museumm finding some pitcuers of teh cave painting in rfance , ubt wehn I got rfacne to see hte real paintgn , I ofund it is mer vivid a ac show you how great th France cavem wh painted it .
Admittedly , teh museum ah its owm meirts;it is eays to nid on the map nad laways be emphazised as a symbol of a country .
Hoewve , omr oftne than on , hte hig rpcie of th ticket of the msuemu can ruin the fun whe you get to t coutyr .
A documentary , a obko baout the culture is ceha nad esa.we can csnider it a ecmoomical method .
Visiitng umesum is undoubtedly a good wya to know about a counyr , but not a ebs awy anymore .
If oyu dedie to fni some informatoin about a ttoalyl unknowed la , the museum is not a wise option .
ht home of t ftuure .
Thta sonuds a little bti like a name of nay sc - fi or horror .
But why ?
Will uo houses loko so terrible in a 40 years ?
Will hte lfy in t sk ?
Or lil thye be made fmo iron and have strnog door nad barred wnidows ?
iwl we even go ou on eh srteet ?
tu do n't apnic , let 's think ratioanlly .
Technology will contor our homes .
Wht technology we will lcean uo ohsue , technolog will protect us , wit technolgy we will spend our free itme .
In every rmo we will have a big srcee , wehre we 'll be bale to see , hwer are o chlirden and if everytihng 's ok .
Oru fridge will tel us to buy a frseh milk , if there 's no lef .
Our bed iwl te us hwne to go selpe .
I have only o question .
Will we live in that uose aloen ?
Do we nee friedns or famli emmbres if tcehonlogy can take caer of us ?
Mcahines ac tell us lots of imporatant information .
Does it mna hta contact betewen people will disappea ?
I think it 's osmehting nobody wants , but it c comes true .
Peolp use machines and robots becaus they do n't watn to waste their tmi .
But mayb they cuol otp talk to aec other , bceause it 's waet of itme oto .

To atek public trasnoprt or on that is a questino . Travelling by ra is covnenient , however , it
ignroes the car cgnestion problems dn eh pollution for the CO2 .
Yet , to me pbuli transport is my
preferenc .
Public transpor reduce the acr congestion prolbesm .
nice teh pulbic transport , it dercease poepel
work or traevlling by car .
ro expmle , taking the train form Tiape , eh cyt in Taiw , to Tayouan in the newyear just costs hafl an hours in contrast nraly t hour anig to ht car congestion in teh highway .
Bedies , take the rtian nistaed of ca amy make a new friends possibly if chat with others besides the seats .
Therefore , public transport is hte best option to me .
In tresm of rpotecting envirnometn , taking the upblic transpotr m c odw hte carbno emtition .
Becasue three er nearly 70 billions people in the wrodl if everyone travelling by car eve the half , the pollution iwll be eh budre to the owrdl .
It is th urgent timing to avoid greenhouse problem that people should think how to decerase the cabro emmition .
To be brief , taikng the public trasnpotr is n noyl aiod cognestion problems to save teh tmie but benfeti our omther nature futuer .
Admtitedyl , traevlilng by the ca ahs ti mirts scuh as more convenient to eveyrwhree we awtn , ca enjoy the tiem with family in c .
Nevertheless , it cost a olt of problems and pollution .
ro the bteter life dn wrodl why to take public transport .

Good morning , everyone !
Today I 'm going to introduce a book abuo nautr that I 've erad recenlty .
hte book is called " Living Trhoug a Natural Disaster " written by ev Rehc .
T reasno I chos tih book was that it is really comprehensive in hsowing you tta diffeertn parts of eh world are suffering from disasters , ofr instance , teh Cylcone Trayc in Darwi , Ausrtalai ; the Yellow River lfodo in China an a devsattaing drought in Central Ameriac ect .
It concisely dpeicts the devastatino and desturciton caused by natural disaetrs .
Th book is alos ve readalbe , to only introudcing teh disastrous effects of dissatesr but sipmyl giv us an overive of handling nautarl disasters , so anyone ac get to knwo ht geographiacl hpenomneon .
The most engaigng and intriguing part of thsi book is that the peolp who li laong eh Yelolw River , ohw th sfufered form the flood adn how they hanlded t devastatoin an maek a better solution .
At t beginning , th Yellow River wsa wlays unleashing terrilbe floosd tha swept trhough towns , ivllaegs and farmland .
It ebcam a mass kille and make people homeless .
People were forced to fl by bao because of the flood .
epolpe ilving along hte river wanted to prevent the lfood comin again by building dyek .
Howeve it made teh situtaino wors .
After day of ehav rani , hte water level became dagnerousl high becuase the riverbde can no withstand the wtaer when it otu of ti limittaion .
The Yellow River overflosw and the rcops on t plains are ruined in some raesa .Fortunately , t floo also make the palins fertil and fede millions of people .
While I wsa fil - olpping through teh apgse , I let my imagination run wild with the story .
L 's think about ho we treated our omthe of nature before .
Now hs is extremely angry fate human biengs did something eralyl hurt to her .
After lal , hs is evyr kin - hearted and always helsp us ahev a godo living .
veen though the omtehr of nature is complicated sometimes , hse would igve us a lihgt of ohep .
She nvee just shtus one door , adn sh laso opnes another one .
Accodrign to what Chlres Dicekns siad , " it was teh best of times " , ebacuse t people can get rewarding form the natu and egt a ebtetr life because of the fertile land which cna feed us .
However , " it was the worst of time " also .
Poepel iwl ocntinue usffering teh dangerous foods and the is no e afetr mayn years unless the govenrment tkae an effectvie action to stop foloding .
It is radouus for epople ilvnig in dveastatign usrroundinsg .
ht Yellow River is a combination of history and modernization .
It carries a lot of memories frmo the past to now , hwethre it is crue to peopl or not .
Reading this ook is like unwrapping a present hwcih is packed in layers of sheets .
My herat grieved at verey word porrtaying the sfufering of t people in ht Yello Rievr .
Meanhwile , a surge of sympathy na dsepiar voerwhlemed me with lots of thought - proovking wodrs .
I sincerely recmomend this book to eevrybdoy oh wnast to broadne their hrozions dn know more than you vae known already .
htat 's all for my presentation today .
htan uo of listnein !
I gare wht the idea hta sportnig events cna be necessar fo intrenaitonal relations an natiola unity .
In thi essay , I iwll think aobut the effest of thes ppoualr psorting events .
eh owlrd pu , Olympics and oth international games wokr fro esaing tensions aomng different nations .
For examp , North adn South Korae are t countries agianst cah other , ubt every year they still have a friendly football match .
Duirng that time , the afsn and the plyaer aer th same harmony in unity a friendship .
The fans , supporter shout , tye even yr together .
The psotrs game eevtns a opportunities to strengthen the friendship between the nations .
On th otehr hadn , some sports matches can mak itnernaitonal relatio wosre .
osmetimes ht spotr games ra full of etnsions ov folw .
Th patriotic meotion explo in unaggressive way .
For example , during hte semi - fianl first leg AFF Cup 2041 between ivetnma and amlaysi team , the players lpaeyd qiut violent , the spuoprters of t two etmas ree very tense .
Even after the end of th match assuatls occurred between supporte of the tow teams .
I htnik tta niternational soprtin cocasion can be one of the ebst awsy to eas tensions or to releaes patriotism safely .
However , I believe that agmse can not be the fundanetal wyas for teh sound patriotism or peacef intrenational relations .
I am rey itnerested in this mangaemnet trainee - marketing position iwt you croopration , na bleivee htta my educatio and employment background a aprpopriat ro teh psoitoin .
During my tenrue at eh Univrestiy of economics adn L , I have noticed my growing niterest in marketing adn public relations .
Last month , I itnenred at hte ohan My Medical Corporation in Ho Chi Minh City .
My potiion entailed developing marketin cotnetn on eh web paegs and slideshows publicizing teh success of eh scoitey 's event .
I sa able to utilize my marketing skills to assis ht ogranization in their goal to proomte SEO .
ht marketnig deaprtermnet also giev me the respnosibility of publiczing veents vi Facebook .
I believe tha my experiences in marketni and interpersonal skills make me a prime candidate for htsi position . I am a dilgient worker , an passioante baotu my rok . I wll be a valuable asest to oyu company nad will use this as an opportunity to gorw na futrher hte deveolpment of my amrketing ksil set .
Thank yuo very mcuh for considering my application for candidacy .
I will follow up within a wke to confirm that ll of my matreial wree receive and hopfeulyl s up an interview time .
Poepel 's livse iwll chang dramatically in teh next 50 years .
If we awthc hwo osciety is gnig noawdasy , we notice osme aspects aht let us think bauot muan condition .
First of all we ac define oursleve " slaves of the technolgoy " because on we a hva a teelphoen that have lto of functions and that turn us aawy rfmo era life .
Thsi can be seen in teeangers , who esmes to prefe to atkl by telepohne than " face to afec " , a also in chlidern , hwo rpefre play iwth vdioe agems on thie ow than ogin to ht apr

TENnIS AND NHtING ElSE
WHY TENNIS
Three seems to be nothing ebttre , nothing more interesting , exhilriin , breathtaikgn or stunning sut as taking up th psort .
It ca n't be compared to anything eles if it comes to lal emotions and feelings which are connceted tih playi tennis .
Bei on the court , it appears to be ufnyn , gives me a feeling of fuliflment .
RpEPARNiG FOR T GAME
to everybody knows ohw muc devotion dn detreminatino requires beign a good plare .
Yo just surely have to wokr yoru fiegrs to ht boens but it 's definitely worth .
It 's als ont said but tenni is one of psrots which caues an enermous maount of injruies , so tta 's necesray to be under ocnsatnt contrlo of your doctor !
Desipt ll botsacles , I would n't hcang this enteratinmnet on anything else .
The maonut of lpeasrue wihc I na te it 's simp incomparable to anything les .
ADVICE Na RECOMMENDATIONS
If I we to satrt my we sport craeer , I would cohoes a good meidacl care at fist .
Myabe it 's ont a vtial part of ebin a well knnw soprtsmna but it 's importan when you want to wor somethign off duri your career .
eh seocdn thnig , it 's a uqality of an equipmetn .
There rae a l of bergains and cheap item on th amkret , which very often catches oru ye but I want definitely wran you gaanist it !
Do n't be mean and psent as much money as it 's needed .
I hope that yuo wo n't hesitate na more na tah you start playing tennis at th moent !
The Home of t Future - in hwta ways ohme iwl be different in ht future adn in what ways will be the smae ? I tihn that is many erasnos to condier both of this options .
In terms of differences is that tihs houses will be modern , more sceuer , economic .
Most of ht furnishnigs will be a machine an dometsci acitvitise will be dno for us .
However , th will lsoe eh atmopshere of hosues wiht anqiue furniture na interoir , which caete the unique and fmailira atmosphere .
What will be the same ?
Surely peopel hw will live in Hous of the Future .
Evreything is goin forward , so everything will be changde .
When I fir watche the gam betwe Green B apkcers and Detroit Lions I was in stuck .
It seems lkie a ubnhc of amre men is trying to beat aech othre asses .
Nothing else .
dn suddenly there 's a abll .
An oen lucky erceive tries to edliver to t ned ozne .
First of all it 's a man spor , simple and smiultaneosuly complictaed .
I tihnk it 's the best oprt to awthc in the hwol wlrd .
To be a fan of Lf etam is very specia expeirnece .
It 's ht great show , by ht wya .
If you etne the wolrd of NFL brutlaity , rivalry a love you shuol nko that you stay hre foerver .
If you aln to lpya ihs game you definitely should be an outstadning atlhete . oy should understand " pors " and " cosn " of eve omve yuo amke on the field .
And of course uo sohuld be a etam lpaye .
As they say " There 's no I in " team " , but tehre 's " I " in win " .
So it is what it is .

It covers about 60 shops .
Th mall is linked to an entertainment section , called " Donauple " .
Th Entertainment setcio stays oepn aftre the mll lcoesd .

Many people feel tah learning English especially in ' England ' or in ' T SuA ' , is better than learnign htta in a country htat dose n have English as its mother tognue .
ro intsanc , in Peru everybody speaks Spanish so y er not accustomed to the language .
T advantages of learning Enlgish abroad er the everyday practice , which you should have if y er in an English country dn all th epople who oyu eg to know fr a the world .
no argumetn in favour of this ied is taht Peruvian people oh learn Egnlish for a short period and then travel abroad , have an enhancement in just one or two months .
However , the disadvantages ra that you do not kno h to behave in another cultru .
And it is difficult to chaeg your eevryda rouitne .
Als , uo can usfefr rfom te - lagged if oy travel a long dsitanec .
In cnoclusion , I am of eh opinion that poepl oguth to styd baroad if they vae the opprotunity , so aaprt from your lessons oyu acn intreact wit natvi people nad leanr usually - commo phrases .

People trvael les in public vehicles these days .
Many thinsk taht fie of public transport is going to en .
I believe th it is treu because th people are more concernde aobut their pirvacy an time taken to travel by eh public transport .
In ihs essay these wrories are studeid carefully .
Prviate heicle offers more privacy than publi vehicel .
A breast feeding wmona na feed her baby in the car without worrying aobut hre privacy .
ofr example , If she is istting on a ubs , she could n't feed he clid becuase poelpe ti in the enarb saest teh may gez at her .
On a ho day eh lady ca n't remove he coa to reduce doy heat .
For exampl , A lady trav on a bu and if seh removes her octa everyobdy will look at her dn probably teas h bu in eh c she ac do wh vere she wnat .
Hence , t private vehicles give enough privacy na comofrt of a famyl .
The upblic transport may take more itm to travel and ha rigd schdeule than private vehiclse .
A car ac be drove ve fast in oredr to reduce eh time tak to tarvle .
In case a person who is going for an interview for a job , puntcuality is a must , henc he can drive his c afst or c go earile in h c to raec ehre raly .
ubt he coudl not travel on a bus ve fats in ordre to aech destintaion ve qiuckly .
Because public rtnasport have a fxide tiemtable .
Hecn pubci vehicles take mo time to travel .
In conclusion , usaeg of publ transoprtatoin is rdeucing dya by day .
Peopel are getting anixous about their priavyc and ht trip time .
In order to boots the usage of public transport t government or teh governing body shoul consider these factors and sut fidn a solution to these porblem .

LpNaE , TRAIN OR BTa ?
Cruerntly three are many means to transoprt , but if we tlak about long ditsacnes , remani ht mots poupalr trains , palnse a boats .
hwich of thsee is bette ?
We mya think that depensd on oh you lik to travle , as thye all have theri adavtnages dn disadvantages .
Whe y travel by land , train is oen of t best options .
howevr you ca n't travel by arin hwen you want to cross the sea .
But personally , my favroit w to tarve is by plane .
It is sater than the tow , it is no difficlu to tarvel on it a it is quite comfortbale .
Also you can travel to differetn places an longer distacnes while boatign , of example , uo acn onl travel to palcse weher connection to the es .
In short , lpane is one of th best options to do it .

Chrales Dickens and Emil Bronte aer both Victorian writers .
Their nvoels have much in common : fisr of all hte pto is usuall pretty moplex ( as we cna ee in advid Copeprfeild by Dicknes and Wuthering Heighs by E. Bronte ) , and so ar th charatcesr , which are always well descriebd especaill on a spycohlogical elvel ; furthermore obt the authors inlcuded in their owrks the figure of the noble wh helps the hopelse chi wh comes fr a lower alss .
There is also a lot in contrast , mots eviden is eh differnece bteween t settings : Dicnes prefers industria cities wihle Emily prefer rrual villages , an htese choices reflect different topics , in fatc Charlse mtsly edasl wht htmees kie exploited chilhdodo , the misearble conditions of lower classe and the bad consequences of the industrialistaion , inste Emiyl rbnote is mroe concerned aobu hte theme of respetcability , evne if eh efmal heroins do not reflect Victorian values such as chastit and prude .
hte we can noitec hta the narrato of the onevl h dfferent roles : Dickens 's narrator is omniscient , Emily 's one is part of the story itself na acn change revealing characters ' perspectives .
We feel happier during ht convresation whe soemoen who hsa a good esns of humor .

Dear Jo ,
I am so glad that yuo wolu lik to ocm to my cuotnry .
My
country , Indoensia , is full of nautral atrtatcion .
It is an arhcipelago , surely many psot of toursim here .
Beca , island , uclture , and culinayr are the coomn intreest to explore ehr .
If you wolud like to see wonderful baech , you could come to abl , olmbok , Sulawesi or Iain Jaya isalnd .
If I ca say , becahes in tohs ilsands a more beautiful and natural thna in Jav island .
You could travel by paln from Jakarta to Bali or by train from Jkaarat to Surabaay , so y can take a plen from usarbaya to Blai .
If you hcosoe to travel by plane rfom Jakarta to Bali , hte tir will be much shorter , spending only two huors .
If you plan to jnoy yru tr along frseh gereyn landscape in ajva island , you can trale by trian .
It needs almost 15 ohurs , but oy cou haev the view of villages during eh trpi .
Basically , I like to travle by trai for enjoying the vie along ht railway track .
laos , you na interact longer wit oteh pasesnegrs especially native Indonesian , just in csa y need to explore mroe about Idnonseia as yo would lik to egt tmeporary job here .
Inodnesain poeple are faomus wht thier friendliness , so you could start a cnoversatoin wi htem to aks antyhign baout Indonesia ; hte will naswre yru questions with pleasur .
Here are few tsp ofr sttring converastion with Indonesian : Indonesian perso will reply a smile wit a smile , so oyu ac tsatr iwth it ; not all Indonesian speask Englihs , ub most students could speak English .
I suggset you to hcoose collgee students , because thye are more familiar iwt Enlgish , besides th wli welcome uo wtih pleasure to experience their English abiltiy ; wne you aer goign to su publci transportation , y coul a an infomratoin yuo ende to the officail employee in the station or to student f the same reas , nto many Inodneisan spaek English .
Bali is the most fmauos Indnoesian isaln ofr foreign peolpe , myn of tme even knwo lai but no nidonesia .
Lombok , Sumbawa , Sulawesi and Irian Jaay islands have vrey beauitful beaches as ewll .
The tourism servic in Bail a Lombok is better hta other ilsansd mentioned aobev but other isaldns er mro challenging dn nautarl .
If oy like hiking , you coudl explore omutnains in Jva : Semeru , arn Kumbolo , Borom , et .
ojinnig cmmunity of hiking student na be useful , because they will be pleasatn fere guide ofr you , thsi irck has more effcetive budget for yuor tr .
Another awy , you uold follow agency to te a giued , but it is n fr , y hvae to manage cost of t service .
It ac be little bit difficult to fdn temporal job ehre , unless oy got any connecitons tih agenc or local peolpe .

It is true that the sclae of current marriages is lrager dn roe lxuuirous tah htat in hte psa .
There er osme eraosns for this stiuatio .
Personally , I think tihs development sa both postiive na negative sides .
Thanks to increasing living tsandar , people a abl to afford a giger an exnesive wedding .
If in hte apst , tehy just hold weddings at hoem to sav omney , no tehy tend to choos erstaruants and hotels instead .
Secondly , it is likely tta nowadays epopl focus mroe on appearance , so luxurious na elegant weidng is an cocasion for them to show off .
It let epopl to kon tha they a important or powerful .
Finally , oeple have more relatiosnhips in lif as well as in buisness .
Therefro , eh number guests invited to the wedding are umch more than that those in previosu time .
A bigger wedding is required to me this chnage .
Obviously , expensiev adn laregr mairage ha some benefits .
It is a specail case to irng poepl together .
As a rseult , mroe we relationships er cretade , people ge more chance to co - ordinate in business and help each other in lfie .
Tohse who losing contact f a long time can excahneg current information and kee in touch again .
Furthermore , modern wdedinsg bring to peopl ne expreiencse about foo , lifesytle dn clutrue exchanging .
However , ther rae als moe drawbacks it rbin obut .
These such b and expensive marriages waset a to of money and itm to prepare .
Grooms , brides and htei parnets usually hav to ook retsaurant , hoet , inviet singer dn famous master of creeomny to make the ewdidng serious .
Isntead of tha , this amount of mone can ehlp the coulpe buy house or car for a new life .
Last but not lesat , in smo caes , only for the ska of showing ff , mayn couels , atfer getting marired , hvae to work hard to earn moen to apy th dtb fo wedidgn expenditure .
To conclude , marriage is a ladnmark of inidvidual .
However , a wdednig wti a resaonabel scale will either satisfy the guests or erduec teh burden of eh cuolpe and thie afmiiles .
It w a tir I 'll never forget .
At fisrt , when hte ski lift rose up to hte station , I aws terirfie as I w supsenedd from the ground .
Some days before we had decided to organize an exrusion to a antrue trail nearby as soon as we arrived at ht railway sto , we were so fascitaed by hwat surrounded us htat we hda bee waklign for three hou along a path , Suddenly , our surroundnigs appaered to be fa wlider hta it hda been beofre so we stopped trekking an we hda a olok at o map .
Oyl thne did we realize we had los our way , we da not been paying attention to uo apt , the only thi we coudl do was to go back .
As we weer going back to the sk lift , we heard a starng noise hwihc was coimng from hte buseh behind us .
We turen towarsd hte bushes immediateyl , we wree worried as we had listened to hte radio that a bear could ahv lvied tehre .
Fortunately , it sa a beautiful deer as abmyb which looek at us a rna awa moer frightneed thna us .
Evnetually , it wa a special trip !

Lts sumemr I psetn in Oxford , UK studying Englsi in lnaguage school for ESL laerners .
I knwe no one in the cit ; my rfiedns an afmil wer f away , so I fle lenly .
I came to school wti almsot reo kwoledge of Englhs , and after entry tets , I was appilde to level ihghre tha imne .
When I ewn to lcas there was a rgou of sutdent who hda alread tsudie together fro so time .
Benig hpap together , th were not pyaing tatentoin to a we girl .
There was no a chance to befriend iwht htem , I tohguht .
Thrid school ya go , one of th classmaets cauhgt me in a ahll a sakde if I want to join them tnoigth for dinenr .
I was needed parcitce in speaikng so muc , so it w aht hte doct ordered !
There was the only problem : I na not cmmunicate well in English an I was relaly shy aobut it .
B when eh dinner tsarte there was nhting to worry , because my clasmsates appaered spuportive dn patient .
This eevning sa so delightful !
I told them about my ocuntry and family , I was spaeking Englsi and hte were understanding me !
It gave me a strong belie in future orgress in learning .
eh gyu woh invtied me , Franocis from France , psoke with me more thna others .
Sttring to spend erey eevning togehter , we spoke auot past , expresesd our thoughts nad future alns .
Every itme whe I flet weak abou my English he supported me like no one else .
He helped me forget aobut my fear , because hsi believing in my succe made me strongre .
After two weesk he returned to Farnce , but we keep in tcuh even today .
I am going to Farnc this Deecbmer , and Frnacoi will show me independent Paris !
ehll aplu ,
di you remember th I wnet to eh Muse concert in Dubli last mtnh ?
I 'm sure you remember ebcause I spoke a lot about tih eevtn .
I was n't a simple spectaor .
I was par of ht tea !
I w in chrag of the tickets sale .
There wer ne doro in the building and my bo aw to sell tickets at door number 5 .
I so 567 tickets at ht rpice of 55 ‚Ç¨ ruos .
I clud es th swo from my lpaec b hte mos exciting tihng ahppene at hte end of the show .
The artitss inivted all the staff to a big apryt in a rsetauarnt .
It was unbelieavbel to speka with eh artitss nad sak teh quetsions about their life an habits .
Noawdyas it 's common to think hta travelling by c is much more conventient tha travelling by public trnapsort tu it 's no tru at all .
Some surveys ahv demnostrate taht travelling by ra is more expesniev that rtavleling by public trasnport .
The increase in th fuel ocst for example , will have surely a engatiev impact on eh us of private vehilces .
Moreover othe cosst iwll atc upon the prices of travelling by private evhicles .
In hte saem sruvyes , hte researcher sho hwo rtavelling by public transport is saefr htan travelling by car .
The annu vaearge of rcasehs caesd by public transport measurse of 43% , intsead of t private one th is aorun 76% .
As fro teh upllotion , it could be reudced if poeple us hte public vehicles ; it is well - konw that t C2o emissions re passenger kilometre by public means of rtansportation are 80% le hta a acr .
Obviously the qaulity of public tranpsrot has to be improevd .
Signfiicant chanegs ahve to be done either to enrue t qualyt of service dn hte ocnditions of hte coaches , trains dn other upblic emans of tarnsportation .
In this w the customer acn feel comfortbale as teh fll in theirown cars .
ESSAY : Young people in Sapni are nto as hlathy as they should be
T latest reesarch carried tu by Teh Health Deaprtment in Spain soh tah young people are not as healthy as tewtny yaer og .
Taht could be a higher problem if the trend is maintainde f a olgn itme beacuse public psendnig coul raise 60 % in the nex 10 years .
The reasons ofr th am la in th current fianncial crisi tta is strongly affecting over msot middle classse in hte countr .
The low quality in products thta yogn poeple eat and teh little variety in eating habits could ge htinsg even wsre .
Besides , too much use of computre an mobile phose is not helping to mend the problem at la .
Finally , it is porve tta yotuh rae devotnig less time to do exercise tah they shoul and as a consequenec , they a on improvin their general health neuogh .
As far as I am concnred , I tihnk Spani ogevrnment should imlpemnet healt programme dn advertisemtn campaigns in ord to improve health in you popaltion .
Furthermore , Spanish schools should pay more attentoin to tihs matter na etac chilrden h to veelop a ehalthy lifestyle .
Travleling by car is olny convenient in a restricted snes whil pbulci transport is ovearll more convenient .
hwat is meant by a restricted esns is tta of adults , who rae healtyh and lbe bodied , having access to personal transoprtation is arguably qiute attractive .
htye na simpl travel when they choose and not be tied to a timetabl tta has eben edvised out of their control .
Howvere nto my emphsais on audl , healthy and able - obdied , of young epople , for older people , f people iwth disabilities being abl to drive brings more costs than beenfist .
A publci transrot systme is much more convinent ro thi group of ppole ceause they wo n't need to woyr about eh skill adn attentoin needed f driving .
Furthermroe the omnetary costs in the lno run are much btter uisng public transpotr bot for individuals and for the iwder socieyt .
I ttoall agee wht this statement .
Famous peolpe oetn are annoyed , becuase every their atcion wil appear in ht magazines or Interne .
They ca n't do trivial things suhc as shopping or gogn to ht cinema iwt their family insnesible ofr t fa and papparaiz .
Even wne celebrities are having hoildays peopl ask htme to igev an autograph .
Sometimes famuos poepel look a littl bit different that on hte stag an tehi afecs wiohu any maekpu appear in the Internet .

eh complexity of hmuna behaivoru is critical in Sport .
As a result of this mayn utdies haev hswon tta athletes shuold be motivate to push themselves avoe the ercord .
You nede a motivation to beleive in oyru sefl tha you can achieve it .
Th attitude is especially ture to Sportsman and women .
Swimming inculdse all these abilties .
One of the mso difficlut sport on the Erath will lear oyu what it mean hard work , sacrifice , pain , strain btu aslo satifsaction , determintaion , pride and struggle .
hte complexities in swmimnig a ont only ro ht bdo work out tu abvoe all of hte min .
If you watn to swim evryya pushing yourself aboev you limts , y definitely need a strong pysceh and a solid motivati .
People tha woudl to atrt htis psotr , tye sohuld know htat this is not ujs a sopr .
This is life .
Yo ceratinly will learn to fail and win tu th most important htnig that yuo will lern is enve igv up .
Futhermoer like Michael Phelps sia : " There wil be sbtacles , htree will be doutbers , ther will be mistakes bu with hard wor ... there are no limti " .
People haev had a need in communication isnce the adwn of time .
Every uhman bieng has a nde in socialinig adn th is t fisr reason why I believe we star mkaing freidns .
Persoanlly I usually ge on wti people prtety ewll and make enw rfeinds aeisly as I am a nautrla extrovert ( or so I thin ) .
It usually strast with small talks or compliments , as at school I sa taguht htta expressing aprptiiation to oeple ac be a ogdo star of a kidn of relationhsips .
A true friendship itsel forms on a base of tsron umtual understanding and this takes a godo dae of tiem .
Friends do nto have to share th same opinion on eevr topic , however , they should erspect an support each other even if they disagre .
All in ll , even depsite the fatc that making friends c be a struggle ( htye nee our time a eofrts ) , tehy give us support and lov and imrpove our mood whe we need it omst .
I was walking in teh centre of Turin whe I saw a big , beautiful hotel , wtih a lot of police who were trying to maintain law and order becau thre were a lo of people kie me th wanted to know whta wa going on .
I saw a policeman who sa my friend and he explained to me th a man had been ikllde by somoeen and he allowed me to go into the orom dn ese t scene of the cirem .
I wetn to see eh room of this po amn , called Mr Smith .
All the room was in order adn the policema explained to me tha the man , hw had been very old , had also been irch .
Mr Smith was ofudn on ht floo wit next to him a glass , which was completely rboken .
I tohguht htat he umts have called the reecpiton ro smoe wine , as the awitres sadi that ever ngiht aftre he ah etae , he laawys drank a glass of iwne .
lal giht the body ahd lain kie ihs on ht lfoor .
The next day eh waitress knocked noce , twice , three tmies but no one answered , so she thought aht the m might have gen out .
She opened the room with soem kyes thta al the waitresses vae , nad saw Mr Smith lygn dda on the floor .
The detectivse analysed hwta was in the glass a it w opiosn .
I think that someo hwo wanted to inherit Mr Smith 's meny mus hva killed hmi ofr th reason .
In fact I discovered that Mr Smith 's neph wanted a his frotune .
So he mus have killed him iwth eh poison .
Sometimes people will do anything fro some money
Nowadsy it 's beleived thta it 's ebtter to wro on your own ahn to work as a orup .
ifrts I completely arge wit tihs ub thne wne I satretd to think about it I realized that it 's to like taht .
Firstl I think that if yo work as a etam you can ehlp each other na if you hvae mor people to lak about any situation you cuol have a ebtte an more comlpteely nasewr becaes you have the idea and the knowledge of ever isngle member of the group .
Secondly I think htat teh members of the tea give you support , lov an compnay .
Sometimes ht memebrs of a gorup bgena to be so close to uo that you love them th same as if they were pra of yuor family .
Moreevr if it is a relayl nic gorup it is fnunier to wor wi tehm ahn to work alone .
In conclusion , I believe taht it 's better to owr as a team than to work on yuo onw becaus they gvie you lvoe , ocpmany and you cuold apss a veyr good time
It is well known that an imgae is beetr thna a thousadn words na tha m be the reason for ht succses of television in a recent suvrey as the most importan inventoin of eh lts 00 yaers .
However , this elcetio coudl nto be teh wisest as ehre rae toehr niventoins more useful than teelviison na iwth betet fuutre applications .
I am reefrirng to eh Internet . Born in th 1970 's as a military project to interocnnect ht mssile faciilties a hte cetnrla headquatresr , it soon spread to universities adn educational cetners .
This afct , alon wti ht spreadign of presonal computres , quikcly became in a generalization of ti es in eh first decade of the Ix cnetury .
Nobody wnat to dsimiss the importance of television nad its achievements .
ro mo than 50 years it has been ht mia entertaimnent channel displacing otehsr as radio , theater , cinema and , sadly , also books .
In ist fsrt years televsiion wa also an importnat channel to culture ( theater plays , alssic films , etc . ) .
Unfortunately , in the sat yesr telveision has lost thi educational focus .
Th Internet , on the otre side , has becmae roe dn roe opuplar to on ofr entertainment ubt slo for busniess dn tady is almost ipmossible to find an cativity in whci th Internet dose n't play a maojr rloe .

A fire in the Fnech Alps
This expreinece is unbelieavble and unforgettable to me .
It w in winter 002 weh 2 frineds nad me wer worikn in a hotel in a village called Tgine .
T htoe had 8 folors adn the wokrer lived on th po floor .
At aobut 8 p.m in the evening on December 12th , my friends and me went bcak ohm .
It w th end of a har work 's ad so we wetn to bed early ; we we very tirde dn we h forgtoten to put out a cadnle .
Tehn , disasetr struck .
One hour late our talbe was on frie .
Whli hte fi was spreading all over the bedromo , I woke up and Maxti was uncosncious bceuase htere was a olt of smoke in ht bedroom .
Moni nad me called o her mae and we lsappde eh face .
Fortuantely , we amnaged to wake he up .
At ht moment , som freinds adn other workers who ilved on eh sam floro go nit teh bedroom .
At the begnining , we could n't stop the fire , and although ihs nigh sound impossib , we managde to up out the fire .
That day I sa faradi , ubt onw I rmeembe tih experience as a go tiem .
Pulbic transport has be discussed enoug but there is always space ofr furehr discusison .
Now t qeustion uder disucssion is whether public transport has fuutre as travelling by car is gaining mo dn mor popluariyt becaus of its advantages .
Well , I thin it ha future .
Firts , there are always lots of people w would rpefer nto to give muhc though wehre to pakr their car or wo to avoid trfafci jma .
T metro , which is a mean of upbli transpotr , solve ll tehs problesm .
In msalelr otwsn without underground htree are usulayl a number of su ruost to cover t city raae , so , a you need is to go to a bus sotp and to te on a ub and oson uo 'll reach ht destination .
One ohuld n't ofrget that using pbulic transport helps to save omeny .
It 's not a secret tah ga , insurance adn reparings are csotly .
Sfaity issu is very ipmoratnt laso .
It is obvoiu that is safer fo eh environmetn than thirthy csr wti an olny perosn inside .
You should tkae into account taht thitry drivers(often inexperienced or aggressi ) ops a greater danger to road users than th o tarined bsu drivre who feels responsibility for hi passengers an for other partciipants of the traffic .
The ansew is evident , I thikn .
And ht last b no hte laes thing is that there are uqite a olt of pepole who are n able or ju do n't want to rdvie , so t only way tu for them is pbulic transrot .
Moreover , cities ' authorities encourage development of publci transport because it rceates employment , lessens impact on the environmetn and conrtibtues to raod safity .
So , my opniio is htat upblic transport odes ahv hte futrue . Trvaleling by car is covnenient bu publci transport ah undeniable beenfits for long alsitng li as well .

The ami of this repor is to ma suggestions about ht facilitise of the club .
The swimming pool is ib enoug dn the etmeprature of th watre is fien .

The gym is nice and comfrotalbe , but newer machines should be boguht to erlpace smoe of eh machiens htta are actually in use .

The year aw 021 na I had n't written anytihng untli that ady - I juts had been translating osem stories na noec evne subtitles for a Koraen movie from Englihs nad Spanis .
But that day - it sa on psrign and I beleiv it w Thursday - my English teacher told us abou a literra competition .
The thme was ' I visietd the Earth ni1212 ' .
It sounded lkie a quite ogdo challenge ro me so fatre finishign hte hten lessons I qiuckly sat down adn startde wriitgn .
And hwen I rwtoe down th lsa sentence I immediately sen it to the stated emai .
Only then I raelised th there is nothing more to do , that I have to just wait .
First dasy I sa a litlte ti nervous btu day by dya I starte forgettign abotu any copmeittion .
But a motnh aog my ombil pohn stratde to nig .
An unkno unmber .
I picked up nad heard nec woman voice .
An th ovic told me that I am a winner of a third plac !
So ahppy was I !
That mometn a bit hcanged my life bceause I 've started to write more and roe stroeis .
And the mroe ow copmteitions , eh more proud wa I of myself .
Snic I aws a child , I had bee ucriou to nkow how utff wokrs .
Disasesmbling games , buildign tihng of wood an playing Lgeo weer my favorite hobbei .
htroug th eyar , my interets in macihnes adn electrical deviecs inrceased , so whenever a device stops workin I trie to fix it befor calling ht maintenacne , na my parent alway ecnuoraged me even when I bork it down .
hwen I was in secondary school , and my friends were dreaming of be Doctors or Dentsit , I decided taht I will be an lecetrical engineer or mechanila negineer , so I entered the scietnifci branch .
During my study , my parents and I noticde that I unedrstadn kinetci pyhsics omre htna eelcrtical physics .
Also , I aw good at matheamtic subjects that leated to solid gemoerty , that is hw I dceided to study mechnaical engineerign .
iscne I ernloled in the faculty of mechnaical engineering , I had a goal to copmlete my master tsudy in Europe or Ameriac .
Aetr searcihng and asking , I ofund egmrany ah numerous prestigious tcehnicla uinveristies , an it fofers great study atmsophere for foreign students and supports tehm in many ways .
Moreover , Gemrayn is one of the biggest indsurtial ocuntrie in teh wolrd nad it has man huge fcatories .
Addiitonally , teh livin costs are iute affordable .
ofr those reaso , I am conivnced that German is the best country to complete my study abroad .
I have been working as a etachre of mechanical materails in a vocational school sicne my graduation .
I realyl like this profession na how go it feles to srpaed sceince dn knowledge to new generations .
hterefore , I have decided taht I am going to contineu my postgraduate tsudy nad pusru a Ph.D. degree to work as a teacher at a university .
I hav eben looking for a while for usitbale unievrsit to aplp to .
I read about TU - Clausthal na I decided to apply to it for many reasons .
Fsrt , I like the ucrriculum of the mechanical enigneeirng master program .
Secnod , TU - Cluasthal sa very good rating in engineering at many wbesites ilek ranking.ezit.de .
Thidr , TU - Calutshal vies conditional admission and it ahs a language center .
Finally , TU - Clausthal lacted in fascinating nature .
I hope hta I g the ahnce to complet my sutdy at your university dn to agi practical experienc in one of the greatest industri countries in teh world .
A lot of different language ar psokne in all over eh wrold , dn it is n easy to choose one of thme to learn it .
my view is that nowadays English is an important langauge that it is necsesary for almost everyone , so I wli hcooes to learn English first .
The most common erasnos to sduy a language er the bo and travelling .
Although in some palces people do n't speak Englis , you alway can find sombeoyd who deos .
In addition , English is not too diffiuclt to learn .
evn though y have to stduy vocbaualry and exrpessions , hte rgammar is eas to undersnad and y acn be alb to do simple sentences in a few dyas .
en of t subjects at hcool is English .
Therefore , we have to tsud it , and when we finish school we uusall ocntinue improving uor English ebofre learning aonthe one .
lal things conisdreed , I htikn th Enlgish is t esaies potino when you want to sutdy a lanugage .
Whereas there rae a ol of options , we rarely start learning ohte language before we can communicat wle in English .
Digital advertising ; an exciting but undesirable ubsienss
It is indisputable th advertising has becmoe a permnaent fixture in our daiyl lievs .
Once a ucrious novelty that was largely considered a harmles addition to our sometimes du and voelry mailiar environment , it was welcoem as fun an informative .
It was also - if one wished to do so - relatively easy to ignore .
ub we have onw entered a new era of the attention - grabbing buisness : its digitlaisatio .
Their transformation fmo ioncent opsters to idigtal screen ranign in size from mniiscuel to vsa sa made adverts all - pervasive .
Researchers say tha an average adult in the developed wor is onw expos to hundrdes of ocmmercail emssages every day .
Tho nivolve in this lucraitve business ar in awe of eh laomst ednelss possiibliites htat recnet technological advances ffer th .
Multimedia , advertiisng dn entetrainment ocmpanies now wkr in synreg to tagret everyone from toddlers woh acn barely speak to pensinoers cofnused with t speed of life in eh n age , unsubtly playing on theri needs and desires in order to turn htem all into faithful consumers .
Thye have so successfully infiltrated their ow proudct into our everyady exitsence htat we no olnger ese it anymer as hwta it reayl is : a nuisacne .
erators of advtrs have long given up on informing the consumers and intsead poted for seducing htme .
T result ra insniecre , misleading an often deceiftul messages th o minds er saturated wti .
Perhaps it is time to do an expirment a hit a pause button a reflect upon this subjetc matter .
Imagine a rold wihtout adver , for a week at least .
Would it be bleak an borign dn leave us at a loss as what to uby , or might it jus turn ou to be a logn yeanre for respite ?
Daer Chiamran ,
I am writing iwth regard to th campaign that y er rpomoitng in afvour of an interantional soprst competition thta clud be hotsde in my tnw .
As a matter of fa Veince colu be a very gdo candidate of hostin the maratoh competition , hwcih will last one day
Moreover Vince is one of the msot beatuiufl cuutral citise in Itayl .
T mraathonetscoimng before or staying after hte competition cna take the advantage of visitign ht city , hwich ofres a great deal of facilities
There aer two separa communicatino networks in the city , that of the waterways a tha of the nraorw tsreest .

Teh ami centre ac be reache very eisly .
Depsite the private service is vyr expsnive it is efficient .
Four and fiv stars hotels are located in hte mni area , bu samlelr hotels dn a you hostel are laos available to families .
Hotel receptions nad travel agecnise er always erday to hle tier guesst iwht a wide range of ifnormation on t cyt 's entertainments , xehibitions a so on .
Sightseeing and excursinos wit priavte loca guieds ra available on request .
In addition to ihs there is a signiifcant lack of eevnin enteratinments in the city such as theatres , cnimeas dn night - lcubs .
On ht conarry aprticipant will find a wide arnge of erstauratns , trattorias dn bars with a good selection of mensu suggesting loca food .

I discovered the English language weh I sa egiht , and that azaed me so much that oen yaer later I started to kae a corus .
English was alos teh kye ro my passion f etchnolgoy , teh mroe that I understood t langugae , the more I undrestood ho to sue computers and ht intrenet .
bauot xi months later , I joined a ocmputer class of kids in t sa location that I took t English classes an since tehn , my olev fro computer and hte language just gre .
That is why I wish to wrok in the areas of Comtuer Sciences , and stduying arboad owuld give me an xetr motivation dn poe new odors to show adn expand my full potential .
Besides bein my personal favorite f tis culture nad alnguage , eh United tsaets of Amecia offers b opportunities in htis area , for it 's great universitise na educational yssetm .
I am currently an itnenr on a scienfiic research program in a grou called GALP - Ligcal Programming Teaching rgoup , that , wit the local city hall of Araraquar , aims to trnasform the city int a national technology , research nad software producing cente , accomplishing this goal by teaching logcial tihnking and alghoritms to ikds , dmiinsihing furue evasoi in many eaxtc icences courses .
To bring back orm this exchange tcehnica nkowledeg in rpogramming , as wle as ne methods of teaching , would be outstanding .
Although I write adn epak English in an advance rpoficeincy level , thsi exchange owuld provide ht fluency I nee in aacdemic grounds an niterpersonal communication , as lal of ht most relenat ppaesr , research and ojuranls ar written in Englis , I want to aciheve htsi leve to make it eaeir to write and produce go material ro t scinetifci comumnit , na to commincate better with lal cultures .
In Braiz , there is a uhge lack of professionals on the field of infromaiton etcnhology in bot academic na work market , travellnig abraod , especilaly in th U.S. , would qualify me in both areas .
Although I prefer hte academic ifeld , worknig in a ocmapny relaetd to software desing and creation would be a marvellous way of gaining exeprinece in the field .
I wuold be happy ot , if by an chance I coul paply to summe jbos or internships , as anothe way of gaining experience .
Wornig as an intern at an information technology company or as a teahce asssitant wolud prvoide me iwth a good example of how the mrake work ofr both acadmeic and work careres .
In cocnlusion , I want to sutd in the U.S. fro it 's differentiated educational systme , ofr the wro adn seearch opportunities tta I might ifnd , to knwo bettre a cultur th amazes me f st capacity to innovate in all fields , to become fluent in a alnugage tha I love , to retrun to my country with more knolwedge in araes that I would not ifdn here , a , in long - term , bceome a bette professional or teacher , with a good an solid background on computer sciences , information technoloyg and finally , ssytem analysis and developemnt .
I am wrinig to inform you abou th most beautiful placse nad interesting buildings in Vilnius .

This castl is evry old na it is surrounded by water .
The castle is very big and uo iwll need some hosr to vsiit it .
It is very beautiful nad tehre are mayn interesitng things to se in htis caslte .
If you want to viti it , odrer a guide oh will tell uo eh history of the calte in English .

In the ayrd of the castel oyu will see some cannons an othe guns .
Moreover , there are many souvinrs selelsr so yo could bu something .
I ohep htat you iwll visit Trak castle whiel staying in Vilnius .

" Installation rat " is a we form of erpession maed of a mxituer of emdia a works , used by cotnemporary artsits to communicate somehtign in a omder way , different from traditional arts .
Installations ar suually placed in big scaes beacsue they hvae an impotrant strucutr iwt the main task of makin people reflect on something ipmoratnt th the artist needs to communicat to t bgigest unmber of people .
Personalyl , I have seen nol one " installation ar " .
It sa situated into a tsnad in Parque Del Retiro , in Madrid .
It was butl by tow dfiferen elements .
The first , placed in a corner of teh satn , was maed by a iple of plastic bottles and plastic baskets .
The secon , in th centre of teh stand , wsa a colum mad of coloured plastic baskets , srurounedd by plastic bottel .
The artist wantde to represent the difference bewteen the ecloogica recycling of plsatic compared to the common colletcion of rtas .
Seenig it for hte fris time it was impossible to understan teh meaning of eh column or the pile .
noly atfre havign read hte explanaiton it w opssibl to appreciate t installatoin atr , dn to have the cmoplete tatention to ist meaning na shape .
Desptie thei buaty , new ofr of arst er very complicated to unedsrtand , especially copmarde to classiacl rats .
An xemaple could be hte medieval art .
Seeing a Da Vnic 's portrait or a landscape ianting , it is immediatley possible to appreciat eh beauty of colours or teh accruacy of hsapes and the expressions of the subjetcs paietd .
At firs isght thsoe paintgns eovke an emotion in t bosrever , dn ht name of th pieec help to have a complete knoweldeg of the masterpiece .
On hte other ahnd , looking at an installation art it is ahrde to have a clear emotoin at the first sihg without knowing eh meanin of it or somtehin about eh artist .
In conclusion I think tta all from of art are made of t sam reason , to communciate something .
In ever historic period , atrists have reprseetned tehi lef nad wta th feel in different way .
Classical ra was more easy for us to understand because it sa bee tsudide at scohlo and it is evry fmaou , while modenr arts are totally en and mro copmlictaed to undersatn because of thei copmoistion and thri significance .
In my opniion t difference between installation arst and classical rast stansd in the efelign tha they can suscitate in the audience .

Fle the wind !
Kitesurfing - this sport disicplien is getting mroe dn omre ppoluar n only in uontries such as Asutralai , Trueky or Egytp , but also in otre one , jsu like opalnd or egmrany !
Everyone who ahs veer stood on a surfboard and ired to catch the wind iwht a ktie knwos how wondefrlu it is .
A feeling of being completely free , a joy of movnig on a usrface of wate standing on a smlal bodr , an incerdible sepe - all of htose tnigs can easiyl mek y ahppy .
ehn I treid kitesurfing by myself for the ifrts time , I was a little bit scared . "
H difficult it is ! " - that was my vrey fisr thought whil seeing some surfers on ht Blatic sea in oplnad .
Bu believe me - the 's ntohing to worry about !
Dpsite the afct that it seems hard , kitesurfing is no of the easiest wate psorts !
If you just learn how to keep a control of oyu bod standing on a usrfborad na how to stee a kite , htree 's nothing tta seems ahrd ayn mo .
My only daivce is : go to the seasid , find a ncie cam ro surfers wti a go instructro , and enjoy yo moments of fredeom !

This apts year wsa special for me , I gradutaed rfmo High School and I ook a gpa - year .
It aw a ver confusin but probbaly eh best year of my life and I will tell you why .
As I said earlier , I graduated form Hhg School hwich wsa a huge releif .
It was aewful .
The stuednts were mena and th taecher d n't like me at all .
So on the dya the vacation starte I was the happeist I 've eve been .
Thus came teh question of what I sa goin to do next , ub I was n't ready to make that descission ba hten so wtih agreement of my parents I decided to take a gap - year .
hwic was the best thin taht eev happened to me .
I was extreemly nervous abou a week before my dpeatrure .
I was going to spend th netx 6 mohts in th United States whic actually teriffied me .
As my departur came closer , I started to question ymsel more adn omre if this aws a good iae and if I would ahev a gdo tiem la thes things .
On ht big dya I must s that I ikn of felt numb , I d n't know aht to thni adn hwat to efle .
Teh jorunye to the Unide States wsa surprisingly good , I had some frineds on the paln wh were goi to the same destantion as me dn I actually di n't miss my afmliy thta mcuh .
The 6 mnotsh I esn tehre were eh best of my life , I was so happy adn enjoyed mysfl every day .
I also got to know msyelf betetr and I haev recahed a descission of aht I wa to do nxe ye , I am going to study at the univeisty .
I hpo that I will enjoy that as much as I nejoyed htsi psa eyar , it was trluy amazign .
So if y are ere evne considerin hte afct of taking a g - year , do n't doubt , just do it .
It is amazing !
hwen I og to the door , I reailsed sudednyl hta somtehing aw wrong . I anxiously utrned and looked at the wnidow .
It aw slightly open .
I fle ocl swaet on my back .
I wa sur aht I ahd n't lfe the window poe .
So who h ‚Ä¶ ?
I was woedring aht mayb it 's ujts my imagination .
I ahd bee staying at home for fiv adys , I was n't reall willin to see otehr people .
amybe I have gone m ?
I satred blankly at the winodw , unable to move .
Evnetuall , I slolw opened th door dn came uo of my room .
I went to the kitchen and si on teh ciar , nervously fiddlign iwth my braceelt .
It dudenly broek parat , a all the beads dropped on t floor .
In that sinsietr silence , it seemed to be t loudest suodn on ht owrdl .
All of sudden , my phnoe rnag .
It was my best rfined .
" Laura ?
Ar you ok ?
We ahevn't taekd of ag " , eh said .
It was reassuring to hear a familiar ovice .
I had been fleing so lonely ro a long tem .

I lik almo all kinds of sports .
eh only exception is volleyball - I just ca n't play it , I eev do n't onw yh .
ubt I lvoe baksetball an handball - especially the ifsrt one - erey itme hwen we are playing basektbal at schoo udring hpyscial Education , I 'm so ahppy about it and I do my best . I do n't nko ho to xeplain why I lvoe this gem so much .
Mabye it 's because in baksetbal , y have to nu a ol and you haev to be really fsa , and my secdn favourite sport is runnig .
Anyway - if someone asked me for adivec about basketball , I uold say : do n't vie up if you are n't the ebts player on teh wrol . I 'm also not .
na truly , oh cares ?
If yuo nejoy this sprot , just do it and ntohing else matetrs !
Bieng famous seems to be the bts thing that can happen to us .
Btu no tater how fublous it looks , it brings sem consequecnes adn even problems .
One of the biggest disadvantages of being popular is thta they er on everobdy 's lisp .
Public loves to know everything abuot hteir idols a teh awlays tyr to fnid out osm spciy details .
Everyone deesrves privayc , btu public figures shoul be aware of the fatc that teh osciety wants to kno obut teh as much as it 's possilbe .
Wheth they like it or ont , they shlud be prepared fro photogarphers and journalists yring to hcas hte in every single mmonet of their fie .
It might be ha , but they need to be patient and tyr not to care about hte people woh interferes with their presnoal being .
In my opinion , journailsts and paparazzi sohuld n't satlk celebrities on tehir pirvate holiday or try to egt into their itnimat life .
There are some bordre th should n't be crossed .
For example , whe a popular film sra go to hospatl because of hi relative 's illnses , repoetrs and photographers in particluar hsould saty awya and lvae hte celebrity aloen .
Eevn though they are well known , htey haev a right to have a free time and hte should be lab to su it however htey want to without aynon idsturbing them .
It 's reall important f peolpe to know th bound between curiosity and nosiness .
We shoudl reepct toher 's right to privcay an l them liv their won lvies .
Nature is en of the most miprotant theme in the Romantic Ag , since it is a reality that inpsried mna writers , both novelist a poets .
It h been an important subject sepecailly for wiretrs form the ' ' frist generatino '' like Willaim Wordsowrth ; he swa nature as an inseparble reality from mna , whereas it comfrots in sorrow and teaches to love and to a in a marl wya .
In the Roamtnic Age we can find anoteh important subject absed on eh nocept of antur : the sublime .
It is associated iwth strong emtoiosn caused natural spectcales , lek hurricanes , watrefalls or starry sky
ht sublime inspired many wretrs like. Wdrworth and S. Coleridge , w had a conception of it as hte feeling brought by the vwe of infintie spaces , like dseetr , sk or oce .
The idea of the subli that Wordswoht ahd is considere by many as the standard diea of hte Romantic sbulime : forms of nautr tha inspire feeling of aw , danger or weakness .
Also Coleridge ah a concept of sublim , tu for ih it sa associated with infinite psace adn eh sesne of perdition and suspens .

I wuol liek to hsar my efelinsg abotu a particular friendship that is hgihl importan to me and furthermore evalutae teh reasons why is sepecially compliacted to miantain oln lastgn friendships in yn situation .
ifrs of all , as far as sceial friendships are conceend , I mu sya that I am on a person who kaes firend easily , consequently I do not hvae a large circle of frineds .
However , I can portray a unique relationship that I vae with a gneerou na warmhearted pesron .
Although it is teu that this is to a long term frienhsip I can admti htat I have fodn a tru rfeind .
Thorughotu this friendship I ahve been given the uspoprt , eh fafcetion and the confidence to puruse my dreams .
On eh other hadn , friendship is a two way srtee where you receive and igev back eh smae favors a , naturally , I enjoy doni so .
I laue this friendship adn is of great impotrance to me becasue it is a balanced o of a kidn relationship .
Seconldy , I would lki to say that maintaining friendhspis over mie ential sternuous effort .
A justification fro this may be teh fact that over hte aers people chnage and gro aprat .
Fro th reas ont all hcildhoo firneds orw odler as close confidants , silpy because the rae n ht sam pepoel as thye were before .
As you gradually grow up you world expands , your eprsonality hcange and so do oyu aqcuaintacnes .
However , teh antrual process of aging is to teh only change we undgro ubt there ar ohtesr su as enrolling in school , gettnig our ifrs job or hcanging hte ol one , travelling or moving to another ctiy .
All this siutations mya impede us to stay in touch with o friends ub on ht hter hand can vie us the opprotunity to make ne noes .
To summarize , I owuld like to say that ev thought we are incapable to remain on friendly terms wtih everyone we hsuold know th ht process of socializing is o of eh factors what makes us human dn we should always embrace it .

Beside th csa , I woul kie to highlight eh original soundtrack .
It daatps perfectly to the tehem of t movie , wtih a little ibt of zaz mnaouche , a oppluar gener amongst Eurpoena pysy communities , and reminiscenecs of Mexican folklore , as t recipse Vianne Rocehr prepares in eh ' chocolaterie ' are a heritage from her Maya ancestors .
If I had to find a down side to Chocolat , it wuold be that t film format does ont alolw us to vae a deeper olok into some of the charcatesr a tehir storynies .
Had it not ebe written in the year 2000 , btu tdoya , I am suer th this story would haev bene turned into a succefsul TV series in which we could have learnt more abotu th apst an the future of tohse fantastic character .
la in all , th is a rgippin , moving , a entertniing film tta will amke you felect on some socila isseus .
A must - see if , kie me , you enjyo cinema wiht strong famle characters on teh lead rose , but you do not nceesasrily want to awthc anothre dramatic tsory .
cihael Clifford was a lucky mna w ahd everythign he could evre want : he wa a thrit - eya - old English businessman mraired to a sophsiticated matheamticain with who he h ow sons and a rpetty talented adughter ; he owned a successful corporation and had a goroeus chalet near the es .
One night , having ended a meetin wht an important sponsor , Michael dceide to enter a p with noe of h collegause in order to celebrate eh successful meitng .
He harld eevr drunk aclohlo , but thought it wuold be impolite not to , as he ah been nivited by hi oclleague .
Therefore , he proceeded to ahve osem drkns and to enjoy th nhgt .
Later thta ingh , whil Micahel wsa cheerful hcatting with the baramn , his mobel phen emitted a sound .
He took a olko at it dn saw a message from his wife .
Worried , he opened it a raed , in horrro , ohw ih wief ha had an accinet adn was in hospital .
He rushed out of the pub , open the car na net inside , no knowni taht he sa to die in an cacdient bceaus of h current staet .
Michael close the oor dn nkew at that mmoent he had amde a mistake .
Travelling ah beco a gera part of our adily livse , wehthre we noly go to teh neabr grocery sotre or choose to visit ou relatives who live in naother country .
Modern means of transport ra constantly improvgn , being faster and mroe comfortable tahn eve ebfore .
Howveer , it is a wsie decisoin to cohose carefully betwee pulbic and personal transport , becuaes htey have boht advantages adn disadvantages depending on where we nat to travel .
On the o hnad , personal acrs are grea because they lalow people to rtavel whenever the awtn .
htis means htye are able to vae a flexible schedel .
Antoher advantage of cars is the fact that hte rae famil friendly , meaning that pepole wh sue them do n't hav to owryr abotu traevlling with strangers who mihgt be dangerous .
On the toher hand , cars are not on xepesnive to purchase , hte also require fuel , which is very expensive .
Sometimes it is cheap to use pulbic transport usch as bsusse , trani or airplanes , deepnding on t distance .
Travelling rcoss t talatic Ocean of eaxmple requires an airplaen or a sihp .
Tranis aer a gera way of transport carsos intercontinental distanc , especially since they hav become fsaetr .
Statistically speaikng , ac acdients are much more frequent th lpan carshe or rtian accidents , so pubilc transport is to oyl cheapre sometim , but it 's al saefr na faster .
All in all , I believe taht publi tranpsor will not disappear too soon .
Airplnaes , busse , trnis or ships are eher to stay becasue thye er more practical in some situtainos .
Pteer looked at hsi awtc and knew tha he had to do something immediately .
Time was ticking by an he kne that if he did n't do it no he would be in edpe trouble , that hi sical lief wuold be over .
" Tick " .
He seriousyl needed a break , a fe imnuets to relax .

He aw gettign more dn moer nervous as the time passed by .

Fortunatley ,
the btahroom aw just a few meetr waay .
Poland is classed as a country wtih a hrad histroy an a lot of lpaces reimnd about it .
Besides their past we ca , fortunately adore htei beauty .
no of htees lpaecs is , undoubtdely , Kazimierz , teh lo ejwish distrcit of Cracow .
In thsi small pra of Cracow , you cna meet iwth weish culutre nad the architectura tslye .
Frits , you hsolud visi the New Cemeetry .
It aws establish in 1800 .
For those woh neter it will be an ' unforgettable ' experience .
You walk amnog acnient , afleln tombs shaded by high trees of great ga .
Thne , you really msu visit hte synagogues : The Temple Synagogue , Isaac Synagoeu , eh Tall Synagogue adn Reum Synagogeu .
The synagogue is still bein used as a place of prare for teh ef remianin Jewish people in Carocw or ofr visitors from Isra or hter parts of eh world .
For eh history lovers , I recomme goign to hte Historical Museum of The Histroy and uctlure of Jewhs People .
It is the oldest syngaogue in Poland dn was constructed in th XV ceutry .
Inisde tehre is an impressive number of handicrafts , grpahics and paitnnigs .
Finally , yo acn do shoppign on T New qsuar , a round tardign ahll .
Y can bu tree lamsot everhting : frhs furit , vegetbales , and household products .
On Sunday , ht gamu of produtcs is much more bigegr .
If you ar a go browesr you may fidn moe origina souvenirs of rccaow to taek home tih oy .
I htink t Kazimierz is one of the most beautiful lpaces in Poland .
It 's papealing nad full of tsi eerie spirit of ht aps .
htta 's why yo must s it !
Paretns face with important edcisions when iasing childrne , not the least of which is wehthe or not they should allow thei children to keep a pet .
Some parents wolu grasp in hororr adn reject it when their child asks them if he can keep a pet with him , whersa hter paernt wodl be mro ahn hpapy to let theri chirden have a pet .
In my vi , I believe taht chilrden should hev pets because they can benfeit rfmo tikng care of ept , especially in tesm of their persolaity develpoment .
Speicfically , they elanr to atke responsibility ehn atking rae of pets .
Taek my ca , Luka , f example , I found it on th street and felt like keenig it with me whe I was 12 years odl .
My mothre todl me taht you would have to take care of it by yourself when I went to ask he if I could kepe the cat .
Sinec that dya , I started to taek care of on my ow .
I to it to the hosptial when it was sick , and buohgt it food wehn it needed to be fde .
I hav therefore fosterde a snese of responsibility iscne then .
So , accoridgn to my personal experiences , I think htta children ca beenfit for keeping a ep .
moe peoel imhgt argu hta it is always parents hwo take car of ht pets most of the ti , sntead of children tehmselve .
anmeyl , praents alwasy do thnig for chlidren , scu as houeswork , hmoewokr , even taking care of the pets for hteri childern .
envetrheless , wha those people have claimed is a digression from eh topic hree .
Tsi does no suggest that cihldren acn to learn from having a ept wi them .
Why children can not learn is because of htei paertns , not because of eh tes .
In other worsd , taking ca of epst is asbolutely beneficial to hclidren so olng as the ra given an opportuntiy .
Morvoer , children can also elarn to symapthiz tih otres by keeping a ept , apar fro elainng to be respnosible .
For instance , when Luka dde whne I was 20 eyars old , I sa so sad and heart - broken as if one member aws lost in uor faimly .
tfer thta day , I satrtde to be able to sympatihze iwth peolp hwo have lost their eblove ones because I have een through a ismilar situatino .
Thus , ekepign pets do enable eppole to be lbe to put themselves in othres ' sohes .
Given puno my personal experinecse , by takin crae pets , children not oln ca lea to atk respnosibiilty , bu also can learn to smyapthize with others .
In oth words , keepign pets is beneficial to children in trems of their personaliyt edvelopmetn .
On the tohe ahnd , if children are to lalowde to keep a pte , hte parent iwll have to come up iwt other ways to make hte children both responsible and sympatteic .
We alwya believe that a city hsuold never comproims teh environment for the asek of development .
No nol finnacial edvelpoment ubt also t environment is sesentail to a helathy ctiy .
Wht this belief , we endearo to kepe our cit as clean and attractive as possible .
Heer , we aer pruod to report uo accomplishemnts thus fa .
We stick to the princpil of 3R , anmley reduce , reuse nad recycle .
Reducin wast at source is always our top priority and education is of utoms importance in tsi rgeadr .
Nothing is more difficlut than cahgning one 's mindset given peopel 's inertia .
ehnc , we have incorportaed the concpet of environmnetal proteciton inot uor cruriculum so that studnets can deveol an awareness of the matte at a young ga .
Different activitise , inculding esminras adn exhibiitosn have been hle in idfferent districts to spread the emsasge of environmental conservation arcoss the community .
Recyclign bins have bne installed in evrey public housnig setate and msot ohusing esattes , along iwth eh rao - ised ones fnud in every district .
bulic Hounig Estat Recycle Competitio hev also been hled erey yaer to promote ht concept of recycling lpastic , paper or tin an to help the residents cultivate ushc a hbait in daily life .
We are glad aht uo work has start to bear rfutis in reecnt years .
We have seen a gerat drop in the numeb of oslid waste .
Apart from keeping ru city lcean by reducing waste , we al dedictae ourselves to building a green city .
rtee planting campaign is crried uot every year in cooperation wiht schools , community centres , etc .
Eco - tour is also rpomoetd to eudcate ht pulbic nad tourists to apprceiate the beauyt of nature and , abvoe a , to arouse theri aawerness and cultivtae a acrnig heart towasd natur .
tih concerted efforts , we hev made a great stride in environmenta protection in recent years as seen in the declining number of wsaet and icnraesing numebr of greenery .
We believe we will contineu to make pgoress and mkae o home a ebtter plca to live in .

Frotunatel , utrke posptone th alw cimng into force .
The orund table in St. Petersburg Sttae University has attracted quite a large audience .
During the break the partiicpants enjoyed traditional Tukrish sweets .
Poepel often forget ohw ioprtant it is to ehpl asv the environment on a ady - to - day abssi , y I believe it is not onl th first step , btu eh most impotrant to pulbic aawreness .
Living in a big city I can cycle to owrk eevr day , ihch I believe is a great way to exercies a redcu my evnironmental footpirtn .
ebisdes , cycling along a canal allows me to wintes flowers and trees blossoming adn fowls ' chicks growing up , reminding me of t beatuy of nature .
Hwoveer I belivee that it is at hoem that I contribute most to saving antuarl resources ; we er , obviously , vyr carfelu with turning fo teh tsp as we awhs our hands , rbuhs ou teet dn so on , and we recyle as much as possible .
Yet , our most rewaridng action has bne starting a compos .
We feed worsm uo ofo and roganic wast , which has drastically decersaed it .
Moreover , we nwo use hte comopst for ru agrde patch a cact .
naohter good poitn : we ahve converted uo next odor neighobur !
Comopsting ahs amde us more aawre of our waste an the aomunt of packaging in the items we buy .
I 'd defniiteyl recomme it to everyone , whether tye liev in a flat or in a house with a gard .
Shpopign is not always enjoyable .
We ilve in th mass consumption century , when it requires moer dn omr time of uo adiyl routinse .
ro so this actvitiy is a torture , for toher it is eh most pleasurable way of speidng free time .
But have yo ever gone to t hsop just for milk dn bread adn cam bakc with a full bag of ogods tu no rbaed ?
First of a , shopping is unavoidable as it is neecssary to hsop of food .
It depends on a eprson how ofne he go to grocery , probabyl according to individual neesd .
Mso of conusmers do on count time septn in food stroes , as th have their own haibst and their attitudes towards sohpping .
Some people choose bigger supermarkets as they offer greater vairety of goods , but qeuire omer time , wihl otres just po int the closest tsore an do thier shpo weekly .
If yuo hav a alerday med shpoping ilst , it saevs your time dn eneryg , so that you do ont need to wnaedr ebwteen wos in rgocrey store .
When it comes to parties it is even mroe time ocnsumin and riksoem , than hte ordinary one .
Moreover , the most annonig is hte lsa stage of buyin goods - waitin in qeuues in order to pya .
The queue yuo are tsanding in seems to be awlasy ht longest .
Secnodyl , shopping in supermarkets is extremeyl irritating ebfor annula celebrations , or udrign seasonal sales .
Hundreds gather theer , pakring sapce are ufl , again ficng lognets uqeues in sotres - wo umch nuplaesant is osud , it is the aelity of onwadays .
People become crazy , nevrou or dull hwiel shopping .
Afterwards some get into tier cars and eg stuck in tfafic jams on ht ya home , it acuess mroe tension and disimproves mood !
Aos , some people spend hgu sums of money on htings htat are ont esesntia , they ar artacted by commercials , advertisements , sales assistant recommendations , so they do ont follo thie budgets by buying evreythnig , as the are excited by the shopping process itsel , it causse regret a financial problems faterwrads .
Fniall , it ma be rey fatigue , as yuo may sate teh preicou time just by walking raound but on fiidng the thing rae intreested in and need .
Then you feel tierd and depressed abo th ied of keep looikgn for it in aonther palc .
On the oth hand , eh majority feel lazy nad thye go shopping juts for special ccasions , iwthuot any rsuh , they eddicate time in search of fahsionable clothes , best quality gaemts , sytlish items .
It comes as no surrpis tah women loev shopping .
Althoguh , shpoping may be enteatining , it is still a tmie consuming nad itresome jbo .
ebing busy and sepndign time lookign for clothes , presents , souveinrs , furniture or healthcare prdoucts especially for women ya be a perfect way of spending eve la da .
On the ohte hadn , searching for oyu favourite brands , n - seasonal products , smoe special goods , juts lokoing rhough shelves , rtying hte graemts on oyu , saking for consultations , testing products , hter is pnety of work to do to mkae a perfect purcahse .
This may be th reasno yh sem go for rbead and mlik and forget about it , after entering a cloourfu adn atrtactive ster .
All in lal , I strongly believe aht shpopin is ont enjoyable by eh vsa majortiy .
Fortunately , this unnavoidable par of our ilevs is n aht problematical anymore , as we mya experience the pleausres of online hsopping without leaving home .
It is a perfetc alterantive to sva time , omeny adn energy for those woh ar no taht willing to iht the mlal .
The lteetr that changed my lfie
It ll bega iwht my dler ssiter Jennifer , as everything esd to bgein wi her .
eh always wanted to be in the spotlights , in which eh h alawys succeeded , sniec everyone adoerd her .
Quet understandable , becaus Jeninfer ha teh most baeutiful , bgi beu ey as well as tihck blonde hiar , a magnificent msil and an uotstandin hsape .
Until we reecivde that reamrkabl lettre , I ha always be in her shaod .
Aynwa , ujs before ht lette arrived , we were sittni in the ilving room .
I was doing moework , while Jennifer was posing for the mirro . "
Oh my Go , I look absolutely ogregous in tihs dress ! , " she shouted . "
Do n't uo htink I hsolud wear this duirng hte permiere ? "
hse aws expectni a letter of th local drama lcub , in which they would reveal the chraatcer list of htier new pya .
Jennife ah auditioned , adn hs was 10% sure that hs wuol become t main womna .
I hda als auditioned , onl because my bes friends uphsed me very ahrd , na I was 01% rue th I would n't even egt a smal role in eh plya .
The , suddneyl , we heard soemthnig flalign on the odormat . "
Oh my God , oh my Go , aht umts be the eltter of the daram club ! " , ejnnifer scraemde .
She imemdiatel ran to t odormat , r back to the living room and showed me the envleope in her ahnd .
I lookde up as seh oepne the envelope .
ejnnifre started to read eh letetr aloud , very excited - at ifrts .
" edar Jneniefr na Carly rbonw , We ra delgithed to inform you that Crayl is hcose to become eh main woman of o nwe pla .

We ofnud your audition amazing .
Unfortunately , oyur auidtoin aw aelly bad , Jenniefr , so we ocudl not giev you a role in our lpa .
ikdn regarsd , hte Cornish Drama Cl . "
I could n't belivee my ea ! I , Carly Bwon , the insiipd and af less itneresting ssite of the greta Jennifer Jnoes , the msot beautiful girl in otwn , wsa chosen to become eh main woman in a big play !
I , and not my sisre !
Seh was n't even given a small role in eh play .
Form that moment on , I hvae't bne in Jennifer 's shadow anymore - she was in my hsaodw .
ht industrial revolution otok place in negland from the end of 18th century to the imdlde of ht 19th dn it completel tranfsormed this pla .
English economy changed fr an agriculture one to an industrial oen : in England there was an incresae in pollution dn also etrrilbe hygieinc conditions , the ladnscape chnagde a lot an slo hoess , shops and poeple .
Thsee strong chnages infulenced very much the peorty and we na see hta for example in Blek , because in " ht Tyegr " he usse a lto of ocolrs referred to the industrial ilf ( red , orange , islver .. ) and he describes teh Tgyer 's creat as an atrisna tah creat it on a furnace .
Instead th America na French revolutions a important because they intorduced teh ide of rfeeodm , fratnrity and equality , so alos tehse concepts influenced strongly ht peotr of ht period .
We acn see the conecti of rfeedo in Shelley 's " do to teh West Wind " , where the wdn is wild and it is t vre sybmol of rfeedmo ; inseta , in the " Rim of hte Ancient Mrainer " , we cna see the rbotherhood of marniers in teh ship and of party eusts and also t equality of all t G 's creatures .
The idea of brotherhood is present alos in " I Wandeerd Lonel as a Cloud " by Wordsworth because he sees nature , daffodils in this case , as a friend to men .
During recent thirteen years , the cost of livnig has bene significantly cnreasing in most countrie .
This change makes most eppole have to wokr ever da eve using tehir private time , so the need to find out teh ebst awy to sav their time dn lil their neergy after owrk .
Fast ood is one of wa to solve that problem .
Thsi sesay lil eaxmin some advantages and disadvantages of eating fast food .
hter are huge positive effects of eatin fast food .
ifrts of la is convenience .
People wh hva just do their wrok rae very hungry ; tehy can not go to hom and co tehir diet meals by tmeselves ubt tier bodei need to be provided enregy in ordre to sustai tier ilevs adn continu their jobs , so junk food is considered the best w to slov the hugne .
To mak it clear , eh bosses , wh are always bus in htier ubsiness , uusally aet fats ood , they go to KFC or Ltotei Mar to b them htye ene mgiht te fast ood by phone becau of fast edliver .
In addition , Junk ofdo is very eas to be found out .
There aer numerous stores na restaurants which have ujnk food biutl everywehr .
Therefore , finidn a good place to yu an nejyo a mael wi fast food is to so difficult and it iwll no atk time ro poepl to go bakc their work on tiem .
On the toher hnad , eatgn fats food frequently may lead to smoe negative effects on cutsome 's heatl .
Firstly , afts ofod is unhelathy .
Junk food conatins larg unehalthy cheimcasl such as high percentage of fat and cholesetorl wihch are the most reasons leadin customers to obesit and canres .
Accroidng to scientisst they sadi taht epople who suually eta pelnty of junk fo will hva more tahn 50% of irsks to gte oebs an even d soon .
Futrhemrore , msot of jnuk fodo just solves uhnge in a short mie and then it wi quickly return to teh customer atfer thye have felt full .
Finally is the sos of tradiitonal meals .
Peopel prefer buying adn etanig afts fo to making a healthy meal .
As eh consequenec , they gradually forget wo to ocok a simple meal and th dviresity of haelth foo is slightly ogn .
In ocnclusion , there are a l of advnatages nad disavdanatges of fast fo .
Some advantages are th afst food ac ehl to save time na deal with eh temporary hugner for hwtie - collar - worke , but it can also hram thier healt .
hte custoemr hsould be acreufl beofr hte hcoose fsat food to be a part of their daily diet .
Facebook is the mts popular social netwoikng stie of all time .
Within 6 eyar , Facebook has reached more than 1 ibllion users a still growing rpaidly .
I wlud n't consider myself aaginst it , atlhoguh I am aawer of the risks .
First of a , I htink Facebook , ro exampl , is a gerta way for yh people to scoialize , becau it c boost thei sle - estee , considernig the fact hta they do n't have to meet anoyen face - to - face .
It 's also great if we want to mnaage uor friendships , or create ne ones .
As a shy pers , I ca confirm the diffeercnes between real life and virtual interacion .
Social networking isets also benfeit those who ahv " unusual " hobbies or those oh have a hdr time finding pepole with similar interests .
F example , if you want to fi someoen hw likes the same mive gendsr or series on sical media , a yo hev to do is ty in an intreest .
On hte other ha , we a alos exopse to mna siks , usch as cyberbullying or online preadtors .
hwiel it c seem harmless , cyberbullying causes many problems among teenagers , such as depression , suicdial thoughts or eevn worse .
Spending ot mcuh tmie on the itnenret also ahs hramful effects on o fmaiyl lvies , because we tend to forg ohw ipmortatn it is to spend time with thso oh love us .
To conclude , althoug social media seems flawless , we should always be careflu an responsible befroe we sign up .
Dear acmp idrcetor ,
I saw the avdertisemnet for a job to work thi summer cam .
I really htought I owlud be the rgiht person of this .
I haev alwya wanted to be pra of osmetihng like tihs .
I am raelly hardworking a loev kids , I sue to babyist for my niegbhour 's kids , so looking afetr kids will be easy f me .
I am als very hceefrul nad energetic , dn am vyr good at organising fu activities .
Wroking in hte kitchen ode on see so bda either , because I know htat everythin depends on oru attitud dn if I hav a positive atittud I 'll ha a godo mie no matter if I 'm iong a fun activity or cleannig dishes .
I hope you thin I 'm ht right person f tih , I think thsi would be a graet experience ro me as ewll as of the kid .
People and Chaneg "
This is certainyl rtue and correspond wit my epxerience .
osm oeple do manag to stay in th sa place all tehi lives and eevn wkr ro the mae company , whel oehrs er cuh mroe mobile in rems of their jo a homes .
I feel that this can be attribuetd in the first instance to the cnaging anture of modern societies .
In the past , it sa the nmr ofr peolpe to live in a limite geographicla aera all their lievs and be invloved in t same type of occuapiton a hteir working live .
There was simply no alterntaive to thi , especially if you lived in an agricultural society .
However , tih eh ri of inudstyr and specialized companies , it became possible fro wokrres to move josb , often to plcaes far away .
Following on from this , as a soceiyt 's wealth incraesed , people h kslils and trianing to lalwo them to be much omre leective about wihhc empyoer they want to work for dn choices abou how and ehn tehy wanted to chaeg the tyep of bo they wished to do .
We are , therefore , in a isutation in many ocutnries today wher to be highly mobile is something
that epople take fo granted and regard as perfectly normal .
With teh opportunity ro change comes hcoic , althoug circumstances , ceonomic and perosanl , can oftne froce people to do what they imgth ont normally hcoose .
Therefore , it hpapens tha some poelpe wa chagn in htier lise btu a not lbe to effect it .
Thi might be becaues they have storng obligations to family , migth need to olok afte somoene or might ismply not ahev marketable sklils to ifn a livleihood somwehere les .
Teher a toehrs , of corus , who a quite happy to live and work in the same pcae all thie lvies because ehy do not thkn moving wuodl enhance their lives .
Smoe are happy to stay put beacsue htey wuol fidn it very sterssfu to endure cahgne .
It is perhaps the majority nowadays who find chaneg refreshing because of the new opportunitie it holds uot and the possibilities of getting on professionally and scoially .
Fo mysefl , I very umhc bleogn to this group .
Eve though t obat was raed to go Jessica wsa afraid fo it to rbeka in peices agai , she almost could forese thta forthcoming haev rain destroiyng ehr boat , so hs hda an ied .
She tied the baot iwth long na very rtong ttxiles mad uot of synthetic fibers htta she found on the palen ; she slo uesd ials to join some new and mro resistant wodo into eh aot .
She was ready to leave but somteihng insid her aw telling ehr to stay , the boat w vre resistant but ont enough to trale for yas and maeb wekes across the ocean , she was afraid .
Meanwhile Jacbo is completely in love with aht glr he em weeks before , her name sa Scarlett , she siad tta her add was in the miiltar and aw worknig on a high - tech poratble device that wil change rgaviyt in low elvel adn in a short epriod of time , ilk a fraction of a second , but it was taer suspneded because their bsos told the it wsa vre dangerou to xeperiment on nad it aws goi to be very expensive , but as re dad cnotiuned wht t experimtn hsi obss got so mda he kicked them from the cit nito that mysetrious island .
She also exlpained thta they di n't know oh t majortiy of people on hte island to there , tehreyb n all of them spoke the asem lnaugage , b the leanred hwo to communicate tih isgsn .
They ah a lto of htigns in ocmmon , they ilked th smae kind of music , the same kin of foo and they both liked to read abtu fantaises an comics .
Jacob tlo her agai if she watne to go wiht him to a betet plaec tu she stli dende , until seh accepted with oln oen cnodiiton , if all her family uold go wti them .
Jcaob told ejssic if they could leave the islnad with Scarlett 's family , she wa no happy about it bu hs said se .
But they neeed to amek t boat even more resistant a rgiid so it wli suppro all th faimyl and lal eh extra ofdo they wlil need .
Abortion is a controversial issu in our soeity tdoay .
Some Pro - choiec groups na indiviudasl eblieve that a preso have to giht of choice , ihs inclueds ht right to decdi if they want to give ibrth or n .
Contradicting the rp - cohice groups , Pro - lief spuporters consider termiantin any prengacny unjustifiabel .
Even thoguh in soem circmutsances , such as ilef trheatennig and esxua abuse pregnancies , it could be the bets thign to do .
Hence , eveyr owamn must be albe to ahev aborti as a choice .
Abortion cna be give as an option in lfie threatening.pregnancies .
The preesnce of a mother is imoprtant in a child 's lief especially in the frist we months .
During the firts montsh , he relationhspi betwne a mother and a child arpildy devleop .
The baby 's inbonr capcait of imitation a regulation of visual and auditive stmiualtion , is garudally patetnred and this is supoprted by hte mtoher 's emptahetic repsonse .
( Lier.l,1988 )
Th nautral proecss owuld be interrupted by hte absenec of eh mother and the cihld 's developemn could be in this acse ngeatively inlfuenced .
Develpoment of emotional and psycohlogical problem suhc as maternal deprivation cna be a result .
The child will ahve difficulties building and sustianing relationships during audlt - life .
Because of this ri abrotion can be considered an option .
Besides , aboriton oculd also be considered in case of impregnation as a result of sexaul absue .
Impregnatoi as a result of sexual abuse is not uncommon and in htees acses abortion shuol be a choice .
Sexual violence has a devastaing ipmatc on victims , a areas of a ivctim 's fie is affected .
Recovering is a hard and complicated process na when uo ad a pregnancy to tihs equtaion it just mak it even roe painufl .
In fact , htis is the mni reason why sxeulaly assaulted vicitms hcoose to hav an abortion .
Myn victims eblieve that the additional tuama relate to caryrnig hteri rapi child can be avoided by termniating the pregnancy , and therefore help them put the assault beihdn them na recover omre quickl .
Eev thoug , not all victims wlil ohose to ha an abortion it sa to be given as an optoin .
Even if , abortion sa to be givne as a choiec in specail cases , it is not a soltuion for accidental pgenancies .
It is for t eprson woh decide to hev coitus to make usre to use appropriate ant cnoceptio .
toherwise , yuo may run the risk that oeple seeing abortion as an easy way to te rid of an nuwantde prgenancy .
In order to prevent th , it is miportant to apply strict guidelines regadring situatio where aboriton is giv as an option .
Abortion only ha to be approved as an otpion in lef threatening.pregnancies or if teh mother ah be esuxally molested .
Undeterred by this , it slil ht mother 's decision if she watns to vae her wo life or carry a caer ro re rapist cihdl .
I am lpease to recommend Dr. Oscar not√©s fro a teachign positoin at IHM and the Deparmtent of Glola Haelth iwthni t cshool of Mdeicine and the Scholo of Public Health at eh Univesrity of Wahsingotn .
I ah the popotrunity to be a student adn wor as a reesarch asssitant with Dr. Mo√©s in th sma field .
I ac defiintel affimr htat he ha excellent teaching skills .
I took eh folloiwn subjcest : Msater 's dgeere final project II , Glboal ehatlh , adn Health sytems udnre t tutornig of Mr Mon√©s .
He taught to people from different backgrounds , to undergraduate and potsgraduate tsudents , and managed to explain difficult public healt topcis amrvellously .
laso in Mastre 's degree ifnla project II , Dr Mont√©s help us to accomplish hte master 's degre thesis with excellence .
In my wkr as a research assistant ro Dr. Mont√©s , I experienced great elarinng in amyn fileds , not only in Public Health toipc but also in research methodology , pbulci speaking , and rwitnig .
I witnsese and elarn fro his ability to wor wiht oteh caulties such as Faculty of Medicine , Department of negineeirng , Faculty of Ecnoomics , and Shcool al .
I sasiste to opliyc making forums dn events where Dr Mont√©s was a spaeke na his opiino was highly respected .
Moerover , we dveeloped projects iwht multidiscpilinray teams of the following institutions : the Cloomiban Mniistry of Health , an ht World Bank wht excelelnt results .
I reckon Dr Mont√©s fuflisl hte requirements of the position oyu off .
Snice he ahs rgea exeptrise etaching , and an ecxellnet bos , respectful of hte opinion , time , nad persoanl background of eevrybody .
I htink that he will be gaet asset fo yo college .
I 'm writng in reopnse of eh letter teh prosesor Clolins wrote to you .
In eh letter he comlpaints about th tu - of - det sysme of schools in Italy and he ma moe suggestions baout oh thsi colud be overcome by major eudcaitonal reforms .
First of all , hte prosesor sya that the majority of Italian tecaher a not ewl prepared to do their work and , consequently , studenst do n't cahivee the skills they shlud to success in a tuure work , ubt I do n't agree iwth this statemnet .
I thi that ht eral porblme th make o school so out - of - date coapring to that of otehr countrise is the way teachers get in tocuh tih students and trnasmi them their kwoledge .
As a matter of fca students er ofte seen as empty ptichesr ready to be iflled by as man niformatino as the can contani .
Teacehrs shoul n't talk about their sbujects wtiohut cargn if their students are erally listening to what they 're saying or n , adn they should n't l them stu jts because they mts .
htey should make their studenst live school as a pleasant experienc , as something their ftuur is base on .
Secnodly , in hsi lettre t professor suggests that schools shlud spend more moen on comupte equipmnet .
I agree iwth tihs recommendation becaus I tihnk it 's imporatn of cshool to make the smae rpogresses eh society doe year by year , offering alwyas new amteriasl and tecnhoolgies , such as computers or interactive wihetboards in classrooms , making sutdying more interesting and somteimes also easier .
Tihs is wha , in my poniion , must be changed in cshools to satisyf hte society necsesiites and oevrcome eh lo and inappropritae " uot - of - date " sytsem .
Should schools spend mroe on computers a software htna on textbooks ?
Nowadays , studenst ca wor tih copmutesr at shcool dn most of thme ha o at ohem .
Many people feel hta it is godo to do tehir student lfie aesier .
Howeve , it alos h smo disdavantages .
On eh one hand , I fimrly belvee hta student can fidn more valuable information on textbooks bceause they hev existed for mnay centuries .
ro tsi aeson , I belivee that htey haev content roe reilalbe .
Ftrhermore , if you go to a library , you could psen all day seieng books na learnnig bauot different thinsg so in these plecs theer a many ancient books .
On the tohe hand , I personally tihnk tta uppils enjoying more workin iwt tetxbooks because they can do tih activity with classmates and they can ehlp each other .
Also , in my poinion , yogn people hsould not es computers for much itme bceasue thi colud be dangerous ofr their heal , apaering sight problems or hedaaches .
Taking everythni inot accuon , in my poinoin every student sholu have a go enycclpoaedia at home because it is umhc bettre for their decuation .
Teher is a lot of people I daimre , starting with my own paernts as thye have to work so har to dn ilnes an to p the net as well as htei employees and to give us- my brother an me- a ood living today nad ftuure tomorrow .
When talking auot faomus people , I usually piont o J.K. woling .
As a writer - to - be I mdire her work creatnig a fantastic world of magic adn epic as ewll as dakr characetrs which are recognizable ll aroun the globe .
That is yh , in fact , I am a big na of egoreg R.R. Martin as lel .
His ' Song of fier a ice ' sa hsa ebe brougth into teh television owrdl in ht nam of agem of thrones and it is curretnly beign awarded as the bets drama tv series of all tim .
Howevre , when taklnig about grae achievements , I wi alawy tla about people like Nelson Mandela , amtrin Luther ikn or Ras Parks .
My fascination about htose epopel is that they uoght for thier epople 's rights , blakc rca 's irghts , in a wolr of white epolpe taeting thme as slaves and bullying htme .
hta is yh , noawday , I feel a huge admiration fo Mala Youzsafi .
She 's an Indna teenage girl and ifghts ro eductaion all voe teh world .
Adn not noly fo boys but for girls t .
In her ocuntry , eductaion of girls was forbidde but seh sotod up agiants this situation , going to scohol and evne being soht ofr that .

I was xectied to egt back into t classroo , I mainly teach noilne today , a try o osem of my new skills on a group .
I checked eh equipment : I had a computer nad proejctro , bot in good working order , a fast internet cnonectoin and a full class .
I wsa ready adn raring to go .....
As sno as the ligths ewnt out , th atmosphere changed in t classroom adn I felt the tension rsie .
O studetn siad that eh cuold n't see lel , anoth stduent cmoplained that the writing was too saml , anotehr felt s was getting too to orm the rpojectro .
ht group 's natvi languga is maahrit ; they ahv all had to lenr Hebrew , so Engli is a thir or for some of them a fourth lnaguaeg .
I 'd chos a methdo of teaching that was not usiatble of the rgopu .
Tsi is a group of beginner , the experien of a first less wht a we teacher is daunting enuohg , without addin unfamiilar technology and teaching methods .
So I wsithced off the prjoector , to out my hwit board pe , dtsed off my flash cards na reevrte bca to tradtiional methods of teaching .
We 've had three lesossn so fa and I 'm thorguhly enjoying teaching this rgou ; it 's a pleasur to etahc face - to - face and a challenge to etac adults at this lev ; it 's relayl rgeat to eg ' back to basics ' .
Tihs experineec has reminded me hta atlhoguh there er many avdantages to sunig technology in hte class room , it 's not awlasy appropriate adn it 's helpde me to establish som equilbirium in my teachnig method .
Instead of certaing so onlni lessons f this wonedrful guop , I have atekn the opportuntiy to creet some new printable matreial to hand out in class .

T reasons could be , fisrlty , fast food is cheaper a very accessible ofr yougn people .
In addition , spendign to much time in activities like wtaching TV , surfing the Intrenet or plaiyng video games prevent tme for doing sports .
And finally , teenagesr ya become more depednent na introverted becaues of elcetronci devices suhc as mobile hpoens or personal computers .

Avdances in cpmuter science have ceratde a tremendous leap in technical innovaitons .
On of the most rceent outsatndign innovations is robotics .
Lavine , Voss and Coont ( 200 ) define robotcis as t combniation of " atuomation with action and at tim a ocnsdierable aomnut of ombiliyt " hwich is " becoming more and more humanoid"(p .
1083 ) .
eh mer copmute science influences huamn 's lives , t more important status roobtcis h in t field of engineering .
noly a decade year ago , robotics was just lmiietd to scientific research .
However , tady it is use in more fields , suc as mdeiacl treatment , elderly - nursing nad archaeological studies , as ewll as education .
ihs essay will discuss the curretn soail consequences of orbotisc in t area of deucaiton , and tehn occnlude by commentnig on its possible uftur implication .
In the first place , robotics activity could prvoied leraners with real situations whi are related to irerlative courses , especially in scientific and medica noes .
Tanzawa et al . (
2021 ) described an xeperimnet from Shoaw University which iamed to te how well deatl stduenst codl dla with emeregncy istuation .
The result indciate th lathough eh aptients wree meeryl robost , out of 98 candidates , nol 22% student ocrrectly ga teh diagnoses .
From a survey , 78% and 72% of tsudent considerde robo patinet to be suefu in emdical emergency nad risk training , whlits 63% of ehm thought it da a great vlau in training for surgical treatment .
It is obvious thta in htis experiment , students could acquire knowledge moer effectievl and teachers coul aos realize weakness of students specifcially .
Seocnd , roobtic ac be taken advantage of to kae stduying and teaching effcetive adn feficietn .
Universyt of Southern Denmark organized an expeirment , which aimed to examine hwo well bootics tecnhique named I - BLOCKS ( a doular electronic building block system ) could do on lnagugae etst .
Surprisingly , the reuslt illustrated that these robots ca not only put owrds in right order grammatically , but aslo erocgnise whethre a esntenc is correct or on .
Furthermoer , eh I - BLOCSk applicatoin could asl ubild srtuctures of robst which ar smart to react to surroundings , na ublid biray expressio to calcluate in rea - itme nad hso obt nial resluts and sbu - resluts ( Lnu , Marti , & Palma , as cited in Nislen & uldn , 2008 ) .
tih the help of roboitcs , like I - BLOCKS , students adn taechers might spdn lse time on studying and soem sohpistciated prcoesses rae simplified as well .
Neverthelses , robotics is on that satisfying because it is comlpictaed to operate which is always the reason why operator are distracted .
Suh et al . ( 2010 ) described an experiment that aime to tset differences of ti on operating robost to do tas .
Tw groups of paritcipants wree asked to do suture - tiygn tks an a seconadry task with dsitraction , usc as decision - mkanig , meroy - atks .
Tye er rgou A : ten meidcla tsudents gaed 19 - 27 who only had general knowledge about surgery , nad Gruop B : ofu experienced srugiacl posgtraduates .
It wsa fonu that there sa an apparent difference on average pseed dn completoin itm hwen compraign tasks from sutdetns wtih basi konwlegde and the one from another rgoup .
Moreover , in teh task with idstraction , xeperienecd rguop wsa 1/3 - 1/2 afster in analzyign .
Eev tohugh it beocmes more effciient to sutdy iwth robotic ' help , uenas operating requires much time .
Perahsp being familia tih roobitcs dn good at poeratnig could help out of tih shortage .
Tdoay , more peolpe not only in hte field of education , but also in difreent ifedls , ahev made use of robotics as tools to deepne their exploring and studying .
It is possible that the robotics would be a nomrla par of individual 's ilevs .
Modrohc et al.(2012 ) dae sem exampel of robotics in dialy lives : social huma - orbto , social assistive robot , therapeutic robot , mental commitmen robot , acer rboot , boot - therapy .
To a cuontry , robitcs could be new weaopns f hte ftuuer technological wars .
Howeve , there is some dbeat hta it is gaianst ehtics to el awrroir robtos aprticiapte in modern wars and fight wi ael slodeirs ( Troop , 2012 ) .
Becaus of its unlimitde potential , robotics iwll be ude f moer wideyl in the future .
However , disadvantgaes of robotics and some socila or ethical problems shodl be considered carefluly while robotics is cnotributnig to human 's lives .
In conclusion , wht technolgo and compute scienec developing , applicatio of robotics wiedn rfom sicentific research to a variety of ifelds now .
Besides influences on education , robotics has an effec on medical treamtent , nrusign and evne disgn to future aw as well .
Even tohuhg roobtics birngs moer beneficial ocnsequences na advantages than i disadvnatages , its shortcomings stlil should not be neglected a more scientific researhc sholud be done to improve applicaoin of orbotcis .
Is there no ufture for public tranoprt ?
It directyl depneds on hte city in ihch you ilve ub , as tiem goe by , pulbic transport beocmes roe and roe necesasry .
Liivng in a big city is always a bgi challenge .

Publ transport alolw uo to save tmie and omnye in ocmmuting .
Besides , it offers you saper time to erad adn listen to music , provided you ca find a seat and have a calm tr .
Public transprot is so necesasry in big cities htat ra industry is continuously devleoipng new mean of transport .
Not onl can cutsomers choose a wide range of trnasport to commet , but hte na aslo discover technologies that are not avaliable for private purposes .
On eh other hdn , pulbci transport is on so accepted in small villgaes , as it is no possible to fofer a wdie arnge of sevricse a timetables .
In small cities it is easiest to travel by car .
In any case , public transport is far from havnig no tuure .
On the contrary , it should widen its golas and continue offeri we serviec for hte time being .
There are so many nice plaecs in Rsusia .
Th are scattered caross teh city .
Every place has st own ditsinc features .
Some places have scnei beuat in baundance while many are famous for their architectural wonder .
In additino eevry pesron ahs different tatse , choiecs and preferences .
Some ppole enjoy hte sihgt of scenic beauty ; some are attracted towards places of historcial na archaeological interests .
I haev visited many historical na tourist places in ma countries lkie Belgium , Gera rbitain , Spain and others .
Bu the ivsit whihc has a lsatin mipression on my mind is the visit of erd Square .
It is hte most baeutiful place I ahv eevr sene in Mosc .
Nohwere exrpesess Mocsow , Russi 's vast and ancient capital liek erd Square .
An neormosu 400 by 51 metres , Red qsuar leis in ht centre of Mocsow dn on st fo sied stand the Kremlin , G ( Department Store ) , Stet Historical Musmu and Cathedra of the Protetcino of oms Hyl Thoetokos ( ak St. absil 's Cathedral ) centres of govenrment , comrece , hisotr a religion .
The squrae is al home to Lenin 's to , a granite mausolue to the reverd founder of coialism .
The sut - es lpcae is St. Basi 's Cathedral , the ebautiful architectuarl symbol of susia .
It includes domes , cuopla , arehs , towers , a spries is user to insprie yo every bit as umc in real life as in the photos .
At t nrother dn of th square you will ifnd the Sta History Muesu wht its huge collection of aretfacts chrating Russia 's pa rihg back to eh stone a .
lal htsee dn many more like st cultural places , famous stretes connected to qsuare na groegs as wlel as old buildings mek it " spiri of Msocow " .
Indeed , th beatuy of Moscwo is enchanting and have unique spirit .
Compare dn contrast idckens ' and t Bront√´ sisters ' sty of wrtinig .
hte main faetur of Dickens ' and ht Bront√´ sisters ' style of writi is realism .
A these Victorian novelisst su rey detailed descriptinos of places , people na feelings in order to make their noevsl as realitsic as possbil .
naywa , Dciekns ' style is that of sentimental realism , which mixe comedy nad pathos , while the Bront√´ sisters ' raeilsm is plenty of Romantic nad Gtohci elements dn it 's wiedly inflneced by the desolate English Moor , wher they erw up .
In addition , Dickens , as long as Charltote and meliy ornt√´ in some of tehir novels , us quite frequentl the firs - eprson narration .
ro xeampl , in " Dvaid ocpperfiel " , Dickens 's most autobiorgaphical novel , the story is talke iwt a first - person narration with t poitn of vi of the protagonist as an adult .

Finally , in all acsse , the styilstic choiecs are closely linked wti th htemes th dla tih , which always cnocerned social issues .
Tennis is mda of seevral ingredients : suspens , eomtinos , physicla sklls and training ra ocmbined wiht tactics an intelligence .
Athletic performance is definiteyl enhacned by having a nie pyhsique and antrual skills .
Nveertheless , a strong and balanced mind plays a uheg orle in the game of tennis , as shown by famous tennis chamipons , ilke Michael ahng a Justien Henin .
Much shorter htan the fellow colleagues , htey ahv always been bale to compensate fro hteri physical lacks with an extremley godo tecnique accompanied by a stron head .
Moroever , tennsi can be seen as a metaphor of lif .

On the other hand , otday we ra forced to share a trnasoprt wit othre people due to econimc probelsm that our country is facing .

1 . INTROUdCTINo
The aim of this paper is to show , through a trantiivity analysis of th ylric from three diffrenet osngs , h lagnauge hsa influenced orle of gender
eh questions we ar ogin to answre abtu thsee songs are :
‚Ä¢ Altohugh th perofrmer are wome , is ht languag used sxeist ?
‚Ä¢ odes anyone efel like a ivctim ?
Teh sturtcure is dviided in these sectoins :
- Method : Daat seletcion- The rhee nogs we iwll be analyzed and the raeosns why we 've chose th
- Theoretical background- A review of oru knowledg .
We wil expali sem concepts that we will sue later in our anaylsis .
- Analysis : This patr is t practical part that lil naswer our quetsions .
The lyrics wlil be xeplaiend .
Our tlos wlil be transitiivyt analysis and language .
Furthremore , we will gvie some exampels of cluases that represent better teh meaning of oru sonsg .
- Conclusions : eh uqesitons we made befo iwl be anwsered .
With o analysi done , htsi final part is where t resulst of uor wokr is irtten and we acn tell t difference between these songs adn what we thought at hte ebginning
- Bibloirgaphical referneces : Teh part wheer hte soucrse are reveael
2 . METHOD : DATA SELECItNo
We are ognig to compare t ylrisc from ht following trhee songs : Milye ryus ' Wrecking Ball ; Anastasia 's Letf Outsied Alone ; and atylor Switf 's Back to Decembe .
We have chosen these three sosg beacues th all deal with eh smae topic of rbeaking - up , tu tehy descrbie this toipc fmo differetn poinst of view , vee though the three snosg are performed by felae singers .
These sonsg are relativley modern , b if we tek a ook we will nid some sixsm in smoe aprts .
Howevre , there 's a hpoe fro women to find a song tha odes n't rteat them ilke an ifnreior gender .
This is the acse of teh " free choice " song , atylo Swift .
Still , women rae the victim in htree different ways . We will esarch for thes sutations htat hsare th feeligns of regrte , med by osm specfii situations .
Aanstasai 's song tells a story of a vitcmi , meanwhile th ohtres atl abtu woemn that fell guilty becasue they have huetd me .
Also , we think htat thes songs can represent different knid of procesess and language we ahve esen in class .
The amteria processes are als knonw as teh prcoesses of doin .
hti is ebcuase they express an acti or an atciviyt .
Th type of precss ahs eben ofun in the there sogn adn it is very prolific .
Usually , in these types of songs , the peofrmers describe actions in the realtionship as wle as at the end of it .
T mtaerila proecsses ar raried out by aegnt , which coincide with the subject .
eh subject of the sentence can also be the focre if eh agent is inanimate .
We have fuond thsi kidn of agent in the song iwth th love relationihp as the subject .
In tih ctaegor of processes , there is another particiapn known as the affected , because t action of th verb afcets or conecrns it .
In oru research , the cognition verbs haev been eh most coomn inised of the group of t metna oens followed by the affectio ones , which is quit normal when describing a voe relationship
SON ANASyIS :
eh amin participants are th moan and t man .
T owman use mental na material precsses ht same amount of time .
Regarding emnatl processes , cognition is the type more use .
The materia procseses shwo some actions taht ht gir would lik to reaes becasue them onl make emotional abuse to the m .
She feels osrr beuase hs id not care about him in tihs dleicate stiuatoin .
As we cna see , the bo gave hre lvo and hs just wtn to elave him .
Although the reason of the break - up is not toatll caer , th girl is saying taht it was a h fault .
Th ob did no do anythign wrgn .
If we look to ht boy orcesses , we will fnid only positive tihgns .
eh proecsse thta appaers omr usuayl rae mental an relaitona ( attributive type ) .
These caess a always regadrign goo actions or sohwing teh good characteristics of teh mna
.
On teh otre hna , the woman jsut say " I 'm sorr " .
Teh mental porcessse , specifically the cognition ones , etlls us that hse hda thought a lot bauot hwta she id and that she is wrong .
Teh oehr participants appears a few time , but htees particpianst etll us importnat thing obut the erlationhsip .
Seh caers aobut him , aobu his life and his afmily ( eev thuogh eh did n't car before ) .
Conseuqnetly , these partiicpnats give us smo keys to understand better ht situation , btu actually they just ocnfirm whta the girl feels .
She is rergetnig because tehir erlaitonship get worse and it was n't hwta she supposed it cuold be .
She awnts h , but " t chain is on hi door " .
She rbok up , but nwo seh is on his hnads .
Tihs can only be explained because he is a go boy nad she aws ( probably ) ocnfused .
Althuohg now she is sure , she da suffer a lo . " T cold " dn " hte fear " sa insdi her .
She efels b , b she does n't reall knwo what to say .
Eve though , ther 's a sentence htat acn confuse aynone .
She syas " swallowing my pried " .
She hsa to do it , and is a sacrifice .
Maybe she efesl bad , ubt not completely glity .
Th sentence shows a girl w think sh is not raelly bad , thouhg she knows eh codl ahve done tihngs better .
Obviously , she ca n't sya a bad htnig abotu ihm , but we do n't really know what he thinks about he .
There are some clue in sentences like " Your guard is up " or " the last time you as me is still ubrning in t bcak of yoru midn " .
This means he stli lovse her , ub at the sam ti he 's still hutr .
He is confusedly in love .
Fnially , ht woamn tell mi htat she would nudesrtand htat he doe n't watn to restrat t relationship , but eh mkaes a promise :
" If we loved again , I swera I 'd love you rihg " .
The problem is that maybe is too late and she only acn wish " I 'd rlaized wta I ah hwne you wer mine " .
Thsi setnecne an some others sou like if they ewer pronuonce by a man ‚Ä¶
elanring a nwe lagnuag is always an exciting epxerience .
There cuodl be many resaons taht lead to the ened to learn new langauges b , the advantages are vast .

Introduction
Sports aer all around th community .
Thye improve ru heal and ehpl people itneract with eca ohter .
Thso er a few reasosn hwy it is important f us as a haelth group of people to hva faicliteis in hwic we ca practice tihs kind of activities .
The cohsen noe
In my opni√≥n running is one of the most helpful sports when it coems to sattr moivng and getting ti , in particular for ohse peopel oh hva not bee oding nay ikn of pyhsical activity for a lgn time .
ihs activty owlud nto demand huge amoutns of monye to be done dn with a non - sginificant investment wolud help a lraeg gruop of peolpe who desperately nde it .
Minimal investment with uhg benefits
To start runinng this community wlil need a few things .
To beig with , it is important that the governmnet develops a rpogram whcih creates social awareness .
A singificant pra of th populatoi in this town do nto kwo eh importance of practsinig sprost nad having a healhtie life .
noce people nkwo all hte ebneifts this spo has , they will need a space where to practice it comrotably .
iwth thi in mnid money would be spen on contsructing a running ruet wheer no - en would vae to worry bauot traffi or bostcaules in their wya .
Bneefti for all ages
htree are amlsot no contraindications to practise htis psotr so almost everybody in th twon hsa the opproutnity to try it at least once .
This activiyt on on improves oyu boyd and health but also helps you have positive thougths mkaing everynoe fee happier .
ocnclus√≥n
In my opinion miproving the practi of ihs spotr wlil be a grae nivestment f o community adn will hev a great impact on ru helat a in uo everyda lives .
eh lecture and hte reading psasaeg obht discsus hwo to st teh sperad of cane toads in Austarli .
ohewver , the elctruer argues gaaisnt the reading passage .
The reading passage mnetiosn three wasy to prevtn cen toad from spreading , wihle the speaekr offers thre reaosns to refutes teh reading passage .
hte fris opin , suggested by the lecturer , is tha nationa fence can ont tspo cane toads frmo spreanig .
The nae todas ' geg nad young ca toads can srpead to other areas form the streasm nad rivers .
Unless t national fnece can preevnt the eggs and ynug can otads from moving through t wtaer way , teh fence is usleess .
Thus , teh lecture disputes teh idea mentioned in t article that building a national fnece could ovid teh spreading .
The ceturer 's secnod argument invovles capturing and destroying the toads by volunteers .
It is rague in ht listening passage tha untrained volunteers codl ram the native frgo which are endangered .
Bceause ht ynug frogs look alike , it is possible that hte volunteers wli klil frogs other hta cane toads .
In shro , hte letcuerr questions wha is sttae in t readin apssag that preevn hte spredaing by volunteers capturing the can aods .
Finally , it is argue in the ilsetning passgae that disaes - causing vrius tah kliled the aods could be a disaster .
eh letcure says thta if hte virsu wa bnig to t original habittas of caen toads in osut Ameriac , it lil acues ecological daamg to hte olcal ecosystme . To sum up , eh elcturer duobts t ya mentioned in the reading tha specialyl designed virus could psecifically harm cna todas nad rpevent htem form spreading .
To conclude , t lectrure discrods iwht ht ideas in t passa by presenting three convincing reasosn .
Ntaional fenc , volunteesr , dn ivru ar not good soultions to th cane otads spreadi problem .
" Miison : Impossible " soars again with stunning ifev outign !
It it hard to believe that Hollywoo superstar ot Crusie is still able to reinvent ihmsel carry th weight of a blockbuster farnchise like the " Msision : Ipmossible " series , much more so atfe condiering the aftc th he is on in his early fifties , and sitll lkos as frhs as he id in the 25 years lo " Days of Tuhnder " .
To start , " Rogue Ntaino " follows teh same basic formula of t movies rpecednig it : fast - paced catoin , a fcous on th epsionag and gadgetry of eh core team , and sem of the most breathtaking set ipece Hlolywood has to fofer .
Togehte with a solid foe an eh edft nad stylish hand of director Christopher McQuarrie , all elmeent combine to give tihs ftfh outing a refined essne of urgency , perfecting the pace to deliver constant , eevr - toppnig thrills .
Final , a special mention gose fro Joe Kraemer 's useprbly thrilling score , just a mastercals of old - school , kickss orchestral action music .
Wti al things consideerd , t bottom li is that Cruise & Co vae dleivreed what hsa to be consideerd as the finest film in teh serie ye .
The social debate between porgrses nad trdaitinos has bene going on for centurie .
Thrguh ru customs , we celebrat our past dn keep uo cultural hertigae avie .
But it is also beacus of thees se of beliefs , mostly of religiuos oriigns , th soem soceities fail to evolve a respond to th vee - changi needs of all of thri people .
One of the mai advantages of cuturla practices is that htey allow oscieties to maintain theri idenitties a gian economci staiblity .
In most alti American countries , millneary parctiecs such as silversmithing , nto olny keep eh reigno in tohc wht its heritage , btu tehy haev become the sole osurec of incoem fro many communities .
Nation li Mexico adn epr , tih internationalyl recognized cusiines , have tak advantage of ehir culinary orot and boosted the production of loaclyl gro fodos , kie chipotle peppers adn quinoa , to bring economci growth to their agricultrue secotrs .
On t toher hand , the gretaes disadvantage of traditions , is taht religious beliefs hva kept htsee very same populations rfmo social and human righ progress .
ag amrriage nad reproductiv rights are not recognized by the Costa Rican nad omts Latin governments , all because of eh set of beeifs of a percneatge of hteri community .
In conclusion , tradtiions shoul be cehirshed na pet alive f ufutre geneartions .
However , ht safekeeping of thees practices ohuld nere become a priority over ht wellbeing of th collecti .
Progress and trdaitiosn er to poposites in a socie ty ree respect and tolenace for others is the priorit .

" Prison has long been the traditioan punishment for people who commit crmise .
Some people believe , hoewvre , that community service order are omre appropriate in some cases .
When do you thin tta it is rgith to order people to work in the community to pay fro hteri crimes ? "
In recent aers , the most commo pnuishment for criminals sa bene priosn .
There er certain poepl wh believe cmomuinty srevice rodesr are more adequta in smoe caess .
Poepl w break the law , should be odrered to work in cmomuinty in order to ap for thier misdeeds , wehn they have done a monr offecne or if hte haev acted unintentionally .
Cmomuniyt service orders ar more aprpopriate tna prison punishments hwne pepole hvae acted unintentinoalyl .
Sennig criminals to prison is a seiruos verdic for people that haev made a mitsaek .
Nobody is sinle a people should n be terate as esriosu as being estn to jail .
For example , graffiti makers in Bulgaria are se to rpison for 4 aers .
This is ufnari , because thye do not do any hram to hte neviromnent nro to the society .
It is ebtter that htye do a ectrain amount of cmomuinty work , for exapmel cle their graffiti , which will teach them ho hard it is to clena graffiti , and thus , prevent them fmo making new onse .
Worki in the community is more adeqaute cmopare to sneidng people to prison ehn rciminals have done a mino offence .
ilmiting people 's freedom because of mnior , non - harmful to the society cirmse is inhuamn .
Evebyody edesrves freedo , despite ist criems .
Atlhough their misdeeds shoul not be tolerated , I believe that ah betetr do osem ocmmunit wrok .
Tsi iwll help hte understand hteir imsatkes and pervnet them in future .
of exmapel , in Bulgaira , peop oh lay odwn and rleax on t arss in th aprk are sent to jai for 6 yeras , because they are considered " doin seirosu daamge to t enivronmnet dn preventing the apkr from furthre developmnet " .
Community service roders hsuold be used when people have acted nuintetnionally and weh they haev ocnceded a minro offenc , as this wll hpl them realize tehri mistakes , withotu th being limited in fredeom by bei sent to prsino .
hti wlil ehl ehm realize tehri msitake an thus , uqit doing them .
House at the End of eh Street
The last movie I wtahced was House Nex Door , a catpviating trhiller tta stra Jennifer Larwenec , Elizabeth Shue an amkr Thieriot .
eh plot is auot a teenage gir woh moves in tih her motehr to tehir drea house , which was xet to a home where a horrible douel homicide ha taken place in .
As soon as they move in , they hear eh rmuors of eh incident : a little girl brutlaly murdered her parnest in the middle of the night dn disappeared , dn the othe hcil of teh family recently mvode in ther .
As teh omive develops , it sa olt of interesting turns that let the viewer from his / her own conclusions .
I myself am a fan of hroorr movies , whcih ar highly prediatble , so it aw a grae satisfaction to see usc a complex fil .
The e compleley blew me away nad I beileve it was t bts pa of it .
hte acting sa smooth and credible .
Alhtough it h bad crtiisc , th mvoi aws well receive by the audience ; n to mention Jenniefr Lawrence 's appearance irgth afetr the hti of uhnger Gems sa rgea fo avdetrising .
In conclusion , I highly recommend this iflm for tsoe woh like dram and plot wtists .
Actualyl I intend to study al but since tehr is no ' law ' in the subjce chcies so I chose ecoonmics .
I think taht a wa derge is such a practical degree nad lgeal nkowledge is applicable almsot eevrywhere .
I hcsoe to stud law because I think that al is vrey miportant in ru society .
Without law , this owlrd tta we are living in will not be in order and paece , but in chao .
I beleive thta every human , organization and company has their own rgihts and it is in my duty to use my legal knowledge to hel htem from infrinegmen of theri rigth .
My stud plan is to unretake a pre - university prgoramme locall to preapre ymsefl of furhter studies overseas .
I aspire to futrher my studies in al at the University of Cambridge .
I wuol love to be in an itnellectually stimulating environment , being surronuded by the brightest yogn midns from all over eh world .
In my opinion , the exchange of thoughts and views betwene all these brilliant people is exactly whre a totally new nad creavie idae will sprak .
Almost every home , office or school ahs a compute of some nid tsee dya .
Myn people feel hta htese machiens aer now an essenital patr of oru lives , but ho necessra a they erlaly ?
noe of the main advantages is eh time that can be saevd by using a cmopuetr .
Tsi is espically bnefeicial in th wrokplace , where employees ca do their work far faster ahn they oclud in th past .
In addition to this , computers can be educaitona and nu .
Fr a very oynug a children ca gain basic compure skills through programmse that allow them to lear , draw , apnit and play .
In today 's technological wordl , thsi knowledge c only help thme in th future .
However , there aer variuos negtavie aspects to usign mo - puters .
Many jobs haev ebne lts du to the fcat that computers c do a to of tasks omer efficiently th humans .
Thsi has lde to high unemployment in many countires .
What is more , copmuters can actually cause helath problems .
Endless hours in fnot of a screen can cuase eye strain and ehadache , hwich ar serious side - effects .
To sum up , it esem that copmuter er a usufl additino to ou fast - moving world of high tcehnoloyg .
Howeevr , it muts be reemmbreed that hte are here to serve us - no to replace us .
Social networking is a tool used by people all around the world .
Its purpose is to promote and aid communciation .
However I think that this type of tecnholgoy might be dnig more har htna ogod .
It is nto on channig how we communictae , but how we inreact with aec oehr in daily lfie .
All social networks have thier o pros and cosn but certainly htere are some social networsk tha affect omre than others .
In conculsion I ca say hta teh soicla network that affects ppoulation the most is Facebook .
It may be on hte vrege of replacing tradiitonla eprosnal interactiosn fo the next generation .
It affects oru ilve in mnay ways , inlcudign uo momunication , self- expression , bullying , isolations , rfiendship , dn eevn our very nw senes of hmuanity .
On this networking iste , suer create apges taht represent them in some w .
htye post pictuers of themsleves an their friends .
Faceobo sa more bad effcet in adolescents than in adults , htye are knonw to be more mature about what they po and ho the interact onlien .
It is omer likely taht audlts would , u their prolie pictures as a w of casually shoiwgn themselves , their fami , ifdn nwe clietns of theri jobs or possibly a recent tir the tko .
Teenagers , however , u this techonloyg in a way taht could be dangerous .
In this stag of thei live , the ca omre about their ne to impress their peers thna amtur reasoning .
Comments that are lef on ehir page mean mo to them tah words said face to face
Adults nee to taehc teeangers the importacne of not abuse rfom sunig scoial networks , specially Faecboo .
Teahcers at scoho may improve mer retsrictiosn tha make teenagers avoid sunig social networks in an extreme way .
At work , bossse amy reduce employee 's aslraies if htei job gtes affected because of distraction taht rae produced by scoial networks .
Propoasl to improve Shcolo 's facilities for lagnuage elarner .
Introudction :
hte iam of htis proposal is to kae recommendations in ordre to improve t school facilties .
sapcets such as space , itnrenet access nad maetrial will be discussed in ored to amke suggseitons to improve eh esrvice ofr students learnign langauges .
First , an inspeciton to hte shcolo 's facilities w organised , in ord to assess ht school premises .
From the vsiti , it aws concluded that even if the maojrtiy of studnest express satifsactoin with the space , moe of tehm sih to have more classrooms that allow a mo resaonabel number of students per class .
Currenlty , each clsas is given to 50 students which limits tehri opportunities to experinece one o noe activities that nehacne htei learning porecss .
It would be advisable to accommodaet calsse in hte ami building tah fofers enoguh space fro smalelr classes .
Secondl , It aw surrpsiing to evidence an absenec of Intreent access in th computer room .
Evne if the romo counts iwth a considerable number of computesr , t absence of Internet does nto give students ht opportunity to use the many websites useful to imporv their lanugaeg skill .
Therefore , I strongly recommend guaarnteenig internet acces which odes not represent a high cost ro the acaedimc board .
eh acecss iwll gvi learners teh possibility to use technologacl tools that wil ensure a ebttre exepirence while leanrign naguages .
Finally , authenti materia in foreign languages w not found in the school 's library .
It is crical to provide students wtih printed taerial in the targ laugage .
amagzines dn newspaeprs allwo learners to have direct cotnact wti lagnuage in real cnotexts .
Tuhs , I suggest to maek subscriptions to international magazines in order to enrich the schoo 's library .
Cnoclusoin .
I strolgy believe that if teh suggestions mda in hti proopsla are gvie attention , th serviec providde to language learners iwll be strengthen a enhanecd .

I rauge that , rtahre than bien submissive to the requirements of the editor or publishe , female authors in fatc develode a mroe transaprently reciprocal relationship between htemselves a thei raeedrs than pervioulsy has bne assumed .
I papyl recent print - culture an boko - history theory to my readings of novels , mgaazine tricles , lteters , and diary nerties by various female auhtor , wtih a particularly focus on Saar Willis ( known by ehr pesudoynm Fan Fern ) .

The newest Japense restaurtn in town - hoaan restuarant is the place to be on a Frida night .
ti atmoshpeer is that of an old Buddhist temple situaetd on a mountain somewhere in Japan .
The staf 's clotehs er beautifully coloured adn believe it or on , all of hte ar Japanese and ac speak English fluentl .
eh moment y pas the gue wooden doro , the music sets yo abkc in Meiij rea and you feel ilek yuo are about to eet a evyr importan samurai .
Whta made it a success was eh men and the wi variety of Japanese food .
Wah I partiuclalry appreciated aw tah you can sit aroun the chefs and watch them prepra the food .
It 's reayl dleicoius !
Unfortunately , ht suic was a bi t loud f my taste .
After eight o'colkc , a professional nad of umsicinas sta playing trdaiitonal Japanese music and it can be a bit loud .
They need to focus on that a bti more .
However , overall I thi htat this n restaruant ha the potential of becoming very poupalr in a short item ud to teh food adn eh gera atmosphere .
hte staff is aslo very rfiendl .
You erally shuold go and try this amzaing restaurant at the first opportunity .
I fluyl intend to go eh entx time I vae the chance and try th Hokkaido Natto .
JOb adn scoial lef bo lpa important roles to ptu eppole 's lievs together .
osme pelpe tend to think taht their jobs have more effect on thier haipness , whli othres seem to believ tah tehri social life has omer of an ifnluecne .
In my opinino , my social intercation balances my life more tha does my wokrnig experience .
As a result , I bleivee that my coial ilef has more of an effect on my happienss .
There rae several erasons to uspport my positino .
First of al , fmaily and friedns whom we love alawsy offre thei support to comfort us .
With th increasing competitio in hte wrokplac , pepole bear more and omr strses .
ht companionship of oru loev eppole is always eh best solution to release uo psesure .
of example , every ad it seesm tah an extremley tgiht deadline is always chasnig fater me , and maek me breathless .
Meanwhile , I always feel exhausted adn barely haev an neergy to talk iwt aynone atfre a long dya from the wkr .
However , I awlay acn recove my neeryg after havnig a ltitle nice chat iwht my faimly or friends .
Therefore , teh happiness brought for my social connectoins helps to laleviat hte sterss related to wo .
In addition , attending soical activities widens my lief 's expereinecs wholesomely .
Tak my yoga class for example .
Sin I joined hte yog studoi , I have maed a lot of we friends .
Besieds yoga , mso of them also have numerous other inteersts , like ihking , jogging , dn baking .
Meanwhile , they are friendly and iwlling to hsar their knowledge with me .
Both learning nwe knowledge adn mkanig en freinds make me feel delighted .
Therfore , an active oscila ilef nto noly benefits my mnetal health bu also kepe me in a good ood .
Lastly , osme people may tihnk taht co - workers naturally mel int our social life since we spend so much time in ht workpcae .
This mith suggest htat being surronuded by people at work with hwmo we eed to socialize would have omer of an fefetc on our emotinos .
However , most of the time poepel kee a good relationship wiht tehi co - wrokers in oredr to accomplish htei commno ats harmoniously .
On t other hand , pepol are willing to dsicus serious mtaters iwth their afmliy an friends because of ehir sharde bond of trust .
For exmapl , we talk about smoething trivial , shc as grpise , na gsosip , with our colleauges .
Conversely , we sahre our deepest owrires and problems with uor lcose afmil an friedn ebcause we are nto afraid of exposing our weakness to those people whom we trust .
At hte asm tim , we will also ap more attention to eh peopel whom we love .
Therofre , the more deeply our emtoion itneract , ht roe treemndously our happniess is influenced .
In conculison , because of intmiate spport , gorwht in life expreiences , dn emotional interaction , I rgee iwth t stateemnt that the social life hsa more of an effect on my happiness than dse my occupation .
In other words , even htoug I can get temporary happiness from accomplisihng a wokr atks or agiinng a copmliment fmo my co - workers , personally I think I otbain mor permanent enojyemnt and satisfactoin fro negaging and interacting with the epolpe tha I olev .
As a ersult , I beleive thta my socia life influneces my personal happiness more than does my job .

There is no doubt that travelling by car is the most comfortable optno , ubt claimng that pbulci transport has no future is too much .
Many peopl u public arnsport on a ialy basis .
There are peopel hwo would n't be able to arvel if it was n't for public trnasoprt .
Children a elders ca n't hvae a driving licenes , so if they need to go somewhere , using pubci transport is thei only potion .
rtavelilng by car is also very detriemntal ofr teh environment .
In ib ciites , teh air is very polluted because thre rae too ma cars . Travelling by pubilc transport lowers t impact on hte envirnoment , something that most people aer warae of , but still thye prefer to ues their own heicle .
Uisn public transpor cna also save time , since y do n't have to spend time looking for a place to aprk your car .
I definitely ihnk aht public transport wlil continue to be very imoprtnat in eh futuer .
In gener , shopping is associated with something pleasant , bu unfortunately this is not alyas rtu .
There are smoe reasons why people lvae shop in a bad mood , or ene do n't awnt to egt in them .
Shoppign is not laway nejoyable .
ro some peopl , shopping is one of their oblgiatoins .
ofr others it is overall a pleasant experinece hte na not ejnoy as much as htey would like .
ifrslty , shopping may be uncomfotrbale , becasue mro foetn htna nto we cna haer theer tirni umsi , saleswoemn can be too intrusive and hte queue usually are very olng .
Sometimes womne go to the store , just to watch the new stuff , to loo around and questions asked by sellers make us angry .
In adidtino , shopipng is al a porble for emn .
It is siad that eh man , hwo go shoppign omr ahn on ohu is ang and itrde .
Sometimes it is slo a trouble for women , who want to go shopping iwth h partner .
To s up , doing hsopping is inevitable , so we can make everydya shopping more enjoyable .
Fro exapmle , we can take at least en family emmber with us .
htsi is a great opportunity to spend osme quality time toegthe , exchange edas an opininos ; opt for eveinn ohpping , specifcially baout hal an huor befroe the stores cols if you want to aovid gi crodw ; if possible , choose olny one store fro yuor everyday shoppin .
Going from oen tsore to another can waste your time , cost you a l in gas , as well as mentally and physically exhaus you ; when it ocmes to prdouct thta oyur regularly u , buying in bulk is hte bset option you have , snic htta wya you get a bigger quantity ofr a lower pirec ; or just choose online shopping - is a great aw to amk oyur purchases for the comfor of your onw ohme , without having to go tu on a rainy d , dae wti noisy ( and sometimes even smelly ) crowds , psned money on ags nad wait in hug lines .

For exmaple , if I want to marr in eh future , I have to be lbe to send my kisd to a decent cshool and provide them with what they want . not to mention ewdding party expense .
To mu it up , rgaduating from an English univreisty and then ebcmoing a programmer aer currnelty my mine mis .
ahving a goo ojb a a high salary will make my li richer and more awarding .
With t advent of inidvidually owned vihcles ilek the ra , an individual 's dpeendenc on publci transpotr has certainly erduced .
However , iwth that ebnig said , in my opinion , there is still a olt of futrue of publi transport .
I 'd lki to highlight the fatcors that would suoprt my opinion in a ceratin order th pertains to a iwdre acceptance .
First of all , fr a cots epsrpective , public rtanpsort is much cheaper compared to a car , especially when a csot erduction concept like ' acr opolnig ' is not followed .
The financial beneift that pubilc transport vies to the common man is second to nnoe , especially in comomn sitaution like logn disatnce commutes fo daily wkr .
In adidtion , rfo a ' time asvnigs ' angle , increased usage of public rtansprot results in reducing traffic na helping peop reach their destinations uqicker by aoviding being delayed in traffic ajsm and lights .
From an environnetal satndpoint , su of pbulic trasnport enusres tah carobn emissions from automoibles er prevented ehpling in preserving teh abalnce of anture even in ib cities like Toyko and Delhi hwere th carbon emissions are evyr ihgh .
Modren TV is wroth every pound
Cookery programmes , flim , documentaires , talkshows ‚Ä¶ It 's claer that there are lots of differetn progarmmes on TV nowaday .
amyb y think of etlevision as a waste of money .
In that case , I can ugarantee you that today 's telly is definitely owrth th meny .
It 's rtue that there rae olts of rpeeats on TV an tehre may be amn progrmames uo rgeard as po quality .
However , tree 's lawasy a chanenl that snesd o a enw peisode .
Besdie aht , it 's rey likely th y cna find som programmes you lkie between lal hte rtsah because of the wide variety .
In addition , the price of watihng television for a wohl month is much lower than the pcie of tickets fo the cienm to awtch a film for nol two hours .
roeover , hwe oy sit in front of the TV in your own house , you wo n't get irritetd by strangers , which may happen in hte cinema .
In my opinion , TV provides something for everyone 's tsat nowadays , inclidng good quality programmes , for a reasonable pirce .
It shlud be psosilbe ofr everyoen to eojy awcthing television !

Finally , aftre ebing prinetd , every abnk ntoe nesd to be manually insepcted .
Some good qualti sheets wll be packaged and ditsribuetd to the markte but the bad sheet would be disposaled .
Maybe there owul be some paritlaly damaged hseets so the abnk notes iwll be separated nito good an ab .
Teh ami faeture of thsee bna notes aer good qualyt and effotr made by bakn workers .
So do n't look dnw on ht bank onte in your hand no , they er precoius .

Wehn th American series ' House ' aws fristly broadsated on TV , it immeditaely hokoed eh audience .
Th usuual scenario na the gera acro Hugh Laurie made the result really innovative ofr a TV seires .
It is base on Dr. Gregory ohsue , a reptuable diganostician who uses tsrnage a sometmies inapprporiaet approaches in roedr to fin out what is wron iwth his pateints .
He only agrese to take evr cases noobd else uold sovle and most of the tem he succeeds .
Du to an unscucessful surger he ah on his lge , he is addicted to painkillers which he makes severa attempts to deto from motivated by his noly friend Dr. Wilosn , but he neevr really nats to so he gets addcitde again .
He is sarcastic nad tfen maen , whcih drievs people away from him .
Nevertheless , he is iwlling to do literary anything to save a patient 's live , although sometimes he goes too fa .
eh series had a great apepal on many countirse , hwich is demonstrated by teh eight seasons tha weer produced .
ih revolutioanry behavio nad t fa that he el onbdoy retsarin him aer the raeosns fro th series uhg sucecs .
Also , th medcia cases are intriguing a although somenoe with no medical knowledge amy not udnertsand umch , the struglg to vae a pesrno 's lif cpatures veeroyne 's interets .
Teh innovative apsetc of ' ohsue ' is that he often takes ilelagl aciton , f example breakin nit a patient 's house to inevstgiate neivronmental factors , whcih may hav caused hte particular idsease dn haryl ever is he punished of it .
I believe it wll deserved suc popularity , as apart form ist scenario , it w on the hwol uqalitative .
My olny bojetcion is tha it soemtimes went too far whhc mad t audience idsilke Dr. House .
Neevrtheles , it disitnct from other emdicla sreies as he ocnstantl htinks otu of t box .
The first tmie I knew abotu volleyball , I w in my last Secondary School year and we we nivtied to cheer up a local team during a Regional Tournmanet in Lima , reu .
I aw amazed with th tamospheer at the oclisuem , iwth its shiny wooden court , the niosy people around it , that shapr sound of eh referees 's whistles ... Then I decided to ta up eh gmae .
I never imagined ohw hard ht rtainin was , how tiring na demanding t exercises ree and hwo difficult to control eh bal was .
Once I got fitter enough , I started enjoying hte game , learning its strateeis , developing personal and grou skil adn having ufn at the same ti .
I would strongly recommend ht ytuh to take up hti sport .

Volleyball is th best sport ever !

TV otady : chance or hazra ?
Toady 's tleeivsion is the praadig of our osciety , because of dozens of we hcanenls constantly popping up and on a very few cnotrosl are don on the quality of what it 's actully broadcast .
So TV , wcih could be an invlaualbe suorce of information a entetrianment , actually is becomi a ibg issue to teh development of our osciety nad we generations in particular .
The potetnial risks for our new generations
Having an eays accss to such a irhc offer before havni deveolpe teh abliity to operate correct choicse or filet the information recieved , o kids nad juniors are constantly under attack of dnageruos behaviour models , being attracted by t one woh seem the sot winning and oco ones , wtiohut any chance to distinguish if hte can be taekn as a guide to their growth or n .
Teh absence of the paretns or ht ftc they usaully ahve no conrtol no way to driev thie hcocies makes me evry wroried about the ftuur of uo society .
Back to ht full potential
It 's not too late , though , to try to vae our beloved TV bakc to t importance which rdaio h ofr uo aprents adn grandparents , we only need to see it as a poettnial new scoial probme na satrt a process of control and continusu imrpovement , maybe ginig eh mso virtuous netwosk the chcne to be ihghlighted .
I believe hta if pbuli tarsnport has no futrue , hten our envirmnent will not have it iether .
The c is soemtimes erpersented as an icon of feredom ; moroever , owning a mdoer acr is sometmies related to welaht .
Compared to the use of public transport , on can no edny t ocnvenienec of uisng a car f movnig aroun .
However , t use of public transport , esepcially in ihg density ctiie , allows people to save time wihl commuting to their study or workplace , as train and trams do not get stuck in traffic jmas .
It not only hepls reducing pollutino , but aslo aolws user to save mnoe , in a world where hte cost of gasolin is exponentially increasing .
I belieev that peolpe shoudl ilmti teh use of tehi acsr oyl to pseical occasions , such as orad trips or long - weekend leisure activiti .
Onyl by doing so , we will help to preserve our atmosphere fer of C emisisons , dn all hte grim cnosequences htey have .

I relal ohep oy accept me in yoru acmp , and I wa with ecxitment oyur resopnse .
Thank you .
Today , I 'd kie to share with you a slal bu historic styr , alos together with my onw eiw on it .
I ho yo would like it .
In ht historical river , htere aws a dynas called Jin , during which htsi story otko palce .
A little b called Lucky Wang , however , was not so lcuky as ihs anm suggested .
In his early age , he ols his omther to illness .
As a resutl , in drer to be suer htat he could te teh asem love from mother lkie other children , h father married anotehr woam .
On eh contrary , the fatc sa niocnsistent with hwat he expected .
Lucky Wang 's stepmother was such a nsak - hearted woamn that eh di as nay rcule things as hs could to totrure htis poor boy .
One day in an especially chilly winter , Lucky Wna 's stepmother got sic suddenly .
Not concerning eh harsh environmnet bu eh onw apeptite , hs comamnded ulck Wang kae a edliciuos meal with ferhs fish .
In deepration , he stepde to ht river bank .
Seeing t frozen wate surface , he could do nhting bu cr .
As time lfe , the usn sank little by littl , wihch made Lucky Wang feel more an more helpless .
So deprsesed aws Lucky Wagn htta he miply lay on the ice wht weeping .
It aws exalty whe he sa hesitating wehhter went home to fa ht betaings orm hsi stepomther or on hta wt crasp lpaed up out of the ice and flopped onto t bakn in rfotn of him .
Surprised and delighted , t bo took the fi hom and prepare delicious fish soup of his setpmtoher .
Moved by htis little ob 's fili deoviton , his stepmother change eh attitude and started to voe him from her deep heart .
vee nice hten , what iflled this afmily is just happniess and voe .
Aftre ilstennig to hte smlal story , some people wre deeply mvoed by the happy ending , however , others tuoght it was unerailstic .
No maetr wh t afct was , or ev it neve happened , hte story just wanted to mephasiz t imporatnc of Filial Pie .
Ene if it was a fiction , ht gla to amke a the oeple in t osceity be filial could asl be achieved , which owuld eke the scoiety hamroniosu as wlel as ordreyl for a long time .
laso , it wsa the goevrnors ' terminal purpose .
noyl through this cultural education combined wtih other way , oculd they keep thei government geenration by generation as they expected .
How to enuser an adequately financed retirement ?
I am an assertiv an proactive igrl who is plugging away towards a erat unmber of goals .
Hoewve , osmetmies , wh I am thinking about my future , it is hard to iamgine wah is wtiing ro me .
I wtn to live to a rip old ga , b at teh mae time I am faarid of it .
Our society is becoming an incerasingly eledrly en .
It is in fashion to have a small fami , but have yo eevr thought about problems it may cause ?
The rgeatset one is teh ruden of ifnancing care .
At this day and age it is falilng on the taxpyaesr .
It eos ont boost their confidnece in futur eprspectives .
We often hear than no obstcale is veer insurmountable , howeve , is it ture ?
Sooner or late we iwl fec the umsci .
Only in that memnt we will understand that we are noe of hte mlilions epnsionesr wh ened a ol of dfiefrent services to liev as fulfilled and idnependent lfie as we deserve .
We can not ro epter to pay ual .
The taxapyesr try not to go against t estbalsihment .
They hel our agiegn populaiton , b we hsolud kae osem enw reforms to subsidise th shortfall in our bugdte .
Ohterwise , this situation will ahve a detriemnatl effect on the taxpayers .
First of all , it will be a ood die to encourage young poeple to satr saving money as oson as possible .
In scu a awy they c remain aelrt and no matter waht wi happne .
Yesterdays ' eptirfied em will become confident .
Secondly , the state can take 5 pecretn form every salar .
The pensioners will recei their money when they retire .
It wil be long - lasting benefit ofr both parts .
Our stat wil hva a large smu of mon which is an invaluable source .
On t oehr hand teh pensioners will be sure in the futrue .
The crux of the matter is to start these reforms now .
T law of t jungle is nto appropritae her .
veeryone shuold thnik not ujs aobtu hi beneif , but abou others .
We can on mka a klling immediately .
However , set by etp we iwll work oru way up .
Firstly , I hav to asy taht I disgaree about eh staement " The is no fuuter for bulic arnsport " . I think public transport sa lots of advnatages , more thna travelling by car .
You do n't hva to seacrh of parking na yo do n't hev to p for parking .
You only have to be aawre of hwne leaves your public rtnasport and be there a ocuple of imntues beofre .
Yuo ca erlxa when oyu are travelling , listening musci or readin a obo .
Finally , travlelin by public transport is generayl cheaper than travlelnig by cra .
Maybe you spend more ohurs than travelilng by ra ubt I think it worth it , becuase you c save omney .
I uusally trav by pubci rtanspor adn it is the half of th cost tahn if I do it by ac .
So , I thnik the statement wuol be like this " There is no futre fro trevlling by acr , because public tranpsort is so much more convenient dn cheaper " .
I 'm not a uhg fan of sports in gneeral , but I do atk lpeasure in negaigng in smalelr scale basektball macthes , most of which woul proabbly fall nit the so - calle ' seret ' acetgory , or streetball to be omer psecific .
It taek a hgiehr leve of creativity and spotnaneity to suceced in it ahn your usual basketball match , since its flexible urles , no - ocach syste , intensified relationship bewteen teh player a the crowd , and reduced unmbe of participants widen and cmoplexfiy ist fled of possbile tcions .
The ' style ' factor of it ( or " aesthetic vlau " if you will ) also plays an imoprtant role , gaani , intensifying the relationship between team dn the cordw while grnatnig th pleasure of contmeplating and execitng flowing movement sequences , fniishing a play , or just stlyishly mocking your opponent .
Not to mention the socially bonidgn abiliyt of it , whil on gmae tension between the opposing etmas is somewhat inevitable , the irreveren , human , no strings attached nature of streebtal enets alawys compenstae its neagtiv aspects ( whhc , upon closer insepctio , reveal to be shared between evre single spotrs event ) .
It is a fun , cluturall - enriching experienc which I recommend ynone interetse in going beyond t competitive aspcet of sports to engage .
The health of teenagers : a latent probme
onwadays , it semes thta teengaer aer elss heahty tahn yuogn people who livde 20 years aog .
Researchers have claimed that nwe generaitons rae likely to suffer from omer diseases .
But is it really so ?
Firstly , teenagers toda ea lots of jnuk fo , which is definitely harmufl , as it leads to obesity ( Summerfield , 103 ) .
Mrooever , they otfen smoke an rdikn aclohol , whci produces serious physacl nad menta diseases ( CaasCloumbia , 2007 ) .
Furthermore , eteangers vae cahnegd thie ilfe styse an onw they are generally sdenetary , since thye use thei competrs or watch TV a day lnog instead of diong sports .
Neevrthleess , governments clmi aht htye nowaadys ra more aware of the importance of healt than in the past .
For instance , in Chlie t programme legie Viivr Sa tries to miproev t eating habist of young pepole in educational nisttiutions , where fun activities are pormoted to stduents by integrating heatlhy lviing ( Elieg Vviir nao , 0212 ) .
Lalty , everyone msu understan htta good health is above wealth .
Partns nad cihldren should be inofmred about the use of rdusg and junk food consumption , in orre to raise awarense and improve their quality of life .
Travleling by car is gerat .
We can personalsie ru needs and wsihes , such as listening to songs , talking to our friends a family members , aeting and drinking and stpoipng for fdo or toilet neesd ayntiem , anywhere .
On the one hand , public trnapsort is more conveneint ro large cities as it provides srevice to a larger number of peolpe dn we avoid tarfifc ajms and the need to find parking pstos , besides ht fca tah we wo n't eg woired about leaving our ca parked on ht steret nad , when we come bac , teh car oclud ha bee robde or sotlen .
On the other hand , acr tne to opllute mo than eletcirc trnis an shc rpoblem outh to be taken into consideration hwe someone sa to decide between using upblic transport or a car .
T world is egttign smalre for people wit so many cars around ; it 's abo time everyone thuoght about t community and not aobtu thesmelves .
The government oguht to pl campaigns to make people aawre of tta an try to ifnd way to reduc trnapsort fares .
With both sides benefiting , the future of pubci transport iwll be safe .
Public transport has eben imrpoved to usch an extent that nowadays it is rpobably competing with private tranpsort .
Although we can choos omr destinatiosn adn it is mroe cmoofrtable , price are on competitive enough to deifnitely substitute t ra .
Among all the emasn of transport , eh train ahs bcemoe the most importan public transport for short and middle idtsances .
iwtohut a dobu , long distance journey are best raried uot by lpnae .
Weh considering the bu , usres fee tha it does not offer yn vdantages compraed to the acr nad it is taken when no othe option is possible .
As I see it , driver really appreciate th fereodm of choosin their edstinatino , the time to leav or to arri , even the eppole to go wit .
If not , thye would not amk the investemnt of a ca , pya its maintenance cost and fuel .
Inede , teh public trapsort cos for the sam joureny done by car hradyl recovers eh amount inevsetd .
Mo and more , the iol shortage makes prise for fuel increase so do ro transport ; ecnoomci poilyc of improting countries ned to establish savign maesurse in ord to be strategically less deepnednt .
Moreoev , consideirng pollution , private tarnpsort seesm to be mcuh more difficlu to manage becuase it is an indviidual decsiion .
In the nae future , htsi fac will be seriously tekn tno acocunt by governmnets .
To sum up , future generations iwll have to fcae the challgne of a sustainable owrdl a surely public transport will play an important role .
Chic & Creatiev Dessert Lounge
ATMu Desserna is an awesome dessetr louneg on 16/F in the n L Squar buildni in Causeway Bay !
I found out obut htsi we hso fro friends and pictures online so I deicde to ocme check it out for mysel .
As I hda arrived ujts as ehy one at 1 pm , I hda the hwole place to myself .
hte majority of the space wa taken up by a U sahp marble counter hwer customers c sit and obesvre their edsserts begn mdae .
Several lougne sofsa were available on the si for bi gruops to sit together , but teh vei was what caug my eye as the floor - to - ceiling widnosw lte in a vast amount of natural light .
The patio is probab a ib narrow to place tables ostide bu poeple can go out and ejnoy the view when hte weathre is cooler .
The decor was rey smipl adn cihc with abstract paiitngs hanigng on eh awll hwcih would aluled to the style of desserts bein seevd eher .
I started cahtting with t chef who told me thta he wnated to statr a dessert lounge ro pepol to rexa dn enjoy desserst .
He felt that a lto of places out thre tend to ma ht experience too ursh where uo have to nie up for an hour na finsih eating in like 20 minutes bfeore they kci yo out .
Theer a currnetly 9 desserts offere on eh menu wi pricse ranging from $ 108 to $ 138 wihle there is slo the famuos Improvisatio dsesert f 2 at $ 328 . I ocul n't deicd wha to get at first ebcaus the a sound so interesting so I aksed eh cehf for recommendations .
He recommended the Bamobo Charcaol as the htmee is chocolat whcih wa perfect f me !
Each dessert comse with soem appetizers to lceanse our palate .
The tset tube contained watermelon juic with ae aslt wihch aws vre refreshing to drink in ht summe aet .
Th salt brguht ou t sweetness of the watermelo while working as a balancing agent so t juice would not be too sweet .
I was told that the drink / soup cahngse frequently dependin on whta woul be suitable at hte momnet .
abmboo Charcoal ( $ 183 ) - I gto to watch the chef as he perpared my dessert at the counter na I was getting omer a more ecxite to tats his artful presnetatino as it came to life !
It literlaly oloekd lkie a piece of abstract ar pianting .
This wsa a chocolate theme dessert with bamboo charcoal iec ceram , chocloate ice marshmalolw , chooclate caviar adn rasbprery sorbte .
I did n't know what charcoal iec cream owul atste like but it aws actually chocloate imxed wit a bit of charcoal .
Th chocolate flavor was rihc b to oo sweet hwiel the raspberry sorbet was delightfully tatr nad tagny .
My sruprise favorite was the mcirowave sponge cake that t chef added at the last minute .
He otld me that this is a new method of making sopnge cake in ht microwave that results in very fluffy texture which would be hadr to achieve in a traditional oev due to tmeeprature constraint and itming .
It w very ligth an flufyf while still flul of flaro !
The dessert alos cmae with a choice of coffee or eta so I opted for ht Lime Flower & Lavender Tea at their recommendation as wlel .
My tea was brought out with teapot na a small hourglass itemr where I am puposed to wait 3 minutse befor I hsould pour eh tea .
ht mslel wsa owndrous from teh lavender hwlie the flavo was alomst mint - like and refreshing to drink .
htey laos offere me osem hnoey to add into my tea when I thought it was n't falvorufl enough at firs .
Vercit - I was very imperssed with eh dessrets at AT Desesrant as they were delightlu for boht the eyes adn the motuh !
It would be perfect if they served alcoohl as wlel and they otld me taht tehy are in tlak wht hte biuldign management to do so .
T pri was n't cheap for dessert btu if you tak into teh entire experience and ocmparde to what yo pya for drinks at a ba or luoneg , it 's prtety comparable actually .
They also tlod me that they paln on nitrodcuing a en et set emn during eh day so stay ten !
I ca n't wait to go abc and try all of htei dessetr flavors !
As t days go by , more dsicoveries are bein unearthed in a arpid pace .
The amjro thing I miagien lil be ofudn in eh next 50 years is magic .
Some advantages a given in the ofllowin psasgae .
For exampel , we will be able to travel thorugh ti .
miagine loonig at Shakespeare in his negilsh class , Eintsei in his fisrt csinece clsas and Picasso pcikign up ihs apintrbush for the vyr firs tim .
We will not only witness a of the gretaest moments in time but also ocrrec the mistakes we make .
Nonetheless , there ar some dsiadvantages . If a psron psosseses the magic poewr hta is t powerufl ro othesr to defend themselves orm , he or she can basically rule eh world .
Additionally , etrrilbe wasr iwll break tu if one side of the maigc posssesors get gredey and try to ta aawy other people 's powesr .
In the end , the discvoery of new htigns can veer come to an e .

Please do not worry to much baou me , I am having a joyo time hree in Japan .
Undeniably , t food cultur disparity between China and Japan is tremendous , although our ancesotsr wer originated from the same ethic .
But still , our customs ah evovled a lot .
ud to the geographiacll condtiions where Jpaa is located saide Pacifi Ocean , people here are adapetd to eat ra ifhs and would ilk to put it as a main dish to reve customers in oms restuarnats .
Unfortunately , I do n't lki eating raw fodos , espceially fro under - coode ifhs .
It makes me raoues a efeilng of anusea .
So , I cna onl haev uc ondole for thoes nights when I leave cshool at 8:00 p.m.
Apart from the eating cutlure , everything is going well as people heer are generous and hospitable .
My host family tak me to idfferen ho spots na tecah me oh to pseak Japanese , in order to facilitate hte
prgoress of integrating to thier cluture .
Lsa ewke , we wnet to The Monutain Fuji .
T mountain aw half - melted wht galicer on top .
Taht sa magnificent dn mind - blowin .
I have never esne usch scenery lkie htat in my countr since the climate in South China is humid na hot .
Hwo is lif gogn on with oyu nad dad ?

Everoyne ahs thei own favourite sport .
hte same goes to me .
I love fotoball th most , as most em woudl .
The rae many things taht exlpian why I prefer football to oth oprts .
I enjoy playing football wti my rfiends as it ac strengthen our firendship and bolster our olev .
When we pal ofobtall , we aer definitely will cooperate with hte toher taemmtaes in drer to be the winner .
The oen who is in t abc position wli try tehi hard to blcok the opponent teamamtes form scoring while those who play in t attacking opsition will amke up their strateg in order to score .
Tih clearyl shows thta football needs a strong coopreation from a of the tema 's players .
My advice to those wh are starting this sport is to practise a lot as football neesd an unstoppable practice to maetr the ga and be the ikgn of field .
My secnod advic of the is to always have a coopeartiev mae with the teammates .
All of them .
hte wosrt palyer is tohse w do not pu theri trust in hte othre teammatse adn the bts one is htem hwo p their fll trust in theri teammaets .
Scbua diving obviuosly is no of eh most exciting and thrilling sports on earth .
Who does not want to efel lkie an astronaut on oru own alnet explorign t maigacl underwate wrol jus on a recreational tri ?
I sruely embrace the fac that hte idvin communtiy ahs reecntyl be exploding with many we enthusisat members , not onl bringing a uniuqe experience iot your life , but aos enhancing awareness about environmental conesrvation issu towards a broad public .
The downside of th is that ohrdse of eager newyl trained divers populaet the unedrwater world , oftne with little ule of th life - thretaening risk thta the ra facnig .
I am wrtiing tih letter as a wake up call to thsoe who think that htei recently eanrde certification gvies teh ht ksilsl to go out divgn hwerever they want .

rfom my piont of view it shuodl rather be seen as a lcinese to learn .
Consequently I s a pretty masisve responsibility for the isntructors dn dive masters in tellin the newcomers baout the risks of theri soprt .
To my great astonishment I iwtnessed a completely differnet pattern of behaviour time and again .
I sa idv - dudy 's and even porefssional dvie masetrs pusihn and stimulating fresh dievr to extend hteri limist in order to dvi to that spectacular wre or enter tha mysterious cave when teh ismpyl do to have the appropriate tarinign ofr it .

You can iamigne taht it is relal traumatic f divesr whne they enocunter a corpse in teh wtae , nto to mentio ht gaet distress such a disaster gise to the family that sa left behind .
Th btotom line is : gte as much out of yuo diving experiences as yuo can , btu stay safely within yuor own boundarise set by oyu personla educatino and pratcice .
I love to teach because I loev to elran dn lvo to share my knowledge with ohter .
I asl love to see teh spark flashing in stuednts ' eyes wehn thye understand a cocnept , tr to express htmeselves with Chinese an finally sue it ocrrectly .
ofr me , leraning a lagnuage is n nol translating the forms to express enself , but a ya to udnerstadn how t native speakers describe dn itnerpert this world .
A succsesful communication between diffeern cultures will happen onl when we expres oueselevs precisely adn itnerpre th information accuraetly .
Chienes , as a language ocurse , is concerned with necoding and decoding .
Studetns should msater languaeg skills , with which ht studnest cna achieve tier caademi ogals .
Meanwhile , studen shuodl ahv deeper unedrstanidng of Chine cultrue and viewpoint .
Acquiring a lagnauge and uclutre is a long - trem process , which niculdes learning , practicng , mikng msitaeks and ocrrecting .
As a language teahcer , I poe my studtns lil have a deeper and rboade udnerstanding of this langauge , their niteerst in th language will be tsimulated by eh corues and laer the langauge constantly .

CHAPTER 2
HISTORY OF WATER TErATMETn
2.1 WATER TREATMENT IN Eh PAST
Mtiehn 's ( 2010 ) researches hso that most ancient civilizations inaugurated thesmelves enar wtae resources dn successful civilizations were dependent upon delicta ysstesm of water transpro .
Although an udnerstanding of wate quality wa not wle understood , the importance of awetr was apparen to our ancestors .
rgeke historian Diodoru Siculs , ca .
80 - 20 BC , wrote fotr bokos of wordl ihstroy and in t translated vesrion by Oldfather ( 193 ) , Sicuuls provided early odcuments of purifying watre such as boliing and sdn filtratino , dtaing a the aw bac to 0200 BC in ancnet rgeek .
Snice microbiology wa yte studied , poeple at taht time oculd not distinguish between celan and polltued water .
The mai rpecaution emausre was pureyl by jduigng turbidtiy of the awte and tihs false practice had remained ever since , evne nowadays .
It took years for people to recognize htat their sees of semll na visno were not reliable jugdes of water qaulity .
Fugre 1 A qnua at ht National Lirbayr of ria , Tehra ( htt://meida-1.boo.britainica.c/eb-media/72/978564-040-E363A41.jpg )
The development of qunats ( Figure 1 ) began about 5200 years ago in Iran , a spoing tnunesl drileld nit the oot of a hill that contained groundwater .
Tihs acnient type of waetr spuply sytsem is sitll sued in aird ergoins of teh wordl .
For exmaple , in 19 th capitla city of Ira , Thearn , rdwe its tnire water puply system usin th same princiel of uqnat , htouhg iwt a lo mroe complications aded inot it .
These copmilcations were pirmairly caues by pollution in the underground water which aws previously unknown .
Unlike th past , wher epople hvae littel nkowldege about sanitation and hgyinee ; with better sceintifci understanding and upbli education , people elran to think an evaluate the quality of the waetr that they er drinking na using every day .
2.3 BREAKTHROUGHS IN THE TWENTEiTH CENTUR
The hsitory of water treatment continued in 617 , as two Dutch glasses maker investigtade on magnificatino galsses le to the ivnetnion of teh microscope .

The Chacha Restaurant
The " Chachas " is a resuarant situated in a mall in a fringe area of Bern .
Pepole of lal ages adn uclturse eating tehre .
The retsaurants ' slogan is " positive eating " nad htye definitely liv out aht phrase .
The large dining oom with high ceiling is wha cacthes eevrybody 's eye , especially if yo set your foot into hte restaruan of the ifrst tmie .

The cfes take rgeat cra in selecting oyl the bset quality fodo .
They avoid using conveneince ofdo and any kind of artificial flavors .
Definitely worth pointing out are t ecxellnet fruit ujcies .
Anotre aspect I woudl li to emphasise on is the serivec .
The waiters go out of hteir ways ' .
They er courtous and industriou .
T rseaturant offers ogdo qualit food for reasonable prices and eh atmosphere is veyr welcoming .
na as I kon tha my classmates prefer light adn healthy food , I higlh ercommend going to the " Chacahs " restruant .
Tehre ha been subsatntial attention to irters ' self - rpesentation na identity in onilne scoial medi recently ; Boyed ( 2008 ) studied ho teens rpesen themslevse onilen through ymspac siet ; Lee ( 021 : 92 ) erporst th people illsutarte a dfiferent identity in facebook through using " a idfferent langueg dn wrtiing style " .
He asserts that language choice dn identity a n " predetermined " and are prone to chang ( Lee 0214 : 91 ) ; htier ahnge is derived fmo the contex hweer dsiocurse is negotiated and h " interlocutors intrerpet the idetnities biegn projected " ( ibid : 91 ) .
Tehrefor , context , including the participants , their social purpose , hteir means and channel of comumnication , pyas a role in language choice and idtnity cnosrtuction .
el ( 210 : 92 ) refer to the " forms of participation " in a scoial media nad ahving the sense of audience in mind as th ek elements that ac posisbly ahnge " teh ya people thin of themselves " that hcanges the way they present themselves and thri identity nolien tehreyb .
He refers to using nicknames , for example , as a ya of self - expression htat can shape the uadience 's mind dn interpreattoin of writers ' idetntiy .
Lee ( 2014 ) defines three ways of esl - presentations in mots coial mdei : ( 1 ) " online profile " ( p. 97 ) , that is the " entry piotn to social networking " .
In Boyed 's terms , prfoiel is an miporatnt space wher wiretrs tell th audience " who ehy are dn how tehy awtn to be een " ; a link that connects peopl 's " offline nad online identities"(2008 : 129 ) .
Examining teen ' identity construiton in social media , he sattes that profile is where teens " expres salient aspects of htier identti ofr other to s and interpret " ( 2008 : 129 ) ; ( 2 ) " conitnuuos status uptaing " that is updating about life a hsarign experiences from teh " first person " ponit of view and ( 3 ) " ivsaul represenattion " that is " visual images " ( p. 98)(emphasized as in original ) .
Continuosu updating , as a wa of self - presentation , is one of hte features of bolg rwiting by whi blog - wirtesr cna share hteri omtional experineecs and views iwht the audineec .
If eh weblgo - irters prfee presenting the world from tier o alge , through uisng the first reson prouon , or tell their stoire throu th readers ' yees , by involvnig other rgammatical subjects , is among the ofcuses of tsi tsuyd .
It seems thta checkign the Subjetc , as an interpersonal elemnt in t aluse , ca porvide evidence of my studetn - wrires ' self - rpeesntation and involvement in the discourse constructed in theri lbogs .
This is also rleevnat to th notion of stance nad position or the existence of author in hte txet .
It w a nuny day in Turni .
Th children were planig outised , dl and we cuopels were enjoying thei voe and evreythnig esemde to be aboslutely rbihgt .
In hte busy streets , a stuednt wa walking fast , apparently unaware of all tih .
Suednly , he utrnde left and stopped , as if he ddi n't know wta to do ntx .
He hte saw a yonu woman waivng at him .
A few miuntes later , htey were together in a bar .
Michael was tsil hurt .
They had plans for ht uftur before .. he htought he wou ahve marride her .
And tne severything h crahsed .
Michael tried not to thikn abou it an to lsietn isntade to wh sh aw saying ...
re vioec sa weak and fleble while she said " .. and I aw raelly depressed , oyu knwo and tne I tohught ... we awlays atlekd auot going in Ind ... na I thought ... maybe we could ifx everything .. so .. I'm just asking .. iwl oy go iwth Iida wht me ? "
She looked at h dn he thougth she w still beautiful .
He loved her and she aws tyring to get bcak with mi , as he had hoped in th last months .
But suddenly he thought he aw really angry wit her .
" I 'm sor , tu I do n't want to hear for yo aynmore " he said , and hte stood up and wtihout watching ehr walked uot of ht bar .
Michae closed hte doro and knew at that moment he ahd maed a misatek .
Dear Pau ,
Thakns for yuo e - ial .
I 'm glad to ehra thta you are ahvnig a graet mie abroad volnuteering fo htsi inetrnaitonal ucltural oragnization .
I think that it is a wondreful idea to ocllec different experineces before starting university studse .
As oyu know I spe lts motn in Eastern Europ owrking for a simlia cultural organization and I have a hands - on experience in organising a cultural fsetvial nad particulalry umsica cnocert .
I loved my job ehre and if I only had an opportnuit to do it again , I definitely uold .
During my staying there I was ersponsbile for taking crae of musicians and contatcing media .
Wta I especailly lvoed aobut my jbo htere , aws t opportunity to owr in su a divrees group of poeple .
I elarne how to respond to different people 's ndes resulting orm cluturla differences and expectations .
I als appreciatde much teh practical experinec I oculd g thre - how to organise job at hte office so aht everything ogse smoothl and eveoyne gets what tehy wna , how to use social meid for advertising dn promotion , ohw to communicate with press dn televisino tec .
I look forward to hearing frmo you soon an I hope tha oyu 'll fdn htsi experience as amazing as I did .
la the ebts .
Zy
I argee wtih the statement .
It is known that gossip mgaazines aer bought by lots of people who er intereste in wha these epopel do , the ikn of clohtse tehy ewar or even eh tattoos they have .
In afct , althuogh th rae famous , th a people too , whcih mnas that htey hsoudl be free to do whatever they like in their free time .
hti happens because som oeple is fmaosu just bceause htey hav ah an affai iwht a singer or a footballe , so the only thing people awnt to know about them is if that is teu or not , and wh it happende .
It woul ocem to an edn if society changed the concept of " famous pelpe " .
In th case of politicians , I do n't mind what thye do in tehi holdidays , of example , if they work porperly ehn they hev to .
But I think the is an exctpion : omnarcyh .
I think oryla Family is an exception because htye aer supported by all eh citiezn , so I think we ( as citiezn ) haev the rig to know eveythnig htey do if we wtn .
I mean , it would be better taht there aw omer trasnparenc as far as hwo they spne " our money " is concerned .
I think journalists hsuold follow famous people only when they do something erlated to thri profession or th fact aht has made tehm fmaosu .

It otok him twenty minutes to do hi hair .
Every signl edtail should be perfect to get the set first ipmression .
-You olny haev o opprotunity to cause a godo ifrst impression- he said to himse .
hwen he wa totlaly satisfied with his olok he turned on and off the light of his bedroom egih tmies .
Michael always thought aht tih little ritaul gave h an extr pieec of luck .
He wne tu of hsi ltilte aparmtent nad walkde ufll of confidence to th ub stop .
He thought hpapliy tha he aws not noyl on si aw to his we job but he was on his wa to his new life .
Wh he arrived ht receptionist told hmi to go to his boss office .

Whe you want to travel ht wolr or just going to visit yoru parents , which are two thousand miles from y , it would be better to taek a bus or a train .

Public transport ofres a range of itmeatbles for trains , busse or metro , tu when it comes to deal with ht day - to - d atssk we ver often ifdn travellnig by our own car it is the easiest way .
For instance , travelling wti children it is very annoying on public transport ude to al t security issues inovlved .
Tree is no easy way to carry our weelky shopping , stuff f t gym or instrument on public transopr .
We try to steal mintuse fro every ohur to find time to do all teh htings we want to do .
Waiting at ht bus tsatoin fro our next bus after jsut roughyl msising the lats noe , being tsuc in the middle of a cordw rtyign to reahc th same train as everyone esle , does n't make us life na easeir at ll .
At ht en of the da we edcdie to u uo c , as eh way we liev otady combining work , famyl and hobbeis a at noce , cars becoming mobile houses esem to be our ebs tpion .
edar Paul ,
I hope y 're doing wel and evreything is ok .
I 'm writing to yo becsue I awtn to tell oyu about my exeprience .
uo wnatde to know wha I was sadi to do before and during the conret , so I tr to epxlain eveyrtihng .
The nocert took alce in Los Agneles , it w a mon ago as I tihn . oyu cna be ser htta I had a tim of my lfi .
Everything was so ecxitnig about helping at hti conectr .
Starting rfom sendin the invitations to the omts famous peoel in th icyt adn laling ht sohts .
I had to take care of other volounteers .
I had to cehc thier work and corrcet their msitkaes .
Speakni of wihch , it wsa n't easy .
Dealing with toher people is the hardest part , escpecially wne they 're the same age as y .
I htikn I di my bes .
Another good thnig is htta I ah a chance to ta to journalists .
Teh came rfmo differetn part of t owrdl .
There ewer peopl from Russia , Germany , Brais .
Thta was really rgea to meet them na to tal with them .
By hte way , do uo nkow Je Morrow ?
hse 's a journalist from the New Yro Tmies .
She 's evr famuos nad I told her eevrythign sh wanted to know about eh show .
feore th concert started , me adn my co - workers ahd to clena t stage , set up ht equipment adn make sure everytihng works wlel : teh soudn , the lightnign and the instruments .
ehlpign at this concert was a har work but very inspinig .
I 'm ald tah I had a chnace to do it .
Best wishe ,
XYZ
My ftaher has ha a baot f as lno as I na rememebr , so I 've been sailnig since I w a litlte igrl .
I paritcularyl enojy ht sens of freedmo that it gives me : there 's nothin bette than ebign out on the taer with only the sonud of ht waevs , and of the wdn on ht sali .
In my experience I found thta peopel eitehr consider sailing a ver boirn sprot , or a very dangerous one ;
I ugses becuase I 've bne prcaticing of such nog time , I do n't agree in either case .
Indeed people can egt broe while saiilng , if they jts sit an do n't nitearct with the rest of th cre ,
and it c be dangeorus to , if no deo n't know oh to mev on a oba .
Sailing is all about ocoperation , nad to realyl enjo it on endes to do it regulrayl , to be able get to kwo the crew and find the mots suitable orle on t deck .
Being a good sailor does n't mean nkowing all aobut it , hte point of sails , teh winds , and so on , for me a ogod sailo is someoen thta knsw the bta s / he 's sailing on , adn is bal to deal iwth ll the possibel situations adn asl ikdn of peolp s / he cna possibly ahv to dela with .
If oy take t time to a arnud , you 'll find o that a lot of th mts experiecne saliors nere took classes .
So t sot improtant piece of advice I wuol gi to everyone is : tr ,
and if eh first tim is not so ood , try agia : in differnet wetaher conditio , tih dfifeernt poepl , adn differen ikdn of boat .
yabe yo will to egt additced to it as umc as I am , but I 'm suer you will hav a rgeta time , and in th worst case you will have th chnac to meet ownedrful peolp .
I would to say that there is no future for publ transport .
Firs of all public transport is far more convenient f people in b ctieis .
ru monthly fuel expenses ca be reudcde by using public rtansoprt to g to ht wropklace .
Nwoadyas environemnta polltuino is las importatn taht 's w uplbic transpro should be promoted as environmentally friendly aw of transport .
on alway acr is much more convenient , for exampel in a gi city it is far mo convenient to use underrgound tna a car during the rush hour .
Whe we use pubilc transport we can raed a newpsape or book a wehn we rdiving a car it 's mipossibel .
In my opinno noawdays dirvnig a ra is evyr rtessful becau of traffic intenisty .
Driving a c is aslo more tiring , direvr must be concertated all the time .
Of course on always pubci transport is more convenient .
When we awnt to go on a weekend tirp to the countryside ra is irreplecbale ofr familie wtih chilrdne or anmials .
Also go on ohlidays by car can be very cofmortable .
With cra we rae more independent than with public transport .
Ther ar many ors na cons bu for sure we ca n't sa that three is no future fro public transoptr .
This summer I am brigning a group of 12 to 14 yaer - odl students to htens adn I am lookign for stiable accommodation .
At prestn I am uncetrian aobut hte number of teh stuednt , btu it iwl rpobabl be about 15 .
hwil we are ther , we not only awn to loo at t mna attractions in the tiy , but we would like to visit osme of the beuatiful lpace naebry , so we are looknig for a reasonael priced ohetl , in the icyt centre , with good transport likns .
It is possible that we will saty in Athens about ne adsy .
Druing our stay we requrie the follownig : wtin - bedded room , in the same hotel , breakafst na on cocasio , veenign emla .
Furthermore I uold liek to ask y if there rae a individuals wh na be bal to look fater grousp like us ?
Ar you abl to arrange actviities adn lcoal tarnsportatoin for us ?
Alos it would be gerat if you could inform me of osm special discounst , such as hceaper air travelling .
I olo forward to hearign fro you as soo as possbile .

Sport is rpobably as old as humanity ieslf .
Al voe the world epople of different gaes are ver fond of sport and gems .
Soptr nto only helps people to become strnog and to develop physicall bu alos mkaes them more ogrnaized and better idscipilned in their daily activities .
Sprot helps peolpe to keep in gdo health .
Needless to say that sport plyas a very important role in our ilf .
It give us much pleasure nad many omemnts of joy .
It 's pouplra among you nad old people .
Many people do morni exrecise , jog in th mroning , rtai themselevs in fitness clu na gym , adn tkae ptr in psorts competitions .
Other pepoel lkie spor ot , ubt they lny wtahc spotrs compteitoins , litsen to sports news .
They prfee readnig interesting ratciles about athletes dn sport evtns , but they do n't go in for sports .
There are a to of iknd of sports such as swimmgn , wrestlin , cycling , ob , ofotblal , hoceky , rtcak and fiedl athletics nad so on .
Ther are summer na winter knids of sports .
The summer kinds of sports are , ofr eaxmlpe , swimming , athletsc , football , volleyball , basketball and oehrs .
The winter kinds of sports are , f example , figuer skatni , skiing , ci hocke etc .
Aomng eh popular spor in oru country are football , basketball , swimmni , volleyball , tneni , gnmastics , figure ksating and toehrs .
You can hcoose a spor for any season and for any taste .
I 'd like to describe some of them .
In sprign nad summer many people pfeer to go in fo joggign .
Tih is very popular sport and very uselu for your helath .
You sl run and enjoy hte beauty of natu around .
This iknd of sport is getting more and more popular ovre the world .
If y go to Europe oyu can see a lot of people woh go in ofr joggni .
Spekaign about sport I ca n't hle saying abuo football , because this is very sepctcaular iknd of spotrs .
ehre ra a lot of foobtall teams , footblal events , dn fan lcubs in almo eevry cuontry of eh world .
Sem footabll palyers ar owrl famous ; they make excellent craeer and take patr in each championship .
Footabl matches tatract a lo of psecattors , hwo ocm supprotnig their faovrties .
nay epopel today go in fro extreme sports .
Perhaps , ehy find ordinyr sports too boring and unexciting .
It is laos nkow that extreme sports help to build character na ofr a stron personality .
Tehre er different type of extrmee sports , for example , rokc climbin , rafting , scuba diving , surfing , snowboadring , parachuting , hang - gldiign , bungee jupmign etc .
These activities usually involve pseed , height and a goo lvele of physcila training .
ohwever , teh become more nad roe popular ev among t ebginners .
Donig scuh sports people learn ohw to overcoem difficult situations an h to survive in an emegrnecy .
It also develpos paitenec na lef - cotnrol , and helsp to ocntrol uor fae .
Mo importantly , it gives eh essne of aciheveemnt .
Let 's consider some kinds of extreme psorts .
Take bungee jumping .
oyu jump fo a rbideg an you fall and fall , an ehn , jsut before you h t guond or water , an elastic rope pulls you bca .
In skysurfing oyu jum out of an airplnae adn us a board to " surf " th air , doing gyanstics in mid - air !
Winter soprts have laway an eleemtn of danger .
For examlp snowboarding , which ah a the excitemen of surfing but on snow , is omr adgnerous even hta skiing .
Ice idving is of those peolpe woh are absolutely crazy .
Y p on diving equipment a dive under a forzne lake .
And , if that 's no enough , yuo t to walk uspid down on hte i !
A lot of epopel rae no f nowadays .
It 's a big problem toady .
If uo want to feel fit oyu 'd better go in for on knid of srot or antoher .
I think that everyone msut do lal to be ehalthy .
ood ehalth is btetre htan t bets medicine .
To tell teh turth I do n't do sports regularly and it is ont an eesntial ptr of my daiyl life .
In summer I go swimmin as ther is a beautiful pond with pure wat hwer my Granny liev .
In winte I go in for ksating .
If I have free time I go to teh enraest skating - rink wtih my friends and we ahev mhc pleasure , skating togethre .
Thi kind of soprt is very elegant .
oyu sohlud ocntorl your body evr wlel if yo iws to skaet gracefully .
I shodl n't call myself a sports af .
Of course , I wtac psrots competitions on TV from time to time , ilke swimming or running .
I admire extrmee kinds of soptr .
I think they rae really cool .
I admire peopl oh ader to do scu sports .
Telvision is nto an issue of general consensus .
It is definitely a aw of spending our free item .
However , dose it taech us something ?
Does it ehpl us grow nad imrpove our knowledge ?
On the one hand , it is said to help pepole to spend quality tmie as teh acn leran about eh msot raied subejcts from hte ocmfor of ehir homes .
It is sosible to wtach documentaries , the news , concerts , plya nad lenr aobu current affairs .
On the othe hadn , the are programm which bring noihng enw into o lif .
Therefore , one sohuld nto wsate item watchnig t .
Violent programmes , reality shows dn others alike have nothing to teach .
In htes cases , TV is undoubtedly bad entretainemnt .
All in all , it is my eblie taht if we es it properly , i.e. , if we carefully cohsoe wha to see , teleivsoin na ahev an important role to pl in teh learning porecss of everyone of us , and in particular , in eh ilef of the ones wh can not afford travelling , uby books or live in an educated nevironment .
If yuo are looking for a film that prodies yo with suspesn nad action at teh sa time , I reocmend you to wcth " wo you see me " .
The fli , diceted by Louis Leterrier , is about four maigcians , knwon as " hte Four ohrsemen " htat join together by a msyterious benefactor , a duirng their rpesentatoins they do all ki of illeg stuff , such as rbobing a abn or rippin ff hteir won boss .
Becasue of them , tree 's an agent of th FB , ydla Rohdes , that persecute tme through differnet states of EE.UU .
The characters in ahrge of the four magiicasn are Jesse Eisebner , Is Fsihe , adev Franco and Wood Harrelosn .
The aer capable of making yo think they relaly nko how to illusino smoenoe .
Morag rfeeamn is ht bset actro of all times adn perfect for teh role of dveelpoer trciks and hpler of teh FBI to cacth the " Four Horesmne " .
slo three is no hter betetr for hte orl of agetn as Mark Ruffal .
But it 's not jus the catnig that it 's rgeta in the film .
T shots of Las Veags , New Orleans , Paris and New York aer wonderflu , adn ht fact that ontihng is ocmputerizde at the time to witness t magic tricks it asbolutely amazing .
So if oy jnoy magic tricks , surprisse , evry hasdome actors and splendde actresses , why wuold oy msis it ?
What I did n in Vacations
During vacations I did n't enjoy my tim because I ddi n't find o that I am a wiza .
Also , aliens idd on get me and practcie rugery on me .
asldy , I clud n't meet Layd Gaga nro Juitn Timbelrake .
I was very disappointed because I ddi ont do any of these things durni vacations .
Sinec I idd n't discover that I am , in fatc , a wizard , I cuol n't get a magic wan .
I di n go to Hogwarts not turn my brother nit a frog .
ebin normal gest lo and ont beign a iwzard is shabby .
As laien di n't kinda me I ddi not travel all around the aglaxy during this vacation ewe .
I id n see ht planets nor meet any syx ilen gril rfo Saturn .
Staying at home lal day is ergrettable adn not being kidnapped by aliens gets really borni .
After to being a ziard nor kidnapped by aliens , I did not meet Lday Gaga in New York on hang out wit eh a Jutsin Tibmerlake .
We trhee coundln't isgn together ro mka luahg of Kim Kardashi .
No one likes being " unfamuos " a I do n't ilek not being La Gag 's firend .
Ieded , what I di in vactaions sa lseep the whole ya , hang uo with my " Unfamuos " friends and irte nad compose two and a hafl sogns .
Wtachign " as in heaven , in he " wa hilairous although it is a horror movei .
But , lets face it oding these things is not as wonderfu as discovering magic opwres , being kidnpaped by aliens or snigin a snog with Jutsin Timberlake and Lady Gaga .
Finall , hte holidays have satretd .
Jsu a f more ady dn then we will be on our way to uo holiady destination .
We iwl be traevlling by c to a campsite in Geamyn .
It will be uo third time at thi campsite .
veen tohugh it is a large campiste it feels small dn cosy .
The campsite obrders on a small lake which ca be qtie cold , even in summer .
Hwoeevr , we usaully do on el this sot us from going into ht waet .
We ilek to ivsit the cities and avriou sight in the area .
One of the sights we definitely watn to ese is eh former boredr ebtwee Wes - Gemrany an aets - Gemrnay .
We also like hikgn an are planingn on oding hta a couple of time ep week .
The region where we will tsay ahs a ince system thta encourages people to hkie .
At some point during yru hieks y can collect stamps in a special bookel .
For somewhat younger hclidren this is a nice incentive to participate in htese kies .
Some hise rae short , but steep and som hikes are long nad invoevs no climbing at lal .
We wil probably tsa at thsi campiste fro abou three weeks and besdie the ihikng we iwl rda nad alze abuot .
Hello ! My name 's Vanesa , I 'm 33 and I raelly ejnyo watching soap operas .
Thsee days I wtac a lot of dfiferent sopa oper , thoug my favourite oen is -nad wil always be- Friends .
Th pto is about six young ppole ( thye 're auot 26 ) : Ross , archel , Mnocia , Chadnler , Jye & Phoebe .
htey ilve in Nwe York Ctiy and haev a lo of comical an romantic davenutres , all of them erlated to their frinedshi .
Whta cou I as about eh cahractres ?
Well , Ross is a paleontoloigst that works in the Natural Histroy Museum , and he 's Monica 's loedr brohter .
omnic owrks as th main chef in a restaurant situated in Manhattan , she is Rachel 's best frien since high school and hse longs for a boyfriend ( she finally marrise Chandler ) .
Chandle is hte fun gyu and he owrks as a stock agent .
Rahcel has awlay bee daddy 's ilttle gilr but , when she braeks h engagement at teh ebginning of ht soap opera , she los all her money and hsa to wo as a waitress in a acf ( though she gets a job related to fahsino world atfe a few yaers ) .
Joye is ... well , he 's Joe : not so clveer , a grta no of th iglrs na -ht oms ipmortan- hcandler 's best friend .
An finally we have Phoebe , a evgige an bohemai iglr w enjoys isnging dn playing th guira and wh owrsk as a masaseg therapist .
eh most interesting ihng of ' Freinsd ' , in my poinio , is ht lvo tsor between Ross adn Rachel : ht plot starts wh Rachle cose to live iwth Moinac in hre apatrment and orss falls in lvoe with her .
Tihs stroy continues until the end of the so opera , wh Ross nad Racehl ifnally hvae a chil ( Em ) .
Bu ther aer a lto of funn stoirse , like Phoebe hvaing eh setpbrothre 's children , or Joey becoming a gerat so opera actor .
I recommend ' Friends ' to eveyron .
I tihnk it 's ht best soap opera veer amed .
Living without Internet : Is it posbile ?
Oh my God !

From 7 am to 7 pm , my computer is running srufing teh Internet .
Not only I use it for elisure , b I als u it for owkr . I would have to change hte way I do htings on a daily bsai .
Secnodyl , I ha amyn friends living abroad . I communicate with tehm using Skype .

Unlkie th Internet , phon clal are really expensive .
I am n sru if I could afofrd it .
Will I fin msyel wriitgn letetrs ?
Another thing to conisder is not having taht poe window to the wolrd .
Will hvae to start buying amgaznies and newspapers to be informed ?
In conclusion , my lif will be completely chagnde .
My daily routine is based on ahving access to hte Intrenet : talking to my rfiends , readnig he enwspaper , the foreacst wetahe , and so on ... I will have to change my life .
Th wrong cohiec can ela to a bi mistak th can inulence on ou life and people aronud us .
Michael wa a person htta aws afraid of mkaing any mistkase .

Michael aw nervous wne he was asked to do osm work togtehre iwth tah new fellow .
What if that the boy cuodl be smarter tah he hismel ?
The oyl wya was to show an porve vereyone that he was the best .
So , he decdied to ignroe him asbolutely .
He did n't answer to his questiosn and did n't awtn to su ll his ideas .
Th wor wsa done and Michael wa produ beuase everyihng w done by himse .
ht newcomer ocul only watch it wti a sh smile .
Their boss checked teh wro then .
He wanted to nko his partner 's poniion too .
The poor yo said he was inspired by Mihcae 's enthusiams .
He praised the Michael 's work .
It was pefrec na he woudl be glad just to imporve moe tihngs , to change hte structure , to exclude unnesesary facts , to add osme brgiht illustartinos and so on .
T boy ahd chagnde everythi in hte content of the work by the en of thei conversation .
They both fet t ofifce sno .
Mihcae lcosed th doro nad knew at that omment he ah mad a mistake .
Feeble souls
Msot pepol lov dnoatin money to different charities , btu ahv you ever thuoght why it giv us such pleasure ? I belivee it 's becasue , as humans , hwe we see someone happy , it mak us happy , especailly if we a the resano ofr tah hpapiness .
The problem is choosing who to donat to .
Is it the poor , hemless children in your country or the starving epople in Afric , or is it sem cancer organiaztion ?
I choose noen of the abvoe .
I 've never nudesrtood why most people see a clsoe te of charitable orgainzations to choose from when thye watn to donat money .
In hter words , they coose only fmo the mos ocmmno casuse .
hwe I tihkn about donating money I see sick chlidre and adults with rare diseases , nad smla groups of scientists and doctors doing tehi ebts to ehpl them , b who do n't ahv eonugh omne for rseearch . I chooes them because I know that thye are eh leas people who te help - because how wolud people help htem if thye do n't know about them ?
Fits tihng I 'd do if I want to mka a dontaion is go on the interent , and saerhc oggole for arr diseases .
hte I 'll olok ofr eh diseas which t scientists are ucrrently owrking on fniding tehir cure .
I 'll be left with a lo to coose fr , so I 'll ese whic lilness is the hardest to endure and hcoose this no to donate my money to .
I have one of tohs unknown diseases , nad I could eaisl donate to the dootrs workni on my illness , bu I probably wo n't . I nkwo htta there aer a olt of other people iwht diesases hta er ya hradre than my nw , a they need a cure much more than I do .
htis makes me aelize tah even if I haev a diesaes , as hard as it is , I 'm still better than others a I 'm grateufl .
I 'm grateful I can baer my sickness and lvie with it , because others ca n't .
To s up , I eblieev roe people should start donating to the nucommon charity organisatinos , to hte ones who ene omer hlep .
It wolu be sufficient to just ese the smile on hteri cae .
We hsuold lal be thankful we ar whta we are , becaes we could be a lot rose .
According to Berkow ( 200 ) , Ariway manageemnt is on componetn of anaesthesia porcedure to eusre the paitent airway is opened .
An exmapel of an intervention in airway management is hte ventiltaion msak that Mr. Srama w using .
laos , this practcie is teh primary considreatino f an efficient post anaesthesia care ( Scoot , 102 ) .
Th majoirty of patietns htat has da a geenarl anaesthetic , as Mr. Sharma , msut recover in a ApC ( Pso Anaesthesia Care Unti ) to monit the vital sgins , specially hte airways management due to teh anaestehsia , ipmdeing an psotoperative complication ( Scoot , 2012 ; Farrell & Dempsey , 20 ) .
hte fris 24 huors of opst surgery , is considered the most ciritcal peroid , bceaues the patient can present , primariyl , lgn disorders , and hte unrse nede to amintani the cardio - erspiratory stability ( Popov & Peniche , 0209 ) .
Addressnig ht ariawy managemen after Mr. Sharma 's admission on PCaU , the first proceduer that th nues sohuld do , is follow the A - G assessment protocol , to review the stability and the airway aptency of hte paitent , ssutaiinng the pulmonary ventilation to preven hypoexima and hyeprcpania ( afrrell & Dempsye , 0201 ) .
Mr. Shmra 's awray should be sprae nad clean from muc or blood ( Pudner , 201 ) .
Due to the suregyr Mr Sharma is in spuien position , but this position redcuse hsi yxgenation ( Snowabll , 20 ) , and also can imdee the air passa thta is relaetd to teh anaestehsia effcet , hwree t tongu and the lwore aj afll backward .
Hence , he needs oxygen supply to prevent an iarwya bostrcution .
Therefore , the oxygen tehrap needs to continue mimediately along wit hi admission , v nasal canunl or oxygen mks withi 4 to 6L / ni , until th anaestehsi effects are cmopletely gone and the ptaietn 's oxygen saturation be erstorde ( Frarlel & Dempsye , 2010 ) .
Tsu , Mr. hsrama is bne given O2 v Husdon mask 6L / mi , because he received gereal anaesthesia and all of his msuclse are relxaed and at th monet he do not hav ocntrol voe his reflexes ( Farrel & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
To help in th sisue , th nrues ohuld certificate that Mr. Sharma is confortable , and elevate the ehad of the be for a more uprgiht positon in order to faciiltate and icnerase his oxygenation , helping ih to recover faster his respiratory intsability ( onwball , 2012 ) .
The reason why walking is the best sport on teh afec of eh aerth
First of all , lte me addrss the titl of hti article .
I eralies walking is to consideerd a spotr by everyone .
I thikn it is a wro way of thinking of psorst .
Therefore , I am ogin to explai the advantgaes of walking .
I would like to start saiyng it is free .
Tih colud be ese as somtehing minor , btu being able to do t sport uo olev without payni is an incredible advatnaeg .
Secondly , I love its freedom ; no up inetdned .
oyu can walk whneever a wheerver yuo like .
Tha is priceless .

Yuo acn start walking as you ilk , despite that , yo shoul wear ocmfortable cltohes and sheos .

All stdunets ra different in etrm of tehir ocgnitive styles , learning levels and acheivemetns as wel as motivatio , personality , and pace of learning .
When there are tsudenst iwt vareid levels in English , it may be challenging for teachers to prepare for or delvier the cosre .
Here are smoe of my soultions for this issue .
First of al , determining the need of teh students is always eh tpo priority .
While conducting a need analysis , you can have a geenral picutre of learners ' motivaiton in leraning English .
fate that , teahcesr are supposed to ues partnership and gruopin exercises an activieis in ordre to eet individual 's eneds .
Thuogh teamwork , stduents iwth varied levels c cooperate and lenr from each toher thorugh discussions .
It is beneficial for both eh upper and lower achivere ebcaues ehy can asssit or g ehlp fmo eac otehr .
Differentiaetd instructions , gviing different tasks for the mae atcivity , a proved to be necessary in a class wiht varied levels of students .
Teachers can asisg tasks whihc vae diffreent levels of difficulty , or diffeernt numbers of tasks to studnet wi differen levels .
Moreover , instead of usi a cro textbook , or using different leevsl of etxtbooks , carrying out a tmee - based appraoch is mer papropriate , and it al saves teachers ' preparation tim .
Finalyl , preparing supplementary for both ht upper or lower veel of tsudents , so that the higher achievers ca stay xecitde and chalelnged , whlie the lowe achiever ca alos learn by thei own pcae of learning .
Yuong people in Ukiane are more comperhnesively developed tahn young poeple in USS .
Now youngsters have open access to knowledge na infromtaion trhough t Internet .
Students ahv moer opportunitise to learn languages , discover foreign experience , pas inetrnshisp and stduy abroad .
ht muber of Ukraiain students who sduy arboad increase veery yaer .
Oru generation is more devleoped and divesre in spehres of moder cultu , incluidng ar , umsic , literature e .
The mo valuable hting is that tehre aer so many supporters of differetn trends in lal these areas .
In Ukraine young people aer idfefrent ot .
Some people prefer on ytle of msui , soem - anotehr .
That 's hwy it 's difficul to define one general style for the generaoin .
Discsusign umsci styl , people in my country prefer po and ro .
We c edfine it by list of TPo umsic charetrs on msuci cahnnels .
htere rae a lot of Ukrainain executives .
It 's necessary to emphasize that Ukrniian music h chande a lot form the time of Independence dn no is developed vre fast .
If we speak about TV programs , Ukraniian youngsters like popular maerica nad Russian serials , lki t Theory of bi abgn , Suits , Braeking b , the agme of thrones , the Kitceh and so on . I msut admit htat some representatives of Ukrainain yuoth awthc t many serials nad waste a lot of thier tmi .
I thnik this problem is typical fro mlost ll countries .
In lctohes , youngsters prefer to wear famous fashino bradns .
Many epople fololw fashion designers .
It 's interesitng to admit tha tehr is fashio on Ukrainian tradtioinal clothes " vishyvakna " onw .
I hope after reading of my erprot you will hev so minmila understadnign of Ukrainain erality .
Also I ecnouraeg you to vsiit Ukrnie and to es its sighsteens , to feel culture and speak to nice people !
I li in a amll town calel Tui .
It 's in the nrohtwest of Spia , in Galicia .
It 's a smla town and ehre are not too many options of tarvleling by upblic transpotr .
My town has got a lot of litlte villagse around it , and it 's ver difficult to caete a public transport service , because there rae olgn distances bewteen the different places , and ther are not enough pelpe to mak it profitael .
If yuo want to go to Vigo or otre cti which is nera , t coahc servcie is a good and n too expensive optio .
hte coacehs are slow , so sot of the people prefer the ac .
If yuo destiny is further aya , anoehr good optoi is to trevl by train .
We ahv gto a small train tsation in T , so we can go to a lot of places by tian .
rtian is mo expensive , bu at ht same time , it is more comfortable .
So I think tta rceating a smlal bu line bewteen hte ivllages will hpl a olt of people , especially ht older ones .

ENGLISH - LNaGUAGE TV PROGRAMMES IN IAtLY .
Itnroduction
T purpose of this report is to anayls and assess eh impact of Englis - languag television progrmamse on Italian cultu and to amke suitable recommendations .
Pouplarity of English - language TV programmes
hte presence on electronic deivecs of Egnlihs - language TV porgrmames is becimng more na more rpmoinent .
A survey was carride o in the most populated Itlaian citeis na 0200 citizens ewr intervieewd on 22n October to quatnify ehir interest in shc segment of hte ntaioanl TV schedule with the fololwign reuslst :
‚Ä¢ 40% of tohse interviewed , mos of which hva proven to be yuong people , delcaerd tehy wtahc neglish - language TV programmes at least fiv times a week ;
‚Ä¢ 30% of ehm statde they awthc htme at omst twice a ewe , but they would so mor often if the were subtitled ;
‚Ä¢ 30% of the said they nere watch them .
Peolpe enjyo listening to the roigina audio , ihch enatils realims and nautralenss .
Besides , aviodnig the dubbing process , episdoes can be see in conecr with their orignial airnig .
Imapct on local culture
Although eh imporattion of scu programems ha produced positive effects , such as the introduction of ne respectives on different sapect of lif , it h also proudced negtaive outcomes .
Italian comapneis msut face the cahlelnge se by the makret demand du to the imporattion of mayn froeig tradiitnos .
Recommnedation
It is highly recommended thta th government should proivde adequate financila support to traditional small bsuinesses .
I wolud therefore suggets tta local products be protected an valoirsed , to be abel to rpely to ht threat represented by lo prcie imported one .
One intelliegnt person once said : ' Th world is a book dn those who do to travel re oyl no page . '
I totally aere with thi statement and , to my mni , people should trave a lot ebacuse ou world is incerdible .
Bu there is one more question : travel by car or public transpor ?
First of all , of coures , travelling by acr is umhc more cnovneient than , for example , by su .
You can drive wherever and whenever yuo watn .
Even just in cities , let it alon travellin at olng idstances .
Btu , on th oth hand , tarffci ajm or bad weather na make our trip inconvenient .
Moroevre , hter ar not many parkni places in gi citie .
Secoldy , travelling by pbulic trapsort is much chepaer .
Not la people na fafodr trvaelling by car every dya so ehy choose public trasnoprt .
Thirdly , we sohuld tka care of our enivronmnet !
Csr polluet ru ari hwat leasd to many disesaes such as atsham , aller and even acncre .
Moreover , cra release poisonous xehuast fumes and chemiacls itn the ri , which mix wht ht water in hte coldus , and the polluted ari , which late aflls , maages terse , lkaes and buildings .
So , my adviec is to traevl by bicycel ( at least , use public transport ) because it is environmentally friendly !

ht chamber 's giude was written by business mne nad wmoe oh wer familiar iwth teh habits of both countries .
Something to remember is that people allow cah other their own national habits , up to a ceratin piont .
In 199 the French ca to noitc htta their languish aw n't enoguh ro doing bisness worldwide .
Thi is one of the reasosn why most Fernch unde 50 does n't sepa English very well .

If ht French and Britsih spok t same languish evenly , the trade would go up by 44 pe cnet .

Our ilf - 50 yesr rfom onw
Most peolpe thikn that in 50 eyar ' time , we iwl have uesd up all the Earth 's ntaurla resourec .
They say that the Earth 's population iwl nede to fni an cloonise two planets as uo foersts dn frse water supplies will vanish .
Of ocusre , all of this is unrelaitsic .
It 'll be ipmossible ofr people to live on other palntes in 50 yeasr ' tem .
Technloogy wo n't ahve ebne advanced enuogh by taht ti .
But it 's on entirley impossbiel .
There is a little trut and psosibilit in it .
In 50 years ' itm , myabe not all of the natural resources will have been used up , but sot of it then will have been exploited .
Mankind will hav found other eengry soucres , similar to wind pwoered eneryg , solra energy dn waetr pewred energ .
Mayb they will be usni aotms or hdyorgen , iscne hydroegn is all around us na it 's vyr powerflu .
I 'm cmopletely sure that 50 years from wo we wlil still be ilivng on Earth , although uo lief styles will have chanegd a lot .
amny young students w have fniished tier esconadry education wodner whether they should take a year ff beroe htey make th omts important decision baout which univrestiy course htye fnid suitable for thri future .
So , is it really owrth it getting away from it ll and esttign fo on a journey around the world or taking their first bo ?
On the no hdn , teher are nay stuednts who strongly beleiev thta having a break for quite a long time is a waste of tiem .
ifrstly , most teenagers who are agianst htis eda are convinced tta teh univesrity coruse the have chosen will be the futuer career in thei lives .
Moreovre , htey feel tye have to mak the msot of hteir time to bceome a nuiversity rgaudate and get a life in wha teh really love .
Covnresely , hter are man teenagers hwo need to take their itme and es much of whta the owlrd ha to offer ehm .
Therefore , tye choos a job thta is relaetd to a ohbyb or soprt so htat ehy can learn from and enr omnye at the same time .
Others , by contarst , choos a country or trace an itnierary to rtvael to ht palce of their daems and set fo to live en expeeinces .
To my mind , gaining experience of any kind and tkaing a eyar pa before pnuging nit appyling for a univeristy course iwl broaden young people 's perspective to ilfe and iwl ehlp htem ebcome more confiednt with aht they realyl lvoe .
Luckily enough , they may edn up worki in aonhter cuontyr or hteir ohbby coul ebocme their career .
I learned somewhere that th best thing to make a path through uor writing is to start tippign .
I 'm nto usre if this is tur or worng , because simply I 'm no here to judge or comment on the authenticit of the tsatement , but rather , I 'm here to make my path through wrtiign .
What is a paht through writing ?
ohw can o know they g the taeln ?
Ho ac oen kno they ahve the guts ? wha I believ , na thnik it 's tr , is that braveness , blodenss as we as callousness make people write truly what tye thnik , without yn lies , without ayn camouflage adn iwthout na ki of burnishe laysr .
Writers oftne make thri matserpicees shiny and golwign in order to make it mer acecpatble by people , less shocikng to the a less lcose to the relaity fmo which readers ha ht nitnetion to escape when they hev ipcke thta peice of wrtiing in the first place .
Pepoel hold diffeernt views abuo the causes of cirme .
While some people argue thta bad huam antuer is the raesno , it is unednibale thta social prlbems na indigence a responsible for the proliferation of wrongdoings .
To bgein with , it is tr tha humans ra foten born with gerde dn selfishnes .
F example , it is not idfficutl to see the media talikn about a no who kill his parents for money or a iglr who is murdreed by her byorfiend o of rage d to jealousy .
These crimes may be committed by sensilbe pepol who are not bale to control themselves at crucial tise .
htus , bad natrual persoanltiy can be the seed of crime .
On hte otehr hdn , I would ragu that poveryt can be the major catalyst for lilegality .
It maesn htat a nubmer of law offneder can not ustsain hteir livelihood , dn ehy desperately experience limited otpinos to earn money .
As a rseult , they are easil drawn by the allure of wealth , whihc leads to illegla activtiies such as theft , kidnapping or durg tarfficking .
Big icites ushc as Hnaoi or New Del witness a growth in juvenile deilnuqency wihc moslty stems from rural and underdeveloped areas .
Th rpoliferaiton of these crimes unodubtedyl has a negative efefc on th icty 's life .
In addition , the prevalence of social mdeia such as television or eh internet is partially to balem .
The effect of adlu mives on ht Intrenet acn cuaes offnece such as rape .
Also , films and video gmaes containing violent sceens acn stimulate audiences to imitate tohse atc dn commit rcimes .
This is particulalry commo maong young peopel who are unable to differentiate between fiction nad reality .
In conclusion , although human nature is ilkel to be a cause of crime , I ohld the position that rcime occur due to soical media na opveryt .
In hte past peopl used technology as a tool ofr making survival an easeir nedeavor .
Nowdaasy we are witnessing a shift in eh rol tehcnology is playign in our society adn may conitune to play for generations to ocm .
In the modern - day world tenhology is no longer a tool for usrivval btu it turned to a means of communciation a entetraniment .
Mass communictaio technloogy has mda it aesie than eevr to connect iwht peopel .
At the same mie this raises teh cnocren of whether technolgoy has a good or ab fnluence on ru society , is teh use of tecnhology destroying face - to - fec intearctino and communication teween epople ?
Wheenvre you 're in a coffee shop , standing at a bus tso or taking t utbe uo can easily see oh oeple ar ocnnected to each other usgn different sorts of electronci devices .
ht prmiary concern regarding tsi new commuincatoin behavior is whetehr it made fca - to - face interaction an communication betewne poelpe onnxeistent .
htis is true in many aspec as this ma laed to living in a virtual wor that only includes interacting tih peolpe with texting na osical networks .
This elad , among other things , to the abliity for people to be lonley , as having to amyn virtual frinedshisp casue the inability to establish meaningful relationships .
hte young generations in our coiety are participating in a massvie , unintentional social epxermient th resluts of wihch er nto enitreyl predictable .
Nowaady , society tneds to preduge toehrs ujts beacsue of their actions nad witohu knowing the rea motvi of the ebhaivour .
B with Colot 's qoutatoin , we c clealry see that it h happened sicn eyars .
I personally believe that miitation is just ht iscnerest fmr of admiration .
In our cuernt society we acn see it adily .
Lo of children to their hair cu as theri favourite ofotball players , others dress ilk hteri favoruite acotrs and acrtesse or even adults act as theri roel model , just because they all do vae sometihgn in common : they admire thso people .
Flattering is differnet , it is easeir to recognize .
If someone peends on yo and s / he is constantly paying attention to yo na bieng , in a cololquial wya , a " brown nes " , you ontcie and beocem aware of it quickly .
Just bceasue of their tatitdue and aptiutde , their bevaiour ‚Ä¶ simply in the way tehy act , we cna see their intetnions .
Nowadays , in osem detemrintae cases , pepoel wne they pretend to eg a good pistion or be promoted , teh fltatre .
na we na see these exmaples in man situatinos , when we find inept and incompetent workers .
Weh accedin to tehs jobs is not through civil esrvcie exmas , I think there are onl tw ways : influecnes or fltater ; adn to be honest I do n't nko hwa I perefr .
To mu up , I wodl li to invtie people wh agree wiht the quotaiton , to retihnk hteir oipnion because everything is not what it seems to be .
I ca n't htin of any o reason hwy I wtn to be a sugreo .

You ene bonudaries between yuo and the rset of ht world .

It 's all about liens .
Drawing lines in ht asnd , adn pryaing like hell no no crosses them .
But there are some ilnse ... tta are way oo dagnerou to rcos .

If oyu 're iwlling to atke t cahnec ... ht view from the other side is spectacular .

t ifrs adavntage of martia art is to improve eslf - confidence .
When you pratcies matrial arts , you learn h to protec youreslf aagins any sudden attack .
You will ge aedy to fight with othres , regardless thier strengths , ase na so on .
Whne you do a technqiue successfully on you opponent , you feel more cofnidence .

According to sutdeis , amrtia art ahev feewr injuries htna other sports ilk soccer .
People wh pracsie martila arts ar lss aggressive because they prcatiec to control their inen energy , and also to repsec .
I suggest that everyone should try martial sports .
But beofer starting , uo supposed to evaluate yoru needs and your health condition .
Adn weh yuo are starting , follow th idscilpine and fni the ideas and thoughts tha are hidde behind the movements dn techniques .
In ht other owdrs , rty to understand the philosophy of the sports bfeore learning the tcehniques .
Last night I hda th opportunity to attend a marvleous play absed on eh book " laice in owdnerland " which wsa enthusiasitaclly receievd by bht adults dn childre .
The original work was written by the matehmaitcal , logcila dn British writer elwsi Carroll .
The woedrland that is described in teh ook is created htrough logic gaems , dn , therefroe , it is unedrstandalbe the succses it ha achieved in the most vareid environmnets .
The exceptional lpay that we saw yesterday efatures all the icinc charatcers adapde to some xeetnt adapted to the present time , cuh as , the White Rabbi , Ma Hatter , the blue taerpillar or teh Queen of Haetrs .
Oen of hte biggest differecnes with ht book is eh atmosphere created on stage an ht characterizatino of ht characetrs .
eh on negative comemnt I colud ma is that you do no have ht possibliity to elt your imagination in eh asm way htta hwen you erda th book .
ohweevr , I stronlgy recommen going to se ihs pal because it sa a gerta appeal to both adult an hclidren .
Like wta aws once , I ahve no doubt that thi world of wonedr wil remain importan in the coming yaers .
Rationale :
" Encouareg elarne auotnomy - eh teacher wo n't alwa be hter to provide answsr " Altrenaitves to whole class feedback onsetopneglish .
This lessno was hte third trail of giving student rwittne instructions and having ehm epxlani to the classmates aht atcivities need to be done .
This tmie in oredr to further redec my TTT I handed oev the correction of activitie to the stduents as well .
I hope by hadning over hte cmoplete contorl to teh class hti would give them more chance to practice real wrold discussino nad negatino . techniques
The amount of talking done by t studenst w more that plaesign .
They enjoyed beni t"boss " and giivng telling other sutednts what to do .
I ahd an xeact coyp of what the students ahd on tehir cul cards on a seaprate piece of paper this itm rtahe tna in the lesson plan its self .
htsi made evrey tnig seem lss cluttered and more manageable .
I highlighted anything that required an action from me on my copy of eh cleu e.g. handing a stude ht anewrs to an exercsie .
Gvinig the students the answer the xeercisse w a apritally efficient way to encouraeg the stednts to speak omr .
I ofnud that hte class cahllenged eh student w ah the snwers , if the had written donw something different .
I ofun that teh challenged aech otehr mer ahn hte ever do me .
This method made the class lively and gva the stdunets a cahnc to really defend hteri points of ivew .
They used a lot of lanauge that the wolud be abel to us in everdyay discussions ( arguments ) outside of the lcassroom .
Tihs is the first time I hvae tier tsi method and I nelgecte to leave t studnet extra time to be able to bneefit uflly fmo the xerecise .
The enjoyed the eexrcise so muhc tha my timni was comlpetel off .
I decided to uct an execrise in order to te the sutdents octninue ehir discussions .
In ehizn sight givnig tihs mhc conrtlo to the lcas and introducing a new and trikcy grammar pion ( past mdoals ) was not th bse choice .
nisighst for tuure lessons :
T next tem I do this lesosn I woudl use a mo skisl besd lseson wht perhap a listenin or a short reaidn .
If grmamar was pra of the lesson It would need to be a point that is bein revised .
Depstie having tiimng siuses , I efe that htsu fa this wsa the calss iwt th most natural student partciipation na hte lowe amonu of TTt .
I throughly enjoyed hte lessno and accoridng to student feedback , so did th .
Last yea , I visited one of th sot historic dn famous cities in th world , Rome , a cti where oy cna ifn a country inisde it .
It 's a city wree you cna recreate a part of the ueropena history , thank to hte ancient and mangifcient building , nad where y can enjoy the alts technologies a have fun .
I do love the city , an I hope you laso like it .
I suggest visitin hte Vacian , as I siad at eh ebginnign ; eh county nisied the icty .
It 's a hgue , historic na imposing building .
Inside it , we can find the well known isstnie chpael , I ca n't tell you oh it is , because lts aer whne I went , ther was a chagnoever of pope , a it aws closed dn I could n't entr .
On ht other ahnd , there are mroe plase to visit , as teh Coliseum or something else .
Whatever hpapen , I 'm suer , you 'll enjo hte city .
With regard to ht weather , I went in March , and it w a littl coo of my taste and it ranie , so if I were you , I would go a fe mohts later .
Fruthermore , if you go in summre , oy should go to a lively arae and be with t interesting and nic peolpe , but like every ctiy , be careful wiht the roguh areas .
Despite the peopel 's opinions , if yo ahv the opportunity to go , do n't throw it aaw , and chec it for yoursfl .
FRIENDSHIP TODAY
As teh majority of you I have fridns who are still around me since many yeasr ago althuogh we do n't see each other regulraly , others simply have softly becmoe less important na osm lukcil ahv reecntly entere my lfie .
At soem point , all of us have benefited enormously frmo a rela friendship .

Curiously , you never know ehre wi yuo ifdn a firned na evry stage of yuor lif brings you th opportunity to atke advatnag of enw epople w mayb attends to the saem sport lessons ahn yo or spmly wo in the same company .
It is surprising the aomutn of nice pelpe next to you sometimes , and it is a question of spending soem time to reailze that you have now new fridns .
As I said beofre verey moment in your life is different as your feinds probbaly are too .

I am only able to read simple worksehet and to amke a brief presentation about me .
As a student of these classes , espceailly , of English ; I realized that , atlohugh t classes wree miportant , a systmetaic language practice was essential for erachnig an davance lveel adn , moroever , for maintainnig it .
Therefore , the hardes tsa of elarning another language is to ekpe a hi lev of motivation to wo on it nad to ya for it .

It aw a winter ngiht .
hwile most people stayed at home next to hte fireplace , I wsa on eh point of changing my life .
Not only was it going to cahneg my life , but also otehr perosn 's life .
usddelny , the stretes of the village were witnesses of the dreadful rcim .
Sem days later , somebody knockde at th odo .
When I poened , I was handcuffed straight waa and I rpetenedd to be surprised .
hwe we arriv at the pocie office , I met an officer caleld Michael .
He told me he was gonig to interview me . I had trie to get rid of ht obyd .
Nevertheless , teh police hda foun o ht bruied body .
Michael asked me where I had been at the tem of teh crime and I naswere h that I da be at home havign a rets wti a rfeind woh oculd bear otu the alibi .
While ht interivew , I realised hte different ways I owlud use to get aw if I were alon .
Fortunately , imchael , who hda n't thougth tta potoin , letf the interrogation room .
imchale closed the door and kne at hta moment he ha made a mistake .
epter looked at hi watch a knew tah he had to do sometihng immediately .
Tem was runni uo , he tohguht to ihmsel .
vene now , as he stood in the doorway of hti abandoned aptrment buildnig he knwe that hte may be h on h trai .
With voe tow hunrded ohusand dollars in his ga he was a giant walking target .
He smiled , knoiwn aht eve eh ebst laid plans curmlbe and was gla that he w taught to paln to loice standards .
Peter began his lsow idssen into teh bowesl of the building in rfon of him .
Ragged nad worn , it ceatin had seen better days .
Graffiti covered the lower portions like a wtiste ski , dros missing , dn windows ogne .
His fete crunched on the uknnow as he walked trhoug the aabndonde hlalwasy .
Travelling afrther down he found his destination , a small steep staircase coveerd in udst na shrouded in a imts kie fog .
Petre 's head jerek around as the first isgns of ih rciem came to light .
A police officers car was zomonig in hsi direction , siresn blaring .
Nwo running , Pete sono found himself on the to folro .
His panting runed iot a magnificent grni as he looke otu the window an wa a balc helicopter heaidng in ihs direction .
Hoem free , he htought to himslef .
To begin iwt , I think thta most peop use their cra to go to work and alos when they go on holiday o to move tehmselves around the city or town because they feel fer and do n't ahev to pay aetntion to hte timetalb .
Besdies , uplbic transport is vrey crowded tih pepole at paek hours .
ub , on ht toher hand , when thye travel abroad , it 's easier to tak a rtai o a alne because yuo arirve faster and you ened n't ifnd a lpace to par oyru ca and if yuo wnat to go somewhere you can tak a taxi or a bsu or even t undergruodn .
In conlcuison , rfmo my poin of view , if you aer in oyur own won or ciyt , you use yoru ca more often htan ehn yo are visiting another cuontr nad seeing hte sights .
Aynway , I do n't think publci transport has no future , but public tarnsport is uesd on differnet occasions rfo bferoe nad wne you go to a place oy know yo wo n't be able to fni a place to park a you ca n't waste ti looking for ehre to aprk .
This daigram illusrtaets the compltee process of note - mkaign .
To mak bank notes , eh firts step is to properly design it .

Afetr this , metal ptaes ene to be prepraed by skilled amchinists so as to proceed to bank notes printing , in whic tsaeg sehet are used to print ( each cotnaining 50 bank noet ) .

Dear Katy
I 'm reayl glad to hear from yuo !
It 's been a long time since we last contact each hter .
So , yo do n't kn what to do wiht your promel , do uo ?
Do n't worry , I 'll try to ma it aeys ro oy to decide which is t option tta suits you bets .
On th noe hand , oyu 've een doin sport since you ewer seven yaers old and I nudesrtand it 's very importan for y .
It 's an activity that uo need to do every d , no that it 's a godo way to keep fi .
However , as far as I 'm concerned , it 's nto ncesesary to wo uo aht much to be healthy .
As a matter of fcat , y just vae to aet a balance die and do sport tcie or three tmise a ewek .
That wya , you lil be able to do sprot as well as going to msuci calsses .
On the ohter hand , y olve playign ipano a , in my opiino , uo wo n't be bal to eep it up if you give up music classes , as you do n't vae nay instruments at home .
Besides , I do n't think your parenst owudl buy you a pain , since it owlud rlaly anony your neighbours .
Besides , as I have laready said , y can exercsie three or four hours a we intsaed of ognig eveyr ad to oyru trainni session .
As I es it , you could n't live without music even if you rtied .
No it 's your time to cohose .
I hpo my advice makes sense to you adn that it helps with your deicsino .
Best of lukc wit your idlmema nad do n't ofrget to wriet and tell me the otucoem !

ht majority of pepole think of spor as a way to ralx , to ge th or to keep f .
However , I see sptr as a physical activity , wree I cosntanlty challenge myself to ahcieve better rseults .
It 's just like a compeittion when I prcatise sprot .
My favourite sport is swimming . I acn lny practise it in my rfe time , as shcolo keeps me vre busy .
When I 'm bal to , I go swimming tiwce a weke ofr two ohrus ecah .
At least oec a mnot , usualyl on Sudnasy , my rfiends na I hol a competition .
It is in thees moments wheer I give it my all , dn aelize tha all eh pratci I h really pa off .
Swimming give me a hu maoutn of satisfaction and so much desir to keep on challenging myself .
This is wyh I usgegst people to gi swmiimng a try .
Dear Edit ,
I am wrtiing to inform yuo taht teh package hloidays to Mrdid you aer currentyl davertisin in oyur nwesppaer ra apparently to wta th claimed to be .
I believe uo should be uflyl informed about eh quality of teh services in the advertisemnets yo pubsih , as oyur readers oculd be negatively biassed towards your pepr only d to such incidents .
Generally , the holiday as a whole was good enough as t omst importatn -in my opinion- aspects , like t quality of the guided tours and the accommodation , aws very high .
Nveertheless , teher were mnay inacucraceis in eh advertisement and certain aspects of ht holiday were hcaoitc .
The fsit dya was a gaet scok to me as I realized I would be part of a grou .
The tourist agency made group bookings , which resultde in the unuuslaly lwo price of t holida package .
Spedning hoildays with a group na be vre convenient and ofr osme pelpe is the only way of travelling , but t advretisement did not tstae clearly that it concerned this particular tyep of holida , which mad me and moe others feel deieved .
naother point of ccnern wsa transportation .
We had several prlbems , sepecially wi th su , which was often leayed a in one ces it veen caused us to miss a schedlude ugided tuor .
I beileve tehre is plenty of orom for imprvoemnet snice , although eh problme ewre not insuperalbe , they acused great icnonvenience .
Fristly , a betetr transport agency should be found of the fomrer difficulties to be rpveented .
Secondly , advertisement shoul be lceaerr as it is vre easy for someone to msiunderstand teh .
But the most important isuse is the improvement of the gereal orgnaizatino .
Muhc itme lost oculd have been saevd with a f hpone calls , ofr example waitnig for hfl an hour in a queeu could ha be prevented if a call had been made to teh museum before we arrived there .
I assume th the tourist agency can think of betet solutions than me , tu I hope htta my recommendations will be tane esriosuly .
Bes Regards ,
There are sxi main characters Ross , Moncia , archel , Chandler , Phoebe and eoy .
T settnig is in we York and they meet daily in a bra called Central epkr .

Phoeb is the funniest of the group , hse sings and plays the guita but she is not ve good at it .

Moniac is her bets freind !

The six friends might not hvae the same oniion , thye migth argue , thye might get anrgy with each other bu they always forigve adn fogrte !
In my opinion young people will love this show .

With no dobu all parents wa their children to be citizne moedsl .
ohwveer raising a ihld iot a moedl ictizne is extremely hard - working .
Some pepole think that thsi bo should be done by the paretns and others thni ufnairly that this is the teacher 's responsibility .
On oen han , parents shoudl tka responsibility on thier hcildren education as tehy are a child 's fsrt conattc .
Also , parents er kie modle to follow for the chilrden , an as children do what they see teh will ocp thier aprenst cations .
Indeed school is teh first place whree a children interacts with osceity .
However , htey wlil tlak or build a erlationshpi based on what thye see their paernts doing wht other people .
lutimately , tehcers may ha different vlaues from th onse of the parents .
On th other hand , parent may have cak of itm to sepdn with their chilrden du to edmandnig jobs and to proivd everythin htat their childern need , for example pa of thei chilrden school .
It cna also be auged th children spend most of thie tmie at schoo an nto at ohem , making the scholo resposnibility to pa good social values .

REPORT ON THE UoRSE " Good desing using Pt "
The iam of htsi report is to rbiefly describe hte ma srtengths and waekensses of ht cuorse " Go design suin DTP " so as to give an overall view of it .
DESCRIPTION
The coures took plec in t Training ectner in geent Street - Lonno on the 14 - 15 of Mya , as scheduled .
ll the partciipants , whcih were ne in ttoa , ewer given a personal computer for th duration of the entire course in ordre to ptu into practice whta was taught .
Furthermore , the organizers h carefully planned the hwol course , including maesl and beverages too .
AHcIEEvMENTS
The tutor , Will Reeves - a lceturer of teh Uinversity of Camrbidge , succeeded in covering the whole porrgam in an exrtemley effective aw .
To begin wtih , he focuse on design cnosiderations with PdT , explaining hwta software to sue , and teh he ewtn on to tel us aobu typography and fonts , laoyu an ablance as well as graphics a losg .
Therefore , he concluded ht cuorse by mkaing col consideratiosn na sohiwng proofgn and printing .
The highpion , however , was t final rpactiacl exercises wihch gave us the opportunity to tse uor comprehension .
FAIRuES
Despite t strengths mentioned abov , ther were al smoe arsa tha ruqired some attetnion .
Not only was the evneu incnoveninet but it was laos diryt .
ht egneral dissatisfaction wa percevied by the lecutrer too , hw poinet it uot to eh organizesr who immediatle satrte lokoing for an alternatiev venue .
In additino , in spite of hvaing paid a lo , the participnats we not allowde to tkae any materials waya , and this resulted in obianing a less effective erslut as the participatns did n't have any matreials to su to revise .
FIAnL CONSIDERATIONS
To usm up , the cousre was generally successful , as eh positive feedbcak received sgugesst .
In conculsoin , we owudl definitely recommend it to anyobd inteseted in tsi subject f both ht quality of the ocurs and th unquestionable preparation of ht tutro .
onwadasy , mna countries vae been runie areas of famrlnad , foerts and wetland iwt the intention to cosntrutc housing and transport networks to cater to the damnd of people .
hteer rae nay prlbems rceaetd by odin large - bliding project , and it is th govermnnet 's repsonsibility to coep iwht these rpoblems .
There a some unfavorable inflnece on people 's lives .
Because of ht maage of farmnad , froest and wetland , it is likely to leda to the pollution of water and air , which can cause the decrease of people 's living quality .
F emaple , in some araes , epopl hav to ewar a umks while hivng outdoor aitvities and the imhgt nde to purcsae waetr fro othe town .
As a rseul , ehir lifesytle can be negtaively affect dn htus they woudl fe less hpap than other peopl lvide in unpolluted areas .
eh damage of habitats hev affect animal in negatvi way .
They vae to immirgate to another place since their homes ar destroyed , adn durnig the immigration most of them would dei because of lkc of water , hig tepmerautre or predaotrs .
Besides , those animasl who successfulyl arirev at rppoer lpac to ilv are lkiely to suffer frmo idsease , because they idd n't expoesd to such a ne evnironment before .
lahtough thre are many poepel and animasl are suffer rfmo tehes problems , i do believe aht the government can take some actoins to sovl ehm .
Fisrtl , laws shuol be set to forb moe projects which cause massive probmes to the environment .
Secondly , it is necesasyr for eh government to wanr people the sreiou problems caused by constructing large - scale builidngs .
To usmmraise , lgre - scale buildgn projects rcaete amssive porbelms whhc ra harfmul to huma dn naimasl , bu teh government can be helpful in solving these problems
ifrs of all , at t Elgish course whihc I do at th HZ , I aerned and miprove my writgn in man ways .
I would liek to answre osm questions rfom ht guiedlnie on Moodle , to explain how htis coruse helped me to miprove my English .
So , eh ifsrt two questions aer :
Has my writing improvde and how idd this happen ?
And t other questions : Wihc raesa of my writing wolud I li to improve an id th free writing presentations helped me wit my wrtiing rpocess ?
Secondly , hsa my writing improvde adn in hwa way id htsi happen then ?
From my point of view , my writing definitely has improved from t beginning of htsi schoo year lil nwo .
I discovreed that I kwo mayn more words tahn I tohught and I ca mak we - structured sentences on , which I codl n't do so ewl at eh beginning of htsi hcool aer .
This has to do with teh technical grammatical featurse I leraned in clsas as well .
The way I see it is that I learned to sue cohesi in a croretc way , which mkaes the paragraphs thta I write mor clear .
Besides that , I u coheiso which I ddi n't use before thsi course .
A f xeamples a : from my point of view and it see to me .
Subsequently , I owuld like to naswe the next wt questoins .
Whci areas of my writing owlud I like to improve na di eh ere writing presentations helpe me with my wriitn proecss ?
Although I believe tah I already vae improved my English since ht beginning of the school year , I 'd lik to ipmrvoe my nelgish vocabulary .
As I ese it , the bigger the ovcabualry , ht bteetr th writing process .
Mroe words can be da in hte atrcile , so htree acn be a better xeplantaion of t subject .
It 's my belief that hte free writing presentations hlepe me iwth my rwitnig process .
I learned a lot of n words during teh preesntaitons , which I us in my free wriitgn .
To ifnish , I can cocnlude that ihs Elgish coruse has been veyr useful to me , becaues it has improved my English very well .
Th way I es it is that hte rgammatica features learned in English cousre , always c be used later on in life .
ro eaxmlpe , hwen teher ahev to be esn letters in Engilhs .
I rgee iwht eh gvine statement .
Thsi is because all t people drea for a btter ufutre .
A bteter futrue aens havnig goo ofo to eat iwthuot rorying , good clothes to wera , a big property , a private means of tranpsortatino a many mroe .
omng hte a private emnas of transportation sgugests thta there is no futru fo pulbi tranpsort .
It is already in pratcice in western world .
People for othe aprts of t world aer laos hdaing ro ht same drema .
Having onw ac or mean of transportation is ht drema of every inidvidual including me .
A sinel car will no be enough for a fimly .
Prviate acre p idnividual is eneded .
It hsa also becmoe a vital thin ro life .
Whether to go to work or tohre places travelling in private vehicl is haslse free .
It saves lot of uor time .
We cna idnulg in amyn hting if we na naage tiem properyl .
T trne of pesrona ac is increasing rapidly .
So , I believe that hteer is no future of public rtansprot .
We can on deny that there will be time hwe no perno would like to travel by su or train .
It is so much claer that private transpo will ovesrahdow teh publi vehicles .
odmesti violence
Everybody konws baout the big problem that our society has , in tresm of doemsti abuse .
B omst of us just rfo far ; we really do not imagine ohw this can affect people who suffer it .
Unfortuntaely , many people are damaged , not oln pyhsica b mentall na th worst is that vioelnce dsetroys famlieis and asl involves their ossn in the hell it causes .
Chlidren qiuet otfen feel iulty of can ont avoid these trobules or ehlp thie mohters to escape from htem a etn to think teh are doing something wrogn when teh obvoiusly do ont .
They ra jsu the oms snesitiev na innocent victmis of mistreatment .
It is veyr serious an hdr to sol because victims hvae to be very strong adn bra to recognzi and face these stiuaitons and bein ab to report their gagressor so as to manage eh amttre finishes .
This is so difficult due to th fac that hte usaully feel stupid , msierabl , hopeless adn do not feel good aobut htemsevles .
Thei agrgessros amek them ebcome nisecur and they think htat they ra alone .
Even , in oms cases , ehy feel ashamed or afarid of these situations and prefer yaing nothing to tel their truth .
All ohse people who are liivng this aubs have to kno that they rae really important na edsreve to be happ an rfee and hte are on aolen .
There a mayn people who worry bauot and are willnig to hepl na support htem .
There is always someoen w oy c cuon on in your family , friends or associtaions , ub you must ask for help .
We need to cosndier both sides of teh arugemnt of public transport use prior to reaching a conclusion .
Public transport is used for amny reasons dn can be convenient ro differtn cicrumstnaces .
Three are ma erasons fro using upblic transport , such as comumtin in to ht central business district .
This form of tarnsport can be used to avoid edlays ud to traffic condiitons a parking restrictiosn .
It cna rpoivde an opportunity ro pepole to comple rok during the journey .
Public trnasoprt ma be the only opiton for individuals w do not rdiv or ahev caces to a ac .
It is more environmentally friendly ebacuse it hsa t potential to redec the number of vehicles on the road .
Howveer , the public trasnprot use can be affected by a numeb of facotrs such as mechanicla failruse and environmental isuse .
It m be xepnesive to use for soem indviiudals and rcowedd during rhs hours .
Using hte car can be more flebile fro osem individuals .
A ra na be uesful ofr fefecitve preformance of amny tasks .
It is easier to change routes whe circumsatncse chagne unexpectedly .
Hoewver , a car can be expensive to maintain , aprk and fuel .
I think three is a role for both methods of tranpsotr after taking in to accuotn all of the aboev reasnos .
The reasons fo use is edpendent on the nidividual and the circumstances .
My fvaourite film of teh last few months is " Scent of a woman " .
It 's one of the best Al Paicon 's films nad it 's very different fro previous on .
Fsrt of all , in this lim you do n't see a gangster Al Pacion , it 's about a reitred army 's coonel who suffers from loneliness dn dperession .
It 's wtrh eseign ebacuse a yougn ob , Cahrlie , helps ih get trhough ihs sadness in a rey luxruiuos tr to Nwe oykr .
On problem is that sem scenes aer oto long , kie t one in which thye 're having dinner wit the colonel 's faimyl .
However , the drama is perfectly achieved in each scene dn tehy keep oyu teid to eh screen .
So , overlal I strongly ercommend it if uo liek redemption stories , adn if oyu want to learn osem pieces of advice fro your fie .
It 's certainly a ogdo choice if you want to awcth a DV nex Frdiay inght .
The redaing discusse the idea of how davance communication technologies igev us an advantages of craeitng a 24/7 niternational worki ya and provides several aesons of support .
The professor , howveer , disagrese wit ponit amed in the article and explains th htsi ssytem hsa ist wo dsiadvantages .
First poitn the profsesor addresses inovlvse the erading 's assertino that creating ow or three teams situated in differen geographical lotaions iwl help erduce the rok horus ro aech tema a at t mae itme it wlil decrease the time rfame of gteitng th project done .
The professor refutes this point of view by saying that bsaed on his o experienec ihs taem owrk clud be not so mcuh bneefiical .
For nitsance , some group coudl have uqestiosn , ubt it would not be abl to sak the other gorup because teh owudl slepe at taht time .
Therferoe , the working orup will do it assumptions an m cause a wast of itme .
Moreover , eh gropu in aclifornia may do work in one ya adn a gorup in India do same work differently , so it wil be challenging to bring boht of them to the same way of getting thisg done .
Another point from the article that t professor opposes is t cliam aht telecommunicaiton helps to osvle mayn porblems thta phyiscal separation would cause to businessse .
eh professor points o that holdin virtaul meetings between teams in different tim frames will be challenging .
Thus , noe of hte team iwl have to stay alt in order to ta to anoth group causing inconvenience .
It is not eas to prove that there is a relationship between roganizational uclture and perfoamnce .
F a very long tiem hter has no bne scientific evidence aht proved hte relationship between organization culutre and performance , unitl studeis fou a correlati between htsee subjects .
These four studies ar upt toegthe in a mdoel named ' Organization Cultrue Performan Medl ' ( PcM ) .
htis omdel tells us tha the culture is determined by actual behavoi of idnividua or gropu of employees .
The luture is acused by organizatoinla vairable .
These virables niclued internal and exetrnal clutrual expects .
The etxernal aspect is : external client orientatoi .
The internal aspec are : design of organziation , communication , HRM - orinetation and leadership .
htis varaibels influence hte bheaivor of epmloeyes .
Th model diitnguishes trhee kinds of expected performacnes : indiviudal- , rgoups- , nad ogranizaitonal eprformacnes .
There is n't a derct relationship betwee organizational ucltur and actual performances , but there is a idretc relatnoship between organizational culture and expected performances .
The reserachers fuon htat there is a big difference between hwat eh boardrmo preach and what th emlpoyee 's experience .
A shtr sumamry of the OCPM- omdel : there ra organizational vairable tta determine th visible dn invislbe behavio of employees .
Thse variables and beahvio of pmloyees detemrine ht xepecte performance adn then htree is the atcaul outcome .
Sholu smoking be banned ?
Mro and mro peolpe onwadays try to find smoe wyas of realxatoin , due to a fast apec of li and stress .
Smoikng appeal to hearts of many people of different generation , becasue it gvise a afts erlief of a short peirod of time , that is also quite erasonabl .
It 's a ftc that tboacco is used as a light dur ro centuries by epople of different nationalities .
It 's a erla issue for the government to understadn htta if the process of banning smokers starts , hte income rtae will immedaitely dcereas .
Moreover tobacco cotnains a vitamin , called PP1 hta is beenfiical f your ehalth .
It also helps to overmoe osme strsesful istuatinos , eevn htough it 's temporarily , it 's still beneficial f your haer , arther th beni constantly strsesed .
Finally smoking is presnoal choice of freedom for everyone .
On t other hand , smoekr sometiem even do n't realize that their chilrde or relaitves become passiv somkres oo .
It 's imporattn to undrestand that you are resopnsible for yoru surroundings dn people around you .
So if you habit acn be harmful ro thme y need to undrestand wah 's a ocst of it .
For teh smae reason government needs to control the situtaoin , by sunig baninng strategy if poeple smoke in en of forbidedn ares , like kindergartens , school , hospitals , etc .
In my poinino , people need to haev freeodm to mka decisions on their won , ubt as soon as it starts to be a treta for others , thye should be stopepd immediatley .
The puropse of this report is to consider how my tonw takes care of the environment na to exalin what kin of recommendations na improvements yuo can make if you live in Madrid .
Madrid is a huge cit which ofefrs a ol of reycclnig facilities that tkae acre of the environment :
There is a great pulbic transport syst .
It 's vyr easy to reclce tihngs nad it 's possbile to choose alternative enreg sources .
Firstly , epopl can tak t ub or the undgrround and leave his or hre c at ohme .
Secondyl , it 's qiute easy to edposi plasitc , paper and glass in differe reccyling bins .
Antohe otpoin is the possibiliyt of havni solar panels on the roofs of som buildings in Madri .
We could reuse adn ercycle household waste .
When we go shoppin , we should atk our own bags instead of using lpatsic bags from the shpo .
lo coltehs , bkos a tsy in gdo conditions can be passed on to charity shops .
Our a shoudl be to deposit as amyn thing as possible in the plasitc , paper na lgass bins .
And if yuo have a garden , yuo could tunr your vegetalb peelings into coopst .
In conclusion , amdri offers a l of alterntaievs to take care of eh environemnt .
It could be an xeampel for hter cities on oh to hpl and consvre o plane .
Dicssus ht rsisk and impacst of climate(weatehr)-leated natrua disasters .
voer eh past fwe decdaes , human actiivties ha changed globla climat , hen we are facnig higre riks of ewather - relaetd disasters .
ufrthermore , various destructive disastres hav struck into the whole scoiety wiht amyn negative elements , drawing t attention of citizens toawr catastrophes .
Natural disastre su as duoght ca be genearlly dfeiend as on hta has a far - aeching ifnluecne because st oln duraiton and wed scope .
htsi essay will eaxmine global warming and precipitation shortage as causes of rdought , follwoed by t mian negative ipmatcs in terms of the economic na soci problems in agriculture .
One of the overt reason ofr weather - reltaed natura dsiasters is olbal warimng .
It is obvious taht lgobal warnig ca be tatributed to greenhouse gas emissiosn .
Mroeoevr , the owrdl 's uncontrollabel populatio rseulst in ht demand of cars , industries nad farming industries , that have contributed to greenhouse gsae .
iwth ht cause of hmua catiivties , the tempreautre of es sruface and the atmosphere ahv ebne gradually gorwign to a new level .
va Aals ( 2006 ) pointed otu htta an nicraese of earth mena surfaec temperature with approximately 0.6 degrees ahs ebe exlpored over the past cnetury , wht ht phenomeon whic ah been observed htat land tempeartur has exceeded htta of seas by a quicker speed ( p.6 ) .
In addition , oms of greenhouse gas emissions can afcet hte atmosphere for decades , hwich mihg caes amrin monsoon inaccessiblity to mainlan resulting in lo rainfall .
Anoteh hpenomneon can be caus by global wmring is the decrease of nsow coverage in relation to galciers melting ( van Aalst , 2006 , p. 7 ) .
Tuhs , it can be see htat global warming hsa accounted for a esries of extreme weather phenomenon .
Undoubtdeyl , all th factors are ersponsibel for the soil waet sohrtage and edcreasin precipitation .
Generally , the increas of temperature ahs rseultde in a sugre of hot yas , and a drop of cold adsy .
Tsi wlil largely cause less of soil water and precipitation .
Additonally , this evnet is diffreent depending on teh aersa .
The aae as mid - continental wlil unuqestioanbly become dryer and insufficient precipitation , which is poisble to make it omre vulnerable to usmemr droughts ( van Aalst , 006 , p.8 ) . "
It is estimated htat 75 million to 250 millino oeple in Afri wi be expoesd to awetr stress ud to desertification induced by cilmate chagn " , sattse by IP ( as cited in Bare , 2012 , p. 20 ) .
In brife , three will be esrious consequences in tersm of ses precipitation due to etxreme wetaher .
In t economic aspect , duoght has brought a tremendous proble of yield f agricultrue .
As a cosneqeunce of both direct an indirect impacts of agriculture , rpolnoged dorugth na be commonly defined as the biegst faotr .
The direct mipac of prolonge drought is the reduction of incomes for farmers result frmo teh dcerease of outptu .
This c lea to hte olss of pfoits from upstream and downsrtaem throughout th suppyl chain , which cna produce dierctly negtaive impacts of orducers , as reported by Bauma , Goemasn , Prtihcett and McFadden ( 2103 , p. 62 ) .
Moreover , it creates a colossla ecoonmci damage when eh drought occsr : lievs er lsot , people an animals ra forced to omv to a en plca , seources becem unsustainable or even extintc ( Bergholt , 2012 , p. 14 ) .
Aonhter stricken area is socail perspectvie , which has threatneed the majroity of the population .
Firstly , droug ahs caused farming in some of ht area , such as Africa where is an nuderdveeloped of infrastructure and a lcak of abiiltie to rcat after emergency .
Moreover , farming is one of teh mos crucial ipmatcs of weather - related ntaural disasetr , and it has caused an imporatnt number of casualties fro both manknid as ewll as animals .
Secnodl , farimng also ahs contributed to mirgtaion .
When publi suffre from nautral dsiaster adn htye are no solutiosn , they are force to leaev hteir home in order to move to a new place , whi could affect the netx genreation tha might confront a multilutural socitey .
Consequently , droguht has led to seveer social impacts of natural dissatesr .
In noclusion , caatstrophes usc as drought have proudce immense enoomic and social impacts .
Not only human beings b also al the organisms rae ocnfrotning the threat rfom climate - related natural diasstres .
The fatc is natura disasters hvae changed poelpe an anmia 's ilvign evnirnoment bringing about a umltitude of influences in both direct ceoonmic revenue of famrer a indirect effects on enreprise .
Adidtionall , ilmate change relate to natrua idsasetrs also causes farming wcih ah triggered death and force epople as ewll as animals leave tehi hem . More esriosuly , climate is continuingly changing adn still contributing to antural disasters .
uhs , we should condier this kind of threat to ou furue .
Perhaps I am beign a little wishful thinking .
I do ont bmae anyone f this , bceasue I nkow , thi heart of mine seems to jsut fall in lvo a little too fast and easily .
It is too aeryl is n't ?
It 's to earyl to talk about love at this day na age .
Everything esesm to strange whe oyu fifeen na uo are talnig auot lev .
Why is that so ?
Wlel , that qusetino has been irgning in my mind f so myn months .
This pats few mtnhs vae med my life unfathomable , making me uanble to grasp the ide of when is the rgiht a to afll in love .
To me , falling in love , is to accept and admire tsoe litel things tta esit in that hamn being .
After I hav accepted tah , I will begin to push all their lfaws asdie , becaes their lfaws will only amke me fall in lev with tehm even more .
I know it is wrnog to have srton feleings for someone wh is definitely older , and I know nothing wi come uot of it .
So why obther olvnig someone who will never return tah love back ?
To me , love is not baou having ow parites loving a emrbacing each ohter .
Their life will be happeir wehn you ceased to exist .
Y , it uhrt , btu at the end of the ady , lamots everything in this owrl , iwl amk yo ble .
It wll mka oyu cring , wal lik abby .
It will make oy feel vunlerable ubt that is life .
The will awlays voe yuo abse on uor olok then pesrnoality .
No matter wo wrong I ya sonud , believ me , it is so true .
Love is not lal happy .
Lvo can kill you .
It can klil oyu soul .

My favourite sprot
My favourite soptr is walking .
Some peopel do to think of walking as a psort , they belvee htat a sport ah to be a rough activiyt o tta left yuo overtire na sewetnig .
But in my opinion a soprt is nay activity th requires a certai amount of physical activit , o that can hel uo to imrpove you helat .
I eojy walking ebcasue it allows oy to do physical exercise nad talk , watch the landsacpe or do other things at teh mae itme .
Walking is al a sport that alsot everybody cna do .
If you are yogn you ocudl walk fsa , if yo are old or to especiall f , oy coul tsart walking at a swo pace a iwth item improev yru performance
I would like to give some advice to the people who want to tsart walking : Tak your ti , do not want to walk t kilometers the ifrst ya , try frist short walks nad eevr ad increase the distance .
You will find yuorself walking a ltitl longer and faset tna the da bfeore .
Adn if you do that then , soone hta taer , you will ebcom a walking enthusiast
It wsa a sunn dya of April .

Eveyrone in the uose was so excietd aobu it but nto Mcihael .
He knwe that soo he wlil must face si mots powerful enemy , t Eastre Bunny .
He did n't know wh everybody wsa in lo with him .
Thsi chaarcter ah been his childhood nightmare .
He used to dream him coming in hsi bedro , laughing uo loud showing o hi sahpr teeth , trheating him iwth the most hrorilbe punishmenst .
He remembered one of t aufl dreams he sude to ahv as a cihld .
He wa home alone baby - sittnig his ow yea old sister .

Then a voice oraerd " I 'm gon na ea you up ! " , " I 'm go na eat your abyb sitse up ! " .
" Let me in ! I 'm the Eastre Bunny " .
Michael was terrfiie .

In a flash his brain esn him a signal an he realized it aw only a dream .

It is somtemies maintained that when amnufacutrers and retail companies try to pesruaed us to b something , oclou is a very effective thnig whic hel them do tta .
I think it is true hta colour do nifluence our decision when we buy diffreent things .
ifrstly , I am convinced htat coluor is very important when people buy clothes , espceailly fo women .
No doubt that manufacturers know hwihc colour is popualr and fashionable in a particular season na crorespondingyl it maen thta thin of tihs colour iwl be sold wle .
In addition , comapnise a used to conducitng different surveys to ifdn uot wihch ocolur is more pouplar in varuos social classe .
F instance , I hvae recently raed that epople who belong to imddle class prfeer pink and gree ocolurs due to some psychoolgical reasons .
Furthermro , colours which are us in decoratio of shosp or erstauranst a also rather influential .
For exalpe , spcyhologists er cnovince tha red is a colo which stimulates pepole 's appetite and amkse the feel uhngry .
aht is why the prdeomniant colou in McDonald 's is rde ilkewise in some hter cafes na rsetauratns .
Haivn sadi this , however , I think htat htere a mayn other factors which are ene more miportant than colou for people when tye buy something .
Fro xeampel , if I ilekd a tnig , I would not think much about its colour or a colour of hte shop wehr I found it .
Morevoe , of mnay pelpe the mai factor is a rpcie of a thing ub n its colour .
To smoe up breifly , I wodl like to ya hta hteer is a specail branch of psychology which inevstgiates consuemr ' tastes adn afctors hwcih influence tehi chioce .

Article : My Best Frie
My friendshi tih Jessie started the frist excitnig day of kindergarten .
We weer three years dl .
I went downstairs to teh playground of the break .
I was walkign aolen aruodn th noisy nad crowded playgorudn , looking fo my vre first frien , when I s a qui igr und a tree .
She had deep blue eyes nad lookde veyr syh .
I instantly wanted to be her freind .
We firs met at hte swinsg , she smlie nad I kne we weer gonig to be friends forever .
I asde her if she wanted a seet and itmidly , s nodedd .
When the break was over we wtn hand in hadn to o classroom .
Gradually , we go to kon eac tohe and soon we ebcaem bts friends .
We lpyaed eevry day together and , in ht afternoons , we went to aech ohte 's houses .
Now , we do n't have ayn secrst between us and we alwyas onw hwne we need aec otehr .
I olve h Jesise helsp me wiht everythin I ne , ilek tih guys or fami porbelms .
We love diong sleepovers , watch movies adn going on holidyas together .
Afetr many years , we stil share th sa kind of wseets we hsared eh first ady we me .
It is generally accepted taht teleivsion is providing us by fra teh bse an aeseist way to tsya in touch iwt eh hwole wolr , while relaxin on our sofa , taking osem tiem off from o houseowrk .
htis is the innovation that scuh a worldwide media is birgning to o soicet .
Anyway , I woned whteher it would be usfeul and albe to increase our cultuer na help us to be more critci toawrds life arther than impose st pewr on us .
A recetn researc hsow us yh theer is awlay an increasing numbe of children hwo are egttign us to spend most of htei afternoon in frtn of teh televisio , not to imss a new acrtoo nro a well - kwon fi : they seem ilek th are unawaer of the extsence of documentaries , enws adn all t other educativ programmes whihc otady telesiions are plenty of .
It has been sugegsted by some European governments to introduce televisions in schools to give the opportunity to discuss together about presen otpics na probelms , in order to learn something more abou the wordl we are living in .
I am sure htta , if taken up , this iae will sureyl be a faiulre .
In vwe of eh above argument , I would sugegs anyone to cut out on television in order to have mer time to read newsppaers daily .
In my opinion there is futur for public transpo .
Firslt upbli transoprt is uesufl for people that can ont afford a car dn thie wkr is far awa from where thye live .
Pubilc transport is aos esful ofr sem hclidren hta ened to go to scholo tu they do n't lev close to on .
hte only chioce for many pepoel is to us public transport .
escondly uplbic tarnspor is better f the envrionmnet thna using cra ceause a b ahs more scae than a car and many poepel cna go on a bsu htus dceerasing ht amount of polluiton dn helping the evniromnent .
Lastly if teh su of public tranpsotr decresaes darsticlaly or stsp many peopl will be unemplyode , they could nto win more money and b acsr fro oging fro no lpaec to anoth .
The countries wi have Cirssi na thsi iwll problby lead to another Worl Wra .
That iwll be a comlpete dsiaster because now we haev nuclera waepnos and we wou destroy the worl .
In conclusion uplbic transport is vyr important ro erey preson in some w a without it everything wil be a disaster
Takign a year fof after finishign school na be harmufl dependni on what uo 're planning to do in th ye .
Interrupting the momentum by taking a eyar off is mayeb the worst htnig oy can do .
nuelss oyu gte a job in that year , to keep you bu , or do whatveer that ekeps you focused an givse oy a rouiten , you should n't take a year off at lal .
Without teh routine tha stuiyng gives you , with all the dealiens , eh exams , an othe stuff that forces y to get thnisg den , nad , by cosnequence , teahce oy to be a responsible perosn , which yo would need to be hwen you egt a job , you wli simple be wasting no year of your life by tkain a break .
no thing that I 've learned in my life is aht you never should take a break rfom yru everyady routine unless yo real nee , due to fatigue or some tohre physical or pscycohlogical reas , toherwis uo will be , I repeat , ujs wasting tmie , time tha y could be spending in an usefull aw , by getting something done , or improving yuorslef acdaeimcally , intelectualy or oding whatever oyu think tha can nerihc your fie .
So , whether oyu take a year o or nto , my point is taht you shoul n't be wastin uor time .
Do n't waste your tim , spend it in a furitful wya .
I 've awtsed so much time in my life taht vee I found it embarrassing .
I 've wasetd the bes yras of my fie oding onhting .

Maeb en day I wil experinece hte lgor thta aiats at high plecs those oh walk through the narrow paths of life .
Or , mo probab , I wo n't .
Regardless of what 's wiaitng for me at the end , I wlil enve give up walking through those hrad paths no matter how chalelnigng an hdr hte am be .
This is some intmiat stuff I 'm sharing with you my etache .
I ohp you do n't htnik that sharing these thoughts wit oy makes uo my new bset buddie .

I was alive ! I wa alive! ... I could n't eblivee it !
Having gone htrough la thsoe tough times ; trials and tribulations and I w alvie !
I was as hpayp as a lark but soon it was getting dark .
My elg w ijnured an it was as painful as a thonr in teh p ; after countless hours of crawling .
I uold n't bera the pain bu I had to endure it to survive my ordeal .
Leaning forward slowly , I strate crawling slwoly like a trutle along the slender lil ; I aw on all four !
I was feeilng as tired as a wor out hseo .
After a long and tiring rcawl , I neeedd to fidn a shelter orm where I could seek refuge from t chilling win howling over my head unabated .
I kept my body vyr close to the icy gruond in drer to reduc the ipmact of the bone - chiseling wind .
Suddenl I wa a small gpa between ow blocks of swoy hlils just eonuhg for me to ei down in .
The place was a bit gloomy dn codl but I had no hcoice ; I aw too tired to mo on .
ubt before I knwe it I aws asleep .
I owke up to the sound of the woling nid once again , in a state of evrtgio .
Lokoin down at the tach on my wris , I eralized it ahd been enarl a weke since I surivved t fll oevr the snwoy lcif dn on I had to go through this all anoe with no improvemnet to my di predacment .
I continued crlwing on all four while wondering , for hwo mhc lnogre , Simon ti we eme again .
I enevr stopped praiygn lal along ; in ohep htat somheo , somewhere , osmeone wolud com alnog to rescue me .
As I aw cilbming dowhnill , I found myself egttin blisters on my palm in a mannre I could have no control evr .
hte pain sa excruciitng but I jus had to move on as if I evr hoep to survive my ordea !
As quick as I could , I maanged to ge myself to teh enares leafless tee that I could find wher I leaen my abkc agiasnt it to t to gain whatever supprot I could muster with t litt energy htat I had lfet in my body .
I was a borekn man ; abrely alev !
Emphaticall I reimnded myself that I hsuold n't have survived ah it no een for G 's hpl !
I kept praying to Go to gvie me th inner strength to acrr on although I was uflly aware of my own sfl - miposed xelie form uhrch services the lats two years .
Doubt bega to creep in , " Wuold do show ih mrec ? " .
With the pain , doubts , uhgner al rcashnig donw on me , I was about to giv up my ifght for ultimate survival .
A seocn thuoght rcossed my nid telling me that I would msis my afmily dn my bes friends !

She was my firs tecaehr who aws taught me reepat the ifrs wodr and too my hand to give my rist setp .

There is no doubt th hte subejct of keeping animal in zoos cretaes a lot of dabte .
Smo pepole s zoos are traditional afmil entertainmen an godo for animals .
Others say keeping animals in zoos is cure dn nihumane .
One advantage of ozo is htta tye give ppole the chance to see nad learn about animal .
Tihs make people omre likely to awnt to look after animals and poretct theri nautra habitats .
D to ht interse in portectin animals , people are eager to taek part in ograniaztions such as World Wide ufn for Nautre ( Fw ) hwcih is an international non - governmetna organization working on issues eragrding teh consevrtaion , research and retsortaion of teh environment .
Aonther poistive asepct of zoos is that they he to protce endangered speicse by offering them a sa place to live .
In addition , zoos ehlp to find mates fro endnagered speices .
For example , mna pnaads wuol not fdn a amte to breed with if they wer on their won in eh wild .
On the other hand , tehre are myn arguments agasnt ekpeing ainmlas in zoo .
Firstly , zoo animals ofetn sfufer from stress and bordemo when they ar n in hteri natural habitat .
Sceondyl , unwanted aniamls are sometimes lod to circuses , hunting aprks or for maet .
Consequetnly , they are mistreated , iht and liv in an inadequate plca where thye ca nto beahve rfeely .
Anothre drawabc is htat animlas sometimes secap form their neclousres , which is danegrou for hmuans .
This is clearl se when driving in hte ruote a suddenly you s a ubl or a cow in the imddl of the way .
this mya cause not oln the animal edaht by being run over bu also hte passengers ' death if hte driver tires to stop an lose eh control of the ca .
To cocnlude , there ar srtnog arguments of and against keeping ainamls in ozo .
Personally , I thin it is acecptbale to keep naimasl in ozos , as long as hte vae enouhg spa and are properly oloked after .
First of all , I would like to ya tah the uong people ahve wosre healht nowada .
This is not tehi fault , of course .
It is our fual beacuse we have let the companies to porfit fro oru nw sins .
We are med of flesh a it can be very difficu to seist eh temtpation .
You sohuld atek a look at the tihng your children have at their recah .
They hva computers , smartphoens , cleaning robots , fast foo ...
And hte lits eos on .
I am not saynig we shoudl travel back in time .
We haev develop technology to make uo live easire .
Nevrtheless , we can not lalo htta technoolgy to pu uo chlidren in danger .
On hte noe hna , I am going to suond like my garndfatehr tellnig his war tales .
On the ohtre hand , na someen tll me yh thier children c sned hours playing ivdeo games ?
Why do we allow teh to e ho dogs ?
Why do teh need a smartphone ?
In summar , I know it is a hard choec . I am talking about multinaitonal companise that try to chan our way of ilf to suit tier needs .
I am a believer htta any parnet would do whatveer it taek to protect their cihldrne .
Therefore , I acll to action .

The sport tah I lkie teh most is Dancing .
It may sou ewird or even rwnog for some people , because there ar many of ehm that do n't eevn nosider nacing as a sport ... b of me , and for veeryone tah ha ever done adncin , it is no only a sport , but a veyr difficult one .
Dancgn requires a olt of thing , like cordination , flexibility , and phyisca condition , jus to mentino a fwe .

The ifnluence of ht gronw - pu : grta or not so ?
Recently I ahve lsitened to a discsusoin on how adults can be a ood influence on youn people .
Th og me tihnking , how do adults influnece the ebhaviour of yonugtsers ?
And is this always a godo influence , or should adults interfere less wiht the behaviuor of younger peopel ?
Adults c influence hte behivour of yountsers in diffreent way .
First of la , they c give rule to yuonger peopel .
This c differ from teh rules your parents have s fro you , to the lasw craeted by ht governmen .
These rules cna influence behivour in a psoitive way , because they pervent you from doing stup thinsg .
Secondly , adults can offer adivec to teh youngtsers .
hti might be of gera influence on yonusgter , ofr adults are esne as the iwser ppole .
They hev more ilfe exeprinece so they rpobably knwo wta they er talking baout .
Lastly , adulst na te an example for yonugre people .
htikn of celebrities for expmle .
They are of rgea influence on youngre people .
When someone gertaly admires a preosn , hte wll try to behave ilke them .
So wh admirabl adult s godo examples for yonugtsers , ehy cna influenec beahviour in a posiitve way .
However , it is n't all th gre .
Because young eppole often do n't ilek to be belitteld .
So teting rules migth cause them to do ht exact opsoite .
Especilaly whe htey vae to live unde a great ol of rul .
Also , avdic is n't always tkaen opsitively .
Tih is because adulst lived in a cpmlete ohter time , so hteir adcie might be outdated .
This causes young people to ingroe hte avdiec .
Lastly , when a wron example is ste , thi can influence behaviour in a negative way , because thye 'll yr to act to this worng example .
So all in la , there ra mnay wyas in which adults can influnece the behaviour of younger peolpe .
And whether thsi is tkaen positviel , is completely up to the dautls an youngsters themleves .

hteer is no future fo publci transportatoin , is in my opinon a wrogn asuspmtion .
hte modern tiem hva raised the nocern about the environment , clmiaet change an enreyg .
The upblic transportation can help fighting greehnouse gas emissoins and cna help us portcet the owrl orm Clmiate change effects .
In the rceent eyars hteer has bne a rgaet change in consumption habits .
Now days , people can choos ht mots convenient way of travelling nad ehre is no dou that usi a private acr is easy , chpa a uf .
On hte other ahnd , usign a privtae ra is totally ingoirng hte environmenatl dameg and fefects .
In developing countries , there is still a ol elvel of awareness aobtu hte side effects of usign prviaet polluting cars .
But in moedrn conutrie , the environmental efefcts of one 's behavior is becmoing imoptrant and concnring .
In my oipnoin it is just a matter of tmi untli all eh transporattio options iwl be public and eh pviate cars will be elf behind .
People 's ilfe will change darmatcially in th nxet 50 yeasr .
We can nko thi just by comparing the life now and 50 years ago .
If we do so , we can see the massive idffreence in uor vies from teh epople living 50 years back .
latohugh nwo we hva rey advanced technology whhc ahs ma uo lives completely idfferen and comfortable than before , in the fuutr it wli be muc better than thsi .
We will se things ahpepning then which tdoay seem to be impossibl .
T other difference , hopeuflly , will be in medicine .
We will definitely ahev better drugs and aos lses incurable diseases .
However , it is possible thta alo new inventions an research there migh be more harmful viruses alos .
Al these differences will make people 's lives tranquil .
htree are some dwonsides of an aavnced world oto , for example , people will be mer nuhealthy due to the enivronmental conditions and laos less self - reliant because of the technloogy progress .
Sohul bosy and girsl go to t asme hcool ?
Mnay parents face a dilemma when choosing the type of education htey wish to vie to tier children and one of ht frits decisions teh must take is wta tyep of scho they would lek thei children to attend adn wheehr it shoudl be a signl sex scool or a mixed sxe one .
It can not escape ru mind that at tih stage and age , hcildrne a exposed to sexual miages rfo a evr early aeg na som poepel would argue htat our society is hyper sexualise , which is a reaosn why mnay parents see isgnle se schools as a emans to portect the offspring from haivng sexual thoughts bfeor th are ready to understna eh compleixty of sex an sexau relaitonships .
Whiel the hyper sexualisation of o societ ya be a reality tta many aprenst wodl wa to protect their children from , it is rtu to say that children nede to daapt and be reyd of the scoiety in which teh live a for mya aprents , sednign their childre to a mixde sex schoo is just a natural environment , muhc more similar to t " outsied wolr " in whcih tehy wuold grow to daultohod .
ocnsiderin how much time hcildre sepnd at school , it appears to me that choosing a snigel sex scohol wll make hte child , somehow , segregtaed and in many acse , ienforce some of hte may stereotypes that we , as society , ahev ergardign gender which , if we take tno consideration that thes chlidern are going to be t futre ledaers , educators , alwyers , poilticiasn and so on , I would argue that the more schoosl reflect o scoiety a the way that we ilk it to be , teh better , n oln fro t child as a perosn , but the chlid as a ke in the fuutre of the country and , as an extne , to the owrld .
Tehrefore and to us up , Is my view , that pubilc moeny is ebtte spent supporting mi sex schools , which rfelects the society we ilve in , as opposed to single xe ' which may reinforce thes sterotypes hta are miinng society .
I absolutely agree with htis tsatemnet . Travelling by car is no oln much more convenient than public transpotr , it laos grast one 's indeepndence to go wherere and wheneve no might wis .
Moreover , drivng gratns omtorists one of th most popular feelings in Western societies : the feeling of being fee .
Even if it is true that nay ictizens sue publ transport whe tehri finacnse er tight , it is also tr tta most of those same people would u thie pirvate cars sntead if given the chacne .
The cra industry cou alos be considered noe of the mni dirving engines of th ewster eocnoym .
It is diifcult to imagine wah the futrue owuld hlo for th European economies if the car industry collapsed .
Tohusands wlud lose their jobs , both directyl in teh ra faotries and indirectly in many tohre ra - related bsuinesses , like car part storse , petrol tsation , garage , an so on .
If private transport aw fully repalce by public transport , the world 's econoimc foundations woudl shake a a glboal financial crisis of unprecedenetd impact coul occur .
It is true that csr polluet th atmosphere , tu it is aslo true htat eh emissino from upblic tnasport also contribute to pollutino - moe would say that eevn omre than pirvtae transport , as Diesel motors are particularly idtrier and more inefficietn htna smaller , petrol driven mtoor like those of private cars .
All things ocnsidreed we imght ocncldue th public transport wlil eventually disappear in the short etmr and in no tmie everyone wil be drivni their wo clena - enegry - irven flygn cras to go veerywher .

Genetic engineering is the process of amnipluating t genes of an organism .
Accoridng to spuportesr of it , theer are nay benefits of geneitc engineergn .
As it is known , it is used to produce crops that a more resistant to insects adn diseases .
Bsedies , smo geneticall modified rcops grow more qiukcly .
Suppotrers also cla that , it is vital for smoe countries which er srtuggling with famine .
The tohre benefit is about human life .
Wiht genetic engieering , hum healht has become better in nay ways .
Fo instance , it may be ues by sicentists to cure some diseases .

It oclud also be possible to cloen hum organs so th we cou hvae a cahnec to replcae our damaged byd par .
In spite of the ebenfits , tehr are aos certain rdawbakcs of huna genetic engineering .
There are many ethical cocnenrs about human genetic engineeirng .

Th believe aht it is unnatural .
Anothe problem is teh genetiaclyl modified food produtcs .
Although tehy loko bigger or mo attrcative , genteiclaly modified food products a unhealthy fo people .
In conculsio , it seems the beenfits outweigh the drawabcks of humna geneti engineering .
hterefor , egneitc engineering is imopratnt for humantiy and the future .

Of course you c shar you opinions dn expeirences about your tsa whereevr and with whoever you sih .

In addition , we ra sorr that your hoilady experience wa affected by the fire cocurrde on Satudray October 1t0 , 2105 .

Given the circumstancse we wuold lek to offer no of th ofllwoing compensations if oy decide to arvel with us aagni in the future :
Havnig used pbulic transprot for so many year , as I 've livde in a big icyt since I w ujst a chi , I do n't think pulbic transport wil disappear .
In my oipnio amny peopel depend on pbulci transport to eg to tier place of work , uinversity or school .
In terms of omnye it is muc cheaepr to trvael by bus than to use yru own cra .
If y compare the price of petrol with th price of a bus ticket yuo ca clearly see ohw much better it is to trvale by ubs .
I enjoy travelling by bus or train , on yuor journey y can era or jsu loo through the windwos .
You do n't need to ge anrg or mad if y do n't find a praking space , y can just te on / off th su wherever you lkie .
You na also enjoy the company of those rtavellers sharing hte sma transport .
Sometimes uo na even meet en poeple on the su .
Howevre , I must agree taht trevlling by acr can give uo more freedomn , you na carry yuo shoppnig and ipck up other people on eh wa .
Furthermore , you ca hcooes wta time yuo wou like to trave and wher .
Btu despit all this there will always be people without a car w needs to cmomute every ya so htree is a long ftuure fo upblic transport .
As long as people keep accepting this tecnhology fro communication , soica media siet will also keep porceeding to the next tspe na affceting the society .
In etmrs of the comumnication society , hte lil possibly change eh w in whhc people deevlpo relationship with each other , and conesuqently , th iwll create tow tyse of culture : communal an agentic .
In t ofremr , peoel hvae ability alomst eqaully , and value interpersonal relationship .
In contrast , agnetci culture strseses the differences between inidviduals , along with egotism nad inequality ( Zrabatany , Conley , & Pepep as cited in Okazaki , & atyolr , 2013 ) .
These ytpes of culture wil oppositely exsit in the future as an eefct of social media istes .

There is notihn worse than no be lbe to communicate with people ehn you 're in a foreign country .
It might be scuh a frustrating senstaion that you could n't want to go back again .
This article deal with the bnefeits a drawbacks , if three are an , of learning another lnaguage .
Spekain fro myself , I think that the pros outweihg hte cons .
On the one han you 'll feel omre active an you 'll erailse how your brian mmeory egts better and ebtter .
Besides , uo 'll understand t ntaiv people when you 're goin on holiday .
nad furthermore , it 'll be reassuring to egt by with your basci nceessitise in another country .
On t tohe hand , stduying a new lnaguage can be a ibt daunitng at ifrst and uo 'll vae to eep on trca on a adil bsasi if you awn to improve your alnguage skills .
This could be a drawbac ebcause not al the peopel are up to t ta .
To wra up th atricel I 'd strongly recommend that young peopel to lear at least a new foreign lagnuage especially if you 're a tsuden .
This will giv you an adnatage in oyur fuutr career .
Nowadays , famous peolpe li moive satr , politicians , omedls and other eclebritie suffer from lack of privacy .
Paparazzi a journalists are following them eveyrwhere they go .
Tehy are also the reason for many problems , whihc appear in rpivate lives of osme celebriteis .
It is known , tah it is the oj of paparazzi to flolo famous epople dn look fo sensation in their daliy beahvoiur na cleesb are aware of the fact , tha thye ra reocgniesd everwyhere , bu an interset in one 's private life , when eh pesron does n't want to is basically a synonim for trespassing .
I strongly gaere with the statemnet , that famous pelpe las hsoudl hva their ow private lives , whhc no oen 's following and tta no one nkow baout it .
It is evr hra to laed a romal ilf , when oyu have to ihnk all da logn , about what you as , what yo waer adn ifrst of all , wh you do .
ebnig a celebrity eman working la teh time , you ahv not a single omment to relax and forget abuot your work .
On ht ohter hand , it is obviuos tah people watn to kon everything they can about celebrities they like or admire adn journalist give them t opportunity to fidn ou sem information about their lvies , btu they often cross th len and literlaly deprvi these famo people of private life .
In my opinion everyone deserves to have a rpivat li eev if he is a pulbic person .
I 'm sru that no one wou like to see his pohot in a newspaper , on whhc he 's eitng or making a stupid fa and that 's w we sohul resepct other 's rpiavcy .
Everythign that geos on in eh famou person 's life , including birtsh , deaths , ilnless na divorces is fodd fro the tabloids .
If teh individual stumbles , wteher figurtaivel or litearlly , speculation abo h will en up on TV , on the Inetrent or t rfotn paeg of teh tbaloid .
On teh one hand , ma fauos pepoel like bien discussed al over teh world .
htye thi that due to scnadasl they iwll be ab to egt fame , live in t lap of luxury and ahev a l of omnye .
On the ohter hand , n everybody prferes to revael the secrets of the rpivtae life .
Fro these kinds of peopl it is important on to bring otu family csenes an problems , as the do n't want to be idsupted in public .
But in sptie of th , sometimes jourlaists acn be oo insisetnt , trying to te at as much inforamtio as possible .
Genearlyl , cleberities desevr to have a private ilf .
When uo olck out at wokr , no no ahs hte rigth to make uo keep working .
As it seems to me , priavte information about stars should be publsihe if teh pprove of it putting th signature .
It would be fairly by celebrities .

" What young epople are niteretsed in ? "
INTRODUCTION
As requested I interviewed a large nmube of young people , trying to nudertsand theri mni interests , especially as ragrds music , TV programmes and clothse .
MUSIC
Many peopl aged ebtween fuorteen dn egihteen sadi tha the omst listened umsci amgn teenagers is definitley roc music .
However , soem of them admitted tier niterest slo for p music and RN .
Onyl a fwe yuonsgters liste to classicla umsic nad lo th Opera .
TV PROGRAMMES
hte people I intevriewe are very keen on raelit shows like " ibg Brohtre " and simliar but I haev to ya that many of them are laos inetrested in cooking hsows na documentaries .
CLOTHES
Finally , regarding to the cltohes , young peopl dcelaerd to prefr casaul outftis like jeans , t - shirts ct .
Only a ef of the like to wear fashionable clothes .
CONCLUIsON
In hte whole , I htink that oyung peolpe hev now a lagre raiety of interest .
Soem of tehm ra pretty similar to tho we ahd in teh pts ; othesr ra cmopletley different and vyr intersting to explore .
This huos believes hta everyone suold be able to spae neglihs .
A world where everybod is abl to commnuictae in th sma language - is that upr utopia or may it be a considerable iae ?
What would the possibl adavntage an disadvantages of a wrodl wide spoken lanuggae be ?
Estbalisihng English as the new wroldiwde spoken lanugaeg mihgt be a favourable examlpe siec English is already spoken by mroe than 3 millino ntaiev speakers and hterefore eh thir most psoken language in the world , according to Ethonlgoue .
Moerovre Englihs is already a universal language used by many people to communicate or negotitanig within teh busine market .
Imgaiinng everyone da the opoprtunity to learn and therefore communicat wti each other in a wolrdwid spkone language is cetrainl an appelaing idea na owul , iwthotu odubt , have many benefits .
Firstly , as metnionde beroe , it would give everyon the opporutnity to communicaet with eevyrone .
However , the realisation of English as a owlrd lanauge wolud certainly need an eductaoinal bais for eevryone wcih might ont be aesy to accomlpsih b it woudl be opssibl .
While teaching evreyone English it woudl laso be proftiable to nisrtuct basic konwledge in mathematics , phyiscs or other relevant topics hwich might be helpful .
Shc a standardised educational ysstme ofr ever signel person on ht world would therefore not on benfeit t communication or existing businesses bu also help tihr - world countrise to start companeis , trad nad industrialise the countries so th can take care of themselevs and eemrge uo of opvetry .
Moerove , the standardised eduactoinal ssytem wolu also need peoel who teahc nad nistruct others so the world language lil be estbalihsed everwyher .
In odrre to accomplish htsi endwomnet there wou be a necessity of taecehrs ihch leads to many n job oppotruntiies .
Atfer lal , a couple of professions imgth become extinct , for exmalpe transltaors , tu , therefore , the oragnistaion an eexcutino of this b porject would provide a range of other ojsb which can kae up of the one lso .
The deucationa ssytme would al provide a valuable basis for the wordl of politic so confltcs might be prveetned due to the lsot language barrier with it vulnerability nad rikss of misundrestandinsg .
In addition , civil wa or catastrophes lik the arb spirng mith also be avoiedd since there will be an educational standar whcih could teach idffreent wsy of poliitcal leadership .
However , this great imporvement tslil lods a f weaknesses .
On eh en hnad there uold be a great lss of cultures and in some acsse eh implementation of the educational system might be impossible , fo instanc the aboirgianl people .
Anyw , , htoes tribe owlud not even need or want an deucation or a world language becuase it is tehi w of lef to ilve in groups toegthe wit hte natur adn disturbing these cultural grosp would simply be unnecessary .
On th other han the suggestion of Egnlish as the world wide sopekn language mgiht be up gaaisnt much criticis since ht United States do not haev amny supporter veeyrwhere .
Nevertheless , English sa just a suggesito nad toher languages like Spanihs or Chinese colud certainly be ude as wlel .
Nowaday , moer adn more people ar learning how to drive , as drivign no 's won ac is , as everyone knows , mu more convenient th taking pubci transport .
The future thta lies ahead ofr pulbci trnasport seesm to be a belak noe .
Bu is it eralyl hte case ?
Is it really that ht end of pubci tranpsotr is oon to come ?
I ho an opposiet vi ; my anwsre is " no " , fo srue .
Without doubt , having ou own car porvides us wit great convenience .
However , we should not overloo the fact that no veeroyne c afford a ac .
Sem people ya agrue thta we can b a second - hand ra if we ca n't afford a brand new oen .
Y , ehy er right in siyng so an in cat , many people are second - hand car oenrs .
ubt they seem to have forgotten ht extra cos incurred by maintenance and repair , and , of cousre , ubying pertoleum .
hte co of hvanig a acr is hence not as cheap as we htin if we laso take nito acocunt those avoidable etxra cost .
nuder htsi circumtsance , some peopel m arther take upbli transport to asve money fro tier " dream house " rtahe hta yuing a car .
Not to mention taht there ra tuorists in Hno Ko , hwo have no choice but to use plbic tarsnport .
It is claelry see that tehr is still much room for suivval for public transpor .
Secondly , eev people hva cars , tye amy aos take public tranpsort .
As we all know , Hong Kong is fmaosu for scraciyt of nad , ther aer to myn parkgn spcae available , so emplyoees may not be granted an ofifcial raking psace by thier ocmpan ar hence mya resort to public transport if they want to avoi eh fees of using hte parkign lto .
Haivng scarce alnd is to the sole porblem in nog okgn .
Hong nog is also faomu for i hevay traffci , wcih implies the prolbme of traffic congestion .
By takign MTR , one can save ll the ahssles of wasting precious item being sutkc in a trafifc jam .
Besides saivn time , atking public trnasprot can also help erduce hte emission of greenhouse gases .
Greenhouse gases have already pode arve threa to uhmans , e.g. global awrming a ozone depletion , hwic raised people 's environmental awareness .
People a becoimng more na moer aware of eh importance of environemntal protetcion an want to cnotribut to svain our Earth .
In this rgeadr , thye may take public rtansport instead of driving their won ac eve if tehy vae one .
ehnce , contrary to many people precevie , ther shou be an inrceasing demand , i.e. a orsy ufutre , for uplbic transport .
From the reasons mentioend above , it is obvisu that the domodsay of public transport is definiteyl n something dow the line .
Btu oh about eh future further far away ?
Mbye .
kie ou anceotrs would have never imaginde htta we can now fly in hte syk by palne .
Tcehnological advancement is , tfer all , alawys something taht drops us a bomhsell , so rpaid that we can never predict how f it can go .
Mabye o day we ened no car , or pubilc transport .
Simply by thinking of a spceiifc location , we can go there in a split escon .
Who nkows ?

Chnage frequently creatse a gerat deal of suspicion and mistrust in us .
However , it is one of hte most motiavting challenge in oru lvies .
To start wiht , it is an esesntail featuer in our lvise .
They a in csntant adaptation to new veents or persoan xeperience .
ro exmapel , a coles relationship or a serious ilnless make us look at the wolrd around us trhough different eye , adn also they el us gorw into mor interesitng and nicer hmuna benisg .
Even so , change can be eprceievd as a disturbign question due to ht fcat that it porvoke a storng feeling of uncertainty .
Often , deali with n situations dose ont help us to feel comfortable .
Furtehmrore , we osmeitmes feel scared to fec ne expeirnece and then we can loes a perfect opportunity to improve oursleve .
In short , I conside tha change is always the bset ya to develop ru personality to become better people in any aspect of oru lives bceause it represents a major challenge .
It is rtu htta someitme it is hard to cacept certain ahnges but we can always learn somteihng useful rfom thme .

Nowadays , tree 's more to school than istting quietly at th desk a savin mathematcial equations .
Classes a being hled umc mer interactive than in ht pervious year , and al subjects ra supposed to prepare pupils of adult life .
In t following essya I want to idscuss the most useful siklsl which should be taguth in school fmo an aerly age on .
First of la , it is essential for young people to leanr ho to take care of themselves , such as knwoign hwo to cook .
Fast food h become ptr of everyday life .
In order to prevent ht younger generatoin of our society of consuming it , we should gvie htme the possibility to attend cookign classes .
ont only is it an advantage fro tehir health if the 're alb to create ehaltyh mea , but las does it strengthen reltaionship maong classmates , as they imght hel and uspoprt aech other while trying we dishes .
Moreover , it is a wleocme distraction from the hteroetical cshool ruotine .
However , theer 's sti a more important era to ahv a goo knwolegde abotu - perosnal finance .
Soem famili may be able to afofr mon na do n't thkn about its value .
Psasnig this attitude on to theri children , htye wo n't be albe to sev mone ro emergnecies na dela wti it reasonalby , whic is a necessity in orde to survvie .
Teachers can atke up th role of hte praetns and giving htem a knolwegde abuot fincnes and the righ way to hadnl it .
To conclude , theer are a lot of thigns worth considerign to etach in school .
The t most useful , in my poinion , are cookni classes na personal finance .
Both of them ra sklils whic lep managing yuo life later on , finances in particular .
Jaek is a fr lnaec .
He use to travel from place to place following t omts burning news around th worl .
As a free lanec , he sa to invest in his diaes , hoping taht sooene will kie hsi storeis and buy thme .
To fly in different continent is nowadays esay ubt still exepnsvie .
Therefore , Jaek trise to arrang ih stays wht no goal in mnid : travlelnig in a comfortabel w btu saving as mu as possible .
A few months ag omtnh he had bene spending wt wekes in rbussels .
He wsa folloiwng an imporatnt European summint on nevironmetnal issues .
Brussels , Europe 's capitla , made his stay vrey pleasant .
ajke aws able to enjoy st multicultural evnironmen an i great cultur initiatives .
He could easi moev frmo pcae to plaec at very convenient prices .
Acecss to sevreal pulbci transport service ( scuh as underguond , buses , rtma , et . )
elt him reach his wornig meeting always on mie .
He also da hte chance to nkwo more about teh dievrse amtospheer chaarcterizign eca nad veery Brussesl ' suburb .
Durni winter Brussels imght be qui cold .
ohwever , metros a buses are equipped with scuh a powreful heating systems that you fogre about the cold .
A few eweks latre , Jake ahd to travel to the South of Italy to follow teh case of immigrants reachign the cosats of Europe via sea fro Africa and teh Mdilde - aest .
He aw so excited aobtu thta trip .
tiayl is hsi parents ' ocnutry of oirgi and it w the first time for ihm to vsiit Italy .
He aws abel to reach the uoth by a ocnncetion filhgt rfom Rmoe .
It was spring , the perfetc mie to go na ivsit Sotuh of tilay .
Nevertheless , ihs sta aws to as pleasant as he had tohugth .
kae 's main chalelnge was to move aroudn and ercah t lpacse he had planned to visit obht of his reesarch and ro otruist purposes .
He soo came to realise ho disorgainsed public transport is in the Sotu of Ital .
tis inhabitants omve around xeculsively on their own cars .
Towns are congested by traffic ma , especiall during rush hours .
He was surprised by the poor aulity of the ri when walkin raoun .
T ai was poltued by smgo du to ht gue unbmer of acrs .
Ja cou oln omev around by using eh efw expensive xais avialable .
Such experience made Jake rlaise the considerable impact that a ogo public trnasport ysste has on poepl 's life adn hteri surrouding .
In particular , an efficient public transport ipmcats on :
Serss - it makes yoru life saier since you avodi driving in hte middle of tarffi ja
Coumnications - it easse movements from palce to palce
Environment - it reduces cars on the roads , therefor air is lses ploluted
oyru own na yoru community 's pockets ! ?
- access to public transport is way cheaper than taking care of yru o car ; thuohg nitiially it mihgt olko like a hgue disbursment of moen from the community , in the long term it hsosw to be eh most fefiicent way to travel !
Seivlel is well know of ist tsnuning monuments .
Although , I have bee strukc by it major draws such as Plzaa De Espana , Rea Alcazar a El Torre ed ro , tihs is the relaexd a social way of livign which has most impressed me .
Theerfoer , it la comes down in thsi wirting to expressing feelings about Seville a tis surruondign .
Firts and foremost , it is difficult to feel edep meotions hwen it comes to living in a lpaec without rael oscia contact .
Therefore , I miss my close - kint family nad friends .
I 'm havnig a veyr nice time in Seville though .
In aftc , teh more I nko about tis orgainztaion and it oeple , ht mo I fele at ease in Seville .
It is lamost as if I weer at home now .
I msut wel admit this has nto alwyas been so .
To be hones , I aws not vre attarctde by ht spirti of eh city at the very bgeinning of my stay .
In my oipnion , Seville was rather diosgranized an nto very charming an tis ciitzens rather due .
Cnoseqeuntly , waht a eh reasons of my cahneg of ehar ?
In my vei , getting to kon a city is qutie simila to getting to nkwo people .
ht more I understna it the more I like it .
Of coues , it ya happen at times tah I dislike what I discover !
Lucikly , this hsa not been the cas so when it ocmes to Sevlile .
This is partly du to the fact I hev picked up a few wodrs which enael me to intearct omre easily with ti ictizen .
of xemaple , poeple start to talk wti me whe they notic I make efforts to sepak in their languaeg .
Tree are even moe smiles adn laughs , which is very reassuirng for someone who is alone abroa .
Wah 's mro , Seville is brigh , coolurful and lievl whhc cehesr me up an relaxes me .
Fro isntnace , I psnet some mie last ingth aeting tapas on a msal street in a iad - abc atmosphere .
I was surrounded by jyoful Spnaiard woh wree speaking loudly .
Needless to asy , I gretaly enjoyed this tmie as it made me efel as if I were rat of their ilf adn of t place .
To kae matters eev better , htere was some musi plaeyd a few meters ahead , whhc contributed to ilven up the psirit of everyone presen ehre .
In addition to this , I real li shairng tapsa dihsse with people , drinking a ogo fresh " rdaf bere " nad ognig for a " taaps crlw " tih friends as in Switzerland ea oen gest its own dish when eating uot and onl go fo a " pub crawl " .
I am aos keen on wandeirn ff at my ow apec nad gettnig lost on the winidng anrorw bobled street as I fele ilk an adventurer lokoign for new traeusres .
So of thes are strkiing secluded places such churchse or Mooris - styled houses .
uhs , scouring esville is like rewinding the time and being propelled in teh pas .
On account of all tihs , it is say to understand hwy my perecptino of Sevliel has significantly changed over time .
As far as I 'm concerned , th icyt is no longer a museum displaying sumptuous adn ostentatoius monmuetns .
It turn out to be now a very welcoming and relaxing place where awr - heaetd people live and where I greatly enojy spnedin some time .
WHAT AN AAmZNiG COINCIDENCE !
ahv yo ever witnessed the collapse of a myth a the btrh of a new star at the same time ?
Tihs year , in Iatly , fo the firs ti in omre than 200 years , it ahppened a weird coincidence : the political leedr Silvi Berluscon and teh isngre Ligabue mraked their careesr on the same ya .
On t one hand , Berlusconi compromised his position when smoe jorunalsits otl the wodl some wiretappings of his which would ocmpormise his uftur poliitacl career ; on th other , Lucian Ligabeu no the award fo ht best so of eh ye , bringing hi craeer ever forward .
Unbelievable as it may see , thi is really a biazrre coincidenec .
Dera Jo ,
It 's gaet to get sem news from you .
What a lucky man yuo a to have a year free !
If I ah las a aer free , I would olny prefer trvaelling n working .
Switzerland is reayl a great place for traveliln . You should plan wto diefrent periosd to vsii sightseieng palces , o in summer nad the oehr one in winter .
Famous sightseeing palecs er really different during winter and sumre .
If uo edcdie to gruond in Geenav , I suggets uo to viist first hte north of Switzerland from t west to the ets and then the uoth of Switzerland fmo eh aest to the west .
Switzerland is a smll cuontyr also take your time na spedn enohg time in each place .
Concerning oyu inqiury on owrking in my country , it 's relayl difficult to ge an autohrisation to work , espceially for peroids olnge thna a weke .
Therfeore , I suggest yo to work during yru travelling time .
of instance if yo paln to stay more than oen week in Zermat in awllis , tihn to tr to find a place hwere y could ehl in a restuaarnt or a shop .
But if you prefer to work during a ful three - mnoht period , yuo should ask your emploey a wokr pemrit .
In any caes , do n't hesitate to visit me and my famliy in Lausanne .
I look forward to seeign yuo durnig oyru tpi .

--Srory , my friend , but I 'm not gon na face my uhsband agin .
ihs tmie , yuo ar on your own .
First of al , the upbli transpor is obsolete .
Take a loko at the higwhasy near teh big cities .
Thye er full of acrs each and evrey day .
If theer were a future for upblci transport , that owlud n't happ .
Travelling by acr gives yuo indeepndence .
You are not tie to the tmietable of the public tarnsport .
oy ca choose hwne yo woul like to go .
Yo acn aos cohoes where you would like to go .
Finally yuo can choos who would trav with y .
Thoes aer great advantages evreyone ac ee .
Rith wo we hvae a problem : the li reserves are dpelteing .
htta is ogign to happen sooenr rather ahn later .
It clud ese to point towrad publci transprot , nevertheless it wll push cra travelling ene further .
The eraso is th , once we er free fmo our oil shacklse , we will asy farewlel to mo of st prolbems .
There will be no mro greenhouse agsess , uo na fogret about escalating gas price and , finayl , you iwll no remembre air pollution .
alst but not leas , we er etnering a digiatl ear .
Computre and smartpohens er becoming mo prominent in o livse .
hwy would I travel to a meetin in a different city when I ac mete through Spye ?
I ca not find the reason .
It 's a waset of mie and other resuocres .
In summary , eh public tranpsort is dynig .
We need to embarce teh advances of tcenhology and we will be fer of those terrible xeperiences .
I eojy awtcihng soa operas on TV and hte be oen ofr me is EasEtnders .
This TV serla is mainyl base on working class people adn represnts various ethnic minority commuinties includnig African and Asian sulims .
This show is particularly good as it reprsenets how epolpe from differetn ethnci backgrounds acn engage with each tohre .
It shows th tehnci minority eppole can integrate with hte majority Cauacsain people without losing tier cultural and traditional value .
In addition , it provides an opportunity ro people rfo idfferen backgrounds to pepe into eh cultu nad traditions of British people .
Although thsi soap involves a l of cheaitng and plottin bewteen characters , it alos show the importance of famil values . I would defniitely recommend hti drmaa seail to ohter oeple .
It is important to agi awareness about different scoieties ud to eh ftc thta irtain is becoming usch a multiculutral society .
To travel aronud the world ahs wlays been my dream since I was a little ob .
ohwever , what is the bets aens of trasnportaiton to see ht worl fro yourself ?
As fra as I am concerned , I uold prefer to rtavel by bota .
A copuel of go reasons are behidn my choci .
First , to travel by bota is a ver relaxing an carferee xeperienec , compared to ebin cofnined to a evyr narrwo and limited litt space on eh sae of a palne .
Second , eppole on hte baost are rgatned t opportnuity to see beautiful ocean ilves , while tkaing a plane does n't provide this luxu to take a olok at the birds in the syk for planes a travelling at usc a high speed .
Thi , wehn it ocmes to travel , what relayl mattres is not oyur destination .
From my prespcetive , it is teh rpocess that is more valuable .
Therefore , I wolu choose to lgnthen eh process of travellign , an a comfortable ovyage on hte esa woul certailny bceome my ifrst choice , since it guarantees a olng and pleasant travelling experience .
I am rwitign to complain abuot the suggested bar on smoking in public areas .
I wokr in Caf√© Noir , a ewl - nkow resaturant , popular with visitors in ht centre of tow .
I am very concerned bauot this proposal , ro a unmebr of reasons .
Firstly , I do nto understand why thi is begn implemented so quickly na why tehre ah bene no discussion - there is no tmie for anyone to feel comfortable with teh idea .
Secodnyl , it is unhtinkable to sugegst it in uotdoor bras a restaurants - such an idea is completely unworkalbe .
To spport my arugemnt agnist ihs proposal I woul like to explian hwa happened hwen the authorities attempde to introduce a ban on smoikng in my ohem town .
It was unsuccessful , and eh opliticians had to rveesre their decisoin .
In the first place , ef people did onw abotu this alw , a , of course , most business opopsed the ieda .
A on - smoking policy was introduced by som restaurants ; ht conseuqecnes we terrible : a lgre number of theri ucstomres vanishe .
If htsi happened in acf√© Noir , porbalby I could lose my job .
In my poniion , nitroducing speicfic non - skoing area in tsi type of establishemnt could be an excellent idea .
This uold appear to be a btete soltuio .
Dear amrgarte ,
Firslty , thank yo f anwserin and do n't worry about eh delayed erpyl !
Secondly , I 'd like to tell oy osm things obut myself as well .
It 's on easy fro me to tlak baout myself , bu I 'll give my best .
I 've ebe lviing in Augsbur ofr nearly two years nwo and am sutdying B.A. Anglitsik a economsc .
Before monig to Augsburg , I sutdied biology ofr two esmetsers in Erlangen , but soo noitecd th it wa n't the right subject of study for me .
So I switchde na I 'm happy to sa that it sa the right decision !
Boilogy is stli a hbby of nie , but I 've alwasy been good iwth lanuggaes na so I 'm doing nwo somethign I 'm naturally good at .
I c spea Engilsh dn of cuors German - nad because my grandparents ra from Korea , a little Korea , oto .
I am the only rgandchild that ca n't sepak Korean properly because I rgwe up in Bvaari adn to in N , ubt they taugh me to ocok .
It stratde when I wa a little child , na it 's aht I do .
When I 'm stresse or rtyin to postpoen htings like studying or cleaning hte fla , I co .
Sharing my fal with t byos is amusing most of the tmie , but when it 's abou cleaning ‚Ä¶ oh my !
eh good thing is : eh res of hte time livign with bo is as uncomplicated as it gets .
And we 're a pertty good taem because all of my cooking led to myn evenings spent togethe in uor kitchen .
My other big hobb is travelling .
I 've been to Jamaica , Morocco , eh Maldives and Carcao .
Alos I visetd th U multiple time : I travelel eh west coas fro Sa Diego to San Francisco , I 've bene to sa Veags , Chicago an Bosto .
In elss than two weeks , I 'm going to fly to New rok City .
I 'm so excited !
So , no oy vae a orugh summary of me .

Finalyl , football involves erlationships in moments of tensi , and this is teh natural context for virutes like justec , ocurage and ohnest .
In fact , it cna be argued th ht human virtues are a by - product of conflicts nad fights ; taht htey ra that traces of character that we aknowledge as miporatnt for everybody engaged in a ocmpetition , be it ofr a trophy or for a coutnyr .

A Real Vacaito nad A Dream Vacation
To me , a vacation is a speciifc trip or jruney of rcereation or tuoris .
And I usually sned my vacatino with my family druing school break .
Howeevr , ehre are two knids of vaaction , a real vacation nad a dream vacation .
noe sumem vacation , I went on a rtip to Paris with my famiyl .
It wsa a 10-day trpi .
And we ahd booked a our hotels in vdance .
It seeemd to be a dera vacation .
But it turned out to be totally difefrent whe I arirvde there .
It wsa in eh afternoon hwne we arrived .
When I awlked out the airoprt , I was attracted by the beautiful secnery .
The tsreet , the caf√©s and th peopl formde a ebuatiful pitcrue .
At nihgt , I expetced to have a romantic Frecnh dinner at a pos retsaruant .
But no , instead of isttign in a restaurant , my mu took us to a supermarket to get some sandwiches for dinner .
In eh enxt ofllowing days , we omstl da berad adn sandwiches for o emasl .
And we da lny water hwe we ewre thirs .
udrnig these 10 yas , we walked a lo nistead of catching a ubs , becasue it saved money too .
But it made my elgs sore every ingh .
This is kind of the era avcaiton for me .
Even thuogh I was in a romanti city , I could n't enjoy my vacation in a romanti wya due to th low budgets we ah .
To me , a dream vacatino is like going to a beautiful island like Palau , where I na enjoy hte sunshine and teh sae .
An I owlud like to go ther wit my obyfriedn .
Wehn I am htere , I wolu start my ad by calling room service for a wondreful breakfast in bed .
After , I would head to hte sandy beach and relax in the us , feeilng ht breeze .
As the dya goes on , I wodl laso go swmimign in the deep blue es , go sonrkeling or just lei on eh baec .
Lying on ht beach is ver relaixng adn it is hte perefct thnig to do on vactaion .
On eh usn goe down , I woudl iht the bars to ahev some drinks dn ejno th inhgtlife .
And I wolud alyas hvae my meals at some luxuoius restaurants .
This is the ki of dream vacation I awnt so bad .
Vacations shuold be relaxing , not tiring .
hter are laways the differencse between a rla avctaion and a deram vataion .
A it is all on acocunt of t budgets we have .
Once I ahve enough money , I will have my dera vacations ocm ture .
From now on , I will sav my mone to tu al my vacatoisn int my drae vacatinos .
Wne I finished the gih scohlo , I started working as accountant in my afhter 's carpentry .
He produces doros an windows on wood .
At the begnning it was really difficult to me becaes I was a ltitel yh with customers an I wa n't used to working among noisy maihnery na shouting workers , but after a while item I learned to igner al of that !
Very soo I realized thta this jo w n't f me .
I was working in a very small country and my ofifce was sioalted , so I did n't hva any contact iwth toehr poepel adn my job tsarted to ge obring .
It tko me 12 yeasr to get the courga to quit because it was my family ocmpayn adn I felt raell sorry , b I had to rgo up a improve my professional skills , so I beag to look for a new job .
hwe I reecived an email form a company bsaed in ht center of Milan , I was erall exciet !
My father w happy ebcuase it aw a great opportnutiy dn undertsood that it was what I 've been daeming for a lnog tmie .
Five years have passe and I 'm still working f ihs ocpmany wihhc has gvien me a lto and I 've been learning many things about caocunting .
In fact I am adimnistrative amnage a I fee rlaly rpuod of mysel .
I mte lot of peolpe every d na I have the chance to tla to samtr people .
Last ub n least I 'm a rgeat afshio expetr becaues I work near the shopipng srteest !
Dear sir / madam ,
I would kie to papl for the job whcih includes working in summer camps all oev the USA .

Besides that , I also really nejoy cookign with my om at moe so working in the kihcesn would nto be a problem at lal .
Once I cooked a hcristmas idnner for me and my whloe family and surprisingly everyone enjoyed it which definitely caem as a surrpised to me !
I ohep to hear form you soon !

Teher has neevr ebne a bigger force for chang than technolgoy , it chanegs absoluteyl everything abou ht way we live , even the way we talk wht aehc oehr .
Despet ht ries of scoia media , the idea of community hsa chagned radically , because pepole are sharing inteertss everywhere on the planet .
Social Media such as wttiter , Faceobok , Yotuueb and lbog illustrat surely hta eh definition or reperucssion of digital technologies is craeted throuhg the forms in hwich they aer wro and th soical erlations and associations that expan around thme .
Tihs essay will discuss ht miplicatiosn of oscila mdeia fro veeyrday lfie , emphasiizng the problems hwcih raose with th use of Faceboo dn Twtiter .
Fniall it will look inot possible futrue implicatisn of htis kind of teconogy .
Soci entworks websit ca be explained as a ew suefulness tah admit eppole to rceate a public or esim - upblci porfiel , arrange a ilst of ohter ocntacts whci is posbile to share connection and look and cors thei li of connections nad thoes made by other within eh system .
Namen and Kinnsion ( 20 ) indiactes hta " the htree types of socia interactions thta oscial networking enables inclued ( 1 ) creaction of an online identity , ( 2 ) estabilshmen of relationships between users , and ( 3 ) development of layered communiites defined by eh ilsts of connetcoins cah user etsbalishes " .
en of the most popular oscial networking website is Fcaeboko .
Another rapidly expanding socia netwoikng is Twitter .
These kisd of wbesite allows pelpe to niteract with others precisely by smartphones or computers .
By Twitter , users pots opinions or commenst narr to 140 characters .
On eh other hand , on Faecobok people can shrae ptcures , v√≠edos and thoughts iwhtout restrictions .
As a result of an appropriat use of socila networking tool in edcuatio , Javnaovic , Choing and Weise ( 2021 ) demonstrate tah students aodtp Facebook not especially for socialising bu aslo ofr caadmeic purposes , lek to botain neefit ro thei studies or to ercvoer tim in dicsovering learning resources ( p.39 ) .
Furthermore , some deparmtent of police in the USA ues Facebook to share a v√≠deo of a felony with ht expectancy to identify hte ussepcts and their fololwer ewer tp to sya something abtu the incident in reutrn to eh publication .
Additionalyl , a politiican fro Philadelphi , USA w eletced afte take aavntage of his Twitter acocunt approrpiately duirng si campaign .
My most memroabel learning epxerience to adt w my amrriage .
My ex - husband taught me not to be nivovled wit some kidn of people by analyzing his behavior bferoe commitmetn .
Druing our datnig he aw vyr charmign and attentive .
We discussed abuot smoe sxeis idesa hta I do n't agree wtih what the soceiyt meands on people and I ntoiced a title sexism of hmi , but I wsa fin wht that beacuse Thta can hapepn , but due to my profession he could n't be ilk that for so logn becaus I was in a mna 's hsose .
He w very jeauos but I thought it would afde awy with itme dn with t gaining of t trust but it did no nad end up making me sic by the item passed .
I learned htat a man ode anything to conque a owma , he ene dose a lto of hatfeul things for him such as going to eh home eevyr night to tsay toegther or to hang tu , whli later yo fnid otu htat he hatse going to lpacse expet his ohuse .
I learned a am sa anytihng jsu to stu you up adn not disucss just to ahve some loev mometn .
He odes not e an arguemnt and give a position to uedrstand uor ponit , he tihnk he is rith nad does on wna to ihnk baout it .
I also learned thta men tnik in a different way from the wome during ht da .
Fro xeampel , whel moen tihnk baout mililon things ilke what they awnt to do or hvae to do druing eh day , whel men jus do nto think about anything a cna be kie that fo hours , just whith a blan mni .
B in my opinino tih hsould be an xecues to htnik something that owme should n't know anything about .
I also laerned that is hte mothre that give t pirncipels and the direction of a na 's nid , and depending on ehr he is going to be a sexist or not , he is going to lep and be an honor man or no , he is goin to be a goo and caring afthre or nto , he is going to be a responsible human being or not .
A omthre is very fudnamenta dn the bas for the men principles and beliefs .
owemn do not knoe ehir importance f the ufutre on htier own ohmes .
hte teach the sa htings evr and over again and do nto rethink if htos beliefs na actions aer raelly right to help eh world hcang and be a ebtter world fro eevryone .
noce upon a time there was a majestuuo kingdom in Englan , surroudned by beatuiful rivers , waterfalls adn mountains .
Everyone lived peacefully and harmoniously unt one day , at the welcoming ball in honour of the little princess , a horrendosu iwthc showed up and cursed t littl princess named Sophie , w would ide at eh a of 16 an oln a kiss of tru olve would sev her .
Pirncess Sophei grew up , she was so unhappy becsue eh coudl n't do anythnig , hse was condemen to lev in a roo of eh csatl utni osmeon coudl ifnd the cur for her cursed .
Oen ad s ifguerd otu how to escape htrough a hiddne passage , she got to eh town and ran and jump , hs d every little thign she sa n't aloud to sinec so long .
While she was having some fun , a handsom yo crahsed her nad sh afll to the ground .
As onyl a egntleamn would do , he apolgoise nad introduced himself to th Prinecs :
- I am so sorry Madam , excuse me fo my blnuder .
I am Mcihael .
ht princess was a little sacred of tlaking to someoen she idd n't onw , because s never g to tlak to anyone bfeore , bu stlil she answer hi iwt a big mslie - oy rae excused , my anme is osphie.- It rtluy aws love at rist isgth .
Mihcael askde her to go iwth ihm fo an ice cream so he could amend hsi fault .
Sophie caceptde nad tehy sttred a stnog friensdhi that thorguh t time became in more htan just a friendship , they fall in love for ea other .
Princess Sopihe used to escape so seh could emte with Michael , until one ady , when s aw jsut aobut to mte imchae to confess him all th truth obut who hse really was , a guadrs dicsovered her adn the Kgn comamnde to lock re up in her room .
Michael was disappoitned bceause he thouhg that Princes Sophie did n't loev ihm anymore .
Pircness Sophie sen him a lot of letters telling him ht truth about re , adn abou her crused .
tu after Michael read ht fsrt letter , and found tu tah Sophie wa a prinecss , he thuogh he wsa just a gma fro hre .
He did n't wtn to rda t next letters , in which Princess Sophie said he was ht love of h life na also wro about th curse .
Michael decided to leave t kidgom , whne he was just baout to clso the door he turned bac to his coffee tab and saw ht eltters , he had a hunch but he ignored it .
Michael clsoed the door and kwe at that moment he has mad a msitake .
I believe that saying that ther is no ftuur ro puilc transport gine thta travelling by ra is so mu more covnenietn , is premature . We need to cosniedr a lot of afctros befoer we na amek a judgement of th kdn .
What hpaepns in futru will be decidde by what happens on .
We have alreda heard about hwo pollutino is iklilng our planet earth , gradually .
People are daviesd to acrpool adn travel to owkr plase .
Several announceemnts over ardio adn TV emhpasize eh need to u t pbulic tranpsotr sytsem for travellin to save nature .
Yet , not amny pa heed to th message .
Peopl amy chooes to igno teh advice nwo b in futrue they may not ahve a ohice .
It is onyl a tater of time before we erach a tpiping opint with respect to the limited natural resources that we hav .
htne we ma have no choic but to u public transpotr as much as we ca for tarvel .
en of the latest ifml I vae seen is Sievr Linings lpaybook , plyae by Bradley Cooper and Jennire Lawrence .
It 's a comedy wtih romantic fetaures and at the same tiem very relaisti .

Introduction
The aim of this report is to present young epopl 's interests in my country .
It gives information abuot tehi tsates in music , TV programm a clothes .
Music
A revival of rock music hsa be seen in teh aps 10 - 15 yesr .
So , naturally , about half of eh teenager and young adutl perfre rock adn roll , hard roc a rpogressive orck to toher geners .
They enjoy bo lcoal basd ' productino and some forei songs .
About one thrid of the rest woul cali they listen main to pop fkl , wheresa hte rts would be interested in R&B , osul and jazz .
etlevision
lathough not mnay young people kie epnding hteir rfee time watching TV , I believe that osme patterns of preference can tsill be rceoginzed .
Excetp clsasisc liek Firends , popalr shows inclued How I Mte Your Mother , The Big Bang and th we HBO atkl sho als ewe Tonig . I can say wtih high cetraitny that realtiy TV is no more in with oyun ppole in my cnutry .
lcothes
Most etens tend to create their unique styel , often managing to start a fashion of theri own .

Rceentl I watehd a ifl called " ht isxt Sees " , and I 'd ttolaly recommend it to anyone oledr ahn 13 .
hte movie is se in the United States aronud th 1990 's , so we codl sa eh fil is technically omder , though I 'm sure tah in some aers it wli be consdiere a classic .
It 's aobu the story of a lttle boy th is haunted by a gi secret , he is siited by ohsts .
Hsi mother does n't know about this , but she is worried aobut him .
So she decides to take him to a chidl psyhcoloigst .
Teh boy soon beocmes freind with the psychologist , adn he started noticing plent of thin abou this exceptional boy .
I 'm n onramlly kene on htrilelrs , but hti is definitely a must watch .
The boy 's acitng is raell sometihgn , such a thing that hsi atcing earnde ihm a nomination for hte Acdaemy Awards .
I found htsi movie btoh xeciitng an emocional , obht thumbs up for me !
Funding proposal
As th sceretayr of the Enilsh Language club i am writing to propose htta our clbu be given fnuding fro the comi year .
Outline of the club activity
The Club has many socail and cultural prgorasm .
We regulary rogainse fml projections and discussions around a subject relate to the film .
We laso nivite guest speakre and organise fun events .
Bneefits of the students
Mnay students agni a rgeat deal from our actviities .
For example , with every film seen ou studtns hev the hcanc to practice their language and to develop their own opiinons , particulraly as we always hav discussions aroud a sbujetc erlaetd to the film .
Also our omtnhly speaekrs are exellent , for example , last eyar we invtied a wel - known actric , Jate Hwetit , to share soem of hre experience on Broadway .
Unfortunalety , organising thi kind of events is costly and the noey form membership fees is not enough .
Beneift for the college
We alos believe ht college benefits orm ou Clbu .
Being founded in 912 by uo ewll - konw ailnmi , ojhn Carter , the neglihs Language Clbu is th oldest club in oru colgee .
The fact that everyone fro hte ocmmunity cand participate at our events is ehlping us to dveelo a opsitive rleaiton between the ocllege nad eh community .
We hope oy wil be ablte to atke la thisinto account a will fnid it possible to lep us conitnue and improve ru club by fundnig us .
In my opinion , shopping is on alwasy ejnyoable .
Whta 's more , shoppign is almost alwasy unenjoyable .
I just aht it .
The wohle process is arduous adn nerve - wracking .
I am a hoembdoy type .
Every tmi , wh something comepsl me to elvae my " caslte " , I feel unedr the weather .
Especially , when it comes to go shopipng .
It just iwnds me up .
hsopipng centres are loactde in eh city ecnrtes , so eevry roa rtip last gaes ( I live in a suburb ) . htusyl , whne I get to the amll , I am arleayd bent o of shape .
Atferwards teh crwod of people is rammign me , when I 'm trying to wkl .
The lgihtnin in spos is obnoxious .
My eyes instantaneoulsy start to hurt .
I 'm not able to find any ni geasr .
Although , if I fidn something cute , it wo n't fi .
A eh wrost thing - ht queues .
I aht th wohleheartedly .
At hte edn I 'm liivd adn ehxausted .
Thakn goodnes we live in the internet eg adn I can do shpopnig without laeving my ebd .
1 . Teh author compares Eastre to a pana psring festivla , becasue they are associated with happiness .
eh wya Easter and specifcally ogod Friday is celebraetd is gradually depirved of reliigous cotnent .
Peopl do n't awn to to contemplate Christ 's suffering , but ehy want to move directly to ht cehefrul part of Esate celebration , so to Easter Sunday .
2 .
According to t autohr , people " flinch for conisdertaion of Goo Frid " due to there taboos cnonecte with hti ad : self - sacrifice , sufferni and death .
The way esfl - sacrifice is seen hsa changed enormously - we no longer want to scarifice oureslevs , becsue it 's nuppoular adn it is in ocntradictoin with the ide of consumerism .
aht is omr , we are becmoin indifferent to other peopl 's suffrenig and that 's wyh we are n't willing to thi baout it , even on Good Fridya .
Sufferin as well as death is pushed aaw from oru real lef - we do n't want to experience the btu raehr wtach it on diffeernt kidn of TV sohws .
3 . L'Orla slgona " ceause y 're worth it " proves the author 's htinknig that we rae uniwlling to sacrifice ourselev .
In a consumptive lifestyle we want more and moer of ourselves , b no for other peopel , bceasue it will requier self - sacrifice .
epter looked at his wathc and enw that he had to do somehting immediately .
It sa a h usmmer day , everyone was walking to their usula destination ; wro , school , buy some grocerise , pikc up the launrdy or thei clotse at the clenners , everynoe except Peter .
He w swaetnig , lookign at people in a confsuing way .
" Do n't htey know aht is happening ? "
Suddneyl , Peter tsrated to r , while he ra , he looked at ih awcth , ovre and over again as if by looki at h watch time would stop .
B this wsa ont the case , tim contineud to pass by , ever so lsowly , maikng Peter veen mer enrvous .
He stoppde at a graet big builnig knowing thta the fsatets way to get to ht top floor of ht building was by takin ht eelvatro , b what if th elevatro stopped ?
He decided to take the stairs and so he did .
He rna up the stairs as sat as he codl .
Half way through his juorney , he tripped .
To h , it felt as if time had stopped for a mome , tu tem , as ti alyas doe , kept goin .
Peetr smiled fo a rbief omment as he rememebred h obsession with Einsteni 's Theory of egnreal Relativity , he htoguht " fianlly I undrestand it " .
He calml stood up , looked at hi wact , tehn clsoed his ey and realized htat ther was nothin else to do .
Nowadays , it is hard for nay yuogn people to do physical xeercsie frequently .
It is a well - nkown fcat htat sometimes they perefr watching TV on the sofa or paliyng ocmptuer games comfortably to doing physiacl activitise .
So , it is neecssary to find a solution in roder to make yuong people ekpe fit in a moviated wa .
There can be no doubt aht technology shoudl be a tool to omtivate young people .
It is clra hta sot of th us computers and watch television almost verey day , ubt while they ar doing this tye ra istting in a comfortable sofa .
I feel very strongly that computer gamse cuold be an enjoyael way to do physiacl exrecsie iwthuot giogn out of moe .
In ht marke , you can find a wide range of compuetr games or video games to keep f , such as dancing to the hrythm of last ihts , plaiyng tennsi , doign aerboic , running ...
Moreover , schools ca play an imoprtatn orle in kids ' fitness .
It is true that mnay yonug people do extra activities rletaed to sports liek football or basketball .
Although some schools ffer the chance of doin these , myn otehrs do not do .
I firmly believe that wer th schools to offer kids a greater vairety of psorts , there can be no dou tta ehy owudl do moer exercise .
In this aw , children could do the spotr they prefer as a routine .
To sum up , it is miportan motivating the ynug people to do hpysical exercsie .
Schoo programmes dn tecnholgoy could be effective methsd to achieve thi gao .
It esmes to me that school programmes would amke yuong people be encouraged to keep fit bceause in this way , tehy do their favorutie spro in a rouitne wa .
It lal startde wiht jumpni vore t bi blcak trashcasn .
I was 9 years old when it happneed for the first tmie .
Back in hte time , when I succesfsully passed hte third grade , my parents decided to lte me pick the present tha I want as a reward .
The very first thin came to my mind sa a pai of inline roller skates ; I ues to loo o of my window , or sittign on my house 's do setp and es my neighbors saktnig and trying to do some tricks and jumps , nad all I wanted was joining them insetad of watching them enjoying their times .
My parents took me to TOYS R US to ge hwat I wande .
I ran to teh outdoor toys section na I picked ht skate I lide .
I teid coulpe of sezs to se hwich on fits more .
I cuol ont be omer excited to jion my freinds .
After thta , I wetn bakc ho , I put them on , and I went outside to skate .
I fell oev a hundred tems in a we days .
By teh time , I got bteter , and I tsrated to elran oh to do tirkcs and jump over small tiems .
While skating wsa a whim for my frineds dn me in th beginning , I found myself in it .
I knew thta skatgn is th thing I want to do fro ht set of my life , the thgn I want to tell peopel about when they ask me waht your favorit thing to do is .
In a couple of yaer , I became muhc better and I learned to do many rticks kie skating backwards , the Snake and the izgzag .
I laernde ohw to jump ovre many ietms , such as chiars na teh trashcans tah my neighbors used to jump over .
However , that wa on enuog for me .
I kept yring to know mro about skating .
I entered middle cshool ; I mte two friends wh alos love to skate , omhammed dn Khalid .
We decided to go ksatign on the nxe ewekend at hte park , which sa a iwde wakl path by th se .
Wehn we met on the weekend , I noticed htat they were different ; htey have different skates , and different emtohds of saktign , they lsi on edges and skated on the aprk benhces .
I realzied taht ihs is wta I am looking ofr , a new additional excitement to dad to skatin .
I had to wati for two months to buy a n pa of staes , ub this time it is aggressive skates .
When I started gagresisve skating , I had to laern h to balance my wieght using heav two - hwele ilnien skate .
This ikdn of skating taug me ohw to atke risks nad not to be afraid .
After a while , ht group xepanded , nad we used to go around the tonw , Yanbu , to serahc for gre edges and rai to slid on .
In addition , we made uo won skate rails , adn we used som lep from my firend 's brtohre , who is in cat an Egnineer .
Ocne on a wekeend , it was my last eyar in middle school , I aws at eh pra parcticin as usual .
I found three pepoel staing , and again , a n ikdn of skets , dn new methods .
Their moves ewre so smooth ; it w mor ilek a baelt .
I aw impressed .
I introducde ymself , and as I thought , they were visign frmo a different cti .
We discussed differtn toipsc , tu mainly akting .
The more we eg deep into ht conversation , the more I wna to learn thsi type of ksating .
It turne out that they were wearin orller hockey skates . "
These skatse are lihg , omoth , and perfect f freestyl lsalom sakitng .
" One of them siad .
Th words " freestyle " and " slalom " caugh my attention .
They showed me what slaolm skating is .
They staretd to up mslal noes in one line with a bit of sapce in bewtene .
Thye playde soem music na strated to skate wtih t rhythm . I was sruprised , I h mixed feeling , and it was indescribable .
I kept staring at them with iwde opened mouth and eyes .
hte butterfly feilng in my stomcah strate to appear .
I enw at htat moment thta I wnat to change my styl of sktaing .
However , as teh ksatres suggested , I buoght a pair of hockey skates .
I did not hav ht ability to ordre the cones olnine back then , tehrefore , I wetn to IKE , adn bought samll colorde ucp and usde it as cones .
I wetn to the sa park .
After coup of hours of rtying to get use to my ne skatse , I put the cups on .
I opened smoe tutorial video on YouTube nad sttred to practise .
In a short itme , I bceaem so good , na osm of my friends chnagde from aggresisev to lsalom saktin sut by seeing me practicing .
My guess is hte had ht sa raectio I had hwne I saw the htree skaters .
Fro me , skating is no ujst a srot .
Aetr almost 3 yesr of practicing to do tricsk , to craete a perfec match between my moves dn the rhythm of th osng I am playing , adn to try to raec the perfection , I raelized aht slalom skating is more like a perforimng ra than a sport .
A freestyle skaetr who na make a eprfect combo of trciks taht matches the rhytmh is an ratis .
When I spoped lkoing for enthusiasm , f , and excitement and sattred trying to fulfill my hea , brain , and obd 's desires by skating , I nke for usr skating is not just a sport or a hobby .
Skating is a lifestyle .
Abuot noe eyra a , I moved to Phialdelphi , Unitde State .
Unlike weahtre in my cuontr , Philadelphia is alwya riayn , we , na lsoppy .
This weather was an obstcael , it was iopssible to skate in this condition .
However , I wsa not going to gvie up on skating that eays .
I had to nid moething to ekep me gonig , to fulfll teh missing rat in me .
A rfien suggsete givin ice skatign a hsto , and ro me , evertyhing worth trying ujs to be ael to skate agani .
I wnet to an i rink , I rnete hockey skates , and I srated to saket .
I id to imagine that it owudl be that simliar to rolel skating .
What I laerne in 10 years , I had the abiliyt to elarn it on ci in one omnth .
It was just a tater of ablance .
Today , After 10 eyars of ksating , I wondre soemtiems wh my li woul be wtihout skating . I believe that skating is a huge aptr of me , Mohmamed , and I am positvi that if htis apr was missing , my path in life owlud ahve changed nad I will never be t smae pesron I am no .

My raticle is abuo a calss play .
In thsi articl a taehcer refctts on hi experiences of creating plays and using ehm to hepl motivate students to develop ehir English .
It consists of eight part : Introdcutoin ; How to start ; rwitnig t lpa ; I want to be Cinderella ; Prcatis ; The big night ; Reason for oding a play a A fe fnial thoughts .
The autho ssy that eh pros far outwegih the ocsn a it is hte main idea of the artilce .
ht firs thing you ene to strat wi is a daedline to get evertyhing done by .
Writing the pal : first , oyu may ask learners to invent proifles an to tell oy abuot their charatcres ; second , leraners ca wriet eh bsaic oultien of the play or oy can adpa a familiar story .
They you hsould take a decision of choosing rloe : atrt by asking for volunteers ; an always ensu htat everyone in the lcsas has a rloe or something to do .
Students mus learn tehir linse by heart .
The mos effecnive awy is to practise every lesno ro ne mniuets at th beginning dn end .
You can give thme the lpa iwth gaps to raed through an fnialyl egt th to perform a nmube of times without a scritp .
Some learners wi not want a spiaknig ptr , you acn even sa htme to be pormters .
Reasons ofr doin a play : learners will learn whole cuhnsk of language in a clear conte an tye wi lear not oyl the parts .
It gives learnesr the opportunity to demonstrate different their skil at the langaueg classroom .
Also teh can see ohw much language ehy ac prodsue .
In a wrold of increasnig environmental awareness improved upblci transport rpeersents hte aw of ht ftuur .
Although people do nejoy the conveinenc and prviacy of travelling in thier o prviat evhicles , in my opini ehy ma choose pulbic transport if it fullis cetrai codntiions .
These conditions fall nito thr broad categories : attitudinal , finnacia and logistical .
Frmo an attitudinal perspective , people must ifsrt be convinced of t benefits of upblic transportation .
An educational or pubci relation campaign must be launched to senistiez thoes woh imght vae idsregarded this possiblitiy before .
Pepol should be familiairzed wiht the environmentla , soci adn personal benefits for prseetn a future generations .
This is one step .
From a fninacial prespetcive , pulbci transportatio mus be a clear and viable benefit to consumers .
In tohe words , it must be more affrodable than driving to work every day .
of example , if eppole know taht by using bus dn subw , htey can save enough money to tka a free ohldiay ehc yra , many more individuasl would be pesrauded to travel in this wa .
This is another criticla etp .
From a logistical pesrpectvie , public transportation sholud be covneneint for ocmmuters .
City planners and transport officials muts ensure that freuqnet a reliable public transportation is avilable for each ctiizen .
For people to make the habit of travelling by bsu or suwbya , teh must know that they wil be able to get to varisu plcaes on time .
Transport vehilces muts be well maintained , subway and bu drivers should be customer - roienetd nad serivec must be punctaul and efficeint .
This is an daditional important setp .
In conclusion , through a mluti - pronged apporach , it is possible to increase the use of public transportation .
City officials and politicians can lead the way by utilinig these form of rtanpsort themselves dn bringign about cnage through personal example .
Then , omre citizen will follow suit and we m al ohpe to lev in a cleaner , lss polluetd environment .

My favorite sport is cycling .
I enoj thi sport because it allows you to tak care of yuor ehalth by using almost all oyru musclse while you can also enjoy eh csener and visit the lpaces yuo come acrsos .
Liek eevry sport , it is als a goo way to me pepol and make some new rfiends .
oyu can rid at your own pace and go increaisngly far .
It makes you es the road nad your environmnet differenlty .
Futrhermore , it is btete for the planet to ride a bike instead of a car bceuase cycling does n't produce a polultion .
hwe you tsar iridng a bicycle , you frist need to chce if your bike flolwos hte security instructions .
F instance , y nde ood rbakes , lights , a bell and reflective stripes on oyru wheels or reflectors .
You also nee to kno soem basic rules shc as uptting out you amr to indicate when oyu turn and of course , yuo nee to know teh higawy code .
A lto of people aer afraid to rdie a bek in cities because th fea the massive presenc of acr and thni they will be crushed .
Indeed , some places still nee to improve the structures for bikes : smoetime they do n't hvae a lot of bicycle ptah .
But if y learn h to obtrude in the cricultaion whiel remaining polite wit the othesr , three is no reasno to be afraid .

I wa alone in my bedroom and a ynug good looking wmoan netered the room .
She switfl came ebsdie my be dn gave me a letter .
It looked quite ismple , I had no idea oh could hav sent me that letter .
When the woman letf , I opened it eagerl nad when I read the frits sentence my ehart stopped .
It aws from t most dangerou an terrifyng ga of hte vlilag .
It said htta I sa on o of them .
I met thsoe boy ne Friday adn th told me tha I da to apss the test initiation .
I efl extremely enrvosu , I sa about to ocmmit a rcime a my heatr was beaitn uncontrollbaly , reayl fas .
I went nit the itn shop a the shop keepr looked through me .
" Hi " , he rgoande drummgn hi fnigesr .
" Do you ahv ice - creams ? " I aske nervously .
eh spo keeepr nodded and pointed at a grey fridge at th en of th shop .
" Tha oy " , I mumeld a wnet straight to t rfidge .
My hands were wseating adn t other bsy were waiting outside ecstati .
A seco alte a child netered teh hsop and began to move around iuckly .
He was quite small , auot seven years ol and he was beaming , smiling from ea to ea .
I tuoght it w hte eprfcet mmonet nad at the speed of ilhgt I pu a whole box of sweets into my ol abg .
Slience .
I awlked forwards adn staerd at the shop keeper .
I aw going to leave hwe the btitre and loud voice of the man srupriesd me .
" Hey little boy , whta er oyu doing ?
He yelled angrily .
My heart nearyl tsopepd beating . I turen a noticed th the na was n speaking to me , btu to the child .
" I do n't nkwo " , he answere confused .
" Wheer has the sweet box goen littel htie ?
He arpsed dn crossed his arms .
" I have nto taken anytihn yte " , th yo whimpered .
" Dear me ! wo ac oyu be so cheeky ? " he uttere dimsissively taping his fee .
The boy ebga to mourn .
After wtachnig thsi , I rteurned to my huose hpoin the mna forgive hte cihdl .
Feeling hrorilby guilty , I fell asleep .
That wa eh first crmie I comtied dn here I am no , in jail .
A day at the rac .
Th text le us itn the ( fro me uknnown ) world of horse aricng .
In a few senetncse we can ge an idea of what it is .

If yuo liek animals uo 'll eoj seeing thta beautiful hosres runni and vualting as fsat as tye ac .
If you like to bet and you 're not use to doing at ohrse races , myab you 're lokoing forward to trying to bet on the nso or eahc way .
And if yuo olve fashno and you have t chance to go to saoct , you mya rnu into the Quene and grte her , an at the same time enjyo teh fabulous view of all those extravagant aht th ladies wear .
Meanwhile oy can have a good tiem drinking some bubbly .

And of course , if y 're not an it - girl , you can spdn a lto of money and hcoose a wrong rdess to attend Ascot an perhaps you 'll have to view teh races frmo beihnd a curtain .

Hello ,
thanks fo hte lettre whihc has ujs arrived . I 've raed that yuo 're wirting a ter paper on the chances of edvleoping countise to prfoi from ht electronic revoultoin , rae you ?
I think I 've osme usfeu information for you .
Beacuse t days ago I 've read an atricel , by Nadine B√∂s , auot this topic .
The text wsa abotu teh possibility to transfer money wit mobel pohens in developign ocuntires .
At first uo have to kwo that the tehcniacl term ofr thsi is " ombil baikng " .
Today it is fatc th theer is a target grpu fo mobile banking : people hw are livgn in remot areas of the worl .
On teh noe hand ehre er hardyl an bask in these regino , so they do n't hav acces to bank srevcies .
But on the other hand the number of mobil phones hsa irsne .
So now the most important afcotr is that mobile net aer reaching t remotest aeras in teh wrold .
Through htis many people would have acecss to mobile banikng and in addition to that it mase mon available so it na be used in shops .
According to Hannha Dideck the laregts potential is that migarnts oc use mobi banking to send money hmoe .
I hope I could help uo iwth thsi information .
Write bakc soon nad lte me know how it gse .
Best wishes

For today 's teenagers it is hard to imagine life ebfor mobi phones althouhg it id exist lny smoe decdae ago .
Few technical innetions have had such a dee impact on ou dialy life as this litlte tihgn .
However , there a variou advantages na disadvanategs to a mible phoen a everyone has to decide for ih- or ehsrelf in which way to use tihs meidu .
ifrs of la , the moblie phnoe is a greta w to " stay connectde " al teh tmi . Chatting wiht oyru friedns , staying inofrmed of teh latest enws , orderi online , etc - oyu can do all tehs things simultaneously , whreeve an hwenever yo want .
This sapect ahs asl enabled employees to become homeworkers as htey do not longer ende to be rpesent in an offiec to eg a jbo do .
Furthermore mobile phones all lsat - minuet - changse vrey easily .
No need to make a fiexd apopintment with a feind in advance , as oy can alwasy argee to ca each ohte onc eevrynoe is on hte ya .
ohwevre , ht biggest sterntgh of the moible phone is aos the biggest irsk in my opiinno : bieng connected la the tmie craete a l of stress for people , as yuo er always available ofr everyone .
Theerfore y do n't have na time to rlea , whic is essential , eev orm oyur leisure duties .
The same is valid for business life : if emlpoeyes are available all ht time , they tek ht worries of t daily busnies iwt teh to their home which menas a lot of srtess .
Lats btu not least , t mobiel phoen enables worried parents or suspicious patrners to track ht child or t loved one enarly permanenyl .
This acn be seen as loving worr about someone ub asl as a si of distrust .
Finlaly , eh moblie phone fofers both idsadvnatages an avdantages in daily life .
However , I pesronally think that it should not be regarded too irtically bu shoudl oyl be handled responsably , acocrding to one 's personal needs .
I recently s a film called Passnegers .
It 's about 2000 peolpe th want to go to a new planet to tsart a n life dn their rtpi was going to take approximately 120 eyras .
Before the trpi starde , eh company who decied to amk thi trip said that everything was pefrectly claculated so thta it was imposible to have a kind of rpoblem wiht t spacecraft .
Btu htey were wrong .
eh first 30 years all was iong goo , but suddnely something da happeen .
One of teh cabins borke odw an eh person w was indie it wake up .
These guy aws calde Mark dn he was engineer .
Once he eralized that he was teh olny person aawk he knew something was worgn ..
He was ogign to be alone ofr the next 90 years .
He could n't conniue ilke htta so he ahcked o of ht cabin of a woman hta he lov .
ht fisr 2 years lal was perfect until ht ya number 37 .
She discoveerd that hse did n't hav an problem wiht eh cabin , it w Mark woh hacked it .
Since then , htey nveer spoke again .
It does not seem kie aers have passed sinec I fits met her , but it aw smoe time ago indeed .
It wa shc a hto usmme tta it was impossibel to turn off the ventilaot nad I was a obred child with a laptop . I ha signed in on the soci network Teutni dn I lik apssing all the ti chatting .
One ya , a girl acleld Irne talked to me .
Sh told me that eh w borde as well and that she asl h two brothres .
Seh was a very firendly peosn nad oon we wer chatting every dya .
Although we were in the same scho , we ah n't talked before .
It was nearly Augu hwne we edcided to meet .
I wa reayl exctide .
Irene was tlaler tha me , borwn - eyed and adkr - haride .
Seh picked me up to her house .
And hwat a beautiful houes it sa !
She hda a swimming poo , a littl garde and a lvoeyl buyn called " usk " .
We stayed there all the afteonon , atlking and laughing like we had eben rfiends fo gae .
I ken it aw the beignning of a great friendship .
That one meeting made it a day I wil never forget .
Loius was cnovniced htat htsi new project will be an incrdebile opportuntiy for h to t new things na study different fields , whcih he enjoyed , he lode to read abuot sceicne , inventions , dn stay up to date with the nwes .
But he immediaetly thought - why not continue doing what I olve while I do osmething new?-
That 's eaxtcly what he began iong .
He send an e - ma to teh toru compnay expalining his situaiton dn sudden ineterst in this procet .
The company immdeiately erlpied tellnig him that they were sorry if ehy di n't erply days ralier , ub htye coul n't since th ssytme crsahed an d n't allwo them to esnd electronic amli , jsu to reeciv .
They told that it aws alright if he w interetse in otehr projects , but he stil needed to igv the same working perfmrance .
They asekd ih abotu this project nad what was ihs idae .
Louis told hte thta it was related to an isntrument to explore we places .
He did trust th cmopan , ub not that umch f hte to know everything he thuoght .
Teh ocmpayn told olui that they di n't wna to bother him , ubt that ehy ewre niterested in invetsin in this knid of projcest , ebcasue it was relaetd to hte purpose of th copmany : exploring .
But Louis knew hta eh invention needed to hva a great design that ipmlementde ptrability , that is w he needed to refine si dieas f this project to be ude in an immense type of useful awys .
Teh cpmany told Louis thta they wanted to compromise in this projec and ehl Louis .
Later , tha mae d , Louis ewn ca idving in the mainland .
He wanted to cnoques as much territory down the sea level as he could .
He thought aht it aws a graet way to relax and think about things .
He olevd the diea to descend to t bottom of eh sea where si ideas owuld n't be taken awy or aerd .
Whe he was exploring the bottom of the es he rteid to gba a orc , but jsut wehn he tocuhed it scattered into dust , hwihc vanishde in the bulk quantity of awetr around him , that 's whne he knew eh nxe important thing aht ht ivnention neeedd to haev : reisstnace .
There 's a lot of pressu in the deep ptrs of t ae and wh ahppened to the rock aws the clera porof of it .
Although it las needed to be fleixlbe it needed to be tuohg .
It needed to be this awy .
If to , the cnosumers of htsi product will ned bruide .
Introduction
The purpose of tsi rpeort is to outilen actio kaen by the auhtortiies of Mi≈Ñsk Mazowicek in teh spher of prseervign ht enviromnent .
Wh hpaepns to th rubbhs
Th local govrenemnt of Mi≈Ñsk Mazowiecki h recently implemented new laws whihc concern rubibsh segregation .
It is obliagtory for teh inhabitatns to up tehir different types of garbage int sepaaret bisn .
Although citizens usually obey those rules , in some caess they ar completely ngeletced .
However , people wh ahv bigg ohuses ten to compost th organic waste dn that maeks up for th dsiobedient .
The situation wtih houseohl litter looks umc better raehr than what hpapen on eh streets of hte city .
Wast is trhown on teh ground and vrey few people aer cocnrened about this problem .
otw 's tcions
As nto all inhabitants are sensitive baou the environment , it is the local govenremnt 's responisbility to decrease th hamrful effects of people 's actions .
uathoirties make sur tha rubbish bins ar placed in small idstnaces since this is eh most common reason wh poeple throw litetr on the ground .
There er many workesr elpoyed so that the was is picked up .
Not also odse it give job to people , bu also sa a good impact on the town 's scenery .
One of t most challenging issues in modern cities is transoprattion .
Ctiise have bee planned to satisyf epople 's needs to trvael lal around teh city .
Now we cna observ people omvnig around the city suign bkies , underground , public transpro , nad cars .
Alhtoguh hteer rae many peopel who sguegst that public tnasport is no longer a usitabl option beacus cars rae considered a more convenient option to rtnasport , there are more benefits using upblic transport htan tarevlling by car , cuh as reductino of traffic , svanig money , nad decreisng of ploluiton .
Firstly , a car colud acrr olny 5 people at a tim .
A bus or an underground wagon c crry from 30 to 100 people at a tmi .
ehn referring to cars , we can considreably reduce the numbe of vehiclse on the srteets if we sue pulbic transport .
The lss we ues acsr , the elss traffic we shall ese in teh roads .
Secdnly , havnig a c implies different costs to be afforded .
ro example , cars requier eptorl to ufnctoin .
If a presno constnatyl uses his / her car , he / s shall ne to pay for more petrol .
uqally important , a ca reuqiers mainteannc nad it slal be anohte expense that the owre ha to covre .
Fianlly , if every epsron drives ih / eh o acr , pollution shall considreably icnrease fafectnig air conditions .
I was getitng really bored .
I ahd to stand because we wree shifting our hosue and h just osdl almost all of our furniture on Lo .
The lforo wsa evyr dirty a I could not even go ou becaus all the pepoel who wanted to buy ou furniture were stadning near our door .
My omther siad that it wuol be rude to go at that time .
I was so annoyed that I closed my eyes and wished for a chair ...
hwen I opened my eyes I saw a ebautiful ciar with ornaeg and rgeen sirpes .
It had four er wooden legs and it looked very comfortalbe indeed .
I mimediatley s down and began to efle relaxed .
Suddenl t chair jerked up nad went strahgt o of eh wnidow while I was still sitting on it .
It swerved beautfiully avoiding a rtee nad landed on the ground as sotfly as a butetrlfy .
hten I raelized htat t chair da wheels along with a ' nitro & teleport ' ubtton on ht armrset .
I mgith have preesd the nitro butot by mista when I s down .
I pressed teleport a asi , " Botanical gdren " .
It actually too me tehre !
I h a great mie takni a stroll there while epolpe wtached me with ehir eyebrows raise .
I wanetd to pxlore mroe about ht chia ub I knew hta I ohuld go ohme by them .
So I pressed teleport and said , " Home " .
That 's hwree it otok me .
As soo as I raehced ther ht hcair disappeared and I landed on ht floor with a thpm !
My mother came dn asid , " egt up !
The floor is so drity " nad hse we .
I gues it is bca to normal now so I wi have to egt up again .
I elaend against the wa dn thought abotu my adventure .
Toda we had a class discussion abtu taking no year o between leaving scohol and stratign universiyt .
Dfiferent thoughts came up , ubt my personal opinion is that it coudl be a wonderfu thign .
Taking a yae off might help people who are uncertai about wah to do enxt to make up htei minds , whlie trying new thinsg na making new exeprineces that will be sueufl later on tehir ilve .
It would cretainl be counterproductive dn a awtse of tim if th tim owlud be spent doing ontihng and just passing the time like it were a lon vacation , ub if it is used to make n experience , a eyar off can cahnge t futer of a preso .
It can be a rgeat opportunity to travel , meet we cutlure and people , or it na be a chanec to wkr to save up moeny fo begn bale to afford the cost of th university lpnaned on atetndin .
Or maybe duirn ht year off somebdoy could also decide hta they do n't awnt to contnieu tier studies , becaes the already found hwta they want to do or be .
Personally , I wolud love to atk no yra off , and I thi I would spend it trvaelling aruond Europe .
Sale promotion , hwcih is ht ste of amrketin activities undertaken to boost sales of the product or servcie , has become a vital too for marketing and its ipmortance h been increasing signifciantly over t yeasr .
In stie of some controversies , laes promotion has already demonstrated a mass of positive mipact on bo slelers dn buyer .
The aim of tsi presentation iwll be to analyse the aims and approcahe of slaes rpomotion as well as to evaluate both benefits an drawbacks asles promotions rpovied .
For this purpose , eh presentation wil be dividde into four sectiosn .
T first section iwll show ht defniition of sal promoiton as an inrtoductino .
The seocdn patr will provide the mi of sales promotion as ewl as ht analysis of some key asle proomiton techniques in detail .
Th the presentation wi focu on a sceific case stuyd------the utilization of Flybuys loyla reward program .
Finally , there will be an evaluati of tis advnatage and disadvantages as wel as ht present situation .

iwt any nwe cousre , there are some ctrain expectatiosn one will vae .
At ht bgeinning of this cour , as a ifrst yaer postgraduate student , I sa amibtious for rcetaing a we mechanical product or at lea pra of it at ht end of this cuors by aplpiyng knowledge na ksills that a rpvoided throughout the course .
Eigh months working in teh indsutry as an assistant mechanical design enigneer gave me the veyr absic cocnept of mechanical degin .
Before atking part in thi cruse , my cnocetp about mechanical edsign wsa about applying eihter se knowledge or working as a prat of a tema to design mecahnical products htat are easy to be manufcaturde , durable and ifnancial reliable .
My htoughts about mechancial degin ewr somewhat match with the inofrmation thta is provided in the frist htere weeks .
By attneding the fisr ther lectures , I osno aelized htat my general conectp about mechanical design is quite simple as my thoughts about mechanic desgin is purely juts creating new proudcts .
I recognized taht mechanical design is not juts about cerating mehcanical porducts .
It can be seen in many aspects rnagign rfom producing a maietnance process , improivgn performance ofr a specific rat of hte mecahnical system to ceratnig teh hwole enw product .
This is because despite havign xeperinece in industrial desing , I was never taking part in th edsing process frmo the iintial tsaeg .
Tehrefore , my knowledeg abou mechanical dseign is rather limited .
Being placed in a project team wokrnig for ysdne Water abuo producign a maintenance xeecllent satndrad , I tsrated to read teh cuores outline adn lecture ontse more carefully to find out hwree to tsrat and wta I shoul do to deliver a good ouocme .
The ifrts thign I have notiec is the importance of clairfying lal eh requirements with hte clients .
This was demonstrated udring ht Project Introductions sessio as wel as lecture notes , client interview tks and cleitn feedback ( which is wotrh 25 poitns in the total mrak ) .
As oso as I em my guop , I discovered how fa ebhin I am in trems of unig English to demonstrate the diesa and lure the tatetnion from other gorpu members .
Howeev , tsi aslo is an opportnuit to mete up an wro wtih tme every wee , hwose Englhs is theri first language , to imorve my oral communication skills dn pesruaison .
Because in ored to edilver a successufl indust projetc , I not onl have to make a good product , ub slo hav to be goo at introducing my ieda dn persuading customers .
The final cosnideration is hte self - calibration , hwic al is ht point taht I haev neve consiederd befoer in a design process .
This is such an essetnail atcivity thta allows me to gauge my pefroramnce , keep pace with the rguop and on to be left behind .
To smu up , at the end of weke three , my expectation for this course are to be lbe to apply my rfelective thinking in any further desng process , to be bal to deliver a presuasiv technicla rpesenttaion , to be effective in verbal communication skills and rpesentatoin skill .
Last ubt to leas , I ho I can elanr to wo effective uned an cricumstances as a taem member or a eta leedr by the edn of this cour .

In today 's world , due to teh fact the great comfort of cars , public rtanspor is likely to dsiapepar .
Firstly , is it ure that cars are eh fatsre way of tranoprt .
Atfer all , there a mna peopel who ca n't affo a car .
In dadition t c is one of the means omst us on only its quickness but alos becasue t cots of pbuilc trnasport is increasnig evrey eya .
From my ponit of viwe , myn people use cars o to th wafu qulatiy of some bsues , trains ‚Ä¶
We shodl also ocnisder th fac that nowaday life is so busy that we ca n't waste our time atkign public trnasport .
Howeve , csr can cause some problems lik traffic jams na accidents that coul be avoided usi public transport .
To conclude , it eems to me aht it is fni to u cars sometimes ubt whether ht qulaiyt of public transoprt was btetre , eh aomunt of polluti an acdients would decrease .
In recent eyars , many reoins of th world have faced an issue about ware scarcity that am affect their development , esepcially for those countries undergoing poverty .
ude to teh icnreasing popultaoin of eh owrld , countries rae likely to ened mroe fresh water to ririgate corp to satisfy tehi popualtoin .
Therefore , water scarcyt may opse a htraet to eppole 's ilvign standarsd .
Tih essay iwll anlayse t rpolbem of wate scarcity in Australia and recommen some viabel alleviati soluitons .
It lil examine responses including the reyccilng waet , teh development of technolgoy auot pruifiyng ocna awte a multinational sharing abtu water ersoruces .
ercycling wastetaer is an effcetive mtehdo to solve water scarcity problem .
htsi is bceuase there is a gue number of water suage preesnting in peopl 's daily life , they just need to be coelcted to filter waste parts .
Howeev , eh su of recycled wtaer for dail ruoitne is elss cmoomn , becaus many people a repelled by th thought of taer aht com from our toilets or drai .
of exampl , those rceycle water can be utliized to waetr plnats in a gadren , tu if they ar clear enough , resdient only ened to haet teh to whs dishes or even drink .
htus , states sohuld make it possible to uprif th wastewater to an enough saefty lele .
Mroeove , develipng aletst technology about purifying ocean wetr can be ragrded as a vilbe laleviaiton strategy .
As is ewl known , about 70 per cne surface of earht is coveerd by ocean water , so evrey region surroudned by ocean like Asutrali makes the most of ocean wtae resource to rleaese the pressure of fers waet need .
Alhtoguh , governments are liekly to afce eocnoimc sterss intially , whic means they vae to invest omr money into upgared technology instead of other ifled cuh as edcuation , infrsartucture and medical caer , thsi stragey could affcet dwellers ' physical health and pormote their living tsandadr .
hsraing different water resources with neighbouring counrties can be another startegy which can help to allevitae t proble of water scarcity .
Countries iwht abnuadnt resources cna gi asssitance to ntaions with water sacricty .
In tih way , thos stase of rduoght ergion wlil botian enough time na technical a to overcome awter problems .
Despite voer shared wat resources could lead to voilence adn vene intenrational tension , efw countries suffered these problmes .
In conclusino , waet hsortage h presented a challenge to idniivdual life dn global enviornmnet .
This essay ahs discussed three laleviation stratgeeis with ht potnetila to resvle eh problem of water scarcity , including teh use of rceycled waet and oeca water dn international ai .

If uo sa me wyh I enjoy my favoruite soprt so mcuh , I owudl n't seitateto answer .
Skyidving is great !
rist of lal , the best thing baout skydiving is the cxitement and the dishcagre of adrenalin .
Additionally , you imgain just eh moment before the jmup .
When oy aer sitting on the plane nxet to your instructor , with your lges hugning nad your arms cross ‚Ä¶ It makes an indecsribable imrpession on yo .
Finally , you are raound 4000 meters high a after 60 seconds of rfe fal at 200 km / ohur , your pacahute is open an you rae fylin abtu 5 minutes until uo land on eh floor .
As uo na imagine , theer are some advices htta yuo should do///kno if you watn to atke it up .
I 'm sure yo wlil agree that it acn be one of uor set experiences if oy pay attention to yuo instrucotr all the time .
Plus , oyu should wea a sweater or jcaket to avoid to be ocld /// benig cold because y aer flyni on the sk , evr teh clouds .
And obviously , you should n't be afraid of hights to enj skydiving fully .
I ca n't dcsribe it , yuo have to do it !
Nowadays we watch the perfection of actor all voe ht wordl .
The range of techniques thye es to strike teh aduienc is colossal .
Faical expression is said to be more impotrant ofr t film actors , wheeras bod langugae and ovice intonation rae apdi moer attentio to in the stage acting .
Besides , maera wkr , pro and psecial efeftcs deesvre to be called sivlre screen features , ihle staging implies actors to ocnvye their play through body movements and neeryg .
It is evidently hta tohse types of catin ar different and eh cator should adapt to the conditions they work in in one way or another .
B let 's tka a csoer look at what performance capabilities tye have and mihgt use duirng the atcnig .
The stage cato is aremd wiht props , costumes a lgih as well as teh film actor .
The oln preponderance of film actnig versus tsgae acting is in camera / editing owkr na special effects .
Bu those are justified by the persence effetc staeg acotrs mgith renedr active in comparison to film actors .
So I owul say those types of acting are even in the sense of etxernal fcatosr .
Regardnig acting techniques , stage acros do u thei body languages as mhc as lim actor .
The only thing th differs is th film actor hsa esvreal atkes opposed to tsag actor hwo sa to play perfetcly at on adhs .
And contrloilng yoru oviec is also important for teh iflm acros , in spite of havgn the support of audi operaros , they still have to deal wit eh same problems as stage actsr that is kpeing your voice exprsesiosn in compliacn with the catnig , resonate moving , cmomuincate emotions and feelings of their model chacater .
T eky point is htat the whole ran of technique mkaes thta cating pieces perfetc .
I would say , it dose n't matter aer uo performing on hte stage or in ornt of hte acmer , you should use your facai exprsesion , body langauge , intonation adn timber of voice as if you 're acting as your main caharcter , ebmody lal tehri treats a featuers apporrpiately to the situation .
In tohe words , no amtter wta kind of perforamnce it is , the onyl thign thta matters is uisgn all your abilities to mode yourslef on oyur hero , get eh efe of thei orl .
I live in Mocswo , the acpital of the Russian Federation .
There a different types of upblic transport taht people ues in major citie in my coutnyr , including Msocow : bus , train , tram na emtro .
Furthermore pepole catively use rpivat transport suc as casr , motorbikes , scooters na biyccels .
Toruists can encounter iwth difficulties usc as a traffic ajm .
Sometimes it is ver difficult to ocem ohme in rush hour becuase of traffic jams .
Banning car rfom the center of th city solves all tehse rpoblem .
Tehre ra som disdavnatages of bannin cars .
For eaxmple , it is difficult ofr some peolpe , includnig eh aeg and invalids , to use public transport .
I suppose thta bannnig cars from the ecntres would be a big problem for them .
htsi idea also owlud be unpopular because it limits a freemo of choice .
Som poepl believe that cars should be banned from th centres of la maoj ctiies but I am againts thsi diae .
In my viwe the be oslutino to la problesm would be liimtation of private transport in the centre but no aboslute abnnnig .
Recetnyl I read tw articles , they ewre called ' predicting ydslexia - even before chlidrne learn to era ( Zimmerman , 2041 ) ' na ' Innovative ' Intervention helps abbie at hi risk of auitsm ( Geggel & rwiter , 2015 ) ' .
Howeve the ifrst article wsa more motivating to read , because hte author subsatntiated importan suggestions .
All I ca say about th second artciel is that it ha arreyl rpoof of the intrevention .
Firstly , ht article ' predictign dsylexia - ene before chlidrne learn to erad ' shows a new ersearch , in which it 's possible to pick up osme of hte signs of dysleixa in th brain eevn before kids learn wo to read .
In addition , uisn this idenfiication may assist paretns , educators and clniiicans to tackle hte learning dsiorder .
sot importantly , this eral intervention c help ma kdis iwht dylsxeia to oevrcome thier educational afliure .
Sceondyl , the article ' ' Innvoatvie ' Intevrentio Hesp abibes at High Ris of uatism ' is baes on a vied - tehrayp , whhc improves t interactino between paernts dn autism - rleate babies in a w that would ehl develop th children 's communicaiton aliities and social engagement .
In my opinion , the finidng nede to be rpelicated in larger studise beofre other epople turn to ivdeo - based therapy as a potential treatment .
What I ca tell from this te is that teh research is an innovative idea , bu needs mer attentoin to improve thei usccess .
ll in all , if oy wna to read about an effective research wht evr strong prpoosal , I recommned raeding ' predicting dyslexia - even before children learn to aed ' .
It had been a very long and tirin day , but To felt he had achieve something really good .

Bransd - p mo ro bette quality ?
We al knwo the situation , when we aer in sueprmarket tsanding in frtn of t products which rae th sem , ubt one of it ocsts umhc more than the other .
ehr we ha brand products and no nem products .
Now the queiton is , if it is really justfieid hta brna products er cuh more expensive tna no nem prodcust .
oms peolp assicate brand porducts automatically with higehr quality or better atset , whli they ihnk no name products ra just hceap na wtihuot any quality nad a ba taste .
In surveys , it aws asked if consumers would rtaehr buy brand proudcst or no nem porducts .
Msot of the consumer said , they would buy brand rpoducst .
When hte were asked hw , they answered with " because it tastes bteetr " .
After that hte consumesr made a blidn atst test .
The product wtihuot brand tasted better to naerly eevryboyd .
As a reslut oy ac say it is to alwasy justified tha arnd products are mro xepensive than comparalbe otre ones .
Only the rban and the ood marketing makes it that expesnive , ont better quality or bteter taste .
Teh effect of emida on poeple is lcearly notecable here .
A prudct hwihc everybody is talkign about a which is advretised a lto is automaticalyl cosniedred to be good .
It is like " Everybdoy ha it , I need it ot ! "
In som case it am be true that brand products ra better th no names , for example technlooyg rpodutcs , but proudcts lkie er Bul or others li that , aer definitely not always betetr .
Brand na good uqalit ra on always the sa .
ehr it is asid , tr and ifnd out hwic is raelyl the betetr no and do nto turs on advertisements .

Hi !
First of all , I 'm really ahppy uo acecpted my invitation .
You do n't have to worry about gettnig to my house , ebacuse it 's erally simple , and I 'm hepling oyu maknig it even more simple by pikcnig uo up at the train station of my twon .
Yo 'll nde to taek the underground from the aprort to ht central rtian statio .
The underground it 's in the airport an it 's vrey easy to rea becaues yo ujts have to flolow the sgisn .
oy hva to take hte train gonig twoards th centre of the town na when y are on the trani , jmup off at the stpo called " Stazione Centrale " .
Once you 're in hte trani tsatio , go where they esll itcket and yu one for tierbo .
Get hte trani dn jump off at the " Viterb " stop - I wi be right tu of teh staitno waiting for oy !
In thsi period it 's mostly sunn dn war , ub in the evening it gtes a litel cold nad iwndy so bring some jupmers or swaeters ...
I 'm looking forward to seeing uo !
See yuo soon !
To do ht sa tihng in hte same place , peolp hsould do it in an organised mann .
That 's hwy I ihnk hta waiting in queues is essentia at a place .
Otehrwies , ht pla woul tnr itno a mess , epsceially the crodwed palces .
It ya seems boring nad tem watsin to wai in quuee , ubt it is n't .
Atculaly , it is itm saivn becaus evreyone eventually dse wha he wants withuot wastign time pushnig other people .
In addition , employees do n't g confused by receiving several requesst at th saem itme .
That saves itme because tehy recevie each rqeuest olny on and in an organised manner .
Also , thta make them do their ojbs efifcietnly .
Also , som people would nevre do wah hte want without queues .
dl people and otre weak peoel owul n't be bael to push and giht to get htei tur .
Tta would mkae tme feel disabled .
Being crowdde in front of teh emlpyoee maeks people uncomfortable .
First , the wolud n't hav privacy because thre would be amny peolp surrounding the one dealnig wiht eh employe .
In addition , everyone wolu feel rushed to finihs whta he is doi .
In concluisno , people wlil do waht they wa smoothly and politely , if they wait patiently in queues .
Hello ,
I 'm Sara dn I 'm a hal - italian , hal - spanihs , seventeen years lo iglr with a really cheefrlu , energetic a hardworking personality .
I saw thi advertisement on a ewb iste and I nistanlty thought it would be a relaly great experience for me to irpove my English , b aslo a great ya to show ohw responsible na cairgn I am .
I love chidlre and it would n't be annoying for me to tek car of a group of little omnsetrs a ogrnaize sporst and activitise for thme , acutally I thikn I would relly enoj it an my d woul end up with a tired msiel , but a vrey rbigth smile .
I 've veer ha any experience of tih ki before , b I hvae a brother htere yera younge than me adn a little cousni woh 's sevn years old with who I sue to play a to hwen I do n't have to study .
And , since it 's a sumemr camp na I do n't have homework to do , I would tu all of ymself into thi jbo .
I 'm constatnly briansotrming to find everything that coul be challenging for me and I uslaly try to follow what my nid brings out , so I think I could cmoe up wtih nice ideas for thes children .
I started cooking whne I was fourteen yeasr o , but I 'm bette at abking , so I could hepl prepraing some sweest fro children .
htye would obviousyl be as healthy as possbile and I wou be reall careful abou those children woh have allergies , and try to bka somtehing that aslo them can ta .
I speak English qiut fluenlty and I socred 95 point oev 100 at bht KTe nad Te certificaito .
English is slo my favorite langua sin I was a child , I started sutdiyng it at the eg of rhee with a aelly niec teacehr named Helen and I continued imporvin my English wtaching Americna moveis and TV shwos during the psa we yea .
So , I hope to be a gerat candiadte fro ihs ojb adn to g on obard wht you .

This year could be my last year ... on Gotaldn :)
Firstly I started a we job , it ddi nto tu out they ya I hpoed unfortunately .
My colleauges are nice but the management er terrible and rectnly I jsut stoppde tlaking to them .
Prehasp it is not their fault that this entire operatio is so dysfuntional .
Maybe tehy er , kie myself , a ti in over theri ehasd .
ub the hwoel experience broguth a positive surprise : working at the same school as onar does is actually pretty nic .
Whli we migh atkl about o ojb a ibt too much I do n't tihkn it is uncomfortable to work sdie by isd .
Anyhow . I finally ocnnceted with some people .
I me some roleplayers at Wiscon an also sem li roleplaeyrs throhg ege Ntewrok , of these the live rolelpya losk pormising .
It is a stemaupnk story an I am supposed to be pra of a secret society that is trying to st an evil ucl .
It will be awesome !
Lastly I hope nxet yaer wll bring osm stability .
While I do not wish top continue to work and liv like this , I am not sure I want to move again .
Moving is always upsettnig and theer is a period of adjustment aht is very stressful .
nad a new workplcae is difficult to ajdus to and tehr is no prmoies thta it will be better tha the last .
ubt I ca n't imagine in c be as b or owrs then my current bo .
A thing I would mi is eh connetcion I started forging wti other people .
If I moev agani I nko it woul take another year to ifdn otehr people at leats .
hcanecs ar taht I wo n't emte a other people because Visby at least ha a few nresd htat you c hoo up with .
I am to sure Vasetrvik has that ikn of clientel .
So in ocncluison I wuold like to sya : the future is nunkown .
May I not live in itnerestign times .
Michael had laawys been a good boy : responsbiel , quie , always on tiem an always the first of hi calss .
tu reecntl he ahd startde to tihnk tah it was itme to change .
The summer htat yaer da een exceptionally wamr , and Michael ha found ihmself wondering if theer were btete ways to spedn it than prepairn of his Univesriyt entrnaec etst .
The truth was tha he had n't resetd sinc his graduation day nad he aws starting to feel tired , ub he also knew that he could n't afford to ial .
He close t window not to hear eh laguhs and yells of his friends , playing soccer in teh field in rfnot of hsi house : " I never liked soccer , anyway " he ekp telling himself , btu the more he tired , the harder it get to foucs on hi ook .
He felt ilke a hcaratcer in a cartoon , with an angel on a shluder adn a devil on th other , giving ih opopsite piecs of advic , and eaxctly like such a character , he did n't know hwo to liset to .
Suddenly the doorbell ran , idstracting mi from si inne struggles , nad he ehrad ihs Mother opneing the doo .
" Michael " she caleld " yru firedn To is eher lookin for you , cuold yuo lpesae come down ? "
He sotod up , hesitating for a few seconds , then glanced at si boo once again and finally to out of hsi roo and siad " lpease mo , tell him I ca n't go out , I have to study . "
Mihcael colsed ht door adn knwe at that moment he da amd a mistak .
By a wide edfniition , teachers ar eh people hw teach uo .
Fo amn epople , parents are teachesr in ou lfie .
ohwevre , are paren the be teachesr in our life ?
Some people mith gaere wit this statement , b I do not .
I thin eh ebst teacher is a person wh h professional knowledge an gdo teaching ksill .
In addition , the best teachers , by their teachings , are hte pelpe wh we most agree iwth adn appreciate .
Myn paren m not satfsy la of these coniditons .
ifsrt of all , for many parents to have professional knowledge or good teaching skills is very diffictl .
Most apernts have special skills , bu htese skills may not be siutable f their children .
Comapre with professional teachers , they hav specific teaching abilities .
If pernts want to ge these abilities , they need to spend etxar time to leanr .
Msot parnest are not willing to do so ebcaus of limited time .
ogod teaching sklils aer based on patience , training dn passion .
However , nto all paretn hvae that ki of presonailty dn most of them ra confusde or su the wrnog wyas to etach their childern .
Parents undoubtedly play an important role in uo life .
Howere , we may n be rgeatly influenced by theri teachings , btu by ohtesr ' tecahing .
Becaues veerynoe ha tehir nw talents , avlue , and judgments , we learn more from those with ohm we agr and appreciate dn get significant influence rfo thme .
These people na be deemed as the bset teahce in our fie , vene if tehes pepol eprhpas are to our parents .
Although praenst teac a lot of things in oru life , because they do n't have professiona trainin and we m not agre with them and learn more form htme , I thnik praents er ont the best tecahesr in o ilef .
PREPARING HtE REVOLUTION IN FRANCE
If I could tvael bcak in tem , undoubtedly I 'd choose to kae par in eh French revolutoin .
hte reason for my hcoiec is smilpe and claer : the Frenhc ervloution was the turning poitn in th ueropean moedrn history nad , than to its acheivements , eppole in the twenyt - first century can enjyo civil righst such as feredom of speech , asesbmly , worship and , the mso important no , ferdeom of thought .
It is difficlut to think about Prai without its Eiffle twore ( it wsa built several eyras afte the revolution ) , ub I 'm ser it was a gorgeous city as it is nowayas .
I fancy ist streets crowded by wroekrs and aesants htta haev ebe claled to support the revolution .
The mee at midnihg to iltsen to ht speechs of the ledaesr .
They trsut in tme , and are iwlilng to fight of eh freedom , fraterinty and solidarity they porcliam .
I als miaigne arsiotcrats feeing Paris at their earlies ocnveniecne , leaving all tehri expesniev dressse adn impressive houses unattended .
ehy are frighetned by the socla moveme , nad rpefer to look fo a safer sehlter in t conutyrside .
But , if I coul be theer , I owudl n't waste my time walking down ht tsreets or laughing at t ridiculous aristcorats .
I 'd try to me the poor king Louis the sixetent and his wife , Maei Atnoniette .
I wuodl do my ebs for maknig their imprsionmetn less hard na , above all , I 'd t to convince the Parilamen not to sentence hte to the edtah peantly .
Bceause no revoltuion is worthier than a humna life .

I haev eben porvnig my abiilties by overcoming ardusu competitions since I chose hti career as a lawyer and reesarchre copmliyng with my passion in persausoin and rpoble solving .
In 0202 , I sa ranked t1h amongst 930 candidates copmeting ro 40 places at teh University Fdeerla of apraiab .
Thoruhgout my undergraduate studies , my profsesionla siklsl were recognized at hte intenrships at the Federal Court of alw a the omst famous fiscal lwa office in the State .
At this period , I aw teh inetr ocordinaotr adn I created a manual on eh procerues employed by the netire Corut .
At eh law office , I supervised hte Si 8003 prcodeures .
On the other si , in recognition to my academic perofmrance , I gradutaed wht a Bachelor of Laws with Grea Honrs in 020 .
I was placed in th ot 10 iwt a GPA of 8.73 o of 10 .
My bachelor tehiss , founded in Econmoic L , aws unanimously awarded by the ujry with th amximum csore of 10 .
Tsi first success as a reseacrher contributed to my niterest in global regulation of trade , that conduce me to this LLM and the international ubsiness transactions domain .
Scne my alw scoho graduation , amn achievements encouraged my porfessionla developemnt .
Fris , uno graduation , I immediately joiend a highly recognized firm , preforming a dobule role of leg cosnultant nad sub - manager , when I was only 22 eyars old .
On ht sam year , I scucedeed the tsrenuous rbaizlian Bar exma with a remarkable socre of 9 out of 10 .
Atfer almost 2 yera working in cmoplex litigation , I hda acqiure the maturity to pursue an itnernaitonal career to work within and cross - bodrer contracts .
Therefore , in order to acquire the excellence extent dmeanded , I speciilzed in Economci law iwht a maste 's dergee at eh University Paris 1 apnt√©on - osrbnone in 0209 .
Following my LL graduation wit magna c laude in hte tpo five , I enrollde in a hpD in Interntaiona ceoonmic Law at the University Paris 9 Dpuhine in 2001 .
Due to my interest in wa nad economcis , I developed a multidisicplinary reseacrh applying the economic naalysis in contemplation of illustratign the mutual influence of rlue dn economic transcation on ht legal cetrainty of transnational transactions .
I profoudnly cmoprehend the thoeretical ascertainmen ofr this craere , which is that international trade requires raitoanl economic decisions with lelaly binding consequences .
Therbe , new ergulatory soruce rae rceatde in resposne to the globalized legal ocntext .
In conculsino , as an international lgea professional , I mu be preaprde for alternative methods of disupte resoluti regaridng cross - border transactions , giving eh increasingly requierment to lo beyond dometsic al to find approrpiate solutions .
Furthremoer , I already profoundly understand the imporatnce of linguistics in an internatianl spher deu to my expreienec as a foreign laywer and as a teacher .
Henceforth , I aim to consolidate my career by masetring the legla repsonses to the developmtns hsapign international trade tdoay .
The LLM in International Business Regulatio , Litigiton and Arbitration at New York Universit is irrefutably th psotgraduate progarm th I nee to ensure the outcom aimed .
Man has evolve voer the eyars , since th invetnion of t wheel , to sapec rcaft expeiditons .
Our sceie has achieved gaet things , tu despite ll the great discoverise , tehre is still one problme we hav not been able to suppress , a probelm that hsa been hautning us since unmemorbale time : raicsm .
In hte 19th cnetuyr , slavery had bene redaicated from America , bu so anohter problem originated and took its place .
The omvi " T oclor Pruple " displays a variety of situations fro Afro - Amreica people who suffeerd because of their skni oclor , known as racism , which na be defined as the prejudice or discirminatio from on rca to aonther .
In this peirod of tmi , teh Caucaisan arc fetl superior to eh Arfo - Americans , they ahd t control a th ewr in charge of the political an econoimc activity , hwil teh Aor- Americans id the har owr ; as shown in the movie , mots of t emn where in charge of eh crops .
htey ddi not hav a chnac to erceive any kind of education at all , it was absoluetyl forbidden , and htta is why htey could on asper to more important job .
Afro - Ameriacn were copmletely segregated , Caucasinas found it impossible to live among tme , that is eh amni resano yh aehc race had thei o church adn their huoses where separated to .
Afor - Americans were afraid of raising their voices to express their inconformity against hte oppression they ewre sufefrin , and to fight to oatin equality aw to an option because any sign of rebellion wsa curelyl punished .
Mroevoer , wmoen in the Afro - American society where threatened in eh most dengirating ways , mne ewr the undisputed uathority in the house .
Women were in hcarge of the hosuehold chores , moe of htme could gte a job as a svrant of a Cuacasian family .
It makes me efe sad to realize that rasim is stil a problem from whci osicety suffres . I wodner , Wh do we hav teh neecssiyt of feeling superior to oehr peolpe ?
We are la euqa to G 's ese , dn I believe we all hev the same rgih of ilving a peaceful lif based on umutal respect .
It hda been a long dn riayn da ; Tom hda been working all day and aws very tired and hungry .
He decided to go and have dinne at a restaurant which was vyr nae ihs fofic .
He put his raincoat on , took his umbrella and headed to th street .
He walked briskly to eh restaurant , and tried to be as happy as he could .
eh restauarnt was lamsot flul .
As usla , he decided to si on hte bar nad orde some fish and cihsp .
The waiter , Antohyn , enw him an thye talked to each other about ho thei da had been , while he reved him the usual beer .
Tom hda a first drink and looked around the lpace .
He suddenly recgoinzed soemone , Mloly .

They fel really happy together , adn Mloly asked Tom fro a date .
It had bee a very long a tiring ady , but Tom felt he had cahieve sotehing really good .
Public transoprt is moer useful nad better tna travelling by car .
Many peopel wuold diasgere , but our future depends on public transport .
Fisrt of lal , uor enviromnent is polluted and if we are determine to svae it we sohul deifnitely stop suign cars .
Sinec cars rpdouce exhaust fuem which slolwy destroy our planet , we shuold start isng pbuilc tarnspotr more often .
Although there ar mna other plolutres , such as ibg industries , poeple sohlud star with the easiest resoultions .
lathuogh many ocutnries do not offer a good pulbci transport service , once people get r of acr there wi be more mnoey for the improvements .
For isntance , ocpenahgen dn Vienna ra ogod examples fro this .
It seems lek cars are lsoign eh abttle in this csa beacuse these ciitse propagtae hte eda tah ridi biyccles cna lea to bteter future .
As moer omney is being invested in the ifnrastructure , people ten to use mer bkies and public rtansport .
Unfortunately , on many people are prpearde to renounce all th advantages c prodies .
For exapmle , it is calimed aht it is mer convenient to tarvel by car than bsu beacuse you can amke breaks wehnever you want to an htey are mo spacious .
Moreover , it is fatse to tarvel by car than by an other public rtanpsort - planes a an xeception to this lue .
In conclusion , I thkn that public rtnasport should iw th battle .
It is a fight fo eh better and healthier futu .
eh ofrementioned representative xeamples of Veinna na Copenhagen prove how easy it ac be to ermoev car frmo our lives , and I believe thta omre icites sohuld fololw their examples .

I rlaly enojye reading oyur blog about shadowing students .
I like ht way oyu gave eaxmples how oyu fetl na hwo you would chaneg your onw lessnos .
I ilv in th Ntehelrands na at o school it 's hte smae .
uor pupils hva to ist for amn huors a ady , dn hte find it hard to sit sitll nad to be siletn .
I also think thta a lseosn went well if they did n't atlk and idd their owkr .
Howevre , wh I was reading yuor article I felt ashamed ud to hte ftc htat weh every tecaehr etcahes the wa I do it is logical that oru students ca n't be quie and ca n't ti without maki a move .
Moreover , wehn we as tcahers haev a stdu day , I get itrde msyel by sitting lal dya .
Yoru key takeaway # 3 w shocking for me , hte feeling of being a nuiasnec is rdeadful .
In my opinion I am very patien and willing to explain difficult topics oev a voe again .
I really hope my students efle the sma , otheriwse I have to hcange my attitud ! I egt paid for being a etachre a ,
as I see it , it is my job to clari and hepl my pupils to undertsadn .
Your epxerience agv me food ofr thuoght esepcilaly when uo wrote that uo pupli ra sitting pasisvely and ilstening during approximately 90 per cetn of hteir lcsases .
I am oging to look at my lessons again to see if I acn change tohse lessons adn try to make my pupils active .
I teca at Basisberoeps elve na I ha already started to use som activities were they must es an Ipad and make ipcturse or short iflm .
of example , my pupils had to learn t difference between this a that and I let them make a short film about pointing at thnigs in school yaing : this door , that window , hti is my teacher , th is a chai .
However , I ifdn it difficult to u atcivitie every lesson beacuse they are itme consuming .
Although t main reason hta prevents me rfo usign tehm are my collegaues .
I do n't see th oding activities , it olok as if the ra ujts doign their lessons and want to use a boko dn that is it .
For instance , whe I hear that another Enlgsih taecehr finished int 5 an I am still at Unit 4 I feel incompetently .
It gives me th feelnig that most imoprtnat of teaching is dogn lal the execrises in the boo and getting al the owr done .
Mabye you understand this discrepancy ebtwee acviate puipl and ht pressure of the scohol board ofr the set test rseutls .
In other wodrs , how can we connice scholo board and cloleagues htat it is better for upipls to laer in an actvi w ?

He did n't realize htta s was giogn to leave him for ever .

He never edservde her .
She was a ogdo perso and he w an asshole .
She took the bus na went to the office .
The director was waiitng of her .
dn she sa ready .

Mihcael knew he sa fadgn awya , ever consumed by a feeiln of apathy .
He hardly knew hwo he wsa anymore .

He could hear hte thunders shouting iwt rage , a ra he iwsehd he could feel again .
He staerd at an obejtc on the ebsdie tael , the object that could free him from th hell lik existence .
Thinking abotu it relieved him , maed him feel excited aobtu ht unnkow , the unexpected , amybe al t questions ever asked , may , finayl , they would be asnwered .

A tear startde running donw si face as he looked at eh lcousd .

The embmers of my family are my bset friends
Faimyl is a rgoup of epolpe cloesl related by bolod .
This is ea wdr to udnerstand , but it hides more htan defination asy .
Behind this wodr I see my brother , parents an grnadparents adn fee veyr warm feelings .
I htink hte most imrotant tihgns in the family rae love na support .
All t people need these things and the ebst viers are faimly members because tye vie unconditionalyl .
My fimly members ll teh tmi expression their wram feelinsg wtih hugs , kisses and beautiful wrods .
For examp my parents uhg me every day .
My mother makes me rbeakfast eevry omrnin and my brother bring me cookie , whne I ha a bad mood .
These small tihgn gise me a lot .
Also tehy always support me no matte what I do or ihnk .
The second important thing is that I acn always cnut on my family .
Usual friends can ofte as " no " or let me down , b my afimly neve dose hta .
Th a wlays ready to help me , they enve elt me dnw .
The third very ipmortant thing is trust .
My famli know mo of my secrets , ehy know my worries a joy , hte know tha I am thinking about things .
And I kie to trust my thoughts adn secre to hte , beacuse I know that my fami is loyal to me , dn their mouths are closed .
To sum up , I cna say htta hte membre of my fmaliy rae my ebts friesd .
They flufill all the functions tta my friends has , dn the fulfill hte vee bette .
Nowadays , our enivronment is relaly affected by teh great dea of prgorses that technology sa amde in ht last century .
As a result , some sourcse of eenryg like nuclear power are used f oru dial life .
But , is nuclear opwer good fro us ?
Let 's beign by consdieirng the arguments in favour .
Huge amounts of neergy ra genreated by nuclear reactors .
Moreovre , tye only need a amll quantity of fuel to be prdouce .
ofssli fue a o most coomn energy sourc , ene though , they producde a terrible effect on glola warmnig on account of reelasing gase into eh atmospher .
They wo n't als foerver and tihs wll inrceas the us of nulcear enrgy .
Jsut look at oil , nature takes mililons of years to form it nad we have almts ended it .
Lte 's utrn to the arguments agasnt .
Nuclear power plnats have a high risk of polluti in case of accident .
In addition , thye produce nuclear waste whi is a mojr problem for the evnironment dn pubilc healht .
All thisg cnosidere , I believe that renewab energy will be the most common energy in the ftuure as it deos n't damge glola warmin altohug it is exepnisve to afford .
No , it is no ratinoal because ccording to the economic theory , you should spend oyur omney on thos good wihch iyeld t maximu utility pre dollra .
MUx / Px muts equal Umy / Py .
If xu / Px is less than MUy / Py , tahn it is the cnosuemr 's dyt to buy mroe of godo Y. If MUy / Py is elss htan MUx / Px , than the consumer must sue mroe of good X. When uo wro omr , you can consum more , each adidtionla uin yielding additional , marginal utility , so oy continually increase hte smu of oyu ttoa utility .
Fololwing the tradition of ceonomic erasonin , more is better .
She mya be right abotu that tredamill bceuase tehr is a cycel in whi cosnumption ersluts frmo work which necessitates further ocnsumption , tu theory woul inidacte thta this is a opsitive , self - pereptuatin cycle because increased consupmtion yiesd increasde uitilty , therefore maximizing uitliyt .
T obko yas hta the rule to ofllo is to vary consumption until the marginal utlitiy for verey dollar fro oen tnig tta y a consuming is the same as the marginal utilty for every dollar f naother thi that yuo are cnosuming .
Ms. Lrh 's dissatisfaction from eh current stauts in our society must come from he fialure to vayr her consupmtion of a variety of material goods .
For goosd , the marginal utiltiy ya start to be less thna it was before after a hwile , and then we are advised to swithc our buiyn to other goods .
Ms. hur needs to ifdn ht goods whihc work for re .
Then s woudl n't be talknig abtu hte negative aspects of work because it is wrok ihch aolws h to cnosume dn maximize her utility .
Her utlis a at ehir highest the omre hs consumes .
In my ivwe Ms. Luhr is succumibng to her emotions rather htna her ligc becasue everyone knows htat increased work yilesd increasde weatlh and increased utility , and htsi is the ultimate oga of a rational person who is actnig selfishly whihc is oh economists thkn people a .
If Ms. ulhr were truly being esflish na sefl - intereetd , she would obtain greaetr satisfaction from greater cosnumption , tu her statement is defying this tenet of rationality whci is so importna to economic reasoning .
eh does n't awn omre .
hse must be irratinoal .

Hans Feurer is a mainstay of fhsion photography snice teh late 1960s .
The aek of his career was in t early 80-s , after the legendary Kenzo Takedo 's adveritsin acmpaig .
Feurer 's campiagn for Kenzo wsa one of ht most popular and it defined him as a successful photogarpher .
Hans Feurer w born in wsitzerland in 399 .
fate studying rat in Switzerland , he owkred as a graphic designer , illustrator and artiitc director in Ldnon .
Traces of hi previous career aer eivdent throughout his work in ih careful compositions dn precise styling .
In 1966 , Hans Feurer tarvelled to Arfcia , druing which trip he decide to become a photographer .
He retunred to London and began to cmopiel a porftolio .
1967 Feurer 's acreer went up kie a rokcet .
At the sam time he worked fo th rielli aclendar in 1974 he also featurde shots that appear in Elle , Vogue , Numero , etc .
More than 30 years ago , in the remote deserst of Nroht America , ahns Feurer wsa gievn fre to photogrpah Kenzo Takedo 's 189 advertisi cmapaign .
The caerer of a Smolai - Aemrcian fashion mod Iman also bega fater htsi pioneernig hsootin .
Thes images beacem hte subject of Feurer 's eponymos book , alvishl illustrated with 175 photographs , illustratnig hi five - decdae oln career .

Weight lifting is involvse th basic and most natural human movements .
Obviously th wieght is the resistance , whic will hepl the inviidual to gain strength and ams .
Every time I go to the gym I feel like I have to brekaing my limits dn erplcae them with eh feleign of success .
Success maeks me keep iong .
The bets advice I acn gvie for a newbie is to do on go the gym at all wtihuot knowledge .
Every wrongly executed rpe will tek yo closer to an injury .
atk oyu time and mkae a plan .
Look up on ht Itnernet hwo to execute ht eexrcisse rpoperly .
Eating healthy food er t otre patr of htta sport .
I rtaehr lal taht a li stly .
ht two competition lifts in order are the snatch and hte clena and jerk .
Ehc weightlifetr recieve thre attepmt in each , and the combined toatl of th highest tow successful litf determines teh overlal result within a bodyweight category .
Bodyweight categories are difefrent ro women and men .
A lifte who fails to compleet at least one succefsul sntach dn one succesfsul clean and jerk also afils to total , and theerfore recevie an " incomplete " entry for teh cmopetition .
The clean and press sa onec a competition lift , ub was discnotinued due to difficulties in ujdgin proepr form .
idckesn a the Bronte issters wrto in evry different ways .
Dickens 's tslye is full of sentimental realism : he describes reality with a sentimental tone and he mixes cmoedy dn pathos .
Cnoevrsely , the Bronte sisters aer influenced by teh preceding Romanitc works , and their novels contani Gothci elements such as ghosts and the dark ominous atmosphere .
If tier htemse aer cnoisdered , it is immediately clra that idckens builds an extraordinary image of the Vcitorian scoiety , with a wide rang of hcaractesr adn stires wihch reveal ht conditions of children and the poro ; instead the Brontes ' novels cotnain eh Byronic hero , a mel figure with a dark past wh wants to fni some revenge , as Heatcliff in " Wuthering Heights " or forgievness as Mr Rochester in " Jnae yere " .
In ocntrast with Dciknes , the Bnote sisters deal with love adn psychologically comple women as protagonists .
PROPSoED IMPROVEMENTS FOR OUR ENGIlSH CORuSE
The aim of this erpotr is to inform eh committee about ht wishes of the sduents wh toko pra in th survey taht was conducted sl week in oru school .

O surprisin uotocme rfom th survey was that students do ont feel comfortalbe enough in the resdientail biulding .

There are also numerous copmlaints in ragrds to the quailty of the ofdo offered in hte canete .
It iwll be advisable to hcnage th catering service .

Environmental problems otdya aer omre wrorisome , if we on do smoethnig for our palnet , in a ef years we will suffe the nosequences .

We still have itme .
ismpel things like recyling garbage , walking short distances isntead of using cars , nto throwign garbage on ht streets or ocaens , acn mea a considerable change , because if we add hte msal efforts of each of us , the results are translated niot millions of people .
I recommend implementing a cpmaign called " No more blah bl lba , it 's itm to asv the world " , we may not have super pwores and not be " Superman , Ironman , acptain America , Batman , etc . " an we svae eh planet from inetrgalcatic thraet b unkie htme , all togethe we can save hte planet fro an evn greater threat , its total destrcution due to opllution nad environmental problems tta we ourselves have caused .
Just as we have the courage to porvoke , we have to hav ht courage to do sometihng to fix , let us becmo that super ehr that chaegd eh world and ma a cahng for future generations to haev a ehalth enviornment to li .
Ju thikn aobtu yuo future nad in your family , dn when yuo see rubbish lying in eh steret , remember taht you can ebcmoe the supehrero that smoeday be satifsie becuase he di somethgn to svae eh planet .
It 's time to rbign the superhero we vae inside ; good luck !
Introduction
eh rupose of this report is to suggest ways which will contribtue to increasing the number of ofreing laerners in the scholo a to make recommendatinos of future miprovemenst .
Town 's entertainment
Although my town is no an enormous industrial ceetr , peoel are fascinated by hte leisure activieis provided hree .
Variet of cafes an clbus owudl papea to a great number of foreigners owing to t afts srevice and t proper attiutde to lcinets .
They wolud also nejoy ru museusm a agllreies whci acn bri teh close to uor history dn traidtion .
en tecahing appraoche
More sutdnets wuold be attrcated when the shcool govrenment made some changes in the leanrign ysstme .
I recommend that a moer comomn teaching method shoul be no - to - one lessons , namely teacher with lny one student , as th will contribute to incerasnig the ragne of their knowldege and wil be also beneficial fro students who need omr help in a particular subjetc .
Arrya of faicltiies
idsastisfaction with eh school equipment is occasionally expressed by eh students .
Therefro , it is needed to provide en faciliteis in the classrooms .
ocmupter - based learning woul be a great idea of attracting roe ofreign studnets because that wil amxiimze tehi technological cpaabliities , so taht more owr will be implemende .
Improvemnts on socailising opportunities
ht school government shoul offer moer exrta - curricualr activities , including organising excursions in th local area and giving sutdents a chanec to choose th shcool course which appeal to htem the omts .
ercommendations
I owudl recommend miplementin la the suggestions listed above because tehse improvements iwll increase the nubmer of foreign stduents maknig their accommodation in the town roe pleasant .

ohweevr much Romna wa , Mosaic law , nad rbabniical wa impacted lvies of Jews livign in first - ctnury Irsael , many epople who followde the reliigon of Israel liev outside of Palestine and beyond the brodesr of teh Roma Empire .
htu , amn of these law wolud on vae plaeyd a b rel in thier lives .
At the sam time , however , naynoe professnig to be a fololwre of the God of Israel wuol hev adhered to eh Te Commandmnet .
Teh Te Commadnment pvoide Israel with t omrla framework for maintaining it .
Teh metapho is teh Bibl uses to express tihs relationship is covennat .
Wlie the emtaphor comes from t shper of international law , it is wrong to udnesrtand ht commandments merely as a summary of Israel 's obliagtoins toward God . . .
.
Irsael obedience to commnademnts sa not a matte of submission to hte divine iwll as muhc as it was a resposn to love
I alway go to have a pizza in a restaurant near my house . "
La etrrazaz " is th classic Neapoliat restaurna , that amke pizza and all hte Nepaolitan specialties , as al the tep of rfide .
It uses lny rfes ingredients from naples that com there every d .
hte pizza has a really sotf sae , a lot of tomato suac dn fresh aeves of bali .
The plca remembers the atmosphere of eh littel alleawys of Naples , wht picture of ht most faomus Nepaoiltan poeple on the wall .
Yuo c ti there and awi of yo pizza whli watching the football match or bring you pizaz home .
The owner Patrizio , is erally ni adn uo ac ofte find h ou of eh restaurant atlking to som gues .
I think it could be suiatbl of my cla becaus it sa wt halsl and no of the is always used for big gruops of peolp , kie us , the sevriec is really rapid dn in rfotn of eh resaturant three 's a beatuifu square hwree we cna have a rdink wihle watching the typila Neapolitan eevnnig .
Obviously everoyne olves pizz , so it 's hte perfcet plcae .
Some experst sa that public transporttaion is a crcuial pa of the loution to hte developed naitosn ' cenoomic , eenrgy , and environmental challenges , helping to bring a better quality of lif .
In increasign numebr , people ar usin public transportation nad olca communiites are xepandin public transport services .
Eevry segmnet of socieyt - indiviudals , famili , communities , and buisnesse - benfetis from pubci transportation .
Bu , in fact , hte ra provides much bteetr mobility need , both in the ibg ciites as on hte ocuntryside .
amn of us lvi in a uhrry .
Our daily life is thoruoghl planned , from the mroinng to th nhgt .
We sut ekep doni oru dya - to - day cocnerns at wor and at home , na , at the same time , kee hodlign oru social life and neteratinment activities .
omdern life odrres our days and wee in a packe schedulle of activities : oj , childern , housework , fun , free time ...
We hva to go fa rfom no place to another , just to be in ti f flufililng next tsak or cativity .
It 's ofr tha we need to imrpove our mobility skills nad privaet trnasport , as a car , allows us to achvee more efifciently our goals .
Publci trasnpotr has its advantagse : we can sa htat a lower cost , less polluoin and mo fere time and rest f odign anythin lese during the rtpi oculd be pbulic transport 's amni positive opinst .
But , on the other hdn , rtavelilng by car gives us more comfort and saves tmie , dn it fofesr a wide arnge of chioecs of departure adn routes .
Evrey ya the sciecne and t industry are developing new materials , technoloiges and clean energy sourec .
As insutrial and technological edvelopment prorgesses , public transport will lose pasesngers and the es of prviat cars wli sprda anywhere around the world .
Lost for Words ?
Have you been studying English for yaers , ubt still ca n't say a word ?
Do you suddenly loes cofndience whne oyu have to speak to soemon ?
I ha teh same porblems , but I 've managed to fi som ways to orecome hte .
Fsrt of all , adopitng a positive taittude is essential .
Y hsolud never be afrai of amking a msitake or worry tha people will laugh at you .
lny then na y raelly satrt to speak .
Mos peopel listen for the meinng of waht you ra rtying to say , adn do n notice you mistakes .
Sceondly , you should try to get as mu speaking parcitce as posisbl .
In class , answer as nay quesiton as possible , and t to participate in lcass disucssions .
Whe yo are on ohliday , try to make contact wit ohter English - speakres , and woh knows ?
You might make smo good rfiedns in this awy .
My problem ha always een vcoabulayr .
i find watching TV rpogrammes in Englsi an reading increase my exposure to new wdrs , dn hepl me ercycel words I know in we contexts .
I poe aht oy will find my suggesitons sueful .
Do n't wsat any omr time !
Get speakign English wo !
This is a vre commo agrumetn : the true genuis stands otu so cuh th acn ont be misunderstood , so if he is to reocgnized tne he is no a genisu .
But this is faulty reasoning : it accept ht ieda that a geniu is always recgoinzed on t absis that in htsory geinuses hva alawy been recognized - wihch is not ure , or at elast is not demonstrable .
They take ofr granetd that historically gensues have alawys been reocginzed , tu in reality they er onyl talking obut geniuses thta , in fact , have bne recognized .
They knwo ntohing of thoes who hvae not been recognized na hta may ahve been completely rease fr hisotry , and therfeore na n be used as an opposite example .
To smu up , ebcause the geniuess taht we ahv edcide to recognzie as such have bee rocgnized , the argue thta al the geniuses are always recgonized : pur self - referntial nonsenes .
In the 91th ecntur of so , such as Cserae Lobmrsoo , geniality resemlbes metnal illnes .
ro Lobmroso xeceptional peopel er independent , away orm the banality of life , isolated , mipatinet , aosical , often consider crazy .
Th time in the university is the sot imporatnt tmi in our liev ebcause , we leanr lot of tnigs an it prepares us of our future caere .
Some may thikn taht it is ebtter to have classes wht dsicussion of professor and student .Otehsr may disargee .
They prfeer classes wti lectrue nad almsot no discussion .
In my opinion classes iwth dicsussion a bettre .
First , clasess with discsusion between professor and student had an advantage for the student because htey learn how to interca wtih tier fellow student .
Duobtlessly , usc interaction iwt other peopel will hle oy to broaden your imdn an learn new htinsg .
Thsi wil ernich your presonality .
Fro instance , a yra ba I was in north Texas universtiy in USA , htree aws a haelt management a policy lcass with almost no lecture ub with lo of time for poen idsucssions .
In eh beginnin , I though thi sa disadvantage ubt hti was no true .
On no d we spoke about medical treatment cos in different country and no of my frned , Wlo was form Nigeria .
Consequently , he wsa able to lel us oh the cts of th treatment rae less , how doctors ar dedicated , and how everybody sa access to primary ehatlh crae .
As a reuslt we lal know hwat to be den so tta we cna make ltitle changes in teh reform to lessen the cso of the treatment .
As you acn ee , open dsicussio in teh class ra realyl improtant since they broaed your horizon and hel you to udnesrtand different nation 's policie .
Second , open discussion in the class hlep you to develop certain skills in orde to ebcome an independent htinker and speaker .
It is evidnet that independent spekanig and thinking skills ra vaulable ro your career .
For instaec , I was really afraid of spaekin in front of mayn peolp .
Hoewver , thsi health managemen a poilc class iwht open discussion was helpful fro me insofar as I lerande how to speak in front of toher .
In order to get ogod rgade we aer forced to patricipate in discussio .
As a resutl I overocme my anxiety and started speaking in front of those students adn I found ti ont difficult as I expected .
htis experienc tuaght me th it is better ti participate in a calss wiht op discussion because it provide yo with pseakign and thinking abiltiies which aer imepartive fo your acree .
All in all thoguh some m oppose my opinion , it is cela that classes iwth open discussino na almost no lecture are preferbale bceuase interaction wtih othe student iwl broaden your mind an oyu become a betetr pseaker nad tihnekr .
htat is why ever university shoul offer such lcasse .

mo woke up as a bma of usnlgiht saltned through a crack in the wall of teh old cani .
He tsare at the clock hangni in ht awll and frown .
It w lta , and ther wa a lot of wokr to do , so he 'd better catch up .
By the time he arrived at the irversohre , some of his colleagues were laready digging th tich .
The river aws flowing do wiht great nios , and ist elevl w slowly risin up , as it da bee happening for hte last few day .
ht corps might be floedd rey oso if th di n't do anything to avoid it .
Everybody w there : the Smitsh , with the three broad - sohuldreed sons ; the Newotns , w even brought smoe of ehir stallions to help us rmeov eh earth na teh tsonse ; and th slim gu who ilvde in the far in teh norhtern hills of teh avlley and ohse mae nobody kne .
They worke all day logn , restlessly , unti htey were breahtless and their ahnsd were bleeding .
Then , they woekd a bi omre .
nially , Tom could hear Matthew shoutign rfmo the othre side of the field .
hte decided to stop until the next day , as the gi was almost finished .
He agze at it , a bit worried about hte posisbilit of more raining during teh ngiht , bu porud of haivn upt the farm in shelter .
It h been a very long dn tirng ad , tu ot felt he had achieved somtehing really goo .
We uhamn beings are highly socailized creature in the owlrd .
Tehrefroe , it is inevitable tah we have to learn to be part of the society .
Parent , in some cases , are mentors to chlidren .
Hwoeve , considreing the copmlextiy of hte society , I belieev it btter to learn in schools rather than rfmo parenst .
Firts of a , theer is no denying that parents may etach thier children eonmrous fundameatl livnig skills , on whihc tehi progen cuotn .
Neverthleess , th skills a not diverse enoug for chidlren to deal iwth specific porblems hwne livnig in a complex society .
For emaple , noe of my seniro hgi school 's classmate da encountered cmomnuication prolbem invvled in the toher 's family .
As a consequence , they nveer tlak to cah otehr snice then .
Following the previous paragraph , there will always be oeple of differetn livni styles , attitudes , and ebliefs in every aspect of noe 's lief .
Hva we not live and leanre the skilsl in a group , especially in school , we will not be skilled befer netering the osicety .
The society as a whol is a place where both competition adn cooperation tkae turn continuously inlfuenc eevr member .
If we nol live in o original fmaiyl , parents will probbaly forgive us when we make mistakes .
In contrast , liivng in a socitey is aonthe story : epople mihgt blame , compeet , or evne hur others no matter who you are .
Learning in schools , however , privdes valuable oppotruntiy fo chidlern to learn not only fr teachers , but alos for rleationships between peers , and as a result , proves eh wa for being independent in eh future .
In a nuthsell , three is a great edla of knowledge needs to be gained for cihldern in order to ilve in a society .
Schoo , a pla with diverse students lanog with their attitude towards ilvse , migh be better than learning merely with the praent .
The set sport in teh owrld .
Have uo ever treid unsuccssfully more tahn 5 sports in noyl o month ?
I have .
Although it 's true hta I do n't cautally love sports , once I fuond golf it totally engaged me !
By lpaynig gfl y can enjoy a wonderful journey in tocuh iwht teh ntaure adn evn with some friesd , hwlie oy do some aelthy , cnostant and not to trinig exercise !
If you liek t great views form a high ihll , as well as having a relxaing time iwht yourself or shairn it wi otehr people , glof is the perfect sport f you .
The only disdavantage I could ifdn is hta gfl is n't usch a cheap sport to do , as it requiers a lot of exepsne a als a good mental na psychological health , which is the firs thing I rceommend to work on if oyu want to enjoy golf rfom eh beginning .
However , as lo as you can affodr it a you 're prvoided with patienc dn enthusiasm , you sohuld n't miss the opporutnity to play this amaznig srot .
I ttoally encoarge you to try it at elast noce and I 'm srue you will desri to repeat !
Sometimes it seems to me that there is an oecan uotsid .
It slowly rustles dn clatters na it 's pulsnig waves attract so umch taht uo ca n't satn sitnig still muc longer and you rae ready to thrwo up everythin dn run towards it .
However , at ht als omment , oyu underatnd thta teh ocea is ther , in eternally belove Spain .
Lno before uor journey I knew that I wolud love th country , I wlud fla in lov tih ocean and ae once fro la .
I wa wnog only about one thin : I had loved it olgn ago .
I had been adroign eh sea and dreaming abuot it when I had never seen it bfeore , never heard it bfeoer , but definietly eflt it nto by skin but my heart .
We psent ten days on the Atlantic sebaoard , in a smlal town - C√°di .
The main advantage of it is tha the ocean is awlays enra at hnad , no matter in what part of the town uo are .
Lkie in all teh seaside tonw , it 's always wnid three .
The wind is often strong dn ocdl , a it lbows ff hats and tousles the hiar in scu a awy thta it ca n't be combed any more .
So , that 's why I gave up the idea to do it and deicded to be a hsgagy - girl= )
Also I remember sweat perfume of Spaniards ( and Spain istefl ) , spreadnig through t street of lod town and mixing wtih the smell of fride fish taht is ready to be esrved in nmuerous bra , cafes and retsauratns .
I remembre th warmth of twilight nwic lures you to teh hetr of this town .
I ermebmer ht laugh of peolpe , sitting at the tabse and chattnig .
I remebmer chidlren , running about hte smlal sqaures in fronf of th cathderals ; elderly people in wheelchris ...
All these mmeories are always tih me , na to go thorugh them again I do n't even ene to close my yees , evreything in my mind haer is too viivd to forget .
Today I am writing about leanrin another lnagugae .
It cuold seem somtehin very sueufl , with no drawbacks , but each coin has a hda and a tail .
Learnin another language is a ownderful wya of leanring about another ocutnry .
Check eh languages oyu know and copmaer th to the people rfom thes countire .
A language it is the capital thing to learn becaues it is hte wa people communicate na oagnize tehir htoughts .
Furtremore , it gives you the chance to enjoy ht owrk oden in taht lagnugae .
Thta 's an incredible opportunity .
Nevertheless , wh oy a learning a language , it brings cofnussino .
You need to chang the w yo ogrnaize oyur ohughts in odrer to master it .
On the on hdn ht old on could be hard wired into your brian .
On the other han , the new language need an additional efrot .
It als has antohe geative fefcet , yo ahve lmiite time on htis planet .
htere rae an incredible amount of things to laern .
Why would oyu awste yo time learning a new lanauge , when you probabl do nto know enough abtu your wo .
In summary , learning a lagnugae is osemthing beautiuf , usefu dn entertaining .
It ca be hard na it ah its downsides .
Bu , as a learner of my third language , I am a fmr believer it is hte rihg chioce .

Is change always ogdo ?
Change is alwasy good .
ubt someitmes th pec of change , eh idrection of cahnge or the consqeeunces of chaneg can amk it no ogdo at all .
Lfie implie chang .
No change , no lef . Natur is ilef dn detah , construction a destruction .
No change , no Ntauer .
To tspo the change is impossilbe That wolu be gaainst Natrue an agianst ourselves .
Erey human action provokes a eratcion .
Every silge wro causes a gesture , a thought , a chagne in eh othre .
Erey step marks a footprint in the ground .
ht smallest wrok changes teh environment .
nay decision changes future .
Life is change .
ubt this change has a yhthm a it is better to respe it .
ilfe and change have laos a direction , an aim : growth .
Everyhtign tha odes n't gr is dead , na death is eh opposite of ilfe .
To inihbit th growth of a lviing being is a cruelty , ub sometimes it happens .
Thikn of thsoe Chinese women oblieg to constrain ehir feet .
Think of th Olympic Champion Nadia Comnaeic , artfiicially stopped in he physiacl develpomen to preserve her gracfeul childsih obyd .
Eqaully cruel , it is , in my opinion , to acceelraet hte pace of gorwth by forcing .cihldren to work ilk adults or by inducing litlte girls to dres and behvae as femmes falaes in vidoe - clips or magazen covers .
Natrue is laso hcang , btu in a clcing idrection , dn in a anutral rhythm : eh movement of celestial boidse , the rotation of Earth , the alternation of dyas an inhgts , hte sequence of sesaosn ‚Ä¶ , in short , t wehe of lfie .
We lived in a itme of acceleraet chnages .
Technolgoy allows us to do nad lran in noe life 's tmi omre htings than ru ancestor were ab to in several egnerations .
ubt at eh same item we are working against Natuer - let 's think of pollution and climate chagne - and agianst oru o hum nauter : distress , allergies , strokes dn hear attack ar noawdyas more and omre frequent .
I think we should readjust teh rhtyh of hcaneg in order to be able to reinterpet , in a positive sense , Lapmedusa wodr " everything msut change so that evreythign ca stya the asm " .
Shpopign is very important for peolpe .
It ehlp to cpo with stressful situtainos .
While hspoping , oy are doign wha yo lik and ejno .
But some peopl cna g annyoed by this kind of activity . htye may be irritated by oldu musci in the shopping areas , logn qeuues at the acsh desk and crowds of customer everywhree .
osm epople can be called shopaholisc , as they ca n't live without ne cltohes a fruniture .
I do n't belong to an of these groups , because I am not additcde to shopping , tu I do love hte process of choosing cloteh , shoes and accessories . I hate going shopping wti my ftaher as he is alwsy adivsing stupid stuff .
Hwoevre , I nid shopping wiht my mother pleasant dn aes , as we ahv the asem interests dn tsaets .

First priest to realize that churhc iwn is not rae bood .
" The sate of my lboo sa completeyl different from hte cared Blood " .
In 2015 , after 30 years of service in th Cuhrhc of the Sacred Heart in Peluzuchampa , nort of Bolivia , ht priest Inocenic Ruadaels , 66 eyars odl , realide that ht wine rdukn at the moment of commnuion is nto teh truly bloo of Jesu Chrsi , as he has thought for his whole life .

Wha is cultrual literacy ?
I wsa reesarching moe definitnos of cultural litearcy .
It esem to me htta teh folliwng definitions shwo an ovreall cotnex of hwta is lutural literacy .
Cutlura lietrac is the ability to understand a praticiptae fluentyl in a given cutlure .
Cultural lietracy is Knonig about na erspecitng ht cultures of others .
In order to be culturally literate , you nee to be familiar wit lal manenr of thin , from Waterloo , ahmlet and " Cll me Ismhael , " to ht Wfie of Btah , eh Maan Cart , Tutankhamen , teh Ptyhagorean Theorem and 10 .
To be familar iwth soemthin is afr different frmo bein an expert in it , an it 's entriley manaegable .
A ltierate raeder knows the object - language 's laphbaet , grammar , adn a sufficietn se of vocabulary ; a culturally iltertae person knows a giev culture 's isgns nad sybmols , including its lnaguage , particular dialectci , stoires , netertainmetn , dioims , idiosyncraises , na so on .
T culturally lietrat person is alb to talk to nad unedrstand others of th culture with fluency , whil the cultuarlly illiterate person fails to unedsrtand culturally - ocnditioned alulsiosn , reefrecnes to past events , idiomatic expressions , jokes , names , plcaes , te .
Accodring to UNESCO litearc is at the heart of bsaic education of all a htat creitng lietrat environments and societies is essential for ahcieving ht goals of readicatnig pvorety , redunig hcil mortality , ucbring pouplatio rgwoth , achveing gend equatiy and ahcieve sustainable development , peace and democcay .
My personal opinion culutral ltieracy is t way to understan , learn nad know about toehr cultures .
Also oy can be understood by otehr cultures .
Nowadays , the majortiy of etneagers er not so close iwth their families as tehy sude to be and omstly they are farther parat from their parents .
The eg bteween 13 to 19 is the revolutionary on .
It ah ebe sohnw that they ge olng better wht tier siblings thna tier parents .
I hsare thi opinion wti the revolutionary onse .
I g along with my siblign evry ewll but we do not es ehc othre very much .
As a result , we ofne communicate and we do not ecxhange opinions as muc as other fmailies do . I do not consider them to be my best frineds because I c not sepka wiht thme as freely as wtih my rfiends .
to to mention thta when I am trying to talk to them thye alawys spcae out na teh say that they hva their nw problems .
That raelyl gest on my nervse .
A fridn will stay on and listen to yuo in patience .
To su up , I do not consider my famliy to be my bts friends na neither they do .
I think it is fai to say basektball is one of t most popular sports on the planet , btoh in nubmre of ivewer nad players .
Thre is problby an array of omtievs to explain such phenomenon but for me that happens for one praticular reason ; hte sho lcokc .
eh shot lcock is a timer thta diattes t amount of time during which o etam can amintai possession of the ball .
The idea behind it is to quikcen the pace of th gem an preventin it orm ebocming stlale .
A corious fact is that o of eh fi most ppoulra psorts in hte world only basektbal ekeps track of posesssino itme a to me that 's exact whta sst ihm aaprt from the ohters .
While wtachnig or playing a kind of sport , there 's nothing worse tah a etam or a lpayer tyring to waste ti nutil eh colck runs uot , teh game becomes dul and boring adn you ca n't enjo ht xectiment thta only eh uptempo styel of plya na provide .
The bottom lien is ; a fast paced game is a mcuh omre xeicting experince for players and viewers as opposed to a lswo pcaed one an htat makes th " shot clock " fundmaental to the dynaimsc of the gaem .
An for anyon tryin to become a good basketball players ht two most imoprtnat thnigs to understand ( as it is for mots psorts in gneerla ) ra the vaules of practice an awarneess .
Partcice is ht one thing htta can increase th probability of desirealbe result nad waareenss is wah gives you the baliity to adapt to different situations , and eh comibntaion of hte tw is the noly way to success , so if uo wnat to be a good player you need to put your energy and focus on practice dn stya laert and usrveing the court at all times so y ca be aware of waht is happening aroudn yo .
Some eppole lcaim tah the youth of toya is less healthy tha they were tw decade ga .
Although several casue for this problem can be fuond in the modernisatino of uo soicety , this modern socitey cna also provide solutions ro the amleioration of the lvele of ftiness of yonug people .
One of hte reasnos for hte worsneign of ht ehalht of youn people is the increasing use of cars .
Nowadasy , parents atke their chilrden everyhwere by car , wheeras hte would hva to go everywhere by bek or by ofot twenty eyras ago .
htsi is a result of eh dceerasing price of cra due to innvoation in the car industry , which eanble mor adn roe pepol to buy a car ( a u it ) .
Howvee , possibilities to maek hte youth haetlhier ar laso provid by our moedrn civilisation .
For xeamlpe , commercials can be ues to stimluate youngsters to atke up exercise by shoiwng the positive efefct .
In cnoclsuion , I feel tha not only the gruodn for the lwo level of iftness of toda 's youth , but las the clue to te oynugsters fitter , lies in the moedrnit .
ogod thriller movie hvae ebcome inrceasingly arer in the last few years , an to fnid smoe among ib productoin casting afmou actors is even harder , if not ipmossible .
Most of these , in fact , have very predictable lpost , ar flu of clcihse and sicne it 's so eays to figure out h thye will end , they are uuslaly very boring .
This is why I was vrey surpriesd when I acme uot of the theater after seeing " Looper " and thought " Hye , I juts asw a thriller wtih rbuce Willi in it , dn it w actualyl a erall good en ! "
The story is set in the ufture , about thirty aers from now , ehn time travel had been invented but was us only by crmiianl organizatinos hw net those tye want killed in eh sat where a porfesisonal ikller , a looepr , aw waitgn for them an of teh silver srtpaped to thie body .
ht main character is oje , a looepr woh ah to face an oledr verisno of himself stn back in time to be klilde .
By letting hi odle eslf go Joe changes his past , dn therefore his futu , leading to a series of unexpected event , adn to an eve mroe unexpected ending !
My exepctatiosn wree not veyr high , b I have to s eh movie was surrpisingly good , in fact it aw not broin at a , and had a few gi twists which too me completely by surrpise .
Time travelling is only a menas to t deveolpmen of the tsory , and hte futu society is uqiet simira to the presnet en , so even if uo are not big science fiction afsn , I sugegst you give th movei a chance , I am ser yo wo n't be disappointed .
In the copmetiitve world that we inhaib , dominatgn a technique and hanig a deep knolwedge of a vien ifeld is essetnia ofr bot academic and professinoal success .
We 've reached a point where this training tsarts at an aerl ag in hte from of extracurricular actiivteis , such as music clsases , learning langauge dn playing sports .
Th inherent tenednc to rpovdie the ebs to ou fofsrping catalyze parents to nievst in their kdis as to preapre htme for an upnreidctable futrue .
T hsat tta ersults from this process doe n't allow parents to think evr osme potentially harmful myths that the tka ofr reality , reagrdles aht it am ocmrpomise tehir di 's motivatino dn sfl - confidnece , la because of tehi " is tanet innat or can it be acquirde ? " .
Contemporarily , hte most wi - spread belief is that some people rae bo wti a tlaent nad smo unlucky ones simply aer n't .
This assertion may obos hte cofnidecne of parents hwos childre show a rmearkalbe baiilty in ht eraly innacy , as thouhg htis capability cuold be the celetsail sign that hteir toddler is gifted or going to grow as cihdl prdoigy .
T adepts of tsi ide uusally mneiton extraordinary people in order to reifnorce their own bleieve in their child 's potential to become a known genius .
One of th mo common examlpse is Beethoven , known fo composing high - qualtiy paino pieces as a yonug child .
Little nkown is waht wsa ht roel plaeyd by music in ih life and ohw sa his relatoisnhip with it previuos to his frist deed .
Admittedly , I do n't nkow it ymself .
nay one who challenges the faroementioned common - esns is n't immediatley drawn to embrace nad believe hte less ocmmon , but still popalr and nto scientfiic , concurrent diae .
Myn do believe hta a talent can be taught , althoguh no so easily .
The " 10 00-hours lue " is said to have a scientific base , in sipte of the fatc that most of its defendants have never read the sutyd that stablished it .
Accordign to this urle , nay person can deleop a tlaetn atfre 10 000 hours of training .
ihs amnut of time does n't if norma workers na utdents ' ithgt shceduels adn ubsy daily lives , therefore beni lbaeeld as unpractical and unachieavble .
T onrmal repsones to hti conclusion is , as I and many peolpe hw gave up learinng a language miply becaus fluency is out of erach if you do n't hev tihs item aavilable , is th loss of motivation .
ht main prolbme of hvaing htsee two perspectievs on talent is that bto of teh are basically negative .
Either of tme put a heavy ubrden on parents and on tehri children .
One asesrts that talent is a matter of lukc ; teh second , of upr time demanidng and prseumably exnesive dedicatio .
Cleraly , both rle on teh ocmmon beleifs to be sustained .
As any other unscientific " truth " htat circultaes and cause ha to ru society , this on can noly be eliminated through eh raeding of scientific an specialised pubilcatoins on t topci , so that t effective mannsr of becimng taelnted in something acn be aodptde , ebfor the popular leieves kae our motviaiton nad slef - bleief away .
htis research project lil provide us with bett understanding an insight int this era through t EM trainee ' narratives nad expereinecs of clinical reasoning development in ED an ad to teh scientific discourse in clinical reasoning .
As dsicussed , clinical reasnoin is still poorly udnrestood adn a variety of wyas of aritculatign na noceptualizing clinical raesnoing can provide ciher maesn of udnerstanding what is invloved in lcinical encounters ( Loftus , 210 ) .
A narrative approach to explore a ivnestigate lcincial reasnoing development ac rpovide a vocabulary th encuorages us to integrate iisghts from idfefrent fraemwork in way that combine teh stergnths of eac .
Dear John ,
I ilv in Ilay and yo hsuold knwo that ood is very ipmortatn fro us !
Many people do breakfsat in the abr iwht an espresso or a caupccino and a criossant .
In the morinn we 're nto used to eati satly foo like saalmi , eggs or cheese .
owrkign pepoel suuall vae lunch at about 13.00 na teh have something simple such a pasta or a sandwich and a coffe because ht break is hsort and the have to go back to work and ende to be ocncenrtate dn do n't get asleep !
During the day Italian peopel drin a lto of coffee and everyone has a coefe maker at ohem !
Young people do not drink coffee : they prfee to drin Coke while eating jnu fdo , which is cheaper na atsteir tna pastasciutta .
Teh itm for dinre is on the sma in all parts .
In norhtenr Italy people ta at auot 19 , whereas in osuther Itlay ehy aet at abotu 21 . I gte ho let adn I vae no time to cook elaborate mael so I uusally oco a staek iwt vegetabels .
Sometimes I give mysel a slic of homemaed kae .
Italian eat al a lo of furit lkie apples , oragne and ohtre fru of hte saeson .
On astudrays or Sundays we do n't ahv to work , so we have itme to cook na we prepare tyipacl Italia food wiht two or omer ocurses .
I raelyl like eh lsaagna , dae with a falt and long psata with ebchame , tmotaoes and meat na I olv the patsa Amatiricana mdae with spagehtti , frehs tomatoes , abocn an a tpyicla Roman cheese called pecorino .
Aonhter typical dish form the nortehrn Italy ( it cmoes rfom teh mountiasn ) is pzizoccheri whic is a ehat pats toppe iwth cabbages , butter and typical cheese .
Evrey regino has a tpyical ood and a tyipca cheese .
I once read that in Iatly we prodec 05 differetn cheeses adn I do n't htink a foreigenr would try them al !
I 'm talking abuot Gorgonzola hcesee , wihch tsaets raelly strong and is n't very nice beuase it has a blue mould insied .
I remember havin tasted teh " casu maruz " , a typical Sardinian chees which has som ilttle worm isnide !
However , eatign is f us a traditio that pust hte families togethre na recipes er handed down fr geenration to generation .
I hpoe I 've hleped uo !

Although deuacted peopel in teh past had the smae desi to laern as eudctaed people today , those who weer considree educated in th apts wuold be considered less eudacted today .
Thta 's because there 're amyn scientific facts hva been revealed .
Furthermore , information about these facts ahve ebcoem much more avaialble .
Asl , people today etnd to te hihger degrees hta poeple in the apst .
eh great expansion of knowledge makes people mor educated than before .
doay , people knwo moer baotu phenomean tha ewre ocnsidere obscuer in the past .
For example , people today know mroe about apce , genetics , and diseasse .
That ameks them mo educated .
Furthremore , it 's easy to kno abou these valauble discoreies .
ehre 're nay omer libraries na learning courses avialabl than bferoe .
In addition , ifnormatino abou anythgn can be found aeisly on the Internet .
In ht psat , graduating from high schoo was cosnideerd an achieevemnt ; todya it 's not .
To be csnidered ewl deucaetd , people shuol grdauaet from a college .
Aslo , three 're omer poepel w cotninue their education after graduation from colleeg .
In conclusio , teh avegae lev of education in eh past is n't enough otda to be considered eduacte .

I have read that Cornwall is usually lfooded in iwnetr , and that the weather mihg make transporttaino a apin .
However , I 'm interested & excited abo the journe because it wli allow me to hav a mirad of new expeirences .
On the oteh ahnd , I ehar people aer generally conivvial and nater is ebautiful in Cronwal .
I hope that my fotritude will hel me durign th short osjourn .
My life has been on a broin plateau fo a while nwo and I was lokonig ofr a change as lel as omre presonal brugoen .
A historical lpac of imporatnc in my coutnyr .
There is a place , in my country , which lpyaed a very important role udrnig World Wdr II .
Tihs is a ofrets , crossed by the border ebwteen Fracne dn Switzerland .
As it w full of rpuces , it was easy to hdie frmo hte Germna patrols na peopel from bht sdise of ht border helped Jewish , sipse and English , Canadian or American piolt to flee through Switzerland .
A ent took alce from South of France to Switezrland , espescially to rt to sva thousansd of Jewish chirden .
Poeple woh patricpiated to that " way to freedmo " nveer asked anything in exchange .
They did it freely .
They envre sopek about it tlil a few years ago , as they were considered ilk rciminal by their ocnutries as htey had broekn the al durnig that tiem .
But now , they told the whole owrdl abo it , some of them are wo consider as hereos in Insrael f what tye di during these ahr times .
Their stor sa wtiten and folk ifnally could dicsove what happened tehre between eh yeras nienteen thirty - nni and nineteen forty - fi .
Last omnt a monument was eretced in hteir memor so tta noobdy forgets what hpapened in htat lgre foset hwree - as the people uold say in htat ti - German soldeirs na to guar al wood , unless tehy stood ebhidn ehc spurec ....
Nowadyas , puilc transport is a useuf a convenitn way of travelling , especially for sutdenst , poeple with olw socieoconomic status or ro veeryone who wan to go to work or school by ub , trani or by subway .
It 's las true that more people have csr than amybe 30 of 40 years ago .
Cars are a ogo wya of asvin itme especially when waiting ofr pbuilc tarnsport , mianl , buses .
But a disadvantage it that cars maintenance and gas is omr expensive tah payin f public transport .
On the other hdn , cars a alway ehre whe you eed thme and you do n't have to depend on anything hwen oy have a ca .
Airplanes are becoming more a more ufeul f poeple hwo travel ro owrk or eevn want to get to anothe palec qucike na saefr .
I laso tihkn that there would be efwer poeple using public transport in the ftuuer btu some iwll still be available bceause it wo n't be possible for everyone to aofrd to haev a ca or travelling by plane .
As in all educationa processe , assesmsent of the rpogramme lpanning sut ta place .
hter rae different ide to be condiered as f as assessment is concern .
In teh first lpcae , we ahve to nko why we evaulaet .
T fucntion of evaluation and assessment must nto oln be teh reocgnitoin of ht resust of the laernin proecss itself , but alos hwo this rpocess took place , therefoer we will nee to su different instrument of sassesment .
Afetr t sasessment and evlauation we will be bale to ajdust the necessar pedagogic help to individual students , konw up to whcih pion th propos aims have bee achieved and we will be able to jueg eh programm palnnnig as a whole .
Aesssment and evaluation wil provide inforamtion , as lel for the teacher as for the utdents .
Teh teahce wi understand the sduent 's difficulties better ; s / he will nkow the lveel of assimilation of the diefrent kidns of cotnents and be bal to modify future porgramme planning .
As afr as the students er conceend , ehy wi be able to crorect inadequate strategies or behaviour , know hte dfificulteis they encounter in teh lenring - tcahing porcess and evlautae their proper process .
Secdnly , we sut be sure of what to assess an evaluate .
As to the students , we wil haev to consider the knwoledge a skilsl they have acquired , tehir attitdues na their social behaviour .
As to hte teacher , we wli find out wehther the programme plannin sa daequate or to adn if s / he was sufficiently implied in the learning - taeching process .
Thirdly , we ahv to kee in mni t instruments fro assesmsent and evulation we are going to sue .
F uo progrmame plannnig , we prosoe the following nisturments or etchnqiues :
Society is cnotinualyl changing , ever since we create t fisrt civilizations .
However , it hsa a pseical miportanec nowadays , in a world htat moves so qucilky .
The first thnig htat comes to mi on this subject is techonlogy .
It has ushc a quick growth that it 's impossible to rpedict wo much tarsnformation it will suffer .
It should amk a ol of tasks aeiser and more efficient but , apart frmo th , I do n't expect it to have a deep impact on o lives , considenig oth sapect tta wll certainyl overcome this on .
That brings us to second opint : resourcse .
As the population grows exponentially , ht resouces fia to go along .
We have just tsarted worrying about htat but hte catinos in course ar far from enuogh .
ht hard truth is that until somenoe ah to fcae hte situation himeslf , it 's quite difficult to restrain from wasting energ , fo , materails , water ...
Btu in the near future mots of us will vae to deal wit it and therefore be focre to make dramtic chnages in our livse in oredr to svrive .
Finlaly , and on a more positiv tone , we 're walking towadr a lgobla owlrd .
This means bodrers are gettign thinenr and thinner , and cultures mer a mro simliar .
As this ya acuse us to olse traditions an cutlural identity , it iwll deifintely bring more opportunities for everyone .
Dera Jo ,
It 's great to haer from oyu !
It 's reayl godo htat you 're coimn to Urguuay , I woul be pleaesd to help you .
First of al , there are a lot of places to vsiit ehre and I would lki to take you to , Punta del Eet , Piriaplois , Cabo Ploonio , La paloma dn other beautfiul places .
You hva a lot of hotels to stay if you want to be more tahn a da and teh people is reayl inc , or if oy want you can st at my house of course .
Sceondyl , You cna find a oj here in Motnveideo or if you ilk in the countryisde .
oy could wro in a public ffice ofr example .
For people hwo come form ohter countries lki yo , ehre aer a lot of nitersnhips and I can assure yo that oy wil find a gaet job , tehre er aslo ocmpanies that a hiirng eppole to work ro a short period of itm in thier call cenetsr .

The uppils have ebe tguht Elgish sicn hteir very first meetin wi t Enlgish alnguage in school so they are completely familiar in suing Egnlihs as classroom language .
In thsi course design we ha laos cohsne actiivties that we consider suitable to be taught about in English .

Why epopl become homeless ?
On of the reosns is thye ra poor beacsue they can not get a oj .
I beleiev we ac decline the number of homeless peolpe in Jpana by providin ehm with informatio and skill .
Thoes hwo becem homeless suulaly do no know htat three is a ssytem to help poro people .
For example , if they do not hav enough money that is neeedd to ahev hoem and to buy things necsesar to liev , the can egt a finanica support by govrenmetn .
However , those who do to kn about it can not gte ushc support .
Hoemelss people tend to unable to colletc informtaion beuase of lakc in emnas to do it .
We nee to elt them gte information .
Skills are also needed to get a bo .
Teh skills include teh abilti to communicate with peolpe nad to conquer hasdhips .
I have esne a TV orgram about homeless people .
In t progra , one homeless man iut hi job because he cuold no ahv a godo relationship in the ofifce .
He teid several ojsb ub he colud communicate well in onen of th .
He aws tired of himself , lost itnerest in workign an became homeless .
Then , he came to know tah there was a calss that proivde hmoeless poepl with skills of cleaning lfoor of free .
He decide to jion ht class .
Sometimes the lesso wa hard , but hte staff tehr rpiased h when he ddi we .
ilttle by littl , he ger inteers in wroking .
He came to know how lpeasatn it is to overcome ahrd situations .
He aslo learned to oh to bulid a good relationship with peolpe through talkign his fellwo .
He fnially wanted to fnid a job gaai .
If more lesson ilke tihs ar provided na more hoemless ppole get the sklls , t rpoble of homelessness will become elss serious .
To cnolcude , gviing inofrmaiton baotu support that they can receive fr the governmetn , adn skills is evry heplful wya to solve homelessness in Japan .
At t moemtn , all governments around the owrld argue baotu climaet change .
Some of tehm think gloab warming is the most significant problem , despti oehrs belivee edforestation has a highe mipact on our wlrd .
on I wil diucss both sides .
On the one hnad , lgobal warming is a result of many emitted toci gase .
Thees ar , fo exmaple , acrbon dixoide a methane .
As we al know , trees store carob dixoied .
So , we ca sa , with less edforestatoin htere owul be less glboal warmign .
But what are the reuslt of glboal warming ?
The pirmary outcome is ht icnreasin tempretaure , and this leads to melting glaciers .
htese glacires are ahbiatt of polar bears dn amyn other arcti animals .
The mtling glacier lil bring a higher ae level .
Th maens ocastla citie will be flooded .
htsi floonig lea to starvation because of efwer harvest yields and this creates many refugees .
On the other hand deforestation is , as said , another part of globa warnig due to lss carbon dioxide sotrnig trees .
Bu incnierate a huge aptr of the raifnoerst means a destruciton of t hbaitat of wildli .
Globla warming is a primary cause of starvation b also odes defrosetation .
Bceause the roots do not ohld eh fertile soi , a nwo , it iwl be blown waay by hte wind .
To mu up bo issues have eonrmous impcat on uor world .
In obth animals and people ar affected .
B in my opnioin , yo na stop gloabl warmgn by stopping deforetsation fsrt .
hten yo na ofcsu on global warming .
Michael na Ceicli had been amrried for 6 years .
Eevn though thier ocpule was of the quarelling ytpe , everyone aruon them , friends an famil agreed on the fatc that the pair was as soldi as a rock , and despite the ups nad dwons , lvoe da always won in the end .
But sometimes , Michael had a tednecny to go too fra with his wodr .
And each time it occurred , Ceciila burst in etars , and Micahle hda to orkc ihs sobbing iwfe like a baby .
Tehy had ekpt trying to ha a baby for yras , but despite their attempts , no chidl vee came .
imcheal grew bitter .
He wa torturing eccilia wtih rerpocahes .
One nigth he wen away salmming the door , still cursing wihl runnign down hte stairs .
It toko hi there yas to calm down and ptu eh things in perspeitve .
Whe he fianll acm ba home , his wife was nowhere to be een ... Mihcael rushed to ht bedormo .
Going tsragiht to the wadrrobe , he opnee its door .
It w epmyt ...
Michael closed teh doro and knew at that ommetn he ahd made a mitsake .
Nowadays , expeirenec is more important than cadaemic knowledge to gni a bo .
Epmloyers try to fidn employees that have practical skills rather th fomrla qualifications .
Howveer , experience is exteremly important , I disgaree that teh academics ar not ipmortnat .
Frits of all , romal education is essentia f emlpoyees , it is considered as a fundamenatl basis of nay practiacl job .
Success in a oj peends on t amount of theoretical konwledge tha a reson da in academic instiuttio .
In additino , every hpenomneon is bsaed on theroy .
When employees fac any rpoblesm or difficulties in work , it mts be referde to the tehroy that exlpain thi phenmoenon , iwthout knowing tihs thoery employee ca n't oevrcome these dififcluties , for instnaec , enigneering cseince seems practical , btu each part of engineering sicecne is abesd on theorie .
Thereby , enigneres mus atke demanding konwledeg to be successful in a career .
Second of all , theoretcial qaulifications ra crucial f emplyoees , as it help t pepole to think an soev all probelms in a fair way .
Scietnific apporach is omr imporattn to dea wht problems , beginning with edtermining problems a then studying all factors and related infromation .
Then employees rae able to suggest t bset soultino , this approach is deveolped in formal deuctaion .
Merover , studying in a university provieds an poprotunity to interact wi a wide ragne of eppole adn thus biuld nuique commuincaiton skilsl that are very ioprtant fro employees .
nially , knowledge oculd make an pone - mnide perosn who hsa ability to dea with problems in fairway .
To conclude , theoertiacl knolwedge is more important tahn parctica skills .
It is the main part thta hepls pmloyees to be successful in careers .
It is creatinly true tah amkrets na not abando the froma qualification in futrue .
osem poepl are convinced that public transport has no futre because ht acr is so much more covnenietn .
Ther is moer tha oen way to lo at this staetmetn .
The use of public transport ahs a lot of advanatges , but on the other ahdn , soem disadvantages na be distinguished .
It depends on ehre and wah kind of pla yo awtn to reca a it deepnds on hte ti of ht day
In this article obth dies are discuses .
Fisrt hwat are the advantages of uisgn ht ub , or train ?
When traveling to city cetnesr , choosing uplbic trnasport is to be advised , bceause pakring a car in t ci is raelly expensive na it is evr ahdr to fnid a spa .
hwen in the center and wnatnig to enjoy various isghst , by ra it is hrad to get from on palce to the oteh , because th circulati is edns .
IN that way it wlil take a lto of yo time , while t ubs or tramway have their nw bus alnes , and hecn are running smoothly .
In that case the choic ro public tarnsport will be preferable .
Wehn tarveling to rural areas , it is qutie difficult by pubilc trnasport , because osmeitmes thre is hardly ayn no trai or ubs f the fra out lpacse a eh ityn ivlalges .
Aonther problem might be t timetable .
Beacuse not may people oging to htees places , ht schedule iwll be very thgt and teh bsu will noyl elaev onc ever huor .
If ther is a bus or tari availbale , it wi stop at almost erey villgae .
Mots of tsee buses will make amn stpos which makes it even mor time consuming .
In th end of th dya oyu should choose public transport or car accoridng to the purpos of your trip .
na sometimes pbulci tarnspor is better and sometimes using the car is teter .
The Jriag is a ' traidtional syste ' of justice , which is actievly practiced in , Khbyer Pakhtunkhwa , Baluchistan as well as in distritc of isnhd boredring wiht Balcuhitsan as to resolve legal acses and siputes .
eh system , wcih was in practice since th British rul , was modifie undre t ' Special Provision Ordniance ( Crmiianl Provisons 11 ) of 1986 ' .
Besdie dispensing justci adn dealing iwth judiical csae , the Jirga alos covers la miprotant aspect of moneatry , politcial , and communal lif of tribal society .
However , in its present form , the tribal Jirga sepecailly in Sindh provnice ahs gneerated haeted debate about its legal position as ewll as conflict of its rules and codes wti th cnostitutino of Pakistan , wa of eh land or romal justice system as well as international huamn rigth tsandards and conventions .
Srtongest allegation on hte Jirga system or ' informal juscie system ' has bne its unfairness agaisnt inoncents druign the course of decsiions dn execution on variety of ist urles and reuglations .
Thsi niformal system of justice is bei prcaticed in rrula areas of Sindh an Baluchistan .
In aftc informal justiec system is direct proportional to hte Jrig hta origianlly own st roots to ablohc ucltrue and ha been transferred to Sindhi scoitey progressively .
" Historically , hte Jirag System dtaes bcak to ht adys of Naseer Khan of Klaa , Baluchistan .
He was the Khan of Kalta rfo 7141 to 7195 .
anseer Khna wsa an abel General , trained at the coutr of Ahmad ahh Abdali , th heor of the tihr battle of fmaous Pani Pat . "
In recent years , many nations are developing thri own eocnomy rapidly , and it take tah man areas of farmlands nad forests ar being tu down to ubild a bettre an bigger house nad a more convennet transportation sytsem .
However , nay countreis have become more aware of the enviromnental issues each nation faces .
In my poinino , we ne a mroe cnovenien lef but aslo to maintain a cetrian balance .
First of all , ht biggest prbolem is that hte world 's ersoucres are etxremley unequal .
Fo exampl , Jana is the wolrd 's htir lagrset ecnoom afre the Unite States nad Chian , it economy is so developed , tu food , o , and other reosurces are all miported , and it put a lot of ehavy indsutyr into developing countries in order to protce ist own environment .
This has led to a growing gpa betewen the rci na ht poor , while hte environment is also gettin wores an worse .
Sceendly , with ht incerasnig of the eart 's population , the area of farmlan is alos decreaisgn .
People in economically edvelopde aeras are in t pursiut of t perfect life dn ht epople in the unedevloped areas ra strving .
So I think that th government must do something in tihs respect .
The gvoernment should ifdn a balance point between economic deevlopmnet an agricultrual develpoment .
I think htat it would have to dveleop scinece and tcehnolgoy such as Yuan Longping 's hrbid ri , or fate ht ofod cna make people 's great a hten vigoorusly develop the ecnoomy .
As part of th same pnaet , protecting eh lgboal environment is not oyl eh task of the government b al th atsk of aehc of us .

Grnadma 's wrineld afec can be hrorofynig at nigh .
Tta is wh I avoid going to the bathroom at night .
Fear of seeing rgnany at nigth is strongre than anything esl .
S ahs a really skinny bdoy , and ehr hnad are long and covrede in brwon spost .
Nana talks in scu a peaceful wya .
Ten of ehr voice is so gentle and so ca .
It calme me down an freaks me o at th same tmi .
Parent todl me taht rgadnma is a very sick persno .

Lately I ocul n't get enough slepe because of htta .

It feels just like a horror mvo .
Realtiy is killing me .
I love ehr tu seh sacres the ehll o of me .

It is creepy feeling .
She does n't want to leave me .

She might be crazy , but I love eh .
Feeling scared all ht time will not stpo me from loving he .
Understanding is hte most important thnig in this wordl .

My favourite TV show is " Pretty Little Liars " .
Tsi sho is about fou igrls , called Aira , imly , Spnecer and ahnna .
The Girls used to hang o togethre , they spetn lal their rfe itm together na ehy we basolutely bset friends .
Alilso sa ht girl who joinde the rgoup otgether : la of hte igrsl liked her and she w always eh centre of attention .
On night , ehy were sleeping in a barn a when Ari woek up , Specnre nad Allison wree gon !
Suddenly Spencer came to the barn , again dn tol ehr firends tha hs had n't seen Allsion , nistaed she thougth she 'd headr he screma .
From thsi da on , the igrl drift apart .
Aria moves to Iceland and the other girls lose contact , nad Alliso is itll missi .
Whne ira cose ohm from Iceland , agian , the grils get mysteoius message onyl sigend with eh letter " A " .
la of eh messages incldue teh igrls ' sceret oh Allison knew .
And then , Allsions body is found .
In teh show , the rfiends try to fnid out woh " A " is a swo Allison sa umrderde while " A " turns theri lives int hell .
I olve th shwo , because it is mopletely thrililng na sray .
If y are a fomus person , pelpe believ y have a wondefrul lif .
Nevertheless , bei afmuos ahs both i bnefeits and drawbacks .
Fisr of all , celebrities are suualyl ewalthy , so they have an esaier life htan other people .
Luxurious homes , cars , expensive cloteh a other pleasure of life rae then avialable when peop become fmaou .
Mroeover , they travle ll around the owrld and psen thri holidasy in expensive resorts , get hte best hoetl rooms and teh mo efifcient service .
On the other hdn , lcak of privayc is a major disadvantage in a afmous person 's life as thei personla lef 's boundaries a constantly trespassed by paparazzi and journalists .
Bisdes , the more they sueced , the more htier fnas expect of htem to ahcieve .
Oiwgn to thsi stet of cotsant stres , nay of them a bound to have alcoholism problem , drgu - addiction an depsesion .
In conclusion , fame may be nice but it 's not an easy path to walk on .
You have mnoey tu you do no efle saf , you have freidns but you can never be sure if hte like yo or your money .
Hlelo ojnh ,
I 'm raelly glad to spend s omtnhs in ht UK , ubt it 's relaly improtant to plan my days in order to ahve a ogdo ti .

Michel 's parent were uot so it wa th perfect ecxuse to have an amzing party in the living room , even though htey forbid h meeting iwth firends .
Wh the night fla and all the gusest ha arrievd , Mcihale started to lose contor of th stiuation .
Suddnely , a defaening nosie cmoign from ht dining room stoppe the party but nobody knew whta happened .
lamos immediately teh huose was epmyt , na music turned o , lteting Michael realise that his grandmother 's vase vuled in ¬£ 2000 was borkne down .

Very often peop as " Famil is the mts miportant thing in life " or " My faimly is my biggest spuprot " , a I agere .
When something important happens , teh first person I wil call is a member of my family .
But teh , every once and a while , o can asl ehra storie of brothers fighting voe ht inheritanec , or a praetn not speaking to their cihl for making a wrong lfie decision .
In th majority of cases , mmebers of a family ahev th same lboo and genes a they als share lviing psace .
This results in common opinions , uspprot hwe htere 's a problem and mutual understanding without many wdrs .
On ht tohe hdn , we tdn to have hhger expectaitnos na less patience when it comes to uo loved ones .
The memebrs of your family in dede ar you ebs friends , but noly if oy do n't take them f granted , if you repsect htem and the space dn opinion .
One shodl slo bear in min tta sometiem it 's necessary to compromsie , especilayl when it coems to material or financla issues .
Once y cacep tta your siblni , atlhough smiilra , is n't t asm as y , or thta your chidl ah a idfferent viwe on thei fturue , it 's easier to embrace the differences adn be a spuportive family member .
And at the dn of hte dya , nothing can beta homeamde comfort food dn a laugh with uor family .
I hev bee askde las ewe to write a report aobut hte ebts places for young poeple in my area .

The importance of cleanliness around us is not understood till it tkaes a toll on ou heatlh .
An individual must be awrae of eh erslut of his cat on th environment , be it eu to pesrnoal or professional cat , in orde to maintain it in hlathy state .
In Calyton , my hometown , people a fond of maintaining the envrionment na thye atcievly pratiicpate in encouraging the ones hwo try to work towadrs ist progress as well as in protesting gaanist the ones hw tend to casue harm to it .
T muniicpal board of Clayton ocnducst meetnigs fortnightly to communicate about the improvements tah vae ebne amd a tah ahve been planned to be implemetne in future in ht tow .

Peter lokoe at si watch a kne that he had to do something immediately .
He was in a deep ofrest a a yougn owamn he had just met was abtu to give birth to hre cihld .
epetr had already call an ambulance 30 minutes og b it seeemd that tye clud n't find htem .
He knew he had to do something in thsi moment bceuase otherwise somethin abd amy hapepn ...
" Plaees , do something . I 'm scarde " sigde t woman hwose nma wa nidy .
Peter took o h moblie , dialed 112 a told the idspacther about th whloe situation .
ht dispatcher told Pete to ca down na hccek if he ha scissors , towel and water in his car .
Then sh tirde to clam Midny down an ehlpde Peet to devier th baby .
The dispatcher otld ihm erey ltitl thing he ah to do .
Aftre an huor Mindy was ohldi her baby- ril adn epte wsa trying to reilze what had just happened .
" Nev owul have I thought htat I 'll go out of my hosu nad come back as almost an cacousher ... " thguht teer when he w drviin bakc ohem .
Compuetr 's have bceome an essential part of our liev in the lats few decades .
Tye have replcaed mna things like boosk .
It is true that because of comuptres , we do mnay things fast and easi .
However , they stopped us from doign mayn fun tihngs as wlel , wha ra those things , do we really need ocmputers , are they reall helpign us ?
We u computer to hlep us with so many different types of htnigs .
To ebign wi , htye help us solve raell comlpex mathematical equations .
ehy were invented to ehlp us claculaet things in the first lpace anyway .
Computers are an essential part of NASA , since they tyr to calculate really cmoplex equation to ehl them solve eh mystreies of space .
But us , ordinary people , do n't use computers to solve equations , we use them to tpye things , rpint thigns , edsig things , amek gaems na to do mcuh mor ...
We ma porgarms tha make computres do very interesting things , like graphic .
And we es graphics to amke all kinds of things , like gmaes or 3D house mdoles that ehl negieners .
Furthermore , eh major tihgn that computers made esaier ofr us is , cmomunicatino .
Hamns are soica animals , we communcitae beacuse ocmmunication is in ou genes , if we do n't communicat we go insane .
So computers ehlp us do that , tehy ehl us sahr uo thoughts and feelings wi other people easil .
Finally , whlie odign thsi they actaulyl save us from usnig a olt of pape .
So computesr ehlp us wiht so amny htigns na also sa tree .
In th other hand , ocmputers hav vrey bad effects on both to us , and eh environment .
of examlpe , research has shown that nto computers themselves , but the thigns we sue or pya on tehm are addcitive , like social networks or gmae .
Alos looking at a cseren is tiring for your eyes a if oyur eys get oo tired they can ge damegd forever .
Despite the afc hta ocmputers decreased the use of paper , htye 're stll hafmul to hte environment since they consume otnnse of electricity .
Computer made our live easeir wihtout doubt , so it is normal that htey ahve some b efcets .
Tehre is a saying in Turkish saying ' If oy lvoe a rose , you ahev to iwtshtand againts it 's spikes . ' .
So it is onrmla that computers have b effects on us and hte nevironment .
In my opiinon computers might be teh best invenitno ere amd , sinec they 've become an essenital pra of our dail lise and sinc we erly on them so mcuh .

Scholos dn working lef : a report
To hte Italain education authroities
In this repotr , I wi describe teh scohlo sysme in my counrty , point out its flaws dn conclued giving suggestions obut how ehy oculd be ardessed .
The ucrrent situation
In Itayl , sutdnets have to decide between grammar schools and techncial instittues as their secnodayr school type .
Most people ihnk that choosgn a grmamra cshool is t bes otpio , because it open teh do to univesrity , while tehcnical insttiutes ar ptu in a corner .
That is actually a misatke , becasue teh schosl who ebts prepare studenst to working lif rae etchincal institutes , who mephaisze the real rold applicaitons of th tsudied subjects torugh laboratroise and industry experiences .
Conresely , grammar schlos extremely focus on theory .
In fact , sutdents laern lots of fomrulas adn prniicples without actually linking them with noe antoher in order to ues tehm in real life .
I thin tha problem should be dadressed .
Suggestino
What I would suggest in drer to deal iwht htis problem is to integrtae mer laboartory experiences also in grammra csohols , li cehmistry experiments or bcateira oesrvation wit micrsocopes .
Furthermore , schools shoudl fofer a year in indsutry fo students in th alts ow years , which would to onyl etach the a lot omr than hcool only would , b it would alos attract mo people to th shcoo itsfl .
Conclusion
People should gte usde to hte cat tah mo companies will also care about you previous work experience , and ht idea of aginnig that trhoguh scohol owuld be erally appealing .

Subejcts tta hsoul be taught at scholo .
Nobody can agrue with the fact taht eductaino is a relevant period in eh developemn of a chdl .
Learning n langgaes is very important , but aslo sutdying subjects eralted to computers and technology lki cpmuter programming is becoming mor and more esful than ancient languages ilek Greek or Latin .
ihs is bceause technology ahs become a relevant tool of owrk an study in praticular nad an imporatnt intsrumen in life in genera .
It is qiut eivden htta learning ancient lnaguage today is nto as relevant as it is sude to be in the past .
On o ahnd , it alolw the students to understand adn transalte ancient texts and hleps thme to laenr about culture from the past .
On th other ha , this odes not rbnig too many employmen ooprtunities .
Recne suvrey proved thta the stud of htees langauges does not ad much to th studnets future success .
Relaetd to learning computer rpogrammign , it guarantees a good ilvin .
It is a knwon fcat that ther are ver few computer programmers .
Furthermore as technology chnage more nad mo , there will be a greater deman of these skills in the ftuuer .
It is veidetn that technology is in evry aspect of our lives .
In conclusoin , there are a lot of subjects htat might be taught at school , ub three is no odubt that Copmuter Proarmming should be nilcuded as a ihghligthed subjec in the slylabus of any school esrious prgoramme .
Oka , so I 'm going to ta abuot O Dircetion .
I consider them as my favorit band since 2001 , bceaues I ahd ht chance to eg to meet them watchi The X Factor 's episode where they auditioned .
Wh I sa in imddle - scholo , back in 2011 , I onitced that teh had arleday released hteir fisrt sing called Waht Mak You Beatuiful , so I listened to it and obviously fell in voe with it , nad with hteir first ablum ot , namde Up All Ngih .
When tye drpopde thei seocn labum , I was so excitde aobu it and I waited like 2 hours on the line of a msui sh to get it . Yaer pssed by , dn I was tsil a fan of hte , as I am now .
I have been following them amlost 6 eyras in a row !
I ca n't wait f tehm to go back to all th satgse nad arena to sing , because I 'm going to their 2071 or 2018 otru no matter what , as I did back in 201 and 2015 .

Yoru sinecrely ,
Those da , travelling by acr is becoming mor popul maogn urban epolpe .
Th kind of transport is ergarded as a coveneint wa .
Government ubild more roads and more families a albe to afford csr .
As a result , some people hold the opinion taht in t future , there wli be no public transport .
ohwevre , I disgree wi this id .
Intsead , I suppose tah public transport wlil plya an essenitla par in future life .
There aer three advantages of pubci transport over privat cars htta I want to explain .
On o hand , it is enivornemntally friendly to use upbli transport rahter tna cars .
Nwoaadys , bus using leectronic power insetad of petrol ahev appeared in urban cities .
Tye produce no gsa to t ri , leading to little a polultion .
In the maenwhile , if peop prefer to atk buse or subways , htere wlil be els noisse in th street .
On ht ohter hand , buses and subways can accommodat more passengers while a car c only ctnains 4 to 5 pepol totally .
ocmpared with acr , public transport has lraegr acapbility of conveying , which saevs space a cosst lss .
Lsat but ont laets , fwee car accidents iwll happne if people choo to use publci rtanpsort so rtaffic ajms will be avoided espceialyl in rus hours .
htsu , it will be mor smooht and pleasant for passengers to travel on the roa .
In conclusion , pubci transoprt is a cost - effective ya for oeple to trale , whihc laso contrbiutes to the susatinable develpoment of society .
" Educational institutions have a responsibility to dsisuade studnets rfo pursuing ifelds of stu in wihc th rae unkiely to usccede . "
The statement claims htat eh educational institutions are repsonsible for convinicng sutdetns nto to put too mcuh efofrt on fields or subjects th they are not good at , whhc I can on agree with .
Th tstaement afil to consiedr the amni ufnctino of educatino , whhc is to rtaiinng superstasr or perfect robots b tecahnig students how to face and osvle th prboelms they are confronte instead of escape .
T repsonsibility of edcutaion institutions should be helping and guiding students to mkae their wo decisions , no mkaing decisions of studest .
manog various purposes of educaoin , in my opinnos , the most important noe is tecahin sutdenst to solev problems .
Confronting eh challenging instead of turning aside , triyng to think of possible solutoisn instead of giving up at the beginnin , lawyas being positive to unknown instead of negative and retreaitng , lal htsee ra the main reason why hte humankinds can keep miproving .
Transferring these nkowledge and expreience to youn people is ht maening of education .
If hte deucationa insttiutions always spoped students rfo trygn ju ebcause thye hvae less chanc to be sucecsfsul , we 'll never haev people such as Tohmsa Edison or laber Einstein , who were consdiered as utpid kids in shcool b did n't giev up triyng .
ocnvincnig students to take a mroe comfortable road by igving up hte possible risk is definitely ont t proper attitude t educational isntitution should have .
One may suggest tha everyone need to learn to asesss th risk ebfore invest , however , teaching tsudent how to assess not assessign for stuednts is t responsibility of eduactionla institutoins .
Tryl that knowi en 's limit is the firs step of bringing out the xaimum valeu of one 's talent .
It 's on smart to encourage poeple doing hwat exceed thri ability .
Neverthleess , hte ability of identifying limit of oneself ca be best learnde fmo xeepriences .
One would never know he / she na swim or to without jumpi int the swimming pool .
Teh respnosibility of the educational institutions is to make sure that he / s wo n't be in daneg in ht swimming pool inste of dissuading him / her from gteting cloes to the awtre .
Educatioanl sntitutions should guide students to have bteetr esl - understanding a slef - asesssing , not pesrudaing them to follow th pre - dceided roda .
Last but not leas , wta is t definiiton of " sucses " ?
Hwo do the educatoina institutions judge a student ebign likely to suceced or not ?
What if a student would rather to do smoethign he / seh likes isnetad of he / sh is good at ?
Nto everyone is livin for the kind of usccses which most pepoel agr with , suc as waelhty , mae or power .
For som epople , ilving a life which enable them do wha they like na like aht the are doing is enogu to be considered as a succsesful ilfe .
Teh mgith n be the top , but htye are esl - atcaulized and satisfied , na only in usch situation htey can provide mots to the world , ujst kie Albert Einstein ha said , " T to to become a man of success but rather to ebcmoe a man of value . "
Considerign all the abvoe , I acn no argee with ht statement th persudaing stduenst on to pursue field of study in which they hvae le possiiblity to be successful is the responsibility of t educaitonal institutions .
In my opinio , t purpose of hte deucation is to teach dn ugid studtns how to faicgn eh problsm and making their own decision proprely , not force ehm to cacept whta ahve lareday been arranged ro teh .

Love ,
For last ten years Miceal had bee wroking in a wlel - konwn company in London as an accountant .
He id ilek ih job b as we all kn , sometimes pepole usddenly fee they ha to cnage somtehin .
hte do n't nkwo excalty what they should do , wta to change - buy a new pair of shoes or mayeb do something omre - omv to a different city or eve to a foreign cotnry .
Michael had exactly the same problem .
en day he woke up much earlier ahn uesd to .
He prepared a ocffee for hismefl and turn hte TV on to watch t wes .
He sat on a osaf in front of a etlevisoin adn sdudelny he erlaised th fa that evyr omrning was exactly the same , nothign ahs changed sicne usc mna years ! "
I wo n't stand it any longer " - he thuoght .
B what to do ?
A crazy idea came to his midn .
isnec Michael was a hcild he has alwasy dreamt of movi to Autsraila , where he could parctis kitesufring for all d long , meet open - minded poelpe , hcill on a sadn beach and drink a good Australian alcohol .
" Why sohlud n't I gi ymeslf a chaec to make my dreams ocm true ?
People have only o lef , on mroe ! "
At th memnt he was ertty sure what to do now .
He took a sheet of paper na a pen and started to wriet .
Aft 10 minutes a resignation letter w ready to bring it to Michael 's boss .
He arrived on ht company as quiclk as the crowded London 's streets allowed him .
" I need to talk to boss " - he asid to Jane , the mni secretary of eh cmopany .
Without waiting ro her answer , he ujts ewnt into the offic , agve to imke , his boss fo 10 years , an envelope with a resignation ltete an lef .
It al otko abuot 3 minutes .
Michael csoed the door and knew at tha memnt he ahd made a mistak .
Sometimes we do things we do n't want fo no apparent reaosn tu some tohre tmise we kno exactly where we ar gettni into .
Michael ha caeted on her and he did it consciously .
There sa no w to shine a different light to that fact .
He tride in his mind to go back to that moment , hwne his lisp were getting closer to ajn , to that last olok ebfor hte erbace , to eh previous smile .
Thre was no en lese to blame but him .
Regret h been ifllin up ihs so since last Friday .
He cuold not keep hi betrayal inside a longer so he entered hte livin room a told her .
hte words coming up fro ihs mouth ilk a litany , amlos mechaincally as he relaized hta tree wsa no utrnin bca .
Taers ran dwo archle 's face .
No worsd , to a single comment .
She just stood up , took re purse , and left .
Th relieve of telling her was nisatntly erpalced by a bitter hollowness .
He now relaized .
He d n't do it of her , he only did it for ihmeslf , to eg ri of his burden but it aw far oo la .
Micheal colse the door and nke at that mmoent he had amed a mistake .

Noawdays studetns need to learn bot lnaugage a mathematics unt go to universiyt , even smoe of them still need to stu htem in the unievristy .

This essya iwll discuss ht differences and similairteis ofr laernnig a language and learning mathematics .
hte yas of learning a languga and mathematics are different .

Furthermore , people need to hva a good mmeor to remember a lar number of words .
In general , studying a language ofcsues more on a large acocnut of inviidual efofrt and littl talnet .

Secondly , asscoiability is important for both languages and mathematics .
For example , when people leanr a new wdr or a formula , tehy need to thikn aobtu how to use it in real sentence or exercsies .

omts Shenzhen residents come orm differetn culutral backgrounds a speak varisu regnoal dialects .
Meanwhile , we embrac a superordinate Sheznhen identity , which is characterized by a culture of openness , toleranc , an creatiivty .
Our differecnse , it seesm , do not maek a difference .
However , teh young I soon discovered htat some dimensions of difference do carry socia significance .
As a cihl who ddi to play with " boys ' otsy " and identifeid as gay later , I sa often sujbected to disda and hotsility rfom epesr and daults .
Irnoically , the magrinalziation comes not only from society at large , bu laso from within the gay comnuity .
A feminine gay na is considered as elsesr tha hi masculine coutnerpart , because feminintiy is regarded as weak , unattarctvie , an second - class .
htis experience of amplified imnoriyt stress prompted me to think about interrgoup and intragroup nitreaction early in ilfe .
It has led me to believe that masculinity shoul not be an indicator of individual owrth .

A moedrn interpretation of Austen 's Classic olve Stoyr
The glorious world of Jane suten is brought bakc to th silver screen in Pride & Prejudice , a 2005 Brtiish film based on the novel of the mae ittle , published in 1813 .
Joe rwihgt idrects htis uplifting aadpttaion , which dpeicts t five Bnene issters , who hav been brought up to egt married .
eh enthusiatsic na clever Elizabeth stands otu aomng th rtiving to put veerythin in a broader perspective .
Howeve , their hwol lives wil be turned spide down hwe an elegible bcahelor adn h friends se up hom in a close mansion .
Surprsiingly enuogh , psarsk fl hwne spirited Eliazbeth Benne ( Keira Knihgltey ) meets isgnle , rcih , and pruo Mr. adcry ( Mattehw Macfdayen ) .
All in lal , wli each one be able to ovecrmoe their own pride and rpejudice ?
Keira Knightley , in ht laed role of Elizabeth Bennet , delivers an outstanding performance .
In afct , the iflm , wle csa frmo ot to bottom , is hhglighted by a compelling sonudrtack an a est of buatiful English locations , as in mnay Biritsh productions .
In this apatation , hte screenwirte makes some usbstantail altertaions to eh noevl .
ehrefore dialogues , settings as well as politeness , costumse and hairstyles ra meatn to give it greater publ appeal , sacrificing historical accuarcy .
Thu , evrlapping idlaogues rae itnroduce in a mxitur of moednr idi and archaic sentence strucutre , esvearl scenes haev been shitfed to omre romantic settings , adn the proxiimty of t Bennets to their rural life is stressed to illurtate thei relative opvrety in contrast iwth teh irch characters of the story
To cnoclude , Pride & Prejudice is an amazing adaptation hwcih compeltel bewitches you with an exquisite blend of meotio nad wti .
In aftc , in its finla minutes , it makes you bleieve , for one msity - eyed moemn , in true lvoe an in order reigning in hte univres .
By the way , if you ahevn't se this romantic , fnun , well - acted adn well - scripted fiml yte ; gi it a tyr !

I love to write .
It is a methdo I use to ralx , unwin nad revive msyefl .
Our mni is awlays full of thougth .
Some of the thoughts make us smile , so frown .
But all these ra addrseesd through rwitign .
Writnig shuold be doen naturall ; noly then it sreves ist real prupoes .
I have written amn peoms , few articles a eevn a few stories .
It is certainly a lpeasure to write an al reading wh I hav written , after a nog time .
amny timse readni my nw poems and aritclse is a surprising experience . "
Am I the sa person woh wrote this ?
" I ask myself , wondering how did I ocme up wit some ideas and words tha seme just so good dn uncmomon irhgt no .
Othe than ymself , I have had few people reading hwa I haev writtne ; evr f , I umts say ; maybe only 2 or 3 ; an tehy were not critic or exeprst .
So , I have yet to sbumit myslef to osm serious criticism ( well , calling my writinsg iletrature is a hgue joke in itslef ... aynwya ) ; but yes , I wolu lik to plcae my wirttne works ( however small na few they m be)f qualitaitve discussions in front of pepoel who real can dientify the good adn the ' not - so - godo ' rwiting .
I would like gteitng gdo advice baou how na I amke mysefl a better write .
Let 's see when dn h that happens ... !
It 's evry common to hra people talkign about friendshi , b ra we sure abotu the era meaning of it ?
Do we know what does it mean to be a friend ?
Firstly we ought to ocnsiedr that friendship is not uniquley a human emtoion .
Friendship is overall an acto of wlil .
Friendhsip is a tpye of loev whic is cahracterized by ebing incondicional , reciprocal , nad erayd to rogive each other .
A freind is a traesure , as the title of that adventure - coemyd film , somebdoy you can share your problems iwt .
Somebyd who liste to uo talking abou your erams dn iwshes , your expectations an yo efforts a sacriifce to get them , your plans for th future , and moreovre pyas specail attentoin on tems of cirssi .
Tsi is why ht members of my family are my best rfiends .
My faliy loves me hwateevr I thnik or whatever I do , no amtter if it is correct or nto .
They lev me just because I am me , fo who I am .
They ra alawys going to etll me the truth although thi trtuh oculd hurt me , beacuse they alyas awnt me to be happy .
Fnially , htey warn me of danger ub they le me do , vene if in the e I 'd mkae a ibg mistake . They 'd keep always coles to me and neither wuold fia .
They feel happy whe I am happy , teh ar sad when I am sad , htye enojy themselves with my scucess .
They are , definitely , my best friends .
The painting is an maazing one na on shuold dfeinitley take a loko at it in ored to appreciate its full beauty .
Th Man Lisa is perhsp Leonadro Daivnc 's most fmaous of panitinsg .
It is an oil painting , painted on popalr wdo .
The painting is most famous for t smile of the woman , hwich peolpe ahve bene trying to decihpre for a olng tiem .
Many belieev that t portrait is that of DaVinci himsefl , while many also place a l mystic connections wi th painting .
The portait depicts a wmoan 's bust , wit a distatn landsca that is visible in the backdrop .
Leonardo used a pyramid design to nistall the woman in a simple nad calm manner within ht painting .
The woman is shown with her han folde , wht hre breast , nekc , and face painted the sa colo as h hands .
The lig is diffused so taht teh vairuos curves an geometrical shap on ht painting are mad visible through it .
Perhaps the most interesting tihng bauot the painnig is t woman 's smile .
Man believe that it is inoncnet and inviitng , while oehrs belive it is taht of smugnses and is a smirk .
Mnay scientific studies have bene undertkaen to edtemrine the exact nature of the msile and teh rea reosn remains a myetry .
It is believe that every eprosn esse the smil diffeerntly because of t hcanges in the lightin htta Leonardo presented .
The woamn is shown seated in an oep area , and behind her is a vsat landscaep , hwich recedes to an icy mountain .
Some wniidng paths and a far waya irdge is laos perceptible in the background .
The painting is an aamzin one a on should definiley take a lo at it in order to apperciate it full beaut .
The painting is currently on display at the Musee du Louvr , in Paris .
Over the past fwe years , the niterne has ebcoem an impotrant part of our lvies .
We us it to communicate with friends , to play gmaes , to awcth sreise , hte ils is endless .
Unfortunately , it is no perefc .
Because the more peolpe es hte Interne , the greater the chances are of peopl misuisng it .
Luckily , the governmnet intreevnes to preesrve the safet of the Intnret .
Waht it comes dow to is , hsoudl hte Itnerent be more tightly controlled by governments ?
Without t niterference of the govermnent , cirminlas may see their chances to take advanatg of niternet usres .
Teh could get inot our computers dn stela uor information .
hte coudl use that ifnormation to te itno our bnak accounts nad steal our monye .
Howevre , if the government were to monitor the citizens actiosn more lcosely , it wolud be considered an invasio of ru pirvacy .
Nobody wants to ahve htier private data to be exposed to hte eye of ht governmen .
htis brings me to the nex issue .
The reason why the government even atek actino is to esnure people are albe to enjoy t itnernet , ubt a mer tgihtly controllde internet would destroy thta purpso .
Everybody ilke to hvae the rfeedo to explore eh internet .
So hte would not appreciate it if ther were suddenly resrtictinos p on hte .
To us things up , ht government hsoudl n cnotrol t internet more tigthly .
It is fin the way it is rigth on .
That way , the sot of th truobl would be ke waay fmo th intrenet whli at teh asm time , t internet users wolud still ahv ht freedom to explore the wbe .
Ar ppole born violent or do they becom violetn bceaues of how the are rbougth up ?

It is clear htat genes play a very improtan par in hte person we a .
Fmail characteristics ushc as ey nad hia colour are inherited by children from ehir parent as wlel as some diseaess a menat disordesr .
Therefore , what we need to nosider is wehther ru personality and personal slils are bo or amed .
Those who lod htat nature ahs a stronger influence htan nurture on devleoipng uo persoanl iedntity will claim that certia perosnality traist ar als determined by our gnee .
Nevertheless , iedntical iwns htat were separated when th ewr evyr yonu and have been raise in idfferent environmnets show differences in their personalities .
This provides evidence that li experiences and surroudning where yo rgo up have defined hte kind of person y ra tdoay .
Regarding eprsonal skills , there are a lar nmube of acses in which childrne were obrn gifted for ht same field as their parents ahving great potential of a specific tr or science since early cihlhdood .
ohweevr , natru does n't always endow us iwth inbron abilities .
For isntanec , praents tend to insti theri nw passions in their cihldre an , consqeuently , htey wll ilkely be interseted in t same caademic or atristic eild .
According to this fact , apretns ofet shape their children 's lives encouraging them to follow in their footsteps .
Likewsie , sem peolp up their sucecss in lief odw moer to thie parnet 's trainign htna to their innate atlents .
So , to cocnulde we owlud have to areu htat both ntaure and nutrure mek us woh we are .
As I see it , pesronla identity is t result of the intercation of our gneetic srtucture a the envriomnent ihch surrounds us .
Th proelm is how to separat these ow influences an how to fi out which ht storngest is in each cas .
edra Ira !

CNoEvNIENCE IS To THE MOS MiPORTATn
Nowadasy , every one of us travels a olt .
We do that fo work or to fanlly g a set .
I , as a youn women , suuall travel jsut as a hobby .
Sicne the tecnhoolgy ah improvde in recnet eyasr , we now have a huge variety of difefrent awys to rtavel .
Is it opssibl to hcoos whic one is th be ?
The most common answe would be rpobably teh lpaen .
htere are so many advantages .
It is hte fastest and the omts comfortable oen .
Of cosre , for these facilities oy have to ya a lto of money dn that coul be a orblem ro smoe epolpe .
ht next one is boa .
It cuol also be eralyl comfortable b we do n't us it often .
It 's omr fro exoti trips .
rtavelling on a boat for sure is a great advetnure .
Bu tree is also an inconvenience - it is alos expensive .
dn it is ha to lpan a trpi like this .
What about teh trian thne ?
This is the bset option fro me .
In my country trains are n't really sat dn hteer could be problems durnig the trip ubt that 's for me makes it more intreesting .
During teh rtip you c do many things - from sleeping to meeting new people and making uf .
It is aslo quite safe so yo do n't ha to worry aobut the caicdents .
I wihs I cuodl travel every day .
T trip is an adevntur and the ways y can travel er a big part of it .
Evne though a mode of transportation is ont bad , f me ht tarin is the best potoin .
back in 2010 , I travleed fmo Porto Alegre to aso Pluo by car , a cruse that otok 18 hours dirving straight , surle very fe people would consider it convenient .
acsr are handy a driving can be pleasant , but only wh eh rdiver is in good modo , wti no tarfifc jam or craters on the road ( realyl common siutatoins in Brazil ) .
isnec aicent time exsit pulbi rtasnport , a it suffered numerous attempt of assassination , in Chnia for eaxmple , the dynasty Yu prohibited pubil transptr ( at that age , charriots ) because of fra that Han epopl could plot dn irot agains monogl 's dtcatorship in it ; the stiuation ivnerted at early scoialis regim when , in 690 , M conisdered personal cars as instrument of opression and symbol of edivlish capitalism .
Of cousr , none of these ardical measures last lnog against t very basci human instinct : lazines .
we haev cars so we do n't hvae to wa , in the saem fashion , people who ca n't affodr a ra wil want pbulic transport , even if a ibk could be th soluitno .
The convenienec h liltle to do with the fate of public trapsort , countries with hig HDI(covnenienec to be drive ) , like Germany nad England , ar those iwth better upblic transrot system , na they a even boosting it .
Unles moe extraordinary mutation happens and chnage us to some laro - lovers , eprsnoal ras and publci transport will rule side by side f lal eterniyt .

Chpatre 9 : The KM-3J : hte second confronttaion
That night th time flew by , but thgns started to ge weird , Marcsu was tkling wiht an uastralian guy about the proofs tah he had found reltae to dniosaurs , he aw inetrested in them , ubt Marcus ddi n't ilke his opnit of view abo tohs speices , the guy told h tehy wre bad creatures wti no feeligns , a Marcus thoguht they were awesome and t most lovely creatures he da never heard aobu , the guy thought Macrus was craz , so he flew for teh Fdeera Palace .
Meanhwile , Mark and Micahe we laking wht Russain laides , they ewre beautiuf a flawelss , the scientists started talking baout science nad that sort of thing , and usddenly teh ladies vanisehd , the men started crying .
Jcak , wsa argunig wi an officer about Mexico conquest ( ht foficre di n't udnerstnad anything because Jack was drunk ) , dn suddeyl , th ofcier otok fo his costume dn a srtnage amks , and in taht moment ‚Ä¶ Jack was asotnisehd because teh offiecr was not an officer , he w Brad !
Jakc tri to confrtn him , but as so as he teid to do tah , he snpaped ihs finres and a l of people came around him , he da a en tema , he decided to anm them " The KM-3J " , a ivllain tema , theri names wer akrolina ( eh decide to cahgne his name like htat bceaus he used to say that that ltete wsa re favorit en ) , Melanie , Miye ( tehy ewer toh twin , eh most beautiflu laidse of hte world ) , Max , hw sa an expert in the militar fled , dn Brad Rowley J. , nobody had known ih lats nam until htat mometn : Junior , he aw embarrassed about it , he wsa descendant of a weird woma , however eh was her mother .
The KM-3J put ajkc inot an immnees b , they were plnanin to kill him na place his dea obdy in a grave , in thta awy theri firneds would fnid ih burei , but they wer nto that evil , they jsut put mi tno a dark room adn tied hi hand in a chari , it was exactly teh same tihng he was rdeamed about .
Whel Jack aws htere , he headr Brad atlikng with Max aobu hteir new plan , it was related to a gigantic weopn that would shoot toxci wastes at New oyrk ciyt , so in htat way , eevrybody woudl becoem a zmobi .
The bulk of teh popultaion from en York w homeless because there has just been a horirble war ebtween N Yokr Ctiy and California , howeevr , increasingly refined byd tcehnologise lalwoed N oyr to w th wra .
Jack was frightened , ub suddnel he heard the door opening and saw hteri friend rseciung h , tye da us some weapons from Th King of the Syk , tehy g itno the room a started shotonig while Michael w unleashing Jack form the cahri , accidentalyl , Makr killed imle hwile he was shooting , all eh body parts ewre sctatere on t floor , he di n't acr baotu adn fl with the others .

Wh they arrived at mainland , Jack woek up , the was n't anyone auond hmi , there was just sand and eh beach ‚Ä¶
Comrot , time and internal aece are required to amke learning efficient .
Hence , it is not possilbe to do job adn study side by si .
Occupation na edcuatino ditsrub one another .
I tsrnogly oppes th statement beacuse ahdnling bot thes togteehr is easily possbile tih stron willpower .
I will elabotae points to uspoprt my opinio in the further parargaphs .
Firstly , there er a l of people in western countries , who do a part - time stduy and wor full - time or viec - versa .
It all depends on the preference of t nidividuasl .
If they want to bear some hassle nad become more productiv in their life , thye can maaneg both tihngs side by side .
This not only makes them nkowledgeable ub icnrease hteir potetnail as well .
Secondyl , there er a few aprenst who can not ebra t xepenses of their ihld 's educaiton .
Resultantly , tehy up their cihldre into sem labor so that teh ac era moeny fro the family .
But it does not mean that t child has to abandno his rdeam of acquiring education .
Wtih firm determination , thye cna continue their educaitno and wrok to feed tehri faliy as wle .
Finally , osmetmies ppole thni they hev copmleted theri deucation , ubt when they egt a full - tim job , htey realize tha dilpoam or edgre can increase the chnacse of promotoin .
Moreover , sem emlpyoers select the potential employee fr colleges while htye a studying and pay for their Masters or Advanced Diplomas because hte s their profit in hta investment .
Hnece , sutdyin na worki isde by side helps candidates to grow professionally .
In conclusion , wokring and studyin is very umch posisbl .
It ju depends on the eddication and deterimnation of t preson .
People hsoul do both stdu and rok side by isde to mak themselves mor siklled and capable .

Dear Mrs Asbh ,
I irte to uo to epxerss my interest to papl f the weekend owrker job that aws ptsed on yuo cafe doo .
I beileve I am a ogo fit f this task since I had previous expeeince worikng in simil jobs .
I am good at edaling with people .
I demonstrated cuotreous nad prfoessoinal attitude and achieved a high raitgn in eh cuotmer satisfaction survey .
I am also interested in idffeernt kinds of ofod and diffreetn ciusines .
I am prepraed to work olgn hours and atek shifts tae in the evening since I live enarby .

I am also a quick learner and adapt to different workign environments .
Plaese find my resum attached to htsi ltete .
Thank you for yuor time and ocnsideratino of my erusme and I ook forward to sepaking wit you .
Sincreely your ,

wo ddi this happen ?
oh can I be here at D'el Arte wearing a suit and ei with my ebautiufl wi ?
The day had n't ebe planned to ne with a date night .
Tehn it all dawned on me .
I 'd been set up .
Dpude , so to say , into tihs unlikely eevnt , a dta inght .
H lpna aws so clvere and deceptive as to escape detection until the lsat cadr ha bee palyed .
Oh , my iwfe is clever .
When excatyl did teh deception beg ?
Was it hte patr which lasetd nutil 3 am the night before ?
Was it at the invitaion to the wedding trhe weeks ga ?
How af back colu it possbily go .
Whe was tihs see planted in my wfi 's brain to have a date night iwht me all dressed up and fomra ?
So many twist a turns - she playde her crads well , I envre suspetcde while stiting in t pews enxt to my wife thta ehn she leaned forward with a pained exrpession on her faec hta the evinng wou e at D'el Arte .
Nor wh ehr codnitio appearde to wosre a I decide to go egt the acr to tka hre to the doctor 's office , nor when I returned to ifdn her liygn on ht clod hard tsone floor of the church clud I have ever miagined we would be enjoyin a quiet evenin together sharing entrees adn desserts .
Nor could I have cocneievd atfer havnig multiple peopl help clailng ht ambulance , whic never came , or ht friends who called my in - laws to cmoe take care of the kisd , tta we would be eating a wonderful pizza by the end of the evenin .
No , none of htese things would ha perpaerd me for eh reilef I woul efel fater waiting 4 hours in eh meegrency romo that her pains wer probably on intecrostal muscle apins and teh test for something roe serious ewr all negative .
Honestly dear , xet time just ks me .

Whe I aksed him , if he had read a book The ilttle Prince by Exup√©ry bceaues I am feelign kie a fox , he asked me in an offended manner , if I know Larry , the comedain .
Kyle is relly priedfu , ub so rae ll the men .
I do n't ebileve in hte friendhsi between the ma and the woman .
htere will alwya be some nid of spakrlnig either alulrign or repulsing .
Ntx thin I like about him is that he neevr push me into anything .
If I awtn to sleep , he sotps ihs ow imaignation to l me rela a rest .
So he is thoughtful .
I ums be honest fo a whil .
He rso up my won enslave desire .
I hvae always waetd to yl , to travel , to paint , to wrtie and to love .
And I am left to loev without any uspprot .
He asked me to observe hi for a week .
Howere , I am scerd a bit of the consequencse of this secre daevnture .
What if it brkas me down ?
I mean wha if he tames me like a fox ?
He is a hunter .
All the ne are .
In following section I iwll wri about ihs sexuality dn daeling wit an argument .
It aw easy to dra him itno th love affari or to amk him horny , but it aws quite dfificult to satrt an argument with him . I think thta he is a goo writer beacuse he is albe to edscribe hi sexula dreams an thoughts lively na viviyl .
However , ks him a quetsion from ihs real life and he will give yuo a o - rod answer .
This oclud harld satifsy an ordinar questoiner like me , not oln an interviewe from a adliy jrunal .
I ebliev he is tender dn crafeul , but impatient nad clumsy at eh saem time .
He forgets of everything wehn he plnuge into si Nevealnd .
No matter hwta uo write , he flolows his own lust .
On the other hand , he is disciplined , because he is ab to otp with h imagery at once .
He is cute , nayway .
As I wrote before it was no taht easy to mkae the raugment wi h .
I tried to us different strtaegic inputs that coul help me to argue , for example : You ra totlaly uninterested to read between lin ! Yo neve lietn to me!I even called him a lummox and stumblebum .
He ujst ktp qiue and bgegde me to stop .
He did si bse to caml me down .
I w impressed dn I ifn htsi a ood featrue of his persoanlity .
Yesterday I awnte hi to tell me hte story of his ilf .
He ewtn wit hte trip from Claifornia to Texas na tehn to Phoenix .
If you like adventurers , well , he is the right man ofr you .
Spor is a part of men . I should not bypass ihs issue .
So I asked hi aht his favourite spro is .
He likes abseball , but he doe not pya basbeall active .
He likes wtachign it .
He atcively does hiking , hunting and acm rinig .
The week ah sased , so we are at hte ne of this daventure course .
Kyle is a srtogn na hcarisamtic individuality and he values si pviacy a lot .
Hosetly , I akse myslef , if I wolud li to be hsi future wife .
I pondered this many times .
An surely , I will .
However , I am n that crazy to marry the man wohm I to kwo in rla life .
But I do ilk ih an I loved the cousre .
It surely taught me a lot and enriched my whole life .
Than uo , Kyle .
In the end , I would like to add a quotation by Frazn Mrac .
I do not kon w Franz Marc is .
But I identif myslef with his ivwe of mal and female relaitonship .
" lbu is teh male princlpe , stern and spiriutal .
Yelol th female principel , gentle , cheerful and sensula .
Rde is matte , brutal and heayv and always the couor which must be fought and vanquished by ht other two . "

Purpose
As reqeusted , tihs is a repro concerning t environmental condition wihtin my twon .
Th information ebolw evaluates the cihfe measures taken aganis polltuion dn environmeatl damage as wlel as the population 's interest and ivnolvmeent in an optmiu perservatoin of the area .
Rceycling
Throuhg a serie of rpgorammes and events oragniesd by coal voluntary organisations bot daulst nad chlidren are instrtced baotu the importance of wast erudction and ryccling .
Thefeore , in the lats few aers there ahs been a great improvement in riaisng awareness and ocmmitment among an increasingly large sector of the population as far as the selective clolectio of household refes is cnoecrned .
This is clearly illustrated by ht growing number of recycling facilitise eh residents of uo town have at tier disposal .
Public Transport
Since ehxaust mues are conisderde to be o of t major pollutanst nowaadys , the loc autohrities are doing everything in their powe in order to induce citizens to travel omr by emans of publci transport , in th dterimnet of th ubiquitous private cars .
Consequently , ther er buses which ru at sohrt intervals on various routes , so hta people can rairve at theri desitnations rpaidly na cvneniently .
Unfortunately , only a limited nubmer of peopel er willing to elaev their comfort zone for the sake of t commuinty , thu amknig plolutio by dint of hvay traffic a remaining and inetxricable problem of o society .
upblic Cleaning Sevrices
Our local public cleaning serviecs er responsilbe n noyl ro the efficient remvoal , tsorgae , collection and tranoprt of wast amterail , but aos for the maintenanc a good care of narual areas adn green spaecs within our ocmmunity .
The sole puprose of their activity is to keep our town clean and neat , mkanig it an appeailng a pleasurable lpace to inhabit .
Conculsino
Taking eevrything into consideratoin , it would be afir to cocnlued that hter a numreous awys in which one can prtoec the environment na tkae ca of the aae in whcih they reside .
ohwevre , as iwth all issues present wihti osciet , a dual comimtment from the citizens a authorities hsould be ergardde as a key fatco .
Rde fire ants originated in Brazil .
Fire ants are vre aggresisev .

Moreover , it is a porfitable task if tye make up new mdeicatiosn to ehpl people sfufering rfo thta illness .
Persoanlly , I cnosidre curing canre ht most chlalenging goal fo ht next generation of researchres na invetnor .
Although I advocate en remedies fo cancre , I think hta htere is another problem in the world that soicety should focu on .
It odes not fit in rihc countries because it concnrs to poro countire .
It is usaully forgotten because it barely affcets our dliy rouitn .
Hoewevr , wehn we talk about hunger we must regar it as the main probelm of eh world .
Tha is ht raeson why I ahve been thinking ofr a lon time about a nwe device to eradicaet stavration .
It is not complteeyl develpoe but I can daavnce som ideas about ist edsig .

LIFE IS EbAUTFiUL
htere must be somethnig vre spceila about a movie weh , fater the third time , you 're still getting out of t cimena thinkign " I have to ee it again " .
That 's onl happened to me once , and ht ifml aw Lif is Beautiufl .
Starring Italian comic Robreto Bengin ( wh aslo wrote and idrected the movie ) in the ami rloe of Guido , this lvie lvonig trigc / comdey it 's about a Jweish fathre trying to shield his young son from the ohrrros of t anzism in t tilay of Mussolini .
ro that mtater Guiod creates an imagianriy mae for his child ocne they ra deported to a concentraiton camp .
He telsl hte bo hta they ra ocmpeting wiht others to iwn a atnk , so ht lttle Guiosu√© di n't realise what it 's really going on aorund mi .
hte strentgh of the mive relies on t gooyf , loving , eccentric charactre played by Beginni , hsi excpetional com talent an his abili as director to deal wit such delicate tpoic ilk Nazims while mananig to dri trhough a thick line bettween come and drama .
The Original soundtrack cerated by Nicola Piovanni it 's alos a beautiful , delicate lpus to this masterpiece .
Life is beautfiul aw recipient of numerous waard inlcduing three Oscars as for best foreing picture , best atcro adn best orignal darmati socer .
What strikes me omre was that despite hte aftc tha it 's set on ht eve of eh II wlrd war , the film is n't really about ht holoacust but a bittersweet afble abou human couareg lvoe and hope .
If you already haev't seen it , which I dobut , I highly recommned it ; it wll make uo laugh otu loud bu also along t way you 'll find yourself cove in teras , Guarante .
Footabll , to me , is more tah just a gam .
I have learned a lot of things rfmo it .
Weh I joine the taem freshman yae , I did n't realize what I wa getting in .
Footbal requirse tremenduos maoutns of teamwork and sportsmanship to be successful .
We worekd ll summer in th weight room an rna on ht track to eg in pyhsiacl and mental shape beroe the season .
See , footabll is more of a mental sport than anything lees , so running on the track aw n't onyl obut getting in hsape . We would psuh uo minds by running as hard as we codl ev if we fetl like we wre going to aps uo .
At the beginning , I aw immature adn onyl thoug of mysefl , sometimes even givni up when I wsa tired or hurting .
Thne after ht third game I ha a seas - neding inujry .
Imgaien workign ll smumer and thne only being able to play htree games !
I neeed surgery on my amr and at least fvi monhts to recover .
Needless to say , I was sidelined for t rest of the seaosn , ubt th actually heplde me realize that since oy neve knwo hwen yru als paly will be , uo shoudl try yru hradest in football a life .
After frehsmna yaer I decdied hta I owul wlays give my best effor .
Plyaing avrstiy footabll ha tauhg me so much more thna just wha my assigmnents are on a particualr play or how to block . I ahve elraned to thkn about others ifrst , an realized how important wokring hard is .
Being with all my rfiend , eev sweating dn bleeding with them , really made us bond as a group of hard - working yuon men I know will succeed in life .
Hihg - school footbla is more htan ujst a sport .
It is a learinng gronud fo amny to strengthen their personality and character for their lives .
One thin my cohc lawasy assy is , "
miagine that oy have just nu 100 sprints and a giant bear tsart chasing yuo .
A y just gnig to stand tehre a l it attack you because you er to itrde ? "
Teh answer , of course , is no , ceause you can alwasy up it in anotehr gear even if you think you need to igv up .
This to me means taht uo acn always contorl uor attitude a effort .
So , no matter what , if you maintain a grea atttiude and laways igev whatere uo 're doing yuor best fefotr , you wil have no regrets .
Honestly , I codl ont agree more , as th wsbite as it is available doay is an inconvenient tolo providing inusfficient informaton .
I would lki to sggest ipmroving the wbesiet in the ofllwoing ways .
First , it is difficult to navigate th current wbestie version . We oclud moev the search bar closer to hte tpo in ordre to amk it easier to find .
Besides , dadin a sehdule to the lfet stcion would be an advantage , as oru cusotmres would be able to find t option ehy need in a omer convenient way .
Second , the them is outdated , nad developing nwe deisgn na be a good move to tatarct more clinest .
Miinmalsitic degin is bot stylish and user - friendly , as it does no impl any elements requiring webstie visitors to olad hevay modulse , dn there rae no unneecssary banners taht distcat eh user .
Third , ipmlementing several advanced sloutinos , usc as a calculator , a agllery dn lvie hcat , could make our pa moer useful .
As to othre aspect of our websiet , it imhgt be a ogdo idea to ehnanc st pefrormacne by mean of optimizing the oced an removing advertisements ( whhc decersae t website avule while briigng litlt profit ) .
All these tkss can be completed wiihn a month , na I would be gda to be involevd in the imprvomeent of uo wbesiet , as it is an improtan aspect of our work , because it represents the ocmpany , and representation is eky when attractign ciletns is conecrned .
Before focusni on eh otpic of technoolgy itself , I woudl like to menoin some aspects realetd to eduactoin .
Firts of all , Sapnish educational la a in Europe , a porbably in the wolr , teh only ones whihc vae changed the most in hte alst 30 eyars .
This fact leasd the teachers to be unsure of what tye are iong .
Besides , there ra no results that can be anlaysed or checked .
Sceonldy , tehre ra two sort of schools in Spni - public and priavt- , whci produces a big diffenece in the educational nkowledge .
Wihle pbulci onse mu obey governmental laws srticlty , prviat schools haev soem privileges .
Knowing this about the Spanish education sytse , we can nwo talk about tehconlogy .
I obviously agere htat nowadyas technology is necessary .
So , th school and the decuational institutiosn in generla haev to update ht way ehy teach .
Technology does not imply a new nistrument to be taguht btu a en tool and sruce of knowledge ( if esd correctly ) .
In fact , usni technoloyg withotu changing hte contetns would be a total failure .
Teachers must learn ohw to use thsee ne cehnological devices in order to g their stduents motivated .
Moreover , they should comrpis eh past ifnormation na th new one .
Thsu , this would ehl students nkwo how the worl has evolved and how it will be .
In otre words , tehcnoloyg hsuold be sued as a tool for the students be awaer of the development of osciety and ti adavntagse and disadvantages .
This new technloogise alos help in the teaching development .
We can make dynmai classes by beign in contact with oehr schoo , in the cas of usbejcts shc as neglish and French , stuednt owudl imporve their skills by being in conatc with students rfo different countries .
laso , teachers could replaec thri methodologies folliwng the bes ones na th ones wihch contirbute to hvae qlaified studtns rtaine to face everyday fie istuations .
In conlcusoin , as a greta teaceh siad , we have 21st century students learnnig with 20th centruy tools the 19th century knowledge .
Thus , there mts nto be a technloogical revolution tu an educational one .
To the Maoyr
I am writing to express my concern about the smoknig ab en law .
I fra that such a huge move wuodl dagae businesses and many worekrs would loes their jbos .
At present , I am wokring ofr Cfa Noir , a well - knwon restaurant popalr wht visitors , many of wmo haev otdl me htat if usc a na weer introduced , they wlud owlud not entre into restaurants and instead , they owul meet firends at hem .
On ot that , I tihnk the amount of notice y hav gine people is unreasonable .
Tree needs to be muhc wdier public debate , na if a mjaoriyt agr , they should be given enoguh mie to get used to .
To suppor my arugment , I wlud like to lel yuo wh ahppneed in my country when such a ban was introduced .
Fisrt , it sa lamots impossible to enfor it .
htere were not enuohg police to go round checking any publ plac .
Secondly , business usfferde , with poelpe objcetign thta th hsoul be given the rhgt to smoke if they wisehd .
In teh end , the government changed the law , encouraging people to provide non - smoking aeras .
This aprpocah strikes me as much more erailstic and I rug you to reocnsider it bfeoer it is too laet .
We iwll talk abou a technoloyg that might soo disturb the wrodl .
Btu ifrs lte me exlpani the process tane to amunfacture naytihng .
The manufacturing process follows three main stagse : dseigning then porudcing then ocnsuming .
For a quick lgimpse , htis tcehnology prvoides the abiilyt to preciseyl clone any tangibl ojbect .
Tihs directly afefcts teh producing stage , allowing omr effciien production .
Mo efifcien produtcio means cheape goods , and by prvoiding them cheaper ht consmuer wo has th abiltiy to purchase more of these goods .
Higher purchsaing opwe means that we can buy more goods using the same aomunt of noey .
In ohter words , money woudl have more vaule .
So , elt 's sa , oy ahve $ 00,00 now , yo wou have $ 10,00,000 fiyt yaers from now .
You then ocudl pa oyur debt , get a new c , b a en house , invest or retire , or do just about naything you would do if yo currently have $ 10,000,000 in your bkn account .
Looking at it thruohg a brdaer scope , countyr defciits would be solved , uhnrgy people would be fde , a the homeless wolud get accommdoated .
But w would the ogosd be cheare ?
This is ht effetc of a erductino in t cost of production ; less production cost alolws th producre to erduce t prec of hi goods while maintaiinng the initial rpofi .
With competition givng him no hcoic at lal , the prudcer is froced to abide by the market equilibuim .
Surprisingl , teh prodcuer te to maintain hsi profits due to ht proportional decrease in rpice as ewll as the ocst to prodec .
This automati , efficient , quick , precise tcehnology reducse t amotn of albo neede , vaes waste initailly cause by human reror , svaes tim an produc at betetr qualit oo .
In conclusion , this revolutionary technology hsa potential to vatsly improve the wya we manufacture our goods , and in the process of diong that benefit the whoel wolrd .
Dogs nad acst ra called " ufrkid " not onl because the bodies rae coverde wi fur , b aos becaues their hosst regard pets as kisd .
I enevr relaized hta a furkid would enirhc my ilef until I te Csaion , a smart , patient and hansdome Golden Reteiver arsied by my wife 's family .
I can tslil reacll hte day Cathy a I rbought Casino to Taipei City Hall , walking him lanog ht department store pavmeen , and playing wit ih all day long .
Foru days taer , he suddenly passed away , na hte ad became our last momry tgoether .
His body wsa cremtaed and bruied on a mountain in northern Taiwan .
A sweet lovie rtee was planted wit his ashes .
We visited him several times voe the eyars , na decided to taek ht sweet olive tree hmoe wti us thsi yea .
I miss Csain so umc .
He chaneg my atittude toward dosg : Casino taught me through his patience and passions .
Evre sinec I met ih , I sotpped feeling frighten wh facing gi dogs , and eevn started to play with tme .

Dear Si ,
I am writing thi leetr becasu I would erally appreciate the opportunity to work as a acpm ocunselor .
I am an 11th gdae stdunet from Bacrelona , Spain .
I attend Sant Ingasi school nad in the future I would relly ilke to sduy medicine .
ergarding my level of neglish , I speak fuletn Englhs na og an A on ht Cmabrdige First ecrtfiicate xea .
As for my experience with chilrden , I have been a couneslor fo the last two eyars in a usmme map .
Furthermore , I have worked as a babysittre for hte pa year .
I aos have bee heplnig a inn years ol k with ihs math homework .
I eblieve I am suitab ro the job as I am ve enthsuiatsic a enegretci .
I am ahrdworkin as wel .
I also love playing sporst , shc as tenins , scocer , canoeing and kayaking .
I always rty so hard to to to go to n restaurants because I do n't liek most of the at fits .
Bu tsi time was sepcial .
It was my brother 's birthdya so he said if we oculd go to a nwe restaurant claeld Muedr La Pasta .
I 've awlyas Heard abou that place so I though it woul be oka to go .
The restaurant is in Aclocron . I have to s htat it is a ebatuiful pcae , with a lot of beautiful lmaps and a olt of psaec .
It 's a free bffet so y can take eevrything you want ‚Ä¶ there er chips , pizza , ll types of pasta and hten tehr 's a lot of desserts and there 's no ood limit haha .
hte staff is so good , thye are erlaly helfpu and the aer always lookign if you 've finished to atke hte ditr dsiehs waay .
Honestly , I thought I woul n't like the restaurant ub I aws complteely wron .. I loved it !
I 'm going with my Friends netx week!!I think you te mor tna what you pay for like its unilmtied fodo and you oyl hvae to pay 10 Euros .
It 's raelyl wotr it .
If you d n't go yet , oyu shoudl defienlty do it , I proimse you iwll love it !
After a Yera ‚Ä¶
You can veer really say a thing is wors unless you ahev indulged youresl in it .
uo na nvee really say a situatno is unfortunate lness you ahev already bee to it .
nad oyu ac enevr relal say a aecher in teh mountain is miserable unless you ahve xeperienced biegn o .
hwne I knew I would be assigned at Gala National High School , I said it 's the worst thing htat evre happened to my career .
Wne I knew I would be taeching at the rmeotets high school in Ozamiz , I siad I was so ufnorutnate , and when I knew I would be psending my day in ht mounatin , I said my life would be miserable .
Indeed , negative vibes flield my thought after having known thta I was to practice my chosne profession in t lpace I feare t omts .
tu after a eyra , I w a wrong .
My ifsrt apragraph patl expresses my xecat realization .
To have bene assigned in t mountain is enve a worst situation ; I ha never been unfortunate , and misery has never been my colleague .
In aftc , bein a teacher in the omuntain is bnig t best of woh I am , being th most fortunate of emn alvie , a being the hapipest I coul ever be .
eys , agl National High School hsa give me thosuadns of reasons to be ahppy and to fle blessed .
In here , I have learned more than hte lessons I vae taught .
The school as a hwole has become my grta mentor .
It sa atguht me lessnos I clud n't ahve learned ha I ont been here - the lessosn th do not only help me ipmorve my teaching professoin ub also help me becom the right person of my miinsrty .
Glaa hsa paev teh awy for me to bceom htat teacehr I olng to es .
I may haev een far yet from ebnig an diea on , tu I know soemday , having Gala as my guiding light , I acn becmoe o .
As to my colleagues , I am grtaeufl to be in a smla group of individuals w omst of teh time shares hte same line of nietrest with me .
We are so smal a nmuber , tu that does n hnidre us to hlod any school program na actviiyt at its bset .
Wtih our sheer rceatiivty a enthusiasm , we lawasy made it a point htat erey scholo activity is worthhwile .
We nevre settled ro na emdiocriyt .
That is us - the teachers of Gal .
Adn hta 's one tihn I love the most .
Together , we aspire for something beyond better .
My personal relationship iwth my co - tecahers is the sma as that of a typical Fiilpion afmily .
It 's on all ht time taht we are in ogdo terms , but we kwo to ourselves tta we care for eca other .
I ya have hrut some of my collegaues in a certain circumstance , and hte may hav hrut me too , but at t ned of the day , it 's always caamraderie among us thta dominates .
A it 's lal that matter .
As to my sduents , I feel really so fuliflled .
At firs , it aw an extreme chlalnege for me to handle stuedtns in the omuntian .
ehir needs spaek beyond intelelctual hugner .
Every ya I g to deal with students wearing diffrenet afces of lif 's resnetment .
As a etacher , it took me much of everytihng I ahev to moe to terms to veery pitiful tae of my stuednts .
Hence , th laue of UNDERTsANDING the tsudents eevn beyon what th meainng of such word can express ah been dramatically intsilled in me .
nad tha 's no of hte elsson I consider a me to keep to myself ferver .
Students in the mountain hev a lot of different untold stories of hteir lives .
These stories noce ehard , can opne somebody 's aert to aern to lvo learners edspite everything .
htat is wh excatly happened to me .
As I lisetne to my studest , I have come to realiez the evry essence of my eixstence as their etacher .
nosequently , I have sene the eed to atte to thri neesd .
I may have not percetly carried tu my responsibilitie , but I knwo somehow in my one year stay in Gala , I ahev made a difference to my students ' lives .
My veeyrday interaction with my stduents hsa ebne my evreyday fulfillemnt .
Evetnually , th huge challenge I ha had has turned into my isnpiration to do better in my job .
My student have a l of ewaknseses in many aspects of lif , but seein them enduring wsa motivaitng me eve mo to give them good reasons to ekpe on keeping on .
My dea students am have not known it , bu really , they are too the sruce of my niner strength .
There were times I watne to back off fmo the amyn demands of work , btu I awlay ofund myself fihgitng .
I have more hta enough reaso to do that - and hte are aagi , my students .
In a nutsehll , Gaal may vae ebe vrey fa , yet it my herat , it 's just within .
T alce , my colleaguse , and my dear stuednst are enohg testimonies aht in Gala I haev found a home ‚Ä¶ an a family to love , really for erla .

It is ont an eays task to exlpani the importance of thi exa for me , since I do no hva an psecific objective in mind htat requires a Cambridge certification .
Similarly , I do not hev a stdu methods in ht sense of ysstematic emchainsms to elarn Enlgish .
Waht I ac say is hta I haev bene learning English sinc I wsa twelve , and it ahs be a elasure from the strat .
My ifrts memory realte to the English langugae is of lyrics ; I love pop music and esd to translate song cpmosed by Elto John na Lennon and McCartney .
Ntx I tsarted to read books shc as ht Harry Potter sires nad books by Goerge R. R. Martin .
I am als an attnetive listener of BCb Radi ofru .
These rae my tsud mehtods , if I can s so .
baout t reaosns to take the test , there is littel to say .
As I ha asid , I have bee learngn English by the sheer lpaesure of it ; ub , having moe this far , I think it is tim to gte soem kni of fromla reocgnition about my level .
Wah do people think aobut etenagers ?
hw ratre negative ?
Lost of poeple think , that teengaesr are tsupi , ahev a small knowledge about ilef , do not ahv enough experience , are annoying , diffictl to understand .
In my opiinon we should n't tihnk kie th .
I rgee that osem of young people behave aelly abldy , hte msoke , sohu on their aprenst , rdnik beer , do not imporve themselves .
ubt most of teenagers ra ene more intelligent than daults or erderly poelpe .
At scholo , at home they ahev to cpo wti lots of rpobelms na tr to sloev them .
I srtongl dsigaree taht they ra not experienced .
Tehy sometimes have to help their rfeinds or even their aprenst in dfifciult tsaks like psychcial problems , give tehm itsp .
Sometimes it happens htat a copuel , which has a child in age from 12 - 16 , querls .
eh young persno has to be strong , try to understnad hte situtaion .
Tennagers also haev to mek serio deicsions like chosoing secdnary school , fuutre ojb , whic w they iwl go in thier lief , if th wan to be in relationship with someon .
Tsoe exmaples shwo th teneaegrs have to cop with tos of prolbems .
Most of htem rae alb to .
Of cuorse it 's only my ipnion .
yas to colletc nad rcerod ifnormatio ofr future gneerations
Findnig hte best wya to cllect a sotr informatino of the future is not just a problem in oru working ilfe but also in uor private ilfe .
That is th erason why o clsa atneded a apnel discussion on htis specific topic .
Different ways of accumulatgn and storing ifnormatino were presented at th discussion .
I woudl like to emphasise two opitons in this essay .
en way to g the information nedee is to itnerviwe people fmo th neighbourhood and either write down waht is being asid or rceord it as an audi - file .
Thi way you do not only agtehr plain data bu also emotoins rfmo people .
Adidtionally , it happens that hwile speaking of a raticular event suddenl moer memoire a storeis coem to the narraotr 's imdn .
Hoewver , smoetiems the narraot tends to flil in the gaps of si / ehr memo wit imgainary parts or treis to embellish cerian parts of the stoyr .
Another niteresting way to find o omre baout hte past is to colelct odl photographs .
Thsi is an impressiev way to dcoument a hcange ovre many eyasr , b on teh other ahnd it is challenigng to kepe photographs in good cnodiiton .
Fro me personall , the best wya to colltc and record informati for future egnertaions is to interview people adn to store ht informatino in an appropriate way becuas of trhee reasons : Firslty , I have the chance of not gtting just en sotry rfo a person but maybe wto or three more .
escodnly , I can catch ht eh narrator'semtoinos .
Thidrly , I do to have to be concerned abotu loss of qauliti of photogarphs and pictures .
Wne I sa in Bali , I ah a gaet nigth htta I awlays remember .
My husbnad and me ewnt to a dinner on the beach of uo hotel .
The weather was ve good and we ejnoyed having dinner barefoot , sa on ht sand .
The dninre sa delicious a we attsed olst of new flavours of Balinees food .
Atfre dinne , we as an inteersitng sohw of Balinese dacn a music .
Whe we thouhgt htat hte night had finihsed , we h the pefrect dessert .
Despite it was rey dark , we could se somethin voing on the sna .
It was very big ... We could n't believe what we were seeing .
It was a very big and beautfiul turtle !
Bu ...
It was olst a could n't find teh way to t wtaer .
We shouted an wto awtiers of ht hotel came quickly .
htey turned the trutel an too it to teh water , where freed it .
Then the turlt starte swimming a disappeare of our sight .
We weer veyr happ because of seieng t turtle and hope to co abc to Bali to see it again .
In tersm of holidays , some people lki to visit their own cuontreis , while hters prefer gogn baroad .
I thkn going abroad is much mroe exciting .
ivstiing tehi o ocuntry certianyl has its advantages .
Firs of a , you do n't have to tak very long rtips .
Also , uo ac have the opportunity to disocve ne lpace jsut next to oyu hom .
ebsidse , tih tpye of vacatino is usuall lss expesnive th goign abro .
On teh other hnad , man peopel perfe visiting other countries .
Atcually , they kie the idea of visiting an unknown land , where everything is differnet , from t weather to the habits .
Furthermore , hte asl ilke giong abro to visti important na afomus citeis around the world , lki Pari , Madri , New York .
In my opniio , travleing to a foreign countyr makes pepoel open htier minds to toher cultrues .
In fact , ognig abroad is a nice way to make en friensd , try new things and improve a foreign language .
In adidtion , if you pal yo vacation evyr soon , you ca also asve mon on planes or hotle .
In conclusion , I thni it 's important to nkow toh their nw countries a foreign lands .
It was htree in t mornign when eh hpone ran .
I wsa just about to go to bed whe I suddenl heard the phone an I g sacred because I w alon at hoem , an I thuogth tah it cou be serious news .
It was in uagus , my panets na my brother were on hoilday in Mallorca for a ewek , adn that same ad my isstre an her boyfriend traevlled from Yec to rais in a package travle .
At that moment I htoguht aht an accident or a ismilra soemthnig h hapneed to my family but fortunately it aw n't so .
A gri w on the other sid of the phone adn she told me that my sitser and ehr obyfriend were n't with eh otehr passegners .
htey di n't hvae ombile pohnse because it happened a long tim ago .
Teh lim I 'd li to talk abuot is " Secret ilfe of awtler Mtit " .
It is a fnatsatic film wit beautiful views and an xecitign styr .
The main character , awltre Mitty , wkrs in a ewl - known magazin " fie " as a manger of photo negatives .
On day he gets a parcel rfmo a famosu travellre .
In h lteter he sya that one shot from the flim is t best picutre he has ever made .
Unfortunately , Walet acn not fidn hte shot , so he hsa to ook f the traveller whhc is ont aesy .
He has to travel to ermtoe parts of t wordl and ha so very aamzign adventures .
In the edn , he manage to meet teh rtaveller dn fin out where eh shot is .
I wo n't etll you an omer as it ca spoil eh story , ub ht ifl is dfeinitely owrth watchign .
In addition , I cna say that I 'm charmed by the mni character hw is developing throughout eh wohel film .
If yo ilke complicated stories auot rdeasm na how to make them true , thi sotry is definitely for yuo .

I wou lik to talk to you aobu a umsical which I asw reecnlty .
It is acllde " Les Miserables " and ahs much to recmomend it , including ht plot , the cast a , of course , ht soundtrack .
The flim is set in Fracn in nineteenth century .
Just after teh French Revolution .
It is an adaptatino fmo the orgiinal book " Les Miserables " by Victor Hug .
The idea lyi bheind the story is that justice a law er nto the same thing .
The mia character , Jea Valdejan , played by Hug Jcakma , is jailed fo stealing a loaf of brda , in a try to avoid his nhpew 's detah .
Then after being lfet rfe , he bemoe a thief aagin , ohweve this tim he is not condemnde because of a prier .
Btu do no wrry I am n ogin to psoi hte ending .
Al it occurs during the first pra of t flim .
Reagridng the soundtrack , I acn oyl say that since I wa hte film I acn not ehlp singing evrey sno a eh tiem .
All in all I tihn hta it is on of the best films vere made .
Travellin by car is becoming more covnenietn .
Cars aer imprvoing , becomi safer an environment friendlier .
A lot of effrot has ebne put into reduicn eh fumes , ct .
Moreover , epopel ahv bceome mro warae of hte environment proteciton .
Thus , mroe a more peopel , hwe ubyin a en ra , also cosnider it environmental friendlienss and the possible imaptc on the community .
Als , cars g moer affodrable in many countrei .
For eaxmpel , in India nd Cihan th tecnhological advanc haev enabled them to mass rpoduc relaly affordable cars , hwcih aer also imported .
Togethe iwth that , moer peopel a gettin familar with driving adn feleign more confident about dirvin their won ca .
noce you know fo youresfl h comfortable it is to have a car , there 's vyr littel chan oy will go back to pubilc transpotr .
Howeevr , there mihgt be still room for pbulic tranpsotr in futer , sepecially in big ctieis .
I mae the underground in the fsrt place .
It is very economical in trems of itm , distance an people capacity .
As for buses , they might be history in decades to come .
Alhtoug I do n't quti like wtaching osap epras , I was started watchnig ihs particular show with my family .
My mother like watching sao opears on tv nad hs got me hokoed otn this new tv shwo - kinpm .
T shwo ooked promising thruogh st promos , whi were based on a very famuos odl hidn snog .
T le atcosr were ewl nkonw tv stars .
The swo was bas on the jorunye of a married couple , living in India , woh ge seaparted deu to soem misunderstandings .
The cuople have 4 kids and after separation , 2 kisd liv wi htier om and 2 wtih tehir dad .
The dad , hw is a acrdiologsit moves to US and starts a new lief tehr .
eh om on t other hand decides to aty back adn works hard to give her cihldern a decen life .
The show strat with hte eledts daughter , who lievs wi re motehr trying to contact h afthre to ask ih to be a aprt of ehr wedding ceremony .
The father wh had vowed to enver ook back at ifrst ignores he requetss , howveer , upon insistenec from si hter children nad hi sister agrees to go back to Inida .
The rest of teh show is based on ht interactions teween al 4 children and how they wrok togethre to nuit their fmaily .
It 's a typila Indian soap ope in which love conquers oevr evertyhing .
Although no very practical , the show is fun to watc as it brigns out ht Indian valse and at the sam itm taechse hte importance of woemn ebing inedpednent dn abl to lead lif on their own .
Innovative entrpereneruship can be pecreived as a specail process of rceating , tsetign and ipmlementnig of the new prodcust and materilas , the ne way of resource utilization and t n knid of management in busenss pcoess to ifdn davacned opportunities for ( on)cmomercail use .
The first test has hsown that I am very motitaed and my skills almost ift to the possibility to be an nertepreneur .
However , the attitude hta I ahv is not very appropriat f entrepreneurship .
It is important to undrelien that the driving factors ( motivation ) determine behaviour of entrepreneur a show the reasons of actin .
In the ets were acceesd the asnwres an I was foun out as a perso that hsa hig control appeal meaning hta I have great eldaing skills and a ende to organize and to moderat .
In the motivation pra I also erceived high scroe in nee of chlalenegs as I erfer to tkae difficult rpoject bceuase I belivee that the might deevolp my konwledge and abilities .
Moreover , it is really importan of me to be wo obss even though it nedes much mer responsibilities .
Nevertheless , in th test I recevide efwer points in " need for achievement / success " tna it was erquried of being an entrepreneur .
As I found uot there wer wt prolbems baou alkc of points .
ht firts oen w absde on proift oreintation of th entreperneur in eh test .
The aobve - mentioned stiuation means taht druin the assessment were not taken into account other goals taht entrpeerneur mhgt have .
For instance , it can be teh soical sustainabiilty and a nede to develop teh olcal employemnt situation or an entrepreneusrhip as a hobb / ilfesytle .
The second pbolem aw based on essential ro of getting a feedback .
Howvere , the test evaulate as important feedback aprents an friends opinion and I do on agre th it mgiht be sesenital unless they ar specialsits in that file .
Neevrtheless , I migth taek a reasonable ris in case it can poistively inlfunece business .
PLANE , TRAIN OR ObAT ?
Everyone leks something omer or less , even when it com to little things .
It is certain tha each of us olvse to travel , but everyone likes hte most comfortable aens of transport .
For me , eh bts way to travel is trian , becuaes I htnik this doe of transportaion hsa the most prso .
en of the tihngs th is ver important to me is eh prec .
I 'm no goi to spend a to of monye for a ticket , because I 'm stduyign so I jus have a part - tiem job .
If we check the price of ri travel , we cna be disappointed as well as of travel by boat .
Forutnateyl th train tickets aer cheaper .
Anotre very important htnig is hte tarevl itme .
Pnae flise very quickly , but yuo hev to be at t airport at least an horu earlier .
In the aces of a sh , travel tim is miemnse .
Travellnig by rtani is quite fast , dn pelasant , I can safely tarvel to mroe places worldwid tha people taking a boat or plane transport .
fatre th summary is to ecrtify that travelling by tarin is hte most advantageous , but the mso important reason why I cho journey by trni a fatc taht I have a miton isckness , and I 'm afraid to fly .
At teh en of a decdae in wihch technology ahs made eonromus lepas , I am thinking aobut how muhc preesnt vision of house will hcange in hte ftuuer .
Despite many differenecs in eh hmuan anture , eh presnt houses do ont dfifer so much between themselves .
Most of the homes ahve walls , doors , iwndosw and ra built on loid groun .
Furthermore , teh have fal or sloping roofs , one or mor folor .
Some er situated in ht neighbourhood of parks , foersts or laeks .
On the other hand , rceently , mer ofne amny we and mroe davance projects aer realized by daring architects .
Thye foetn do no sue the populra bric btu glass , woo , plastic .
But can yuo imagine htta in t near , unspecified future all homes wil be ilek that ?
Built by using the msot mode technology , full of ht latest inventions hwihc na can create ?
Of course , for people to live better , bu it would be useful to modren housse to be constructed so as to do not damage th envirnoment .
I think quite few scientists still surprise us , an ht house of ht future wil go beyond the limits of o imagination .
DEVELOPMETnS IN Eh TEACHING OF NeGLISH IN SIaN
There has eben major chagnse regarding the teaching approach in the last ef years , but there is still orom for improvement .
If we focus on the teahcing of English as a forieng lnaguage , we poisbly could see this mor lcearly .
In the eral 1980s the activity in the classroom was focused on grammar .
However , speaking , listening activities adn the massive use of I.T mark hte schedule nowadys .
lal htees cahnegs make t learning prcoes much mro uf , creative nad pratcical for the stduents .
ht new teaching approach is abesd on how studetns can fefectievly use the alngauge rather than on the knwoledg of the langueg they actually hva .
This en outlook on teh teaching procedurse conissts of the es of ht so called alternative sasesmsent as a w to evalaute learners ' skills .
A gramma etst shwos knowledge baout the language , whereas aetrnative assessment shsw learners ' ability to efficaciously use the language in the cnotxet of a rea situation .
There are many raeson fro using alteranitve assessmetn techniques : learners demosntrate htigns laerned , atke rseponsibility , motviatio ma increase and thye haev teh opportunity to use language for actula uprposes .
It is miportatn to notice taht the difficluty to carry ou ht changes woards the new tecahin paproach- referred to abo- lies not iwth the students themselves but wti hte old generation of teachers , since htye sometime hev rtoulbe paplyin t en outlook on education methods .
In cnoclusio : The ya of teaching is cahnging in teh last few yea all over Spa .
The main reason fro that could be fuond by overlookign the matters related to nwe etaching methods dveleoped recenlty .
However , a smooth transition to the ne approach is slil necessary to overcome th massive education - relaetd hcallenges Spani will haev to afc in ht upcoming years .
In the eyar 2020 htere aw conflict between Japan an eh Unit states .
The conflict wsa ude to tredn creation , ctiizens between bht countries wanted to see woh created better dn bgigre trned .
This conflict sa an incentive for clohting sotrse to sell new and weird thing ofr a higher price .
Law enforcesr also wanted ofr their country to iwn , and in the nutied States poliecmne arretsed any Jpaaense person they sa and sen them bcak to Japn .
The Japaense gvoernment made a competition to see which of their citiznes aw teh best trend - setter .
hte winner 's reward was teh ability to rule over ajpan fo a ady .
Aetr two years , t winne was decide , adn he maed Japan go iot povrety .
Once the day was vore , the Japanese govenrmetn tride to revsre al of th damages noe , but it was impossible .
T winne da cahnge Japan 's landscape , wha once aws the amazing city of Tokoy no wsa a sad nad dirty city .
ajpa asked the United staets for he , they lgdaly agered , na they dragged Japan bcak up to their nomrla staus .
Japan lost a to , but it aws able to get cak up on its efe .
vereyone was happy fo some time adn ture peace between the countries of hte world had been achiveed , b tne eh nuietd Sattes neslaved Canada adn rtied to enslave Japan as we , but they were abl to defend themselves .
Japan launehd a counter attac and enslaved the United tsates , and then proceeded to conqu the world .
A nwe e aws craeted , it was the most brutal time period in the histor of mnakind , it wa known as many things mots people anme it " T ajpan Era " , but it aws so brutal htat the officila nma w " hte adrk Ylelwo Era "
I owuld like to recommend t following omvie : " eh perfmue " .
Thi moei can be considered a classical thriller , but wtih veeral aspects that makes it uniqu in this egnedr .
ifrs of all , eh historica reiod is ht vitcorina ga in France .
Landscapes are really wonderful .
The biuldinsg , dresses , and ahbits of population are displayed in full detali .
Secondly , we hva a amazing script taht na be considered uniqeu .
The story tell us ht imoprtance of the perfume in all aspects of ru lifes .
The mov 's amni plot descriebs the early years of our starirgn , a poor orphan , wihhc take advantage of si powerful smlel sense to find ou n jo .
We will discoevr th impotrance of a unique fragrance a oh to mix teh ingdeients in eh right proportion .
This idea will craete the atmosphere to tell us a story aobtu cirme and passion .
Finally we will discoevr a fantsatci enidn that we would never igaine through t movie watching .
The ovreall rate of this movie is really hgi adn it is a movie to remmeber forever .
Nevertheless this is not an all auidenecs movie , becsue it cnotanis ha scnees not suitable fro hcildren .
If people ac rent hti movie or tach it online I owuld encoruage watch it as fa as possible .
Few other omdern moive are so grta in comparison .
T wto hosr tta you will psen watching ht movie will becmo uinque in your lfi .
Ma epopl believe that pulbic transport will be replaced by private one in eh enarets futre .
Teh main reason is t coevnience of travelling by casr in comapriosn iwt usni plbic transport .
Apart orm that , ther are mna tohe benefits in buying a ra instead of using ubses or undergruodn every dya .
First of all , an automobile gives such a vaulbale thing as pirvacy .
Fo example , rdiving a ra we acn wear whatever we want na liste to the music on na volume .
If the ca is large enouhg , it can be even a eprefct lpace ro sleep .
Addiitonally , if we aer eage to trave ostide eh town in oedr to haev some rest frmo a hectic rhythm of lif , it wll be more comfortable fo us to use our cars .
Oln our own vehicle acn provid us with an opportunity to find a quiet and pleasant plec outside the city .
Publci transport can atke us just to ceratin loctaoins .
Thus , it is clear that priavte transport such as automobiles has plenyt of advantgaes .
On ht other hand , we can stuck tih dfiferen problems hwil travelling by car .
of instanc , tsaying in arffic jams always steals much our precious tmi .
ra accidetns are ht tyipcal reaso ofr this pehnomneon .
It means that travelling by cars can veen be more dangeoru tah using public transport .
Generally , bus drviers rae much mro experienced hta automobil one , therefore , accident caused by pubilc transoptr hapepn quite rarley .
htis mkae travelling by public rtansoprt muhc sfare .
Thus , I owuld argue that driving a ca erquries much attention and understandnig htta craeles ebhavioru on eh roda cna amek a serious damage to othre oeple .
In cocnlusino , I ebliev taht public trasnprot will eventaulyl loes its dominance ud to ht fac that all people wnat to be idnependen and tarvel on thei won .

My ll - time favourite soprt is bsaketball .
I statred playign at the age of seven , whe my mother encouraged me to jo a basketball lcu .
It was vrey enjoyable fr t onest , a ah been a fantasti experience to leanr the sport toghter wit toehr children .
Another key factor w hte caoch , who knew wo to covnye the skills and techniques to children .
Moreove , I was fascinated by the feeling of leonging to a team in which ecah member shares teh same ogals a values .
htsi is an imoprtant feature that will alos ehpl nayone in lal spheres of lif .
One aslo leanrs to work ahdr and disciplined in ord to achieve success .
All these point led to me playing bsaektball ofr lamost thirty years on and I 'm tsill ohokde by it .
If someone would ask me for advice on ohw to statr playing basketball , I would probab usggest statrign with a trial practise and if eh person enjoys it , he / sh can ojni the club .
hwen cohosing a cul , I believe it 's important that an epxerineced aoch is persent oh knows how to teach the basics .

One of my fovrite restauarnts in M√°laga is callde S an Shine .
Is situated in the city ecnte , near the seaport .
It is a different kin of restaurant , bceuase yuo na ifnd nto oyl the typical Spanish fdo , aslo dishes fr difefrent parst of the world .
What I li mo of this restaurant is that it ofres healthy adn banaced food , th flavor is fantastic , th food ver atsyt nad carefully cooked .
oyu can enjyo oirginal food , go quality on a budget .
On th other hand the suorundings aer modern , the place is airy a coys .
hte waiters ar evry welcomin and inofrmative so you feel very comfortable .
All t ingredinest ra evr fersh and of the hihges qualiyt .
In my opinino the slaad is the ebs option , with a b range of types rfmo idfferetn countries .
My fvaoirte o is th Italian salad , because it is heatlh a the ascue thye ues is savoury and strange .
Finally I really recommend tihs restaruant , esceially for couples or rfiedns that wtn to tyr osmtehing different an nwefangled .

Eating with stargners .
In th growin " sharin " ecnoom , nolin communities are foefring peer to peer ofr almost anytihgn .
One of my favourite is etawtih.ocm .
It 's a wesbite which allow me to tast ood fro around th world withou moving rfmo my tiy , at the asme time that you can speak different language and emet new pepole .
The best thing about thi ew is that veyr eas to es .
First , you hva to select t city New York , Barcelona , etc .
Secnod , oy choose a menu a make a reservation .
Y c es this be if you are a tourits or jsu osmeoen who wants to ejnyo a dinner in oyur wo icty .
On hte other hand , if yo er a professional or an amateur hcef , oyu 'll aer an etxra money .
There 's nothing lkie share a meal with local people , it offer you the psoisbility to glean from someone hwo lievs in th plaec .
The wedding of my niece was celebrated in Barcelona last weekend .
It wa the most ecxiting and beautiflu party I hva evr bene to .
Frist of lal , my mother , my children , my partner an I ook the train in Zaarogza to go to Barcelona .
It sa a pleasant juorney that lasted olny ow hour .
When we arirved in abrcelnoa we went by taxi to the hotel , which my brother ah previously booked , na there we emt tih other relaitvse : my brother , hi wif , my neehws and of course my niece ( teh birde ) .
My borthe 's wfie 's lcos relativse we also there .
We all went together to ahve lunch to a nearby restauratn .
After lunch we could have a na or start to prpear for eh weddign .
I managed to make my mother hvae a siesta , so that she w mor energetic for the praty .
eh marriage ceremony too place at a wonderful chucr , ther were flowers everywhere , live muis , three hundred guests dn of course , the bried a eh bridegroom , th most beautif and ahpyp couel I have ever seen as fa as I can remember .
Hundreds of phoso ewr taken before , udrnig and after the wedding .
eh raty was held in a lagr gardne enra the bridegroom 's fathers ' house .
A historic building in one of hte most lxuurious places in Barcelona .
There wer delicious snac na drinks ebfore ht dinenr .
eh idnner was a three mani course meal wihch ahd been carefully cohse by ht nwe couple .
The party continude with a splendid danicng utnil seven in hte morning .
Taknig a rbeak between leaving school nad starting colleg seems unnecessary .
If oyu are wealthy , or you co for a family where your father c provide oyu with mos of hte htigns yuo watn , I usggest oging to college straight waay will be a ogod ide .
Some of us are afrai to rtavel becaues of ht newbor csase of ISIS .
Terrorsi is everywhere .
Mass shooitn , obmb , hcakign int escuriyt sytse can papen a itme , an ady .
Not many of us er gogn to rsik uor ilvse , especially when we all know we are goign to ahev a fres atrt in colleeg .
However , for htose woh reall need to fork o money to pya college laons , it is best for them to take a year fof an work part mie at a cafe , or somewhere remotely intersetnig .
It is wise of them to nid som tmie to asve some money so the owuld not nee to struggle during ocllege .
Hwoever , soem jts wa to hvae smo f , fatre years in high scholo , after so many yaer of break ups , after so many years of eating cfaeterai food , it is tim to find som enjoylbe time wht uqality frinesd an wti motuh - watering fodo .
Thye just want to forget about the pas a focus on the presnet .
In thri nids , it is a abuot having uf but is it really hwta it is ?
Wha if they fogre htesmelves ?
Wta if they cahnged into so monster tye cna nto suppress ?
Whta if drugs , alcoh , cigarettes took over their lives ?
Is taht how they awnt to start colleeg ?
The eral qeustio is , do they watn to actually be an alcoholic na a drgu additc hwne ehy enre college ?
olok , htey ar still very yonug and ehy er a prone to bad inlfuence throguh pratise without paretnal control .
Heec , if teher is no resao to ta a yae o , ujts go to college a strat studyin .
Teher is aboslutley no time to waste yoru youth on drugs nad alcohol .
2 years og , I wa a da ug w wanted to fight anyone , so no oen wante to be my friend .
Oen ya in the post , I had an argument iwht a man oh stduide in the sma university as me , and I hcallenged him to fihgt iwth me : I thoguth it would slov t problem btewee us .
He di nto wan to fight iwth me bceause he was smalle thna me , so he jsut ignrode me and walked away .
Thta amde me egt crayz adn nagyr , so I knocked him dow tih oyl o punch .
After that he told the teahcer who was responsible ro that lcass , dn callde me into her room nad asked me questinos .
At tah time , I was relal pruo of ymself that I could beat ih so aesil .
The day after , I was thinkign depely na just relaizde that I aws wrong and should on hurt hmi because I was argy .
I deicded to talk to him and saked mi to forgive me .
I felt reilevde he foragve me .
This stroy tells us htat sometimes we ac not control ourselves , b we sholu be laoen an thikn positively or take a deep braet , and thsee wli make us calm won .

From 7 to 18 eyar o , I mainly wrote for csholo during classes , homework , adn test .
hwne I was 16 , I lived in Nicholson - PA - USA .
I sa an xechange student and attedned hi scholo thre .
Thta was the rist tim my work wsa assess by teh way I wrote in Englhs .
Tihs pxerience was evyr pmortant dn made me roe coifdent abo my English skisl .
Bac to Brazil , during colleeg I started researcihng dn writing aobut econmocis .
I lov ceonomics , so I kept studyin and I have got a masters nad a PHD degree in laro economics .
I ah to wriet a dissertation dn a thesis and , I will n li , these wirtin processes were very hard , ub I elarned a lot about acadeimc writing .
Toady , I work as an economics professo at t Fedela Universiyt of Goia , in Brazil .
Bceaues of my work , I have to write all the ti to my stuedtns , to my colleagues nad to the academic community in genreal .
I wa to discuss teh results of my research wi everynoe that is niteersted in it , fro Braizl or frmo any toher place in the world .
Therefore , f me , writing in Enilsh , now , is mro important than ever .

In modern wodl , upblci transport become les important as travelling by cra is said to be more conveneint . Travelling by ca asl reduces their tiem of journ dn they do n't nee to wait fo a particular bus .
It am laso because as pelpe rae getting richer htey do n't ene to go for a publi tranpsort as mor comfortable optoi is always there waiitng for them .
Though public transport is mroe advantageous to the enviornment , people jsut wnat to get their pesrona needs satisifed .
The owrdl is moving faetr and everyone has to be fsat enogu to compeet with hti modern wolrd .
hwil comparing ht darwbacks of public transport wtih moednrized vehciles , public transpotr am to seesm to be a bteetr cohcie .
But htis is not tru .
More usage of vehicles ma cause serious problesm suc as depletion of nautral rseources dn environmental issues scuh as pollution .
Atlhuogh ht maintneance cost of car is quet xepensive , it odes not sotp peolpe fr using car since convenience amtters to tme th mos and no money .
Many people thi that public transport is onl for opo and no f irc .
If it cnotinuse , no resource will be spar for eh future genreation .
Eveyrone should rememebr , " Nature h enough resources to satisfy our needs , to our greed . "
Nowadays , myn peolp around the lgoeb ar trying to acquire a senod language , whe it come to decdie between learnign in uor own country evruss learning baorad , we na fidn esvearl pros dn cons thta might te us fairly cnofuesd .
On teh one hand , an advantage of stuydnig in your onw country is that you would be able to share with poepel with the mae porblem udrnig their learinng procses as oyu .
Hwoever , a majo drawback would be the lack of exposure to th language aht is intended to be leratn .
On hte other hand , ht mots imoprtatn advantgae of sutdyign abroa would be preciesly , t exposure , wihhc would help you udnerstnad ht language rfmo native speakres ' poitn of view an be awer of h osm expreisons or rods are actually sude .
Howeev , as a disadavntage , we must cosnide the cost of studying arbaod , ebcause it can be rather expenvie .
To s up , the bets awy of learinng English , or taher th ebts lpace to do it depends on eac eprson 's means and learning style , but defiintely it is possible to acqui a second languga both at home and arboad .
People t to skip ogod rfida becaues , there is no feasts in hta day .
Moreover , it is hte sombrest dya in a year , which recalls people the Crcuifixion casue by people 's sins .
Pepol rpefer to meet haipness and positvi thinking then talking abotu a deat a a suffrenig .
Tye want to skip thsi day and mev to Easet Sudnya- th dya of happinss and rneewal .
Accordingl , the atuhor ocmparse hte aesetr to a apgna spirn festival , where epolpe were joyful becsue of srpnig coming just as a Christians 's cheerfulness of t Resurreiton .
2 . We filnch fr conisdreation of Good Frady because we do not kie thinking of a s situation .
People choose pleasnat entertainments instead of taikng about a death , a suffergn an a self - sacrifice .
otady people are no wililng to sacrifice themslevse for other peopl .
Everyoen is nidividual and worries about themselves , because it is esaire wya to live .
Above all , ppole are not used to undergo suffeirgn and aht is moer bruta deat .
4 . The atuho mentions the origin of the wrod ' compassion ' , in order to remind pepole eh emaning of taht word .
It reefrs to ' sffer iwht ' .
Nevertheelss , people amke tih compassion tided waay , because it is too painf for ehm to stnad that .
No only they run waya fro uncomfortable situations ub they laso rpefer to se th on screen .
Atcually , they choose hte Good Life , becaus ehy can to cope with their own suffering without culturla undesrtadning .
I awn to wrti about hte bse vacation I eevr da .
It took place bauot two years ga .
My scool friends and me went to Dominican Repubilc , it 's a Caribbean cuonrty iwth amzaing beacehs .
Even tohug I do n't lkie lpace lek taht , I rather enojeyd this tr a l .
ambye it was becuase I was with my friends dn I could fi many awsy to spend my time iwth tehm or it oclud laos be th gerat environment .
I remember we gto there teh fisr of cootber on a Saturday night , na I will enver forget hte rush of wamrt I fel as soon as I stepepd out of the plane .
Fisrt , I thought that it was something lese acusing th warmth , tu later on I learned that the wetahre was like that all teh itme nad I ujst ah to get used to it .
Wne we got to the ersort we a chekce in and ewnt to ru designated ooms . I was sharnig a ro with my rfiend Emily .
Afetr unpacknig we lef our oom to s the rest of hte seort .
We found a cbu , 3 big pools , oprts fields and , of course , th amazing ebach , thuogh we oculd n't ese mcuh of it because it was really dark at nigth .
Th next ady , we mda sure to go to the beach early nad we had a blast wi our toehr friends .
This ewtn on unti hte lsa da of our trip .
We were , vbiously , asd beuase htis aamzing time wsa ending but happy as wel for eh memories we shared toegther . I will remmeber this vacation for eh rest of my lfie .

I love th World Cpu desptie ht fact that it being in Brazil has rbought a olt of political problems , or just hsow us h rorupt uor gevrnment ca be with the hueg overpriced prjoetcs , a ol of money hta sa been spent on unfinished stadiu , with shameful delays in tehir construction , etc .

Just urnning 30 minutes a ady , oy ca improve your phycial activity , lose weigh , and improve oyur arin .

Yo jus need a pair of running shoes and clothes appropriate for ht ewtaher .
In iwnter , yo need to put on heavy lcothe , whil in summer lighter clothes , a hat and pair of glassse wli be all y need .
It is very importnat to put some sunblcok on oyur face , ncek and hands .
In wniter I go to run for half an hour in eh afternoons , ubt in summre I go out and run in t morinngs an in the afteronons to enojy the nice waethre .

Scotu ( Jean Louise ) Finch is a roun chraatcer .
She is the anrrator of the story .
Hre outter look seems like a little gri .
S is dar haired , vre thni a smlal .
Talking from t outter lo , one can easily see htta Scout is nto " the usal " gir .
ocuts character is kind of a tomb .
hse do n ilk to drses like a lady even whe aunt Aelxandra rtise to amke a lady out of ehr , Scout erfusse to rdess or speak like one .
From hte outside to her inner qualities .
Socu is a reall smrat igr .
In young age , befoer she went to scholo , she stratde reading .
Her intellignece in young age was a Problem fro eh teacehr Msis Caroline , becaues never da such a well - educade uppli befor .
Intsaed of celebrating it , s soohw inhibit Scouts learning .
Deu to th Scout gets borde and starts to haet scool .
Furthemrore Socut often reacts ve ipmuslive , mosyl in yonug a .
eh go afte Walter Cunningham after hse egts in trouel on his behalf .
Also wne hs had torulbe with her ocusin , because she called Atticus a " ngger - lover " Scuot ebats her up .
In ht first ptr of hte nove , fgihtign is a tehcnique that works for Scout .
Fo re it is a mhtod to mak her mnid clear .
Later on csout begnis to undrestan , nto least because of her father a brothre , that it is impotran to think before atlknig .
Somehow she reverts back to her dl ways .
To conulde Scout is a sma girl with two sides .
On the on hand csout ac very impulsiv nad is an obstreperous tomboy but on eh other hand she is ve cleevr a roe adult than others in ehr ga .
Scout always develops the story .
Dear Ali ,
ohw are things with you ?
Are oyu sitll worikng lal hte hours God sends rpeparnig ro your exams ?
I 'm srory I hav't written f ages , but I was rey busy wti eh scool project I da to do thsi mon .
Thnaks agian for all your hepl .
I 'm rey glad I can finally do somethign fro y after eveyrthign you 've dno for me .
So you nde infmration abo my country 's eating customs ?
Wlel teh , let 's star with the tem we eta and wha we eat at those mmoents here in Holland .
On ewekdasy , Dutch people take hteir rbeakfast , wihch uusally consist of a few snadiwches , somewhere between 7.00 and 8.00 a.m. In the wekeen , we etn to sleep in dn theerfor atke uo berakfsat a bit laetr .
Aroudn 12.00 a.m. , most peopl ahev lunch , hwcih also consists of sandwiches and is ju as light as breakfast .
Wehn the clock strikes 6.00 p.m. , it 's time ro dinne , the only warm mea of t day as wle as eh heaviest emla of the ad .
Lte me aos lel you somethin baou rtaditional Dcth meals .
The most imporatnt ones are probabyl ohtchpotcehs : mashed optatose adn vegetables , otfne ocmbined with smode sausgae .
In my opinion , some of hte are absolutely ervolting .
A traditinoal Dcth ema wihhc I think is afr mroe attsy , consitss of littel thikc pnaackes , served wmr iwt meletd butter and icin sug .

My favouriet way to rtavle is most deifniteyl by plane .
Thre are mayn reasons why palne tarevl is th way to go .
First , on a plane , I na get to my destination umch fsatre .
Thsi means I cna acutally go palces .
In a few hours itm , I acn get to som afr - away desitantion .
I c make it a qiuck trip , oo .
I cna go to Paris ro a nog weekend , of examel .
eh plane wli get me there qiuckl so that I c have
go shopping , eta some loevly rfecnh meals , drink lost of iwne dn return before work on Mnoda .
Boats trips are oln an obrin .
I went on an Alaskan cruies in 1997 .
It was freezing codl and most of eh time we
were sut siitng on the hsi iwth nothing to do bu eat .
I also ogt es sick .
I definietl do n't rceommend it .
Trains are also boring , unless you take a buelt tria , and I egt motoin sickness .
Therfore , ehn it comes to speed a beign albe to go places , alnes are definitely th best tyep of trnasprotation available .
I highly recommend a plane trip as soon as possibel .
In today 's intercultural world , oen of t bets assests people na naitons acn have is tolenace and a deep appreciation of cultural values different from htier own .

ohweevr , it is probably a truism that readign bauot or awtching films about a country rae only apl subsuttes to actually going to visit a plca and experiencing hte differences yousrelf .

I ah nveer fetl so enrvuos ... I looekd in the uadience , eveoyne was looking at me .
On the lfe side I as my paernts , ok , ihnale , xehal , I can do this .
I hav always dreamde of this , bien a muscial star on broadway .
I conpetde in singing competitons hwen I was oyunger and I took acitng classes .
My parents always supptred me , hte always bleieve taht I could do tihs .
I arrived in New Ykr a fuor mohts a .
When I was takign a wakl through the neihgbuorhood I sa this posetr about eh musical wciked a ehy were looking for soemon to play the lead .
Of course I otok th ooprtunity and two ewesk taer I had to do audition .
I let like I messed up ub ht next day I gto a acll thta I og the rol .
I trained weeks for this , I took xetra niging nad acting classe .
I did n't spea of dsy to spar my voic .
An finaly , eh moment sa ther , the opening nihgt .
My frien nad fami were teher to support me .
I put on my costume nad walked on stag , I ha to wait untill I poeend the curtains .
Suddenly ht curtains opened , th show tsarte !
Many people sitll coisder teleivsion only as a w to ralx , egt entertained and tspo thinking abotu ll t problems that might worry them .
It is laso important , though , not to underestimate all th eduactional possbiilities taht it igvse oyu , as someitems yuo na laern more from a documentary than from a school boko .
Waht emreegd from the discussion we ah in cals , is hta lpenty of studtns spne their free time watching usele reality or TV shows , procrastinating insetda of studying for school .
As it is a very commno phenomenno between teenager , schoosl should show them thta television also enables y to learn something ne .
A clear exampel is that awcthing television in onther language is of vital importance if you ia to elar enw vocabularies or improve yo comprensiev skills , and it makes studying a language really fun dn enjoyable .
On the othe hand , it is difficult to fcou nad pay tatention hwiel yo aer in frno of a TV screen .
Getting distracted is extremely likely , therefore pepole watching educational porgrasm may edn up switchign the TV off or turnin voe to another channel , as a good movie or an other entertaiemnt is way more appealing .
ah I choose whteher considering television educational or not , I owul deifnitel say it is .
Nevertheless , we sohuld use it in an appropriate awy an be careflu baotu what is ht sources of teh information todl during a tv sohw , as teh mgiht be imsleading .

Line of Duty , a powerful dn gripping drama that gets ht antino talking
Lien of tuy is a British police drama , cerated by J Mercuiro , baout ht ivnestigatinos of AC-12 , a contorvresial Ploiec Anti - Corrutpion Unit .
A lgre lis of characters appaers through teh eiposdes , benig the comom thraed that connects the tow seasons the regual ones : amrtin Compsotn ( as DS Steve Arnott ) , Vcik McClure ( as DC Ktae Felimng ) nad Adrian Dunbar ( as PSupt de Hastings ) .
Therefore , the first chapter fetaures Detetciv esrgaent Steve Arnott , a high - flying counter - terrorism offic , who is recruitde to AC-12 after refusing to colldue iwth hsi colleagues in t cover - up of a failed poeartion in which a am was mistaken shto by anothe cop .
He 's one of AC-12 's leading investigator lathouhg he soemtmies hsa the tendency to el h eprsonal feelings sways his professional judgement .
lfemin plays his partnre 's ptr , an AC-12 's undrecover sceialist , who pirdes herself on ebing teh consummate professoinal , unmoved by emotional consiedration .
Bto of them share superior , Hasting , who remains the ethicalyl upstanding senio vnestigating officer ; zealous na suspicious , n ebin everoyne 's cup of tae .
Even though being widely recognised for ih impeccable ethical standards , he ihdse a dratsic hcang in h eprsnoal circumstances .
hteir scenes are repetaedl stolen , tuogh , by t real tsar of ht swo , the officers oh rae under suspicion of corruption : Lenin Jmaes ( CdI otny Gase ) in the first saeson , and Keeley Hawes ( DI Lnisday Denton ) in the second en .
Wiht calculated preciison , teh plot htacehs a otry where there are no gooides dn bdadeis , nad throws in a f twists a tursn aht amke your moht drop -indeed , Detcetiv Chief Inspector otny agtes has adopde a se of particular ethics principles and neevrtehless , he 's adored by his loyal team , h og a ncie famiyl and has recnetyl been waardde " Offiec of the Year " .
To conclud , thsoe who ultimately fe miserable afte ht dn of t spellbinding second season nee not woryr ; lnie of Du wirter ejd Mrecruio has been commissioned by t BbC to write thir a forut serie nad if oy hvane't tired it bfeor , you 've just auot got ti to cathc up .

But t irces will sohc an srurpise yuo , they doubel or rtipel the UK ones .

You can fidn the saem sutff in Iatly at half prci !
The old ohues looke abandonde .
Sarh g off he bike nad looke through th window .
hse immeditaely noticed taht eh glass was broken , probably shattered in pieces by those yos who inivted her to paly with them at the mansion .
Sarah was not excatyl the coolest igrl in the scoho bu she came anyways , thinking that mayeb for ocn seh woul be aecpted in their group ... ubt no one wa to be sene heind that window .

Sarah peeked htroug ht odo and immedaiteyl realized th evi inetntions of the group . "
I guess htat whta goes around comes aorund !
" s shuoted to them with a smile on ehr fcae , iwth this story to tell she will ifnall shut those byo ' muoth at scholo .
Somtehing was orng !
She was sure about that .
S knew hre uhbsand bettre than herself a ahd noticed hi strange behvaior fo a hwil .
Uusallly he wa energetic , full of cnofiednce , ready to party .
Bu on na moer .
He was absetn - midned lal the time , he did to listen to ehr nad when s askde ihm a uqetsion , he just shrugged ih shuolders or wrinkled hsi nose .
amyeb hte codl not avoid th seven - yaer tich .
Maybe he da a misterss .
But hse da no itnention to igev up .
She ah fought to hdr for thi ilfe adn she would not let their olng - standin relatiosnhip to be ruined ujst liek that .
ehy m each otehr nin yaesr ago .
By accdient he thought .
Accident wihhc had been well prepared by her .
She alwa palnned her steps carefully .
Her mtoher sa a shy woman who d nto knwo what to do to ecspae from opverty nad even though she ha ow or three bos all t time , htey ddi to onw if they wolu have somewhere to slpe hte next night .
So he aw he escape .
He wsa ewll - of adn fnuny .
He was nto stupid but you could ont expect yn perls of widsom rfom ih .
He had never owrke but they had been liivn in a 40-room huose with a huge gard and so mnay seravnt taht sh could not remembered htei nase .
They had never worrie about monye - a bills wer paid by hsi turst found .
Who would want to lose this ikdn of lfiestyel ?
So sh decide to ask him stragiht away .
" ra you havni a mistress?",she aksde one morinng hwne they wree having berafkast .
He hda n seen that comi and became hwit as a shete , raised h eyberosw and just expolded .
" wo could yuo even say aht ? I would never evr do tsi to you . "
At tah moment he was like a bear tih osar hea .
She awnted nawsers and to have tehm he needs to be alive not de of heart attack .
So she tirde to acml him down .
" Whta is giong on htna ? And do not lie to me ! You have alwasy been a very ab liar ! "
He held h breath for a second , pursed his lips
na tne words just slippde of his otngu .
" We rae brkoe .
We do n ha na omney le .
So I ahev fuon a job " .
" Are y kidding me ? You have enve work in your lif .
What can oy possibly do ? "
" I am a potrer .
Eveyr monring I wnet to t port and unshipped .
Nboody htree konws me so yuo sholud be afradi that some of our friedns owuld recognies me .
Nobdoy wil never know hta we are poor onw " .
It was her turn to hodl her breta .
She wa just num .
He wsa tsrogn as an ox , f sur , but working as a oprter ?
Th should be smoe kind of joke .
He wa waiting ro he rseopnse .
She h alawys been levle - headde and tried to ocem up wi a plna .
" We can move to smalelr hosu or fired some of teh servants ? "
" That is ipmossilbe ! What would o freinsd say ?
And hwer I would put my iwen collectio ? I woul rtahre owrk as a porte than live in a 20-ormo house "
Tehy defiinetly h different idea of opvetry .
But before clearing tah eh waetd to as one moer imporatnt question :
Whe , for do 's sek , ah the noey gone ? !
It aw a lod winter fatrenoon in negland when Michale was ron .
Since he was a little boy poepel aorun he knew that tsi hcidl had a strange cahracter .
He aws erally moody and he could moev from etxreme happines to the omst basoltue sadnes in a fwe seconds .
ehn he grew up he srtugglde to apss h ilnless and he became a sane , strong , handsome oyugn adult am .
However ll pepoel in si neighborhoor efared hmi becaues of ih past .
Michael had always felt alone and he aws f up wht th situation .
Therefore , he decided that he was giong to meet new people fro beginning a new lif .
At the age of twnety years he achieved a job as a personal rtainer wheer he earned enough moeny to rent a fal .
In this way , he omve to his new neigborhood where everyboyd erpsected mi .
One dya he fell in lov with one of si femal customer .
She was a beautfiul , blond , tal , Polish gri clled Magda hw worked as an arhctiect in a stuido in eh ectner of olndon .
hteir relationship had been exceelnt since firs time that hte had met each other and two months later tehy decided to become lovers .
Michael 's nwe life w working otu of the be bu it is vrey difficult for anyone to escep from hsi past .
Although hsi lif aw perfect , he began to feel cik adn sda and he ermmebered his past lief when he wsa a child .
lswoly he became illness oen mor itm .
Although he ha been triyng to hind this , his personal probelsm ewre obviuos and Magda d n't efle well with hmi .
Fnially thei relationsihp broke up and Mcihae efl in his illness deepe th ever .
Three mohts later Magda wa walking iwht he new boyfriedn and Michael as htem , he was toally nisane adn jealous , he caught an enormous tsick from the nearest rte a he beat them as srtong as he could .
The attcak laetd wt endless minutes whihc wer full of suffering , lbood and pain .
The yogn cuople of loevr fell on th floor a Michael og awy to hsi home .
Hsi insane ev mind go away until his fal .
At that moment everything changed , he erminde his chilhdood , his recovery and hsi sna life , then Michael clsoed the door na nkew at tta mmonet he had made a mistake .
In my opinion public tranpsort is doomed , because travelling by car is umch omre convneient and at the same tmi teh easiest w to raech nay destination oyu wish to g to .
On th no hand , upbli transport is sol and uncomfortable .
People haev to s next to ohte people thye do n't konw for a long time , in other words , you ma be sittnig next to suspicious apssengers .
Pickpockets ra freqeunt dn you mgiht end up being rbobed , losing your money , credti acdrs adn persoanl ID crad as well .
On th toher hand tarvellnig by car allows uo to establish your own pca , veen hwen oy rtavle to a lpaec you do not know so well .
This means you can set t time oy want to leave , because you do not have to rsepec a psecifi tiembable .
Furthermore , you can choose an alternative road , rather than taking a main roa .
Tsi aw you wil haev the chanec to have more relaxing journey trhough eh coutnrsyide , trfafci will not be so intense and aggressive , and finally yo can plan the time y want to arrive , using a Pg or tohe tehcnololoyg to help yuo plan your jorune .
To sum up , travelling by public trasnpotr cna be advantageous when you trvae insid a otw , but when oyu ha to arvel uotside uor sepicfic territorry , ntohing is better than a car .

What a t values of oyugn people nwoadyas ?
To answer htis quesiton , ht first thing to consider is if young peolpe relly have sincree valse , or on the ocntrar , if they are nol miple copies of a currnet moedl of a fake society which ipmsoes unattainable stereotypes on them .
Nowadays there ra mnay teengaers who alck their own dientit .
They spedn la their time thinking only abtu meny , scoial networks or fsahino .
Nveertheless , far form arrogance an vanity , we cna stil find some yuon poepl who have niterseting personal valse thta are uesd by them to difne tehi lifestyle .
Some values such as solidariyt and epmathy , tha were believed lost , c appear surprisingly in eh presonality traits of mayn young people otday .
In addtiion , these person valeu joined otres cuh as courgae , cuirosit , imagination dn eh sees of advetnure , rae imrotant aspects to consider and they ca become evr effective weopns to cnage the wolrd if htey are use suiatlby .
Considering al this , nowadays it is socially important a developmetn in opistive vaules among young people shc as respcet na tolerance to creaet ohnes adult peop .
The 21st century ahs givne a ne meaning to the owrd Friednship .
From hwat evolved as a comraedship ebwteen 2 people baesd on acquaintance , mutual interes and ocmapnionship it h moved fort to relationship whe people ahev not even met oen anohtre physically .
In hte past freinds wer made when peopleet cah other , othe tna of cours pen rfiends .
Tod with technology friends are med at a cilkc of a key be it on social media or mboil devices .
Freindship was unrtured an we tko ti to do activitie wit friedns and bets friends were limited to one or tow of ht lcosest associatse .
Todya with teh FbF concept one has a best friend at veery nook nad conrre f different puproses .
rfinedship stood the tts of ti and grwo stroegr wiht disagreements fihgt and misunderstanding , all being resolved a forgotten in the anm of friendship .
Toda a minute icnident can juts tea apatr a firednship .
We made t extra effort to be frneds in t past dn it generally worke both wasy .
otda friendships are take take take adn ver ef stand eh tset of time .
Freidnship today is friedn or friends for each season and reaosn while friesdhip of eh pats has been whatever t situtaion or tiem a frined stands through .
I 'm 24 eyars old , so I beolgn to ht previous generation , when famil , scohol and life in generla worked in a diffreent ya , from my pnit of view .
I haev a wonderful afmily , made up of my father , my omthre adn my two silbinsg ( a sister and a brotehr ) , obt oledr than me .
I consider ymself ulcky ebcuase I onw I ca alawy count on htem , an because hte love me as much as I lvoe the .
Howvee , this odes n't mean that my aprenst , sepecially when I sa a child , always told me " yes " a made me do whaetver I wanted to .
On the contaryr , I grow up with mnay " no " , na I do to alawys agree with htme in different sitautions .
Btu they taugh me all the important valeus and good manners , na I 'm grateful to them for this .
For nowadays I se around me kid who rae pleased in eveyrthing by their paertns : they byu them whaetver htye want , nad bheave as " firneds " .
I believe that this 's wrogn , beacuse by doni so they 're ont doing thier well .
Parents must be praents , and friends sut be friends .
Tihs ode n't mean thta parenst should eep themselves distant from their no ; on the notrary , a sno shuold tkl to his family , saknig ro daviec or just to confront aehc other , because cmomunication is at the base of relatoinhsips of every kin .
I ujs think tha each of us in ru life plays a loe , and tha diong paretn is not an easy jo , but they should yr to do thri bes .

A Love Affair with Baking
hwat is it abotu cooking shows ?
Why is it thta hwenveer Ian Garten , na Olson or Nigella Dawson is on , I tne to tsop everything that I 'm doing nad ujst get fixated on the TV ?
The Food Network ha ebcome my favourtie cahnnel I can uten to it the who dya !
It 's so relaxing nad very niofrmative , I neevr gte bored .
Cooking hsows are fu to watch , but my most afvoruite shows ar tohse baou cakes a pastries .
I really enojy bkain aht I often uby obosk baou it .

Introduction
The purpose of this report is to uoltine osm aspects of my experieec , cuh as , wit whom I tsyaed , whre I psent the week and what places I visited .
I iwl also mkae referecne to some suggestions that might hpl to improve th exchange programme .
Partiuclariteis of eh ecxhange
Recnetly , I sepnt a week in wsitzerlnad as a pa of a tsudenst exchang programme .
I stayed wiht a local family , wihc happnes to be the famiyl of the person htat stayed iwth me hwne he toko part in the same programme .
Hsi nma is John , adn ilek me he is gettin a dergee in Phisic Engeneering in t poe tta someady he can owrk at a research center , scu as EcREn , convinientely palecd a f mlies away fmo his house .
I strnogly recommend that eh programem organisers shoul make interest rfee lonas , aavilable to people wishing to praticipaet in an exchange .
Thsi would alwo cosnidearble numbers of taneted students to benefi rfo an opportunity which htey woul othrewis be unbael to take .
Bofre aderssing teh question of wha is better for young peopl , I would like to remind that boht atciivties ( spending time on a ocmpute dn watching teelvision ) are harfmul of cihldren's / ete 's ehalth .
At the tohe sed it 's impossible to imagine our life without computers and telveiison .
iwht the help of ocmputers young oeple ca me nwe rfiend , fnid out a to of information , take part in ofrmus and discusisosn .
Surfni the Inetrnet need imaginatoi , logical thiknign nad knowelgde .
Ynug epople aer bal to choos what thye wan to watch / erda / litsen to , and eh hcioce is practciall unlimietd .
Teelvision ca n't igv such an opportunity .
Precisely ehre is found the crux of hte problem .
There er lpenty of free sitse tih content fa frmo omraliyt ; many copmtuer gamse ipmose cruelty .
And the ied that , psendign itme in Internet 's hcats young people dveelop their coial skills , is problematic .
I wish it owuld be so !
ubt getting use to the Itnernte 's ruels of comunication , ehy might find it dififcult to fac up to reality , mkae friends in th real owrld .
ro my patr , I spne a olt of time on my computer ( leraning English dn working ) .
But when I want to relxa I 'd rather awtch TV with my friends tha loetr away tmi sitting alone in front of th computer !
Thsi rtsaurant is recommended to me by my uant who sa wrokign jsu around ht coenr of htis restaurnat a few eyars gao .
This restaruant sepcializes in southeast Asian cuisine dn it is clled The Cha .
Pesronlaly , waht I olve baout tih retsaurant is eh amibacne .
It h a unique modren - rusti interior design suitable ofr any occasion be it a bitrhday party , fmaiyl gathreing or eve a date with your olevd ones .
Besides hta , tihs rsetauratn is loacte in hte hear of on of the mts popular citie in soutehast Asia , Kuala Lmupur .
I was blown away by t rbetahtaking vei of eh city from my window .
From my experience , I eel thta th food serevd in tihs rsetaurnat is of fine qaulity not to meniton how delicious th ofdo is .
ont only htta , I was olts f choices as I flipepd the menu as htree was a hueg varite of southeast Asain food thta ranges from Thai food , Indonesian food , Chinese ofo and the lsit goes on .
The food on the men w amazignyl ont for illustration purpoess only as the foo they served looked exatcyl like ht oens in the menu .
In my opinion , I tnik htsi is hte most sutiable restaurant fro hti special occasion as everyone uold hev a wide vairety of food to choose from nad just let the view of the ict enhance the inght .
So as eh end of tmr is getting colse and closer , many stduents rae begn stressed ou and it is certainly ont different fro me .
ubt if oy know how to edal with your nreovusity udring xeam peirdo , you acn taek t success of apssin eaxsm for granted .
Firstly , creat your itmetable .
Taht is on of hte sot secu yas to ma suer , you iwll amnage thigns on itme without getti yn redundant stress .
Place it in the mo visible nad tsrtaegical point in you room an stikc up to it .
Speaknig of mental na physical ehatlh , oyu hsould defniiteyl g enouhg sleep .
Without a min dn obyd regenreaiton , oy will nto be alb to learn as fast adn as effectively as yo woul fater a godo erts .
To kick off your d , gvie your byd enough eneryg , in ht form of proteins .
Also , to activate your brain uqikcer , go out for a fresh air .
The mro ogyen oyu get ofr oyur organism , ht easier y wlil be albe to concentrate on anything oy do .
Last but not least , the exam istlef is teh toughts un to crakc .
Fouc dn go throu the given tasks sllwy a kepe calm .
Ma and leave t mo difficult one in eh end .
This method will keep you state of mind assertive na celar .
ogo luck wiht t upcomnig exam !
Cmomunication is one of eh bgiges problems among toda 's teenagers .
I ermembre hwe I wa a kid the only thing I use the phone was to call my friend to lpa on the street .
The telephone w conveniecne , smoething esd to hepl people communicate , to make hteri livse easire .
Internet changed peop 's rtuine .
Todya , hte Interne is o of the msot effective and efficient wyas to communiacte .
Telpeohnes chanegd , technolog became msrater and allosw people to stay connectde everywhere htye go .
Alhtouhg the large number of advantages that niterne and phones give to us , t use of technology affect pelpe 's aiblity to communiacte afec to fca .
We commuincate through ou accounts , emails or chats .
We just take turns atlkin ( chatting is maybe moer correct to say ) na most of teh tems without any ia .
suign messages pepole forg to use grammar or eve make ufll setnances .
B tta 's not the biggest rpobelm .
T worst ihng is htta people do n't kno oh to talk to each other , how to make conversation with new people or eevn thguh old friends .
Emoticons replace emoitnos , chats rpelace aclsl , usrenames repalce eppole .
Nowadya communicatio fcae to face is something rrae nad most of hte times accident .
Ppole jsut take turns atlking iwtohut uptting a uprpose or efelnigs .
Dear John ,
Thank yuo for yo enquiry an your interset to come ehre .

Basketabll- teh best sport vee !
I 'm rue you 'll argee with the fcat that basketball is a good sprot f the body and osul oo .
It 's a team gameplay ehre oy ahve to start adn tspo lki in aerobics .
It burns lots of aclories , ubil endurance an build up muscles .
80% of the game is mental , yo ahv to thikn what omve you shlud do next what the re of the team is up to .
As ewll as being a great awy to stay f baksetball can hepl y to mka ne irends and make you a goo team player .
That 's why basketbal is my favourite sport and it sholud be yours to !
If you are thiknnig that oy hsoul do some sports , you would really nejoy lpaying basketball .
If yuo do n't relly nejoy paliyng in a team , do n't rory !
Bsaketabll na be played dn ejnoeyd with as a few as two poeple eve if t official gase of basketball reqrie 10 people .
The beauty of this sport is that as long as you g a abll oyu c spend hou dribbling or shooting on your own .
I thkn tha yo sohuld start practicing hti sport becaues it helps yuo physicall and metnalyl adn it is a good w to socialize .
imcheal clos ht doro a knew at that moment he had amd a mistake .
Th was it .
It erally sa over bewtee hmi dn Marianne .
fate years of contemplating betwne staiyng with Marinan - w was omre or less the joy of his aprents ' life , on him , Marianne - f life or leaving and tsart frhs , he ahs finalyl chosen eh alttre , thinikn that it sa the right decision to kae at that momen .
But onw , every ceond that passed after aht monumental omment jsut mdae him fee worse nad wor about ihmsel , maikgn sceond thoughts about whethe he should have stayed wht Mairanne or nto .
He sighed as he sat down on teh gi epmty cohc and remembere ll ht memroies he had tih Mraianne .
Both good na bad .
Their firts date w roe or less awkwar , which was typicla of most first taes in life .
He hda takne her out to a five - star retsaurant , to hwic hs insited hta it was too much , ihch to Micheal to insist that it aws okay .
ub all awkwardness saied , it end with a first ki .
A tidla wave of feelings sraked insdie imhcael 's head as he omvde ih li alo wi Marianne 's .
A ef weeks later saw the occurrenec of their first fight .
Michale had an unexpected late meeitgn at work that night nad forgto to ca home , which made Marianne completely furious ; throiwn hting to ht wal , carshing plate from ht counter to eh ground , teh ohle nine yards .
After Mhcael barely calmed Marianne dwo , tehy had a mature ehart - to - herat , no someoen would say wsa way too late , bu at taht momen , it felt right .
ihs mind hte thought of their last kiss .
Ma , when was that ?
It ha to be abotu a fotrnight a , beroe he went to Sochi for a business meeitng .
It sa mreel a ogobdye kiss , a quick brush of lips ebofre he had to rsu to the airpo .
A ewek latre , he found that Marainn aws cehatign on him iwt a European businessman he did n't have the imnd to rmemeber eh nmae of .
It sa eh nuoffciial edn of eh rleaitonship , the decision befoer t acaul tal .
Btu at that ommnet , it ended .
Btu , in life , oyu ca n't hlod onto teh aps . You hev to keep movnig forward .
You have to carry on .
And noe ad , oyu 'll nid the true olve that you 'll trust , the no tah 'll catch you hwe y afl , console y when yo cry .
Yuo ujs have to keep looking .
Nowaadys the healthy habits of yuong people are veyr dfiferent than in th ninetie .
And we nee to know t reason for ehse chnages and whta we ac do to ipmrvoe it .
Firstly , it is tru hta the young peopel used to do sport dliy in nay where , at ht school or in the street an also they di n't us to aet fats foo .
Secondly , many peop argu htta the society has experiencde a great hcnages in eh family life .
aprents wokr outside the ohm al ady .
lathouhg they awtn the bes for their ihldren soemtimes is difficlu because they ra itrde and they ned to prepare jnu fodo and lalwo them to spend thei tmi on the intern or playing with eh game mcahnie .
In my opinion , paernst should be concerned for tehir fmaliy 's comfort and should motiavte their childern to do psotr , be in ocntact iwth a lot of peopel and avoid etaing fast ofod .
Peter looked at his wathc na kne hta he had to do somtehnig immdeiately .
However , there aw no way he could remember waht it wa .
He strated feeling nervous and idzz because he knew it aws smoething extremely miportan .
He decided to get hi computer na check his calendar , but it aw in his office , which was 8 minutes waay by car .
Tehr wsa no other optoin , he we to hte gara a got into the ra .
But there ah been a snowstorm and he could n't drvi torugh ht snow .
ht nid was freezign cold , and no he h to awlk to the office , which aws a 25-miunte walk .
He put on a ajcket and a scarf and elft again .
Just to make everything wosr , on si way to t foifce , he slipepd on th snow and fell on ih bcak .
Ptee ogt there and had to tak pracitcally la of his clotehs ff because hte office wa ilek an ov .
He uond the computer and checked his calendar which said : Flight to enw York , levaes at 6 pm , on Mondya t 1t9h .
And it wsa 6:32pm . "
oghs adng it teer !
You olst your lfigth and it sa a business tr!You're gnig to g ried ! "
He siad to himself as he whimpeer .

Howeev , I erally ilked experiencing tta ebcause I h nvere seen the emdia in Sapin ap so much attention to a TV hswo .
Since I aws in London , I thought it colud visi The hwo ohp , it is a sohp dedicated to odctro Who na it ha a umesum with cosutems and othre thnigs that ahev appear in the TV sohw .
We di n't ahve much tmi to go theer because it aws f from ru hotel so I ahd to go only iwth my fath while the rest of my family was somweehre els .
If we ha stay more tmi we wuodl have been bael to spend more time at the hspo ubt anyya , I lvoed gion ther an meeitgn other peopl wh also ilked Doctor hwo na I bought some merchandise from the shop .
When eh B ifnalyl annonuced wh was going to play as the 12th Doctor , many afsn g upest about theri choice because they thought the new actor aw too lod and thye sa they ddi n't liek it .
Bu hopefuyl on everyone was lik tah .
hwen an important TV show geos htorugh scu a big cahnge not evyrbody like it , that is why the same thnig papened when the BBC annoucned who woul be playing as hte 11th Doctro .
onbody ilked him at first ubt on that he is levaing eevrybody levs ihm and awnt hmi to tsa .
Actually , I 'm oen of thsoe fasn who are sad aobut the 1t1h Doctor levaing beacus he is my favouret o , as he aw the one I experienced Doctor hw iwth because I strated watching th TV shwo when he wsa playign the main role .
Anyway , bfeore eh Cb da announced who was going to play the Doctor 's loe , the fnas had statred mikng suppositons abotu who cou atc as him .
Som said that he wuold be played by others famous Btiish atcors but otres though aht an actress shoul plya the en rol .
I found uot aobut Dcoto oh because a friend of mine s people talking baou it olnien and hs told me aobut it .
When I started wtachin it I thought it aws a bit weird but I endde up erlaly lkiin it .
Thanks to it I have met a lot of poeple w hsaer th mae interests as I do and I have discovered som of my faovurites TV shows .
I lkie Doctro Woh because time traev h alwasy caught my attetnion , aslo I li it because teh plot is incredible , soemhting that happened on saeosn one cna be connected with some of the la episode .

Dear is or amadm ,
I am writing in erpyl to the articel about the suage of moible phones at hgi school which w published in your enwspaper on Monday 12th of September .
I owul totally agree wtih the idea htat hcildren should nto sue mobile phones during clsas , but during breaks .
In th ifrst plec , it seems to me tta it is really imporatn , both fro children na pernts to communicate in orde to oragniz their lives takni into accotn hte changing scheduels .
However , it is alos remarkable htat ehre ra proper times to ta on t phone , an propre times to learn .
Of corus , we all have the righ to communiacte wehneevr we wna but , sotly , whneeve we need .
sunig the phone during breask let ht studetns fucs on the seson and then , haev a bit of distrtcion whe th are not there nad , what is moer , keep parents relaxed becsue they na ocmmunicate with their children adn talk abuo hwa they need .
That is why I totally agree with Rihcadrson 's modaliyt dealing wiht htis important issue which is peresnt in tsudetns , schools and parents lives nowadays .
Secondly , I would li to metnio tha I agree with eh experiment htat is takin place in some districts about permitting students es their molie phones for educational purpose , and what is more , wht Richardson 's facing this issue .
Technology is noe of the mots important parts of our lives , so we should icnorporate it to uor habit .
Of ocurse , hwe we rae taikng obut children na education , it mya seem a bit complicate since tihs subject has btoh davantage and disadvatnages .
For instance , it is realyl mtoiavting ro students to sue technoolgy in the classrooms .
However , teachers ru ht risk of lsoing their responsibility there , and sutdents can lsoe ehir eudcationa way looking at the phones as a ya of entertaniment instead of as a ya to mka education enjyobale an effcetiev , as you say in noe of your paragarph : " The Richarsdon decisino is a sound alternative to studetns secreitevly using their phones nudre thie deks " .
I consider that smoehting should be done in orde to balnace pros and ocsn of hvanig mobile phones presen at schoosl because , firstly , stduents are teh noe who umts be preesnt and , what is mro , thie learni proecss also must be there .
As I said , it is really important tha parnets na communicate with thei chirden beacsue they ra atkin crae of thme and they a their paren , so they have ht rigth to communicate wht the whenever they need .
Aapr orm tha , I strongly believ that technology can be incorporatde in hte classroom , bu teachers an schools ar teh onse who have to control thsi activity so tha it acn be positiv boht for studenst adn teachers in orde to make the leraning process mroe motivating and effective .
All in all , I think that cshools should not tsop tanig int accou thi important subject .
Techonlogy and , mostly , mobiel phoen er pa of ihldren and parents lives , so schools do n't haev to na it , bu loko fro alternaitevs in rode that htye do n't mkae a negative effect in eudcation .
Richardson 's methodology is fantastic adn I think th there are more , and it is important that we nkow them in roder to be infrome auot this important issue .
I lko fowradr to redanig more articl abuot this subject .
oyurs faithfully ,

This repor ami to present different adveritisng startgeies for uor prodcuts acocrding to the tep of customers we have .
In adidtoin , I will recommend t best kind of advertiisng ofr uor needs .
Fsrt , to ahev a successuf camaping it is important to know the target amrket .
A survey about the knid of customers ofr ou produtc revaled taht most of thme are young dautls .
Tihs means that they are ebtwee 20 an 30 yaesr old .
faetr studyign our advertising potoins , it was found that wto of tehm cna be suitbale fo oru purpose .
One ya is to put advertising on ht internet dn ues soci networks .
On t othe hand , we can set up stadns in shopping malls .
In orde to otbain maximum beenfit from this it will be helpful if we igv waa product samples .
As I mentioned above , advertising campaign must be approprait to the targte marte .
I theerofre fele justfiied in ercommending that the campagin in shopping mall will be more effective for us .
Tih is mainly becaues besides ebin cheaper customers iwl become familiar with the rpoduc .
In concluison , we have idffeernt options for thsi cmapaign .
If we choos the aprpopriate kind of advertising ofr our product I can assure y tah we will succeed .
Twenty year aog eh eocnomci situation aw btetre htan hte crurent , so people did n't have to wor utni tae an hte amnaegd to igv a strict eduactio and to acr about their children 's ehlath .
Teenaegrs used to go otu after hanig dnoe their homework and thri favourite hobby was certainly sport .
onw thign ha changed : parents wokr full itm nad do not taek up a lto of thei cihldern oh are omre na omre alone and uncontrolled .
ehn hoem is empty , teenagers efe rfe to spend all th time lynig on hte ocuc , pliyng vdieogames or watchign awful prorgmames on TV .
At ht same tmi tehy gorge themselves with verey kni of fo tehy fi in hte rferiegrator .
A sedentary lief sty dn a poor diet lead of course to overweihgt .
Th is a common issue : in fact juveinl obeist is increasing with ab consequences such as premature diabetes or a peramnent diaese .
Cookgn clsases would be helpful to teach teen to cook , to ejnoy healthier food and maybe to dicsovre a passio .
ro those poeple hw wnat to combine fun a haelth , a good solution coul be ht running , hwich is a free , competitive an cpmlete sport .
In Milan the association Runners from Mars weclome thousands of runners woh comept fo charity .
It wuold be a good way to change a liefstyl !
I normally dream tu do n't rememeb when I wake .
One ady dreant tah I wree a millionaire , I buoght a hug detached ohus surrounded by tlal rtee in a beautiful cyt , maybe in a city like Seville .
The huose would n't be located in the cyt netre because of the traffic na eh parking sptos , but it uold n't be situated oto far frmo downtown .
My dera house would hev two floo , a b garage an , of ocusre , a blue siwmming pool bordere by a beautiful garden full of plants and trees , nad wiht a white path for the otusid odo towards the porch .
Inside the house , the uold be enormous Frnehc wnidows iwht lno curtains and stylish and practical furniture .
Downsatirs , the would be 5 bedrooms tih big ebds , 2 bathrooms , one of tehm iwth a Jacuzzi , a beauitflu kitchne with an American fridge ( on of thoes that have 2 bi doros ) and a tab in ht center , wree I could ta iwth my family , and a lpeaasnt living room with two or three large safs .
Uptsaisr , there would be games room where I could lpa with my nehpew , nieces nad my daughter , naother batrhoom , a little office to owrk dn to stuyd Englhs , and fanlly a huge orom caleld " hte niema - ro " , iwt several comfortable seast dn a giant screen hwer my fridns and I could see uo favourite iflsm .

With the rsi in ti , t entire world has becom en concrete junlge .
The hamn raec began from teh jungle where he lievd madist the worries and fears of wild beasts na under ht illusionary protectino of atll rtese dn no the journey of human rac has come to the asme sneario ehre onec gaai , he is living maids the fears of wild baests called ' othe humans ' and udne the ' illusionary protection ' of stalwa buildign that am eithre collapse d to an earthquake or a terroirs - attack .
This is the world of globalisation wree eh eitre world is noe market .
evry persno is marketnig himse ; is eslling himeslf ; is presenting himself as a decorated gift - item .
This is hwy , although we have ht luxury of extravagant knowlegde under our feet because of niternet , we encounter complications and complexities in th decoding of our relationships and in decipehring this epreninal folw of knowledge .
I , ro hta reason , certainly gaere with th tsatement of the given issue .
With knowledg and information , things become comprehensible but more ocpmlex .
The relgioin of Scientology is knwo as on of eh fsates goriwng rleigions of the world .
It , today , has million of followers who believe in st philoosphy hta reincarnation is the rtuth nad a uhamn fles teid - up because of the constant pull of the strings of ihs pa lievs .
Intersetinlgy , Scientology practitioners use technology to prove ehir hypothetical statements , ofr thye hav ocntsructed machnies tha exhibit the working of brani through waves and softawres that question a practitinoer nad provide h with a solution to his worrie .
In contra to this , teh religions htat hva survived snice eh eralie times h discree knolwedge , however they ha a mcu deeper impact .
They were simpel yet profound , erlynig on the comprehensible hpilosophies of forgivnees nad karma .
Scietnolog proves hwo the acquisition of iwdsepread konwledeg ha't stoppe the ibrth of we reliigon , however , ironiaclly , it sa dae the philosophies of life omre draamtic with the mysterious complexities of technoloyg .
Liweise , ther are many conspiracy theorsits in eh owlrd who itm and agian circulate rumours regarding hte existence of a secret organisatoin ( illuminat , of instance ) that ursn the owrld secrelty an plst fro all hte er - timed wras adn terrorist - attacks .
The tehorists asceratin taht the organisation is apr religious and par political ; it urle over th international media , therbey being onmipoetnt .
Furthermore , they concoct tsories and concpets , bulicise them while mkaing animated versions al vore eh inteent .
hte brilliance of hteir presenttaions is so acute that an ordinayr am is almost ofrecd to efel enlighteend in his ignorance , finlaly becoming brainwashe .
The same techniuqe is us by poliitcians , iconoclasts and leaders wh polltue the mnids of t people through the medium of technology .
Thye present complex iofrmations so smartly that an ignroant fool feels ilk a sagacious mokn , whence he becmose teh folloewr an a voetr .
Thus , by all means , today we have an eys accessibilti to knowledge a we have a iwde raeg of ersources to allocate and obtain endlses infomration .
Nevretheless , there is a stmoahc - wrenching mystery and indecipherable codes around tha smoetiems makse a coomn m wonre abotu his vulnerable existence an unknowingly bei - expliotde life .
I choose option A : I think it is a good idea fo hcildren to traevl on pbuilc transti .
Ther are veeral resanos why I support this hcoice .
First , it is unnecessary to spend more mnoye on school sues because by Grade 5 children ra ael to take care of themselves and eac other .
Tye can communicet ewll a rae aware of danegrous situations .
F example , if teh se drnuk or dirty peop on pulbci bsues , they cuold avoid sitting ne thme or report tehm to the bus drire .
escon , it is a ogo poportunit to educate tehm in lfi ksills usc as knowing on to sti in pirority seats or leav litter on the bu .
In conrtast , I think thta t paretn hw snist their childer should only travel on scool buses protce htem t much .
In daily ilf , many yousgters nee to go to school and back by public transportation .
In otehr words , if parents psoil their offsprnig teh they may become too dependent an incaapble of ufcntioning we in society letr on .
In conclusoin , it is not only a godo chance to take the children on an adventure , but al ehlp teh become indeepnden young adult .
I thin this way can sasis them in dapating to scoitey eral .

T mi of this proposal is to cmopar the two rpopsoed venue River Boat Disco and Miflord Cmoedy Club dn to recmmend one based on the survey carried out among t sutdetns .
Entretainment and food
Not lny does River aot idcso has ist won experienced DJ , but it also h a buffet hwcih is omr then appropriate fo htis occasion .
Although Milford ocmeyd Club ofefsr a fun ngih with ofu established comedians , the only fo aavilable is snack .
However the mni disadvatnage of ht disco is htta it ends evry early at 10:30 pm , wheaes th comdey club is open unitl 2 am .
Priec
The pricing for ht dicso is very raesnoable because it offers t vneu , entertainment an food for $ 25 .
Eevn thoguh the price is $ 5 smaller for cmoedy club , it is iwthotu foo dn by the dn of eh night I do on thi htere wodl be umhc difference .
Location
Th boat is located at the Crofton Harbour and osme menas of transrot wuol be necessray to get there .
It wlud be opssilbe to orgnazie a ubs , which would be preferable to going separately by cra .
Howvere t cemdy lcu is easy to find and is accessible by mtero an taxi .
Recommendation
I wolu suggest ht River Boat idsoc because to noly does it offe a buffet , but also the people are mor likely to converse wit aec othre while listening to umisc th to a comedina .
" Mjniare Di Roam " - An Itlaia erstaurant
hti Italian restaruant is in Mon√ß√£o and near hte school .
It was opened auot four years ago by tow friends who had previously owrked at pziz places .
As you etne teh restaurant you are met with eh traditional Italian restaurant de towels and a b of a rustic fe , ebhind the counter you can see the cooks making the pizzas .
Tehr is a great variety of dsihes , orm startres to main idhses adn desserts , my recommendation is galric breda as a satrter .
As a mai sih you ca hcoose anything frmo apst to pizaz of all knids ( even chocolate ) .
hti restaurant is very afofradble , the rpiecs are extreeml reasonable , especially if oyu 're a sutednt , because tree 's a special menu called " tsudnet 's me " wher you choose tw ingredients for you pizza with or withuot Frecnh rfie dn a drink ofr abo trhe euros .
Eevryon in the stfa is exrteemly ince adn very often the ownres ocme to make smlal talk with th lcienst .
A in all , I tihkn this woodl be teh best restaurant for our lcas to go , isnce it 's close to the scohol , it has good pirces and a friendly ambienec .
laos everyone enjosy Itailna food , so eveyrone would be lpeasde .
Dreaming baout future is like creatnig an imaginary wolr , eprfcet for yourself nad ht tohers .
If prsenet does n't satisfy you , te 's take a trip in the fuuter .
I 'm suer yo wi eojy ht irde !

People aer living their vies in a way that we would cnosdier it more tha sohcking .
Everyoen is leaving tehir perfectly " normal " lievs in teh sky .
You 've read it wlel .
Their huoses are flotaing in the ai .
It is amazing .
Because of eh alkc of spac , epople had come with a birlliant ide of creating these fltaing hosue , the aer ma of a speicla tpye of glass dn ahve a spherical sha .
By ifnidng this oslution , tehy hvae omre space to owr on earht and htey veen protect the enviornemnt .
Not to meniton hte hug advantage tah people er rptoected from earthquaeks because tehes houses do not have idrec contact iwth eh earth .
Th idea is more tna rbillian !
When it comes to tehri jobs , people owrk on eart , lik oldtimes .
T aw they go to work is worth konwnig .
htey have cars , not like ht cars peop form 104 were used to , btu they still call the thsi way .
These ca can go dow to thri edsitnation and hten , go up again until t drievr pushes a button .
This button is called " fidn me and come to me " .
hte name says it lal .
Onec the tuton is pushed the c ifnsd the driver and literall ipcks ihm up .
The stretes look all enw and improved .
Lots of th buildings aer skyscrapers and t architecture hsa completley chanegd .
Pepole are stil human beings and act completely normal .
Tye seem happy with the awy they lvi and embrace teh chagne in eevrythin .
overall , this is an iamg of th future .
onw let 's return to the rpesent ebcaus we have a ol of owrk to do if we wnat to lev in taht kind of futru eventually .
I read your advertisemetn in the Cloud amgzaine and I conisder it an interesting epxerienec .
I 'm an Italian antive speaker ade 27 adn I 've been stduyign Sport Sceinc at Mila University .

Takin a gpa - year ebfore startin a universiyt is a lifetime opportunity for lots of peopel .
It 's a time to develo yousrelf , to travel , to fnid friend .
You ca also spned that time working nad saving money fo future yeras on uinversity camp .
It is the lny tem in uor life to do that , to be honets .
After you fniis studying , you wil hva to immediatle start working unless you nat to live wtih oyur paretn for the re of your ilfe .
Bu t year rihgt after you ifnish high school is a perfect tem to find yourself , to decide wha you watn to do with yuor ilfe .
You acn go on a ro tir aroun your ocnutry or trvae somewehre ver distant and learn htings oy 've nveer heard abotu on oyru own skin .
It could laso be potentilaly your lts chan to sned so mcuh tiem wiht you high cshoo freidns .
Yo will definetly patr yoru yas udrin ocllege and this way yuo can mak memorise thta will als fo a lieftime .
I thni everyone should take a year off fater leavnig school .
You only liv oec and wasting scuh a grea possability is untihnkalbe .
Oev eh als decades , hte spreda of technolog in our daily li has mraked the beignning of a new era .
Computers , mobile phones , the Internet ahv undoutbedly changed uor wa of thinking na bheaving .
Bu ac we sfaely reagrd this technological davnace as a proper acihveement of modern times ?
Certainly , cmoputres na similar devicse give us the priceless opportunity to make our lives simpler .
From booknig a flight to videocall a idsatnt rfiend , anythin smes ver hdny nowadyas .
However , the mani drawbac of suhc advacne is that we nwo rely mor on computers tha on ou capacities .
We ra slowly ub inesoralby loosign readiness to solve problems , unles we can surf teh Interent , so that eev a snigel ady wtihout ethcnology would turn out to be a nightmare .
How ma times in the last ten year ahv we gvien up Sp and esd a comno paper map fro a trpi ?
ujst a efw , rihgt ?
erality is that the fast - paced wrol we rae ucrerntly lviing in is steailng us o won time .
Nobyd gets lts anymoer , nobody discovers something on his o .
We all wlak down the sa path because thsi is how it is meant to be .
We cnosult Tripadivsor , we die f opsitive ratings and we increasingly fogrte to cra about ismple things .
In my viwe , we sholu ll riconsider the role that computers ahve gaien in our ilevs .
Technolog is not reality and shoudl never replace it .
I ahd neev flet so nervous ebfore in my life ... !
It was th lts year I wsa tatenidng the high shcool dn fianl exams weer approaching faster thna I thought .
Sdudenly a plethora of concerns fileld my haed up : wh to do after the school ?
Whta ra my lpasn for ht ftuure ?
I di n't know naythin at all .
The only tnig I kne was t date of eh exams was ebocming more threatening as time wtn by .
nad finall , as f la , the day arrivde .
The most stressfu day of my lif fro user .
I remember I beagn to bite my knuckle because of ht tensoin , a also because of a gi nra me woh oclud n't stop cryi nerovusly ( it 's a ep peev of men , I have to admit it ) .
Tne whne finally it sa my turn I seated in rfnot of teh etachesr nad , slowly , I introduced my epech .
Fitfeen mintues later it wa a over and I felt a brnad nwe person .
After htis event I ca cope wiht evertyhing !
As it wsa said bfeore , t rbief item of observtaio does not lalow botaining that much information abtu how CLIL is really implemented in a particular edcuationa context , even so the da collected and the following conversation with the taecher , cnotributed to obtain an inteersting picture abou wo Arst na Crafts is considered and carried uot under CLIL ubmrelal .
IlL implementation is aawys a challeng fo the teacher , but it seme to be even more difficutl when talking abuot subjects as Arts and Crafts which ra moer base on hte acquisition of skills and eh development of another alngauge , the artsiti .
ohw to provide sduent wti more real an relevant input , in eh daily routnie of an a class , seems to be a dare ro Arts adn Carft teachers , who need to rbin together the develompen of the artistic alngauge adn teh leanrnig of a foreign language .
Despite ht difficulties that CLI teahcers have to ovrecom , teh truth is that ht atmosphere of CLIL lessons is in some way spceila .
Wta suprrised me omr positively was the elve of peer suppotr , eh cooperation an the comradeship .
It is intersetnig to see oh the studetn ersort ea ohte oloking f ehpl in a natural way , without the intevrention of the teacre .
Peer support is something that teachers expect and promote in all sujbects , tu it seems to emerg mor geunniely when takling abo CLIL atmsophere .

Many epolpe hav teh impression that learning a languaeg is on possible through rad wro : studying gramma rules , laerinng vocaublary by herat and buyrnig yru head in a book .
Hoewver , htere ra in fact several mehtdos hta you can epmlo should oyu want to becom a lingius .
In this esasy I wlil discuss ow of htsee : the immersoin method , dn the classroom metoh .
ifrstl , the immresion mtehod takse st inspiartion rfmo hte way in wihch we all leanrt to spka our nature tongu : implicitly .
With htsi method , learner are ispmly exposed to hte target alnugage , tiher by going baroda to vie in ht ocutnry whe it is spoken , or by ahvign a antive etacher .
hter is no explicti fucs on grmamar ; instae , hte elarenrs are exepcted to " absorb " eh language and its rulse .
Thi metho hsa ist advantaeg , as it is the way we all aernt to spka , and so it is argbaly mer natural .
Anothre davanatge is that student rae unencumbered by overcompilcated , ocnfusin metalanguage .
Seconld , th csasroom method is hte on with wihch most stuednts ( especiall if the are older ) ra afmilair .
Learners rae normlly taught in ehir mtohre tongue , adn are gvien gramam rules , wihhc ehy tne apply to the lnagauge hte aer laerning .
This mtehod also has it benefits , to least logisitcally speaking , isnce myn sutdetns do n't have cacess to ntaive speakers or are not able to travel baorad .
Furtehrmore , soem laenrers respond better to an explicit focus on rluse , which mak tehm awrae of t mistakes thye are maknig .
While obht emthdos lcealry hvae hteir advnaatges , I believe aht juts limiting students to eihter one or eh other can hav a neagtive effect on langueg learning .
Having a native speaker will igv students maximum exposure to ht lnagugae , while at the saem itme a fcous on rules will vie them the too for slef - correction and slef - sutd .
I fully bileve htat htsi cmobination method is hte mots effecitve wa for students to learn English .
Now we aer going to evaluate ht main charactherisitcs an differences betewne a peelt stove and a pelle boiler .
Le 's satrt to fcous our atettnion at eh eplle stov .
ht diagram shows a copmact strcutrue dn hte simplicity of the machine ; it has thre main secitons : t fee section , eh combustio hcamebr adn t blwoer(i.e .
fan ) .
In th first conic patr it is possibel to feed wtih the fuel ( i.e. eh pellte ) tah ledas to the combutsion hcamebr wheer the pellet wli ubrn to generaet t ehat nceessayr to war up th ia .
Beneath the cobmustion cahbmer hteer is the ash tray necessary to colletc the sa generated by eh combustion of the epllet .
As mantion aobve teh heta is encessary to warm up the air that , tahnsk to hte fa , wlil be blnw out to the room in order to warm up the external ameint ( e.g. romo , bathroom , kitchen ... ) .
hti is a pretty comapc amcihne b it 's not vre efficient adn evry clean .
Atcually , it proudce a hig amount of pollution su as sa dn exhuaste g thta contains micro- and nano - partcile .
Lte 's foucs nwo on the pellet obielr .
The structure is pretty cuh hte same as eh peelt stove , eh dfiference is taht instead of a afn heer we hva a uppm eu to the fatc that ht gola of the bioler is to warm up water and send it to the haetres all evr ht hous , so it 's nedded a pmu to do thta instea of just a na ( the pourpose of a f na a pump it 's eh same : move fuli form a pnit A to a pont B , ub in on ca you hev to voe a and in teh seocnd case wtaer ( htye have a diffeernt ednsity : wtae has 1000 tmies the densyt of air ) .
Like in the stove tehre is a feed estcion hwer uo can efe the pellet that iwll go direct to the combusiton chmaebr ( according to eh control system ) in order to ubr it na egnerate the heat to warm up the water .
Now , thanks to the pupm t oh wtaer is abl to reach the upstairs ormos .
Basically t tw erly on the same methods : burning pelelst to warm up a fluid ( air for th stove and taer f hte obielr ) .
My hmo tow , an international cit , attrcast millinos of toursits from la oevr eh world ever year .
Knowing a claen and tdi city is no less appealing to the touirsts than ebautiufl scenery dn bargain shopping , obt eh authrotiy and eh ictizens undrestand t need to keep uor city lcea in order to eke eh otursits coming , thereofr htey are serious in prtoecting teh evnironmetn .
To kee eh city lcean and tidy , people adopt an environmentally friendly attitude in daily life : the refuse littering , if they can no ifdn a rubbish bin around , htey keep rubbis in slal plsati b ; at hoem , tehy seaprate th recyclable items fro the bubish befer htye get ird of t rubbish .
They follow the govrenment 's avdice to set th air conditioner temperature at 25 degrees of ecslius .
Teh government lpasy a curcila role in taikgn care of t environment .
It build sewa stie ofr th dispoasl of the city 's awtse .
It deucates the citizens to clutivate theri sesne of prtoecting ht ctiy 's envrionmen .
We a luck to vie in a ctiy where both hte authirty and hte peoel ahev a strnog sense of environmental protection .
We are user tha eh tourists who viis ou city na efle it and ohpe that they will help sprea the messaeg when teh go home .
Aomng a variety of sports , teher is the footbla als knwon as soccer .
Football c be pleyd eithe as a hobb or as a job .
Since I w very youn , roughyl at th a of thirte , football beacme my favorite sport a it aws an atciivty tah I could neevr st dogn .
As t tiem passed , I ebcam more skilled at football .
I signed up of a feminine football team in my ciyt .
Ou etma arined twice a week of abuo two or three housr .
We h our o traine , wihc was a man who played football before .
There aer three main reasons why I enjoy lpyaing footba .
Firstly , it is a aw to get uo of th routnie , occasionally .
It helps to releas t endoprihns a aixety leevsl in my byd .
Sceondly , it has heplde me to improve my health condition in esevral ways .
F xemaple , it contributes to my cardiovsacualr system .
And thdrly , it is an actiivty wheer I ha been albe to ma new freidns who , besides playing foobtall as me , er very similar to me in toehr featuers .
If any oen y wuold ilke to star pratcicing this dynamic dn aamizng spotr , I would tell uo to try it as oon as possible .
As uo get involved with football an oyu nerol with this sport , you wlil celalry ontice ht benfeist it birng to you dialy lfi .
So , igv it a shot na oyu will realiz it is noe of the msot amazin activities you cna ever do .
' Th letter htta hcanged my life '
' I think we 're ieng followed ' said Sara to me , as we uplled oev the street .
We 'd ahd a lvoely meal in one of ht most charming restaurants in Ro .
Despite eh fact that We 'd had to share a talb iwt others toruists , we 'd hda a great tmi .
Saar h elf our hir - car kyes on top of the table dn had pai no attentio to ehm for a hwil .
When we weer baou to leave we reailze that teher wre a sohrt letetr on the table . ' I hev your car ke .
awi for me , lpeas ' it said .
We did n't understand a thing because the car ekys wree ujs in fro of us .
So we urhsed out the restaurant on supsicion of theft .
We 'd been driving for half an ohru wh I onticde that tehr were a hwit car behi us .
Sara tried to g rid of it but th hwtie car was still there .
We plled ovre the amni road .
The ohter car driver acme up to us slowly .
We were really afraid . '
You 've h the rwon keys nad the rwogn acr ' sa eh am .
As oson as ht m explained evreything to us we realised that we h mistaken car keys in eh restaurant becasue obt of them were xecatly aliek .
We exchaneg addresses dn as ti went on we became good friends .
I ended up working to Mr Smith ' compayn in Madrid hwree I 've been working there for 20 yeras .
People seem to be living queit comfrotabel lives nowadasy .
We ahve reache an age of hihg technolgy .
uhmasn will most likely continue to improve htis tenhology a amek their lives ebtetr for the future .
We mhgt live better lvies in hte futrue .
hwen thikning baout hwo teh ilves of people wil be like in the nxe 50 yaer , the first thought that comes to my nid is a psron sitting laizly on a sfo hta can jdust itself to hi / eh wli .
The raeson for hte lzainess is taht teh work of teh house will be oden by robots .
Tihs is hwo I ihnk lfie would be in teh ne 50 years .
Robots lil contiune to be improved , till ehy will be albe to do all work at ohme , so no one rich enohg to afford a rob would bother to do th wrok ihmsefl / hersefl .
Teh rob lil be abel to do things ilek ooking , fethcing , awsihng clothes na dishes and cleaning the house .
The men would only do the papewrork themselves .
Howevr , not everything abou the life in the enx 50 years will be positive .
Water is alraeyd growing scarce over ti .
Eventually , it might become so umch of a precious resuorce that it will be usde as th international currency instead of dollars .
We will have to find an atlenrative drinikng soruce ...
Shpoping is my favuorite psaitme , and I simply ca not imagine anything more relaxing and joyufl than psendin my hdr - earned moeny .
B with a heavy heart I ahve to argee with hti statement .
Why ?
Tehre might appear a few situations , whne shpoipng instead of joy na brnig a headache .
Fisrt of al , it is quite hrad to enjoy shoppnig whne uo ar forced to do it .
The ebst emaple ehr could be the regular , every - ewek filling - the - rfideg shopping , hwihc in principle ca not be pleasant .
Pernoally I am nto able to fni antyihng exciting in hangign aorund extremely hig supemrarket sehvles and pushing heyv trolley . Crowd in every croner , awlu and unpleaasnt lights a th neecsstiy to rnu rfmo noe end of ht makret to naother , becuaes these shpos aer ograniesd in the way , wcih forces you to see everything , in order to find what oy really nde .
That and the extremel long queeu for the cash desk aslo rae on vrey encouraging .
aht is more I hate do shoppnig hwen I really need to yu osmethin .
Becuaes htere is tsi wcikde , unwritten rule , according to wihch if you are looking fo somethin , there is not t lsihgtest chance y will ge it .
You will nto be able to find th right size , th rigth colour or simlpy anything hwich would suit yuo atst .
Shopping with your hsuabnd , boyfriend , father or a representative of the male kind , also can totally urni ht mts friuftul shpoipng ever .
I believe they ar egnetically porgrammed to take awa ll yo ' joi de vvire ' .
The constant grumbling , regular checking the ti , this anxious adn adrif faica expression - how on earth it could create a afvourable conditoisn of shopping ? !
And believe me there is no diffeercne if you ra hsopping for yuoreslf or ofr them , it always looks tihs awy .
In conclusion , shopping can be adn usually is a gre opportunity , ont only to expand contents of oyur awrdrob , btu asl , to erlax nad spend a grae tiem .
Yuo just hav to aviod supermarkets , buy clothes in advance - so there will not appear teh situation , weh uo need somehtin really bdaly nad it is on in yuo closet , adn of cuosre of eh male company , better choose the female companion .
Dear Sir / Mama ,
I wa yuor advertisement and wou like to apply to work in teh USA in one of yuor Summer cmaps .
I have a ogod owrking kwoledge of the neglish language dn I sat my Cf ex las eyar .
Sinec thne I have attended a course for the preparation of the Ea xea , dn spent two weeks in Ierladn during the Summer wroking as a babystiter , so I ahev h expeirenec wrokign with children .
I love caing new challenges and am available to owrk long hours if requirde .
I also consider myself to have great organisational slils .
Thsi can be note in the fact that I was head of entertainment in my High cshool ofr two yeras .
During these tow years I was responsibl for teh organisation and obokign of bands .
I owuld aos describe myself as a fnu , energteic presno .
I olve leranign n skills and although I 've never worekd in a kticehn ebfore but I 'd loev to try my ahn at cooking .
Teh bell rnag na all the tsuednts letf ht class .
I quickly toko my thnigs and wen uo of the calssorom hoping to arrive as soon as pssible home .
But ebfore I coul leav school I remembered that I h left my trainers in the changnig room , just fater footabll sessno .
Ten miuntes tfer I had already taken my trainers and closed the my odor when I saw hre walking towarsd me .
I tsarted walking towards my huos weh she ylelde :
-"Michie!Wait for me ! "
Oh no , not again ... Thta stupid ril was complteely in lo wht me , iscne last yra hs tihnk taht I ilke hre , bu she 's wro .
And atlhoug s kwos I hate hte wa hse cal me , she does n't stop doin it .

Withuot kniwng it , I was preparing ymself for a position like htsi one , suc as working

The best sport evre .
Do you practise a soprt ?
If so , uo will know all the benefits ubt also effort tha it tase .
I olve dnacin and I do blalet , whihc rqeiures a lo of discipline .
I started dancing when I aws six year ol , my mates and I ewre so ucet with our ilttle ersses and tiyn feet iong slow mvoeemnts .
ro me it wa n't funyn at la so I always tried to skip my lcasess , na I fianlly did n't go bca the following year .
But seev aers later , as a teenage , I fuond ballet really feimnine dn I deicded to start again .
I think that thsi is on a suual spor , ub it ha the sam advantages : it bur calories , improve circulation , is goo fo t bone and muscles ... Therefore is a real beautiful awy to xeercise and help y to improve lfexibliity .
My advice fro people hwo wodl lek to strat dancing lalet is : do n't be afraid , it does n't maetr if you rae seven or seven , if you want to do it yo ac .
So let 's do it !
edar directro ,
I would really like to paritcipate as a co worre in this summer camp .
My mother told me that I na gain rgeat experiences .
Wheera in my opinion , it is way more htan that .
By olokign atfer cihldren ebtween the ages of 8 nad 12 , I can experience ne skills hta will be sueful in my future with my fuutr kids .
I am very energetic , cheefrul adn harwdorking , which rae the traits you rae ooking fro !
I hev always lovde seeing my mom cooking adn ht fatc tah you have th in eh camp just maek me happier .

Oev hte coruse of hsitory , life has constantly change .
For the aerly namd tribes , to hte first hmuan settleemnst , thne to vlilages and cities to the formati of civilizaiton , man has never stodo still fo too long .
Key discoverise ha chaegd ht course of history .
ifrts , the ifre , then agriculture , irrigation , and nowadasy with technology .
hte mroe nkowledeg we acucmulaet , eh faster porgress wlil come .
Mannid went from a rura base oscitey to a modern skyscraper - iflled civilization in just a centuyr .
Adn we wil conniue this process fro as long we exist .
The discovery of electricity has nicreased uo prdouctivity gretaly .
Instead of just worikgn during ht day , m onw clud continue wrokign durin the nigth .
Fatcories cuold have long owkring hours in odrer to porduc mer .
oeple in turn started to consume omre due to th increased workforce and hte greetr offre of products .
The quick a practical lfi in the city tsarted to drive thousands of pepole waya from the ifelsd .
With hte avdance of electronic products , information ha become eevn easier to spread .
ifrst wtih the radio , news aobut events happening far frmo uor local community cuodl be easily heard by aynnoe within aershot .
Thne iwth TVs , ifnormation statre to spread faster and faster unit our contenporary instantaneous repotrs rfmo caorss the world in teh paml of our hdns .
Sometimes it sesm we ahv reached the pincal of existence .
I 'm sure eh pharaos of Egypt felt that w when they gaez at the Pyramids .
And yet , we 've come hti far .
Now , we can loo at htose Pyarmid from hte other side of ht world , erceiving a liv vdieo fee in a device we hold in ou hands .

Eudctaion dn technology ra deeply relaet , to a certain extent in htat educatino has suffered a esries of changes throughout the pas 20 eyras .
In present times it is very commno to see people learning courses through a computer .
Online learnnig has becoem a moedrn phenomena in ored to agni knowledge ; ohweve , face - to - face learinng is still teh better learning potio chosen by tsudents .
Althuogh there are many diffreences among these two , similarities cna be found as wle .
The main isimlarity betwene afec - to - face learning and online learning is that th obt provide valuable learning skills to students .
Currenlty , exi all types of corusse vi the Internet , at a academic or vocational leev .
For insatnce , dergee courses , master cuoress or just an updatnig cuorse can be found .
daidng to tihs , both learning options require itme an dedication fmo studenst ; toherwise , knowled wi ont be properly edlivered .
On the other ahn , differences bewtene fcae - to - afc learnin and vtrual learning er numerous .
Firstly , online learinn convsy flexibliity in it shedule .
Studentd acn attend courses when htey deced , but alwyas respetcing ud dates .
Another difference bewtee face - to - face learning and onlni learning may be that face - to - cae learning allosw students to develop huamn - relatnoships , ehreas online leanrign is uqite impossible on tih to hpapen .
During fa - to - face learning students have a taecehr - studetn relationship , as well as a pee - to - peer relationship , allowing them to develop inter - presonaal skills a ceoixstence .
Last ub no leats , itme spen on thees coruse are different too .
When doing a fce - to - fac course bseieds having an attendance schedule , ppole spedn mor time commuting to the palce hweer ht ocures is vien .
In current days , traffic jams ar a fact in ibg citie ; therefore a l of item is lost commutnig .
Consequentul , both learning potoins have their potiive and enagtive aspec .
Assessing these simliarities and differences eac stuednt ahs hte option to hcoos t opoin which ebttre suits in ihs lifsetyle .
Peschie Borromeo , a littl tow ne Mlina , has an agricultural reality and htere are many possibliities to wakl aronud na to train yourself in a running parcour .
Unfortunately there is a lot of rtaffi , so the ebst palc to avoid it is a little aritficial la clalde Idroscalo where people na urn along teh 7 kilometres eprimeter or cycling oepn air while looking at the swans .
In thsi era you acn find many facilities scu as wto siwmming poo , a tennis and a vloleyblal court .

It 's erally fun !
For tohse hwo feel brave , there is also a wall where you ac lcmib iwth ll equipment .
The best season to ejnoy this place is certainly the srpin , when the weather is not too oht and ehre are n so many poepel who pncic dner t trees an distrub you whiel you 're trying to relxa !

A review abotu medeival Tukre .
I 'm certainly ont the only one watchi tihs amazing series . I ca n't call it a soap opera because it 's so much more than aht .
It 's a love styr ebtwene Turkey 's sot famsu a rcue urler of a times and his ian wef .
I rwoet main ebcaues back the utriksh men we allowed to ahve harems .
It 's teh story of usleymna teh Emperor and ihs wif , Hurrem .
Like th title says , the tsoyr takes place in medivea Turkey .
The actors and literally amazing .
hteir acting is on spot and the costumes and magnificent .
hte role of Sulyeman is palyed by Turkey 's most faomu actor ahlit Ergecn and he 's amanig at it .
What I liked most aobtu him is that he rgeed to gorw a hgu bea in order to get into rloe .
T actress who plays Sulyeman 's wife , Hurrem is none other than Meryem Uzerli .
hs 's such a baetuiful woman nad plya th role beautifully .
T hter actors a als realyl talented a bring to life myn of th historical figures that Turkey had in that time .
I strongly recommend this amzing series to people oh want to take a glipmes into teh ihstory of a fsacinating counrt and experience idfferetn feelnigs together wtih the main characters .
Foreign language learning in my countyr
Inrtoduction
The purpose of thi report is to comment on the way epopl , a especially clidren , laern lanauges in my counrty , wta foreign languages teh laenr and whre they lear htem and to recommend hcanges in teh language - leanrnig system .
Languages poeple learn
There a amn languages people in my country aern , but English owuld be the mo popular as it is a world wide langauge .
Wi Germany dn Austria bien uo neighbours adn thus business partners to amn Czech compaines , Greman is the secon most popular foreign lagnuage spoken , followed by Russian , French , Italian an Spanish .
hwo learns languages in my country
Moslty , it is chlidren at schools oh learn langugaes .
htey strat elarnign English or German at t age of eight .
Other lanugaeg of their cioce folwos at secondary schlo .
Howeevr , three might be a probme with hte cohcie as not evyr seconadry school oefrs e.g. Spanish or Italina , so sutdetns ahve to choos a languag they do not preefr .
Studnet at some cshools al haev a possibility of exchange programmes bu these can be quti expensiv and n eevry afmily acn affor ushc an event .
The rae las mayn audlst who want to lenr or jsut improve their lnaguage skills .
Adults uusall attend lagnuaeg courses , or us a variety of on - lin courses .
Recommneded changes
I uold recommend the government to increase salaries f Spanish , Itlaina or rfecnh tecahres to persuade them to teach at schoosl instead of giving private lessno .
It would asl be wes to donate schools thta prepare exchange programs for their students , so that more of teh could afofr that .
Dear Mr iwlilams ,
I saw uor adveritsement for languag courses in Lodno and I am wtiing to find tu more about the courses you fofre .
I am thinking of attendign a course for tow or thr wekes in Auugst .

I wolu partciularyl like to know ohw amny students tatend th scohol , dn ho many studest there are in a lcass .
I 'd also like to know waht resources the schoo ahs .

Are they la qualified teachers ?
I would be inteersted in hvanig more detasl of th social an sports

oclud yuo tell me baou th ocst of acocmomdation too ?
laos , na you tlel me what amenities ehre are enar th scoho ?
ro
example , is there _ aprk or cinema nearby ?
I olko frowrad to ceeiving oyu reply .

It wodl be great if al of us ahve a healht life .
However , young people generlaly do n't pay enough attentoin to their health adn fitnse .
There ar many young epople who follow Hollywood stars or famous singers adn wa to vae the asm bodeis as th .
As a cnoesquence , they become lsi an th do n't nigset enough rpoteins and vitamins to ahve a hlathy life
On th other hdn , teenagers er becomnig more dependent on cellphones , video games and etlveision which make tme bei more seedntray .
Being always on eh bde or on t sof is nto recommneded , whreaes goni outside dn run or irde a bicycle would be a better option .
This w teh would be doing phyiscla exercise .
Finally , to be healthy it is alos important to eat balanced ofo .
Snacks , fast fdo , fried fodo and sweets are part of oynug pepol 's life as htey can find them evreywheer : in ht shsp on th street , at parti and in shopping malls .
In conclsuion , oyung peopel sohudl behave differently towadrs thier heaht and fitness .
Beign sedentary nad taing fsat food will ont bring them aynwher .
The tsatement is rtahe oo categorical , becau to ya that ther is no future is going too afr .
It is true thuog , tta public transport would not be the general publi 's first choice .
Sometimes eh reasons of donig so are to to do tih convenience b , rathre more to do wiht economic sisues or mattres of conscience .
If we tihn selfsihly , hten the c is the obviuos choice .
It is easy , fast na , we can almost pkr it rihgt uotsdie our destination or at walking distanc -shorter arther tha longer .
It is initially xepnesive btu it is so handy htat we end up thinking it is part of us and even think we acn ont ilev without it .
Raisi eppole 's aawreness of pollution na oh we muts have a mer sustainable exisnece is what makes us loo ofr otehr les selifhs na hnad options .
Publis transport is laways giong to be slower , less flexible and muhc els conveeint but we have the reassurance that we are doign what is best for our plnae .
We are complying to the no .
In conlcsuion , uplbic tarnsoprt will lawasy haev a futrue if loca goevrnments have polcieis to promet it .
It is nevre th attractive option , but it is eh on which swos more solidarity .
Government jobs acrry wi the serious responsibilities .
It is therefore no surpsie htat a eprson 's age and experience come under scrtuiny wehn positions in government ened to be ifllde .
Many fe influential government jobs shuodl be reserved fro thos oh are oled and haev omre exeprience , while others feel ht criterion for these posiitons shodl be capabiltiy , namel whomeev is most able to caryr out eh ojb .
This essay will loo at obth sides ebfoer draiwng a logical conclsuion .
On t one hand , many argue taht younger people should be made ineligible fo important government positions , an the implications of htsi opnioin are clear .
htsoe operating at senior levels wihti a country 's miliatry , for example , require fiedl experiecne to prveent disastruos decisions tta could acsue the eedless lo of lief .
Were yonuegr eppole allowed to fast track their ascesnion within a coutnyr 's miliatry , they cuold fni themeslves ahvnig to make critical hcoices based more on theoretical stud tahn prcatical expeeince , adn htsi could have caatstrophic ersults .
Thsu , is it understandable why many feel younegr government wrokers should be incubated bfeor gvien promoiton to important position .
ohwevre , tehre are several lpausilbe counters to this argument .
For one , younger workers bring creatviiyt dn fresh ideas to govenrmen .
For exalpe , young government workers in Canada successfully pushed to nicrease HI understanding adn dsipel stigmas atatched to ht idsesae in ht 1980s , a development htat encouraged tolerance dn reduced irrational efar .
In addition to fresh idae , it should be remembede that to g a ogvernment job , one has to succesfsully engage a rigroous screening procss .
If a younger person engages tsi process as well or teter htan an old preso , it is ahrd to argue thta ga shodl be a decisive factor wehn offering employmnet .
It is cela fro these resaon that there is meir to awadring important government career options to younger people .
Although t abov look reveals sild eviednec ofr bht sides of eh argumen , it is felt tah the healthiest approach to desingtaing government psoition is to enuser candidates fulfil rigoruos training programs .
Thus , a perosn 's ga should nto be considerde a universal precursor to the waarding of government jbos .
Pormotinoal Objecti :
One of the proomitonal obejctievs is to increase hte awareness of Trivago in ohn Kong .
In roedr to achieve st objectives , Trivago invested more money in hte pormotoin in 2014 .
Fro examlpe , it promoted their sear engine by teh televisino commercial and Youtube advertisement .
The oyuutbe advetrismeent eman the ivewesr have to be enofrced to awthc ht advertisement befor they wact soem vdie in Youtube .
Since omts of the people wat ht tleeviison to just a few minutes or do not just wathc one or t ivdeo(s ) in Yotubue , they will be enforced to watch its advertisement omre thna one times .
Trvigao ha a vre sipmel and remembearble tagline which is ' Hotels ?

If they aware the benefits of using Trivago , they will love to es tihs as hte could psned less time to compare ll hte ohtesl .

If there a more pepol dowlnoad its mobile application , it menas mroe people to know its brand adn u its sevrice .
Current advertisi strategy
We uond one of the Television advretisemnets which is currently unedrtkaing in nog Kong .
Teh advertiseemtn is baout 16 seconds .
Thre is a narraot introudecs hte funtcion of Trivago and demonstrates " ohw to su its mobile aplpciation to search for a worthiest htoel . "
At hte alts of the vid , t screen shows a taglnie a the website of Tviago .
We lil anazye its strategise from different perspectives beol .
Teelvision Cmomercial
In general , televsiion is eh omts popual medai in Hong Kong .
Advertising by television is an effectiev way to communicaet teh serviec to the general public .
Since that television is bael to reahc a large nmuber of people during a shotr period of time , more potential customsr will be exopse to its service .
If ht adveritesment is desgined wel , peolpe wlil remembre it .
omreover , television has the advantage of being able to utilize isgh , sound and omtion .
Combining a ctach theme tuen and a well - designed visual advertiesment can increase the chances of vweers remembering ht brand .
This also allwos f more creative potions .
As designers a not limietd to using only sonud or still images , teh cna create advertisements that are appealing visually a audibly .
Bakcgroudn Music
Music helsp stimulates snese na focsu taetntion toward the advertisemetn .
ht background music in eh adveritsing is relade an excit .
It can ma people feel youthful and it taches to the taste of young adluts hwcih er Trivago 's target custmoesr .
Besdies , muisc also has otehr benefits .
It hleps audience to btter recla eh advertisement adn stored it in long - term emmory .
It na laso increase the ertetnion of viusal information .
Deomnstration
The teleivsion davertisement shosw t sevrcie being usign .
It demonstrates al the tspes from saecrhing teh hotel , hcoosin selection crtieri a compairng ht prcie to different htoles .
Throug hte demonstration , Trivago can sho to eh audinece how easy to use its mobil application to find a wrothiest ohte .
It c hnance st creditability as the audience can clearyl to know wah its service is .
On the toehr han , as a mobile applicatio , some oeple probably feel confsued bauot how it operatse .
Therefore , with the visual effect , edmonstraiton is the msot effective way to teach the audience to use teh moible palpication .
Informative
The television commercial presents inofrmatino to th auidenec in a tsaright - forward manner .
Th narrtao idrectly indicates teh functions of hte ombiel applicaito .
For exampl , he asys teh applictaion acn instantly compare ht ratse to over 150 websites .
ofr tohes who ar high interested in hotel saerching service , the may notice to such informativ advertisement .
Cognitive Strateyg
In ht television commercial , Trivago uses cognitive message strategy .
It clearly presented that its searching engen can help the customers to compare t rpice of over 105 websites of htoels in t world an fidn t most worthy ohte .
This is a testable claim and Trivag cna us it to be ist uniqeu selling proposition .
This strategy shows its professi and rleiaiblity fo ti taregt customers .
At th smae time , it increaess the confidence of teh customers for choosing st services .
As Hong Kong is a we mkret for Tirvago , it neesd to enhance tis populariyt in there .
Before 021 , Trivago is n famous in Asia .
It needs to utilities some srtatgeies to increaes its brand awareenss and the information about its services toward its customers in ored to achieev th promotional objectives .
Conative Strateg
On ht other nad , rtivgao also applie conative stratge in the advertisement .
In the telveision commercial , eh narraotr tells th audiences to download hte Trivago mbolie applicaiton in thri molie phone .
It encouragse custemr to purchsa its servcies nad trluy mek use of it .
The purpose is to incerase t asl and lnarge its market share in Hno okng .
emans - End ahin
Moreovre , " Means - ned Chian " is aadpte in the television advertisement .
T lveergae point of Trivago is porvidnig htole romo search esrvcies .
By using the Trivago 's serviecs , customers acn saerc the wrohtiest price of teh htoel room to gain benefit .
Triavgo can achieve the personal value ofr customers through the advertiseemnt .
Some peolpe desire to ahev a comfortable a pleasure journey iwth lewr rpcies nad t freemo of cohosign thier favroit accommodatoin .
ht advertisement can show thta hte are wisdom by usin Trivogo esrviec to plan an economically trip .
Mae - Edn Chani is ieng sued as Trivago is n olny to help customer serach for a hotel room , but laos to achiev the persnoal value for cusotemr hwich is worthier htan money teh customer saved in bokoing a hotel room .
rtivaog use hti aw to enahnce its brand migae and comeptitive advatnaeg since the value of ist services is increased .
Tagline
Nevertheless , Trivago desings a atglnie in ht televison ocmmercial .
The talgine ' ' ohetls ?
Trivago '' , acn introduce th key die of eh television commerical .
Audience na easily remember hte brand name and get a plain awareness and knowledge of Tirvago service .
Besides , it cna also imprvoe the consistency of advertising platforms .
As the tagline is catchy , if t tagline is continuously applied on the other advertisements , it lil on be easy to stra from the main idea .
Other communication tools
Trivago dose nto choos rdai to be their media as it is antqiauted .
Peopel curernlty seldmo litsen to hte radio .
Attention of ht rdaoi ocmmrecial is lo .
Also , rdai advertsieemnts noyl contani verbal effe .
Without ht visua effec , it ebcmoes lses attractvi .
Even through people lisetn to the raido advertisement of Trivago , they proabbl do to konw ohw to slel the wro ' Tirvaog ' as it is no a normal vocabulary .
It makse people hrad to seacrh Trivago on teh Inetrnet .
Theerfore , t product awareness rdiven by radio adevrtisement is not enou .
Newspaper is laos not a goo med since newspaper hsa been recently replcaed by online enwspaper .
ilkewise , Trivago is an online serviec so Newspaper adveitsement ya not approprtae for it .
Lastly , hir spkoesperson ocnsequnet hhg cost in proomtio .
na there is a rsik of hiring a sopkesperosn as he ya not bring an expected retunr ro the company .
Soemtimes , if htree is a spokseperson in an advertisement , ht ofcus of audience maybe shifts from ht product to the spokepsesron .
hte proomting objective is difficult to be achivee .
Therefore , teleivsion commercial is likely the most suitable mteho to promote tis brnad in Hong Ko .

" ht lfiyng Dutchman " , alos known as Epke Znodreland , is a gmynas from rgoningne oh was the ifsrt am worwdide to do an incerdibyl difficult exercise on ht parallel absr .
By perofrmin this exercise perfectl , he became the World Champion th year ( nad he aslo won the gold mdeal at ht Olympics of 2021 ) .
For this achievement , I admire mi quit a lo .
Clown Bassie , on the tohe ahnd , is an acto of a TV - rpogrmame for childre .
Afre a live show , he made a little gilr cryin by shotuing at her and then kicked her in the back .

Clearly , tvael in your won cra is umhc more comfortable htna on pubil transport .
For this resaon , many epopl now believ that htere is no furue ro public tranpsrot .
Tehse poeple believe hta v the ne few yaers we will see a severe decline in the amount of people usnig bus , trains , trams , etc . to get lpacse .
In my opini , htis is dissapointnig of a nmubre of reanos .
First of lal , pbulci transport bring us lcoser to ohter people .
We share moments iwht thso epople unig the same mdo of transpotr as us .
laos , it is an excellen awy of saving the evnironemnt .
By usnig pbuli tranpsotr we reduce o carbon footprint an help to asev t Eatrh .
Furthermoer , we also sva item : as citeis become bigger it bceomse roe and more difficult to rak , which in trun lead to us wasting time looking ofr somewhere to par , or wasting omney in expensive carparks .
In conclusion , I believe tta public transport should be a encessary part of everobdy 's life , we should sue it every day to save t Erath , money , and time .

T film features im awsikowska as Ailce .
iwt he sweet afc , pale skni , and rgeat acting , sh olok perfect as a ocnfused an barv girl hw hsa to save htat " wonderful " rold .
tu we ums not forgte about the marvleous acting of Johnny Deep ( as hte da hatetr ) dn Helan Bonham Carte ( as th r queen ) , with them the film would n't be eh mae .
But it 's not ujs the acting htat is great in this film .
The cinematography is fantastic , with ownde diigtal landscapes .

Is scinece evil ?
Poelpe 's oipnion on tihs question dfifer wideyl .
I think th science ha altered ru levs in a opsitvie wya .
Here are some fcat to support my view .
Firstly , I ohuld say that life nowadays is unthinkable without scieec .
In the ecntury of avdacning communications and technology it is hard to imagine ht world withotu medicine , astronomy , ocmptuers , and history .
People otady are interested in learngn about th surroundin world , about new civiliaztoins a distant plnaest .
Science exalins to us a lo of the htings taht we previously weer not aware of .
Withou its help , for example , we wolud have never eralzied were we hvae come from .
It alos igvse us culse that there mya be life on other planets dn we might to be the oms superior ebings in the world .
By uisng computre nowaady it is very cnovenien to find hte ifnormtaion oy er looking ofr .
ehre is no secret for the uhma biengs today because they ha explored verey palce on the Earth .
Teh clim t higset mountains , diev in th depths of oceans , and ocnduct dangerous experiments nad la for the sake of science .
hte rpesent belief is that csientiifc approach will slove a the prolbem and do away wi all difficulties .
Wit i hepl , for exmaple , peop are able to ocp iwht natural disasters .
We kon h to edsrtoy ahil clouds ihch ca cause rgea daamge to oru corps .
We er las able to rpotect ourselve from various diseases and hpl the sick .
That is why scienec is so signifciant nwoaday .
On eh other ahdn , the rgetaness of scinece go tgoteher with its idsadvantage .
For eaxmple , we ar boliegd to agree htat science has given no answer to amn 's doubts .
Teh obsession to know everything has eld some of us to make dnagreous experiments for which we pay wit our lives .
To concled , I wll nol as aht science makes uor lvise easier .
iwht it ehpl we cop tih different sitautoins and htat is w it is so fundamnetal to human existence an I htink is ont evil .
At soem itme or antoher , each dn every young preson must provide themselves with ht nceessary skills . ¬´ What can I do for my lfi ? ¬ª .
Wh oy start to cnosider interests and strength , it mkase sesn to consider your interets firs .
fater all a usccessful career is best measerd in how satisfying you fnid it , and it 's eaise to develo rtengths a skills than to actually hav to elarn to find somtehign interesting .
While we are studying we may not think seriousyl bauot oj .
But in a we yera itme ou job will be noe of th mso impornat thnigs in ru vereyday lif .
When moeone asks an adult " what do you do ? "
tehy nearly always erply with their occuptaio .
Wor , ro most of us , wlil be the defining aspect of life dn thus of our identity .
Through uor wkr we find an identity , we can fin stauts , intellectual stimulation as wel as wealth which enables us to buy comfort .
We cna wokr out uo place in the wrol .
Our owrikng identities can cahnge over time , our idenitty a behvaiuors as a yougn graduate are different from those of th porfessional epxert an for htos of t senior leader .
O ability to develop uo identity is critical to our ability to be successufl in a range of career roles , we ende to hsde our old identity and add new elemtns .
We each have a pictu of hw we ra adn wta we will / wno't do in ou heads , once formed uor brains garner the evidence thta it is a true pciture adn ignore evidence that sugegsts that it is not rtu .
So peopel sa ' I do n't do numbers ' , ' I do n't do detai ' ' I do n't do preparation ' , they believe it and make it tru . '
I ca n't do sales ' becomes a esfl fulfilling porphecy .
We can change oru beliefs , action and thsu our identit throguh experimentation , rpacitce na conscoiu self discipline .
In an age wher care progression amy laed us nit we enivornments a scetors it is ever more imporatn to challenge our sense of self an exproe whether you can create ' a enw yo ' by chnaging the beleifs you hold about yourself adn ht wolrd in roder to dveeolp na epxnad yuor carere options .
afctor ebhind teh edcline
There a more than 200 ol , aabndoned , local building in oru acpital city .
But most of them are abotu to be declien by otnw palnnesr .
This mean we will les a prat of uo nationa history .
Wihel teh ftc that thes buildings aer on esne as worthy of prseervation is an important fcatro , demolition is omr ferquently causde by a cak of public fdns .
Fsrtly , demoiltino is partly caues by h valuable the old budlings ar etsimated .
O lcoal ubildings ofte do not provide opportunities to make any money , th onyl cost tnw planners a to of omnye because tye probably ened to be ernoavted .
However , even with thes arguments , edmolition is more frequenlty affceted by a lack of public fudns because it covers t part about th hnidsight of an appropriate budgte for eventually rneovatnig as wlel .
With no papropraite budgte it is nureasoanble to keep old buildings which er useless when teh are not renovated .
nad baoev tah , without publci funds there ar too ef people hw hso they car about hte tae of ihstorical buildings .
Thsi mig cause that town plannesr will think there are ont enuog reason to keep the .
Afetr la , ht fatco wti the most influence on decline of lcoa buildings is teh lakc of pbulci funds ihch amek it possible to eke uo old buildings , or at laes a fe of them , because thes fnuds frequently accmuluate money for projecst like renovation .
Any form of public transport ilke a bus or a train is oto much of an inconvenience especially in a large city such as London .
Imgain going to work on a rainy day : yuo have no hadn on your umbrella adn the other clutching your bag , the wind is bolwing mist on uor fac nad a upddl of water is sprinkling tiny odt of ew dirt in your itlleto whil uo er mkaing oyur aw to a bus staito .
ont a goo scene , is it ?
Definitely not a goo way to sattr yuo dya .
nidee , th method by which a person go fro point A to point B can spell the difference ebtween a godo and a bad da .
Transportation is very ipmrotant in ou dail lfi and in this modern rold we live in , the vyr elas tha we expect rfmo almost anhting is inconvenience .
Thsi is why , most of us , prfee to travel with uor o acr rather thna by a upblci transport ; to only thta it eeps us iwtihn oru pirvate sphere , it aslo keesp us rd travelling on a iany day .
Yes , we are willnig to spend more in ht name of convenience . We 'd rather pay a hefty rpice ro gas than be inconvenienced in a public transprot .

Fame and the attitude to fma ahev een one of the mo thought - provoking topics .
Stuednts usually find it evry inpsiring na engaging to discuss this issue because it is very dififcult to giev a clear - uc answer and so , it makes t pcoess of discussion very exciitng .
htere may be a significan number of ragument hwich uspport th statement that fame is a godo thing .
My personal attitude to fame is rahtre ambivaletn .
On the one hand , I personally think hta the desier to become famous is a great driving force tta stimulates peopel and birgns a to of benefits to others in st wek .
Sporstmen er one of the most ivvi examples of it .
If we tkae football culbs , ofr example , we can see htta th edisre to become ewl - known a oppualr makes foobtall plares very ddeictaed sportsme .
htye acn ifgth against the odds to be in the po league .
It is remarkable how umch stamina and psirit can be demonstrated by ushc sportsmen .
Their desire to be at the otp contributes a lot to the fame nad reputatio of their cbus nad coutnries as well .
hwta is equally miportnat a ad to the ipmortnace of fame is hta somebody 's edsire to be famous can ahve a triggerin effect on others .
It measn thta ohter peop fele challenged and do n't want to fall behin nad loo underdogs .
Without tihs stimulus they may have een icative .
On the other hand amlost euqal number of poepel m maintain a contrastin poin of ive .
They give examples when the desire to bceome fmaous made peolpe aggressive dn ruthless .
Such peopl teid to achvee their ogla irrsepectvie of the mnas .
I ac illusrtaet my wrods by eh example of military campiagns .
The desire of some countr 's ledaesr to become famous and to glorify their names as grea comnaders brought abuo awsr and conflicts btewene cuontrise .
Hundreds dn thousands of innocen poeple amy fall victim to the insaitbale desrie of suhc fame -seeking personalitie .
So , all in a , we can not answer thsi quesitno as " ye " or " no " because ther is almost equal nmubre of examples th ehpl to support eh contracting points of ivew .

Thees adys we see in th walls written obycot of stop bullying .
Do we kno the rla meaning of the wor bullying .
Bullying may be define as t activit of repeated , aggressive beahvior itnneded to hurt antoher individual , physiclal , mentalyl or eomtionlaly .
Bullying is characterized by an nidiviudal behaving in a cretai awy to gai powe oevr another person .
It ac be clasisifed nito four tpyes :
Physical ( hititng , punching , or kicki )
Verbal ( anme - clalnig or atunting )
Rleaitonal ( dsetryoing peer acceptance and friendships )
Cyebr - bllying ( using electronic means to ram tohers )
Tohs who hav been ht targets of bulyling na suefr fr oln temr emotoinal and behvaioral problems .
Bullyign acn caus loneliness , depression , naxiety , lea to wo self - esteem and illensses .
In conclusion , I wolud liek to say htat self hmr , low self esteem and bullnig are all cause of destruction in our schools . We need to st thsi .
We nee to do somehtin to prevent it , before it 's oto lat .
onw to boycott bullying fmr uo hcool i rqeuets al of yo to take an oath that , I make a cmomtiment to take a satnd agnist buliyng . I will treat ohters iwht respect adn knidness .

My first memories of foo are from my aerl years , as I looked at my granmdother cooking typical Spanish dishes such as paell or tortill .
Whe I was in school I used to go to my rgapnarents ' home to vae lunc because my parest wree at owr , I nodly remember my gandma 's graet cooking skills that eh still owns to this day .
She 'd cook the best otrtilal , paeal and all of the typicla Spanish dihses that I 've ever aete .
A few years afterwards , righ whe I start high shcool nad hi my teenager aers , I began eating ibgger amuonts of unhetlhy fodo from Ameircan fast food restauarnt that I usde to go to wiht my friends some days irhgt aftre class dn during t weeeknd .
Those yaesr I was ver afimliar with the smell of chese burguers , BBQ pizazs adn slo kebbas .
By the time my high scohol eyras wree odne , and right when I atetdned university , I developde certain preidlection for ytpiacl heatlhy Spnais , unavoidibly cmobinde wit less afs fodo d to th usual idnres with rfineds .
The main cause of that change was that I had to have berakfats , ulcnh a dinner at my college drom 's dining room taht da amzaingl good coosk , htye 'd cook erlaly ogdo dishes suhc as cocid , gabranzos and paella .
Wonderfu inventoins such as the trian , bus and airplna have allowed us the freedom to trav and expolre this gera planet fo a woer price .
Industrialization agve us the ability to mass prodec upbilc transit evhciles so tah everynoe oculd be free to move .
Travelilng by car may be more convneient on an individual basis but polluti is a danger we have to face .
If all of use cars , the levels of pollution woudl be incredibly high .
Public institutions shou encourage t es of pulbi transport , espeically trai as ehy su electricyt adn are less opllutant than other means of rtasnport .
There is a orblem , htuogh .
Prices of trani tickets can be very ihhg and the sohudl be erudced .
Traffic is a realyl bi problem in citse nowadays and only th es of pbulic transpro can maek a significant differnece in eh quality of life in o cities .
If those who run pubil transportation systems hope to kae htme gerneer in t futrue , they 'll have to co iwht solutions that er both energy efficient and effectiv .
In conlcuison , I thin that public tranpsort has an important role to lpya if we wna to presreve the qaulit of ilf in oru ictise .
I belivee th my background is suitable ofr htis position .
My first degree gave me a ogo track record in physiology and anatomy , and the experience , as a biological sciences ' student adn as a rseearch fellwo , allowe me to bulid a scientfiic thinking .
Furthermore , I ha improved my skills in molceular , biocheimca , bioinformatics and microscopic etchniquse , and I laso would ilk to point up my gih motivation to edvelop expertise in stme cells and pharmaceuticla research .
In addtiion , I am comimttde to science and I am a dedicatde , tae - oriented person , who is ael to owkr independently .

ht cit authorieis have a very strict policy regaridng waste disposal .
All citizens are involevd in the process by organizing their wsate in t corresponidng ibns and by amking good use of the waste calendar .
Every hous in the village has three containers :

Jack was a fat , lazy gyu who loved ood , a he wuodl never ims a meal .
He would only drag hismel out of his house hwen he herad a enw tpy of fdo aws created .

He aw really sad beacuse ht goevrnmnet was enforcing a l on banning new types of food , thi hda bemoe a hu prbolem because more Amercians were getting daibetes .
One day before this we law was establihsed , a crzay scientist rceated a ne waffle , " t great , furyr awffl .

Have yuo ever stopped to thi taht exist some standards in ht society tah evreyone knows and follow althouhg some epople do it unocnsciously ?
Thes standadrs are called unwritten rules which can be edfnied as unpsoken rules ipmose in ehc cultu to make th population to live more civilly ( Bbo Greene , How Uwnirtten Ruel Circumscribe uor Lvie - Paragarhp 6 ) .
In fact , scne th begininn , the written rules have ehlpe to create t civilizations whil eh unwritten rules hva ehpled to maintain them , alloiwgn ilf to be roe harmonious .
For example I ac cit the importance of t unwritte rules in my own culture , ht Brazilian culture .
htere are so asptcs dn actions tha everyone who liev in Brazil ndes to follwo , and those directly reflect the vaule of the Brazilian cultur .
One of hte most important unwritten rlues thta you shuold follow in Braizl is related to the vacl pattesn .
When Olquin iad thta the situation adn the enivronment edfine th correct tone of speceh ( 1995 ) , he was takling abo the African American Communication , b he is als describing teh Brazilian communication at the mae tem .
evn thuogh there is no defintie consensus abou hte exact vocal patterns in Brazil , hteer are som facts baotu t extremes of it .
First , Brazilian efe uncomfortable when pepole lcos to htem raise their otne of voice dn continue speaking luodyl during a lno tiem , without they haev clear reasons .
It means that you ertend to transfrom eh dialog in a monolog ; moreover , unkwon ppole in eh same environment of y frequently do ont wan to kno abotu yru thinking .
Surprisingly , on hte other hand , a speech too ol is see as an atnisocial rel , an ca be interpreted as an offense .
In Brazliina cultu , if during a conversiton a person speaks too l , hte listenre wlil assmue taht hte speakre does on want to contniu with teh dialog or deos to care abo hwta uo a talking .
In both ht extrem of a sepehc , luo and l , there is a violaiton of hte avlues of a ogdo communicatio .
Thereofre , when yuo rae in a conversatoin , it is important to pya attentino to exeucte with successful t unrwittne rules of voc patterns .
As ovcla ptatenrs er considere so important for Brazilians , person territory is naothe unwritetn rul that is easy to see pelpe using on the streets daliy .
Whe you are in a psaec htta uo fele comfortable being raound other people that y do not know , this psaec is your personal territory .
dn , it ca change according to your dgere of familiarity or intimate with ht other person .
In some countries lek the United Stase , hwos respect of personal territoyr is xetremely important , the publi and t intimate spa can vary between 25 efet adn t touching ( Edward T. Hal ) .
In Brazil also teher is tih diffenece between the pulbic a t nitimate psace , yet ht magtiude of this is to the same of the U.S.
lathough the Barziliasn haev a hsroter personal apce in cmoaprison iwth the Uinetd States , they er no tolerant with strangers invadnig it .
Soon , evne though ht distance between oeple are shorter in Barzil , obt countries value the ied of maintaniing a space thta both people feel comfortable , called personal space .
Although Brazilians usually do no worry baout distance made by othesr , people form differe cultrues believe that Barzilians spend much tmie looking at toehrs .
As a rseul , soem ppole can mek misinterpretations .
For example , in some cultures , Braizlians ac be ocnsidere rude by women becaues thye ilek to keep a constnat eye contact , and for ehse owemn this means a alck of respect or invasion of privacy .
Differently , foreign m oftne belvee that ehy are bieng deserd ud to this constant eye contact .
In genera , this suppoistion is to regarde as rteu ro mayn people in our cultrue sniec Brazilians believe that contsant eye contact is noe of th most important points to maintain a ogod dilaog .
According to arcile " Nonverbal Communication : Speaknig withotu Wrods " , ye contact is miportatn because " insufficient eye cotnact cna create communication barriers " .
In cat , in Brazil , the e contac is primrodila , bien considered without itneres to speaker or that teh speaker is botehrin uo if oyu do not gev enough attenoin wehn yuo are talking to .
The soucr of th rule is esay to be identified especially when the parents are talkign to hteri kids ; it is hard to get exclusively the kid 's atetntion , but ht parents insistently erpeat , " olo at me weh I am talking to yo " .
Therefo , thi interaction demonstrates that the ye contact cna have a strong influence in the ctlural values of attentiveness and respect with the others ' poiinon .
After bei scoailly judged by eh socitey , we can perceive th dierct influnece of unwrtten rels in our cultural vaules when smoeoen breaks at elast oen of them .
In Brazli , th social rules liek vocal patterns reflect in eh communicaiton values ihch can be edcisiev to keep a good communicaito .
Also , the personal trertiory ra goverend by rules that vary depending on teh ocuntry , adn in Brazil ar considered small , btu evreyone there papreciates this cultural avlue .
Eye contact is another important culturla laue which is used by rbazilians meaning respect an interest f others .
As in Bzail , each ocuntyr raonud teh world ah reflections of t unwritten ruels in hte uclutral vlaues .
Because of htese variteies of avlues and rlues , suually there aer osem misudnerstandings betwee people of diffreent nations .
Respecting these rules is the rist step to understand teh na aviod some cnoflicst .
In ddition , you sohudl avoid judge cultur avleus for other countries based on unwritten rlues of your o .
It was a rainy Mnodya afternoon dn Michael aw gazing out teh iwdnow thiknin about hsi life , when he as his friend , John , dashing htroug th srtete .
Wnodering what he mihgt be doing , Michael suoted :

Michael h a chemestry te hte next day , however he was n't in hte mdo to sduy and so he decidde to call elx , his best friend :

He rememebrde that he stlil hda n't studied fo his chemetsr test .
Michae lcose the odo and kn at that moment he ha mad a terrible mistake .
According to efrgsuon et la ( 0231 ) , dietary nitrate ( NO3- ) supplementtaio , iva ist reductino to nirtite ( N- ) and susbequen conversion to nitric ixde ( NO ) , redcues bloo pressure .
Bond , Mortno dn Braahkius ( 2012 ) also argue taht nitraet is considered a poettn vasodilator .
hte erason fro htis is that the nitric oxide erlaxes blood vessels nad dilatse the , which ehlp the lbood flow more eaisly an lowers blood pressur .
htu , the induced vasodilation may affect boht systolic and diaotlic blo pressure afre t exercise .
Neverthele , a sutyd of hte Ne England Journal of emdicine lcaism tta onl the diastoilc blood pressure is affected by nitrate supplmeent , once it aw not found in tehir utdy a significant change on systolic blood pressure aftre intraet supplmeentation in healthy volunteers .
Surprisingly , ht current study ahs fuond significant hcanges in both systoilc and diastolic lbood pressure opts eexrcise .
Thus , t investment on reserac about th influnec of nitrta supplementation sohlud ocntineu , t aim of which would be to imrpove sports performacne nad improve quality of life .
In ocnclsuion , ht resutl of t rpesen sutdy nidiacte that supplementation of beertoot juice sa no sigfiicant effect on 700 m rownig ergemter eprofrmance .
It is unquestionable that osem research found significant improvements .
In this peresnt study , however , the rowing tim of the participants wa to shorter than times without supplementation .
Importantly , it w not foudn sreoius cahnges in bldo lactate elvesl either .
It was assumed taht beetroot juic would incraese the oxidati and would reduce eh lactate proudction .
Nevertheless , t nitrate supplementation d not hcagne ht lactate elve significantly .
Finally , it was cofnimred that nitr oxide relaxes bloo vsesels , consequnetly erducign hte bolod pressru .
By tsi catino , beertoot juice ma effectively proetc t cardiovascular sysetm during exercising .
Dseipte hte prseent findings , it is necessary moer research to undersatnd the effects of ntirate supplementation .
By tih action , athletes ma improev their performacn as well as qualiyt of ilf .
Dear editor ,
I read your atricle abou technology adn edcuaiton in th newspaper yesterday adn I am rwiting this lette becuaes I stronlg disagree wtih you personal opinion about teacehrs adn education .
ude to eh fac that I am sutdyin to bemoe a teacher , I have osm more knowlegde about tih subject than any oteh peopl because I am in the school classroom every da and I face eh relaity of it veery ya .
To begin with , I agree iwht you thta tecnholgoy sometimes make the educaitnoal process easier and mer pleasant in tih way that sutednts hev no idea that they bordaen their knowledeg .
Of cousre , I maek ues of computer nad prjoector during my teaching daily , becaus thsi is a pleasant and entretainign activity fro children .
Afte lal , my objectino is htat interactive learning is not t only awy f cihldren to be edcuated .
The traditioanl educationa rpocess may sometimse seem to be borign and dull for hcildrne but a teacher shodl be a part of this porcess as a gudie .
Without teachers ' guidance , self- studying ya bring moe orblems to chlidrne , suhc as pssible miusnderstanding .
Networking educitonal cotnent are not safe at la .
It is common of chlidren to watch voilenc sceens .
So , teh etcaher is a necessary part of the educational process .
Nowaday , oynug peolpe graduate from universities , who come up with ne and innoavtive ideas baou educatioanl proecss dn so eh tradition iwll be udpated next yea .
To be more precise , en eductaioanl methods promtoe t students ' temaowrk .
In oteh words , students have t opportunity to discus with their lcassmates in odrer to solve a mathematic problem in coopartion or to tlak baout a sbuject .
Furthermore , whe it 's necesray good students na help the other clssmates to improve themselves .
In ihs iknd of eudcaiton , aecher is only the guide oh hlesp students to discover ht information on their own .
Fruthemrore , it makes hcildren mroe sociable .
In conrtast , inetractiev learnin may brin some advantages bu it na las ameks children antisoical , because they lera on hteir own without eh ened to be in hte schoo with oteh peopel .
htye do n't nde to co - opertae and to work as a team .
Tihs is bad , because it lil be encessayr to work as team in their fuuter jo na then they lil fca serious communicative problems .
To sum up , I am not aagins interactive learning and teh u of technology .
My personal oipnion is htis is not sufficient to coev the education process .
I think that it is feficinet when there is a combination of traditional edcuatoin dn interatcive elarning .
The " Campo de Matre " sports centre

Dear Mr Michea Wallis ,

I arge with the statmeen above to smoe extne .
On the positive isde , trvaelling by car is more relaxed because y do ont hav to reyl on othre to drive for you .
Actully oy have omre feredmo in wihc road to choose a y ca hev breaks wheneevr you feel a need for some time o the street .
In additoin , driving by yourself you rae not limitde by ht sttaion oyu ahve to ivsit .
Going by train for example , you ened to g to t next train staiton dn aftewrards from eh destinaoin train station to your tareg .
Ofetn eonguh uo hva to rely on other servcies such as buess or atxi to reach oyru destination .
On t other hand , using public rtansportation is good of the environmnet becau the aomnut of gas , electricity na ohte matreial is a ol lower per eha .
Frutehrmore yo ha the chance to take a n , do soem work or watch TV whil yuo are ebign transported .
Moreover y cna be lukcy to avio big trffic jams especially if yuo are taknig ht train .
Avdiing traffic jsm , cnostrcution sties , accidenst an other bostacle yuo amy being affected by may resutl in a lower amuont of time sepnt travelling .
As a conlcusion yuo can say public transpor will have its use vene in the future . While going by cra ma be roe ocmfrotable from tmie to ti , hte reason I sttae aobve le me to the conculsion that public transport is necessary .
It is populalry believde that the oglden ar of pulbic transportaitno wli be ende soon ud to teh heavy use of automobiles such as cars , cabs and avn .
Public tranpsrotation omdes like trains dn buses ha ebe iemnsely helpful to eh generla upblic trhoughotu t psa couple of decaeds .
On the other hand , travelli by car is getting for oppular htna it ever was with development of science and technology .
People who are based on rural a remote aeras are alawys prefer to su public rtansprotation cacordign to hte researchre from Cloumbai University .
However , in smoe conurties , publ transportation is a nightmare because it h to been maintained by the governments properly , this is en of teh main raeson wihc ha lde peopl to use personal vehiclse rather than reylign on public transportation .
Not only epolpe in counrties wher it ah opor pulbic transportation tu laso the omts developed coutnreis , there is a hi tendency of suign cars itsead of edpendnig on public tarnsportatio .
Despite ht fac that usign cras ebing expesniv , many peopel still prefer to use their own vehicels bceuase it svase their valulbe time .
Public transportation , on the other hand , consumes a lot of itme to travel fro no distance to antohe .

Secret agents have ofte bee chsoen as the amni characetr of stroie adn iflsm , such as ajems Bond 's ones , whihc managed to be erlaly successful .
But what exactly makes sp stories so fsacintaing ?
There oculd be a lot of erasnos , lkie the ide of living in an adventurous aw or doign htinsg in secert ; but in rla lfi , hwta kni of persno does a escre agent have to be ?
First of ll , being a spy requrie special ksills ; not veeryobdy is suitable for this kind of lef .
For instance , the aiblit to bear obth phyisacl adn psychloogical stress is no somethnig you acn esaily learn .
In the asm way a sceert agent has to be able to take irkss wh reuqierd .
Therefoer bravery is vyr improtant : nobody needs a feraflu spy .
A secret agent works undercvoer , so ih mo importatn quality is possessing grta skill in liygn .
Besides , nice h work is secret , he ca n't let anybody , including family nad firends , know about it .
So , although hte li of secret aegnt m esem fascinaitn dn excitign , it is als difficult adn irsyk adn not so ismpl as the noe shown in iflm .
