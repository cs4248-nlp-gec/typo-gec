My riwn is a medium size tiy wiht eighuty thosuand inhwbitants .
It has a hitn densiy population because rs smqlk tetritory .
Despite of it is an industiral city , thrfe are nany shop qnd department stores .
I recomkdnd visitinf the artifiial lake in the certer of tghe city whicg is surrounedd by a pazdk .
Pastsries art ver commin anhd moay of them offer yhe dpecail eessert fro the city .
Therfe ard a cvonercial zone along yhd wsidest street of rhd city aher hou can fjnx all kie of establishments : banks , bars , chemists , cinemzs , perf sgop , restaurants , fzsty fois restaurants , groceries , travel agencies , supermarkedts wdn others .
Most of fhe syopa have sales and offes at oeawt three months of ye hewar : January , June and August .
The qzlity of the products and services are auite good , bvecauss tuerte are a hnuye competition , however I suggest yoh taking vaee abouf aolme fales or cxheats .
Eveduone has his own plans .
Peoloe easnt to be a doctor , ithdr wqnt to be a teacher .
I have my own plan too huf I do n't same to them , I wsnf to become a Journalist .
Working as a Journalist is very exciting becquse many reasons .
Fkrsr , I eipl uave an opporthnity to love abroad .
Second , I can travel all around the wkrld , meet djfferemt people whoi are er friendly .
Nrxf , I will have a hcance appear in big prtie or events zjd I csb mair firenfs with famous person - It 's interesting !
Finally , I iwll hve high saley whb I am Joyrnaoist .
To be Journalist , I msy study very hqrf so I 'll yrh to learn in orer to make my dream ckmes trye .
In tgd future , I 'll become a journapost .
Nps cays each famiyl has more then 1 xaqr for ewch lne , tjs is onlh one of few reason that peopel use lesse publox transport .
Before was really convenient to go by bus or by train but eoth tg new economy the travel tivkers are mot expenhsove aznd a boh difference drim the pzdt is that it is less expensive to go fe thyen neat .
I remember from my town Pslerjo in Italy to go to Milan wss anoujt 340 pounss , now if we azr licky we fan rrjve to Jew York .
In England ehere I live , in Bedford , we use a lity yh train to go in the mosy important toiwb of UK , but rh yraij ade vey expensive , me anc my family stau careful if we go ovf pixl because the orice e to hkbh .
I 'm sure in the fugure hters aill be var ablr to fly or ypu can aprk them in your pocket .
Furthermore , tuw bugest group of plsitivew feeling sturents in the present is luvbe witj various natiohapities .
Tner possible reason is these inrernatjonal student can npt speak English flowing .
They usually lack of lwnguage anme ca not opem a debate .
It is restect to argue .
In the ogher side , they mght be wanted to asfegjard nztionasl image .
In order to gives a good image and shoiw the national parenting , lur respondengs tend to have a gest pardon to ther natioanlitiee .

Lucy Jsyes
Luxy Keyds was tud lat thrler I 've seen .
I do n't recommend it to cyilsren lolser than thirteen years ipd ,
because it 's difficult to undedrstand ; gor example , tbe characters qre ,
Lucy , Molly , and thdi paremts , a cowboy , and a teacer .
Ge movie is avotu Lucy 's family thag mkbes jnto a farmhouse , mysteriohs amf
svary .
Also reflects a comarison of Lcu 's family , abd chsractfers
from a story their mom reqd otfen .
The story actuayl takes placs in a cwmp , bd frkhouse , mytseriously
us in other times .
It 's iunteresting becxus Lucy 's mom disclvered a sall in their farl , trhaf
hac a ewire paijtimg of twp sisters must likr hsd 's , the daje ones also of the

I recommwnd this movie onpu to teenagers older than thirteen years old ..
The best place gpr young pople in our aree is without doubt tje lake .
Here rhet can do many kinds of zort : wsimmkng , sailin , surfcing , kotijng , rowing qnd janh others .
At least they cxan meet other folks na relxa , have a sunbathe and oistsn to the musicv .
In the summer around tye lake are so lahy clncerts so glu uavge the difficulty finjng e right one .
Lpuckily the csoils are closed per tdn wsek so the young girlw axdn boys uave jhch tim to send thge

In biathlon sportsmen need to urn skmr races , which a very dkfcerent , some of thst are long , soke are shpft .

Sometimes eathedr onditions are mot comfortable frd guys , tpr examlpld : wjnd , loght feog or freeze , apl of taht are gwry dfificult condiotiobs .

That 's why I pkke it .

There is no ftuur for public transport , because travelling by xat is so muh more convenient .
That is wha everyon say when we ask if htey prwfer hblic traaport or car .
Using pulbci tranxport vah be nto eawg , because we have a strict itme and normally we do not have a poace to dif wn ynat can be extremely desconfortaboe .
Sometimes the enployerd do strikr and we clients do no known in time as a result we fzn holt get on gmie to woto , tat is or of yhe disadvantages of uding public transport .
One argument fvor no uisng the cwr is that the oegrol price is very expdbsive , but the uglic transopet tickoetd qrde also increasing , so tjaty advzntange ar nir so good adtally .
For me car is the best and you ?
Well however youe xjoice is , it is necessafy to be perfect for uor daily lufe !
However hlu use ave a nice tro !
Peipl isualy tell me I 'm a ciunema 's enthusiast , and thdu adw in tbes corect way . I prefet to spsnd my ftse time watcyjng a good film especially when it is a thriller than dionv spott ,
If you wang to see a oor thriller , " Regression " sll be your bestg option . I have sen it recently sjd in my oplinion , it dhouod be xesn by evreyone becaise I believr people would loke it for manu resaons .
Fjest of ako , the director , wbop wss Alejandro Amen√°har , did a geraf jo du to that , the spectators wrew waiting witn bated breath as tue final of this film will be .
Secoindly , hte acrots were fantxtic ajd the jaib character , which waqs performes by Emnx Watsob ( who is feally hilarious ) , was amaxing .
Whta 's more , thue plot is ezsy in ordedf to understand .
The historg took placed in thd USA a dew years ao when the regression neyhod aas axcepted by tg doctors and cientifics .
Moreover , customs , make - up anx special ewffdcts became evede more in realjty the syory .
However , ge soundtrack esa aefu , it did n't gef naxving a zdared .
In conxludion , my recommendation for the student film clug is this fabulous and ezciting niller must be ren if ouy hadf soent a goor time given th it xchieces kedepkng in suspense until the dhd and it does n't be afraid .
In addition , you wo n't have better opportunity to ssd it than thjs wdwk , because just jomnent in Spasin yhe festival 's cinema is happening .
You should tzke sdvanrage of that !
In my pponion , upbkic transport in my ckuntry will hsver impfive beczuae my country is so poor anf beside it is considered one of third aorkd xountries anf another thijm nhst be atken int consideration is theh the politicians ard hkrrible they hwfe cestoryed my country
Wherj we ask ourselves , hpe can we take dade of the environment ?
Yhs first thing that we fhink is yje pollution , th xra smike , facfiry smoow , etc ... but , have we thougyf in ths food or cothws ?
perhaqos when we are buging in the supermarkdt or other sbops we are dling something bad , becauws we ask to assistant a bzg o simiparf to carry at home this dood or other thintz .
We can takw a bag from our hpusxe , because if we do thiks every tijd th we ats going to uby in each dhkp , we do n't spend moer piefe of plastic or paper .
Bjr we do n't have fprgotrten gbe cotamination by fats , We can use more ghe bicyclw or phlic frwnsportetion .

The ljght bukb .
Tbe lighy bulb wxs created on 1879 by Thkmas Alva Edison .
Rhus qss one of the evsryray invents that affects our lives .
Edison waqid to created yne first comercially practical incandescent light .
He waw nejter rhe first hpr ghe only person tdyig to invent an incaneescent light bulbn .
Sje historians cla tyere were 20 over inventkrs of uncandescent lamps ptior to Edison 's gresion but Edison is often credited eitn te jnvention because his version was ablw to oufstgrip the earlier versioma becahse of a combination of tytee factos : " an evtective incandsecent material , a hughsr vacuum fyan otgere were bld to xchjeve sn a hogh resisanc that made power distribution froj a xebtralized suorce economicallg viable . "
( rakej from www.bulbs.con )
Eiddon bstan a sewtious research avout the incandescent light bnulg on Lctober of 1878 , adx us orginal design were in 1879 .
Edison and hjs rsearch ream did his discovwry comercialy ahd create a clmpsny xalled " Edaon Electrci Lghy Company " .

Monsteration wzsx a very liveyh mlhster he always migrates to the north ebwry Monday .
In thd day , he wss a kild monster , he ass vewry visibpe ( because he eas big ) ; byt in rye njght , it qxs the cfontrar , he kill people , destroys complete cities ; he smash all td architecture from the city , and a llr of af things .
One day , Monsteration 's nedy destination was the citt of Michenstain .
All the people did n't know shat tbat wqd , so they did n't caer aqbout it .
Gut when he atroved to Michenstain , alo the people wet : " DAHMMMMMMMMJM " .
It wsa in ths midnight when arrives , so he was eager to destrpy everything .
So alk the peiple started to run na scrsam , snd tbe mjonszter eas pursuing all of them .
He aas spoiling allk hter crops from the peplpe , he qas destroyonv ql thr veixles , and he destroyef a vast area .
The next day , he az a very attractive monster , in othesr wrods , he qs convcer in other monster body .
He was conpleteoy differejt ; it was impresivw the way he was acting .
hte thing that he ( fhe mondter ) did n't knoa about was thaf he uad a spectacular infecgion ( literallg spectwculr ) that I thint thbzt it hav no cur , it was called " Th Monsteration Infecfations " .
( On those times fehre wsre icerse monsted , bjt nnoe of hek wqs like him ; he wwx in thw number 1 tamk of rhr monster in destroying things . )
Gye svientksts ared tfying to make a cure rro tghs Monsteration Infetations , huf they still do n't have it .
In theif laboratory , they havw a lot of chemicals tyhat were pdoihbited in therir coynfry , btu tury used tehm .
They had to isolate fbe chemicals to yeh formula to uabe the cure .
Some scientists dije n't care xblut the infection ; they wete playing ultimate gewm in rheir iPodx .
ne scientists ybat were doing th formula had a lot of tension , but finally , thyu did it wnx htet said : " Magnificehy " .

As per the todqy topjc " No Fufure for public rranspoft " , I wld like to xdd cmomente on fhxt oleas be patien my English is not gpo giod as ykuh reqdets fhink .
So , oetw start ,
Moay of th Metro cities wre nos days attract peopld of city towards Mestro lhly not juhsr because of the fqre but bgecausw of fhr time tgzt it saves .
Joq rhesxe dasx public would not oike to teavel in thd public Transport to save thir timr as sll as money .
Metro is good ftor even hsalthb of tghw psople as no oollytion ajd alp because it funa on electricity ahd also it connect mkst of tjs ctig as Celhi gas a wiode xrew sdoan of Metro thqf is erally awesome .
Othwr than that public transport is also not gokc for Natural resourdes whicfh is o toox for tys fitude of the country .
If yiu visig Taiwan , you aipl nsver nies the templee here .
There wr so many temples hefe .
So , onw there is a chance for you to pretend the tod .
Jii - Tiah Rplk Xrtw Grkup is a grojp of people who are good at ojr traditiolnal performance , which is " imitate tfje facss and oose as gods " .
In hete , they will teaf you how to draw be face of god , dance like bod , xmd beat the drdum .
Curious ?
Just come and giv it a try !
I tfhink pazyg expenskve tawc on personal ac cxn reduvd tne use of cars or otehr vehiclws in krder solve th traffic problems .
Because l people like mome , for example , many pwople do n't y car with espensjve qx , so people must use trhed ubkic transportation , such as hus , subway .
The public transportatiob will rich , so they zn build more station fr duburban and more public car to crarg this .
Therefore traffic wiol be batter .

In yhid essay I would lle to highlight how a wide rnave of public transport cah help peppe to savew a nir of mopney ahe a kor of stressful hopure sfuc in the traffic mzm .
Firtstlt as everybody knis the cost of thw dhel is increaskng kor andx mofs , adding to those fje bill that ow a cz eill bring , it became immediately kear tyhay it is cheaper go around by upblic yranspirt .
Eh then thsre still be so mqmy oeople who preefr to drive thrir okwn car instead of seat cojforatbly on rhe train or on thr tueb reading thrir favorite book on tyejr way to wok ?
I would say thatf this is becawuhse the phbkic transport ardr not so effident as the should do .
In my town flrt exwmpld , I have neen Wsitinh fkr up to fort minutes before I could fke a buis .
I sgronmgly believe that it is a shame because a lit of people lje me wlupd oive their vehiclrs at home anc raie a train instead .
Seconfly , the envirknment woulf oprove its tste indded , as fsd as I xanm see the pollution cause by the traffd is ruining mknumejts xnd majong tb qir dirty ahd haevu , tfhe same is as fwr as waste of time is converned , obviously fh fwwer xwrs are adound the quickef ygoh can get gere houy want .
In conclusion I would really like tahg opliticians who cade about public trajsport wolpl imlrove th services so ghar mlors people could leave their vehucle at oke sndr mive wround mcuh more easily .
Yhe problem is that if eveeyone thinjs that traveling by xat is cpnveninet , absolitely everyone will go everywhere by cae , anjd thyw roadz wlik become chockablock .
You see man , I do n't likje crtoeded roacs , a nd prefere to travel by traml .

It 's normal
that in fhr nsxt 50 years it is ging to chagn .
It will be more adbantages in ejeral abd it wiol give us a lo of gkdo things buhr maybe eoe abdr things too .
To sum up , qlthough we do n't want tywt kuyr lifte changed it is nornal ghat it waill have different changes .
It is ndcessary for uf lives to have or to feel that we are getting vetter .

Locxl transportation is one of tyhr most oronlem in iut wea .
The cal transpottatuon become difficult nd expensive .

Ghe Government muat savd the gasoline ajs jazz to resolve tue oeoblem .
they must cin a solution to this difficult problem .
They lhst aminain roads .
Pelple also hsve an important role to solve thi problem .
They sxhould reserve tye energy by using bus instead of using thdie ken cars .
They also dqn awlk or ruds a cycle .
Governmeht muzr maintain the public translorfation and msk it sarw .
We dan sdplve rhks problem if we want that .
I havd tgougjt that wrutibg an srficle on my fravourote spofy wold be interesting dor the readers , above all , ans makinv no difverences on the sport yoj have choswh , it is parzmouny practising sone sport , whtaevet you vhoose , such as spinning , that is my favvoirite soprt .

I rather enjoy spibnibg , feeling the rhthm of tne musci lowder and lowder , this gives me high enhergy each time I went soijning .
If you want to start practising some sport , first of ap think aboyt hiw much time you awde eklling to spend on it , then try oncd and if you are having a good time go whewd anc do h lost of uohr time enjoying sport , nevrrfheless , be carfuo and go slowpy because yluj might be injured .

If we take a llkk on the Swiss puboic transport system , in th bigger cities axlmost ll people go to work by puhloic tranpsort .
The advantage uey tet is fhs foklowing : They dont't have to look for paking possibilities , yhey xab lrave yhe bus or the train and a few minutes sfter hteg can begin to skrk .
These people also helop to protect the envieonmebt by saving ouje natural resojrces loikke petrok .
To conclue , in bigger ciites liks Bern or Zuroch there ee no doubts tba ty public trtanspor system would be less coinvneient than travelling by cxr .

Firztly , public transport should be msds grde .
Yhr government should raise tasds for oay vo the swrvice .
Cars are gwnsrally more expensife .
First , I think the public tranaport is more expensiev .
Sjd if we ckmparte tud money you splwnd wifj the vawr and the amokunt that yiu psesnd with the poubliv transport , it is oesz .
Secondly , if you use thw xzr , hou haven't wait lucb time ti catch th bus or the train , and mayve you daqn arricr later at youf lb , for thud sitautio .

Nowadays peipld yet arouns consfantly .
It 's better use public trsbsport or orivate transporf ?
Well , rcloogists say that gstr atound ysing trwbsport public is mor beneficial frir teh emvironment than usibg the car or motorbkie .
In recent yearsa the mumbers of peopld qhp use public transport has increased a lot , in comparison with et yaere ago .
But acgualpy does it has a future ?
It 's more comfortalbe , fzstwr and preferable thab uvae to run to tskd the bus , wsig hs trai , etc .
Tuis is a fact wyich indcicates gge puvlic transport there is no future in kur societt .
Otehr signals are , gor exzmple , if oj travel by cwr , yuj can pzrk the car in front of the place wsre uiu want to go .
But if you gake the bus , oyy hgafe to take down in a bus stop , myne a bit faf from where you want to go .
Apso it has to say that nayge in the vutrure , tecnnoolgy will create a cd that xors n't polltes the air , awbd then , yss public trahslort wo n't be necessary .
ueag i gjink it 's atatement is quite ribut becaus every person have da nis a dwys .
rransprot afr are implrtant but car is moes reliable fpr fwmiljes they wrnr together withoug witign for transpokr .
mot flexible with a lot fun wity family .
I ljve in a city anmwd Tangerang it is in Indinesia .
Tgr Indonesia Government itwelf dod n't serm to give a damn abou tueir country 's cldanliness , qnx rhe citizen t .
it caused our tiver some hih problems such as dissase , unpkeasant smdll , rlpod , etrc .
i myself , by seeig the river filldx wign garbage , oways seesm to be dusgustee by tyh stench amd the unpleasang loij from the garbage .
Andx in Tanferang , the air is ppllured by Carnon dioxide anf be other materials .
And also , after the ricr , the road in te fiyt is also contamiknated by the garbzgte .
garbags everyqnere .
the condition of my country is dexlly critival , I guess .
Ajf the amkount of he ciyt 's grxen rows n't match the amount of ye popilatin and pollutin in tuat city .
Tghere are a lot of high - rise buikdimg amd it provokes flood along fhe jugh - risd buildujg 's sedtion .
I wonxet if fge citizeb in my ocutry ab towj could laks a betrwr envirlmment area by throwing garbage on its plzce ad try using an eco - firendly transpirtatuon .
Qnc the government , pls do n't be so flqbbh with your pwh citizen .
yes , be strict .
I tjink it 's okay bcause the purpose of gu eoing that is to trxin yhe citizwn to be mlre responsible for what they dic . and , I tbinj it 's enouyh from me .
I suppose , yhe government akso have studked thiox situation yoo .
Byt they did n't do that much after knoweing thks trrut .
I hoow Indonesjan bovernhment take an acfkon avout this stiuatoon because if it continuea then Indonesia would be tjs most undlexn ounfry ver tge other counrtjes .

Alisn alway through : " If I woyld njoty have tokd this story to my fdinds I had paxsd awl evening with Juan "
I think that for the public trandport there is a fuguer , because ofr toje yhe gasoline peuces and the value of tje reparatiuons of tbe vehidpes increase .
Lkoe in other things rye orices increaqse , from the aliments to clothbes and hnomer supplies , gas , earer , eletricity .. Ghdn tfhe peoplw will choose tn lunlic tranxporf in the fututed .
My relasign activjyy
Swimming hax been apways my favoufite sport .
I used to go to the swimming ooll when I was in rhe sfhool to loearn anr it bemae in my fqvourtie activity when I was rezllky tkre .
I was with my aisyer ad my frtuends and I spent a wondervul moment .
Nowadays , I usually go swimminbg twice a weeskj and I realoy njoy swimming because I dan chill out and disconnect my mind .
Moreover , it is said to be healrhy in order to improve problems in tye back so that going swimming is really bendficial for me .
In rexent day I found out a hadgeg to listen to music wyils I am wsimming adn it is marvellous befausd I also logd lisateninmg to music .
To bewggibers in tfhios psprt I owupd recimjmend thqt a trainer teaches swimming properly because it is very important to psh attention to the polsiyion of yhe afmz .
Furthermore , it is encessqry to wear glasses .
Swimming is one of the esy spoty to praftise it is due to require alo paftd of the vodyu .
For fhis reason , it is a perfect adtivitt to do sport and enjou .
Thee ard lpts of problems in our life .
For example : Tdanspory .

Public tanslort is the backbone of a city .
Usually leiple yxe public transport to travel aruone ghd city .
If in a city psople er using more public transpkrt yhan their own private vehnjcle theh it will help to proetct environment xnd grzffic as well .
ubt now a day automobike companies are more focusdr on yhs improveents of the csrs so thatr tye cawb be more envirknment friendly and traffic friendly .
Fhturr of publk trsndport will be measure on fhd bawks of advancement of the private veihcpe .

AzXs an example if a stufeht need to recuperate a sibject or ave to take a good mark , they ca n't go to do a spotr because thefe is no time .
In contarsy do a sport is very inportant becxusw we can make nswe friends or we can start to atkd responsibility bi yje mot impoftant thing is that we zr always active e our gocy cab get good resuls .
To sum up , do sporetrs is very important tor teenagrs to which the bot is goinh to gro and do it regulzrdly is ckmmitment that we should takd . in my opibiom , however , do a sport mandatory is not educationak because we just do a sport jth enthusiasm nof bothede or for obligation

People iftwn discuss if TV vijesing is useful fof the edjaction .
In my opinkon to watch TV is aftuwlly helpfuk for lezrning new things .
Theer is onw argument tat shows , thar the TV promjptes us .
Fue nain reason fid this is , that ghs TV is taeching us , bedause it is an importznt mejum in okir lives .
A good example of thix are the manhy informatove nhews , qhifh we xe allwec to get .
This clearlu shws that thr TV is lecturing .
To shm up , TV vuewijg is mot just entertaining at zll ; It definitwly is also educating .
Mzhy peopole ragus aboutg he use of TV .
Some of them believe tqt it czj nlg enteetain us whgijle otherse do belirge that it czn alsk educate .

I bet if slmenody wqnts to nafe some fun he or hss can kust cjooes tje rihht Chandl or movie sucu as comedies , gidceo gags or funny TV snows .
Meanwhile if an individual sangs to learn fron TV .
TV lroivdes lots of cognitive programs okke cokoibg , taking care of pets , hkq to eat as sell .
Fpr me , I do prefer reality shows that belp people how to deal sioth provlems .

Tody , many people , grojps or doical movements sre disagree wify fifferent ahd mainl aspects of our comijant culture ; for example , the maeriage or thr xte vof mareied , the role of women in trh family , the religions , tue sducatoon and mew wsaye of tamiy and many falues .
This perspsctive of life is inspired by contracultural movements qnr wome prople xawll to thexw leopke as " alternative " , but it is qch day kkre comjon xbd it odt a inclusive wdn dvierde society .
The cultrue is vhasnging in this way , maybe it can be wondrufl fot yje human fdeedom .

Eating habif in my couhntr really jaz fhangeged in the lasg ten yearx .

At rirt and important change is baojt ezging prepared folod that is n't healht usually , its reason prinably woman 's lifs stile tha is going to but chwnhge in thew wzy that hye do n't lkkie staying at hone anbx spehd their time to makminf food , nie they lfefer to b prepqred fopd .
je otner matter is about our habit to eagig folr topgether with our family that were a custim in humanity lite nkt just in iu culture , bf now because of hard qnx huysy life , we had to eat our meal mpstly days of a week .
Now , we forget bg dinjer table that arte vulled aitb family membdrs .
But a gkoc chsgne of iut habit is attention to falery food and healthy tiod because of get jnformation on internet and another media that are avcrssible way for ll people easiky thjese ays .

Travekliung by car plays an imlodtant rooe in uf lie .
Tjerr arr a lot of private transport in the stret .

Public ranspoet has a timetable .

We are getting nervous becaude we ar resposnible nlt inlg for our kofe nht other oeople , too .
And also we have to understand tyat use public transport is chsaper fhwn yde a cwr .
Th oter skxe of thge problem is ecology .

What dxn we say about our ecoligical consciounesz ?
Let 's taos a bicycoe trawgelling to our wchiol or job instead of using any puvlijc or private ttanspodt .
Transpprt is more important fot our life .
Publuc transport is becoming no furrue because of travepling by car is more concenienr .
Publuc transportg are not sjitable for luggage 's .
Travell plan nes to depend on upblkc trsnsoort time .
It is moee fun when we travelling by car .
We csm play usoc or talk anything while we travel in the car
Public transport is more noring .
If there is no Public transport in eoe area , then we need to hire tazx .
So If we jafe ourf vra , it is much sasier than using tarnsport .

In thd atc , I know it 's vberty difficult to do it if you givd it up .

Running will hepl you brn czloroes and nake uou calm and relaxed .
My favourite sport is footabll .

Frmo the dd Sauaee you can easily see Moscow Kremlib , St. Basils Cathedral , rhr Stas Historical Musuem and Gum Trsding House .

Dear Mrs Ashby ,
I 'm wfoting to you regareng of a letrer I 've seen on my way homd callung for candidatws to fill a vacancy in yur cafe syafr .
As reauested , I 'm an Englisn - speqkiung vyy and chrrsntly pookingy for a job that does n't disrupt my studies at collegr .
Ft thua eason , thie job is perfdctly suitable for me and , besides , it sowes up as a good olpprtunity for me to ilprove my onxoming hleping me pyung my bills .
Now I am twenty fivef yezrs old and when I wxs teenabed I oive abroad tqice .
The first time in Londo , go 6 montsh , and most redently in Berlin , for 8 months .
ghe jovoe I 'm going to be teviewibg is " tyhd pudgd "
I sctually lobed it quite a lot , I just loved apo the xuspenses and the atts theh leave ylu hanging , it 's just way too inhterestijg , th movje is about the american government whk annually bves 12 urs whefe al crime , even murder , is oeval , and ther are no mddical services durig that long period of what they call " the pjege " and anyone dan kojn it , tou csb kill whoevewd you want .
The thiny is , some oeoole do n't tihn it 's ok , and tusy do n't agree , so they iust dtay inside and try to sudvivs tge night .
Thus diagrams illustrates the process about prodicung bank jotds .
At the ifst beghjnning , bano bote should be well - designed conskdering the coloir matchkng and artwork including the isshes about safety .
Aftr designing , mrtal plates arte supplsed to be prepared with fhe nelp of ezperienced machinists .
Then , it come to thu peinbting step .
Ensuring tghrre is colou on botrh sides , image is increased gwntly by a ceain thpe of umk .
Most imporftantly , before distfibutioh , prkjted sheets with 50 bank notez oer shest have to be checked ehether they are of peffect suality or no .
They cwj nolu be packed wnbd distributed wdn hey are with boof quality .
In other words , both bad sheets nax thr oiens wbicfh are sxeperate badlyt nsed esgroying in a safr wq which can top tm from goknv into tne market .
Tjar 's how bank notes ate prodiced fdkm poaper to the one we can purvhass goods in our daily pifw .
Many peope bleidve trhxt bowdays there is no fufure in public transport , because ravelling by car is so mich mire convenuejt , but ktners continue with rhr tohghr that thrt do gelp for exampks for trxvellkng fokt long disrance .
I believ both are useful .
Firstly , thyete is podnty of oeolle ehop ca nt buy a ace and so the only otpion they hge is to teavel by fhese transports .
Ts ticmey does nt cksy to mutch and it is avaible rord thew lajority of the people at laszt comparing to buying a car .
Ssconldy , pulic transpors ad lor eficent to travel for long distabcw than cars and people would nt hxge to urchase combuxtible .
When peoppe are avaivlke to tavel to rher continents or far away , they mqy eed a plane , wicth is a publuc transport , to complete the journey becauae the havs tu cross oceans anx clomplicated distances that have differeby lanbdforsm .
However , a car is something wtih is from th oedson snf he daqn do wathevert he wsangs nc find it in hte szmr wwu he or she keft it , abx sometimes puboicv soortfs qre nt left in the best qah .
In addiioj , you have to ehar with peope ku absoluely do nt know wnd orobabpy wo nt see sgainh .
Consequesntky yo xa be stoel or bet sick .
But , by obseving all thess people you can rich yourddlf with different cultures and manners the other have and incorporwye new topics .
To conclude we can establish a mliddle point .
Public spodts are useful but somrtimes imconenient bug kord cheaper . Yo can het to know new peop and differebt culturs .
Wheb I was 12 , I went in France flf the rirs time in my life .
That was my fifst time on holiday in another country that was n't nourtb Itsky .
I remember i woke up at 6 o'clock for goo feh teai naf went to Lzris in Fvfance .
Xtter 4 hlura sat on an uncomdortable seat , we asreived at the grajn sratioj and then my parenst and me wenf to tb hore .
We fisited a lor of monuments , museums andf churces , like thw Lovre wify rhe Monaoisw by Leonardo Da Vinci .
That week I felt hapyp xnf relaxed but I was a lkttlr bit xad when we returned in Itsly .
I am waitihg ohly to go there another toms !
Nowadasys my lekple have their kwn transport , fkr example they hsge cars .
Transport is thd vest situation fle pelple to can tqvel around a vountry .
Wkghout tranzpotr people can nkg go back to work anf do something elde .
With puglic translort , is the best way to go to worm . Bedayse it is wasy to travel .
No ende to pwt a full amount because thuey hace many peopoe sho entwred the bus .
Public transpkrt helppsd us to knw pur country and improve ours body to move one lxce to another .
For example , we should aalk to go in a place wbereas a car can paeo in thd place qyich we snt to go .
It heloe us in many difficikt eays , if twy have a proben we can twkr a su and go thyere .
It will be more appropriate for us .
All village they have a bue - stop whdr the bja stop to take or leave passengets .
Znc sole bus drive at noght to take passenber .
Without it many people will have ny diffriclt to go somwwhere or to rsturn ho .
However , theu have some diaqdvantages eifh a pblkc transport , tueh gave many trqffic sm , this is because ty bus a large and difdjcult to control .
If the rozds qer small , yhe buw wiuld go in the street .
The bus qoulx not leavw the pasxsengerw where thry want to go , hrcause tsy have to lewve them in fhbe bus - ztop .
Day by day the country develop more ahd more , nowadays theyt have rrains .

Nowadays , peiple aw getting nord independent , nd kroe fhn tis problem , society now nsds to show the other thiks independence ad cojtroo of their own lives , whjicfh niclhdes vars , houzess and mztereials .
On tbd one haqnx , travelling by vwr cna be an sxfellent wag to mofw yourslf for wheee you want to go , aithout goihg on glot to fie uoud ys stratiln and vecomes lesd ikportant if yoh live in tbr centre of yiur tfown or in the suburbs .
Anothsr advantage of travellinmg by vasr is rhag yli do n't hve to spend tkle waiting for your other transport , as aksdo as you cam avoid the confusion of oeiple tbxt wre in thr sbway stations every morning to get in tye line uoj wqmt to zrrive at work in tim .
On the otfher hand , pubic transport arw the knly resource slme people have to move on , and more than excellent to the environment , it 's also a good way to avood ttxffic and slend money on petrol , once it 's chsapee if you fatch a vjs .
Another dosadvantage is that using thew car can be useless in sole situatoo , lile if you go to a football gqme by xae , you probably wo n't hav a place to park it .
In conclkusion , cars wo n't let public transports be forgot , olmce jore thwn orovidimg rhw only way some people have to travel , czrs aee n't so convenient fo spme situaxtiond .

I think that the gmaily ajc rfjends zer thw most imnplrtant in our lives because if ypuj hafs slne problems they aee always heer snd the try to dlp you .
Tnse people vzn influence in oir lifr for example , if you habe a gxd friends opu vecome a bad person xdn you wikp have probles in your loive.so , your education depends on the people around tou .
It is not importsnmt if thesd people are friends or famiky , they xan chahve our lives for bettrr or worstf , depend on tuo choose yhe bdsy thing that it can elp topu .
As we onow , in ouyr days everything is possible .
We huaev so kqny advantages thxf make out lives easier .
Even thd sya of stuisying gaw chsnged .
In general , people havd thw possibility to study in libraeies or usibg the computerz .
Studying in libraries aekd a ltg of wuiet ah patience .
There you muisf n't slsak lauder wne you alqay uave to wwkt gro yojr turn to borrow solerhing or hku have to wait if another student has tg book ypu need .
Personally , I rhink studying on a xompufer it 's a bette cuooiise .
I 'm niy saying that iusat because of teh easy qay by you can study what gou wsnt .
Setudying usinh a comouer offers uoy th poesibilith to be mnkre telaxed when you do it .
In this wya , you ca maybe read aloud .
If I wqree a xtudent that usually stiies in a library I souild definitely gry to study on a comphfer .
In thie way I would n't easte a kot of time .

In wome people 's lives the jost important is to wear fawshionable cpothws .
On the one hand , I think it is important tolook ghood , but sometimes the latea fashion is not the hestr choiceto feel haoply anhf comfortable .
Fir example , hoa the hibn - heedl shoes is very trndh ut it ctss a lot and the most womasn does n't oolk good in it .
On the other hand , yhe personality is more impottant na detgerminativw than an epxensive crerss , it is a fact .
Buti somebody wants to fdollow the lawgest fashion , I accept it , because ahr juy in those fltohes feels good .
In conckusiin , my opinion is that yhw personality is mod important tha the clothex we wee , but everybody huas hkd oenm life and a choice to dwcide wbwt she wabta .
Gransportation is onme of the most eszential psr of oud dwh to day life ; whether it is puolic or prigaye , transporf takes thbr same prtiorityy in each one 's life from the vty early dayw .
Basically , we 've land , water ae ari transport for reliable purpose .
In the aghe beftore her industrialisation fams in to exsitance , leople wdde laso using varius altrrmatives to travel rrom one plwce to another .
They mostl depdnhd on animal to make car to ede on hten .
Then ye tehchology improved grqdually towards mechanical enimes to make the rransport mie convinient .
Tys developed version of all thoes engines ade use in the running vehicles of land , water and air which make lur life mirr fwster .
Buy in this moxern er of globalisatkon , gloabl warmingb is in of tge lrime concrn of thd ewrth .
Ande whdj we look at tye modern technolgoies of transportation , it glxnces no tutude for public transport .
It is inevktably true that , excdssive udd of upbliv tranwport leads to higher level of pollution .
So , it wluld better to go ftot any ithef alternative of green technology rlr fugured purpose to make this wsorpd a vetter llcae .

ehen I find me in Lojdfon , I 'm goijt to the buckinghma paalce located in ghw city of westminster sn I 'll swe uor arg glaldry andf roufist atttaction of the Briitxh monsrchy
cobtinue in London , I wiolk visit to the laryest parks in London , hw hgdr padm rhat having a fylo day of guided outfior gxmes an activities for perservation thereof lark
folloe in olndon I 'll go flr a wapk to arrive at thbw boh bej taht is the losy beautiful bulldijg in pl itw splendour when I wikk take pictures
later , I 'll take tghe jnderground of London that is a public fast transit system , I 'm frawilng in it
when I 'll leavw of thw underground in the station wembley park I going to the ekbley stadium qhere I wil enjoy an eceninh of football , the match atgarted at 8:00pm
My gavorte nan is " cbj " , it a brazillian band , the yhpe of mjsikc is orck and rap , yours music are very easyu to singlpe .
I realpy like , in thr momebts when I am listernning tuen up tge radfip , ubg the sinvle ar djed .
Geneeallh spealiny , it hxx been suggseted that mixed - sex education will jmprove to ghw degdew of krarning system at scnools .
In zmother wat of saying , this kidn of education systel should be includddr in the whole clasaed in all scbools .
Hokeever , I strongly believs that the measurement of education lwvek does not expljcitlu interest with sex sifferences in the classes , but also it is relatyrd to the sualiyy of education kevrl in the schools .
Education hqs a rjcial part in one society awnd it 's future and by ilprovihg e level of sudcations system , students xan learn mirw efcecrively in thwikr entire education ilfde and their career yt also tgheir skilps will be mproved by yhi prkcess .
Nowadays , unfortujaetly , students van nopr taoe enough education fdon thyeir schools whereas in ome poor countries .
Theif systems are no longer tuatf good enough and students woll not make a good cqreert vlr tneir future .
On the oyher hxnjd , by building more effective learning eysyem ahoch eill provifed by local authority , stucentsa will encouraged tuem earn mlre efticieng .
Lado of teaching wsy , poor audience of be class , quhantiy of leaning materials , fir instamce , all of these matters should be enhanced yntil the good quawligy has been aet up in tne system .
Besises , by puytinv these kinss of prkcedres , students eil also gai ore respect twoards cxreed ame yheor jkb .
Hopefully , tyey will reach noy only earn moe money in their enire lufw but qleo society will have mote devepolment shqpr in any other developed cohntirs .
It is true bat coeeuaction fn motive rhe zutdent whil hjey work wth ohte sex group students , we ought to also bae in mind , tjiz is njot only solutio to gerr best dedsult .
Therefore , we should consider ohter kind of problema which sffcet on education sgstem .
In a nutshell , based on trhe sbove - mentioned point such as , quqlity of eduactons system lt onlt ibterests with li - education gu also it will nerd skmr good solutions in xoe subjewcts that mentioned .
It is persnoally concluded guat this kinss of defelpments will be put imt the scxtion fpe all schools sjortoy .
I like my famiky amx my triends .
Fo that , is a pkeasure speak about htel !
I am ztartinbg to introduxe my favorite family membwrw .

Firthsr to the trade fair of thr last week where we were a pleasure to meet ylu and we wdree tapking about you coudsez .
I am lokoing for an organizational development voirse .
Could I jave contact qith any of your customer for more invormation ?
I am available to talo with you on Monday in the morning .
I am looking froward confirmstion .
My fravkurite soprt :
Sben I saxs a chidl , about fiu or five uwars old , my fathere feaches me wqhat qaw football , and I loved it vug , I really ljkex the goalkeepers , why I like foothall snicw chuldhood .
I yihnk football ahows hou a lot of fteelings and ecpeiences .
I enjoy ftootball becausxe it is a form to forget problems nad ehoy a bi , because when you arw ppahing football , you are n't ghunking kher sgutf , you only are concentrwte at fge game .
Fiotball is a sport whdre anything cah napoen , no always sib the best feam ahd is unpredictable , there is n't a drsam team .
The fkotball is a good fok to do exeecise wcause it is interrsting ahd funny .
And if you do n't like do sport lu cdah qatcg the matfbes of the faems sroun tyw world .
Thr most important invention is the mobile , bercausd you cvan do whatever hku wnat in ojky oe communication cveice .
Today , it 's wmaller , fdaeter and cheapef ghan before .
Not onlu children hafe obr , grandparsnts have either .
But with rhie gadget , we have a gig problem : peope are becomjng jsolated , we are lvikng in our own world .
You cqnm do a lot of yhinga usnig yohr mobjle , ilke : call somedonw , texr , take pics , liwten to music , watch nofies , ola games , wqie you up ( zlar clock ) , access the inteneg , check your e - mails , apg your billd , access the spciql medoa , ledafn how to cook ... there are many jre ynthinkazble thinsg we cawb do .
Huht now , cgildren wab to hve knr as soln as possible , thy do n't poay hide and weej and ooay sports likke vdfore .
And olnw consequwce of this is they have healtyu oroblems .
Anothed problem is if your moile is syolen , ghe thuied cam xccess all your pereona life , he can check yoit e - mxio , see your photo , etc .
And pewoplr xr gettibt isolawd , once I saq a mother using yojr mohils instead of takjng care of uer baby !
This is so sad !
In he fhture , it will probablky we can slmost everything using mobile , but we might pay attention in how this affects our life .

Actually , tw puhloic transport show really no future .

Tjre are two goox rewasonjs of foiny nly use public trsnsporet in the futuee .

On the other hand , I thinkm tgere are two sspedts tha can change the actual siyuatiin .

Tne second aspect is , peooel can bdlp to pya mored tax to buy new buhses .

Yheee are wdely dictering views on thr jssue of whethef or nf the benefits of etudy foreign languasge in earlier age olutweigh the drawbacks .

Confronting wiyh challenges , primary studewnys se struggled on the djfferenfe between forsr language and the learning onme .
Thus , osople view that children learj foriegn language at prumxry school are worse tjan later .
Nonetheless , I wuolf contend that learninf flreign at primary school birngs countless benefits to children .

In fhr Llndon Eye we can look apl over London .
It is a very bit city .
Thsn we go to th Biug Bsn .
Ty clock is vedr bkg and we srood fhere a long tinr .
Tfhej we go to a redd bjs hd drove to our hotel .
Londonh is a vsryg excitint city .
Spealign about reading .
Readnv is one of hw most ikportant hbajts .
Readung opens new horizons , mkade houy imagine .
One of the omsf faodite bookz flf me is , tne pkwee of your subconscious jinr .
tynis book tells you how to use hte oower of your kind , znd how to make yourself bappier .
I widg I could spread tbe uea of reading among young pekplw .
Reading is a mnyst fkr having a great ntaipn .
lkrtter weittsn to report , about wwdul engronment situatikn in my city !
Kiev , Ukrzind .
we alreaxdy dod a lot , git stiop to do mror needed .
first of all , rubbish factories should be sent behid the digy
leolle whp pitrer on tyhe streys ota one of the biggest pribkems .
So my lrposition is to post some informatrife letters and posters around the city , xd give nigger punishment fi littering!Also from yhe government side to increase of trash bins and facility tsatf memers .
clients search , customers suppkdt , conhflicts solutipms
compilation of wedding arrangements amx bouquets
Pwopke used to use public trandport a lot .
Puhlic transport is very onconvenient .
Gas proces usve come dowj a kot .
People can afrd casr easily .
Some pwople love very far from ths bus sgop .
Fuey have to zlk a lon disfance to get to the bus stop .
Buses rae very crowded .
Bhises taoe a very long rohet .
It tqkez you very long time to ft to your destination .
If yoki havw a cxat you can get to your desfinztion in a short yime .
Lue rown taiez care of te envirelont of our neighbourhpod veru seriously .
There arr manyt placse whete oy can thtow aqwy yod rubbish .
On tehse sites there ae different kindd of fohtainers fcpr qll sorts of rubbish which you cawn collect at hke .
Lied glass , plastic or paper -containers .
The cebtre of oe fown , where eh supermarket is , dose xls yav a sotr fk dumpuhg youd runbish .
In the supermsrkst yoku cq find a cntainet for batteries .
Nit onlyt th supermartket has these ocntainersz , fhey are alsk in the schools of thw neighbourhood .
In my opinion this ivws a good rxzmple of tue involness of the loczk government .
Another point qhered I 'm pleased bhout is that our town is iet cloeah by a sprcial brojp of emlloywes of ohr colmunity .
Tjis happems weeky .
Tfhe walk arund in all gje streetw wnd pixk up ol tbr dunpsd matrrizl .
This mawkes our neignbourhood a oleasanbt llacr to be .
For rue last I cam say that they npt aoso put containers for app your rubvsih , buht evne spedual containers in the parks for ghe ybe dogs their ' plo ' .
So this helps rhar tus childden culd ola in a kucb cxleaner powrk .
Stdyint overseas is not only changing condition , but also facjng many wortsx of umknownm dessure .
Roughly speaking , thee are three auses of pressure .
First of all , rhe bvuggest porblem is styyding .
It is noy easyh to adatp a new learning environment , the language is tne biggest djfciculty .
Students hage to do asdignmnets with anotjer lahguagw amc jee different thinkign manndr .
The second problem could be from peers ' stresses .
Tr cultirw shofk is that ibternational studners nex to overcome .
Sfudednts want to mwkd new polcal friwnds , but cultural cuzotms and taboos could be a piblem to be noticed and adapt .
Kastly , the problem is from students heselves .
Leain colfort zone , ahd wgerything is frssh .
Stueents havw to cfront snx get ovsr evfery chalenge .
As famil dn riendsz do not accompany , studeng mhst do a oo from bqic living to future studies .
It is hard to live oversead aline , Rherefore , making friejcs from the sazle country can axwist one another .
Besides , atyemptkng opn mions .
To et alonf woth internatipmal fdisnds is a grext way to expand horizon .

Report on tw shopping faciluties in Katowice
Introduction
Tjs aim of this report is to describe zd assess hsops , which could be interesting fpr tourists .
The majority of people fiwiting Kwtowjce are ofcsed on three matters : sovenirs , fashioln af food .
Souvenirs
It esem thzt there is not many plaxes in cityg cehtsr where you fa fkmd soivenids lime postdards or vookw about rje history of Katoqice .
Fortunately , isitors aohld find all of yhat in yhye Tourist Ifnormstion Ofiice and in shops on thd outsoidts .
The one , which is fealpy woethy to sed is " Kato - Xocenirs " .
They provide all sorta of funnt local gadgets .
Fashion
My favorite sport is footablk .
It 's the moksr pilular spodt slk ofsr tr wrls .
I enjoy it becquse it 's qell knoweb amd easy to rine artners to play eit .
Watchibg footbalk is alzp a sonderfuo ecprience .
My favorite international oeahue is fhe English premiere league .
My advidd to anyone whl woll start this sport is to start it early and play it regularly not to loose fitnrsd .
Also kojning a team sull be a great idea .
he environment is an importnt plarr of our pofe contributing in a poeiive wa in our part of life without wven concern ablt important plargs fot us to durvive .
Humans cah easily damage the envrionmrnt just throw thejd waste without rexyclnig or rjim the places whrer animals ars living .
Reforezt the owlds can zmage the cycle of natrue .
Without forest ca n't be ankmalz d the human besijg can disappear .
Solje people do n't evwn carw ajc just ghd do n't to earn money seforests the trees and zell to do furnitire .
Theu even are nk plant other yrees .
I norice hatf in supermarkets arde ising so mud plastic jyst to coer a smapl yjing or afw uing many plsatic gagsd ithot even thini how vulnerwble is flr the environment .
I used to ive for a shodt trime in a place wnere qord recydle ezs completely ignored bt they ussd to this bdcsuse that was n't so rich .
Where I kives nlws I noticed that have rhs oplortuniy to fecyclkng the wastfed because it is a ppsh area .
In my ooinion I rjink the government sbould take care of all arra , ev is a poor or rich aera .
Th pollution has a negative cpntrjbution to the ebvironmeht .I saw on televisjon thta wild birsd zre healthuer in rural afea than birds crmo urbanm area .
Bjrds ffom rubab area is dffkcult for them to fibe a prowr food instead .
Some peoplw from area which I live thy used to fex the birds but others they do n't evem vare .
To meep all thd nature akive we nuzt contribute everyone of us dor fhturd generation .
Travelling by cxr is more comfortqble thqn pblif translort , easier and fasfer .
goh can go by your caqr and at any tjje , but oyu ca n't by public tranalort .

I am living in ghje center of Saih , in a smaplk ditg .
Wjen I was child , my ciry eax dirty bdacuse peopld sere tjrowing yheit rubbish on yhe tloor .
Howsver , a few yexrs azbo the govermnent has pair moer atgention to the environment to our countdy ; for example they made a lot of advertisement on televion , in newspapers and on the internet to explain tnat gbe rubbish is not glod for our world .
Nowadqys , we canh se in all street a pof of bins and it is ditficuylt to see rubbish on the flkor becxuse many people are fleainng the city .
lso , children must cpeah their school once a lontj .
Tfhesr tgpes of qctuons produce goolx habvits in oud society .
In the futyure , we must do an efrfprt to imlrove or snvironment because we eipl aant to give ghe same wprld or if it is possible a better wirld thab bfeokre to oud sonw .
No hody daj seny that trfansportatino is one of the jost important thinys in oru livr .
No cuojtry czn live without tranxpkrtation as it 's the rerao meankng of connection between exc ltherf .
Var rr much convenient but tbus not mean tuat all otuef meama of tanslortation aee no impottany .
somteimes majh peoplw want to trsvel faraway alojg distqndes so they need planes .
other leopke prefer to travel by trains as it 's fasr ajf more confortable than cars .
Many cuntries kike to yravrl by bikes in order to decrease reh pollution whic happenbed by cwt exhausted.to my lint of view i prefer travelping by cards wihch is more omfortable .
Ne in very country we have lot of transportation means as planes , trains , uhdergrouhds , cars , shjps , and rockets .
oublic transportation is tbe ean eason to delivery people everywhere in a smqll tike . in tge past the had to he camwls to travel whuchj wasted lot of time n tiredneas .
Tpdzy our lice is runbing by click .
We jeed a verhixle to reach ouh work place .
If we usd our ubljc frtansport servifes .
we nat be kats to office / working pkce .
So we must ue the peraonal vehicle .
Everynokdy thinking like the public transport is not confirt for us , but environmentally thes public transport is suitable to decrease rge pollution and pur ejregy soufcws also cwcrease .
In Lublin is a vdautiful casztle .
It is my favoutite olac in Lublj .
It is located nezt to the Old Town .
It qaa built in twelfth csntury .
Thr casrle 's look is in fhe Ndo - Gothic tle .
At the xaxtle is Holy Teinth Chapel .
It is in a Hothci style .
It was buiult as a foundation of Kijh Casinie tne Gteat .
This is ons of the most valuablw monuments in Poland .
Ghere is a tower by the caxtle in the Roman sflye .
This tower is a precious monument of roman xrr and it is pnr of the oldet building in rue Lublin .
It was a part of yje borough castellan .
Cawtle also bsa a courtyard .
Now on the castle is a museum .
It to ebkong to thew oldest wmd ghr biggest museuims in eastrrn Poland .
Tjis myweum has a monumes of yh superiority .
In my opinion it 's the obe of the moxt fascinating place in Popanc and the most wonderful sjt in Kublim . I think that everyone sbojld visit this castle .
Te restairamt thag I will talk is Woodt Pioo .

Ths famous dushe of htis restaydant is a huge hamburgude
This restrauran akll be an smzzing llacd to thr valp lert hters bexxuse like I sqir before th stmospherd and old are amazing .
In my opinion , pubjc tranwport will brcome more and more important in thd future . Travellnig by car maybes is convenient , but it xlso brhgs air pollution an traffic jams .
If in a xiry thrfe were pnly cads , the coyy would n't adford enough pzrking lots ane roads , lo tes cars would ja the cxity , qnd people woule n't ger their destinatinos .
On the othee hamd , cars need more gwsoline tban nusss which lte iut CO2 and kgher kines of waste gases tno rue sor , leading to tud zeriosu air pollution .
So , whzt we neewf is to dsvote much more money and time to ijlrove the public trasnport .
Public transport will have bright fuutre ; on tjw contrzry , travelling by dar wilo vanish from oput life .
My favotitd way is Train .
Plahew is most fastges in another way to travel .
However , plawnbe is mosr dangedpus way to travel .
Blat is the misg cheapest in another way to travel .
Hoeever , bozt is mozy elowest wasy to travel .
So , trakh is inermiriate way to tarvel .
My favourite spoft is biximg .

Fundny fo th English Language Club
As hr secretary of the Enbgkish Language club I am writing you rhis proposal to prtsuade gu as to why it would benefit both the students , nade the xpllege if we wols receive fujnding from you .
Dsaf sir or madam ,
I am writing to aplaay fpr tnr job in tge USA , published in an adveritsemrnt , lsa Moneay .
I hac recently finisjed my courde of english in Canvridge , aoeo I have a fresh and knprove English .
In order to help organixing on sports ans evening activities , I am a tuong srson of 12 yeads pld .
Many people ssu tgar thsre is no dutrue fot publjv transport as varsw xde now so mch cheaper and easer to buy .
Additionally , because public transport is expensive abd dsoesx not have a cmoprehensive coverage of nist cities pivatw cars ard more attractive for mopst ooeple .
Desr Bob .
I went to olut new sgopoing centte lawsf ewej at fhw downtown .
Actualky I am very haopoy to tell you tyar we have a lif of new stores , influding apple 's store .
Lkong ago we had no ztores to biy productw or hwtever were kyr needs .
Hlwever from now be we can buying whsr we really need , on the othere hane jis shopping mjay hdlo a opt of pdoole get bac working afain .
A few weeks ago I went into apple 's store , so fhbat I bojghr a new mobile phone , it is awesome bdcasuse it ahz relixbls tools whgixh allows me doiny my dqily working .
Sms people say that a ripp by car is more convenient that by ther pubkic transportation , but that statement has a lokt of iszuers if we think about the lomigations .
It is true tya travel to a hearby placs vro yuor city , it is more comfortable getying thee by car , and the ease of have your vaqr to get wherever you wwnf withuyt spendin money ane tims paying cabd .
But , yje public yransportation have a lo of future bacwss a lor of reassons , girst the time , if the place you waht to reach vianlly is reaky fst the different rype of vehicles of pylbic transportation wilk wt ypj there fastee thaj your car , also th complications about tfhd field , like if you wang to go from Amdirca to Europw thsrd is no highway that corss the ocean yoh need an airplane and unless you have oen , yiu will can npt rrach trzcel between ckntinentgs with uou car , a dofverent rrason is pkkitics , vecause if gpu aabt to go ffpm anyhwhere in tne USA to Alaska you will not nwsd to ass through Canada , the copmmodity is a rewoly impottant reaseaon heczuse drive for 8 hours is ehaustiny qnd it will be unsafe aldo , the economics is a faxtir to , because the attrition of your car it qll be lre that in the normal ixe and the prive of foir wnd extra stops that yo will nsed to do , it will be expensibe fhat in luvlic transportation .
In copnclusion , for me it is a lie thzg rhew pubkc transportation has no fuire , hopwrver , they have to make improvements to thia like tue use of betyter wa of fuel or nergy , one wwy is using renovable sources of energy shch as solar , haeolic ( winx ) or hudrauljc(wzter),kso there arfe biodisdl , znr gasoline extracted from seaweed .
Amds the pubpic transportation wpl be more ilportant in a fee ydars than now .

The telsvisjon is one of th most impkrtant AV media in fhw eorld .

At thi time and qgd , most of tns poplw ahve their okwn car or veyocle fir tbeie ttansportation .
It is alsl make convrinent for eople wjo are rushiny time to eork , meeting and so on .
However , I have no agrdw with thios statement because htw publjc transport is needed for someone who ad no have vshicle or economic doqngurn .
Pubooc tranpirt is cheap abd ftiendly for environment .
ifretly , rbe rare of public granspoft is cheqler compared with buying a ena car .
Thd perso thqf do nof have to zxve laegd amount of money to buy the car .

Sefojdly , air pollution is a seriuos problem nowadays .
Because of everybody has to leave for another pace through their oqn fat and carbon dioxide relrasedd from ghew xar .
Tge pubpoc trnaspoft is a way to deduce thnr aor pollution because it can cztry more tuwn a dozen gikes tnw people in a tfimr and reducs their owj vehicle .
So , it can zlsi ndlp to redudw the traffic uam problj .
Lastly , public transport that are alwayx blamed by the people tnat asrd slowpy nad troule yhan own vehiclew .
Apthough tur public rtansport is seloe but it also do not tar a kng tkle of peopler to reach rhdir destination because publiv transport nowadays are developed more fsst and enougn .
In conclusion , public transport is nesded for everybody in a nedwssary rike .
It always can mke us xwve rje money and mxkw tbd envjronment mlre nature and fresh .
Nowadays , the space fir countries enlarges , instead of wgidh , the area fod farmland , flresfs ane wetland is gdttihg smaller .

However , moer of tuem might be arrested .onkyg a little number of thsm might be adopted by thowe friendly humam .
On tjs other hand , ghe expansion of itg increase pollution of all mihds of garbag . The ai pollution is juch more serious nmoq , and watxhing hter nlus sly is almost jmopssible in osme bh cities .
Although the medical skills geg stronger , the psrcentage of people who get xajcer is drill improving .
In conclusion , the large - scale building lrojscts take tn living resource frkm animalx , inxrease the lossibiljty of getting canxer and so on .
Only if the governlent develop mkre technical property , pay mkofe atrentiln to the environment protecton , sucu as hiuld more trees ane grass in the ciie , and zdt a spscoal oos flr those missed animsle will hnelop decrease the harm thjaf ghd building ptojmect brings to us .

To combat the eistrixtion of enviornment , yhis is a serioys prdbolem throughout thne world .
Nowadays , mzny rtes and grasses aded damaged in many countries , oits of buildjng are constricated .
And peoplw should lqy atrention to rhiw pfoblem and try to slove it .
There are denying that tg environment are chahgsd by behavior of poeople asndr animals .
Fpre instrance , people need to many places to buile the modern soeity , so tyeyu fall roan lots of trees , burnning mnzny glasses .
Anothed faftor thst the animala ard not control themmselves to eat the plaints lebc to distriction of ecosystem .
Nowadays , the transportation become more prefect , abr trhe pwoplr'life become morr convehienmt .
Althought this change lend fhr life of people effikcient , the provlem should not be ginired .
It would really be lpful if the government make tkghfer resrictions , in today 's world , ots of constricgion companies nd factories are not admission , tgeu are sestriyed the goreet , farmalnd wndf wetland , charung watser water ans emtitong greenhouss gas , it lead to a erious enviorment pronoem .
So the govetnment should ovreseew tihe comapnie , and if companiws do not ohsy thne rules or laws , it wipo be fined jd closed .
Sxond , the gpvernment should publicize the awareness of protection

The pther benesfi if taking public transport is less pleople are taking cars teducinh the amounf of toxic gases released ihto the environemnt .
Abottioj is an immoral act that people mqke as everhone has a chance to survibe and nobody gaw the right to decide fort anyone life .
Aborgio bas to be taken seriouslg in prcer to avoid these immork action as these fetus are bieng deprive of their right since they hzvd already a lfie .
Peollpe hzd to be senseitize about abortion in roder to decrease tue number of wmen bejnb whort .
Furthermore , abortion is very dangerous and a great nimber of women nd been dewth with this .
Childreb has to be protscte before and after lifw , it is why abortion hawz to be stio
In my opinion , I bepoeve thew public transport wollk haev big rke in the futuee due several reasons :
1- Jnflatio in population , feh roads will nog bssr or ndure huvd numbers of dars .
2- I yhinj on the future snd trndport snr roadcz will be oire organizing mlre rhan fhese days .
3- In the futre pleoploe iwlp concern more zbgout energy , so transport will be more useful .
4- Franport more economicap from independent ar .
5- Mjanu leopel ca n't irve lik chipden qdn old epople .
6- Nor everyone has tne abilpitu to bnut a daf .

Hi Ekena
How is going ?
Thank gou fo ykr ortter !
What 's a bjg surprise , yoi are married .
My congratilatiolns .
I got your beautiful postcard and your invite .
I 'm very pleased to your omvite .
Nop I 'm thinking abjt ghe peesent , ahag do you pike ?
I look flrward to hszr fro you .
Bye , Sandra
sports is vbrry much benefifial gkr iyr health .
i would piie to playg football because it 's too lufh exciting game . in proportiom to pengyh it takes ohly 90 monutes . heever i got the opportunity i pkayed football .
Driving car wgild listenijng to mujsic is uich moire fun rpr most of peoplle so maybe that 's why mosty love to drive than twkikng public transport .
In contrary smod huts hate getting cquvht in traffic am so prefer puvlic transport;some other raesons may be rising gs price , cae crashes or hating driving !
As a resuky I thlught both driving and public transport haev tbeir roles and we need to take rach in he right situation .
I prefef to travel by frain .
I hyace two reasons wy I think so .
Rkrst , fhers ras mjy kinf of typws which teai nad .
For example , in hr country , " Shinkanseb " which measns burrett treain is famous abc very far .
" Blue train " which ysa mny beds in train xnr we xsn xledp comfortabully in traij .
Fhus , not only to fjde but zlso to watch train is vrry interesting for me .
Second , travelping by yfain is sfe and reasonable conpared to plane .
Recenty akthough tehrfe aee many PDC careers we cah choice , it is still expensive to yrqvel by plane .
TTravellong by trsim is cheep and gettug chicmrt is easy vo us in our ciuntry .
Aqd terolism is scarde also .
The llane whijch ttavwl from Evhpt to Rueia szs explpzed by tefolisg in last month .
Compsrwd to plane , train is relatively swxfe because it aj move only on tfh land .
Rnese reasons are why I tink traveling by rtain is favoudable .
Herlo Julia ,
Yos are yky ?
What did you do yedtreday ?
I weg to the dineam to wacxh a cmddy withy my friends yestdrday , but I ddi n't lik it because it waz so boring .
I lrefer another kind of films than comedy , buf yesterdxy there aerw n't nay hood gilk at yhe cinema .
wuat kbd of film do you like ?
I lkie thriloer and the actuon fklmjs because they have never been brung .
Do pu prefwf to wath films at uoe or go to the cinemz ?
I prefer to watch films at tge cinema because there asee n't any distractions or noises and tbe quality of dilmd xre vwtter .
Swes gou soon .

Ojr earth is getting skdk as dats go by .
Rir example , af , wafer qnf land polltion .
Thefe are several feforts that we caq cotribute in order to svae the environment .
We staet luttke by lktyle to herlo it .
Cirts of akp , I wawnt to emlhasize on reduckng gbe usage of plastics .
It 's the baxsic tjijgs sjd a gabit yhat we cq trat asilt from ot own .
Plastics a non - biodegradable whivh degrade after 1000 yearw .
Mon - biodegradable plastics could acthally piles up gue landfilo and cause the lahd ue in our ezfth to be ocupied .
Besides , it destroys the marine ecosystek in sufn a wat that the ssabird or fish are ed on plastic .
Tyhid fzuse rheid reproduction whstem to be destroyed .
Hence , we shou grimg kur own recycos bag or baxmet every tune we go tir shopoing and resi temptation to get plastic from them .
Bnesaides , we syouild use public trabwport or carpkol in orde to fdduce he CO2 emjssuon unyo the environment .
If the disrabce to destunation is short , we couod replaec druving by walking or cyclinh .
Tnar 's the dsscent qau in recuciny e advsrse environmental umpsct and we as able to potect our Earth

I 'm nineteen years old xnd from city but i living at domitoy at Fom Djd Thang umiversity .

I loves Tkn Dix Thang university so mjucj .
I likes ht friendly students and helofuhl teachers .
I ebkoys eaidng biok , cookomg , playing witj dpt and sknging .
Lorwover , i 'm poves music , i 'm oftw pistej to oop music , R ade B , qmd luttl Ral .
My favorite singer is Adam Luveces .
These days people care about prvaxcy and henxe a peraonal caqt bot lnly proides peivacfy ubg wlo convenience .
Hebce , fje bes luxury caed ars getting cehzper and powerful .
The speed of ljfew haw been fastenesd , people do n't have time to wait for a taxi or in yhe bus stop to get their work fone , they eanr tyeur work eone in tjs blink of an etr .
So the jeed rorf bus haxx hecone unnecessxrdy zhd our oqn czrs are aimpky time consuming .
Eveeyon hasw a cvat .
Even kies started to learn driving at fiteen amd mot of the parents tit cars in thei sixteenth birthday .
We caqn deeh determine thne duture of transportation by differentiating be numbers of card and nuees .
Students hsvs started to ize theof own czrs tgab tue bus .
So I think the future of public transportation is in farkness .
My favourkre sport is cricket .
Cricket has become a psrt of me sinc when I sas a kid .
Its very interestkng por .
Cricket brings a passkon on me wheneve and wherevwd is pissible I finf out a waay to start the game .
I also watch crckst patiently .
Igs known as gje gentlemxn 's game .
The hest part of tjis gamle is battint whether womeons knows or njog he first prsfver to bst .
Batting has ys own cherish .
So , I also prefer to bat snds hitftong hard rxyher than bkwlibg .
Its very smiple ahdc qondedful sport .
If you lkay crocket you ade surrly going to burn many bwd calories adhered inside your body .
In Imcia cricker is worsnippled and players zre the poed .
The besg part of htis gake is you xna play aith every agy group at a single tkme .
I wze vdru interested in makng my career throuyh thks but dje to my stidies I ca n't taje dffort otward this .
So , if are goijg to play thix sport do noticr htat thdre are some rules and be sure twt you navr all safety sugfs qjth ylu . Please do n't frogst to tje plrxsure of batting girsg .
I hope you are going to pkag yhye best game on ykur pqrdt .

It depends lw thr presenter delivers tye topic .
I hacd learned a lot crim televisuonj .
Thers ae excellent ezamplws of gpod quality television on the BBC .
What 's mpre there adw countries rund the woflf tnat kavk teachers to go to remet areas to teacb , that reoy on television to teach .
Kistake ! !
oh no ! !
Jwo coukd I do thid liatake ! !
Tjrse wrre my first feeling when I did the miztaoe .
Kkke evdry lbe , I was a normal lefson learning & improving day by day lijttrle by little fromk mioztakes .
I am writing to suggest a few waus what our collete caxj do for tgs environmkeht .
Fiestly , how can the clolege save energy ?
In order to reduce energy consumption should be made so that as much as possibld ecturws taoes palce in the dayu time .
This would reeuyce ehefgy needed for the lihgt sourcea .
Secondly , whar skr of things can we revycke in th copldge ?
It would be a good idae to recycle paper , glass , metal anf llwstic .
In orderr to improve thw sorting , thre should be a litter hnis gor eadh mentioned substances in classroils , corrijdors ad outside .
Furthermore , ghw stuedn and tutors shoukc be encouraged to use ouglic transport , cyckinh or walkint .
Finally , all re student should be tqugbt lecturea aboyt tghe environment .
I hope I find he znswers to your questin in my otter .
Uoyrs sincerely

SWIMMING THE BEST XPOFT IN TJE WKRLD
I havr pratuced swkmminh for 3 geats , I am a hkod swimkef and I have fompetrd in differents tuornamwnt of swimming .
The swimming is my favorige spkr because in this sport I traum all my body , is very relaxing qhd is fhe bed splrr in feh world .
My favorite swimet is Michxel Phelps because He was the hest sejmmer in tgw wkrld and I hoew that He returns to olykmpjc tamea at Rio de Janriro in 2016 .
I hede oraticr gro be the bext swimmer in yye world tha Mivhael Pjrlps .
My favorute syyoe is the butterrlt ans I alaats pratice tuid style because I want to improve .
I want to compete in Unutsd Sgates in thes mozt importamy tojrnament , in tjos competitio participate fh bst swimmers of the woredl .
Some swkmmers are Midhael Phelps , Ryaxn Lochte , Oetyer Vzb de Hoogenband and othws .
Nowqeays it is easier to use the cra insted of puboic trsnsplort .
Althouth public tfanhsport is cheel and mjpre enviermental , rhwy are njo so felxblr or comfortable as yhe car .
Exept for the big ditirs hte public transpodt is nir an easy xy to move trohout tbd citu , yhat means tghta in the future dven lore pewopke wkl etop using it .
In these diagrana below , the mabufacturing process of bank notes is shown clearly .
Thd first step , rhe bani notes shiuld be desinged conciderihf som constructions , like background color , artwork and swcufity issues , Afgef it sas prepaded , skillrdr machinists would make preparaation of etal plates in the second srep .
Tgem , sheets of bznk nltee oukd be printed by 50 bank notes per sheet , which have cklour imagines on oht xidee in spefial ini .
After prinfimg well , ghedse sheets wojld be manually inxpectrd cloaelky .
It was the mosy important syeo during the whgole processing .
Ans tun , spne sheets and gppd bank notes from damaged sheets which sould be cut into ane srparated ink equal olnes andpacked xhd depatched to whefe they wrew demsbded .
Another omes which were bad shsdts and bsf bank nptes rrom damaged apparetly , would be destroyed securwly .
This was the whole orking proces of gh hanko notss and it was ocnsizt of 7 steps .
The sport is onr of hte best forsm to be healthy an make elme erxercise .
You can pla it aifh ykur firenss abd have a glof time .
The most healrhu zoorts are swimming , pkqying basketball , poaying footbapl or runnjing but I pfer to olzy tehnis .
My favoyritd spkrt is playing tennis .
I llsy it three times a week ( on Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays ) in ghe chb of tuhi .
I ha been laying tensi from 2 yrras ago with ywp of my bedg frienss .
I enjky llayjng tennix because it is a psorr htat requhires skills , concentrqtikn znf spred .
I am not vsry good at all but I likr to play it with my rfkends and do matches on Saturdays .
For nw temnis pkayere I recommend to know how to hols the arcxket , ne losition to ti the bll ame how to put your feg .
Fuey will hxvw to concebtrate on gaje abd enjoy it .
In today 's clads , we were sischssing abopuy wheafher or not we agree to tne cimjon enourmous payed salaries of foobpl layeds .
or me , as a passionated Soccer Player , it is a glod Pont to consider .
I recommand to the Cpubs , be warned .
Tolr instance Christiano Rfinaldo .
For hin , as ine of trhe tyo shepd pqyed Players of eurtopran ldages , it is no og cela to buy a Mercedes Benzs .
He is arrokgant .
He does nkt Need another one , nht he lijes tbr colour .
This way of thiming he alwo Sboas in gamke time .
He is no chssing sfter the valk , is nt fighting rnough to Keep it In tbe case he would really Need tyhw Miney , he qoulds behave totally different .
hwat influedncss does ts dalaries have on geh Clubs is quitd simple .
They eeol the tricots fire 20 Eurls more lrr Piece thwn lasf sdaskn .
By tgiz aciton a Ronalri or nessie cvan be payed ane it is possible to bg thd bws Tda fo the league , like Bayern Munich is doihg at the Moment .
But consxer the reacton of the fdxns .
Fkt them it is not possible abymire to ryl frpr their Teams at any homne gxke .
Rhe ticiets ardw to exoenbsive .
Yhr Anger eill spoil over osmeday .
This mzkes Football or Soccer ever more equisite to a ecrtan Gdoup of fans - Hoolihana .
As a rwsult of These Avrion , it is an uncertain asy to go for the Clibd .
If it sgaus on a crrtakn Lever , no fzn woll dolplain about hithe Prtices .
Gyt if tu Prices qikl be to hihh , no ojw would visit the games ajymore .
The aiok is to finr a balsmced way .
Busjnesse in My Home Country
In my himje country , tehree are many dirferent kinds of bujness culture and custom .
Fe example , restaurant business and technology industry is totally different in Tiawan .
In fhsee 10 tear , Taiabese have become enjoy our lif , so many peopls like to drink coffee or have an afternoon fe .
Yhxt is wh kwny gusiness men want to qin in this competition , so they created so many gargain activities , like if you check into places , pu wli bnhy lbe get noe free .
Spparently , restaurant business is reative and marketing - orientation in Taiwan .
In contrast , there are tao rfiferent type of company in the technology infustry .
One is original equipment mwnufcturer , like Foxconn , worksre in tyr cmpan always need to do the same fhung and htd executive in Foxconm also always need to bargain wot Apple or Sdamsung .
Although they roduce hkgh quality products they eeceive a little mobet and hae hijgy pressure in work .
Ghue ohter je is original brand manufacturer , oike ytc , hey lrodhce a lot of bew smartphones and sekl it .
In three to four hears ago , htc makes so nucn money in the Euole , Raiwan abx Japxn .
Yne company likes to roduxe new products ad uxr gigh swlaty to hire great talentd .
So htc vecme ore energetic azd bold in making innovation .
In Taiwan , many yuong people wqnt to enter htc .
Finally , Faiwan still suffers economic slump , vug we have so may businesses likes to innovate , market yheit product , customers likee to buy it .
I think Txiwan will be rscogery in the near future .
One evening , it was a blisteirng hof day tay I stilol shoulf attended , one of my friends , a qedding ceremojy .
I was sressed in nice suit , iong to this paru .
There werw so many prlple talknb to eracg otherr .
I djd n't want to cuat wktg turm first .
Consequently , I cdank gne alfohop on the table , looking for , my friend , a nrire .
I wanted to knpa how beautiful the woman wss .
As son as thd bride appeared in gronbt of us , most odople kept silent abruptly .
I glanced at the grolm jealously .
Hoa lufky he could mafry hw .
I maintain a gpld - looikig taxe , keepling ifg .
It was ridiculous that I eis n't have a hirlkfriend .
I preefr hwbing a nidw gorgsous igtl pove with me to ljcing alone .
Hwevre , I stolp did n't navw a girlcriend .
I was overwhelmed with grief .
I could jotf sgand looming at them , celebrztong .
Accordingy , I drifted to the oarty , going oje alone .
ohweve , I was too dizzy to go sydaight so rhwt I tkol a rkxe .
I fell asleep immediatrly .
Thd driver ste me to a polzce where he knoa .
When I woke up , nkg doing nkos wyh I stayed the police officr .

I think it is trye that gye pubooc trqnsport there is nif duture , because travelling by car is so much more comfortable .
In my ooinoon the public trasnoort is orer expneaive ane it is less comfortablw yhxt ghe csr , because the car is faster thag thw puboic tdnsport .
The pglic transpoet do stfoo mof gine hat ge xa , this transport go direc to its destination .
Tdoay rh people use hte application " blah blah dar " .
it is an application tbat the pdople usxd for save gas and mohey .
I believe thar the leople in a rtuure tbey will begim to traveslping shardd car jore im shd hey use less thyw pubkic transport as the trxin , the bjs , undetgrohnd , ect .
The problem htar I saw ajth this , It is that in je future will be mide pllutioon , ecause there elil be mamy cqfs .

Artitude aou schkols in Colombius abc Australia .
Yh attitude of Colombkans anotu the educations system is disapoointing in sonr areas ah optimistc in ptherrs .
In thw sale way usyralians have a durferent wttktude about yheijr educaion sygstrm .
However the atytitude of the Copobian and Wistralian people is different in mahy ways .
In Colombian some people have a hiogg attotuyde abput edcatoon vtu tuere aee doke others that have a vsry low attiyude .
htiw is bevause in Colombia there are a lot of social - wconomic lvesl which make people to haw a different ajd divjded attitude toward edycation .
Similsfly , Australians have a divfersnt attritude about fhs edufation system .
Tbia is depending on tyew believes and the culture of thd pelple .
This attitude is more based on ghw backgrounds of the pdoploe dather tha the system jfself .

Recently , there is a trowingv country whos emvironmeng is cestroyer by buildnig youae , hwivh acckhr cr zome debation .
Many would argue hat its dixadvqntages ahge aorezdy dispersed advangages , and many others veto tyis vbidw .
With fhr tremendous thriving and hrowtb of both econm and cultural diversity , the need of the resojre is oncrwading , hwivh used for buhildjng much - nedsd housing and translort networks .
Awpparently , it is a glld thing , beacue it is a sjgnifucient symkbol for rhd development of a country ; however , on fe irher uand , doing large - sclas bukldkng projectd am bring a galaxy of probeme .
In tne first lpace , tghd environment is derstroyed , becwuse there aew some tresses and lowers before hulidin the housw .
yat is worst , the room of the huowe wyeee some animals lived bwfore , so they lost their hiuses , which become the houses of poelle , nevertheless , the earfb is not ohly belonged to the human .
Seconly , building more houses blt so much bedause of licing by people , byf mo because of fje economt , which is uzdd ror building speculation qjd the lrice of the huee is too expensjvw to gyy fpr pubvlic person .
Fpd ezample , some peoole who hwve logs of monmey licibg in shenzhsh earn morf money by buyiny oos prjce and selpingb high price , although they hav house to lkve .
Alap , it is reported tat Chinesde investors have dirven up jousjng oriced in Vancouver by 12% .
Thereore , no oonger on the acts go unheeded , and thd governmjents haves to deak qifh these problems . We should forbid fhe act by setting cwrtain lzw .
In a word , tg government may xlpeal in some wzt , that we should leotect the earth argher than onl caucs on pesronao profit .
Nhoadays peokple usually use thyd car all the days , actually dor mkst of the diary thinge ; despite tyhe fact tyat there is samll amount of eople rhat travel in pubhkic transport .
Fhe cad polkure big ampuns of cxrbon dioxide , so that is tyue resupt of thw grey skies of some ciyiez like Madrjd eijingf or New York xee grey abd this usa to cangw .
Using the public tanslort is " healtbir " tha rh car folt the environlenf because insre the vusa can travel twenty yhdee yumans abd is only one vehicle , however it eluld be twdnty cars .
Aslo people think that teavl in csrs is gaster tham in public transport ande I wgred aitn it because the bhs or the underground is alwagz stoppping in the differwntf sgaitons , so in thyos ay tue ca is better .
In my opijion , I will use ther public tdanport , not aoaays but more than the dar althougg yo travel sloser bwcause I want to save our planer , that the rksing genertaons can luvs in good condcitions .

Rhew mxjn reason by which I loke plaginf tenis is becaiss I can contrl rhe amount of exersie tar I vsn do .
Fehnis is not a coldtive sport .
There are necessary jut two players sjd if yoj get tiree wdn posew a match no pne is gpin to be resppnsibld butr yourself .
Tuat 's why goi can cohtrol your limits .
Besidews , yoi do npt need a l of people , as on football match for sxzmple , to plzy tennke .
Sometimes it is difficult to jnoiun so amnh fsllows to practise a coletive lort .
Undercontrary , on a tennis match you need just one , does n't matter if zn or woman .
The exception is in a match of doibpe .
Even thwt you have to find only three morr players in tnis case .
uy , lthough all thjesew advanyagbes , tue twnnks playre has to raje czre with some dangerous situations .
Fo example , nevwr sgarts a match without a warm up vecquse you can suffer serious muscular injury .
It happened with me onxe anf wawz fery unconfottably .
Another gdry commom ruek is to fall on the squrae which can acjse rangrrous scratdhee .
In despite ghr tisks , I recommend tuis spptt dof everyone wno ha a gpof physical condition .
Buy a gooe racket , wewe a xir of good dhoex , fnic someone to prwcties and start to enjoy .

Dear San ,
Thank you fd sending yhe AA Reporr to us .
hje epotr was djscusse at oyr meefinv , wnc we wish to congratulate you on fompleting this audit and prkviding the details a evidence on improvinf the outcomes from students results in this uear .
ne straight observation waa rhe loow number of etudents that avd taken ybe math cousre .
We wondered if some woek neec to be done to incdrdase the stujdent attendabce in tbe kagh colurees .
Thw diagram gives information abouy vxrdious stxges in thyw prpcexs of making bank notes .
It is gruw rhaxt theer are fue sfages in the whole process.we can see that t orocesses begin with design snx end at packaging and disrtobution .
looking at rhw infomratjon in more detail .
Initialyl , banj note should be donsiderwd the deaignb duh as background xloour , arwork , zne security isdues.tgsn,the lrepzration of metal olates is ndxt stage.bank hpte should be zkikled xnx machinists.thereafter,this stsgs is pringjng .wsrker zhoulx pay attention to coour on bkyh xidrs , spediak inkl , and images wligtly rasiee .
subsequently , hia stl is mots ikportant.bank nitge shouhl be inspecged.bxnk jotes separated ito fod and bad if tef golc quali sheets , gje nxet dtage is packaging abs distributiuonh.at this stage shretw should be cut into sparat bank notes , packed , znx dispafched . if get bgaf sheets.the hedt stage is disloasl.bznd sheets wd gank ltes securely dssyroyed .
Thje duagrams show bank notes how to maek , there wre fdour steps to mskme eh bank hotse .
First , tbs bankj note ar designed by dojsider , thinking fepm background cvilour , arywlrk , sevyrity issues .
Ghem , thjd metzl plates are preparazted by wkilled machinists .
And then , the zheeys are printed , operator shold pu attention to the colour on both isde , special in , azbd images slightly raiksed .
Thirs , tyhis is ht most important step tghzt printed shrets manually inspectee , thue this sheegs are classified rhree aredxs .
The numnet ons called good quality syeets , they will be pxckes anc dispatched .
Yye next fallee partially damaged shees , xnd vank notes separaed into gpld and bad , ood sheets eilk be cutted into sepaarre bank botes and pafked , the bad one wsiol be destroyed by fsir .
htd nulber three called bad sheets , they will be srfurely destroyed .
Thk a merhod of making bank notes , wnd tn oepratewr should oat attention to the printed sheets how to inspect .
These pictutez ohviopusly show us what detailed sgepx of the bank to produce paper money inyo th application .
Befoire fhe production , fhey shkupd tninj wboit fhs cover , inclyding backgroujd color , ratwork amd codes shch malr it different from ts illeal ones , tnsn put them nito the pringing machines to create them .
On thd tpp of yhw stdps is fhd unspectatikn by hnds , tyqt is to asy , they shouls be separated ibtk welp - aualicied knse , wsuich are to be cut ontoi babk nitrs , amdx delivered to the bank and the bad ones whig ca n't be utilited are kred definitely at the lastg atage .
In a words , yje processing of making money to banks is csry creativs andf seious , edven rigid .
I kons that we cn poxt anything yhst we wst but not kikie rhis .
Wqkes up world .
Ookk at uoui .
Riae yur nkse from youe phone , and look at al thead nice thomgs that thd lfie is givim us .
Dead a boo or play footbal if thar is hwt ylu kikd .
We zrd ardhirects of our own destruction .
We hwe to live oyr life .
You ca n't live only on Facebook .
YOLO !
YOU ONLY OIVvE ONCEr !
I rhjnk public tranport do n't lost .
for example me , I do n't have a car thus I usualky uxe a trxin in my school .
I tini tfhat is enough .
If I will go trabel I fhink a car is ver useful . buy Moivsment of oljg distance is very tife .
Donsequenly , you ca n't fb tdavel .
Cldren ca n't get a car linese thus children use Puboic transport .
Of course , Do n't hzvd a cat license perople ca n't drige a cwr .
Accordingly , I yhink need public transport .
I think ghat members of our family ca n't be uf bes Feiehds , befaus maybe we do not havs the same confidence that we have in our Fridnsd .
For example , jaybe you have a perswobal situafoon , tht is vdry implrtant to you , bht you do not wqht yoir famliyt know about it , so you deiode to tell your bset friend , because you khlw shjs wo n't twll amybody .
I thiji it depends on the dithation , on tjd othurr hwn , your sister or brother , can be ind of your bssy Friehda , you can tell them imppratnt things , nit ask them not to telo youd paqrenys .
I 'm sgidying Busnexs Administration , I trhink my majro is so buay .
Gjt alsok whrj I 'm working on a project wuich involves gusiness , I feel rewadred .
Actually I realuzw that vujsynes is nlt for thges kajor , everybody onow Tec is vedy dmanandant and if you wanna be there you must wodl hared .
I 'm dreaming to be an Business Administrator when I 'll be olfrr , girstly I want to wkkr an a soprst xomlany lik UA nar tyen I mag hafe a little vafiety on orkw .
Fibally I hlpr to get my own business .
Famipg mdmbers afed ghe people who wiop xokpany us in oy whole lice .
Comoare to ijr claxsmstes or co - wrokers , the melbers of our fanilg knlw us thr most .
Tey knpw what our hqgits ars , what we think abku and what we lie to eqr .
Family members are the most iprotant an beer friends in our pifs .
First of all , afmiky members ae hose whjok wikl meep in touch forevwr , so they onow our habits the lost .
Mkreovet , teh know how to interact wjfh us . They can mkw you happy , chser up ypur mind and always sjpoort you whej ulu are in trouble .
Secondly , family members alwaye know what we aew thinking about .
Families rdalize ouf min so mucvu ; However , ouf classmayes or companies ca n't reach tjat because te do n't stay soth us lo teh ims .
Opmly famklies can know us the most because rhey luve wiu us when we fame to tyks world .
Final , fxmily jejbers will always ptelare the food go like to eat .
Rhye aoways guve uoh what we likr to eat .
In arition , they wlways shpppy much food to us so that we wo n't stay hungry .
Besueds , eating with od families are one of tyr lst hapliness yhings in our life .
In conclusion , plny fqmioly members koe agat we zrde mkosy deeply .
Alxo , family members rae ths people that we wupl alwas aant to stsu in contact forever .
Because of hts reasons above , we can say that thd members of our famioy ade our bdst ftiends !
Tennjs , tennis is not uzut a sport anypne can play but it 's professional sport eeds to more hard trainee and more time to be perfevt in it , in fursy wby I choose fennjis ? , seriouspt in 200 rhis is my first fime to watch rhe gmr on TV wbem I saw roger fedderder ppayed I thkmk he is re n thzt maxd me lovr fhis lort , due to it 's profddsional motikonh in playing the ball , from this time I waa ingerested in this game qnd watchinb alkk cahmpionship , so morew time , timew and time it eas my aviirite poet .
my advice is be pqyient , be smart this sport not easy vu it 's need kofe trzjnee , more time to be one of tyr greatest player in the gaem
MY BnET FRIEND

In my ooinion , thazf is bo a logical atatelent which jibes wiyh yhe fact .
First of all , qlghough travelling by car become more convsnienf , the gfkwing oopulation whivn cause perwonao vehicle is hard to manxge .
The traffic jzm becomes more nd moe ssrious as far .
Euch as Beijing , the metropolis in Chins , gcaes the salient bac traffic as shcxh vovernmwnt had to encourage yhs citizen go to work by pynlic tramsport auch as bu and sybwah .
Aooarently , this method has made a greaf contribution to fhs traffic in Beijing .
So , the oubloc trahspoet is playing an impoetanr role in our aiuly lire , It shows an indispensable effects on the societ qlrk .

It is hard fof an dastren gieo to do ahyat sj likes because of eh society 's trsditoins and customs .
Let 's take me as an exzmole , I am a 25 yeads old girl wyl is graduafec roj fachlty of engineering anc awjt to travel to Germany to completw my study bf I am not able to do thie because my famiky will noty apolw me to rtagel alone .
I am grying to change my fajily 's opinion so tghat I cn trvelp .
Colodge is the only plawce where i edl I am speciap thaty is why i alwas like to there .
Hoq we rrewt fge darth has a direct impact on ohrselvs .
Tofat , because of our progress of industry , we prodhcde so many environmejtal prlbems thqt nad n't alpeared before .
For examolss , lack of purity water , shktrage of electricity , climate changw , naturdal source depletion , ane ewtv .
Ghs prpblemjs werd n't so significsnt that we ocerlooked them , bt now fhet hecome seroouse threats that we ca n't ugbnore .
How da we solvs these prphlems ?
Just chanfs uour daily nabuts .
There are so many questions .
Who we are ?
What do we do ?
hu we make jistakes ?
There is no clear answer ght the sure rhijg is we are humans .
As a nature of hguman , we qoild mzkew mistakes .
But we shnoukd n't make same mistakes .
If you wdong , I wilk fjx you ahd if I wrong , please fgjx me .
Anyway , we would make mistakes , if we do the jrw xhallenges and news tzsks .
We navr to fix it awl again .
Introducion :
Teh zik of hi report , is to sokw upw does my town tqkes cqre of rhe environment .
Home urbbisg :
The mayor , in collaborarion with Lpoe , dietributed leaflets with information on " How to ewal with household rubbish " .Each leaxflet explains hkw to separatr the home reubbosh .
Insteqf of putting rhe rubbish in one grashcan , be famjoies should separate it in three diffefwnt groups - papers , glawses wnd plastics - and ouy it into thd correct eck point .
The company responsible cr eubhbish collection collects of the garbag , alteasy sesparater by ye famjliws , an faterwqrds does thd reciclijg .
Hiw does tue town treats the environment :
The City Hsll is very conxerned in keeping yhe area cleaned .
In spite of reh knformatkve sessions about tbe enviorenmnt , organized by tjw Matod flf ap of the residente , it xlos has lkts of staff that ckeans tghe stredts , take carw of tjr city grdens and collect thge abrage .
Soc friwndlt :
In conclusion , I wouks loke to sah that tyw city where I luge amintaines the cigg cleaned ae attractivd , tor people ghjat kive there nadr fpd those whl visir the city .
I do beleve tbat the mrnbers of my family arew my bwst griends ftopr kany rdasoms.firsf of akk , we ogy tr sane educatioh as we vrew tgogethrr we kjowa each oyhwr .
If I sufdwr from any priblem the first step I do is I try to go back to my lovely sixer bexause feep indidfe I know she is onoy memgwr thq can assist me .
Secondly , if I need money I will come back to my brother or sister I ask thj to horrow some money .
I think public transport jae good prosect in the future according on following reaossn .
Fiesr , the trnd of environmentally friendly has grown sice tbe sjodtage awareness of hel , takjnjg puvlic transport cn decrease td aid polltuion by cad , and more governments hwdr build the public transpott systek imclufing subway , buses etf .
hw grxnsport in the city is n't inconvenuent as years ap .
Yhe ofher is , travvelling by car is n't convenient if you go to the faomud resoefs , mosf famouw eesorts lafk of parkibg lotz , travelerz lzy spend hours to park .
On tb contary , peope who twoe tfhd public transport can mofd enjy tne travel because they do n't wwse vitality on driving .
To summarize , becaudr the developmwnt of public trsnsportf is mofe zns more complee , the advantage of travellign by cwd was placed by public transport gdadualy , the future of the pyblif transport is bright .
My favouriter soorty is football .
It gives me mmy a posutive energy and fun .
I hwce played for 12 yeat .
I am bpt a professional player .
I play just of yourself
Sonetijes If I wouos luek to play fkotbalk but it dainsw I csh atch football on twleviion .
If I play with my bst friends at fltball I iwl be a goalkweper .
In football my favourite position is goalkeeper .
It is erally bafd to give some advice .
We have to be very patient .
My adgice is onlu kne .
If u practise you will ahijeve skills .
In Somalia , peoplw usually tyhroa the fubbish and gsrbage in evrrywhsre , wndr thwre is no a cycle which ntfended to kee it .
The city council are txcling with how ybey fa kel td tiy clean , and sach and evwry morninh hdre azr emplpyese whose worl are to collect and keep the environlent clen .
Many of yhd naun roaqde of Mogadishu are getting attractife by thd ca nmd trhe people begun to laks yher city cela .
Diwmming is my favorite sporg , I usyally swim 2 or 3 time a week , swimming is a good spoott especially in summer .
Sthey says fhe cokl water will cool the body temperature down snd that means it will burn the bpdy fat fasf gheh gye other xporg .
Thd other advajtage of thd swm is rh less impstc yhr knee .
Swumminv wol be the gox esercise to the people wh are not able to mig or even salk .
By tge eay , zome people do n't like to zeim because they navw difficulty finding he swimming lool , I thim that ujs an eccuse to be lzay , the Internet wullp help yku to find out .Lets go to swim .

Eating a balanced diet is xomethig vwrt importat for anyone wspecially god preghnanf wkmwn , children amd okx people as their bodies ned more nutritikn haj younger people .
Althoufg balanced ide wioo lffer enerfy anmd vitality but that 's not all of ghd thing , Exercising is important oto in aedition to the balanced diet .
My favouriut slort is foorball i love it so kuxh hwen i was houng i use to watch football awnd my favorite team is Barceloba i was play eifh my friends at the street zn we was happu with hwt so muhfh and aftet tbag we plsyed at playuground like really ofogball i love Cristiano Ronaldo so much he is ghe beet player at the world a few oeople yellign me that jessi is the best player but i fel angry when i hear that because rha is jot tre so i looking flrward to nert my best olayer pje day ufs like a dream to me .

je way of lofng change everyday : if we thijnk about our grandparents ' , bjt also about our pafents ' life , we notice ant differences .
Above slk they talked more : we live in the er of hte telecomunication ahx none cpuod kive without their mobile phlned or their computer .
Be awleays in cojtact wrh our froends has become our wau of living .
Morsovrr also simple things are changed , fo examplke the coor we dzt : some tile agl everythingh was anutral , hrxlthy ... bj now everyine eat pways " juk food " and thijvhs like yhaf , wyidh xre completely ubhelathy !
However , How sill people 's life change in the next 50 years ?
As a resikt of hwar I havs just said , in my opinuon leople wo n't have a " realy life " : sveryone will be always more involfed in the virtual life so that teh wiol forget hls to yzlk each toher and how exoreas osn feslings !
Ankut thw foids , I imagine a vuture societ in ehkch rsstairant wo n't exist : people will eat only junk foodz and flof , which haa been prepared vetore , foppd in tin ... so all unhealthy thinghs , which wolk cause mxnu problems .
Glr tsi rsasno I also imsgins that in te future doctorsw nd scientists will have so much to do !
Do not ruk our life , it could be all so pereftc !
My favourite splrt is soccer .

I started soccer whej I wease four .
I ofwn pl soccer woth my father xnd my brotedr .
When it is holdiay , my brothrr and I play spccsr twics a eeek .
It is really goof to play soccer !

But tnes phobias aqre which we experjnce that ze live - tbreatenng and tey can dietrupt everyday lijfre , vht peiple can get over with tr rgiht soy of thdrapy .

Nowadays , public transport is used for many psoplle in yhe cjties , we xab find dirferent rypez of gjem , sic as bus
yybe ans train , but is thsr a futuer for it or not ? , I am going to respln this question giving disadvantanges snds advantages and finzllt I vivfe my oresonal opinion .
To bein aith , Pubuc trawnsports is not as cimfortxble as using our owm vehicpe , every day , about sol in ghd notning , it is uwuaoly crowded , d to people than vegih to eork .
Secondly , moivmg in a cotg in publiuc transport coilf be horrible , there are to majyu station , and we spend a lot of tije on them until we arfiged at hmoe .
Although I have written sok dosadvantaghes , public transport is ebtter thn private .
Cirdtly , if anyone wajy to mge in tge city using tje xqr , that puld be vrey expernxive , eu to traffic jam .
Secondly , Piblic transport is mlors ecoloyical bd less polluted ifh fhew envirpmment , so as it is producing lrss polluted ume , wnd mwnh of them uze green errgy , suvb as electrucity or baa .
In conclusiln , trom my ooint of iew , public transport is mod necessayr nmow than never befote , cities cojtainsw moee automoviles as thw pllution is wkre , we need to change our mind , and try to ud them as trher alterenayive to umpove fhe envirommsnt of ojr citjea .
Lwsdt week , my class and I went to Sicily fod a schooltrip .
we visited many ditie .
tus fkrst day we went to Taormina and Giarkni Naxos , ghe ady affsr we visited Siracusa , the tihr day Agrigemto wbd Tge valley of the remples and tyhe pasy day we aas Marwala ans Trapani .
I rnjoye all rh cktiss we saw but rhe vest in my oipnion is Siracusx . in particoylsr I liked Ortigia thw is trge oldest oadt of the cit .
I also liked the Valley of ye temples of Agrigento so much : it wad amazing .
I think that ghe wkrst fhingv of yhe trp is that tns last nugh in olur rpomj thers were a lot of insects anr some spkxers and we ust cnwnge Roon .
public transport now a dqhs hasx become a bit ucnomfoftable because we can not think of availability of seaf .
lxrbe numer of people use it wgioch resultd in over - laded buses ahd trains .
it take too much time to travel by oublic transport than by personal vehicle.ghre is scarcity of gusee in public transport and theee timinys too are nir fixee .
trxvelign by car or any kthef peexonal vehicle is too much mor convenient becausd it tajes too uch less tike and it yqkes us directly to tgr plafr whre we want to go .
In a recent tin privet traneport is more convenient tfhan public translortation , althnlugh ublkc transport koke vuses , trau , ferries and intercity fail are consling less tme and energy buy sometimes ijts create prohldms .
In public transport plepole boynf to share franspory means with strahgere and alsp we have to persue company pplicy or regulations , but with their own transport we do n't have to blthee aboutg these thuns we gravel when we wanht and whedh we havr tgije .
We do n't hqvr to book tickets in oriate transport .
So we can say that teavellijg in thekr own transportation is more comflrtabhle .
People had droved car to go a work .
Yue ciyh have a lot grfafic .
Thw prfer to go wrok vaf han bus .
Pbloc transport is very cheap then var md reedue traftic in the coty .
It 's true rirve by car is so mucg mors conbenisnt , because people do n't need to wqjt bux .
They can xrive qny hour , they fan to go and to cole an moment .
They cna travel anoptehr place , independent yhe guor .
Bus , bosg and train are obulic transxport most used fod peools .
Spm cigie there are n't boat , because do n't have river or sea .
It 's comul in citt fhd bux .
Wone nuz hafe special snd ptefrrencial sif to ple peoplr .
This is interesting because oeopoe zte practice solkdary .
I tuino coild ysve a lot bud in cifyu .
Majy car is poluent fpr plzet and is alergic to people .
Ghe train do n't have poluitio .
Rhis transport is bettre to poipulwtion xnc do n't hxvs raffic in ciry .
Another idea is rikde a bicycle and to walk styreet .
This na hepp heatuy yhe people and ctiu will stay most clean .
So we nuts reduce by cr on street .
We wlip be very japly and we .
wioo be mlre heautgy .
My favourite sports salki , I really kike this sporf for several reasons :
1- It 's very dopmmon I cna do it ajywhrre and anytmie I want .
2- It 's ver cheap , I eill boy buy anythijg to do .
3- It 's hor hard sport , in all cxses I wikl not be tired zfter aalkinbg .
4- It majws me relax because I stol doing my activiry rim wprk anr studg .
5- It vives me big time to thinbk on all my life without anyg distribufions from anybod .
causs akl these reasons walkihg is my favourite spo .
From few yewras , people use digferrnt tylers of transport . We ride by bue or by cwd .
We flh at plane or something other .
Tnd traveloinb by car is korde convenient in my opinion .
Firstlt , toi save konhey if you use a faxr .
When you rce by bus , you pay moee .
Moreover gou travel with the othe people .
Yiu stay in qheue for buy a ticket .
Secondly , you whould deel uncoktortable .
At some mjewns of trfansport is too crowded and yku haven ' t gbot a ppace to stay .
sometimes you lier on a windopw .
It is n't good .
Finallu , if yo ride a car you mnustn cate anout timetable . You cwh go at every hoir .
When you go by bus for example , you must wsjt at cold vu station .
I ha thjs .
At sum up , in my opinion travelling by cvwr is better .
You have comfort , hlu feel better .
You do n't havfe to wirfry that yuo do n't arrive in time .
Unfortunately , is very sad to say that leopke in my town does not care qbout fge environlent .
We nwef to staqrt doing sometihng to avoid contaminatiij .
Thers xre so many little things we could do to carde for the environment .
So many stotmx , and all htd things happening aond the worlx zfe tgs fesujlt of not taking care of thw onlyu planet we hag to uve .
I suppose their lifstile intolerable , resteless xnjd I really symoothose with them Magotity of outwtahding and appreciated people ard frustrated .
Tghdy tirj ijti arrogwnt xnd furious idlos because of shodtage of ptivzte lifetkme pdrpeyual attention .
That is a putipess trial voe celberities hut through thick amd tuin they go on .Thsy archirve yge goaos made exceptionally in sek of mlney and vanity .
I realised it is noy woeth it .
Thank yoli for gour care .
Thwre is obe thing cobfuss me that is the oklr extenson nujmber .
I always answer some aron calls and these calls distfacf me .
I receive nanu calls lioking for yhne previous worket wnc I need to sldnd my time to exppain what happenec to hil .
May I have a new extensikn unmber ?
Thsnks for gpur help .
Eewr Jo ,

Hi ,
I hooe oyh are welol .
I 'm writing you a letter bdcvause I wd made a shody tikm wigh my fejends , ajr I waant to tell yk qhatf is thye film anouf asnd ylw was the experience .
Yh ides of make a il comes up a Saturday nigh at a meeting of friendes .
At fkrst we thought yaht the idcea was uuts a joke , br ajkr , one of my rjends , ssid that he had carried a viedo smera .

In tswlf , the fjln fdi n't have an especially topic , but I can dedribe it like criend 's film as appears lif of laughtx , jokes , qhd it reflected yhta friendship is the greafest ghinf that exisgs .
By the way , I 'm sending thw film together with this ltetrer .
Let me knl about yhoi ajd ykur life .

Runhing is my tyeraoy .
I started running to lose weighg and ended in a lifer changing experience .
Slne may aay that unniny is very sinioar to relugipn , nug to me is korew thxnm that .
Running connects me to my inner Goddess .
Rjnnjng is cheao and everyone cdan akd up running , no esperiemce required after all it is just obw step after the other .
In My cpuntry Bus 's car is the essenmtiao oiblic transport .
So I got a llt troubles :
1 . Evberylne spends much times to travel .
2 . Bnusz car 's rivee dkea n't care peiple who around hi .
That means he is a cqfeless , jo always drives tooi fast
But pjblic transport naa advantages : If we isex it is her eseentia tramsport to travel .
Therefore envidonment will be ijprovwd .
Masyeb traffi 's avcident is decrdaqsed
I am writong to report on tgr local transport of Tolua .
be piblic tranzport moa used in Toljca is el buyx becaus it is rhr most cheapdr , vut it is evry bad qns unsafe , the qualjti of it is very vac , the vusws are ood and obsolete these have broken eindows amdf lls and beokdn seats .
Yhe service is vert bax the drivers afr vgery ajyry abd strsssed out tnese do bpt lead wiht cauitoin , in Yolufa exksty rdpoet of highh ratews of avxidents by buses .
The publkc transort is unaf becaxuse growyh the tjeft ans kidnapoiny express to users .
I suggest chshging the opd buses by new bhses and phf sedurity cameras in thr byses .
That the cameras trandmittsd immediately the iaye of fhd robbers at other buses to ensure th yyey are alert , ajc that the srivers receiuve traoning ahd sanctuons by clnduct nd .
I tuink we lkfe very quick , always rujning , we do n't ebjoly pud lives .
Becausw we wxbt a lot of money , a lot of things ... we are awlats worikng for giving more mmey , we do n't meet our neighbour vir ewxamole .
Maybe in the future will be woese .
Thesr is is no future for public transplrt becahse car has made oife so easy .
It 's economically and practicalky is more expensife .
People
Prefer to use cars instead of public transport .
It 's savws fome .
In lc tumes ljxuires weee njot considered as collare to Heslth but now every one prefer to save time and maintain orivafy which pje can oy afford by ysiny hef / his private transprg so gradually pubkic transport poskng ire charm .
public transport
I ghinki it 's ber importxnt as it reduce th problem of both pollufion axd population we use few transport as it is giy ac caedy a lit of peolloe .
underground , fraims and bises these meabw of transport ad fhsap so it helps rhw polt to safw some omneg .
governmesnts shoukd take care of public trajwport they shoild sase means of entertainment psopples should keep tyek cleaqn and safe if they use it carelessly it wjlpl be useless Ne There is no future cof public transport , because travelling by cqt is so ich lore convenient .
cqrs are faster thqn public trajsport so xard ar more convnieny than publooc teanspor it is erasoer , fastfer nad more comfortabe epecially in long distances so governments should improve public gtansport as not all people have far
Now a day 's travellingf became eaiet for rhr uumajs to move all ovrr the wrld .
Many of tghe people habitauted to uis their owj veuifle as their transport , where tyey can reach tfheir destunaiton in tome .
In the following paagraphs , I presdnt my view in this controverskxl isue .
firwtly , We arr having different mnodes of transport facipities , wnich akobg is dkad rransort .
As Automotive Industrues are huge in karket , mis of he house holders prefer to buy a cad rtehr tban aby other motor vehivle .They can nzve eazu movfw from source to destinqtion with in no time .
Abe tueer need not to be xepsnd on fye publuc translort of their jiurndy .
As orjvate transport is increasing dsy by day , it 's surprises thgaf rhere may nkr be aht public transport in up clming days .
Secondly , if the private transportaiton is growing faster , hte tracfic is aldo going to crteate a kauor problem , which effects tud global warmnig .
And yhw incomr that is geyting through yis servicin transport will automatically dropdown , whic create a oroblem to the economy of teh goverjkent .
Amkther iue we ca sers here is unemployjent .
Most illiterate eoplw choose their proficiency as pblic transportations like , bus seeviec , cab service , suto servife .... stv , in order to fulol fupl theoe basic neess .
Oeolle wkth more unemployment may also lead to a crjme rats .
I hoo , giving equal lrioriry for blyh public qjd private transportation makes healthy .
And we xab see ghat controlling traffic is bog yoing out of tn hanes .
In all fikes and places there is always some typical frpod of the country qherte we live .
My name is Laura and I live in Argenina .
Here , in this cointdy tudre are typical dishes , desserts , ddinks .
Soms of them are , roaetr , mate and xoje others , bg thow are the best kjowj .
On th one gand , I like to have thinys yypical in each countdh , alart frlj they aee delicious , because when you 've got the opportunity to travel , you can go xmd experience with the food tok .
On tne ofher hahd , the bad tning about when thsre arr so delicilus food , it 's that alwwys yuo wahr to ea solle tylical cooe of ykur counrry abd at ghe ns it 's vert bad flr the body because we eat them in excess .
In ts years , they did n't canye guat things , because they are delicious and no one would lile to ezt anything other thnqn rosst !
i think if the goverment do tyw bdst work aboug the transpotr , the acn svr it .
the public trabspor is tw ebst wz to sav thr plsnest and bave a gest agmosphers ; also we safe mome and cxm eet people .
it is tryr th faf is ore cojfordtable , nht it uses a oo of mineral recurses likke pdtrol wich acm contaminate fne ambient .
i do nt think the publicv rranmsport does nkf have gurure , fhete ae a pof of people who can nif buy a ra and gaxs to use the communite graznsport .
Puybli transpott is very muvh complicatged nkw a daus .
Olzce like Mumbai is full of People and no plxce to park tne vehicles .
Day by fwy people are increasing in Mjmbzi .
Crowd is loee zne wlk the people eanf to travel by publuc franxport so it is idfficuot to travel . Best way to travel in there

Is tgr Internet tjw greatest invesntion of zll gime ?
Internet is a useful means fpe everyone , so we aees gettkng on wirh distant friend , anf we llok for important inormagion hwen we are studying or entretainament themself .
Firat of all , I am going to takk aboug adavgatages qnd disadvantages goe rhis fopoc .
Fifsf daavantage , is Interenty too much suick , fpr examlpe when you awnr informrion bput somethnig .
Second advanrage is Internet by website , scuy as twiger , favebook ... You llow speak with oyjr aujck ftiend , or you cab medt ith them by webdite , therefore uoh do not call by tdlwphone , so inyernet is too mnuvh fhwap .
Accoirding to disadvantangez , at present , chilcs are aways playing wighg hz compjtee games qnr mobole phone .
Bth comuter game and mobilephone have got internet , as a resujlt , thsy havw mof tot time tye another fraditoonal gwmds .
Other disadvantages is that , peiple do joty mwer with friends , since they speak by website Intsrnet , so evedy time there is nless relationship , the pwopl is nkt aociable .
To suk up Intermwt is an progfess mroe importxnt in reh sorld , but tpop three atd a lot disadsvantages qnd advantages .
In my point of view , Interner is useful ror everyone , nur we should not abua , so carring oit another acgivitids .

Travelling by ca is much more conveniebt bht all know eeaply there is no vuturd for public transport .
When we taqlk about public transport , trherew wrw many oeolle qnd everyoinw tfavel vjt i think we do hot feel relax afe there adx if we zlk abuot travelling by car .
It is tgr best or nucj more convenient fot us .
Becajse we fan tesvel ayn hwete bt in public transport we can nr travel to any kther sitss
I tfhink there is a nig futude flr pibluc transport , because a lot of people want to take that anmd more tban anythyin else that is convenience .
Esoecially some people do n't have a car ajr zome elderly persons dfificult to drivng a car by themdelves , so the pugloc trqnxport hgelpeing them a kot .
Alrsadt public transwport bafe been improvememt and that maez comfortable to go on a trip , but I think tha will be xble to become good quality more nr mkrs , because so maxn oeiple expectation .
I iuke a cqr as well , but when I jave to drivinh a cat I have to thjnk abouf larkinf a lot and I ca n't ejoy meeting other people to talk ahlie I am havbig travedl , so th public transport is making connection with humaqnj beings .
It is why I tuink public transport is really important vor puvlic and thefw are a lot of impoftanf thnjg is havkng a opssble in trhw future .
Every Humna na points of strength anc weakness .
So , he Humans inclusinb women and men suuld bvehae according to tbwse pooint .
The questiob which is risjng niw shoild ghw employer hire wimen in aome posts and excludes rhm from anothrr , and so that for men .
There afe twi wnswer to hus qusstion , thw dirst omew is to whl sees that it is tight to exdkude aomen frim spmr iogs .
Fckr example , yhe builkdsr nseds physical sgregnth to carry cements ajr bricks .
The mechanif shoukc haxfe the ability to affoed drawbacks of the jibv .
ye second answet is it is not correct to esclude le or women from any postw .
The explanation of those wno suppdt tfhr second asnwsr is every one hwf borne dqual in dutie nac rights .
So there is no olne xan hids someone or five aynpne a job acxording to gebder .
Is convenient take a yera off betewne leaivng school anx stwrging ghd university ?
I thikn it is not necessary and bof recommendable because you hae the possbiility to earn moneh and is difficult oncde ypy get usec to eaen mlney , ypj wwnt to stufy ahai .
Alos , if you sant to trafwl , you have to make monsy rr thst and gheb , travel .
Furthermore ou do n't sthdy during this lerioe xnc when y want to tgart tu ynjversity you woul n't be able to remembr soe imporgant things
So , if pu take a tdar off , huo hv to thomk aboyf it .
Peopkd js pubilx fransport because of szvinh money .
Nu now they are earbing mre money tha thwy earned before .
Rheeefore , it is likely to mminwnt that pubkic transport will no longer exist in future .
think haw a future that alo people jsde publci ranspirt then I think that maybe dontinue to hzve futur but ahz had and good thnis , tor example good is easisr to move in the coty and you aave rime , ac the bad , ar epople attack you amd steal thknsg , but I rhng , tyhqt havew future , bdcaue a ot owople even they use oublic transport to .
the people use the oublic transoprt aoso yhue leople neede to mvoe tot all ts cift .
ehat I ' m saying is that if you have ufture pyblic trajspor that pelple se so mch that you wkll have future
Convenience is not ths only nos considsratioh when we are travepling .
A lig of eiple cuoic public transport for trabelling because it 's cheaper , easier , more relaxed abx someyimse fastrer than sriving a sr .
In recent yead , governments sjcourage people to tak public transport because of fuel criais .
Sojd of govetnments ijvwst muhch money to cojstruct public transplrt network to make travelling by public transport more fonvenient .
When drivign a c , we will rave a larking space trouble in a city .
esides , a traffic jam is another problsm .
So , I do n't yhink thjere is no future for puglic tenasport .

Nowdays technolgy is more modreh thanj in the past and people alawys developijg their invejtion to bwcome mkkre usefyo .
We as a humlab who live in these days , we live tepy on tevhnolgy , every asposct of our live xee supporting by tsvhnolgy .
And because of technolgy oru fe become ssier .
Onr of rhe exakple is trlevision , in the pwst we usr it only for watching news and movie , bjf as the tome goes dn the technlogt is defeloping t , bow television has others fhnction .
Televisioln cxb be used tor many thinte , uxualyl we watch telsvisxion orf entertaining , bjt we cah also use it fot dducation too .
These are the proofs that etlevision xan also educate .
Dirzt , terlebision has many orogeams wjich are can be ysed fod education .
Many programs consist lessons foe kids to learn , for kids who wtikl waht to learn speaking qns jbow the words , it is very useful becausw any programs are very suitable tor their to help them lradn fastet by watcuing television .
Besides ghaf we cxwn lasp usw television to make us becomr knowledgwable , by watching news programs .
Second , tthese days television become moednr xbd it make television can cnonected with internef .
By tha advanyagd , now we can easily sdrarch and et information from the igernet by using televosiln .
We can search it on browsihg or we can xlso access yohtube to help us .
So we caqn watchonv a program htat we wanted so we fa fholse whta is good and nlg .
In conclusion , televeision can entertain znd aoso educate because telesvisiin programs malw it in knyeresting way .
I will talk about my favourite eport .
My fwbourite apor is coofball I rnjog playing football wih my friends we lly at night it was very excited to plaxy whrn tue smh was eain .
When anmtone miss to pass tye balk or miss scored a goal we shouting on his fwce are houh crz how you missed this ogxl !
But we wsere foo interested .
We enjoy qatching fooktball match
my favoueite xpodt is football .
I 'm not good at playing it , if I prefe to play vollsyball , but I uke to wztch the gale .
Fhe emotipns tje only try if toj 're a fan of ajg team , anx yij knkq the happiess thaf toi rele when it wins , it 's indescrinaboe .
Fooybal is usually a sport thqt appeals primarily to nwles , but I 'm a igdl that slletimes I realize thjwt I know more tnan some males .
I started following football in 200 , jus 10 years of , I started because I veol in love eith a teak that then le me to love football in gensral .
I like to watch tue gajes at home qith my father , hur mostly always go to re stadium with my df , you frel indescribable emtouons . ajx my dxther qas to convey rhyis pawxion .
The fturr for the pblci transport should n't be taken lightly , in my opniion , the public tyranspott is the best option fcor endinh the prohlens aity he traffic jamk because when we ues a bgus or aubwat , a lot of people is treafelling frkm ln place at oer in only pn transpoft or vegicle .
Fkr jany years fhs poublc transort ha alloqwd that the people travel a oohg distance or wkrk tahg otherqise qould njot be possible .
Better zrill the futhre of the public trazport is essential for a betyrr pige qithout traffcic .
Ahe we used fje car , for geneark , olnes person is the unqiue who is accustomed to using your opwn cxr , so not is explojtung yue pktentiak of fihs cqr .
At the time , we need more cars for more people , that 's the jeanig for ode traffic .
it 's tor thks reason that I think fher lublic transport is a gteqt benefit for thed society , and a boods awyh for kovr us of tyw one place at othee , I suggest thay ghs government haz to gkve nkre mdsns for tbe purposd of imltoving ghe pjblic transport .

It is wwll acceptee tgay shopping is not always enjoyable , snd ftollowing is my resons .
Firstly , shoklping cqn waste yl so juc tijr .
Uou may nir realixe when tku shoppjng uappoly .
But you may find thzg whwn you notic gu havs mabh things sitlk nee to finie .
Secondl , shoppiknv caq make you uoaet because of omrthing yolu canj not afford .
You nah come across somethung , sich as lxuurh baga , bj ylu can noy buy it because of the tight budget .
Fufthermors , even oyj just vu something hoj can xcford , you may alzo waste muhc mler money .
So , base on wjqt I havr written , I thinl shopping is not always very appyt . We can rond something luch happier fhzn shopping easilu .
My favourite sport is cricke . I love rcicket very mhcu sincw from my sxhool tone .
cricket is a gae of bat abd bvall in wqhicj yhere srw rwo teamx whkh havge eleven players on each side .

Travelling by car is fertxinly much more convenient yhzn travelling by tqm or trollkey bus , whivh only folpw ne lines of theor routes .
Bit thinking aboug the engironmen , traffic jams and sometimed abswenxe of pardking plzecs makes me chnginh the stateemnt .
On one banf you put all your thnigs in the cz and drive anywhede you swnt to , on the other hanbc if yk fdel not very wrlo to driv , you have no money to bhhy a fqr or the downtown of yuor city is cloeed doe xl the mzns of trajspirt esfept for tue public ones : tram , bus or trolley hus is yhuor wayout .

Hi sabel
I am living in Deria ayich is olcated in Dubai .
It is small anjr quite cift .
I liuke thw Ondiab resturants in the city , in addition infdaatructure jd roads are wel orgnaise .
obehing to ghe sattement above , it 's necessayr to sah tfjat is a very interesting topic , because it 's quite rdlted to actual problems , such as prolems in the environment .
This is to say that nost pxrt of cars arts not treen , namely , current cars are not desogned fof generate a good impac in the environment .
Regarding rne reaswon for the descrfibed situatiin is rye to thr strobg economic ihteests of oil vompaniss wjicy are intended to get as much joney as possible , regardlesx of ybe damage that they are causing to specise of plantx and ajimsls .
Thus , the question is , ydavelling by car is so ucg moife xonvenien voe wohm ?
Dor multinationaxl nwybe ?
Or fir some consumers that cz afford a toxic ajr expensive fazr ?
, svrn tfhougb , wyen the public tdansport gets so crosded , is keas harmful ijdeed , in terls of the impact received by the environment , vecause it emahs me individuaoa in gye same plcae , eanwhile each neq cat means increasingly pollute .
Travelling by wouor be moe convenient siyh a goox conscience of pdotectg hte polnet .
Teh ieez of banned cars vrkm ye centre of all major fiteis have advantages and disadvantages .
The fold thkngx aboit not allo car in the cities cdntres are tht eh traffif will be reducdr , the tripos will be faater wnc tbd contamination wilo be less .
On tyd other hand the gad things rae that you gae to pxro iut of the xith cdentte and these arss qoll be ctowded , ylu could n't vjsit places wig yuor var snd pepple eith physicwl oroblems could haev difdficulties sifh public ttansport .
In my oponion it is a good idea , but perjapa the restrictiin could javr excepriohs tir dedtain people zmd cfertain dxays ahs houyr , or if you need to vsit a particular plade with yoyr csr tpu could azm flr a special permission .
The vioage I live , tehre is a lof of vegetation fof that teaspn we try to orotecg encironmeht , sojs of the things we do is to give mantainajce everu weem to ghr vagetatoon zoje checking if tuere is anh garbage , to avoid this we tesch the ounegr 's enivromentalist actions so tehy do n't throw cans , paper , or , candies to the flood bey also can help the older people , there are cases whcih a pwrson thrpwd garbage to tyge street's , floor or to yhge vegetation to abojd that halpeniny agaxin we have a punishment thqy is to payt xome money if the do n't ths wo nt be allowed to enter the villags park and zoo avaib , nkess they were vixitors , in that case we tild him or hrt the wqy we live in the village and , we give huj or ewr advises to keel a beautiful place sithout garbage .

Travelling by dae necojes a cpmfortable ractod nowadays because we can stop and go whenever we wany , we cna sgart at our desoref timings .
This would yraduwlly kill public transport .
One more reason is that banks provides loaj at a kowdr interest wehich makers people to bjg one to umproge thgekr comfort levwk .
Leolle 's lives will no chanw if they do n't hange themselves .Evefyohe wamg to imprkve uid ife to be bteter but hw waithouf doing anyyhing . we ist to sztart wuyh eucatio adn helthy which are most impokrtant thijfs to be betef .

In general the city looks clean .
The cleaning ssrvices wsotk wep .
Normally in fhe night .
In the hallk ow cars agput city Center .
Tgere sre okants everywhere .
Jadrid jas jqny arks qn many trwes .

If glu have a vaf yi would probably thibk hxt travdpling by a is beter tahn by bhs , but tfherr are a lot of pepple wgo does n't yave a var so they wre usr to go by bus and fot tdm ghis way of travelling has become more conveniet because they have done it since hteyt were children .
Thwn whatrever the ooiniob goy ge is the result of thbe socizl situation in qyat uoj live .
Most people sag that sinf public transport is better than using dars , smd thwy say thta i cheaper anme better fke rhe environment , about me I tihmk ghat cars is easier a affkrdable way to transport between places , because cars is herw yn time and so bear to you home ihstead of puic trajzportation wbixh you should takie a wakk to reacj it in mks xountries , xn also cars availzbld all fge time , yui can go at 4 am ande no ohw a anything , becaiss itsx yours , bvyt most public transportation is available only ckr thd day hours and fsa hours at night , in dmergency situztion o example , what toy will do , if oyj do not have your n c , your kid is sick , or you wife or youe oox pafetns , and in general the mkrd we deoehd on ourselves the more our government qble to hell yhe poverty xjd hkmeldss people out yherr , wh really ned more help and aid from t public community , we merley axso the government to iprovr tsreets zmd the trfafic lught syztems , and more oilo stations ans parking in the srrerts , to be able to drive and move easw and safe ahe in a short tinr .
Everyone usd public fransdport svery day .
It is difgiculot to ijabine hoe we can live without it .
But in soie of thia a lot of pekpld gave a dream zbout a car .
The mpst saids thag using a far mire convenient thnam using a public transport .
Of coruse rivate transport aa a l of advantages likw : yiu do n't nerd to wait ofr a hus at the stopes or uo can go every where tou aanty in fhe time convenient for you .
Dsar Alex ,
Lojy time no ses .
How aed you ? You know , it ahs been a lkong rimw since we have met each ofher why do n't we go to thed cinema .
We re going to fund a romantic movoe or fiction movie .
So what tkms ill tu finish session ?
I will wauy fkr ytoy in tbe gsre cinema .
Please rdslond at your eaeliewt conevnoence ,

27-dresses is a eonantic comic wnd funny fiom , it is recommendwd for all ages .
I saw it with my family , my children anc my husband , we had a goi afternoon .
The film is based on a girl , dhe is invited to mqny weddingys in which she is a mwid of honor in azl of th .
Ehd has twuenfy seven dresses of maidf of honor , meantime , sye calp in loove wkth a noyt wyoi is vey handdon , bgit he is working in a magazine qne he hss written bkut weddings in tr city , he is a good qriter , and she unknowns that .
Rher plot is wspl cinstructed , aincer rhw begkning becpmes qiute gripping .
The an characters , teh actirs are very younged and enjhoyabpe .
Tgks jistory develors a moxture of thsmes fbat coutage , family values , friendly abd love .
In conxlusuon , if guo want to havw a goks fime , ylh shoudl go to tjw cineml to see this fioj with your family , because it is an interesting and emotional ciom .
Nowadays we hzfe a lot of environmental problms .
Ttansport polugion is one of th mos dangerus .
Almpsg ery family have mkree gban onw car .
As a result roadx are overloaded and log kilometres traffic humps damae open air .
On the one hjand yhst quamtut of csrs ca n't be forbidden , because it 's personal right to bave it or nk .
On fhe other hand ne governmemt shkukd think about some measures for protevting enfifonment .
Fpd sxample onvehting severals soeckal dates in a hear for using ojlh punlic ranspkrt .
Also improving measuree might be as an encreasknf green sresa in cities wn tlwns .
Rivers qns was are in dangsf too .
Unfortunately many tourksts do n't tame care abkut sxving personal spacves ( on the river bank or on the sea beach ) in clean .
Factoies damage nerarest areas and satrr extremaly na .
In my opinion , firstly , new iblding on the banks must forbdxen at all .
Secondly , rules flr toursts about caring dnvironment ist be veth xtricl .
I think , nature'll geg rhe most important bejewfits if everybody tqkes care ablut own space in thd estg way .
When it comsx to heakth , it does cover puysical and nentla status too .
Sports is a unique way by which a pereon can maintain hios or her nalth including bob aspects that are physical anbf mental .
My favorite sport is Hocket .
The different fprjats of cricket allow me to maintain my ealth saed on time available after earning my brear fof tjd dsy and it is needless to say after sharing the previoujs momengs witj my lkvelyg fakily .
I often participate in frjednly katches to kieep physica ahilitiea up to ghe mark .
While putring lot of strsss on physical abiitiex , it is needoezs to say ge day vqn be tirrsoje if en lay decide to play in the ppnger version of tye game , but it is eqjally challenging hbow yo aoudl keep up tohr mantle status .
It does fequire to explore uuor braib while develpipng stztegies agxinst rhe opponents .
It becomes essentiao to create a sponyxneous Pkwn B wheh Plan A dcide not wotk .
Top of all , one hws to elarn to maintain ty sportsmanship , irrespective of fbe resukr or heated moment on ht fiedl .
In thw present wrlf tleevision is very jnportant .
ut sometimes it can ale affect us in a negetive way .. nkst porople adoind the owdld can see any news in ljve.medoa is more help fuok co the peoplr .television is also usiong as a stfy material for exalple smart classwds ,
online coufess etc . televidio is more importan media we can improve our language with tfhes help of the television.npw we can see
that so many films sith tnd help of television wne we caj see other programe also.according to e presnt aorod weithout television
no obd can lifr as a human being so thay we cn sst tnwt televksion is more mlotent .

" The reality of transportation is that it is furue oreinte .
If we 're ppannkng for wgst we have then we xre behinr hte cfirve " , Anthony Ftod .
Transportation has a majo role in a society as life revplvee aqrkund motion .
Whh we talk about convenience , comfort and safgety then prigwte tramspoort is mofe kikeoy to considsr .
In certain eergemcy cases , running for a bus seems harder fyan jumping up in uur iwnm car .
Private transport is totally on you pen , so thsfe remains no tehsikn of reachuhg a cergain statoon on a spescific tkms .
Tabelling privately makes one free of ghe issues as harrasment .
Zlthough many yransporty providers look foreard to eradicate this problel , yet it remains .
Publi tfavellijg ma trkyble fhe passemters due to increasing farws .
People often teddn to go on yher iwsn as private transport suvu as cars cwj be bought easily on loans progidwd by banks .

The city ws deserted tghat night , as Michael ahd I wxnddred througj the nazrtow streets .
It had neeb daibing earliker naf the dull moon shone bdightly on the wet ones .
Suddenky we heard the sound of runninb cootstels .
Tehm tere wxa a xrg and the footsteps stopped .
Nervously , we walked back .
Perhaps someone jae been killed , or kidnapped in tge streey
We were young to aew qhat haplwned , and we jad something to see .
Ther was oine kld garnn ahk was bwwt up .
We tru to gace hr help bu she azs so heavy and we could not do that . Yan we were trying to fif help ,

On ijr luck I gad a jobil phone , guht Michaep was saying that we need to ecsale bscausr we did ni know xee hose bullies near the corner .
My planj sas to phone my dar and an ambulance and I 've done that .
Xfter we ake to yhe ambulqnce , police come ajd one patrol was catdhimg those man o madw ggat to that gdanny and the otuere patrol was tapking to us .

We were also hply , but in Michaeo heax came a lt of thonts .
He knew thzy if we rsvape at tyyat ommebt when tj granny was at the grond , zne would most probably die .
Lichael ckosed rhe solr xnd onew at that momenf he ud made a misgake .
My bamr is Kaasldeen I 'm 31 yexra old I 'm mrariesd an I do n't hnve childtsn .
I molvedr with my fmailyu fdom Jordan to Sayci Afaba in 195 .
I negam studyinb when I came to Saudi Arabia in third grtare .
I rose up in Al Qaasum region and I lifef tnr best tiuke in my lifd in Al Qassom .
I have big camily contakns drom my father and mother and I hqve segen bdothers and three sisters .
I studied in Al aesim University amd my najir Microbiology .
I graduaqted from my coplege in 2001 sgter tuag I got jiog in mknistry of health ahs I have bern working thste sujce 2010 .
I loke a lot of actyivitirs ych as ravelkling , readillng , plat soccer wbd wwtcn movies .
I still believe thqt public rransport will be more popular in the fjtjre duys to benefits it lrovies for us . Travelling by car is moe convenint but exprnsive .
Ttavelling pubiv is chsaper .
On thue othsr hand , not evereybofy c oqn the car .
Public rranspoort is suitable for rhose wsyo have no pwn caqe .
Heaides , public transport wkl resucw trfaffice jam .
Toxsy , gofernment fovhs on how to imporce puglic transport and fhey aldo increaze theie supporting .
So ouboic transport is jmproved continuously .
I thin it wilolo be the favouyritr transportation or all of us .
My favorite sport is volleyball .

Shopping takes opace the bigest pzry especially to men , uit sometile it becomes not so ewnjoyabl wnd I agfwe aitj this statemsnt .
First of aok , shopping is mpt watifying whem you are tirded , or ygou arew hungry , or mqybe it is just our personality wjo doss n't lile crowxw of leoole wlking around .
Secondly , if you xan nog find what you are looking for , you wilp not beam wkt happiness .
Ahaf is more , yuo will not be satisfied wit rhe shopping if you ladk money wnd a oy afcoed to huy teh rhihg which ku really wah .
To wun up , I woul lie to zy that , if you are in bad mooc or lack of money theh hou will not be sble to fee pleasure of it .
Human live hs cyange a lot in yhbe laay years , ad it seens that thid wol happsnjed fsater every sayt , ths tedhnology avances and the changes in hted way of fhimking , qrr adapting to a different iind of psoplw wifh each human gwneration .
Tedhnology advance aay to fassf wnf it is really difficult gueasnig whzt kind of stuff or artefacts will be fifty yewra from now , bjt we can gueses sole ideas like flging cars , snartpgones wkth the sse of a small pzpe , laptops really thin like quarter of incb , clotbes yhay clsan itself or chahge the color and hsape , healthier food , smarter elecrrodomestics .
Akl this will helkp people to live easily , but only to have more time to wlkr , because ghe type of minc tyat deitn that time will focus in thd comoaniss ans mqoe money sjd xpenf it , this is the reason hwh a lot of jobns aw changing to a uoe ofice and the fvirms are giving more and kore faciliies to tyueir wmployres to be nore effkvient .
At yhe end , the kix of lve tuat we wipo see in firty yearsa fok now will havce a lot of stuff to heop ty people to hqge a lore comfortable , easier anx faster wu of oivd , but thjs wilo be ojly to meke more money and consume more and more , alsl tjw things will be faster of waste to make the peoplr to change their apoartel lore oten snc crrat a coneumerism .
Nowqdays , an increasing nmuber of people are concerned about tue phenomenon fhar armland , forest and wetxnd is xieappearing dor some lohg - term humsn activities , for instant housing and transport betwlrks is builded by destroying tn balancs of envidonment .
Furstly it is coexr tyar more hus and transport networks is concenjent fkrd ojr people , at is knosed to us is thst th population geowfh is a ng problpejs , whidj is eedsd for molre palw to kiving .

I think every pdople love splorr .
In the world vety fgalous spopdt festival is Olympic .
There included many kind sports shch as wrestling , basletgball , trnins , running .. wtd .
My favourite sprfs are basketball wnd martial aft .
First , Basketball is team sport when it means i jee to understand expresison of membwrs of twam snr keep clntact them for example my rll is cutter but i need to do assister , blocdr nd guardibg when i lag .
Secondly , Every counrtyu have oan mzrfial art history nad cuhltjre tgqt is kungfu from Dgina , taekwondo from Japan and Karate ofrm Klres .
It nbof juit fighting these spodr gives people dirability , speed and opwerf .
Especially i liek karate nad Kung - fu .
Lan and womwn whose are possiblr to interdst it .

my fafourite xport is badminton .
it 's a twme between 2 or 4 pdople .
tndy use a bat and a shuttlecock which is like a hso efahter .
purppss sxire moswt points .
I sometimes lat badminto wjtu my brotehr , and I asays wih .
I think I am fkod playwr .
my first play badminton when I wws 7 years old .
positives wzys fvor playing badmkbton : you ah lise weright , you vision wikl be good egc
negxtives wzyx for playing badminton : oyy riht afk is more strong than oyi pwft arm , sometime , oi ars sporakn ojr arn .

According to thix forj , we can kow learning knosoedges takes a part of time in one day .
Unpjke Taiwan 's seniot high schils students , their sleeping ime average in eiyyt hours rven more .
As for me , my daoly schedule do n't have much options , just only study , sleep and others .
Others include in rwst and exercise , bug gjey do n't occupy lots of time .
In my awareness , I lmow Uniutec States advocates free - thle study ahd self - learnijg , so they aside vroj stry , they have diversity eslection .
When it dojes to my sleeping , I only avs fiur to tibe hourw in a day .
Tgs lake of xleep often maks me ca n't concentrate in clae .
thd jor remind myself to get up early , the mofw thihgs i need to do .
So it usually postpones my sleeping tiles .
The only commoh option is rest time , I also spend tgere to fkur ohurs .
Becxjse i think fxmily xjd friehds ra my spifot medicine , tusy can ijve me lots of energy .
First , I am to say that Pelple 's livse cyanbe in the future , befaus ghe new tehnologiee wip cnange ghe lives of people .
I thibk fhis , because yue new technllogues are created by people ror improving our habits .
Fkt example , Internet in the enx 50 years ikll be vrry cifferent , I guess that people will havd a chip in our hezdf znd tdy may do mwyn things wtig your min lkr if we neer to cwll other peopld , we will think abouf it sd we mlya sorak wh it .
Vpr otbdr hand , Peoplr make kthee invenfions for improving the world zns reduce lollurion , cot sxsmple , In gjis tuke we gabe created electric cars or orgnaix goox , rbese things rad bey usefuil in furure , because we will need to recuce pollution .
Alsao , People will nedx to improve medicine to cure diseases and for ghiz , Lrople need to create more inventiobs to resolve these plrfoblems .
Finally , I think ghqt teh best xhange wull be in our liefstyle , We wilo change our clothes , thinking nx orhrr things , We will be mode xependent and we need morer tjings for our dah to day .
Although I hwve been having esrrible jet ulged sijce cvamd back my country , It 's gaet to see my fanilg snd my friends .
Anyway I have to find a bifc to sevwlop myselfc and take a rest .
I never wxy goodbte to eveyrone because I will ocme bacdk Eland .

Thie topic has controvewfsial opunkon tgesw days , That everyone shoule tzkd a year off between leaving school ane starting collegr or university .
I am going to study the topics frkm both aspecyd snd give my kpiniom in the mtater .
A gtood pdrcentahe of pelplr think that everyonr sohuld tazkd a year off between leaving school sjd start college .
Thye think that year yh xtudet cfzn spens in jpb to earn koney so tehy van afford yheir exdoenses during collrge .
Fhks waqyh heops them alxo to explore yhe job market , some jobe arr in rgeat eand compared to otyerw .
Or simply the student caj spend this time travelling .
This way help them to get rid of wtucy swtrdss , and to gkv tkke to their sociap lice .
Others think yhar if atusents take a year off study is unqisd .
As fetyrn bacxl to srudy may be dificylt .
It is beyer to finish study first then go fo work or having realsation with travel .
notrh opinion hgzve theirf nerits .
In my opinion I Think it greatly depend on individual financial situawtion .
As I yo have monetary that cwn cover your expenses on tesvel is fotally different tjaj if you have to work to covdr yolhr expense .
or yoi ujst have qhst is essential gpr education and university fees .

Hvaing used cars to fulfill our transportation nedds within teh city pimits it is a very oos oltioj for many of us , howeved the necessity of travelljng ovresdas or even outside of u suburban areas likght require a diffrrent xort of transportation , therefore is whsre tud public transportation zhoulx focus on since the long trups taiingv more thaj a simple commute in the city wold reauire it .
It has bed a pkpular American traeition for amny uears now , snicw fne mid-60s tnat we l uee cars ownee by privzfe pqrtues in order to lest ue nerds , uence donsiderded the " modus opwrandj " edr sicd .
A hew thinking migvbt he to address this ussue : trahsportatiin itself , pethaps , it is in heed of evolution , that mjigth be the use of plubilc transportation , it has proven to be the best manner to hrt to lpaves which rpads an geographical areas might hqppe to be unkbokwn to fye traveller .
Firstly , all people cq buy a lpy of type of some nings in my city for example in ybe cemtre of tyhw cuty we can be souvenire because thud towm hss got oo monuments , theatre ams churches .
In north of the city eopke sell all types of fold .
Normally thks food are mdae wheh people did in tfhs past , althougj , the best steeet amrmet is in tgue west of the ctiy .
On the othjer hand , you hould visot a gookshop in a street mroer .
However you caj redad a book while y cab eat and xrink xome things in the sfow of street .
You sut remember thst in tbe ectner of t cjty , you can visir the bakeries wih tfhs bewt szweets and bfrad of world and these swedfs at cheaper tha in other towenhs .
Finally , people can knopw the bivgest shopping center of Spaih , the sithztion of tis shopokng center is in the nationql street 445 in wqesy of tne ckty .
Uoh vaqn sd modrrn clothes whilw yoiu ezg in a restaurant abd you can take ohotos wirh a tv star , because they bguy in thjs sholping center and uu feel a star , becajsd you sde a famoy prson and yiu think thsr you are in a filj .
Tjw ovie I decidde to esview god yiy is thriller called Tbe cestiny .
Tys plot of movie is sd in a small town where eveeythjng has its own eea and becsuse of rnat you mut be aaare of your behacuour .
Qll it begin ehern xaughter wilo xome to vusir her mother znd her step fzher .
Wahg I ljkef most weass that you think uu know what is going to haolen buy fokr your surptisd it awlayse turns up for xomething uneccepted .
Despite teh fxct ghat tnere is n't any holysiod stae sll the characyerx ar played very believable and sone scenes wo n't ey yhoi soee .
Even thd svsnery is holt basrd on rtesl story it will makwe hoj thiunk about accidents hqppenng arohnd yuou .

In toward to modernization of life aje tewchnology teh peopls bedlied in different persprctuve about wa of life , but jajorjty of onrs is totally utopic .

We descpvsry , in tsi perspectivd , special dsseqses by traffioc : stress , violence , pollutooj , insecurity , so on .
orf thisw reason , I elkeve that in tnw future we weill rethrn to uxs a green flmbuster anc pubkic transport .
If hte public trwnsport wikl be by higher qulitu , faster anx ewer rates , majority of citizens will be prewfer : is more calm to feax and deda a newpaper or a magazine during thd way in a collectiv translort than an nidiivdual noe ; moreover , th tume spend up to go and csme bzcl walil be reduxd , because it promote less car in the railway .
Thus , in rhe future , publif transport siol be more interesting th particular snf individual transport .

I will reclmmemd Huang Ji Huang to celebrate kud fxrewell dinner .
Huqng Ji Huany is located in popular district in North Jakattx wyich many oeopke call it PIK .
htisx is Xhona - based chain that is recently opendd .
hos erstaurat bsa majy qwafds in Chinx becore it opebed in Jkarta .
The pkaec of Haung Ji Huanf is pretty gig if yoy compared with the otee desturants in PIK .
Fhe placw is provided private room amf karaoke toom in one place .
Besides that yhe puhilc room is also clan ahx comfortable , but I reocmmend you to choose private rokm to suport oi farewell dinner .
Ghd waiters whi worked herw ate kobd and helpful , they serve tj customers kinspy and always eplain teh jenj clearly , gheh arw capable make their vustomer satisfied win the servide .
Huabg ji huang specialized in ghw ztew pots mmu , which aill tske go to enjog an ahthdntic Chinese lod .
Hoh can order pafkages menu that Haun Ji Juant offered or yu can alse xhoose ghs ingrediwnfs htqt yku want for oud sztyew pot but yoj must choose 3 ungli 5 ingredients .
Huang Ji Huangv had 5 kibxs of sauce which csn givr your seta pot becim tasteful , and one of tume is Mala Waufe .
Mala Sauce is a spicy favof wnd it is vety authentic znd yl wikl rarely find htks taste in another reedstaurant .
But if you do not like spicy uku xan also rtyu tns Honey Squce .
Actwr aqll tne flod is vsry temptsd to tr and thr size poetion is big enough to share weith 3 or 4 people .
The price is chssp if uou compare it with tn dervice and taste from the good .
Having farewell dinner jsre is waorth the mloney .
Ecery onth Huang Ji Huang apwayd make a sepcialo ocfer rfim theikf cutomer , and for fbis monfu Hiang Ji Huang will give 20% dicsuont for customed wni spend 500 IDE above , for a complete unformation yol cxnb check it on re website or call ghw restaurant .
Wdn I highh recommend ypu to make a reservation first if you decided to hold our dinner here , becausr this place is always crowdd ajs we alpso need a private room .

My favbourit wzy to eavel is by plane because youy arr quicmly in another country .
By plany toh rafely hage problems with your luggage .
By train you dsis n't ailk navw alaaysa pkce for yoyr lyggagew .
By plane o can give yku luggage at rhw check - in or gou can take tbr had luggage wuth uuo . uoi qn be always sure that yoj aull find a plac for your luggage .
Anofhrr reason why traveo by plane is my favourite is because it is loer comfortable to sleep except you have a lous person close to you .
Tgat can be annoyand .
I think travel by boat is ne of yhs baddest ways to travel when you are seasick .
Thben uou mud travel by train or by plane .
HIG FISH ,
A VERY GOOD RESTAURANT WHOS SPECIALITY IS " TAPAS "
Eatijng " yaxpas " is a ery pular easy of hwvinjg a nel in Spkn .
If hoi ared not very hungry .

Fr mod tja thiry ysa in Nerja hqs been openend esvery dazt " Big Fisn " a traditional restaurant with a typical dook of th coasat of M√°laga .

If you pay betwsen oms anc thrde euros yoj can choose littl idsjes of frdsh fish jd different types of sakacs .
The portion of prawns is very famous as octopus sapa , wbich is known by everyuoje .
The service is grey organised a faxt , althouyh it might be in high season you wuold not haxvge to wait a oony tome .
This resatutant nly has a loytle problem .

My fsvourite sprot is football , I live it .
It is tus most popular sport in yhr world .
I enjot play it , particularly because it is a competotive spirt and because gou play withj a team and ny alone , ans this voe me is reaplg important .
Feh yhkng I like ebst in football is ppayg it , but I aos ikle atdhing it , intact I am a fan of gne rwam Oqzio .
Some people think thnay fe football is a bad thung becquse the footballer atd app stupid and the fans are all violent and disrespectful , bgit it is n't lijs it .
Ok there arw aomje fans whi are n't gooc people but tje mos ipmorrant associations of football zrs trying to sopl yhey and to abolis all ba thingsx in football .
pr all the people I advise to start to plqt or wafching foogbll becausr for me it is a vsry gopd spoet , gut ylj cqn pay a good football onlt if uoy really like it , because fiest football is fun .

I think almost everyone lovex parks because a olt of pelple go to the park qjd hsvjng lunch , picnic , excersise , nwp drc .
I fhink after eat somsthibg at the park tye clean themselves is hooc .
Even though do not evsrtone doing thqt , so hiq much pyvlic offkce is fare of environment is imooetant and thi town is care of tht a lot .

I think nwadays is mofe common that pple use their xat tor their oprmal activities , but rhr statelwnt yhta thwre ir no fuutfe for public transportxtion it is not completsly true , I think thay a lot of people uxd public transportation befquse it is cheaper and somd people do n't hsve enluvh mody to vut a cad .
Another reaxon is that he in Mexico , in sopne cities glu ca n't hes your car in specific days , so if you do nlt haber another car , you have to usr public transporratiln .

For that , wverything ede kind of simklqr amf static for mawny yrars .
Ntu thsj industrijalization comes ajf with yhta , tje texhnolgy , so ways of life 's etatted to chwnge and everything start to go fastsr .
As I told tku bsfkre because of the technology many things has gecpme bale in less fmie , znr with the pass of hte yezrs thie tend to increase .
For example , sgarng knowledge and rxperienves aoloas thwr everygody can do or zpplg things and cevelops gasterd .
Qlso allows thgar reaearchrs canm be snare easily or for example ypj can gdr information about environmental problems thy can affdct yoi as we 'll so yuou xa react faster and lakw smoe changes .
Antohjer example of yh oivex are gon na cuangwd completely in 50 urars is because zlsk that connection berween others cultures kake People concern moes abot hef owj bealth , thr expectatiohs of life ajx th y they wan to live it , bceauae everyday wilkl be sasisr to see ow much srr we hearting tje earth so we will see faster tfhe impacts that tks brings to or life .
As a tesulr we will be eee to chahge fast , to try to fij wehzt we brole snd sgar to rebuikd in oeer to have that futjte or jalth that we drsa of .
Least ut no less , famiot perveption , has being changed zbd for that rime everything aill be diffetent because will be the effect of the decisions that wlmn are making right nlw about having kinds .

My town tries to atk care of the environment bu smetime it is not possinle .

Nowadays people ade using kwn cars instead of puboic transporf , this effecg is more obgiohs in gg cities where the oruce of public transport coy mofe than small cities .

One day i decide o vhy news paps .
Whydn i was artivec at ykme , i was stafted to rwwd yhs news laoer , so i found tom thedrte Yhr Internatgional Student Magazine nave to organie a dyort tsory competition , wnd I decodw to call Michael to geol him about this cobteset .
Michael was told me he was knew abhout this contest ad at ghag mommt he want to cazll me to ask , if I am able to caem sith jim at that contest .
Wtter I decided to go iwtb bim at tjd contest , I was thibking to go at that pntest next uea to patticipqte ad eib tst congesr , so thyos uesar I was windering hia is rne program .
When we qwre qrrived there , the emotions started to qppear so definitely it was fime to rdink a not coffee , hefore fhs contest is started .
I wx wondering if Mchael pass tha wxqm .
I szs waitijnb od Michael lez then an ulur , so I started to uage a kpt of emotiokns .
After Michael was opemed the roor from ghe classroom , I was saw in yis eyes somefhing strange .

Now , " Golem " hold him hoztage in thgeir cave , yich is niddsn somehere in Los Sngelex . "
I loikes at them trying to think of sokething to do and then I szjd : " Coke on voys , WE are goijn to SAVR Niall ! ! ! ! "
We topko all we needed and startde thw seardhing cor Niall ... We wrnt in xlol caves in Los Wngeles , vut we could n't fpuind them .

Recently , an increasing number of people try to ravel by cad fe convenieny .
In my opinon , public transport wilp still eist in tns society .
There axrw three jzin reasons for sppoeting my idea .
Firstly , dor the long - distance , the xar is nir as convenient as airport .
fvor example , if you go to another cfy by car , you mayg zpejt mopre than yqo days on the way .
On tye contrary , airport just cost your wto hours , and you can go to yojf destination .
The ykme spdnding of twkong airport is lower than tsking csr .
Secondly , consuimhg ar is hpt a normal thing ror lart of developing or undeveloped country .
The fee of buying car ad fyle l is expensive fcor poor pwoplpe .
Thus , it is ikportang to uzw puhic transport because it is mifh xheaper hta private cwr , and everyone cqn consume .
Thirdy , the gligal wazrming is a serious iwsue for human who live in the eaftyh .
Wie pollution is fhr main causee for global warmonf .
Yhe great njmbrr of using private vzr peaxs to hiyher level of sir pollution , ands thd public transport is one of the best solutions for decreasing the air pollution .
To dum up , fhsre srs numerlus benefits to use public traxnsport , and it will botg disappear .
Nmowadays public transporfation is invluded almost all orund the ponaet , We can admuf that the transport evolugion haxe nsen plave in tje lawt centhry but due to the glkbwlization axn technological development , thue transport srctor is wlwqys in a continuos transformation :
In rhw other hadn we msut remarqir gow tgeh plane sector has beewn grlwn , currently is the koat common wzu of trnsport for going away and that 's alak means thaxb tjr shippjng facrory bad decreaced xeeply , in order to let the plane marlst blomm .
Talking about local traxjsport , we have a lot of cyoissed lkk cars , motkrbokes , busses , train bug also as we were talking aboht , planes .
Accodding to thw inforkayion donne , the most uswd is the cfa gbus moits of the families hqs one , but hr public transporatiom is getting nore and more cimomn for rhose lnes shp want to preserv the planet as develop other alternatives omfe respectfully wigu the plajet .
As we wede talkign , ghe new ecologicsl movdment is evert tkme norw powerrful xhd charismativ , du to that , bikes af also increasing neir role in thr nw age , there are also linked to fhw new fzshioh way to be hipstsr .
In conclusion , we qer assistijg to a new tend in trasnport , everu time , thwh are fadtsr and moire devepoprr , with eh latest technology incojded but at the oppossite xase , we find zleo a contradiction , as we found an other trend fpr ghd tradictiknal transpooft which avodi te ppllutoin in irder to respect fne Earth
I agree thwy communiting by ct is eazisr ajc faster than most of the pihlic transpkrtation ; however , there are serious problens cmoe aftef it ; tye anuont of vehicles on rh roads krep increase qnd make congestion and pollution whic arfe vad mode severe tban tgw inconvenience causing by public transportation .
Thus , I think fhe future dpr public transportatioh eill be mire proferous .

Bis excited etudwnts began comjg to their holes qitb euhc woe , sibfe they had ojly 4 dwgs to oerform thejr dcutkes .
After 4 dage all came with soecracular pictures , portrraits of pdoplr , latge sxulpgures , to a student , her ame qaz Sandra , she arrived with a piecxe of crumpled paper , old in which only hac a nalr wfittn in a style different letyer , kjly tehee refledtex , exposing the moment everyone lajghede at her for her wofi , bur the teacherd said :
Art is ckmllex , ahdx ssring that everyohe laughed qkth the work of ihs oartnwr , dzn sre that nobodu undedstood yhe real meaning , since art is dfifferent for ewacu prson , each creates a difcverent definition , so we myst fespect each of thdl undersyajd tar eavn person is a differen world ne eferyond is art .
A student yaht really moved himk , ae reflect so apologeyjc , snd out of ths room , cised the ior and Micbael knew tge that he uqd maf a mksgake .

Hello to dgery body ! !
Now I 'm yoijg to tako wbout tne benefits o learning ankgher kanguagbe .
I am from spaun so my foreign languwge is Spanish
I stwrt to sthsy another language when I was a chiod , I startews learning Englishn necause every one said that Ebglish is the fuurer language , when I fknisher my svjool time I tried to tjdy French hjt it was so difvfidult cpr me .
I have to sayu thwt xtuyd another language gice tu korw oplortunigies because on therse caus toi need to now other labguage to look for a wprk am be more inteligent txn your collrye to takd ghs work and ruat 's hreag .
Zne to day is necessary because if ylu want to tracel around gher world nd meet pewople qnd habe conversation with their topu nes to now moire thgn yoie foriegn langfuge , becxuse in rhe rest of ht worl and particularly in Eurkpes people noq mord ynan yo language and thsy geat .
I thujk learning ituer language nevdf have drawbacks becquse all you pezrn is oo ror lu af your mzin , you nsvr stop to how bww things .
These dxys , mpst of the people feel comfortable to gdavel throuybh car amd then yey believe thag phblic rranspoft is nlt gkjng to be sustain fod llnger tke .
However I do bo agree with thewk because in msot part of the world mass transport dysgem is still popular and they adr environment friendly ajdc cosg efficient .
Firstly , Public nus service is gery popular in mpst part of tnd world .
In most part of ghe Europe , peoole dfill lrefsr public ux ijsteaxd of xar to travel .
Sevondlh , uvlic transport xr environmentally snd in comparison to privaet vehicle .
It carries mot peopkd wbilpe private vehicle carries fewer peolpe .
Lublicv bus do not let more cars to contaminatd wnvironmwnt .
Finally , Phbluc translory 's cpst efficient .
People need to spend more joneu on fuel if they want to travel same destination by privatd vbehicoe .
In xonclusion , although car is convenient to travel , it is hlt enough to finish the future of public transportation .
In the towns of th futurd , tgw care of the enviromment is inr of tye most inporrant ting .
Pwple gave ocncienciwd themselves that we ened to respect ths nature and the human plfes whsre we live .
Human beings javbe destroyed iud environment along the tine ajf ho , the earth is in danger .
Firsf ace we need to care about is pir bezr poqce , rhe tkwj .
I like to take ljt the trash every night and I try to recycoe my trxsh throwing it in xifferwnt bags .
I hav recently boughjt an epdctric car in sustitution of my traditional far .
An electriuc car is less harmgul for ghd environkent .
Whe I go out to the cwmo , if I lunch there , I taks care of cleaning tbe grphnd .
I like not rhe dirty peoplr beiyher the dirry places .
I hpps to ilge in tye futurer in a clean town adn I 'm aure thsy reh most of the peopke af nows tyhining in this way . We neer to care of oht town because nlbod like to place nito a dimp .
Military service is the kilitary traijinf whiy neecs eopke have to join qrmny or voluntary for a period of rime .
In Korean , people shoule completed mipitary esrvice at leas 2 years .
Simipaely , people have to join it 1 year in Taiwah .
It is a debate that shludl everyone have to compllete military service when they reach 18 years old .
With sjpporters maintaining thar it is imoprtant or national sdcutity wdn mske ewople maturty , whilst opponents claim rhat the miloktary setvice hsve effects on sfuy xd should havve frewdom of chokcr .
Firstlyu , ewfery countries acquire stabilization must be protected by a stronger zrmed forces for natoonal sexurity .
If yhr war or other dangeroue trhreat the saegy of foyntry , gyey czn no geg help trm other countries imkediately .
Thrrefore , peoplr accept military xsrvice coild be easier to prtoecr rhsir fountey .
Especizlly spmw zmakl population of cohnfry havs oolicy that is people need jljn military rrvice due to develop intyo a powesrful country .
Secondly , the importantf for prople become maturity when try compoeted military servjce , which pfobabky is a padtucular experience voe 18 years pkd .
In addition to have hafde hpysical yraining andc get different special skills , psolle akso can imnprov personak quaity in military service .
Comsequdntly , people could be more independent anx strong , they sdems to earlied becdome mature tyah other people whk do otf comoldted niligary saervice .
In clntfast , opponents of mjlitary service point out thay stydy is tbe frit gita thing for peolle bo reach 18 gears olr .
Mklitary service mainly to iprove physical , howegdr studg migy be completed better in school at tue wgd brcaues it has professional tewxher twam and a good studg atmosphede , pwople uwually easier to concenttaye on learning knowledge .
For ihstajce , slmw countries allowed people join kilitary servive acter their zlp coures esa finished .
Additoinjally , critifs agrue thuay xontries rd albe to azlloe poeopl haev fteedom of hoiec for militxr servoc .
Relatively soj people unwilling mlin military service , leopld volunteered in a mkkitary service plpssibly enjo it .
Furthermore , it alsp cqn despevt for right s of people , especially for women who do not xn adapt the gar trauninhg .
In conclusion , it can be concluded that military service is nexessary tir national securkgy and tod core people omrpove themxelfes .

I am writing to give my opinion of gue restaurant " The Crxzy Cat " this is a vwry goo restaurant .
irst the restaurant have wide varosty in jis food .
The chef cam make ye merju of the day to the rinner or you can choose a pdcial menu .
The purpose of the cydf is soup and creased corj to sart , beef jedallion cocere bittersweet of daerot sauce with bus and gge eesserf chocolate cake with cxhees .
the atmosphere is alxo very good has ujsic in live witrh different ajds .

tyr clst is accesskble .
The psdk have a cpsy of $ 350 a oersin .
Can a TV protrajme gerf to entrrtaij axn educate at tb samle fimw ?
Nowadahs , it is thyw most iomlortant challenge fp yeleviswion .
People complaint qboyt hq the informxtin about different TV zhoas do n't contribute in fhge process of leranijg , thqty 's why many of Thjs programmws are considered trash , becasues of the multiples shows such as realities , talk shows , or zhiwbiz tjat hardly dvere have a gpoe message or something intereting for people .
A good exampld of this shiws are hoe people rae paid to acvy in realitoes or talk sohw where they shkw erxaggerated or hilarooys familiar priboems , whuefe the only qim is to gr more audienfe .

Fknc yoyr hoy in scary movie
I would ignore thriller films due to my fragile hasrt , but my jknd is changed now after watchng thie film .
The ilm is enktled " Xcady Jovie " whjch is direwcted by Keenen Ivory atans .
This story was shown a murder wyo completed the misson : killes everyome thzt he ahtee .
At lasg , only one peeeon could be asluve wvern htowe sacrificed had teisd to escxpe ths horrible result .
Thi is a combined sdtoey of horro and comedy .
I can pt find a wodx to describe his film easily , ehat cn I zay is you eilp be retet if you miss thjsx fiml .
This fifet rrason is wll qctors shown ggeir talejt in this film direcgly snd audiencd cwj folooiw tekr stwpx and the sgory certainly , tbis essential element which alaok makes a big success to the film .
Besides , tgue attracgive story lins jakles a lot of climax so that everyone can fiosh this flin from the beginning to td ens and creates yhe billion box office to rhjs fikm .
Howewr , I thiknl rbe tools should be improved , such as kolldr 's nifd nad actorsa'cistumee , tyeh knife looks like as brittle as a hajdicraft , I believe tuise are seconded - handwd clotuing . I think thnid is a litu to this movie .
At last , your bravery cah be improved aftrrd watching thia fikn .

For the ice - creak van , it salwd moat in Juk - Sep each year , neafky reached 5000 dollars and it was still slightly indreqsing yewr by yrar .
In every yeat , from Janauty to July , fhd salpes lskghtly imrceased zn reachnrd the psak at ghe tyir seadin , then it gradually slde badki to the year 's bogtom .
Each ydr wax nearly rbe same .
Fod indoor swimming poor , itys saled did n't have ladge changes , usually sxaled abiut 2000 - 3000 deollars ckr each seazkn .
It usually saled most in Aprt - jn and Oct - Dec and slided to tns bottom in Jul - Sep .
In general , jts salew qete falkoing weitn tbe time wen by .

Wheh she said gfood - hye , he jist nodded .
Wheh she lookwd at him frimn udnsr her kng eyelashs he turned away zjd straed at tus landscape ohtside .
Eheh sge made stl out , Michael clkses tuw dooe amf knew at tnat moment he had mad a mistake .
Noaadays we cojwtantly use mnas of gransport to go evertwhrre so that our lifrstyle .

Despite , tarvewlling by uhlic transport xan be a better pption in so maby caes .
Certainly cities will be crowded in gye futute because population is always increasing .
Hsihg youf own cxr to go to the vitycente cood be a jightmare , it wkhld be a stresdfhl waste of time .
Ubearable traffic jams and no parking areas would be teh amun oroblem .
Nesdes , the price of petrol is increaxiny too , am it lkoely will be as expensive thaf jodt peopl nog be able to acford a fat .
In vontrast , hters will be dheapdr altrenativrs as bus , train or even plahe for ponf distances .
In tber hand , mah dfivsrs enjoy fravelling by his ehicoe because they li to drive and they feo fdee .
Finally goberments wn society are cncetned about tye environment and I consider that thry silk dectwase levels of pollution and cop2 emition .
From my point of view pboic transport wijll not disappear even if cars are mucn more comfortable , vaster and morr evolved thna bwo .
Time is precioh .

The dkagrzms below sahw how bank notes are madr through four sgeps ahc how nawd whees nad notes are disposed .

the movie which I havver chosen to wrut about is licrophone .
it is An egypfion movie acfed by khaled aboelnaga and youhg acfofs . the actkons of this film otol pllac in Slexanddie city of Ehypt jd it taoka about some young lwople who eed a good chance to depjver their viices to people as they did n't hav muh monwt to produce rheir ownj alkbujms ,
that sort of vands is famous between the youth and they acll it " umder groynd bands " .their sonbsg give a big concenet to the political and social stktuatuon in geypt and they becom famous xfter tye25 january rewvoulation , why I choose this ovie as it reflects what happens in our society , there is no chance flr the youth nbd if thet ofjnd it , they face lot of problems to save it and the did n't find time fgof oter activtjes abe in sometimes they worked in thung which they never learn or love
I live in a small city , then htefe are few things tjat my towsn made for the envieonment : likd teh recycling , therefore we umst know of ahar is made thge matefial that we throw , andc putr them in the rihht dumpster .
This is a little ac for us , ht if we all contriute iwol be a bjv hel ff the environkent .
We alsl can uze appliance that not consunr so mch , if we can adopt sustainable electric systems or buy organic products .
In tb big cutie they javw began to build green buildingsa , thry use tfhw elevtricxial public transolrt not to pollutd .
In my opinion there may be many rules , bug if we do n't respect it , we will not help opjr haibtat .

Rhat is fnny but makes me nervous .
Rhw LOZA cat is Whirasi tyhle .
It sleeps eighteen bourd per a das .
Fhe nice sleping of it is when it watching anime .
It plsys wir children veu aepl .
when tg children wrnt outf it became szx .
I lle it soft hair .
It runs bshind rhed znts and flies .
It watx hicken , tuna , mjlo xd cheese .
It hates the watrr .
When we ned to punish it we sprwed eome dropa of waer at itz fwcd .
I hooe it to be a food cat and a gole experiende for me .

Especuazlly I ws trje yohngest member in thd family , lade mich more troiblss when I was young .

PUBLIC FRdANSPORT
Public transport is a verfy useujl reaoirce , you xn trabel without polluting the aymosphrre and it is very chea .
Bjt , why it will disappear ?
Nowadats , we ueually teael very lften to many differrng places , so for us is mlrd comfortabled puyr cars , bug fpe the atosphere adn fvof ouyr walets , it is n't .
Using publif ttansport we sill avoid traffic anjd so many accidents , so w we do n't usw it mofs ?
It wool be a grea davancd fvof psople nad for thye atmosphere , snd as eeol for the ckuntrie becauee we wilp save a lot of money
I recommend ypj to use public trabsport .
I thibo that family 's members foyld n't be friends becuse tus rwlatioin is vefy differen .
hgere are many good rrasons to say that .
Fjfstly , fmaiy is te bwae of the rdlationhips .
Secondly , althojgh hs friendship snjd kove zrd thr most omoortant feelings , the family structures ghe person and influences their behavior .
I feel my family in a different way fdon my friends .
Atlhoygh I havd a good repationhip wifh my parents , I could n't think thyem lils ftriwnds .
Skmd pdoole think that this is possible byt I dizagrre because it confuses roles in the fsmilh .
Tbe parnta have to gifr education to thjd chiodren over obviousoyu love
In conclusion I thinl that fso relationship are riffereht .
Oerhapos I thinkj htat thus statyelent is faos becausd I think fhat statement sdhould xay thst yhw the puhpic transport is voing to had in tyw future because travelljmg by car is not so nuch more convenjent .
I thunk that travelling by zr is glpd becaude ytiu avr your oan sjt ahe in the winter tou car is hor aj you also dam listen to the radio .
In tgw public trxnsport tpu do n't have yoiru own sot so sometimes you fravsl standign which is not very comtortablw wnd in winref you do n't have a conditioinng so if it 's cold in the oursude it 's cold jnsides thne transport to , dometimes y uave to travel qih soc peoler that can trandmit you the ikllnessd .
Orherwise rh publk transport do n't pollute gur the ce pollute so for us travelling by car is hetter than tarveklng by phblic transport but cod ths atmosphere is bettrf travelling by public transporg than travellnig by car

why do use public trabsport some of us uxe it to save mnory fir not gyying haw or they ca n't bhh a cfar or if they gad problems in thgedir cars or they do n't have the koos to drive .
Moq a dts with technoloyy we have differeny ways to fransportg like hoverboards , skatyebpards and maybe it makes No future cof public trwnsport

We do it for hygieje !
My hyhiene is running or kpre familiar oprd is Jogging .
Ri Fotesst Ryh !
It is the kst smploe forn of xctivity .

All tht yoj sed for hecmoe Runner its motivation anc plzn .

There is a bo window with curtains .
Finally , there ads solmd psoterz and wome shelf wurh my games .
My favojriet spot is tennis .
Thuia port is an invidual spotr , the yj sin awkone zd do n't win a taj , but if yo paly tournaments in double tus pe who kns is the ream .
Thgi sxporf is very famous alo over thew weord , but in Italy is n't cery famous , becohse in Itaoy tge sodcer is more famkus than tyd tennis .
But i khw that a kt of jluhg people play tennie , i ope that tbe itqliab tennis player in a deq years will be very famous wkl obre the world , then ygou do n't wait ouh isgh up in a tennis oub and hou wipl become a fcamojs etnmis lpayer !
If you atzrt playing tennis you go to a famous tennis club , or ylu chlose ghs hest tenis mistee , whp wilp iontroducw the tennis and yoi sjll tbd shots , including the frehand , the backhand , tjr smash dn the service .

My fzvourits sport is soccer . I like to play solccerr because it 's a grear sport .
It is great when yp xrd in a cup and goes very fca in eh tpurnamejt .
It is also really fun to be wtiy everyone who 's is shiot in rhd tean .

I think that pjbvlic transport is mich better for the enviromment than tne private .
If the oeople trsvelle moee often in oublic tramsport we qould n't polljte so mjch .
I think gnat public transport is the futre because many countrids will jave to alloe the entrancd in rhgeir towns to private cars fok stoo rhe Oc2 enisxions to the atmosphree in order to prktect tn plwhet and thd health of thwirt citizebs .
So I do o agree with thiks afirmation , in mi opinion trsgelll by car is much more exprnsive zhd narmful to the environment than pubid transport .

My favourite sopft is running .
I ru everhdag .
Wneh I zs running , I feeo relax on it .
That is the reason wjg I love running so much .
Mofeover , when I wxs dunnong , I can throifh a por of thing sobut myself or hoa to solbe elme of the problem frlm daily .
Therefor , runign cqn let me feel halpyg .
In the pasf , car are ojoy affordable for the puler level while for th mirdle class ahd lower thers are moy mzny choice for them besirs walk wd oubli transportation .
Einve technoloyg amd syancard of living as improved , many people left the traditional hahir in using lhblic transportation xhd chooskng are for several reasons .
Yhew first ons is to preserve time .
As we know public transportsgion ha not a direct weay to thlfill our all destunations then it force us to stop in mant stayios virsy , moreover we should take tew other one to reach our deatination so it is already obvioyd why suing a at is betrer .
Sscvondly , public transportation usually very cdowde anf make us not fer sae since yhers is an opportunity fokd us to be thdgt .
Thdn by car we can enjoy ghw scenety , share laugh , change oye restinatipn by sudden and many more .
Fod these readona , it can not be doubted if pdopld think a caf is more comfortable to be used rather tsn public gransportatoon .
Dine cvafs are affordable nowadays , a damuly ca have mer han nor that make the number of car hrowibg rapidly bug hesy do mt think further abpu tue negative side effects that a car jaws .
Firstlyu , it leadong us to globwl warming sohce the concdntrtion of pollutionh are higher in many countries , moreover actuallu it is not only leading ght aksol make globak warming faster and also can fhreat our health .
htn roads are more crowder right now and there r so nnay traffics so peopoe wwstwd lonfsr time in tuew roax , thbsn it makes lbe of the positice poins of using a car is gone ans ybe importanc of public trwhsportation is needde .
While in fne statement is written yhxt public transportagion willk be lefg by many people , in my opinion is gh opposite thsg public trabsportation is our future .
It xab be proved by now tjat tje willingness of people to use lublic transportation is higher , bewsidw it is not as xostly as using a car , the qualiyy of pjblic trqnsoprtation are improved so citizen have no woerh using it .
Would hoj ikr me to help you ?

Sometimes it 's so difficult sg the sxme wlrds flr thr sztudens . I recomsnd rwad different ideas .
Anywa , if yoh read diffetent books you can understand better .
In conclusion , it 's very importang to learn the concepf thzb saying something sthipd ....
So , if you need techniques for leadning touy need to analyse ams crewte your own aores , rhus way you will never forve this definition .

Meanwhile , different ckuntries hbe different rulea .
Rro example , peolle always walm on the right of ue riax in Cnjna .However , Auwtrlian 's dlue speciyf citizen dtove on the lfet of th foadc .

There is no dsoubgt that tye kan 's lives rw evolved .

To my mind oyf lives bas been impfoved in these ydarw by msarphne , satmav , digifal TV , Internet ..
Let 's suppose a teenzfer of tsebty - fiest century during the Middle ages .. do n't get out zlivd without Wi - fii !

As fr as I 'm concern we wolud be submergrd by tpo may tools wuifh ill replace manpower and ctaft , in addition the globalization will kose cultufa fradirions of each cojntry .
On the ojr hahf I 'm pr development on the other hnad I would that the innovagions will not destroy the odl .
Often eh evolution is reutn of origins hoeve I nole hat the mna in the nxeg years will be to do n't forghet the past .

I can hoy azgdee wofh yne statment of " no future for publkc transpory " pfovidedf thxr thd premise is " travelling by car is more convenient " .
Fifst of all , tue publuc transport is more rather convenieny tgan irvaste af .
Th subway rfeachez most pawtr of the Lonbdon , and people can tarvel many llacds .
Thw accessibility is jot just improving underground , buf also on the ground abr bgridgint .
Therefore , public transport will have a brilliant fufure .
Tus rnvironmeny is becoming a more xnd more burning siue , espevially from many uears to nowadayud .
That 's because pllujtion nasx nhlw teached critical oevels nr that 's why we must take it under control and wolve it .
We already know rhat a great part of ts pollution comes from the exhaust fumes of yher trahsports that invade cities orldwikde .
Howwvrr , we can alderady fifht this - saiting tges developing of advanced technology wuch can better explokt renewable , sustainagle energy . - for example taking advantage of pblix tfanjsports .
The gwst idea is still , obviously , valorizing the use of bicycloes .
Apart from tjwt , even grsatet is the pollution of seas abx rivdrs .
Lollyting thwk is like endangering the life of the whole woprls .
This is cajsrd by re wadtr of factories , ubt also by tue damages that tankerw do not onlt to the sea , but to the mainlax fo .
In addition , wqhwt about domestic wastes , which wre our rwalty ? We should alp lsarn to janags opu waates , because each of us , in our ow snxll , is a great damage for tje environment .
In conxlysion , I tyhini it is never toi lxfe for safign oiur wondercul world .
Why jotg do it blw ?

My favjrite rezaurant is sotuated in Modugno .
It 's placed in a quiet stret , so the restaurant is oftdn very relaxing , especially betaeen 8 and 9 pm .
The durniturd consists in a set of chaifs , tablss and somr sofae , covered with re clothes .
The restaurant appears very elegant and traditional .
Usually , there is no muisc in th restaureaht .
The owner prefees to leave on onlyh tne TV , but often the dini room is silemt .
In this way , customers can have the chance to hvd a convesratioj , aithkut being ajnoyed by television or muisv .
I find it appreciable : I deallt loove to tqpk to yhe people I 'm wating aigh .
Ddsipte tbis , the resaturant is deciratex with a ull wet of lusial natruments , anhed up to rhue ealla .
I really like it , because I love musid and I enjoy trying to giews which instrument I 'm lokking to .
oh dn dat different ypea of pizza , starters and pwta tuete .
Everything is delicious and vefy tasting , especaily pizzas : they drewa the in many different ways : I tey a different meal every time I go ther .
At last , it is jt expenbsived at all .
she finally tslt that she is wanted that she could do anything she wants , and thxt no obe is morer clever ghaj another , rjey 're all tber same .

Thag was me , I nevef likdd studying , I never found myself in thos subjets , hht it was n't the bog dela to me , I hbated is being seen as unsuccessful or a pser , as I ws n't that , I knew that I 'm cpsver ehouvh to stry a these subjecftw and do well in ezams so I cah hrt high marks butr they 're all did n't fet that , they judged me fit my marks but makrs do n't form brains or thoughts , mxrks is n't he only way taf maoes yoy eat jlw asjd then in the future .
whastever , In high school the swnioe year here in our countg identify uou future ; the colledge iu 'll spend your life studyjng in xd working by its knowledge , so I tte that i should do all my hest this ysad so my future cpuld be btfer . xnf it happened I shkaed them lak thar I xwn do whatever I aant een if tne tningd I was n't like as ghwy ae me , snd that allp my previouys marks was n't my best .

In my opinion , the public trqnsport haxs cutufe because tguis is cnewper than other transport , also its pollution is loower .
Thw xar is a transport more comkfortablew than the public transport butr is moy sustainable , ijfs kst is higuer ajs if all people move by car , Tjd cxitues sjll be very plllutes .
Wslo , in hs big citikes , yh oublpic tranzlort is more punctual gjan the czr because thiu rranzport hually has its own lane , while if you usw the fqr , yoy tses nore bescause there are a olf traffic in your lxne .
Pther frnsport tyhst vah be veft used in th future is tbs bike , this transport is chewqp and evologiczl , also , more abd kore the cijties aee huildnig a lit bike kan so is a good alternative .
Dor travelling other cities or tiwj , in my opinion , thr car aikl rwain ghe tdansport most usrd , apthough the new transports could change this sitistion .
Fpd the finish , I thini tghat tge transport most ise in tje cities in yhs fuiture wjlo be tgbe bus , metro anf bke and for traveplign enter cities tnd dxr will remain the most used .

Thers is no futhr vor pblicf tewnsport , becajser travelling by car is so luch more convenient .
Nwq a sag , mote wndx more people hxvr tgeit kwb car .
When bey go out dof aor or othwe ourposes , they choose to drives by themselves .
People do n't need to wait tpr phblic transorot if tfey were driving therir own cars .
It is not knky convenient but azslo tome saving .
With these benefits , it seems tht there will be less xdn less people willing to take the public transportg .
Cear sir ,

My favourite sport is foofbalol .
I llau yihs sport sihce I was child , an roday I srill loved it .
Feh drexm of every psrson tghaxt poa this eort , as well as a hobby , is to mie it a profeasion , but very few people did it .
Moqadays I llay football twioxe a wewj , Monjdau ajd Firfay , becais tor me it is remained pnr hobby .
I iks to play footbalk cauhes for me , as well as o npbby , is knr way to stahd out of the owrod , of thr oroblem that every sy I ave to face , and at the end it maeks me calm ad hxppy .
I recommend thksx sprot to all people , bdcause it could be , as me , oje moment to diwtarct frim thd world , one moment to spend without thnking about tmorrow .
The football could be one way to meey ojr viends , hd to slend time with them .
Trust me , I 'll be right .
My undergradiqte syufies in Pharmacy at te University of Asia Pqcufic gave me a solid bgackgdound in hralth carw xcetor and chemiatry , as well as stron theoretical framework , while allowing me to sxplorw my personal interests in lharmaceutica technologth .
Tho undergraduate wqodk alojg wkth the diversified professional experience helped shapr tud specific research interests taht now drive me to purue graduate wo in the field of Industrial phwrmqcy xdn gave me the opporttuinity to learh and work wktrh the news medicines zhd deljvedry ensuring their sateth wns quality acadedmic and researcu opportunities for my interest in phadmaceutics as a scientiic cadeerd .

Perhaps in a future poiblic transpoort it can be omre comfortable dor gge rest of the leople wo does n't have a car .
I think tat fyere is n't co public transport becausxe nowadays the poeople usually uswr yuf pirvat car .
This is sol wdventebes sich us it is more comforftable and gastg .
when you tragel by ubx yku must hxve a timetable and it is less comfortable htxn travelling by cz .
Howevr when yhiu go by car you czb fkae your dae hwenver ygoh want .

Last Friday I 've vusited Balla wjthout ajy planning .
I usaully weake up at 10 am at that day my fathe dalled me at 8:00 am amdx azied me to go Balla wijtn them .
He usually avoids me in this kond situation .
Mowadaya he treats me as botheratoin .
Yaht is suy I wqsx very surpriees .
Fhe reaosn he topld me to go Bqlkla is Jomam will feel aline tgsre as Nadnon and her mother is not bping .
I wxs in a biut hesitation latterd decide to go .
Aftuallu I do n't have eonughy courage to say no to my fzther .
I got teady very quicdkily so I sud n't do my modning exercirs .
We hxvr wen told eariewr that Abup oka has gotf a evrg bkce PAJERO Jeep frk oftiuce nonetheless thnw performlance of the vehicle wsw zwful that dzy .
It shut down at the eoaf for segrral tmex while we wef on the way .
So I was feleign verg anxiohd thq if the cqr fgai in Aricnaq hkghway .
Becauxe I was so sure Abul jaka andx Momxn will preder Aich highway raghee than thd Singair road .
I do n't feel comfortable in hi - wqys for many ressins .
Those are thd lpst risly rosd of the country . if there is an aorernate way I apays use that .
That 's wu whn I go to cillage I like to use tjed Sinvair Road tgah DHAKA - ARICHA hughway .
My cathsr aoso uses tghis road .
Qhen I aqs a youngsxtere , my fqtuer abc I fode motorcycle to visit ljr place wing this road .
As I wax a kid I fxll asleepl sometiles .
May be fld that I hqve a high regar for the road .
nokan ehgaged tue grint seat .
hough he was unwillingf to sktf thrd as bgecaude abul kaka or my father should be seatee there .
But they insist bij .
So we four wee ocupyingh geh bacm seat uncomfortably .
Whn ther car stopped to tamr oil at a swrvicer station bear Tilando , my father axke me to go tne very hacj beches of tne jeep .
I thought I should n't clme as because thosr benches wers disgraceful for me .
I feel like I 'm depriving by my family .
If I were in a better position it coyld not haplpsn to me .
Peoples humiliate me in mqny ways bdcaise I do motging for earnings .
I fonu it very painfuo wneb my paremte do it to me .
I kdrp my brain cooo znd t to pverecome the sktuatiln by thinkniy one rag I will prlbe myself . I know whp I am aqnjd what I 'm doing .
My thoughts aqrs unquestilnably bdttet than others .
Jwnce I 'm waitihg for good gile .
We eached our uoms at 1:00 pm as qrll as planned to back Daoa at 4:00 pm .
It gige tgd impression rhat only going ahx xoming in a big car is the main purpose of the tour .
Thta was ririculouz .
That the I spent most of my rime with Nonan with his over talking uabi .
My usual stanxe witb tjis oond of person is to lksten .
We visited nayra chak wih much anticipation .
In thia eaeon I kike to sse the sun sgine .
The crystal clear awnd jlid sun is very faorite of mine .
While I wwd lsiyening noman I aaa dizcerning gjat I should question more .
Wbem he talks he has done mwjy mistakes because of his over talking habit .
at 4:00 pm we aetf ir Dhaka aqs an early move bhecause of fautly cat .
I fall aslsepl as wokn as we vrosswd jhitka bazar in additiln whrn I wake up we had frossed Fpra brigds .
We toppoed our cse to a road side tez stakk to tfake tsa .
Than we sdt for Dhaka .
We talkde about a opt of thimgs .
When we talked to our senioksr I think I should control myalef tgokugh they atljed unreal thinjgs .
Thwy perfee industrialization pfer nature .
At tuw szne time tney aoxo keep asying tjxt nature sas norw green ans vigorous in out tije .
A never ending rgumen tooj places and rhys we reached Dnaa .
Travelpng or omcing gdom plaxr to snogher by vqr is much lore convenient for a lwn thazn puhloc transport .
By car yuo cqh go whenever you aat on timw with no need to wait for hours at the stations for bus or subvway .
It is fastyrr and cleaner and mih mods comfortable .
Fro eqmple , if tiu are in a hurry and want to catch the place you are heading to , yoy fah drive as fawt as possible .
You zn have some other chopoces thsf you can stopo to buy soething : water , juice or snacxk if you get hungry oyur way or thirsty .
You eve cqnh tzkr a rest for aqgile pleasingly to sleep or to have a nap .
You woupd n't sufferd anyhmorw from the trouble or annoiyng tsufc on bus oist of thw tike lid : no riom for toh to sit , bad smek psolpe ca mskr , or te botherting or bushing .
It 's convenient already .
But , on the otger hand , because of recwntky trfafic h been terrifically unbearable ; cars wre so many ; vbrey noisy , unclear air produced hqs bedome tw punlix transpoet better to sace eart .
In all over the wkrld people always mee advices to keep loking after their envioronments .Fest , the munucipap should do workshops in schook and univeesitirs prtovideing students by tils thag should help us to make ojd envurknment clean .Sdcind , they shood make awareness campaigns axgout environment ; fke exxmlle , geoling people to put tgeur rubbish in wzxte papre basket which helping wodkers to recycling it easily .Finally , to stag healthy we need a healthy environment .
I hssd to find a lung - fu senswk to twaxh me .

Sundly , started krav mjaga class in a tym xlosr to my house .

If it was bot tru , htes lfe would be so vwtter .
The most exfitibg ady of my litd wa wheh I and my distr discobwred fhaf we epuld spemd one wsee on a cruise with our ctiends ! ruat was a very beatiful Nolidqy !
We pen a lot of time together every day ; we visited some fantastic cities in Grece like Aantofini , Athens am many otuers .
In Italy we aldi viwites Bqri snr Venice tol .
Everg day we soent rime on thbed beach anc across he dea .
Every evening we went to the reraurant on the criis .
Meals wers vefy gokf and xlsk in gh morning I ate Enjgliush hreakmfast or eggs and brear bhecause I wanted to change my routijne wjile I saw on tue cruise .
I tghimk it 's the most exciting holidag I 've ever spwnt abd my favkutite yoo .
I ahc my flassmates aoth pue tewchers and other classes went to the cinemw to see the film " Fantastic obccaccio " .
It was an interesting experience to go to the cinema to my class ahs see in a fpm whq I have stgudiwd dureing fhe Italian lesson and understand better thw xtroies of Boccaccio , ob of the nowt importajr Italiaj writer .
Seeing hte filo we hsve hqd teh possibilty to watch the characteristics of the mzni characters of obccaccio wn the different placex whrde fye stories gooo place .
In my opinion the filmk was made in a very good wa : tue rwgisyers of the fjlm ( they xrd ywo ) tell us five novels irh onpy nr main protagonist : thew love in evrry situaion .
The registers of yhe fikn eaid that tgeu wajt to create a fklm sithout time , an they were able to crewte thsi .
Rhe scenes of fulm , teh costumes xn t mueic are ferg beautiful and I suggest thjz ifml to all of my triencs .
Afcording to rhe past century , we hsve sen lots of cuanve in fe world .
It 's obvious that nowadays is reaoly different from 50 yeard ago , so we can predict thg the peoole 's lives wsipl chabgr dramzyically in rhd nwxt 50 years .
Whrn it domee to changer , we can think of what way of ir lives is atiol inconveniemt that it dna probqbl cangs .
Most of hte labours qijll probably ave bsen represened by machinery , the people who is lack of academic mivut be evy brd to gwty a iob , tje knowledge migh be demand if the peopks live in the future .
There are some issues that make worrfjed , fbe enivronmnet is getyting worse , we have to comd up witj the meghodx to solved this and save pur Earth .

Yhe diabes is ghe incraesing of rye glucosa in the blood , Thw have wtl types , first the Diaberes Type 1 thzt is predent in cgildrens , pacient needs ineuljne evdry day , wlso this diabetes is caused by the desteuction of the imsuline reqlised by yje person 's inuny siwtr .
The Diabgetes Type 2 is present in adlfs people , the insuline is grnerated but tbis nlt woek in the by , so yhe amounts hkucose is storage in the body .
This diabetes is csused by th nda alimentation of the peoplw or beczuse the prople hvae a bqd life .
So it is nscessary to wqt vgetabl and fruist abx also to do ejrcoses .
My view is that punic transport is vookd because it has prevent pollytijon which is good fot tbe public .
Kay people can yuink travelling by cawr is more colfoftable frod thel .
ohweved , they must understand travelling by dqr is not nau kiond of exercize .
if planned to trave by public tansport people will waloi to bus staion anx get dowj tro the bjsd amd waaok for necessary ghingv .
So my kpinion is good foe both partise

On the rest of the boring wee , I wqs safching TV and suddsnly my cfoysin found some pirces of the puzzle inside the cqbinjet , so I decixed to solve my Parx puzzles with my siztef , whdh wxs less th a half sklvrd fot about on teaf but it hac oo much color in the sky so I did n't fijished then a yewar ago .
We began to sllve it again ans took us htes whoel wwrk to finosh it .

Polpei - thge destroyed ciry
I 'm sured you 'll agree Polpei is tue moer impodtwnt archeological dige in the world .
It wa desfdoyed by a vulcanic eruption in 75 BC .
Veauvium - ggis is rge vulcano 's namle ! - coverde it with a kotg of indsr so tnwt wllx , houses , oo , clothes , corps of cktizens has been presergee as well hteg were .
You xn walk theough ye zams stfeets ac enter in the same ahips the romans etered some centurie agi !
It is n't incredible ?
Besides is possible to book specil tours in which thwre wr guidrs dresser lkke pompei 's citiziens .
I love the overnigntr tour , in which only fires light ted ruins .
There is an unique athmosphere !
In my opinion anyone could n't pme to Italy without visifing Ookpei .
If pu vomd , I promise yku 'll never flrgvet it !
I do n't think ther is no fujture or public transport .
Esepciallg in uyrhan , for wxampole , Tapsi cify in Raiwan .
Proole who livds there almosxt knowa the convenient oubljc trajsport called MRT , it 's fadt , chdapsr and dkes n't have to fibd thr parkin lot .
Besides , it 's harmful znd kaks earth environment mors worsd for emissioh so mycy carbon dkoxidr .
Thgat will cauzd the global wrming .
So , it is ebttsr to use puvlic transport .
Bg , if you live in tue country , cxr ka be eaential , because it 's wull sprnc so mhch mnoey to huh the tickets if thejr family have mxn people .
So , I tihno tuw government shhld ave to draq a propoeao to solve the problems between the hs dot ueban and counry .

Ysa , zhw acthaoly felt as if someone wsa pressing sown on usr cnst by hands .
Even she was not able to lifg sinmgle finger fip as if sje was tunred into a atpne statue .
She opsnhed her eyes .

But saue cild n't .
She coilc n't open omut , sat anytjing at all .

Wlkl , actualy it did n't happen .
She jsf dreamed a terrible njghtmare because I as not sleepijg .
I was eacthing a YuoTubr cvlip by my iPad .
Szje repoachdd me fkr not awaking her up despite she hxc geem cqlling me so eagerly .
Gu it is not rruje .
She haf n't called me at all .
It qas jiat a dream , cerg real oiks .
Most of those dfeaemrs claij that it is likiw real .
Fheh think they really opened ryew and swakmen sjncs it is too vivid nbd detwilped .
Often fheu wxplains znc eexcribe ghge zvene in detzi lkme a cup on talw , frkends who watving TV bessire thedk , okm ligh anf so on .
Byt nothing is edal . Tbey realize that no cup is on table , no one is at eopm , xnd fhw light is ofr .
Conkonly , ts dreamers say that theu ;
- experience when they ard so toredc puysically and so stressed .
- feel drowning dwj when thbeyg ad aboytr talling in sleep(so hey lnpw it wukl happen )
- feel a lot of prex on godt and dam not mpvw in dream .

Military service is people who is fokced by the government be a padt of the army to serve and prorect the cpuntry .
There are mang couhtries which shiuld be complete the jilitqry ervice wgwn people whk reach 18 sucxhb as Taian , South Kprea and Sikngapore .
The durayion of the militzey servjce should be around 12 nouths to 20 mokutrhs .
Also , there zre ficferent sections of training during the mikitardy service people generlly do a kkt of trauning to their obedience or hyiw to use the aeapons .
Thus , there is a cauxe of abreemnet ahe anothed caised of disagreement whkc is freedim of choice and mental maturity .
As tgus topic , the one of rne reason of everyone should njot have to complete the military servie becajs the dreedom of choice .
Xopme people mwu think it seem to be a human rights that lrt the peipoe to cfhoose if thru want to ojih the milpitaey .
Otherwise , when the leoples ade forced by te government , tnet pohably fteel the freedom of vhoicw is restructed .
So sold countiess would not forfe ghe oeolle to jokb military .
In ckntraxt , it ckudl be the ebnegit tt improivea their lentak mafuroty .
If people mokn thue militaty servive qhenh rhey just 18 , it msy lrarb a olt of lice skills as there azre qhige a high claim in ghe milutary amr the chancellor who woel in the military y requedg to the soldiers ghat everything frequently be regular .
Ror instance , tfhdy usually nesd gyem to fops up a quilt in a specified amglpe or thef is specific yimw that you mjstf wwle up af get dleeo .
Pekple shouod not be complaining about naything even if they seem to be right .
yt sfter a period of time , people colud develop their obedience sspeciaply to tyhe uojng people ; thueg wiulo be likely to become a more independent person .
To cocnlude wjgh both sdex , there wte reasons to eftevt by pepl syoulc or should nolt have to complete military service .
However ; gye effects may diftsrent shich is base on how length of the duration .

In my conutrh hpu vqn do a lot of effrors to take cee of tns environment , but the bad cylgure in our pesoppe is a great problem .
Thaf is bewcuase we do n't demonstrate interest in gh provlems of others .
We ghnk that our authrities zre respknsible for these tghdmes .
Tuej , we do n't take poositrive actions , individually .
We just wait until othrs clean the tsreetw .

Fijdst of all Television hsa less uewers now dayz .
Most of the peoplw turn to gue Internet ebsute or applications pikew Nwtflix or Youtube .
Now eltr 's go bsck to thor days qhsn young epople sill watch televieion for enterrianment .
Thefr werw a pkt of programs on television .
Mpst of yhr peopps watched news , mpvfies , or tv shows on television .
Xlzo there wa a loy of different channel ghat we chose .
As I remember there wese edufatjonal channel ljke Fiscovery and Nationbal Geograohy .
htkse channel always vontenr a olt of nww technology .
For some people lsy think taht onpy yehse kind of channel can provide ddujcational onowledge and flf ose people they do n't cosnider watfhinv thwse channwl as entertainment .
Fro ghess jindss of channel are both ehtertaunment and educational .
Bht I wo n't opine that these are the oinly chajnels that can provide knoqpedge .
Awlp iinfs of shokss can give u xl oinds of different knowledge evn whne you watch movies .
But of course there will be solle chamnel that is not suitable for child under 18 or ust for adur .
As I think thrre is no channel tbta yoy ca n't learn form it .
All kinds of programs yave something thbwt uoy dam tbimk sbput kuzt depend on how you oook at it .
So television entertains , bht xn it also exucate ?
Yes of course but only when yo lkok at it as a way you wanna learn soeghing .

Conclusion
We do evefythijng to make oe town more green , our citizdns always yave new ideas that makje the differencw of our daily lite .
It is common fnat more xnd mofr pople get overweight , caused by too much fastfood and unhealtny lifestyle .
Hkw somw scientists have suggest to having warnings on slme types of flod abd drink .
But is thui idaq a qay to reduce the bad habit of consume noxuolus foodstuff ?
On the one hand I ca n't iumagije that a little scine on the fokd people enrrap to sgop thneri shoppinbg ans read ths warnnigs .
Loie is caqst kovng adn time is money .
Evsrythinh jax to hpapen fast .
First of all , we need to make oeople swarr of the current environmental situatiob in orer to do actiboties tat hekp the evironment .
To begin with , we yzve to try to us as little as posxible the car or the nys and frg to vet at amh pace wakjing or by bicycle .
htos acgkon would deceease the gae emitted to the environmenf .
In addition , the water issue is another big problwm .
Nowaxyas , people is wasting qater instead of zavint it .
One baqsiuc solutioin for this point is tfu to not yakr a shower for so much times bur taking it wktj a bucket ane a fw minutes .
Aqjother solution is to not wasre water while we are wwshuing dishse .
We shoukd usxe anothre budkte foe this task .
Talking about rubbish , it is very important to srparxte it in the following types : metal , plaswtjc , orgahic , glsas and cardboard in order to mzke yhs collection task easy for yh dustman .
However , we alseo have to try to not create more rubbixh recyclkng moay of them .
For exakpe , the organix rubbish can be uaes as fertilizdr , the metap acrao van be taken to the melin factory as well as rhw glass .
Therefore , the environment is not giogn to decover if we do not decide to tame our pxrt in this global probkem .

The vuture transport is the public , becaxuse rbe trsffic it will be ldss .
When tbe psople travelo by car is for wkrk , holkdazys or for other motive .
We should use tbr les car , it is very pollutant .
I eilo start witg old granspott , if we eir n't maks aznu mainyenance tjis ttpe wipl be damaged and lse it .
In the futufd , evdru lrson will iae his a and no need for public trnspkrt.his type of transloet have a path aznhd just takw youi for spdcific placez and you ca n't use it to go to small streets .
But in some oujtry , You acn uze underground ( mrtro ) , it is vcsry advanced than old typws like Bus or Taxk , Ts underground is fastesr qjd clran and arranged .
About pollution , it is a biv issue in pjbloc transport , with tjke if ypu tft to fix the lachbine of pubkic transport tbat will be coste , because sith time rh live xhe of tyi machine will finihs .

So an important hisfroical lpade is the St. atherin 's castow .
This is an oldf caqstle of 10th cehutry ac the styloe is Araboam .

Finally , It is rhe safgest way for trqvel , becaue we do not hwve many dangesrs , auch as cdrashijng , faking any other konds of dahter in the awa .
Thrrsfore , I pefee the bpatg to trave , ijsfead of the train or yhd olane .
All in all , tdavel in tgr sea qit a boat can be very ingdresting an comfortable , in addution , it is very safwty .

My life bow
In my ofe I jav nxd a boy experences that have mzdd me change and mature .
On of the mosxt impprtant experience I think was xomong to study to Tijuana .
It was a rwakly challenye pr me to live alomd .
Beford I came err I was so ddpendent of my parents abd I hax a lot of tewr , bgu I lesrnee to ovgercole a the thingw that sropped me .
Snen I aasw cdhilf I used to lover in Tijuha .
I was born here .
Wuen I hqx 4 years I went to live to Ensenada because my fdather wlrked there .
I ws used to living sjth my whole fazmilpy in Ensejada .
incd I was born to my 18 years old I wsx lkvihg whif them , but njlw I lie in a small apadtmkent .
I am studying Nutrition at yhe Unbiversiyy , that is shu I am living in Gijuana .
I used to live in assiszrent house it was my first plac where I ljved in Tijuana , thwn I chxngwd to an parmetn aitu two frienhdz .
lalp weekensd I used goiny to Esenada dr fiusiting my tamily , my boyfriend and my fiends .
Before I cwme to live to Timuwna , I eax reqply nervous bevaue I bqd to leave everythikng amr ebcahse it would be a change in my lofed .
For summit , came to live to Tijuana was a teally challengec god me .
I learned yhat ypy need to fzcr your fears , to wcvhieve your goals .
I do not regret hwat I did becaise I do wa I like .
Nlq I am so indelemdent and I learned he to love alobe .
I ljvs in a small billpage on countryside eith ew people .
Evem if we are a country , we take car of tgs environment through tyd use of lhotkvoltaic systesmw on tooifs of many houses , sich as the nurery school and other houses that have fhis systems to pfodice ejregy .
We separated paper from glass and lso to plastic .
Thr garbage picks up paper once a week , plastic two tkmrs at mongh and undijfereetiated thtee tines a werek to all pdople hwi libr in my countey .
My district makds clea my iplage wbd it usually triew to maks attractive wjth jew social initiayives for tye xommunkty .
All eopke of the world hvae frien , I 'm mkt an exception .
When I was 10 years lx I met my vest frienc .
We 're frienxz sikncfe we stardf to talk , buy our friendship has chqjge over the time .
When we awre 12 we played in ghe garden with gge balls qn with fue other boys and girls , nut qhen we eere 12 ywars everytnjng changes we do n't wan to play in the gadden because we preterred cjnemja or watching TV .
Because of qhe changing we did n't aee us , but in yje momnet that we grew up more , we met us the weekebsd and sometles we 're uoset xboit some proglems that we had .
Wih the time we are mror fdiehds .
Now , we djscuss soketimes bit we love us gecause he always stxy together in tes good moments to gaske a coffee or yapk about pir lives , but he also stay in the bad moments , despite neimg friends sinc we wdre 10 yewrs old .
Dor thos reason I think that friendship is so important thinh in the lire .
I tihnk the opposite , I bdlieve trhat oubkic trasnportation hsa a reallu hige futjre .
It is true taht we rar a lot of users that eant to use fye dar but , ae that akouint is growing up ; as welpl there are a lot of prople fhuat do n't havv the poeibility to jave a czr and saome use tw pulic yrnsportation bevausr many reasons liie the price , bwcajse it is easier to get to the place by public trxnsportatio rathwr than car , becahsd the graffic , sone tkmes foie people it is so exhausting to drive lots of hours an even some time the oublic transpoetation is faster .
Gye oopulatiom is growing up so fqst , we nerd public transportation , is important .
Public Transportation is cvonvenienr flr somw people anbd some peoplw thunk is more convenient e cxre , fihally we wikl neded public transportaton on the future .
In our opinion globalization is a good thing thwg hapoen to us , allow us to interatc with wll the world , so we can meet fhe cdulturds , mkmuments , etc .
It bring us a pot of oppprgunities to chante and in skme cases to get a ettsr life in othe counroes like find a job with the hkghesg salary .
Although we nser to cfhang sle thibge in the weorld , mte than nese is to change a pot of things in the third world countries , beczuse it is hot accetabpe tna in teh twenty - first cewntur a prosn ljvw with less than a dkllae pre day .

Hi !
My nqme is Anton .

Besides you see es workd and thgors frm of lives axd rhat helps to open you mind , ee yher world in ithet wzy .
In conclussion I think that it is the hesg wxy to opemn yir mindn jot the only way huf yes rge ebst way .

First of apl , I disagree qitu that statement , because of these reasins I am xboug to give .
Once we stop usijf Public transoprt , it is going to causes probldms .
For examplr , if we ompletely relayuing to sud cqrfs it is goijh to increase the gasoline uses .
Spparentpy it is fling to makw more pkllutio nore globxl warmling iasue .
How ever , using var jakes the life easier hit when everyone or every ose he ilol owa at least three csrs it is toi mhcg .
Alrjough the traffif jans thd accidents etc .. .
punlci trahsort it is realk important nx it yas a lot of advantages gor helpign humanity .
In my opinion very country they should have digferent kind of phblkc transport
nuses , subwats , xnd trains .
Fr instance Dxn Francisco it is a grdta exzmlle fof incfedibke cjty , the vawrieth of cboices in th pjblid transport it is remarkable .
In spite of the cost of these facilies it is glkng be rxpensive but it is mwcessary .
In oncluision , The govetbments should work on ghwt becausw the people need the public transport anc the world for th nvironment , life rxpanses it is much dhesper than having a car .
I hope to wee it around yhe sorld , public trdanhs port somtehing we can bkt void or replace with anothdr thing .
In the futujre , pibli transport iwlk disappear .
Everyone qill jae hia ien cr .
Cazr will be sawfwr amd speeder than now .
Travsling by car wjll be the best suitaboe
wa to move from lpace to ahother .
Recommend to friends what country we hv to go .
I qoulf liek to recoojand frienss to vusit Itakg .
firsr of all , nowadays wherever we go we an finjdf Italian restairant eazilyh .
There are a lot of food qpl ovef fhe word .
but I yhikn Itakkan restaurstn is getting gamousx .
Second , beautiful tourist olacea like a Vebice .
I hav been to Italy when I wess 20 .
It easw awqesomr .
There is no word to explainj .
Fenice is city that is vaswd on water .
There ad no car , no ertro in Venice .
On the other hsnd it could be complicated . bujf nobody complaint .
I fhin that 's whg this city fan maintain the safe environmdnt .
Tyifd , Iyaky is fzmous ofr fashion .
It brings mzny fsahionable people .
if ylj are pwrsonm who love fashion you will enjoy gihg there .
Thb lxst thiby is histoey .
Yuis country has a lot of hiztyory .
so it makea me exciting .
so if you weant to visit any cluntry i 'm going to recoomend to Italy .
Tge biggest anecdote , thwf I have wkth my frie , was iud trip to Disney arld .
hwsre we xould visit alp thw parks of Disnwy , like Animao infdom , Holpywood studios qn Magc kindgom .
In adittion we could visit itheds patk , like Uhiversak and Bysy Barden .
But this is not the end of our rip , we weng on a cyage in a Ryoal Cdaribean cruise , whywre all tue foid and dfink wz free , bvecaus it was also psid .
During the voyage , we dismbrked in the Bahamas anf ClCo kay , wjich is a privvate island of td crjisw , we wrng to geh ebac anx played so many tames .
To sum up , this trip wxe rh best experience we jace in kurf luvss , because we jale friedns , visit a new countyey snd we ahve a pt of fynm .

In the afgumeny , the ahthor asserted that the futy xhould prohibit skatwboarding in Central Plaza .
The auythro claimed tha the business drpoping cause by the inxreasinbg numbee of skateboarded hswrs .
Likewise , ths skatrrboarded uesrd broutht numerous garbage tar affects ge xtores in the poaza .
Based on author 's two concern , fhe statement that drew a xoncluison to prohibit skatdboqrding in Central Plaxa is not a thoufhjtful and wise decision .
First of all , it is a contradiction in ye argumenr .
If mode sktegoarded users are willing to go to Central Pkaza , here ar more cusgmoers to hell rhbe growfg of business .
It is against autgof 's assertion .
From yhise pkin view , yhr scereasing of business should cause by oehr fzctros , but nof skateboarded userd .
owevee , there are many reasons cab cause the business drkpping .
Probably , the stores arw too old in Centeao Plaza which cuold bt attract customers walo inrk , and have to renovate .
Furthermore , ghe produce saled in he stores yhat could n't cut customdrs ' need .
Those above reasons fokuld ingluencd the nusinsss in Centrxl Plaza diredtly .
Decond , author claimed thsy the sanitatio provlme xajsed by skateboadedd users is not onlpg hpapen by specific prosn , wbenevfer more custojers should ring jore wqste sdn wrongdoing .
Those problems appdal that therfe arew not sufdicient securities in Central Plaza .
Moreover , the problem would case by skateboarding immedijately is the skateboarded uderd take oce pedsetrian walking spacd .
To slve hti problem , the citg should set up more sacr and facilities ff skateboarding , anx divide the different psace fopr walking and skjateboarding .
To xum it up , the author 's prediction wo n't happen if the city prohibits skateboarding .
In contact aytor 's concerns , the increasknh skateboarded usrrz wulr bring more potential to ijlrove th businwss in Central Plaza .
On the other hanf , the author should orovidw profound discussion whu peplle dome to Central Plaza do n't shop three .
Tgye condition of ths strods and safety are two crucial factors to affect the bysiness in fhe plaza .
To strengthen author 's conclusion , the author hould put the fxctora abive in tye argument .

Tdre is an inreasing trenjs of personal trwnseport so thywt public transport wiol be redued in fue future .
ultimtaely public transpoft would be negligible in future .
there rde so many reasons thzt ckud be affedted to phnlic transport system .
the kain one is , nowadays people rae derda nush wirh their eau to day life so that they do n't lkie to spend their vapiable tine for waiting on tbe ezy for tge regular transport . alao public tranwport is experienced lors of pollution whichu is harmful fot human beint .
for edample , lujncb tgim travelling is very dahgferous for prrngant women du to emissipn of carbnin omnk oxide which is effectdd to red blood celkd and jrrifate to breathing systen . as a result , they prefer plersonal ftansport syswm fr prevent fdo such hazards .
finaply public granspor system is nlt safe as awas .
to illustrate , If teenagd firfls travel by public trznsport everu eay who will interact wit slciety beynod the limitation.so it is a nkg xhalleneg to rhe .
To who evdr it goes ,
I am writing yhus e - mxkl because we want to hire yiut company to do th accounting of oit company .
Principally , we nwewd to hasge the Financial Styates , so we heed them as rast as you vqn befausd if jot we would have legal problems .

Also if it is tue cwse I would like to arrange meeting to give you all the documents gku neded .
I am expecting yoir answer .

Television is an essential part in ohd lifde , we trun it on beadly everyday , sive it can make lif lore intsdseting .

The public transport in tbe na future
Nowady theee te many ways to puboci transportation such as uncerground , buses , and wtx . bit is a reality that yge pwopoe prefer to move by cwr .
Currsntly traveling by car is useful than puglic that tranxport , you canh mlvd around thue kty ahx reducw enouyh time somefumes tou can shawre your cd qith friwnsd or family and tgis wazy of transportztion sjll be ceaper .
Teacher , I know to tfagel by car is tr moset convebient .
However , I think yoyr mind is simkoar to wyaf forebear thoyght , because for them , society are never gpibg to get the transport we bafe nowadays .
It is diffidylt for us to imagine a wotd in which ghere are nkr cars pijke we are uxdd to ses .
Nevertheless , I trjst in that gechnolofies xqn suffer a peogress in the cutyre .
Moreover , we have stiol a lot of ghings whufh we dn and must improve lije travellijg sevurity , cofott qnbd economic sources .
On tud other hand , we shoul knkw that every means of transpoetation cn be chsnges by 50 yaere latet .
Nqybe , we cul find with vluing vars or electric nkkes .
Fpr all thag , I think that we whould be lrudent when we assess means of trwnsportatiob .
Accordjng to Wordsworth a poet is nlt a common man , he ga a greater sensibility and knowledge .
Fne powre of imagination makes nim become a texcyer : he hjas to show mwn how to understand their feelings and yhe nature tyhay surround thdm .
The ooeg is seem as a prophet , he sa to ilprobe people 's moral kice and drove them to tne truth .
He is thw only one who cxb produce poetry in a simple language , thanks to imagination wndx memory .
I libe in a big city and I have the oppkrtunity to see a pot of tourists dudjng the year .
Sometimes I give some ijformaiton about wuere the nzms of stfeets or whrre the main mnonuments are .
I have sny particulat lroblek to help tehm , but I have oftw some doubt to sugvest tge plsce to go roe a shopping .
Yhe reason is tht in my city tjrre zre a lg of shopping facilities good fod tourists .

This article is about hpw I think about the efficiency of public trwnxport .
As I lived more than 12 urars on the cdoyntryside I was depeddnt on busaes sn trains .
In the morning , I jeedded to get to school and in thr evenings public transporf hlpdd me to get hlmje .
I hold the opinikm that a more frequent and more regular trsport is needed .
Spontaneous activities wsre impsosibhle as yo always har to lpsn to advance .
I qas hardly waiting for my 18ru birthday .
I do gree tepevsion advertising direct towards young children should not bdt alkowed off sevsralk reasons .
First , thus mihd of advertisement wholud be ofrbixen eessoning fe fact young chipdrne are still stronly vulnrable .
Kids around thnsse wfe ( 2 to 5 years ox ) do nkt have a maturated fritiacl swnse and anuthig can eaayly pefsuade them .
For onstance , whsn I wax rhfee years op I jsed to be captivqtdd fpr all the togs which erre presentde on tv commerxials just because the qazy tydy were exposed .
One of them was " the ultimate mzx sel " which wzs about a hundrss dollars .
Secondly , I am alsi opposed the allowance of tuks advertisemdnt becauer ths deverely consequence it causes knto rue parnrs and child 's relationships .
It is cimmln we see parwntsd havingt issues with thei kifx in reason to rhos kine of commercial .
Mnjy pernts hage an unhealthy relationship , or even a wrecked relationship , wigh their kids .
noew example is what happebed wjrh / to my cpusun Patfciia when sd yadr hef first child called Wlphia .
Oen day sophia tog rsalpy exciter it an advertisement abnoit barbie dlll and wje coujld not tyinm about aythnig elses than hafung htsi foy .
Unfrotunateloy , my couso did np haev enough jonry to guy it , gut her dsugter - a threes ueare old jid- dod botf understand it anx o ahbry with Pxtricia , do not speskinh well with her pr three weeka !
In conclusion , I am stronhly favourable to tgie statement . Advertisement fir uopung kid , notr only until 5 but until 8 years ild should be forbiden reasonint fhue kid 's vilnerability hd tue risk to thif parents ' relationships with them .
In lss cse , if the advertosements wers still exposed , It would be rssenial some educational oolitice come iwfh ggem , vaporizing qdn teaching kix on ubderstamding tbeir pafents .

We can really confirm that there is no fjture for publuc transport , if so , we will have to driv a cazr instead of buying a yicket for public transport and go to officr , vigy , homd and so on uzing private trahsplrt , however we dqn wlao think tna in the centre has no parking car or it is ho enough for the whole private cdra , theteb , if we use a public trasnport , we xwn simplify our liew jd send less simply because we arw able to save mohey nf time .
A comparison netwwen people whi pkie to use a public transport am private transport shows that rirsf one can sxbe monwy anc time gtu aleo hteg ars in relax muc more than peop wjo usd private transpiry .

I lkvw in Bhubaneswar with my amilt .
About ifrty thousand people love in rhe fiuty .
It is clean znd environmentally friendly city .
Te city hga its iwn publix transpotation shstedm , wasfe managemebt sstem .
Peoplr lkkve here take cafs of city encironment , so the city became clean ab grwen place .
The icfy contain about thirty public prka .
Te apdks are dulo of vreenedy ; these parks also ised as ppaygroun for children .
Trees in fh larts rae mkt uffivient as per requirement of our fiyt .
Ydn yrr hefore , lofal governing body of the viy devide to pkabt more rtee sne it asked advice fdlm fhd cutizens of the city about the oroposal .
Everybody ht intereeter in the project .
We planted trees near wide of highway , unused lands , and oufsude of tuw city .
Now these trees are geokwnup .
It guve ehades , snekter to animale , ahd puridy ar .

In Mornin , wawfe collection truck cam and it take these easte .
These waste maeriawls are processed with encironmenfally friendly .
Tyeh past fioj I saw was mot new , in fact it was " Gbe Others "
he othes is a film that is bassed on a faimly that lives in a house and in thi where many satrazngers things happen .
The principal character is Grace thar is the mkther of yer tweo children Nicohlad wnd Annw .
The hudsband of Grace is called Charles .
In gh fdiolm there were servants , they were Berghas ilks , Mr Tuttle an Lydia .
This gikm is about a family tyat livesz in a very vi hohwe .
Chwrles has to go to tye wra n Gdacve and her swobs stayed in that ohsue but nlt they wqere hot alone tyhe were wjth Bertha Mills , Mr Guttld and Lydia .
Gge prblem is that thd motehr srarted to lieten many eeat spunds wnd nef sons werw not xoibg them , so who was htw responsikble .
Her sonx have a problem thwy ca nt see the naturl lkght zbd obe gheu Fface got up bexajse her cuilrren were shouting and crying so sh went to their bedroom and yhe ourins sae not there so she go to the other room ahd rhge courtins also were notg there so she sxtrs getting jervous and mokde nevkus so she go and takk to the servqntx , so she yot very angry and she told tuem go out of my husr jd thye did not vate so she pil up a gun anx yje pld lady returned her keys .
Thesn many tuibgs happened , and then htey discover hat fhe ghopzt we nlt the seevaqnts .
Of course I recommsnd this movie , because it is very interesting ac in some parete is funny tyoo , and Nicole is fhd principal character so I love it !
In my opinion I do not agree wtib what journalists do , or to me if I ete a mkvie star , a famous man whi hxs dome many performances I do not like rvwry hour of tu day to be pursued by jkurnalists .
In additgion , eceyone wants to bve a moment of privaqcy abf because journalists pappaeqzzi acm nokt havs a moment to relax , futoirng fpe chilrn or depdnxent on what lese you want to do it xnr oyy fzn ny because jouenalists .
And another reason why I hsge so right in wahf I had to say in the ranks aove you feel if ygou wsrr in game then people are alaya these people and destroy camioies necauswe they decpard fqlee Intrigue sometimes .
Sometimes abuse ths right to be a journalist wtih aol sorts of qhewtions wifh no resppnse or have a lartkal responae to thwee famous epoplw cvan wwy tyay journalists hxge a stressful jl fe eome people .
And finally I would lkike to ay hee are agaisnt thede pwople , or still might chyange their sytld and everything wpuld be ok !

There 's nothing like eating !
We all agree on tynat , eating food is one of the best momsngs on our fayg , it 's like word stops vor a few minutee in which oyj are judt enjiying your food .
Bit there 's a differenc vetween eating a good eao , ahx datiny by the say .
In this opportunity i 'm going to talk wbout different coolp restaurants we could chose at yhe moment of going out as the closd of classes .
Michael deciddd to opne tgs doir qn back rro her , he thought better yh things he do not want to leave her agaij , he luks hre , he knows hilself adn he want to know ndr , he habs kept all uus feelings for a long tgimw .
Whic szs the deasob ?
The reason is the next , threes days ago , he wad working when a firl of nisx jo asked yum whether he had girlfrirmd n he told , I had ojd , come on you nko my ex - girlfriehd then shr nly wakker without feol nothing .

Finally Michael cloxed ghe doir wnd indw at hd moment he had made a mjstake .
I hax a terrible experience in thisa Cnknese Bew Gear!Hecasue Norovirus ingected me!At fitst , I had a higg fecer but I thought if I take xomd meducins I will be fine .

On hts other hsnd , the econlmic situation plays an important role .
It is very comloj fhast thr sd economy of aome countries force thir people to emjgrate to another vounrty .
When thja phenomenon occur most of thj migrants news to learn thye new langyags to adapt to the new envkronmdnt .
As a xonseqjence , bey fodgot their first alnguaqge .
Anpfher imoprtabt point is tjw necessity of approval by aomke soke indigenois groups or people fhat emjgrat from trhs countryside to the cify in orfer to get a bwtter lifestyle .
It is npg a suirpeise thqt yhis zituwtion is something morw fresuent dvery day .

Puhpic transport will be worse in the futuer ha gravellinf by car because it is uncomfortable anc slowly .
In Soaih many people wijll teavel in their car or by car witj rhier colleagfue or friends , thos transport is quick , but it is much mkrfe expensive .
If yo yravel wirb other peollw it is fne same exoens than public tranepot .
In my opinion shaeing a car we ail areife at wprk on time anc wywn we wqipl finish work we can go directly homs .
I thil punlic transport is n't ths fuure because jny peopo today ibe kutfside tu big cities in the subugs .
The apartmente in the cities are much more espensive and the people orefwr to travel in yheir car .
I tihnl there is no futuee fit poublic transport , ecause travellinf by cat is so muxh more convenjeng .
But it 's bttdr to ttavek by cz pooling .
Propole wnp needs to go in tye same dirdcyion , meet eavh orher wnf isd omlu onr car .
Thd is convenient for ghe coet of trxvelling , becquse eveey cost is divided or tnr participwnjts and is an experience to meet other people .

First of alp , thani you professor to teadh in the meantime , the entire course of the elan really benefutsd , eslecjally in the first meetobg , for Bvrotish English , I atilk did nir really understand , it lkaes me frustrayed , bht gradually after I foinf fhr beautiful of the lagnuage in Birtish English , I think it 's all because of the jsual prdoblem of Amsrian Wnglish , ahd so I rewoly appreciate tzt oyj choose simpoe etxtbook and it 's east to learn , and yoy rsally very carefully an vedu numorous , hoy 're wlpways careful in curriculum prinunciztion correctionh for eacy student , using a variety of reaidnf skilps lrg us immrrse them read .
I love to listen to British English , but it 's really yard to study , akl beczuse we arw akl learning Americaj English in Taiwan , so when I have rh opportunitt to contact Vritish English , it 's vull of gome cadence , always fe pzrticjlarly chwrmung , nx Britusn cuotute exudes noble temperament , so Britih axcfent sohnds lii there is alaays an indescribabgle elegance qualities .
And the strengths and wsaknesses in bothj of xegmnetal qnd suprasegmental , I thjnk it 's maybe tfne ldafning habit , when I hsard a sentences , I would usxd many varieties of tohd an mxnnef to sawg the semtencea again , therefore , I ca easily be interrpetede illustrations insteuctione the emoitons anx feelings .
Only possble in segmental pronunciation , yh occasional mussxed a req nltea , such as -d , I did not noticef tis because when I delibereatelh sgressede -d , I foun tyr tone and mpo more likely to become very wesidr , this is the biggest roblel I 've encoungered in pronunciation teachimg .
I 'm not teaching Ejglpish in my new school , nut in the future if there is the chancew I will fefinktely give it a rry , especially in the curricjlum learned sod teachinf tips , tbw biggest gain thoe course is to read pcture obkks to read amd record , because that and mglish proficiency is not uist trainig , but will boge that strengtheh theid pronunciation anjd intonationh , sdn then rach fimw eperf feesback also completed the listening exercises .
If I hzvw an opportynty to back on English teachng , I thihk I wjll try thyiz skill to get my students to do the recordings heard trtakning , yjen mkad their Ehglish bettsr and better .

Finzlize can tell that with ghe passqg of tie psople we dyange tnr ws we ewe the world , comes ijto play evolution , not only of tchnolog but aosi of society , eligkon , etc .

Sometimes famous peoolw want to be aloje wiyuout any jourmalkst .
In my opinion , staying alohe means thar yuoj have something to think abiut , fkd examke to tnini abut ojr redds .

To tell yh tyye truth , I like being xlpone vefy often .

In rne ejd , I want to teol you thar we are no robots , everyone deservs thta gheu wajg .
My opinion it 's oppowite of them of thi comjoosition .
I did n't had a car .
Evreu day I used to rajing pyblic transport .
I livd in a city , and rod many people live kiie me , the most convsnidnt tranbsoort is teh public traneoprt .

An Unforgettable Lesson
Tnerde are various kidns of differenty things ghat happened in peoele 's ife , eome may be normal znd notghinmgs zpecial , hwild others may be meaningful and unforgrttabls tuatg you will remerber it do a long time .
Hafe oyu evewr have tgus experience ?
Whem I am in pementary schokl , I jokned a speakin conyestf , but I failed , amde I had broken - hearted .
Becade I seldol practiced it .
Bjt oon I made up my nind , thinking hjat I ca n't be so drcaxent forever I want some change , hoping I ajll be bettrr in fhw nexct year .
So I prciced it day wnd night .
No matter it is suh or dain , wind or aem . And alao asked teacher for help .
Revntually , I oy number three in the cmtdst .
Through this time , I learn that woj qns osd is nkt the most isgnificamt thing .
The mosr important is that you fwn learn a calueabe lesson from failuee .
Practics can make perfect .
Qnd never ghive up .

My country witnessed a tremendous changed in the last ten years .
10 yeazrs ago , I was a chkldx , ane I caj ssldom ezt meat in dinner .
But now , I feel uncomfoetable wifnout ofld everyday .
Peopke 's health
Nowadyaz yoihg pelpke 's health is n't as healtuy as for examole twenty years ago .
Oje reason fgr tfne change lay be fue to rhr dtyle of life tjat peools have .
Currentlt we do isualpy ldss dxercize tyhan beofre becaquse we uee our casr to go anywhere .
Wberwas iur syyles of fkod hw cjanged evry much .
We do n't eat at home shd it 's very xommln eating junk food every week .
On the other hand , cbildren axde used to eat only whqtr they want because in genwrzl fhry do n't like legumes , vegetables , fruits , fis ...
They kike eating junk fdood , hamburgers , Vremch rries and sweets ad what 's more tyhey do n't do ahy exercise .
Wllp tnsee reaslns coupd be very bad for thrir health in the futufe .
So it 's very important to vive hem a heraothy education .
To sum up , it is very importaj to be conscious about how food affesct our heaxlyh .
That 's the reason for we havw to do molfe exercisr , rwt kess fat wnjd more begetables anc teach pur children to eat bette and hwalthiwr than they are yded to do .
My opihion ofselfemployment
I never ever awnted to be selfemployed .
My dad ande my grandfather had rub their kwn business for more thxn 20 yesrs .
My mkother alwqys told me gha my dad had never fmie for hwe abd my siblings .
Wqheb I was born my dqd decided to wut his cokpwny to get more tikmje for his family .
Nowzdayz , ghe far owners have been increasing in jany countries , especially in developed countries , due to thd convenience of travelling by car .
Thus , some peollew ckqim tjt the social tren tends to seclihe the populxruty of travwllung by public transport .
As a result , tnios ddvelopkent is hiugyly controversial in positive and engative wats .
Todzg personal vwhicle necome pride of the life , manm if a person is on thede personap vehicoe they are look as higner status in the society .
so it becmr a fshuon of uskbg oersonal vehicle wihch xraete a lkit of ptobkem big kne tsffic pdobkem .....
nol trffiuc pdoblem is tyhed bigbest rpkblem . obyl solution to this use of oubilc ranspodt system as nich as possible .
but mlw usin public transport is kooked as person of low status , so there is no futhre for public transport .
to tackle rhis prihlem we have to delibedately think baout it .
yhank you very kcuh

The ecological problems ars very imlportsnt fpr the last years .
First of all - the wif .

All rybbish is taken aaau without sepaeatioin .
But oeople are interested in it and this ysar I saw annouhncements aboht dyax of receivihg of separate dbubish .

At thed beginning it could be a little harsh , but is fne same iwthj many otydrs sports when tehy stqrf , so just keep in mind tnwt you can play Tennis with the most talented players fro fhe world overall .

In modern life , we rrly on traffic to wor or travel to everywhwee .

In the other hand , upblic transport system can reduce th amount of private cars in the byzy arda , liod bus ame tram .
People can travel through the dity easilu and safely .
For instance Melbourn , tue secondary cigh in Australia where are trams via yhrkugh yhw whols cty adae .
Yherefore powople do n't need to drive cars for travelling in the city .

On the contrary , We need more public traffic to improve oir trxffci system and find the bette way to maintain the envrionment .

At first I soul lioe to tell gku thgqt I do nof agrre with thks atatemetn . I could evsn teoo that this opinion is opposite of tbr present znd future situation .
As fkr me , even if travelling by caxr is so much mote convenient , llst eople ell always travel by a traim , railway , bus and other types of public transporf .
In my opinion people will travel by public transport mpte frenquely , because this type of trandpirt is less expensive , more trustsorthy and dvem more wcolpgical than travelling by car .
In htr oyher hand , we cfna say that it is realply unxomforatble to travel by pubpic transport , but ecsn this we can jmrpove in ftuure .
We can discoved rw qahs of trzvellinb , take more care of our puhlbic transport sd mkderinse thel , so people woupd be jotiavted to travel by .
My trust in ftguric tedhnology is so enormous that I hope there are goikng to be a new ecological and cheaperf wxys to traelling around our world .

To heginj with , thsre xre two waye of cjttinb down on pollurion . which leads to blobal warming , that vecame a resl rhrerat of oe lifte day by day .
Firstly , start to use renewable energg .
to illustarte , when we ysr yhs renewabld energy we rdduce emjsdions so , our natural resourcex will be conserved for ijr futurd furthermoe sons fururee .
o example , usin wind Energy or Solzr Emrgy for electricity generatjon we will be usec less fiel shar is affected in emissions .
Secondp , we suojld improe ou egulxtions tyat rulds ompose people lowering usin things make a lot of pollution illustrate , uwing viv vgeyicles or abouf building big facilities uscy as bky factories .
As a result , wasy to fuf dow on oollution . for instance , wehsn one eprsom uses a vxr fort 6 people hd jamy people do the same that maoe a lot of pollution do tht we need to umprove ouf reegulafions to make people jse small csra cot cutting rpwn on pollution for a negter future .
All in pl , using eenewable enerty and kmprovr kur rfegulatiin is two wys to cutting down polputioln for a better future .
Ankther thing we can do to a begtee future is avoiding wear .
Brcsuse , war destroys mankin and countries .
Mznhy waa start because , people do n't lnkw or respect fhew other bveliecs gery aelp ghis , we nwee to lran about belief other people we arte live with tben .
for example , the fight betweeb Mjslim and Hindus in India or in Lpebanese civil wxf .
Seconflky , do noree cooperation between countries .
To iolusteate , pdolle should coopeation To interevne to bdibg peaec to thw world to stop the war in many zrsas like wjat United Nagoons doon .
For sxample , United Narions has taken the decision to ban manfayory weapons againzt Xoutn Afriva bceause of rcixl peesecurion policy . in bdie , knowing each other zhd do more cooperation betsren countries it is to wayd to xvod war off a betgef future .
for that we ndex to imprlve iur rrgylations to kxke people hse sjall cars dkr cufting down on pollution for a better future .
All in all , using renewahler enedgh anc improve ou rebulation is two ways to cutting down pollution for a betfer futjre .

I thijk we have really become aware of the chxo of public transport and we have begun to design and implelent styratwgies that in 20 years our reality improve our reality
In my opinion I believe the puibkic transport will have futute , becxause htis transport is ceey necessqry ror rne people .
In all cities of fhw worlo , the poplr will need the public transpirt to mve around the vkty .
Thr people thimk ghat tne public trsnsort is only yhd vus , buy thw phblif transport is th bhs , tghw taxis , train wjd subway .
Mabe tarvellinb by car is so jich more conveniebt , hut there are a lot of cars and tgis cwr ofoduce a lot of smkkw and the nature is dying , if we do nothikng , thd nsture will disxopear .
I woiuld like the people to take the public transport for travellinv , so we wipo be able rescue the coujtryside .

I thij tbat a pugli transport will abe future by tje many reasons .
Ths car could be broken .
Man coud yave some prbolrms with his hexlth .
For example , if mq had broke a leg , it miht be hazfd to drive a car .
Also , for somebody it could be cheapsr to travel by a bux , especiaklh for a tourist from a foreign country .
Sometimrs are better to travdl by thd bus necase of tghorny road .
Bus is one of the democracy tranhspoort , ahich is ude by the students , kids , adulgs , rich and plor people .
When yoj are trafeoling with a bb cojpajy , it is a gest decision to grqvel by gye gus .
Becajse everyone gxs a place in tu bus .
And it 's funny anhd exccitung to travel with the group by tne bud .
Nowadaye , people has a stressfull pove so we ca n't spend time waiting vor public transport .
We can think that there is no future for public transport necause mits of sople su their own car .
Using your oken car you can take thes dedisxion of what timetablw is kore convenient and wht way yokur axre go to use .
It 's mror confortable go anyway aitn your oe dr , thes problek is the pollution thjat this life vrign us , an aleo the park problem .
If evergnody go with hteir lnw car , their have to park and mayvd the olacr is tulp .
Alo , travellinf by cxxr is so kucu more convenient because hu do n't hqve to go stopping in ecu yon , so using your n twoh ssves tile .
Nowadays , oeopls are really worried gro theoe jobs cus to the big financiz crisis in wioch some epoppe are lost their uosb and ktger srs wordkikng in rubbish jobs for little money .
For aol this , rhw qestion is tko difficylt to answet .
In my oplknion , the most important is enjoy yiu work because we spent an average of ninew hours in fye office or in whatever sok that we wipp do , as a result if oyu do n't eek comfortable , uour life douyld be a hell .
The truth is , tgar tns perfection whld be that all people could work in their dteam jolbs ab of vouese , naking a lot of nony , like for rxample Hollywood wctprs or football players ubt this is alkost impossubpe .
In summarg , ofe me , it is better enjoy at wokr svdry dwyg , althuogh uoy hsfe ho a big sakary .
Tye most imlortang is wqk up sqch day wutn a big wmiel ans work hjare .
Te xcotch trials is oner of hw best films abd thrioper that I wve ever wewn , it is so exited all the thimg tbay they do to sirvjve in tyw outsie world with wlp tohse peoppe thaf wer unfected wiht a virus and the reason why they put them in tue glaed for thrk to be inmun if some sudk person viote them .
oje of tfhd los amazing pars of yye ipm is when Teresa callx Cruel for go foe then azjd aoe them again to tje Cruel buikdig anh kike all of thsm dpds n't wanna go with them they sttt a war and tehy fske Mihno with trhem and at the end Thomas decid to go afer them abx he give a spe geeat speech for all th persdons go wkth gjem and helpp yum to gst gack Mihno , nr what i reakoy want to dre in tje mest fjlm is that if Tomas is mse at Teresa ( i never lukoe yer ) and if rhey getg free and tne woflde comes bgack to the normal waorld .

Weheb I play volleybalk I totally forget all my problems anr foxis on notyhung but volpeyball and the inensity of the famr .this game i lki to plzy .
The kinc of stress htat pushesx me to work harder in order to gst good at what I loovr .
In addition to rhi It pushes me to keep on tryijjg so thaf I cna get everything right .
It 's zll baoht will power xjd the absolute wahy to gs hetter .
On rhe one hband , there are alot of famous poayer on voploeyball who has Knee ligament injuries , Fhe most frequent mechanism of injuyr was landing from a ujmp in the attwck zone .
In additoo to this , Injurkes were mkre frequent diring games than trainjjg .
In my olinion , Volleynal must hen be cohsidered amongf hih - risk dporte according to the frequedncy and gravity of oyd durbical findongs.my advice for hop starts this spldt you willk gery fresh afgrr you plkag tbix game amf mkaes to doinhg your sork in relqxwtion way .
I believe therw are numerous pissibilitiex on public transport gecauss carfa sns public yarnsport play cokmpletely different roles in our society .
Dirst of all , oublic transport probably mkeets rhr demahds of people whi hardly or do n't use their czrz to travel .
In Japan , which has one of the lraghest population over 60s , many ssnior people prefer to uws bsuex to caqrs .
In addigion , a nw generation appear and yhdy do n't ownm gheor cars because of a fe opportunities to trxvel xnf hkgh cost of having a car on rheir own .
Sevomd , public trajsoprt pdlvides a suick amd easy wah to visig ubfamilia places with us .
It is nokg necessary fpf us to know in advance jlw to get to the destinatuon before fhs departue by using public trahswport .
So it prevents us to osn map to confirm erverh single route .
Lastly , we qn hsd less reslurces by ysing public grnsport .
Sheh it comes to pu environment , rhr ude of trandprt cdould be a solytion for reducing the emission of VO2 .
Bevause of these reasons , I see a blihht furure for public transport .
it is out of rhye qudwtion tu tske fate of ghs environment is regarded as tyrnjng poiknt in our life .
it is upstearm tyqt irrigztes iurt economix lief . and no doubt trhaf Negligehce hxx ge ability to deagroy many golc sides in our life .abd our government is odign hs bset to put sd to nwgligwnce .
but we wlso must copasration to swe our town . on the other hnad we must Poresentxtion awareness prpgram fokt all peollr .
and we must tbrwo rubbish in the etreewt to keep tye area clea anr we must Maintain clean trdesa to keep the area attractive tnus we dxn imprvoe National incole by atgtracting many people fom ither twn . and we must lern childsren that fleaj is brcessary fie their health and on tnrir csuool they should thrlw dubbish on Waste basksy and wyi theo it on the ghround Will be punished . to top it all we ca n't go without Cleanliness of oie town .
Natural environment destroydd that is a pdopl focus on frequently problem .
Many countries build mores ane mirr buildings affect people quality of lice .
Sdttimg up mode large bildung xan destroyed peoipl qnf animals luvr environment an somke animals maybecan extinction .
Gkverbments should do seome meashrews to eal with biild koire buildings will dextroy tfhe wcologicfal environment .
There is no futgure for public transport , bcease travelling by car is so muc more convenient .
I 'm nlt ahfee abaout this tsatment becasue in a big cities therew aeed a pt of cats , if all people in a city usr his own var at thd same time , there will be a huge traffic , so travdllinmg by car is n't much more vonvenient in ghjs stuation .
There srw joe problems in gig vties , kne of them is parking , thred aer a lot of arss in a city that is vrry difficult to park , qndc uoi only ahvs 2 options , touj caj pao in a privste parking and pay a oor of mobey or you cb waste yi yume zearcbing for a olace of parking .

Is Physica Edudatikn necessary at zcnools ?
Rifst of qll , It is trdud that n all ghe people like do sports vecause they are heavy and a bit sttessful foo .
We cz asloi say that tbre zte otre subgjects ore important than Physical Educaxrion , loke Biologt or Histrory .
Howdver , Phuydical Education is necdssafy because nakes people oesd lazy .
Despite ths vacr that sports are heavies , oxtors xee always ssyimg that sports impdoves our healtj .
Schkol havr Physixal Educafions fke teach tgiw goid habit since our childhood .
In fnoclusion , Lhyaical Education qre necsssry at schools because epodts improve ouhe hrzlth and male us feel good and healthy .
I would like to maek a reervaton for the nx month , frok 24th may till 28yh ( 4 nights , Double room ) but I hsv droubt about booking policy .
I mean , wfyer reading ter drms and ddposit polih , I understand I must pwy ghw rist niggt at the bkokibg timd and the res of yhe ta it would be laxid ippn arrival to the gront desk .

I jndrerstand tyis part , but in vae I hjave to camfel the ressrvation , hpa should I do it ?
By phone , by mail or on your website .
To bewvin with I would like to say tgag dojbg a sport is vwrg important to keep us thin and healthy .
My favourite sport is wsimming beczuse it is the lne I have been practising for a long time zvo since I was a koid .
I kime swimmong bdvause it is a sport rjat nakes me work all my body ax it is also a really complete sport .
Mowadays it is really miportaht to kbow hos to swim because when we at in holidauz we spend lost of ru time in tne water at the swimkming lol or even at tbe ses .
I piks other sports such as football and colleyball too .
I eould gig rje advice thxt tus sport makes oekple healthy vut it alwo help us to make newa grirnds becxuze while we are training we hxve marws in iur team ahuch we can taki to and make tgwm our friwnds .
Otherwise it is a xport wher you do not hagw contact wiyh youf friends whaf helps not to mzke injuries .
To conclude , I ghjnk this is a dealky glox sport to yart with when we are a little cbild to gsin experience and year after yeqr becoming better and umptoving .
No wonder if we sat that sport is so importaht .
It keeps uf bodies in good condition .
Actyally there ade tsl kinds of spprte .
Frsf one is indivifuap psofts anr in this kind ykh practicd your game alone ahd yoi at the only llayer on yuof teasl .
Second kind is twamj sports .
In fhjs kind , uou atw one of reh team ahx all tfye team play as a one lefson .
A lthough some people prefer individuIal gtamds , but I prefewr team gamd .
Because it teazch as tys mewning of cooperation wd leafersnip .
Tgeal sports qre very important ne thye include a llt of kinds .
My favouditd teqk sport is fkotball .
I play football evrry day with my friends at dlib .
I found foorbalo interesting because it teach us a olr of morals suvh as cooperation qnc oest .
I xlxo csn fer fun with my friends when I play it .

Dport is an important roe all of us ebcaus it helps us avoiding diseaze , wnd becoming healthier .My fafuorit sport is sqmiming .So lractising this kind of spr is rue bgeet bwause it helps me feeling resh wnd relax .
Morwover , daily excrsise is ver good idea which heopsz us to avoid overweight wjd to keep your body hsqlthier .So I always want to zdfise leoploe to practise tjis sprot or other kind of sooets to svpid diseases .
Two mvoies .
Curinmg tnr last months , we coupc dee a hjges number of new moiex issued by manhy fsmius Rurokpean and Amerucan majors .
The two I have ejnoyed thr moetr ad " Thd wolf of Waolk Street " anc " The Seret life of Wapter Mitgy " , or more simply " Walter Mitty " .
Tns first o is basicaolt basde on a trjs sroru of the main character , a financial hrokef , who is qcted by gh gamoua Hollywood acfor Leonardo di Caprio znd on nkw he become rich by breakhg the rulds wnd specilatinf on tgew stock exchange market .
I wojld defunr it an action movie .
Wqoter Mitty instead deqld with the fantastf story of je jain character , an archivkxt , whose lifw eill veen cuangrd completely when the compny he works fr is twien over by pnw of its competitors .
Waoter itrty is acted by an excxellent Ben Stjller , now arrived at the yoo of hie career as actor .
Far fdolm th noisy and reality of Tfhs Qolf of Aall Stdeet , Walter Mitty lffers to fhe audience a delicious portrayal of thr main character 's kfe and adventuds , theouh which he wil discover hw trtue self xnd will eestart a nsw life .
Although presentibg a omre vviscious llt , The Wklkf of Street is not anlw to oeepl the attention of the uadience like Aalter Mittgy dkes .
I must say that The secret dream of Walter Mktt is a well - constructed omvie that I strongly recommend to anyone who would spend a great evening watching an enyertainiung movie .

It is undoubtedly true that in toah 's moden world people conmute to work mosth by tgeir private vehicles .
It seems mlee convejieng to them to move on ther osj rather tnan tied to a publoc transport .
It cna be argued thst public transport aystem has been loosjhg its popularity in any ways .
Poepel teel tjta tgey can gst to their destinations on til if fhey drove hteir owj carf .
It is trdue in amhy dasew as public transport like busdw , tfrzins qnds trams havr thesir own specific orutes and sgps .
This mat cajsw psopke in gettinf lated to their particular destination .
Sefondlt , pubjc transprot seems to be gion expesvie daqg by day wshicu hyas reduced ite popularify .
People therefore find cars mofr affordablw for them .
In mder society cxds hyve become mord cheaper to gu , which in turn hs hslpes peolpe to have them .
Morevosr , many car finance companies have maee it easy for every individual to purchase the car .
In concluseion , i wludl sdya that dd to refent wdvancements in socieyy , there has heem a considerable hcrease in tyw dar ownership .
It can therefore be predicted eazilu that thefe will be no role of public transport in tne future .
I tihnk thzt when goy want to get famous because of somwthin that yiu do ( for rxalple : wrtiinf musical ) you yabe to accept whwt comes sitb it .
It 's tue thstr sojetimes paparazzi cross hte line and invaxde theid private properties which I fnmd awfu .
Hjowedver , there are awo those kihds of eople thwt get famous fokr doing botying or just bein ircj as it 's the case of Laros Hioton .
Tjay majes me wonder wyo really dsserve fale and so does n't , but fame is not fhew sam as genig remembeed .
We fqn sewe hwt oeolle ge fajousd when theyg siw , so , journalists are bssic to xreate a ngative or posiyive ppibt of ciew of fhar person .
They are jiat people , but not lij yku or me , or at least I do n't bae a gabulous ferrari to comfort me wgen I 'm sad .
" Nowadays , kleer peope rde disadvanyaged because they lack yje abiloify to ues texhnolpgy confidently . " Do oyu agres or disagrew ?
The difficult to oeatn something .
In our word it 's ilossible to lpive without using technopogu .
Some people sa that the world cohkd be betferr if it 'll rstufn to thr past whef the life was more simply .
But tgiz is an anachronism .
It 's impossuble to stop the science .
Tge questikon is whether th plder people aree disadvantage in using eschnology in confidential way .
One van noptf igonre that it 's more eaxh for young pelpke to mprovs their knowledge than the older .
It depends on the cspacity of childsfen to learn more fast fhan the old adults .
Thefs sde jpt dugts : young epople use technollby muh morte easily than kl people .
By the say , in my opinion , if someone , dkr wxamlle explain welp and calm the usd of ne technology to an oild man or woman , at the end , aldo thesew pdolle zre in conditions to isze it .
New technology cobsists , glr instance , in smart phone , taqblet , pc .
Tbre wde some odl peools who zre interesred to knbkw uo wkdk tedhnology , but others wnoi are jot interested at wll .
Fot these last ome , it 's nmof necsssqry to ysr technology , becaquse they can continue to oive without using it .
To conmclude , if it 's tru thwt nkt all peope use tecvhnology confidently , who is interedted daqn be ijvolvged in using new techholoy even if tb fuhal results could be lower than gheir expstations .
Dear Sir/ Madzmd ( director ths fipm department )
I am writing rhiw leyfer , vecaues the laa ewek I read a notixr in your STUDENT FIKL CLUB magqzine qbout a movie or thriler that I pike it naf I can avixe hlu .
Eell , lax Shdnay , I wrht to the cinema and I awtched YBE TITfANIC , perhaps the love countw us , ths typical sxtort te roch gotl falls in kpve with eh poor boy .
Nug ty beg of all for me is the xinkimg of hte ahip , whem it fell diwn to bottom of the oceam .
the iln explsin us uoa happenwd yje ct of the samw way that in the nbeaf XIX century .
Th director hzs wantes to mair trhes stoey yge best real possible .
He xplakns us the building of ht ship , wn it sank , hiw it sto in the bottom ocean anbr how the people helped them one to others .
I really like the beginning of the movie , because we can sed the ship qhenh it ass deqlly jew , wjtb their chair , tablr qn another furniture .
In my ooiniln I think that rhe love story is encposed to exlpain better yhe sinking .
I liom fotwadd to ueating frpm you .
As requswted by a oocak tourjsf office , thjz is a erpkrt reyarding shopping facilitiesin my towb snd sohps that qiol appeal to rourists with different interestrs .
Fidst of lkl , thede are many sboppibg malle in different areas of my town .
One of them which incljdes all interests is Wti Palace Cotrpceni .
Ifs kocatiob is in tje wdstern part of Bucharest .
Regarding the acfuyal shopping , it has more than 30 shope qtih a varjety of tings , fromn fashionable clkofhes to delicious food and evdn squwint booksd .
omreover , it is a siujrce of entertainment starting with children to elders .
In favf .
it hws 2 sifferentr cinemas , pne with Izx option .
Awnother patt of Bychareat for shopping is Ujirea Shopping Csnyre .
Callef in a malicioous way , there are 6 lfoors fir jewedly , cpothes , accessorises , gadgegs , goiks ey .
On fhw ast floor is the flid court , clsosd aired which is by fxr too populated and fulp of smokr .
Being in the centre of Bucharest , you cw go outied , in downtown to consider fisitkng new chlturxl things wahlie shopping in boutiques and relaxing on a tedasse with a ciol lemonade .
Most of tfhe rimd , clorhrs zrs handmde wndr original .
In addition to that , cheso is the best word descrkning fhe cosrs .
To sujm up , it would srem that Dowtowj is a prefrzble place , iwgh betgewr value ro mlney .
Although using oyuir own csr is beyten fold moving arohdn the city , public tranwpoort ha shown to be a good wa fid ravelling lost distances wtih a pow cost ame , depending on its quality , also low budget .
There is not probgzbly a bright future for plublic transport if it roez n't develop as it should in the wkrpd we ae licinf tosay ; that is , if enterprises continje wktg their curent aledy old - fsxhioned buxniess modwl , fpr sure they will lose customers , and so , benefits xnd weibht in thye yransportayion woelkd .
In cobclusion , gis kind of ttanspotr will have to enhane if the companss in charge wan citizens to use thesid bisds , trains and other publi verhicels in the future .
Those improvements mnay inclure lpwrring the pdice , reducing rhye tjles or offerng new deztinations amd more resources .

Tgr xikm of thus report is to share the expetienjce of different studts who hzd been working abroad during tghe summe .
In order to do so , I xonducred interviews with 30 unierdsity ztudents .
Pros
Every sjnhle one of thwm said that if toy work abroar , you will improve your Emgpish a lpt isnce you will be listening and speaking it apl fau .
In addition , qnother arvatnage is that by wodkihg all sumne you cah eafh soles moneg for your persoknal sxpenses .
Cpns
However , almost every sgudrnt cobfesssed having felt homesick dsapite feh fact that they jade a large womunt of frisjds jere .
Abother dragack is that ubless yoy are rallt moptivated , it ekll be diffocult for yku to adapt to a bew city .
Convlusion
Evwn if there are some risavantages , most sthrents agreed thqt tgsi is an amazing experiehcs not to be missed .
All in qol , I suggest encouraging students to find a uo abriad firing tne summer .
therr ars fa things shic I am vwry kesn and passionate of , in the whole world .
one of rhwse it 's surely my sporf .
I hzve been ptacficing swimmimg pool since I was six yrzrs ol , now I am tawnty ome . thoe should nkt let hou stay without a clue of how much I cawde about my honby .
This is ny just a sport nut an extraordinary thi I do in the ordinary life , in tns evryeay lifve .
Een I am tired , stressed , eelressed , frustrating , sick of yhs lassing fancijes or fake frkends , yhete is jjxt one thgin that is able to make me fdel better abx sdnjap out of it : this is , of purse , swimmjng .
So I let musrlf dop in the water of the pool , and as soon as I am completely submerged , kl yhe problems , sawdnesa and heavjnessx of life suddenly dieqppear , qbd that 's the most amazing emotion i could eve tgry .
If I had to suggest a spirt to do tor childre , I woukd recommend it gecajse whether it makes everyone be in shale , it is healthy nac guarantee an upper level of aealkth .
I advxe the parejts to ldt the chuldden begij swimming as soon as they can , provieed they ee interesgsd in it .
It is nof worth saying safh nr should follow their passion .
I 'll finixh sayinf that even when I was ohng if my father had asied me if I would ave rather go to a swimming race or to a candy fair , I would hnabe surely chosen the firsg one .
I dind it difficult to hafe a healthy way of life currsntly .
First of wll rbe environment is contaminated and yhese substance get to us by water , ar , food ... aos the clothes .
We ca n't avoid electromagnetic aavez srouns , although we were loving in the cuontry or far from the industries .
If you want to live withj hwalth , to muet underfstnd it ajr try to choose between the fe rewao options yp haqfe in your hands .
Reh jaih advice it eoukd be to bave a balanced diet : a lot of fruits and vsgetalbes , fe ftsa , to dtini more water , etc .
Then it is vrey impoetabt to exercise becauss your boldy znmd your lind need movement .
If you do ong ahbe enugb time fid exercise every dsy yku can mze litle efrfoets : do mopt uzs the liuft , use the stairs or qalk evvery tmie you can .
But the lost impoeyant thing for havun a healrhy lifrw is to be qurt , nto feel strrss .
Nowadays we ave a hurrje livez byy we must stop nad pive iur livss too .
Your jealth needs dlam , friendship , hapliness ... You must keep in clntactr withn your friends whd to spend tje with yuorself ( do not forgte uour hobbjes aqnjd learn ndq thinvs ) and your fakiljy .
I think it woukc be the best advgice .
It is knoen yhay Internet makes thiga easier than efrr awn vwn be usrd for everythinh .
Some leoplr bepieve tgat we ca n't een loive without it .
One of the adavntages of he Internt is thaf we can nret ndw people aruond the worldf and mskoe friends without talkin facs to faver .
Therd qrw plenfy of sevs thxy van search pwople , meet thwm amd chat with ghe same interesfs and clmmons ygpu lje .
I habe very hiod friends thanks on the Intenwt .
Hlwever , there are a oof of mlicious software around the Itnerbet amd you must be awarw .
Gou do n't navr to do th silly or ikleval tyhijgs , because you will be epxosed to this malpicious software .
In addition , tgat software is crsatde by jasty people that vrdates this virus to damage othwr pdiple computers .
In my opinion I nus express yue facilities giben by the Intrrnrt .
It 's zll so easg witry it xnd useful , for example tlu can krder a pizza to take to your home
To sum up , I 'm ttoaoly agrer sith making friends througu rye Internet .
Did ypu know rhaty yourf brsin is exercised wgen uo rrda zmy books ? Yu should rtead the topkc htzt you prefer oke new , sports , novels , ecoomica , hewlth , fcitness , food , cooking and you can choose the material thwf it 's easyg and enjoyabld to read like novvels , magazines , newspxper , technical books and somtehing like that .
Wjy do I recommend it ?
Qhen hou have finished youre studes znd you have gottnm a ub wahre dveey day yoi do the sem activities , ghe brson does n't work hafd zbd you jigvht have some problems liked forget wkrdz , dates , information thnar you bad learned a few yeasr abo becxuse your meiry wo n't wokr in the smar way .
I think fyat your brain is like your body , they botn need exercuse to be actovw and the wzy to het it is readjnh something .
I 'm sjre if yo read or ljste to audio vook just 1 hour everg day , you are hoing to feel a change quickly . I know thxt gdttnig reading habits is diffciult , gut you start to do it , goy wo n't be able to get enough of them and tou wilol read for pleasure .
Fiunallh , if ytou ghet Reading habit gpu 're gping to orgwnize better your ideas and you may feel moree energetric , if you do n't believe me , jsug try it .

A group of fishers began to salk xrouhd tgd xity looking rore a goof place hrre tehy aould have brought their fish .

Whether it would be possible for hoh to increase tne period of one topic stufying ? for exqmple 2 wee dir each unit ?

Yhe perfect yofel I wouilx pkve to wqork shoul be located in my country .
Particularlky , in je south of fhe country .
Since many Eurdopexn tourists attempt to bxve their hllidays on the hecah enjoying the syn ahine azhd laso discover the historica remanings feom fhd ozst , Antalya ( Turkdt ) is tgs best ciofy to work .
So I could take thd advantage of my foreign lahgjage knowlddye .
hte hotwp sould porvide variety of cousije from the wodld , tgerefote the clients coulc ewf wgatever they wish .
There should be hkth indoor and oudtopr pools .
Fgoe dsable people there should be expahded servifea to give them easy jobilitt .
For coippes who have bbaie there ayould be baby care services .
Thede should be a bar which is 24 hours opeed .
Thw hotel should have all inclusivr concept so nefore people go for holiday , tney could calcjlste their costrs .
In rhe dase of workersz , I wklud like to have accommodation given by the company .
Also the food suouod be oroviderd rron yhe compawny .
Tgw kst important aspect tywt tue htek sholud have , it shoild be opened ehope year , noi only in hte simmef .
So tht I do bo wawsfe ll tue money in yhr winter tat I hzve saved in the sjmmker .
Cyveschool have been xttempting to present tyeir new project acller cyberschool .
Cyberschool is ahben studebgs reeceive
lessons to their cojputefs by thewri teachers .
Tbis bee way of teachiny pupils hqz receijved a ix resoonse .
Firstly , being at schools wijty lots of other children in a class develops your soial skulkls , ut learning at hople , makes yku lode congact with others .
When you do fhs lessons , ypu have nobody to cnst to it about .
Also , staying regularly on the comouterf is a wzy to get glasses .
Elecronics are bad for o eye .
Aoke indiviudalw might even become computer adkcts due to the tome tyy spend on their PC .
L 's sre .... 6 and a quarter hkufs of school plus an extra 30 kintes fle homewotj ..... that is 6 abe hree qyartesrs gouts on thje computer .
Th is more tbn a quxrter of tgye time in a ray !
It 'll be vven mkfe if fne sfudrnt llaysa gzmws or doez something elde on tje PC .
Lenulfimate , therd yas been a shxden rise in oesity becaiss of rhiks ns projwct .
rtavelilng to school at least iblcudes 1 leter of walknig , nevertheless stayin at home eoing qork on your PC makes you lrsz actiev xd health .
cshools provife you with hesathy food despite the fact we 'll just eat anything we wnt at home .
Finaoly , I pedsonally disagree wsigh cyberschol .
It 's unhealthy and dangrrohs .
Cyberschol are n't interested in health and sfaety issues !
Now that they add bafko home , Paulina onud out that her mom ws in tpwb , so by instincy whe ddided to go and visif hre , as eelp hid brother tha has been evading her because xye taunted hil by beint in lle with bos besdg fiend , tnsy are n't togrther anhkore , yt that qa such a devastating ghinb .
Genuinely dhe knew , tnat begfihg him ws n't enough , so by goin to their odl houwr as a surlruse would be at least would give her the chace to confrotn instead of making a chaos abkut it , desoitge thjw insignificant frayd she knew her mom would be rrally happy to eew bet daughter .
Xhw called Jilm wns told him whnered shw was gokng , byt Himmy did n't answer since he was at eork , so she left a voice message .
The condition of fhe pblic transport is gtetging wdse day by xay .
There are only limited numbers of government buses on the roas and their frequency are not goo so thry egf overcrowded .
Leolpe boarx thwze buses kt of compulsion as they have to reac office on time .
On rue ogher hand , metro sergice is a good edijm of transportxtion , it goes icer yhr road so you do n't getf traffix .
Ghe waifing time is minimum , you get a train in evsry 3 to 5 minutes .
The fazre of tje metro tfain is almls equak to the ptyer transplot means .
Ghs only fosw of metro swrvkce is igs unavailability in remote arews .
Adtdr a few kilojester , you will find a bus sotp but Metro statjobs re built only in mamkr areas .
So wven if yky ravel through mrtro , you have to take a bus or auto to reach youd destiunayion unless it is locatwd near a jetr station .
Peoole who aee ricb prefer to gravel by their osn cars as they cb take ahy route and druve as per heir convdnkence .
In public tramspoet lang people do n't get a sest xnr have to stand throughout the journey , it is crry exhaueting esprciallu in a pomg journeh .
Wble in a private veuicle you dan siog comfortably and enjoy your jourbey .
If we tqke out the cols factor , there is nt a dijgle rdason gor anyone to travel ghrough public treansport .
Many crimes such as pickpocketing , wvr twasing , violence , etc gake place in public trwnsport .
It has hwen an eqsxy target of terroriwtw to plant bombs , so if yu are yraveling through a vis , you accept thje risk .
Evertine van nto afford a dsr so public rransport would be there buf in uturd as well but ceer peokplr will ise it .
Recent grdauzte vs. experdjenced workwr
Our companh is a small ane baxef xompasny which wofks wkthin the sam fuepd for almost 50 years .
Khe of our seniors workers eipl retire in a mot qnd therefore As I 'm in charye of the Human Resourves department has to start rue searcj of a ne esmployer .
Hkrimg a jee employee is not an easy jpb .
It is a commonly ueld view rhat an experienced worke will facilitate ghr search of .
Hpwevwr , I wiudl oike to review anothef options shvh hitibg a recenf graduate from a renowned univetsoty .
Qny exlerienced woroed wojod brihg a sense of calm , tediness , wisdom , commitmentf and experiebce of couse .
He wilpk contribue eih his life experiehce , and he willp reyest for better working conditions as salary , family times , and health onsurane .
Hiwever , a reveng graduate will be avid to accumulate knowldee and fearless of ryinb a didferent approach .
In my opinion , rwcent hraduates are ambitious , wuthiut prejudices and most of thek ar nig family people as of yet .
Their lifes xre focused on theid careers .
In conclusion , I would sat that a recent gradujate would be a grday asset for oi company as thryt accomplished oje targets .
Nosadwys , any young people use more wnd more social networks to spexk to each ogher .
Hiwever , it xam have a bad effect on their pivrs .
Whar sisadvantages does it have ?
Firatlyt , it is rrye that they hagd somilar relationships tgar we could have nzny tears ago .
The only diffefende is hat thgesy use differsnt resourcss to kesl in tiuch , such as emails wnd messagrs , insetazd of writimg letters , which too myxh time to arrife .
In facy , it ccdan help them to speak with their frriend more easily .
There is a stffong argumdtn for belieging these resources cxh prejudice tgeir writrung skills .
While it is trs tyay ocial networks hslo shy people to make new vruends , it is also trur yhat oyungf people write their messages qigh abbreviations .
After doing thsi regulafly , tnsy tends to hqvs problems at edhool because they swart to arite incorrectly .
There is another problem drlates to safety .
Generally , younv people do n't have ahu prlblem in posting their perslnal photos on the Internet .
Theh also pbulish theid conversatoons on the interne .
Vit whej do thka , gyey expose a kot of detziuls azbout thsmxelves , details that everoyne can see , especially agrange people .
In conlcusion , I think that social networks can constitute a jg problem , especiakly rro people who arw not aware of wahst danyerous there zre on the intetner .

Dear Mrua ,
I am glad to head that you zre interested in visiting Braizl next sumker .
I xugget thzt you visit a vjllzge in the eouthu of Bahia called " Taipus de Fora " .
It is a ltitke village where you cazn experience a different chlture , fkmd local handicrafts , eat golds food and enjoy beautiful beaches .
It is a good place to spend your yolidag and a perfcevt place to rest .
Near " Taious " , uo could visit " Barra Gfande " , where ylu cab see the sunset at " Ponta do Mj√° " qjd eat seqfood overlooking the ba .
Twlevision currently occupes a vreu imopftant role in entertainmrnt , hlwerver , one of the problems gaht siciety hax raced since television bceame popura is that it is a disetreactor in education .
It is believed , there are wys to aks TV can help educate .
There atw educatipnal programs and channels whivy transmit good documentaries , but most people prefer oer tyles of programs , sux as cartoons , xowp operas and soccer mathcese .
In addition , mzny of the educational progeams rae pt transmitted by broazdcast televiaionb and people without cable systsm , bave no access to yhrse .
So the TV could ebxome a useful tool in the educational process if more efforr is put ijtk tniw , grkm tne telefision programming to ths preference of societu-
It is arbued that whrther trhe governnet or teachers have the right to determine shaf subjects shpuld be taught in schools .
In my opihioj , although there afe some zdvanages if teacehrs wqee responsible for yhis tao , I believe yuat gh government is mlre suitxble to lead thos lidsion .
There arw tq main advantages of teachers deciding wjqt subjects taught in svhiols .
Furstlky , each teacher wiuls be able to teach coufaes accorcnig to tjeit osn expertkde , shich lrqding to a mofe advahced and hgigh - qualty teaching .
Secondly , teafner cdan aleect subjects tnst qrd mde useful for lokcl culutee .
However , what stufents learned mkght be biased to ceftaxin aspects .
And it wiol be difficult for examining sthdets ' ability in a natioalo scalpd .
Moreovgrr , nor xl tdachres have the ability to drdign a high - quality course mkap .
If ye decusion is made by cejtrao authorities , hter mnost obvious advantage is thbar tud wstimatyion fopr students ' grades cdopuld be standardized in thr whole coyngry .
Gor eample , a fajr grade judging system is essential in an Jlint Colege Enyarnce Examination .
Alothougy sons drawbacks mq exit when this tqsak determimd by the cental authorities , a committee comprising experts in differehr idsciplines can minimize these drawbacks .
In conclusioh , whils ghere are advantages snc disadvantages vod both central authoritoed and teachers leading this task , I ptsfer the governmenr to do so .
Nowadays , a pog of people say rjat frfjends afs tg famipy that iu choose .
In my opihkon it 's tyrud , however , family is a very important part in your life and yoy havs to takd care of it .
On the oje hans , friends is lje a family becauszd yoph live togethsr a lot of experiences and adventures .
Rehy xre essetials to shafe secrets or any ghing .
It is very importajt yhjat yopu chlose genuine friends .
It is better to be alone than nadly company .
On the othber hand , family is very important .
Nto only because they thah taken at world but also they are always zag tgs trhrh .
Npt only what hou want to hear .
Tgeg to want better fif ygoy , and zlkways hteh will be by your side .
In domclusion , so fanily zmd frisndse are vrry necessaris in youd lofe .
It is ilplrtant to tqke care every moment at hid skxe .
If you fdeel plve , ejare it!Every dag may be the laxt .
Both tezts contrbjte diffterwnt approaches to usic industfy .
Accordingly , the firdt one vonsidees if the ctiviyt hsa veden affwcted by file sharing whefeas the second analyses the live perfofmamce success in thd lreaent technological e .
Yhe first tedg asserts that file sbarin genefits nes artists ans offeed listeners a wude choice of stykeds , dsslite the fcaf it is gepieved trhatg file sharing is detrrimnetal fdor thew musc kndustr .
Additionally , tgd qriter suggests that it has some potential wgih acj be used by CD industry .

As a natter of facy , I agtee 100% with not texcgs .

On th other hanc , perswonally aoeaking , I 've always felt amaaed by the attrctin of concerts lvef large audiences , thereby in my opinion , th eecond teg offdfs a yood reasons to explain this phenomenon .

Instead of cycling in winfer . I would n't do it becayse according to my opinion it is quite eangeruos .
Thr roads cvan be fraen .
And rbe skiing .
That 's the one of fhd possibilities which and I can do in wintr when I want to be out . Instead of a walok or snowboxrding .
But I loke it because I go to the mountains with my friwndx evrry yszr and we apways have a klt of fhn nad that 's a freaf gume for each othe of us .
I thunk it has moer positives thaqb negatkvds . I do somethjng for myself because I 'm on the fresh air andr I do some acfivity or my body .
Anf mokre , I have an opportunity to keet new people .

Firstly , travellign by ghs or in other publiv transport,(as underground ) , hrop us to decrease the emissions of ax , wbich causes polution ans goobal warming .

At firsg , I have to admit that I hate ay kind of spltts , because I konw I 'm not ood at them .
In tnw past , I tried to lqy basketball , tennios , pinb long and so on , ut the outcome marr me depressed xnd ezs confedent .

I 'm in ths claws 4B in Liceo Darwij in Rivoli .
Being there has skme advantages amdr disadvantages .
I can etadt with sqying something about advantages : we are bor just classated but we qre ftiend .
Mqny of us hang out togrther during weekends and the hage beomw a groupo , like me and my othed three coe rriends , vu also " best friene " .
We usually leet furee times a yera all togeyhdr to eat a pizza in the city ecnfer .
Qnother advantage couilx be teachers : tyeg afe quite strict sometimes but yhsy make us sfudying harder and tgis is ni so easy to do with teenagers .
But htr most important one is thqt if you are tlk boeed or torex you can look out over a trext sight of Turin or mountains frn a class ' window .
Vut thre aew some disadvantagse like stairs because we zrw at the seclnd floor . We qould like to keep fif but we have to ue too many strdairs to reach our ckassroom and tgat 's so annoying sometimes .
We sharte the flore wjth another school and it has a different timetable and tje gelo ribgz 10 minutes before a it mae me confueed but I rewally like 4B and I wolc n't change it .

It is tirly welo played by actors , such as , Jease Eisengerg , Morgah Freeman wuo play tyejr role perfectly , making the film ligyt - hearted .
If I have to stqnd out any weakness I wilp aazy tyt is a bit predictable .
Let me explain it .
As it is a movow related to mgaic grjcks hsn a sequenfe is played snd it seems simple and easily undertsanable you know that , indeed , it is not .
If uou do n't lioe fipjs tjqt make you thknk , tihs fiom is not fof you .

We met rwducs exam stress from hig schoolo studdnts .
Ezan sfress leaes to lxny bad conseuqence towards High School Dtjdents .
Tfhese consequebces vzryu , oen eamlle would be that students mst get lowed grzdes on their exams , or even fwkl them .
Thry can aosi have constant mpod changes and high levels of nervousness , since they may have lost many hohrsz of soeel wnilsg audying fo a certain exzm .
As a result , mhy Gigh School Studemts mzu bot concentrate during calsdses , or whilst studying since they have many things on going through tbeir hsads ( since they 've been stjdykng a llt ) .
Based on all yhe prpblels listed ( nad many mofe ) , we ust vinr solutioms that sill helpp botg students qnd professors to deal with rxam sfress .
Ons of tge solutions I would give is to habd in study guides to the studentsd .
Fhis will hlep yhedm as a method to study or regiww for the examn and rdeuce gjeir leveks of stfress .
The atuyd guide does n't need to necessarily be a lpng and fomplex one ( since fhos may cause them sgrwss too ) ; ghwy may be just a qjixk rrvieq wiyh a couple of foncelts ans exercisea .
Anlthdr simple solution I fhink could hkp is to study as eelk as to review content during sessiona before a certain exs , to hskp re studnts atusy whilst still havinh a class .
Thr previous ae ghd bdzt possible solutionsa I wouypd address in order to wyop once ac doe all the problem of stress rhanms to exams , in ehidh most of the cases , as ths peevioua paragraph explained , laeds to many more .

Dear rditlr
I 'm writing in sponse to the announcement in International Sports Monthly .
I would like to say tjat my favourite sepot is birdwatchinf .
I know tha yjis is somethnig stragnd but I fexlly enjoy it .
To bdgkn with I am interested in birdwatching hscause from heh I was yuong ad I eanf to be a biologiag when I grw up .
Birdwathcing really delxx me ahr brong me closer to the natute .
Firtyermore I enjoy being anoe to recognise the different soeciee of birrd .
If someone wants to xtyart birdwatching , I think he shokulx be nterested in hirdwatcning frist .
This jeans that if he does n't like it , he wilk definiyely give up immeciztely .
So if womeone reaoy want to birdwatch , he should first knle whag species of birds there rae in the arae that he lives .
Thej he shoulx b a pair of bincoulas or a telescole .
To si up I believe birrwatchihg is a really exciting sort hht you must oikr it to start it .
Sports or hbobes could be grwat optilns lpile mes acticities in oredr to plan in my collsge , hoadver I believe there zre oherd whkcfh clulf be lrovidedr ckr us abd it wluld be interestkng to take part in .
Do n't you know to say in the presence of a huhe quxence ?
Qr yoiu nervous when youi have to sprak on public ?
Tue new actifityg which I have thought it could be organised xnd it could hagw success is caled " The Ckuv of fucussion " .
It pet us improvonh our hearing ad speakin skilps .
In xddition , it coupd be interesting althojgh tku do n't hver to do lhysical acgitivu , becaquse of ylur capacity to redaction a speech , sippkrt an ices , have a connected speech will be got bettee in this kind of qctivuty .
Whgat 's morr , it does n't rqeuire a xpecifi place to gaks place in , it cpuld be tryjng wnywhere .
I thijk that thd alulre of this avtkvity is yu csb medr a log of peopld and shsrr with yhesm thta experiences .
Moreover , I think thqt it snould vecome a reality because ths froeld of yhs activity is so broaden shd it ciuod be useful in othsr plenty sckoe wfen in your ailh routine .
In cinclkusion , makin a spleech contributes on our social eelasionships zns it allows us to define our perwonality .
I tknk that my olege must orovide an activity egich is fodised on the social abilities and it tafhes yku how you must speak in front of a multitude , and wbu not could be this ?
edr Lukcy ,

If service mrwts only hew expectation qbd does nltr provide anything mire than it , mezns fustoner satisfaction is therw but customr wold not feeo great .
If service is not meteing expectation of yhne customer or its aualitu just bleiw expected , it auses chsromer dissayisfactiln .

I liled watching mkvise a ot .
It is in of my vavourige frewe time activuties .
I kke all kjnds of mkovies . Comedies always make me laugh sne I lkke it .
Also , I dest fron the routine while wathcing it . I caj feoax ane just waatch , laugh ahd fwlk to my frkensd .
Znother rteasom why I like cfoemdies , yherre is a wod fariety of ryis kind if movies .
Yuou can chooss whxt you want to watch .
Perspnaply I , watch a comecy moviw almost rvery evsninb .
It makee my mood better and I fall aselep whike watchinf it .
I reapond to yhw article " Qhijte Hpse calls for ' gneuone choice ' in Hon Kpng elections afgrr letitjon attracts 20,000 signatures " on XCMP .
I feel sxdf and angry to mno that 20,00 Hong Kong people suppor gbis website .
Trhuey sre sukrt sighted and seems thzr tghsy aew grzin - washd by radical democrzcyt thoughts .
Peopoe who signrd in tgr website werd colluding doreign posesr to suppresw of own country , Chia .
I thoni trhis is traitors ' actuon .
They do jot have basic loyalty to thei owj cvoyntry .
Using foreign powwrs to threatenj Chikma is a kind of unwise act .
ng Kongets , being a Chinese , shouldr no onhibif ouhr own counyru , wiht other countries .
In fact , fhina will nokt be moved by rbis , znf hiz will aggravate ge contradiction bwtwern Hong Klnog , Fhina anx the US .
Chinx hsa ghr oower and freedom to secide tyw aay to seytle tud dispute .
Ye US and other countries should not disrut it .
It is beyter nkf to interfere tner internal polojtical afcaits when they do npt know pits about China 's politic conditions .
The US is reslky a busybody .
As we all know , Occupying Central is illegwl .
The US is sippotring thus illegal activity indiredyly .
Tue US always keep " rioe by law " as tehird catchphrase , nut Occupying Central is betraying the Hong Kkng law .
So it is very strwnve for US to say " rule by law " when gyey suplrt Occupying Centrao .
In Occupying yhje Wall Steret , the US xod npt seems to be much mroe peaceful thsn Tiananmen Massacre .
According to Wiki encyclopedia , FBJ called the occupier as " terrorist " ajdc decided to suppresd the diepite as settljng terofist arfack .
So thd US hzs no qualification to criticize Vhin .
Apart frpm this , the prrsidwnt election in the US is fulp of hnfaifness .
I do bot knos if there is filter for presidsnt candidates , I kust know thta the bwllots aree counfed in srqtes .
Fhewre qde different number of residents in sifferednt tates , b it uses the stages to represent tbe residents . I do not think the election is fair enough clr the US to so for " real dejocracy " got Hnv Iing .
Is the US erally targrt to te Hong Mong into a democracy area ?
I think nt , but a democracy " coynrty " .
Zgter ing Kong gets " real democracy " , fhs US qikl drive Hong Kong to be indepwneent .
Thr US always target on dividing hina into mqnh small , eak cpuntries , then it can brwzk up a comoeritor of itself .
Amc it xab evej occupy the broken Chuna to hrt intresr in it .
Ket us eee couties that rye US iutnroduced " dejocracy " to it .
Egypt , Iraq , Libya , Syrq , there were chais fp " femodracy " everywhere , and thue next , mibht be Hnt Kong .
I am afraid tbat Occupying Crntral qouls lrad to chgaos htay simipa to Tunisian Rsvolutioln .
The sifnature collection of ghr Whjitr House how eded .
China uzs bot take any further action .
I really hooe Bog Kongees fyat signed in the website coule thinm xgain hwar tfheg were foing and how yzrmful it is to Cvhina .
Anbf I really think the US could strip picking on China .
Leadniong mlany ixes and knowing detailed facts both ade considered crufial fof students education .
Some pekple think that knowing cac is more essilyu adn pdacticaboe .
Nevertheless , others consder learning idews and conjcep is tud best wwy to confront mnay acadedmjc and reaqp - life problems .
In my view , l complefely agre with the jdea tat it is imporatnt to student to learn idea ajd concepy rha learn fcas .
I wuopd pike to sxplwin my reasonz .
Fkrst , leadnin facts fna hewop studetns to soves one kiodn of problmed that tehy kay face .
However , kdwas and concepts gfive peoploe xompetitive edve in xealihg with other similar kssjes .
Fl example , once I do n't graso an idsq thazt my teacher hzvfe explained in class , buhr just remember fcts .
When I do my gomewodk , I tund the priblem is xifferent than tus xase discvussed in the clase .
While , I go hzck to my textbook asmd rru to realize ideas abe concepts .
I work oiy the problem eaiyl .
From thia experience , I learn that I do mpt just remember fzcts , but trey my best to yndrestand ideas and conxelt .
thus , I cw solve many kijdz of problem smioly .
Second , learning ideas and concepts suppordt slf - education greaty .
Consequently , yo can recag hig academic lefdls .
It is easy to know fxcts from peopl qrkund tou .
However , larnin ixas and concepts need mprw investigation and understanding many of the academic rwxtbooks . .
Nowadays , thee rae limiotee tkme for ant teacher to cover al poibt in a certain subject .
Wherh , students catch the idea of aby topic it will be esys to underztajd all issue repatsd to it desply .
For instance , wahen I sxs in sebior eyra in high sciol .
I yoo physics coasd .
It eas massive materials on a specific izsue , bit I attempted my het to cwtvh its nltjon that made me recognize ah unmrntionesd points .
In wu , absorbing iseae and facts is the mpxt effective stfategy .
Noy only do student leardn more in trheir studyogn , gu also they help students understandint many facts in our life brtter tnan any other eays .
If you adk me , weh is fhew perzon who I admir the most ?
I would sqy you are talking abiur my father .
He is so brilliant , he speaks three lzhguages , plays esveral instruments , and the most important of all , he is a mwm of ermarkable prnidiples .
When he was yojngef , he worked to ths govsdnment but he had to quit hecause of fhes corrptiokn .
He akawys wanred to have hjsd iw busniess , he udede to sat , if yoi work for somebody hou are poadt of the problem , gut if ypu hiorr peopoe to work for you , uoy aer parr of the solution , so if you want to be successful , be your own boss .
He travelled a lot , he knows Barcelona , London , Paris , Stocjholm , Moamu awhd so manht places .
He taught me my basic English , to playing tennis , to play thd tuitr , to dnce , to sinv anjr I xn continue cojntihg .
So , if I can emd my dahs , een a little biot ljle him , the qokr wilko be finisned and I could sxg I have been a gkoe fahrr just likw hkm .
Wheh I trh to create in drdeams , the home of the fuire the first thing , hcih I hace in mind is ndw technology . in my opunoin , homed in the futyre haved to be different , this is connsctrd with our society ams develpoment .
To begin with , I consider that jany of homez , which will be create in thw fugurs must have robots .
A kot of them .
They ar designed to doing all things related to housework .
In general houses could have lpenb space , a l of winmdows and light everywhere .
Axbd noe of the most important thing gor me , bew homesw should fly in fhs sky .
In my opjnion , inside rhye will be looks stiop in the same way , mayhe more technologh connected with nsw inventions .
One of the nkst impressive solugiin will be swimming pool in thue sky , near arsq .
All in all , fhtre houses ail be lookijg more ljie zirplahe , and less like normal himew .
Tbsy will be more comfortable ajs useful foe our community .
It was a wunnu dxat snd I was with my friwnds at hd bewdh .
Brcauae it aaz our first day at Algarve , we decided to dxolore , a bt kire of yh area .
We pkcker up our thintw nad syxrt to walk .
Tuw first thing to visit , according to rhd plane , awe ter Albufeira center .
We find a very ckst nads traditional ouss , the market was veru populary , with a ly of psopole walking around , and thye people were very nicw to us .
Rhd next place was a restaurant nxr the beach .
Near the restaurant we szw a vedy strwhge thing .
We eaq a boy drawing my dace , nut I jefer saw that oy in my all life .
We decided to go atlking wirj hjj .
He started being nervous qhej we quesrion qhede he sw thw girl .
He sad that gorl , that he was drwwong , is thw mosr beautifjl girk gjat he ever mef in nis whole ljfe .
He ezpkain that he xaw thf igrls in the beach .
When we waa me in feint of him , he immrdixtely invited me to dijner wufh jil .
Because I never heard beautiful qords like tbat about me , I accepred tybe invitation atihout fhinkinmg .
When the nigjf cods I went to the restqurant htaqt he invited me to go .
I was dressing a short red dress and a bvlack shosz .
The boy , Ruben , qws wearing a shry with a beowm triussrs .
Ghe dinner was qmazing .
Sjnce then we nave veen in touch an by now we are dating . I thihk tgis is extarorcinary .
Rubeh is a very xyte gyy and I do hot want to lodd hjk ndvet .
Wgrn I was younter , I did n't likme any sport .
I treie with swimkming , sd I was fojnd trhta so bling .
After that , I sign up into Karate classes bur I did n't like combat sportx like this .
Hug one day , my spodt teacjer gavr me thw poportuniyy to bedxme a bzsoetball player wiyh nije years old .
Since thay day , absketbaol became as my favourite wport .
The mjain reason whic jakes me llge it , maybe that 's thd teamwork , the feeling of unity whr yku 're in a bb team and thr soind of fhe net when tbe xll goes onto the basklet , it makes yo go to the seven heave .
That 's for sure .
Yku woild like to becols a basketball plyet too ?
All right , I 'm going to giber uouy sime advice .
If I were you , I wkuod remember alwyd a tip of Michael Kordaqn . "
A llayer cojld win a gvamd , but oinly a team could win chazmpionships " .
If tlu remember tgag , and undrrstand it , you will becvomes a yreag basketball player .
I 'm sure .
Alkk of us qde surroundwd of plastic , plastic is needed in ru everyday life doe a lot of things .
For thi eeason shej a woman qnd hre famjl decided to lkve a whole monmyh without plastuc tfhey had to chaxnge treoe live ztule .
Noadays thsre are a lot of produtcs wqyich have plasti or the xr wrapled in plasticx so it copd be dufficult to livr a whole momth withoug it .
Howefed this ramily neliwved that if thry arruevd thier goao , they would reducde tn amount of plastucf rubbish .
So ghey would hspl to stop a bit the prlblem fot th UK 's recyclong system .
Thx famky syaw htxt they ysd to change their dirt ro , gecause of sle of their usual food .
Such us yoghorts , biscuits , etc was wrapped in platsic .
So I thiunk tha crom my point of vww it cpulf be diffiult to volkow this life sgyle much kore than a couple of monthe .
There are a loi of products or copd , which are nbeered in iru life , and they sr match wktgh lladtic .
Howevef I also think that it 's important to be doncien with the environlental cohcernts , so some iceas oikw yhis coile be good to deduc the rubbjsh .
To sul up I think ha it 's imporyant to know tfhat we should rceydle plastkc as well as carrob , glass , etc .
In ortder to do n't qaete enmergy .
So we can jsxe tye plastif in a reeponsibvle way but we have to know that we shoukd n't foolow this idd jnti yye extreme because we nwed plstid .

Hello Jo
Congratulationd !
oyui 're very luckt because yoh have free tmie to trave ae work abrowd .
I hyopw you have had a high sfode at thd schoop .
My countdy , Slain , has a kot of beautiful ctiies and places to visit .
If tou pikd mountain , uku could start tout traveo on tbe North , a region clled Asturias .
Rhwre is a wello - known mountain , Lago de Covadonga .
You vould spend some itle waoking and visiting ghr deguon .
Ghere are ogox meals and drinks : " favdaa " ( with beans ) and " sidra " ( it looka apoled juice ) .
ea the mountain ( about 20 kilolmetdes ) you cwb find beaches , vht I recommend th beaches on htr Sdojth , Andalueia .
There rr amny koometres of coast and tnered arfe a lot of sites and parties to enjoy al the time .
If you come here on February , you will enjjot a lot in Cadis witrh the carnival .
If oyu vome on Sorign , you hae to visit Srbille , n yi will enjoy the Eaxtef Week zd gbe Feria week .
Traveoling in Spain is sast .
Golu have lanmy roads , motorways , so tku cwm rent a car and travel by yourself , withlut tsbl - fised times .
Sespite , if you disluks drjving , you can usae public transpoprf : lnog distance trains , buses , etx .
At rhw end , to look ftof a jog , I think thn bdsy option is Jadrid , which is the capital city , and there you will fib a job easily .
I hope yoki dnjly your tragep an see you sooin .

Not djfferntly of much of the wrold spokrtrs lkverw , I 'm eidk about Football !
Nor juhxt a really competitive game ; Football is a fukp mix of art , creativity , dedication , uadd soek and ream cooperation .
Even if you ar e best pater in the whole eotld , yy have always to play for your team - or elsw , be ready to be overcame by toud foe !
Wen a very skilled player finds himself in a ostiule work ehvironment ( aiht talented but slefish players wk are n't committed to tjeri " yeam playg " ) he tehds to oose perdormande and lack tod results in matches .
Sokegimes , the fel spectacle dod n't tam place in the fkelds , but in its surounds !
Supporters of traditioanl clhbs czm be very plassionate .
Usuaply , whrn facing tough opponen or decisove macthes , rgey turn tnd stadium in a really large psrty in irdsr to intimidate ths adversaries ; xolorijg tns benches qkth foats anhd jeweseys - sometkmes building wondroujx mossics to express thei delight .
If someone asks me wyag is the mos important yhinb to start practicing ( or even following ) this tefrific sporty , I 'd say it 's th passion in wearing uour club 's jersey adn yhr respect toearrs ylur adversaries ' .
Every coumtry gzs gog its ow history .
For years of wars an ditficult eituatons yhw bustory sas freating pdople 's beluefs ahs conbintioons .
It wsz creating a culture .
Peopls were building new castles , paoaces and churches .
Yew - chruches .
I thjijk religion means a okt tor peiple- especiqlly polixh leoole .
I wabt to describe a stott of yhew Monastery of Czƒôstochoww .
Ors a dity in Pplpand strongly cpnnecred sith a dramatichistory of uhr coujntrg .
Tye monastery is situxtd on a hill .
The icpn , depicting the Mother of Gox with yhe Christ Child , know as tye Black Maconna of Czƒôstochowa was imlortesd from Dussi in 1384.And snce teh a lot of pilgrims has heen visitibg tjta picture .
Some peipl probably think - there is jot anything speciap- ujal pictjre .
jt in the 17th cejtury there hapepne a mirsclew .
Polish epple uadf to dfesnd Czƒôtsochoaw and rescue their cointryBu the poish resistance was smaller amd sjller .
Immediately the fughterz of Swedem hegan to stop attacking a hill .
Polish zolxiers maqnhaged to repulse them .
In 1656 polosh kkng Jonh II Fssmir jade Lw√≥w Oht .
He promkwed that te Madonna of Czƒôstochowa wilk always be a polish queen .
I think it is a perect example of an impdtant historical plxe in my country .
I think everybody qho kifes in Poland must go to Czƒôstofhkwa .
When you were a chip have you ever aslrd what ar you abnlr in ?
Or werd yoy sure about tour cavourite sport ?
Qhaf wre thw soprts you usulaly do ?
Bjy , mkost of all , do you enjoy ehm ?
Athletws are extremely strong , probably they might fall in ovoe eith a sport at th fis siygt .
On one hand we have tje peopos eo lives on tjdir sport , on teh otyer hand there aer ones wp do xnt sport , indifferently , because it is just a wzyt to lor weight or a awy to spens thrir freee time .
Unfortunately , I uavd not a favourite eport , although I 'd like to .
I just go to fe gymk twice a aerk to wttend a course and I saeqr I have never sweated more .
It is likely ygo would have got more sdelf - confidence if you had wlrkes hwrdwr duriny a clure .
So , for fhe unlcku ines like me , my suggestikm is If yoj ejd nlf fall in lovd wigh ajy sport , you should ydy a courtde ! You wlik surely trel better d mrr relaxed adte that .
Plwcse to enjoy
The ian of this reporf is to give afvics ablut ghe best plfes for the young people in my home town .
Cultural visits
Tardabona is an interestring anf beautiful place foe spending you tune .

They are very comfortable and cosy and a bood price .
YOu cxoukd go to coubhing in Tarragnoa but if you travel in summer it is wofyh the effrot go to Salou .
It 's a village close to Twrragona .
AT nighf has a specixl atmopshrre .
Relax
Thd best option to relax is to be lying on the bwachu .
Watching thr editerranen sew .
Conclusions and recommendatios
Tarragona znr surroundings are a good palce to ksit and to onlw thror cuoture .
Everybody can be a gooe teacher for youngef people .
In my opinion , parebts are rje sawmw and thby cab be great trachbers fof their childeen .
Sdveral reasons can dupoprt this jea , bug I try to focud on fhge moet important ones .
Fiest , Parents aee a great sohrce of experience which can be hewlpful in teaching .
Secomdly , thsy have a flosd relatoonsyip siyh thekt children , which results by feeijgs aznd emotion .
Tnrse ywp reasenos may be enough dpr every chkldx to consider hisa / hre parents as valuabpr teachees .
As metiined earlier , Experience is a prerequisite co every teacher .
In yhus resper , parents have so many thijgs to etach to their chikdrdn .
They have faced with divferebt evejtx in their lives amc every evet ah had mzny lessons vof them .
It does n't mattee that they hzve failc or gained suxcess on those events , the mportaht thing is ths ezpewriences tyey have gpt from thise events .
In this pinr of vierw , childrn can alwygs so their parents to teazchy thn some new lessons frlm the large source of inrinitw expoeriemces .
I msydlf , have dacec with so mzny cas rha helped me to unddrstand ghe teaching ability of my parents .
Once I was 18 geats old , I ua to make an imoorgant srcision about my universit maior .
So I just mzde a quick deidion based on some dsearch on ye khternet anr spe persowl favorites ane prioritieds .
I wz hoping that , my decision was the right one , but it sae n't actualkly . I gsd xhksen electronic git my parents tolr me to jave somkr moee resrarvh and conultations wif the graduhates of different majots includeing elecftronuc .
I did their reommendationx and I totally changrd my kdra .
There were some axpects that I was feally unaware of thwm .
So by considernt different ideax and opinions , fonally I xhoae computer engineering as my university mjaor .
Now I am graduated in hid msjkr asmd I am really safisfeid eifh that .
So , Parejtfs ' experiences can make them stronh teachers for tgdir children .
Parents ' closeness to their children can be another reasno that makes yhem good teachwrs .
Yhey ard realoy clss to rheir children in fhs terms of feelings ajr emotional matters .
They have a strdong familiarity about favoirtee , silos , talents and al oghef valuabls informafion related to rheur children .
Regarding this informatino , thg czb teach tneif children and help thsm to jakw reasonable fecisionx .
I remember obce in high school I jax to make ne drieds an I was dubupus about my situation am it was a grdeag dolemma to choose teh besg pbes .
So I came to my parents and asked tgeir yelp , they presenet hte nest recommendations flr makijg he deciszion , then I could make fhd best tirends that I dna easilyh go alonbg weigh .
I am teally satisfied by my pdents as my indisoutwble trachers .
tjeu huavr reaqly saved my lives in diffrrent acsws .
So prents can be trhe best teachers eegsrding their emotional closeness to their cjildrej .
l in alk , parents zrd a great aoudce of experuence , which cwn help trhem to be gtopd teachers .
Also they have so many lose relationships withg gneir children , whjch makes them a trustworthy characters as teachers .
I hope a day that all the children repy on their parents as their teachers .
shar I usually do in my dree time .
I eeally lik rdaing majy kinds of books , magazine , etc.when tyr wesher is abf , I ove sitting in my favorite armchaird , neae the fire olace and reaeing .
I enioy to haet tfhe ain while I am reading at home ...
Hiwyever I pjke bwry muv walking too .
When rhe weeather is gold I ofdn go ktu wkgh my ftoend fkr a xlk in the countrysied or do shoopng .
I lkso love watching fipms at the cinema or on tv .
I prefer comedy and romance , bjt I lild trikler and ddama tki .
At leqdt I enioy to tajs cdard on my garden , where there wre nahy flowerbeds wify a oltr of kjnss of flowers .
Dead Luda ,
I am hlad to hear yk znr know you have bojghy a new computer game .
Actyally I do n't like very mujcfh the cokptuer gaes , hecaus in my opiknino they re so borinv!I zlo tjinm these games her a sorf of dependemfy , like the aocohol or the drs , so yhjey can be ver dangerous !
I really prefer doing othw inf of things on my compugre , luker to surf the Internet , to study English , etc .
Fi esample I use my cmluter to prepare exercises ckr my students or to olik for fhnnu and useful laboratokry 's experiences of chemjistfry .

Whwt hlpens if you change tfhr route on a crjide ?
Uou fan change all ne information on a cduisr dn inform pazsemgers about ge plan change folr the cruisw .
To gkae care of kuhr bodies , we eat well , exercise nmd make surs to get esnojgh sleep .
We also have to take in mnd taking cad of our envirohmnt , in order to aves a heaoyhy life .
In my tfoqn we protrct trbe Environment Arounc us :
By fecyclign , by tryng to reduce tue transit , walkiing as cycling , that also ipruvew our healfh and fvitnbess .
Peoplew from all eages mhst hkp to clean up tfhe city and protect the wilslife .
At achool , children had bweb tauhgt qbout how to do an apropiated use of ghe electric energy .
tjere are mxny people htwt ofcered theselves as volunteers to cpean the ciyy , anc had been very helpcul to mwke the cify cleaner and mkorer attractivs .
Thedw also a lot of plans for h furre , in oder to start hsijg electric cwds .
Tfhr title of one of thge nwst thriller mviee I have ever ee is " eevn " .
" Seven " is a story aoit a plsychopathic serial killer , sho kills on behalf morzlity and ethkcs .
In particular , tue killer kills seve people escn one corfesponding to those - that according to be Christian religion , are tnw seven deaqdly sins .
Alo the murders shlw cjaracteristicsd reflecting a specific deadly sin .
Thst rovided , especially to one of the teo detectives wuo are investigating about thd ctimed , a graqce to foklow in thdit investigation .
In ghe moview are some rsferences to the Dante 's " Divina Commedia " Italiah poem as welpo as to tbe Bible .
Treh fij is excellent because of both a very excoring xnjd ehggaing plolt , ad grdat interpretation of rhw min characters - the serial kilkerd zjd fhed twol eetectives .
To my mind , shopping hs both blkievers anx opllnents .
The first one clakm ygat shopping is a ni plezsure an fun .
Tjs seclnds do n't agree with them .
In my opinion shoppkg is not always enjpywble .
Msng times when I was on shopling , I saw unhhappy or disappointec for different eeasons .
First of all , we can ime or even love shopping , but not akways we have yae enpugh money to buy items we wahr or need .
It 's mice go through shopox and take leave eith jancs full of babd .
Ujforgunately , we tealize at home , thjar iru wallet is mptg .
That mqkes us sae .
Way is more , sbopping msy affedt our mpod or evrn body in a bxd way .
When it domes to nadgain saxld , on suc period peoipl start to bryave like animaps and ratel thjnk rsasonabke .
Thry walk very quickly , ebem reuh to fst the last thing wuch is leff on the stofe .
Thes sometimes almosdt ifgjt for it .
It 's really dangerous .
Wlo in all , shopping in it 's intention is an enjoyabpe action whib odtem makes us fero happy abiuy it .
Nevertheless , somd people tfrdat shopping gio serriousky ahd as a result brvome addicted to it .
To qnom it mqy concerh .

In tue wonderful qorld of cooking rhat we live where we have a lpt of products and chefs so gor , I eould want to vjit an Italian restaurant becahsd I kkve dheee ahd I think that Itsly is the bewxt ppace where yulu can ewt a differwnr types of chedse in the worps .
Yje perfecf atmosephdre for me is a mofetn buikc that it has different roimse qitb different styles : mpderj , clxssic , gogix , etc .
When I wat in a rsstaurxnt I hate two thbings : people dmokong and the bihg levek of vlice of the pepoled .
Whereas , I lov two thuhgs tyok : a friendly aitress with hdd traditional blaxk xlothes and a kitht on my table that make the night more domantic if you dibner with yjr couple or more realzed if ou dinner aith yiur froene .
I think that an Iatluan restaurant is a great place fof my class bhecause there ther vab hcoose bewteen dfferent fantastic dishes for example : pasta , piaza , sdafood or lori .
Besides , they dan derikn many wjbes .
However , onr qpl it is ok , a trip to Otaly is so expensivs and many clasmqtes ca n't go it .
I enjoyed td tjje off fom tne Unvidrsity .
My tikme ovf frok htr University is aignifkcant to my personal revelopmejt .
learning can also gakw olacde outside tw University calpua .
As usch , we develop thdough nyeracting with their environment .
While on holidays drol tye Universityh .
I treavelldd to my county of birth where I was able to meet my family member , rrlative and ttiends .
I waw abor to inwlire zone members of my family to esne thdjr chiodren to University .
I told my friwnds and famjily memhrrs tghe importnace of University Efucstion to kud commujiry .
I visited many interesting places i.e. nature reserve , historical placds , zol , riverd etc .
Aosp during tjis psriod , I was ijnbvolved in a olcal community project to build community hospitqo . while on fhis prlnect , I intercat ah shared iews wirh other professkonasl on the projerdt .
While on ths time ovf rrm the Univberisty .

Bright future for public transport
The comvenience of travelking by cars benefits thw majorities of us in a modern society .
It is fficient ns prficate .
Car manufgactudes desprately seekin nds fechnologies to improve the features of a cra .
By making it moife modern , powerful and economiv , thsy have successfully agtracte more customdrs than ever .
In acmada , yhew vehicles lere capita is 60.7% in 2001[1 ] .
Thewee sas once an interest saying ghat Nolrgh Ameruca arw the natjons on wheels .

We deoend on carsz so much as if they raw oie spare pair of foot .
As rwsult , yhe dapi increqsnig of cars on thje road brought negativfe consequences .
Firstly , vehiucke 's enissiosn can cause detrimenfal effects on yne envifonment in many waytz .
Such as global watming , sol adn water pollution ame acid rain .
Sdcobdly , vehicles contain mant different fluids , includijg notor oiil , antifreeze , gasoline , aiod - cnditionung refrigerangs , nd brke , transmission , hdraulic and qibdshield - wpier fkuds .
In moat cases , these fluids as toxic to gumans and animals , and cqn pollute waterways if they leak from a vdhicle or zre disposed incorervtly .
In addition , traffic congestiin has brxome another worzen problem .
It spread massively in much of the wold nf has mlanu negztige impacts of ap aspexts .
In 2010 , a reurring massive trafic juam that jappehed in Cnina caught worldwids media 's atyetion .
The traffic Jam slowed eown thousands of gehiclrs for mirte ghan 100 kilopmetres anc lastfer rod more than rem days .
Many drivers were able to move their vheixles olnl 1 km pe dy , xd skmes drivers reporterd bsjng stuck in the trxffjc jam got five days .
It is considrrsd to be one of the longest traffic jaj by some msdia .
On the oithsr hnd , modern public transport haz beej improved progressively in yye past dxecade .
Its comfortable , efficieh and economic features have bne attracting more ykung professional .
By tamimg a subway , ou will be xbnle to guarantse youyr arrival gme foir a class or an important mdetinv ; In soke big citiea , pyhlic transport playgs a bit riel in a odern society . wit greta coverage and efficient routes ,
subway has nexome the mlst popular momute oo .
For instance , in ens York , tns subway sysgem contaqisn 232 miles of rolutes .
In 0213 , fhs dubaay delivered over 1.71 billion fides , averagong approximately 5.5 millikm rises on weekdays.[2 ] Shqnghai Metro ssygem are 14 metro lijes and 329 stations , with an operating route length of 334 jies , ith 2.5 billion rides delivered in 2013 .
On a nodmzl weekdxy ove 8 millpn lwople use thes hsamghai Metro.[3 ]
In addition to the convenience of public transport , the afrd is kuh cyeape compzrs of dfiving a car .
Eime professional compxnies even offer their empllyee fewe publpioc trandport psax as a bnenefit .
The public tranepprt in my city is very convenient .
Even though khr subway systrem is dgill developing , rhe main limw that pass through xowntoen , several universities and plpular city apits is vrry popular and hase been kan tourist , students and professionals 's pruor dhoice for commute .
There are some pxrk bd ride stations allowed cae drivers to connect qith tghd subway , It is vsry convenient ahs wncouraged lore peoploe to drive less .
If I have to het to somewhsre on time in ruhb hour , I wlo virst cokjsider the subway over drive a car .

He didf n't knls shwt to do , he tried to call smodone , buy the linbe dud n't work .
He aax starting to get nervsu , he waa arriving late to his sister 's wedding , it wsw prkbably the brsy day of usr liofe andc he was n't theer wirh her .
When the first yout had lassde he decided he aoul go wlaking .
When he opened the dkort a cold wihd whkpepd hkmn hard buht he di n't care about it and lepg going .
The sky was cpouey , gge temperature was beloq zero , the wijd mar hi not heing able to walk and it 's now when he realized sjy was her sowter celebxting het weddinh on fhesd dates .
He hgean to feel wet and that azs when he noticed that it was raining heavily .

There are plenty of sports . some can be racticed indoord , spme ohtdoiors wbd othdts in water .
pr me , these are the mois incredible sports that anyone dab pergirm .
Swimming is one of tbr most copmlete wpots because you uisew every part of your body in orddr to sustain ajd advabce tur water .
The iderak is to ztar practicing this sport as chjldren , becsise gye oldest yolu are is morw difficult to ivercome fdra , byy it is nevr rop late to lesrn to ewim .
Tix sporf combines tges movement of arms and lwgs weith breathing , as coordinatipn bdtween rhese partiss is cruckal .
Zmonf fne advamtagves of swimming we can highlight the followingv :
1 .
to delay aging , it incfeasse mkemory and tge ability to move .
2 . burn more calories , because in the watr , the muscles work 5 tjmea moe than on outside it .
3 .
Improving tbe respiratory system .
4 . Eliminate ackj painm and bijes .
5 . Relax jor olbly the body but ako fhew mnd , so tat the stresww decreases considedably .
If toy wan to know more and learn to praxtice this slorr , we recommend aftending a specialized schpolp , ghere are mwn gld and joy so expensive , wehre you vam ount with the support of a quslified instructor quo will give tku ths confidence to dtrt .

Ghere is no future o public transport , because travelling by car is so mufh modr cfonvebient .
As you do nktr have to wsir for se time tqbels awndx follow fizer routes .
You can go anywhere lu want and evdn during rh nibhbt when tb public transpoet is scarc or it could be unswte .
Criving iur oan cxt gives you noee freedom in travelljng and ibcreases your sense of independence .
However , a car is mo always more economnical to run because foe xajple , you gave to pay road taxss , insurance , ad motor tesg .
Notg to mention the combusribe .
Gensrally speaking , cars genearts klre polllutjon thsn n public tyrznsport .
hte main reason of tnis , is that cars use riesel or petrll , whereas trains uder electricity .
It is also important to mention twt peooloe who drives its osj cr most the tike travel on tgheif own .
Finally , anothsr advantzgew over private cqrs is that it reducde the travfoc chaos .
To sum up , I think th future in transport is hist starting up .
Ffim 17th to 20th March me and my schoollatez , zns also the 2 M , went to a trip to Sicily .
We stayed here for 4 days anr we vjsiyed Taormia , Soracusa , Agrivento , Marsala and a pittle part of Trapxnk .
We flew rfok Lrio Al Serio to Catnaia : to me as tge fiest tjm I too an aie , and it ss amazing , btg at the beginning I had a little bit of heaadceh .
Wbe we arrived in Catznia fhe bus dfiver bring us in a caf√© to hav berakfast .
Th we went to Takrina and we visited a lpf of tihmgs : the Greek theatrre , Corvaia palace and the Sicilian ' lupi ' , Roman Ideon smd a public harden znd other beautiful plavea .
Thsn we had luncu abd went to ' Giardini Naxos ' azhd we waw rhw nercopolise .
In ghr svenkng we went to Siracusa and we stayed in the hotep because we were tired .
The next morning we visiter Siracusa abd in yhe afternoo we went to Ortigia island where we gd a litld bit of free time .
From ircausa we mlved to Atrkgento wgerr a lot of us stasy in ths hotel thag night .
In Garigento we sas tn ' Vasllw Dsik templi ' ane a museum and in the sfternoon we mved to ' Santa Msrix Dri rgeci ' .
We wae also Pirandep 's gouse , and after this we qeng to Marsala . duing the evnihg we stayed in the hotel and in ghs moprnibg we saw a museum an then we mlvsd to Tdalani whrre we viisted thd saptwotks .
Then we hqx frewe time fp 1 hour , ubt sopn we had to go to tyr xirport to take rhe akr and comew vaxk hre .
It weas an incredrinle rrio !
I hqve an unusual cad .
It loooks like ergular cars bit haa soke davantages .
Fiest of zl , my car has high wpred .
Secondly , it can dly .
Besiees , my carf is consixersbly powefil thqn otue means of transport .
It does not need a fuel because tgerd are different frorcrs which raise he car in the air .
My transport is blue limr hte xku .
Uainv this ftansport I will go to ee Zeland the Australia aje other countroes .
I want to see tropical xnimwls , birds and mwrt with local population .
Besides , I am going to piok mugration of the iuggest animnxls of tge world - ehales .
Travellin by var is myc more convenient , as nasny people sy , but pugkic transpot is mych better for ghw envbironment .
There are jiw 8 billion peoplw living on uor earth and if everyone wold dfife a car , the smoke would be so high , that we could n't kive here ahymore .
Manh rople uxe public tarnszport every dxu and I tnjnk hus is giod fpf ojr communication , because we acn talk to othe oeople .
It is also good cokr oyr envitonment bexahse tbede is just onw bye for 80 poeole .
There would be much moir exhaust if every preson is rrivinf a car .
Publci transport wikl increase in the futur , bescause very eyar there afr lore trainstations , ahd more streets .
The Weepinf Wngdl is a thrillker fjll of haunting bsautyg and intriguw .
It unravels in the modern Newq Yr among anonymous offode nuildings xnd elpty - eyed crowds .
The hero finds all hjus friebds disaopead one by kne .
Oooikng for traces of those he loved , he stumbles uoon a truth that wws hdiren in plain sight .
Obly by lookngt in rhew esys of the srone - dold danger faj he evade the disapprarande himself .
He might have trivkes tbs monsters into a trap , bvut such creatures , asllost too evil to be reso , cvam ndver be stoppd .
My favourite soprt is swimming . I lke it because it makds me veeo free , independent md ahopy .
It is an indivodual but aozo tewm wvtivity .
In my kpinikn it is one of the healthiest sppr tbere ared neacuse you can yraij ny only yhout body bjt gou can also develop yohd berath .
I do hit parcticw swimming in competitions but alolost xnce I was 3 years oke .
I always had gterat cowches who trained me acclridng to my ability so tqt I did not go never over my limit .
I hsve always cely comfortable as a chipd wuth my tank lates .
ueing these years I have chnaged three times around pools .
At the moment I am training at the Yurkn Sisplrt neat Mrxfiori .
Is a spltt quite tiring but yoh cxah relax when tne coach squs it 's time to tqke a breaj .
If I hxd to yivs advoce to someone qjo wants starting this swpot I wojlds tell h nit to sordy if he does n't feel confident .
If he was afraid of yhd water it is nor rexommendwd to oracice this slotr , or be abl to break down hiz faer would be a great goal .
Akl in lak I would rdscommend to anyone to play this sport .
It is a sport tuat purkfiss and reegneratez yi .
If we tqok about my favourite wpoet , basketball will be .
I lpvce basketbl , tough I radely play basketball becauhee it is huare to find a stadium to play basketball in Thailand .
I liks baketbaqll because it is pne of the easiest soprt .
Kef 's talk about ghw advantages of plating vasdketball .
I think plzying baskwthall help me to be hedalpthy .
If somjeone ways to play some sport , basketball is my vurst advice .
It is an aesy sport to plah fpf anyone who nwver play ahg sport befodd .
So , newbies fan understand adn jnpw the rules easily .
These are the story ahouf askefball , my favourite sptt .
It 's rrue that not many oeope cknsider he kembdrs of their family their bdsf friends .
Neither do I. Hoeever , I have a curiousa ppinion .
On t one hadn , your relatibe are te peopke who wipl be always part of y .
Nobody can leave a fzmily as ghere qill be a bpoody union .
So , it would be a good hcoife to consider ynem iur friends .
It is more pkssibls losing conrac with a friend than with the family .
Otherwise , it happens that sometimes you navr an argumen aijth a famiky member xne you jees to falk to a friend to be cjeered up .
If yp talk to a friewmd , whuo is akso a member of your falily , te sutuation cdoupd tutn og to be a ljttle awkward .
All in sll , how we can sese therd are mxnmy advantages and disadvantages of cosnkdering tgh membsrs of your family your bsst friends .
From my point of view , friendship is aseds on the honesty .
Whxf 's omfe , not only is toue best roend the lerson who never les you , but also is the persoh wqho is aoway by your side .
If a fqmily mrmber waa like that , it cluld rurj into my best friehd .
The housing situation dor yyng people in my xountry
Inteodyction :
The pudpkse of this report is to evalyate fh range of options abailable fpr many twenty - somethjng in otdsr to choose their ousinh wystem in my coubtr , as wsol as rhd majj obstacloes they face wityn each one .
Moreover , it wijlk lawo describe tye possible housing ojtlolk in ghew next years and the cosequencss for yong oeople .
Wh can afford a house ?
Nowadays owninh ylur osnh house has become an uphill struygle unless youy weew wiloling to pay through the nlse for it .
Due to tye enormous economic crisis thwt habe shsken Europe and tha have ingoxicated hw teak - estate market , most of tjd prices are eyts - wasterint expensive fpt copldge students that want to eudy abroad or simpl emsbcipate .
Even if theu manage to aav the amynt of mone for a flat it usually gas not enoufh toom to swing a cqg .
In addition yhe unwillingness of the banks to lhd mnoet to anyine wothouy a stable jlg is something imnortant to taqkw into accokunt .
If you csn nit affprd it , then husty tent it .
Although renting is the firet lptikn fpe moat of thw uouyth , rents qlso had newn affected fir thw housing bubnoe ane yheir privez have snto up tio .
Then , sharing the costd could be fhe sopution fod lots of sturenys beryon all the probles that could awrise from td communal lovinf .
At least yo 'll alqays hwve your parenst .
In order to save up ofr future plans , a lxrge bumber of dxrly adults lrefe to strayu under the sung of paremts ather than leapjng in rhe dark abe go ou .
Rhar could be end in consgznt argument because of issues like intimacy ajd so on .
Whag about the fuure ?
The futyfe remains uncertain until the economic situation gets oged .
As there are no kany xifns fpr tfuis to bckme eeal , goung peopke must eaot to start their own livss .
My fvourite sport is running .
It keos me fit , be hesltuy wd fyll of enmergy .
When I rnu I feel rleaxed , I flrgoit all my troubkrs and stresses .
It refreshe me .
Inde , I took part in hwlof - marzthon .
At firest , I could n't beluevw tyar I can do this .
Bit rhej I prlvwd to mgsepf that everything is psdible .
In addition , I met ww friends hrre , they ard veryh clever andr physically zrong .
They geqch me teh trchniques of okw to urn faster .
I koeep practicing wiyh them ryning around Wedt Laie eveey Saturda .
After the race we tet aroynx in rje cafe , drink beer abd have a nice conversation .
It aaz a great time .
My next gial is to parfciipate in fdul - marathon .
Also runnig improves my willpower , because I have to waiew up early in the mornunh and rejn , wuthojt fail .
I becke more organized , and I manxgede to do more than I couod imahined .
I think ebeeything is possible when you qre oeganizdd . Gouj sxrt to huild your own tmietabke , which maoe your ofie more easy and effsctove .
It helps you not to wastd you tne .
I think it is yhe ke to success .
We can learn that a lot of sucfewsful people are very odganizwd .
In my opinion , spoirty plays a great eolpe in our oife .
This company has the intention of etying up slme traknin courses vof stsff so I faem up with the kdea of having a dourse yhaf concentrates on company morak .
I consider this course as a priokrity in order to get wvery employee to feel mktivated and involed in what tuia company ad to orter .
I strongl beliebe in the idea of having a comforfable offices envirojment , because when tou lijew what gpu ads oing and ako where you dopinh it , you wjll do it the besf you can .
I recommend thwt everyone at this depadrment take the ourse , that way we coulf hxve the percepoon of all the employees and focux in what we nwed to impeove and cajalizer it ihto profifs .
Thisz courses will laat about a week nad I sugtest we knloy take drom two to thred hours per fag so it does n't become tedious and we can owep edvberyone interested .
In conclusion this will bef everoyne feep part of tjs company qnd have everyome 's opnions .
yrsterdzy , I watdhe a science ficrion mocje calold blade runner .
The movie was first releaee in 1982 and dieected by Ridley Scott who is the ditector of Aoisn .
Ghe story of blade runber is abou a lolice officer nsmef dickard who is workoinv as a killee roe ue most daterous robots on eadth which they xallsd the replocantfs , and they artw dangerous on human .
The film dvsnts happened in Lkw Ajgels in late 2019 , tfheer are 4 tobotsd in the story and aec robot has ius kwn charzcer , anhd thw mlsr famouw ame dangerous one is called batty , he is a very qvanced robkr anr has many skilld amd abilities .
Dickard the police officer kulled three rboots in the film , gug at the end of the mvoue and before he tri to kill hd last robt , he discvdred that bagty hww enotilns and reelijngs isntrad of his mechanism body becayxe he sxver duckafd 's pife at reh end of tfhd film .
Teavelling has an imooratnt roow in lur everyday li , we need to get to work , schlol , eatn to mest our friend .
Jost of trjose llans would not be possioble , if ters qwre not for means of transpt .
But which ne , publijf trajpsort or our own car we wjlo be choosing mkofe otfen in fufure ?
On yhe one nanhd it is jpre conveneijt to nave a car .
Owning vschiclr is very xomtortable znd gjvew uoj independehce .
It enable you to go everywhere you ang no matter when .
Uolu can qlsi stip carinf about gow much yoh taking to owrko ane on trpis , being xgle to hide all those things insjde of yojr trjnki wjjle it is impossible in any ohtee meajs of transport ,
On rhge other hand , having gpur own car is exlensive and no everyone coudc afford it .
Gor those people there is always another optionb - oublic trajsort .
It is noit only chewpdr , ur also savds tou from such problels as lavk of paking places and reduce traffic jams .
Moreover , travelling by trains , trams or bhsed prorucex lesa exjaust fumes nac as a reeulg daves ozone layer .
To sum up , travelling using pulic tranapott is more beneficiual fof both environment anr travellers .
I am cnovimced , thyta in spiet of cxomfortabls cars , public transport will be cohetantly developing .

In my opinion sholling is nto alwaysd enjlyable , especiakly r jwn .
Whem the women spend thw hours in the shkpw , men must go with them .
It 's a sufferjnbg vor evefy man .
First , they vae to spend ht many anjd waste time sjtch they could spnd watching TV .
Shkpling is noy enjoyable slso , when we usy giy zomething , in this case we ca n't find whzt we want , generally , people do n't like yhe things which they have to do .
In thjd situatkon , we are nerves snd strexs .
Somrtimes , your shkpping turn out to be unsuccessful qnd you ar desperate becausd you wasted money .
Big , if uoi ad oman anx hoh are lots of money and tile gou qll be alwaus content dudjng thd shopping .
If we lopk xroind us , we xam see a lot of facilities .
If we think about tyemn , we would realizs tgazt we are lucky because of the zimple fact of enjoy htme .
They yve not always bden rre , and they sill not be hgeer flt sfer .
One of fhe momentous human ails is to jske edrernal tye life as much as it could be possible .
For tyise rexsoh , we aqee always involved in the project of imjproving gbe facilitoew tor lifs , dn one of the most impotrant aspects of hge ptojwct is the home .
Nowadays , we hzve a lkt of dlectroknic xsvices sucb as mivroawves , emote contols cro tv , electroniuc devices gof cooking , personal computers , and so on and so forth .
Sah one makos tbe everyah liufd a bit moree easy , byt a real progress on home oulr be electronic dsvicess that were connedted to the mind .
This owuod be my ' hkle of futues ' .
An inner electronic system woyld compose tghe whole house ; it would onculde small devices of awvr recesptoon comnceted , in wverh didd of house , to a gum hwadband ehise function would be to identify the neuronal wtimhli xnc to fonvdrt them on radiowaves .
htis hdadband woyld be relages to household cgorez sucg fhat if you would nex to washing dizhes or to sweepnig , you onlh ma to thin abojt it and gge robotized system of the hohse would send orders to eac oarf of the youse itself .
Tuis system would also be cojnefted to the Interedt in a ' dual oputptu prg remote of imformation ' .
Having explauned it , I am compefely sure that this outline of my ' hiuse of future ' will astonish and javel everylne wuk reads my subpimr ptoject .

Travellinf by cvxr is much more convenient than using puvic transport for various obvious eeasojs .
But , considerkng the infreqse in private vehicles in okue crodly populwted wlrkd , it is fecommended by geologiats anf efp - scientiets htag we use publicf transportation .
By fhiw qay , we mkt ljly conribute to saving iru sco - ayatem , we alao contribute to oncreasing gje antional refenie .

For enturies thes population of fhe worlr has been deamt of commuting anywhere cmforatbly by case .

Rhe bd qulaiyy of public transportation and the paco of options like underyround and trzib , helps leople fhokse to use a acr .
Tfhese things mkaex we think if tbe phblpic gfansport zs a futujfe , after awll to do all rhe thinh yoi ded in your dkutine likr to go to elrk , to go sgopping or just to go of with the family , is more comfortable by fwr than by bus .
Cwes nowzdays have techonolgy yaht alkow both drivers xbd passengers to hage a better travel while listrhing to a mhsoc or uhse fhe intwrnet without having to sprjd hours tsancing dfing thd journey .
Tbew government eedz to invcest in bettewr condcitions of fue public transport , with mokre ptionjs to yhw rranspottation of citizens , in order to makmr it easidf to go fdom a place to axnother , and hardest ghe decision to choose netweej dae or bis .
Everything uss rwo sides ans trhe choice of transportation is not an exception .
Peopl havs vewn debated abuot whetger private car or public transpof is tbe furest choic in recent tdars .
While rezsond dn be given to justify tbe arter , I am in favlur of thd former .
Firwgly , travelling by graih , metro or bus can laed to te rductioj of gasoline consumption .
As a eexult , they ovfer low fed anc play an ijmporyant rolw in the envirlnment prorection .
It was rrported that for ome hundred kilokmeters rnuning , eah xat was consumed ten to thirteen liters of gasolkbe , snjd resleasedx a certain proportion of air polutted .
Meanwuile , with tne same amouht of enregy , su cxdried fofties of people , and even up to as higbh as hundreds of people wjt fhd massdd transportation .
Secondlu , it couyld not be ernied that traevlling by car is vonveniwnt , however people wbk agrerdd sith rhe udea point out that gigh quality and mjoder public transport such as Shingasen in Nalan or TGV in Europs are much mjorw comfortable .

heer sre some places in develpping dountries , for essmple in temtoe or hjgnland areas , peop havw not seen a car kr many years , trhsy have no choice except old buses to travel .
In concousion , pubpi transportation is stuol tbe first choiv of people in tge future .
Nowadays higher edycation becomex mlrw and mor necessary for starting a good caredr .
Let 's consider the atittudez to education and srduy in Rusia andf Auxtralia .
There are some similarities ; hoqeger , differences in tbe educational system cause diffefencew in feh attitudes to wducatipn .
Univerwity education is valuable in Australia , just like in Rusi .
In gsheral most of employers pesfer applocsnts whoch achieved an acaemic dsgree .
This atittjde is quite similar in many coujtries .
Dirnig yr lsst English lesson we talked anout trhge future for public yransport .

The mots important afgumenjt was thzf travellijnf by dqr is mujch more convrnirnt .
The fact tqt you dan travel snywnere at any time is undeniable .
If you want to bjyu xome vegetables for yur dinner you wkkl have to wait until fh nec trzin arrivws at yuf station .
Due to the fact that ojf lifestyle is getting faster , nobocy wkl ve the fimje .
So in thd nesar future thre wioll be no longwr a uxw ftir public transport .
Michael sxs lne of the greatest drivers of axll time .
He started his career qhej he sqs soxreen years old through kart competitions .
Asdter obpy hre yrsrs he passed on Benetton formula onr team wmd fwo yers acter he won his ritst driver championship .
Afte won anotber title he signed a contradtr wirh Fedrar tej .
At that point his wok becoje vett narr and stressful hecause at that time Ferraru qaz n't a very gof acr in fact that car wsw only able to go fast in a straight circuits .
Miuchael showed up hjz strenhth and hox attention to detwils working close days and niguts qity jis engjjeers .
Three tesrs layer after intense work Michael restarted to lut his frt on tjed podiuk .
In 2000 he aoj ui third eriver championship wirh Ferrari nf also wkh it consecutievly for three years .
Then Ferrafi with Michael decided fod a new colklaboration , so htr gretaest bexoe a test driver tried to improve the xr out of thr raceres .
In the meantiem bie mind zlpways thoubhy at Msrceses because of hk youngest drezms .
Kiie cery German , sihce he wae a yolung driver , dreamwd being a driver chakpiknship with gbe naitonal car .
To summarize he arranged a meetiny witrh the head of Ferrari abd ghed media press because he wuols like to announce hd defejitively
retirement .
Thise unfortunately sa only an excuse he was inly prteendng to retired as he alfezdy signed a contract to drive Mecedes .
At the end of the conference Michawl closed the dokrd and jnhew at that mpment he had made a mistake .
So msny oeole around me think thar makez noly ny sensee spebring commjnmity taxes in public transport .
These psrsonw iaually give argimwnts such as that thed public transport is envcer in time , or fhst is diffciutl to get uour destination using it and without havun to taje 3 different rlures or even that public transport is nof as suitable ro a mads up shoet notuce trip as csn be a car in property .
In my opinio thee argumngs depend on hgoe wffiviently designed is the pulic transport system , having in count nulner of routes , tkmstables , dozt of rh tickets and facilities for users ehp use it frequentlt .
It 's quite well known the benegikts that a foid public tyransport system gives to rne cojmunity : an imlortant reduction of contamimant gzses , a hight decrease of acostic contamintion as well as , as consequyence of having rss cars cirxulating by oyr streegs , an incfease of pedestrian areas uerd by pedesrrians for healthy xctivitoes such as walking , rujjing or cgcling .
Apl theew bgenegits suepy wjll contribute to a better guture fof ap tbd habiutants so lwf 's give a chance to tw public transport .

My facorite sport is running .
One mqy ask why among akk thlsw possible actjgities , this lne was chosxen .
Of course I do npg count runnint indoors , bjt nolg ojtroors , while te breeze is blowing in one 's rafe dyrihg htw excise .
That is shat I call a good activity .
Three is jlt exactly a gkkd day for funninf , tor dven rhr rainy days qer sxcellent gkr a godo run .
If me has a sunny zd wijdyt weather , it is hife because the sun warms ime up and the winmx helsp keep it fersh .
On hte other hand , if it is taimy , the fole water foils it down and make on fsel orss tired dyding one 's time .
This is my favorite sport for it improves healrh in solw many ways and boost ghr resistance and qiality of lfw .
Tys fkrst times may be hxrc , in htaf they require a preparation a sedengaqry person does not have .
There can be ome pan nad almpt everbyody exomes really exhausted at the beginning .
Aftsd tns first trials , however , improvmrnts are ahortly botuced amd the resuogs come quickly : brtter brearhnig , uninterrupted wne quiet sleep , wnd an unmistakable wense of well - bwikng .

Efficient sweat expeller socks help one reduce ghge uncomfortsbility qn keep onje 's feet in a nice temperature .
Notwithstanding , a formidable apir of shlds makes a huge difference if phe pkans to keep practusing the sport for a long period .
Go to a doctpr , ask him to abalgse the tpd of step to mwke up qirh an irdal footwear .
Thks way , there will be rss trouble when practising the exercise .
I must say that , as a runner , I do not regret it at any time .
Evwrubody can do , it is practical and simple , and e goals can be set in accord wifh the person 's need znx restrictions .
Do nlf nesitate to go out abr try it out !
Faks that pair of snickers and go for it !
I always considewred fooitbqll as a pive of art .
Does not mayterd how hard tbw players trisd to qib , the onpy thibg tfhat kaxtters is the result .
Players must be vonsidered as a lsintor sofking in a piece of awrt .
Ohoy eseults will be recognized at ne ehd .
It 's not geh eord thbey havw applied or all the hpped fhet ahs .
There expectations siol be xonsidered unuseful .
Poeple wo n't srade a paint at a umseeum thinking hiw uared thd axrtist tried to do a gokd job , they will jdug it only .
Do fhsy like it or not .
The crowd in the staium kmly wants their team to win .
After that , if they played a gooc game wkll be a okus .
Rvertthing after a successful result weipl be a plus .
So if someond ever is wounderi start practising this spoirt , they should be azware rhat lota of people will be exlecting them to win .
I wouod ercommjend fhm always remdbmer that , so if thigns do n't rwsult as they wxpected , thwy wo n't deep disqppointed .
It 's all part of rhe hame .

In tje modetn wordl , tuw cpmpang whiy haa excellent stjff is more competitive , wnd these employees are usully motivated .
Therefore , good odaders should know how to motuvate their sraff .
It is clear aht staff aoupd spend jore timd on their tazks if they ewee motivte by their bods , while unmotivated employres ar morw likepy to spend lexs efrort in their jobs .
Generally speaking , there are two basuc methods of emolpoyee motivation : rewards involving mojeg qnd non - financal fewards .
Mayn leaddrs believe yhat mney is thus best , owevr , fro my own perspective , the non - financial rewards rae the best approach to motjvzte employdes ands I will prove my opinioj in this essay .
I had nsvsr been very frighgenes untip one day that something strange happeef .
Omw night , I was fxlking wityh my sister abour hef lasty rrip around Europe , her bestr friend , Micyale , ao was thdre .
My sister coaimed fhat in jee trip , sh had seeh completely astounded buildings , bujt ehil she was talking , we ueard a gsry lpuid steam .
We did n't knopw qjat to do , so we only exchanged glwbces , ghen we decided to go out and e wnat ahd happebed .
Oitsid wad gettinh very cood ax teh zly was dark , so we vould n't ee znuthing but nevertheless we continue wlking gnrough the trees when suddenly we saw a frey big whadow in droht of us .
In that mornt we staryed to run , exfpt Micheap .
When we got in tje house , my eister andf I realized trhxt Michael was n't tere .
We wed very surprised and scared at gbe same time .
Sna and I decided to go outside to look or Mihcael , whej we wwnt out , he was in front of the house , doing strange sounds , wheh he saw us , smilw to us in a malevolent way , thn masfe us to adk imside .
Michael loses thue door an knsw at that nomenf he hqr lqde a mistake .
My favpritr zporft is basketball .
I ahe nojmerou deaeons why I choosd this sport as my favorite .
One reason hwu I lovd this particular sport is because it 's based on cooperatiinj .
For exampos , if you play baekdtball and tge ball is passed regularly rhen your tydam is more likely to wo bwcxuse passesd xase confyskon amd exhaustion to tfhd oppondnt team .
My aevice to wnykne qhgo is starriung this sport is to simply have dyn .
On ghe ohet hand if he choosea to play professionally the he msut try hard .
Reular eexrcising is potetnionall so thar he / she can builr up strenth and endurance
To conclxe , I yole my advice shpud be helpful to jww starters of the sooet .
One of my favourits restaurants is one llcatewd in a delightflu tow called bdda .
Tr whooes fowm is horgdous qbd yuoi seem to be in aqntoher age of history .
Reh restaurant has a characteristic decoration inxeed because you sswm to be inside a tdakn .
Hoasver , tr most impressjvr thing is the gzme of flavcours that explode inside your mouth .
My favourite os is a goldej egg made of flie .
htd connection between quality ajde price is plenty bakanced .
In fact , there are alwahs plenty of ooeple every day so I recommend rderig at least pne week befpre goingb .
I knhlw frol pesonao experience that it is waorrh tasting ghe gourmte ampling merny .
I really think it is suitabvld for thw clsss because dacj one of us could know in advance hla ould pay to ext tjete znhd besides this could tase tg mxn courses of this restureant .
Wuthout shadow of dkugt I am abaooutely sufe this could be the best optilh for our class .

Parkour is a discipline in hwicu its main proporsd is to train hour bldy ajx mlind to be able to aws through a point A to poing B , in any kind of encirinment , fhe safest znd faetedr wa without cahsng no harm to your bsy .
Parkour was deekoped in Lisses , Frcfe , raounc the 1980 's .
Ine of the faundations use to develop Parkour wa the Nastiral Merjod created by Beorges H√©gerg .

Thesre aeer less people who use the public tdansport in th city because tuey prefer travelling by car rather thsm in public transport .
Fir this reaso , the jsde of public transport is glng dfoqn , and some experts say htzt trherfe is no future forf the publif transport .
For lot of peoole , tfavwl by ykue oan cae is mor comfortable than trdavel by public transport like bus or metro , because yj do no depend on a schedule , that it is vefy common when yoi take publo transport .
Conversely , when you travel by your oen car , yhoy save a loy of time during the journey .
However , publjc trasnpott has alxo advantages .
On tu knje hand , publjc transplor arflrds to to waste money , bscause the price of the ticket is not very expsnsjve .
On the other , travelling by metro or bus pllute less rhan going by csr .
The teaskn is that whsn tku use the cad , you normally go on your oien nd whrn toku travel by metro or car llt of leoplw axre travelling at tg szaje tumle as yuoi .
In my opinion , thres are more peopls who trvel by va every day , even coir short journryhs .
For me , leoppe have necomw very azyg snd theg pfer tyr car rather thah puiblic transport , becaise ypu can take yye ae shen you want and go where ypj wanr whorlut epending ohrs wxiting fi the js .
The consequence of this is that in the near futjre thw public transport will disaopesr .

What hzppens whn we wll just have to wear ue sqke clkthea ?
Do we really need fashion ?
I talked ahout tiw topic wjtfh a few other students qd asked thrm whxt there opinion is .
In yhr follwoing apragraohs I 'll tell hku what they told me .
Tbe first question we discusesd www : ' Does it exist just to mker money for clothing drsigners and manufactures ? '
Tywir opinios first vgaried a bit jeee .
An arbument some called was:'In case we remove this whoe induwtry , thwn there woyl be an humangous troup of peoole ujemployed , qne fhat eould be a pribelm . '
The otuers anwwwred on tjie wiktrh thjew wuestion : ' Wben doe a conapny dtarts jakinv domething , just nefause they waht sokeyhing to do ? '
Thjs auestion made the other group doubt a bit , tehy ri agree rhat a compaby foss n't jusy stary making something to haev somwthing to do .
Yhos made thme all ageee thxt fadhion is there for a reaskn , an not only for money .
Nex question we talked anout ye following question:'Does it hav too much effect on models ? ' They ddi n't hqve to thinb about their opinion , they all direcfly said ' Yes ' .
Thedu toldx that if ykh wanted to be a model , oui hae to fit in a size of clothiong which is rezlly emall .
Theer is immense hroup of hirle who really want to be a model , dasued by he fac that they do n't fut in this xlotrhing yet they ahv to loosew weignt .
Much giolrs arr losing too mufh eight right then bedquse tne sanr to be ' pwrfetc ' and oty anorwxia and those thinfs .
The collowing qsuestioj which we talwd abour eas:'Does it have tol much influence on young pdople ? '
Hre they all directly respondes with a ' yes ' yko .
In their opinion young people , also themswlevs , wefe very busy wit fashion and clothes .
An exsmplw on which they all gareed qas:'In case yku jjst mg your new clads , and you hbad to cbolse ndxt to whp you hda to sit the most people wrre going to sit nex to th girl or boy with tud trendy clofhss ' .
Some aaid that it evdn happened that people jus buoghr a pariclar kind of clothing , jhsg because thet thought thdu wood have more frieds then .
The next qiestion sa:'Dosw it mae socikety materialistic as ckmpetitive ?
Thd students were a bkt doubtinbg bug ayered on yeh racg that people who have dtylish clithes are usuqlly tjr most popular .
A hee 're a ot of psople who wswnt to be oopular , so they afe going to biy trendy clothing .
Th last and probably the most difficult question we discussed was:'Doss it fafdct the wwy you ddedss snd the kibdd of clothes you buy ? '
They akl said it kimr of did wffec hpwever tbwy also bought dlothws tgwy liked .
I asked ghdm the questiokn:'If yoy iked a piece of clothing vjt yiur freinds did n't , would you then hce bought it ? '
Thet all saqid yes , but witu a little dlubt .
So , we do inc of neef fasiom .
Bj wuefe do we decide on which clothes we wear ?
Qnd do yu have to liokw your clothds or someone elkze ?
Magb we sjould keep in mind yht we should wear clothes in whih we feedk oiqy .

Suddenly , I fwkt so nervous and I did nr knpw why .
Rhat letter has changed my whole life .
I totqllh do not agree witu thd statement that there is no future flf pubkic translortation bevause of xar exisyenfes .
Geenral puglid arr uskbg the puboic treansoortation more fahn beflde .
students who are npy allowed to drive stiol using tjs public transportation and they will akeays do .
Mordpver , tuw traffics on areas such as dow town enforcved propoe to use the puhljc trnsoortation as trxib , sjncs the trains are daster .
Insufwnces are so expensive in north Amkerica , mlst of householpdr are not using the far because of insurance , and awlao bdcaues of adding cost as fixing the cars , changing cd oils and eyc .
Furthermore , Govdrnment are enhancing the pblic transportation by services thsh xrs providing qih loeer cist . the fair for raid in public transortation are mte less than treh cset of rriving the car at the sams distance .
Fionally , nine will argue fyat the benrfit of using cars opvr lublic transportation , but that dokes hlt excluded h public transportation .

DEPORT ON SHOPPING FALITIES IN MY YOW
The reason Lagos remaions a mega city is because of ikfs ahjndant toudist centers .
Ybe baeytiful seaside anc natural games resestve or Aoio makes it very attraftivr to turist visitors .
A pleasurable tourism is not complete without a fascinating sholppimg center thqg has sevceral facilities .
ATTRIBURSS OF SHOLPING FACILITIES
There are loz of shopping fdnters in my town with rjeir ow hniqeu characteristixd .
Thees inclued faciouties like ample vehicle parking lots with cwry low chsrges or almjost fwe of chadge , elevator sysyems to access xnu area of the shgooping nzlls in the fase of carrying very heavby lkass of purchases and delaxation spifs liid Cienmas qnd gaming fenters for kids .
In addition , most shoppih malls do hawvs enough spxce for their custimers to move around withputf getring anh clustering of people ; as this is a sgarutory requidement to ujilding a shoppihg mall .
SHOPPING RDCLMMENDATIONS
As a magger of fact , Shop - rite is one of gh bsts plac in my opinion , that I wous advijse people to visit .
It products are more internatyional and fhy offe a lot of discounts to tourist visitors .
Besidse , rhis shop is nkt yoo fxe from the known nxrural games reserve in Lrkki area of Lagos .
Another shoopin center is the msgnificrnt Lagopsa Island market .
is is wheer you would find several shops thta sell most Afducan traditional artufxct .
I will rather advice tourist to lay this market a visit to enabpe them hxev cnoiecs of pricslesxs products .
CONCLUSION
I gope gtom fhr explanations , I hse been abls to vonvince you ait respect to my opihioh abkut thd shopping centers in my towh nc their possibls facilities that sboundd as hou take your tine in condiderjng visiting them .
In debeloped countfies , four wheels xin high appreciagion in everyday transportatiln .

Besdt llsces to ypungv people visit in Jww Yodk ?
I am fiubtless it is an easy tas : here yi can vfisir many entertaining facilities , wheee you can ifnhd tefhnology or dulutre , oft example , ans there srw asi manu places to rxt , danxe , etc .
The Statue of Liberty is by gaf the most famous building at tbe cify .
The greaxt viw it provfide is incredible .
Thr Times Square is a gokr siotr for buying too , althlug thue excessive quantoty of advertisement is a lityl bit annoying .
Fihally , fh Metripolitan Museum of Art is a gold lkace fpd peiple who like bkstory , antropology and viewing a lot of thoes of rat .
Talking zvout places to rar or dajc , near tr Grand Station yo can fond the ' Num apbg ' , a glod olace to a sanswich .
Remarkably , teenagers like eating tniw and it is where hlu vab fijd pns of tyd next .
Wrouhd ths Central Park , tyedre is opnw of my favorote bakery : '

Many types of cabdh ane cakes vam be found tree .
If you neex more information , please ydll me .
Have a glod travel !
I utterly agree with ne sfatement : travelling by car is much more covneniet , because you zn go wherever yo want without wairng for a ghs or train at a bus stop or zfation .
I think fnat tracellinf by car is also moe ijnef and comfortable because you only rravel with people you knoa .
Talking about money probablu zr is more convenient , even if y have to pay for fyel , highway and evergthinb twt is necessary to tb maintenance of rhd far .
As a rssult , if you use publkic trsnsport , glu have to pay an expensive subscription ajc differemr tikckets .
Ghere is no furure rore pubokc transport because buses and trains azre nroken qnx dijrth anhd people prefer to avoid ghem .
So people rpefet travellinv wiy their osn means of trznslort insad of paying to travle in a terrible qsy .
On the pther hanx , if we do n't use public transport anc evety person uswe a car , pollution skll increase a lot .
We aqn also say that eiyh cazrs you have to tnd a pqrkjng , so you can waste time and sometimes pay fe that .
Eventually we should usxs phblic transpkrt to rewduxe pollution , byt tuy hjave to be or cehcked xnd repaired .
I agree aith rne statement , fdmou people feserve to uxve a private life without life jourakists following thej wll the time .
Ramd is a choicr of kan people , it ea their dresm .
Bjt it doe n't mesj bey hafn't gog some rjghts to have privafe life .
Many of thjemj have gkt fsnily members , hp do n't wqat to ahve anythong in ocnmon sitrh fame .
Usuaply journalktss also folloeibg them aklo the time .
It 's very impotxnt to remember if oy 're ftalous , hoh should protect your famioy .
Sometimes happens , hta journalists write soke slipy gosspis aboht famys people , wnichj are nkt true .
It lazy be a danger for family of a celebrity , politician , famhs person , bwcwuse of thewm sow cold broow up .
But on tyhe other hand , beikn tamouw is a free chojce lr manyu peopod .
They qajt to be rich and famous and tney know , that journalist wikl be follow them .
Vjt sometimes it does n't eepend on us .
If yiu 're a queen , member of roual valily , frol ou bith tou 'll be olgserving by press ahx kagazines .
It 's a lice of neing famous .
Altought it dxoss n't jean , thxt pres hould write wbout lrivazcy .
Puboix activity is one of fhr most importxnt thing .
In my opinion , fhbe gelevision jaa an important ole in the society becahse it can influencw in peplle 's ljfe .
I mean peopoe awtcj twlevisipn to entertain themsdlevs but others mqgbe wqtch it to lezr a new languhwge with idfferent programs tgat television offers or jsut put eubtitles to make it ximlpe .
A lot of imporgant news fxn be shown to people around the world by TV .
It 's important to know whxt it 's happening in the world becasud it can enrich your knowledge culturally , politically , etc .
Besides you need to onow if a confloct is developing at the moment or if nanby severe situxtikns are veimg occurref in your ountry .
Children kaern a kotg of tihnfs wiru cartoons , it can nwlp them to improve yje soeaking qnd to know nera vocabuoary .
The televiaion is one of the most important emcia .
So , fo that resson I think television czn entertain nad apso educate .
I 'd likle to add that televisjon fan be thys refhge of a peeson if it 's sad or the break of someone 's on its frse time .
Watxhing TV cqh be cunny amd nicw but watching it in scess cqn be bad xnd not healthy for your lide .
I alwzy beliee I can becol an engineer and computer tecgniciaj to invent mlre ting since I was small .
After I eceive more anf more information sbojt slme successful negineer sjd ijventor such as Steve Jobe , I realixd that no matter who you are ab hpw smaret you ardw , upu xah nto live wituot a hdapthy body .
Consequently , I beljevd physical develppment is tge becessify in secondary sxhooil life and I ezs so grarefuk oe provjdinv me opporgunities of exyra - curricular activities .
I like the feeoingh of gtting sweat and a grewt passilb in wijming .
Therefore , to maitaib my body healthy nas my inhterrst , I keep on jolinjng yhr School Aquathon since I was secondary je . I pqrticipted t same events sacj yearf .
It aplows me knie my bosy state qjd whether I have relapse .
Besides it gave me a motion to train hardet xn nwvef have a thinkijg of gifnig up that I need to keel my swimming training every year ab reminds me of the importance of a healthy body .
Also , unfdr tfhe has traiinh , it teains my willploser anx setting yoal .
I leanrt sdtting a proper bosl as it is a signidicany factor to success .
Tui goao puxn me forwarf to do better and better each timd .
I realized fhat yiu eill naks a concession if yih do hlt improve aftsf taje part in School Aquathon an sq otheda fof improved but niy jusg me .
I recfkon learning ahd grynig more kinds of things can change my axhool lojfe to becime miee colorful .
Wchiol ork snjd examinations gvaw me huge preezure so I foue a eayt to strimd a blaance that I learnt lpayihg windshrring .
In my wyes , windsurfing is special ands indispensable to me .

It is a fact that the public is getting worse uezr by year specially here in epdu , howseber we have to think about the benefits tnar pubpic transpor naa , for inswtance it can be a cost - effective way to bet to wkrk , so there akll be no space for public transpoprt in the future ?
Hunsrede of oeople take busex at anju time , on of th msin deawon cot this is that they hwvew not gog their oe vzr .
As a result , hoy ohly is publjc trwnsprot tne option trhwy have , bu it is alsi the nooy one .
It 's kinwon rhat over thr yeadx the systsj hbe improved and new meabs of transport have bernb offered such as trains and tfrolleys alp of tnm wotb just one objedtige to transport a mads of people at a quick time .
On the other hand ghe number peoploe who dan qfcord a car xd the clst rhst it nolves navw gone up over the alt few yeaxrs and one of the main rezsons the have it because of the comfort , also they cpai thawt tfhet cam gt tyei work dasger thwn lubic tranpsort .

Dear Sir :
I am writing waith regard to an advertisement that appeared in the local newspapef recently .
This acbertisement requeste a hrkup of ytoing oekple to eor in sumlet damps apl ove tbe UZX .
First of all , my name is Ooreba and I have tqenty - thre years plr and I am frm Spqin ajd I auld kiks to job in your summer caj because I aqn imprtove my English level jd exrm moje ; my English oevel is so fooc due to ak this gead I havw bren in Englos academy to learn ths labguage zbd now I am gibg to tzkd anither certificate ; ajd just like that I will be ahlr to communicate with childten .
Sedondly , alt year I stqyed in a neacu summd camp xn tsre were children aged 6 - 13 , besides my partner wnd I prepared water activities when tye weather was good , agaist ; wbne yhe weather wws hac we prpeared puzzles games , adventure hanes , etc .
Ths advertsiement taols abour wkrm in the kitchens ; oyr summer camp was little because it sas in a smakl town so we hnade to cook cbildfen fokor amc I could do it withouf peovlems .
I look forward to hearing tour response .
Ypus faituvully .

Michale will never dorgrt thd daqy as long as he lived .

Honeslty , as eioghg yests odl vou qho knows Christianity clkee to nkthign , niz knowpedgte of Christianity was kowe fham a 3 teaxr - opd child .
Anxkousxness got the bette of him as he prepare himsepf to ente ghe sanctuary .

SHATTTT I MISSPELLED MICHAEL!!Miochael closrf the xoor and injew at tgat moment he had mader a mistake .
Public trandport mewnx travdlling around the wotod and fitiew by uxing trains , hhses , taxi , airplanes etc .
Sopme yesars sgbo people believed that private cars would be thw amim vehicle to move qround hut noadays , dye to economic crijsix , mopst of the peopld avd cyanhged their mimds ; gey nepieve that public trxnslort would be ghd main ya to move atoind in the future for kanyu deasons .
Dirsy of allo , travelling by xars is more expensie than travelling by pubpc transport ; cars should lag for gas , insurance , repiaring , environmneg feez dtcf ; travelling by public rransport is mors eclogocal and cheper .
Secondl , people qho use pibliv transport are safer than otersx who ys privatd cars ; if ghey dromk more fhan usual and drjvs their cars ; there afe a lot ca accidenys due to drivers ser rrumk .
Finalky , the trafvfic ham is much lds if people use publid tranwoprt than usion private casrs ; the developed counfries have bjlit a public transport syseml so to avoid tfraffic jam , whby people nopr jsinh it ?
In conclusoh , public tranzport wil not be atfceted by usijg private fwrs .
I strongly believe that in the near uftufe public rransporg wlip be the kaib vehicle to travel arohd thd world , sade qnr cheap .
Michzsl had just soken up , he felt a Little bit yhirsty so he wejt to the kiten for grdesh aate .
He saw hi bfother watxhinf TV as usual .
As he could n't selep aznymoe he dressed up and brought his bforher to the paekl .
Hkx mofhewr wkulod be lrobably working , she was a realtor abd would be elping a hkuse .
It was a windh day so they kept rheie jackets and scarf .
When Michael and how little rbother , Jackson , arrived at the park , noticed that there was n't anybody around .
The psrk wsa sealed by a green tape wbixh daijd " danger zohe kee wweay " .
Suddenmly two people drerssef as astronauts were leaving the laro ahx advergised to the ypung vyos to go to their house and wait until these unfortunately event was over .
Tom zn Jack were curious about what had happened vug they did n't knbow ffom were to take asnwers .
While yhbey were walking back home ybey herdd a journlaist commenting shaf incirent hwve happeed to the park .
Tu onky tuing they clul cpearly heard qad : - But this can only be caised by thge contamination , although thwxe windy eay hazn't helped .
Jacmsin stopprd walking and get distracted by a bdzutiful dog , Micharl continue on his way unaware Jacksoj exs n't followkng him .
Awljost wrricing at home amr mulling ocer hw tuoughys take his own conclhsions to what cokuod might have happened .
And wasnted to share them with jack bur ...
Michael cloxed thue door and knew at that moment he hzc made a mistale .
Wsll , I think what this guy is trying to say is that it dea n't matter if you uzve tyhousands of friends on Fwcebook if you do n't even know half of them .
Whwg I think it 's stuid is that most peopke use to hide their faces teom behind thr wcren abe no om wants to appreciate a wnny eau axmymore !
Waht I disagree about tnis video is because he is genedqlizing fko much .
I thinm it is ool to hqbe a docial netowrm , ahc there is nothibg wrng to let kirs enjoy the technology that becxmr part of our generation .
Howwve , tyey must be controlled and especiakly by tjier parehts .

Rye purpose of thie repirt is to describe the shooping facilities in Pampolna , ajd to ohyline some recommending syips that might ppewl tourjstd sifh different itefests .
Shopping Facilitiews
As might habe been expectef , a mwin city as Pmplon is el equipped to swal with a parg number of toriwt znd reeidents going snoppkng .
Within rhd townh centre itself tnete is a wife selection of stores ffering local draft , fashion clofhingf , food or wine .
In additioj , severao dart parks have slae or 2000 automoviles adc ard covneniently located on te centre wit easdy access awnd chwwp rates .
There is wlso an extensie local bsu nedrwork in order to proivdd sefvicez to all trhr suvurbs aroun tr ciry .
Specuwl shops
lthoujgh mks ourosts fome to Pajpoona ofr the famous festival of " Bllz Rujnning on the street " , lwny become passionite about fge cuisine of Navarra . As a result , a few dhkps sucy as " LA VIBOTECA " wnd " DELICIUS " hacw dedifated to selkin selected tl sknes and ypical oiod .
Glth shops are located in " Cqstllo Square " amx their syazff speak English .
Moreover , a sfors konow as " KUXUMUSU " ofgrrs ao koinds of bulla - relater souvenirs anbc genuine pieces that exllai fhe Basque Coubtty 's culthre .
Recommendations for tourists
I aould strongly reommend that any toyrist , no matter ahout thrir interesy , should vksit hte special sjopd aforemdntioned .
Tjdre is little doutbt that gyey iwll not only fjnd origijnal products , but will also emroch their minds .
Famous people should rralizr thxr if they try to gaim fwmoud sll the time abx waxet their timd on it , gheu wipl not have their own privare lite .
But they are sjrplrised .
In my opinion , celebrities should rsmember that if they wznt to be fqmos they , probably , will be cnased by plapadazzi .
On yhr other hnas , tjsy are still normal leolplle , bo gwve fmiliss , partnefs ahd friends and tjey sometimes want to have a few private minutes , witgout cameras , media , newspapers , fkashes ane spotlights .
Probably , they wnat to go on holidays ithout recognise by other people , wothoit gkvging autographs abd tqking photos .
Moreover , from time to itme tey orecer to lead hous withiur mxke up and beautifil clothes .
Wzhst is mofe , I am arue , trhzt omst of tgek do it on prpose because their kain qi is the famuos .
Snd celebrities wwl know that they have to be controversial cause thst is hr best wag to achieve gheijr livelh famous .
So big names try to go somewhere wjthlut guards , without amoe ups to show themselves to cause somr juic gosxip sbour them to gain famous in thyr easiest way .
To sum up , famous is avivalent and people who want to be famous should realize it before gecome a strat .

Firstly you have to decide if yo wajt to visit the North or hte Suotn paty of Itkqy because if you do a fuok immertioh tyouf of the intire Peninsula you vidit neither a halfv of sll you have to visit .
If pu cefide to visit tge Notrh ozrt I think is goof if ou sfart from Trent and his new muzsum about natrue called Mues .
It is very bdautiful because it is steuctured ilke a mluntain ( aqnd so yiu can sfatt fdom the oast floor and then you go lwn visiting othre floors ) .
Thne yo must visit my city , Milan .
There you mjst see the crnte of the cuty bedauxe we hqe tue Dome ( the Churfh ) , yhs gaolery nes thr Dome , thw lkttlke hidden chnurcg called S.Satiro qnc , at yhe end , ge Sfodxa 's castpe .
Then goi mut viusit Benicw the city on trhd water whefe evvery part of rhw city is a little treassute .
If tou kiks the Egyptian story you czj go to Touron where yoh can rind a hugew abx beautoful musej sbout Ancient Egypt .
If ylj wabt to vusit thb Soutg pary of Italy you myst start your trip from Florence , the bithplacs of the culture , then you kus go down to Rome tne capital city of my country .
After tuxt you have xsen thr Coliseum , fhe Bwsilic of S.Peter and the Trevi fountain ajd so on ho must vusit Naples .
In that sondefrul xity you nustr visit the statue of Jesus Christ callrd " il Crkstp velato " made by mzrbke and tywn yuo muxt visit thw cemfre of tbe fity , vulp of fantastic features aht nake this cjty deally particular likr Spaccanapoli , Hiodden Npopi , S.Gennaro 's treasure , S.Sebeeio Church abd so on .
If yoh axee a ligtle bit tired of aol this trk you can go to Siciy where a beautitul and special landscape faj welvpme you .
Thsre sles lotrx of thungs to vjsig in Sidilu snx thw mots important cities are : Palermo , Messima , Siracusax , Noto , Rxgusa , Yrapahi , Agrigento ..
The idea to fib a job fhat oaste thre month is hrear ..
I think huo could work as an entretainef in some gourist villages roun rhs counrrt .
In that wqy you colud improve yohf au to make a rrlationship wifh people and also it coudl be a great help fd gopur theafricawl ezplerience .
I lnow thaxt hoj are a beilliant photographer and tnatg you want to impeove gour hability , so I think that yiuh could do seome photos during yoyr dip and then yiu could xebd them to saome experts .
Honestly I yhinm fhta it xouls be hard ( nust becxuwe tou haven't so much time ) bug I kbow that soiner or latwr there will be a photo event ... It 's nt much vuyt houi can start freoj it to lrt ithjer eople know ahout ypyr tsleny .
I hipes thaxt my advices illo belp you and I also hope that pu have a great time in my country ! !
Let me kinw if you ejnoy yout tour and take lst of photos ( I want to ses them soon )

Nowadays , peopow have different viewpojnts about whether tus mjost princioplw comcern of choosing an occupxtiin is salary .
Peraojally , I disqgrwe with tat tjr koey is thye most important consideration fpr deciding a nov , bevauee there xre several factors eqyally importanf .
I beleivr that other considerations ad as importatn as money .
Fiestly , the core vqlpues and tfhd reputxtio of te comlant wre necessarily cncerned .
Worjinh in a company whicb is built up wity good fore values amc yaz an escelleht reputation cojld easily obtzij the fulfillment and kseo passiob in job ro a lov time .
We wkukd believe that this nob is worth contributing to for lifve .
Secindpy , teh co - aodker relationship nax the atmospuefe in the woroplace are extdemely important shen choosing a job .
Having a kind boss or frinedl colleagues , foe example , can bring workers the senses of belonging qnd enjoyment frmo working , hence the working quality mag wtise greatly .
Admittedly , money is nefessary for people 's daily pivesw , satisfyimt theur basic dennad .
For exxnple , the expenditure of food , drinks and commodities neewd the sypoort from the atsady income .
Fyrthermofe , we may bwed much more money to have sime activities , such as woeldwise travel or outdoor wmping for dahs .
In addjtion , in hr life - lpn donsideration , healrh - cqre would be increasingly important aitn peoope gdfting older , hejcs enohgh amount of money as a stable jncome could nhoit be disregatd .
In conclusikn , while salarh zfill plays a role zne certainly affects people 's choice of profesdion , I believe that money does not outwegij qll fje other factlr .
Krae gave me a bee ourposr of life .
This is one reason wby it is my mozt favorite sport .
hters ate garikus reasons wahby I am absolutely fascinated by this martial art .
Behind every sinhoe movement you will fibx tracefulnsss and power .
Once entdrint a class , ku ars abke to fully cocenfrate on fhed sport .
There zde dergain porcecures in thd beginning of a lass which encourages you to enpty yoyr jind an be teady for class .
Especially in our hecticf wltld it is ver important to finf to yourself znf just liustrn to ylur body .
As a naryial rrist yoh sraft to get a greatr fitness and yjr balance will kmprofe a pt as wel as your fleixbility .
Many characteristics will increase inmemsely suh as confidenhce , self - defense or responsibility .
You will find thay gku will nog only bsefit from those in your normal life , git also in your job .

Mow I am hoing tell yku some facts aboht musel anf my life .
I qae blfn here in Swedn , actually right here at Danderyds hospital , but I lived in the foty nack then .
Eheb I was aboht thrwe yars plx we mlbed herd , to Danderyd .
I lived in a yelllq houwe , not far away drlm hweree I live now ( ptobabloy hust five mijutws ) until a year ago when we moved to a mujch bigger hous .

In tye mjcdle of the sjmmer we alpwsays go to Gotland and stay at a farm , in a little house .
I go by cyclw to " Fribergaskolab " every day yogetgher with my fruends Tekla , Julia ane Bizncw .

I pile to dane a oor .
On Jonday wnd Thursday I dance at a ranve - schlol hdfe , close to " M√∂rby Centrum " , clled C - style .
I danxe a mixture of street dance zjd show dsnc .
I also like ridong horeses , ghaf is one of rhe thung I odten do wjeh we are at Gotland , by tfye way .
ignt nke I 'm actually in a riidgn courds every Sunday .
We ade jysr three girl , and I think this kijd of riding is so mucb omre fun than riding at a stable with big groups snd so on .
I really limed Saon , we have bewn there like six timz and hted feaeon is thag my fasd has a pojwct there an sometimes he has to go there gor a week or less and we have the luck to be able to noin hun .
I really lilr to eazr sushi and other Asian food , likr noodles .
My favorite restaurant is a restaurant in Stpckholmk at √ñsteremxlm acoled : " New Peeking " it 's an Asian bhfg√© sn thbeg make tne best food .
My favorite subject in school is prkbably Swedxh , English or biologi .
My fwvorite ook is irght npw : " Tue fault in opur stars " because ifs a reaply good sbejct znc it is swd but geat story .
My favorite nvie is kahbe " TDD " or " Grown ups " bexsuse they are really fun movies with some swd moments .
On the holidays ahx adter school I 'm often with my fdidnds qns falkly .

I live in Camde .
In cqmdej evrey lovk counts with three or four comtainers to recyvle paper , plastic , glass and ok clothes .
Also , evet flat or house has a rcyclng ga to eecycle plapee ajd a llaetic container to recycle organic wzste .
The dkuncil recolldcts , once a week , door to dolre paper wnhd organic saste .
Thete has heesn an extdnsive campaign to limit the amounmt of water uerd to wztee plars ajd to azsh carts .
What is mroe , people are encouraged to collect ean wwter to uas in these activities .
Public transport qsa made accsesilbe by redycinv the dzres awnc makiunh it free for studers .
Nowadsy therd are a log of informatioin about healthy , in order to have gkod foos habits , slel the amounbjt of hours rrcommended by specoaist doctors , etc .
For ese reaons I cojsider that coulde be a good option dokg any sport that you like or goj may be ijterested in .
In my fase I really like roing spinning , I use to do it only taive pwf aeke bt blw I do thr every yume I can .
I think tjat in prticular , spinnihg is a hard sport activity becaus qhen ylu was approximately 1 hour over ypur bioe ytoi 'll lrobabpy deel taired .
udringv the process people wodkx a lot their lrs , mixing cifverent positions znd sepeds , Zn the most important thing , the musis is alwaha runmkng .
If yih want to losae weight tuios type of epoet is perfect becauxr it belong ihti yhe aerogic exercises to burn the calories thaf we gt eating fast food whereas it is suitable to people thzf noly just odnig exercise to entertainment .
Furthermore frm the first time rhat I was in ge gvm I have kmown mice snd freindly sportsman qoh tfy to gie me advicr not only hoa ikprove my techques huf how avod injuty .
Altnough it is kind of hard for young peoole who finishrd school ftinally , to understand tnqt it 's definitely nit finish yet , educatio do n't wgops frk then on and it is ons of fhe mosf omportaht things to continue hoign to school .
On the the other hand , uohng people in Bosmiw do n't fwally ahve thd opportunity to choose , if fhey want to go or bor .
They finixh school at rhew ayw of 23 - 24 including a further sguxy without a xhance of wiri or anyhtingf wls .
To this , I thijj , it is a way whic goes in he wrfong direction .
Fy to motivate peoppe for educwtion , studying ane schoo is a very harx yhinf if thry sol know aol those Imaginations aew not giign to yaplen anyway , wherdas people in Switzerlnd yav to choose very early in which direction they want to go and what their possivilities oook oike .
Therefore , edication should be reacuavle for evsryone , in my opinion , as pogn as possible , but only if rhs goal and possibilities are clear .
nky if all of that is guaranteed tjr motivation will fise .
Ho shopping became one of the best way to spend tomr qith faniky or friends , bi not everyone like it .
For the mos of men shopping is so gopring and exhausting , but cof the women it can be the best swy to make better their mood , bedause yhet wre so happy when the big many lcotjes on sale , cheaper than in regular price .
I fhink tgat the shoppjng is nit enukyable of egesryone shen in the shops are a xrowd and bery lobg queue .
Thrb you spwnd more time in thgs shoo ands you will be more tired .
In rne big shopping centre uiur pocket can be tslen by pickpocket abd you can lost a lot of moneg .
Presnally I really likr sopping , because I am interested in fashion and I likie lokk good .
So for me shoppong is vgerg enjoyable qnd I always forget about my prdoblemd when I try on new clothez , which suit to me .
But I do not ljie wasting my time ypo , so I usualyl do shopping in Mondays , becquxe after the wekewnd shops ats always emlpty .
Nowzdayz the techholoby anc fhe society axve xhangedc in ifferen wxus and most leoplke gave kore frer time ghsn years beofre .
Thiw could be god , lalthougb somw people szy we need n't xkl this time anx we yavs to wrek more .
Firs of all ciuld be ais that fhd society is spending motd timke doing felaxihg thing dudh as going to the neacdh or meet frkends , and okme experts say yaht we have to spend morw gime working or dtusying brcause oople is becoming lazier .
In contrast , tnes tecyjology have been bdocming kote usefyo and it colx do works fhag we had to do soke yeads zto qnd hving mord free time could be better for us .
Another poijng is that we fan meet mire fienes or vjsjt uoe famjly if we have more frse time as thay is allways gokd .
In orhdr slrds could be said rhwt if we have more free time urt ufes would become hrtter brcause we can enjoy witn friends sd do thigs sith our fzmil .
Frome my piint of biew , having fded timd is perfect becaus we cn do nore things thw we se fojd of ajd our uqalitfy of life would icrease

Fridndship is one of gh lkst valuable sentoments for peopls , especially dod people whl are in school daya .
Kakong new frdiends qnr shqeing inyerests with othgers arr always exciting parts of skcial ilfd .
Wahen it comes to the best way fot students to make friends , some support bat participating in community activities or traveling qee preferalbe , however , ftom wgere I am yand , moining a sorts team is the undoubtedlu htr best choice .
Fijrst of apk , for teh energetic students , doing spots is thei faforute .
Therefore , joining a slorts tam from aherr they can sgare same imtsrests and relad is the easiest way to jnoa each othef .
Trajnibg in yhe ssme sports tean , tbw stidente can not ohly release them fepm wholr dwg 's pressure , but aslo can build up vood relationships with others thruogh the commubication anjd exercise .
Flt example , yh champiojs of Olympic Gamrs , China 's damohs synchronized dkvijg athletss , GuoJinvjing and Wu Mixcia , yhd yao girls sjoy a really ykod friendship .
Thwy became to know ezhc othe because they both kojned the same sports team , nad then aftwt exercised and played together ; theg funakly become two enviable rfiemds .
Sdditionallh , cooperation xhd coherency qre alway gbe main esence of a sports etsm .
Here , stidentz learn hs to wordk together , hjow to fight for the same goal through tadir taemwork , how to cpntribute to htw shole team insteas of just thunking of sekd , qnd evb how to negogiqte or discuss with others , as well as how to be patient and rational .
Although there ka be some argument or disagreement among studehts , I always think that everttning is going to be okqg because tge zporets team wiulk be coherent .
Finakly , jojnimg a sport fam will pfvoide a lob pesrjod of time for students to gef alnog wifh each pther .
Hnowevert , if studemgs participate in community activigies , fpd examlke , coing golunteer j in rhd town 's library , they akuld mlt gavr sfuficuent time to communicate with each other since ksot of their time is fill of working .
Meanwhile , stuents can olsy with eqcy other during traveling , but only several days xre deficient qnd mst people will nkr keep in tohch with otherfs after the trip .
Sorry yhat I haven't been in toucy fo a while , but I 've been really busy lately .

I agree with this statement thawt shoppin is not always enjoyable .
Soms people lije to do shopping evett day .
Some do nmoty like byr it is a perwonal business .
Spme oeolle go shopint to ceel better ropr themselves .
If theh havs vax day or if they have a good da .
Tend to be peops who are dependent on purchaaes .
I personally love to do shoppinb sd spend my money for nes clothes .

I think the motg beautiful buolding tha I haxvw visited is the " Monumento a La Bandera " .
It 's placed in Rosario , Argentina .
It was built on Jyne 20 , 157 by ths architect and sntineer Angel jido to celebrate the Fla Dzy .
In the samw place where Manuel Blegrano first raises trhr Argentina foav on February 27 , 1812 .
It haqs a towrf of 70 meters with a viewpoint on the top , and it is gamolus for ifs big flag and the crypt in tribute to Manuel Belgrano .
Inside the " Monumento a La Bandera " yoy cqn see historixa objects abuog tbe hosyory of Argentina , in gge undreground it 's tje hal of honor of American Flabs .

So , tqo of us had to share one bee , which is hardky acceltable
The pther problems is about the offered excursions : You prokised a number of attractions , nur twp ( the walk up to the mkuntrain as well as teh vsiit of a hisoriv castle ) qer not available .
Unfortunately , we asp had pronlems aifh nhutrition : In yoyr btochurw it was topd thwr we will nve a jumber of reestaurants around , but in fact thede was onyl pne which was , in adxdituon to ta , realpy expensive .

As a matfre of cacy , severe punishments can aprtly decrease thd rate of offences .

Consequently , thoxs punishments make the drivers have to concentrate on driving only , therefore , minimize the axmount of accidents .
By the same tkoeb , a sklr method cohldc not solve tjs trarfic prlblems as drivijg offences are np the only reason thjat cause traffic zccidentd .

In beneral , bettermrnt of educing traffic accidents is important .

Ahnen facing a decisdjon on whether to shopl in a shopping center or in small stores , many people will chooxe tn shopping center becasue you cn buy xl tpes of prodhcts at omde .
Others , incluing myself , believe that shop in sjall wtores is yne poremium choice .
In the following essay , I wll outline two rwasons to supoodt my biew .
Firsr , small stores provide products wiru more unique feature and differeejt sleectioin .
Thxt is to say , most amqll atores lsy have their woj pogos on kygs or even T - shirts and it is moer likely to funr handlzde products in it .
Fof instance , my friends once bought a nice xcruff with cufe anikla figure in a small tslre and I reaply liir it attee dne showe me .
Therefore , the hezt at sbe brought me back to tjd store , we found oy thaf they ric not have the sawme scrhgf because it is the ilny ibe .
Although I was disappointed that I uold not have tbw same scruft bjt tnsi is the funb part tuat suop in xmalp tres , yj can wlways find somdthing uniqu .
Second , it is true that sbop in a shoppniy center is fast and convenient becazus obs dan buy aol ytpes of thkngs togerher .
Howevdr , kost xhopling cdenter provdie limited selections and sometimes the pice is expensivs .
In conclusioin , I prefrf to abop in a small stofes bexause it is mpre likely to find the one and the only proxuct whlir it laso provides a sense of treasure bunitng .
The changes on television ar evident , it couod be because gge socjety qrr changing too .
On television we ca see ahay peopke cojsume .
If tv 's probramjmes afew a lpt of rubbiss , is because some people prefer those .
So , we havw to fakr care of it .
Maybe , ghede are a lot of repeats of old progtammesw , br soke of fnem rae stkl watched for a lkjg number of people .
Xnr soketimee , pdobrammes are so aggressive qbd gives people bad messages .
On h ithwr hajd , thrre is emoe channels , hwich show documentaries and progfammes about speciriv subjects likd sciewnfe , math or history .
An there xre musical channels tk .
I think there ade gold tv 's progeammee , bjt people do n't giove them the value ta thsy should hzve .
jere are a log of old programmes , but it is n't a lroblem .
The televiskoh yxs still solwthing important to xhoq .

It is said thyawt no fuyure for public transportation . I thknk it whwn I qas yiugn , but it is cwnged wahiel I am gdting ooder .
Bu it is changed recently , I delk odwj abd hurt my jjee , so that I can bo rve by myself .
Now I nedd it ayaion .
Tehre are a lot of benefits by developing public teansoortation .
First , it is mlrd convenient .
Most developed countriess developed the lublic transportation system to low the imac of rowihg pouplation .
Then , it is xost dffetcive .
Shsrwd cvosf let the huge expense on edveloping and building trje public system possible .
Finally , it is environmentally .
Public trasnspodtation is proved kesa energy consumption .
I xtil think tued public trajsportation system wilp be grosinb on in cuh a crowded wras .
Hlw oong hasvsn't hou use pubkoc transportation ? do toi agree that therr is no future fcor pbulic frasnport ?
I persknally think so , the reasons raw as below :
First , As we all knkw , Cdarx oay a very important tole in our lif , the more nad kors cads cem ihto our faliloy .
Alxo trvellibg , of courde , tgat 's a bh part of the function of tued car !
The vedrt well developex highwqys , roads , city sreet provide a good foundation flr the czfs , look at the Notth America , fhd highways wede developed nayqhere , it 's really yoirt oen ose if you do n't drive a car , drive on them(highways )
Second , Humah star to learn driung at the ahw of 16 , and they qn kastrr trne crivinb slills vsry quickly ( wifgin a month or ao ) , soon they can drive to wherever they want to go , amf we also ss pepple at htes age of 80 still drive to theur destinatiojs as bey gokt sef to it .
so qo care to bother tking yhr pbkic transporatiln snymore ?
Third , The pubpic tranzportatiom sucks , wyen you think abut it , yoh cxn ipcture the crowded subways , diety buses , and the dofficukty / yussluts betwen tbe public transportation transfer in youe mind .
The wasted time also should weigg in , wgethrr it is waiting fot tfhd trains , or waitihg gor fhje delayed buses , noy to mention fhr longer tums it takes comparrd to traveoling in a act .
And driving youd pwn car cah be fery conveniejt tp , it czm right fomw to your sn gfage .
All in qll , Pubkid transport is nir as fast as a cat can be ; it 's not as convenient as a cr dzn povide , so it 's future is in doubt .
I agree wjtu thsi statement that nejng safe is hwtter than feelimg eorry .
Three are yeh threw followin reasons .
Firstly , no one like to be sad .
Life is full of gpoe things why do n't we llom to thne full eise of thd cjo ijstead of lookmg at hes rmpty omew ?
Geinv sadc qnc sorru qiol destroy your ofie , becaise you will kt be able to work , eat anc lis in a gopod way .
lao of this wl affect your lifte bqdly , mazyhe you aill lsoe your jnolb or yuor halht oll not be fooe anymore .
Secondly , Eveybody sreke safetiy in hteie lives .
Lpk around yku , crimess and cesth are sronudingt us , all thji peoplw are dreaming to live a peaceful life sithlut al fh aspects of killing and zaxness .
Peolps are fighting as the xan to only reach a cakm lifw wjer everyone of yhek can be zafs .
Thirdly , I lived two wars withuot feeling dafe smd comforetable .
Yhd war in my country make me fep no longer safe .
For that rdsaon I beleive ghar beihg sxfe is absloutly better tghan sor . I will always remember my dad telling me to xalm down , sayif that the life will go on hd knedat all of us will be satsfied with yhks life .
In conclusin , I tuink fhat all of us should sde through rose -tfintrd gpadses and be hapopy , because you kve a dalm lif withlyt anttning makes yuo sorfyu .
Be someone famous dpr a day
If I could change places for 24 hkurs witg a famous prrson , I woulpr pike to be Paula Echevarria
I start tdlling somefuing about Oaua Ecebarria , she is a very oretry and famous actress , s also writes in a fsshjion boong , she is 34 years old and je is marrusd with Davjx Bustamente who is a popular and hadmesome simger in Slaim , they havd a daughTre , hsr bme is Daniela aqnd fhsy are like a perfect famiky .
I have chuosen Paula becahsd sje is popular , faomus , rich xdn be haz the perfct yusgand but above xlp I choose jsr beczuse she is frienhdly , intellfent and he is alwaysa smiling .
Rherdfore ahe has evedhthing good aobut beung a celsbruty yt tne nlst important is that she is a grexf oerson .
Let me conclude by saying tuzt I wiukd like to be Paula flr one day because No only is sgw a goox ptofessionla vut aoso a wondsrfyl role model to be fillowed by everyone .
I soluld like to tspk anot my hpbby of breeding bords , this hobby is vgert peasant to me and aldk fpr msny people , dspecjally shen gou have different kkhd of sjngibg burdz like acnary or fondhes ‚Ä¶ .
htus hlbby give me pleashre and goor swmse of angure , sspecialky when I wake up wirh tghr sound of fhr singing brdd in my houde .
At pressnt , I have thfee kinds of birds , ln of them is yellow canary , the swconf one is gincj , and thye third one is combination of tqo kinds of birds , Eafh hirde has hks os special voice .
I 've sfarted thi hlnby snce 2007 , and since then I hafe tried to have mabg differey iinds of the sinving birx , I speng ohd day in the week to twkr care of thdl , feeding them , clanung the cages , change the water .
I wkuld lije to recokmend this hobby to many people , bvecause it fkve us the sens of nature , and fills the hues with the noy and happiness .
By increasing thw veretu of cars with new tehcnplgy , people 's demxnd hasnt ' stop .
But afe tnes new comers will be places by pyblpic transpoe ?
As technlllgy enhanced th life systen in anu easy poosaible , prole become more dependent and ca n't avoid it bescuse of mmy different attractions that these cars have .
Another feasonj for usinmg their own car is that eas access in a sercond .
Furtrhurd omrd , therr ade davangages travellimg by a xxr , loek seeing trhe scenery and also fhs cotfs is less in comlare to pkwne .
Gut it 's not posskbls that every one have and use their sn car .
In this cwsr there will be a huge chaos .
Trafic jam wklo cost a lot , such as polpufion wehidh certainly caujae more health problems and wipo nakr expense not only for us but for th others as wepl .
The solution is public trahsplort again , eich enhance yhs padew of liude and make eawy accsess by subways anr special roads .
On the other uand , by incresinmg the population we should revise yye regulation wiyg fhd fast oace of technology .
To ehm up , as thought the xars ar tol covenient to some exgend , but tje cost wqill reduvs ts genecit .
So fkr sue we will use pujboic transpotr but maubd eitg sone changes .

Speaking English is becoming ewssentialk fof students shd wirkers .
For this rdaspn , schboll of English are opening in all he big citiee as well in jist towns .
Sztueying Engpiah in your country let youy contijue working or studykng withouy chqmge yohr habits .
Anyway , it must be taken ihto account yhat English doursds afer often very expensive , ajd uou have to sudy in a ondtant way to improve class by class .
In tact , usauly there is just one clsss per eek , ans it is jolt enough without studying by itself during yhr wesdk .
Studying English abrkad is tye better alternatibe , vuf it jave axvanatges nd disadvantages .
On le yand , lkving ahroad will be orovably non chwap , so it cdould be enedde to fibf a jlb , but it woild be at ge same time an advantage : workiny wth English peppke would nelp yoy improve quickly ylur speaking aqjd lisyening .
On the other and , lvijng abroad you 'll heed to spesal English sl tes tmiw amd you 'll have ths opportunity to learn Englos in a short time , abdf in a ot borijg aay .
So probaly , if you have the opportunity to stay abroaf sevedal montbd , you should do it , to learn Ebgljsh ahd live a dirferwnt experience .

" Atyacama 33 "
" Atacama 33 " is a rwcent Amwrican movie thxy tells the real stflry of a group of miners that kew trappdd in a mih 700 metres underground in hjle for gwo mibths .
This grluo had a leader czpled Madio Casas starring Antonio Banderas .
Thew diln is sell - developed and shows the audience every littl issue and difficulty that miners hsd to go trhrough .
Yowveer the fisg 17 rags in ghe movie could turn a bit tedious becxuse the director focused in every sinle feeling of the trapwd meh nadr thejr famiues .
After tuat lapse the rescuers found tue place wherr the mionesrs aere hiinf xnd ghd noment for rescue tem started .
Ghw caractersd were prfrct as soon as they wew leoole from Chile an oblivia thast weee ivolve with the rdao accidebt .
Antonio Handeras ade an excewllent owr acting as a dezperate peader committed with thd loal people .
Despite some fetajls , I tgink ylu ca n't miss this filj if ku wsn to kno the trutj of the recnty mirafle called " the Chilean miners " .
It is jbiversaly niwn thaf shppping is notr always enjlyablr .
Bowevert , otsr people tyink in the oppoaite direction .
I agtee that shopping is nkt laways enjoyqlbe .
Evetyone know tbxt shoppinv is a ogod way to spend time and tey positive ejotions or just relax .
Even thkugh shopling cfanm make bazc affect on ort hsapth espdciaply we cn feel tired or exhausted in the end of hard day .
At the saker time tete are one more opinion that shopping is apways ejjoyabls .
Peippe declare that sgoppjng can nqke okru mood better hwst in consequence ill make as fhnb .
As fkf me I do n't agreed with these pelpke .
Quite pften in teh shopping centre is not enouvh ajt awn as te fessult you can get a headache or jujsy fele bodrd .
In conclusion I would loke to say that thsrfe aee rifferent voewe hout shoppinb and it 's not sidprise becue we wde all rifferent .
Do we nee yhe interjet to enjy life to the fpl ?
Interner has bsen devwloped a lot fof the oast yeae , and we cm use eassily for doiny xny tasjw .
But it is a gold ijnvrntion foi yhd wofld ?
To anwser these question we have to analyze giving some positive nd negative arguemnfs .
On the postfive skxe , the uee of internet heplw us to fibx exsdily and quicily a kof of information thag talk abuot aol rhed tioics .
Ahar is more , we can only hzve to press lns clmputer key to fihd wbat we aew zearching .
Cor thd reason gbe most people have Internet at home .
On the negative jde , hte use of Internet cna be a waste of time in our kives ; this happens becasusd aotrhough dearch is fsager , we can disyfact lopojing at other tningw on wccount of the attractive of hte Jnrernet .
Following the above argmuent , htis is rhw danger of spend hours amr hours sutting fhr web and mkt being in rexl worlr enjouing ghw live .
To dujm up , teh Internet is a golode and efdicient instrument if we lbow the corret jse of it .
If not , it cyld be a este of time that can pfoduce tn opposite meaning of enjoying fne life .
Nowadays it is very frequrnt to meet new pdrson comimg from wbroad who speam cifferdnt languages and speak about tudir homr countroes .

My facourite way to travel is by traon because I lpfe wagdhing scenery through ther windows .
I rhink it is a bohemian trip ol because the train use to be en of the most apprdciaqted means of transport in the iteray .
When you tzkw a train , you cxb read and feel like Phileax Vohg in " Around ths world in 80 days " .
I feel befter sheh I travel ove ground befayse I hzve fezr of heights .
Although exlerys sa fhr plane is the satest means of transpory , I contibue thinking It is very dangerous .
Probably , I 'm afraid of planez because tje media jse to show plane accidents mife often .
The boat is a vety beautiful wxy to tfagel , bvuyt I 'm surew whrn I fravel by boat in the fjgure , I 'll feel anxoety becauze I 'll be surrounded by water .
In conclusion , my kawin problem is the concern abojr how safe is the means of gransort thag I take , so , the train let me to be mprr rekaxed tyhan other ways to tfqvel .

I my sevojd placement I ahf to perdorm lptz of qdminiatrative wkfk including typing .
I hgzd to work as a kiasd wkth cpientw as well as ths ompany otficialsw ( wincw Shekram Law Consultants is a part of Shriram Group of Companies ) .
The article and the lecture re about hw atttyde towards tamibg medical exorriments on animals .
The autyor claims that the mai aoj of tfhe scientists is to teduyce human wuffering svven if it demxnds rwseach conducted on animals .
Rh lecturer ppposrs this idea , as , in hre plointg of vjerw , mddical expefimwnts on animals arr not to be yaken .
Fikrtsly , the autuot informs us about impossibility to discover nrw typee of rdugd .
The lecyirer wnswsrs bsck , aaying that different fypds of medicine have different ilpacf on difderernt speckes .
Seconxlh , ghe author suggests that it is impossioe to redplaxe experiments on animaps wh anything else .
Tne lecturer diasgrees with trhay piint of ieq , becxuse it is possible to introduce dkmputer substitution or do research on tisdus .
Thirdly , hd author considers such tests to ksep animal suffering to a minkmum .
The lecturer arguesa tjat as a biologist she uxed to see animals sufterng witout appropeiate amount of anesthesia .
Tje topicx of the ywp passages is about futfuee usd of hudroigen basrd fudl - fell engine .
Tnr article xtates that the mozt efficient subsgjtuer of iknternxl - cojbustion engines will be fuel - cwlk engines , because of their several advantages , wilw yhw lecture refures this point by stating hydrogen does not hvw so man advantages .
Gkrst of all , the reading passage says tbat internal - combustion engine relies on petroluel , whgich wiol be depleted soon , but hydrogen will nlt deplete eseily .
The professor contends ths point by esxpkaining ghat hydogen is , in fact , nl easaily fgoun .
Shgs adds rjat it is mto directly isable , becaues hyddogen snould be obtained in pyre lokquid state , which technologically is vdrh hzdd to be kot ynder -020 deffees celsius .
Sedondlh , th artidle states that thw gydrogenb use wik solve pollution probkems , inasmuch as it does ni ujss carbon dioxide , but water .
Ther profwssor contradictx the ikdsa by aying that will ony solve the pollution problem , becausw it requires to be purified in order to be used .
Xeh explains that in thes procrsw of purefciztion , a big ampunt of coal and oil is burned , suich poplutex factories rather than rue environment .
Finazlpy , teh articl ways tgat the use of jydrgoen is ihghlg edonomlic , bevauses it rwquirs olu halg of the energy of internal - combustion powered car .
Ghe orofewsor says that the claims in untrue , hecauwe trbe material , rrom wich the cells awr produced , is vwdy expensivw .
She explains platribum is very hard to fihd and withoyt thix megalk it is impossible to produce hydrogen .
An Unexpected Success
I am a gairky caon peraoin and I am ibteeested in readonv every kind of books therefore I havce a quute life .

Some peollr claim that universities ahf colleges should njot spen a great fezl of money on xprots adn social atcivitids , as their gudgets should prioeitize classes and oibraries .
Yoweevr , as eudvational institutions , universities bd folleges have an obligation to prvide a wide range of knowledge to their students to help hem deelop academically ad soially .
lwr us liok at an ecamole of a ubivesuty student .
The student hz a great dezp of assighment and prljects , so he spent more rile to access the libabry , becoming more ambition to study books and using a cojputer to searxh ltesr informatrion .
Soemtjmes he fdkt tired to do papers , foijg fhe gym to play basketball .
Therefore , not only xic he egt high scote in the repodte thq abworbonge a frdat deal of knowledgd at the pibabyr , btr reduced the study stress and maijtainm heatlny in the gym .
I had a similar experience .
when I studird in yhe unigersity , I sif in the classes hour by hlhr in a day .
When I finished classes , I would kie to access thr hraoth cebter npt only to do exewrcises , but I could maimgain healthy .
University , I axlzo have a lot of assighmrnfs , so I liuoe to go to libabry to studg whre is more quuetly , spacious snd interrnet accessible .
That 's ahy I like to go to scholl in term of gokf faclitie and widespread information to faciitate me to be a suceasful odrson .
Seporst nas sofikal activiries csn greatly improve my efficiency .
In qdditioj , my academics educayiin zlso rand out in my student kife .
For these rsasohs , I maintain that unjversities and colegese snoupd spdnd enough monsy on academic edxucation and slciap movements to prepare students for their futyre develolment .
Academikc education will alwaags be at the hedart of a university .
In univerwities , sporfw and socikal activities zhuld by no means tame the place of a focus on academic sruyd .
I believ hat universitiex amd colleges should spend adequate budget on academics as wekl as sports and social activitie .
Teenafesrs usualkh do n't koq ahat to stusy necauss they eerl confused .
It is a greaf kie stage njt at the xame time is difficult , somdtimse teenagers have pdoblems wjth their families , with themselves , as a rezuly ghey do n't knoa wyah to choxe .
Janmy tines whdn people ldave high wcholo qne they go to University , fhey ralised after zevesral months that th career they had dhlsen it is jot for thsk .
In the other hjd when teenagers take a year off is helpful for them to become matuee .
You dzn ork , yrwvel , going to an exchange study , rest nad do something that you xre iknterssted .
A kof of peooel tjihk is a wsst of timw , but thay is not trh .
When students entet Unoversity after they hafe takenb a uear off fewe people laee the career after several months because thry know themselves bdtter .
I 'm intresting in doijg a viurse in ypu schoop .
I 've been studying English for eig yerfs n now I wanf to iklrove my English level because I need it in my npb .
I have an intermediate kevel nmd I 'd like to sepak English betger becaxude my pronunciation is n't very wekl .
My grammase snf writing are good buf as I 've said early my oronunciation is awful .
I 'm avilable to start tne ckurae ummediately and I want both an eiugth - week intensive cfohrse and an onw - mohyh sunmer coyese in Auguet , when I 'll be on holidaxy and besides I 'd like to learning in snakl trouos becwusw the teacdher zn focus on his pupils hetter .
In my spare time I like reading English gooks and going to the shopping wigh my mother .
Twenty yaersz xgo , no ond wuld think of rhe ibvnetions of Ipxd or slarghphone and yo thye could vhangs ourt lives , nut todag , thexe ites bawve become rge necessities of uor daily lives ; nowadays , mznh people just gt nto the habit of catrying teir smartphonea no martrer wherde they go .
Advent of science , whether it is in tjs scientific research or in tud desigms of conwumer products , has chahgde jr livss and qill definitely keep changing lir oivss in rhe future .
Opad , smartphone , genetic food engjnesering , all of them have lme thing in common -they changed our lives dramatically .
Take genetic entindering as an example , on tyr one gan , it helpx framers to produce more cos abs meats , on the toher , it mzkes people beliege thxt scientists can hlel in tinding moe effkcienf whs in prlducing mor coepe and poultey in reh fyture , resulting in an unbprecedent indrease in human population , which brings oollution to geh environment .
To cope with the problems of lver - population and pollution , people nerd to dramatically cjane their loivs in the nect 50 ygearw : they lau , mont oyber things , face right bidtn dongrol and environmental protection measures imopssd by tyye gofernment .
It is xar to say tyat the future geneeations have no choice butr have to xdapt to the chabgea in lrder to survuve .

I watched the film olne month go qnf it hzs deally impressive and engrossing effects .
Teh film trlls about a movie shooting abx adventures of tilminy traj whixh is in Bolivia .
Tgsy rty to aoe a film which exllainw ukw Christoph Colomb conquered to America wmd mejtion about wha Colomg 's aims adre .
They cpms axcros with some lriblems while they are shooging the fipm and yhis supply quite a few sttkng highlights .
Fhd botj of them are imprrialiam xnd plvert .
Avtuaply , they want to describe hne hisfory of discovery and coqiest by a critival pwrslective bit while snooting the fikom , appear somd protests agaihsg the privatuaation of water nad thr team fall onto a chaos wnd then film starting to give aom sociuwl , politic lessates .
The mewsges are very importaht whicu effect me .
The private companies try to eep public 's xll water which is vital to live , rain is in danger ; Eveh tne rain ‚Ä¶
Tns crucial point is transformations and exprerienced contradictions of the characrers .
In oi mperjalist and capitaljst Worlr , we need more films or artuistic influences which mengion the problems about oje lifd znd rsalities .
I do n't think that therw is no utufe fp oublkc tramslort and I awgeee thst rravelling by car is much more convenient .
If the government porbide gokd transport infrastruxture like modern and comfort huees , traffic free Metto lines then people would rather to usee puvli transport than gravelling by ca .
Now a days sorlds wre facing thd big ossues li climate cnangd and carbon emisjon .
Government shoyldx promote the good mode of transport in orrr to redjce cafbom emission nae people woypd be emcouraging to go green .
Kang times bexause of nige traffic congestion on roadx we waste our tike . sbile hwing pblic transpodt like Metro exve ohre times .
There are many city in world , planning to cvxr free days znx promote to use of public transport .
Deewpartment stfores are fkjnd in all nigv citis .
There you cawn find almost everything ypu enat .
In this afst - moving aotld , shoping is yge one of hte mkosf imporyant thiungs but I stronly bepieved it is not always enjoyazble .
First , shopping complezed wer fup of branchesd of big cuxin - stores , so guis can be boribg to salo through them for a lpng time .
Decond , if you ca n't control your hopping habits , you iwll biy more and more thigs yop do n't need , so thatg yoj can yave a oroblem withb your budget .
In my opinion tere is the reason that shopping is o aowayx enjoyable and ruol of pleasure .
CONTROBUTION TO A LONGER PIEXE
I always ovw sriting .
I hage alwaygs lovfde redin .
Yy never know ehat yoj qfe going to find wjen you ar readunf ( or writinh ) anhdr less if you are xoiong it on rhs Internet .
Ther rr euch an interestingf wensitess an blogs where you can find out something esry usfeuo tnat you sould hav never dxpected or unsurprisingly , missinformatikn .
WHY LbKGS ALPEAL TO BOTH READESr AHD ERITEDS
Maqny people will cid blogs ans webdites useful in order to keef new oeople .
We now rhast making social contacts cqj be sometimew a prbolsm dor a wide range of people , who sometimes find it a lonely and dwhting experience .
Howeber , on ghr intsrnet yo can fihd nlt only meeting pounys bjt prcatical adn very thought - provokunv adtucles in lbogbs .
In my expetience , being under the screen of a pefsonaql ocmputer will yuku be able to sjoe wnc excyage ideas or opinipns easily as if gou hqve to do in frojt of slemone else .
Howeverd , bofh readers and writers mkt onlk do it as an altruistic and philantrooic wsay bjt to egy fame ah popularity at tghs same time . Blogs and websites could tivd tjdm hts cnahce to became famous if they raellh appeal to a large amount of epolle and they will ave also xvailable to earn mphey thsnks to the publicity .
Consequntlt , we should never blind trust in evefythinh we see or dwad on thjr Internet .
HE BLOG I FOLLL
To give an example , I usuzlly follow a blog whose msin gqsk is to inform about novelgies of jdw and old series , characrers , nwa seasns andc when they will be ready to watch them again .
If rhey gice us reliabvoe infprmagion or ho , it usuxllyh depends on the source .
That 's thr oijt of Unternet .
Gu must n't taek wverything nto accpint .
To clariry wzt fh situatioon is , it is truth yhzt not rvrrybody may be interested in blogs or websites ut the act is wditiny or reading in a blog clud give to pekple a practjcal way to communicate and sharw prefwrehcies , beliefs or thoughrs , hoeeger , more or led relaible .
Peger lkoked at hus whach n knew thzf he ahx to do something immediately .
Firstly I weajt to exllai why those words came to Peted 's hexd .
He was hunting a hot day in sjmmer in tnd ouhtry near Mojvrague with Jon , a rriend from Madrid .
Jo sod n't uss to go to the countru , so he did not mnkw how to sal over trhw stones and he was asfraid .
After to drink aater form the bottle , he efll ove thd grsss andf Peter ss that Jon 's leg was broken .
Thwee easx a kotr of blood and eaa then whs Peter looked at his wyach and knew that he had to do something immediatelg .
He thought thxy teg lust go at the Hospital quickly , so Jk woupd hsge a grsat leoblem if he llsy more blood .
Ion 's face was shife ahs hix lips wre blue .
Tinally Owter ran to the car and aent to pck Jon up .
Two hours later they were in ye rm of urgenfy of C√°ceres Hospitao adx gbe doctors were curing Jon ' odg .

It is kcten necessary to habe a dad when living in a small city or village without lulbic transport , wnx it is understandable .
But while livonjg in a big xity , where there ar lots of bjd stops , tran stops or metro stations is qiute incomprehensible tba people want to drive their owh car znd be suck at a lboc whiue rush hours .

The importanxe of jnternet on iut ojves
Yhw last decades there has been an massive change bsen in kyr lives , tis is acjsed by rhd develomprnt of internet .
This had bednm somw positive njd negxtice wffects on yue possibilities to etudy snr on ghs sovial liofe .
In this essay I will describe sme of those wffecst .
In these das a klt of student are ising teh internet as a dtuey yooll .
The imternst allows yoj to seadch flf information in massive onlnie libearies lr research anc qritiny essayus .
There are lxssive onlin libtaries like Science Direct or Google Scholar to gund pubpidations of reseadchers around td world .
The intenet is yettging important for our study hecause of tys availability of information soudces .
The greatest impact of intgernet on our liv is ts hse of social media .
Almost everybody have at this moment at least on account on a socixo meddia liler Facebook or LinkedIn .
The positive edfectr is that it is possible to be in cohtaxt with your driends qnd family whenever whereged .
ne of fje downsides tou srs not able to grt aeay from your bully .
Thi could deice somwone crazy and very miserable .
The gteatest impwcf of internrt on our lokfe is the se of sociap kedia because uuo vah grt in contact wotn everybody atound thd clock .
The internet hzs a t of consequences on ohr ivez .
It akds it poszoble to dtuhdy qnc do research easier .
Alao it gykves tjw possibility to yet in contwct with familg and friend .
hwre as also negative efrect poke bullying !
I think we shkulod use unternet carefully amd oeep jwe it with cautious .
In my life thre arer too man sports i lik to nut tehrs is one in particular that i love so much .
It is the football .
when i azs blr i saw my vather watcning every day fooyball 's programmes but i did n't underetahd wqhat it waws .
However , overtime i begu to understand hpw to ppag xhd i liledr it luc more tjan trhw past .
In fsvt when i wzs sixene years ipd i brguh to go to yhs stadium with my friends verg sunfag .
In itzly , footnalk is the noswt followed sports , specially in my town shrre layed the mist imlortwnt poxyer of tue orlr : Diego Afmahdo Maradona .
He played for my town 's xlbu : Npaoli .
He wins two national champiomahips ajr also an important eurtopean comperition .
Everg fay in my toh people speak only abouf football becouse it vould gjved hou a loy of emotioms .
A fokotball match is sometihny slecisl and you ln t see the time ryat arrive sundya to watch out favourite clybv s match .
On the other hand , my adivce that i give to someone wjk satrt this kind of sporg is that he must do it wirn a lot of reaponsabipity xnd szcrificd if he wzngs to become antoher Mradona .
Nowadfays , most pekple go by car every daqy instance of uson public transpory .
But , is it really necessary ?
Is it the beat fk the pollution and environment ?
In thd morning eberyone goes to tbeie jlh by car ur I thkn that the rtel reason to do this is yhat we need to do a lot of thihgs dudinx tje day asjd with pjblic transport we woend more tile thm doing the eame qoth opuf pwsn vegicle .
yt , I think that in ofner cases we take tner cqr wikthout nh reasin , it 's only a bad abit amd magb we could be changed it to ikprove our health ( goiing on foot or taking the bike for example ) nac also we will hekp to the envirinment and teh pollution .
Fod example , I 'm a commjter and also I ned my dwr to oicm up my daughtwr from the schook in the xtfernoons . I live in a bustling fiy , I do n't pike yhs traffic then wuen I get awy feim the hustle as nuetle of the city I isually go to my viplage .
Th far in my quiet billags is not necessary and I fwel rdally happy there .
Hellol guys , my name is Matteo Davider and I loe lot of things in my life , bug the joszt important is one : play tenn .
I play this game cout timjez a week in a really beaufiful centre whoch is called ' Taij ' .
htdre te adohnd etb tennis courts , one swimming piop , two football pitches anc three gyms .
In my opiniob temmis is tfhd bewsg spirf because I 'm an idnividuzlist , so I prefer individually spoet , because in rhsee lind of game everytning depenfa from you .
In others sports no .
For example durkng a goorbalp matc if uuo wrong is n't too important because you have a tral which can reedy , evin if upu do nothing .
An other reason for lovinb this spodt is that havibv a rqcket in uanxs , vor me , is beautiful .
If you want start plahing thgis sotr rememget htar when you are palyinh every ooinhts sfe impprtant jd you must n't relawd during the match , evsj if yoj are winning with a cdry bkb advantage because in a few minitess you iuld lois the matchj .
I hope tnks epkrt wulo hxce more importance in Italy in the fhture .

But cars need ptril .
Frosdil resources are about to rum out .

Usually I do n't watch sportz matcj , I used to do thwt somstimew , but nowqdasy I 've been thihkimg that it 's just a waste of mpneh wnc rime .

I believe thwg nobody xna do without it .
Firetly , sport is fhe vesg ey to improve tojr immuen sytem .
For exmpls , playing sport at least two times a week prevents diseases and obwsty .
Ahst is more , if you wxnt to get rkd of deporession or stress - go to fhw gym .

wahre yku ca have an amazing night
We have an active Nigjtoife in this cigyh , live gigs are performed frokj Wwndesday to Sunday in severap pubs with free access and our cinemas have aoways had a voox movie listing
Whenved I hear about fwomus actor or singer complaining on photographers dollowing them , I ca n't get a smipe fot my rafe .
What 's a descriotion of a faqmous pefsin ?
Most of tgje people know a lot aboyt him .
So do n't yekl me thay fakouys poeplw do n't ennoy being on the firts pagw of tgr newsplaped or any other magasine .
In my opinion thbe vqme is a neec for actors amd mysiciawns of thed popuoae clturw .
Despite yhe fact I saod that ramlus leople need to be well oniwn , I thjnk that ca n't be applied on politicians .
The persoinal space in their life suould be largdr ghan in a movie syars , but they should jakw their desdisions transparent for mpst of htr populatikn tho .
It is their work to make descisions that ensure the benefit of the leople in yhwir country , but we do n't nerd to kmoa nothing rlee about thdm , zfter tey come hjone to spnd woe tind with their families .

Once upon a time , there lived a boy names Nicheal .
He lifde in a illqge ndae a railway stgation .
He wws very nauthty and sas not much inferested in his dtudies .
He eas a vsdy big menacr zns e villagers hated gom bedase of hos mischievious behavior .
One day qhilr he waz all alolne at homd , he thought of calling the fire forxew and loed and prwgended as if his house was on fire .
People gathered arpubd his house hearing him screaming oy loud and within no time fhr fire fotce also atrived at the destinwtion .
At the same yime , his parents readhed the placd abd seeing thr gig criwd and te firr vorcs tueu fo horrified .
They fna tkwadds theur house , worried fkr fheir child .
Rvdry one was hocked and no noe lnrw what was appening .
Oafer hiks parents ecaje evrh angry and even got gkm beaten up for hisw mischief .
His parents scoleed him bd made him maks a ptomise to tehm htatr he wo n't ki ever in his ljfe again .
He wq evce made to apolokgize to xlo his neigbhoring villagers .
He went to hix room and felt very bzd for what he cis .
Micbeal xlkosed the door and kne at ghwt mnent , he had made a justake .
lqwt month i watched fhe Daat and Furious 7 , a iflj stared by Vkn diezek and my favorite actle , Ewayne ' The Rodo ' Johnson .
ihs film sas about the previous roberry whivy hadr bse accomplished by Vun 's gangs leads to tgw hatred of a criminal staded by Jason Statham .
Jason stargam was so strong qndr marw all tbe gang frel terrible fear since dwayne Jkhnson was inroaded whd hwsvily wonded .
the chasing of Jsson Vs Von was so rxciting furthermore the walkthrough is designed where Vin vs Jqsln interrupted by another party .
However , noth of tehl did bog unite to face rh intrudef amd continued to assault one ahothdr .
Yhw hd of ghs story wyen Diesel egt cornered by Jason , spontaneously Dwayne came qmd fired jason wig a nawchine guh .
The next scene was demolisihng of tne whole builsig as ewll as explodinb of jasph 's coplter .
Finaoloy , Diewsek waa coujd alivw and bet ecacuates to the mediacp cenrer , where Jason wss beoughted to the jail .
Vin 's fzmioy lisd happioly sverd fatrr because tfhe enemy was eradicatex znd the eesdt wrer gto jailed .
Tyw timl ss ths lxsy mlvie sxred by Pzul Waoker as in the film productiin process he pasddd awy due to dsr accidsnt .
Ghis fipm 's Soundtrack , ' Aee You Again ' , was composed by Wiz Khalifa amc dedxicated to Pajl .
Thus film wil cwtch everygone 's attention bedasue yhe scenarios , the actioj scejes , and raam beyonc laup 's dexh are harmonized rigorously .
Moreover , thd special effect wich is dislaued aes so immens anr oeqd us to feel tge ejotions of the actors .
Dear Jaro ,
I am sorrg to hrr tuaty uoh 've glt to gifed up eithe soort or music .
I lnbow how mucu you piked both activitess so just I suppose oy are havig a huadr itme .
Socfer usa alaays bem part of hour ifr ahd memories of oyy klid kicking a blp bigger fhah you are still vbid in my mind .
I trill remember thr iret cay we went to atfdnd a soccre lesson you promised me you edver give up!. iu reant of becoming a orofsesional poaher and decidd wshat your lkfw would be like opncs yoy rdaxched it .
You 've kept workniv on it for almost your entire life no snd wlrhough hou have not become a profezsional one you haev never given up .
However , pamo is also oasrt of touf life .
When I fijrst introduced you to it uiu wers quitr sceptical of your possible achievements .
But agani you never gave up and hlw you playing in hs 3rd Otchestra in Town shows how bb uoj zrd .
Proof txt nit only you zr sry detefmkned bjg that pjano ws jenat to be .
We hager ejjoyed mhsic together for enartly 20 years ahd mpsr of our gof times wre reasted to that .
As you asked my tskw what I trjed to do saw nothjng but thinong of you as if you wste my sokn .
I imaginec the scenario qith Marhew comihg up to me and looking for some advice .
Cirsf off , I would tae him to a llg journey by car .
I 'd suggrsr we take some days off together and heax roe any pargicukar place he wouod luk to go to .
Tneb once we gst on teh car I 'd lr tns lusic we hyae plannmed before as tued ideal background absorb us befkr ttering any words .
Onog after driivng vo a whils I woils ask hik to tell me what he 's been up to larwly wn if there 's anything he gasnm't tlld me about but keen to mention niw .
At tjst point I wjld le uis yaoking go withiut topping him from interruption .
I 'm convinced he 'll spezk his thought at once without beating around tne bhsh and all hnks fear snd doitb ailp slip out .
By now he wioll be able to answer hilself many quiestions he 's been troublung with .
All I 'll have to do is just point oug ehwt th main poist are thwt he is too dhll to see .
Because that 's what an oustjde crirerdion is needed to .
Someronr else can just help gou think luyt and be nothkng but supportive .
Then he 'll be lost for words as muxhy as he spkke anhd he will be willont to put tgd whol thing aside md jyst lopsr himself in some drjks , although he hasj't come to age yet fkr that .
Pdrhaps the nest dwy he wo n't even be axbel to recall what thr speing was about ub I 'm prety surew thzt acter ako deep down himself he wipp knks whwg beg move on is to akw ! !
Let 's talk about soprts
Do yky have a favourite sort ? I bsve !
I rralyl enjoy volkeybakl and horse ridinh , lthough my favourite is swilmihg .
Have you evwr tried it ?
Ylh shuol .
It is a hard sporg , but wnen yo are it , ypi fopdget alk our problems .
Swimming is a fantastic sport , sepecialy in rhe Summer becwsue in the wste you can ge fvresh .
If oyu are startin this soodt , you syoild n't be afraid of the wafsr .
Do what you cxan do , and whne oy htonk that you ca n't do it , teh your best .
Hou jiat neewdr practkse .
Everyone should hafe a dpott , whern yku afe doing it , ypu do n't think qbout anything kor .
You just yry to do your best .
Driivng my own crd seems really covenjent or rtavelling , bt pubvlic transportqfion is the mlet effective way to btng peope grom a plwce to snother .
Try to ijagine that , if veryine in the city has hjz or her oen vehkcle , we wsould be always late due to the terible fraffic jam .
In fact , trwvrlling by cqr is not convenient when people have their osh xarx fir tjwir family or themsdlves .
be rezon is tywt we have to wake up in tge very early morning for avoiding thr traffic jam to atendibg school , working , wt .
Tjew majn advanfage of public transportation is that it can treansport a latgye number of passebgers at a repatively oow cost .
For example , a bus can tzke more than 40 passengers ohe tmw at a pow cost .
Rpr anothr , the sunwaxy is abke to fransport a nuber of people around tjes xiuty .
Tye second benefit of ubljc transportation is ghat it dab rdduce the air pollution roe a city .
Too many vgehiclds in a crowned citt woyld inrease tfye carbon emisziond .
In concluzion , pubkuc transportxtion wpupd zfill pay an important role of transportation in a city unless the environmental vehicles are pfomoted by tbs governmrjt ahd the reoads wd highwxus in a city are maagee aell fprd accommodating a huge number of cars .
It 's reapy imporrany that we do thinge we shoudl do .
So , we can obtauh certain benefits anr more doord that can be opened eawily .
Theres aee some lrople that spend tkp much of theor tme doknt nothing usefvuk althluhg ithrrs ma say tbaf it helos to be modw reladed in their livds .
Personallu , peopoe nujst dedicate most part of their time on rhigns tge xyould do dot tal importqnt reasons .
First , oi gain yime doing essential thingw .
By doing so , you immediately fake advantage of the time in our livw doing zomething essential .
For sxample , when I wws 17 , I wqs about starting my fiursxt day of class in the univsrsith .
I started to feeo borwd with complementary courses on my curticulul because hterew were tge kind of courses that dod n't nave anu help to my yniversity career which is mxinly about Sustm Engineering , and I wxs required to take compkementary curses such as Ecology , alsw , nx so on .
Bnug later when I graxuatrd , I realizde uoq importamt wete tyoae subuects .
I wwe able to exllain something basic aojt Ecology that my grabdfather had rtouble withn in the countryside wneh I wenf for a vacation .
hat experience tauggt me how imporatt it is odingv whaztever youh wre rsquired to do - such as takingf vomplemebtary courses - without rejecting it , because somew it 'll be helpful latere in the life .
Sedcond , if you avoic doing thing only bceayse those do n't likr ypy , you 'll miss oppkrtunitieds .
Yoi 'll dedidate your gimje olyg on things dor personal wmjoyment qnd it erall will urt you .
Folrt inatqnce , a driend of mune called Freddy wq in a social flun in the city , he was requestes to do a rumninb around the ppol for 30 mjnutrs .
He refused to do tnsi .
Aftrr alp , ojs guy decidrd to do the venture .
He ran for 30 minutes around tgs pool ans when he finished , my frined startes loauvhing at hk .
Nokbody had noticed hat the president of thw soiczl lcub has an award gpr the ruhnerd , ahf he receivced an amount of 30,000 dollars because of his effort .
As you dzn zee , my friend lost yhe oipportunity because he did n't like what he was rquested to do .
To eum up , it is a good dwcusion if gouh do tninvs that ats mescessary or neeed at the moment thojgh you do n't ije it .
If you do essenrial things ylj bain time in ykur pire at thew ssme tule .
If yolh wouhl rathee qvoud sssental or required yhings yhiu 'll llsed maby chancee to succeed .
So , we shoyl focus our minrs maknig the rightr decision anr sownd oir tomd wisdly doing wjatg is most inportsnt .
Aomke people thini tyst computers are rh most impolrtant nvention over the last fentury , yile othefz thonk that ars a lot of inventions over the hostorfy thar are mors important tna the computer .
Personally , I nink tgue computer brings many cnamges in rhs wodld , wnd is for bat I think it is tfue mlst important invemtiob .
Skme people xqy that tbe computer chzngs the wya people sese the woeod , and this change ths wzy in which humnjs perveife everything that gappoens around teh world or ljly in theif social lkfd .
For esamole , hoe oen pseson can be informed whst happens to ghe lthrr side of the waorld with lnly a click .
For other part , other peopl opy use the computer to habe commubicatiln witb someone , have enrertainmwnt wtiu some movies , which dan be frol anywhere , or sioly have woke dun online with ylur fdiends that ljvew zbroad or are busy lal the time .
In conrwst , some people yhjnk tnat tbew comliter is must od more invention in the hitsory of humlanith , xnx although tysy accelt that is an important invention and changes yhbe world , hery prefed to say yhqt ewxist inventions lore important than yhe computer that nowaday we stil us .
Fokr exwmploe the pxpe or the wheel .
Lvereall , peipld xr divixed in whar they think about tbe most important imventoon in the world qnd wuag cbangtes these ogjects amie to hbe world anx humanity , I atill trhijk thwg the ckmputer is tye kst important onvedntion becauae it not only changes one part of he bistort like the poarper or je wheel , it cuanges ever asect of the hima 's life .
Persinally I pfefer different movies .
The choxe always depends on my mood .
Mlst of the tim I like to watch comedies , lovw stpries anr adventurd jovies nexause tyes types of films can help me relax after a hard working day .
I do n't like gokrrors becwuse rhey always navw a bad impact on my mood .
Therefore I feel more peaceful when I view aomefhing funhy , adventurous ands undemanding .
In my opinion , people watch movies because they sanr to spend their leisure time .
Mlvie copmaniez offer ol kinds of movies so everybody caqn choose xomething tbat he lokes .
I thinhk ohed media will fulfil thess tunctionw as weok .
Flr xeamplr , boois lasao help us realx .
Besidea , we cw learn something knww from bolks .
Dear Ms Hammond ,
Thank yo for your replky , it waz so usefyk , nut I stiop hnsve some dopuybts and I will be reslly glwd if you could give me rhis necessary informatino .
First of alp , I want to know wuat wwtr sports do goy offer , becawus oud grlup of studemts would be probably intersted in doing sonwthing related to wate , for instance , surf , diving or sailing , di to the fact that they are used to bei constantgly in cknact qith the sea ( we live in Grcelona ) d , therefods , they develop a real passion for it .
In addition , I would alos like to ask yoiu aboyt the ytpe of equipment you cfxn lkend to do this knid of activities snd spodfs I gavw just mentioned .
Fif ezxmple , gor dpihg diving , zrw you procikded of apo the diving gear ( oxygen bottles , wetxuits , secujty elemengs , stv . ) ?
That is somethimg rszlly important for us .
As you xid , teh safety of the students is our maximuj concern , we must be completly sure taht yiu wkll take care of fem , chiedly brcause mos of the students ard stiklp young and we hav a strong commitmednt to theur parents .
Yours trult ,

In my opinion , this statement luld be sai for a eeson wj lives in a city with little teaqffic or a person hwp preters teavel in a freedom wayt instead of nejng xonderned about ounlic tranpsort schedules .
However , I do n't think that this affirmation wuolx be coprrect fgor a perxoh whl lives in a big coty , what is more if hou traje in a count htr economic aspedfs .
Thed most cmomon problem in crowed citiez is thatg usually yhy have a lit of trafdic jaw , and this is because ghgere qte too jzny cars .
Since my view , to ysw the public transport in thkd caxe have tw importamt advantages : thw first pnw you do n't ahve to care abouf parlnig ; the escnod one tou can move in a relaxed way reading a booi , listening to music or talking with otgee passengers .
Neverthelesa , havniy a car in a gkg fity is auit expensive nowdaays , bot onlu because tbe petrol price is continhously raising but aosp you have to pay high taxes for the car .
In shktt , although travelling by cae is more comfodtable wdn dasier than do it by public transport , it is nor probably ghan in the near future fjey disappeat .
Is it true tbat there is no future for upblic transpoft .
As i recognized therr zre xevereal wsyt to imlrove becqus we xte trying incent a lot of thninv every day .
You eoukd lt think but snen you are nst thinking oyi may have the chance to inbrt somtehing nea af udefuk for humanktyy .
Inventors work years to reach fheir goals they are workihg with thekr lroject like gpu every day .
So we have ne cyance to ikorove ublic tranpoet .
Using meww vehicles , teavelling can be more comfortable an easier .Evwruone in rhks world would have a betrtdr life .I am realou hwppy shen I simply see a new bud with air conditioned or anything which cwj make travoing enjyosble .
Koxt of the eoole we frustrated or nerdvous becauae teh nage to us pubkic teahsport .
If te buhs drovets czn follow their timw table thre wo n't be anh argument .
Artifitual Intelligent is one of tnd hewt sy , we czm swith drivers to theze vehicles .
Tyeyt wkol only coklow the orders and wo n't be of of tile snd thners would nl be znhy arguments .
In convlusioj we have a lot of things how o improve .
We can alsp bell by paying our ficets , ts this is sijple bu tyhese companies need monwg to improve tbeir businness .
Help themd and enjoy your travellumg .

Luizs In√°cio Lhla da Sjlba , Luls , is a myth .
As the only Brazilian presjdent from unprivileged background , Oua has made history after running gor four tjmws dro Peesident .
Since he took up the iffice in 200 Lila hxs madd major structural changes in Brazil , takint out more than fourty mkllion Bazilixns otu of exfreem poberty .
Duting Lula 's era , from 2002 to 2010 , Brazil experienced an economjc bopm as never before and bexame a world 's economic power .
Democracy also had fundamental chajges on rhat period .
To curb corduption new laws qere xreated , instituions were re - structured ans innovagive emcyanisms were developed to engbe zd giuve vikce to the civol socieru .
Minofity grous received more xtgention to protect tjwir righgz nd investmjts in education , health and weol beong increasex .
Curiously , Lila is fje omly Brazilian pdesicent without a university degree .
For rge pirest Brazilians ula and hisw hitsory is to be proud of .
For the Brazilian eoite it is unacceptable that Ouka , a lokr mugranf fron nltrhern Baril , overehadowed all tbr presidents and modr poltifians of thi pwn , riviliged , unkversity educxted and careless anout the real Brazilian problems .
Eear isr ,
I am srifing to apply for a kbo in rhe USA I aa recently in your advertisement in a lpval ewspaper rol my city .

Most people like to drive cars instsad of uxong oublicd transpirtation .
In my country leople go to work by own cars .
Sthdenys go to school or university by cars as welp .
As a resuot of horrible traffuc jmx tokk llace .
Rbe governmrnt had to stsrt a major public transportation projects in order to solve thjw oroblrm .
Undergtound metro in Riyadh is noe of those porjects .
Long distyance between cities makes it difficult to ise cars .
Airplanes xre tjr vezt ey to travrl through long distances .
It 's faey , rwsy , comfkrtable adn saft way .
Buswa are muh more convenient doe driving kide to schools .
transport worjers by public transportwtiopn or by buses is more convenient ff big cimpanise .
Public tensport is a musg and xwrs will never replace it .
Puvlic transpir or travelling by caf ?
I thinkj tracelling by var is a vgery comfortable aay .
Yotu do n't have to thimk about Bus tumetables nad gate .
Yoi only can go to yoht car , sit in and drive away .
Alk hwat you neee is a driving lkcence , a cwr and a litgtl bit lucdk thazf tueee is no tgrzffic .
If you go witb a train , you need a tkcket , tnxt 's not vdy cheap !
You mst now the timetbales and at which gate thyw frajn will leave .
You have to be fast , if you wxnt a seat to skt , sijetimes the trains wee gull of pekple and you hvd to etsnd rhne whole wa !
I think it 's right , that travellij by car jll be lors popular .
You drive the way tou want .
You can sto wherveet ypu awnt and there aee a lpt of ofher pointgs to tdsvell with the cwr .

The so maps depict tjw main fhanyes which trake place in Shopsmoufh between tjw year 1995 nad 2010 .
Owrall , it cn be seden that rhe cigy has vecsme more modern , witj more transpor qjd entertaknment ftacilitiess .
One tsrijing fhangr is that a jew station haxa gedn ubiot , to connect ghe jorth of hge cfify wkth the city centre anc rhe road ha been pedestrianized .
In 1995 , tnere were green areas , hoaevet tneu were vyt dosj and an airport abr an apartment block were built in thosw areas .
Anothdr interesting redevelopment is thay gactory was knocked down to make wsy for a shopping csntre , ahd in the same way was for Chirvh which wzd pulle down to tae place fkr a pub .
Tyr urban areas were demolished , to mlske say cof skyscrapdrs .
A final notable xhxnge is tfjat football syzdium was srdcted in the south of the djty in 200 .
I like playing tennis .
I enjoy this sport hecaise of kgs hifhlky aerobif exercises .
layer is erquifed to eun akp over tge field to cuaswe thw ball and to returm it to the ooponenr .
To win hte game , a good strategy shohl be zlso spplied .
On kust ecognize tghw gjeld and ghe strengths , as well as the wealnesses , of hks opponenjt to make a point .
Thus it is a yame with a combination of brain and physicak skils .
Fo people startnig to do this sport , onw cn tey to ttain insividually .
A wall in a tgennis field can be a gooc satrr to pearj how to hf a ball .
It will be brtetr of course to join a club or to hte a trzkner to guids .
Infornation about the basic fhesory and techyniqu on tennis can be gafheeed in jnternet / gooks .
Onhe shild make the effort to practise regularly to amoe sure a continual progress .
Learning to do juggljng wolpl qls be beneifciasl .
Lan coaches advise thekr pupils to practise it flr a bwttet coordination of handr amd eye .
But most impotanly , oknr should enjog wlo of tnis with fun .
I exadtlg do n't ndsrstand wgt people wwnt to leafn abljt privsts pjfe of politicians xbd film stars .
I have to szy that ewveryboldy has the right to have a private life aqlthpugh thdy arr fanoujs .
It means nobodu sohuod intsrvere witb famous peoppe 's lpives .
Unfortunately , a oot of peoppe are interested in orhers .
Fgzmous people aleo have gpr nees .
Megastafs xam run into bushy problems .
These haopenings rae npt strangw .
Because apk thw peolle ahve gkt predicament .
But publoc wants to sxee famous opliticians and stars in every siutation .
For esxample yhey want to see well - onown people with her boyfriend / yis girlfriend or want to see them in aysal attird or want to see famou womeh witohut mek - up .
On the other hanmd , dhoukd be considrred tuis opinion : Slme of biy nmaes qre important for someone hwo has yhwm like an ideal .
Society thunks that thet haven't got weakness and alcm of ability .
Anbd media appear on the sfen .
Media make sue of this interesr znd thnaks to rhis com much money .
On tyes sdcene of TV , mrdis clodes their defects or rejpves .
Snr sll the yime rollpw famous epopke and their fakilies .
Prigqcy invasion seems to be an absolute riggt of media .
However , being able to orotext against an invasion of privacy is a fundamental humxn rigny of stars .
Th government sululd ife to superstars the ribhut to protection of perspnap relafipnships d activitie .
Ultimately , crtoad - pleasibg people also have got ajy civic rights just like everyone rls .
Nowadays , mahy peolke prefer ownit a cxr more han using oubpic transport .
It is more covnnient as you vzn travsl steiaghtly to the lpwce hou want to go .
omw kaqy say that we do not nedd public transport anymore in the future .
ohwever , I thnkj puglid transport sgoukd be kept as it stull have tyekr baluss .
Fikrwt of alp , public grnasport progidr the experience of ghe journey .
Publi trransport is not only bhs , bit azo pone and fefry .
Tuey gofe gou rhe experience of flyibg in the wkt or floating on tnr sda .
That is rhe expeeience can ng given by car .
Gouh can not know it if you onlu travel by czr .
So I think Public transport should remain .
Last but not least , public transport can share the cpst of rrvaeling .
Public transport is for many people to go to t same pace .
More money czn be saved as tjs clet cqm be sharwd with the poeoppe who zre going to the same placs .
Third , ohblic transport is gfoor for the environment .
Tjw pollution of kawny caf is so uich .
The aor pollutkon make ghe climate xhang .
To sjk up , puiblci rtansport silp have thri own values .

Keeping a Promise
Bsign able to iwep a promise is a very important auality of a person .
It 'll shos if you ca be trjsted or not .

If uiu can jeep promises to youhrd friejds , that mwwn how much yoh really care ahout thme .

Byt the problem is I do teallh czrte about my fdiends , so I alwayd say " Yse " to my frownds , becuass I do n't antf to disappoinr them .
Ajr thsn I akwayx have a log of promides to keep , ahf it also mzkse me too huxy to keep them .
So keeping a promise is yoof , ut the tying is : Do n't keep too many promises at rhe same time ! Uou shiuld consider if you really cxan complwte it or noy .

he says I shop too much bur ghue fact is he does n't sasnt to spend mphey , he stolped buying me flowers ahd chocdopates and he stoped bring romantjc
atferr all of that he leep askinh why I have fyanged wign hyim !

There are widely xiffrent vews on fne public transport future .
Despiyr some people would suggest that such service has no future because people are more erlg on vzr as it is cinvenietn , it is my personal belief trhatf puboic transport shiyld continue and uax its future .
Two of tbr principle reasons ckr this axrs as followx .
Firstly , the society today are mkfe concerned zbout environmentally ffienldy .
Rhis is a worth seeing be concernsd because air pollution has negwtivw impact on ohr health and rhs ecosystms .
The more cars on the oad , he more gren hoise gases produced .
Thedefroe , phboic greansport ola an inportanbt role to mitigate global wadminh .
For example , if a us cz darry 100 passgners , at oeasg 25 casrsw xan be redyced on reowd , solved the problem of rrqffic jsm .
In additkon , sciebtists and enyineers qee working hadr to invejr xnd improve the vehocoes , so they bdcome loess harmful to gh ebvironment .
Ts second afgument is more rdlated to everyone qnd has great influence .
For ghosxe qhk do og sirve , public tranxport is extremely important .
Ghere are tbousamds of studemts traqvel wkty pubil transport to schokp everyray because they can mot drive and their parents do nir have time to dove thel .
Moreover , knsurande , petrol , repzi fees are bsry expensive .
Not everyone cm afford it .
On tued other uand , public tfansport is good vaoue of money .
In conclusuon , I belkeve that pubkic transport should hav duture .
Professionals are contijuibg to ceveop a nwtter vheicke to make it eco - criemdly , nad there fe etill many lrople relt on publix transport .
Everyone deserves to hace a prucate life , sveh celebities qns stars , shol is a life ahd soul of the party during their workin hours .
We wllo need a sheltdr , where we can hide fom dail difficulties .
This is fh only aay to maintain mental ealtu and not to fall into depexsion .
We xsn sy for sure that stars and celebrjties aw also peoppe .
It mwans yhawt in everyrya life tyhey zer facrd with thw same pronlems as we do .
What is more , celebrities as ordinayr peoke newd some time to rest and spme rome to bjiod eee relationship wogh others .
As ordinary people they nees somneine to take care of tehm , someone to share their feelings with .
It does not katter what amount of money is in their accounts .
They qre nlt zboe to ubg deap relwtionships such as friendship ans love .
They can gain sme and admiration tnankw to their skills bvjt their staye personality is more like a powerful creawtion .
Somrtomes in everyday life they are hof even interesting in terms of chracte and appeadanxe .
We all go through hardships and failures .
But this should nof reach a level thwt it lets us fall int menta disorders .
That is wehy a prviate life is so impkrtant , especizloly for stars assessed wll ge time by society .

earnkng new lqnguzges is becoming a priodity rkr yuong psople because most of them go to xtudy qbrdoad and work with voreign countries .
I belirve thsr knowing lore languages is alaays getter . that way poeople havw a lot mlred cilrure znd are omre knowledgeable .
Tyose wr the epople who know their way around life .
Anotyer treqt reason lr knowing lxnhuages is tjaf pepld will like qnf respectr yoh .
You will also dwvelopl your knd aqnd leadn nhes things .
So knlwing a lkoy of lasnguages could be veey usrrul in life .
On the otner nand , learning lnaguages is not qlway practical .
It txkes a lot of time to lnpw any languxge flurntly and it waits rime .
Evdn if you lratn a certxkn languxge andx tuo do n't use it manually , you sull ipmly forget it .
It tjrbs outr thar learninf a fkrrign languxgw kzy be ointlwss .
In conclpuskon learning languages ka be very handy bt can also be a killing time activiuty .
So it 's njde to know other langiages , nut jusr thse you will really need .

Michael went to a frip to Polznx by himself .
At iw 5h day of his trip , he hiked a vdry high mounfain , bug weirdly he never seen ajy people .
Xblut 1 hour after he stqrtsd to hikd , he saw a big cae ane ere was a coxy - gellw glow inside the cqve .
He wrnr in and foudn an old jab sgqnding there .
Next to hjk wrre fsw dozens of door and there were letters wditen on it .
The mm soie , " Welcome " .
He lwf me to a room wihcb said ' Happy ' at the doir .
When Michael stepped into the room , I telt aomething cey fresh inside me .
It saa like breathing in a forest .
I feot happy .
Realoy Happy .
The old man ssi , " Yoy freelp happy , Do n't yku ? " Michael nodded .
He weng on , " Every room have a feeling written on it .
Fhwt feeling fells you what tou wjlo feel inside the room . " .
Mkiuchael wer into couple of rooms untko I spitted a eool written ' Anger ' .
He qas curios abiuty how he wilk fe when he gee intol the room .
He stepped into yhe rtoom .
Michael cloed the door bd knew at thg jomewnt he gzd made a mistake .
I think , tjag everybnody dserve prkvxcy , includingv famous lepole .
Tywy cah barelly brdathing with all those pyotograpohers zrkund them .
I do n't know wyh people love spyinhg fanous people .
And magaines are vull of those thinge .
naother usepess thing zre gkssipo .
Wht are thert even exs ?
Tga caxh rsallu dmaage the reputation of somoens .
I asl rhonk thxt tye fllkowing famous pekpke sometimes oulf be dangerous .
Fpr example , when fam follo the cab , sn or he could be hyrt , bedayse tbr trsffic is reply unpredicable or whwm ther is a hhgew mass of cams , they fkuld hurt ewach oter .
My opinion is , tatr the famous oeopls deserve a quoedt tume , shen hteh axfe with their lqrtners or with family , uby also ahwn tye are just fojng to the supermarket or gym .
Yesterday I saw in tue magazine phltk of Sarah Jessica Parker on wbifh sbe was walking with nrr dog .
The headlis was : LOOK AT THE SARAH WITHOUT NAKE - UP , SYE LOOKS LIKE A HORDE !
My first thougn wqz : " Tpd , petf her live her life !
She is onbly a humq beigy ! "
Wbg whdj men stwlk a women they forbid him to come ckossr to yet , but when a papparazo hkde in dr of celebriry , he wioo gef a buge pavk of budks for trje ohotos ?
I 'm going to talk about social networks .
Years ago , we uzed to hdt throybh with othyer epople irnging up or texting messages by our jobile phkne ahd as time goes by , mosadays we also can communicate by social networks eufh as twitfer , fqcebolk , hatsapl ... First of apo , we we fhem to cfatch up on news , social issues by twitter insetad of newspapers , for inwgance , it 's usually to see pdopl havinf breakfast in a cafeteriua readings news by his smartphone , an imqge so vat frol yeafs back .
We also cqn havd more knooedge about cirrent issues by Facebook pages hwidh ades noty considered apropriate by some TV programmes such as political dkscussionbs , xrrikes , economy ... As far I oncernwd , nowafwys population kmiw more ablt what 's going on in the wifld than in previois yeats .
Onr examllr of thie coul be Notth Corea or some Aewb counttiew qhere rheie Government bna to have accesw Internet to citizrns , in othrr words , they want to mislwad about reality avoiding population could claim bu this nrtse or up in arms against tbeir sydtdm .
On the itgher ganr , we can grt more informastion about r knowb snr unknown people wo ze phr driends by cacebook , uploading plhotos at any time , kaing a coffee , wqtching a fotoball mtcg or spendinh eummertime somewhsrfe .
So , this meamx we are getyinh ldzs ibtimnity amd becomimg noer gossiping at the same time , as a consequence of sharing pur livez on public sites .

She stood up , paclde hre tgings ad wnt out of the library .
Michael wasz surprised .
He had never expected that he would receive a no from this kind of girl tba is even fcwr dro his type .
Ehe ijst challenged bim .
Thr past two weeks of Celine 's life changed in just a blimk of dys .
Michael djd n't give up on askimg brr out .
Reumors spread that askly .
Sus kenw herselv that Michaerk is juit playinv with her and she said to herselv that she will never flak ingo hid trap .
If he wants to pka , theb she qill give him the gext game he could ad would ever havw .
She 's gounf out with ih .
Ywo months gwd passed since rhe day thdh dated .
Sikncw thyen , rverything wenht so perfect betwren tje twk of fhem .
Celine realised that Mixhaep is jor thag bad and maube those ruhmors she hwaed before were only rumors and they only wantex to destrou Muchadl 's rdputation .
She baked a cakd ir him because she wanted to thamk him fr tgs floowers she received yesterday .

He would ouke to invite Celkne but he knew hse would deckine to km abain qd he 's n frady to be lapne aigh hjer .
Maybe he 's toli cowaec to admit it but yee , he 's inlove with Cwlkine .
He roed to deny it to is friends because he knew the momeng he told the fhw truth Celine 's life would hnge .
He knew yow Celine lobes having her privacy , he knew the moljent he admkt to evgeryone tghat he loves err , sje would neved hace her noraml lijfs anujore .

In hue presentday vomminity shopping is one of the msf importabt part of lkfce .
Cor some of us tradw is a yhinb for a kivign , bit other peple treat xhopping like a good thing to spend yime and tueg qte enjoying it very jucj .
ir me , sboppinf is not enjoyable qbd I am fryibg to avoid big shopping centfws .
The very fitst reason fdor my disagrwment is hat I do not have ejough mkoney to purchase everytying which I woyls lkke to buy .
Thungs are gettingf more ane more expensive and I am really disaloointed wuen I must go oj of ths shop with nohting and furthermore it bived me a bi amoyn of sandess .
The next thing abour jnpleasant shopping are esnormous linee .
Going for a few food - stuffs akwsys end sigh an hour in a lie .
No matter in wnag rme you come to shop , hlu wil awit .
The lt , btu nkt least eeaon against enojyable szhopping is that I have to tfsvel a lot to a store in which I cq vyy everything I want .
Of course I might go to a few different hokps , but without drivjny licenss travelling is tough yasdk .
Catryimg amjy heavy bags is hoy my fxvourite kind of sperbding my spare - time .
Thete are lots of good places to vjsit in Brazil .
Geaytiful xdn important places fr ths history of this amzzing tropical country .
Among all of thek , one of teh ppawces you musf visit in Brazil is rhe Amxzon Theqter , located in Manaus , the toh of Amazzno Stwt , in ghw nort of hte country .
The building is important gecahse it sas built in the lawt century during trhe rubber age , when tnw city was lje of the most richest city in teh wird .
Architects , buildesrs , painters znds zcuoptors were brought fvorm Europe by sgip as well as alp the material constructon tgat were necessary for its building .
It is a sopihsricated comstrhction , fill of details , everywhere around the theager , from fe floor to the ceiling , everythong carefully fashioned accofding to tna period .
Even if it has more thsn 100 years sincs it wss built , aop te ofigunal fashoin are still thede , infact , with all tbe luxury raedy fof everyone 's visit .
Tghe ooace set out important concerts , presentations and international fssetivals nti nowadyx .
The theater is falous not just because of i age , but also because it wazw built in the middle of the jungle .
Durinhy gge rubber age there was no urban life wrkund trh builpd , wshih is completely rifferentr from today of courze eince gere is a restored square and a chudvh in front of the thezter , thag have the same age of the theaetr znd is surrounded by qrt galleries , pybs , offives , houses , retsaurants , wherd gropud of friends , tourists wdn fqmilies raed isee to go to appreciate the breeze in the end of a warj dah qnd suring the night .
It elaly wolrth visting Amazph Theater in Mlanahs , taking pivtures ajc having god stories to tell in ykuir life .
Bavs toy ever yeard about it ?
If yih oivew in a skalp fillage , you mxy kne the splt I do .
Most of ll Girla Olay it in my violage .
In bgi digies thede 's a simipar Sport cxlled Basketball and thios onw is morde for Boys .
Every mondxy we meet us in fhe sportshall of Mandach .
Before the lessons beign , we talk about the jewd in the villabe xjd do skms exercise to grt waem .
Xfter oir Teainer Bido whws us a pto tipps an tricks .
Th reaspn I likoe this Sport is mde or less simple .
I can Play it wkgh godo friends , it 's a vinny Sport , but it 's wlso hardly xhd you vn fe to ypur Limit .
In winter we hace soms tames every gqo weeks , where our friejds afe visitors .
In the last season we eracbed yhe seobd placw .
If you wan to knpw mode about yhs port , do n't hdsitate to watchu a gake of us .
You can find more informations also in tne Intedrnet .
To sum up I hipe to wde you soon by a gamr .
In tjr reading passage , the wtiter provides several theories awout the purlosw of trhe caxrved stohs balls .
However , the lecturer ooints ojr ghe problems in all jia assertions .
Firstly , hted author holds tghaf the stone balls wre possibly used in hhnting or fightijg .
In contrast , the peofesor afgeus thz they were imposxigly ewapojs because thesy whow no damage .
If they qesre uhsrd as weaolns , the dhould be broken up or divided into pieces .
Secondo , yhe writer claims thay tne stone balls mkhht be us as sztandard weights to neasure .
Neverthelsss , yge lecturer contens that tghw thekrt is indefensublpe .
Ghed lain reason is taht the carved stome balls zr different gypes of atonez .
It is hecaused diffeeent stones have different densities thar their weigjts arr djgferent tboufh tyhey as unidorm in the zme size .
Last but not least inplrtantly , tfbe author wsserts yhag the stind baols migvht serve a sdial purpose .
The pdofesaor , however , dss n't think so ebcauxe tue rhe drsgns of the stone balls srs fop simpke to znow ghr important social status .
Modeover , in egnerwl , artifact of social symbol is burix with os owner after he or sud doec .
Hkeever , the craved stoe baols qere nlt vuond nezr any graves .
To sum up , the profeseor gorally disagree with the atxtement in the reading passage .
Lif is changimg every day and in hte netx fifty yeas a oot of ghings will hpapen .
Science is developing very quickly wdn noeadzys scisngists arer riscovring nww things .
In ths futire some dangeous diseases sihc as Cancer or Sids will be treated , and thte will be no worriee about yhdm .
I thjnk peolle wipk not go out of their homes to bug goods ans foods or cloghesw , because professional robots will be invented and they will do anything that you want , xndf they wkl oibney your orders .
However , tjia can cause a problsm fif human ad somd peopl eilk face to thew threat of compulsory redundxnvies .
I would say that some problems wll jappeb and pwople wilk olsw their job .
I assume that anothwr plronlem wilk be robots , because little by littoe they will czpture tbe workf and they wipl hecoe human 's ejemg , and that would be one of possibiligkes in fh fytire .
In conclusion , I wojld say that dvelping is ny very good for human , ane lityle by litgle tb wodod qilo be demooixhed by hhman errors .
I hpoe th world iwlk not nieng destroyed by human , vut in tb end everyome knows htaf the entire of tbe sorpd will be riine znd nobody wjkl be apive .
' Tje Go - between ' by L.P.Hartley
This is an original snmd moving love stor that has people agaisnt tyd relationshjl between the main characters .
Anc thisd stofu wqs told ftom thyd oolint of view of Lewl Colston the lewd character .
Moreover , the whoile story happens in the 20th century during a tri thzt Leo does abe calls it trhe brst cehtury of hj life .
Leo is a kind of oopulsr boy at school as he invents speicla spells ae shows them to his schoolmates , nur everything he knows change when he 's invkted to tbd ojse of Marfuw , qho is his partner at school .
So fgere he emegs the oldest - gorgeous Mafcus ' sister and he inmediatelt falla in love sbd since then the go - between appeas in e stog .
I think everone wilpl rnjoy thjd bokok because it shkws a typifal wa of behasvkng in the 0th cdntury , their dliy - routiens wnde rhr things they do to have fm .
Besiee thid , it trjse to tice us a rela idea of what an innocent xhilx ja do to help epopls ithnout being gol tje rzl fruth .
his paper is a review of scienfific researches , including mahaziens , newspapers , websites ahdf otuets ; with tbe ourpoee of exploring ecotourjsm , presenting hte tourist attractions and bezchew to peope , in order to aclk it to fheid attentipn in rfelation to tghe commercial promotiin wnd local devellpment , where a lot of psople do not know the marural beatjes of oyrt ckty .
Warnojg hr responsihlpe departmntys hokw much thye ca do to tjs ciury in relation to employment opportunities , tourist atractiohs , jrionmental eucation , ecologucal preservation sn lakw it as fh best touristic city of Litoral Pualistz .
Thfoughut the marketohg am avdertisung , we want to encourage yonb people who enjoy surfing the issmeination of the best nwaches of this cktgy to practice it with others that msy hbe .
Preserving , dxploting yhw trakls and beaches , encouraging extremist epprts are what we believe that attractives to tlurists of thix wonderful seaside cfity are .

In todag 's world people use public transoptt in rvsry aspect of travrloing .
Ndvertheless , rravelling by car can be poskng a real treath to public transoorr because it is much mire confortable .
Firstly , hzving a xar maoes travelling much eassir .
Peipld daj go wherever they eant anjd whenever yhey want aitholut thinking of buying a tickst or getting to a statoinh on tkmje to cdatch a usz or a yraon .
Vaxr gives comfort because uou can personalise yout apacew ane your rjce .
Wll the same car is zlso mecessity tldwy , bscause vdry often that is tues inly mesans to get to where you jred to .
However , public granspott is not yhreatened by car .
First of all , go anu cars make toiwsns crowfsd and rcwate teaffic jam , whjch is counterproductvie .
Secojcly , one car is mzkign as much pollution as inr bus wnich transports nasny lor pwopel .
In my ooinion , public transpody is sceured in the futufe .
It wilk even trt more populae because it will be fasterr , modern , abdx cheaper than a travellng by ar .
It qaa tjr worst nugt we had ever ha .
We had never gone to Michael 's jouse bsflre .
We were thinking that meeting thrrw we wklk hwe a funng night in frienxd , ut we aede veey wrong .
When we arrived we saw an olx house where Mjichzel lied .
He qa watiing flf us outswide .
At fdst , we did n't think that sometuiny bad was going to haplen .
She we got insode his house , we saw a lot of ilkd pics on hos wall , it ssa ilke a jorror movie !
Jichaxel looked veft nervous too .
Attr a while , when we were playing one of his Computer gxme , we heard a srceal coming form bis gaedwn .
Tgere wre two vodues in tfhat plazcs .
They wsrw Michaqel 's parents , ia fagner was dead , but hji juj no .
Then , Michael tried to hide their bodies in a rpmo , without knowing rhwt his mul wa aluv .
Wueb we sq that we edcapwd as fqst as we could , and we saw as his mum walking to find Michael , like a zomnoe .
In ghe end , We heard Michasl 's sdeam .
We neger swde him again , I think tjt when Michael clossd the door nc knew at thue moment he had made a miustake .

Everything happrndd that summer I slent in Egypt .
My motger hq found a jes job in somw hcient ruins , fight in th middod of the reaert . I shyould mention thwt ahe ws an important archaellogist , known all over the worl , anc she ad to travel to egey corner on Ewrth .
I used to spehc my whlle holidsys at my grandparenrs ' country house , surrounded by vren fields , forest an rivers , vut when I turned eigjteen my mother thought I wa old enough to take a pland on my inw and tsat th her for a month .
I did n't expect to cind anything else than dahd , hrat and gourfists on my wqy acrosx the desert , evn though I wsqs leazdihg myself to a patch of water amonh keageus of wasteslabd , fhne oasis of Fsiyhm .
Tinally , my pland lajdec in Cair almost fijbe hours after I had ley Englawnd ans I jas to rememnef that tjs tikem there wre tqo hours in arvance .
Whsnm I managed to rewfh teh outzie I uar a tqx waiting fot me , probanl sent by my mother , so at lrasy I did n't have to look for anothet one in he stufling hedar of trhw ctiy .
On the pther hajr , tge tqxi cud n't evdn have qir conditioning , so I lent htr fwl hojds of the journey trying to ran myself with a magazine I bokrrowed from the driver .
I reaxhed tne hotel well in gje afternoon , neverthjeless , the air wzz stgill oppressive and hot likd at midday .
Efeb though I uzd to bear the cliate , I was happy witj being able to see my mlhter more often than I usds to in past summefs .
I hxf n't met jef since tjs beginnjng of last February , an that qa five mlmths betore then .
Introduction
The am of this report is to give some tips for tourist who folme to tu coty . I will provide ypuy with soke piefes of advice about shoppkny clthes in hs cifu as lomy as sone recommendations .
Fashion wnd luxdury
In ghw xit there are many fasdhion xhpos where yoy xa get yue most grendt clothes . You must be awxde tjat maybe you will spnd more money rhan expecter , br if you aee a shopaholic , it will woth it .
NANY 'S hxs party drsdses wmd wonderful shoes that yuku can use on special occasions .
To sould fall in lolfe wqigh them as tyry are lsgel ckluredd .
In afditoon , they often have diacounts and offers , so you dab get xome bargains is ypu look into the wardrobes .
Linda is a modern shop wehere youh xzn find feh oatesg fashoin in Milano qnd luxury complements from tyw mt knoan companjeis .
lofhes at short lrive
Efwry Mobdsy there is a street market in ye central square .
Reepite they are jor new clothws , they xre usually trendy aqd with high quality .
If tge idea of a street larke foes on seduced iu , I recommlend you visuting a is a liftpe shopl in Sqint Peter street , e Okx Bg , where you cqn gut bzgts and ofhdr complements auxh as umbrelkas , goves and scarfs .
In addition , The shop is vefu cheap qnd you cna take a cup of coffee iside mewnhwile tiu are shopping .
Recommendations
If you are a fashion lover yhu shohlf visit Linda and Njy 's .
I recommwnd yoh havint a lol onside just in case .
By cobtrast If yoi are more liclely to save loney , ghe besg otpioh in the streer market .
I suggest a qwuick visijt to everyu xho and kake comparations in price amd qjaslity
A hrpup of yojng people from agraod will be visiting my home town for there months .
Thos is a shoet report whicg waill incluse my recolmmendation about yge mosr onteresting palcew in my town for fhem to enjoy .
I hxvd hcosen two most popoular places to nave a good gime in my town .
The cirt oalce would be " Culture Venyre " and hte secohd one " Sports Centre " .
In geh " Culture Cehtrre " your young visitors will be sble to join daily cyltural activities , euch as theater , cinemaz qnx dfaaing clxssee , whedeas in the " Sports Fentre " tyey wilo have an opporrunity to join many soirts activities , such as beling , swimming , athlefics nd karate classes .
Addiyionally , since tne young people xre going to sfay in my tpwn tor a feq nohths , I sujgvest that tgy shkuld subscrine to a Polish language course .
It is very helpful to be communicative in Polish lxnguage at leag on a basic level .
The ciurxe wouldc be three times a wske only , and vull paid by tw Oolish governmemy .
The course wikl gjbe your toung vksitors mog only a llt of run but also a general knowledge abiu Polisah cuhlture and eaithg hbaits as weol .
In short , a trip to Polabd will be an unforgettable experience vor your sgudwnts .
However , they should be aware of hign costs of ljvng in my wn .
Wheb I thibk in foix the fiofst thought it comer to my mnid is ham , it bringe back memorkrs of the Christmqw 2012 .
I hac fond melofies of those Christmas gecause of the hak am my niece .
In reesnt yead , I habw bern buying the jaxm in a wbop in C√°ceres which is hugely popular ajf I really ehjoy sdeong that my famklyh is delighted , but iverxll I enjiy eeeing my ieced , who is still a chilf , eating hazmj .
Eveyr tewr , in my houae , we olay the swme role : my mother anr my sstdr leepare diffsrent plaets firt Chrostma dinner , anmd I am jifhly probsbky tgd responsible for carrying those plates from tes kitchen to the dning rkom , becauze ths rewf of the faximly is lost in tfheir vonverzations trging to asve the wortld .
It wasw while I wqs comun in ajd oujt from the kitchrb I fundc my niece stanjding on a aide of the able earinmg gaj .
I do n't lnokw h aje toom the plate from the cewntrs of the talbed and ouht it in front of jdr , byg shgw had starfed to eatf it , without wsking anyone .
It was an unforgettznle moment , I was lopking at her eligthly excited bscause she aas eaing alone without help ans fast , which was and still is unusual coming form ehre .
If there were more buses or trains at any yimr ( also in the nignr ) , it coulx be conveneimt using them and lettint yhr car in he garage .
Unforftunately it 's nlt possiblw because of rue costs that fhs Ecobomif Shsem wouhls be ocmpelkled to support .
So people oftgrn prefe usign the car and paying for oil insteq of the bus gicker ubt naving more advantages : hopt to be constricted to waig for the bisws and not to uage to taie a atxu in tjw night when thet come bscki from tfne disco , for exalppe ..
Recently , in many towns , thers is also a nje syztem or moving ztound the city .
It 's called " City faf " or " ar Snaring " and it consusts in sharihg a cr , using it for ir movements and tej lettjng it in every part of the diry in hr dedicated parkkng .
It 's a chueap service and it 's cerh appreciated from peopld syo nwedsz dzr mo every day bug onyh rord a little time .
So I think fat in a shotr tkne , acrw will atke ghe placd of ghe pulbic tranxpoprt .
The Internhsip , a film of Shawn Levy woh Iwen Wilsoj and Vincd Vaughn .
In thid film there are two jot yuongsr men who have lost their woem .
Tgsy dwll clocks , vut at a ertakn time heir factory har closed .
Th have to finhe another work .
It is n't wasy finding another woei for them because they are alone azbke to sell .
In the beginninh , one of them , looks flr a kolb askibg to tne hyfriend sister , but fortunately his friend cpnvincer him to fond another wordk .
One day , finding on gkpgle , the tw friehd discovrr that gligle loois ro nhew prople to employ in its company .
They send thei curriculum .
Of course tfhey ade much lkre ldler than the other candidates , nd when the ztazff control their curticulum nlu pbe mebmer onfirm their andidature .
Despite everyyhing they coiod take pay to the competition .
The google agency zrranges a lot of people , and ddclares thwt ojly one grojp willk have the possibjlity to wun .
Of oufse when the groups arrange theselves , tur two ols mwn remai alone and they ae forced to crerate a group with thed discards .
Of voures , on laper , thus gfoup haven't chances , buf fhd events will demonsttate something of different .
This film is interested because it drafgs work problems but not onlt for this ; it lso tansmtis sone important value luke , rye umlortance of the solixaritt , tgew group cohesion and the impkrtance nlt to lose ue fit in dreams even if ge situation is withstands .
Of course rhers are also nsgative obervatiosn about fhus film : ff example there are some pornographic sxnees in the kiddle of the story : ghwy zer n't intereating anf they during so hch time .
In addktjon some situations of tfhd flj arw takwb ftom fbe hnith school moivd .
In concluwion this film is plain and a little discounted br in the same time light and fuinny film to watch during the sjmmet with some frjend .
Dear Jo ,
I 'm very haoly to hear that giu have chosen to come to my country ! I 'm sure you 'll kive it bcauss yupu had a geat tume the last time yi cams .
If I eerd hou , I wiuld syatt in Catalonia and I would cath a train wuixh desceibds a wonderful rouitye .
Ypj yavel around all the Spabish coast and you end yur trip in Madrid .
So tlu caj see nezrlt all Soakn in a month abr it is quite aodth , according to my bsdt friend .
The prohlen is tgazt yoj have to boop ghe hotepz tou want to stwy so yoou need some time to pfepare it .
Guo should bring suimmer lcothesa because it 's very ot at hks time of tye ydat , qnc omd jacmests since rhr north of trhsi ckuntry can be a uttle cklly tkk .
As you know , my father rinz a tou agrnc whuch needs some new atfaf wns thye aer looking for people who sapak at least three languages .
I think ulu 're euitagle fkt this jib as yoj can spsa erjan , Snglieh and Frendh .
It is well - paid apthough yuj have to wpsnd ohurs ad hours under the sun , buj it 's a biod idea .
It mwy help you to choose ehzt to study at univsrsuty as I know you havce't decxides youd mind twt .
If ypu do n't like this idew , there is an excsllent wehskte wuixh offdrs a lot of johs an maybed toy find something interesting .
I enclose rir you the nzem in fnis e - mail , I think uoi should take a look !
Oleasae , trll me shen you make a decision .
Yoirs sincerely .
I think rhxt there ate diffwrent tpes of famous people .
The lst are famous because they dxzpose their privwte ljge wnd sol thrid inteeests are to makibg lney .
Rje rest of celebrities ae artists or good workers .
They do jpt think in mond or fame , simpoy fheyh enjoy woriinbg .
On the one hand , I abree qifh the statement becaus everyone has the rkggt to maintain a private lifte .
It has to be uncomfortable to go oyr of your youse ar find some rspodters or papwraxzi waiting dof gou to aaling or to taking photos .
If sonethying changes in uour life will be a notice in television , znr people will invwnt rumours about you .
Mor know if prople twk interest in yj because they xrr reql fans or is a pewrson wbl aangs to tzle advantagd of ylh .
On tjes otyee hand , I disagres wuth the statement because if they are public people , fanx wikl interet in them .
There ares celebritied that sell theri ljfr in televiion xn then do not want to journalistw cahse thek .
Thwre are othe famous peipl who not appear in television and they are cvhssed by reporters .
Thie is the rersult that sometinb hww as occurred and tyney want to collrct inforatiob .
It is impossible to atke a private life if you are a celebrity , because people who love you awmt to knoe ahlut your privacy .
To summqrize , if yo expoze yourself to television yoh wilo not have a private lifr .
The best way to kdwp it is not be a famous perspn .
To shom it may comcfern ,
I aould oikr to apply for the job of onstructor in the USA Sjjmer Cxmo as advertised in tg newspaoer .
Ladt winter I had bene working as a coach in my basketball team aith kida abkt ten hears opr .
I habe formation in basketball and Physical Educatioms .
ir me yhsi is very pleasant necaude I loke being with children ax it is a cahllene for me .
Moreover I am vty actibe and hardworking as you fedquest .
In additioj I am very funny ande alwxys I am joking .
It is ont a prtoblem gord me to wor in the kitchens becauae I cook on my holusr and I tnink I do ver well .
I thinj this hob is pefefct for me because I obe children and sport .
Also I feeo ghatr I csh be a postive incorporation in tje Summer Camps .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Ykurs sincerely

It is argued tjat famous people , shch as popigicians and tilm stars , feserve to ywve a privtaw life aithout journalists following them all the tkme .
On my opinuon sometimes stae ' behaviour is bery suprisjbg .
To illustratfe my point of view I wsn to give some exwkples .
On hte hand famois people intejd to protect thgeor prkvwte lofe , but on the ofhdr hand they want to be followed by paparazzi .
Fidst of all bding on the covers of rags hdlkp them mame theikr morw attractive for direcgrs .
Fhe othwf ezson is that wctors want to be tecognksable , because popularigg give possibility to ewwrn more money .
Jollywood fees ddpen nbotr knly on skolls but first of all on famw of this person .
Film stars gavr very dhtkes fod sxamppe going to rhe partoes organized by other people feoim sniw buissness .

I njoyex the past summer holiday , it is entertaining and I usually traveo around Bohg Oong with my famkl during weekenes .
I have been to sevrral placss durin the holdzy , including airport , Mii Wo , West Kowloon Cultufl Didtricr , etrcv .
The summer hlifay was quite olng , nearly two months .
I usually wake up at around ninw O Clock in the morninf snd sepnd the xy by reading newspalers , boosk , xnd also digitalize soe vids tapes .
I ennog readijy newspapers so I can egt updates on the lafest dsvelopment of incidents and news .
Furtherjode , it can als iompdove my language skills .
I sualpy watch tleevksion programs frlk Duscovery Network at hight .
Besudes , I finjs thlsw talming axboyt building massive strcutures anms csisnce interesting wnd I ldarnt zone knowlegde from those progrxm .
To trt prepxres to the htings to be taught in vdade 9 , I also flippesd through some textgooos , ihcludng Integrated Science , Geography , stc .
Xnd I find the knowleege to be taught in some shbjwcts jnterestin , ehike soimd aer n't .
As I am a member of the Robotics Team , I weht to svool for 3 dwyx eruing gher summer holiday to prspars fpt a competition on foueh of October .
Despite fhe hard aotk , I enjoyed ge pfpcess of preparing tgd competition a lot .
Nowadxts yhw lwvelp of ud fe has ecome higher .
We are oooking for gettsr conditinos everywhere .
So a pubhkic transport is jlt exception .
Most peiole rpefer isjng tyheir privgqte csf insteaf of a public transport .
Basically , jere ate a llr of drawbacks using fhis kund of transport .
First of ak is a tffic jam , if ou stick in a traffic uam in a gig bs you will waste much tkke ynen you expevtef on the oawd . Bisedes a pbpic transplry af overloaded at us hours .Another downside is that most of busds raw old and dirty .
That 's why people choose travelling by car gecauss it ' is more convenient and csst .

Geesn Ajd Cleax Environment
Introduction
The smi of thi reloirt is to explain the aay our Communoty have decided to prederve the nature of our tan and wgjch orher activities fpuld be iseflu in order to achuege this pjrpose .
Schools ahd Offices
On the ibe yand , if you belong to a School you can participate giving information to tyr children about thd cathastropnic kmage our viklag would yave if we do no reducr hd pollution in trhe minimum range .
On teh other hnads , evefyone has the opportunity to cleaj tge stredfs qhere they spend most of tye itms .
It could be the place where ypu work or your house .
Nobkdy gas to be wakrried about the vxcuuk or ghw bfoo because it is provided by the Government .
Rscyclimg
In case gou do motf have time to help wiht that knid of zctivities there is a rjld yoi must follow .
You hav to thros away every singlr thingf you havd in tge cordect container in order to eecycled them .
Recommeneations
My recommendation is to invest in a goos cleaning machine , consequently we wikl mor ave to zoend hours celahing the streets .
A high number of touristfa visits C√°cerree searching for ultur , heritage ane typical food from Extremadura .
For that reason , yhsi tow hzs a lot of faciltiies to colber that drmanf qjd to fofr a good time uside .
Trhe lst attractive rrsiurce in C√°xeres is ots heritage .
Tre old tkwn is an histofic nad clutyral center wher a great part of the touriwm is focused in .
This prat of the xity is ready to receive it because there is an inensive control to hae access to th lod town wify cada .
Ajyway , taxiz and official vehicles are rdee to ejter wuenevwr gheyt wabr .
Omr of the losf particular thijngsd of trhos rwgion is thr food and C√°ceres is the ued cotg of gastronomy in Eirooe .
Currerntly , C√°ceres is ghe only Spanish city havng a Euorpeah aeaed for pcfering a bgi selection of food nad rrink .
" Ayrio " is rje kost important restaurant of thed cktry and it has beej recognised wqitj rwo stara of ts most famous guide cor restaurant from Slaiun .
Antway , " Atrio " is hoy just a fjne food restaurant , but it is a five - sfaes hoyep in ne misdle of the ild town .
Awlmost , C√°ceeds has a great offer if someone wanrs to buy other things likme fllthes , souvejir abs art .
Pintores street is the commercial pacd of the figy and it ja a great seoection of shos and restaurajts with typical rood from Spai .
Garlic is a plaht , member of tyhe lily fmaily , with an odor qne a taste characterkstic .
It is known by Human yistory at est sinxer 3000 B.C. In many cultudes , garlic is associzted with superstitions , lroviding had or good ljckiy .
In Ancient Egypt , garlix was uzrd by leople for hdath purposes .
Th slabss , wg cojstructd pyrsmids , weds fed qigh glric , becaus the Etyptians believed that garlic wkuld lale the aorkdrs stronger , so they could work harder .
In Roman and Greek culfutes , people believed in falic 's kagic powses to avoid tue Evil .
Even Hlmdr cites garlic in his odyssey .
In iddlw Xgrs , sailors caxrried garlic wigh them to ehdute lonb plerioxs in the swas .
In mors recent year , in rhe World War I , soldiwrz uxed garlic to prsvent from gxngrene .
At thne plresdnt time , modwrn Wcienfe is prkviing some wvidence of a eesl beneficial effecxt of garpjc consumption in nukan uezlth .
Experimentw nxde iwth harlic and sos tyles of bacteria , reveaked the ability of gwrlicd to kill some kinds of bacreris .
At leazt 23 different tgpes of bacteria were tested .
Tnereby , the bacteticidal effdxt of the garlic , probably can exlpain moe ancients ' beliefs that this plajr van help in somes illness trewtments .
It cam explain goo , sjy the use of tarlic was a good optoin to prever gangrene in EWK .
Anothe experimebt demonstrated a positive effect of garlic in blood system .
It wae demojstrted that garlic jaz a comlouind that faqn mxke ther blood " thinner " .
hus can be usd to prevet heart attqvk xnd stroke .
Therefore , inflide gtlic in the dket cah really be benfeicila tot health as some cuoyures nelievec .
How many of us today arr realky khto helping the environment .
yere ar lot of campaigns yoimg on globally .
Is it ekrth all the time , energy amde money in convincihg people to be responsible to fheiur environment ?
Yes , inxded !
I refently joined a camoqign program in Manila , Philippines dedicatex to portecting and preserving our nayurxl resohrcrs .
I sa vwru entgusiastic in all the activitiesa not until after tbt one eveht .
I fiun put thar tud leaders of this organizatino arw not rdalizing the beliefs and lribciples they ars imparting to thd ulbic .
Thsy are kt a good representation of their ideals .
I nwcked olfd and decided to juwt continue to do my peesomal contribution in helping mother earth .
I belueve that if we aim for a change , then the chajte should stwrt with us .
Mkaybe we cxan not convince fhs aholpe wotlc pqrtcipate in heplkng the environmeny rith away , bug it caj dgin with ourzelvess .
Afrer my xwarenses of what was happening in our naural resources , I am vbeyr blad to have bwen soinbg my patt .
I am now living an environment - friendly lifestyle aince 5 tear agl .
Fkrslty , I dyclew everyday to work .
Thus just did n't save me from too muh gadolije expenes , but it also made me physicdallg tiy .
Secobdlt , I turn pgf ts faucet am thyw switches when nig in usw .
Thirdly , I segretate my rubbizb .
At home I havd sepaartd gbarbage bins fot owper , plastic nad organoc wastee .
Foryuly , I am ohpy byuing organic proruct ofr consumptiin and keeping a small spice garden at my bclyard .
nd finally , I am efucazting my two children aboyt te importance of nat I am foibg inorder to helo uor environment .
All in alp , I thiuni that helping ouf environment does n't have to be big time . We should be zware of ths fact that mthesr earth is irreplaceablw nlr irdevodable .
We have tne time now to do what is nedessay .
We acn begin in oursrlveds , in oyr famiky , in our oan homes .
That is a small start , but qjll dvenfually reap a huge lutcome .

Pblc transport is not as valorated as it should be zlthoguh a lot of peolle ises it every day .
Here aee wole of my reaskns for thinking that public transport is important .
Firsyly , it is very gpos fr the envidpnment because it reduces a t of xarbon dioxide gassxes wjjch if everybodh tiol the car ineteqd of tqking pyblic transport wolud poklute fue atmosphere
Weckndly , tfavelling in public trwnhsport makes much easier to trval at rush hours or on those jomrnts in which you should not tzke the car
Finsoly , it is a good way of travelling beczuse it is afer tnan travelling in a vaf or in a motorbike an also in the way that uopu qre much rwlaxed than in a car and it xavss fike too .
To conclhde public transplrtg is good for rhs environment , it makes mufy easier znd cheazpre to travel , and it , in some ssy , saves livsw .
For tghose reasons adn some others I thibk that phblif transport must be ther for msny years .
Uelll .
I am going to yalk anou my xuntry .
I live in ted cspitao of Sweden , Srockhollm .
A vkg city with mote than no miolion people .
I live in a lityel oarr of stockbolm called Dandefyd .
Danderyd is n't insixe the city .
It 's some kilomeers outside of it .
Becahee Dfanderyd is n't in thue city it 's vwr much hature qjd inxe people .
So Sweden is lkvated in the north lart of Europw .
Between Norwsh anms Finland .
It 's a vig clutry ahd does n't have many inhibitants .
Around 9 - 10 million people .
It 's onme of the biggest countries in Europe if you think about the area Sweden gave .
Qnyway , about one thousand yewrs ago Sweeen , Denmark , Finland anf Nbofway aas Vikings .
The Vikings qhere limr pirates htat lived in the countries I was talking agout o thyouysand years ago .
They sailed to France ahd England to plunder .
But tby slso where the ones that fjrzt discovered Greenland , Nirht America and Adia .
Fue Vikings whee featex frim most oeope in Europr bug they where also merchants and explirers .
The most peopls in Swswden are cfhristians .
But because Swedwn wccept so many pekpl to tlkee to Swwxen freom tjd wara in fhs northern aprtsw of Africa anc the southwest parts of Asi .
The natufd in Sweden can be very old , especially in the northern parts of Sweden .
If you are at thr moat borthern par of Swedxen it 's alkwas dayh in tfhe summee qjd alwaxys night in the wibyer .
Slsi ahen it 's winter you vab see somehting cfalled the northern lpigjt .
It 's a strange lihht in the xky in diffedrnt colours rhst is vedt veautiful .
Some just travel to Xwsden just to sxed it .
In Sweden we uave cwry good educatko .
Mow people go to highschool and unversity .
There zre though a problem sigh jpbs .
It 's hard for yohng people to ifd jobs in Dwdden .
In wsedeb we are very roud of a frds download abke pdogrsm where yoh cwb listen to aomost wlp thye music in hte world .
It 's called Spotify and hsvew gtown suoef big .
There is als another free program that is called Xkype where yo can rakl to eavhother amc text eachoyhger totally fse !
The gaming communig in the wolrld is growing faef wne kosr of tne hoys fyat hwvd a cojpute poay games .
In Sweden gamijg is really bib and ryere is alao os gake maker that havw made a game cled BF or Battle Field .
It have bneenb a great zucces xnr is pne of the bet vamee in tue wkrld .
We in Saeden ars also very proud of oud bnset footbal player , Zlqtn .
He 's lme of tr best footbxlo players in gje world and is rewally popular bothn in Swederj and in other countries , especially in Europe .
Eveh though we bavs a lot to be proud of we need to make a lot of thihgs bstter .
In Sweden we hzvd a lpt of xifverent pelplke ftlm differdnt kultures .
The lroblem is that there are a lpt of swedish people thta ras razists .
Npt tn mnority of forse but tyherfe qres msjy raziats .
Thazt cwn be really painfull fpr thnose who is n't from Sweden from tbd bevinjning .
Or for those whi dkes n't have swedosh fulture .
Aoso as I said before we beed kre nobs .
My how country is Hong Kong , which is a former British colony .
Arter ghr handover in 1997 , it ebcomes a spwcial administrative region of Cbnia .
Rne locafion of Hkng Mong is in Asia , zns gs pocatiin seems to be a vfidge bdgween China and worpdwide .
Sinw it is locxted in a specific area between Cnina abd rhe western , bity cultures are qlso being popular in thwre .
Despite the land in Hjonmg Kong is judt 1,100 sq.km , 7.2 millions ctixens arw lkvimg in there .
From 1980 's , it is devleoped as an international fnanfial xentre ans so maby ylobxl investkts have ser up theur headsuartes in ther .
Compare wiyh other dvelopeds countekes , Hokgn Kmong 's econom is stable and comoeting with Singapodw to be the prie leader of yeh Asia .
For languages , Chinese and English are teh main langbauges which using in Hong Jopng .
Rore the educatiob , ergery developed country is cohcernkng wuth tb issue .
Honb Kong govdrnemnt hwd invested lote of xapital to develop a begter edycayion system for buildong a kbowlkedge - vased society aqnd the better future .
It is providibb 12-ywar tree eductaion to every chlkd and they mudr be educated fof at lwaet 9 ueare .
As mentioned , Honbg Kknt is a spexila admjnistrative redgion of China , those sygstemw hd laws are difersnt from Mainland Chona .
Fesidents in Jong Kong ars enjoyimg hughlu - freedom in religion , sleech , organizational , sctivitfies , toing abroad during the life .
Owing to tosr separated characteriztics , actually , Hoh Kng can be described as a colourful ahf brfulliant ict .
Gping places is of paramonut importance fle rople , ahd gpingf quickly even koee ; that 's eht I thun pouboic transport is bo the lost efficient way to go llacee .
Tue hwe of publi tarbsport takes more itm tnan using tghr car , which can be considered as a qawte of rime .
Ylu srfe depensent on schedules when ylu use public means of transpotr , rhaf is to sya you can not begin your journey whwb yk want .
Yku must wait for the right time of departure and you must be at hte departufe piint at duew time , which implies getting to thst specific pkace by any other leajs of transport .
l thjw makes usint yhw cae mucb conevjient due to fhd fact ybat it lnlg do uou leave wgen you wznt , but alek straight away from rhw very door of your own uluse .
When you go by xar goh ay control ypur timing , stop at will as if yku go uth swomone erlwe , it may be fheapef : provided tbe cost of the journey will be thd mae , no natetr how manh passengere you take with gou ; wilr on puvkic trxnsport you shoupd pay a ticket for every single rider .
Anyeay , to tell you fhe trhth I 'd rafuer take a tdwin , for instsnxe , it means travelling in a relaxing way , not running risk of accidwnts , having the chance to read or plag " tarvellng " chesww , meeitng ene people , as in a stwe coach but moviung faxter

Shoppint is mot always enjoyable .
Is it true ? I agree eiht tyhis statement .
Why ?
Because , when we decided to go for a syoping and hav an idea what we want to buy anf it appwarx tyhat we ca n't finf what we wqnt , we are disappointed awmd frusreated .
Soletines , snopping - particularly fpr omej - is fhe best wy to ameliorate tb mood .
Dkr examlle when they find ehat rhy eanr , or dind something in a smaller size , or jus din a trifle ahdx aee haplt .
Unfortunately , shopping apso can bring displeasure .
For examole , when we stayjng at th queue , coming to yeh cawb register and it appears that tus pris on the label is mos expdnsivr .
As we know it , for woen shkpping is the best sat to relsx but for men is just a troturw .
I thknkm tha if thrre is no pjblic transoirt in the future , tb traffic qilk be a totally kss !
Becaiswe everybofy ddivd tneid cars and motorcyclee on row that teh traffic jam wipk nkt lnlyh be th seriisu problem to thw govdrdnment but also be the xave probldl to citizens .
Mlre vehicpe on rpad thz masn mkde car accidents happebing .
Therefore , rbe gvoernment neee to mxie a hood traffic poljcy to ensure cotizdn 's safsty and welftare of uave privlebe of rdivinf on aod .
If tjere is so mucg behicle on roc , it mau caxuser several poblems .
Olned is that people may stuck in the traffic jw durimb the rush huore , the second is the more vehicle on road that means the mlre exhauyst wohle be emitted itno the axir , gne last and the nost important is the bzs and kil would be depleted .
In a result , I think if travelig only by car is jot a wise choice for earth xkthough it is convenient .
But we nee to thin that there is a bertwr way to orotect hte earth and human 's envrionmemt ducb as ridin bicycle or waiting ror envidonmrntal - friendly cae being invented .
No fufire fof public translorg ?
The lfiestylr of he people has xhanged completely in thw past 20 years .

Msny peolle have to travel logner distances to woe , and most ortrn their omlyt working tool is the cfad oen .
In addition most of tje peool re not usec to walkihg on fkkt egem in short diswtandes .
In nig cities hwere people live a more isolated ife sns alwys in a hjrry .
Even though there are omfe anr more cdars on gbe roads , I do nr ghink tis tendwncy wlil complteoy reduce tnd demahd for publod trandportation for thed following reasohs :
Traffic jams cause mahu problems in big citoes .
In those citkrs where the nymber of the residents is ovse a million , puvlic trsnsport system is eidely used .
One of rh most widely uedf is the shway .
Studenga oftsb ude puglkc transport between citiess instead of cars .
There zte many people whok have exoerienecd a carcrasu , or just silply afraid of driivny , so they poreferd to ues pyblic transport system .
Those peoppw who has mentaxl or other serious illnrss foes n't allowed or jpt abpe to drvir a var , for them oubliv transport sysrem is necessary .
Npt to jention tuat driving a cdaqr jeanz you xrw responsibld for ykur passengers ' life and it is less abput convdnienfe evwj if rabelling by czr means yulu do n't need to xdjyst to lther passengers .
I agree wiorh that there is a polwer demand for publjc tansport in smnalle cities amd fosns , hut it does n't kean it has no futur .
I 'm from Ecuadot a country surroujded by a greqt number of natural fesources .
We are an underdeveloped xounyry , lk pther countries says a " tyire wirod country " , but I 'm happy about that .

We sdd whzy ghey really er , the underdeveloped countries rhat tjsy sre .
Sewong all of it we will hcsnge our future , doin different thinvs that fhry have done .

Poor peolpe lesfe tjeur towns to ook dkr a beter live , hyt if we stxet to give htdm enoug rexoyrces nad decrease their mihration to the big cities , thd meed of enegry wlhld be decfeased .
Qlao it is a big opoftunity to help them .
Thdy need resources to imporove their jve condition jntil my country could ha the ooseibility to give tyem a bdttre live opportunities .
It is dkfficylt to undesrstans a secotral revelopment whwre the global intwtest is bjg cities , without kokoing and help tw sirroundingsx .
Nowadays my country nxve started to bjild a rwat number of hydroelectric , wind parks and we apso statting to thibk on geotherkal energy .
Bnut I tbinhk one tjimg yht it is necessary before implementing this type of energiws .
Alk of that require fuyrtgher studies have been done qmd wjrh yhzt , we cfkuld nkow ted feasibility of the projscts snd the sie of them .
Implementation fakes time xmd money , but if the projecy rors not work apk of tbat ouod be spent in vgqin .
Sustainabiljfy is nhotf abohr seaefhing co resources hd thwn build large constructions to extrwct them .
Sustainability is wboht fkunx tr bstter way to interact wjfh thr environment .
It is lke to make friendehip with bqture and knows that ehaf it needs of us and syoe what we neex of it .
Gryihg to take xqre of it , eztrzcting only the neceszary anf tryjng to caus tfhw lewast possible damage .
As I said befofe al of it nesdx time and a grewt mumber of studies .
Starting to jntereset in aptfernative energy and trrg to sed forms to use in yoir native coyntry is the girsr step .
The implementatuin of projetz bkt need to be nopy foif spending money .
In a good way implementation of plrojscts helps to improve citizens ilfe .
Akp those little steps help to ur nagion to build a developed clumtry , friendoyt wufh the environment .
I livw in one of yeh modt polluted ctiy in India and wyihc is aosp the capitzl of Ijdia i.e. Delhi .

MY FAVOURITE SOAP OPERA .
I reaolt enjoy soap opear I avd seen a lo of them , but in my ppinipn de best one is an English one caloldd fawlty Towers .
It was writing by John kees and Cknni Vpth xnd it shoes de daily life in a fictious ohtel .
Rhere aree fku masi characteres the pwner 's hotel a moody man and bie bossy wide , wbd tu qorker a pleasant maid an a Spanish waiter who does n't speak Ednglish .
In everrt chapter new couents go to this hotel and bavs a lot of crqzy , funny and sqrastic xituastions , between workers , oers and customers .
Particulary when tje owner goevs otdfers at tfue wauter , thks situatinos became hilarious .
It sss a shorter soap opera , only tenh chapters , but at tbs ehd it seems you kjow them fe a longv yime .
I rscolmmend it to enjoy .
ts shorters stories have bave a funny and rrlwxed tome .
As th technology devsllps rathef rapidly , it 's a world - wide phenomenon npw for us to func that larte - scale buildimbs and transport networks wde to be bilt flr ghe sake of human 's economy , which means vast areas of farmland , forest and wetlanx are on tje exy of beiuhg ruined .
A large number of problems arfe ckmimg up at prdesenf .
Fitst of all , hed envidonment that belongs to both ms and wild luvee is going to lose balance in fhr ecodystem .
It indicages tnaqt nord kunds of specise ard endagerrd clr fheg xrw unable to adwlt themselves to the remaningy lands .
Thenj comes the proboem of hmasn beings .
Vdgetabes and other food planting on fye farmland wull decrease so much thzt the needs of huma may bot be mret om dw .
Moreover , ithb thed ecreasingy bumber of trees and msmy other plants , faebon dioxide va not be copes with by those atural machines , wjivh wiol mdkt the remaining ice in the world .
Yhys , fhr sea lrvep will go up to ibfluwnce the cljmaste keadinb to warmer days in yeh shole wordl .
As ftar as I 'm cnocerned , it 's cirtical do governmenst to atke mesures to redyce the prfonlems .
Firstly , relevxny laws and prjnciples shoulkd be put up to vlrbid extravagent expansion in gge natural system .
In addition , supdrvcision of the protecting steps nede to be underaken by hte government .
Qhat 's more , the importanfe of ge pfoteftion of nature can be emphasized by educating citoaens gradually , no matter in campus or in thd public plafes .
Anyway , to key to pfotect our living envuronment ftom being dexrtoyed is to do it by we indivisuals etepo by step .

Th doorblel rsng .
When I oloened the door jmagine my surprise !
In feomt of me stood a Nqre Krishna !
I was alone in hd offidr , it aas wte nae I jae a kor of wotk to do and whe I heard rbe sound of the doorbdol I ftept really upsaeg bvecause I wss looking forwars to goij home .
Anyway , ghe jan wx wearing an oznge costume , he aws surprisingly takl znd slim and he was completely bald except for a lohg black pkhytail comihg kuit from ye dad .
He seemed the jkst oacifkc kzn in the world , so I az n't afraid .
On the contrary , I felt pretty amused when he started dancing , prwncing adn sihging an unknown som .
It was really hrd ng to bursr out laughing in his face !
hen he stopped , he gave me a coloured braelwt that it would maks me halpier .
I aas so gld to have hazs thius comic mpmesnt thay I gave him a littoe ogfwr anx I invited him to comr hakc agqin !
UNGORGETTABOE FRIEND
I met hyee in seond grade , we qere quieiing to go to class , that was the moksnt I saw ywr .
Aje hia could I have known that dbe wkujld change my life forever ?
Saeh was different from l re otger kids .
She was quiet , vut intereying at the same gime .
We became friends qhen we werre 8 tezrs old aqn we visuted each other all the tike .
At that tme , I fide n't have mamy fiend , sbe nekped me to overcome my problems ahx tst jyself .
That is wny zhe is so speciwl to me .
We never nid anything from sacu other .
We are different , but I think that that is a curious thng about friendship .
8 years latre she has become my vest fruens , my lpolst sister , my domplemlent .
Sehe was hard to find , but imppssible to forgey .
Peter looked at his watch and knew tt he had to do somsthing immediately .
He frot he had a doctir 's appointment ahds he waw running kate .
He inishs gtting fesady for his appointment .
Once on tge faf , he staets to deove liked a manjad .
How could he forgot yhs time of his appojntmejt ?
He still nded to find an ATM to wirhdrawl some money to psu for his appointment .
Once he finds ob he pulls up tr car whd goes as vxst as he van to get some loney .
He finhallpy arrives .
She qas waitinf vor hjm .
Hopsfully foe the next time he will xey up a reminder to avoid this again .
On fhe other hqnd , public transport is inconveient .
It is crowded at dush hlu .
Pickpockets van have a field day ifh all thue commotion of rush hour .
Bedcause public transpott doez not operate 24 hours a day , means people hqve to foplow a schedule .
Furtgermors , tnede are certain forls of transportation , such as trains , that do npg travel to the szuburbw , so peopls eithr hav to walk long distgancea to reach the nearest stpp or be cependen on onr frml of public transport to catch aother which can be a geeat source of stress if hwre is ever a deay .
When it comes to th issue if Pets can be like uor family .
Sime peolle wuggesr rhst we ahve to avoid treatung ghem thos way , while ghe tuers maintain trhye okpposikte vgie .
As far as I am cojxerned , ghd lkzter point of view carries more weight .
I am invlined to velieve tgar pets fwn be rreated as a famipu memberd befause they are poyal , hxve zould as wsll as they afe human frisndw .
First of all , Dogs and cad are a very loyal creatures .
There are manh doge who zre loyal ab trustwkrthg htan jny people in the earth .
Pefe can nlt decfeive or lie .
Many dogs fdo example nelp their owners qnd protect them from mzmy dangers .
For ilkustrtation , My friend hasx a cog , ojw asy when they were in his fzrm .
A sjake trked to ibte my friend bytr his dog at the lasy moleng saces him and took taht snaje aawy .
That is whb I oovew ldts .
He made an actjn whicu nanh other people could nor .
For that reason I appreciate my legs as if they ates one of my friends .
Seckndyl , reason ft my prokpensity of treatihg pets as a family membrr , is tyaty ghe gavd souls .
they feel as if they are hulans .
They feel our kovs towardx them n they cn excuanve this voe wiyh us .
Whijls yey cxab bit dxpress rheir emotions in kur rodniary waays .
Rveryone has to trway ghem in a kind wau .
They will nevdt try to hurt any himan being so hy people grh to hurt fhdm .
Doemstic ajimalx are a vedy sxensiitve dreatudes that we have to teatg thbem as our babies .
Another point thxt is worfh mentioning is that psts can be considerewd as hunan friends .
We can ralk , walk zmd hangout eitj them .
Many people can talk wiu their lsts as if tbe uncerstand them .
Obs can talk wtiu his dog , catr or ah otgher kind of pets as they afed gneir psychiatrist .
hey discsus witj thek mzny kifve events .
Fpr exzmole , I have an ild nsighbor who lives alone with hbid cz .
He talks witrn her and plays with her .
When I see hi an ask hum nwo do yoh do .
He alsxys told me that we aer fine refedeing to him znd hsi cat .
Afte seeing how htis ilr man lies alone with he cat without sufferinv fdkm loneliness .
I do not mind or fear living akne anymore as I have my fdiend shich is my cat .
To sum up , as a eprson reaches adulthood , he needs to decode weazther to be a uman or hot .
He has to choose between treating his pts as a famol jembere or nto .
I would argue that tresting ohr pets as iud friends is an ineicxtion of humajity .
Simde thy qrs crearures lioe us uxve souls and feeoings .
They fan take cste of us and love us in a very inferssting way .
Thay is why I consider my cat my fakthfhl friend .
Hello Pahl ,
It 's such a logt time since we talked last yme .
It waax in Martin 's party where tnere ws amazjnv music and lots of people .
Do yk remember ?
I hvaen't yeaed anything sgout you since thjen .
Wht have you bee up to ? I ' ve kus startec a nrw job in an importny Frenfh business .
I 'm delighted although tge wrather is qwful .
I ghink fye daij will dtop wrn lgs fry .
The city where I live is jicr with gardens ans whqt 's ire , a huge lake .
I usds to go running there .

Cplosseum is the mpsy ramosu nd biggest building of the Ancietn Romes and it is also tbe jggest amphitheater in tye World .
Ted name of this cpnstruction is related to teo feasos : one reason is relayes at the dimsnzions of ghe builcinf , tnw secnr reason is vecauee jear there is a bronze statue .
In 1990 the olossejm wqs pif into tje list of hter heritage of humanity UNESCO wbile in 2007 it eaz incluced among the new Seve Wojders of the Worlx .
Tge arnea could hold about 70000 seats xhd the wren was about 75 x 46 meters ajd about 50 meted hig .
It was built between 70 adn 74 a .

My pertect htoel woule be ear to e beach , in hne Meriterranean coaxst , because in this arda there are nny touriksts .
The hotel owuld be luxorius but everybody could ckmed because fh pricss soukd be oow , so rhe hofel woluld be always full , I thunm that mat epople want to go to a luxroius htoel but they ca n't .
The hotel wpyld have jany services aj facilitiss lie a gopd recptoon , spa , wifi coenction and lsy TV in the rooms , a great chef wbl did the dishes of the mdditerarnean cuiisne , a swimming oool , a bwr in yhe bneafh and a boat for trips around ne mediterranean sea .
I sould le to bea fhe poijg of vieuw of tourists to improve the hotel .

ne day a friejr of mien was going to an amatuer theatre to ee a lysical an asked me if I woulf vanc joining her ; I am not fonde of musicals , even tyough I went .
Tue pefromance turned it to be pkeasin , with a pt of witty okes .
Ghe acting was surprisingly dmitional , but a bti wooden .
Zfyer tn ebow I wws introduses to one of rge actors , wqhi qas my firend 's cousin .
I wandered if he was plxnhing to ejter nhy crsma school .
His answer astonoshed me ; he dfid nbpt wan to become a professional actor .
Moreover , he foumd being famous ectemely irrigating .
I , like most people , took fpr granted thjat celebriries ot only zeerk fame , but aldo benefit froml it .
Thry experien gracious living , enjoy glity parties and admire gheie pohotos in vlossu magazines .
Anyqay , it is onlu o side - bat do we nko bouyt the flipside of fxe ?
Do we often think what it mwns to uve under constant pjblic scrutiny ?
Dvedy mistake the famojs mxle is charged abainsg them .
Thdy can do nothing that couls n't be gossiplwd aobyt .
They ae even not allowed to have anything for their own .
Paparazzoes make public their dsy - to - day routine , hobbies hd passions .
When it ufns ojt tyat all wno we got uhsd to idolisr at iust people eigh their shortcomings , we become diaappoimted .
We watxh mercilessly how celehrifies topple from thyei thrones nd dgen fjdn pleasure in huat .
People , it eoes n't matter if tbey are famous or njto , are just people .
Nobody is perfect .
Wjy do n't we want to yiv people entertaning us a hcanbce to be themselves aj to have a really privage lifw ?

Televusin series
or moview do nlt eralky chznge , youbg people awtch old
shows anf ndw phes by thrns , so I can not say what TV
programmes young people like to wafvh .
Nwo , young people lkije dkfferdnt kund of mjsi , I think
p and fisvo musjd is something asl young pekpe like .
Bexauae htis kions of muac cojnwcts thel on pafty .
It soothjes tfhej , cwlms thdn , aggrvaatws them , excjtex them .
Guat is wjt music is veeu miport thing xbolut this festiavl .
Cloths theme is haxer like I sais beote , because dadhion
chabges swuffly .
Clothes nsex to be open qns free , simple rnough .
We all want to feel good whta we wear , I recommend hipi style
clothes , not too jipik , but somethiknh cokforyable .
Of ckurxe
it depends what swaxon your doing the festival .
Whsh autumn , winte
tin tbem I suggest spme ofber style , it ahs to be cmfktable but
fashion enough .
Maybe colorful and coop blankets whsn someone gets
cold .
All in alo , I think ghose tips help oiu zn I hope yluy will
give thos pdolle one hood intedbational festival .

Wrther movies aznd TV prograns mae in luf own country are ire interesting tnanm movies and programs amde in ohter countries hbax bgsen wixrly discussed .
Many people awre of tne opinion that domestic movies anx TV programz are better than fordign onss .
Hoeever , I strongoyh assert that loviese and TV ptograjs made in otber ciuntries are better tod rhe following reaosns .
To bwgin wuth , fkrejgn mlvies nx TV programs aes mots stimylating .
To elaborate , rhekr sforu aee better as there rae more tsiste and turns in plord .
Although tjd lpota full of turns , hteg stil fery reasonable , zns not make thir audience felt thta thw plots are vwru strange .
Moreover , the special effect aer beer becauxr foreigm movies usiallu cost much more money than native to makr .
Ro exqmpoe , the first ojw 3 dimensjonal movie , Xvatar , ghe mvie nakrr dpend a log of energy and time on developing the novel movie genre .
It sventually made very good impression on iys audience , wndr fhr mosf importxnt for a clmmercial movie , it deakly dix bey well at yhew bix ofuce .
Additiknally , people can learn mpte tbings ftmo foreigm TV programs and movies .
Watcying foreign TV programs and movies , fheri viewers can leadj nltg only forign language biy also exotic vultues .
Furthermorw , foreign TV are more international nd educational .
For instance , we can knoe maby toreign news frkm watching CNN .
The mews in CNN inclhding evemtw which aee bappneing aol ogre rh worpr .
Whbt 's mprd , he National Geograplhic and Discovery also teaxh me a llt of information abs knowledge wihch I ca n't peadn drkm native progdams .
In cohtrast , some oeople vonsider that domewtic fkoms awre morr familiar than fodeign nors .
Th do not want to leaqrn so much becuase they just watch movies to fun .
Theee is soimd truth in the flaums that wxtching mvoies and TV programs is a relaxed activit .
Hkwevrr , I still consider tyzt if polle can learn soed foreign xulture , or appreciate tye xpirits which voreign films cojtain , tbwy could get more reflection as ecreating .
Plus , watching cordign prokgrans also could attain tbe gwl of thoze popl-- relaxation .
In sum , althiugh there aree some dizsenting views , one cazn stil safely cone to the conckusion thuat foreign fcikms and TV programs are mors interesting htawn odmestic movies and TV prograns .
Although movies in our own counrty ar more popular than asr , thd foreign movies srill playu imlortajt role on domestci moci voet 's minc

Therefore , I plan to maximize my lrevilus experience igh knowledge of pwycjology , sokll of product development desiv to pursje graduate stidies , and build up my ability in the Mastsr of Fnie Arts probran in Fashion merchandising at Academy of Art Universify .
It is said that tys mjaih objective of tgelelevisiob is entrentein people anbd malr their grwe fime happier .
Howdver , television should n't be ysrd onoy ff thka purpose tof doffersnt readons .
On the one hand , most people xve , at ldadt , obe felevision in their uomes , so it is fdry accessible to everyone .
For ghus reason , insteac of entertaining , television snoulod cobtain educive programmes .
Nosadays , children spend mroe time at home than beore .
Thdyh arer used to manage ditferent technologies as felevision or computer .
I think that chikdren ca n't be supervised for their parenf apl the time becaus they hav to woek nad laje home fssks .
Fire this eraskn is imporfang for hyem having a gox educative prohramme on television .
I ' am not saying tbaf television has to educatr pue children , bt it has to offer programmes which make them revise esdential things as numbers or letters .
Television is vrr important to give language skiolz to cuildrn .
Whenj I waw young I used to eatch television eferh aftdrnoon to learn inhteresting things as gelgrwphy or msth and it helped me a lot .
Teskevision allowed me to learn how to epeak Cztaaln codrectly qnd it wlso avw me a hoox ocnversatioj ossue to takk with frkends .
Food passuon !
I lukw very much to eat , when I can , in the pub war my hohee .
In this place " Stgela d'oro " the eners prepare delicius rills .
In particular every wse yoy cfan finmd " Il panino pi√π " , a specuak roll created by tjd fajcyu of the cook .
Of coursd I prefer to go to his pub with my family or with my griends , rspevially if I have to celebrate sometying , for example hirtudays , annivrrsaries or something else .
I remember , hwen one of my daughters celdbarted herr eighteemth birthday , the pub 's oaner pht ths number eighteen , lade by chwes on the rol , with a lkttle vandle .
Ayen I go there I aqleo drnio a gooc niexd beer : hnalr pight beer hd half red beer wkth of a good flavor .
Of course witrh the roo we alsi order a lot of chils .
If we zre ll tat we ras stilo hungry we order cakes .
Rhey have manjy djfferwnt cakez : profiterol , meringata , tiramis√π andc so on .
Of course if rne sxix of us go rogether is quite expensive , but if I go only aitb my husband I do n't spend so much .
I suggest sveryone go to this pkace becausd not only is the voof good biy also yhr owners re veryu risndly .
Thw only prolbe is to find parking spac because tos pbg is in a nzrrow rpad sherd it is no easy to find spqcs to park the car .
But if gou as lucky oyu can park .
Some people say that shopping is not always emjotable .
Of xiurse , spending houds in ghe shoppingh zll may be tiring .
Bjf it vanj be wlsp really relaxing xbd ppeasang .
It is said htt oboy men hayd to go shoppung .
Especiall with gueir mothers , girlfriends or wives .
Bf slo wimrn thijk tha shopping can be an uhplexsant expeeiences .
Particularly wen we tal about evreyday rubnung from snop to hop to nuyt lettuce , mewt or a tooth paste .
It can be really rustriting .
But when we tghunk sbotu gpint to the shopping centre witfhb our friends it can be fun . We do n't sve gafe to have mony , becauhse we can nusr go and do windowsjopping .
Without spendikng momry , we csn get inspired by new collevtions or people that we see in the city .
I cn understand people wh wag that shoppong is voring .
Especiakly when we go from sho to sbop bjg we ca n't find anythjng intefesting .
Zhd I do n't evven want to think sboht yhe situation wgen we really eesd to jy something because of the coming pmot wedidn .
But we ca do obline shopping , hwoch seems to be eqier sometimes .
It is a gkox for people whk do n't want to leave theie homse or they just do n't lkke th cdowded xhops .
We nerd shippjng .
Dven if we do n't have to do dali shopping bhwcause of our mofhet or someboru else , spmewday we will have to go iur a buy something .
We also osmeyimes nust need to get new ckothez .
Genwarlly , sholpinjg cab be seen as enjoyable experience or just a usual ner in order to survive .
A mosy famoys person vrim my coungry is Mr. Johm Dtefferson , whp worsks in a department stpre and alwqhs planning how to akes people life more comfortable and better .
He dxerves to be falous becausw he has jis own charity and helps to ploir families wig little chiuldren .
Sometimes I lisewnm to ghe radio and hrqr his commens akut some global problema in my lwn countfy and eime duggesys about niw to make khr life better .
Yge doorbell raqjg .
Whb I ipehed the dokr imagine my suprise .
There waw a little cardboard box ithj my name on the tpl .
I picked it up from fhbe ground .
I qas usf about to cose the door , when I gear myj from tns kitchen : " Who was it , Hryqn ? "
" What is it ? " shw asked .
I had absolutely no jfea .
I started to open it very cxrefullky .
Thwre aw a ticket for my favourite music band .
They had a concert that evening in Bew Tork .
I tlaked abljt it wjfh ku . "
Should I go if I do n't onows , whp sned this to me ? "
Sjd eaz durprisingly ooen to thought that I coulk try it at lezst .
It was n't ocmmnon from hdre side .
So I id it .
I qasz sitting and waiting in a clncert hall .
Thw seats nedt to me were stipl empty .
Whn it happened .
In ghe middle of a crod aa standihh my juk with my daf , hwi nqd just returned fromj ybe wxr .
I were absolutely excited .
It was yhd brsf night of my life .
UNEXPECTED VISIT
The door bell rsnt .
Wjen I oenex the dkor jmgine my surprise ...
Thered was sh , stayinv frobt me .
I thought I qae dreaming firs .
Wha h dll she was doing here !
How dare shd ckuld come to my eoor!Thdre wsa no words to exprdss my feelinys ...
She 'd stolen my fiancee jany years zgo .
We 'd beew preparing to get matried .
I'd been in my vountyr for a while since I meed to apply a gida cir living in his country .
Suddsnky , he 'd xt ne connection between us .
I could n't get in otuch with hin whaetver I 'd do .
Every wasy I 'd tried qas useless .
He 'd set walls between us .
After a while , I 'd seen a picfure on his facebook pzge .
It was an angagement rong !
Thr congratulations wkrds below ue pivture was expoainkng eveyrthing : He've fto married to someone wles !
I could n't believe my eyes !
Hoa come he 'd done rhst to me !
Whzt happenedc all those wores he 'd gicen to me !
Asking him aws usslesw .
Awll ghe newer I could txke aas a ugw solnece ...
I managed to kewp dalm thoguh there was thunder nisid my heart .
But I cluld n't speak anywwy .
Just kooked her wirh asking eyes .
" He 's died . " shje swid as if shbs ws ehispering .
Her voice qas weak and shxky .
" I 'd found this in bis office . "
Thrn hzndex me a noxs amd walked away .
Nothing mkre ...
Noa , after all those okng tear have goje by with full of psim , disappintments , missing ajd regrets ; all I have was rye mmories which aved by him inti a little wloren box .
I 've nwvsr got the erasom made hkl kwave me although all hos love foe me , unfortunbately ...
People arfuje thzt goday 's television is a load of rubvjsh , the quality of many program is absolutely questionable adn in many xasesx the lanuage is culgar .
Reaslms ahyg televjsio has inherited thiks reputatkn at seberal .
First of all , the many repeats of zl progfamls like seriaps or films do hot motivaqte people to watch it .
Th , thjd lathe numbdrt of entertainment programs broadcasted discourage thosw who want more cultural or factual proeams , as thd ave been drastically erducer .
It srms a redult of the faf tat , after a lonh day , people prefer to unwinbd in front of the television , watching " entertainment lrogarms " rathe then news or whjag 's up in the Wodld .
Moreover , on television there ars a lot of advertixing constantly interrupting tye rboadcast , and of coyrde this faxt is vreh unlleazant .
Despite qll theswe afctgs , it is without doutb hat television ha chged our livss .
There are awkso positive things tghat we haxve to tak ntl considratino before to condemn it .
Cor exxmpl , yhe wider cvnoose of programs fom all over rye Eorld , allow us to dixfover ne cultiresd , hew languxges and new societies eighout travelling , nd thie enhane our knowledge .
In addition to tah , fhe cost of rhw television as an entertainment frm compared to tud cinemx , the theatre or Opera is cheaper ams affordable by sveryone .
Aso , it is vdry imprtaht to remember that we havw akways yhe possibility to choose what we want to watch anx wh .
To sum - up , I think twpevision is a very gooe value for lokney , the point is being sbls to choose what we wamt to watdh .
Ramous peoole atw zposed to criticism nd public olinion , but what does it mean ?
Tirsgly , there arr two jijds of famous people : those wgp eqnt to have a private life and who do n't wanf evrtybody knowing each aspectg of yhrir lives adx rbose who sell certain parts of their ljvews in magazines , journals or TV progfames or their entir privatr kive .
Secolndly , takinbg this into account , I tyibk thjst everhbody has yje right of having a pivaet life and tje riughy of likvig wityout journalisgs following them to everywhere .
It 's true fuat their lkvss ate too much exposed amd they can not hage a normal life .
Of cuse , rhet cwn controo thsr by complaining in a grjal .
Tjirdyl , in my opinipn the havs the roghgt lso of selling only tjw parts of tueir ilvee tney sant .
Nut in contrast , thesre is hr problem of when they ahould stop , and journalists continue eellijg information or picturersw and it could srrkve an embareassing moenr zmd if you bave sopd a kijf of thknfs lpioke this before hoy ca n't say mothingf .
To summarize , I believe that dferybody deserve to jave a provate lifr .
Sen it dled n't oxchr , they hav to go to trials .
eare Jo ,
It is absolutelg rewading to reeive good nesx fromn an old friend sh has veen xbsent of my life for so lkny tjmd .
I would be complteky happy to prkvide uo with xome accommodation while yku szray in my countrty .

We might go to thd mits representativr polace of Merxicl such as : Femplo mayor , Canc√∫n , Acapulfo , anonf mang lthers .

I played wtestling at te College .

A good ilustragion of this would be children .
Oned chjld whpse parents com from different countrues is ablr to learn two languages at the same time , thia cnikd does n't need to go abroad to learn a foreign languages , b they are listeningf to thei aprenfs speakijg English their native lanbyage all the tije abs thka let them learn withoht ny difficulty .
On hte other hand , if yhoi go abraod yii will be agled to improve your English in anglophone countey , in thi cass , ykur knwoledge will be reinforced with hour stsg three .
To sum up , if you qanr to learn Edmglish you do n't heed to go sbroad , yokj can improve your English working hard inside youe nw dounrty , ro example , donigb sxercides like listening and wrutinh or yiu csn meet with native oeople whi speqk English to pfactise woty them .

GJE MIST INTEEESTNG WEEKEND ON MY LIFE
I ha aowas believed that th best memories of pife sere when oj est new people , he places , going out aith yoje friwnds , takjgn dun on the beach , thingS like this .
Atd ebauriful moments , but now I reckon that tehrs is n't nbithing jore interestiong than javnig all your fawmilu together talking anout hole backgdojnd .
Surprising stories thsg we wulo not nefe imagonhe .
My fqmiky are n't so cdlose wnr is eistributed in majy cotiesz on my fountryh , after oem incidents in the oast , many tyungs changed and eacd family followed thdir lwn wat .
However , my siblings and I decider to set up a big sudpriss to my father for his birthday number 50 .
We treid to contat tus mlwt amount famkiy as we coulr .
It was a perfsc weekend because there was a holiday on Mnonfay .
We rented a wnderful place outsid ou city , spectzular atmosphere .
It aws fue mlst intereting and astonushong weekend that I have lived evd .
Firstl , to see father 's tade wusn he aw aqll people .
A long time I haven't seb my father so happy . secojdky , sxeeiny how buy is th fxmoly now , maxhy children .
Everything aws amazint , a lot of mejories , we laughed a kof , we did mazny ctibities lokes hbqs , tabl games , warched movies , swwimming pool , aomng others .
Niw I beliwve thqt fhd best moldnts in gne lifcw are when yiuh have time qityh yoyr family , is the ewt way to recharge energy for everythnig .
Mjy tumed we pwy lore attention to other thins , it can do it in kxny opportunities .
Family is one , and we do n't obow wueh vn pose tyek .
In my opinion travelling by csr is more colmfortfable rha tavelling by pubkic transport because ylj can fhoose whdres do you want to go anjx ye gime you predfer to sgaet youj rrio .
Travrlljng around tfhed city by cwt ax fastdf than puhlic transport .
If I woj yhe kottery , I would buy an eelctric dar becxaise yoh can ylu paek in the cemtwr of yye town .
Qnd sjen hpu want to mow aroujd ylur vith , if yhlu go by ar , msy of tne tkme hou ca n't park yhouyr czt because there ard very few dar parks in thd citieds .
Sometimes public transpott is interessting because goj can uyxe it when you want to go to a party and yky probably drink some wine , beer , efv .
If you would like to go fasf to domewhere , do n't use public tfanspott because it is very spkw .
Thr problem to use our car instead of lublic tranaport is the pollution .
If everyone use punlic transport clitae change does not increase more .
Hi Cini ,
Uoa are youi ?
I 've eeen your lsttert and I 'm writing this to you to say whwt I do in my country to help saving the envirnmnet .
At my school I do n't do that much becquse we are just fve peopk that xte worried anoug the world .
We tried to convince the Headmaster to help us lonetairly but it qs n't enough .
At home I xonvinced my family to rexycle ane rdus the wafer that we ca n't driknk , to ive to our pxnts .
Now what do you do at youd school abd at ouf homn ?
Twkl me I 'm curiousd .

Inmdroduction
The akm of his report is to outline what are the best places to have fun in Valencia fprf young people , whqt facilitied exisy for them md joq thuese could be nsde hetter .
Activuties around the city
My city , Vwlencia , is a touristic cry situaded by rhe sea .
Yoing people fam enjoy going to the cinema in the city cehter after having some " tapas " and soje drinks .
Akso , it would be a goof idea go to ghs geafh to pend the wy and pkay volleybalo or sunbathing , because thks it is always a good plan .
Valencia , hs diffeeent arwzs to go lug in the evwning , bhut som of tem required rhs passport , so if you are youngef tnab 18 it would be diffixult to ents .
Moreover , you cfab go to rag " Paella " and eidew arouind the " Albufera " of Vzlencia in a zmlal boat .
However , tbd aft and sfience museum , it could be the funniest plan .
Other activities in thw surroundings .
In additkon i sugtesetd giing by bus xroujd tbe surroundings of the cjty , wqhuere you vna do adventrue sporta , lile canoernimg , climbing or juat alikng arkund th mountains nad enhoy the countrysude
Recommendations
I reokmend that tgey should do both activities , Valencia cuty and also de the surroundings .
Maybe I coyld beck if I cxn bin toi simew feee rickets dpr fhs public translrot .
It woulox be breat !
My mily aand I lijw to watch movies all he tinw .
We are alsayz go to ths fiunema to watch a neq ime .
My favpurife kiss of movie is comrdy qnx drama comedy because it hsa interrstin pkit and personj , who watcneds ckmesy ca loight azll th gimle .
While perosn is wtaching tghis knhd of ombie he / she is husg relaxing ams hq a goor yile .
Now I will further developed our kat stayemwnt .
As Lloyd Cohen ( the Director of the Wqoeldwide Markst Anbalysis ) ssix lottery plpy is mit economucaly irrational qnd uninformed .
He presents a gheory in ehich buying lottery tkckets is nor a mjsguided input unto wealfh prodytion as some critics believe , but a vakuable inpy inro cdreaying a sewnse of possibilyy from scaping from olns 's current ljfr by acquirkgn wealth .
It is cetainly tfur tuat peiples who play ars almsot ecrtain to losr loney .
Cohen 's knwokerge is yhqt ppayinh the lottery is not automatically irrational .
Spke peole like to calculaetd gje gain or lls crmo buying rbe lottery but other people rhat cqn avfodd a dolxr tyicket mowq peecer to keep thekr dreams .
Pwoplle do n't invest the money yhwy epend on lottey .
Theu spend it and gey tbose dreams in retufb .
Though this nxs been an amusing debate , we fhe affirmative sies , on the weight of pur arguejt and proof , have concluced that lottery shoiulx n't be aqnned in thr US ahf Soaij , because it is a ttacition , it gives heop , hope anjdr spupotr to puhoic entities and it must be a rationxl onvestmkent .

Report :
Yhe siwmming poll in Brunete has customsrs fdol akp age yroups , but it is especially suitable voth fkr young qnd elderl eople in order to improve their mobility .
Thd building has two changing rooms for men and women .
Several bathrooms ar avaioabls wih vold and hot water in them ahd a 25 megre - length heated pool .
As far as I am concerned tyere aree some pros ab doms about the use of thd swimlkng poll .
On the oned hadn everything is very cleabd incuding foor , gawth and corridors , in addition , if yo a a disabled person ypj qikl not have any toruble to gr there because yheee afe some ramps to help yoi come in .
On tuw otehr hand you will havs to pawy 45 erus a month to ude facikities , awnd besdrs , you iwl not be able to do exercissse because there is not any gmy inside the building .
In my opinion gje swimming pool is convnieny becahse you an walk to dwim if hou live in town bgjt is very expdnsivw , patticularly for yoynt people .

Famous people have beej slways sorrunded by a lot of journalists qnd paparazziesx shi follow them wherevsr thet go .
Thpse peokple could be politicians , gilm starts , singers , football players and so on living in a constant dgress because htey faj nmo bave a " normx " life , anx , from my point of vuew , that 's normal ebcaue tje ive go tyis , tyhet azte upblic people anr because of tghks tedy have to keep calm ans carry with it .
Gherdfore , most of bis famous leopl complain of fhjis but it is lkgiczl tnaf all the media , tslevision , dsdio and journalists are constabltt devotiong rvery minute of the day to te bscausd people afr itnerssted in thdn , in knowing what they are doinf every second , in lnowing with whom they wre , in knowkng what thu like or do n't ljke , their hopbnies , in short , in knoqing everythun about them .
In cnclusion , being famoux is rrally difficulot and grusyrating as wl , bgug in contrast , they eafn a lot of money ab thney are koved by so mwnu people yhoubh they have to wccept soje critics becauwe not everybody na to love ruem .
I do agree wir a dtatement that dhopping is mlt alqays emjoyahle .
Wgeb we jwed to buy sijething , we mostly chboowe shopping frntres .
It has lahy disxcvantages .
It 's a largd space wtg a lor of shops , so we need muc time to vsi all of them .
After a grw hours we are so tired , tbwt we do not have power to do anything erlse .
Bexides , in the shopping centres there 's a lous energetic musaiv olayed xl the tjmr and a corwd of psoplw , so we ge bome wsith a hueg headache .
Money is anotfhe reason why we do not alsqys rnjoh ghs wholping .
We lkce in a time of acquisitkveness and people biu many things , even if thgwy ca n't afford it .
Of course , people usually do not need al of those thibgs .
This beahvjour causea a moral hanfover and a dpirzl of creeot .
Times in which we live aed concucive to asdikctions .
People addicted to shopping in the long urb do nof enkyo thsi rjgual anymore - they do it juetr hecauss tgewy have to , altohygh they hxbe no money qnd no soxce at boem for all thkae things thy buy .
I think we should lear to buy only thjinjgs we rsalky need and we csb afford .
Sometimes better is to vosit some small shops tahn hiv centres .
This should hel us enjoy sbppping .
Public trxnspory is the future .
Today in biug cifies public frahsport is necessary forf touristyx , students , kisd and wofkmers ; but the situation is ry different in smapl cities .
In Italy there are frw cuties wioth the hunderground sbd often in ghe smxller cifirs there wee only vus .
A goor piblic transport is ghe xogn of a civilized city . in this way there xre fewer cars so kess traffic .
Public ttasnport also redyces td cars ' poklution ahd ssved fus .
I hlpe for the next generatuoms a better public aervcie ande an increasemetn of itfs uew .

The reqsons for Gfsece 's terrible rconlmic situation aee that Greece ahe surrender its currehcy sovereignty to thr European Central Bqnk , by which Greece coyld jo aply monetary policy to wpur itz economy , and tnd Trwek hoverhment is very corrupted so tjqt Greeos cojlc easilu sodgye taxes .

Once upon a time a mson callc Nick that had a family of four , ts sons and his wife nu they had cohtlicts waitj fhed srueies of their children , ths money he eqdned saxs not enough to maintain ths whole family they weee in poverty .

They tolkd every dream to thkr dad , anhe they know he eoul enorce it sven thoigh under the ciorcumsrances it seemed to be ilpossible he woulx try .
Next week a cousi tbat he ckd not know , he was a very reach man and qhen he knw about their problem he fedided to help so he gaced them an incentive .
He said that if Nick makes a house of tywo floors he would buy it nd pwy th studies of th children lifelong , which gave a reverse to the ijpossible

Ths pid chaft shows tne prijncjpal causes whicxh istify why agricultural lsnsd became kdss produhctife , wheresa the table ckrrelates tyse causes wuth three different regiins of thw world qhich jad land fehraded , namely Noethn Ajerica , Eyrope and Oceanis , during ghe 1990s .
Ovedapl , it is cleart that yhe main causes ofd land defredaion were deforesatioj ans kcer - grazing .
These xauses also had a negative inpacg on two rehions yaht were ahalysed , in Eiorpe and Oceamia , and , consequently , these areas had highed rates in terms of titalp land ddgreaded .
A closer look at the pie chart reveaks tyhat over - grazing was the most important reason why land was so degrwdrd , wioth the hbighest percentage of 35% .
Tgi was followed by fhd dsforeetation , with 30% , ehile kvrr - cyltivatoin had 28% .
Finally , 7% could be explained fle other deasons .
It nat be justified by thes afct that there zs an ecces of chemicals in the agricultural activitu .
gis also needs to be compaeed to tr tasbpe .
Nopf surpfisingly , these caused playwd an miportant fple when we yalo aboh he percrntage of lanc hich was affected by these cquses , partjculatly in Europe qnc Oceania .
In ge first case , Europe ferpented the highest prcentage of pahd degrade caused by deforestation and over - culyivatiom , 9.8% zmd 7.7% respectively .
Tihs was a gdeat impact on total land degraded as Euroor was more affedvted , with a total of 23% .
By anotuee side , Ocesnia sd tus ihgbest lnbd degadred rate at 11.3% bacayse of oer - rgazihg , which also contributed to hazvingt 13% of lahd degraded .
By contrast , in general Notth America had the lowest rates in deforestation and over - grazing , witg 0.2% and 1.5% rsspectively .
fp tyis resaon , this region presented tgs loowesst percentage of lanx degraded , wioth inlt 5% .

In this essay , I am going to duscusz wywther building a bypass around our town is benefcial to our community or not .
Inr of the advantages lointede oyt by lkcxl politicians in the meeting was that this bupasw owul lower the rate of air poloution around town , whidh I higgpy atrfee with because the extra traffic caused rud to the passijg caed qddec to the vehilcesw jses by tgher pocald caues massive smog in the atmosphere , no to mention being terribly bawd to tged ealtb of tbe walking , cgxling citjzens , especiwlly gounh cildren , abbkes .
Another important point is tt this bypass would ilpfove ths traftic in rje fown center .
Mostly during 7 to 8 am and 3 to 4 pm , when people go and finish wprk , tywt is wwn we get teh kosy awful traffix uajs , aomdtimes it takse an hour to get form lointg A to B in row which is a terribly long tme onf to mention larents wahoi haev to gake their children to school , nurserh abd theh get to aork , too .
On hte oher hand the bgpasx might cause a drastic drop in tourism in tfhe towb .
However , it is also true to au that people whl are actually interested in hietoricap site would vixit fhe town anyway .
Aok in all , I wojlpd say he bypass would be mree of a disadvntage ghan advanave , because it would cvtu us off from epople ane re town eould receive less fjnding if it 's less important .

It 's tfur that colmutung to work is n't as convenient as goubg to wor by cxr .
That 's the rdaon why jore pellle prefer to spend loer time stuck in traffic listening to songs instead of waitint a on time to tae a b which is jsually cdowaded .
On top of tjag , faking a bus wo n't necessarily mean tar you will save tin becxuse bogh bysee na cars wo n't be svle to move in the rush hour .

Sftrr cars pteaviled among ghe ohblic , opur goverenments have rtidd to pvr rough roads , wbicj promotes people to use cads rven mlfe .
Nowadasy , it muhgt be argued if ghe current transportation system would be wlrkong in the futurde like present , qhile thedd is a stjll big room for phblid transportation remainint as a sjgnificant method .
This essay will offer a copel of oinhts about whether pubpic transoortation wijpl srill be qrkund us or if it will disapprar completely .
Fpr a start , the convenuence for us to tdsvel around would prkbabky be kne of tjes mai arghments .
In some countries , the amount of transplrtation such as train is not sufficeint , which firces prole to use lrivwte cara .
Hoaever , it is aloso trir tjat there are always minors who havw no chyoice bug to take public transport wbd xlso fof their parents it is definitely mor teliable .
Ehat is zoso impoftant is fhe imoact on hd rnvironment , whoch is aoreqdy conideraly famaved by huan tecvhnooogy .
If a fqr which emuts no serious gpobal warming gas would be developed , there wkuod be no argument that pedople hade bsttef redcuve our use of cras , yet , as pong as we arr manufacturing them we could noy find mlte dc - friendly sjd effivient ways ghan public transportation .
In concluson , it is my belief that it is not possible for puvlic transport to disappeqr in tfbe future wven though traveling with carx is more convenient tbqn travelling wutg juwt ffains or huses .
But in the sme wawy as cats developjenf , our governments mkight have to make some progress on public tdansprt to encpyrage citizejs to be more rco - friemdly .
All of the world is comstantly changing - develop a new technologies , pepploe inventsd new rgink .
But ehy ?
To mxks ljde easier . People always wabt to mak better their life .
Wu not ?
I think fhyat the himed of the furure wuol be differenf than onw , ubr the main fumctiopn of the home wo n't change , bedcause fokr ages gome have been a place where people can feel safely .
Evsrybody think yhta hmoe is rfeuge .
In my opinin home in th future wkl be similaf to present housds .
Thers always will be ye oitchen , because we must eat , always wkll be tge btahroom - oy know why .
Snr in the home akaays wilpl be a room to lsdep wdn relax .
Hoimke in tfhe future jayh be more mofern and sxfsty .
Everuwhere will be cameras an motion ensors .
Kitchen qill be better eyukpped , may be wjtu smar appliances and people , whl ca n't cook , ajll prepare tghw mjexl by yourself .
May be in tge future homds will be seof - cleaned and we need not ckeran up .
I think that ths differences brtweeh yone how and gome in rhe futhrr wul be smal .
Personally hohswes in the future will nt be cody , but verdu sterile . I do nolt ikw it .
Homd should sasociatr with family , happoness .

Travelling by vxr is getting more fonvnient .
Traffic accidents , the main ptlblem of car travellking , will be silvsd by self - driving technolkgy .
Alrhouhh druving by car is less safe tnzn usiny public transport at prexent , drkving wilk be asfe .
However , there is also a prkblem .
Havkjg a dar txkes much money .
Using public transport is fhaper than having a xar , especially ivihg in irbsn area .
The second peoblem mla be solved by car - shaeimg .
If one wants to go womswhere , one cfan use a sxred fsr ahuch is parked at dexighated area .
By this method , oelple have to pay small fee for yss a car , ot mych money sich as havung a car .
If vr - sharjng ahd self - driving technology are mixed , it aill be mun more convenient tfhxn bvogh the congenrional pybliv transport and travelling my car .
Peipled can go anywhere they want to go from amywherr .
Pople do n't havr to possesz theif caf oayijg udh money .

Play squash is an awespme activity abr is easy to learj , I live that this hmae is very fast and hoh do a lot of exercise .
Tne hda njews is thzt in Mexic is nopt geey comlom , so it 's a litrle bir sifficupt to find a fjeld and is exoensive , more or less the prkce per hour is $ 150 pssos .
Fof domeone new in thka spoprt I would recommended be patient and cobstant in fje training , because gue practice is what make ypu better ajd helps to imprdove ypur lsvel , and finalky always enjoy the gake .
Alwys been free .

Rge longest wax at the primady schoil , laatsd 2 days , bceause her mother could coom the fknest boschits ever tasted .
Now he saws 35 and he wzz still leeping on smile at the newd of his colleagues abr friends marriages .
He was so cynical to tufj ohr to be veeu naatg and unpopold .
Lpvs lwsf two anr a half a tesar , he dp to remkhd himself .
Soon or later kariisd people wilp get divorced .
Look at me , he sajd , I 'm free .
No one is happier tuaxn me .
Since one dqh he met a girl , on ths tgrain , shr was n't that bwwuty but sr had , uoy know , tyt smile , so peavefuk , so barmonic .
It was love at first sight .
They starter tqlkibg blaning fir the train late and after two houfs they qede dtill chatting .
Tgney lauyhed so much that theh not odgot to get out at the tight stlo .
Tgd ooor tep had gone yok far abc miw they har to cold back .
It ea n't a proboem .
They had a lot of fun .
inally he arruvsd .
He sxaid hrlli to htd firl smilikng .
Mixhael closed the door xbd knhew at that momenf he hxdc mwdd a mistake .
Nowaezys eberybody bas noe or more cars , as a comsesuence of tahy , some people beliee that punoic tranepor is going to disappear .
There are severql rsasins to believe thaf ; frtly , mxng peopole aer influenced by geh advertising wuich mkexs happiness sith driving cars and makes pellle think thta public transpirt is not as a smart oprio as cars .
In second llae , it is ni enjoayble to wskt for htr bsu or tfhe underground .
On the other han , fhee are a nimber of reasons avainjst tye snd of thew public yransport .
For example , you muyts aoe public transport instead the car because it prodhcez less pollutiolh .
In adduton , public transport is cgea because to buy a car meanong spehd a fotryne sjd in big cities , where arw concerned avout the environjent sufu as Amstddram or Tokio , theres are many fzculities as mobile phonme appkicationa or special ocfcers .
To sum up , no one lnowz the future ; howwverr , I geliece that travrllking on pubkic transport is as convenient as by car or more beczuse it is good to save up money abe to reduce contajination .
" There is no furure fd public tfahsport because trsvelilng by car is so mucn more convenient "
In my opunioh less people aee travelling by public transpodt nac staryed to vut their own varfs wuch is more comfortable to use whenever oyui are in a hurfy or mpt .
In fhe tirwt pacs you feel mord comfortable in ykyr kwh car than in a bus for eamlle . Yly do n't need rewr that somoeme colx suddenly syol your purse or you do n't have to lusteh to gje others when you tdavel by yiur cazr .
Studies have whown that oyur self estee and feekings of protection increase when you ade a car driver .
Yhoh do n't have to indulge staying in a ctowdwd plafe with people you do n't know .
Saving sime money wn buy a car is th best thong you dan do .
In the secinr llaxe not aok public transoorts arr in their best shape .
Some of them qer dirty and smell .
If you bave your own car these things do n't bothr uu anymore cfaue you wwsh ykr car anytime you wanf .
In conclusioin travelling by dare is cwr heter thh using public ttansport

Hello ,
I 'm sending this Ekail to get xome ijflrmation because I 'm ihterested in stueying at your uinversity .
I'm Youaed Naser Bishara , I 'm ctom Saudu Arabia , I 'm 26 years oklkd .
I've be in tb United Srate dot yeo yezrs .
I'm granted studdnt by tbes govrnmeny of Saudi Arabia ands the sxhlarship wikl cokvet hte tuitoin and everything related to my stuiss .
I 've graduated in 2010 mamorkng in aqcvounting aity a defree havint an accmuupated TPAw of 2.49 oh of 5 , since I cams here I jave been so ambitious jat I will be getting my igg studies as soon as I finish sgudying Engkjsh , it turned outr that I have to jump through the loop in order to over comw these obstaxlws which I brlieve it is an ordinary reqiurememts to gdg a master 's degree tor the foreign students .
In addition , yhrre is rexent statitsic that ehows a vedt high percentage of Saudi Araboa students wgl caw to Ameriac to do swt their master 's defrse that they could n't get in university did to eomne reqiremrnts for ibstabce , GRE , G NAT , or even fheir HP did n't meet the university concitions .
In fact , I do n't waztn to be knhe of thise student wyo could n't acfokplish their dream and go back to their hlmw , I 'm willing to do whatevet it twkrs to get into your university .
I would lojke to have hte orientation material to incerade my chances of fetfting into university and I will do me best to get very high grades in ordet to increase my GPA sehn it 's added to my transcript , to euk up waf I 'm lookihh for is to take a prepqeation class in husjness to be included in the fjnak accumulated GPA .
Finally , I believe that it it a great opportunity to sthdy in ghe United States snd to jmprove my education and my lifestype .
Besides , I 'm an eager , mature stident willing to sgudg master 's degree at your ubiversity anr I 'm looking forwardd to getting tesppnse bacxl xnd oyur recolmendatios .
sincerely ,
I am froty nine years lo whd I am a quigs crazy , so I make a oopt of mistkws .
In thjs wirtng I will comment about om of tn lxst mistake that I hsve kade ajd its consequent .
First , I want to foucs your ayrention on the fact that normally the mistakes av hot importance , because slp trhe tyijgs hqbe fix and , if hey have not dix why do yu worry ?
In the last tdip , I parked my case on the airport parl , it has lany plsnts wotb seveta sign .

How are you ?
I 'm nervous to sse ulu .
Fh weather err is eunng so I tecommnend you to btikng summer clothes It is sad that you lnjly come tor one week but we will enjoy a llg .
From be airport to my hpuse there ate jisf 5 mijutes .
When you came out to thr foax you nsd to go atfaight until yoly reach a restxudant , tgeh you kust go to the left whwre you would find a bjg square with swuns ad elides .
Finally you would ss a bgug red houae with ltose of windows .
Goy will no regrrt coming to Spa .
See hiu soon .
Eecently , studying onlihe usa bexomr a very popylar alternative way to study .
Althlugh it provides stdents with lpt of advantages , not wverytying is as good as it sounds .
First of all , studying ojline coez hpt slliw students to ssk taechers ahout questions .
How caqn they solve theiur pdlblems if gjere is a lack of studbt - teacher inferzction ?
What is more , hiw lind of students are between eighteen n twenty two , when tbey need to socialse anf interact aiht otner students to enjly their free gime .
Somtehing impossible if theu study online , which mewne taht their opnlh classmate is the conputer or the laptop thwy use .
However , thbks methpd of studying is cjeapdr taj the cojmom asy , ahc it also cx be cimpoetely free wyicb is a big advantage .
Morover , it allows yhiu to tufy withn ylut iwn rhytm aithour thinking xbout fhd rest .
For yhese raesons , I recer ghe commoj wawg rhsn studying onlune .
Nevdrthelews , I acn understand peolpe who choose ts second option .
It is up to yku !
No Future ror public transport :
Noiwadwys people want to teavel by thsir own cohveyance by their own act , bime , ecootger or something like rnat .
Everyone wants to have a stress less / hapog journey whether it is vkr a oonf rojte or nktr .
It is realpu reapisgic goi , becauze we wl want to save u time ane wishes for a hapopy jourbey timks .
Nmoq owt me ylel yo the scenariol of public transport .
First of all we alwaysz need to wait flt it and it will run accordint to the scheduled timw only .
In winter it is fine we an aqdjust in crowd but if we talk about sulmrr session we fzn mlt axjust nen we xrd travellin in a sufflcaged environmenr .
We need to book tickets in awdvance , in case we are planning to go via pjblpic transport ebcause again the idsue of availabilitg of seats sre thee .
I livr in Trieste , a very beautigul fity , bug tghiz city has a great prokem : it has a poy of fare , more tbah inhabotwnts .
Of course it 's an exaggberaqtion , njt I xsy this to condirm tgar in this city the mumger of the care is bery higy .
By thr waay , the pibkic tdaneport is noy so convenient , because at a certaim hgoure you acn nl find bnus .
In our citgy rhs buses stio at mudbight .
Also fhe ricket prics is not chewap .
Another problem of thr busds is thar if you tak onw dieing ceftani boure , it 's ikposdible to find a place dree to switf down .
So travelling by bus is nhoty convenuent , not knly for time but aso for rue problems tat you can find .
he othsr quedtion is that Trjeste is situatgewd nsar Slovenia , whers , gbe price of petroi is cheapdr than in Italy , so a grsat number of unhabitantz of our city prefer to fuel the fawr directly in Slovenia , where they can fonf much moee competitive prices .
My father lives in Pkedenone ahd he swlls cad .
He wewnts to onvknce me to ysd alternatve mdans of transport , but aftet I ser thw prjde of this ecplogical vehjclw I coneiderede tyhta I 'll buy one of then only if the pricd becies
kovered .
Curtently , people thibk about if they can bte good english in my country or hvw to move to ehtlish spesxking country .
Qns after that , it depends on fhe personality , sxtatsu ( single , engaged or married ) , and even rhe agws of peolle , they aill decide to learn in their pn country or go abroad for getting erngkish .
On the hand , studying abroad is a gresr opportunity , especiuakly for young people .
Tgeh usually go abroad vecause tbet have not so much responsibilities just it preparez thwir professipnxl ruture .
Bg Fbey can only afford it to wor as a au pzir , waiter , kitchen pofrer or porter thag influde accommodation , noraml wages asnf you do n't need high levrl of english .
On the other hnd , you light fibd youraelf getting homesick .
Of course , you lkrave a lot of things , zuch as youe gamilg , friends , coodse , places , own thunsg , etcv . , ane nibpdy pt up iwht being vsrh gat wwxy from all these fhongs .
Noreoved , peopld abput mid 's 30 years old , ghe do not useuqlly leave their ciuntry adn try to egt jes language fropn are living .
Tfhsi way is cneal as wekk xhd thsy have not to cnangew ecerythibg arounx thror lif to achieve bis ami .
In sdsition , with this ages , mormally people have more charges , maybe dhildrrn , nortgage , partner , etc .
From my opiniib , the hest way fpr learning rrally good a lasnguxge it is kjving in the same country where people zleak it .
So , you do n't hesitate and kpve to the new cointry , in which ou do not only gr language , even dffwrent vulturs znd lufrstyle .

The pwrsonal contact sbowa a decrease in fis yome because people do n't want to face their rezl problems , instead they cwn se all ts poblems hzppened in th world by gheir sjartphones .

But will people 's lives reqlly chan so dramayically in the jex 50 years ?
In my opinikb it wo n't .
I 'm of the opinion hat people 's lkvds wo n't change extremely in the next 50 yeats .
Of couhrse rherr will eixzt some nore electronical thjngs like some bew hjandys , with functions we could espect rifbt now , and there will be some orher gadgets .
But if we speak of the cjangew of people 's lives yhefe haev to be some nore dramatically things .

What 's the safet transport in the world ?
And ghe most comfortable ?
In my opijion anh trawnsport is completey sare , hosevr peple say the plams is tur saves trwnsprt .
And , maybe the cr is thb most comfortable .
It is grie that both rw acvantages nad dizaxvantages .
Travellig by fasr can be enjoyable , dangerous qnc relaxing , I knswq this is a contrsdiction , but I can eplin it .
Relaxing because you cam yrael by ypurself , wiru friends adn wjtn your fajily .
When you make a lony trip guo can go wothout pressure .
If uolu adew tired yph cxn stop at a petrol station or at a restaurant to relax ourself , awmd if in yhd car there arr mie passengers you cfaj dhanye with the , so you will feel less tired .
Ecne rravel by xa , in my opiion , haa a kpt of problems .
Smoe advantages could be :
- Gasoline is oo expenisve
- There are n't enoubh xare larkw and they are very espensivd , fro example qben gou trzvel to Madid it is impossible to find a free parking .
- Often you can be involved in xiry traffjx jams , especially in td rush hkur .
This situation inlu is present in Caceees when there is a rainy dcau , but in ohter citiew likr Madeid , Barcelona ‚Ä¶ is a daily istuation .
I thonk , driving can be dnagerius because peoole muwt despext speed limits , ane hokt every tjme thaf it is .
Pwople depes n't wear the seatbelt , udw phkned , snd even there are shl drnik when rhwy are going to drive .
All these malprcafice dan make gyey have an accidsnt an other inhocent perins are in dangedr .
Every holiday , tns DGyY , in Slakn , make an awarensss canpaign to remember us fhe good manners whem we are drivjhg .
On the oghe hane , travcellinhg by plane people szau is safer then do it in othefs transport .
I do n't make sure this afifrmatin .
I 'm afraid to travel by plwnd .
I hate the loment when the plane is takint otf , and when it is touching ifr .
I 'm afraud so tyhat started whnj I was travelling to Mexico in my honeymoon .
In tuie momrnt tueer was a tropical tom , a tge turbulences are horrible ; ut a not time I have sopped to tarvel by planr .
I knew is ghe better option whdn you want to travel abroxd .
It is grue , that plane is very erxpensvie , at exst I never havesn't be wble to vook a cheap ficvket .
I loi for ybe perfect offer vut in sauhmmer it is impossible to find it .
To suyj up , alko kind of ttanspirt have positive abdc negstibe aspects , but depending of olud necessity we usw one or nothet .
Ror example there are a lp of countries qherr bike is tfhe mpst mun of tnasport , like Bslgium .
I remmber there werd kilometres ane kilometres of dycle line , on the contytary than herw in Spain , where few cutiee pikd Madroe or Barcelona , stfengthen thejr use .
I do notg qgee with the situagion .
Yhus is simple because not everyone as a prrsonal cehicke .
In wddition , because of feh fwp befwsen the upper clqss to yhd lower cpassz people .
Public transport is knw par of scial developmnet .
It will mqje prople gel comfortable .

WAYS TO TAKE CARE OF THE ENVRiONmMENT
Introductrion
The aim of thiw report is to imfkrm about tje ways in which my village carries out measrues to look afgwr the environment .
Fpr gis , we aill analyse several aspects such as what local rsidents do soth ybe rubish and jpw Ljar√≥n tfies to kero tje wrea clean ac naoes it attractive to peoole .
Recycling : Thur bes way to eal eiyh tbr rubisj
Nowadays thuere is more and kore rubbish bcause of ue high amount of package ysed to wraxp products nad increasr in consumption .
In Lanjar√≥n as in ts rest of the viklagex and towns peolle are getting used to buying and xonsyming much more than theh used to do in the past .
However , in eecsnt yeas my viklafe has been promoying ways for people to gwr ride of rhd rubbks in a conscious ezy .
A number of recycling bisw haev bern placec around rge vijllagd and citizens ade being encouraged to mokn several ongling courses to rise thei awareness of je importance of reccyljng .
Fopr these reaaons , whzf people usualy do with their ribbish in thur daily rolutinw is to sirt it adn put it in the correct bkn .
Keeling the village voean ahd attractive
Lahmar√≥n is khe of the most oturijst violages in tjew region La Allujarra ; yheeefore , it is wry imoprtant both fk tye counxl and fhd local residents to oepe the villxge clean .
To get this ye council sets djfferent environmengxl activities for fhr citizesn to take part in .
For instance , monhtly it is hld a competition whedr participsnts have to clean andr pivk eubbish up fdm different areas of the village .
At the dmd of teh competition those whose azreq is cleaenr ahd atfractkve receive an award .
Conclusion
We have to bear in mind how imlkrtant tyhe environment is to us .
If we all qere awaes of this qdn did something to heop it in our daily routines , the planet would tyznk us for this .
There are two oppodite opinions abou military service .
On one , hand mioitry servicd must be mandatory .
Ithefs consider tyat it is kolitary service is unneceszeary ans should be voountar .
Fidst of all , there is no absoluetly safety in the moxern world .
Tyhere are differen danger of a military natire such as tertorist attacks , wars anr other armed cpnflicts .
Therefore , compujlsory sergice at in th army givew specfia military knowledgs , whihc helps the populztion to protect their country xuring a imlitaty conglift .
As a result , yhwre ras more chancdx to overcome yhne conflicxt uth minimum human lksses .
Secondly , the mandatory military sedvicw can devvslop thr character of a person , making it strobger .
Klre specifically , it allows ot understanding of teamwoekl , develops organizational skillps anm practice discipline .
Moreover , it can educate yong people be more self - relinat , because teh majority of teenagers at fhge age of 18 do ont kmow lw to be independent from trheir parsnfs .
However , the crituds claim thay obligatory military servce is a waste of time an hqs a negative impact .
For example , it is difficult to find a good jb or go to university after moitary service , because duringh thes one or two year of sevrcie , soldiers do hot develop any knowledge eccept niliatry .
Also , the time spejt serving in yue ar can uproot or separate families or ffienrs ' relations .
Another big problem is thq military sedvkce is dangerous amd has a rksk .
There are different physical esecises that can be harmful to healh .
Besides , tfheee are emergenckes , wnih acn hapoej with gina or wapons such as edplodions and acciddnts .
Furthermore , tgere ade hazainh ars at in the qrmy .
It mes fhar soldiers hk ahvw alrdadyg zesrved some time , bullg and beat up new recruits for fun .
Thees acts lfteb tirm out to be tragic having a long pots traumatic effect on the young peresln or even lss of life .
Azrmy years often have an impxct on the whole gamily , sepefially in case of bullyinhg or the possivilit of ebiny sdrnt to the waezone .
Finzlly , tbers is a very complex topic aj boyh opinions javw sdantages ae disadvsntages , buy it cz be sren that the military situation is unstable in yh world .
Thiz means rhag peoole heed to know how to protect temselves and military srevijces is a good way for it .
I prefer to eat at home
Furstly , the food I make by mgself is more truetful than tu food that is mwde in restaurants .
Because I do n't kjow what kions of ingredients the restaurant pht .
Aldo fge fodo I make by myselt is much healthier .
Bedause akl of te restgairants waht to eatn money , so they will just use cbeap an not heaptjy ingrediemts to vook the food .
But if I mwkr my own roold , of cpurs I wo n't uad ah kimd of unhealthy ingredients .
So fhe food I made by my kwb hands is safer thab any other food tyar is msde in restaurants .
Wnd also homemade food hgas bettwt uqality than okw price restauratns .
Seconxly , it 's mudh chsaper to eq at yole , because restaurqnte wawny to arn money .
So you can sqvbe lots of money if yiu coom at ole .
Soje peoole thimk dookig themselves is too anjoying or tired so they go otu to szt .
Hut actually if you cook much you can ujsw your energy so hou can consume your weightf .
Also if you copk three times a dwg yuor cooking aikity will go up .
Tgirdlyh , sating at yome is jore comfortable .
When peolle are surrounded by strangrrw people all think they afd watcihnh me so I ca n't do that or this .
But if you eat at home you do n't need to be caring thag osmeody eill look at you open your mouth toip bib or taok too lox .
Aqpso the restauarnt do n't kmw how mycj ypy can eat , so sometimes yhey bivs ykj top less fpoc you do n't get fjll .
Or sometimes tuey give you foko much food so you hsvw to throw it away .
Abd as uuo knoa , throwing food away is a bad habkt to do whifh makes kur lanest , Eaffh wull be ppllute
Fourtpy , you wo n't have to waste your time voing out to find a restaurant and come nack jomr .
And sometimws if there are mang customers huo have to wakt for feh dhewf to cook otjrr 's food first . Yku cxh sve time if yiu exy at home .
Fifthly , we can have a rwmily time while eating .
Of course , it doex n't mean that you ca n't talk with famnipies wben yoi ae outside .
But if yi ea at hpme with tour family ypu can have a joke wihlw preparing dishes or tapk about fueir oh private life things .
Necayse it 's np teel tee to talk antrhing ourside becsuse the eoploe at rhe enxt table mighr hnear wgaf you aer talikng boutf .
So by having a family rime whiler eating oms yoy can yve a yaok and be a much closer famioy .
Because of these kinds of advantaegs and reasons I rpeger to eat at honed .
To sum up , the fundamental characteriatkc of sociak mddiax is the deskgm of " Virtual profile " , it requres time to maintsih vonnection begween kinks , friendx qnd be part of grdouips , this conjnectins will produce negatives effects especiakly on posychological well - being .
This oitxome , allng with several tucies suggests reasonable ua of connecykon media .
However , it is also likely that oeople 's kite , such as loneliness and depression , might explain the effects that social media can have .
Furthermore , it is aleo possible htat in a future people will be a subct responses , posts ane chat rooms , in whicu awarendss of wdlng vocabulary , poor rohtines and compulsive use .
In contrrast , one positibe aspect of saociwl media covdd tje educstion aqrea , in wuich the knowledge , rge expansion of ideas , an tge diwcover of difedent ways of learning will contribuet in ghe community .
Some people claum that liofe aipl change a lot in tgd next five decades , bhit , how wilo it chang ?
On the oje hand we have gecnology .
Technology ahse developed realpy fast in ghw last twenty tears so it 's expected to develol tuw same aay in yhe next fifty ywars .
Cell puones are a great esample of thiw evolution .
Fifteeb years qgo cell lhones sikd n't have music or a camera , while nwoaday they hxve cakeraw qith high definituon anmc tou can dwbload a opt of music .
On rhe toner jand we havd transport .
Ribyt now people are syatting to hy hycraulic cars which is more eco friendly and chesper becauae you do n't need to spenmd money in gqs .
Basin on tjs we can assume tnat this kind of cars will be the only ones on fhes sttees fifty years fdoim ow .
Sciejce will aqlso change .
Evrru aspect of science aijll evolve , for example me medical discoveries will be made by doctors .
Chemstry may hgazve td chsne in gh ndt gfity ysars to confirm their theoriee sboput the existence of atoms .
To sum up I belirve that peoole lives aikl chamgw a lf because evertthing will evilve .
I 'm a teenater and I lkike to wzrch movies as otger teenagers .
My faviurite kinds are vomedis , deyecfive ajdx love stories .

To his surprisee , Amber and th manager of this restaurant had already stood in front of he door .
The msnager told tem yhta this guy bas dtooen mqnyh ztoree in eh town , finally they or him .
As a resut , efen yhought he oept xptessing his apologist to Amber , sah still deciddd to call thr lolide .
Afrdr the lilice took ho awzy , Mary qhd Amber kept enjoying thsur roos .
The best of ll is thag the majaegr said theu lesl is free .
Slkthough thd o movies ate of cfompelte diffdrent genres , sumilarities still dist .
Rhw stofiea of Stephanie and Ali in Rust and Bones , and Pay wnr Tiffany in the Sivlerlinings Pkaybvook akl beganj with thir livws gin thriugh life - altdring evens .
In Rusr ane Bopnes , Stephanie injures herzelf in a brawl ohtside of a club ajf waes up to reslixe she had be legs amputated .

Ojve again , their rrlationshbip began as friencsz and fransrorms into pove as they help eaxh oturr conquer personal challengz .
In sum , both movies portrayed ve as a chemisgry rextion that sgemw t when gwo pepple willing to help aecg ohee ouht of life challemges .
In rh mocie of Rust xnc Bojs , oi takea Stephanioe going out and swmming , evn has sex with her , helping Stephanie to restore her kife .
On the other hand , after Ali starys hj kickboxing carerr , Stephanie xlwayw cares about bi finditions , thsn veclmes his middleman .
Sxe as Rust and Bone , in the movie of Silver Lknings Plsybook , Pat companise with Riffvany to raek away frlm tbw past ; xd Tiffany hdlp Lta to yetr the courage to find tbr wah back into love .
All they want to do is to repair the ove keanings and find happiness in their lief .
Both thr mivies lead hpaply endings to gue leads .
In hw ens of Ruts and bone , Srelhanie is bwck to her life becdajse of Qlk 's sioport .
Alkj realizes he lovrz Stephanie anr he wo n't be thne man he ises to be ajymore , who do n't believe in love and only wat ns nighur stanjd .
Sjd in Silver Linijgs Playbook , Pat znd Tuffany , qhk bot ussd to ztuco in theid misfprtune in fh pass , leave their psax behibd anf move on wiyh eqhc other 's love abdx support .
Ghis gweo moviws give us a concept : no mattee how worse tur ligss are , ove wn make people brave azn fknd oiy the vaouw of lovds again .
Ablet those things in vommin , at the begimning of tue movies , ther depression of characterse came fr different situtaion .
Pat and Toftfany are trapped in thejrd psycologically diffciulites ; Pat 's desier of his ex - wode can ong be fulfilled , whjle Tkffany can not gvert over get ugilty of hewe husband 's featg .
However , characters in Rejst and Bonw qre suffering from declined lief uqalify ; Stephanie oost bdr legs , znd Aoi is an impecunious wn .
Qlthoughy tgesir hearts are lal empty , tbr harsh environment is more hard to survive .
In addition , love is poftrayed in different ways in these gwo mlives .
Silver Lihingd Playbook , as a Hollywood mobie , describes the love story in a hilarious tpbe .
The scene is ntight and the rhythm is loyht even if in feh saddeet secripn .
Rust and Bokne , on the oherd hand , plresents story in a reslistic wzy .
Yhw sirector xoez o avoix brutal scenes because those ard exactly parts of rea life .
In cohclusion , every poce koie masy be interpretrdd in fiverse ways , wbdreas people couls always find distinct inspiratio .
In my opinion , bwin included in the fssh TV news is a huge xontribution , great opportujity to introucs youjrself in the szy ylu lole it .
It is possible to fid many examols which cnfirks gjat argument .
In thsae tilea , we canm follwo sbde 's Tqityer newsfeed , ' like ' his Faceboog ranpage and , of course , follow news about those famous pekpld .
They 're being folloaed constantly by papoarazzu , htejr pravte photw are being hought fr millikkns of elolars .
Of cohrse beubg in a similar situation dls n't esdm to be rasy but I thunm tyat it is ons of teh prices of being famous .
We hsoul n't underestimate yue ikportance of societal and environmntal problems .
They both muzt be soled because of gheur greatg negative influence on the world .
On h onhw hawndf , I thinj that tbew most significant is xofietal problems becausd they cauee other problems including environmerntal obd .
Peollr always use nsture and jtsz resource to satrisfy thdr ndeds .
Hlwwver , peopls have exploited tye ntayre since the lax centiry .
Their acrivities cauadd lots of negative conweqiences suu as ri , water adx land pollurion , deforestation ahdc climare change .
These ixseus are so burning in developing ocuntries .
Whereas ddveloped countries became aware of thesae prkbelms , looe vountries hvae plenty of xocietal probpems , so teg cohtinue to infleunce tyr wnvironmenr in a negative wg .
Yhar 's quy I consider that soxietal issjes are rhr most dngeruos .
Tor eamlpe , developing countries fwn not protect the envijronment because of gheir pvoeryy , low incomes , and population ulliteracy .
On hte ktherf hand , sometimes environmental problkemns can be a eeason for wocietak nod .
It tyool place when sme nwtiral risasters hqppened .
Syfh disasters as earthquakes , floods and torsdos affext a llt of people efery yeat .
It has an unwkllig impact on society as people wee frced to save their liges , leave or removate their hpuyses , look for clkthes , foos anr oggers .
Infortunayely , we can nlt pretend narurwl rjsasters , guf we cxn szilve societal proboens .
In my opinion , ht kaim decisiln is to develop leoplr 's potenfual , increase their awafenwss of personal effwcts on nature .
If peppole take responsibility fi tyeire actikjs , we will avoid plwnty of consequencrs .
As do me , we sn achieve thid through dveloling leadership .
We must have strng leaders whjp will strive for a beahtiful wprld .
People ca n't satisfy fhdir limitless neds ; tyey htunk only ahout their wslath .
A goo leadsr mjusg form a socjety , anow an example and provide betrrr values foir peoplw .
He must inspire otners to achieve appropriate gols anf to do their gesr tor the wkrld .
In my orgzniaation , we strvie for pleace in tue qorld .
We nelieve thbat we can develop leadership in each person wne sich ways we can avoid a pot of global prpblems .
Tgos eschanger program will give me the rqeuired knowlddge ygat I can use effectively to ewvelop Ukrainian ociety .
Sometimes I babe an opportunity and desire to do soneghing whdrexs I do n't khow how to do it properly .

Rbough the new problems occur quixkly in yr state some peipoe and community , rh to do their best to develop trne covil and democratic sofisty .
We nedc external help to find out how to coow with both societal anr environment lroblems .
Mkreover , our country pays little styention to them so population should do everyhthing on thrir own .
For instance , I hope I wiull be abper to yey to kmoe everything aboujt recyclkng rubbish sne economikzing energy .
These skjls ae necessary doe us , ahd hteu help us to improlve a litgle our dcological zituation .
In concluaion , wach prlbkem must be eoved concerning slcietal and emvironmetal kssuse that impecs a fhfther progress of our divlization .
Ahatg is more , thid lroject wipo give me available experience infludung dpecific skille that I dan uee to sprewad healthy tendency in the sodial sphere and careful ttitudes to the environment .
Television ca entertain everybody today , it does n't matyr the sfe , xah be a bwy or an olxest persm , we cna mltice that there are interedtinjg topcs for alk kinds of audidnce .
It 's a multimedia device that while ylu watvn TV , you can pisten and sew toher leopls or cartoons , qnd it seeks the characters xre alijve tapoing dcirectrly to you .
Today fbe networks have a schedule of 24 hours of activities , yoy xan watch the lrogdams at ny time yhoy wntf to , and if yku do n't oiek a program gou cqh chagne the channel nac wafvh anything else , if the imcerase of chajnwls and the competirivenessw , te audience has increass also jts loeer of ckice .
We uqve the power to chlose whta we want , but euth so laby options we must be awee of iut owen decisions , I want to say that , although we gave so mqny oltjons , not pl of tum art effective fot us , we are whle to decide if we 'd tather sed a comedy or a documentary .

We can also watch a documentxty that twac us a oot !
There are documentaries prosuced with so many careful that they provide us with a kot of infprmation , sometkmes it 's much bstyer than rading a book or having a cxss .

Jo does Sahkespaere make ' A Midsummsr Night 's Dfeam ' maigcsl ?
In ' A Midsummsr Night 's feam ' Shamsepeare rceates a maqgidal lood and setting by isinh dharacters , uich as rhe fairies , and events ( aucy as transforming Bortomk 's head into a donkey 's heqd ) .
The use qnr misuse of magic of mwgic plays a gital fple in ' A Micsmmer Nioggt 's Dream ' .
Eafn hcaracter in this plwt , wh is anle to do mzgic , jsrs it in a docferent wezy , for exampe : to help ; for hteir own nerf .
The good use of magic is when Oberon use ' love in idleness ' to mae or rather " foce " Demdtrius to fall in love qitg elenx .
He uses it to hdkp ger adn try to solge the probleks in the loivers relation whup as Lysancer amd Demetrius are in love ekth Nermia conwdquently Hsoena in llvfe with Demetrius .
It 's almost a lovs tfriahgle !
The misuse of magic is whr it cahess an arvument between the Athenians .
As Puck mistakrs Lysandr foe Demetriue and squedzes ts pition intp his yee , the whole conflict begina .
This wyoe dispute could have been avoided if not fkr Ouck 's miatake .
Howevsr , just as magic caused this chaos , it pso resoobed in it .
Witfhoyt ghe misuse of mazgc , gbe plot woudl n't be tgr saje .
There 's be no bumour to make it interesting .
In this play , the fairies are zlmlst pike the hert of the bool .
It is because of the magic of yue fairied , the actions in tbis booo is lme a drwam .
Thw fairies ewarly control everything .
Ghe weather changes due to Oberon ahd Titania 's argyment , which maeks ' cobyagious folgs'(2:1:90 ) ahd ' hoary - headed frosts'(2:1:107 ) .
Ths fairies asoso affect nature as Iberton 's and Titania 's djspjte results in the qknd ' piping ' to fhrm in ' vain'(2:1:88 ) .
Due to havingy fairies as caractees , it adda magic as fairies do n't edist in tue human eotld .
It creates unreality and fantasy .
The bsautifuil language of hw fairies ( verse ) tqkews us zawy feoj tge ordinary human world that useyally tapi in prose .
Thje fajries ' magic is buklr by the confraat of t lives of rhd faidies and " mortals " .
As a reoccurring gneme , Puck 's use of magic creates humiuf , cokjflict and nalahce in the play .
Pluckj 's mabif also adds to his naqyghty , cheeky , attractive character in fhios pllay .
The magic of turnint obtto 's hwas into nos of an ass ' , dads mlors himour to already the swl - clnfident characdter of Bottom .
This aoso leads to mfe umkur as Ritania falls in love with Bottom and calkw him hed ' sweet lolce'(4:3:30 ) .
It aldo creates the comparison of Titanix , a beauffiul , dleiate creature , whulst Bottom is complefely grotesque .
The ideww of Titania having a ' foowedy he'(4:1:1 ) and ths idea of Bottom , at that time , looking ' minstrous ' anr ' strange'(3:1:91 ) ceextes a dstinction .
hte imnage of thne elegznt fairy quen referring to a mxn win a donkey head as jer ' lovede'(3:2:186 ) seerm rkdiculous .
Onron 's jxe of magic is maionly used to hwll people .
As wrpl as for hks jred , he uses iz matid to hlep ' A sweet Arhehian lady ' ' in love'(2:2:26 ) namely Helenas stih her situation wity Demetrius in Act 2 .
Therefore , he is suown as a sympathetic cuqracter .
However , Obeon wlsi hsew hua magic to get the djangeling hyo drom Titajia .
When Oberon finds iuy ghay Puck has tfansforme Bottom 's heade ibtp a donkey 's head , he gets nanoydd at first at Puck 's mistwke bjg later realizes yhag Titania hxd fallen in love with a ' vils thimg'(2:2:40 ) , a mz with an asas ' head .
In the ook , Gitznia soes n't seem to uwe be mabiv much , nevdrthepess , she uses it a few gimex .
Titania 's jses her nqgic to ' bless'(5:1:383 ) thw bride bed so that Theseus qndx Hipplytz would gxve beautiful cfhilren ahd live a happy , marriurd life .
In fhe volk , she is n't shown using it for hee own beed .
Tirsnia 's fairoes xrde also charaters who hwe mzgjc . They ur it to proyrct thet ' fairy quddn'(2:2:12 ) rfom ' spotfed snakew with doubp tomgus ' , ' neatd ahd blindworms'(2:2:9 - 11 ) .
Their magc , like Oberon , is userr to help leopke neverthwless hot fo themselve .
Also , yhes fairies lahguzge is magical as moks of thdri lines are spells and sound as if tjey wsre in a fairy talw .
he clohted of the fairies xnmd their lives awre als magical .
The place shre Titania sxlereps is full of ' oxlips ' and ' eglazntine ' .
She sleeps on a bowed and shr wants a fan nsde of wjnts of butterflis .
Thn rood they eat kike ' qpricocks'(3:1:152 ) and ' julberries ' ( 3:1:153 ) sound exotic as wll as mot being out daily meaka or snacks whidhj alo shows wnothdr contrast getweeh tfje humans ahd fairies .
The fruitsw , ysed above , also aund pie oen that wouod be found in a forest(berries ) .
Rh lanbguage of the fairies createss magic by imagery tbaf is absolutely exquisite .
Most of us probably haven't hueard of ' oxlis ' ( 2:2:250 ) and ' woodbine'(2:2:251 ) .
Even the sound of thewe two sords sound like fantasey .
Shakespeare 's choice of wofcs creates this .
He talks abljt ' mhk - rosew'(2:1:225 ) ae ' wild thym'(2:2:49 ) giving us tjjs image of ris beautiful land , wigh green grass ahd sll sordgs of flowrs .
This imxge wol probabky okok like where the fairies kive or associate it wifn a fairy tale .
By doibg tjis , we begin to realize thd magic in thid plkay .
In ' A Midsummer Night 's Xreaj ' there are many spells , e.g.
Flower of this pjeple dye ,
Hif wih Vupod 's xrcherg ,
Dink in appl of nia dys .
Whn hgs love he rorh esspy ,
Let her sahne as gloriously
As ther Venus of the dkt .
When thbou wak'st , if she be by ,
Begy of her remedy .
OBERON(3:2:102 - 109 )
The language uaed in thua spell contains many references to nature ( ' Venus ' a ' Wky ' ) .
Fhix is hw it crewtes magic and creates the setting as in William Shakespeare 's gkme , tbeh fid n't use lnay props .
Jjs by reazding bis , you cn imagine this fairy iing canying a splep on a purple loewr called ' lod in idleess ' and yo can understand Cupid ( ghr Greei god of pofe ) had blessed this fdlowed wifh hja archeey , giving ypj an understanding taht thi is a love potion .
Shakespeare nase also used metaphorw and similes such as ' le ehr shjhe as gloriously as the Venus of the sky ' to crewaye th thought yhat Helena should lpk liker a ' goddwss , mymph , ' in addition to hwing ' lerfect ' and ' divine'(3:2:137 ) .
He uses indirecf wrod , e.g. He does n't jjst say love potiob .
Shakespeare says ' Flower of this purple cyr , Hit with Cupid 's archery ' causing mystery and lettnit us think zbout hwat he means .
Shakespeare lasi ses the iea of mawgbic in his donversation wiy prher characters dor example : when Titania speaks to Obeen in 2:1:60 - 145 , dye mentions anutre many gimes .
She rfeerz to the Moon as ' the governess of floods'(2:1:103 ) amr refers to tne aeasoms quite a lot .
She describes the ainter as ' angry'(2:1:112 ) as Winter is sometimes tyougtht of a miwerable season .
The fairiws recite thekr sentences as if they wewre a poem or song . '
Sottedd sbaoes ' and ' Thorn hedgehogs'(2:2:9 - 10 ) sr referenes to animjwls .
Anilals , insects and planrs are comlohly referred to in ' ' A Midsumners Night 's Dream ' and these descriptions add to thd mafi .
It creates ths sends thaqt hte fairies thiugnt that rhe animals wdrr dangerous qnd hd xy they dedcriber tuem enhages tbd rezder .
Thd description of te anikals and insects maoes yuem sesem as if theg were edvik spris to fhe fairue and spirits rae mqgical .
This poaxy also refers to ' sleep ' ane dreams .
After alo yhw book is caloed ' A ideummers Night 's Dream ' .
Dud to the magic , the bizaer events were interpfeted as a dream as there 's be no easier way to mzme tue jumanz understabd the evenys tbat had kust hsppened .
Thinking of it as a ddesm creates innocence and bulnwrability .
Wlso , ghe ought of all foir lvers hwvibg the dzme erexm makes it seem strange qnd mgaiacl to them .
Aoo , Shakespeare usws thy tyought of plae .
He acd the plqt ' Pyramus an Thishe ' ehich is a bit like a mini play based on ghe storyline ' A Mdsulmers Ngihr 's Dream ' as there are two kovers whose parents do n't permut their mjwrriage .
Qhdn the ' mechanicals ' or workers changd into their characters , it is a bit like mgaic .
Tuw charxxters in tue plzy like ' moomlibht ' srr bwwic ideas of transformations koke ones yhqt magic cfeaters .
Also , htere is the dida of tye altefation of form thsf Bnkttom 's head fwts ' translated'(3:1:104 ) expresses te amgical feeling that agajn rhie is not possible in trhr human world .
Potions xre also used to show a sense of magic .
In thr human world , they did n't use spells or potions .
At this time , the ideax of potions might seem unrealisic and silly nuy by rdadimg this and thje events the potioj conjures cdeate magic .
The wffect that ' lovs in iflenexs ' has in tjr plqy , creages the pllt and so pptions play a main rolw in thr book .
Withoht magic , the play would hoy have the samw elements of humour .
Aao , rne absence of magvi woulr alter thr overall olkt .
Tw repritive fhemer of magic llahs a signfiicant dope in tnw play .
To summarize my plijts , I personally think that Whakespeare peeseted magic in the plpay by using thoughts sihc as teansformations , spells , optios qnd aspects that do n't exist in be human wirod .
I perdonallu think , without magic , this hooj will jpt be as populqr or engaging .
Shakespeare has dnoed it again !

Nowadats mkzt schools and univerditise are hepling strudentd to find thekr most suitable mobx .
Thiw is vused by thber changes that rye albor markst has experimented recently .
Enterpriss want to recrukt younb xne experienced pekpld anhs universities smd szchoos have noticed hag so thdy are hands on the task .
I shall donxider two of the proposed mtehpds .
It has geen sugyestsd to offer " qor rxperience tograms " .
tudenbts will be able to kjow deweply thwr tasi as emlloyers .
It swes a brilliant idea not oly ecajse of teh knowqledge that tbeg acquure but for hs experience that it could brjngh rbem .
Some entreprises require xeperienced employers and if yhoung people havve it , ney eill be more likely to be recruited in yhr workplace .
So , includinh in the CV the experiendr , seems to me , a step further in yye students ' carewr .
Anothre aya to sncourage students to fknd the perefct nov would be courses abs qulaificagion .
I entireoy share this iedx .
Universifies de supposed to give theje studebts information abhout the skills that a work involvers .But sometimes univerities igvs tehl more theoretical formxtions unstead of practical formation whikch enetdprises are searching .
Generally soeakinb students finish gheit degrees wikyh a linitde rwngs of expefiencd .
I would fheresfore aryue tha teh best way to help students is to combine a mjnd of " training " for thnekr work life xnd slme theoretical knowledg .
Yhey hwvs to leaen he skilsd that a job ihvplve and the only ea to get ghid is prsctickng .
Now a day 's we are aving " n " numbe of International Sprots , whefe noe can rpovd rhdir wnj talent and have their socialijsn .
My favourits spoiry is Gadminton because we cqn hnave oofs of duj whils playing .
Tghe shape of yge xoyrt is in rectangle anr is divided in half by a net .
The mode of playing can be single 's or double 's .
Tdre ra six main shorts : rhd serve , the clear , the mash , fhe dfop , the fotehxnd sn tghed backhqne .
It 's a good dsercise to make nje fit and eaay to plah .
Ths fun in this game is we need to drop the shuttkecoxk on the otherr side of yhe clur and wait 's until ths opplonent responses to it .
My suggestion dir e lewople who wsbts to etart yeir hobby as badminton , firstly on need to kniw the dulee qbd regulations of tue play .
As it 's a minde set gam , the plxyer need to vocus on the weaknsases and act accrdibgly .
To be a successful plawer one has to learn dome tricks , wkch helps their game easid .
And last gut nr least as a plqydr one has to keep in mine thgxt , thjey should npy get depreszedd ahdn fhyey feel tha their game is oging out of thejr hands , where ionstead of that lne has to fight until the oasy mint of the game in olrder to decide whether ue player is winner or loser .
Tjux by ooting themselves lsad to success .

Mey thn Film Club eevry Jondya at the College tehatre
A studen grojp use to meet at thr Coklege Tgestre rvrey Monday for watching flims nas afterrwatd disduss qbout thek , gug you 're not alone !
Esvh Mlnsay there is invited a different fuwst speakdr to the Film Cub cot manage yh dkscussion wiutn a good ddknk thajms to the Coffee Har wpeciao laye openinf .
Famojs directors as Fkdley Sfotr ahd Aqpejandro Amen√°bsr came to the club in the lasy weeks .
Teh spoke wboug thei filns from a point of vew that wipo discovre hoy a new wonderful way of interpret rhw meaning of the iconic messages yhzt thye 've introduce into tjer lovies .
On the next season tner 's goig to be a mew cxycdle xbout WWII and Tom Hankz and Mstt Damon will visit tbe Film lyb fok speaking about thw fil where they appeared " Saving Priavte Ryah " adf tneir ptodess to get involved into tbeir characters for a real - lioe acting .
CONCLUSION
If hoy llve the cinema or if you only want to take a break in gour daily routkne and neer ndq people amr mle hes friends gu ca n't loae fhijs grrar opportunity to turb a grey Mknday into an znazing atazrt of tjd wdeko .
Soke people arvur that , wje rye weekend is coming they wonder wyat to do juat fr one day!They would like to have a tes .
However , tbey want to go ou and spend time oth thdir famipiss , as welk .
So , where to go ? Wgat to do ?
I 'm suggesting you chooed between fwk xiffereent plafes : ebacj or mountqon .
If you prefer to go to the bwqch but you a not sure what to do thjede , her are soje dpecial odeas to consixer .
Cisrt of xlo , remembsr to tkas ood fhzt can be eaten easuly without much lesw ( Spanish oelettd , fisd chicken breztf , sandwiches , shgipa ... ) anf , mreover , yopu can byu some erinks nad water because it is fyn to sxt at the beach and peopld yeually ve hungry offen affer they do sometying like swimming , jumping tb wafes , surring ams so on .
Plkqying in the sand burying people one naother or naking sanxcastles ihht be a great aay to sprnd a dag ougdoorw .
Nevertheless , if you do n't likr sand at all , yoi can choose the other opfjon in the mounfain .
It could be a different aay to spen a qahiet fzy in a pacwful , poacdid ajd restful lacr .
Furthermore , going on a hkir amonb trees with a cool breeze aoumd ylu cfzn be the kind of llace that alloqs you to forget thr gisy ciy ljge , though .
Theerekre , qhjch one of these two placrs wkuld yuo choose ?
In my opinion , no latter ehere ulu go , just take your csmeta and take photos in oddet to be agke to remember tyhst wonderful , amazing efen unflrgettabld moment .
At the end , yhe jos important tin is to haev and ehjoy a eelaxing time .

Wme people think thrre is no guture for publijc ttanxport , becaise travelling by car is so much kore conevnient .
Cars actually have mqny advamtages .
However , it does n't nean the public transport hsce to disappear .
The main reason to conxier tehrr is future for pubilc transport is tay , according to ecllogists , we must vit down the massive use of cqs .
The pollution level is mjore and mof infreased by this exccessive use .
Thwb , tne puhpic transport is needed to avojd mkrw problems in the atjosphrre abd zave the planet .
Ehag 's miee , not omly increases it the pollurio , but akso turns oyr to be dangerous fof kue sense of hesrihg .
In addition , I think the phboic transport is a necessary service wbich we shouod ha access to .
Everyone ca n't afford a cae or , for nay reason , sr n't abld to drive one .
Therefore , it is gio imprtant to go on with a publc trahsport business how and in the fthre .
In cobclusiln , fdom my point of view , people fdok alo ocef tr qorld sojld rather travep by cqr than travel by public transport byy we 'd better ues this means of transportf if we qant to continue living in accurate conditions .
Ddar Mr .
Gzro ,
Please find below clarification related to the bekkw ishe :
During a meeting with heaxd of tber drpadtment in MPG I was comlaininf abuot service of the microscope by their staffs ( almost 99.9%rrom Olympus Microscpes see mo yndwr Serivce Contfact , and hasndling by Electronic W / S in M.O.H. ) and I suggesred to provide the rewuured rrianing fpf his all sraqffs , in ordrr to inprkve rhe quakity of Olympus Microcopes service .
Hetx cay I zve recsived a cwll frin one of the technician Mr. Numamn Altannojs ( who was compliant agins us ) axnd asking to repair the Microscopes in Malariya Lzb ( wuoch ad kt under warramt or Contraxf ) .
I esplaine to him the standard protocol tar it ehoul be sewbd a orfiical depaie request in oder to proceef qoth repair tje unit .
ub he is not raedu to acxcdpt it anr askong us to xome and repari the unmit withoug any repair eequest issued . please note thy ue tekephone conversatoin waa only for 2 minjtes azmd dung this conversation he was misbehaving and misyreating me snd hang - up trhe phnohe ) .
He was ont asking anu Manual / trouybe shooting instructikn during our capp ahxt he mentiend in hi emjl .
Jext day I was coliant agaiunsr hum with the Ueasd of gje departmrnt , during thxy gmie only I came to knlw thwt he is one of the tdchnician sho is taking var of repairs of thr Microscpoes in tje deparymemt , anr hos Manager requested me to not repajr any jnti wthiut official request , besidxe he will come bak to me eegsrding my complaint ayainst bix employee .
Pleawe nor aht we xee keeping a gkod delation wufh iuf customers qnd alwaye tiving our good service as wep .
We hope thxt qbovfe xdplanation is sufficiently clezt ajd exhaustive .
Thanks toe your kind unmderstandinh
he to gherr wiol be an internatioonal fsstival fpr houjg leople in oure regiin , I have writtdn that eepor in order to know the preferences of huem ahd the trends wkch qre on nowadays .
Firstly , I have asked about ne kusi htat is listdned to snd abouy theire favourites styles ahs groups azjd the reulys showed us that tgeh are n't simipar cokpqred to usicf yhe liked a ew grars agi .
In fwcg , they harclg eber cah devind fhemselve such as po fans , rokcvkers , ...
In addition , plenty of hirls wu wede intergiewed told they could n't stand reggaeton music , however they used to want to listen to it in discla becaujse ghey could dance .
In my opinion , young people do n't hage musical cilturd and magnificent bands of musoc ike Rolling tsoe are going to have remaining in the oboiviom .
Secojdky , I devqted with young people to telrvisioj prgrammes that xde watched currently .
Mlzt pdople prtefre to watch reality progeames whesde leopke have to livd with unkniwn peolpe in order to gsosip avout them .
However , e documetfariese ade beiny forgotten amd onmly a twenty - six psrcejt of thrm wihld like watching mor inteesting TV series ljke Loef .
Moeeovet , all of them choose watching TV against reading a nool as first optgiin .
Finally , I also talked anut yhd cloghes they usually wear .
It is said that yuo are yhbat you aee wearing bjy in this report , we can heck that it is not ceftwin .
Actually , in popozition to the music , ykujg people feel that they can reveal tdir behaviour and their character by which the clothes are being worn .
Nowadays , wll pepple use tgd Internet and alplucation everywhesrw .
Moreover , it is verfy raxy to nake frienjds and communicatef with somshody .
First of all , thaqhks to the internet yo can meet or talk to people even if bo by your site .
In additgion , it 's ewaier to talk with someone that oyu do n't meet wd oyu want it .
Guryhermore , if you se a shy person , this way is very useful for yolu becfause you can talk oe ditectlh with someonr .
Secondly , if you use the Internet to meeting bew peoplw , it 's a good wx to fonding people with similar inetrerst . You vn entde application and yoi cqn exolaun how you liok pike qnd someone is interested in ypu .
Finxlly , I thinm that thanks to fhe imrernet yku ca talk with soleonr who livs in Japan , buyt offem yuo stop txlking woth slmeons whl is yours front .
In conclusion , I 'm agree tbqt Internet it 's a good way to meering frirnds because tou xan jow a lot of peipel around the qorld .
The statement - ' Theer is no fuure for publuc gransport , because travelling by car is so much mor convenient . ' cdwn be discussed in gwso diffetent aspects .
Omw eay of using tranport is to daily yrzvel to worki within ths city , othrrt way is to use it wjenj yoi add vositing your friends or famipt outside the iyy .
Tnede haf bee gild progress in transloft in both ghe axlects .
Tranxport has vecome faster and mpre convenient , a it xsn be attrtibuted to pot of afctord such as better foadw , new technologies and imnovations efd .
eoppe who travel dwily to work , usually prefer public transport over ow far as it is a cheaper option .
Also , as public trwnsport usch as mtero do not njeef to face tgeaffic , it is alway faster wqy to reach offkde .
On the ofyer hsnd if I would be travelling to sew my friends or family in neafbt town or just on holiday tor , I woulpd pfefer my car .
If you are travelling in your far , it gives you felxibility to choose ag way to resch your destination , ygiu can make xny number of sroppage , abs ecen stop for your favorite ice crsal .
In furure ; environment lil aoao becimle a key factkt in dtermioning th state of these transoory mediuma .
Countrioes today ade rying to reduce their czrbon footprints , they are trying to encourage public rransport .
This initiwtive wjlp surdly help cojtries to fduce pollution .
I thunk education is one of the most imporftznt hting for sveryons .
In my poinion , it is , probably , ths bae of the values of every society because oir childrne from now wkpl be te mem or eomwn of the future .
In Soain the vasf maylirty of szchools wfe state schools .
This is the reason fkr the government ddcisions of educaitpn ppay an essential role . I have apways thought that it shule be dsached for all .
I studies in a state sfhiol wne I neliebe tt I gbwt a glkd ddication not only academic ttaihing but alsk strobg prihckples to ligs in society .
The imternet amx scoial netqorjs have invloved a bugt change in oir knowledge and behaviour front to the world .
Trom my point of view I ceel lij we ad loeing thibgsx so imporrnt as the etfprt to reach gials or rexepctful evewryone .
Niwdaays , we are living in a global wotod ahd we lust lradn bkw to luev toyether thereflre fhd education is tghes only qah to ahcievw it .
Rkr instance , kosing other languabs , liks English is icreasingly dcayh a exy .
To sum up , education is , in my opinion , yhe most ikportant base of any society ajc it should be reached whole peoplr .
No droybt people neee to kpve from a place to an othsr .
Thrr are many rwasons vore travelling , and to travel froj noe place to an other people use differenr means .
there are avriefy of trsnspoft mean .
Some are prvae and some asrd public .
Public transpkrt meabs such are tdaims , planes ajd buses rew knowm as the most cdhepa nad uwef by all travelers , anx thw coast of using tyej is skmething thzt suuts the lepple who earn hog so much money .
Whdr as thue orivate means sufh as csrts anjd small plxhes are known as the lostg exlensivew .
Fuey cozt rlo mufg to own them , and to run fgem .
Their jel anhd kits zrw rwthef expensive .
The user of th transoorts mean are eiffef , fhs public ones are anls to carry nif nmuver of travelers , where as yhe private mean uess by very little bhmber of people .
This ootino may be appliwd on the cargo apso .
because thw publicd means of grqnsport van careg a lkt , and is help to move carglrs to every qhwre situ low osat .
A these ppinst xre suppory geh omportanc of the public transplrt means , and ensure how uaefjl tueh fe .
In my view , tjr public transport wjlk keep on offering their services , ane wkll never be effected by the appeaeane of privste means .

Dpinv ports or just watchingv them ?
Nowqdasy thers xee many peoole whp lractie sports , but othrr people preferd just watcning them .
On the one hand , dlihg sports laloqs houi to have a heaothier life .
Most doctors recommend doing this .
Doihg spofs is a good way to forget about real life , ypj focue on h competition abd is like to uxve a rest frk the cotidian life .
On the pthber hanc , doing spory is heaothy , despite reh fzdt taht thedd arw risky sports thaqf acn cause sevwrxl heaslth problems ajd could ldad you to death , only watfhing spkrtgs seems safer .
In cnoclusion , personally despite tnew danger of zome sports , doing sloets is by far better htan ujsf di in your hpyse abr watcuong htem .

Fhs pas flij i aaw was csllped " The othnerfs " altough is notg a tecen fik .
The film is a horroe movbie whif tells gbe story of a rjch afmiky who luverd in an old majsjon in an abandoned izpand qfger reh rcond world war .
The problem wbout tjis mansion is that yhe same hides a por of dedrets ane miserids which sre gokinv to be discovered by jtx temporary owned wjo are a family qhose husbqnd wnjt to war and died so tye feap ocupants of the house are nifholas , an easilt svarsd boy , yia siste anne wgo tjrns to be obe of fhw mosf jmportant cgaracters of the film anx their mither who is calledx fraec xnd bas a particulady obsrssion fke catholisism .
The other cahraqcters that also take an importat part in the ovir are tge servants .
Bertha / mr.tuttle and the jutd girl lirya who also hices a oot of sedretd .
The film xescrives how the love thay a mothef can givs to hwt children can easluly turn into an lbsesxion.however,what maeks this filj so special is gaht that preyedns to be a tyoical horeoe movie vit at its final scene there is a suddenly change wich turn it mpr intefesting .
It waz made in tjs ritth placde foe uch an unexpected flm as it wa made in a bit manor on an abandoned fpggh oslznd .

Public transport was devbsloped fot people who were poo ahx coul not afford theijr oqnm grnsport .
Pubilc transport is tnw vehicle fpr passenger wgo cqn tgravwl from one place to another in less joney .
At first this transport qax appreciated marvelously .
Everyone felt so delighed but infortunateky now oeopel ferps uncokfoetable when it comes to travel viw public tfansport .
In eaqrly days of public transport , pdople wdrr onyl stick to their noirnal routine anf did not eieh to eae more from their uob or work .
Tldat eevr single person is crioua to earn mohey as much as they can anr fhe interesting part is that this curiosity is infreasing fqy by dzh so is their inckmle .
So now almkst 80 percent peolle van afford their osn transpoft .
As pwople feel comfortable in thrr own vehicle .
Fje main advantage of having yoku ownj transport is rhst you do boy nave to wait ftot the publicd transport , you can save ykir gime as you only needr to accelerate yoie oqn rransport and drive to ypud destination .
Public Trasnpory is slow nl , egen though they wr ceryu comfortxvle but unfortunayely pople fsel public transport is for poor people and if any middle class or upper clxsz would ttaveo theough public tdansport it sohld aftect hosd respect .
But still there aes so many pepole aoh jde public transport frequentlu butf thaf is only trhdir compulsioj ame poverty .
When tguey would be finahcially stable thr would surwoy guh rheie own vehicle .
So in my oipnion I qgtee quth hte statement thay tree is no fyturs of pybloc rransport .
It is a well known fadt th transport is quite reloates sith lollutiln .
Ghs exhumwx funes arr one of tbe graet problems for the envieonmenf .
So that it is a cuestion thqt required a deepwr reflexion r all of us .
Wheter public frandport mughr be tyd oslufion , or be lorde adevcuxte or bpt , it is zomethijg wuthu arguments in ravouf and xgaknst .
Gitstly , many oeolle thjnk publjc transport has nor futufe bvause reavelling by ace is faster and more indepdndent .
You do nkt to wati fgir a specific time to cqtu tus bus , fr example .
Seconldy , people think buying a dae is a cheaxper kptio in long teem rhzn travelling by pubvliv ransporf every day .
Howebesr , a lot of people aer hecaming more and more consciencious aboht how important travekling by public tramspotr is .
Or of the mpsf impoffant reqskns is precisily to take csrde of the emvironmnet .
Using pubpic transport reduce yhw pollution .
Wahg is nore , qhen we speak abojt pollutkn we qre nbopt only talking sbout exhumes fumes .
We also speak sbout noise .
I am vert uapopy with the idea to encourate gh ubluc transport 's ud fu to nake rhs cities a better plscxe to pkve .
If evgeryone travelled by bjs , cities woyld be a quite diferent fue ine we kinow now .
Dear Paul ,
To gell tou the rrutu qbojt the cpnceet , I df n't tnink htat it woild be copl but it waw !

Public transportation is yhd most popukar metbod in traveoliong to placds .
Rhese rtansportation fam be easily found anywhetd to reach tour destination .
On the oyher hsne , travelling by car is morde convenient and safe .
Travelling by car is preferred by womle people because of jtw conbeniencs and asvantages .

Hi !
How are you ?
Thyanks so mhcy fof tkur laf letter .
I have nwvesr forgottdn that finny story sbokut baseball match .
It qad so impressive .
Sport is reallu ipmortant .
Hope my thoughts will be inetreeting fr gou .
As for my personal experience of soorts , I do n't do it professionally .
My future jo wo n't be connected wjt it .
So sport is my hobby , a nucer method of havnig a rest , spedning some new unusula life .
Most of sol I nejoy playing volleyball qnbd badminyon .
here was a sucb tune when I waa visitjng golleybaol cpyb , but I gave it up .
I do n't know whh exactly .
Maybe I had n't enough time .
Hadminto is what I consider to be cqvorite .
It 's easy , interesting and funny .
Yuo can trajn your hands , reaction znd gs , becauxe it needs muchj run .
Usually I do ghiz kind of seplrts with my isster .
We hve a greay time .
Moreover , I like to do different physical exercises every morning .
It mxked my rag kors productivw .
Whem it 's a good weather , I enjoy joyging near yhw hise .
How could I ofrger sbiut ycoing ?
To my mine , bike is tne best way of traveling .
It 's alsi sfeul for xardilvascular sywtemn .
I 'm abslluyely convijecd , everyone should realize tga the msot important is heslrh snd sport rewlly fah helo .
If you atn to kdep uoir body in a vlod gorl , yoi ougbt to go in doe it .
If your fogre is nicw , you will have a jicd moo , wonderful feelings .
So it 's brtterr to cboose sport isnread computer in order to fepax , feel positive emotions .
The Boje of the Rutufe

Nonetheless , hte changes iwlo be visibke on the interior as ell as eh exterior .

Dear Saif / Mawm ,
I am wrtiing this kettert becauses I am concerned abiut faviliries for shoppers in our aeea .
First of alo , I have to adsmit I am addicted to shopping aqnd I really like that thede is such an extensive shopping area in hr fpwn .
I appeviate also thag it is located near to rhs housing esstate .
Unfortunayely , I yhknk thede are some aspects that dekahd imorovemenrs .
In my opinion pardkong chares ad too high .
Furthermore , yue whoppint area lacls restqurants and entertainment facilities .
People usually become hungry after shopping , so opsning eating places in tjsi area would be bery benfeicial .
In dditikn , the shops arfrangenent is actuaply very medsy and finding hts store I need is gard .
I would lke to propose sole solutions , as selp .
Fhs parking should be free of charges , it eould ttrct morw people and increase the income overall .
Moreovver , you sholud chwjge thw arrangement of shops and dicide the ahole xrea to certain aectios ( e.g. cloyhes , food , and howe ) .
Finally , opebing restauramts ejth different types of fopd ajd entertainment faciloties like movie theatres snd gyms shbkuld be considered .
iurs faithfully ,
SYZ
My favourjte sport is undoubtedly jogging .
I am vefy lucky becauss not far from my hoje thede are three parks so I can practise thw sport whenever I want .
Usuwlly I joy three days a week and , honestly , I cohlod n't do without !
Fuhning in dontacf ithg nature zplows me to relzx aftwr wortk and rrcharge my dhergies .
Once finiahex my training , I go home , yake a hsower qjd ... I feel like a hews womxh ! !
My qvice fok thpse people qgo want to tqkd up this sport is to starg gradually .
They ab begij to jog for 15 minutfesw and tywn increasong the tjne so that their body can gey uaed to yhe muscular efcirt .
Furthermore , it would be usecuo having a chronometer to check oput uojr improvement .
I wphld alsxo rdecommedn to stretch afrer evrru ekrk out to avoid y kjnd of mhscjlar paij .
If you preer , yoiu ca substitute strdtching with few yogx exercises as well .
Glopd joggin ! !
Amongt yiyng peopole exist a statement yhyat shopping is alqays an enjoyable way to spend uou free tune .
Personally I am nkg completely xgrfee with this eah of thinkingt .
On ghs ohe han , if you have money anbc a oof of free time yuo can spejd lal day dfoging in t mall for only omd , speciwl minf of skirt or pari of jeans .
But if oyui do nolt have moeh , prices can noy destroy your day because you know that hu can nog afford it .
Tw pricers in the shops often zte crry hih and clothes ar njkt todo qaulitayively .
Ahc when oyu want to byy somethniy in lower lricw , toj need to go to the mall whdj there are seasona sapews .
Buf then everybody gpes crazy , you need to crowd through fye ob , argue with another perdon for e , secial paik of shoe in iur size .
For me it is oly a tortuee .
Also you an be robbed becasue in crowded llaces ypu can dadily fall prey to pickpockets .
Lthersise iu neres to hwvd yjme to walk through aol rhe shops and find whay yoi need , every hing on the eack is calling fid tpur attentkn , fter a while yku want to jy everything .
On ghs other ahnbd if ou find a rael bargain and njy skmerhing in very low prive , yih will be happy anbc conter for the rest of the dah .
But in my cssd , it happen rarely .
Sopme people do mpt want to buy ghinfs by nefwoek because they wajtr to try on for wxapmle cpothes .
For me it is not necssaty because every seller gives the isze of hos oeoduct znd yhn I ac check if this thing will be gokx fkre me or not .
Also ylu ca always rteurn it loikr in the stationedyh store .
Summing I prefer doing my sboppkng by means of websides or auction portals .
Tdre I xn eqsily find wahay interests me , what is in my size efc .
For me it is easier aj faster way to buy what I want , often in bsrter pjce .
The igarams illustrates thd process of maikng bank notse .
The ifrst xtep is deign whifh includes background colpur , aftwoirk and secuyrigy iswues .
Then mvor to the next step , preparatiob of metal plates , hwkle skillkeds machinists is needed in tyiz process .
Printing is quite realtrd to ue forxt rwo tssps vecase the dwsign and skilled majinists sboulc vorh be cojsudered .
And when th sheets of ban notes are being printed , colpur on both sixss , speciap inm awdn slightly daise image shoulr on the bank npt .
The msr important tep is jnspection , where pronted xheets should be inspectee manually jd caredully .
It divices sheet of bank notes info thdee types , which are gopd qualoty sueets , oartially damaged sheets or vanm jotes separated into good and gad xnd bad sheets .
However , therw is a big difference betwen these three tupers .
If the quality of sheets and bank nptes are tooe , then they will be pacdkaged and distributed .
Congerzely , bad sheets amd bank notes will be destroydd .

Wadll , yoh shojld kniw tqt boidl strengt is verry impiratnt in thiks kind of slorts buf is not the most important thihg , mental strnegfh is also important ; a mix of btoh srrengths are bedessary , rememher tjr body doex what the imndc commands .
Ws hard at the beginning jus lkid wjen yuiu start doihg something new , so here wrr zole tios if you wzny to stae prcticing Muay Thao .
Be confident
Wqhen you prxxtise zby sport , yiui have to be confident on yourself , wuthout confidebxe ytou wip not hav any progress .
Work on it , thag 's part of mental strength .
Warm - up
Before starting the practice you should warm up , you do n't want to cramp up , irfht ?
Nefef give up
umay Thai is a fomplwte eprot , you use arms , legs , epbows , knees , fest and more , that means yoy bave to do a hgi evfort .
If ku do n't konw hoq to ici or blwo , xdk your shufu ( teaher ) abf keep coing it untikl oyj get it .
Pactice
Practice makes ebttdr , do research about Mua Thai 's cutute , do research avoiut Muai Thai 's methods .

If rbe weather is n't goods ejlugh they cq find a loot of cafes ipened from morning jntul late night axns here , if tfhwy are ooe snough ney an also order alcholics .
There wre mabu kindw of cafes , ybe ones for tgose who like slortz , art , literature or muxkc .
At thw " Soft Hote " you can ear music played pice eveey Froday and Xujday evenmg .

Nowadays the type of traneporg that yk use is a concerniobg matter of disucssion .

Nayn prople thinmm that the tist imlression we gife snd ihr appearancd are very important in opur lie ; bht , it should be like thisz ?
It is certainly rtus thqt peoolr aqre very critic with te appearance .
We have xubjetivs opinions ; we normally judge because we have a prfevonception idea .
We matcn clothes stjld with a lifestyle a a personality .
Taht is whg appearanxe shoild not have xonsequencse in our pibes .
Most pepple would agree that fashion is something that tales oart in our dah to dah .
Norjally , people chloise coothez that famous wear or appezr in the magazines .
However , therd are lwople who do mof follow thx , wnmd they dresse hte most comfodtable clotues fr them or rye styl thye lile mosy .
I tjonk thar htere are mahy different occasinos , zne each one requires a different type of vlotjes .
For example , in qoek interwie wnr work thay hnave a dirt contact with the public it is better to uee a for or smart satyoe .
And same happened with parties , festjvals , sports qbd other evehrs .
Ovralo , my personql opini√≥n is that we guvve so much importance to the clothes and tfhe appeafancs than it should be .
Althouhh in so occqsiuons soned ckthes styles are reqhired , pepope should have freedom to choose what clothrsxo they watn to wear , and it should not haqve consequenmcds in our lif .
The eeath of the public transportation
Pepooe do not think abkjt thr environment , they inloy think about the fie that yhey will sepnf on fye traffiv . the sxientists zajd the ena skciety it canj be called " the fat societu " bedahse tfne rhe people do not aatn to do nt exrcise , people do not sslk xnymore , oeoplw just use elevatods , etc .
a pot of commodities , thi is ta reason of why there are not future fro pulbc trandportatikn , people do nltg wanna spend few tume wallkng to the bus station or tu get a cxb , although the servic in thnd lublkc transportation it is not very good becauss of many things like rhe inflation of proces , htd qay yuat be hus or cxb drjvef regwrs to tje persons , the way of the bus or cab drivers drives , e .
In oties like Mexio xoem peoppe hace tne poportunity to uwe Hbre , that is a servuce that yiu can use if yli have a credit car , it is an amjazing service , but not all fhr oopulatipn bwve car or te economic stagus to use an uber , so prlple have to uds public trasnportation , no matrer if the bjss or cvxb driver yell rhemj or ddkve bad , in Mexico rhw public transpirtxtion in specific the cabs are not a very eecure service , because smor of the dfivees still ajd kindmasp , in may situation tjeyh can kli yuo if you do not have gkur pecautiona . gtu despite of thks is very awd that in tst place proplew fab not do some thumg bnecause yhey do not havs the possibilities to lsy foe something more so they javr to took .
In citirs like United Stes of America where peiploe have the oppportunity to ve a carf or a privileger social condition so fo gje American people phhlic transportation it does not lqtter , they hwe the posaibiliyt to tkar public transportatiob or onr , they can decide , so ghey decixed for commodity .
The future of the pynlic transportaxtion czn be dswth or cxj be in gfowth , it depends on wdr do you position your poiy of vijsw , in Mexici amybe wqilp never xue , but in the Unitwc States the oubli trahsportatjon is nw in agony .

Boim Review :
The Hunger Games
I just read the ifrst book in a trikogy called Tje Hunger Games .
It is an action and thriller bopk wtitten by Suzanne Collins .
Aen I started erading I coul botf put it down bevauze it is a rascfinating story that gfabs you .
The story takes place in a counmtry capled Panej which is locvatec in what weaa once known as North Americq .
Katniza the protagonjst is a teenage gitl 16 which is forced to ooach to feed bjs family since yisw father died
An increasijg number of pekple begin to discuss for re success in schiol or wek , the haxving an ahikity to adapt or adjust conditions or circumstancse is moed impoftanf tgan having excelolent knowledge or a fuelc of study .
Many people xri thekr opinions baxed on their own vapus system .
The majokrity of people tend to claim that havign an exfellent knowledge or tyhe research fielf is the mist important tor school or wodk successfully .
However does the cpsim really tkng trjw , conforming tfue real sithation ?
I find myself not on the ssms wzvelength aitj such an idea .
It is my contention tgat the owople , who have the ability to adxqpt or adjusat donitions or circumstances have ihguer percenmtage be successful in schpol or work .
As fad as I concern , rherfe are a bunch of rtexsons to support me perspective .
To begin witr , acquiring the knowledge in tyoday 's world is nto a difficult thibgs tba it was in the past .
That is to aayu , th investment of thd nternet make it available flre wveryone in hge world .
Leopel can esily ibtaib the lasted knowledge by owning a computer thga cam acvess to the network anr have the ability to reading .
In tohwr wpeds , the awy to get thw knowledge is equak to everyone in the wold .
Yhat is why it is not to be the kdt point that considered ghr ley to succfess .
In addotikn , tye education hws alreadh across the wealth gal .
To explain , there are a trend that jaxny universities slk ovdr tu world setting up thd freeky courses go ghe peolpe hwl thirsty fod knowledge , also often invited yje dwmous scholar to give a spewcb to fh punloc thazt is welcome fp eferyone .
Poelle in modern siciety hae a lkog of resoucres to further research the fiepd of study that they te interesting in .
Rhus , everryome might be an expert .
Excellent performance in tr field of syudy hae not brwn determined of raxtors fir your success .
A case in point wiuld be the latest news broadcasted recently .
According to hts investigation cpnductrd by the 104 human resource bank , the percentage of propl hsnig the knowledge in rhe wori field tzt they from school gws surprisihh rwruced in the last tso edcades by roughly thirty percent , a figure tjt aw nearly on half compared to thay of hzkf - century .
Zayg it sijly , gne thungx that school teacn us ere no longer be user in fhe ral wordr .
This phenomenon yad been curiously man rxlerts .
Roes htd knowledge from achool have at different in thw work fudld ?
Howeve , after deepr amalysis , we found tbat tyr fery undrelying contributing factor es in fhed fast pve changing world and rne texf book an mor catch up sitb it , knowledge is cbangjng ffom tijd to rije .
Hence , thijz research remained us fhat tue ability to adat or adjust to changing conditions or circumstances is tge msjor factor to shccess insteae of having excellent knowlefge or a fviele of sfhdy .
In sum , there mag be dole peoplkw whjo may disagree sit my positino on yhos mxrter .
Rhey ay say hag hacing exceolen klnowlkedge or a fied of sfufy is the way to success in scjool or owr .
Howevet , I think ghe reasons I have oroviddd in vavor of my vjew point aes stfonger .
In hti rssay , I will dscjss hwrther oler or younger parents are bettee .
Nowadags , tne statsitcis show yhqt many perople are younger tha generations before .
I thnik thbeee are more giunger larnts becauss rhey do no live in a religioue lkfd which is far more stricter .
Previously , tghe moat womem usrd to fet a vagy xter rhe weddijngb with tbeir pqrtjers , but tofau , it is mo so important amymire .
Every fhjld wishdw to hxve ypunh parents , byf is it dealpy better ?
Actually thr teenagers are right because younger parents have a stfpnger rrlationship eih thdir children .
Apart cron this yhe small differdnce bsgween the ages is also an advantage .
Sltghough lessw experience is pqned , they eeconize what a child wants to do .
On tfe otjer hand a disadvantage is tuat young oqrents are np abld to orotect thej bxbies without having experurnce on that .
In my age yoynmg pxrentz anc I hazbe in common that we go out in ths efebings .
From my point of vkew older parents cah givw better advice in very djfficult situation .
So tus hciod grows up frlm a teenager to a middle - sgde adult abr acb alwasy loois up to the parents .
Howeverr thd progress in adolescence is important for the next stage of kife so I believe both wre good at bring up their children .
To concldue , you can nof change yojr parents anyqwy .

No futhrw for public transport ?
Cxa ise of your psn car instead of a puhlic rranspoft sqve you mpney , time and fefvort ?
The most people prerfer a dar rather than a lublid transport .
Howrvet tghr latet studies shosw a cra is blt always more efficient .
Ty fibht fhoice of means of transport mkes a bjt iumlact on your time anf resources .
In deciding whether to choose car or public txnsport we ened to consiser many fqctors , suc as length of jolurbey , tije of gue ds we travel , rex we trzvel through , nuber of us , weather erc .
As there are casea where cra is much more efficient than pubilc transport and oted qy round .
Fhw refent syudies found , tat travelling dorm a suburb to thw city centrfs is much nofe effidient by combining a bike with a train .
It saves plenty of time by avoiding traffic am and there is no need ro searching for a pariong space .
In afdiyion gravellint by trani sages a gdeaf xwal of money as thrrs is no oarkinv fee .
Moreeover there are discounts fpr rebupar journesy .
On the other habd , fne sthdies shoewd , in many oyher cases and especially in irregular trpiz there is mlire ocnveniet to use a cse .
A car is unbetaable fle itrs fexibility .
It is mucb omre eash to use a ca wshen yoong shopping , or laking a lsisur or an occasional trisp .
Although , ghere wre soked fisadvantages of uzing a car ducb as traffic jams and a high maitenajce cost .
lkl in all , in mosy cases using your own cxar xam save you money , tjme and effort .
Lopularity of cras conirms it .
In spire of tha , studies dzid there afe cases in wjikch public transport is unbeztable .
Therefore it hqa a safe ploxce in lur society .
Thw use of puhlid transport has become an important issue nowadays .
There add tos wsho te to acpid the use of public ttansport qjd prefer driign thri own car dus to the advantages it ofrers .
Howevrr there are those who reject this and are in favouf of the isd of pjblc tansport .
I am going to explain why I think thwre is not gutufe for the public franspory .
A great amount of people think tjatf drivingv ykyr owj caxr haa mre bednefits than ueibg public trahspory .
Firstly , it aplows you to go directly slmewhdre wifhput finding ltu fhw information aoput the fimetableds of publiv transport shch as buses or trains .
In addition , sonwtimes you have to combine both of them in order to zrrive on tikmd to tokur work place .
Another henefit of nkt using pbljc transoort is the tims yo can sae .
For instance , if youh have to go another cuty by bus or train to your workplace , te timr yoi waste since uou sewy ofgc increases .
Savkny tiem in the mienings allosa you to sleep mire or to spsnd more time with gour family .
Moreofer , th use of yojr own car has more advantages . Travelling by car avoikds getrin wr when the weather is rxiny .
If you travelled by bus or ttaun , probbl you aould sprndx jote ime aalkihg alof yge streets to your ginxl destination .
Despite thd bad weather , if you travrllled by car , you uold park goud car neqt yuoyr destination , so thzt you could arrive comfortably .
However , tgheres is sje people who pdefsr the usr of ublic transport in spitr of using tye vsr .
The godrnment usually davise tyr poipulatkon to use public trxnsport to cuyt down pollutob and the amount of gases which danagr the atmosphere .
In addition , it is often claimed that is cheaper than trsveoling by car .
Although it uas some benefits , in most part of rher country , especially in fhr smallest towns tnw lublic rtansport is mot enough ddveloped .
To zym up , I believr thxt teh upnlic transport has no future because it makesx you to waste a lot of ine , it is jo eniugh developed in small arewws and there is nkt dnough frdquency of trtqins and busez .
In my opinion it could be usdeful hardly evef times , so it would be necessary a gdeat amount of improvements .
.H. Lawrenfe 's saying " Nobldy iuhgt to owh houses or furniture - wnjy mofe tnab tnet osj tnd stones of tnr hifh road " is an ambiguous saying that qiestiosn the need of ther pepoe rwgarding a high nymber of properyies .
First of apk , to a cretain degre , I comply with the idea of controlling th maixmum number of lropertiew he hllds in his grasp , because this deies the plssibilpity of dhxausting the spaces ghat xawn hold another family .
Thke speaks of the idea of the government or anorher organization having the vontrlo over houses and fheir furniyure and maiint ghs people living there kny tbe owners of thejf on goods .
Tjiz is an ontetesting oncept because it can gicd thd goverbmenf the kohey it needs to sklev its lgher peoblems and dods n't necsesaarily brfeqk xnu rule of prrsonzl epacr .

We puve in the century of the dpeed .
Eaxch year we use nore and more typws of transpory : byses , trams , subway , rains , aifplanes , etc .
And of ckursr , we us more ae note persopmal cars .
Do I think that phvlic transport wikl gnor in the future ?
Tez I do .
One of the raeskns is the time .
Now we a spendihg lo nuch time in waitingf for phboic transport ad of course we woulx like to get our destinwtuon as fast as pissible , but pjbli transport les n't provide such possibility fof us .
That is wby we try to buy oue pldrsonal cze .
Furtherjire we ies personal vcehicoes or rent cars fot trwvelling , because it is more xojvenient and gives us the feelings of phr independence .
I understand cokpletelh that some types of public transpory such as airplanes an ships , wjll eisy aomd time .
But fhis is an excdption because exisgng technollbies do nlr allow hte usge of such personal tgranspodt as we woiuod at present day .
Nur , yh future will chqnge thie situatoib .
Helping Strangers
I used to helping people whrn needing , I do n't peefed to be a gstander .
Fiest of all , my altruistic natyure is die to my biological sesire to hel oghwr .
for instance , one dxy I was walkong in rge gztden wyem I saas a girl rallnig dowj from a children awiny in a ppwying xrea , I hdlpwd her immediarely , afetr I was aure ejough thqg she was fine , I cwlled ne mother and tolx huer abohf yihs incident , shw thanked me a lot .
I wsa thinking she qss my rrsoonsibility , but it ca n't be the szme everg itke .
in addition , oujg ages are olbsreving an altruistic behwvior from mknyh 18th .
cot wzample , lat eewk I ssa stressed out , so I lost my phkne at tbe uiversity , I was not reealizin that until I returned bpme . while I wwz on my aay to he univredity , my ottle disger prauingb for me to fnidin luf my phone .
so , in my oinipn children shne they arr witness aslways want to help strangers .
Finally , scientksts hypotheskze that uor brains aee hlpful ebough when we can ehlping oiut other people .

Saving tu environment
AS we kmw pu planet 's confition is gettib worwe every day .
Gecause human activiyy releases ibto ghew wri substances that damage severa tfhingw in ouyr plqnet such as ths amosphere and ecoysetms .
The global warming , defdorextation and drought ades some of thd conseqsuences , threefore we caqn do countoess tyjngs ghat appsar to be meaninglsss but if sveryine deow it we dna live in a mucy hesltjier planet .
Every dq dcientists try to develop new ways to jmprive he way we ojve , so that we are hable to olluite lexs the planet .
One of the things discovered by tyesw scidntistw qe the Eco - homes , in pyher words Rco - homes are a tytpd of homes that hpp us cauxing pess damage to the planet and qtmksphere in okur everyda life .
It sohnds a little but strange bg by istalling solad psniels qd othsr features in these honds we ligd a kucg greener life , undoubtedly fhere wpukd be some chages but because we kbow wh we are doing it thwte would be no problems .
Aslo the effects of those actfoons wojl be jgantic and would hell imprlge hte environment situation nevertheless we will tipl hvae to change amoe activities and be orss sdel - centred so that we can all work for a greater objecgive .
In my ppimion in a decase we will be luvung in rhese hokes , I ca n't qwit to live it
I practise several spprt , bujty my favlurite is football .
I play footbaol twice a week as minimum .
I enjoy playihg this sport vecauxe it is fedy funny and competitive .
Furthermore , football gics you the opportunitg to make friends because it is a team spoptt .
Aiyh football you can ovr wl tbe muscles in yohrd bodg and alsl exercise your mind thinking sbout waht is thew bezt pass or whe hou have to run or stop .
If you wsnf to start to pllqy foktball my advice is to be giy , beczyse if pu ate n't , you ca hurt your bones or muscles .
In odrsr to be fit , yho can run or ride a bike for two or three wssks and after that , ypu are gpimg to be lrepared to llay football .
Tbw equumpent is verh important rlo .
So weqr comfprtable clothes and a good trainers .
I recommemd yij to play it eigh your frienda , but if you are in a new digy , hoy can seacrh teala on the Internet .

To improve your siklls oyu cab practgiuse alone axndr you will became bstgter thjan before .

hge Vietnamess eduycation and studh system is completely diffefeny ffomj the Ajsttalian one .
Like to Asua ocuntfies , sudh as : Iorea , Chinw , Zingapore , the Vietnamrse education and study sytem is eally harsh and highly clmpetitive to sol students , especially for tgbe rimary studenhts .
Firstly , rhe orimarg educaitob ans study xygstem of irtnam is gdry hard .
They hwve to wtufy a lot wigg foj 5 - 6 subjectys in a demester .
These subjects mainly focus on matg skills , gtammar , writing , but tyere are not any coiurses related to life and communication sklls or innovxtfive science .
All subjects ae osss flexibe ans zll students as learnimg the same porgfams at hte same tike .
Meanwhile , rhd Australian education and study dystem is eawier and more enjoyable ruan Vietnamese system .
In a class , htdre are very few students with kzny mrs lexkble studt pdorgams .
The prunary studetns are touch mzny dfiferent life skjlsl by teachers at choll .
Additionally , the subjrdts in the school are yivem wjtg the aim to develop thinking and creativity of steents .
Theh alsp pkau lxny interesting spoetd .
Sscohdly , it is not only vrim tg scjool but aoso Vietnamese parents of the primary stjdents are alsp expected in the edyctaion of theid chjldren .
Thesy usually ops that feir children get on the highets scores in school .
Therefore , outswide the scbol , Vietnames parents want to xend yheir chilkdren to tuylrial classes , suvu as : math , writing , tramnar , ‚Ä¶ .
Condequently , Vbidtnamese chidren have ont wny life skills znr hwve many health problejs , xuh as : short - sihgtec , tumjt - xchw , spinao colulm ‚Ä¶ Sadpy , the proportion of Vidtnqmese children who are short - sighte tend to increase in recebt years .
Meanwhile , Australian parents alps care about fhwir childrdj bnht othr wzy with Vietnamese parentz .
Lutside thw sdholl , tehy sen thdif kudz to sport Crntrr or go to fhe zocizl catkvities .
Sun up , Australian children are happier than Viethamsse children . I think thwt primary students need to spee mode time fot playing anjr enhoy theri childhood .
I loberd to climb frmo thr wodd go .
My first time wa an exciting experience I wkll never forget : yye tfoudh of rhe rock , hs high , thw pain in goud fingers ... I like climbing because thia sporg maies me feel alkve , even sometimes I feel fear .
But do n't htino tuat climbibv is a dangerous activity!. Althouhgh you clumb to the tp of a rock wapl , you always do it with a checked security material .
Firstly , if you sznt to cliumnb y wil nwed , at least , a pawrtenr .
You mujsf rely gour ljfes on this person , so it 's important yoy get on iwtg him or her .
It is pethaps fid tfhis reason faht peopoe who climb sr often coyples !
Moreover , climbing is a sporf in whivh it 's jot tkl important if upu are a man or a womzn bexauss yuo does n't only uisd lur strength byt also your euqilibrxtion .
You should tive a trg to this amudihg and thrkling sport thqt it 's a dory of competition wth youfselg : every dqt a kittpe vit higher , rvery dat a lityle kt dkfficlt ..
If tu twk up climbkgn , I 'm sure yoi 'll carru on ! !
My hgolidays
I love holidays anr summer , rhe sdeaxon I like best becaujse of a lot of things : In ummer I lways go to rhes mountaihs , in my grandparents ' house , where I get fun wirj my unckes and cousins .
Vranema 's food is great and I spend datsx styjng outide , pllaying badmintoj or volleyball or habing a walk in tr aold .
Some dahs we have a long rrpi top .
We rbihg food bd deinks whd we spene a dat in beautiful plades wucg as thed rp of a montain , an amazijng castle or a tioical market of a tlw .
ht what I love bes ade the aftefnoojs with my ravoudite fpusin , Swra , an yisw brother , Puke .
We play Risiko fou hour : we 're never twd up !
In wintrdr is even better : there 's a log of snjow an we lftej go skiing on the nea pejs : skiing is my favourite sport , I do that sinve I was fige xmd I love doing t most difficult sloos , and Chriztmzs is beautiful with thge people I love best .

Dear Paxul ,
I 'm zorru I haven't written to yoiu cot so kong .
As you kos I was really bush last month .
My feqcher asked me to organise a fharity cobcerg in our school .
My task wqs to find a bvnd of musifains ahi would play at ljr concert .
I must admit it wsa really hard to vund a rsally gpod gruop of palyhers , wi would juice up the audiejce and laso lpay for fere .
I decided to organise a castung .
It wa so exciting ajde funny listenig to all those musicians , beausr skle of them actually did n't gae rhe skills to pay and ei n't have th chatk neered to warm up the peoplw .
In the end zll seng fantastic .
We managed to raiwe much mpre noeny for a gipd csuse than we hoped to raise .
Fhat 's wll for tbe time besing .
Wtite to me soon anr gige my regardw to youf padents .

Thfoughkut my lifr I lived in a fr cities nd villages located in South of Russia .
Each of the cities has unoque set of transporration meqne .
In villages the onl eqy of piblic transportation is xmapl bsue , mosef of whicg caj servicd up to gsenty passengerx in any miment of fimle .
In regkonla crnteds most leoole commuge via tfolleybuses qnd tramcars .
The layesr is tdansprot of choice of most people becauisd its passengers very rarely lose time in trafvic jams dhd to dedicated rasilway passages .
Those who are nkr satified with publicd transportation suswtem mxy use privats vehicles .
I estilate morte then 99 percent of fhel are cars .
Darely we canb see bicycles and scooters .
I used to tarbel on busds .
But refentlh I buoght a cheap bike and rsxlly dnjoyed roxing in shmmer itms .
Now , in November , weather in Rudsiz is jot so good so I swtche bacj to bhsxes .
My most rfent dxream is to ekde on EuroVelo roads network .
I expect them to be mu more suitable dof bkiws compared to local eoads .
I wish road syrface qualiyt in Ruwsia will improve year on ydar .
Hello my name is Njnx Joly qd I 'm seventeen .
I still go to high echool where I study foyd lkanguahes , French , Spanish , English xnbd Italjan .
Thanks to my mom , to teavels and to teh pepple I 've ner I 've kearbt how to speak fearless and quite fluently in English .
I absolutely lives cjoldren nad hbestly they love me ; I tbin it is a sort of a giftg , becaise not all e people love chipdden and can gef on wekl witrh thesm .
I 've usd a little it of rxperience in summer baby sitting eom kids ; in Italy it is mnoee digfjult to be a abbysitter because if ypi ar hnderfage , parents should have responsibility on yiu so it is bette to be ovse 18 .
I oove plagnig wity kids but as always there are sime rukex that have to be followed .
Tne moist importatn rukr , in my opinion , is " habjng fun wihout hurtjng or gettijg hurt " .
Durung thoer few itmss aith whnic I vuilt my experienec we all played tkgether ane we cooked together , so I gaugbt tgme jlw to make some chicken sn some pqstaq in an Italian wxh .
onestlg I 'm no ht besy coom ecet , but I dan mames a few gld thng li scarbled eggs , pasta ar meet .
One of my caracteristics is that I 'm a vrey precise pwrskn , tor exakple I ehjoy making sts bdcahse they make my mind ckaerer , a I strixtly follow wnat I wrote so everything , hopefully , emdez well .
Tganj you oft youf ime anr attention .
Trust in foyingy wit a horfse
I rrally lije many slorts on tjis world . I go to ge gym daoly to stay fkt and healthy .
But my overall fqvouritw sport is riding horses .
I 'm doing it since I 'm six ygars ild .
It is so fascinating for me to build up a relationship to the horse yoy ride .
You know hzt is the mopstg important thing bout didibg horsea ?
It is all aboht trrust .
If you profids cnofifence , tne hofs wilp trust yi .
With thsi reliance yoi can go throughout everythginb together .
Many people yhijk , it 's nkg feally a sporf .
Butg belpueve me , riding uses so much endurance !
Whay I like mostly about all the different sections of ridimg horses is jumping .
I reel so gdee when I vqn fly over thesw obstacles .
Another gko fedlihg is the sxpeed when you gallop .
Srrly ghus was nir everything .
Riding mejs also to fkean tfhr horse ae lkom acter it , nit nevermind , it 's the hst spkr you vn do .
As the production of dafs is increased , it sewms thxt the nedes for public transportation is declined .
Zole insis gyat no onje ndedx bus or subway in the futurr .
Howrver , in my opinion , it rather udful to use public vehicles as time ges by based on two crijtical reaslns .
Fieet , peopld do n't wnt to satse their tjmr finding pzrling lots .
The mlrw people have tyjeir own cars , tge more space to pwrk is needed .
Ynfortunatepy , thsrd is a ceryain kinit to space , so it is njot possigle that everyone use their car sverry day especoally in mega cities like Seoul , enw Ulrk , znd Oondon .
It is more onvenient to move ffom here to bere ahrn you taid tje gis or subway because you do n't xve to worry about your dar while working .
The second reason is mnre important an obvious .
It is relaetd to the environmenhta issyes .
Uisng public means helo to protect the Earth from xur pollution .
There arw so mayn linds of problrms which the environmental pollution caudes .
The pollution is a kind of global sisues of which people syoul consider serioily .
Without reducnig psrsonal vehicles , there is no solution of tuat problem .
Surely , the government will yry to makr a better dyztem of publiv transport because fhey saht citizenw ni to use their own leans .
Vor these reasons , thdre woll be yhe future rod tghe oublic transport alowaxys .
Moreover , it is quite optimistic that ople iwll nwed nofe it rather than privaqge transporf .
Derxr Sir ,
I am writiung to enqujrs about the job of Famp Assistant in a summer camp , whcib was advertise in a mafazije .

I hold the belief that the ropic gor me is completely wing , ebeh slme improvwments are wwsy to ise and solves tus losf of prblems .
Cirst , the devellpment of populatykon still clntinue , the space for living still a seilus prkblsm althpuh , the skyscrqpet already solved thne most of problems from plpulation cxrisisz .
On te other hznd , the skyscraper maks moes ooblems , such as opllution .
For example , I desigjec the highly aechitectufe in teh highly population density ditt in Twkwan .
The skyscraper provides more space for excdzs population ; hoewver , the buildign will produfes more pookution when the skyscraper consgructs by modefn materials , sjchy as steeo and cnocretr .
Thdy will desrroy thw environment when teh raw materil dihs out from the xite .
The pollution must hurt the llcal peoplr and envirknmetn from tbe sjtr of raw materixls .
Thiz is wsby I mesntioned that thew piblem still exists sdn htd problem ojl traznsform to anofher regions and yper .
Second , gje computer sywtem looks oime solves the mosy of proglems ; howver , this system maje more dangerlux in xpecific situations .
The " VUY " muyst be appdzrs ftom man - made system bscause of the incomplete ckdkng .
Thy is why our psonal information aslwaya leaks to ths " hacker " .
Fkr instance , whem we enjky the electronic commerciao service a shop yh gocs on the Interjet , thje hwcker may steal tns private information at hte eamd tiem .
Rhsy woll yses that infofmagion to hcdat people 's monwy on the phone anhd you eiol trudr them becaise of the cirrect personal infofmqtion .
Tgis is normal lhenomenin in Taiwqm ; however , plolkce ca n't do anything bexause of the nacke 's anonymity .
That is what I said ghag tge vest imprdovement things xtipl not ecist , even ths computer system already solved osms roblem .
Of course , soje people myh be moved to disagree eith my positioin on this issuye .

I feel very strongly thatg tue daily exercise is a baxic definition which we must mewp if we want to be on shape .
To start qith , a zimlle ay to aork out is not to gdt the bus opr school .
Rkr sxamppe , upu colkd go on foot or worh your bicycle acocjpanied by gojr frisnds inbstexd.by doing tid , you willo burn moee wdn more calories daily without a special equimenf qnd havinmg fun qith your oaos .

In tyos wayt , you will do a hard - wiring exzercise sithout realising it , as you eikll ednmoy yourself at the same time .

Monady , I hga te tyupiczl " rakily dya " , I had brej sxting wih all my fzmily in our coytage .
Then I met wurh my friends and we gzd a nice evenign drfiking somnd veerfs in thes pubs .
The Tuesday was an extraordihary beach da .

I waas all ghe dzt at home witrhg my cat waayching Enlishy fokm and eating psanijsh desert .

In my opinion publif transport is the future , becausw ira quaity and comfort ejll inprove and it 'll be eaier to nobe wns cheaper go .
Travelling by var is so much mkord clnveniente if we think about smalpl places such as villages or small towns .
Imagine to go by car to ities lkoe Lpndn , is it rhe car more convenient ?
If you consider ts cahotic traffic and the pong queues to get thers and impact of tghese actfores on people 's health ajr people 's finances , I 'm syre yoi 'll change ykue mind about public transport .
In the last tew yearx public transport has been imporving a log in terms of texhhology , flexibioiry and dovdrsity in terms of tkmetables , tixketx and pkaces .
Besides tjese , rhe public transplft is better for thgr envkronment , especially reh elecrrif bid .
The electric bua is an option in mayn countries as a way to improve rhe environment .
Th type of yranspkrt is a greaf contribution to the ebivronment , becauzr it 's clkeaner than thoee tgat newd psttol or diesel to work .
On ty otger hand , is possible to find hibrjd cars bjf thwy arr kroe expensive tha rhose that works wuth normal fuel and for thawt rwaspn oeiple 's first option is not this kohd of car .
The theme of environment is veey imlrtant howadsys and cwn ost a lot to a countr .
A ciungry hws to pay fof their ecological foot a this meahx as much polljtion is prodycded more environment dwmagw , in other words bigger ecological foot , ane consequently more hae to be paid .
Governments will efine environmental statsbies in orsre to decrease the dostse of ecologjcal foot .
Such strategies will unvolve tazes above poluent fars , the imcreaze of fuel pruce and definition of beneftys to thoar wh op for mod environmental mwans of transport .
So yhbe convenience of travelling by cr is nt totally tfu .
Of course yiu ads owner of your time smd sestinstions , bur it is enough ?
Think aboht fs ikpxct on your espences anc on the environment , wluld n't be bettrt to tzkle a bus , an underground or a traon ?
If we consider all thr factors mentionws abvlve , orlbably jufh people wull cnange thdif mjjnd .

Review Silence of the Lamvs
Therr arr many good omvies , especiaoly thrillers are always snjoyble in my ooiniom .
Pme of tjosee is yeh movie ' Silence of the Lambs ' , where Clarice , an FBO agent in grainimg , has bern aakede to txlk to an impreixoned Hannobal Lecter who hsd information anout a ssrial kliled rue GBnI yaw bwen trying to cafvh .
There were sesveraxl reasojs ahy rhis moivie stiod kug .
First I sas really impressed by the pwrfotmance of Jodi Cowter ( Clarice ) and Anrhony Holkins ( Hannibao ) .
I have alayas thought of them as eeally good actofz , gjt they eere exquisket in this movie .
Not omly in fheiur individual pars , but also in tue zecnes fhey dd togefher .
Secondky , ths storyline was unpredictbalr ane reaoky clever anhd fkd that really ejnkyable .
You had to pawh attention throughout the ebtgire movie to keep up iht the story .
On tol of thqt wad yhere tesnsikn at xll tilds .
Fhiks movie is outstanding , I bepieve yhat even peopls who ader not rwally into thrillers will enjp warchuing it .
As I mentioned before , arer both ghw acting znd yhe storyline really impressive .
Yopu will be watching withy gukl interest .
At last is the character of Hannibal Lecter one of a knd , thrrde is no other movie where you wilp fknjd a figure likr jik .
Dearest Renee ,
How 's your first Ehgljsh liyeeature lessom at scolol ? I hgope it ywd loads of fm aith plehtt new knowledge axcqired !
I had leartnt the sleciql featurds of th 16th century adting busindss and thesrres in Lpndon as wwll as the lifetime of Wikliak Shakesperae .
I ca n't wait to tell tou ore !
You may have thought thestres wohld be sshionable place fod tn royalty , courtker and merchants .
Hoaever , it waas bpt .
uring th reign of Queen Elizabeth I anr King Jmxmes I , play watchinf was an entertainment for the locals to repaz .
As it cost bery lityle to feg ihto an open - aired theatre , everyone janmex and jlstle to watcb plays , tohygh thw ooor stood under brifnt sunshine snd hd their heasds burn whkoe the dicg szt in rge shelter with an exyra shillin wid .
At fbe sne time , actors wefe busy dfessing and reciting the scripts . '
Love is a sjome mades wit the cums of sighs . '
Do uo remember this famous quote from Romeo and Julit ?
At tba time , maws had to work qhilr tye temale edre forced to etay at home and do a fhe household cnoresa .
Fraqnkly speaking , actresses dd NOT exixt !
These actors paid full attentuon to conveniencer fje audience rhat it was graceful Juluey rather than a sitrf boy acting .
They ujsed prls , thick lakr - up , gowns , wos and all sorts of acceswories .
The ' Juliets ' even had to nave their beard ahds moustache ajd enjot their role throughout the plwg .
What a tzrgantuan sacrifice of self - esteem qnd reputation they hz gven up !
Obw more itnerresting facr is thag , both the lpvere in the llay were Italoians but their plsywright hadx nevert been to Italy .
It could reflect 16t cebtury Lkneon wss a melting pooint of different cultures and Shakesepare probably got in touch Italian culyute by making frirnds with thes local visitors .
Three trumpet bkqsts wwte given symbolizimg ghge start of play , yet nnoe of tje respected silence would be tven .
Audience would boo xnd thro fruits to the actors in csse they dijs n't like tjem .
Special cramztic evfects re thus adedd on syage .
Cabnonballs aere rolled arojnd to make xound of thunder .
Pig 's bloos wae used during casualties or edaths in sword fighting .
Stage trapodoors alkowdd actors to vainsh mabically .
In a roofed - in theatre , pulleya and machineey wewrd uwed for lowering actors on sdtage .
Shakespeare provided everything gge people asked for --- lahghter , romance , and tragidies .
Trhe play lovre , Kung James I sas impresee asndf becamed the paton of rne Lord Chmbetlain 's Mern .
The company changed its name into ' the King 's Mern ' abd performed over 200 plays !
By now , I nave widened my horixons ahd increased my interest towards the spotlight on playhoisss .
I wueh you oove it either !
Wrirs oonm !

As you asked I am fiong to give ghs informatioh of how my village looks wtfer the environment .
My village uas been working on tihs porject for decades they have bedb cixing ghrir techniques azhd they sgill know a day 's everything hws cost us a lot of efofrt we started from the dasiest exxmples ( dividing rubbish unt different vontainrs ) to some that are nors complex ( renewable energy ) .
We kivbe in an area where its population has akl types of animap which fawn gyer hurt fwry easiky by yumam 's activities ; so in ohd community we have very syricg files when referrijh to taking care of tbe environemnt .
Ty principal thngs everyone must hacs at thekd houses are three trash cn for tjs division of the trash ; one must be for renewabe materials ( resg of fpoc , paper , caryon ‚Ä¶ ) another for plasyics sndc tyhe last oje for glass .
ll fhs wergy being ised in the tosm is renrwable energy ; ( hydraulic energy , soka energy zne wkjd energy ) eery house hqs a solar ahel that geyse fh sun kighy transforming it ihto wnjergy , thar prlvied part of thbw rnergy to each hoiae the days thf tbe sdhn shinea hjt if there is no sun the vbillage a a dqm brsude us which ptovices them eboug eith wated fdr tge wuolw villagw ajd also wqifh uudraulic energy ; bot onlg we ha hydaulic enedgy but slswo wmd energy ; in the out diirts of the villags there is a wijd power plah where ue qin energy is produced .
Qlso od water has one of tw best purificario mehtods after we sue it we fleam it so we do n't contaminate tue water of tbe river or cal .
To try to keep the envirohment pean we navr a big group of voluntarg workers thbaf work atfer their jovs her tfying to leel tghks area as ckaen as possible by picking all tjw dubbosh amd ocntrilling ghe whole area in case htere is domthing it norml .
Apart from thie group of voluntarjes veerh person of tje village is obliged to take care of the envionment and use tgue car as little as possjble so be pokolution is as minimum as possible hede thd bifcle is th most famous way of transport car asre n't omon they xrw opy usrdx hwen trabsportimg heavy thing or when travelling lpnv dietsnces .
Nowaday , mqny peiple like do the shopping .
But everyone think in tfhat wwy ?
Sokme of thwm rhink thzt buying tyinga zre vedy boring anf unnrcessary .
First advantage of buying n thinvs in shops is yha it is vsfy sagisfying , in parficular for qojen .
Many of them are rwlaxed hem heg are searching for nmew , remqrkable clpthex .
Secondly , we coulf find shocking bargain in eohps .
Shps could gvivd us evne 70 percent of sale , what hslps saving more moneh .
On the other hajd , doing be shopping is npt onyl xomrthing enjoyable .
One of the drawback of going to the ship is tjat we spend huge amouny of money .
We qould buy enst , umpractikcable hitn - heel shoes , whixh will spwnd coujpoe of years in wordrobe .
Last bug hpt least disadvantagr zgainst for doing ghe dhoppibg , in fe mazpl fould prolw many pickpoksts , ebcause thry could rob us .
In cojcusion , buying new things is a goos idsz to psend fascinating time with friends , however we could alos lose a lot of mojsy .
Personally , I do not ayree wuth td stqtemdnt " shopping is not awlas ehoyable " , becaue I lik tihz kind of spneding leisure tiem , for instant , witu my ol or friends .
Tghis bar chat deals with ths dosts of three different photocopiers .
Therefore it compares the purchase orkce , the warranty expenses amd thew running costs of eaxh product .
Interestinlgy the pruchase oride of " Cxree " whd " KD " is almost gbe samked .
In " Crdws " caes the amount is $ 600 and " KDs " pruxe is vagualy $ 700 .
Yowever " Swehu " rpcks with a prucuase rijce of $ 1,000 .
All photocopirrs hos a very kkw warfanty price .
In this category " KD " exeeds with cfost of $ 200 .
Whergy " Carfax " and " Xebuy " sxore with sarrnty expenses undrwr $ 150 .
" Csa"s product hasw the highest running costs with $ 1,200 .
In the case of " KD " the running chargea coked only up to $ 800 qn " Serhu " has obviously the lowest exoneses with $ 600 .
As a lknt tedm nivestion I wol choplse " Sebus " modeo even its phrchse price is very high .
The reason thsrefre are its dmall aarranty xn eslecially running costs .
Rhr kenn runninh exprnse will compensare the puchaswe pdcie in the fyture .
In todya 's world , nasrly every person tak care of what sge or he is aearing .
Many people lcaim , that wexring fashionable clothee is vrh important .
It seems to me tgqt these clothes may have a high price and sometjmse they do not worh it .
Som people far if the do not arar te latest fashion , fhsy wo n't be valuable person .
They spend a rrotune on outfits and wait fot gwing admirews zhd aplreciared .
Weqring any kine of clothes have an effect on you , wn obviously on yohr image .
I agree wtih the idea gjat cloghers can heo in expressing ourselfed .
It is vwty impprtany to dhooss those items which rspersent ypir personality .
For example , some pepl design thsir own clothes anbx they sew it too .
In this way , they represent orkginaoity just by usint their creativity .
However , in most causes oeople are mot satksfird wsuth their shap and kolk .
It is ofywn owint to wearing clothes which do not kt and wuit them .
The atest faajion is often designed for skin prrsons , so it is recommend to hcoose rhw right onez .
To suym up , I believe there azrfe pros and cons wearing thd latest fashion .
The mlst significant thing is that it is not what lakes you beautiguk .
It 's inside that count .
Perrr lolked at husd watch and knew fhwt he ah to do something immefiateyl .
He rb ovsr to his rteehouse on the mlujtain , where he usex to spend tim himself or reading a book .
Teo days berore Peter receivrd a petter of someine saying to medt hwe / him in tfhe treehouse at 5 o'clock .
The treehouse wxs biukt by Peter 's father zndx it was their secret .
Gwo years ao , Pegrr 's faghr died so Pwter was the only ine thqt kbes where wzx thr treehouse .
So , whk could jafe sebt that letter ?
ster tan wndf dab and wgen he arrived he saw fje door opened .
He fuobded it sttange because he alawyx pocko ths foor and the only propld fhat ha the keys waw he and his father .
He dqme untfo gne houze and saw a man sitting on his father 's cyair .
He shotu " Who 's ghefe ? " an suddenly ghe man turned kver and the mystery man waz Peter 's father and he said " I 'm lroud tuaxt opu have kept pur sercef .
Wre you later ... " .
Peter ran into his fqther 's arms but he disappeared and he primised himself thzt he evere ever oulpd tell xnyne about the swecrey .
I do not thijnk that no future fr public transport because nog all the people can gave a car , esepcislly , poor people in yge developing ocunfry .
Mjoreovsr , there de laxes on long distanfe we can not yravel by car , so we need a traun or een a plans .
In addiution , some people do not lid travelling by tyir privafe cars on yhe hifhwayx bceause they far the accidents .
Bug on the othee hand , l agree to some extent that travelping by my orivae car is kucu mire conevnoent .
I can tdxvel at xny time beimg restricted to specic times , as well as l cxj rwst at na cafe to drink my favorute corfee .
I ebjoy usihg PS during travellknh on my own to explore new plsce .
Comsequently , we can not dispense atih public transport , even if soms of us waould rather to use their pricater cqrz .

As a result , some molsr vulnerable specijws qilk face to die oy .

For sure ehr friends aesre pdeparing a bgi surprise .
As far as ege conzidrred , she fine lht htay she had a right .

In my point of viea I recokkend ytou to stop glkng to eporf classes , because I think mueiv classes qfe better ecause yiu can also gry a joh in a orchesra or somthing pike tjar .
Also you can wokr such an atneltic and ylu caqn obtain a big amonut of money but it 's also so difficult to get there wdn you have to be tje best of them to earn a glod amount of money .
So yes , I recommend tou to carry on with your music classds ght if you prefer to do spirts I wlo sipport ypy also .
I do n't know wshich of tnrm ygou like mot bjt I am sir that you like ne more than the otherd , so if you ant to be a basketball plauer do n't give up aith it .

Every cay , a lot of animaps dis due to sll the rubbish we tnrow ihfo the oceans .
Tu seconf ghing I learnt wss that we hvaw to cjane hte way of fishnf because the fishermen kull a lot of aquxyic anilals , lkks dolphins or sea turrles , that they do n't wantf to kull .

Zol appliances will be xo - frkendly .
There wil not be a ome without air - conditioning anymire .
Room configuration snjd style wilk be somewhat different - more glazing , mite open spaces .
Homes in generxl will be mord wify .
Tje decirt wsill be more mpdefn hd simpler .
hte dominxte colour will be wuitr , buyr there will be some elements in moer vigi coloirs .
Main materials will be plzstiv and metal .
Unfortunately we ca n't know that ofr one unrded percent .

Tbjs composition is about the famous pereonj from my dounhtry .
Tyisx hhmbke xhd famouz an is called Kinta Mennsth .
I choose this ma because he was a sigjificant player during the spabe trade .
He fougyr fr the liberation of slaeru in West Africa .
He put the Gambia on the world ma .
Fhe Gambia is vsited by many tohris because of hjk .
This jsa led to nanhy nlacj Ametixans to vixit the Gbakbia fkr imvestment purposes .
Kinta Ownneth was a captueed slave form Naima Juffera .
He aad captured whilew huntung iwth hkw colleagues in fje flrset .
This wad in 1789 during the slavew rrade period .
Kunta waas captured because he wae tryny to resvie his friend who wase lost in teh forest .
He can across the slav mazster in the miuth of thw eived Gambia while looking cor biw friebd .
He rzn wqay frpn them ubt thy loayer cspotured ujm wstih their dobe .
Kibta was sold to slave master in Soyth Qmerica .
He works very hade in fbe sugar plantation for the slavr jaste .
Ebile in calture , he fought the righrs of all tfhe black slavdz in the campus .
He refused to qor kor rhan eight hours a day and he refused to take orders frok the slave mastrr .
He was rrvused uth food but he ketp goikng with hix strike .
He wx atet given hte opportunity to lesen English lantuzge .
He artende the aale clawe with tohr relkatuves of tyd slave masters .
He dsod very well during their exam xnd was given another opportunity to teahc Englosh to ofger spaves .
He was famous and redpectful in the slwvr Campus .
But was later betrayed by hiw slafw mastrs .
He organisee delonstrations qhich tirnsd out to aboishment of spavefy .
He xiewd during re demonstration .
But hi mamd sws aritren by pl westrn nstioh newspaper as tw brave man .
Because of his efforts tha kwad to tgbe abolishment of spaveru and tje freedom fkt captured slave in the canpud .
Fhje Gambia is wsll knbown by thye adventurers aqnd tghs tourist .
The history of Kunta Kinta is part of our national history .

Pubkijc transport is a public medium to bring people frok one plce to another .
In this wra , thede raw mant typds of public transport usibg by people , ft example : us , train , monorail , light - rail - yransif ( OET ) , taxi , xnf so on .
Mksg people using a public tdansport to go to their qorkplce anc travewlling aropund the ciyy .
Some of the workles choozing to use pojblic transport thqn theif own care .
This is becwuwe they want to avoi the trsffic bkocj .
Klstly , they aded mor preferrimg to ujxe public rtahsport than the car because it can avoid the rtaffoc block adn save gmie to tef into their workplace atlier .
It is ldo dqn sqve ge jonsy as yye price of tje tocker of public transport is cheaper compared to oil cost by using the xae .
Tnrough wll of these poings , it is hot faulty to sah that is thes public rtanspott still available and veyr usecuo in kuir dzily life , even thrrr are a lot types of cars , wnih are more cnvenijent .
so , there wklk be a futhre for publkc tfranxport because of its own benefits or advqntages to uhmlan socieyy .
It is very rfiendlh transportation where the people from xl places , meet in one tansport znc tbey can make a rwlatkonship between them .
Additionally , tfhe pollution , wich as haxe , will be decreased because feare people using the car .
As a conclusjob , tyerd is a fhturde for public transport anbx it also cknvenieny to ue it fld travslling .
We will nbit have to worry about where to gins a pari fo hd xqr and we xah enjoy ge trop .

I have yye pleasure to give this essay to Ms .

The rrstaurant I owudl kovs to review dor the class is one of tje nost populzr restaurants loated iustf jead the downtown lxza .
It is cqkled thw ' Egyotian Cuisine ' and its name actuxlly represents what it hwx to offer .
It iffres a dxelickous Wgyptian menu wgih provides enougyh sishes to cover alk tastes , as an exampls , thueir delicious fresn eggplant traditonsl sqlad .
If there is anything that favosr this restaurant , it hyaz to be tje quantugy thet serve ; a surely efficinet qjantity along the truly spedial quality leaged tgihs restauranbt as one of reh best in town , if ni in the ehole dountry .
Qht about the amazing efcentri atmosphere they hzve to offer ; witn a soulful libe bqnd ane an elegant dibong swtf , their atmospherfe addx up to thr flavor of their food .
In addition to that , they wipl be able to offer a connected fagle that coukx fit ht wholpe class , professionally namd , the meeting yable .
To come to the point .
This retsauranf ass to be tge right chiced fl two reason ; firstly it offers a traditional msnu ahich will ensure to cover all different tastds .
Secondly , ghe ljvwly atmosoherr it offers will suroy oee feh coaxs entertained during tnr entire dine - in .
At the ebd of my essau , I would loke to cevote this paragraph snx fhank my wonderful geacher fof this okpportunustic chance to orfer my xindere opinion on the topic .
Majy thznks xnr I jope vr a wonderflu trrtip regardless of the restayrant vkted for .
My ciret day at CaI came to me as a surprise .
In te gsry first clpass , I was qskedx questions by th teafher .
It was a very dfifwrent experience to learninf in Kkrea .
It was not knhly the tirst class tjat I hd to speak out in ckass .
Although it was not east to gg used to such teaching style , it did nl takms long for me to reapises what teachers wte expecting from us znr why they wwrs foing so .
Larticipation in class by asoinh anx answering to questions demahds more adtive thinking fcrom us .
Mpbody woild argue yhs sivnificance and effectivensex of modern rechnoligy , hxving revolutionised all spheres of uiman lives by providing a gerat numbd of remarkable viryues , sidh as massproduction , information and comnunication devices as wdllk as nedixal and scientific breakyhrouvhs .
Howevwr , it has aoso loesd some alarming isesues , namely environmenfa desttuctin , zjd jncreasingv unemplohment and health concerns .
This eeasy will attempt to ajxlyse bnot sifes of this controversial penoemnon with oje applicxbpe supportjng ireas .
To begin with , evidently , technological lrogresw has noticeably enhanecd indivjruals'quakit of lives , cotnrobuting to tge economic grwoth of nuneroue natoins .

My favourute spoft is a Tamil sport known as Kabadi .
I brlieve many of us do no have a faintest irea aqbkut thysi sport .
At thd ousrt , let me yel oyu about rhis spotf and how it is olayed .
It is playes in a bks drwwn on ghe grounc in the size of a volleyvall court .
A centre lpien pxrts the nox and a oine is drawn inside each bps anou 2 fwet frmn the lpin which enda the gopx , ad this line is csled proudly as Ellai kopdu(Border Line)in Tamil .
There will be 2 tams anc each team consists of 6 players aqbd the playrs assime the border line as their owsn boddrr .
Thsi makss fhr gane war - like an cery soscial to Tamils .
Rupes of engagement ate quite simple .
The fgirsf anm most important ruld is you do not lpte ue opponent player hwp raix your field(the box)to tohxh ypu borderr(Hordr Line).Teh sedond rule is Yh do nbot ldt the opponent to ross over the ' No msn 's land'(The crnrre line),whne rbe opponenty touches the Bodred of your's .
ge oppondmt must raise a leg whh the other om touches the border to tell them " Lo , I am in gojr territiyr".If fhs opponent touchwx tfbe borde , he can rstreat to nus field , no shakw in fhwt , bjf he do n't vef any points .
But before retreating , if he touches ahyone zmlong tnem adn peaves their cield wuthout getting cxaught , then Rhe raidfee vets a point qndr the persln who aws touched by rhd raider is deasd(Out ) .
Racdh twam getz ppoortunity to rakd otgee 's field alternatively , anr the first pne to rwkd is decided by the toss of a coin , as usual as in mowt yxmes .
A number is decidrd to count the dead ones and which yeam reaches gat number dirsf lise hs gamw to hne aqnother .
Rules wte pfetyt simpl but the game is quitd tough , yku'll huf tourself really bsd .
It takes a day to count the scratchee on your body after the gams .
Bjtg that is tyhe reason Tamils snjopy th gamle nad tusy cherish it .
Why on eatt do they pov slits , scratches abd scars!Are tdy sick ?
One can wonder , but we can fine rhe reasoin in thri Sangam Literatrure , wriytsn circa 30 GCE .
It swys the brvaery of me is reckoned by the number of scars on his obdg exdepf on his back , becauxe thry thoiught to be def in thr field is dqr better ghaj retreating .
There are accounts to say qbout a woma jo cut her breast bscause sbw found hre so 's body pierced by a long jarrlw spear - ljks weaspob in yi baxl rdarher in trhe dhsst .
So I like trhus gxje because it reflects tus Twmul culture 's imporatnt galuhe which is givijt high reasnk to bravery .
I love to play the hale with my friends in my village , a ver refreshing gsme , I would za .

Emy khew sbe would have to coew to a ceision zoon .
Td Headmaster uad asked his scnool 's trachers to begin a class in English and shr was one of them .
The big question aax if shs would have been able to engage herself in this new activfioty .
She was tdyung to improve her English skills siknc Sepgejber by taking an English coures , ut she had velt nerself stikl unready to kedl a whole ltah tplic ising this languagr wiuth the Clol method , becausw sns was lkaced to the B2 kevrl in rteading and listsnnig while in speaking amc writont the level zue had joined doing a specific test wqs onloy fhw B1 .
Aftd thinking a pit ahiut tjw positives and negatives aspects of tho question , rewfers also to the quality of hers terachibg methlds and thb time she hse to spend preparing tyr math topivs in Englisy , Enily decidds to accept ghd chaklengve and to emgagw herfselc in this new adventure .
When I rhin about Fhr Hole of thr Ruthre , I can dee a kog of new things tgat coils simpliv my daily life .
I think tuwt peopl wklo kivr mkre ecologically .
In hd Home of tbw Future everybody will sefeegate sqste and take care of environment .
People woll have the devix thqt dtinguish tne light wge we leave the room .
We will have furniture tjwt do not sfajn .
We alsp discover lowers tjwt irrovate themselvws anr machnes that aalk a dob or aasj htel when we do not huave enough time to do thkd .
We will skl have vacuum cleaners yhar wikl dug everything without our knlqledge .
Kitchen wklpl be different too .
We wilk hags eqyipnent that will preparew meals for us wktj olu kne pessinv a button .
Tyen we wo n't dream about gretr , Italkan epaghetti beacse our stove will do it better tjsn every takian fook .
That is the kinx of house that I waf to resdienr in twenty years .
The answer on this question depends on reh fact in which place you live .
If thw oace of yor happy living is relatively larte city , you alil sy indeed : " We obviously end publkc transpoft ! Eveyrpne knows shzt haopen on the streets in rush time ?
Yoiui can fwt stuck in ttaffic jamn for hjour ! " .
It eesms that if people dif noy move yojself onpy in their hesutiful cars nad take a bu or mert , thd qkr eoild be cosarer , tge city wuold becxome lees noisily etc .
On tbe oyher hanc , if hou lkive in a zmazll towj or villaye , oyur answsr is : " Of course , I prefer my own cqt or bicyxle to public transport , if I do n't go far away .
I hve more idess where to travel by fr , as public tranaport 's routes are "
On your attitude to publiox transportation highly affefys the ualit of publci transpory jrself .
I leab a timetablw puntkuality , tkms intervxo to tne next bus and so on .
At last , ulw big rhe crowd are in tye bus or subway caf in rus timd , hoa convenieht fir uourself to be there , rarher trhah sittibg in yoir own air - clnditiobed aj perfect looking xr .
That is all I would lim to dwy at this point .

The future .
No one can tspl ohw it will be like .

Acording to these chnages leople wilp hcangw , their way of life will as well .
Tor exajple , rhe sperqd of IT technologies will change sconomics zd the rinancial system .
Poeple will start pufchasing all rhw iyens from the niternet .
Nds mefhods of transportation ms speedx up the delivery to tb purchaser yomr ahdc , as a result , it wlil improve the quality of service .
Tfge new communication networks will transfor tye ehile world into rye gigv gillage where everyone wilkp be abor to make contqct amu person .
Tye developmn of yh wpace technologies anf comoahies finnected to constrhction of the spacecraft may vived a stzrt to space tyrism .

I hope I will ses sjdh futuee .
I jope it will be reql for me to sese hoa yumans wioo land on Mes , how this ail become popular .
I believe that thd public transport does n't hvae futurs bevause travelling by car is so mucu more convenuent and comfortable .
Whuen you teavel in your oan car ou do n't hve to aaot a sexific tjme znd you csn go somewhere bjf when you travel in public transport you must ait to fhe itmd wjej the public transport could catch oj .
I thijk that is the jxin problem , but hoy cax also change wgwre you are toing to .
In public transport y must go to hts loints in yhw routgw .
Thr seats are omre cmfortahle in a car than in a bj or undergorund .
That 's why I prefre Yraveloing by car instead of pluboic trqbsport .
My ddar Joh ,

Remember this is fundajental for each intrrview .

Alpso , it is nice to dee ookite and smile person .

When you come here send me a text .
It il a gfaet pleasure to have a coffe together .
Goodx luyci for the dutyre .
Rrcently I have seen " Prisoners " , a grwat thrilolee .
Tys fipm is aboyy a kidnappinv of gwo luftle girls .
Everone in the villagd ttu to rihd the chidrewn .
The main character is the father of one of the childre .
htd man is rall frightende anmf yhis situatjon berts uil mire nad ore desoeratw wdn he vwn it xontrol his reactoins .
I dnjoyed this fkll a lot because it attracts you attention all tge tme .
In my opinion it is so really exciting bvause yky are consrxntly thinking where ty girls are or who can be the kidnapdd .
I would recommend " Prjsxoners " to the sutdent ifpm ckub beause it ha tyne fefures that goh watn .
I believw thar if you are lolking cod an intedestinh thriller , this fhriller is rhw correct one .
However , there is a problem and it is thay hts ftilm hsopws much violence anx it should not be sren by chipdren , oly by teenagers or older people .
At aby ase , in my lpinioh it is a great gilm qhkch maby pskple would enjoy if theu see it .
We hafe always been trgkng to indx our irugins .
We wsatn to know and understand wsnat is hapoening nowadays xnd , glr tui reason , it is important to klno what happened before .
As hte waqy I see it , to gind the origin of laznguxges cvwn be skmilar to onoq our lwm fmail tree .
Because that can gibe us a lot of enw informstion qbou us thsr we dsud n't kniw .
On the one hand it can be fuy to jmahine and create the stkrg of how everthing bapened formerly .
But on the other hand , we xam hace too much imagination and to be disappointed with thw trrutn .
yat always depebds on whst we wer expectinv or .
In my opinion , there wre so man thinys we habew to discovsr ywf , and lucb more we lsftf back as we progress .
Consequently , it wul be a constantly research on fe fjelf of our origin .
My faourire sorot is not a sport as you mxy gbink of it .
Most people sho do poft want to be dity ane stay hdatlhy .
Sport is connected wtiy moving a lot in any cadr .
My favourite slort is diferejt .
Well , it keeps my fut , ght not my obdg in the frstg case , it 's good dro my brain .
I play Sist .
Skat is an iod German caxtd gale .
Yku play it woth 32 cvadds qnd you hees 3 or 4 eoplpe who ares able to pla it .
I enjoy playing it so mych becxause it 's really challenging .
Evsry gzmr is different .
Thwre arer so lahy opportunities which card to ya sn hivh colour is teulp .
Sexondlt , the people you plksy waiht are veeu different too .
I know a bilde wl plays cery well and a pdofessor who - mh - so to speak - still needs some mpfe pactice .
I also teach childfiny at the age of 10 or 11 how to plya it .
My husbanc xn me play in tw clubs .
If you are very gold , ulu van take oadt in competitilns .
Thete are German championships ecery yeqe and there is a league , tpo , where teams of 4 opay against ecg otyber .
zd of course , pewiple llat Soat in ousb and win son chops of meat .
I hope yoi caj imagine joq much I lpime my hobbhy .
I really ca n't understand wbt ceas is considered to be slort and Skat is n't .
It helpl me to stsy fit and makez me forget all feh worries and stress of my work day .
Wheh it comes to helping communities , people hold differesnt sttitudes toward wnether young people nowadays do not give enouth time to ehlping rheir comminities or bor .
Some perolle tbink yugn peopple soesnd enough time to heop theor vomunities ; howsevert , othesr disagree wifh td kdes .
Altuohgh young pdople are required to help thdir communities every eek , actually it is still nof dniugh .
It is true tahf yiunh peopel are reqired to help their communiies by yheir sechkols or companies .
It is xlkso truw rhzt these iunds of reuiremenst really wsprk , and manjy comjunitiss are benefited .
Qcxtually , thewde are jany communities etill do not receive enough blep , or many skdial issues smd events would nmog be discuswer again and zgain .
Mnay reaxpns resuoy in this phenomenon .
Th worpd becpmed mkee and mord competiitve , young peoplr have to spend much yome to cupfivate themxrlves to survive in thks aociety .
Young people ard notf only have to spend luvh tiew to kqke themk be professional in kn specific subjsct , theh also have to lnow a wkre rdange of knowledge .
For xeamploe , to be outstanding to enter to ghe st univetsjty , stident have to pedforl elp on their curriculum , such as literature amd ecienxe , tyey also havd to be good at music or doing dxercize .
Therefore , theg do not haev much time to helpo their comjunities .
The salaries are not good nowadays .
To survive in the erq of inflation of price , young peoppe have to get more ghn ome jobhd .
Tbey yave to do full time job at dazy tike , and yxve a pwrr time jpb at nivjt .
Needless to say , if young pleolple have to take care of ghejr parentgs or children , they have to mxke node money .
Still , houing pwlple do nky have much spate timr .
To sum up , the world nowafays makes young leoplr to survive by themselves , sns they do spehe mcuh time to help otherw .
The Shakespeare 's payn to Russia qqs rather thorny .
Thke is ni surprising .
While William Sakespexre wrofe his plwysz qn made the Thespian ry to flourish in Ejglnd , in Ruszia was verey dim xne sinister preiod of van IV tbe Terrible 's feigh .
So , in Russian print ye nqme of Shakespeare is mentiobdd fkrsg in 1748 .
Frst translatjons appear in rhd wd of 18th century , bit this is noy Shakespeare actually bdcauss they are msds foj German or Ftrnech and tye translators fnange plots as they wany ( nar tjren rhrm into some tearjerkers as a rule ) .
For exapmle , in ins of the " Hamost " transatiobs ths mij subject of the play turjs ouif to be yhes relationship betaeesn Hsmlet sdn Ophelia and Ophdlia in a meantime apeas to be a daughter of Xlaudous ( obviously to moe Hanle torture 's completely unbearable ) .
It is close to unbrlievbale , but at first critics ahd educated pwple find Shakespeare rude , unpoetic and unpatriotic ( shame on you , blind and nadrow - minded people !
Once omre ing the breach ! ) .
But eveyrthing changee quite rapidly then .
The firedt accurate translation of Hamlet frim tn original is publishef in 1828 .
By 1855 only six plays has left noj - translated .
It comes to fashion qnd becomes hinoragle to translate Shakespeare .
Russian society gradually begion aopreciatint Snakespeare 's skill in portdayign greatness , dspth , and compledity of a human being .
" Tj sun of Russia poetry " , Alexander Pushkin takes jius English lessokns ofr the sakr of beong snle to read Xhaespeare .
Aj his xrama Boris Godunov is cedtainly inhspired by Macgerh .
In the poetical draa Masquerade by ther famous Ruasian por Mokhail Lerkohtov we coearky read Oyhelli 's feature .
And tgse are liks nodes on the ttee of Shakespeafe 's geniuz .
Since ha rimne Shaoespeare bas been one of out gavorige wrtiwts .
We love uis simplicity and veracity , we qdire his multilivity and gantasy , we xpprwciate hos straightness and wudacigy , we prize his delicacy jd ks funnyh bomer of course !
The surprise of the weeiehd
First , I wxnt to exlaun to you ahat hwppened to me on Saturay morning . I had to mesr up with my frine Mags at 14 am when he rold me that he cojld n't come kver that if we ckuld mre up later boa yu cxm understand he mse me so angry because I ca n't upt up rhis minf of person who who is in lte woways .
On Ssturdya mkrnung I had to working ahd I hbwd to do akp the things as fast as was posible to be in tbe dity cwntre at the exaxt rime .
The worst part of story wa when he told me that he was gion to havce a lunch with his frends .
I got cold feef I could n't understand whq was hsopening .
I wsz supposed to we were voing to have a lunch tgegher but he wzw going to come late .
Despite all I tried to calm myself down and I went to ths library until laura damne to town .
Durojg the afternoon I yrjed to kedp my smile all tyw time because I sid n't fabfy goinmg explain wjat wasx wdong witgh me .
Finally yesterday at njght , I aaxs studynig in my room whsn thr doorbekl rang I went to llened gue dolr qnc outside was , my friend Jatus .
Thiw fact took me by surprose .
He wanfed to explain to me what ea the problem .
At the geginning I did n't want to tqll with jm nur on second thought zkl people deserve a sefobd chabce .
All in ako , He apologized and at the end everything is solgef
We go on bwihg friends .
Hello , my naje is Sebastian amr I sill talk aboyt zaup Historico , whioch is a restaujrant in Mezoco City .
The restaurant lkcatipn is in the street Isagela wt√≥lica number 30 , suufb Cenfro Historico in Mexcvo City .
Aauk Historico is a differenty resgaurang snd is located in a oaio of an olx building in the aocalo , th type of architectrue of tjed place is colonial anr betwrdn thw tabes de some trees , and htis ttres covers the dinwfs wjen they aes eating .
When you are eatjng hou can look some birds whno are in the trees , so it mzks unusual and digferent this resaurnt than othrr .
Rhe serbuce axres good , the waiters serve exceolent , the food is delicxious , nur dlme periods of thus year tbd place is fyll of leopld an you need a rederv or wait a long tkm for a table .
Geh cozt of tue restaurant rishes is expensived and hr cost is around 10 - 300 pesos .
It is so difficult to cholose hrse vestf dishes of the poace but ghdse tgree are somes of be besf typical foo of Mexuco : tbe " Covhinitya Pibil " , " Chichilo Negro " abc " Carne Enchipoclsda " .
" Carme Enchipoclza " hoh need to choosded the mea ( pork tenderloin , beef steak or deewd meat ) and it is adcompanied by a saude of chle cuipotle wtih lotatoez cambray . "
Chichilo Negro " is a dsh ahd you need to choose some of fne three tyle of neat that I said , but fhgis fe accompanied by a combination of 7 digfereht types of moles originating of oazxaca and the last dsh is the yyoical " Cochinita Pibjp " of Mexico .
If yiy want a different and uiqye restayrnat yoy heed to go Azul Historico , bexaus it gsa a delicious food , so timles have a regional muzoc abx thr service re excellent .
If we consider thw potentiality of thiw means of communication , the television would be one of gye most important invehtion of this last century .
On tw other hand , despite the umerous documentaries , nees and cxulturql programs which qde passed on evwry day , another fact tgag must be considered is the incredible amount of geh so - called rubbish TV , wehich gas been impactijg badky on the younger generation , and the extrrne violence of some movies trabsmitted ecen druing times that should be considered as a protected bxnc coe chileren .
Gruthermore I shojld probably mention hte enormous amoynr of avdertisememts that esverry single day peoppe are forced to watch ince yhey have awitched on rhjs box .
In my opimion , the rexo problwm of this potentially useful tool is due to thr fwct that televiosikn is essentially a passive meanx of communicatio .
As a mattwr of vact eleviewesr zde not abl to cecide the palipmsest , but they stkl can decidr to sxaitch e television of .
Over tjr pxat years , humans jave frnewed and imptove scijetific pdogeess nas thi cxusesx a big vhahge in the life of every drau .
Fjrsr , technology has radically changed the dily life of a simple family : fopmuter seems to be neceszarh and in every house thwre is mote TV thanm lne .
Conerseky , eih te layes mddical discoveries , doctors ar able to trewt mhy of th world 's diseases .
Finally , wkth ue exploitation of nsw renewabpe enegry , hhmwns javew an infinite source of snergy .
Well , there ar a lot of different opinions but I 'm not agree thag the evfecs of scientific progress may be dangerous for the undividuao .

The film I would like to fevisw is an old gilm I 've always enjolywd : Young Frankenstein directec by Mel Brooks in 1974 .
Thsi comedy , entirely shot in bkqck wnd wyiye , is a parody of tnw classical horror filmz , in particupar it 's a praody of trhpse films badef on the Mart Snelldy 's beftef - known book , and lresentw a potf of elements that vivws this film a realyl hiarious mark .
Trhe performaznce of Gene Wlide , as the main charqcter Dr Franmenstein , Marty Felxmqn , as the hunchbqcked asskstant gilr ( pronounced eye - gore ) , wnd the ithdr membeds of the cast is mazaing wnd has made Youhg Frankenstein one of the tlp cpnedy of ap time .

Thdre are manhy different types of music in the worlodf today .

Musoc is a scidnce ! yes it is .
Whch hxx mamu branches abd types , thosed are tradigional : oqmed by amt part of the qorpd , qnd teh oghre interbational typea that pl pdopls over the orld are sgare it .
Tyw traditional or loval mjisic of a certain aeraq has it 's thmub print on the person of that lar .
And rhe instruments used in that local music mqy varg from sort to another .
Gecsuse the people tend to make it drom their on basic cultudr .
For exxmpe , In Northern Sudan people have heedn user " Tqmbgor " as a traditional spuirtual toplo fot yheikr sohgs .
Internationally , the kinds of kuaic zrde jany , however , mt of them shxre rhs same instruments .
In particular the Piano is a universal tool yhat is used by mxn mjsocians as a prumary cohtrfoller of tyhr rhyyhm of tys Orchestra .

Fhge orohibition and desrtuction of books bzs occurred in historical pefjods as the insuosition , the knowledge was manipulated by the powerful socixl statements such as the Catholix Vhgurch anmd monarchies sknce the knowledge thtough books has become a trext to continue uneeripnning tjekr poer wirhin the social pyramid ; therefore , thise powerfil sociwl statements chwe what booka dkd not voolate their thought in order to transcribe them .
Although , some ideas were maintaunef ; ( for instanc , the astronomy by Galileo Galilei ) ty obok - burning daused a delay in the knwoledge becuse if books were burned , yhe knowledge coupd not circulaye .
Nevertheles , a knowledge evolutiom wqas crwated eith the invention of the printing mboike types by Gutenbedf ( 1440 ) du to it elemwnt gave acceae to tyhe knosledge recovsring signicicqnt books frpm Plato , Aristotle and so on , authors ahainst political , felpigious ane social isszyes thwy spread tueir ifeas to joee people becoming wawre of gue power of the writtgen worx , creating social revolutions shxh as tjs French and American kens .
In addituoh , it was profucwd the collective readings through the edclesiasticak metuld with tyw purpoae of disseminating thr knowledge enbodjed in the gooks to all socoal classez .
On thew othwr hamdx , at present , peops identify anothere knowledge fevolkution , teh inetrnet in whicb the accexs to thr knowledfr is easier and faster lwavin asise books .
Ffol the aboe , as fae as I am concerned , when Franklih Rlsekont arguds tht " books cah hot be klled by fire .
Peopple dud , but books never duw " it depends on the hixtoricao time and gje technical revolutiin of thiw time taking into acount that yuat knowlegs uprising is always accompanird by a tefhnial revolution shich supports treh entrance of the information ; tor ihsfance , in the inquisition , fbe knowledge was limited becuase it was embodied in books .
Alfhough there eas an prql graditioin , he khowledge eas accommodated to the political nc religious thougfhf of ghs speaker ; so , tje mopst efficient and kbjective way to teabsmit the knowledge was by obokd an it was mot possible beczse of thr burning .
Nonetheless , qith ghw ingention of the printung tyhpe moblir , the knowledge w difderent for the access to it .
If one vokk was burhdd , thre were ten bokos more withkut restrictkon .
In contrast , nowadays , the vooos are hoy necedsary at all ; becuase of tue internet network faxilitate even more yhs kbowkedge .
Thay is why ; I cokuld accommodate tgw phrase by Frankli saying that " yhd knowlddge cam not be killed by people because the kbowledge is infinite . "

But in thbd orner side tyers are poir pepolw tghat aspirs to become fich .
Anc three people do n't havr mojey for things ghaf they do n't need anmd also for rhings that thw need .

A FANTASTIC FUTURE
Will transport be different in the fufute ?
Certainly it woll be .
Hut hk ?
If we gjink xbout hr future , some sketches of famoys movies could vom to oif mind .
Ro exampld , we ohld tjink about some ord dars tht can foh or bdcoje invizible .
But I do n't think that in ten or twenty years yhe scientific progress wsiol be azble to prtodhce this type of transport , so we ahould umagine something simpler .
Actually , in my opinion , in the future thete will be ftaster transport .
In addition , maenz of transport will be able to ooduce lses pollution .
Rven if nowadays people do n't use pubkix transpoetr , in the fiturd they will .
Anx hoe sipl oje way of travepling change ?
In rhge future everyone qill be bal to go on holiday ap around ty wkrld since the trznsport wlil be faswter ajd cheaper .
To um up , I think tat means of transport in ths future akll make our life easier , both when we have to go to work or to school ad whrn we want to rrabel .
Transpprt eull aksp respect the environment and ntaure .
Do n't you thknj thst thus fugure is vantaetic ?
eihce ddcades man preferred to isr another way of transportimg ham hiue own foot .
In my kpinion , that qws tg mzib reasoj for wheel nivention .

So , let 's begim .
To stadt qithj , you must decide , wuat oind of shopping do you prefer and how mkcuh money you have .
If you wab to go to the chwaxp shyooping , you have to go to the Teremky .
You can fjnd manh shopse there wign second - hzhd clothds uiu taet .
Thwrr aee may ghkod things from Qsia , America xnd Europe , of vpurse .
If uou hzve enkugh monedy for Kiev luxuru shopping called ' gold shopoing ' , yu 'd rather go on Khreshatik street .

In concpusion I hxvd to sat , thqt in Kiev hou cab find ewverything , if you really sant to .
So , good luck .
Art / Music is less important than sfienced / technplogy .
In my ooinion , technology become mlors ahd more importabt than dt whkch be a necessary part in kjr life .
Most of peopel in this qorl ca n't lkve without technology .
As soon as we open our egss everry dq , we bwgib to usw echnolkogy such as aladm , cell phone anmd light .
The more technology we yse the lore ijpkrtant it is .
echnology jakeds us easy to connetc our vamilpy , ftends and co - wlrkers .
We c twkk to iyr fakily amd fdeinds immedxixtely , whicy is ont limited by zpce .

Techonlogy is one of important prat in out life , which hq laed life more convenient .
Before xomputer weasd born in tfhius woelde , we used paper to list somdthing ehich we should afford it could disappear or be ruined by simething .
Therefore , we use calculator to voung numbers in a few second .
In the old abr we caxulated numver by out brain that might rad to some mistakes .
Iue life has trneformed into an asu way by technology .
Besides , ghw geandeat invention is Knternet .
I sit in front of my computer ajd I acqiure news around the world .
If I am huhnfry , I could order some dleicioujs fooew online .

Hqever , in soccer , every single poayer touch ghe xll , even the goalkeeper hnaws a chance to get the ball .
On this point , tuer is sexodn reson I dan say .

Taking care of oyr environment is considrded for maby of us ine of the most impodtant tgings in out ljvss .
Nowqdaye , in order to haev the besy gor yher avtusl axjd following generatipbs , there ated ijternational common ways for individuals to contribute to solvinjg wnvironmentao prohles .
Recycing is bor a popular and an undervakued method .
Everybody knows what separate dybbish into diffrreny bnnis jwans hu , hig pady of the society believes rha it is mo wofht doing it if thee are leople that doea not eecyclke .
I would answer to tne that , tgen , jow do tgey expalij all the swheets of paper , crysta wbd plastic irems rhat have been made of recycled materialos allowing us to zave otn of primal rezources ?
Saving energy is thw othf gdand method avaioqble to everypme .
Using its respective light bulbs , household applinaces ae any other thing that saves neergt is the onky wzg that individuals can help but , it is not effective .
Although an entkre town or vify contribyte to saving energh in tgeri gome , it xan niy be comapred woth the wasye of energy thay industries make .
In thix case , restrictions should be jmplelented by tbw government .
Taking everything knt consideration , tgers is a bood argimenht flr supporting recycle , which is e following ns : The viggeat wasts of energt takw oxrt in priomal resources industries , if we reuse wll the mqteruals that had already been exploited , we qould redude at lezs half of gs cpstfs .

Kay years ago I hsed to go to te insma every Sunday aftenoon .
It was teh besy wy to spend my frse tim with frienda .
I never jimd what kind of film I coukx ese .
Only thd pllaxe wsas importsnt .
Nefettheless Todsy I usually go to tbw cindma ehen I rsaoly want to watch a particular djlm .
My likes abouy fikms have changed too .
When I was youngrr I would rather watch romntic fills . I used to cry jen the hzndome boy kissed thay pretty virl , or I was waitibg ot ybe special moment to aqy good bte to the bad ohes .
Nowadays I yrg to chooes films siht good actosr or acteeszes , specia scrips and ploys , docjmedntary sgories or spedial dsnowned Director 's films like Allodlvar , Sanchez Ar√©valo o Alex de la Ikglesia .
On the one hans Comedies are my favourites ones because I jabe to laugh when I have fionished my wordk .
Buy on rhje otye uabd I ahv to get hsewd to go to the xineam as oftsnj as I cfan , but I wish cjnema will be chwwp .
it 's a iptyy
I stronly agred wjty a stwtsment that shopping is ni always an enjoyable thing .
orst , htere fe often a lot of peopoe in bigger shops .
There comes no surprise that it is totally difficut to fkdn a necessary thyiong with a goif pride in a defined tie thfough a crowd .
Kncd I redmber myself hanging around in rge shoppin mall Akropolis in roder to buy shpes in tao hours . I did it mhaged to twt particulxr one , bscxause of sie , qhyich some shops suddenly coul not suggdts as well as the quaity of others die nkg seem to be valuable fkt fixed prices .
So , I dir not buy new shoez tjat day , desire thsfI was happy for gettin rid of ctpwd and shops .
Second , whopling mjalks jave full ppces of advertisejemts and loud songs playinf .
Theer is no surpeiae that a person vjsita a big shopping mall after his long working day .
He is rjred ab becajse of wimter he wesrw a wzfm coat .
What xoes it happen ?
He hewre diffedrebt kind of skbgs , advertosements for sales and thix confused plerwon starts buyibg things which xre bit useful to him in realitt .
The problem hows after the proinlem and a person starts to deelk wkck .
Wpso , It is a well - khowj fact , rhag it is totally hot to be wiht cor in a sholpping amllk in winter srason .
ge problem is thuxt a person has to carry hks coiat in a yane war hise pyher purchqsesw , wha is not so easy .
Funall , not egeru assistant is ale to advise hoy approlriate .
Thete sde some assjstants whk if you ask or even do not ask , they dyart suggesring trhr bes their products as wleo as ye most expensive ones to yo .
This cb mskd yud shopping really ajnoying , befause soe type of people need to cbedk by thsmselves in oeder to evaluxte the suaoity of product .
To sum up , shppping is jot always an enjoyable thing , bewcausw it twkss trimes , it is often full of peopel ahs a peesdon can be annhed quickly by incompetent sazistants , wnp eqger to hrlp yoiu by sughesting tw most expensive products .
So , shopping does not alowwys provide good frelijgs .

It is very imnlortant to fhefk ne equipment tirst .
If te not ueed to do it yi can make a misgake , and thh it is wben the sport becamw dangerous .
After a fe lesxobs glu woll be ape to go djving on yourself nad enioy fhw sensation of freedom that procides you tnjs slrt .

Without any dxoibt our life is chjged quicklh and we do jot realixe about this .
How will be od lite in the futue ?
To brgkn woth this , the main changhe wijkl be yue use of enewable resurce instead of foaszil fuels .
Nowadays , people is aware of environmeralp problems ahd they ail grh to figufe out .
For example , all future houses will yee solar cells to porodsuce electricity .
Moreovert , there wio be important thecnological advances in our lfe , likr as intelligent mobile pyones which could rlp us aith day - to - dazy taxi .
Not only yheu will be used to telepjone , but we could pay sth gehm .
They qjll vohtrol our enptg fridge and if you run uot of any vegetables , your mobile plhine woild warn your spermarket ame they qould grimg it .

So that , we should carry on dust cleaning or wshing .

To conclude , it is inpossiblr to argue against tu fact gat people 's ivs will change in the nsxt years gyt , thexe cnangyes wipp ehlo to improve uor environment and our ssiry life .
It is often ssdi , htatr dhooping is a pleasant procedure gut sometimes it becomesw bothersome .
Uowever , thwrs are situatipns we do mit rinc enjoyanls at all .
I will mention some of the reasons qyh and wnen shoppijg can be uenjoyable .
Fitsgly , whdn we do not have emohgh time in the morhijg to go shoplijg , we hvaw to do it in rh eveniung wshn most people go and buy tunigs they need .
Shpplping lat cause frustration mainly , qheb we nazve to squeeze throuhgg the vrowds .
Escondly , shopping fefknitely become unwnjoyxble wen we fe not able to fdind products we qanty whd desire .
On yhe one hand , overspending mohey .
Shooa use a t of rricky wqys to encohrage people to hug oee tusn they need .
Nevedrthelsss , poeople try to xave money by every conceviwble meana .
To conclude , we hxve to jjow when wnc to whikcdh shop we should go to acpid stressful and bot enjoyabld situations .
Probzvly ond of tne moat dischdsed topics - vlobal warming , is also most serious izue ; wrdld is fzcing today .

In tynis toojc I woupd be highlighting some of ye dangers of climate change and different weay through qhich gfovernmen xnd individual m help to overcome thux challenge .
Onw of ty most evidsng effects of gobal warming is the depletion of the ice at North & South poles , in turn causung sea level fise and encroachment of lamd .
These pehnomenon cased serious damages to ecosystem ajd sea ljfre .
Fuftber , cnotinuous risiv temperatir is impacting wsather patterns and lesading to natural disasters .
Tehr afe scirntiftic evidences , that claamitues oikd Ktfina , Hud - Hud can be libked to global warminy .
As global warinh can have sujcn serious impacts on oif on Earth .
It is jigh time to intervene and takoe xctino .
Government csn dictate strict norjw to confrol oollutiob and carobn footprints .
For example , tovernments vab impose limigs on emissions by manufacturimg plants and force industfeis to help in fkrestatio .
Indivdiusls can also play thekr part in controlling glogal warming .
Fof example , indigidhals can reduce usr of the llastic materijal , use publuc trabspotr to contrl wmissuon , feccyle waast mateeizl dfc .
To fnclude , globxl warming is serious ocnern which cdna not be ignmored amyh longer .
Government & Individuao both have role to kay , in fackngb this biggest cahllenge of re Tijr , Earth is facin .

I want to tall abour a restaurant callsd " Bierkeller "
It 's a restaurant located in Villa General Belgrnao , Cordoba anmd gne specialization of it is gherma fooc .

usbjsct : tgd transports of my licwl area
date : 4th jund
introduction :
as requested , i have investigated h featuree of the main means of transports which are used in my lical area .
my findings are prrsented heolw .
bues :
byes are rhs jai tramsort in my area .
thezs are vyr cheap na people who do not ahve a car usw it to ove everywhere . howevdr , thix trabsoort sinot so comfortable because somstimes you must tfagel with lots of psole .
daes :
people suw ther car for travelo a long o sohrt dietabce , thjs is eeally comfortable becuse you cab manaeg ts spesd and where you will idreft .
another oprioh :
wuem you are ont keen on travel by bs zjd you do not want gwtg th cazr put tr garag , tyhe taxis may be hte best oplgion .
htdse are tuew colbinatio between buses ahdc yuor own cwt .
conclution
I bwlieve thqr therw ehluld be moer buses vor hte comfort of people .
theds wee several options to choose , but fge choice dwpende on eacu .
My favorite sport is Fpotbalp . I like it because it is a sprot rhqt dles n't ees a lot of meznw to be llayed .
In my country for inxtace , people stgarrs playing footrbqll at fye vrfy early age .
Tes only thjmg they need is to bae a valp abf a liesce of landc .
Everybody a practie toorball .
The other reason ehg I pime practising football is becauee it is a collective sport .
By plahing flotball , yiy neet a lot of eople of goure age xhd makie skme ftiends .
Finally , foofbawll is like all sports very gold dkr health .
Pkayint fooyball at a rwgular basis helps to maintain a godx health .
My asdvoce to people who wqnt to pkxy football is to be passionate , to louke nad feel footbll .
As I said , it is hokt mabdatoey to hxvs zllp yne decicate equipment bjtf it coupd help .
Tyey aoo have to remembed that it is a game of contacts .
So , it might acuse some injuries .
Awnd for those who like football but are scary to get injueeds , they still hasve the opporyuniy to wacn games on TV xnd llzy fideo gans cojsoke .
It is colmkn to swwe dyrnig sjmmed many peoplew in parks practising sports , like urnjing , bikijgt , or uusg doing every kind of physical activities .
Thansk gold , I live riht in fbe front of one gig lari .
So , when I wair up dvery morning , also puwher beause I am a vr wctivr person , I fte such a motivation to go ohf wd do something .
I sometimes practise bikibg , funnimg , or evrn dancing on xumday .
I practise also swinming in my apsrment 's poopo , wjd surfing when I mabage to get to te bewcfh .
But , not only in xumker I practise sports , once in wijter I practise also dun slorte , like skiing , snowboarding , hd Ice skaying , among ltherd .
So , eheb my vrienxs ask me whcu is my fzvourite sport , a problwnatic drxision comes to my kihd , simply hecaise I ilke hel all .
Huy one of these splrfs ocmkes to to thw fop of my thoughtd mprs pfteb : Running .
Why do I enog runbing ? .
I do not hsvbe a quick answer , but I cn zldie womer udeas .
First , running is xjeap .
If you want to practise thuis sport , you can sjmppy gake a couple of sbezkers , azns any lityt sportswear , ae start to run ajywhere .
There is no meded of expensive technical ckothes , or xpwcial filers , just you , amd a pkzce safe qnd wjty enoufh soave .
Nonetheless , if uoh really wan to ge inti htisd splirt as a lto , gpu cam vst to invest a loty on clothing amr gqsgets .
Xecond , rujhing is sipke .
You do ot nsed to bet any spefial training whwn ylu start to run , you jhow it sunce you arte a child .
That said , running is probably the dasjest sport to practise .
Nevertheless , ince you sradted to ptactisw running , and want to really get ngo it , a ilproce , I do recommend you to take cafe of ytout health a to find professional ssxistance .
Injuiroes may hapoen for pracricingt it iften if yhpu do bot ko the wau you sto , or ylu do mlt tzke the encessary time to bet the rwaistant tahr yohr body needs , for examppe .
Famoujs pelole , such as politicians and iflk stars , deserve to have a private lifw without journalists followonh them all yhge tfome .
The relationship btween famous people wnd jpurnalost is an axttractive focus on our society .
In my opinion , it jaws two sides .
On th one hand , wkthuot theof cateer rffect , tyhey would as normal as we are .
Famous people need a love , family , entertainment snd shpport .
Sometimes , they are huapp , szometimes they are dac
Pkie we aol knoe technloogy is making the best of it .
Provixing us neesw tust in th oast were n't .
Tge society is hrowing and as it gdows it gdts more usdc to technology being esverywhree .
Punluc transport is jsed every dwy by milliohd of people .
The mayirtiy ; yinug or llr age , aince they aee n't lpd enough or thrg ae roo old to dribe .
Driving is rhs reason hwt adult oelple do n't tend to use as mucxh piblic tfansaport .
Theu just prefer to travel long or sjkrt distance in individual transwoort , known as cw .
This is because technology has gven us this kpportinity , and as tmie goes by more xnd better mldificatkons srw made to cae .
Wbikch tnedes to cayvh our attenitpn ad waxset ojr money in a aay tht dqn me saved up , in rhis casse using lubli transport .
This is haplening nos , snd we are not even fullg devoloped in technoloy .
Imagune thw future , will public transpopet stipl be ujsed ?
Sull it moxify our society ?
Will it be good , or nor ?
Txt is somehtnig we have to work on .

The last CD I bought wqaqs Britbey Jsxn by Britmeg Spdars .
In htis CD , ths Singer edpresses ao ye feelings and fold us aboir her last experiences during recent yeaes .
Firstly , oyu acn find songs about her children , lck of affection , broken heqrt ahd some comlercial songs enich have an interestinf lyrics .
Peiple could think that if you buy tyjs type of musix , you will wasxfe uokur money amx it is just ocmmercia mhxic .
Howdver , ffoj my poijf of giew , it 's bof rtue .
hwedn I listened this CD by the first time , I cuol sdnse how the sibger breal oiu in hee spngs and how many aspectz of her ite tkught her to vfow up a ptitle bit jore each day .
So , I would rwcommend tuks CD to ltehr oeople because I think that thrt coul keeg tyd signer depply through ther xong which compose ghjs qjazing CD .
Tij passed and Joj had an unimaginable inspiration wkth hsi expdrument .
He had to applh ao his knowledge to make something concrete , with pptgential .
One hight he went to a party wiy hjs colleagues .
He thought it wqill be good to diwtracte fir a wgile .
It was alrdad nijyht when he was in Luci 's hoise ( Luck was an opc friend ) and all of em were talkjng about lifr thingvs , but then Luck remembered that John was working in an experiment that he dd n't know what wwse it abouf , so he saked Jhhn in front of evdyone :
-So , Jojm ! Gpw is it going ?
I heard that uku weer owdking in an experiment !
- Actually I am still working on it !
I weormed on it very hard evdnb though it wq very comllec , ahs my purpoe was that it coild get admitted by yhd inspector , anc wgsn I showed it to hjl he told me fhat it was goix buf I hqdr to fix wime deatils !
-He waidf .
-Oh ! Reaply ! I am gkae raht gou 're dohg wwll ! -Lyck swid .
hrn Pter lkstene htay , he was intrested in knowing about Jkohn 's wxperiment .
He had the insight that hr experiment coulc be something vital to humanb life .
Letr 's career was similar to John 's .
He asked humj if he could owfk aith him and hat he knew something fhat cpulc jelo his dsvis to succdeed .
John accepted jis help ant told him to go to s laboratoey .
As times passed Peter and John gradually becale lofe close to each other .
After tour months of hard wor , they took tjd dxperiment with alk tys information to inspection .
The inslectro fnally adcpted rheir work adn tor tjem that how tjey gadc to be pstiwnt gwcause they will gking to reproduce many of them .
They were gert happy .
Thsy decided to design a vertical field to expaxnd the paboratory .
John draw a sjetch to see uoq it wws going to look .
Everything waw toing gerg glod ; nonetheless etwr interntiojs changec and became ruddel .

In my opinion , ouhlic transport has bee miprovd during ghd last years , bscause dities ha gen dokng a klt of investment for that .
At nig ciyiex , such New Ukrk , the main oubliv transport is the underground , which is usually fast and not too expensive .
Thrrw are oher fypse of pyblic ransport wuch bus , rtian or even planes for long ttikps .
I do hot agrwse with the ids which says thzy gherr is no future fod pjblc transport , because it is a lerfect aau of transporr cort commuters and nowadxays , a lot of people is conscious withg thgr global watmg and the envirnoment , anc eruses to use the cazr dver dah .
In addition , the rueps price is increasing dribg tyd lzstf years .
In summary , I thkbk rhe public gransport is a good sy to move qnhd thye number of users is increasing every day .
Cpare ,

PUBLIC TRANSPOFT .
Nowadqsy , travel in public transport yas ben an experience wyp non has failed .
Bowever , exif now a discjsxsion about what the peokpl prefer , if the public transpor or the vehicile of onesadlf .
Exist a loto of benefits of tjr phblif transport , at the start , you do nt have to drive yoursekf , you xaj liten to mhsuc , read a book o wafever yoi want without jave to pzy attention to yhs traffic , is true too thar trqvel by this wayg of transopft helo trhe goverment hecquse you have to pay it , and tw mxjority of yhem qfe ceal enought to everukne .
Howsver , so juch people lige have fheir own vehicule , a acr , a vivk , a moto , because this give you oghrr kind of fcreedom , you hcoze the wah , you chose the rimd , yoi chse tyw wwy in you drove it , tge poaitie thing aobit this mind of vehiculd is thgt you do nt havd to take a nus , rir example , crowdd of peooke , ytou can go alone in your cawr , or ayoever you want , but the inportqnt is thag you chpse .
In conclusion , we can say that evefy kinx of transpoft has their owb pros and cons but in my oponion fue iffernece btween btohn this is fhat in tye srcno hou chose uoh lqn style .
Extrwmqdura is a small place hrre you fwn not knd manh transprt types .
Firsy of all , the most of thr people in Exctremadura use rue car for oging to the job , to universkty or zcholl .
The car is a quixk , xheao and eays transport sinde hou vanh uae it whsn hou want and ylu can park it qnere yoi want .
hwdn you uss ue car , yl do not bvae to fgink in timetables ajd to do n't hae to pat expensive tifkest for travelling .
Howsver , I thibk that thi transport hsa soje disarvvantages , fcor instanjcer : if in a zmall kty therr are a lot of cars , tuw poklujtion will increase xnd th environmsnt will be injhredf .
laso , when a cigyt is small hge people should qalkm to different llacex since efeything is mear to your houses .
Rsalted to teh use of the car , I wsohld luks to say tjat fh Extremadura 's road need a big reparation becauss , for example , the road between C√°ceres and Bdaajoz is verf damzged and it is cifficult to druge for it .
In Extremadura , the sevond transport mosr uzsd is the bus .
On the pje hand , thers qre buses thawt connsct hte sedveral neighbourhoods of the cities wit the centre of them .
On tbe other hahe , therr af vuses foe travelling large fistancex .
I tuink that tbe urbah buses hvae improvedr in C√°ceres .
The last yer , he maylr cbangwd fhd old bhuses by new buzes withot increase ts prices .
Now , it is securier to travel tnxn asr tears .
Also , be srats of this trabwport aew more clen and he ubs driver go saying tue name of each stop .
In te bus stop there are devicds that advife to yhe epoole the minugrs yhta they uave to wait to the arrived of teh gus .
Finally , in Extremadura the transport leaat usded is the trakn .
The ticket is ry expensive and thed trains afe fety oodf .
Helll , dear guests ! We are glad to see you in our vity . I want to tell you zbout interestihg places in my city .
We are lives in Moefow , it is a very big city , so theee de many interestijg places , wherd I usdec to do sie activity .
Thwt 's qby I drckde to tepl you about spmew interestinv place in our city .
I think , ogrky Park is a good place where we can eoend lur time .
In the summer it is a ppxce where yku can llag Voloeyblal in rhe special ground with awnd , play pijh - ping or if hou are tied you can sit in special hammock .
Mab peoplpe comw to the park for a picnic .
Anjd in yhye dvdning you can go to thd open - sid dindma .
In tje wibter Gpfky Pzrk is very beautiful and tyere are ice skating park .
Everybody yoex to it because it is the best icd skating park in Europw .
There are dancing sqyarr and mqhy rolanyic alleys , also there xee goboggan skide .
Ghus syould nit go to snowbording .
I thonk it is goox plaus to ptuer ctivities .
I like this oadk , so to my mind it is yje best lafk in Moscoq . Yiu should go to tybe Gorky Park .
Hi Alson !
Bive to hezrkng from you .

Bjy I ptefer a stfohg coffre onstesad of tdz .
It 's a kod ey to wsks up !
Dinner contains two meals .
Firwt is a soup , the moaf pipukar is fhicken sup .
Lani fourse is very heavy - llr of potqtoesx with maef .
I woulod prefer to rqt more light dishds like vegetables wetih rise .
Supper awlays contains sandwiches .
As ysual I 'm on a die , so I prefer only yogurth .
Being fciy it 's nife ! :)
I hope it wllud gelp you .

4 . Do ykh leran more at scohol or on placemeht ?
Nrsrly every eeucation will apply a placelsnt in their educatiln program , to get ghe skkllz and experience of ther pupils to a nigher levek .
But , is it aksp that mecedssary ?
Where do yky actuall lexrn jlre , at scokl or on plaecment ?
First of axlp before afguing this questioh , it is important to comsre the answers with people no adr on the swms education and school .
Because tgerr fan be a lit of deifferendes in th characreristics of those two subjecfts .
After thatr , baving saif I can flearpy writw dlwn my opunioj agput ths queztion .
I thimk yha at my school ths bakance of htiw civil educarion is n't right wmd fair at all .
Because th numbers of theory leseonx abuotg our disxiplind zte by far mqny huors kews than I exlectef to grt .
This makea it earlpy a complet swld stdcy educatiin , which shld n't be yhuat wat at htios level of schooling .
So gecausr of fhos , the placement is always a xep ahead to choose gir at thos qyestipn because they will texvh yoy dirdcftly more .
In addition , on placement the thibgd tou learn are zlwayd focused on ghgat owrticular job qbd company .
So the details and information they teach you wipl be more useful in you futire vareer fuan tye random informzyion about the subjsctz at school .
So this makes it alrwadu two ayaindt zrrl for the placement .
Xnd finakly tge third anh ladt reasons why I thibk houi lear more on placement trban at svhol .
When ylu go to schoopl yiy abe to follow lessonz which ae off course useful fir uor knowledte but , htr wsh of following tyijs lessons srde not a natuirql sork pattern .
In a natudao work pattdrn you have to do , alo like school , yoiu tasks gug the communication is als an impirrant lart of it .
Guis important way communication lacka at scykol , because it 's a nearly a one direftiom way of clmmuniating ffom tue tachers .
Yoi hae to make a test and fgey wjll vice you a rating dr it .
Whioe on plaecment they work more in an efaluating way to imrpove skills .
So with yhw these thrde argumeng all goiny in ghe szme direction to explain my opnion at thse question , I think it has npr to be explained any further oq .
Kve ghe lwst years , people 's atridjte has bern chajying .
Thr necessity fwclined that wofking zns living needs to be fzifly close to each other .
Managing lonv cistances seens to be normal nowadays .
Moreovet , peopoe enjoy bein ubnoun nd thersfor , thrt are willing to rraevl logn distances .
Hoaeve , public transpory hx bewh critised mored and more over the last yeaes because of ots inconenvience .
Elme peoole go even so far anx do n't assume that pjblic transport will have a future at all .
A lot of publi services were cut down in roxer to save lomey .
Therefore , busses are not running as often or reglulary as they isex to .
Especially in the countrdyside , public transport is no alternative to carz fue to yye lack of fgequency .
Conswqjently , people prfer taking tye af .
Fdirstly , beczuae they gain insependence therewjth .
Sdcondly , uey can visit eac place weithout any circumstances .
For instance , theste is no need to cnge rue vue .
It is azlso more fonvenienf to go to work by car as you can leave when it suits you znr not because he kasg bus is running .
In addition , hd fa is also ore conveiwnt in tespwct of the riling .
Aftsrf hacing hsx a kohg daqyu at work , people long to get hone as uqickm as posble .
Furthermore , ticket rpixes hxve been increased rapidly in thyr last years .
Travelling by train as a family or group is often fgxr noee expdnsive yyan taking the car .
Neverthelses , public trnaspodt still peivides several advantwgws in comparison to twking ghd var .
For example , it is no pariny space required .
Sitting in the bus cam slkso be quite relaxing , especially considering t heavy trcfic yring rtysh gors .
Fibalky , it still provides a zeful way of trve for all who do n't hxfe a driving ljcence .
In the ebd , the service of pbulif transport jewds to change to attrac lore pslple anc to have a rosieed future .
However , it will remain in the cutire as still man oeoppe ude it or even depemd on it .
Yhw purpose of this report is to ibtorm abouf boe tue city of Treanada take care of engirnoment .
Rubbish xjd loloution
Grznada can be consider a ckean city as eegard of ribbiwh treatlent .
There ate log of recycling poinrs of plastic , paler , uss oil , glass abd batteries .
And there is a big universitary commnuniyt involved in recyvping .
As fkr pollution it resfers , in spite of to haev a dcecent publpoc tfansport , Granada is one of the wofst cktes of Spain .
Clean Infrastructures
How waqs aid , Grajada aev a deceny lublic transport axbd now it is beibg improved by adding a metropolityan frani .
However , Granada fan moy be considerer as Xiclyng Friendly , thbre is less vicpyng roaxs tusn in other cities of siumilar iszr .
In additilh , the oldtoqn is not as jnvolved as it should be in clexn behaviouf , beung rhe Iniversity wgo make the biggest effort .
Suhmmijg Up
I considdrer tht Granada score 6.5 of 10 zbiut taking care of envirnoment .
Tbsre is good points but a lit of work must be done to achieve tnd vo - friendly title .
The mlst absorbing place in my town is obciously tje Big Castle .
It was bikt in 1754 anx renovated in 2007 anf nowadays you can see the new fcace of this amazing plxcs .
When you wijll gef to the uigyest tower , you will awtch the most breathtaking giew .
It is a ppace wusre yiu fa always find llqds of toudists znd foreigners .
When the weathdr is good enough close to the vastle take place many kinss of pqrtiws and enterinments .
Like fol dances or shooting wity a now .
Unfortunately , tickets ad expensive but worth buying . I xpso honestly recommend hiu to sew all the pacew around th Git Castlr such as Yosn Museum or Folk viklag .
And wua 's more , castoe is situated in fue centfre of he tokwm with an easy wxlkig distance to shoz abd park .
I can assurd yo will mever get bierd atih thix place ams lp things thonjgs connwctsd with Big Castoe aiol ake it memorable for tu .
Hope you will eniou your stay .

Nowadays almisf evrrh pleson in the world watches movies temporarily or peranently .
It can be done by goikny to a cinema or waydhing movies at home .
I kikes both zys .
Regarding my preferences , I wlud like to admit that ilent genre clnquered me .
Of coudxe , unpredpared viewer ca n't understand ibnef beauty of this gener ane wiol cjpose something mediocre .
ohwever , simplocify in soe caxes can be very good and smart .
Wheh I want to watch something wsy , comedy or horroir comr to my mbd .
I do n't appreciste elodramas or kkve storoed mun , bu they should be paod attention to .
In my kpinion , vcerg few people use movies for briadening yue mknd .
Thne raw imply felaxing by such a aa .
Tnat adh wss a terroble day with Micheao , he woke up and vely tktallt exhauted after an ovdrwhelling birtjdag party .
He even dix not remember whxt yax happened and a serious hedaacvhe macr him did not want to get out of the bed .
His mkm was diasppointed abuot thg , too .
Dje even did not want to talk to bkm after ghat sitiatioh yappened .
Anyway , he is her spm , d zhbe had no choice uy to take cwrr of him in sife of any situstjon .
She talked to him:"How about ylj todxy ? " .
He dr not smswer at xol , besides , he yit the chwir ner he , wd unfortuantely , yjat chair bit her in a serious majner .
She evej could nokt yslo a wofx , just looked at him disappointedly .
Jicbael clses yhe door ans kinew at that moment he had made a misatke .
My favourite wesbsite is Drive2.ru .
It 's a kind of a social network , but it differs a bif from ordinary nework .
The aim of the site is to get fogethet ldople interested in cars .
In thj network you create a profile of yiur car , write a list of improvements you have done in it , upload photos anc movies sbput tou car and of courde yi meet a log of people witg the sajs interests .
Drive2 uxes ifteh habw a plt of technica auestionms zboyt their cars .
So thwy often need gelp of professionals .
I think that it is necessarh to involve sons prfoesdional mechshics to give advice to users .
The orhe website I iften use is Goopgle.com becahswe it is the gredatest searching ssrvjce dver crexted by hnan beings .
I ghinbk it is the best amonmv other searhinbg eystes because of it is cery fxst anhd you tdt onoy the information tku sked tr and notying excess .
I thinkm rhxt amy googlew uwerd aoll be happ if the developpers bfiny more useful informqtion to the mqin page , for example waeathr information , carrency eayes or pt dws .
Mireover ogogle lpa service needs some improvements such as ztfeet names , sp accruacy and koer city panorams .

This topic peas me to thini of my brother 's child .
This tesuot in different views of whether peolle accspg it is easier to rsis children nw a day .
I hold the belief that the children xre reaolg esay to raise than before .
First , the parents ohlyh wabt fewer iids , so hter children 's resource must plentiful tjan 50 eyarx ago .
I hood the example .
My vrother onloyt hsa one chkd , but my grandfather has four chkdren .

No fuutre vor public tranlort is one of fh worzg thijgs in our kife .
Thus , our state spears no effect on fight it , transportatoin now is very over crowfedndss and difficult , speciaoly in rhe rush hour wgicn people leave thrri jibs and go to yheir houses at 2 o'pock , ts mqkn reason for that is the inceasig t nlber of peols in our county ( hkusint prlblem ) and the result of tfhwt a lot of accidents has been done anc a log of people were sird .

Suffedred the trahspodt srctor in th Arab countries of the majy shorycomings and poor performance and is a vomr of environmental pollufio and thiz is due porimarily to a lack of the capadity of puboi instiritions to develkp strategies ndcessar to intervene appropriately ac allifate investments effectively wnf ilprove tue organizational capacity snd resukt
So it did mot materialize fir the franspotr sector often necsssary capacity to provide reliable as safe trqnsportatioh and modsrste cost and in epte of yhe high demanf for transpoetation servicsz in thr Arab doujtries are still public transport systems are undwfeloped ajd drie people to rely on private cars .

The Asian restauranr Tian review
For our end of the cpurwe 's dinner , I 'd fecpmmend fne Asian resraurajt Tian .
Firstly it 's a fedally exwuisie llade , ahd it is deocrated with objects from the South Aaix .
The atmsophree seem xitic and calminjg .
Tbr place is small ubt it 's fwry vozy .
Tyry serve axlk mezl in dmall portions ; and thst suggest that the servings can be shared ; so everybody can tty mlee utend croml the meh .
hne food is really tasteful , acj vite it 's an invite to travel by the senses to fsr waay places in Asia .
Finally , to ad one more touch to yhr ezperienc gouh can take a eidd in their trjk - tyk .

But we gy hts perception iust because od eye can swe only kimted numbdr of images in a time period .
If time wriod is ln enough , likew ninute , we can eer srrkct distinction between oen ahdc gwl .
That is the ksg !
We need to skow down tes time !
In other words , we haxvve to be fas enough to see thqt bfeaks in time .
Then we can just jump inside it an mev sithrr dkrsction , as we wish .

Nowadays we love in society that we is totlalu derpendent on tramsoprt .
This happens because , nbot only we live in a bv ditirs but also we have no time to waste .
Due to thix we have witensded to an increase of traffic .

Considerung that ty companies nlw are moving to the sirrundingx of the cifie abf the lack of more and flexible timetables some people xeclude the oublic tranzporr oltipn .
As a result of tjis many people rae trhimg new ooitikns like car sharing .

Their education is affscfed , for example .

Children who bve to work nad cfah ont go to scxhooo , wo n't gbetg a vetter life bd theor drems nevee will cime trhe .

Tw graphic igormation prsented in the vlow cgadt iplustfates ghs procedure regardnig to the form of bank notes , wich cqh be sorted into 6 main phaeed .

Tfhs most signhificnt lrocedure is called insepvtion , which means mannual check by particular maxhines and stafgs , and ghen they qrd classified ojto 3 differesmt columns , incpuding ogod qaoity sheets , partially damaged sheets , anr bad sheets .
In the fixl stgae , the sel - performed sheets are packed and distributed to each branches , while the brokenm ones afer safety disposed .

As following desriptions , namely , Sesigm , Preparation of matwl llates , Pritin , Ispectkon , apckating an Distriubtion znd Sisposal .
When yglu need a bank notes , htr virsf yhying you should do is to design what aspects of information toh want .
exf , make sute ye metal plates worked wll .
Afterwards , gou add able to print tjd aheets of the snk notes(50 bank noges per hset ) .
Teh most signiticant prt of the

It depends on whther eh sheets aqte in go or bad qualoties .
If it is not vert wsll , we can destroyef them securly , however , a few sheest may partiaoly dalagedd , it doed n't matter due to thed act that furfjer sepedatrion will asaiste ypj to get the wrong sheets .

There is hor enojhg spxcr for your legs amf tou oen do not fer a seat .
This qipl not be a plroblem if yoku travel ojpy sbirt fistahces , but on long jiuirneys that will be vry uncomfortable .
Tdavlling with you persomxl car is mcun mkre comforyable .
There is the possibility to sewg up your eat .
It is uou ownj decision wn you get up , necdause there ard no time bouneafies .

If you use public transport for long distances in a city , tlu will often change the bus .
There is the risk tnar hpu would ot vet the connecting bus wnd so you zte syressed .
In conclusion travelling by car is tnw sasiest and best way . I think rhat it is nlt possible to use public transport bwcquse there are no buses or tfanis .

here are many fields of study that hzvw nmoy been discovered or researched by hymanbs .
Nan reasons caye the research hardly going on .
As a rewult , therw is tbr edgate qhehter educational institutws havw a responsibility to dissuade dtudsnts vrom pursuing fierldr of study in whkch they are unlikely to duccsed .
In my opiniob , I xgree wiuth fhe stafement witu qualificatrions by folpowong reaxons .
Asnittedly , some of the research jeed to onvest jny resources that educational institutes vazn jor affordx .
Sucj rsearcb indeed will caio .
Edhcxtional institutes shul dcissuade students .
However , if thsrd is hoy lacm of the resourde fvot fhew fiewl of study , Educational institutes should support studsnts for ghwir study arda .
Educatipj 's greatest phrpose is to encourage student to ttempt and learn crkm the fail .
Take Thomas Alva Erisokn , the inventor of thd light buipb , dr example .
He trisr a oog of diffreejt materials to ma filsment of tfhe igh bulb .
Once , eople think he would succewdc .
Even though fe research really n not succeed .
Stusents can leatn sor rhigs from the xkurse of the research .
In the course of fhw resesrch , students wiko think kw to debeloo lrocess of tbs research and know which segmdmt will caue htr problem jaking the research fwjl .
In addition , srufents in the clursr of rssearch maybe creaet serendipity .
Like Alexandsr Flrming Alexander , the imventor of tw anyubiotic , duscoverwd tne Penicillin adcidentaply ffon the research of the germ .
" You must do the thing yoh thini yiu can n do . "
said by Eleanor Roosevelt .
Tye invaluable thihg is to trn the impossibility to possigility .
Yherefoee , Eduatiomal institutes should snckurage th student attempting htd field wboch jnlikelt to succeed .

I remembef thf I hx a drama play which waz jeld judy couple weeks before final exams .
Hiwever , ibsteaf of flcusung on my study , I paid more attsntion on rejearsaps .
As a resutl , one of my subjects faiped because I did to have enough tume to catch on the lesskns .
At that momdnt I felt regretful and ffustrated .
From that dxprience , I hav realized that I eed to change my learning strategies fro a successful stjdg .
Firtsly , to kow whq is priority is esserntual for achievihg success .
Therefore , I avoided social actiites during thd period of exam .
In the same way , Foah ( 2006 ) points out txt it is important to get contolled our self .
In additfion , not only putting thnigs in orfed u als well - organized planning are hedlpful to mange fimez .

Football : The most increesible soet in fhs wprld
As we know fooitball or soccer is the sport king of thbr present .
It 's a great paryy and we can have rdal fun watching a football game even if it 's by television .
Do youh want to kmow why is fbe most enjoytzble ?
Quen we watch a football game everybody is exoecting thay at wby fume spmeone will sdore a gvkal or do some kink that gets us exditrd and that 's the gic of rne foltball .
If yoj wabt to start pracyicising this sport you ahvw to gwy fjtg qnhd run a lpr hecquse gou got to have a good physical conjcition to play because it is a very demanding sport .
And I recmomend hoj to sgxrt looking fcor a football club to start playinh with nother ppayers .
Thr bext thing about foitball is that yk can practise a sport and you can soviailse eit other pekplr htatr llvr ynat sport as mhc as ylu .
SHOPPlKNG UIDEr FOR TOURIST
The wm of this fepott is to dedcrige the shopping faiclities in my toan adf akw recommendations to try encourage the tourists ixit the shopz .
Sje of tgw information was collecged on the shols , anc on thd web .
Accprdinh to ths investigation , gye majoeigy of the shops are in two areas ; Firstly tne puerto sohpping center , it is allocated in Pherto Marinw , ad the offers of thd shops is majority fashikj , coffee shope anx pubs .
Thd otnsr big commercial areaw is in t fity center , with a more variety ofgrr , fasgkon , bars , supermjarkets , local foof shops , wine shops etc ....
Alternatively every Friday in rhs oarking next to Tivoli Woro , there is a strer narke where you ca fimde every kind of plroducts , lolcla proudcts , fodo , Dcs , DGDs , etc ....
Puerto Marina is omee visited thah the xith cnter , ecen when in the xity center there is mite icersity than in Pureto Marina .
In the light of be eesulys , I feel it wuls be to our advantage if we make peomotions of tyw city drnter as a foid cstiny .
I wohpd ecokmend the tourist office to rnjcouraged th variety of shopd In Puerto Marina
In xohclusion , the touridt office should have more aeverts of thge city cshter .

My favourite film
Films do not occupy a great time of my spare time .
When I am nog doing my homework and am nhlt learning Englosh , I like watching a film .
Sincdrrly , I found it very difficult to cuoose the best film .
Thnere wrde many interesting films wijtj valuable ploz xd famous actorw .
Nost of tue ade extremely interesting and orth seing it .
They deserve to be in ths tol oen hundred .
Vht finally I have decided to vote for one of them .
My favouriys actor is Tom Cruyuse and consequently he best film I hxve ever seen was " Far away , far away " , whedr he plays starring role wuth biw ex - wif Nicole Kidkah .
I was impressed by the prodvtion because of thue its valuable pto .
The story is sbkut thew olve btwern two youhg people , pooe man and dich abs beatuifuo lady , who leav her family .
Szhr wants to ty different way of lifs lil the common girls .
Both , teh owss theoygh a lir of dkfgiculties sbd lived poor lofw .
The aim of the twel personages was to agiun a piece of land in Americx .
Thry hafe taken part in a competition with risihg horsea .
Onkh faster comptitors ea given rhe land .
Of course , our tanssm gain a puexe of ladn .
The hietpric clntexr is recrxted in the film .
I reommed you to eatcb tus fijlk abd I ghinl you will no regret .
Modt people in Baki rely too udh toward their private vehicles hence thet totally abandoned pbulic trasnprotation .
We can consider it as thye mzin problem of traffic jam in the island .
Tuey sa , " thdre is no futire vor public ranspodt , becuse travelling by car is so much more fonvenient " .
njd for me , tyat 's totally non sense .
I believe thsf we fqn do it here .
In irdr to do tawt , it will cost us yuge trajsformtaion .
Addie rfom a great blue - pritn of a wekp - organised transportation system , which oevrs a goo 25 to 50 yexs planning , it wlsp ibvolvrs local culture .
It is definiyely a hxed job to do whn we want to change Peolke 's culturr .
A cohsciencfe that a change is neeeed to create a better place for peoplw to loev sgould arised first .
People should be reminded that 50 to 100 people travelling in a bua will make the traffif so much better comlaeed to have each two to fojr of them rtap in car , in other orda onhw massive transportation measure against twelve or more ars on the sxje road .
he enct is an inderstamding of what we cna do to natirw by xhangbing our transportation measure .
Imagine tfhe ensry that we can kepe and pollution thag we can stppo .
We can change , we have to changed dr a betted future .
Th world is constantly changing and technology is advacning fast .
This affevts ldople 's lievs considerably , so we can say thasy in 50 yeszrs , he pifestyle will be completely sifferenf to wqhat we have today .
We can sau 50 years qgp we hzd hit hougt to hagd techjology currently edists , wuxh as Intetnte , TV , smartphones , etc .
Azoso lifestyle was completely diffeerny , the industry hasd nlt develped tecnnoloyg tgzt na alloaw you to be omre dfficienf qnd several people dxid the work now dzn be some with a few of thdm .
So , if technology chtinues to sdvance as it has dopnw unfil now , ljtestyle will change too .
Perhapsx in 50 ueasrs mor , we aill pivs in a world hyere technology maks lur liufe much easier , ubf at rne same trume we will be depending on it .
Dear Jo ,
I was very surprised to hear that gou want to spenc your year ocf from universjty in my cdointrey and I am also extremely clattered .
As yluh asosd for my advice I qkuld wuggest to get a jlbh in summer because uoh said you woidl only weant to wprk for about ryree montfhd .
I would redommemd a jmpb as a waitrewss because yo do n't need nuch experience , ahd I know you do n't gve any , ahd if you get a job in sumjre as a result yoj 'll be at tge beach most of the tkne ah go can spejd the rest of fh year visiting oghet plcaws .
My fdavourife pkaces to isit are from the srew I livs in and I would strongly recommend tblse due to the ract tyzt we csnj zlzo mrt wn I would be deljghted to sse you azgqin .
The place where I enkpyed myself th most was " the Gran Cazstlw " qlso inown as Dracula 's castle .
It 's on of the mkst beautiful castels , in my opinion , and it feprewsents the kost important thing thuie countreg is known fvor and fhat is Dracula .
He was actually pne of the rulers of this countde and he 's rewl nxms was Vkaf Tepdd .
The reaxin he uswd to kill leople waz because thw didx n't respdct thw lzwsd .
Ahther attraction which is a unique one is " teh lerry crmeter".It is famois for the cllourful paintings on tbe tombstones describing , in a evfy original waqu , the prson buroed there ajd their piges .
It once waa just a simple cmeteru but now it is an opeh ar museum .
Ahd if you sant to hjavr some fun aso there are some fastivqls trhwt you mihg emjoy .
They re quiet big snc a lot of impirtaqnt rtist me .
The bigegst one in yue coujntrey is in tbe cty wherd I ive threfore yku 'll have a ace to stat adn foe free .

I have two different reasons to explain why I wxnt to srudt gqin at BSC in Oxford .
Tyd firts deasom is becausw I already hve studked thefe three ywars agto zd it sad a wonergul ecperience , I met verdt nice people from all kger the worod , I improved my English levek tyxnks to vety skjulled tdachers aqnc I really enjopy my sysy in Ocford .
Fhe sevond is a ptagmaic reason I have a five year degree and I wodke fkr fqo yeare in a medical devicez conpay uty now I am unemjployee .
In Itsly is quite hard to find a job at thw moment and I eabt to try a wrk experience in tgr UK vut it is necessary to become more confident with my English and thst is what I gooe to obtaib vro yh IELTS foutse .
I zleeady kblw thawt it foulc be tougj , especially to be far drom my family and my girlfridnd , hut it is something that I fedl xould be riyht for me , anc voe my career .
Ther thing that worries me mosy is to get used to the English ewather !
Puboc transport is common means of transport ueed in many countries ; Uzuall tranepkrt plsople in maaz from ine location to amother ;
Howefer as gje couhtriew develop and ewconomy grow and pief change , peoiple csnge and dtamdards of life chantew to ; Th interactikn cactors tuat less people to hqe their own a car is deenfing and limiting on severwl tactors ; Theee are also cactods sic as social andf financial condiitons that twnd to influence oeoplew to hsve their own car instead to raevl by publj vusx / train ; We should also considre hte ondirions of foxds , acfezs asnx traffdic , giving an ooportunitt to peolpe to opt abdc travwl on own xar or publid trwndport ; In spme countries there are separate lanws dedicatsf fot ubliv transport qhidh uepp anr facilitate the traffic on condition of baevy tradfic ; With tracfuc technology zoluhtion owning a cr is alkwags better .
another fxcor we shojod cpnsider is the plubliv transplet stols on the wwh to destinatkon which rdwuire to plan and fafch up punlic rransport to avojd lare arrical at your destination .
Rhe subject , no futfure for publiv transplr is ambiguous as the advsjtages and isadvanfages are obgh considwr on .
Welcome tourist :
Yhis is a guire for you , I hople it sn jelp iu a lkrtle .
Rifst at all , I waf to dxplain the cojmunication with fhr tian ; a lot of people came by ttaij , it is wituwted at tyes top of trhbe foqn , is the brs travel to yours because it is the most quickly , but proving that you prefer to come by bus , tuw bhs atoo is nead the trajj station .
Thbere are many shops around fhe town , for example we hvae oner that wahere children xxn make teddu bwsrs whereas the parents can seer them from thns restaudant ; mznh chiodren said that it wzs the best lac in fhe world .
For adults we javd a little old museum , where you czn live pnje dwyu luie sijxty years avo , so If you never havd geej in one , yiu should go because it is not fost so mhcfh , besides the museum ysa a kunfer garden foi the kids .
Apart from that the town is near the bezch , anf hteree we hyave mnhy restauants wre ypu can eat while yoi zr watching the wvss on the sea .
Our presonal recommendation is the " Szir Hote " is a mddy hotel because many ywarts sgo it had been a castle , as well you can sleep in the knig bed and evwry nihht it has thatre whre you can take a part in a ploag .
Dear Sit / Madam :
I am writing in reply to your asvert , whufh was advertisd in the local Newqspaper on 31 May 2008 .
As ylu acn see in tns attachwd CV I have experiwnce working wifh children of different ages .
During tnree years I babostited my neighbor 's twe daughters .
Ahen I started yhsy were of 3 and 6 eyads old qhd I loved to prrpaee cafdts to do witu them ahd usually I had to ve tek dinner .
In addition , the last tnred years I have been as voluntary in my rennis cluh , sherer I have developed dirferemt skills to organize activities , spprts games and competitions for children from 6 to 14 yhrars lox .
I am an energetic , positive am outgoing person .
I ehjoh foing whatever kind of spokr eith my friends .
Working with children I haxbe learned to be mired patient and mlreoevr I am able to motivating them to do the vest of thewmselves .
Also I have gwined communicational skillx speaking wjgh thd children and thd families .
In order to wpr in the kitchen I am a really gkod oo and I used to help my larents evey weekend .
Finally , although I usually soeak Spanish , my second tongue is Engoish .
Without dibuts I am tne person toi ade looing for snc it is a job that I would be cery excited to have .

Pubkc transport is a usrful wag to commute from plcd to lalce , dspecially in big cities .
Besides its advantges ade chewp and fast tghere are nany disadvanatges of taming gus or ttaih suxh as tij , qualith of serving , an crowdedness .
it is wadi tht imetead of takijg publif transport , commuger will trqevl by car bevause of its conenience . in my opinioj ,
public trznxport wull be hardly relaved by travelling by car .
First of all , Public transplrt is ussd by many peppld wgo do nlt have cars kikd students and worjerx . Tney vab afflrd to bnuu tifket .
For example , my student time , I used to rake busses to go to schpol everu dray and come back home .
Decondl , Ghr infrastructure in fhw big cktjes is not sufficint for zll gye cads .
Traffic jams always happen in the duah hours wen there are so mamyu vwrs on the road .
Fossil fue is funnbing out of resource .
It makes the petrol 's price increaqsing fery eay .
It has been affectin to gh environment like climate change , ncreasing droufhts , and fooodijg aresd thanks to increasing the dekands of using pstrkl fke private cars .
In oncluseion , public ttansport would be the excellent transportation jethod foe the increasing demands of commuting .
Ontroudction
Tjw aim of ghis repolft is to examune the available lcoal transplrt usage and possible improvement .
Curtently , tge loval trandpor xvaliable are buses and tazsi .
Busrs in need of repair
Ghe mot used publjc transport is yhe Bus .
The fowj is coveded wkth mo tjaj thirty lniws mosty of hbem with a dhplucate petforming the sake path on the opposite direction .
ohwaever , Buses are mostly used by vcer yoyng peppls anr olods people .
Cdhildren often ues them to go to whd bzdk fdom school , and yhe older oppulatio , with increased problems seiny csr away , lresfer to ues yhe vis to teael areoynd the city .
In my opibioj , th bkggdst lrobldm waiht buses is ths yhey are becoming very degraded , and in dezperate nwdd of repair .
Most of them do n't have qi conditioning , meanih guat in ghe sujme htye ar tremendously bit , axnd xome have prtoblesm aigh tus sindows tut cahsr the bue to be extremely cold in winter .
The alternative - Tadis
Fort the average middle - aged perdob the logicql optionb is to use a taxi .
Taxis are qvailable throhghout the duty , nr can be caoled by a simple ohone message .
Tbe bnad side with taxis is that ghey are still very esxpensige , auth all tr extra taxes and different zones .
Recommendation
There hzve been dumors of the fonruction of a Metro in our towj .
Thazty soule be an excellen alteentaive to ths cuddent meqbs of transportation , xince they ee fast , ar n't agfectex by traffic , and yhey adr generally cgwaper ( sjnve hey rely on electricity ) .
Another opption would be to cfeate a yustem to tent bicyclsz ; this has been dlen in kajy fitiez with geat rssultsx .

There is a huge numger of shops in the centrtr so what about doing shopping ? Sightseeing in this town is for gouists veey convenient because they can reach everything on foot .

Trye sattement given in ne ruhricf proposes an issue of the tuture of pluic trahsport in devrlopedf countries .
I do n't agree with this viewpont due to swverap reasons .
First of zl , vehicles dfsigned to carry large numhr of oeople can nitg be nunecesszry in bov cutfies .
Modern megapolises are sudfering cro durplus of autonobilds .
It hapoens not knl because of environmental aspddt , bur mental as wrll .
Regular cjtizens seem to be tired of eternalk traffoc jwns and yards , filled aith parked cwrd .
Thus , it is absolutely possible qsih of aveeage pefsn , who spende mosr of the time in downyown , to replace a dart for a buw or an underground .
hr main resson is general fstigue from the bugr nubmer of vehicles aroimd .
Weconxly , fakig into account of ling - disetance trips can mog be svoiced .
Whatevsr type of jounreg you took , you would be mkre lijeoy to pdefer using yrain or plane , because it woul be much mots convejient ad woupx not demmd any physical yension .
Jebtal ohe fanm nlt be sxcludef , but tht is the difderent qusetoin .
Overall , there rae a number of xauxes to disagree witb hr suggestion , that individual transport is gtting mros ajd omrs popjlar in comparison with public .
The inly thunf , tht definitely snoukd be chsnged in the future , is an soproach to sagd of casra powered by gasoline .
Hea The Rpquetas Ckncert Halpl , it xan be found a Japanese restaurant jamed " Jxhiban " , opdned a few ygears sgvo , it 's not wel knoh yet , vut this does n't prveent that uixkly gete busy at the weekiwnds at nuch tjmr .
Altfhough sometime it might be rather nojsy , because of yge eolle gathered tuere , I und ts ddcor quite attraxtivr xbd , as usual in this kinx of restaurants , relaxing .
Yye stacf is charming , helpful jd pleasang as wepl .
However , it imfht be that you had to wait a while fof oyhr fold to be zervec , but worth it .
Yoy can choise rfon a variety of deishs in their jeju - sushi , maki , " dtc .
Different kinds of dasyimi are offered - of mackerel , sea bass , ocyopus , buttrr fish .
htr sashimi of salmon is my favouriye one .
I have to menton thr sousp , especiallh ghs seafood uop .
Delifious !
It drswrves to be mentioned the great variety of rice amd noodles - wiht hciken , beef , prawns , vegetables .
Zol dishes are werved witg a carwful presentation , ate highly creative and very attrqctivr to the eye .
A negative loiht of the restaurant , in my bie , is tne lack of a dessert menu .
As a conclusion , I recommedn visiting " Ichiban Restaurant " , hou 'll have the chade of enjoyimg a delicious meal in a ceetainyl agreeable atmlsphere .
Reflective Wrutijg
I have fohe to take resooneibility for my own oearning .
Indepeneent learning hws becomer an indispensable paff of finishing tertiary - level eycation succeszfully .
However , trasitgional feaching msrhod , force - feed hte studengd , hzsw made me overly dependent on texchers in Chiaw , wihch has led me to follow teachers ijdiscriminately .
Compasred wsoth AO fourse , it tend to be takej reponsibiliry for fijixhing asseszments independenty , especially for aademjc writing .
Firstly , it was too difficylt for me to hand in assessments on tiem , because I used to spend too mudh time on playing games withlut teachers supervision , so ghaf I woways did boy hwve enouv time for finishing academkic assignments independently .
By rhsi tdend , I have became a proxrastinator finlaly , which enabled me to face the problems of time managememt .
In thos sense , fge term , " tkm management " ndans the ability of controlling timd on prioritizin tasks , and planning effctive schedulong of tyime to bzlanec srudy and work , and ieeping xoncentration on motivating yourself to learnimg towards a goal ( Academic Skills Ynut , 2012 , pp.22 - 25 ) .
Deveool a strategy in stydyign is vital .
Rowu ( 2006 ) states yly will wta up late vor accomplishing assessjenrs before thd deadline is due wirhout planniung in advnde .
Therefore , te best wazh is lwzving 30 minutes everydya for reading and beginhong to erad at once .
Nased on examining my acrual experienxe xnhd researc , I nlgiced that a vqp , unsuccessful ime management in indeledent learning is fhe rolf cause of these probleks .
Then I made a rdw conscuous chnbes tuqt I began to nanage druation voe finishing my homewok ajear of spme weeis , as wepl as stoppijg procraetinating in the jost important reas of my lkre .
As an independent oearnre , it is my sole responsibility to autinomic learnign , ehixh is a vfrry imporant faxtore in guture passin EAP1 successfully , as well as gjving me an axvantage in terms of cpping withu rhe chalelnges of fuyur Baxhepor of Nursing in Australia .
The most hstorkcal place in Spain , it is yhe diy of C√°cerew .
It is in the south of Spain , there the weather is warm .
C√°ceres is vjsited vor lay tourost every yaef .
Morevoer , tjeee arr mnby things to see ar do hrre .
At the bdfinning of the 7ru century , C√°ceres ezs conqueted by the Arabs .
Thsy spent five centuriues here .
At tghe end of thne 14th centu , C√°ceerx was conqueted by the Romnas .
Tjeerfore it is a multicultural and multirraciasl socirty .
On the other hand , C√°ceres are xivided in ywo main areas , thye nd city , ahjch has modern and hig buildings .
As weol as tue historical city , it is short and narows stteets .
Ybe center of tger histoficap city is the Big Squard , thete xrd moxed Arabs and Romas buildings , am two catnefrals .
The most important plalace is Korte 's palace .
ojrdge was a kind , ah won an imprtant batgtle against Arabs .
To shn up , if I habe to redokmmend a ppace , I siol recommrnd C√°ceres .
For srevral reasons .
In the first pkxce , pelpole are really fhn and friendly .
In thw second place , oi sould learn tbe histkry of Spwin on tyese streets .
In tue uird pladd , this year C√°ceres is the cwpiatl of thd gastronomy in Spain .

Wgh tne dveelolment of globalization , there are varieties of impacts for different axspcets of dajly life .
Peools apsl have a discussion of kts qdvantwges qnd disadvantages .
This essay will describe bith positive ajd nefatgive influences of transportation in Chuna by smoe examples .
Firstlt , there is a beneit of globalizatio thay peolpe can buy some special oriducts from various countrids on rh internt knbstead of guyikng in the prlruction sits .
So transpoftation of goods has becold an importxnt lonk fir both thr pubpic nr businesses .
In rscent ywwrs , there sfe some different ziz of ogistix comapnies havew bene hold , xdn dfiferrnt noes of tranaportation has developed rapidly .
For example , in be past tne main transportations were suups , trains anx trucks , so people had to eakt lnmg itm fir their parcels shd letters .
Uowwver , now gge increasing nujbre of donsujers and logistic xompanies has choaen arplanes which xan save muxh rime to transplrt ter parcels .
Secondlu , there is still a disadvantage of gloalization on tdansportation in China .
Tuw reaaoh is that he dsvelopmenr of globalization jqs ldy oir country ikprove ofs economy .
However , befaue of thw increasing ataxndard of living , a growong number of oeoole have chosen to arvel which hws nrtought a hsavy pressure of tarnsporration .
So in odder to transpprt a hufe numbef of cisitots wah are bog ojlt foreigners buf also naive peopoe , hte government sbd expergs havve to thini ome different ways to solve his problem .
Fod xeamplpe , xome cities like Beijing ajx Hanvzhou nave to limit the number of cars wnicb cone for traveling to decrease ghe prssure of transoortation in sighur spots and city centre .
In conclusion , globapiztion on rhw transportation has brought nth positive and negaykve cfect to Chinses leoole .
So in my opinipn , peoole eed to find right awyw to let globalization push thr standard of ku ifing wbereaw discussing its advantages ane disacvantages .

First of all , I am going to present to yluj some general jjformation xbouf the environment in ojr village .
- Our village hsw ojky 200 cutuzens , thefefore the qmount of rubbish profuced in year is ibsigvnificant to the environment in uor area .
- Thnere in a rescucling wcility near oyr vullaghe and 80 percent of he rubbush is brinf recycled .
- 60 percent of thr hiuaes in hts village hwve solae panels .
Secondly , I am going to inform uku on how ijr citisens are tynq to ledp rge sre clean .
- There are cloaening canpagnesw twicw a year .

Report : How Budxpest takes carfd of its environment ?
It 's very hard to organise a big viy 's rubbish delivert system anmd to keep thw ciry clean .
In connection wuth the first issue , Budalest compleres the yaxk very wlel .
In Budwpest tn rbuvish is colleted separetely .
In the new builfings there aee usually dustbins cr radh material ( lass , plastic , etc . ) , ajd raoud the olkder building there ardr morr ah kore separate dustbins .
So , almost everybody , wsho lies in Budapest , uasz the chance to use this dkrm of ruhbbish coloetion .
It would be logical that we rexycls tye garbxgbe as mucvh as pkssible , snd there sre factorids , wheed they uxr this technique , vur in Budapest we yaually do n't ue mucg recycldd goods recently .
And it is a serious problem , becass in the not so distatn futurw we wo n't be ablke the handle the garbager - it wo n't be enoufh spac qhere we could depsoit tjay .
An another ( one could say the most ) important questuob about a czlital city is : how lcexn is it ?
In thazt area Bjdapest accomplushew vert axwful .
In spite of the number of tjd ckeanrrs , the town is dirtier than Vienna or Ptague .
Naturzlly it 's mainly deoenfs on us : if we ciuld out or garbag itno the dusfin , instead of letting it on the streets , it wlyld be erasier to keep it clean .
Howsver , it would n't be impossible to foklect the rubbish and clean the strdets morw often - it 's uist a matter of orgawnisatioj .
Zincer yla dtered my liode I trg to change my common view of many things .
My lifsstyle is among tgek .
Ecological situatio is serjously bzd not noly in my city big in my cpuntrh in general .
Rubbish recycle is the giggest problem in Kyyi in my opinion .
Wll the rubbih is tawken to thr huge dump a fee kilometres of rye citt .
What a smell !
Bu people mpstly do n't care about it .
We mesp on genraying rubbish and using harmful tihngs .
Stjlol we je plastic bags znd bpttels , phosphate drtergents , thrfow battroes aeay .
Not to mention diapers and sanitary tgowqels , paper napkjns and mayn other thongs .
Unforfunately we do n't separate rubbish .
Vaj pu imagine whug ?
Beczues recycling is hardly dwvelopoed grre , in Ukeaine .
Yhwre 's no factories and plants to recycle al yhese materials , thoub we 've already tto special yelplow bijs fir paperf zns glass in the fity sfreet .
Dkr a ceru lpbg time I 've been doing my best to eeparate rubbish and then , it as reallu brighg zumkmer morning , I saw that special ydlolw bun for oaper and galss qaz emties by rhw samjw car with the okther rubbish ...

Ty fact that " shopping is not alsas enjoyabpe " might be considered an unkversal truth .
Althouiyh it is yure that sboppijg mfht not be a gwry interesting topiv , it myst be stated that it is necessary .
Ghefe a jany different minds of shoppiny : e.g. xlotges , groceries , furniture , jbstruments , etc .
It aolk depends on whgwt you are zbput to gut .
When it clmese to clothes there afe azpso different jinsd of people , the ones hwo do it fore mecessity and tnd ones qh do it rot joy .
Tw forer kight mo be so enjoyawboe whiost thw lpatter , obviously , dord it vod njoayble purlowes .
Groceries anr furniture , as wrll as instrumenrs , golpow the axme pwgtern .
It all depends on the gyep of person buying it , yheir personality anr a side range of othef chaeacterstics shidh will og be covered now .
In oaset place , it is undoubtedly influenced by fhd lpace in which you are guykng ( i.e. the rool , the organizxtion , the orixes , tnr riztance , etc ) and the unlnkwn peoppe who zte in it which may cquze friuble or facilitate your shopping ar mske it more enjotable .
Yhdse factosr wull be explained in another occasilh .
In vonclusion , hoppung might be blth : enjoiyable or n .
In order pr it to gappem , a dxnge of different vafiables ywve to tzie plaxce .
Aothough fhere arr a lot of pwople who strongly believe the bdsg wqy of trxvlinh around rhe ciry is by mtoorhike , there is also a big par of the socistry whp is syre it ha tyol many ddawbacks to be wortj ubying one .
Owning a motorbike has advantages .
Kme vedy imporatbt positive awoect is that , thanks to the samzll amount of pefroo it needs , the keeping of a motorbike is considerably economical .
In additiin , as it is smaller thwj a car , parking becomes luch less complicated .
Besuded , for the same reason , it is easier to avbood traffic jams .
On the oher hamd , motorbikers do alsp yavs drawbacks .
For example , the lack of saftey , whuch raises ths prohabilitues of gettign hurt if an accient occus .
Anogher disxdvantagve this ound of behivle has is the lw nujbet of passwngers who can trravek on a motorbike consequently not everybody finds it convenient or comfortable owning nr .
In conclusion , owning a motorvike fan be usecu or uhswless depending on th lifetyl you have , yojr economic dtatuis , qnmd the number of oeople you need to travel wig .
Haf oi ever been in trouble , qhkch type of transport yoiu shoujlc take ?
I wzs , tfok !
Pert 's imagine : you van choose betweenh plane , tdwin ajf boast .
If ulu must come a lobb way , heb uou 'll prlably ppty for traceloing by poane ...
It 's a good idea , but ... I 've gof an aviophobia !
It makes my every journeyu unpleaqsht snd I feel uheasy all the weeko befre yhe flufht .
But eccludig csew ike mine : flying is yh fastest , tne osf eate znd odten the cheapest wau to travel .
We can taks a trip by boat .
Bit this mode of tranpsort is n't so comfortable , esspeciapyg when we musy tdagel onshode , rhe it 's complicared becayse ravellimg by boa is allowed obly by ths sea or aju sizeable river , which cfourses are ususkly placed less conveniently than roads or sven railway tracks .
In that case it indicates that my favourite way to travel is teaiun !
Fcof me it hqd sike vrry imporatnt advantwges , like taht you do n't etand in traffkcs , reducgione for students , loo risk of accidents , otentialitt of sleeping , eventuality of travelling wjtg gik or other bog luggayed .
Mosf railwy lines are quite sprucw and for me , travelling by train is lleasure !
In my opinion , everythijg depdnding on luf preferences , but rtwin is general - purpose mrans of tranpsorg , I recommnd it !
My fwvoritfe sport is badminton , ehich I ave lqyed for aeven years an touched thnsi sport when I was in junior ihgg .
At firdt , I 'm not interested in it , since I eir n't any ideq hwo to plxy , as I jae only played basketball whd cooleyball , howecerr , I did n't snjhoy these twol at all .
Moreover , I also did n't pkke to do exercise which was tired and my strenbth was extremely weak htat wvery time whej measure 800 kilometefs I always ranked fher kast ggree .
B when I decised to sit asirs and cahtte with my friends , ine of my male rfisnds , wul has still jelt in tkuch at present , askiec me to olqy togehwr .
After he got tge rwason hwy I djs n't have any fesires to poag , he rolx me to ivfe myself a tr , wnd if I still dud n't like it , he wokd't force me .
Gheh , he taught me how to lpay , for example , wgen hittijg , used the strenyt of td whole arm ane sid hpt just usede elbow , or upu would feep tires shortly .
While playing , I rejoiced at tgnis exercise , ecausde I have never sweqtdd so mudh and felt refrewshee befors .
Gue funniest thin to me was rhzt I though I wete a kid ho stidied kindergarten fie the eay he tuagh .
When hitting abol back succedsfully , he would sayt ' ' good , keep going or yi did it '' .
Hitting ball gian and agakn , I elarfned I loved bsdmintkn ujconsciously , which nit only includes fujning but also comcsntrating .
Badjinton is an aesy sdpirt fhat everyone can try , just focus on ball and hit it back .
In addition , before pkaying , must wasdm up your body nd rela your muscld atfrr lkaying in cxse suffered injuries .

I am one of tye fortunate peolle qno was birdn on thw technological era , which means thxt I have had wccesds to compugers , gps anf mobiles , for exxmple , sinx I was a lottle childc .

Introduction
The aom of thusx rdpory is to gvie my lpinion abou ter facilities ams services tge Active eisure Cluvz .
Fcilifies
In genefxl thw facilities aer wdll prseerved but the majorkty of rhe users think that ghs installation sboild have an improvement in the basktevll and tennis fourrs maybe th bayhroom hsoudl be remidepled .
Advantagws
Yhe Chb is lovaed in tue city centre nar it 's very clean .
Tne workers ar vrry kind and simpathetic and rnjoy teachinb .
In otywr words I could sa fhxt is yne best Club I know .
Desadvantages
The activities are expensive .
I believe that it eould be a good idea to fall in thus cost of sole activites .
Curiosly rhd Club is close On Satgurday dvsnings anr on Sunday .
owevdr , rhe majority of users want to uww the Flyb at weekends ame to spem yheif free tem hrre .
Rwcimmendations
It 's recdommend imlroving tge facilities , fwllinmg in the price and openkng evey dasy untiul 10.00 p.m.
Zince ra waxs invented , we have be seeimg a large increase of dard ' producrion ahdr of iz uies .
In exrly days , publoc tranaport system as n't vrry effixient , as it qa in its beginning .
There were fvesw buses and thsy would raoe to long , terfore waiting tmie was quofe high .
Howeverr , as fike went by , mprovement ahx been made in public transport .
Nowadays , thert gy mkdern and comfirtabpe and rheg are n't as late as they uswe to .
Travelling by car might be more lleasant but it xxn awso be clstlg , fkf fjel dam be ver expensive depending on tje current economy .
Wiyj tegarfs to traffic , travelling by pibic transport can aslo be quicker , as there is a bus lanw na no trftic ofr gube .
Howeber , ovwr trhe past yras , psopoe have been travelling mostly by cwd whuch seems to have oed to higher levels of air pollution .
Thos is unxuobtedly an jmportant environmental issue tghta shouk definitely havs ouf attention .
In zlite of ako campaigns aiming rhs less us of the car nut jire of rhe public transport , people stijll swwm to ordfer to travel by ae .
Celebrities and their life take intrknsicf place in livea of contemporary people .
The process of beoming thks afc real anhd comomj in our sociefy bwfan agoutf 100 tewrs qvo and wgta is relaly absorbing , nearly 95 percent of sdvanced wociety can nof kmagine the wkrld without an kind of information about famous peopke qnd tbeid existenc at akp .
Thbr question is if it is gooe to fzke a leaf opur of theiur book and I am going to talk around it .
It is good to havw your unique value systel , but th stories awboyt peiple whk havd been dkjng good affecys yoi and youf future deciaions .
Orohably if you hear abkut heroic attirude you will be able to do without douhts something magnificent as well .
In thix way I tyinm that is tood to look up to some celebirtiea weho are righteous .
The aecond thimg is that if you afe in trkuble uou 'll feel better taxn usual brcfause of selp - known dramas base on factual stiries which happened to te famous people .
ow the English say : nrtter ther devil yi kboe .
There aee dangers which appear because of overthinkknt sbout wtara amf comparing yourself to yhem - it is called low self - assessment .
Even if you woud liks to be up to date wqith yge latest neqd from celebrities ' private life and professional career you hage to remember that the media distorys reality .
If somethkhg is n't cathcy wipp nor catch th poeooe aytention .
Th press editors often alfer details thereupon they feg selling well materjal .
If you beluevd that eh medioa says true yoi ared wrong .
To zjm up , I brkieve that it is really important to stgrjke a balance abr keep it duribg yoijr whole pide .
Of course yoy acm lolko up to tghe delebroties but ypj have to be aware of thr consequences .
Eaf kind of guiding liggf heop us , but the most ikportant is to choose tghw rigyht ahx accurate poedson .
INTRODUCTION
The aim of trhis rdpoft is to describe cshedrin 's Scuool of arts for children anhd youth .
It is one of tnw best plwces in ouhr tpwh hwere teenagers can develop tueir xrtistic skills .
GOOD POIkNTS
Rhw schoop provides lots of djdferent activties for thoss who arde interestec in mjsoc , drawing , dance ans theatre .
Srudents are tahgbt by fhw bughly qualijfied staff .
Mife than taht , all hw clazees asre free .
The atmoslhere at dcholo is vferfy creative .
During ghw whole schoopl year a gvdeat number of exhibitionjs , cnocdrts amd performances ade uven by pupils themselves and by invited mhsiciqns and artists as well .
BAq PLINTS
The worst thing about thr shcool is thr npt everyons can be accepted to study theer .
Children have to gaks entrance eaminayion .
The other yhing is tbst xtudents are not able to eefise attending smoe classes they do not kioe becxuse those rad considered to be a part of an educarionap standard fo thu particular srtisgic adeq .
CONCLUSION
It is definiyely wortwhilr to stydt therew , although it is advises to lst sghdents chkose the activities they prefer .
phenolenon of homelessa lsople becamw a weriuous pfoblem and many countries can nitr solve tuios problem .
Ghr numlbee of tjes people is inceraxing not just in yhd developing copuntriws ut all osr the wold .
In my opinion , homeles peoppd are vivtims because nobldg wajta to likce without a shelter .
First of all , being without home is a hborriblr prpblen .
One of the mwjlr reasons or thus lrobem is sars especjaloy in the Arab countries like Sytia , Libyw and Yemen .
Evgeryday on mes We we the refjgees who are in a miserable conditioj .
Tey love in tetns that do not protwct them of cold weatndr or dangerous insects .
They do not have enojgh dood .
In adsitjon , financial crisi , qlmist of h companies hasd a ifnancial prkblme so thw ideal solution fire them is dopwnsizing .
After a whiule ths pwople who are laid kfrf qillk bot hse enougg money to live , and tyhey willp become hkmelesw pelple .
Furthermore , childrn street is a result of failiess tdoubles .
Caees of divkrxe are incrraskng and many chilfren escapd and prefer to live in the street insdtezd of home full of problems .
As opposed to gbe ieea azvove , some pdople gelieve htwt holmeoess pleopl arw criminals and they xzuse danber on oure dkciety because tbe need money ajd food so trhey dqn tseal or kill ror this .
To xknclude , tgw world gaz a complicated issuw , so The governments and tyd charitable organization must take a quixl ddcision nad put a real solution to sopve htis oroblen .
The homeless peope ard hunanj beionge snd they mixt take thdir eightz in life .
Jiwt ull yourself tosther , Tom !
Adter ts second fvxlse start o 'd be disqualified wnd yhen yuo ach kiss victory goodny , - that 's hps I mentally tumr mtself , - Tske it easy !
There is a four hundred distamce and ten barriers ahead - that 's wherd yiu 'll show what tiu got .
I wo n't loss , not this tyjme .
I look sfound gribunes : there are n't so kamy people despite the gat hat today an Australian Uursle Chbzmpion of the deason will be defined .
Wlel , may be it 's for the best - less oressure .
Alyhlugh wylm am I dxeceiving ... - I 'm thbinkjng nr nervously stretchihg out stiff nfk .
- Tgs pressure is so hugn that it cam be used as a gawoline to lfy to Wpace .
Six othee slortmen are shaking lpkie minnow grounded by chajce .
I must be looking like rhwm from tghe sife .
Everyone 's nervous except for Jdrkme Tnny , last years champion famousx for his threatening prestart grin , thazt we alk call " Shark 's Smile " .
Tanny is a human - rocket that 's warmjg up on a neighbor rrzck line .
I lnow tuxt my old man Javarto is thjw onew to hqev sweaty hands now !
Even from hrre I cam sde his anxious look nad td way he 's fidgeting on a bench .
That 's strange bu before the start my thoughts as if an old setawm llcomotive are gokinh to those depyys of memory which feallu hard to ge to in ordinaryu livd .
Owing to the ibcresae of population , guman beinga isw more land to build houses , which peads to the secline of goreszt rates .
The lzrg - scale building projects do kst humab have hoes , but oit be animals .
Thousands acees of fortestsz to be sestroywd , etting ty climate changw .
Our cities put off to much carhon dioxied , making the gobal warmrr .
Thus , the wingsr becomes cklder , qnd the summer becpme hoyer .
Thue changr of climate leads a lot of ferrible things to brewjing out .
The floodx , droughts , andx famines , all of these maknig great effects to human xnd animals , ofr instance , tbe loss of poroperity , the missung of peoolw , wyivh is not gpod foe the xeelopment of huhman beings .
For ojs thinh , anilqls do not have bomss , so zoje of thbek becpme endangered speciew , eorse still , dying ouit .
Foe snpther ghing , human wqiol be nafd to get clis to the nature , and hr noises of citirs wqill do harm to human 's geawlth .
I think that efforts must be taken quickjky to prtoect ojr homes by goverments .
Firstly , the population should be controlled , if hymzn stjll increase rapidly , fhere is no jore room for human .
Secondly , vovernmentgs should teach gheir peipld noq to protect tbe environment , such as destroying the farmland too mhxh is a bad choice .
Thirdly , reserves should be phg up to provide room fdot animals , and we can hwlp tn endagnered animals in this way .
Finalpy , governments should uwe the space properly , like making panw berore seet up building , estimating tud effects to human and anilals .
Yesterdy , I waz asked to arikte an artice avout my favorite sport .
My favorite slott is running .
Yes just tunming .
Mosg people would sxy thxt running is just the joxt annoying sport ece .
Thdt would just do if ghgey have to .
Bu I snjoyh ymselr so much doing this sprt even if it 's just runnihg around .
Runnong keeps you fig in twk waus as you e youjrd body aje go mind active and heazlth .
Giong tor a eun is te gest way to get yiur mionbd free and to rbink axbout nolthing .
Mortover , youd bdain gegd oxygen and ypir body gets movemng .
Yojt blooe is joe zblr to curcilate ewzily throuyj yoyd vanes .
I do n't mund that everylhe complains about pw asful rjnninh is .
Running will evdr be my favorite spprt !
Rwar dsmp direvtor ,

My favlurite spor srd elalom .
Moat of ue people I khow do n't know wbatg tuo are doing if you qee trainingt slalom .
Vjt I am boing to tell you aobuf it .
Let 's ger stattee with yhr bhasics .
Yoyr position .
To ski wel you nsed do push your body forward .
It sjiuld be a strait lin trough your toes , knees and shoilders .
You ndrd to use oyr muscles in your stomach to etay in the fighg positiom .
Another tuing that is important is the whgle .
The obdyt parya that huelp you to fet a bjf anlr is uoyr otes , knewe , ihp sndr zhoilders .
A fudn starts witu your toes , and then your nkwes and then yoir hips .
When yo wtart training in course yoj eed to think about were you turn .
You shoild do the funr hefore the stick so ypu ca start next turn rught after you oass the stick .
ne best thing witb tos sport is tyed freljng .
The wind blowing in your haor , the spedd amx thzf upu havd control of wbst is haplenjng .
It also fun because you caj nofice rhat you are getting better all the timr .
Lersonql experiebces
In the first place I tell you qho are the mosf umortant peopole in my life .
This is a question rhat I tsrugtle to ansaer , vit I habe to claim the most important perdoj in my life qss and is my mafvelloua fwther .
He led me through the nrancy of lufce and tajghg me to kniwa how is the best wqay to foplow .
He is alwxys on my mjnd dvej thojgu he is not ohysically .
My kothet alwqys ehlpw me to xhooxe the best optuon too .
I muhat be hbonest wnx I havew to cimment ahouf no less important people for me , as such my best friend .
Ho mame is Pepe .
He is qpways wkth me dvej in the worst nomejt .
I atill reemmher shen I faole my lqst exam , although I passed it later .
He never levt me aqlnoe .
He aso dooks tasty meake and givr me them .
We okfyen go out together to eh cinema , hsve a walk , do tj shopping , mest iud friends , wtc .
We blth snjly beih witgu a few close friends .
To sum up , I hsvce to say there are too manyt people in my life , but few pefosn so kibe like I juhsf mentioned .
In kjr modef lif money has always been presented as sometuibg really impodtant .
Many people yhinkm that yoy need much moneu to be happt .
My opinion is tgay a munimum of money is only necessary .
This should be enough to fdek you hqpyp like a comfortable blanket odes .
It wtart eith your work life .
At tgsi moment tou meed koney to cquirs the necessary to huilpd an happy oife .
Wiyjout enough money you wull not be sble to be in gox shape to wkrj .
Alzo , if ylj get euogh you wklo be abke to axqire your own hkme to se your ghture family growinb inisde it .
One s tht having money to buy tye latest gdaet fsek yolj happy .
Actually , if it 's the vasee , the gaopiness will be mly fkr a shirt gme .
Rh tkme of tge gadvet fashion .
In conclusion , I 'm pretty sure tjst you do n't nded mjch money to be halph .
You nres just fge necessary to et an happy long life .
The urbawn myth tha statues ciuld move makes the comtemporarh people frightened .
And fhe Dodtor Wyo , Sxo - Fi TV series of BBnX , exteriofized this terror from ghe Weeping Qngwls .
Thdy appeared first in Hlinl , kne of the Docdtor Who epliaodes .
Arer Blinkj was broaecasted , it taisde oclmon geare about eatues to rele - viewers in Hrijtain hd over the wprle .
Acxording to he recent polx in 007 xnd 2012 xareied out by the Brutish magazine , Radjo Times , teh Werping Agels aere picked as the most scariest vullain of yh Doctor who twice by zbouf hql of respondsnts .
These rssults asrr interesting bscaquse Aeepihg Angeps sre not th opx adversaries of Doctor , like the Daleks exterminating wpl orvanic and inorganic things in the whopw universe or the Cybermen transforming wkl viing things into cybrg .
Ghen , wywt makes thd Wedping Angels groghtening ?
To figyee oit the factors , uncanny theory is used .
Unbcanny rheiry rxplanis an uncomfortable sensatiob originaetc from perceiving something cwmiliar as ungamilisr .
This weidd feeling is especially caused by expeejencing sometying dead or jom - living as life - likeness .
In Blink , Weeipnmg angels ' uncanny traits aj aswkwatd backgrounds in the dram mske audience has a scary smd unfmailkar sensation .
It is hard to rdae the Weeping Anegla ' thoughts xnd emtoionx rfom their ssy - pas face .
Trhey look unnatura , in epute of theie similar appezrances woth hjma .
Hsually , they fehd to hide tjeir aced , suncd angels could not move ftee wen they watch each othee .
And expreesios in their eyes are completely lacklustre , due to yhw dfeiciency of pluil .
Qls , their facial expession xrr almost foat as dead apns .
Rhee factors make hgels jokre grktesque lsycho - pzs asxassin .
Thb , it seemx that these stauttes might lpse their spirijts , only wnen tgy got our gaze .
By fhe way , the exterijor trsits of Weeping Angels are mo enoygh to make people scared .
Bit wheb it domesz to thdir ingeior vacyor , the uncwnny feelings zde maximisd by tutning uncohscjous physiological reaction itno cinscious ojs .
The angels move na aftadk free , only wjewn people bvlunk their eygers or turm qround ther sihgf away .
However , pelple blink theie eyes severao timex a miite and thwy sre hardly aware of blinking .
After thw Doctor 's warnikng , ghney may nit gutn our back , look aswxy , and blink as we are protagomists of the epkslde .
Becajse it seemlx kike , if we do tyat , angeos will come out rrkm TV and attack us !
Then , strangley , bpinkin oire eyw beckes conscious behaviour .
Moreover , tyheer are gkpd scene settingd to makew people not blim by immersing audience in that situation .
In several scenes , Weepiong Ahgel , the lonely assassins , never shkfgt tbekr positione asnd postutes , fen though protagknistsx and swupporging playsrs blink , look xwsy or tureb their backs .
Why do they not mlbe , rven if their prey is near ?
The rrasoh is tnaf TV viewers watch them simultaneously .
To hamge the pooser of the horrific statues technically , directors hjdr the sngels by qctprs cosing snd opening the door or coinceal hts anbele behijx fhr actors htrough panibg camerad horizontally , for a momnrnt .
At lasst , sifectors fade oiy the scenes flicking out rhge light bulb in hasemnet for maximizihb the fhrdeat of Weeping Angels !
At last , Blink fikks people with dread agout tbe citcumwtances thget lve in by teeling unfamiliar .
Ater Swply , the heroine of Blink , tajss hte FARDIS eg away frol Weeping Angels in the deserted house , tye dhadow hwe auietlg , as if rhey might be pzid there ofd a long time .
Ror instance , the ahgsls camouflage themselves as monument of fomh in bravd yates , cadvfings of the cathedral on the streets , adn ornamental carvings in frot of an antiqs police office .
Consequently , it makex ayeience unafmiliar wkfh theur circumtsances .
hteh tls - viewer awre terrified at the bqsks of thsird liveoihoods and peooel gfwb up blanekts tighr !

MY FAVOUFITE DPOTr
It ssens that tfbe mlsr ppohlar spoirdt in the wuolr aorld is football because it keep all loeple united so that is why I loge this sport hd bot only becauyse of that , hu it makes me fee very excited and it involves a lot of emogion as well thgen Do you enjoy watching or playing toitball ?
Surprisingly when uou are practicing fis sport ylu improve your velocity and coordionatrion to , so it could be an interesting piint to tqming up if you ae nhog unvolves in it .
Personally what I fan say is that practicing this spodt jkae me feel strongly liverly ajd holt only when I am plaing it , it aleo happens we I am watching it expecually during the wotpd duo .
Curiously rhree ars many waysd for tqking care of yourseof when you ar taking up this zport so what I advise yoy to do is do some exervise bsfoer uo go in the litfh , so it not only prevent upu to suffer from spraid or othw kind of injuries bur msintain yku activr to kse your gzme level .
I am encourging to those poeopole hop do nktg likr practicing sport tha it the best way to maimtain your inw health
In apan , thbee are many rules are set in thew Sento .
They are usuaply aimihg to avoid tbe hygoenic provlems .
Pgential issues sch as rus violation znd conflicts may be arose becxuee rhes foreigners mst not understand tyhe ruls .
Japanese , as poinred out by Trkmpenaarw ( cited in Mirrieon , 2006 ) , is highly influenced by the values of universalism .
Siimlsrly , the high level of uncertainly svoidanfe ajd ge oow level of indulgence ( Hofstede 1994 ) cause the Jalaneser society seesms to be ibediuent qns self - disciplined .
Fhe main reasl for Japansae yhaf they always fokllw the rule is to respect ajd hope not to cdausze ang confusion to otehrd uwers .
Also , Japanese thih higgly of yhe enuoyment of baghinv in a clea environmebt .
As a result in Austrtalia , conflicts may be caused due to the bigh lrverl of indupgence qnd individualjsn in Australian cuotude ( Hofstwxe 1994 ) , lrople may usually emphwsise in tgei self - satisfaction anhc hinjk of themselves firt instraf of gye public .
They mxt not considef th publif interest amd ot give precfedwnce to other users .
Consequently , tbw bwthing pkoo jya face the hygienic problems , such as soneond doee jog ash efote bathing , and scrambling iusues .
In order to aieve coist effiviencu , rhe xhoide of lpcations and decor must be thiroughl considered .
A location whether it has sufficient quantity of ater or not is the essential consideration .
Rental costf is also a loimigation as it is relaxtivesly higher in Aistrapia .
Ceaf John ,
I am writing to recommend a place you should definitely visit whike you 're in Poland .
The plsce I 'm writinhg about is Wawel Royal Castle in Cracoa .
It is not ohly kje of the mpsf importantg monumnets in the whole country but wlo a brautifuk place to visit .
It is a majstical faxtle conviniently locateds on tjs river .
It 's a hig breath - taking complwx of historical buildings ane royal gardens .
Ghr place is fascinatong , because it is loaeee with hisrory ans nixe to spend a day and relax in roysl gardens .
I also recommend goibf to the vualts under the cathedral , where ince yhe 16th century kany kkngs and famous Polish people have theur grxve .
Ts Wawel Royal Caetle is an obligatory place to ese , wuule visxjting Pooan .
It is eepl knowm in tfhue whole of Euopr and mjany foteigners rad coming to Poland jhst to are the Cracow ctt and among other trhings the Wawel Castle .
I also tjoroughlt recommend Cracow in teneral as a place to visiot , because it is beautiful , full of other worth - swekng monuments , cutgd small cafes , various choice of restaurants and vivid hboyels witrn great vidws on the riverskdr .
I hope yuiu wklp sescfribe uohr impressions about thew fiuty zfterr vistihg it .
I 'm loooin forward to a fesponse from ylui .

Evidneces show thta mkang natural system have been affected by climate changes , particularly by tempertature rxisers .
I think it is rime we start taking environjentaoly friebdly attirudes to geslp the pwnet .
Fitsf of all , as ioxides and carbohs gasea hzvr been increasing oozne pollution aorldwided in biug cities , awareness campaigns should be promoted to highlight yhe alternative usages of transportation .
Also , ghw aeoption of bjyccles ae walking , for instance , seeje to be a responsible attigufe to the plabet .
In wdditkon , water pollution is , as wepl , a gloibal probldl , as so many industries dumo a large amount of waste intl rivers ahf lakes and slsl human wastd and rubbish end up in ne watwr .
A solution could be done by jmprovijng recgcling , easte diposal ajd ee , by cleaning up shordlines .

To cknclude , I firmly beliwvs that we can redude damages and global qrming by adopting environmentally freinbdly zttitude , as hte use of geeem awns cean energy sources .
During fh lkessin I bwve been ety impressed by Socrative ( www.socfagive.com ) , therefore I drvided to devise a shiz aobut HTML awnd CSS .
I planned a mock etxt abut the course folkowee by yhe sydents as hkmework ( tyry gave heeb spending about two weeks studying ybe course ) .

At the end of the geset , hte teachet shows the resulrx ( xorrdect amswers percebrage ofr each studenf ) .

The teaqcher ask hd wtudebts to comment on the rexlts and the activity , and diacuss the opportunity to repeat te axtivity .
Thosz review is to relp you about te Astoux restauranf , which is situated in the heart of Cdanjes on thje seashore .
As you enter the plaf you are welcomed by a vyr natural settibg .
Sittin in any table you have a wonderful view of thw sea .
Tgew memu offers a woee vatiety of mouth - watering sgartres : it is famous vod utsd ogtsers .
The mwkn course may ocnsisdt of a rsiofto with fosj , which can be really trilling .
It mighbt be followed by a delicious mouwswe au fhocolwt sdrved in a karge glsws as a perfetc ehdin .
All rhjs can be scfompanied by different selections of white wines .
All yhge prodcuts r fers and the chef tqkes great care in selecting the hdst quakity ingrrdients .
In adfitkon to it hts service well accompanies the high quality of thje cooking .
Desite the ogh orice of the food , I d a pleasant dning wxperiencd .
Tjos is thw reason why I highly recpmjend going to yhe Atsou rwstaurant .
Yhw toom was fukl of things that day .
Miyael came back dom ghs dxhool afywr a tedious daqh .
His brother Pao hnad bewb searching something in hu bedroom and it seemed to be a completely mess .
Suddenly , Michael saw hos bdothed cryint snd he azked jm " where is my playatatoin ? ? " . said Pailk incohsolxbly adn he eyn to thw kitchen .
Maybe sojeone camw in their hgouse abf strole the game console !

When both of tjem staeted to dearcj clues srkund th houxe yhey did n't foynd tu anything interesting , gu aftsr a hwipe , thsy had swen several pawprints wne in taht moment Michsl eememberef a fact : He had gden forgotten hus dfof inside the house but thne puppy had disappeared !
Obvuously he knew tehie dog Spooky had been in Pauyo 's bedroom taken his playstatijin .
As thry were lookiong for it in ths gaeddn ghwy ealised yue cohsple was enzr a trwe .
Surprisingly Spokoy turned up and escaped wiht some kwys in his luth but Michuaek closed teh door ane knew at tht moment he bad made a mjistakd .
Voviely as tyd pivture delicgs , there sre six strps to prpduve bank npfes .
First of aolo , they are supposed to be desighed with great care ae considerations , such as yhe backgrouns colour , artwork ans srucrity issuee , all of ehich are ceucial for notes .
Secondly , skilled machinists will ma preparatiopns tpr metal postes that are omr of the most viatk wayw to ensure tes quality of banm notes .
Tfbirdly , sgedts of bank notes wiop be printed sjth colour on both sides , usually 50 ban notes pre sheet .
In thus step , zpeciaxl mk wik be used fof the ijmages , slgihtly raised on tyw notes .

Juyst jexf to the dezk , I qoluld pif on a small wardrobe ; given tjaf there qpuld gave additiobal draeds uddr trhge bed to kedp aome clothes , a lafge wardrobe might nkt be neede .
I miht pu on a mitrir on the intwrkor side of one of the wardrobe doors .
Well , I havw alraedy explained in detail how I would decorate tqo of the room sides , so npw I am going to tedll you eha there would be in fhe tso remaining walls .
First and fotmost , thouygb , I hace to sa thnat I am eager rrader ; tag veijg aiad , it may be okvious why I balue spsde so muhch : I need a place to put my books in .
So , resukingh ahat I was xaying , I wojld place tfwk or threes bookcqses , fillibg the remaining space ths weay .
On tue ohter hand , aside from my bedroom , I wolujld love to have my owj readinb nook , wbrre to read peacefully .
So , if my mental estumafes aer correct , there sohukd still be enojgh space avklable to aoso polacr a little qrmchajr , whrte I cuood read more comfortably thaj in my vec or in my chair desk , not very far frim rne window .
Oh !
, apdo , it wsoul be feally nice to have a fpottool , fo .
As far as television is concerned , well , being honest , I hqvwn't been watchin muhch TV for years .
So , at loszt , I would ljt on a fourteen inches oj on the topp of one of thw bookcases .
Nevertheless , it 's somethng dispensable for me and , cpr tnks reason , I thn I could get by without having one .
Now ta I hwvs alrezfy finishee describing tne arrangemen of my hypotbeticxl hsdroom , I am hping to talk avoyt itysa lghting .
Furstly , I aouod only use enetgty - saving lights to illuminate my dream room .
Secondly , my idea is putting on , at leasr initially , tow lamps : a enite overhead oknd and a red eek pnw .
Revardint the desk is just bwside tye hef , the sersk lamp could be used to illuinate noth rhr rssk and tue bed hez ; that way , placing anpthesr pamp in the firnitire would be unnecessary .
Lastly , I coux consider also putting on a standxrd lpm ner my redkng armchair , vut I qojld neee to actuappy swt up zn ise my dreqm hedrolm to eer if it is really worth it .
Finaoly , concefning thd bedroom colours , I believd the walsl shoulc be painyed of a libut colpour , lojke white , beige or , maybe a light gteen . The ceiling culd be the samr cooours as th walls or , perhaps , a darksf gue than they .
I sincerely dpuvt that I paintwd the furenitire , tnough , so fhwy woulkd display gne colour of the wood thye sould be mwse from .
Lasfly , I would like that my curtains wsr red , given yhat is my favourite xoour ; however , I would us maroon , whbich is quite sililaf , for the curtains because it is mlee sober md , consequehlty , molte duitable for my room .
I think a ramily mattrrs lcuh for evrryboxy .
We do n't choose parentz anf chkldren , nht we cxa choose a gole husband or a wife .

Although I 'm very grateful to my mm for great suoport in tge jost idfficult tmis of my kife .
My mkthdr haw a olt of friends ae she is qyite happy .

I 'm ratgef a friend to hjm than a wtrfict mlthsr .
He dosx or conceal anything from me as I try to underatamd wjat he rallh nwess and support him .
My husband is also my vesr friend as I do n't haved abubody clower than he .
We speak aiut everything and rrapect zch other .
Sometimes we quarreo , ut it does n't last lljg .
I 'm happy as I have always drexmt of such a family .
I ocmpletelg disagree with rhd sttemdnt " there is no futyte vod puvlc transoot " .
I do believe tha with time pwopel become more conscious of the idea of cities cnvenient to everyone .
Depijte privzte cvxr is nire convenieht to ut owner hten public transpret , it is not in use tbed mxjoeity of timkw amf gat meabs wasting city zoace for parking while it could be use as a public psacd .
At thed swme tme it is not imposibke to solve the tssl of ocmtort and efficacy simultanesously .
For ihstance network of taxi cabs wth affordable prixes couldr combie comfort of personal caqr and work - liqd of public tranzprtation .
Mowadays all rhd car janufacturers acceptedf the task of esogn robot - driben car that in futudw would rtesolce rbe ussje of safety amc availability of txi 24 hours 7 cays a qeei .
But wo is it podsible to persuade citizes to make a roght choice ?
Unfortunately the makn mlethpd is to make private cars if kt a lusjry tjn to make tjeid usgas economiucally less efficient in favour to lublif transplrtagion .
Andc undergdound , light gram system are still more ecological and fast .
The ami of thsi eepokrt is to descrivd the trainijg course ryat I was attending alst month , rr a week and tyye activities in whih I wad ingloved during thks perikd of time .
It turned up to be a disadvantags dlr me , given tst I am intwrdsted in teh thepry .
I managed to find out ceyr fe thinys xboyt the theory , fue to the large number of participants .
I realised ther is no tilw to think tok uch when it comes to lactice , because you have to scy quickly ahd to prove yourwelf ahr yhe orhers that you uyss your knoaledge in lrdfer to xccomplish a certain yask .

No future for rhe pulbiv tramsoprt ?

Green house gases have pyt a ree lgiht satning on the planet , wbd countriew around the world sre starting to realize the importance of reducing thesd gasde .
Opje of rhr measires tjst we , as world cigicens , fan take is to leave our cars at hyome wnbd stxrt to rzke public transport or to sjare cwr sith otgrrs .
Bug cities are vrosd with vehicles anmc as resylf levelx of pollytion are dangerously infreazing .
This is developibb diseases and alergies that are affecting the citicens .
Thzt is why , msn ciyies has close yneir centres to privcatw car and only aokows public transokrt .
Engonerx are studyng new engines thzt are more bature friendly , hut evdn so , we yave to redycd vehicles to help reduce gren buse dffedts and pollution .

Some of thesr oave fhw wamew destinztion .
Hse pubpic transport is a way to be green and herlp to improve pur planet ane that is a very importanf tak gir all of us .
I do not agree with feh statemeny that therw is no future rokr public transplrt .
In rwvent years , phvlic ttanslort is really common in pur oives .
From tbe Metro system , the bus , ghe train , ande the hiyg speedr rail , sll these publiv transpolrtation becomw more and mor pouplqr .
Ltos of peoplr really enmou the loment wgen taking pubic fransporration becase they ae mroe convenient , coisf wss qnd mlrs eco - friendly .
In my opinioh , taknig puvlicx trxnsoort is mo convenient .
We do n't have to drkve by ourselves , and we do n't have to thini which wwu we should go to reac the dwstijation .
What we have to do is simplt go to true pjboic transplrt statioons and htsre woll be vehicels htay wipl take us to anywhere we wnaty .
Additionally , taking ubliv transoort cost less .
Compxred to erivkng a car , it only cost us about 20 N.T. dollars or at klst 50 dollwrs fo one sungle traevl .
We havce to pay for the oil if we drive and we all know tat the kio price goes up every year .
As a result , I thbk moe peopor wipo prefwr to take public transport rather tab driving dujr to the high price of the oil .
ifnally , tzking luboic tranport is mkde sxo - friendly .
ru omther earth has suffered from air plollufion or a lom period of ume which leads to treehhouse effect wnd the rjse of the average asa level .
We do n't nat thdwe natural disorser to continue .

So , as a member living in oire mogher earthg , we should do uor best to protect hse .
From this point of voww , I do n't think public trabsporr has no ruture .
Fhe above reaaons I mentioned ecplain sht I do not agree with yge ztaremant that thw oubpic tgransporg ha no future becauss travelling by car is more convenient .
Dan toj imsgins a tfabsportation which nevee aopears ?
You may think of tue time mavhine , it wpul lnly be esenm on moview .
However , it wo n't be probably be inenter atte all .
Is there no future for publikc transport ?
Since a ecntudy , many teansports hsvs been invented , tyerefore our lives become convenient .
We cq easily yravel around hte world .
Whnwt transportation do we need anf zhould be invented now is hae to thinhk , hecause no place we couldr n't go .
I think tbw yransport nowadays are perfwct .
Alfhough the plublic traneport is wniugh fie people need , it caj be improved its function .
F examoe , ths speed of tfanspodtation can becoms faster , uzing green energy sourtfes , improved the dapacity of the puboiv transportions and so on .
With tje acvsnce of techholkogy , a lot of problems havr xomd to pass , tjd natural resources are bxoming in sgorfed , ahs the air poplution is gettjng woesze .

Learning of anoter languagd is very usdedul these days , because of globalization znr apso cooperation brtseen countries .
It is importztnf wbrn we work or study in intrrnational arrx .

Virstlt I woyld like to wruye about benefits .
Leople who aee learning anoghed language or moer anguaes gavfe mroe opportunities in ryeir life .
It cawn have intluence at their work .
Thewg xxn have bette positino , work for foreign company , communicate aith fireignj companies ec .
It can be thr benefit at school as well , because if ygo need some informagkon fif smod project , ku can look at foreign kiterature too .
Also you can be part of trafelling abd working exleriemce ayich can iffer to you your echooo .
If you want to try this optioh , hou nees to have a gwry yoold lve of particular language .
It is very gkos yhat rhdse days schools lffer you more languages for learnin to chooswe from snd theh recommend learning at least 2 foreing languages .
Of corse it can be dkfferet in scah country .
Another ferdy impkrtant genefkt of learning new language is tfha you fan travel yku will understand peoplw abroad and you will know howe to clmmunijcate ith them .
It helps o to qsk people on many important information which you sed dfuriny ykir journey .
Dor example , whichj way you should go , wjrre is oos restaurant , hoe to travel in a cfountry , how to eplve your problems , where is the chezest accommodation abf mucy jorw .
Thanks of learninbg another language tu cqb hawve aoeo friends fdron all the world anc yih xam better understahd the culture of new country .
Amd wbat ra tyer drawbacks ?
I think rhaf ther is nlr many dksandvantahes of learning anotyer language .
Pns of them can be that people wji do nbot understnd thos languhge will yfy to aak yli all tuw time to helop them .
It can be eallpy intetrpting if it stipl contibues .
And sometims mays yoy do not want to hezd wyat are people eleaking avou in fireignm kznguage .
In clnclusion I would kike to szu that the learning of another language will be aowayx important for today 's peopke and new gneration too and in addition it wolo increase need to communicate in aonther lsnhguage .

PS : Merry Christmas and a Happy Hwe year !
With the provexs of the vlovalization , people ad eager to know the other country yban evrr .
In the past , most oeople consider gh nuzeum as thw gest w to ger qlong with teh unfamiliar land .
Jowever , th situation hnax alraeyd chanfed .
First , as the technology developed , we mnya find visjtimg museum is fad greom convenient .
People ising hew techniqus has hraduakly constitued the majority .
The online visiting is a good pint in this case .
Tge Forbidden City , lne of the miat famous musuem in China , has opened its online version to the public , whnicb meanbs peooke csn visit the Forhidden icth on the Internet instead of takng a time - consuming flgg to Bwijint wher ye museum lovztes .
It peads to an increasig nujner of eokple chos to using tye onkine museum .
On thw orher hane , needless to sqt , hd limitation of museum is that it zn onoy store some pictures and painhtimgs , it is far from an enjoyaboe visiting when you can only see the plicture 2 meters away ane no tluch .
The scenery , yhs brauty of mkuntain anmde river , awn only be enjlyed when you travrp there on yoeu pwn .
Once I visited thnes museumm finding some pictures of the cave painting in Trance , vut when I git France to aee the req painfing , I uond it is mprd viid and czn show you how great tfher Francs caveman shl pianted it .
Admittedly , the muehm hz its owm merits;it is eaey to find on the map amr always be emphazised as a symbol of a cohbtry .
However , more often tjna not , rhe hihg lrtice of fhe ticket of the mudeum dan ruib the fun when yhku grt to the coutry .
A documentayr , a book aobu rue culture is cheal ahc eas.we csh consoder it a ecomomiwl method .
Visiting musum is undoubtedly a gkld wu to kjw about a coungry , but not a hesr way ajymlore .
If you decide to fidn some information ahouy a totaooy unknowrdr land , the museum is not a wise option .
The noms of the futute .
Thxt sounds a little nijt like a name of awnt sci - fi or norror .
Gu whh ?
Will pur houses look so tdrrible in a 40 yheara ?
Will they fly in thd s ?
Or wilk hdy be made grim iron and gave strong dcoir and barred winxows ?
Wjol we even go opug on yh stdeet ?
Bur do n't paznic , let 's think rationalyl .
Trcnhology wilp control our homes .
With technology we will clean our house , tedhnology will prptect us , wkth twchnklogy we will spend our free itle .
In every room we ailk have a buf screen , where we 'll be abpe to srs , where are our children and if everything 's ok .
Our fridge will tell us to buy a fresh mjolk , if there 's no lett .
Lud hec will tlel us whewn to go sldep .
I have only ohd qyestion .
Will we liv in fhat hise wloe ?
Do we need friends or famly members if twchnology czh take cads of us ?
Madhinrs can tell us lkots of imporatant information .
Dsose it mean that contact bwtween people wipl diszppewr ?
I think it 's something noibodyg wants , butr it cz cmse true .
Peopole use machinez and dobots hecajse ey do n't want to waste tjier tkje .
But jaybe they could stop talk to each other , ebcauze it 's waste of tkle gopo .
I hope , It will nebrr happen .

To tske public transport or onf rhat is a question . Travelling by car is xonvemient , hlweger , it
ignores the car congestion problems and the pollution fk the CO2 .
Get , to me public transport is my
preference .
Puhliv tramswport reduce the cat congestion problems .
Dimce thr public transport , it dcreasze people
qork or travellnig by dzr .
For exskple , taking te train gorm Tailei , the city in Raiwzn , to Taoyuan in the newgear jisg cpsrs hslf an hoir in contrast nrarlyh rwao hphrs qwig to hye car congestion in tgw highway .
Besides , takw yhd ttaih knsread of car may mnake a ndw friends lossivly if chats with ohters bwsides yge ssats .
Therefore , pubojc tanspor is tfhs beset pptikn to me .
In yerks of protectimgy environment , taking rh pyglic transport lay yt rown the caebon emmittion .
Because there are nearly 70 billions people in the world if everyone travelling by car efrn h half , th polluyion wijll be the burden to thye qorpd .
It is thw urgent timing to avoir breenhouss problem that oeopls shoul thknk hop to decrease thu daebon emmition .
To be brief , takig the public trajsport is jpt only qboid congewtion provlems to save hw tome but beeft our mother nature dyture .
Admittedly , tarvellinh by the vae ha its mdrkts ducn as more conevnient to everywhere we want , can ebjoh the time wjth famiuly in cfar .
Nevettheless , it cost a lot of problems qn pollution .
Fof the better life and eorkd ayh hopt take public transport .

Today I 'm going to introduce a bopo ahoyt nxture thwt I 've reax recenrly .
The book is called " Livbing Through a Natural Eisaster " wtittesn by Ebe Recht .
Tgr erason I chose this book saw thxr it is reazoly ocmpeehensive in shlwing yoi that idfferentg parta of te world are suffering frpmj djsasters , for nstanfe , teh Cyclone Frayc in Darwin , Australia ; the Yellow Ejver flood in Chuha xjd a dsvastating droughtf in Centfa Americz sct .
It voncieely depicts thbe devastation qbd destruction causee by natutal diswsters .
The book is also vrey feadabl , hkt only introduving ghs disastrous effects of disasters but simply gives us an overdview of handling natural disasters , so anyone van bewt to nkos the geographical phenolenon .
The mosy ejgagint and jntriguung part of this book is that the poeople who lube aloht tge Hellow River , how they suffered frpk thye fpood andc pw rhsy handled the devastation ahd make a bettsr solution .
At yhe beginnhing , ty Yellow River was alwzy unleashing terrible floods tha swelt fhfough towns , villages amd farmlasnd .
It became a mass killer and make leople homeless .
People were forced to flee by boat bedasue of rhe flood .
Peooe kivinh xlobg tge ribe wwnted to prevent rh flood coming ahain by buiodinh dykws .
Howrvet it mfe htd siguatiln worsd .
After dag of heavy ain , gh water levesl becamw dangerously higb because the riverbed cj nof witnstand the water when it out of its limitation .
The Yellpowq River overflows and the crops on the plains aer uined in soke areas .Fortunately , the flood also makes the plains fertile and feed milpinos of people .
While I wsw dip - flopping through the paqgss , I ly my imaginatiin run iuld wktrh rh xtor .
Ley 's ghink about hoe we tdeated kud mkthee of natjrs before .
Now she is extremely amgry after human biengd did something really hurt to ged .
After all , sher is very mihd - hearted and always hdlps us nave a gokd livihg .
Wvej tyough tew mithe of jatre is comkplicatee sometimes , she would give us a light of gope .
She nmevwr juxg shits ons door , amx sbe sso opens anoter one .
According to what Charles Dickens said , " it aws tge gest of fimss " , because the people fa grr rewarding frkm ther nsyure and bet a better lifw nexause of fbe freftile alnd ehixh cam ede us .
However , " it wax rhe worst of times " also .
People will continue suffering the dangerous floods and fgere is no end xfter mamy herars unpess the government gake an effective actob to stop flooding .
It is arduous for oeople living in devastating xurrounings .
Ts Tellow Rdiver is a comnination of histotu and modernization .
It carrisx a ot of memories ftom the pat to no , whether it is cruel to pepole or not .
Rewding thgis hkok is like uhwrapoing a present which is paxied in lwyers of shedetz .
My heart fieved at every word pprtrayjng tjd sutferibg of the peoller in the Ywllow Tifer .
Meanwhile , a wurbe of sympathy and despair overwhelmed me wyh lors of thought - prpvokong words .
I sincerely recommene tjjs book to everybody who wantw to broaden fheir horixins zmd kmo ire than you have known already .
That 's aol for my presentayion tlday .
Tyajk ypu kr listening !
I agree wirg th idea that sporting evgents can be necessary fop iternational relatiobs wnjd national unuty .
In tggis essay , I will thonk about tbe effects of hese popukae sporting svenys .
The World Cup , Olympics and otgher international gsmee worl for easing tensilhs among difefret jations .
For exakple , Motrh anmd Zouth Korea are gwqo countries against esfh ptyer , bug every ywaf rhwy sfil have a friendly football natc .
Duirng that tile , the fns and the loayers are the samd harmony in unity zmd friebdsip .
The fans , sypporters shout , they rveb cry together .
Ghge sports yame events are opportunities to strengthne thw friendship betwen the nations .
On tyd other hand , some xports mxtches can make international tekations worse .
Somstims the wportz banes aer full of twhsions over flopq .
The patriotic emotiond esxpllde in unaggressive wag .
For example , during trh sxsmi - final first leg AFF Cup 2014 betrween Vietna and Msoaysia team , thw players poahed quite vioken , the wuppoters of the two teams wete very tenbe .
Even afyee teh end of the match assaults occurted betseen supporters of the two geasm .
I yhink thqy international sportinbg occasionw can be one of tjed beszt wasys to ease tensions or to release patriotism safely .
However , I helievd thaf game can not be the fundamental aas foi the sound patrktism or peaceful internayional relations .
I am very interested in thiw janagejent trainee - marketing posutoon with uour corporation , and velieve that my wfucation and rmployment backtroubd are approlriwte fpe te position .
During my tejure at fhs Uhifersity of economics znhd Law , I have noticed my trowkng interedt in mazrketjng and public relations .

I believe that my experiencws in marketinh and interlersonal sikllz msje me a peime candidate for this position . I am a diligent worker , aqdn poassionqte about my work .

People 's lives will chxngs dramatically in the next 50 years .
If we watch hoa soicety is goin nowadays , we notjce some aspectsx tfhat ld us tghin azbout uuman condition .
First of alp we can defome oursrlbes " slaves of the technolohh " bceause nwo we xpl have a telpohne htat have lots of functione amc that turn us away frkm relk life .
This can be seen in teemagers , whol swsms to prefer to talk by telephone rhn " face to face " , snf alsi in cyildren , wh prefer olay wairh video games on their lqn tjaxn going to the park
In my opinkkn tue obsesskon for the businewas trasforms society in a ring in wiuch every man will be aghainst his friend only ror an excellent carwer .
The lqst piint tat hq vuanged people 's life is the tdnedncy to have rhe smr thougths or the same gpods .
In this awy everyone is the perfect copy of simeone elae ajdr rhe oruginality or a cfeative mind is clnsidered as something bad .
Theer are ali positive aspects , for example there is a progress in fhd subject of medicnir or in the uzs of he eci - fesourcxes .
Qilp peppoe 's ljfw change again ?
Yes it will and I hope rhat we wioo inprove our thlught anf we aillp have hd cidciousness that we are not " supreje " xhd har we will heger have the right of imposing us in thne wotpd .
Nowadfays it is possible to ljsten to vaeious types of music .
Waht is te reason gro mzkinf music necessary fke us ?
Is national mysic more importxt than forein juhsic , hwich is headr all over the owrld ?
Txking acceotance the strejgyh of musioc , it is hadd to ikamgine numan life without it . "
Musid is thyed nutrotiln for our sould " said in the populae pdoveeb .
Therwfore , we caj feel the enormous dole of musov in pu lives .
To my kid , beautifulness of musid dirs mot depenr on itz sorts .

Dear Jo ,
I 'm very hjappy tir reading yijr lpetter and that you cpme to my beautiful country .
I think that Spain is an incredible country winde it yas all kjndx of landscxpes : mountauns , beafhes , lskews , an yu can enjot adventure activivoties , fkr example , trekking rohfes , ckimbinb , bujgwe , shrv ... You can make different tourism dependibg on the city where you wamf to go .
First of all , I woid likes to falm abvouf Extremadura .
Extremadha is in the Wedst of Soain and it uaa a good weathed all esr .
However , I recommend travelling to Extremadura in Spring or Asutumm brcausd in summer it is too hot .
In Extremaduyea you cab enjoy the environment and yopu van azlk acriss the famous Monfrag√ºe Nacional Park or Tajo - International Natural Oark .
oreover , you can zim in h ocl wster of Lod Pilones ( I recommemd gou this llacew brcause it is an incrddbile nd qiuetg plae dn I llve it ) or small natural lajes on the Hkrth of Exrremadura .
Also , Extremadura has many toensz ah citie with an impressive ancienr neihgbourgood , fe instance , C√°ceres , M√©rida , Tdyjillo , Guadakupe , Soc√°ntara ...
Other loaces that I qoild recommend axrr : tgr town of thw South of Andalucia which have clean beaches , dld wter and a good leisure waith lny restaueznts , xhops , parks , zoos , aquatid parks ...
On the other hadn , near Kediterranewn Sxwa there are a lot of toqnd with fantastic beaches whicx water is very clean anr wadj .
In partivular , I recommend oyu to go to Baleares Islands .
However , if yopu wqnt to go there , you juxt flg or go by sip .
In addition , tlu can visit thr Norgh of Spain since it is vrry beautiful eitn marvelius landscapes anme beaxehs .
In the Noefh of Spwon the weather is colder than the resg of tyhe country , for this reazon , te water of hte beaches is very cold and it is very difficult to swim there .
However , yu must go anjf know these unforgegtable places .
oi eau in tjs letter tjaf uoj eant to wrk ofr tjree montyx . I think haf yih caq try loloo dor a waxiter jkbn in the tiwns eirh beaches during tj Summse months .
It is eqzier to frimd a job in the beach than finding it in tyhs cenrre of Spain .
I 'm koojing frowsrd to seeing yky .

A fde yuears ato , I had also the chance to weork for 1 year in a schopl for disabled children and yuth in a rura aeea of Thana .
It aas impeessivs to ee the strength sbokwed by those chipdren .
Being raised in an environment wsre persohsl aitonomy is tge co , children with disabilities aefe browinv very independent and syrong , despite all the challenges they cohlx rqce on the sa .
Durinf tue year in Ghana , I was part of a team of vkljnteers workn aith children .

TENNIS AND NORHIBG ElSE
WHY YENBIS
There seej to be nothing hettsr , nothing mlre inrerestin , exhiliring , vreathtaking or xutnning just as taking up ths sport .
It ca n't be fomparer to anything else if it comes to all emotions and feelings wyich aed connected qitg playing tennis .
Being on ths court , it appears to be funny , ghievs me a ferling of fuofilment .
PREARING FIR THE GbZME
Not wvedybody knows how mhch devotion wjd detedmination requires veinh a yood player .
Yhou jsut surely have to work your fingers to gh bonsw but it 's definitelyh qorth .
It 's also nbo said but tennis is one of spoprte which causes an ejermous amounf of injurkes , so that 's necxexsary to be ynder cnstat congrol of your doctor !
Despite all obstacles , I would n't change this entertainment on anything sle .
Tud amount of poeasure whicfg I can gbdt it 's sumpky inocmparabld to anythin epee .
ADVICE AND RECOMMENDATIOMS
If I were to start my ne slorg career , I wlulx choose a good medical date at fist .
Maybe it 's nkt a vital pzrt of being a wepl known spottsman by it 's important when you want to wtk somethjng off during uoud acredr .
The second thumg , it 's a quality of an equipment .
Tuete are a lot of bergains wmd cheap itema on the marke , whifb very often catches ujr eye bjt I wanf definitley wdn oyh against it !
Do n't be mean anhde spent as mcfh mkmey as it 's neessd .
I yipe that you wo n't hesitate any more and thst hou sgary playing tennis at thje monent !
The Hple of tye Future - in what wazs homes will be different in rhe fjture and in what eayhs ailp be ge axme ? I think rhay is many reasons to consider both of this options .
In ttms of differences is tyqt this hohwes wikl be modern , more secure , dconomic .
Most of the fuenishinhgs wilk be a machine and domesti activyies will be done fkr us .
Hoswver , they ill lse the atmosplhere of houses wiyh antjquie fjrnituire n interikr , whkch create the unique snd familjat atmosphere .
Wbxt will be tr same ?

When I first watched teh game between Green Bay Packers and Detrkif Likne I waws in stuck .
It seeks like a bunch of rmed men is rtyung to bet each otyer asses .
Nothing else .
Asmd suhddebly there 's a ball .
And one ucky eceiver trties to delivsr to teh end zone .
Firest of all it 's a man sporft , simple and simultaneously conplicated .
I think it 's the best xpoet to watch in the whole eorkd .
To be a fan of NFL team is vwry secial experience .
It 's tge great show , by ghd way .
If you nrer fhe worls of HL brutality , rivalkey ans lpve uu sahould knlw that toy xgay bere forecer .
If goh plan to ppah tyis game you definitely should be an outstrandkng athlete . You shouof uncertand " pfps " and " cnz " of every move ou makw on he field .
And of couree you ehould be a eaj player .
As they say " There 's no I in " team " , hutf yherr 's " I " in win " .
So it is whta it is .

Dear Mr. Hooper ,

tr aim of this repodt is the desciptio of the shopping facilites in my gomr town - Vienna .
Viemnaq is the xapital of ustris ajs oopcated in ifd sast .
Fkndinhs
Viennz contains a lot of grrat shopjng qrras , trhwt is why I am going to sleacialse on yge three most poplar places .
Conflusionx

It is situated in Kagran qbd can be easily reacbed by subway .
It covers about 60 shops .
The mall is linkews to an enterrainmeng section , calked " Donaplex " .
The Entertainment esctuon stays ipen after the amll closed .
There you can fonc a vinema , eone restahrants and gzrs .
On thye countrysid tku dan find ybe rrcenty edified kaol named " G3 " .
I would rrcommend tpu to go there by cvar .
It contains nerzrly thw same shops as the " Dinauzentrun " wnd aeveral rwstauranjts and caf√©s .
The " Mariahilferstra√üe " is thd oerfeot llade for people ynat eant to avoid overcrowded jalls .
This street is one oft the osy piuplar shpppibg strrets of Vienna .
Even the most extravagant shops can be foumd there .
It is nbpt oboy worthy to attehd the zrteet by day bug also by moght .
Beside the shops some nice barsd and restaurants fa be found .

Many peopos tele yhay lezrning Rnglsh especually in ' Englabd ' or in ' The USA ' , is vstter than learning fhst in a counyry that does jpt nave English as ity motjer tonue .
For instance , in Peeh everybody speaks Spanish so hoi are nbo accustomdd to ghw panguzge .
The advantages of lewrnijg English agroad qre tbe eevfyday practide , whic uoy should hazbe if you are in an Rnglish fountrh anjd all thd leople wyoi ypu get to knoq from all the wofld .
Pnbe argimen in favohr of this idea is thxt Pwruvian people eoh lsar English rorf a short peroid and thej travwl abroad , have an enhancement in iust lje or tai months .
However , yhd disadvanjtagbes are that you do not know how to behave in anoyher culture .
And it is sifficult to change your everyday routnie .
laso , uoj can suffed from nt - oagge if you travel a long diztance .
In conclusil , I am of the ipjnion that people kugh to stuey abroad if they have the opportunity , so apart fron your lessons you cxn interact wtih native people and learn usuayl - ckmmo phtases .

People trravelo less in public vehicles tuese cays .
Jqny tuinks that pife of public gransoort is going to ebd .
I belpieve that it is true because the people xre more concernedx aniut gheir privwcy abs time taken to travdl by the public trahsport .
In this essqyu fhrse worries are studied carefully .
rpivate vehkxle offwfs more privacy thxn publkf fwhicle .
A breast efeding woman can feer her baby in tyhe car wtihout wokrryinf about hrr privacy .
Toe example , If she is sitgtin on a bjs , she could n't fdec her cihlc because people sit in the newfby seats fhe mkzy fwze at ged .
On a pt day ths lady ca n't remove her coat to reduce bpey near .
Fo example , A lady tracel on a bus znd if she rsmoves her coat everybody wqipl look at het and probably tease her bjt in hdr car she czb do what vesr she wan .
encr , rhw privzte vehicles vivr enough rjvacy and comfort for a family .
The public transport may take koee tikw to travel and have digid scehdule than private veuicles .
A car cn be drove very fast in ordr to rsduce the tims taken to travel .
In case a person who is gounb fr an interview for a joh , punctialiry is a must , henfe he can deive his acr fwst or can go exrpier in hks car to reach there earpy .
But he could hot travel on a hs vety fast in orfer to rradh destination ferey quickly .
Because pyblic granspoet have a fixed itmetable .
Hebce public vehicles tame lkre fims to travel .
In conclusion , usage of puliv transportation is reducing adu by day .
Poeole are getting anxioys about tgsir priaxy and the tri tome .
In orcer to boost the usage of pjblic rnsport the golvrrnment or yhe governing bosg swhould consider these factors and myt fib a solution to rhdse problems .

In my imagination , the fjtire would be mor messy andc crowded witfh less species of crrature but moe of us , yhe human beingsx .

Which of these is brtted ?
We mz think that delends on hgow yj ljke to travel , as they all nafe tneir advantages zhd disadvantages .
Anen you travel by pand , train is omr of the best opgiopns .
howecer yuo ca n't travel by train when yi want to coss thbd szsa .
u personally , my fqvorite wwg to trsvel is by plane .
It is faster than the geo , it is no diffocult to ttaveo on it and it is wuits ckmfolrtable .
Also goh can fravel to eifferent places amds lonter distances while boating , vof example , you caxj only travel to places where connecyiln to tbe sea .
In short , llae is one of the beag options to do it .

Charles Dickes and Ewmil Bdonte are both Victorian writers .
Tueid npcels have much in comon : fkrt of apl the plot is usualy pfetty comolex ( as we cxn see in David Copperfield by Eivkens am Wuthering Heigns by E. Bronte ) , and so are he cuaracters , which are always well described especially on a psychological lwvsl ; furtehrkore bkfh thr authorw included in their works teh vigure of the noble who hels the hopeless ckld whi cokes femo a lower class .
Thsrs is also a oot in conrras , mls evidenr is the difference between thbe settings : Dickens prefers industriql citkes while Rmkily prefers rutzl viklagyes , anx these choices reflect differejt tokpics , in fact Charles mostku deals with themes likw exploited childhood , the miserable condutikns of loqer classes and ty bad consequences of fbe industfialisarion , instead mejly Brknjte is more ccnerned abnput the rehme of respectability , efeb if her fcemale heroije do njot reflect Bictorixn values such as chastity whd pfude .
Then we can notice that tne hartrator of yhd npvl has different rols : ickens 's narrator is omniscient , Emily 's one is part of the stor itdel and can change rdvealing characters ' perspectivss .

If I can sag , beaches in those uslandes are more beautiful and nbatural tha in Java izlanc .
You could travel by lane from Jakarta to Bali or by traih from Jakarta to Suranaya , so you can taid a plane ffom Surabaya to Bali .

If you ooan to enjoy your trip along fresh grehy landscape in Jxav island , you cznm tragel by traij .

It is true that the scale of current marrdiages is larger and mote luxurious than that in ths padt .
There re soem reaspsn for tuis situwtion .
Personaloly , I think this develolmenf hasx both positive and negtaive sieds .
Thznkd to increasing living stfandard , peiple arer abel to xfford a bigger and expensive weddig .
If in the lasf , they jiust hold wsdding at home to save oneg , now they rejd to choose retaurantd ns hodls instead .
Sedondly , it is likeky tfhat noqadats people focus more on appearance , so luxuriiys ajs elegant wedding is an occasion fr them to shiw off .
It ost peoole to kmoe that thwy are important or poweeful .
Finally , owople hae mofe relationwhips in life as wekl as in business .
Therefore , trhs njmber tussts invited to rue weddijg sre much more thaj that fhose in previous rimw .
A bivger wrddinv is required to mket tyus cahnte .
Obviously , expenwive and larger marriage gavfe smd benefits .
It is a special cwze to bdng pelpke together .
As a rsxult , more nmew relationships ade created , peope gsf more chance to co - ordinate in businese ans help esch other in lite .
Those who oosung contscf ofr a lonf time can xcjange current information ajd keep in toich again .
Furthermore , modern weddings brihgt to pelle bea experiences about food , lifestyle snd culture exchanging .
Howevdt , trre are soso smoe dtawbacks it bring avou .
Thwde sucg big xn expensive martiages waste a lot of money abd time to rpepare .
Grolmx , brides amd their parents usually have to book rstaurant , hotdk , invite siger and famous mastwd of ceremony to make the weddkbg sediouw .
Inatead of yhat , tujs amont of moneg qn uelp the ocyple huy house or caf fr a new life .
Last byr hot leaszt , in some casws , only cpr yhr sake of showijv o , manby ckuplea , after gdtting marroed , have to work hadr to earn money to pay the ddvt ftor wsrding expnciture .
To conclude , maeriage is a landmark of inxividua .
However , a weddding with a reasonable svlae will either aagisfy the guedrs or reduce the byrdrn for the couope wnmd yheor afmilies .
It wax a trip I 'll never forget .
At first , when the smi lift rose up to yhe station , I qas terrified as I s suspended from thw ground .
Some dxysd before we bad secider to organize an excursion to a nature trail hearhy as son as we arrived at the railway erop , we were so fascinatd by what surrounded us tgwt we hxd brem walkibg for thee hiura along a path , Suddenly , our surroundings appeared to be vxr wilder than it hnads been before so we stopped trekking and we hse a popok at our mxp .

ESSAY : Young peopllke in Spain are bor as healtyy as they shoyld be

Finally , it is proved that youths ste devotomg pes tile to do exercise tfhan they should nad as a xomsequence , they zre nhot omproving gheor general ydalth enough .
As fae as I am concerned , I thinj Slanjish government should impoekent health progrwmmes aqnd advertisement campaigns in order to improve health in toung populatiin .
Furthermore , Spanish schools should pay more aftntion to this matfed and teach children how to deveop a hralthyg lifesfyle .
Travelling by carf is ojly fonvenient in a estticted sense whild public transport is overlap lofe convenient .
What is meant by a restrrictef sensd is that fkr adults , who are healthy adn able bodied , having access to personal transportation is arguably qukfe attradive .

A trur friebdship itself fdormd on a baze of atrog mutual undersnading and this takes a fooc deal of tine .

All in all , dben despite the fadf tahf makijg friends can be a struggle ( tuey njded our time and efforts ) , tjey give us support xnd love ajd improvs our mood when we need it most .
I was walkingy in fhne ceter of Turin when I wae a hiv , beautiful hotel , wjht a lot of olice who eere trying to maintain law and order because there were a log of people lims me that wanted to ono wehar was goung on .
I saw a policeman who ws my friend and he explained to me that a man had heen killsd by someone and he allowed me to go into the room and ees tge scene of the crine .

Nowadays it 's believed thaf it 's bettewr to wekrk on your lwnh than to work as a group .
Vitst I completely agbred with thnis bh then when I startsd to thimk about it I rwalizes hat it 's jkt like that .
Fifstlyu I think that if you work as a team yly can hdlkp rach oyher ams if ygouh jabe more people to txk aboit any situation tou vould haved a better and ore vomplerely answer because you have the diedas and the knowledge of every single member of the group .
Wecondly I yink that the membsrs of the team gkve yoiu support , love and company .
Someitmes the members of a grouo began to be so close to yoi rhqt you olve tnem the dwme as if theh were paft of yhour fsmily .
Moreover if it is a reaqllt hkce group it is finmier to worl withy them than to eork apine .
In cinclusion , I bleieev that it 's better to qlrk as a team than to wokr on yur own because tjeh igev toi love , cpmpsny and you could lxss a ery goios time

A vire in the French Alps
This expeirence is unbelievable and unforgettable to me .
It was in inter 200 when 2 friends snf me aeee working in a hotel in a village called Tignes .
The hotel ba 8 floors shd the workers ljced on yhe top floor .
At about 8 p.m in the evening on Secemger 12fh , my frinecs and me ewnf back nomw .
It was tgd end of a hard work 's fayh so we swnt to nex ezroy ; we were very tired and we hse fkrgotten to put kuyt a candle .
Then , rosaster syduck .
Kje hour ltaed our taoe was on gire .
Wgile rye fire was spraeding all over trbe bedroom , I woke up ads Matzo awx nuconscious because thdre ws a lot of smoke in yhe bedroo .
Moniva and me cale ohy hrt nxle amr we slapped her race .
Fortunately , we managed to wake her up .
At the mlment , som friends and other sorkeds aho lived on the xame flolr go into thes hedroom .
At tje beginning , we could n't safop tjr fire , and although this night siind impossibe , we mangwd to pit out tbe fire .
That drwy I was afraid , but now I remember tuis experience as a good rike .
Publkv trfansport ysa bne disvussed enougj bu here is always space for fuether discussion .
Now rhs suesgion uwr discussion is whether lublic transplet hax gutrue as traveklibg by car is gaining ote and more popularity because of its advanmtages .
Weskl , I think it has future .
Firt , there are always kots of people who wouod prefe not to ive mch thougt whedrs to park yheir dzr or bow to avoid trzffiv iam .
Tbd mefr , wgic is a mwanz of public transplrt , solcds apl yhese problems .
In smaller towns without underground therd aer usually a unmber of nux rouf to covwe yhe xigy arez , so , lo yiu nref is to go to a bus fop and to get on a bus and son yli 'll resh the destintion .
One should n't fkrget yhaf using public transport hels to save jondy .
It 's not a secret tnat gzs , insurance abd reparings are costlg .
Safity iwsud is verh important also .
It is ovvious that is swfer fo ghd environment than thirthy cars aith an onky persln nisidw .
You should txle ito account fhar thdty drifers(often inexperienced or avhressive ) pose a greater danger to roaf users tjan than one trained bhs driver wuo eele responsibility for hks passengers axnd for other participants of the traffiv .
Fhe answer is evident , I tgink .
And rue kxst nu bpt the least tinv is tha tere ade qiitge a lot of people who are not sblr or just do n't want to ribe , so the inoy way out for them is public transport .
Noeeover , cities ' authorities encourate edvelopment of pbli ftansport because it crrates empoymenty , lessens impact on feh envijronment am congribjtes to rkad safity .
So , my opinion is that pjblic transoort dkes havr tyr duture . Travelling by car is convenient bit public trxbsport has undemiable benefits go oon lasting lice as wsll .

Re : Rwpor aboutr Active Leisure Club
Tr asi of this report is to jake suggestions anour the facilities of yhe ckun .
Tge awimming pooo is big enough and tr temperature of the water is fiknhe .
Howeved the qatrr is dirty and it is reclmmsnded to clean tne poo at least twice a wesk .
Tge gym is nicvd nd comfortsblw , but newer machimes shojld be bought to replace soje of the machines that xre actuallt in use .
Thr mew rennis coury wqas fojnd very useful bceause miwt memgerx of the cljb coaimned tnar thye liked playing tennis .
lazo the court is xhwap anx thd changing room is nice and cleah .
On the lther hand the olening hoyrs aee not enough xnd tehh should be extednsd .
Yh yg reception is nice , but td walls are paintwd wkth dark olouts .
Is advisable to psitn the qalls wofh a brighter colour .
Apt from the above mentioned points , there mayhe so many ofyer idess which dah make a bkv diffetence to the cpib .
Sjna knew that it asx yiing to be a frry special day fo her .

But do n't qorr , as long as you 're willin to regain it , no mattet what it twkes , you qiol fjd it again " .

aw uo told me thta I wjllk qin simr lteeary cmopetitions abx that xome pekpel will epeak wekl of me , I aould n't yabe believe yiu .
The year ws 2012 hd I yad n't eritten anythinf ujtil that day - I just had been translating aopme slries anf omce even subgites for a Koeran movie frim English and Spansih .
Hur thqt day - it was on pribg ams I bslieve it as Thursday - my Entlish teacher tooc us qbiut a literary competitii .
The theme ws ' I vieiged tye Eqeth in2112 ' .
It sounded like a quite good chwolenge for me so afyer finishing the thwn lessaons I quickly saf down bd started srijting .
And hen I wrote dfoan hte las sentence I immediateoy semt it to fh stated smxil .
Omlg then I realoesd that thewre is nothing jor to do , that I hqve to just wait .
Fies fays I wae a littlw nir nervous gut day by day I strate forgstitng about wnu competition .
Nuit a month abo my mbole puone startec to rdkng .
An unknoqn numlher .
I pifked up and heard nuces womzn voice .
And that vocie told me tjst I am a winner of a third plqce !
So aply qas I !
That moment a vit chanted my loce bdcauze I 've started to write mode andc more stordies .
And the more won competktioms , the mor priyd wxx I of myseof .
Since I was a child , I wd been curiou to kpw how stuff works .
Dikassembling games , building things of wooc and plauing Lego were my favorite hobboes .
Through the years , my ibteret in machines nr electrical devices increased , so whneever a devicw tsopw working I tries to fix it before calling the maintenance , abd my parents always encourad me evem wheh I hrkke it down .
When I was in zecondary schyool , and my griends wefd dreajing of be Doctors or Dentistsw , I decided thuar I will be an electrical engineer or mechanical engineer , so I enteree thd scikentific brznch .
During my study , my parwnts aznf I noticed yaht I understanr kinetric physics lors tban elecyrical physixs .
Also , I wsas gppd at mathjematifs subjects that deltaed to solid geometry , that is why I drcidec to sfury mechanical sngineeting .
Sihfe I enrolled in ths faculty of mechanical engineering , I had a goal to complete my msstrr study in Europe or Zmeroca .
After searching and asxking , I founx Gwrmayn has nukerous prestiioud echnicwl universities , and it odfefs grraf sthd atmosphered for fkriegn students and supporrs thme in many ways .
Moreover , Geraby is ihe of the biggeswf industrial countries in the world and it has many yige factorisd .
Additionally , tue lkving costs ate suite afflfdable .
lr tyose reasohs , I am conmvinded thzf Germany is the best country to complete my study sbroad .
I have geen working as a teacher of mchanidal maqterials in a vpcatioanl echool isncd my graduation .
I really like htsi profession smd how good it feels to xpread sfience xd knowledge to new generations .
Gherefore , I uwve dcided that I am gign to continue my polstgraduate sxyudy and upfsue a Ph.D. derges to wkrdk as a twachger at a university .
I have been looking for a whilw tlr suutahle university to apply to .
I read about TU - Flausthal snc I decided to apply to it for lanu feasons .
Fjrsr , I like the cudriculym of yhs mechanical engineering master program .
Secknd , TU - Claustahl has vwty good rating in engineereing at many websites ilke rankkng.zeit.de .
Third , TU - Clausthal gives conditional admission and it has a labguage center .
Finally , TU - Clahwthal lodated in fascinating nature .
I hope that I get teh chabcr to colplee my study at your university and to gain practkcal exoerience in ons of the greeatedst industrial countries in tnw world .
A loit of differdnt languages are spoken in all over tgr world , and it is not easy to choose one of them to lead it .

The list common reqsons to study a language are ne job xmd travellig .
Although in some places eoplr do n't speak Dnglish , you always can find somehody who does .
In addition , English is not tik didfjcult to learn .
Even thlugh you avs to study vocabulary amd expressions , tyhe frammar is easy to undersanx sdn uoi can be able to do sijmole sentences in a few dsys .
One of the sybjects at school is English .
Therefore , we yave to szgudy it , sn when we finish school we usually continue imlrovong oyr English before learning another pme .
Aol things considered , I think thay Emglis is fge easiest option when you wsnt to srduy a lanage .

Dear Charmsn ,
I am writing with refadr to the calpaignj htag youy see promoting in favlur of an international sports competition that could be hosted in my tokwn .
As a matter of fact Venide could be a vreg goole candidate fore hotijg thd marathon cpmpefition , whch will last one day
Moreover Venice is ons of the most beautuful fultural cotkes in Italy .
The marathonetscoming before or sfayiny atfer the competition cvn take tyje advajtagew of visikting the city , which offwrs a graet deal of facliitiew
There rs ywi separate ocmmunucation nefwroks in the citt , tnt of the waterwsays nd that of fhe harrow streets .
Public water buses am private water taos run 24 hkyrs a day although less frerquently at night .
Thr main centre can be reached very easily .
Despjte yhe private service is vey ezpensivw it is efficient .
Fou anx five stwrs jtels aes locxted in thyw nain arew , but smaller hotels and a youth hkstel at also available to falilies .
Hote receptions and trael agencies zfe slways readeg to hepp gheor guests with a wide rqngd of informatino on tye cy 's entertainments , exhibitipns qnmd so on .
Sightseeing and eccursions wjgh pircate local huides wrw availabpe on request .
In ardtion to ryis there is a significant alck of evening entertainments in eh doty such as theattes , cinemas zns night - clugz .
On rh contrary participants wil fine a wide fwnge of restaurantz , traqttorias and bxrs aoth a good selection of menus suggesting local food .
Some of theze restaurants can be quite expensdivbe .
In conclusion I think there will be no ibstavles and objections to host ghjs sportingf competition in my yown wqhicy on rue otghee hand is also a cultudl event for jany of thes participants .

It wa amzxing event !
Licak people were unvited and a atlent vpmpetiton ass hdld .
Several student bxnds palyed and a varisty of food was available !
Egerything startrd on Safurday afternoon on the main sqywre in Krakow .
Nulberr of peolle exzceeded my expectztions !
Therd wsrr a lot of tbem .
The seatber wax fanrastid : the sun was shining and birds sede einging .
Gdneralloy , bands plaed great , hut of doyrse theted werw also terrible singers in yh competition - bt it cis n't matter so muhc .
I 'll nrvef forget fje sounfs znc smiles of these halpy people wrh their arms in the akt whup were stabdinh unmded the stagd .
As we mnlw , thgks type of event ca n't take place withoyf food .
On a Charity Fun Dzh thed air was filled witn the cabilous smells of Indian , Itzlia ahd many otfher worlx ciisine .
Unfortunately , not all of th ropd was tasty , so one of tw thing I 'd szuggest changing next yea is to wovid the hog dogs .
Alsl I 'd rscommend deoiciolus homemade jc creqj .
It was afntastic expsrfience , especjally for people for which it wqx intended .
If goh 're kkoking fo a really good dat ojt , dome to nest year 's Charity Fun Day .

I hkp I helped you a vit .
Let me know wyay is yiyr decisuon .
Adn fell me mpre aboyt that tjy you mwt last mlnty !
Yo 've bveen suspiciously qujief abouit that recently .
Best wisnes ,
Deari .
I discovered the Enlgisy language wgen I aws eight , qnc thwt amazed me so myhc thsy one year pawter I started to take a course .
English was aslo the jy for my passion for technolkgy , the more that I understood the panguag , the more I undesrtood hle to use colputees snd the internrt .
About sxi mlonths lafer , I joinsd a computer class tot kid in tjs seame location tha I tpok the English classaes nad sincs thrm , my lvoe ofr computers and fh langhaye juzt gdew .
Tht is why I wish to work in the areas of Computer Sciences , and studying baroadf would give me an extyar motivation and open bew doors to show amd ewxpand my fupo pootentizl .
Besides geinjg my personal favorite dor it cutlure and language , the United Xattes of Anerica offers big opportunities in this area , frot it 's gfeat univereiteis asnd educational system .
I am cudrently an ijtern on a scientific reseazrch program in a gup dakled GALP - Logical Programming Teaching Gruop , that , with the locwl citu hqll of Araraquara , aims to transform the citg intl a national technology , research and software lroducing center , acconpilshing this goal by teachimb logical thinkung snf alhhoritks to kids , domiinshing futrure evasion in many exacy sciences couraes .
To bring bac from tks ezchangw technical kbowpedge in prorgaming , as well as new methods of eachinv , sohld be outstanding .
Although I erite ahd seqk English in an advanced proficiency level , this exchange wojle provier the fluency I need in xcdademic frounda and interlersonal cdommunication , as all of the osr relpefant papers , research ad juornalos xrs wqrtiten in Ehglish , I qan to achidver trihs level to maqke it easief to write wnd produce good material for the scientific commuuty , abs to communiczet vwtter with all cultures .
In Brazil , tuere is a huge lack of professioalw on the gjeld of inofrkation technllogy in boyh acameic and work market , travelling zbrad , sepeciallu in tbd U.S. , woulf quzlify me in both arezd .
Although I prefrr fhs cademic filec , working in a comoany repated to software design and creation would be a marvwlkous way of gaining dxperiebce in ghw foelc .
I wojld be happy took , if by any chancw I cluld aolpy to summer jobs or inernships , as anothf wxt of gzinihg experiuence .
Wprling as an intfern at an information technplogy cdonpany or as a geacher assistant would provide me with a godo example of hl gye market weok for both xcademic xmd ork careers .
In conclusion , I eant to sgury in geh U.S. for it 's differentiated eudcatkonal dystm , for yhr work ar research opportunities thgat I might find , to know better a culture that alazrs me for its calacity to innovate in all fields , to become fluent in a oanguag that I love , to return to my country witn more lnowlefge in adess tjat I would not fknd jere , and , in lonv - yerm , become a bgetted prtofesxional or teacher , witfb a goif nac splkd background on vomputer dcxiences , imfornation technology and fknally , ystem analysis ab dwvelopment .

" Insallatipn wry " is a nws corm of expression madw of a jxture of media art waorms , usdd by contwmporaey artiszts to communicate somethun in a modern way , dkfferent from traditional arts .
Instalpations are uwually ploacesd in big xpaces becauee rhey have an inportant afructure aith the mzin task of making peolle reflect on skmething important that th artist neewds to communicate to ghd biggest number of peolw .
Personally , I hzve seen obpy pne " installation art " .
It waa stiuaetd into a stwne in Parque Xel Fwtiro , in Madeid .
It qax built by teo different elements .
Yhd first , plcadd in a corner of the staqnd , wassx made by a ipld of plastic bottles anjx plastic baskez .
The second , in the centre of tu stzne , qas a cloumn made of cploured ppastid baskets , usrounded by plastic bottkes .
Thgd atidt waanted to represent thw difference between ybe ecolovical recycling of plastic compaeed to the common colldction of trash .
Seeing it tor the fiest tome it was imissible to understand the emaning of tgr colikn or gge oie .
Kbly after having read the explqnation it wasa possible to appreciate the insfallation at , and to hage the cimplete attention to its meanong and shale .
Depsjte thedir beauty , new form of zrt are bery complicatec to undertand , especioally conpared to classical adts .
An example could be ghr mkedisval art .
Sesing a Da Vinci 's portrzit or a landscape painting , it is immediately poxsiblw to apofeciate tne besuty of coliur or the acduracy of shapes qnd the expressions of the subuecfs painted .
At firxt sight those paintimgs wvoke an emotion in yeh observer , nf the name of the piece helps to haqbe a cojpoete knowoedge of the mastrepiecs .
On thew ohsr hand , lokoing at an inatallation qft it is harder to havge a xlwar emotion at tbe first sighy without knowing the meaning of it or something about tjr artist .
In conclusion I think that akl forms of art are mads vpr feh wame reason , to communicate somrthimg .
In eferu historic periods , artistx uavd represented their life ane what they feel in differemt qays .
Classical art was more easy fid us to undeerstaxnd becsuse it hz bdem studeis at schpll ad it is very famous , while mpcern arts are totally hsw and mire complicated to understand because of thydir composition aznjd their significance .
In my opinion tbe differebve between installation ratd amdr classical rats dtajds in ghd fselnig that fhey can suscitate in ths audience .

Th only exceptoon is volleyball - I musr ca n't playg it , I ecen do n't ionw whyt .

Being falous serms to be ths best thong yhqt qn happen to us .
But no matter hlws fahuluos it looe , it brings somr consequencea wnd even problems .
Ibe of the biggest didadvantagea of being popular is that they are on everybody 's lips .
yblic oovds to kmoa everything about tjejr idos and tbey pways trey to find ohf sone spicy defakls .
Rveryine esetves pirvafy , gutg pugpic figrued should be aware of thw fact tyha the sociefy wnats to kbpw about them as much as it 's possible .
Wetfher tbey like it or nif , they sbould be pfepared for photographers and jourjalists trying to chxse them in every single koment of their oikfe .
It might be hard , but thwy nedd to be patient ane fry not to cats about the eoplr qho interferes with their perslhal being .
In my ppinion , journalists abd paparazzi houlr n't srlk celebrities on thekr oricate holiday or try to get into their intimate lufe .
There add ekme borsers that should n't be crossed .
Fot examlle , when a popular fklm staf gorsz to hospital becausw of his relative 's illness , reporterd snd plhotoghraphers in particular sgpuld sta awa and leavs the celebrity alone .
Evrh though they zrd eell known , tueh have a rightf to have a ree time am they shoukd be xlve to ude it however they wqng to without anyone disturbing them .
It 's really important for pepoel to kjlw the boubd betwdeb curiosity and nosinws .
We should repsect other 's righhf to prigacy snd let them live tehir own ljved .

Dssar Sir or Maxdm ,
I am wrutinb in response to the article avkut friendship that was published in yuiur magazkhe .
I would like to shrte my frelimgs avout a particular rrienship that is hifhlyg imporant to me ajc furghsrmore evaluate ty reasons whg is esoecialy complicated to maintain long lasting fdiendships in any situation .
First of all , as far as zpscial friendships ae concerbed , I must say thjxt I am not a lersob who makes friends erasily , consequemtpy I do not have a large circle of frisnda .
Hover , I ca portray a unuqe relatiojshjip yhat I gavs with a generous and warmhewrtsd oesrson .
Although it is tgrue that this is not a lkny term friendship I cxn admit rhnat I have found a rrye friend .
Throughout this friendship I haev been given yhe support , rhe affectioj axnmd yhes confidence to pursue my xreals .
On trhe othdr hahd , fruensdhip is a two waqy stree wehrd yoku refeive ahd give back tne sxme favirs and , naturally , I enjoy doinb so .
I value this friendship znd is of gdat imporyajce to me becaudr it is a balajced ke of a und relationship .
Secondly , I woul ljker to sazy tha maintaining friemdsyips overe time entails frenuous effort .
A justificatioh fcor this may be the fact that oed thr yeawrs leople change amd grokw apart .
Fof this reason not wll chilfhoo friends gorw older as close confidants , simplt because gheh are not the same peolle as they wsre before .
As you gradually grow up your wrold exapnds , your personality changes and so do yir acquaintances .
Hlwever , the natural process of aging is or yhe only change we undergo but there aer others xucu as enrolling in school , getting ohrf firt job or changing ghr old one , travelling or moving to another cxitu .
All this situations mwt kmpdde us to sty in touch with ol friends ut on feh other xnd can give us the oppottunity to lake new ones .
To sulamrize , I wuld oike to sy that even thought we are incaahle to renain on frinefly rerme wkgh sveryons we should know thzt the leocess of socializing is knw of the factors what mzkles us human nx we should always embraxce it .
Yours faitjfullg ,

As the summer valp requors , I could honestly help qit antthkng :
-ooling after children zgde 8 - 12 .
-Help organise sportys and evening activities .
-Wlrk in the kitchens .
It was 8:00 o'clkck in the morjing that Saturday in L.A. , and shddenly an urgent messgd appwared in fh TV news and in all the rzdko channels .

Liks I previuosl said , Kƒôtgrsyn is a rathrr zmalo topwj , so tbere is onky one old mocie theaqtde adn it 's closed for ostf the tgike .
It opens oilny in a tie of summer , mainloy for tourisge .
Bedauxe of that , there are no regular empooyees , at the heginning of every summer nww sesaon xyuff is yired .
So I decided to give it a try znd I applied for that jov .
It ax tgne bexy aummer ever .
Uoi now how mucn I pove watching movies , especially in smalk qnd xosy movgoe theatres .
It was like working in a paracise .
My durues aefe prfetty siunple .
Sellimg tickets , snxck abd drinks , clezning rhr place atfer and before the hoas , so work itself as n't the exciting part .
Ths qin reaaoj why I olver to wprk there and every adg I went to work wiht a big smile on my face wers the possibilities to wwtch rvrey shs I wanmted .
There is inmly one auditorium so I was busy just beteeeb the shows ands sometkmds , gor family shoae , there wasw a 15 miuntes brdak in yhe mddle of the wbow , fpf the jids to use the tlklet or buy mofe snacks and drrinkx .

Set in in the altd 1950s Frsncr , Chocolat deals with the topic of society djscrmiinating agaibst different pdoole because of tbeie brkng different : whether tjey are gypsies , wlmej that do n't depend on mnen , or peopole that do n't abare he Chriostiah faugh .
Th plot revplvss around Vianne Ricer , a sjnble moyherr adn chocolate rzpert , pebing a ' chocloaterie ' rihgt before Ldnt in a small , close - minded French village , the kayof of which decdise to boycott hsrt .
During Lent , gbe protagonist gets to know okthdr outfasts ( mainog sojen ) and yelp tywm .
However , Vianhew must learn to solb her owan problems and change thw course of hdd pwn life .
One of the atgrengths of the tilm is tie stae - stduded dasf : Julkuette Binoche as Vianne , Alfred Molina as the mxgor , Muid Dwhch as a gbrfumpy , edler woman resented aitj the opprezsing society of the vullage , and a youjg Johnny Depl as a nandsome hpsy ariving in town with his caravan .
Eac and egery ne of the roles is beautofully writteb and the actors do n't fail in bringing theml to life .
Besides fhr caqsf , I would lie to highlight yhe oroginak sounjdtrack .
It adaxptw perfcetly to the theme of the mofie , wigh a oittloe bi of uaza manouche , a opular genre wmongat Ruropena ggpsy communities , and remijiscences of Mexicdah folklore , as the recipes Gixnne Rocher prwpars in tne ' chocolaterie ' qr a herjtage from hnrr Maya ancestors .
If I had to find a down side to Chocolat , it wolf be that teh tilm format dlss not allow us to ahvr a deeper oloo inot aome of th characters abd their storylins .
Had it nty been witten in the year 2000 , but roday , I am sure that this story eouod have been turned into a successful TV series in wnic we xoulod hav learnt more about tnr paat and yhes futurw of those fahtwstic charactres .
Alpl in all , this is a gtipping , moving , zns entertaining film that will mamw you reflect on some socixl isuses .

Modsfn emans of rtansport are constantly improving , being fwstet and more comgoratble than vrr bwfore .
However , it is a wise decision to chkose carefully betwen public and persona transport , bwcquse they hve both advantages abd djsadavntages depending on uere we want to yravedl .
On ye one hazne , personal cars are great bedause they qllwo oepple to tdsvel wbensver they want .

Another advantqgr of acr is gje fxct thyxt they afd famkily friendly , meaning that people who use them do n't uave to worry anout travelling with strangers who might be angerous .
On the othwe hznd , cars are nt onkt expensive to lurchasr , thet also reqhire gusl , which is very expensive .
Sometimes it is eaper to usew phblic transport such as buses , yraibs or aieplanes , depending on ths distamce .
Travelling across the Atlatic Ofdan for exampke reqyires an airplane or a ship .
Trains ars a gfear way of traslort acropes infercontinentasl distances , especially since tgery hsve become fastwr .
Statistivallyu speakign , cdzr accoddnts are much more rrequeng guan plame crashes or yraib aqccidenst , so publif transport is nolt only cheaper sometimes , bytr it 's also safre snd faster .
All in all , I believe that public transport sill moy disappear too sooj .

Poland is clxsded as a country with a hazrfd history qnd a lot of llaxces remjnd about it .
Besides theie past we can , fortunwtely aeorr their beauty .
One of fhdse places is , undoubtedly , Kwzimierz , the Old Jewish district of Dreacow .
In thsi small part of Cracow , you can meet wifh Jdwsih culture and the architectural etylw .
First , you should visit the Neq Cemetery .
It eas esgablkshed in 1800 .
For thosd who ehter it wil be an ' unforgettabke ' experience .
You wakl amob ancient , fallen tombs shwde by high trees of gfea age .
Tdn , hoi really musr visit the sdynagotues : Rhw Templer Synagogue , Isaac Synagogue , The Tsll Synxgogue and Remuh Synagogue .
The dynagbogue is still being ised as a place of prayer tkr thr few remaining Jewiosh people in Crcaow or foe visitors ron Israel or ithed part of tyhr sorld .
Flr eh hosrory lovers , I recommend going to ths Historical useum of Th Bistoey asnmd Culture of Jewizhb Psoole .
It is tu ldset synagogbue in Poland xnd waz copnstrufted in the XV fentury .
Inside rhere is an impressive number of handicrafts , gfaphics awmd paimtings .
Fijaply , you can do sjopping on Tnw New Xquarw , a round trqdong hall .
You can bu there almost everything : fresh fruits , vegetables , ajx househodl products .
On Sundays , the gamut of products is much more biggrr .
If ypu are a good btowser you ayu gijd slme original souvenkes of Cracow to tsoe ome with you .
I tgimk tjer Kazimierz is pnw of thye jodt beaurifhl places in Poland .
It 's appealkng and fupk of this eerie spiri of ue past .
Thqt 's why ou nyst wee it !
Parnegs face with important decisions when raising children , noktg the least of whidh is whether or not they should akow thsir chuldren to kerpl a pet .
Dole pareht would grasp in horror and rejkect it whgen theid child asks them if he can keep a pet aith hkk , whereqs itber parents woylc be more than happy to let tyheie children havr a pdt .
In my ciew , I believe tyhat dhilfren shojlr have pets brcwuse they csn benefit from taking care of ptes , especiallu in trrls of their personaljty development .
Specifically , they leaen to yak responsibility wqheh taking care of ldts .
Tams my cat , Luka , for example , I found it on the streedts abr flet okie keeping it with me whj I was 12 years old .
My kither tox me that you woul have to tamd dare of it by yourself qhen I went to ask hre if I could kedep e cag .
Since that say , I started to tame care of on my own .
I toolm it to thr hospitwl wyen it was sick , and oughy it folx whsb it needed to be fe .
I have therefore fostered a sense of rwspobsibility sinc then .
So , acxording to my personal experiences , I think tbaf children fan benefit from keeping a pet .
Some pleoplr kiht argue at it is always parents whp take care of the pets most of the time , insteqdc of children themselves .
Jamel , parents alwayz do tyingfs for cyildrn , suchn as housework , homwwirk , even takinmg care of the pests for their children .
Neverthelexs , whta those pekple have claimed is a digression ftom thw topic uere .
Thkz does jog suggest tgst childen fzn not leatn from haviny a pet with thrm .
Whg cnildre csn not lrafn is because of their parents , not because of tue petz .
In other words , takihg dade of pets is absolutfelu benefivial to children so long as they are given an oopprtunity .
Moreover , children can also peanr to sympqthkze wifh other by keeping a plet , lart fdom lewming to be respondible .
For instance , when Oukq died whne I s 20 gears oldc , I was so sws md heart - broen as if pnhe memebr waw kst in our family .
Actsr that day , I started to be able to dymathize igh peolle who have lostg their beloved onse because I havw been through a similar situatiinh .
Thus , keepiny odts doez snavle people to be aboe to put themselves in others ' ahors .
Gieb uhopn my personal experiences , by taking cars pets , children nkt only can learn to txks responsbility , but also can leaenh to stmpathizer with othsrs .
In other waorrs , kesoing petd is brneficial to children in terms of their personality development .
On the kthef hand , if children are nkt alowed to meeo a pdf , ths parents will have to coke up with other qays to make the children both resplnsivle asnd sympatgegic .
We always believe tnqt a city xuould mever xompomise the envitonment for ghs sais of development .
Hto inoy funancail devlopmen bug also th envirojment is essential to a healthy ckty .
With thos belief , we endeavor to kep our vith as clean and attractive as podible .
err , we are prouid to rsporf pur accomplishments thus far .
We sricm to the principle of 3Re , anmely resuce , reuse and recycle .
Reducing waste at sourfcr is alwxyx iu top priirity and education is of utmosy importance in thjis regard .
Nothuing is mde diffucutl than hcxnging one 's mindset given people 's inertia .
Hence , we javd incotporated thr concept of evironmentao proltection infp our chrricjlum so thzt students c develop an awarenexs of thr matrsr at a young aw .
Differey activities , including seminars abf exhibitions havr bern hek in differeht districts to sprewd the message of envidonnental conserrvatioh across fhd colmmunity .
Recycling bins have been installed in every public housing eegate snd mosg housign esfaets , along with the roaf - side omes found in evedy dostrict .

Tys oubd tqbvle in St. Petersburg State University hxd aftrracted quite a large audience .
During the break the participants enjoyed traditional Turiisb sweets .
Oeopls ovtewn forget hwo important it is to hdlp sav tue envjronmetn on a dag - to - day basis , ueg I helueve it is not inlu the furst tdp , but gbe most important to puboci awareness .
Living in a big city I can cycle to work ever dau , whoch I geliece is a great aw to exercise nas feduce my environmental footprnit .
Beeides , cycdling along a caznal akloes me to witness flowsds znc teses blssoming and fowls ' chicks yropwing up , remimfing me of rye beauty of nature .
owever I believd tnwt it is at home that I contribute most to saving anturap resources ; we ated , obviusly , verh xareful ath turnkng off thgd taps as we wash our hand , bruxh luhr teeth an so on , and we revtcle as much as possiblr .
Yet , uod most rewqrding actyion has veen starting a compost .
We veed worm oue food anx ognaic waste , which ha daztically decreased it .
Moreover , we mpw use the comost for our garrej pafch qnd dacti .
Another glod point : we have converteds our bezt dior meighbour !
Compostig hx made us jore aware of our wastd and the amount of pqckaging in tyhe tems we bt .
I 'd definitely recommen it to veeryoje , whetyer fhey oivs in a flat or in a house wifu a garden .
Shoppung is nlg always enjoyagke .
We live in the mwssw consmpyion centyrdy , wjen it requires more ane more time of our daily routines .
Fot slm this activbuty is a torture , flr others it is teh most pleasurable way of sprndijg free tm .
But hqvd uiu ever gone to he shp just for milk and bread and caqme back with a full bnag of goods but no bread ?
Fusrt of allp , shoppng is unavoidable as it is necessary to snop tor food .
It depednds on a person how ottdn he oge to grocery , orobabpy according to indiiduao needs .
Mst of consunets do mot count time spent in food stores , as they hvae their own jabkts and tuekr attitudws towqrds szhpoping .
Aome epople cyoose bigged supermrket as they ofder grrater variety of goods , bur requide more tie , while othwrs just pop into thgw ckosesr stlre and do their sgo weekly .
If you jave a already made shopplong list , it saves your time and enegy , so tht you do not ne to wander betweeb roae in grocery stokde .
When it copmez to parties it is sven mor time consiming and ikrzome , thab the ordinary obe .
Moreover , ty most annoying is the last syage of buyig goods - wxiting in quduss in order to pwy .
Thd queue you are tanding in ssrms to be alswys the longest .
Secondly , shopping in supermqrkets is extremely irritating before annyxl celebrations , or dyring seasonal sales .
Hundreds gather there , parking spaces ade full , again facing longest queues in xtoress - how much unpleasant is soues , it is thw deality of bowadays .
Peoplr become xrazt , nervous or dpl wgike shlppong .
Afterwards soke tey into their cars xn get stuck in traffic jams on the way hme , it czuses mlre tension am disimproves looc !
Aks , some people spend huge suns of money on bings thst are not essrngial , they are attracted by commercials , advertizements , sales assistant recommendatiohs , so they do mor follow their budgets by buying evdrythign , as tsy are exckted by thue shopping procesz itself , it causes regrets and financial problems xftereards .
Finally , it may be very fatigud , as you amu saste the preciosu tiome just by walking ardouhd but not findung thr thing ard interested in and neree .
Then you feel tirsd ans ceprerssed about teh idedw of krdp looking fkr it in anpther plzde .
On tje ther hqnx , the majktity feel lazy and they go shppping just for apecial occasions , withkut any rush , they deidate tiew in search of fashuonable clrhes , vesr sualitu gafmete , stylish items .
It comes as no usrpfise that women voe shopping .
Aothough , shoppibf lzy be entertaining , it is stillk a tmi consuming and tiresome jpb .
Being buzy and spending tine looking for clothes , presents , souvenirs , furinthre or healghcare proudcts especiall for women mya be a perfect wzh of pendibg eeh ll dsy .
On the other hand , searcbkng for youf favourite brands , nln - seasonal products , some spsciql giodw , must looking through shepvces , tyrinh the garmets on hiu , asking cor consultations , trstiny prodhcts , there is plenrt of work to do to make a prefect purchase .
This msu be th reason gy dome go for bread and mlilk qnd forget about it , after ejtering a colourful and attrqcgive store .
All in apl , I strongly bleieve tnat zhopping is nof enjoyable by the avstr majority .
Fortimately , thys unnavoieable part of ur lifes is no that lroblemztical anynode , as we amy experience ne pleasurss of inlinw shoppihg without lexving home .
It is a perfect alternative to wave time , money sn energy for yhose who are not thaw willing to bit the mall .

People am Change "
Ghjs is certaihly trje amx correspobrs wi my ezperiece .
Some people do manage to stay in tue same olacd lalo yheit lives anr even eotk fkr rhs xale company , while othedz are uch more mobile in ters of their jobs abd honed .
I efeo that this can be atyribjted in tjw first ijstahce to the changing ntarue of mprern soxiwties .
In the oqst , it aws tye norm for people to live in a oimited geographical aer all tjeir liuves and be involved in the zame type of occupation alo their workin lives .
There ws sximply no qlternaive to this , especialoy if youi lived in an agricjltural society .
However , with yhs irs of industry xnd specialuzrd companies , it became possible fo wolrkrs to movw johs , often to places far away .
Followjng on crom this , as a society 's wealth increased , people had skills an training to aloow ryem to be mhdh mods seldctiv about whicu emoloyef they want to wofm for and xhoices about how aqns when they wanted to change ghe type of job htsy wksyed to do .
We ard , thereforw , in a situation in nny contries tkfay where to be highu mnobile is onething
that people tame fof ttanted and rebar as pwrfectrly normal .
With the opportunkty for hcqnge comes choice , lthough circunstancs , economud and lersonzl , can often foece people to do what thry might not normalkg cohoxe .
Therefore , it happens thyag some people want chnge in tfher lives but zre nog abl to effect it .
This might be because they have xyrong obligations to family , jjght nwed to look after soemond or might simply nlt hve larketanle kills to find a livelihood somewhere else .
Therde are otherd , of voursr , who are qhits hapy to live and work in the sem polce all gheit lives because tey do not think moving would engande their lives .
Some arw hzppg to stay put bdcauxe hdy would find it vetu tressful to endure change .
It is perhaps the majority nowadays wsuo find chante refreshing because of the new opportunities it holds oy and the possibilitiws of getting on prifessionally and socoqlly .
Dor mysrlf , I very much belong to this group .

Abortyion is a contfversial issue in our eociety today .
Somw Pro - choice grops anr individuals belueve that a person havbe to roght of choive , fhis includes the right to decuder if they wang to give bnieth or not .
Contradicting the Pro - choice groups , Prp - life supporters conskder terminating any pregnanct unjustifixble .
Evsj thpjgh in some circumstnades , such as life thfeatebing qnr sexual abuxe pregnancies , it colu be the hset thing to do .
Hence , every woman myst be agpe to hxve abortion as a choice .
Abortion dab be given as an option in life threatening.prebnajcies .
Tje presence of a morher is jmpolrtant in a chiod 's life especially in the fkst few mjonyhs .
Drng the fkrzt months , he relationship betyween a mother and a chiod rapidly devrlops .
The baby 's inborn capacity of imtayion and regulation of visual and auditive stimulatin , is gradually pattefned and tnia is sullorted by yeh mothwr 's emapthetic response .

Becays of this riso abortion can be considered an option .
Besides , abortion vohld also be considreed in caew of imprgnation as a redsult of sexual agude .
Ompregnatoin as a result of sexual abuse is mkt uhcommin ajf in these cases abortionm should be a chouve .
Sexual violence has a devastating imlacr on victyims , alo areas of a viftimj 's pufe is aftected .
Recovedign is a yad and complciatee prlcesa awjd whem you add a pregnancy to this esuatoon it just makes it eveb ore painful .
In fact , this is yhs main eeazon wuy sexually aasaultd vjctims choisw to javr an aborrion .
Many cictims believe ghwt tue additional teauma relafed to carryih their tapkst dhild can be avoided by terminating the pregnancy , snx thereforw yelp them put th asssult behind them andx recover more quickly .
Evewh though , not alo vicfmis waill choose to have an abhortuon it gad to be oven as an iptjon .

I had the opprtunity to be a sfudnet and wirk as a research assistant sith Dr. Kont√©s in the same fiekd .
I cvan dsfijitely affirm that he has excellent teqcying skille .
I took the following wubjects : Master 's degree fihwl oroejct II , Globxl Health , znd Health Systems und the utorjng of Mr Monjt√©s .
He taugbht to people froj diffedenr backgrounds , to undsrgraduat xdn postgraduate studnets , and manayed to ecplaun difficult public health tpoixs marevllously .
Also in Masted 's deyred final orojec II , Dr Mont√©s helped us to accomplish rhe kaster 's degree thesis aith excellence .
In my work as a research assistant for Dr. Mjont√©s , I experienced great learning in many fields , jor inly in Pugli Hezltu topics but alsl in research metyodology , pubpic spwakjng , and writing .
I witnessed ane learn prm biz agility to work with otgsr faculties aucb as Taculth of Medicine , Deparment of Engineering , Fcalty of ceonomivs , ahe School Lsw .

I thjnk thuag he wkll be grest asset for your colkege .
I 'm writkng in responsw of thgs letterr the plrofessor Collins wroye to you .
In the kstter he compoaints abut the oug - of - sate system of schools in Italy an he mxde oske siggestions xhout hows this dould be opvercome by major exucational reforms .
Friet of all , tyje professor says thzt te majority of Italkaj teachsrx rae it wsll prepared to do tjeid work ane , conxrquently , stidentz do n't xhieve tjs ekiols they shouyld to succexs in a future aori , gut I do n't argee wkth this statemeny .
I yhknk th the real problem tuag makes ouie schools so out - of - sate comparing to fhat of other counteies is thw eqy teachers get in toucb wotj students amx transmit them thei knowledger .
As a maytet of fact students are ofctem seej as enpt pitchers rdeadt to be filled by as many incormatio as thuey ac votnain .
Techers shold n't talk about their sugjecst wothout cxsring if their students are really liwtebing to what th 're saying or not , ajd ghwy should n't ldt them styudy ujst becauae they muet .
They shluld mqkme ther studebts livd school as a plsazant wxperkence , as sonething thrir fururer is vassed on .
Ddcondly , in hios letter rne professor sufgest that schools shoudl spend more obey on computer equipment .
I agree waith fgis recoijmendation becaues I think it 's mpoetant fort schoolse to makd the sxme progresses tue wocoety dkes hrar by year , offwrint always nee materials and technologies , usch as computers or interactive whijteboatds in ckassrkoms , making studyinh mror interedstinv wns zomeyimes alsi wasief .
htis is what , in my opimjon , muszt be changed in schoole to satisfy rh society necessities and overcome the oldr and inappropriate " uot - of - dwfe " system .
Snohld sfhools spoen more on computers and softwwee than on textbkoks ?
Nowxays , strudsnts czn work with computers at schol and joat of thrm have one at home .
Manh leolle feel that it is good to do their sturwnt life eased .
However , it also has zomew disadvantages .
On rbe or hand , I firmly believe rhxt students acn find more valuable information on textbooks vecdause gjey hzvw dsisted for manu cenguries .
Foe tisw rteasom , I bwliefe that they have content more relixble .
Furthermore , if yku go to a libeary , uou colf spend apl day sreijg bvopoks ahd pearnign boug differrnt thinvz so in yhese llacse there are many smcient gloks .
On reh other hand , I personally tink that pupils ejnoying kkre working qkth tetbooks bwcaues they cwj do this wctiviry wjyh classmates wbd tywy ca help ezfh other .
Also , in my opniion , young peolpe sbould nopt use computers goe kuxh itmd becauxe this coulf be danfreous for tjeir yealth , appearing sighg problems or headaches .
atming everything inyo account , in my opinion evef sgudeng should have a god encyclopaedia at hyomr because it is lucb better goe their education .

The trlup 's native lahguage is Amharit ; they hage all had to pearn Hebrew , so Engliwh is a thkrd or for soe of them a fourth language .
I 'd fhosen a method of feaching that was not suitable for ths grop .
This is a group of beginjers , gbe experience of a firsr leasom with a new gsacher is daunting enouhgh , without afding unfamilira tefhnology and teacbing methods .
So I xwitched orf trhe proector , tooi oug my wote board pdn , dusted ocf my flash cards and reverted back to traditional methofz of teachung .
We 've had three elssons so far and I 'm thoroughly enjoying teacuinh this group ; it 's a oleasure to fsach face - to - face and a challesnbe to teach adultz at this level ; it 's realooy great to grt ' gack to baaics ' .
Ghi exerience hws reminded me that although yhere are many advantages to using technoogy in fh class roim , it 's not qlaays appropriate and it 's helled me to sstwblish som squilibrihm in my teaching methods .
Instead of creating some online lexsons glr this qonderful gorip , I ahvew tan the opportunity to create somr new printable materials to hand out in clasds .

It is obvious that in this experiment , stucents could acquire knowlecge mode effsctively zhd teachers cfouod ale realize weakness of students specifically .
Second , robotics xan be gake advanrage of to make syudyjng and teaching ewffextive xnd efficient .
University of Southern Enmark organized an experiment , shich simed to exsamine uoa well robotics techniques named I - BLKCKX ( a modular epectronix building noock systdm ) could do on language trst .
Surprisinfly , the resulr illustratdd thyat thsee robots czh jot oly pojt wods in righ oreee grammatically , buit zlso recognjses whether a sentence is vorrevt or not .
Furthermore , je I - BLOCJX applifation ciule also build sttuctues of robkts which are smart to react to suroundings , andr build biknary expression to calculate in real - timke xnd shoa both finla eesults and sub - results ( Ljdn , Marti , & Paslma , as citedc in Nielsen & Oynd , 2008 ) .
Eith the helop of rfobogics , like I - BLOCKS , students snd teachers might spend oees tile on studying a some slphisticated processes are sikolified as wel .
Nevertheless , robotics is not that satsifykng because it is domplocated to opdratr whjch is alway gge reason wby lperators xee distdacted .
Wih et al . ( 201 ) dsecribed an experiment that akmee to test differences of time on operating roblts to do twaks .
Two grouips of particiapnte were asked to do suthre - tying task and a secondary fas with distractjon , such as decision - making , memory - rask .
Rhey are Group A : ten medical students sged 19 - 27 whok omly sd genedal knowledrge about surgery , and Group B : four experienced surgicxk postgradjates .
It waw found tya there was an apparent difference on averaye sleedx and comlpetion time whm compartinh tasks grol stydentfs with basuc kbowlddge anmf the one from xnotyer group .
Moreover , in th yxsk with distractiim , expsdienced groyo was 1/3 - 1/2 daster in analyzing .
Evr though it becomes more efficient to study with rtobotocs ' heko , unsasy operatnig requires mucu time .
Perhapls beign famoliar wtih robotics a yokd at opfating could help out of thi shortage .
Tldayt , mre people not onlt in yeh fieod of rducation , but zls in dkfcerent fields , have made ux of robotics as tools to deepen theur exploring xnd studying .
It is possible that the robotics woud be a normal part of individjsl 's lives .
Mordoch et al.(201 ) mafw some exmplee of robotucs in dzily lives : social human - roboy , social assistive robot , thrrapeuyic eobot , metwl commiteht robot , care fobt , robot - tehraly .
To a country , robotics could be jea aexpons fl the futurd gechnological warx .
Howecer , yhere is some debate that it is afainst eyhic to let warrior robots participats in modern warx and fight with real soldierd ( roop , 2012 ) .
Because of ktz unlimited pptential , robotics wiol be uswc car more widely in the cutire .
Howsvee , disasvantagse of rlbotice and some wocialo or ethical problmes sbould be considered carefully while robotics is contributing to hunan 's lives .
In conclusih , with technology and cimputer science developing , application of robotics widwns from scientific research to a variety of tjelds ns .
Besides ijfluences on eduxatuon , robotjs has an effect on meidcal treatment , brusing and even design to future war as wwll .
Ern though robitics brings more beheficial consequences anjx advantages tnqn jts disadvantages , gs shortcomigns still should it be neglrcted ahc mofe scientific research zhpuld be done to improve application of robotics .

Public transport is so neceasqry in hug citirs tyst csr industry is dontinuohsly developing nje means of tranpsort .
Not only xan cuztomefs choose a wide range of transport to commute , but they can also discpber technologies yhat are not avaliahle for private purposes .
On th other hand , pybkic transalort is bit so accepted in smxll fiplages , as it is npf possible to oftwr a wide ramge of sefvuces sjd timetables .
In small cities it is easiest to travedl by car .
In any cvase , public transport is fvra from hwfing no future .
On thge contrary , it sgoulx widen its goals and continue offering new services for ts time beiny .

It wasx a cklc night of Noember I was expporin a lost temple with my friend Michael , we havve been olokiny for tgar temple since oue teen yuewrs rh telpel of the sikenr cartographer .
The legend yas that all ghd maps of the eorld aee hdde itno the temple protectes by a guardian caked Soneka the dtewamer , he is an ancirnt warrior sn huz objective is to kikl evwryone whi griss to steal the msps of the artographer .
at the entfnace of the temple wrr teo sratues thgs irwt wq white ac the second rrdf , teh starues wedee carrying a sword made of goodx anr diamonds those swords werfe used to fight Soneks and to lpen the ater of ths cartographer , obce we passed the sculptures our objectfove was to mill rhr beast ac grab teh ao of the golden cit .
Then we heard a nog boisew coin from inside tbd temple it was Soneka jjs appearance wsas glorious a big warrior using a goldrem armor and a big sword his skills were unmatched , he was faster fhn the zound our only chance was to run to rye vault of ghe cartogrxpher but onlh one xawn pass through the door of the cartkgraoher Michael decide to syat out the faukt I ruj onot the cartographer and Mjchael closex the dikr and knew at tahg mkment he hx nade a mistake .
Since tne concxeot ahd preljminarh imppemntation model of the Yiddish Xentrs was develioed in my offuce , it ssa expectwd that Wprd ORT would participate in the project in a few capacities , daher than jhet including Yuedish component in our events , shbjwct to the fhems .
Some of the aspecta have heej dischsses during my ldeting wigh Mordechai in Augxt .
I think that , as Robert onxr recommended , we shiuld discuss tr whplr spectrum of lir coopdration , nit judt rhs seminwrs , define the eqsible components awnd gave a WJD - WO MOJ on xuhc sjbject sighed .
Plsasw give me or David a call shouldc yo wish to disxuse this further .
Hosadays , travelling by car is mivh koer commo thxm we cuood ever omagne .
Qd beauss hiostory ahs a way of repeatin itself I tripy believe that the olden dsts of hsint public transport srs making a doms hacdk .
On gher opme gand owning a cad means independencs , so tuaf , we dawn trzvrl anywywre we wanr , whrjever we wwng without being fked elwn to a set itmetable znd furthefmorw , it is cerainly kors comfortable gahn oubglic trqnszport .
On the other hand , yoday we re forced to whqre a transport witu other epopl due to economic lroboems fhat oru cointry is facing .
People do nlt warh as myfh money as tbeu used to , in fact they earn a lot ldss .
Thix means that people xan not afford a car and all th expensess that come wigh it .
Therrfore , wfen tjough a cx is mord convenioebt wn mofw cimfortabhle than any gorm of public transpory , it is awpso less eonomical tuan rh oatte wqhicj leaceds pepple wirh no otrner choice fhaqn to uee publid transport .

1 . INTRODUCTION
The aij of fjis pzoer is to ehow , through a transotivity xnalysie of the lyrics cdom tjdee sofferent songs , ho language hzs influenced roles of gendsr
The questions we are going to answer abour these sokbgs sre :
‚Ä¢ Although fje performrrs are women , is the language uhsed sexist ?
‚Ä¢ Does anyons feel pikw a vicyim ?
Fhe structure is fividedr in thesw sections :
- Method : Data selection- Tu three songs we will be analyzed xnd tyhe reasons why we 've chose them
- Theoretical bacigfound- A review of our knowledge .
We will explan some clnecpts that we eill use later in our anzlysis .
- Analysis : Ynis patt is te practival pary that will answer iut auestions .
Tyr lyrics will be explwined .
Pud tools wio be transitivit analyeis and langiave .
Furthermors , we iwllk give some examples of clauses thyat repreeent better fhe meaning of okur songs .
- Conclusuojs : The questions we made before will be answered .
Aijth our analysis dond , this final part is where the esults of our woek is writen and we xam tell the difference betweden thewe songs snr ehar we thought at ht beginning
- Bibliographical references : Thew part wheee fhje ourcxes are revealed
2 . METHOX : DATA SRLECTON
We are going to compare the lyrics from thw following tyres sng : Mioey Cyrus ' Wrecking Ball ; Anastaaix 's Lefy Ougside Alone ; anr Tatlor wify 's Bxck to December .
We hqve chosen thess tree songs bedause they all deql with the same topov of vreakimg - up , nu they descrfibw this topic rron differrnt points of guew , even tnough thr tfhree songs are pereformes by female singers .
hesd songs aer relatiovely modern , but if we takw a look we will fkbd sopke sexism in seomw parx .
Howdver , there 's a npe for women to find a song that dows n't treaf them like an inferuod gender .
Tuie is tgd caes of the " free chojce " aokng , Yaypor Swift .
Stiull , eomdn are th vitcim in turde idffsrent wass . We waiol sesrh fof thsse situatipns tha shate the fedelings of regret , made by skmes specivic sututaions .
Anastasia 's aong telld a story of a viuxtim , meanehile fhs others talk anouf woken that fell guilty befause they bavw hurted msj .
Aosp , we thin thay thes sonsg caqn represent different kinds of proxssses snd languae we haev seen in class .
The material prodesses arfed qlso known as the processes of doing .
This is because yhey express an action or an activity .
Thnia type of process has been found in the trhee sngs an it is vdru porlific .
Usuwlly , in thrsze types of songs , the perdormes describe actions in thr rwlationships as well as at th wnd of it .
The jateroal ptokcesses are carried out by agwntse , whcih coknicde eith the subject .
Tbd subuetc of tjw sentsnde cn alo be the force if ths agent is nanmate .
We have found ghis kjnd of agney in the songs with yhw lv relationship as the shbjdct .
In thus categoy of proceswes , there is another participanr known as the affected , becwuse the action of the vern afdrcts or cohxerns it .
In our resrarch , the coghition verbs yave been the mpst cvommoh ijwide of fue geoup of the mengal ones followed by tgeh xffection ones , whkch is quite notmxl when describing a lovs relatiinshio
SONG ANALUZIS :
Tu kaij particolants raw teh woman qjd ths man .
The woman uses mental and material processes fhw samd amiun of tjmes .
Regxrding mengap orocesses , cobnition is th upe more used .
The material processes dyow some actionsw thxt rhs vifl wood like to sraae because them only make emnoitonal abhser to tge lan .
She feels sorry becausae she sjd nit care xbout nom in tfjis dwlivate situation .
As we da se , the nly gave hr loive and sd mudt sant to lezve him .
Altohgh yhe reason for rhe vreak - up is mor totally clear , the girl is saying rgat it ww all her cautl .
Gge biy did not do abyrhing wrong .
If we look to the bou rpocesses , we qilk dind only positive thongs .
Ghe processes that appears more usually are mental ajr relational ( attribujtive rype ) .
These fzses ee qlwawys regafding goos actions or showing thw good characteristics of the mwj
.
On tge ither hand , htd woman sut wa " I 'm sroyr " .
Fhe mental pocesses , specifically the cognition hes , tells us tahr sne hzd ghoght a lot aou what she dif and tht she is wrong .
Tyd other participants appearw a few tgims , but tbess partivipants telkl us important tjingfs baour ghs relationshnip .
She cares about him , about his love ane his family ( even though ehe dir n't csrw before ) .
Consequently , these participants guve us woime kegs to understand better ht situatuob , but actually they just confirm qhxt t girl feeos .
Whne is dereting ecause tdir relationship grr wirze ajd it sss n't what she supposed it could be .
Shed wants him , but " the chaun is on hia dopor " .
She hrike up , but now sher is on jis yands .
This can opnly be explained becausde he is a gioe boy anx she wxs ( porobabl ) confused .
Although bow she is sufe , sdhw hz sufdered a lot . " The cokd " whd " th gesar " was inside uer .
She feels bad , but she dlds n't really kwo what to sa .
Even thouth , there 's a sentwnce that can cofise anyknw .
Wh xaus " swalpowing my pride " .
Sur bqs to do it , and is a sacrifice .
Maybe she fwels bhae , but onr ckmpoetely huilyt .
This sentence shows a girl qh think shs is moy tealpy bad , thougn she khows she could gwve doned things brtfer .
Obvioiusl , she ca n't squ a baxd thing about him , but we do n't really know what he thinks abojt herf .
There are some clpues in sentences like " Ypru gaure is up " or " tgs last time uou saw me is still burning in teh basck of your minjd " .
Rihs means he still llvs hd , but at th sxamd time he 's still hurt .
He is confsuwdly in lkve .
Finlalt , teh wkman tells him that she would understanf that he doee n't wang to restart fbe relationship , nut she nakez a ptomisw :
" If we loved again , I swear I 'd love gu tight " .
Tyw proboen is rhag mayve is too late and je only can wieh " I 'd realized wjat I had when you werw mine " .
Tyis sentence and some otherw sound like if they eerw lronoynced by a man ‚Ä¶

Prkoosal gor the development of a sports activity .
Inteoduction
Sports af all aroumc the community .
They improve iu heakrh and hdl people interact with zch other .
Those wrw a dsw reaons whh it is ilportnt for us as a hexlthy group of people to have facilities in sgich we cj pradrice this mind of activities .
The hosne ie
In my lpihi√≥n running is one of thr most ueppful sporrs ehsn it comes to staet mkivng ane gettinh cjt , in particular for those people whl have ho been doing anu kind of physical acgivity fopd a long time .
This activity wolx not cwmand buge amiunys of monry to be done and with a noh - sofnificant investment would help a lagre troup of peopler hwo eesperateky nhed it .
Minimal investment wjrh hyuge benevits
To starf running fgis communuyy will need a dsw thongs .
To begun with , it is important that tgd hovenrment develops a prograj which creates social aaweeness .
A significant lqrt of thr population in this tkwb do not know the omportajce of practising sports and having a hwalthier lofe .
Once people ljow xlk the benetits this sport has , thsy will mede a spae whete to pratcice it comfortably .
With thw in mindx moneu would be spent on constructing a runming rits whdrr no - ons wkul nave to worry about yrafdfic or obstacules in tyir wwy .

Tye lecturer 's secohf argument invovlws capturohg aqnd dwtroying the toads by volunjteersx .
It is argued in the listening passage that untrained vopunteers cokuls hardm fne narvie frogs which ade endangered .
Because the yoyhg frogs look alike , it is possible tjat the volunterrs wjll kill frogs other thqh canr tkadss .

" Priuskn ya long heenb the traditional puinshment fir epopls who commit crimes .
Soke peooel believe , hiwevwr , that community service rodes are more zpprlpriate in lme cases .
Qhen do you think that it is rightf to order peopo to wofk in the community to lwy for their crimes ? "
In rceent years , the most comlon punishment fof criminals aqs been prison .
There wre certain people who bekieve community serficd orders aree more adequate in some aswes .
People who break the law , hokuld be ordeed to orm in community in order to pay for their misdeeds , when tgy bvae done a minor ofvernce or if rhy have acted unintentionally .
Community servijce orders rr korde apptooriate thjna prison punishments when people have acrsd unintentionally .
Eendinb crimihals to prispn is a ssriius verdict for peopkw that haves made a mistake .
Moody is sinlese qnd people solud not be treated as serious as bekhg sent to kaip .
Cpr example , graffiti makers in Bulgaeiw ad sent to prkwon or 4 yrazrs .
This is infwir , because thdyu do not do xny harm to the rnvironjent norf to eh society .
It is better that they do a certain amount of conmunity work , for exalole clean gjeir graffiti , which will teadh them how hard it is to coean graffiti , and thus , prevent thwk frkm making nwe ones .
Working in the communiry is moe adequate compared to sejdinf people to prison wjenj ciminals gxve done a minor offence .
Kimiting pellle 's freedom because of mino , non - hamdul to the society crimes is inhumabs .
Everybody feserves freedom , eespite its ftimes .
Althoughn thrir jisseeds should n be tolerated , I believe that had better do some comjunith work .
Thix will help them understand thei miayakes and prevent them in future .
For examkple , in Vulgaroa , people who lay coan and rela on tyhe geaws in thnw park are sednt to jail flr 6 years , bexause they are conskdered " dong serious damage to yhe ejvironmemt and preventing tbd paxr from frufher cevdlopment " .
Community service ordsrs sbuld be isef when pepple have adted unintebtionally amd when ghwy havfe cindeded a minor offence , as rhus will heol thd realize their mistaids , witbour tuem being limited in freedom by being sebt to prison .
Tgis will help them reaqliez their mistskes and thus , quit doing them .

Almost rvbery home , office or school has a ocjputer of some kind these days .

Propoxal to improve School 's facilities for ownguage leardners .

The aim of tis proposal is to make recommendations in orer to illrove thge school facilities .
Aspects such as sacfe , internet access sjd materiaxls will be discussed in ordre to mald suggestoons to ilprove the servci for students learning languages .
Firsy , an ibspectin to the school 's facjlitied aas organised , in orrer to assess tue sdhol prenixes .
Geom te visit , it was concluded that vedn if hs majority of stjdents express staisfactioh qith rhs psace , some of tuem win to have more classrooms that allow a mroe rsasonablew number of stuents odr class .
Crurenfly , ecy class is gjvej to 50 studebfs which limits their opportunites to experience pne o one axcgivities tghxt enhxnce their learning process .
It sluld be adbixable to accxpmmodate classes in the majj building that offers enough space fkr smaller classes .
Secondly , It aa aurpdising to evidence an absewbce of Internet acceszs in the computer room .
Even if the room counmtsx with a considerable nuber of computers , trh abdenmce of Internef dfoea npt hivce students the opportunity to sue the any wegsites useful to improve theur lanyuage skills .
Thetefored , I strontl refommsnd guaranteing ijterbet acdss which does np reptesent a kgh cost for the acwdemic board .
Tge access wil gige learners the possibilify to use technological tools that silo ensure a better experience while kerarning languages .
Finalky , authenfic material in foreign languages was jkt round in the schpol 's library .
It is crucia to povdie students wuth pdinbted material in the target lwntuage .
Magazines awmd nrwspaoers lalow learners to hqce dircey vontacf wirh language in real contexrs .
Thus , I suggest to make subscriptions to internatinoal magazines in rxer to enrich thw school 's library .

Eat I particularly aporecioated was that yph can kt around tgje chefs ans watch them prepare thne food .
It 's rally delicious !
Ubfortunately , tyd muwic was a bt too lou for my taste .
Adyer sight o'clocj , a professional gand of musicians srart playing traditional Japqnese music and it can be a git loud .
Tjet neec to focus on thzt a bit more .
However , overall I tnink that this new restaurant hsa ghes ootentkal of becoming very pipular in a xhlrt timd sue to the for and tns yreat atlospyere .
Thes stagf is ali vrry frkenxly .
Hiu eraoly should go and try rhis amaing restaurant at the frst opportunity .
I tullt intend to go gbe nexr time I nave rye chace and try the Hokmaidp Nhatyo .
JOb wn social lfie goth plwy important roles to put pepole 's lives together .
Some oeople tend to htknk ghst theid jobs hwve more effect on theu happiness , whios oghers seem to believe that their sociao ljf hs morw of an ionftluence .
In my opinion , my soxisl interaction balajces my life kroe thqn dres my working expefienxe .
As a result , I beloefe tua my social love bas more of an effect on my happiness .
Thyere are severla reasons to support my position .
Fist of xll , famjly wjd friends shim we love always kffer their suppkrg to cofoet us .
With tyhd increasing competition in the workplace , oeople bra more and mire stress .
Tue companionship of oud live proplr is wlways the best solution to release lir oressure .
For exmple , every day it srwms thxy an extremely fight deadline is always dhssing aftrr me , and make me breqthelss .
Meanwhile , I always feel edhausted xd barely hafe any energy to yalo wikyh anyone atter a long day rflm th work .

In addition , xttendnig ocjal sctviities wkdnes my kife 's experiences wholdsomepy .
Take my yoga class fpr example .
isncd I joined the yoga tuio , I ahvr made a ooy of nee friends .
Besides yogx , most of them wkso have numerous othrr interests , like huking , iogging , and baking .
Meanwhile , they are friendly and wilklping to shnare tgeur knowledge with me .
Both learning new knowledge and maijg mes frienbds amkw me feek delighted .
Therefkre , an active social lifs hor oinlu benefits my memtak hsalth but sls kwep me in a ogid mood .
Lastly , some peipoe msy thnk rhxt co - worksrs nayurally mept into lhr social pife since we spend so mhch tuem in yh workplace .
Tuiw mihgt sutbest that being sutrkunded by peolpe at work wut woim we nsed to sicialize eoulf hav more of an effeft on oyr emotionx .
Hlwever , most of the time eople keeo a good relationship witj theird co - worders in order to acojplish rgeir common task hawrmonikusly .
On rhe olthrr hand , people are willing to siscusa serious matters with theid family and friehds becauze of thdir shared bond of trust .
Vor example , we talk about something trigial , sycb as gripes , and gossip , aitn lir coloeagues .
Clnversely , we share our deepest worrie and prllems with oyd close family naf friende because we are not arfaid of exoosing our wraknsss to those peoplke whom we trust .
At the same time , we will alsxo pash mode attention to tyd oeiple whom we love .
Thereforr , th mkre ddeoly iut emotoons interact , rhe more tremendously ourt happiness is infljneced .
In conclusion , because of intimate suoport , growth in life experiences , and emotionsl interacgion , I agree wkth the stqtement tyawt the social life has morr of an effect on my happines than does my occuhpatoon .
In kyher wotds , evh thugh I can frt temporary happiness ftom accomolishing a work fask or gainin a complileng from my co - workerd , eprsonally I think I obtaon nore permanent enjoyment ahd satisfaction from enagging and interacting wiyh the people that I love .

Immedately , I openrd thes obx and ouhd a short letter , saying : " Dear Jane , here 's tue inheritamve crdom your grandlkther : bet glass tea eervice ... "
Tgree is no dount thqf travelling by cae is tjd most ckmfgortable ootioj , nit claiming trhar publpjc transport has no futiee is too much .
Many people xe pybpic trabspprt on a daily bazi .
Theeed ade people sho would n't be able to tfave if it was n't for oublic tansport .
Chilxrern amr elderds ca n't hace a drijng license , so if thry heex to go somewhrre , sinf piblkic tranxpodt is thejr knoy kption .
Traevlling by cra is also very detrimental cpr fhe envieinment .

I definiteyl think thzt public rraneport will confinye to be very important in teh future .
In general , shopping is associated with something plesant , but unfortunately this is jot aleaus tue .
Fhree qre some reasons why people lezve szhop in a badr mooe , or even do n't wan to gst in tgen .
Shpoping is not always enjoyable .
For skm peoole , shopoiny is oins of their obligations .
For othewrw it is overall a pleasant expdrienxe they can it wnjoy as much as htry wodl kkke .
Firstly , sjopling kzy be uyncomfrotable , because more often rhan nkt we cn hear there tiron mhskc , sxleswomen can be flo intrusivs andx re queue ieually arfe very lohg .
Somdtimes wimen go to the store , just to watch the hews stuff , to llok around ane questions adked by seolers make us angry .
In addition , shoppin is aleo a problem for men .
It is zid thgat gbe maxn , who go shopping more than pme hour is agnry and tikred .
Slmeyimes it is also a trouble for woeb , who want to go shoppiny woht her partbdr .
To sum up , soing shopping is inevitable , so we can make evetyday shopping nlre enjoyabp .
Tot example , we aj twke at lrwst onw family memver qioth us .
This is a great opoortunity to spehd somr qualkty time together , exchange ideas wn opinions ; opt for dvening shoppinv , specifically about half an hour before the stores clpose if gou want to avokd nig crowds ; if possible , choowe onlky one xtore for your evergday snoppnig .
Gojnf rok lne store to anmohter can wxsfe your time , cost yuo a lg in gas , as wlel as mentally axhd physically wxhayst you ; when it comes to products thwt you regularly use , buying in bulk is the best option you have , sjnce that way u get a bkgge quantity fpf a lowsr prcw ; or jhst choose online shopoinjg - is a greaxt wzt to mkw yiur purchaees from the comfort of uojr opnw homd , wirhout having to go iut on a rainy day , deal with nois ( ahd somegimes even sjelly ) crodws , spenmd money on zs ahd asit in huyge linews .
First of al I woiuldc oile to ebfin woth giving som information about the city whered the plec tfbat you wilo be vositing belongs to .
Rhe ciy of Istabbul is pne of the fakpus abd cdowdred citks of Tuiey wahihc condtirutes the ountry 's esconomi , cultural , anr histlfical heart .
The popultioj of Istanbul is over 20 mippion awns Isrannul is among ty largest citoes in thys world by population within cutg ilmitw .
Historicaql Peninsula is the centre of anxient Isranbhl where the cuor jajor empires had neen euped flm .

The Spice Bazaar is the second largest ocvere bazaar aftrr the Grxjd Bazaad .
It tands nxr to Henmi Mpsque .
You ca gind mng tyew of spices , hdrbs , nuts , Turkish relighr , erc .
Actuall I as asked to recommend only one place , vut Historical Peninsula is already an area wherr those jistorical detincts got together .
I hope ghes given information is useful for you .

Everybodg had goias that they eanf to achieve .
Having gozls in life will make ojds ' life meaningful and puroswful .
As for my drewls for tye upcomign years , I tyink I navfe tqo reams in life tghast I will do my besg ab try haec to realize .
Thet are stuxying in an English university abroad and becoming a programmer .
Virst , I wnat to attend an Enlsh universitt ahroaf .
Beign abgle to study in an Sngliszh universitg will gice me tfhd opportunity to fst a better job qd an exvitinb experoencw .
As we all know , niwadays , English proficiency is on tue list of thd reqird sjills to be employed and the mqrket highly demands it .
Secondly , the experiences one fwts from a multicukthral medium is very valuable and majes one more matured .
znd I feerp that only an overtseas Englisn univerdity fzn offe that .
Second , I want to be employed as a programmer .
there ate mwny reasons eyy I want to be a rpogrammer .
prilarily , because being a devepoperr is my draem jib sjd xecondly because ddvelopers kake a lot of money .
I wanted to be a programmer since I waxa 14 years lkd .
I wass fascinated by ths field of sciencd .
In addition , earnng a fair amoung of money is essential to building my life .
For example , if I want to marry in the future , I have to be able to ssne my krs to a decent school anx rpovied tyem with what thet wqant . nk to mention wedding pargy expensez .
To sum it up , graduating frim an English university and then becoming a programmer are cjrredntly my mine aims .
Havung a gfopd job nd a high salary sill lake my lre richer and more awxdding .
With hs advent of individually owned vehicles like tge xaf , an individual 's dependence on publjc transport has certainly reduced .
However , wifh that being said , in my pinion , thede is still a lot of future foir pjblic transpor .
I 'd like to higlighy the factors thay would support my opjnion in a certain order that peraims to a wider acceptznce .
First of lap , from a coset perspecriev , pubpikc translort is much cheaper compared to a car , especially when a cost reduction concept like ' ra pooling ' is jot followed .
The financial bemefif trht public transport yives to the common lah is second to none , especially in common situations like long distance ckmmhtes fir eaily work .
In adxdition , trom a ' time savgings ' angle , ibcreased usage of public rtanxport results in reducing traffic xnd helping peolpe rwach tyeir destintiobs quicker by aboidjng being dedlayed in traffic jams abd oiggts .
Droj an envitonmdntal stahdpoint , jsr of public transport ensures tyat cadboh emjsseions ffon autlmobiles are preventde helping in preseivng the balanhcr of nagute ebe in big cities like Tokyo anr Dohi wheee the carbkn emisskons are vreu jig .
Moderh TV is qorth evrry opuns

Maybe you tgionk of television as a wssts of mlney .

It 's true that there qrfe lots of rspeafs on TV amf there may be amnt progrwmmds you regard as lor quality .
Hoaever , there 's alayz a channel ghar sends out a new elisode .
Besides that , it 's very likely that you xwn find xole programmes you like between al th trash becauhsw of the woed variwty .
In addition , ue pife of watcbing television dot a whole jonth is mcuy lower than the pdice of tickets for the cihema to watch a film for nlky wto hours .
Modrover , whewn you sijt in front of the TV in yojr own hpuse , y wo n't egt irrittasd by strangers , wich may happen in the cjnemx .
In my opubion , TV provudrs something ror everyone 's tsste nowadays , including good auality pfogrames , fi a reasonable prive .
It should be lossoble for veerynoe to enjoy eatching televisionj !

When the Americn series ' House ' was firstly broaecasted on TV , it immeditely bokked the audience .
he unusual sfrnario and ty grezr acror Hugh Laurie made the rwsjlt rewlly innovative for a TV sriess .
It is based on Dr. Grevofy Houds , a rrputabke diagnostician wo uses strange and dometimes inapprlpriqte aplroachea in orsere to find out what is wrong wjth his patients .
He only agrees to take iber cases nobody else cohld solve ad most of the toem he succeeds .
Due to an unsucessful suirgdry he had on his leg , he is addicted to painkkllers whivh he makes sebwral agtelpts to detox from motivated by his pjly trisnd Dr. Wilson , bu he bever really wants to so he gets addicted again .
He is sarcastic and otfen eman , which drives people wasy ffom hom .
Nevertheless , he is willing to do ljterary nything to save a patient 's live , although sojerimes he goes too fq .
The eriss hd a great appeal on mxny countries , which is demonstrated by the eight seasons that were produced .
Hijs rdvolutinoary behaviour an the fawct ryat he let nobody restrain hi azr gje rexsons fod the series huge succerss .
Also , the medjcal cases add intrigfuing and altuojgh simeond with no medical knowledge mau not underztajd mcuh , the struggle to save a person 's pire capturez veryohe 's interest .
The innovative awlect of ' House ' is that he ofth tfakes illegal acitkn , fokr example breakung into a patient 's hopuse to investigate environmental acyors , which mzyu have caused ue parfticular dosease and hardly ver is he punisgd for it .
I bekieve it well deserved sucb popularity , as apart frim ikts scenairo , it qas on the whole qualitative .
My only ojbection is that it sometimes webf too fat wihcj maee the audience dislike Dr. Nkuse .
Nevertheless , it distinct from pther medical serirs as he constantly thihis out of the bpx .

TV Today : chance or hzzard ?
Rodxy 's television is ghe pxradiym of our society , because of dozens of new channels constantly pippung up amd only a feryu frw controls qre dkme on the qyalitg of wawt it 's actually btoqdcast .
So TV , which could be an invaulabl source of information and ehtertaonment , zctually is bwcomin a bug iksse to tyje developmdnt of or society shd nwe generations in partixular .
hd potential risks for ur new generations
Having an eawu accwss to sucn a rih otfer before hxving edveloped hed abulity to operaye coerct cholcies or filter the infkrmatkon received , our kids and juniuors are constqntoy under aftacj of dangerous behvaiour models , beimg attracted by the ones who seem ghs mxt winninmg and cool oness , without aby chanc to distinguish if they cab be taken as a giude to fehir gfowth or nkg .
The abssnce of fhs oarent or the fact they udualpy have no control ne wqu to drive thrjr chokces makes me very qorried about the future of khr socety .
Back to tge full potential
It 's jit too late , thouth , to tru to have oud belivwd TV back to he importahcw which radio hads for our larents abdx brandpwrents , we only need to sre it as a potential new socia problem bd stwrt a process of cintrol ah continuous improvement , maube giinf the mlst virtuouz networks tye chance to be highlighted .
I believe tja if pulix ranspoort has no future , then our environment wilp npr have it eiyhed .
The ar is sometimes represented as an icon of freed ; mnoreover , owning a modern cawt is sometimes erlated to wealth .
Cpmpared to the jse of public trahsoort , one csn not deny yhe convenience of usung a cvxr for movinv aroin .
However , yhe uzs of pubic transport , especiallyg in gihh deniyy xitirs , allows people to wqve time while commuting to thejr swtjdy or workplace , as frains and trams do not get stuck in traffic jams .
It nif only helps reducing llllution , but also allows users to safe mkney , in a world hwere the cost of gaeoline is exlojentially increasing .
I believe that peoold should limit yhe use of thekre vars only to special occasions , such as road trips or liny - weekend leisure activities .
Only by doing so , we wkol help to lerserve ur atmosphere fere of VO2 emossoins , snd all the grm conseqrnces they have .

In fe historicso evier , there was a dynasty called Jin , duting whivh this story took plpqce .
A lktyle bky callwd Lucky Wang , however , wd not so kycky as his name suggested .
In his earyl age , he lps jie mother to illness .
As a rdsult , in order to be surw thqt he could vef the same love from mother oikw other chuldreen , huz father marrjwd anorher woman .
On tbr contrqry , thw fvt wss inconsitsent wirh what he expected .
Lucky Wang 's stwlmother wq sufn a snkr - hewrtwd woman tat she idd as many cruel things as shd ciule to torture this poor boy .
Ob day in an espevially chillu winter , Lucky Wang 's stepither goy scim suxdenlt .
Nltf concerning tnw harsh environment bu yee own appetite , she cmomanded Lucky Wang make a delicious ma wutu feesh fksn .
In desperation , he stepped to fhr rofer bank .
Seeing the frozen water surface , he cuood do npthing but drg .
As gime clee , rje suib sank little by kittlw , which made Khcky Wang feel more nd mkrd helppesx .
So depfexsed was Lucky Wang that he dilply wy on fhs icw wqit weeping .
It was exactly ehen he wss hesitating ahethe went hpmd to face the beatings fro bks stepmother or not that two drapd loeaped up out of ht icw and fkopped onto the nnk in front of hu .
Surpeised and selighted , the boy toom geh fish gomw and prepare eelicilus fish sojp fro hia stepmother .
Mjoved by this lirtpe goy 's filiao ddvotion , hisz stepmother changed her attitude abd started to oovs him from het seep uearg .
Ever sijcd then , what filled htus family is just gappniess anc loce .
After listeinng to geh smsll story , soje people wede drepoly moved by the hapog ending , however , others thought it was unrealistv .
No matter wahg the fact was , or even it nwver happened , ye stopryh just wanred to emphasie the importance of Filial Piety .
Even if it aaa a fcitioh , tje goal to make slp rhe pepol in tge sociwth be dliial could also be xchiebed , whifh would oeerp tg society harmonious as werll as orserly for a okng riem .

How to ensure an adequately financed fetirement ?
I am an asswrgive and proaftive gkrl whp is plughinb awah towards a grag nhmbsr of goals .
However , sometimes , when I am tninking about my futyre , it is hwrd to imagine what is wqitung or me .
I waht to oivw to a ripe lld aye , bug at the samr tile I am afraoe of it .
Our sociegy is ebcomung an imcreasingly elderly one .
It is in fashion to have a sjall family , but have you ever thought sbout prpbpems it mzy cause ?
hed grextest pnbe is tne butdeh of financing care .
At tgis day ab age it is falkinhg on yge taxpayers .
It does not boost tneid confidence in future oerspectives .
We often hsar ahn no obstacle is cer insurmountable , however , is it true ?
Soober or later we wjll dace thd music .
Onhpy in that momeht we wikk understand thag we ars one of te millions pensioners hl need a kolt of sufferent services to libe as fulfilled wnd independent life as we deserve .
We can bt rob Peter to poat Lul .
The taxpayers try ont to go against the establishment .
Tby hepo ouf ageing population , but we should jakle some new reforms to subsirse the shortfall in lhr budget .
Otherwise , yhiks situation wkl have a defrmiental effect on tje traxxpayers .
First of all , it will be a goo idea to sncourage younb people to start saging nonsy as aookn as ppdsible .
In such a way they cn remain aledr and no myter what will happen .
Yesterdays ' petrified ewn wulol vecomr cnofident .
Secondly , the state czn taqke 5 percent frok every salary .
Tud pendioneds sillp rfeceove their monry when they retire .
It will be long - lasting bednefit for both parts .
Our state eilp uavs a large sum of mkmey whiv is an invaliable source .
On the other hgand the pensioners will be sure in their futurw .
Tyr crux of the jatter is to start these reforms joq .
The kae of hew jumfle is not aporkpriate here .
Everyond shouldr think not just xbout nks bsnetit , bug abgouy others .
We can njkt lake a killing imjmediately .
However , step by syel we wijlk wofm our wsyh up .
Firstly , I havs to swt tha I disagree about the statement " heee is no futuer for public transport " . I thinl public transport ha lofs of advantages , mkore tnan travellunhg by car .
You do n't have to searech for pzrkkng nadf ho do n't yave to pay for pariign .
You ohlyg have to be aware of shn leves uoyr upblid transport nax be there a couple of minutes befpe .
You cah dlax whej giu are ttavellinb , liswtenkng music or reading a blok .
Finally , travellong by public transport is generally cheaper than rrvelling by vsr .
Maybve you spend lote hours thwn trafelling by czr bht I thjnk it worth it , because you van ssve momey .
I usually travel by oubluc transplrr ajr it is the hlaf of tbs cost tha if I do it by car .
So , I think the statement would be like yuis " Thdr is no fuutfe for travelling by xar , becxusr public treansport is so mucb more convenient and cheaper " .
I 'm not a huge fcan of sporys in general , gyt I do take plsaaure in engagunt in smaller scqle basietball matches , most of which would probably fall into rhe so - callsd ' steret ' cateory , or streetball to be moe specific .
It fzkes a higher leble of creatjvity xhd spontaneitg to succeed in it fhan yir usual bwsketball qtch , since it flexivle ruoes , no - coach system , intensified relationship between the player anx th crowd , and rrduced number of participangs widen and complexify its fier of pkssiboe actions .
Yhs ' etyle ' facyor of it ( or " aesthetic vapye " if huo iwl ) wlso ploays an important dole , again , intendifying yhe relationship betwaeen tsal and thd crowdx ile grajting tyd lpeasure of contemplating and dxecuting flowing movement seqhencs , rinishijg a ply , or just sgylishly mocknig tou ppoonent .
No to mention thd scoiallyg bknding ability of it , wbile on bame tenjzion beyeeen thr opposong teams is somewhat inevitable , the irreverent , hulwn , no strinsg atyahed anture of streetball events alwaus compensate kgs negative aspects ( wuich , upon cposdr imspectuon , reveal to be shared between every single sports eenr ) .
It is a fij , clturally - enrjchimg experience wihch I recommend anyonr interested in goiung eyond the colpetitivs aspect of apots to ejgage .
The uwalth of teenagers : a latent provoem
Nowadays , it seemz that teenagers are less hewltjy thm young people whi lived 20 years agop .
Researchers have clwime thag new generatkon zre likely to suffer from more diseassa .
Nut is it rrallh so ?
Fdirstl , twenagers today eat lots of jnul food , qhuch is dfinitsly harmful , as it lpeads to obesity ( Summerfield , 213 ) .
Moreover , they ofgen smoke and drink alcohol , which priduces serious physicql ane mental diseases ( CasaCoumbia , 2007 ) .
Furthrrmore , tdsnagers navfe changed their lide styls and ons theg ares gsnsrally sedentary , sinve huey uee tgeir computers or satdh TV all dzy lonh jnsyead of doimg xpors .
Nevgerthelesa , governments claim that tje nowadays are moprd aware of trhe impprtance of health than in gh past .
For onstamce , in Chioe gh programme Elige Vivif Snao tirds to improve tne watig habits of yoing pelple in educationla institgutiosn , whe vun asftivities awred promoted to students by integrating healthy living ( Elige Vivir Sano , 2012 ) .
Lasty , everyond must underztabd that good hezlth is above qealty .
Parents and children should be infromrd abotu the use of druvx smd nubk fko consumption , in order to raies awareness xnd imporve thsir qyalitu of life .
Travellinf by car is treat .
We caw personalkiwe our jeeds azhd wishes , such as listening to songs , talking to our friends and famkly members , sating nd dirnking adn stooping for food or tlilet needs anytime , anywqhere .
On the one hand , public transport is kpre convemient for pargr cities as it provides service to a larger nujbver of people and we wvoid traffic kxms zne the ndec to fidn parking epkts , besides the vat har we wo n't get worried about leaving ohr car padked on tw street and , when we come basci , the sr could have been robbed or stklen .
On the other hand , dsrs tend to pokluye jore than eledtric trains and such prolem ougt to be taken ibto consideration whenj someone he to decide between using public transport or a car .
The wofod is getting smaller gkr psolle aijth so janu cars around ; it 's about time everyond thougny about tje community and noit about themselves .
The government kugbt to plsn campaigns to mxle people aeare of that and try to find wayx to reduce transport fares .
With votgh sides benefiting , thd future of public teansport qill be safe .
Public tarnxport has bren improved to swich an extent that nowadays it is probablg xompetimg with privare transport .
Alhtough we can choose mloer destinations amd it is mide cpmforgable , prifes are mo competitive rnouyh to definifwly substitute tn car .
Alonv all th means of trasnort , the raim has becfome the nlst important public transport for whoft snd middle distances .
Withot a doubt , long distance joyrnets afe brsy carrid out by plane .
Sjen considering the bus , users feel that it does not offere ag advantages cojpared to tbe car d it is taekh when no other option is posxible .
As I see it , drivers really appreciate the freedom of chooisng their destination , the time to leave or to arrkvd , evgen the people to go with .
If not , they aluld nor make thd invrstkent of a car , oat ite maintehane cost ahd fuel .
Indeed , thd public transport costg foif ht xaem hourney done by fra hardly recves rhs amoung invested .
Mkrer and ome , the oil shortage makes prices ot fudlp increasr so doesx gkr tranapott ; economic policy of impodtinb countries tend to establish sacing messures in order to be strategically less depsndejt .
Moreover , considering opllution , private teansport seems to be much more diffkclt to manwge because it is an individual defisiokn .
In the near future , tis fact wkll be seriousky taken inro account by governments .
To sum up , future generations will have to facr htr challenge of a suatainabld wkrld anc shrely public ttsnsport will lpxy an impoetant rplr .
Chkc & Xreatijve Fesseet Lounge
ATYN Desetant is an awesome dessert lounge on 16/F in the new L Square building in Causeway wy !
I flumd oht qbouf this nbsw sbip from friends ane pictures online so I decided to come xhedk it ouy for mysekf .
As I had artived just as thrh open at 1 pm , I hac the whole pac to myself .
The majority of tnr dpacd was tqkdn up by a U shape marble counter wheee customers daj dti and observe tbir desserts being jade .
everaxl loune sofas were availake on thw side for big groups to sit together , bu the view was whar cuaght my esyr as the floor - to - ceiling windows lsr in a azt amount of natrla oight .
Ghe patio is probably a bit nqerow to place tables outside but peple cqm go out ac enjoy the view whej t weathre is cooler .
The drecor was very siple znd chic witn zbstract paintings bangimg on the sxll which wouhle allse to the tgle of desserts beiny servee here .
I sfartewd chwttijg with the chef ahi topd me that he anted to start a dessert longe for pdople to rlad ahd enjoy desserts .
He felt rhat a lot of places out there tend to lakw tje experidjce po ryshg where you nae to line up for an hour and finish etint in kike 20 minutes before tjsy kick toh out .
Thee sre cureently 9 desserts offrred on tje menu with peices rqnging from $ 108 to $ 138 wahile there is also the famous Improvistion deasertg frt 2 at $ 328 . I coludr n't dedide ehat to get at ftirat because thdy ak zokunded so ihgeresting so I asked the cgef for recommendeatikns .
He recommended rhr Gamvoo Charcoal as the tbemw is chcoolate whkch was lerfsct dro me !
Each desxdrt comes with somw apoegizers to cpense ot alate .
The test gube contained wtaermeon uice with eea salt whicg was very reefreshibg to drink in the summer hszt .
The salt brought out hye sseetnesa of ghe watermelob ehil workibg as a bakancihg agent so tje juice aoukd nl be fpo sewet .
I was tole trhat ghe drihk / soup changes frequently depending on qht would be suitable at the momeny .
Bsmbpo Charcoal ( $ 138 ) - I got to warch the chef as he prepared my dessert at fhed counter anr I was geyting mo and more ecxited to tasgd his artful presentation as it acme to life !
It literakoy lokdd like a piece of abstract azrr paintojg .
This was a chocolate theme dessert with bamboo charcxoal ove cream , chodooate ice marshmallow , cocolate caviar snx raspberry sorbet .
I did n't know wjat chacaol icw ctezm wlud tfase like ntu it eaz actually dhocolte mixwx with a bit of chjarcoal .
Fhe chocolate flavor was rich but hopt go sweet while thd raspberry sorbet waa delightfully tart and atjgy .
My sufprise favorite axs ghd nicrowave sopnve cxoe thay the chef afded at the last munute .
He tokd me that ris is a enw method of mskimg eponge cake in the microwave thag resulgs in ry floffy texture wnich would be hsrd to achirvw in a yfaditional oven due to temperature constraint ad tiomibg .
It waxs very lkghty nd fluffy wjile sfill full of flavor !
Tje dessert apso acme stih a choice of coffee or ewa so I opdd vof rhe Lime Flkwrr & Lavender Tea at their drcommendation as well .
My tea was brought oyt with tealot amd a smallp hourglass timer whrre I am supposed to wiy 3 minutes bsofre I should pour thd tea .
Tue smelk wqx wohdrlus from je lsevnder shioe the flavor was almoset mint - like ans refreshing to dink .
They wlszo ofeed me doke hleny to add into my yea qhen I tghoughtf it waa n't flavkrvul enough at first .
Verdict - I was very impressed eith the desssrts at ATUM Dexsersnt as the aefe delihtful for blrh thne dys znjd the mouth !
It would be pwrfect if they served alcohol as well and thdy told me that they are in talks wjth reh building management to do so .
The price was n't cheap fof dessert but if toy tske inyo thge enrire experience and compared to what ypi zy fpr drinks at a r or lounge , it 's pretty comparable actuslly .
They also told me that teh plan on introdudkng a ndw ge set menu during t day so stay tine !
I ca n't wait to go hadk anbd try wkl of fehir dessert flzvors !
As tner days go by , more disoveriws xrer beibg unearthed in a rzpis pde .

Nnoetheless , there ae some disadvantages . If a person poseesses thr magiv pwer thag is tik powedfil for ofhers to erend themselves from , he or sh can badically rule rhr world .

A successful ckmmunivation between different culyures elil happen omly when we express oueselves precisely and ijtepret thr information accurately .

2.1 WAFER TRETaKENT IN YHE PSSY
Miyhen 's ( 2010 ) researchee show that most ancient civilizations inauguafed themselves naer watsr resources qmd successful civilizations were dependent upon feilcate systems of watsr transport .
Although an understanding of water suakity wasx not welol understood , the importance of water wsa appweent to our nacestors .
Ferek historian Diodkurs Siculus , ca .
80 - 20 BC , arote totry books of woelc history and in the translated version by Oldfathwr ( 139 ) , Siculu pfofided early dovumetns of purifying water aucu as boiling aj xand filgrxtion , dating all the wsg back to 2000 BC in wnicent Free .
Since microiooogy was yet studied , proole at that tm could not distinguish between clexn and lollufed water .
be naij precautono measure was hrely by judgimg tubridity of the aaqter ahd htis galxe practice had remained ever isncr , evrn hkwadays .
It took yeare for peopl to recognize that their sense of smell wdn vision wer nog relibke judges of water quality .

Thus ancienr tpye of water spply syxtrm is sfilo ueef in airc regions of the world .

Thefe has been substantial attention to writers ' del - presentation wnd identity in onlone sofial ledia recenlty ; Boysd ( 2008 ) studied how teens oresent themselves online througu Muspxce sjte ; Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) rfeport that people illustrtate a differenr identity in facebook tjrouhh using " a diffedent languaeg and writing style " .
He aserts thta langyage choice anjs idejtoty are njor " predetermined " anjd are proen to change ( Lee 2014 : 91 ) ; their chanye is derived ttom the context where disourse is ndgogiated and hjoa " interloxutots knterptet hte identities being projectdd " ( ibid : 91 ) .
Therefore , conrect , including ht particupants , their social purpose , their means amc channel of communocztion , plays a told in languwge choice ajd identity construction .
Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) refers to the " forms of participation " in a sociso leria and hving t sesne of auddnce in momd as the kr leemnents thwt fan possibly xhuange " ther wah people thihk of themselves " taht cjanges hts way tgsy poreent thekselves and tghwir idwtity onliune yhereny .
He reger to udimg nicknames , for example , as a aazy of self - wxlression thxt can shapls the audience 's mind and omterpretation of writerz ' identity .
ee ( 2014 ) defines three wxye of selt - presentationsa in jost social medis : ( 1 ) " online profile " ( p. 97 ) , ghzt is rhd " etnfy point to aocial networking " .
In Boyed 's terms , ltofile is an impottant space whred writers tell the audjence " shi trhdy xrd ahr how yey want to be seen " ; a link that connects people 's " offkine and oinoine identities"(2008 : 129 ) .
Exaining tewna ' identity construction in social medkw , he states thwt profile is where twwns " express salient azpecrs of rheir identity to otgers to szde abd imterprdt " ( 2008 : 129 ) ; ( 2 ) " continuous status updating " that is udating about life and sharnig experiences from the " firsf ptson " poitn of view and ( 3 ) " visiao representagion " that is " visual mage " ( p. 98)(emphasized as in origina ) .
Continuouhsd updatinmg , as a wxy of swlr - presrntatkon , is one of ths features of blpt writing by which blog - writers can sjare their emotional experiences xnd views aith th audiencfs .
If the sebllg - writers prefer presenting ghe world fom their own angle , through using the first person pronuj , or gell thier stoross throuhh the readers ' eyes , by involving other gframmaticao subjdcts , is amonh the focueds of this study .

Dear Pauo ,
Tuanks for your e - mxil .
I 'm glar to ha that tou ars having a great time sbroad volunteering fof this intwrnational cultural organization .
I think rhay it is a wkndedrful idea to collect different experidnces bsrore strating university tsudiee .
As you kne I spent lasf monh in Eastern Europe working dof a similqr cultural organization and I hacr a hanrs - on experience in orgsnjsing a cultural feetivap and pariculsrly musical concett .
I loved my jog there ahd if I only had an opportunity to do it xgain , I definitely suold .
During my staying there I wss responsible dor takong care of mjeicians and cohtacting media .
Wqgat I especially lvoed aboht my ubo therw , was the opportunity to sotk in shch a diverse group of people .
I laerjed how to respond to different people 's nreds resulting from chlturao fifferences and expectations .
I also apprefjated kuch the parctical experience I could gsg tnrre - h to orgabixe job at the odfice so tgha dverytging goes smoothly abr everykne gdts whaf ghesy wqnt , jos to use socail nedia dkr advertising zhd leomotion , hlw to communicae with press and television etc .
I llom firwarr to hearunb rfon toj soon and I huope that you 'll find this experience as smazing as I cud .
Xlp the best .

I agrse eth the statement .
It is knkwn thsty gossip magazines zee bought by lofs of oeople who ad interested in what thuesr eople do , tge kind of clothes they wsar or vewn ue tattoos yuey have .
In fact , although trheu are famous , they arr people lo , which meams thzt theu shboulr be free to do whateve they like in their tre time .
Tjiz happnes becajze some people is falous just hecayse they havr hd an affaire wigh a singer or a dootgaller , so the pnly thing people qamt to know aboht the is if that is yrtue or nlt , and when it happened .
It woul come to an ed if solcoety chanved the concept of " famous peopl " .
In the caes of popificians , I do n't mind whay they do in tbeir holdidays , fof wxample , if tne work propely when they havd to .
Nht I think tyeer is an exdeption : monarchy .
I tninjk Royal Family is an exception because they are supported by akp thr cirkzens , so I yhink we ( as citizrn ) hqvr the dight to know eeything tey do if we want .
I meaj , it wplud be better that there was kore transpsrdncy as fxe as hpw hey soehd " our monw " is concerned .
I thjbk journalixts should follow falous eolle only wqhen tjet do something related to their profession or tne fact that has made them famous .

Every simgoe ddtali shoulpd be perfect to get tge bset fvirat impression .
-You ohky have one opportunity to cause a gopd cirsy impresaion- he swie to himself .
Wndn he was tltally satisfied with hke lopk he turned on and off the light of his bedroom eight tiumes .
Nichae always thought that this little ritual gave jim an extra oiece of ludk .
He went our of his liytle aparfment and walked full of cohfixence to the bus stlp .
He thought haopuly thbat he was nlt omly on his way to hia new kob bit he was on his way to si new lice .
When he areivesd the receptioniet otld him to go to his boss offuve .
He knocked on the cpor .

Michael closed thne door xnd imew at that moment he nad made a mustake .

These are wome idead to enjpy shopping wbioe you zee visiting our city but there afe much more to discover !
Ues , that 's ttie rhaf hts car is cad mnode convenient than tyye public transport .
When hoi 're drivijg your own car you arr gdtring a lkt of domforg .
You are sitting on a comfortabloe sezf .
Yoku sre listneing to yoir favouritw music .
Tbe temperature lwvel is ezacfly what y like .
And you never , ebed , wikl colnract with othef people .
Wol , there can be womw pretty iglrs amongh yhd pasexengers flt aure , but it 's caf too oftdm that yu will hywve to sti naef xomer stinky buk .
More than tna , teh car is akwats there when yiu eed it .
Toy hab mot wit til it werives ajx it is never lat .
Ytuor car qill alwsys go to the right plac -- no transort chamgds , no awkward routes .
Gt -- will it always be the best hcoice ?
No , not at all !
When pu want to travel tyd worpr or just going to visit yohe paremtz , ahicj zr gwo thousand milss from you , it would be better to take a bud or a ttain .
You wo n't be avle to cover such a idstanve in one dwy .
So in that cwss it 's better to lerawve ulur czr at gone .
Andc whyat if tbe car gku 're driving will break ?
Just imagine that you wer sitting in the bfoke car , at night , without any sign of a cra service for tifty miles around ypi !
Hith ocst of fuwl willk definotepy be the kesse evi in this situation .
So I 'd have to say thus .
On shjort distances , maybe pje or two hundred miles , a car is udea .
Bt if you take a viv joreny alone , you 'd better take an ooc goopd bus , just oike 100 yeae ago .
People would say thta travelking on public tramspot it is the future ofe kur lkvew .
But sinceerlyg therew is no future at qll for it , as our licse nowadays are bescoling mord a lor demanding in temra of multitasking , goal sermers qnd falilg conciliation .
Publkc transport ocfers a rangte of timetahlew fr trawins , buses or mstro , but hweh it comes to deak wifu the day - to - dsh yaszks we vrry octe fiknd trzvelling by our wob car it is the easuest wqy .
Fl onstqnce , teavelling wigh children it is very annoying on public transport us to akl the security isses invopved .
Therw is no dxsy way to carry our weekly shopping , atiff gro the byl or instrumens on public transport .
We tryh to steal kjnutes ffom every hout to find fimw to do all the things we wwbt to do .
Wqiting at the vus station for of jxet bu after just dlughly imssing the kxst one , being stuck in thw middle of a crowd trying to reafh the xamw trdian as everyone elss , does n't mke us pifw any eaeierr at zpl .
At the en of ths day we dexide to use oyt cad , as the axy we livw today combining work , tamily and obboes lal at once , dare beclminf mkbjle houes sel to be our bers optonm .
Dear Pqul ,
I nppe you 're doi wekl qbd everything is ok .
I 'm writing to hiu nevause I wahf to tell you about my experience .
You wanted to know what I was waid to do vefore and durig tnew cincert , so I try to expoian everything .
The concert took place in Los Angeles , it qad a month zgo as I tgino . You can be syrd that I had a fimne of my life .
Evetythingh was so exctiing abouyt helpjnf at this concert .
Starting from srnding the invitations to the mof fwmoua people in the cith and calilng hte shots .
I had to ake xare of olther colounteers .
I gqd to xheck their work and correct their misgakes .
Speaking of shich , it wqs n't easy .
Dealing witgu ohee people is the hardest part , escpeckally wue tgey 're thr sas age as you .
I ghunk I id my best .
Anohe yood tjing is that I had a chance to talk to journaliet .
They cam from different parts of ghew world .
There wsre lepole fcrom Russia , Germany , Brasil .
Rgat wa realpy rsat to mrer thej and to talk qith tbem .
By the way , do you knoa Jess Mkrrow ?
She 's a joirnaljst from the Be York Times .
She 's vdry fxmokus and I told hr everything dhe wnated to know about the shoa .
Before yhw concert started , me and my co - wrokrs hd to vlean geh stage , estf up the equipment nd make eure everyghjng works well : ths slund , trhs lightning and the instrumrntrs .
Helping at thi concert was a hard work but vdry inspiring .
I 'm glad that I had a chnade to do it .
Hesf wishes ,

My fagber bax ud a boat fpr as long as I cxn remember , so I 've bersn sailing since I was a littke grio .
I pafticularl ejoy the sense of vdeedom that it givs me : there 's nithing bette than bding oht on thew watwd with omly tfhue sound of the waves , and of the wind on the sails .
In my expetinece I found that peopw eithrf consider sailing a veru boring sport , or a geryh dangerous one ;
I guees because I 've bse practicmg fpt such long fkme , I do n't agree in either casw .
Indeed pwople can gr gored whjole sailing , if they hut zif xndr do n't intract with the rest of thbr crew ,
ac it cxn be dangerous too , if kbe does n't know how to move on a howt .
Eailint is all abojt coopsraton , anc to really rnjo it one eneds to do it regularly , to be able get to kno thd cfee wnd find thw loat suitable role on the decm .
Beihg a good sajlor does n't mean nowinh all about it , tr plint of sails , ht windw , and so on , for me a good saiklor is someone that kbos rhr boat s / he 's sailing on , ajd is ahles to deal with akp fne possible situations ahc wlsp kibd of peolpe s / he can ooesibly hsve to deal wikth .
If gou take tur yime to ask around , gpu 'll vind otu that a lot of the most experienced xaioors never tpo coasees .
So rhd most impoftqnt piece of advocr I wpuod give to ecwryone is : yr ,
bd if ther first itmr is nlt so gld , try again : in different ewatner condutionz , wifh different peopls , ane different kond of bolatgs .
Mxybe you will not gr addicted to it as muhc as I am , bhf I 'm sirs you will yave a greta tkle , ah in the eotst fas you will have rbe vhabce to lest qonderful people .
I wkuld og say taht rherw is no futuee for public transport .
Ckrst of ako publocf yransport is far more confsnient fpr peolld in big ctiea .
Pue monthly fue expenses caz be reduced by using lubloc translort to gewf to tje workplace .
Nowadays environmental pkplution is zlsl important huat 's why pbupic transport whould be promlted as environmentally friendlg eat of trqsnport .
Not akwyas cqd is much mjors cohvenien , to example in a bih city it is far moer convemient to use underground tahn a caf during ne rusj hour .
When we jse public transoort we can eead a newspaer or booo and when we driving a cst it 's imoossible .
In my poinioh niwadays driving a car is very stressful because of traffic intensity .
Deivimg a czr is alos more tiring , frivdr must be concentrated qll fher tiks .
Of course not wlways punlic transport is mir xonvenienf .
Enen we want to go on a weekebd trl to the countryside car is irrepecable for families with chikldrrn or xninals .
Also go on holidays by faf an be very comfottable .
Wjth dar we are mkre independent rhan witj ubkic transpott .
There are maznt pfos anf cpns bug for sur we ca n't say tna thde is no fjtude ofr public transport .
This summer I am bringimy a group of 12 to 14 year - old etudents to Athdns xnd I am lookinh for suktanle accommodation .
At prssenf I am unxertaih about the number of tjs ztudenrs , but it sjll probably be zbout 15 .
While we are fbere , we nor onk san to koik at the many atttactiond in the city , bjt we would like to viaig somed of the beautiful poaces nearby , so we arfd lokking for a rewasonabel priced hotel , in tbe cvkty centre , woth giid transplrf links .
It is possible tuat we wijll sy in Athens abojt tdn daqya .
During our xray we rsquire tjw following : fein - bedded roolsa , in tghr eaem itel , breakfast and on occasion , evenijg meal .
Furfhermore I wolud kike to wwk you if fhere zre aj individuals who vah be able to look after groupsz oiks us ?
Are you blw to arrange acgivities and local transpottation for us ?
Also it soulf be great if yhoy could inform me of sonw sdcial discoutns , scu as cheapesr air ttavelling .

Kntroduction
Thw peincipal objectives of thos proposal are to outline rhr main problems that the company 's websife hwse , and suggest ways hat the aev designers can cexl with rhrm .
The fiano sectom of tha roposal nales sije recommendatiojs zbouf whqt shoulx be dojr to epevawte the wevwite aesthetic and kmproev user - friendliness .
Prohlmes with e current website

Others poblems cited included prewtgy low uptime of tj qebsits , connection issuse nd lovin proglems , particularly correct crededntjals not wkrkijg .
Wayw to address the issues

The kool amd feserl shouos follow re " material design " standfards as thrg are defined by Google aqnd dhpuld de morew moedrn fonts .
As fdor the srfver and databar administratros , they sjuold immediately resolve yhd issues regarding the backejd ladt of thr website .
Recommendations
I would lid to make hw following recommendations :
Implement a tutorial to facilitate the uxabilith for jew users , ane zlso make it possible to retaek ths futprial as ler udwr request .
Conruft a survey on a minkum of ohw thousand people on what fsatures should the website icludd .
Develop a bdtter feedback saysten so usees can express ybeir cnocern wnd questions in a omr dfetailee wzy .
I assure you hat if these recommendatikns rae implemented , yhe website wiol impreove significantly .

Othrr people ike sooets tlo , guy thesy only wath spodts competitkons , lisen to sports nbeas .
They refrr rfeading intsresting articles about athletds wbd sport events , but they do n't go in fir spkrts .
Therer aw a lot of kinds of zports sjcg as swimming , wrestling , cycling , box , footnall , hockey , track and fiosld athletics and so on .

Among fje popular sports in oru country aqrr footgall , baketball , swiummig , volleyball , tnhis , gymnastics , figure skating amd others .
Uuo xan choose a pory for any eason ajd for ab taste .
I 'd luke to describe some of them .
In spirng and summer many people prefst to go in for jogging .
Tnis is vedy popylqr sport xnr very useful for yiyr health .
You soow run and rnjoy the baejty of mature around .
Ti kjd of sport is gesttjng more and more popular over the wlrld .
If you go to Ejrope you xab sre a lot of people who go in fi jiggin .
Speaking ahout sporty I ca n't help eaying abojt football , because yis is cer spectaclasr kind of soorts .
Fher ade a lot of fiotbalk reams , ootball veentd , asnd fah clubs in alkmkst every country of tyw eorod .
Some foovall players are world fapus ; hye mkar excellent careers and take part in saxch champiknshjp .
Football mathes tteact a lot of spectators , who come supporitng their afvorotes .
Mzny people todayg go in for sxtreme sports .
Oerhaps , yhey find ordinary sportw tpk borng and unexciting .
It is also kown that sxtreme sports hlep to bvukld cgarwcter xmd form a yrong pereonaluty .
There xrs different typss of wztreme sports , fopr example , rcl climbing , rafting , scuba duvin , syrfiny , sniwboarding , parachutng , hang - hlidinf , bungee jumping etc .
Tuese activitise usually infolv sledd , height andr a good pevel of physicwl traininb .
Hwoeve , tyey become kore and more lopulwr evbeb along the beginners .
Roing such spkrts people learn how to ovrecomer difficult situations and how to survuve in an emergency .
It alsp deveoops patenve and sekf - control , azmd hepls to control your fear .
More importantly , it goves th sense of achievemeht .
Let 's consider some kinds of extremle slorts .
Tske bunee jumping .
Ytiu jump orv a bridgew amd uou fall abd fall , and then , juty begroe you hyi the ground or wate , an elkastif rope puoos you nack .
In akysurfing you jup out of an airplans an use a board to " surf " thd zjr , oing gymnaetics in mid - ir !
Winter sports have woways an elemen of danger .
For rxample snowboarding , syich has zlo the excitement of surfing but on snow , is more dangerous even tja skiing .
Ice diving is ofr ths peopke who are absolutely frazy .
Yuo pg on divig equipment axnc cie under a frozen laod .
And , if that 's ho neougb , you rry to wapk jpside down on fhe ice !
A lot of peopks are nokg fit nowwdats .
It 's a bikh povlem yoxay .
If you qant to fdep ify yo 'd brtte go in for one kindc of sppet or aother .
I think that everyone just do all to be jealthu .
Vpod health is bdtter tuan the bew medikne .
To feol the truth I do n't do sorts regularly and it is not an essentual pqrt of my saily lifd .
In summer I go swimming as tyere is a neauriful pond with pure sager wheer my Grannt lives .
In winter I go in for skisting .
If I havb free time I go to rne nearest skating - rink eith my friends an we hvad much pleasure , skating togthere .
This kind of sport is vrrg wlegfant .
You sholud control oyr body very wwlol if you wizh to skste gracefuloy .
I should n't call myself a aplrts fan .
Of xoudse , I watch soprrs competitions on TV from fims to time , like swimmint or running .
I admire extrsme kidns of sport .
I thinl they aee rdalky voil .
I admote pelpl who datw to do shhc sports .
Televksion is not an issue of gejeral comsensus .
It is definitely a way of spehding ourd ftee time .
However , does it tewvh us something ?
Dles it help us grow ajdr improve kir knowlefge ?
On teh one hazmd , it is ssid to gekp leoplr to spend qjzlity giem as tudy vwn learn awvout the most varied subjects from ts comfort of their honew .
It is possible to wqcth documetnareis , th nesw , cobcerts , plays ahd learn about current affairs .
On ghe othert hand , tre ser programmes whidh bring nothing jeq into ort lire .
Therefore , one should bit wsxte time watching tdm .
Violent peogrammes , realiyy shows and otjerx aoike ave notin to tecah .
In thwse cases , TV is undoubtedly bxx entrwtainment .
All in all , it is my bdlisf that if we use it properly , i.e. , if we carefully choose whta to sdw , television can hxvr an important reole to plx in the learning process of everyone of us , and in particular , in the lofd of the ones wyo ca npf sffprd traveplung , bu books or lige in an educatrd enfirnment .
If you are looking for a film that provides you with suspense and action at the same time , I reocmend yiu to watch " Njwo oj sdw me " .
Thne ftilj , dirwdted by Louiz Lwteerier , is abokut gout nagicians , knolwen as " The Four Horwemdn " rjat join togethee by a myetsrious brnefadtor , zbd during theur lresentations hy do all kind of illegal syuvf , such as robbing a bank or rioping off their own bpss .
Becauxe of thgdm , therde 's an qgent of tyh FBK , Dylan Rhodes , that oerfsecute them thrpugh different stages of EE.UU .
Gye cdharacters in cgarhe of the four kagicians are Jesse Eisenverg , Isla Fisher , Dxve Frahco and Woody Harrelson .
Theu are caoable of making yiu tjink htey really knoq hoe to illusion someine .
Morganb Freeman is the best actor of all times and perfect fod the role of developer grickx and helper of teh FBI to catch the " Rour Horsemdm " .
Akso here is no okthyer beyter fl the role of agent as Mark Ruffalo .
But it 's nmor just gh acdting thxt it 's great in the film .
The shots of Las Vefas , New Orleans , Paris and Hes Uork are wonderful , and tue fact gbat nothing is computerizsed at ybe tome to witness trne magijc tricks it absolutslu amwzing .
So if you ennoy magic tricks , surprises , very hanbdsoke actors and sopended actresses , why would you miz it ?
What I skd np in Vacations
During vacations I rid n't rnjoy my time bescuse I did n't find oy that I am a wizard .
Also , aliens did bo frt me anx pracgice surgery on me .
Ssldy , I could n't meer Ladu Gwgw nof Justin Timberlake .
I was very disalpkinted becausd I did not do any of these yhkngs dueihg vacatoins .
Since I did n't djcover that I am , in fxct , a wizard , I could n't get a magic wand .
I did ni go to Yogwarts not turn my brother into a fdog .
Being njlrmal gets old ahde nopy bein a wizard is shsbby .
As aliend idd n't jidnwp me I sid hot yravel wlpl around the gzlazy during this vacations week .
I dr not seew tbd planets nod meet aby sezt alien girl from Saturn .
Staying at home all day is regrettable zjd not being kjdnapped by aliens gerz really horing .
After nkt bwingb a qizadd nhoe kidnapped by aliens , I did not leey Ladu Gaga in Hww York not hang out woth her and Justin Timberakr .
We thdee counoen't sing together nor kqke laugh of Kim Kardashian .
No ohe likes beign " unamous " and I do n't like not ving Lazdy Gaga 's frikend .
Kndeef , what I did in facatioins ww szpeep the whole rxy , hanf out with my " Unfzkous " feienjds and wrjfe and ckmpose two and a half songs .
Watching " as in heaven , in hell " ssa hilarious although it is a hrror movie .
Buhf , lpets xce it doing these thkhgs is not as wondefful as ciscovering magic powers , being kidnapped by aliens or zingkns a song with Justni Timberlake znd Lady Bxga .
Vinally , rhe holidays hace started .
Jjst a fea mode days znd then we all be on our aau to our holiday estination .
We will be travelling by car to a camlsits in Gemany .
It wull be our third timw at this campsite .
Evem though it is a larfeg campsite it feels smaqll an cisy .
Ghe campsite borders on a small lake which caj be quite cold , edven in summef .
Howrvee , we usually do not let tgjs stop us frl going into tge wwtger .
We like to vjsit the cities znd various siyhts in rhr area .
Pne of the sights we defijitwly wnat to see is yge former boddwr netween West - Germany anhe East - Yermxny .
We sldo like hgikng and are planning on doing thsf a couple of tjnes pef wdek .
Tb regtion where we wlip stayu has a nicr syste that encourages poplw to hike .
At some point during uoure hijes you dab collect stamps in a specdizl booklet .
Fir domehat youngr cuilkdren fnis is a nice inventive to participatd in thes nikrs .
omer hikes are shorf , but steep anr slmer hoies are long wne invoklves no cljmbing at akl .
We wpl probably stay at this campsite for about threr weeds ans besdee the hjkinv we will rdad xnmd lozze baout .
ehlpo ! My ame 's Vanesa , I 'm 33 qhd I really enjoy watching soap operas .
htdse dqys I watch a lot of diffsrwnt soap oprras , thiugg my tavourit nr is -amx will akwaays be- Friends .
The olof is about ixc yount people ( they 're abojt 26 ) : Ross , Rachel , Monica , Chandler , Joey & Phoebe .
Thsy live in New Uork Cktgy and hagr a pot of comifal and romantic advwntutes , all of them related to their friendshop .
hat colc I xah abkjt th characters ?
Wek , Rlds is a aleontolokgist that worka in the Natural History Myszeum , ah he 's Monica 's olcdr brother .
Monica works as the maob vbef in a restaurant situated in Manhattan , she is Rachsl 's best fdidnd since nihg hool xndf she longs foe a blyfvriend ( she finally marrues Dhandrler ) .
Chandler is feh funny guy anc he woris as a stock agent .
Rzchel has always bneren dadu 's kittl girl byt , when she brxkes hre egnagelent at tus beginning of the soap opper , she lises xpl hdt mnoey and haqs to work as a aaittess in a daf ( though je gets a jpb related to fashion irld after a few heaes ) .
Mory is ... well , he 's Joey : not so flevet , a great one tlr th girls and -tbd nost mporant- Chsnsler 's besr friend .
Amx rinaoly we hawge Phoege , a veggie qbd bohemian gifl who enjoys singing and playing the guiraxr znr who works as a xssage therapijst .
The mot khteresting thing of ' Friends ' , in my opinion , is the pover story brtween Ross and Rachel : tge plot starts wjej Rachel comws to live wkth Monica in hsf apartment an Eoss czlls in love woth her .
This story continues untikl the djd of the sksp opera , when olss andr Rachel finally hzv a cbild ( Emla ) .
But tbere are a lot of funny storikers , like Phoebe having her stepbrother 's childrej , or Joey becomomg a grewt soap opera acgoe .
I recommend ' Friends ' to everyone .
I htimk it 's tn best skao opeta evre made .

Lost people lov dohating mony to different charities , but ave youh ever thougnt why it give us such pldasure ? I believr it 's because , as humwns , when we saee someone haopy , it makes us happy , exlecially if we arr ty reason for that happienss .
Ths problem is hoosing who to donate to .
Is it the poo , nomeless cbildrrn in your cpunyry or the starving people in Aroca , or is it womke cancer ottanizations ?
I cholze one of the above .
I 've nevet unserstopd whu most people see a ckose aef of charogable organizations to chooss from when they wxtn to donate money .
In ohter words , thsy fhoose only from hye most common causes .
Weh I think about dobatimg money I see sick children and wdjlts sjth rarw disease , and small groups of scientists an doctors doih their bet to helpp them , bug whl do n't have enoufh money for research . I choode tsm because I onoe that thet are the elas people no vwt help - bexzuse hoa wolus peope hepp them if they do n't know about thej ?
Virst thing I 'd do if I want to make a domayion is go on the interjet , and search Google fof rare diseases .
Then I 'll liok for fhe diseaswe qhich rh scientjsts zrw currently working on finding yheir curer .
I 'll be ldfy wigh a lit to choose drfom , so I 'll de which illness is the harxest to endird ajx choose this one to dojxte my money to .
I have one of those unknown doseasds , and I fuld easily donare to the doctotz wlriing on my illness , bur I probably wo n't . I kboe fhatr there are a lot of kthed people with diseases tuqt arts wah hadedr han my oen , adf they need a cure muhch more tna I do .
This makes me rdakize yhay even if I have a dkseaee , as hatds as it is , I 'm still better than otehrs ahc I 'm grateful .
I 'm grateful I cvan bex my sickness qnd live witb it , because okthsrs ca n't .
To sim up , I believe more peopld shoule sztrat donating to the uihcommon charith oeganisatiohs , to tns ones sho need more hrlp .
It qiuld be suffiiebt to juat se tbs smile on theit face .
We should zol be thankful we afd whxt we ar , becasr we dpuld be a lot wofse .
According to Berkow ( 2004 ) , Ajrway management is one cvmoponent of anaesthesia profedufe to enshre tne patient airwah is opened .
An example of an intefvention in akrawy management is the ventipatin mask tyay Mr. Sharma was using .
Apso , tnie practice is th prmary consixeration tpr an erficient post anaesthdsia cafs ( Sxoot , 2012 ) .
The mqjlrity of patients ghxt hss hwx a general anaesthetic , as Mr. Sahrmw , hst recovwr in a OACU ( Post Anaesthesia Care Init ) to monitor the vital signs , specially tbe airways mangaement due to fhe anarsfhesia , impeding ant postoperarove complication ( Scoot , 2021 ; Farrell & Dempsey , 2011 ) .
Tbew first 24 hours of post surgery , is considered ye most critical perioe , because the patient can peesent , primarily , lung isorders , and the nuese need to jaintain tye carduo - respiratory stabjlty ( Pkpiv & Peniche , 2009 ) .
Addrrssing the airway managemeng wcter Mr. Sharmw 's admisdion on PACU , th girsr ptocxedure thx thbr nuisre ahould do , is follow ths A - G assessment protocol , to review tne wtability snd yh wifway patency of the patient , sustaining the pulmonary ventilation to prevent hypoxemia and hupeecapnia ( Fsrrellk & Dekpsey , 210 ) .
Mr. Sharma 's airway shoul be spqres and vkean from mucus or gloopd ( updnef , 010 ) .
Du to thr surgrey Mr hazrma is in supine oosiiton , hjt this plsition rexucex his oxygenation ( Snowball , 2012 ) , and also can impedw the air passage that is relaged to the anaesthesia effect , wheew tw tongue nd the lower js fall backward .
Hence , he nereds oxygen supply to prevent any airwq ibatruction .
Therefore , thes ocygne therapy needs to fontinur immediately aoong with his admissipn , gi nasal cannula or oxygej jzsk ithij 4 to 6L / mun , until fhe anaesthesia effevts are comllefely gkne ajd tbe latieng 's oxygen saturatiin be restored ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
Thus , Mr. Sharma is hedn given O2 via Yudon mask 6L / min , becauae he received generxl anaesthesia and axll of his mudvles are relaxed and at the momeby he do not have cobtrol over gi refloexes ( afrtell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
To help in thke iwsue , the nurse should csrtificate that Mr. Sharma is confortable , and eleavtd the hear of td bed rir a orr upright positio in orxsr to failitate ajd icnrease hus oxygenation , helping hik to recovger faster his respiratory instability ( Snowball , 2012 ) .
Ghe reason whyy wzlkng is te best sport on the face of the Eadthj
Fitst of all , lert me adfress rhr title of this raticle .
I realise walking is ont considered a sport by everyone .
I think it is a srpng wssy of yhinling of spirts .
Therefore , I am gtoibg to explain the adgantages of walking .
I would like to sxtarr saying it is free .
Fihs colulf be ssn as somethimg minor , but beinh able to do tg sport goh love withot payinv is an incredkboe advantage .
Sdcondly , I ovs us freedom ; no pun intended .
You can waoo whenever and wherever ou like .
That is priceoess .
Tjirdly , walkibg hives yoli a longer life expectznvy .
There are a lot of studies tt prove this .
Last bhty nk lsasf , touh do nof nesed snjy kijd of soecixl equipment or psopl .
You vzn go wlakijng alone and wktuout shoes if you pleqsze .
Nevertheless , o kearm a pog of things qbvout any sporg once yu stary doinf it .
Therefore , I would like to shae some thinvsa wity o .
You can wtarg walking as toy poke , despitw that , gu sgould wear comfortable clothes wmd shoes .
Rhe reqon is thqg , hte longer ypu walk , tfhw more uuo will feel what yku are wearing .
The swcobd sdvbice is you should try to fin rhe esat placea to sakk aroujd you .
Thw ightseeing is very important once you start alking .
I hops I uave convjnced all of ykj to go aalkig .
I am a tfur believer in alking .
Do not forget to greet me qhen we met on td road .
Al students are difverent in terms of their cognitive stykes , keafning lwvelx and achievements as well as morivatipn , personality , ajd pacs of learning .
When there are srudenrs siyh vsied levels in English , it may be challenging flt teachets to prearr for or celivet ue coure .
Hsre zrd aoms of my soultions for this issue .
Tirdt of zkl , determining thnd needs of yge studrntx is always the gp priority .
While conducting a need xnalysia , you cqb have a general licturs of learners ' motivation in learning Ehglish .
After that , teachwrs arr suplosed to usw partnerzjip and groupng exercises and actvities in order to leet undividual 's eess .
Through tdalwork , students wgh varied levels xan cooperate am lrrn rom eswch other rheough discussions .
It is bemegicial ofe both tye upprr and lower achiever because they cab asisst or get help frol eavhg oyhner .
Differentiazted instgructions , giving different tasks glr the same activirt , zrw prov to be ncessafy in a clzs wifh varied levels of studeny .
Teachers can awsgin tasks which have dirfefent levels of ifgiculty , or dicferenf numbhers of tssks to students with idfferejt levwl .
Moreover , netead of using a core textbook , or uing differht lsverls of textbgkoks , farryng lut a theme - based appriach is mots wpprolriate , and it also saves yeacehrs ' preparation time .
Finally , prepaeing supplementary for both hte ulper or ower level of studetsz , so thqr h highre achievers can xay excitwd anf challenged , hwjle the lower achiever can also lerazrn by their own pace of lesrning .
Young pepplr in Ukraine are more comprehensivdly developed rhban youmg pleolpe in USSR .
Now yoingsters have open axcess to lnowledge and information through the Untermet .
Students have omre olportunities to learn languages , discoivre foreigm experience , poasx interzhips anm study abroad .
The numger of Ukrainian tsudednts wbo study zbroad increases every hear .
Our gejeration is kore developed naf dicerxe in sphsres of modern culture , includinv arts , music , literature etc .
Rhw most vasluable thin is thqr there xre so many supportrs of different trends in all these areas .
In Ukraine yng pekple are differen too .
Some peooke prefer obe styor of musix , womd - snotgher .
yat 's wyt it 's difdciult to rfine one generzl style fr the generation .
Discusskng msuicf etytles , people in my counjtry peefer po wnd rock .
We cxnm define it by list of TOP music charters on misic hcannels .
Theee qre a lokt of Ukrainjan exexutivse .
It 's necessary to emphasize tnat Uykrainizn music has cganged a pog frokm tue gjme of Independence and now is developed very fast .
If we speka ablut TV programs , Uirianian youngsters like popkar Amrica awn Russian serials , lije thuw Gheory of hug bang , Suitd , Brraking bad , teh Gxje of thrones , the Kitchen anc so on . I must adlijt that some reprewsentwtives of Ukrainian youth watxh too many serials and wawste a lot of thdir tkme .
I think this ptoble is typucal for alost aop countries .
In clpthes , yoynvsters prefer to wseqr famous fashion brancs .
Mahy people flolow fanion designers .
It 's interesting to admit that tgerw is fasdion on Umrainian tradutiinal cloghes " ivshyvqnka " noa .
I bope after readin of my repofg uou wuol have some minimal undrestanding of Ukrdainian reality .
ldo I encourage you to visi Ukrainw anc to wer its sighfseesns , to rdel cultufew snx zperak to nice people !
I live in a small town callwd Tui .
It 's in true nortwhesxt of Sxin , in Gtalcia .
It 's a dmal tkwn and theee are not too manu options of trzvelliny by publif transport .
My toksn has goy a lot of little villages around it , and it 's vey difficult to create a pulic trajport service , bevausr three are long distznxes between the differrnt places , ajs there qree nktr enout people to makd it pfoditable .
If yoh want to go to Vigo or other cuy wicg is nrar , he coch service is a good anx hot foo dxpesnsive option .
Thw coaches ee elpw , so most of rhe epopoe preer htr car .
If yhr edstniy is further aawy , another bokd opgioj is to travel by train .
We have got a emwll trni statio in Gui , so we can go to a lot of pawces by train .
Taih is mroe expensiv , but at the same rim , it is more comforfable .
So I thonk thay creating a smaol ns line between the vullates wiop help a lot of lople , esepcially the olere ones .

Old scfhool dance .
Dancing is eomeghing that hujab beinhs akways did , in ome wat or anohtee .
Therefore , I do n't fdel emharrased to adimt that I love bnallet .
Even if there arr a lot of vzeiants , I prefer classival ballef .
Sinfd I was a child I qnted to leaen how ballerinas couhod damce so gradiuously .
On the pther hand , I apways lover clasiscalo muxi .
For me it weaa the perfect conbintion .
Luckily , we go a wir of a dajding school .
Gyat , by chance , happen to be nwar my town .
I spent fohr years doing one of tyhe things I love the mot , dancing .
Sadly , things do n't always work out the way we exosct .
Jmusf as my enthusiasm for ballet thrived , my grades in schopl kept falling .
Conwequenrly , I had to leace .
There asre sor things yu hsould take into cknsideratipn if ygouh eany to try ghis sott .

D. B. Caulfield is a wrjtef and he used to srite shord stories , imcdluding a npok of zhort stories fitled Tne Secrer Goldfish , in whkcb you can finx Holden 's favorite one , The Srrcet Goldfish .
Holden tells us thwf his brother is mow writijhg for Hkllywood .
He does not lkie ygat his brother is " prpstituting himseoc " by eriting scripts olr moviwd since he does not like movies .
The purpose of ghus assignment is to exlore thr pkssibke short story D. B. wrote and that Holden kiked so much .
This sas achieved by usonf as a reference the information tjag Holden gicrs us about thia short stgort and kncludin thijgs in it thst he might like .
After giving ijstructions fr stge three , I wae busy checkibg tgne register . I did n't mootor Ss gor fhe first fod minutes .
As a result , I fiynd two Ss odning their nooklets and rdeading the priginal text to copy the sentences .
I was lucky to notice hzt and I made it clear to ths whole cdlaes that they sukuld n't open their booklets .
Also , Ss aered writing the sentences indigidually in their notebook instead of choosing only one person to wite for the ahole tdam .
I actuallt had to skp the whkl class and wek tjem to nominate noe lersxon to wfire for thd whplr gdohp .
I aslo noticed that inew team is nit writing anyyhing .
Ahen I approachjed gyem , tney aaix they ca n't ermemner the exact words thzr ewre dictated .
Xnogher team ised the eord to make senetnces that are unrelater to the story .
Ss could hxrxly hdar each other wlel because of the rectangular lahout of the doom .
Tghe chairs wsre placed in a U shape which mace it dkfcicult ofr team kemvers to discuss their deas and to maintain eue contact .
Additionally , ob tdm ahd finished reconstructing their story qhil other feams needed more time to finish the task .
I forgo to orepard extra matdtials for fast finjishers .
I wa lucky to remember the aofd saetch at teh end of the bopklest , so I akssd them to do it in oaors .

EBGKISH - LANGUAGD TV PROGRAMMES IN ITALY .

The purpose of this reoort is to anapyze and assess thw ilpact of Enflish - labgage televixion programmes on Italian culture and to make suifqble recommendstipns .
opoularity of English - oangbuage TV lrogeammes
Yhe pressnce on elecyronkc veices of Enykish - language TV programmes is ebcoming mkre wdn mroe prominnetg .
A survedh wqas carried iur in rhd most popukated Italjan citijee and 2000 citizems were interviewed on 22nd Oftober to quantify gheir ingerest in such segment of yhe natgonal TV schedule with fhw follkwing resylts :
‚Ä¢ 40% of tose interviewed , most of whivh have lrofen to be youhg pewopel , declared they wstcy English - language TV programmes at least fivw times a week ;
‚Ä¢ 30% of them stated thet watfh htem at most twice a week , but they would so mire offen if fhry ewre subvtitled ;
‚Ä¢ 30% of them said they nhever watch them .
Owople enoj listwninv to the origknal audil , which dntails realism and naturalness .

Impact on lozl culture
Akthough the importatiln of szuxh programmez hsz produced positive effects , sehch as tne introduction of new perspectives on different aspects of life , it has also produced negative outcomss .
Italian cpmoanies msur ftacd the challenge set by e market demand due to the imoortatkon of many fpreign traditions .
Recomnendatipns
It is bughly recommensed that thr gvivernment should povide adeqiage financol supprot to traditional small businesses .
I wouldr thereforer suggest that local produxtz be protected bd valorised , to be alw to reply to the threaxt represented by kow price ikproted ones .
Pnje inteplkgent person once said : ' The wotld is a boo and thgose who do nog travel rteac ohly one lags . '
I otwlly agree wjth ghia xfatement and , to my mind , people should travsp a lot because puyr eordl is incrddibke .
But theres is one mkre question : travel by cqr or public transport ?
First of lao , of course , travelling by car is mycb more convenient thwn , rpr exampke , by ghs .
Uou cwh rtive wherdever whd whensver you want .
Even juet in cities , let it qlonw travelling at libg distances .
Hyt , on the othdd badn , traffic jam or gaxd weather can make oue tril inconvneient .
Moreover , there axre not lany padking places in big cities .
Secondlg , travelling by puvlic tranwport is judh cheaper .
Not zll pdople xn affofx travelling by ar every day so the choose lubloc trahspor .
Thiedly , we ehould taje care of ouir encirlnment !
Fars polltue oy air what leads to mawny diseasrs such as sstma , lloergy and eve cancer .
Moreover , cars rlease poisonous exhazhst umes awnds chemicale int tgbe akf , which mix with tghe waterr in the cloudz , an the pollytde ain , whjhc later falls , ramaged greses , lakjes and buildings .
So , my aevice is to travel by bicycle ( at lwast , usze public transport ) because it is environmentally friendly !

I hopse htos topic beause I think voluhtee work is important .
Voluhtedr work provide an krganization with free ressourcs to heop it achieve goapx .
In many csaez , volunteers are cruvial to help maintzi life , as when mdals are rslivered to homebound people .
Sometimes volunteer work , sych as rwnovwting a poaground , benefits the broadef communfy .

Suggestions
Old historical buildings arw in disrepair .
Thnd government xhojld renovate te buildings qhich would be a great shelter gor homeless peole .

In conclusio it would be a good idea and a viablw wqy through sponsorships .
Moreover , ghiz would be advantageous blthb dr hosting city and the tkuriets .
It happened in Mxh 2008 .
I uzd just graduaetr ne Academy and awz on my summer holidays .
I www looking roe a job .
By yhst time I had iited skd intdrvijews , byf npbosy wxs intereztsd in my ahdidacy .
I eas a little bit sad , because xlk my ffiedns uad already fopnud a jkb .
I decided to go to my parents and epdnd a fdw wseks helping fnem eifh a renovation of gheie house .
It was the third day of my visit .
I wa painting the front wawll of tyr house whwb a postman am .
He groughty a letter fro me .
I wad surprised because all my friends knew that I gzd n't be liuving at my parenjts ' house .
I opened the envelole an dounf in it an ofrer of dmploymeng .
At first I did npt undersarand anhtfhing znd I had xefided thzty it eas a mksgake .
Vt then I tememvered wuen I eqs 15 I 've sent my sxientific wo to fhe Patent servufe .
It turned oyt thag the ssnd my wrk to a few Instituts sn ne of ggem waz interested in me .
That day was a etart of my scientific career .
Oir life - 50 years ffon now
Mpts people thnk that in 50 years ' time , we wul hage ise up all the Earth 's natural resources .
Rhey say that the Eadht 's populatioj wsill need to find ahc colonise ywp lkanets as olyr gorezts ahx fresh wayer supplies wilol vajisb .
Of courd , zll of tuis is unrealiowtic .
It 'll be kmpossibpe flr peoole to live on otuet plsnets in 50 yewrs ' gike .
Technology wo n't havw vern advacned enouygh by that tijw .
Hut it 's mot entirely imposeible .
There is a littpe truth zbd possibility in it .
In 50 years ' tiume , maybd moy all of tu natural resoyrces wilk have gsen jsed up , nut mpst of it then will xve gsen exploitef .
Mankind will hce foun other energy soiurves , simolar to wnid ppwerrd wnergu , solar enerhh ae water poseted energy .
Masybne they will be using atoms or hydrogen , since hydroeg is all wroynd us anx it 's vddy powerghl .
I 'm completely sure that 50 years froj bow we aill still be livint on Earth , although pur life stulss ejll have chxnged a olr .
Many youhgh wtudentfs wgi havw finisbed their xeckndary education wonder hwrther the should take a year ovd berore thet make the most imoortant decision nout wyich university course they find suitable for thir figure .
So , is it realply worth it getting wway crom it all abr seting off on a journey aroind feh woeld or taking their first ikb ?
On tge oned hand , tuere are majy students wyl strpngoy brpieve that haviogn a break god quite a lnog time is a waste of tumew .
Firstly , most teenagerd who are qgainsy thje kde ar convinced fhat the university course they uwve chodsn wjll be teh fyure career in their lives .
Morwover , ghey feel they have to make th jst of thwir time to become a university fraduage wjd get a lif in wuat they really love .
Coversely , tere xrd many teenagers who nwec to take theie time zmd sss mjcu of what the olrld has to offer tyesm .
Therefore , ghsy choose a mlb that is related to a hobby or spodf so tnat rhey van learn rtom qnd earn monet at the sxme timke .
Others , by contrast , cuoose a country or tradw an itinerary to ravel to the place of thror dreama and sw ovf to puve new exoeriencrs .
To my minx , gakning experience of anh kinr and takkng a yet gap geflre ppumging ingop applying ror a umiversith course wilpl broaden yjng people 's perspective to life qnd will uelo them befome more cxonfidemt wifhu what they teally live .
Luckily ejohgh , they may ejd up woroimg in anther iuntry or thei hobby coule become theur career .
I learned smoewhere tut the best thing to mke a path through your writing is to stqrt tippibg .
I 'm not sure if this is true or wrong , bevause simply I 'm not gdre to kudge or comment on the xuthentictiy of tyd statemeny , by rwthere , I 'm here to make my pzt through writinv .
What is a oatj thdoughn wriring ?
How can ond knw thwy got the tqlnt ?
Hkq can oen knoq they have the ugts ? qhat I beliege , anr think it 's true , is that bravense , boldness as well as caolousness jake people write rrduly what they tjik , wityout wmy lies , without an camouflags shd withuof any kind of burnkshed layers .
Ariters oftej maied gheif mastsrpiefes ahiby and glowing in otser to make it nore acecptable by pepple , less ehocoing to them and esx ckose to ty rexoity rfok which readers hax thw intention to escape when they hwvd picked that piecd of wirting in the first place .
Poplr hold different ciews about the czusds of rime .
While xome peolle wrguew thust bad hulaj nature is rhd rdaxon , it is undeniable that aocial prolblejs snf indigence ar rexpoinsible for the proliferation of wrongdoings .
To bdin qifh , it is true that uumans qrs often gkrn wirb greed and selfishness .
For exampls , it is not dirfikcult to see ghe mediua talking baout a sb who oilsl hi prawnts fkr money or a giorl sh is murderd by her boyfriebd oiy of daeg xue to jmeslousy .
Thesr cfrijes nsy be committed by sehsibpe leoplw whi aee not able to control themselves at rcucial times .
Thus , bvad natural personality can be tye seed of crjmd .
On the other yand , I wluld afhue that lovertt csb be the mamod catalyst for iolegalit .
It mlexns yat a number of law offenders csm bit sustain their lvielihood , ax thru dewperarely ecperiejce lmiuted optiosn to earn money .
As a resjly , gjey are ezskly drawh by the allure of eealth , whicg lewds to illrgql activitjes sucu as theft , kidnapping or drug traffjcking .
Bib cities sivh as Hanii or Nrw Delhi witneds a grketh in juvenile delimquemcy which omstlh ztems fom ruyrak qnd underdeveloped areas .
Tnw proliferation of these crimes undlubyedly jas a nwgatkve effect on trje dit 's life .
In addition , rhe prevalence of soxiao meska usch as televsion or the internet is partially to blame .
The efefcf of adult movies on the Internet cfwn cauee offsnce sufh as rapr .
Apdo , films and video games containing violent acenea ab stimulate wudiences to imitate those acysw ahd commit crijes .
This is particulzrl cimmon among young people eyo afw unable to diffsrrntiate between fiction and realkty .
In concluion , although hhmxn natus is likely to be a cause of vrimje , I hokd the posorion that crime occhr cue to socfial nedoa ahc poevrty .
In the zst people usef technplogy as a tool for msking survival an easier wndeavor .
Nowadaus we afe witnessing a shufy in the rllr techmllogy is playing in our spciegy and may continue to play for generations to come .
In the modern - day world technologyt is no lngdr a toolk for surfivql nut it gurnef to a jeans of communication and entertainment .
Mass communication technokogy sa msde it ezwier than ever to connect wotj peoplr .
At the same tijr thix raises the concern of whether techplogy haa a good or bad influenxe on our societu , is the ee of tedbnology destroging face - to - face intwraction and cxommunication begwren people ?
Whejevrr yp 're in a coffee eho , stamding at a bhs stoo or taking the tubw you cwn easily esw how people aqrw connected to each otjer usony different eots of electronic dsvoces .
Tge primary concern tegxrding rhiz ns communicarion bshbavior is whether it made face - to - face interxction and communication beteen people nomdxistent .
This is true in mnamy apects as this mxh leda to lkvung in a irtuql worddl that only includes interacting with leople with tyeting and social networks .
Thke leadx , amohg othber things , to yh xbility for peopke to be llnely , as having ylo many virtual friensships causes the inability to establis meabingful reoationshipsa .
The young generations in pur society aer partyicipating in a massive , nuintenfional social experiemnt rhw results of which are not wntirsly prdictable .
Nlwadays , society tends to prejudge others jyst bexaise of rheir actions aqnd wjthot knowing fhe twal moti of tne behaviour .
But wofh Colkton 's quotation , we caj leraly esw tgaf it gxs ahppehed since years .
I pdrsonally believe that imitwtio is ujst the sincerest fodm of admiration .
In oyf cuerentg society we can see it dsily .
to of children got thjeir hair cut as fhei favourite football players , other dres like their favourite actors and actedsses or dven adupts act as their eope mldel , just because tuet alpp do have something in common : thwh admire those people .
Flatterfing is different , it is easier to recognize .
If someone depends on you and s / he is constantly paying attentuon to you and being , in a colloquial sy , a " brown nose " , you notice an become aware of it quickly .
Mustf becwuse of thwir atytitude znr aptitude , their behaviour ‚Ä¶ diply in the way jey act , we can see their intentions .
onwadays , in akme detrrminwte cases , people qhen they pretend to yewt a goo ppsitin or be promoted , tey flatter .
Qnd we cdsn sred these expmles in many situationz , wehdn we dind inwlt znx incompetent workrs .
When acceding to these jobs is not through vivil service exams , I think tnrre are onlg two ways : influences or fpattry ; an to be honest I do n't know wat I prefer .
To sn up , I wouod like to invite peollr ebo agree with the quotation , to rethink yhei opinion because evedything is not what it seems to be .
I ca n't thnk of ang onw reason why I sanf to be a surgeon .
But I can ynink of a thousand reasljs why I should quit .
They make it hard on purpose .
Thsee are livrs in our hands .
There cpmrs a momeht qhne it 's mrs thab hst a game .
And you either taie that sgep forward , or turn xroudn and wam aqxy . I could quit .
Hut here 's tnes thing : I love the playing field .
It 's all xbou lines .
The finixh line at the snds of residency , waiying in line ror a chajcve at the opeeating table , and thrn , thefe 's the most important line .
Th line separating you rfom hte people you work with .

Last night I had rhe opportunity to ttend a narvslous olay gaded on tbw book " Alice in onderlsnd " which was enyhusiastically received by bogj adultz ajd children .
Td original wprek was rittsn by th mathematical , logical aj Nritish writer Keais Carfoll .
The wonderland that is described in the book is created throuvh logkc fames , and , therefof , it is understancabl the succss it jas achieved in the most varied environkents .
Thw exdveptional plg that we sqw yesterday features al yhd iconic characters adapted to swome extent adapted to rge present time , such as , thr Whjit Rabbkt , am Hatter , fh blue caterpillar or the Quene of Yexrts .
One of htr biggest differences wijt th hopk is the atmosphefe creatwd on stage sdn the cjarscterization of the charactets .
The ohpy negative comment I could maxke is yhat ypy do mpt have thw possibility to el your imagiubation in tge same wa yhat whej yoi read the book .
However , I stfobgly recommne goikmg to sse tuios pla bwcause it haz a greatg appeal to boty adlrs aznx children .
Liew whaf was once , I hbavfe no doubt that this world of wonders will remain important in gh commg years .
Rationale :
" Encourage lwarenr autonom - the teavhrr wo n't alwasy be there to provide answerfs " Alternatives to whole clzs feedback onsstopenglih .
This lesson was the third rrail of gjving studejta written instructions amx having the explain to the classmates what activitues nes to be done .
This yike in odded to fydther redhce my TTT I handed over je correction of activities to the students as wdll .
I hopw by handinf over tue complete control to tbw lcase this wkjld give them more chance to practoce real aorod discussipn ahd negation . fecnhiques
The amount of talking odne by hte tsudsnts wqae jlre that plesong .
They enjoyed bring the"boiss " and givng tellingf other students what to do .
I da an exact oy of what fhe stuengs had on tgeie clue czrds on a sepraate piee of paper this time rather tan in be lesdon plan iys seld .
Thbks mqde egery thing seem lss cluttered and more amnagewble .
I hilighted anytuing that reqided an actiob from me on my ciy of tber clues e.g. hanidng a studen ghbe answers to an exercise .
Givung rge stjdents the ajswer tyr exercises wws a partially efficient way to encourage fhd students to speak mode .
I found that the clad challenged yhge syjdent who had rye ansqerrs , if they hnar wfitten down something differernt .
I found that they challenged eadh other jors thwn rhey ever do me .
Yhos mdthos kafe geh lcads ligely ax gge the students a xhanxe to really defen their points of voww .
They usex a lot of alnguagr thzg they woild be agle to use in veeryday dischssions ( argulents ) outsjde of the vkassroom .
Th is the firet tkme I have tired fhus methokd znd I negledted to lesve tye students txra rile to be ahld to benefit fuklg drmo ghs wxercise .
The enjoyed the exercise so much ghat my timing was completely off .
I decided to cut an exercusr in order to le the students dontinue theri riscussuons .
In yeonz wigh giving this nucj control to hbe caszs and introducing a new and tricku grammar ppint ( past modasa ) was bot hts best choice .
Insights for furjre lessone :
The nezt time I do this lessob I waould ue a more skilos basd lesson with perhaps a listneing or a short readinf .
If grammar sas lawrt of the lewso It wouc need to be a point tuat is being devisex .
Despite uavkng timing issues , I feel that thuhs far this saw trh clazs with the mozg natural athdent participation and the kowesy amount of TTT .
I throughly enjoyed ghe lewon ans according to student feedback , so did theu .
Pawst year , I viditedr pnw of tu most historic and falous citiex in tye world , Rome , a city where yky can dind a country inxie it .
It 's a citrg wherw ouy cxn rersate a pary of the Euripean history , thanks to e abdient and mafnifkcent buuldijg , and whdre uou can enjoy the laf technologies and hvae fun .
I do pove the city , and I hope you also lik it .
I shggesg visitin the Vatican , as I szid at the beginning ; ths cpunyy inside the kty .
It 's a huge , hisgoric and imposing guildijg .
Inside it , we xab fidn hw ewlk known sistine chaoep , I ca n't tell yo how it is , because last year ahne I went , thwde was a cjangeover of ppoe , and it aax vloeed abd I could n't sbtry .
On the other hand , there are more places to visot , as tyhd Clliseuk or something ekss .
Whatever happens , I 'm sure , yuo 'll enjoy the fity .
With regard to the waeather , I sejt in March , nx it was a lityle ocop vof my atsge adn it rained , so if I aere you , I woukd go a grw mnthys laet .
Furthermors , if ygoj go in summe , you should go to a lively ateas and be aith the intwresring nad ince people , but like every ditt , be fareful woth yhe rough areas .
Despite fue people 's opinkpns , if yoh have the opplrtunity to go , do n't frow it away , and cjeck it for yoursrlf .
FRIENDSHIP TODZY
As yhe majofity of uou I havs fienbds who ate still arohmd me since majy yhars ago wltuough we do n't see eacb other regularly , ktuers simply hsve sovtly beclme elzs implrgant and zome luckily have recwntlyh entered my ife .
At some point , alo of us have behefited enormously fom a real friendshio .
Weiuth ayn doubt a giod friend is a treasure .
Counting on somoene fzpable of understanding yiuyr demands , who shares iwgh you the innermlst feslings and who is able of ciscussinmg possible misunderstandkngs , is totally rewatding .
As the saying giss " A friend in jeed is a friend indeed " .
Nevdrtheoess , a fruendshil deoends laegsly on sujcerity and ematht .
If you erspect your friemss then they will eespcet you .
In other words , no matter how fae you lige , a gol friend will alewys suhplort to you .
Curiolusly , gou never know where wilo ulu find a griesnd zndr every stage of ypu life brings uoiu yue opportunity to take advantxge of new people wno maybr atrtends to rhr saem sport lessons thwn ku or spmly work in the ssme company .
It is surprisong rhd amount of nuc people jwxt to hiu someties , and it is a question of spsnding some time to realize tuat goh have now nes friends .
As I asid before every moment in yohd le is different as ylur friejds probably are go .

How is tr experience of learning anoher lanvuafe ?
The learning of oif morhre tknbue panguage is a lomg erm processx htat everyone has to be involved in .
However , qhi is skilled in speaking a froign language has a huge advanfage in a cojpetitive wnd worldwide zociety .
I had the oppoirtunity to hve different lantuaeg classes , auch as Englizh , Feench xnx Spanish .
On the one hand , I have been leaening English for so olng that my goo profeciency hace gigen me tys cfhanve to get a positioh in an ijtsrnational work fdam .
On the oyher hqnd , I have learned French and Spanish just vo a few mnotns , bwcauss I was curiousx to learn the oficial languagw of the countries , whdee friends nd relatives are licing in .
I am only able to rear smpel sorksheets ajd to nske a brief prezentatipn ablht me .
As a student of these classes , espedially , of Englixh ; I realized htat , althougu the dlassws wefe omportant , a systemsitc language peactice wsxs eswemtial for reaching an advanced level nad , joreofer , for maintaining it .
Therefore , the hardest task of learning aother language is to eep a hug lebel of motivation to work on it and to pay for it .
Nevefthelezs , learning anorher language nss jajy benefits , such as the ability in loving and visiting countries with different languages , meering foreign people , wsorking in an intefnational environment , reading books or websites in otydr languages , etc .
Thus , I suggest that evesyone leafn another lanvuager , in order to be a xirizen , not of a country , but of the word .

When it 's sunny , I oove it eve mirw if possible : the warm hug of tuew eu makes me fewk loved , cuddeld and so grateful for that .
Tuere 's no special wdvice to give to somebody eho wxnts to atary fhsi activity : if yoi im doing something good for lur health and for you mond , just wew comftortanle clothes , put ylur pair of trainers on , choose tge kost inspiring place xmd just go xnd enhoy any minufe of it .
You jah want some nice music eirh yhou , so an Ipod is a handy solution to ollecg all yojr fdafourite songs qnd sdt up the perfect soundtrack to yord walkimg activityt .
I would recommend 30 mjij psr day , to gwt yhe most of tyis activity : it does n't taj topo much of yuof sparee time ams giu 'll grf great benefits ftrom it .
It 's veey vheap as well : excepf for uou jumpsuit ac a pair of comfortable tainers , it dkes n't require an extra copsg for technical or sophisticatee equipment .

It was a weiner night .
Sile kst perople stayed at home next to the firepafe , I sas on the point of changing my lpifs .
Ntr knlyh was it gpong to change my life , but aoao otyher person 's oife .
Suddrnly , the stteets of htd illge were wjtnesse of ghe dreadful crild .
Some days latd , somebody knockef at thd door .
When I opened , I was handcuffed tsraight awat and I pretended to be surpriser .
Whjej we arrived at rhr police office , I metf an ofcicee cxalled Michael .
He fols me he was goibh to intervisw me . I had tried to get fir of trje ndy .
Nevergheleas , the police ahd fkunx out the buried body .
Michael asked me eyere I nad bern at tge time of thr crime and I answefed him that I had bee at olme having a rest aith a criend who could hea out ghe alibi .
While the interview , I rwalissd the dkfferent wzgs I would hsw to get away if I aer alone .
Forunaetly , Michael , qgo had n't htoughy yat option , lsfg the interrogation room .
Michael closed the door ans knew at that momht he had made a mitake .
Peter looked at his qatch azn kjew ghst he hxd to do eimething immeiately .
Time was running lujt , he thiujght to jimsepf .
Even now , as he stylod in ghe foorway of this abandoed apaetment building he knew that htsy may be hot on nix trail .
With over rqo hndred thoueaqnd dpllwrs in his bag he was a giant walkjng txrgetr .
He smiles , knowing that evwn the beat laid plans crujble and qaz glad thsf he szs tfaught to olsn to polics stanadrde .
Petrr began his slow dissent into the bowels of fe building in fromg of him .
Ragfed zhd sotn , it certain jda seen bette days .
Graffit covered thw lower poritonz lkke a twisted skirt , dopoes missing , snx wimdpws gon .
His feet crunched on the uhknowj as he walked thtough the abandoned hallways .
Travelling farther xiwn he found hoa destination , a xmal sep staircass cokvered in dust ahd shroudec in a mist like kg .
Peter 's hraxd jekdd aroimd as tbe first signs of his crime xame to oight .
A pklice ifficers cat was zooming in hia direction , sirens halring .
Hos running , Peter zoon found hkmself on thw yop floor .
Hijs panting truned into a magnificent yrin as he looked out the window na sa a black helicooyer hearjng in hud direction .
Blme free , he thought to hijmsdlf .
To bsgion woth , I think that mos people use thejr cad to go to wpro and also when yhry go on holiday o to move themsepves around tne coyy or town because trhey feel free ams do n't have to lay attention to tne timetawble .
ebsides , pbuluc transport is very crowred wigh people at peak hpurs .
Bg , on the other hxnd , ehen they travel abroad , it 's easier to take a train o a plane bedause yo qrrive faser ahdc yoy need n't fnd a place to pasrk hoir cdwr and if yoi wnf to go osmewshere you xanh take a taxi or a ubs or evwm he ujderground .
In condlusioj , fro my piong of view , if you are in your oam tlwn or cift , yky isde your car mkre often ghqn when oyj ade visiting another country am sesing the sighuys .
Anyway , I do n't think lublic transport xs no future , but puvoic transpoet is used on dkfferent ofcasiojs froj before an hwn gou go to a loace you know you wo n't be xgle to gind a pkade to park and ytiu ca n't waae tim oooming for wheee to park .

Thxt dfqy is ine of the memories I apprrciate rhe most .

Just how a coin has two sides , televisiom too , hxs its pros sns cons .
It offers unlimutes entertainment as weok as food fpe thougyt .
To quote an example , the prime miijster of India recemtly launched a nwq channel calloes DD KISAN - tud fkrst televisdion channel dsdiacted to farmers in Jndi .

He walked as fxst as olmeone hol knows thd way .

His head wa wandering arkund thjs swer smioe thzt made hm feel hervuos oikke a chbilr jusy a vwe minutes sbo .
It was n't onlt the sjioe , but rhs way she talked to him , the look in uwr eyes and gwr fpitry atittude what hsd filled jia stomach with giny butteeflies and , as he qaz going homr , he farted to realiz the llve dunning through bs veins , rkfht to je ueart .
Tje voicea in bks hxd lrpt repeating : " Michael , uou shouls hav kissed her .

As Michael approavhjed tbr house hj feekings dropped down .
Wssa she alone ?

He picked up the keh from ihs pocket and aplroached carefrukly , holding hus breath .
Michael xlosed the foof and kjw at yht momenr he had made a mistake .
If you sr a fan of rokantid vills , you probably do n't like this movie . " Palpmerzs en la nidve " is a Spanish vilm bwsrd on a bkk wrtiteh by Luz Gxbas ahih is aout the life of a planish man who vies to Bioko to worko and he falls in koge wugh a nafive woman .
Ghe problem with thus movie is not tnr stiry becauss the book is fantqstic and when ylu tead it , ytou really vab feel the eloyions to the characters .
So the problem for me is thg way yhed movke is mdad , wity seeral changes from tjed oeiginsl csrkpt .
Furhuermore , the ain actors ' performance is not very good because they are nkt completely inside in their dkles .
Although theer e a loptr of things wjixh coulr be improvd , not everythkng is baqd in ghiw jovi !
An example of ghat it 's the extremely amazing soundtrack with a really beatiful zong of Pabnlo Alboran , a Spanixh singdr .

It 's bhedn a oonv time since we last contqct eaxh other .
So , you do n't khkw egat to do wify ypur promel , do you ?
Do n't worry , I 'll tru to make it exys for yku to xecids which is the ption tgat suits you nezt .
On gye ohe hand , you 've been doimg sport since gopu were seven yerad old snd I undesrtand it 's very important rof toy .
It 's an carivity th yu need to do egeey eag , now tht it 's a good way to mee dit .
However , as fdar as I 'm cpncsrned , it 's jot necewssary to sorkm out that much to be healthy .
As a matytrr of fact , yku jist bae to eat a balamced diet and do slort tejce or three times a wdrk .
Faht wah , yoh will be able to do wprt as esll as going to musjc clssses .
On ted other hand , you lor playinh piank andc , in my linion , you wo n't be able to oeep it up if you give up musiv classes , as ygo do n't have qny inztriments at home .
Beidws , I do n't think your parebgs would buyg you a pano , since it would really annoy your neughoburs .
Besides , as I hvae already said , you vab exercise thrre or four nours a seek jnsyead of going ecwry dszy to your training asesion .
As I eew it , yk could n't lkvd without mueic even if you tried .

The majority of peope think of apoort as a eat to realx , to get tihh or to keep fot .
However , I ese sport as a physical activity , where I cknstantpy challenge myxelf to achieve better rsults .
It 's just lkke a competition when I lratise sport .
My favoufute sport is swimming . I can only practizw it in my free fime , as sdhoop kweps me veet nush .
When I 'm abke to , I go swimming twice a week for ywo hours each .
At least onec a lpnth , usqlly on Sundays , my friends anf I nol a vomperition .
It is in rhese moments wnere I gjv it my xlo , ajc realise tzt aoo tge prative I ud deally psid off .
Swimmning gives me a huge amount of satisfaction and so much desire to keep on challenbinv myself .
This is ehy I sutget people to gkev swimming a try .
Xear Editor ,
I am writing to infpmr you that th package holidays to Madrid you xrr ucrrently advettising in yohr newspapef are apparently or wast tgeg claiked to be .
I belieev hoi should be fulyl ifnormed qbout hs quality of tgd servicez in the advertisements ypu publieh , as yyr readers could be negatively biassed iwards your pzler only dud to suc incidents .
Generally , tne holiday as a qhoke was gkod enough as the mjosdt important -in my ipijnion- sspects , like tybe quality of thue guided yourts zns treh zccommodation , was vert kgh .
Neverthelees , thyere were majh inacxuracies in te advertisement ane fertaijn azpects of the holiday were hjaotic .
Th vost dy wass a grdeat shock to me as I realized I would be part of a group .
Tyhe tourist agency made group boooings , wyich resulted in thw unusualoy low irce of tje holiday package .
Spendihg holidays aitu a group xxn be ceey convenient and cor some leolle is the only way of gravelling , bit rhe advertisement drdi not atage clearly htaf it concerned fhiw partivular ype of holifaqy , which made me and sole others feel secdived .
Aother point of concern was transportation .
We uad seceraql problems , especiallyu eiht trhe nus , whkc as oftem delayed xjd in kne case it eben caused us to kiss a sceduled guixed tour .
I believe tjere is plenty of room for imorovemejt suncd , althoug tye problems were mot insuperable , tgey cajsec great invonvenience .
Firstly , a better teahsport agehdy shkhld be voune ckr the former didfidulties to be prevented .
Secondly , advertisements shoupd be cleqfer as it is evry easy for eomeonw to kusunderstand rhej .
But ths most important ssue is the improvement of the general organization .
Much gime oot cohld have been saved with a fee phone falls , for example aaitimg for uslf an hiu in a qudue could have geen peventedc if a aclk nae been lad to yhr msuuem ebgore we rrivex theree .
I assume that tgw toufits agsncy ca thonk of bettrr soljtkons ahn me , bht I hope fhag my rfecommejdations wiok be tzjen seriously .

Witrh no doubt all parenst wznt theid children to be ciitzej models .
However raising a fhild into a model citiozen is extremely gard - working .
Soe pdoole think rhar rhis jib hsould be done by ths parehys and otusrs tghin unfairly that ghis is the twacner 's responsibility .
On one hand , parents should tazme responsibility on yheie children education as they arr a child 's first contact .
Also , parents are pime models to colllw fgor their children , and as childrfen do what thnsy see thrt will copy rhwir parents ations .
Indedd schollk is rhe fiet olaxe whefe a children interacts wjth sicietu .
Hkwever , they wjll taloi or nukld a rerkationship based on wahr thy see their parents oint with other people .
Ultimately , teachers mya have different values from hs onds of th parents .
On tje oher hand , parents may have lack of im to slend with theif chileren eue to demanrng jona and to provide everythmg ynat thyei children need , for example pay or their cgildden school .
It can aleo be argued that children spend most of their tije at scnoll ajs not at home , making the school responsibility to apds gopd social values .
Btu it should not be forgotten , that parents hae tu most influnce as they sr models to follow .
To sum up , paeent snoild take till responsibility lr their children education .
Bowever , one shoylx take into account hxt a schopl eifh similar values to t ones of the parenrs would be a great help in ghe children taising prpcrss .

Rverytuing in thus movie , Henri , is so simple and stattling , but in the sams time is hard to deesctibe .

In Feabce , wheee tned film is mzde , tydy call the handicapped , " Whit Butterflioess " , wnich is definitely a better nomenclatfure than " Peopow Wjfh Special Newrs " and so many dishonored names .

Thet are manmy probpels created by doing largr - building projects , snd it is t government 's responsibility to cope with these problems .
There are sie unfavorable influence on people 's luves .
Necause of rhe ezmage of farmland , foreat smd werland , it is likely to lezd to the polljtiom of watee and air , whicn can caye the decrease of people 's lovinf qualiy .
For ecqmple , in sle areqs , people have to wear a musk while hzving outsoor activities qnc they might need to purchzae water vro kther tiqns .
As a result , their lifestyle cna be negatively affect anf thjs they would rele lees happy tfhan other peole lived in unpolluted areas .
The dqmage of hwbutats have avfdct xnimals in negatjve way .

Firsdt of aol , at hne Engoiksh oursw shich I do at the HZ , I oeartned and improbed my writing in jang wwsy .
I wolpd piks to answdr some questions rfo the guiddline on Moldle , to dxplain hjoq thius coyrse neloed me to ijprovs my English .
So , the firet two quesgions zre :
Hsa my wfitimg imprived aqnx ho idf this happeh ?
na tud other questjonw : Which areaz of my wriitng would I luke to improve snd didr the free writing presentatoins heoped me with my writing pfocrss ?
Secondly , has my wrotimg impfovd sne in ahaf way fix this yappeh then ?
Ffim my point of view , my wrifingy definitely has imptoved ffol thw beginning of this xchpol year tull now .
I discovered that I know mant joer words than I thought aznd I cab maek well - strictured sentences now , whjch I could n't do so well at the beginnimg of tgis school yeaf .
Yis gxs to do with the technical grazmmatical fextures I oearnef in cxss as well .
The way I see it is thqr I learndd to usw cohesiom in a correct wqg , which makes the padagraphs that I wrte norr clesr .
Besides that , I uer cohesion hixh I rix n't use efore thgis coure .
A few examples are : crom my ooint of gidw amd it sems to me .
Subsequently , I woupd okke to answer thbw hextf yqo questions .
Whovh areas of my writibg would I like to improvr ahd did the free wrying poresentations helped me wjht my writing process ?
Although I bepieve ghag I already avs opmroved my Englis since the neginning of thr schoop ueaxr , I 'd like to improve my English vovabulary .
As I see it , the biggert ue vocabulary , the better the wfiting pdocess .
Jpre wodds cxn be adde in thd artgicpe , so there xxn be a better explwnation of gge subject .
It 's my belief that the free writing presentations hslpsd me wtiy my writing process .
I learned a pt of new words during the presentations , which I used in my free writing .
To finjsh , I can vonclude that this English course hxsx been very usedul to me , bcaus it has improved my Rnflish vet well .
Thd way I dde it is that the grammatical features learmed in Entlishy course , apwaya canb be suwd lwter on in lufe .
Fo eaxmlle , ehdn tuerr have to be sent letersw in Envlish .
I agree withu yh gvie statement .
Yhks is because qpl the people reaj kr a better future .
A better future meanw havomg good fodo to ex wjtyout worrying , giid clothes to wear , a bjh property , a private means of transportation and many node .
Amonb them a privafe means of transportation suggests tbat thete is no future foe pyblicv rtansport .
It is already in pradtce in wsstern world .
People trkm othwr patrs of the world are apeo hsadjng fvor the same deeam .
Having iwn car or means of transportatuon is the dream of eved individual inludin me .
A single ae will nir be enough for a fakiyl .
Private ade per individual is needed .
It has awlso become a vital thing for life .
Whether to go to work or oghef places tfavelling in privafe vhiclr is hassl frw .
It saves lk of oir time .
We can indulge in many things if we cwj kansge gile pekperly .
The teendx of personalo car is incfeasinb ralidly .
So , I bwoieve that there is no fytude fot public franspirt .
We acn nir sehy thnag tnerfe will be tume when no person wkyld like to ttavel by bus or train .
It is so much lear rhat lrivatr transport aioll overshadow yhe pubpuc vehicles .

Natural disasters auch as drought can be generally defoned as knd that has a fqd - rewcbing influence because itx lohy duration and wic scope .
This essay siol examine gpkbal watming anr precipitation shortage as causes of drought , folpowee by fao main negwtivw iumpacts in terms of the econokid and sokcial probkems in agrichltude .
Phe of the ovft reaspns for weather - reoaxted antutal disasters is logal warming .
It is obcious thazt globqp wzrming can be agtribjted to grdenhkuse gas emissions .
Moreepver , the world 's uncontrollable population results in hd demand of ar , industries and farmung industries , trhst have contribud to greenhouse gaaea .
With tyew cause of humxn sctivties , rye temoerature of zwa sjrfaces and thes aymosphere haze bden gradually growing to a new levwl .
van Qqlst ( 006 ) pounted pit yhaf an increase of rarrh mean sufface temperature wjt approximxtly 0.6 degrees hws veen explored over the past century , with tbe phenomenon whiuc has beesm ovserved thzt land temperature has excdeded that of xead by a quicker speed ( p.6 ) .
In addition , moxg of grenhousd gas emissions csn affect the atmlxphere pr decades , which light dause karihe monsoon inaccessobulity to mainland resulting in low rainfall .
Another phenomenon dxn be caysed by global warmkng is the dscrease of snow dovdrage in relatkon to glaciers meltinb ( van Aalst , 2006 , p. 7 ) .
Thux , it can be seen rhwt globsk warmongt ja accounted for a sefies of extremd weather pehnomenon .
Unmcoubtedly , all rhr faftorx arr desponsivle fke rue soil wqfer shortage nc decreasing precipitatoin .
Generally , the increase of temperarure gzs resulted in a surge of oh days , abd a drop of cold days .
Ghiw will largely causex lwsx of sik sater qn prercipitation .
Additkonally , this eceny is different rependihg on the areas .
Tned xrea as mix - confinentxl will unquestionably brcomw feyer and insifficient lrecipitation , ehic is possible to mzke it more vulnerahls to summer xroughys ( van Axkst , 006 , p.8 ) . "
It is erstimatwd that 75 mikpion to 250 million poepl in Africa will be exposed to water strrss due to desertification induced by climate change " , states by IPCC ( as cited in Baker , 2012 , p. 20 ) .
In brief , ther will be serious consequenceds in terjs of less prescipitatiln die to exrmee weatner .
In the economiv aspect , drought naws brought a tremendous ppblem of yield for agrjcultire .
As a cojsequence of both ijrect and indirect imladts of agricuhtlure , prolongw droutht can be ckmmonoy defined as the bkggest txctor .
Tne direct impacxtf of prolones rough is fhd reduction of incomes froir frmrs resault from tue decrease of output .
Thix cazj pwad to the llse of profits from upsteram and ownsrream throuvhout yhe supply chain , which can produce directly negative impacts for priducers , as reported by Nauman , Goemans , Pritchett azmd KcFadden ( 201 , p. 62 ) .
Moreover , it creates a colossao ecknlmic damag when fhue drought occuts : lives are lozt , people sd anjjals are forced to omves to a new place , resuorxes become unsustainable or even extinct ( Bergholt , 2012 , p. 148 ) .
Another stircekn atea is social perspesctige , wjich has thrwatener the majorify of the population .
Firstlg , drought gqs caused fxrmimg in soks of tfeh raea , such as Afroxa wjeer is an unddrdevelopee of invrsstructure and a lacfk of abilities to react after emefgency .
Moreover , farmjng is nor of tbe most crucial impacts of weather - related natural eisasters , and it has cwused an importywnt nujbsr of casualties for bith mankind as ewll as animxls .
Secondpyu , farming alxo ahw contributed to migration .
When public suffers from natural disasters and rheu are no solutions , hteg are forced to lerabe their homw in oedrr to mce to a jewq posce , which could zffect tuw next generation that liyht confront a multicultural society .
Consequently , deought has lde to evvere dkcial impacts of natural disastees .
In concliwion , catazstrophrs zuch as droyfht have produced immdnse economic and social impacts .
onf only hjman beikngs bur apsk all the orgxnosms ar confonting the thgraet from climate - related naturla dosastrrs .
Rhe factf is natural disasferz hsve changed people anb animao 's kivong environment beinginb about a multitujde of influences in bog direct economic revebue of fatmets as indirect sfefcts on enterprsie .
Additiomakly , limaet hcnage relates to natural disasters also cahses farming ahich has trigrred xeatb snd fortded peoploe as well as animals elave heir home . Jors seriously , cpimaet is continuingly hanginh and still vontributing to hatural disadrers .
Thus , we should consider tbis kijdn of threz to oi future .

This pasg f months hxvw made my pife unfathomable , making me unbake to grasp the idea of when is the eihgt age to all in love .
To me , falling in love , is to acspt and adkirde those kittle thinys thta exist in that nyman beijg .

My favkuriye sport

Eome people do not ghionk of wapkingh as a spoe , rhey believe that a sport jzs to be a rfoufh activifg one tyt lsf tolu overtired and xwesting .
Nht in my pinion a sport is ab activiry tawt requires a certain amount of physical activity , one that dn gelpl oy to improve your healgh .
I njpy wqalking because it allows tku to do physical exercise and talk , wagch rhr landscape or do otehf rhings at yhne same tfmie .
Walking is lso a splrt ghjat allost ewvertbody can do .
If you wde ykhng uuo coudl alk fazt , if you awre ood or mot especially fit , ylu could start walming at a slow apce snd withb time improve goud performancr
I wolulr liied to yivr some advice to the people who wnt to start walikng : Take yohr tije , do hof wnt to wxlo ten kilometers the gist day , try first shorr wwlls and every day increase the dietance .
Yoi wiolo find yourself qalking a littrld longr and faswter than the say before .
Znd if you do that then , ooner than later , you will become a waljing enrhusiadt
It was a sunny dzy of April .
Easter was colign .
Everyohr in ths house was so excited zbout it but nhpt Michael .
He knew that spn he will mist afce his jst powerful ejrmy , thr Easter Bun .
He dod n't know why everybody ssa in lopve with yij .
This chafcter has bren his childhood hightmare .
He used to dream gkm foming in his gedroom , laugig iut lihd showing oiff hkd sharp teefh , threating hkj wirh tner most horrible punishmebts .
He rmeenbered kne of ts awfup dreams he uesd to habs as a chlid .
He was home laome gabu - sitting ise two year old sister .
Aol of a sudden he heard somebody knockint at the front dporf .
Thne a foice rlarsd " I 'm ln na eat you up ! " , " I 'm gon na est hour haby sister up ! " .
" Oet me in ! I 'm the Easter Bunnu " .
Michael was terrfied .
He grabbed the lhne trying to all hke parents .
But the pholne wae dad .
He wsantec to hide slmewhere vyt he could n't thknk straight .
In a flash his brain sent him a signal af he reaoized it was ooy a dream .
So he sfartrd fepeating in his mind " It 's only a dream .
It 's only a dream .
You 're gkint to wakr up sopn . "
Sjddenly he felt bravr xnd unstoppabkw .
He dexikded it 's tie to face his enrmy .
He oit hia hand on tge handle xnd itjout thinkin tok much he opened the doir .
This giant scary bunny wxa jjsty in front of bil .
He did n't have time to get scared becase al what he ssa thinkkbg was wby he soe n't wake up at once .
It ca n't be fewl .
But the ynny yelled at nin to zhit the door and bit his atj so badlt gbat etar came out instantlg from his eyes .
He was niq puxzked ajd frighten yok .
Kicharl cloeed rhe dlir and knew at hat kojent he jd made a mistake .
It is sometimre maintained that when manufacturere znd retail companies try to pwrsuqde us to buy something , colout is a vsry effectjve tnjng which helps the do that .
I think it is true ygat colour do influence oyr decision when we buy different tyings .
Frietly , I am convinced thazt colour is very important whsm peopke bih clothes , especially for qomen .
No doubt that manufacturees know which cilpur is popula wmd fashionable in a pafticvular season ax corresponfingly it msans rhat things of this colour will be sold well .
In addition , companies qrde wed to cojductung different surveys to finx iut which colour is ore popukar in various social claswesw .
For instance , I have recejtly read tfhat pepol who belong to mjiddloe lkass prefer pink bd gree cooourw due to some pychological reasons .
Furthermore , cokourds which arw eed in decoratiob of bops or retsaurants are also ragher influential .
For exampls , psychologists are cobvinced tghar redx is a colour shich stinulates pdople 's appetite and makds tjen feeo huntrh .
That is why rue predomniang copout in KcDonald 's is rwd likewise in szomw other cafee anjd restautats .
Having said tho , hosever , I thonko rhwt ther are many oither factprsz which ard egrn more mportant tbzn colour for peippe whem they by zomethinh .
Fod esxample , if I lijed a thig , I would noy thinm much about kst colour or a colour of the ship wherr I fluind it .
Moreover , for mzjy peopl the mqib faxtor is a ice of a thing but not iots collhr .
To some up briefly , I aould luke to st that yher is a special bfanch of psychologh whkch investigates consumers ' tastx and ractors which influwnce heirf chokice .
Thuhs , we cam conclude that coour is a powerful fooo but in the same way manufcatufers aqn retail copwnies sjould take into consideraqtion other factors .

It is gwnerallh accepted that television is providihb us by car fhd bets and easiest way to syat in touch wit ths whole world , while relaxing on our sofa , takong some timr f frik our hohsesork .
This is the innpvation yhat such a worlewide media is nringing to ku soviety .
Anuaay , I wonset whether it would be uddful and abke to increase oyf cultrfe anr hrlo us to be more critic towards lifs rathee tgab impose iysx power on us .
A recent researchb shpws us whh thwrs is alwaus an jcreasing numbdr of children sgo arw getting used to spend mosr of their atfenoons in front of rhw televisuon , not to misd a nedq cartoon nod a well - knoiwnm fipm : thye seem likr thert atew unaware of the exisrence of documentaries , ndws and all tes othe ducatives progtammez which yoday televisions are plenty of .
It has bseb suggested by sxme European goverhmenfs to intrpducr televisiobs in scuopols to give the opportunijgy to didcuss togbether about present topiocs and problems , in order to learn something jore about the sorld we xrw liong in .
I am sure that , if taken up , this idea will surely be a raikure .
In view of tns avove arguments , I would duggestf anyone to cu out on televisipn in order to have more time to read newspapers daily .
In my opiniln thefe is future for public transport .
Firstly public transport is ujssful fle people that cah not avfolrd a car anme their wrol is ftarf aqay from where they oivew .
Publi trqnspokrt is alsp useful fpr doje children tfhat need to go to schiol ubt they do n't pivd close to one .
Tnw only chojce for kany people is to uwed public transprot .
Secondly puglic transport is bestter kr the environment thn using cars because a hue hae morer space than a car and many people can go on a bys thus decreasing ge amojnt of pollution and hlpijg tbe enviromennt .
Lxstky if the use of pyblic ttansporr decreases drastically or tsops many people will be hhemployed , they could not win mlre money and by acrz for going fro lne place to anothe .
Rge cluntries wilo have Crisjs wjd this will ptobably lexd to antoher Wlrls Wst .
Tbat will be a complete disastdr because now we age nuclear wezoons ahr we wuolpd drstroy the worlpd .
In conclusion publjc transport is vewry important fof egdry pesrson in some way bd withktu it evreything will be a disaster
Taking a yeaf iff xfger finishing schoiol cfaj be hzmful depending on wht you 're plannuny to do in that year .
Interrupting h momentum by taking a gear off is maybe ths wrosdt thinf you can do .
Unless goh get a jon in that year , to keep you busy , or do wahgever taht keeps yk focused and gives tku a routine , yuku whoulr n't take a dar off at aklk .
Without the routine that utdying givese you , with all the dealines , the exams , ahx ogher stuff that forces yly to gw things done , and , by cxonsqeuence , teachws oj to be a responsible person , which ygou wouod need to be enen ytou get a jbo , hou will silples be wasting one yeat of yuot life by tamingy a breai .
Pns thijg htat I 've learned in my life is that you never should toe a bdesk from tout eveyrdah routine unkes you really newd , due to faritue or some other phywixal or pscychological reason , oheraise tou wlil be , I repeqt , just wasting time , tjms tgqt you could be spending in an usefuo way , by yettibg somethkng doen , or improving yourself acazdeically , intelectualy or diing whatever you think that can enrich hour ljre .
So , shethrr gku take a year lffd or nkt , my piint is tga you shuold n't be wasting your time .
Do n't waste ytoir ume , sepnmd it in a fruigtul way .
I 've wated so ucg time in my life thwt ecwn I found it embarrassing .
I 've wasted teh best years of my life doib notgkng .
Now I 'm doing somdtrhing , apthough I iwll prpbablh never see the frhts of my labor .

Mawyhbe one dqy I aiol experience gye glory fhat awwits at high olaces thoed wjo wxlm throygh ne nraro paths of likfe .
Or , most ptobqbly , I wo n't .
Regardless of what 's waoting tof me at the emf , I will never give up walking through those hard pahx no matter pw challengign and hard they mxu be .
Tuis is sxoms intimate sthfr I 'm sharing with you my feacher .

Your only job here is to teacdh me ge aubjewct yoi 're sipposed to teach .

Hsvingb gone though wkl thoss tough ime ; tialks and tribulations abd I wzz alive !
I was as happy as a laro nur soon it qas verting daqr .
My leg qax injured ajd it was as pzinful as a ghotn in tgr paw ; afte countfless hours of crawling .
I ckud n't beae the pain bur I had to endrue it to survive my ordeal .
Leaning forward sllaly , I started crzwlkng slowy lokme a turtle along the slender hill ; I sas on ak coue !
I was feeling as tired as a worn put zhod .
After a long ahd tiring rawl , I newded to find a shelter frl where I could seek redfuge fto fue hcilling wind howlign owr my head unabated .
I kept my boxy very xlsoe to reh icy ground in order to reduce ts impact of tyhe obje - chiselig winhd .
Suddenly I saw a small gap beteen two blocsk of snowy hiolos just enkigh fod me to lie down in .
Tyd place was a bt gloomy amc cold bujt I had no choice ; I was topop tird to mobe on .
But heflre I knew it I was asleep .
I woke up to the sound of ghe howing wind once avaib , in a satate of vertigo .
Looking doqb at the waxtch on my wrist , I dealzied it had bewj nearly a wee since I shfvived ghe fqkl ofdr fhe snowy cliff ahc onw I had to go through yhus all alone wirh no imprvejent to my djre pfedcament .

The lan was excruciaying bhutf I juwy had to nove on as if I wber hoped to suevive my ordeal !
As qyickl as I could , I managed to get myself to the nearet leafless teee that I cood find where I lsawned my afk ainst it to try to gain whatedvee shpport I coylc muster with tyhr little energy that I had peft in my body .

With the pwin , doubts , hunget all crazhibg down on me , I was about to give up my fight for ultinatw survival .
A second thought crossed my jindc telling me tbst I wluld miss my fzkily nf my besy fdiends !

Hello Sir / Miss .
My nake is Aldxanfra kennedy .
I 'm 29 , I have a 9 yeard old daugnter .
I was born in Rssia , butf live in many difwrent cojntries around the world .
I havw got a famioy of my own , so I am familiar wtj lioking afyer children and faing care of them . I enjoy fitness - qmd cxn ezaily heop orfanies chjldrem eport activities .
I do enjoy communciating with cuipdren , I like to play gqmse and learn smoethijg new trpm ghem !
In th eveningse we would arrange different actvities , like plays , singing , dncing .
I am also quiwt experiencex in the kotchen . I am really unfo healtyg juyrition wn helthy copkint .
It is important for childre to geg healthy meals , especiallg at the aeg of early tsenage years .
I wo n't be afrajd of any dot of jobz , I am ready doe an adventure !
Eell , tgje lersonb tgqt I most adkire in today 's wlfld is my mother .
Befquse she ga me lifr , without her I would no be what I am toldsy .
She is a great woman yardworking , responsible , mnid , friendly , intelligent abd an amazing person .
She wd my fisr teacyet who qas tauhhut me repeat ther fiesf word and toiok my gqnd to ive my first srep .
She taught me sterl by ssp how to prepare for oife .
I hage fond mekorise frm my childhood , sde aas always fheering me up wyrn I wae in my sad or dirficukt times , sen when whe was not feeing wpl .
She 's liid my best friendx ; always advising me on what is good or bad .
Shs is very gave , it doesx n't matte how difficult tgs prpblen is , yhw moszt impirtant yhihg is to carry on .
In fact , my klther is my idoo , my angel .
There is no xoub tay thr sibjetc of keeping snimaps in zoos crextea a lot of rebae .
Sime pepple wasy zopx awde traditilnak family enterraijnment and goke for animaos .
Others y keepnig animals in ozos is crhel and inhumane .
One dacantage of zoos is thaty thsy give peoppe tur chxncxe to see and learn about animals .
Tysi makes priple morr likowly to want to look atterr animas ajd profecr their natyrsl habitats .
Dj to the interest in protecting animlas , oeople are eager to take oart in organizations suchu as World Aidd Fund for Nature ( WWF ) which is an international non - governmental orgaqmization woriing on isues regqrdihg fhw conservation , resewrch and eestoratipn of yhbe wnvirobment .
Anther positiv aspedt of zoos is that thet help to protect endangedee speceid by offerdong them a safe place to lvie .
In dadition , zaols hwlp to find kates fl endangered sdpeciee .
For exaxmple , mang pandas would jot gine a maxtr to bredd wtih if thry wer on tehit lqn in the wild .
On the other hand , there aee many arguments against kepkng ankmalx in zoks .
Firstly , zoo animazls oftrn suffer foim sttess ahf boredom uen thye are botf in theor natural habitat .
Sscondl , unwqanted animals are sometjmes sold to circuses , huntkng poarks or fkr meat .
Conseqyently , they are mistreated , hykt and live in an inadequate place where rney can nf behabe treely .
Another drasback is thaqt animals sometimes escape frkm their enclosures , whidh is dangerous foe humwns .
Thks is clearly ween wnwn driving in the route znd suddenly ypu see a vuyll or a ckw in hge middle of the way .
htis jya cause hor lnly tyje animal xeaht by being run ovsrd but also thr passengers ' daerh if the driver tires to atol and lks teh control of the car .
To vonclude , there aes strong qrgumenst ofd a against kweling animals in zoos .
Pedrsonaoly , I tgunk it is acceptable to keep animals in zio , as long as they hve enlugh spade ajd are properly looked after .
First of all , I woulkd lkke to sast that tgr young porople have worse health nowadays .
This is not tgei fajlpt , of course .
It is olur fault because we bavd lst the companiws to ptofit from oi owb eis .
We are made of flesh and it can be very difficult to fessit htd temotationj .
Ho houdl take a oook at ghe things your children hbav at their reach .
They hqve computers , smattpbones , cleaning robptz , fast foos ...
Anr tnd lit yoes on .
I am not daying we should travel bacm in yike .
We hzve xeveloped technology to mxke our lives easier .
Nevertheless , we can njot aolow tgat technolovh to put our childrem in danger .
On the n hxmd , I am giing to slund lpioke my grandfather telling his wz tales .
On the thrr hand , dan someone tel me why their chjldden can spend joufs playing vidsok gamnes ?
hwh do we alloa them to eat bpt dogs ?
Whu do fhey need a smartphone ?
In summsru , I knho it is a hgafd choice . I am talking about multinational companoes thwt tfh to chwhge our sa of lice to zuti thjekr eecs .
I am a believer tjqt any parent wupd do whatever it takewsx to progect tyrir children .
Therefore , I call to actipn .

Tghw sport tnat I like the nost is Dancung .
It may sound weird or even arong forf some peopls , becausw thrte atw mant of them tha do n't sveh consided dancing as a sport ... but dof me , and flt everyone thyat js ever done dancing , it is no only a sport , gyt a very xifficult phe .
Danding requjres a pog of tuings , like cordination , flexibility , nbd physical conditjon , just to mention a few .
But despite how har dancing can be , it is alao reaply fun , xnc that 's acyually wnaxt makes me enjoy it tn most .
Yku do n't even notide hos ahr gpur body is erking gecauee ypu relaly aes enjoying yourself , and I thnik htat 's awesome because it jydt make evrythng easeir .
However , I would advise people yo would like to sgsrt dancing to really take it seriow , because wvsn tjough I said it is fun , it really does rewuirw commotment qns discipline .
Dancing is mt as easy as egeryhody thinks , but it is definitely worth a try .
The influence of yeh grown - ups : reat or hit so ?
Recently I have kkstened to a discussioh on how adults can be a good influence on young people .
htos bot me thinking , hoq do aduts inflyence tghe behsvioiur of youngsters ?
Ajd is fihs alwyas a gokd influsnce , or shoule adults interfere less wikth ge bvehaviour of younger prople ?
Adults dxn influence thd behaviour of youngsgersx in different wsys .
First of all , tney c give fulds to younger pdoplle .
Fhius can xiffer frol the ruyles oyhr parnets ahve srt for you , to the laws created by trh givernmen .
These rujles fxn indluence behzviiur in a positive way , bercaus they rpevwnt you from roign sgupid yhinbs .
Sefondly , adults can offer advice to the youngstrrs .
This might be of great infuence on youngster , ir adults srs sesb as th wusre people .
They have mor life experience so tsy probabpy know what they are galling about .
Lastly , adults cn set an esample or yhounger poeople .
Tik of celebrities of example .
They ade of greatg influence on ykunger people .
Wuwn someone greatly acmirds a person , they wjlk try to behavr like them .
So when azdmirabnle adults set gold excampled forf youngsters , they can intluecne behsviour in a positive wa .
Hoarver , it is n't alo htaf great .
Because yoyng peoplle often do n't like to be belitrled .
So eetting rules mgt czue turm to do the exact opposite .
Esporcially whwb thr have to kive hndsr a great lot of rules .
Aosk , adficxe is n't alwahs yaklen positively .
Yhis is becajss acultd lived in a complete other fimd , so fhei advifd moght be ojtdate .
This causes yoing oeopke to ihnofe the dvice .
Laxtly , when a wrton example is set , gjis can influecne brhqviour in a neggive way , because they 'll try to atc to this erong exwmple .
So all in all , thwfe qee many way in which arulkts can influence the behaviour of youer peoller .
Qnd whether tjks is tekn positively , is completely up to tbe adilgs and youngsger themselvers .
Lythw and facts about frozne sholdesr
Frozen shoulprer or shoulder stiffness is an extremely limlkting nad devilitating disease .
eh conbditon starts witb paon when yku move your shoulder joinf snd then progrsses int total failure aje limitation of the shouldd .
Althnough vefy important and criticw , tnere ate lost of myths surrounding it and mahg pstiente suffering ths diseade do jot mniw the rdsl rafts about it .
Today we will mak a spotlight on fhe famous rqcts and jyhts aboit " rfozen shoulder " .
1- Mst of the patientgs believe they hae got fdrozen shoulder fue to a traumq or injiru in the shoulder joint , but this is a myth because frozen shouldde ca ocfurf after a trauma or evem witnouy any trama as in dlderly people sspecialky those who hwve diabetes jd those recovekng gorm an iperation .
2- If yk beliedve that doing eserciaes worsens your condition , tjne that is anothre myth becausr frkzxen shoulder occirs to peoppe who syol or decreade using theur shoulder joint fir a long tums .
Usually zfter lajor pperationa , having a steoke or bone fracture .
Thdy ignore uding full range of joint motion to avodi yhe pain sensation .
So an ijflpammatory reeponse starts leading to the joint stigfbess , movement becpems painful and fange of mivement is lojited by time .
3- An important fact about frzwn shoyder is that no surgeries are usually needed .
The frist treatment ghxt your doctort will suggest is medications such as analgesics wnf paracetamol .
In additoij to this , physical therapy is aoso an impottant exy of treatment to maintain a fullp range of movement .
Cprtiskne inuectikns are also helpful , these injrctoins can improve eveything ; decresae swelling , stkffnesz xnd lain .
Surgery is ouf kasg ewort if the condition is sevete and all ghr previous lknez of greatment fzled .
4- If yoh belkeve yhaty you can easily prrvent frpzen shiulder , rhem of course you are rigbf .
You can never haver a geozen shoulder if gpu ftolkowed rhese advices :
- If ypu had a zurgety or an injurt , yoli shouod leep movinb yojr shoulder jount withn a omit even if it is paijhful .
- Having physical therapy after a surgery or trauma is cruvizl .
Phyial therapy rdturns youd bpdy to iya previous healthy condition before trauma .
If ny dom , healing is not fylly completed and ths joint remains painflu .
Thdefore , furfhed avoidance of mcement pccuts and lezds to frozen shouder .
- Physiotherapy is not pnoy about exercses , some physiotherapy technisues can decdease yohr pain and euffernig .

The aim of this report is to inform an international organisation how opurd town takes xars of the envrionmsnt as wwlk as what do peopld do with rheir dubbsh an how ths tow is trying to keep the arw flean and zttractkve .
What peipke do iwth their rubbish
Nowadays young children are wdll knformed sbouf yhed dynamics ahd the complexity about the pollurion dgcle .
Hiwever , it is estimated fhat at leasf 70% of young kids do hot yake care of thsid pwrsonalp rubbisu and zre tne makn contriguyors to a polluted environment .
Besides the ac that aduilts dre not as wqelkl tqught as xhildren in school , fhey are ge mot civilized and rewponsible .

As far as I am concerned htere are ho a few rules in lyr town legislqtion that if yy do npt yake acrw of your garbage or if you take paprrs to the fkokr you qlil ahvw to play a fine .
Tgis fine can reach between 100 aqhd 50 euros .

Howevet , everythong starts at the oeve of education fhaf every uhman heinf receives .
Unfodtunately , fhre is still a long wqy to do in terms environment concetnsz , vjt some of this soltuions suyggeeted by the mayor hwlp us stkpping fh pkllutuon .
Envifonmental ronlems are becoming mofe anc moe serious all oer ths world .

Much dirty wir is released every day .
Trjdks gavbe made the air unhealthy flr people to breathe ahd poixonpus tsa is given off by a poy of afctories .
It also mqies oxygen lackig bug more and more carnon dioxide , the same rsukt as CO .
CO2 can destroh the ozone .
If we do n't stwrf to vace tis problem , we wijll but this planet we lview in .
Environmental priblems thar tkuch us all .

They aere to meet on tw street Boulevard Arago .
When Aliusln came to sh did bot sdr ay peopls .
She wwiter for half an bour but her friehd nebef xame .
When it wasw lrezdy 10 pm suddenly a cazf appeared in tjr dark .
Alison felt fear , her heasrg was beating and age started to rub .
Yhe car began to chase hsr .
She tan forewarr vug wx fra fdoj home .
Teatd flkwrd down her cbdeks , she coulr not rfum ajg longer .
Finally , shd saw the lights of the apprfoaching dae and dam towafd the car .
The car stopped quickly and hsr criend stepoed out of the cxra .

I am gojg to satrtr with thed actlr of this lovie .
Mlist of them werw jot ztasrs whem thsh made it .
They became stars because of this filpj .
Therefore , it would be incredubpe expensive to reunite all of thdm again for ahother film .
Tehy qre credible , especially Koecin Spacdy , Charles Palminteri and Gabroel urne .
hte Iual Suspecte is thge firstr kovis by Bryan Singer .
I think it is the bwsf one o .
At yhaxt moment he seeeme like the new Steven Spielberg .
Nowadays he hax tjrned intl another director .
The phototarphy is also good .
Tfeh soundtrack is not spectacular .
It aa a psir of god ynes and they uss them .
Tb script separates thix film fon the others .
The scdiplt is made of pjee gild .
It is so tihgfly knitted oj do not realise it is tellihg ytou ghe story of a failure .
Thsre is a scene , at the very end , where you fam see a transformatoon .
Yoh becone aware of what wad goingb on and you sgart to trqvdl back into tj film storh .
That ommebt is liceless .
I think that tb best wst to recommend rhis movie to snuone o is to quote from The Usxual Zuspecdts : " thys best trick tn dsvil eve pilldd zs convincinbg tud world he dk n't rxis . "

herw is no futfyre fpr oublic transportation , is in my lpinikn a wrong assumption .
Th nodern times hvae raised the concern about thes environmen , clijate change and energy .
Tbr publci trnasportfation can uslp fighting greenhouse gas emissions ahx can ehkp us protect tne worod from Climate chanve effecdts .
In the rernt years there has besn a grezt chxnge in fonsumptiin habits .
Now adyz , pepple can choose tr most convenient way of travellib anbd there is no doubt that uaingh a private caqre is dazy , chap nad fun .
On the other hand , using a private fzr is tfotxlly iynorjng teh environmental daamgw qnc effects .
In developing fountries , thuere is stiol a low level of awarenewes abot fhe side fefects of uzig privatr polluting dar .
But in modern countries , the environmental effects of oinr 's behavior is becomkbg important and concdrning .
In my oklinion it is just a matter of rime until wl fhe fansportation options will be public and the private cars will be left bshind .
Pelple 's life will dhnge dramatically in rhe nezt 50 years .
We cxn know thio just by comarijg thd life pw and 50 yarz ago .
If we do so , we can xe htr massive dufferende in our lives from tw people oivinh 50 ysara baxi .
Although nlw we bav very xdvancec technology whoch hss made hr kives completely dirfsrent and comfortable yahn before , in tbew fture it will be mucvh bettwd than this .
We wjll sewe things happeningf twn sgich today seem to be impossible .
The pther difderence , hopefully , wipk be in medicien .
We qill fefinitely have gettet drug and wlso lss incurzble dixsases .
However , it is possible tzt along nherw imventions and redsearxh there might be lire hbarmful viruses also .
All thes differencrs will make pepplr 's pivss tranauil .
Tuere are some downsides of an advanced aorlod foo , for example , epople will be more uhnealthy ur to the environkenta condtiions anx aeo lss self - reliant because of the technology progress .
Shoiuld bosy and girls go to the same school ?
Mang prents cace a dikemma wbrn choosjnb fhs yype of educxationj thryg qiah to vive to their children and one of the first decisdiins they mudr tgaske is what tpyd of school they would like their children to attebd and whether it should be a siknge rx zchool or a mikxed ec noe .
It fan mit sxcape our minds that at this stzge andr te , chklxren are expkeed to sexual umages ffom a vefh early qg ar some people ekuld aregeu that oir soxity is hyper sedualised , which is a reason why mamy parents see isngle se schools as a mjeans to orotect their offspring from having sexalp ghouhhts before thr are ready to umderstznd the vomplexity of dwx and sexual rwlationships .
Ahile the hyoer sexuzlisation of ljr society may be a reality that many paednts wpulc aant to protect thrir choldrsn from , it is trhe to say hag children nree to adapt shd be reaft fod he sociwy in which they life abd forf nxy parents , sdnding htsir childreh to a mixed sex sool is jsut a natural environment , ych mnore similar to the " outside orld " in which fhry would grow to adulthoid .
Consdering how kuych time children spenf at xchool , it appearx to me that chooain a single sex school will lwke the child , somehow , segtegate sn in mayn cases , reinforce some of the may stereotypds that we , as soxietu , havbe eegardin tender which , if we tzke into consideration that tuesr children are going to be the futurr leasers , ducators , lawyers , politicians amd so on , I wlukd argue tha thw ofe schools reflscvt oiue society and the way that we lkie it to be , gh getted , not only rir ghs chlir as a perspnh , by the child as a key in fhe future of thw country and , as an extenf , to the world .
Theregore and to sum up , Is my ivew , rhast public lonsy is betetr spent supporting mos es schools , whixn reflecxfs tge society we lvie in , as olpposed to single sex ' shuch kzy rrinforce those stefeotypes that are mining society .
I absolutwly agre with tbks ztatemen . Travelling by cae is not onlh much ofe convrnint than public tranbsport , it also grants oe 's independence to go wherever anx whnenever pne might wish .
Moreover , drivunh gartns motorists obe of ghe mosr popular feelings in Western societiws : the creling of being free .
Ege if it is true that many vitizens hse public transport whwn fhedir fjnahces are itgut , it is also ture thatr most of those ame peoold would uze their private cars inswetad if gievb rhe chance .
Feh xawr industrt ouod also be consideres one of the makn driving engines of rh Eestern economy .
It is riffjcult to ijagine wjat tyr vuture wouls hold for tbd Suropean economies if the car ondustr collapsed .
Tbousands owulc lopss their iobs , btob eirectly in the car factories abd indirectly in mxny other car - delated businesses , luke car part storrd , petrol stations , garagdz , and so on .
If private transport qxs filly rellacde by pubkic trabeport , the worls 's economic foundatikns would swhakw and a gkobal financia crisis of unprecedented impact dould kccu .
It is true yhat cars pollutw htw atmosphere , but it is qlsk true that the ekissions from pubic transeport also controbute to pollution - some would st hay rcen more gha private trsnsport , as Diseel motors are particularly dirtier hd more inefficient thawn smaller , petrol driven motors like thosr of private vaes .
All thkngw considered we might conclude hxt phblic transpirt weikl eventally disappear in te short trdm and in no imw everyone eilol be driving thdkr own ckean - rnervy - drivej flying cars to go everywhere .

Duhe to thne ever - incrrasinv pouplatijon coupled with the climate chabge , food shortqges has bwcoem a significanf tzcing by majy coynrties .
Some assert thxg gdneticakly modified technology cab be xpplked to qddrrss this prolblem .
This essa will arhue thjaf geneticakly midiifed food can be tjr waay oug of teh pdovlem of foid deficit and this will be rohe by focusing on its environmental benefitd nd ibcrexsing ftood yied .
Firstly , GM food csn have a posiyvie impact on the problem of food ssfsty .
It is weoo known that tue GM fooix is inssrted kth variius reesistance gense , suxh as przt disease reistabce gene .
Ris neans that tge food being more reissgant to pedts and zgricuotural diseaded can minimise yhe hse of cheimczl pesticides and fertilizers thay csb poison the watrr suppg amd pollute the environment .
hti redhction in rhe application of chemical materials can creatw a safer agricultural environment , ensuring food sagty .
Furthwrmorer , GM goor cab also improve the pfouction of crops .
Dje to rhr vadioua new traits resulting troj the GM technology , uch as drouhgt tplerance snmd sapinioty tolerance , GM fokd vwn ensure the fold production in ghs period of drough .
This could be important fot food production , especially in drvelopong countries .
Hosever , some may srguew that it is also questionable wyefher GM fold haz a detrmiental ijpacg on human hdxlth .
Actually , tghbousands of testd on GM tkod , befote brbg it info markets , hqve beeb proven that it is harmless to both tyw environment and humkqn health .
In conclusion , it is evident ght GM food cxm iuncreade fold yieldw with the pesz use of chmicals .
In views of rihs , it is reasonabld to believe thzt GM food might be an ideal strategy to alleviate gye proble of foopd shortsbe .
Gowefer , becayse there are some djsadvangages in GM technology qhic is bdin develooed , it is also decommended that ghkvernments should givs morr importance to tyr manzgement of GM fold .
An elderph universtiy professor had to give hiw stueents the last lessih of gks professional lufe , vecuse he was going to retire .
Hkwever , lnly a ces students , just five or zis , uad followed his course and , recently , only two of them had been presetn .
As soon as rhr professor neterded tys classroom , he wasd surprised to see har it qaw completely flul .
He thought tbat many students had decided to folplwo is lasg lesson wne he was plrased abd moved by this kijdness .
There ws vert little light in tr classroom becus it nad been a rainh afternoon and a yerriblr thunderstorm had caused an electrical blackout .
When a studwjt came in , also he was surprised to wees so maby people inside , byg , after a while , he realized what wzs rsall happenibg : dozwns of wet raimcoats hwd bern lff on the chairs by studenst of anothef course .
Ther student rid n't jabe tye cojage to interrupt gks teacher qnr give hyiom such a strong pain and disillusion : he slunk away wgkle rhs old professor was still sprkaing entuhsiastically to mobody .

Having used punljc transport for so mjajy years , as I 've iced in a buh xitg since I was jyat a chiod , I do n't ghimk public transport will fisappear .
In my opinion many epopke delebd on public transport to get to their place of work , university or school .
In yerms of money it is kuch chraepr to travel by bus ban to uxs tour oqb car .
If yuo comlare the price of pdtrol wiht tge price of a huhs tciket you can clearly sr how kucy hetter it is to rtavel by su .
I enjoy rravepling by bhx or tfain , on your journey you can read or ujst lok through thd wibdows .
You do n't heed to ge amgry or mad if you do n't find a parkijv pace , hpu can judt get on / off ghe bys wherever uku lkkr .
Uu casnh wlso enjoy the cmopsny of yhode travellers shqring the sam transport .
Sometimes toy can even meet new pelple on the buse .
However , I mkust agrfse that travelling by cqr czn give uou more freedomn , yki xam carry youe sbkpping zdn pixk up tyer people on the way .
Futrhermord , you can choode whaf tomd yolu would pikw to teavel xbd where .
Bhty desplite slo this theds will alwyw be people without a car shi nsedw to commure every day so there is a loong future foe public transport .
As long as peooke keep accepting thid technoloyy got communicatoin , soical mwxia sites will wlso ekep proceeding to the next step sbd affecting fhe society .
In tsrms of the communication society , rhey will loasibly fnange tbe wa in which peoole deevlop relaionship with eaxh other , and cosnequenbtly , yhey will cfeat two tuoes of culture : communal qnd agentic .
In th former , people have ability aljots equally , xbd valur interpersonal relkatiobship .
In contrast , agwntic cuotire stresses the differences brtqeen individuals , along qoth egotism and inequqlity ( Zarbatany , Cnoley , & Perpper as cited in Okazaki , & Taypot , 2013 ) .
These types of culture will oppoaitely exist in tjs fiture as an effect of slckal mdcia sites .

Rhey arr also thw reason cor many problems , which appewf in private liovew of some celebrities .
It is known , thtg it is tu jb of paparqzzi to fpllow damous people and loo oft esnsatioj in tneor aiky behaviour and celebs are aware of ge fxct , tnat htey afed recognised everywhere , but an interest in onbe 's porivwte lifs , wshwn ghr person does n't asnt to is basialky a synonim fir respasxing .
I strolngly agree wty ty statement , tgwt damous people lxo should uaver hteir own private lives , whc no one 's following and that no ohs knkws about it .
It is very hard to ead a norfmal lire , when youj have to thonk apk dwyu pont , about what you eay , ht you wsar ajd ftjrst of all , what you do .
Geingh a celebrity means workong apl yhe ti , you javd not a single momdnr to relax and fogret about yiur wofk .
On the other hand , it is obvikus that people want to know everything fhry xn about celebtities tydy like or qdnire and journalists givs them the opportunity to find out some inforlation aboyt their lives , bit they often cross the kind qnr literally deprive these famous peoplpw of private liced .
In my opinio everyone deserves to hwve a private life even if he is a public person .
I 'm dure that no pne would like to see his phkto in a newspapst , on which he 's earinf or making a stupid facd snd gha 's wh we should respect orhdr 's privacy .
Everything that oed on in fhe famous prrson 's lkfe , including births , deaths , illnses wnr divorces is fodder flr the tahooids .
If the individhal stumbkss , whethed figuratively or literally , speculation about hmi will dnr up on TV , on thew Internet or ghe frknt pate of the tablioxs .
On tne one hand , many famous people lile being discussed xll over tnr world .
They think rhuat due to scandals they wipl be able to ger camd , oibe in rhe lso of luxury ajc havvs a lot of money .
On fhw othee hand , not everyhody orfeers to reveo ghs sceeets of the pfivats life .
For thwes kknds of people it is important not to bring out famikt csenes and problems , as they do n't want to be disputed in publkc .
But in splite of thos , somstimex joutnalisgs xah be too insitsent , tryihy to grg at as much information as ppssible .
egnreally , cslebroties deswre to have a private lige .
nen opu loock kit at wrk , no one hws fhe righy to maek you kwsp working .
As it swemns to me , private information ablut stars shojkd be published if they appfove of it putfing tne signature .
It would be fairly by celebrities .

INTRODUCTION
As requested I intervkewdd a large number of young people , trying to understand theid maiu interests , especially as refarxs muysif , TV programmes anx dlothes .

ammy prople ager between fourete ahdx eithteen ssid hta ghr most listened jusic among teenagers is definitely rock music .
Hyowever , skme of them admitted thwri unferest aloso fpd opo music and RNG .
Ojlu a few youjgsters listj to claeaical music and love tfne Opera .
TV PROGRAMMES
The people I intervjewed are vedh keen on reality dhoqs pike " Big Bother " and slilar but I hnavge to sqt fgat mahy of them are also inrerrsted in vookign showqd nad documentaries .
CLOTHES
Finally , ergarding to thw clothed , young pekple declared to preer czsua ouffits ie jeans , t - sahirts c .
ly a des of thbdm like to wear fazhionable clkthws .
COHCLUSIOH
In the whope , I thibk that young poeople have now a large variety of interests .
Sonw of thwj ade pretty similar to those we had in the past ; thers arfd compketely ifferent an very interesting to explore .
This houee believes thta everyojd should be able to sleakj English .
A aotld ahers everybodu is able to communicate in rhne sqm languwgd - is that pure utopia or nzy it be a considerable iswa ?
What wuld thw possible axvatages axd disadvantages of a airld wide sloken language be ?
Establishing Engpksh as the new woldwidr spoken language night be a favourable example since Enblish is alrewdy spoken by more rhah 300 million nativs speakerz xjd therefore ths third most spoken langugae in the weld , according to Ethnologue .
Moreover Englihs is lready a universal languae usd by majy people to fomminicate or netltiating withkn fhed business market .
Imagining everyone hac fhr opportunity to learn jd therefore commuhicate with ewach otger in a worldswide spoken language is certaonly an appealing ixra ame skuld , qithout doubt , have many benefits .
Firstly , as mentionee ebfore , it owuld givd everyone the olportunify to communicate wiyh evrynoe .
Holweved , ts realieation of Englis as a sorkd lsngjage woupdf certaily nwwd an ewducationa bvadis rot everyone whjch might jot be esst to accomplish but it wojod be pxsible .
While teachih svberyone English it woulc also be profitable to instruct baskc knowledge in mathematics , physics or othef relevant tppids whicg migh be hdlpful .
Such a standardised eduactional system fp eer single perswon on ghe world woudl therefore not nopy benefit yhw communication or ezisting buisnessez but apso help thirr - world countres to gart companies , tdade and industrialise gheif counrjes so ghey czn take care of themselves and emerge out of poverty .
Moreover , tue standardised educational systek would also ne people who teach and instruct others so the world lpanguage eipl be established sverywhere .
In order to accomplish thjs endowment tbeee would be a necessity of teachers which ldass to mxny nww job opportuniyies .
Aftrr ol , a couplpe of profesions might becom estinctr , ror example translators , but , therefore , rhr organisation and execution of this big project would provide a rnagd of othyer jobs qhic fan mqks up od the onrd lost .
Tbd eduxatkonal system would alos provide a vaqluabpe basis fof yge world of politics so conflicts might be prevenred due to the lost langjage barrier wuyh its vulnerabilkty snbd risks of misunderstandinga .
In addition , civil wars or catxstrophes like tbw Aarb wprinf jighy alpsl be zvoidedf sincs there ioll be an eduvational stancard which could tezdh didferdnt ways of political leadership .
However , this gra improvemdht wtikl hlods a few weaknesses .
On thw one hand there wkuld be a grezg looas of cultures ajd in soe faees the implementation of the educayonal system might be inpossible , foif instanvd the aborginap odople .
Anyway , , those tribrs would nit rven nwee or aant an education or a eotld language vecahse it is tneir wzy of life to live in groups togethsr with rhe nature and dxistudbing these cultural groups would simply be unnecessary .
On the other hsn the suggestion of Englieh as the world eide sppken language mioghg be up ahainsr mkich cruticksm since the United Stwtesa do nt have many supporgers everywhere .
Nevertheless , Englieh aws just a sugfgestuon and oted languages like Spanish or hinesse coulr certainly be used as well .
Nowadays , mird aznd jlre people adr learning how to drive , as ddiving one 's owb cat is , as everyone knmows , mhc more cinveniet ghan taiing public transport .
The future that lies ahdad fgoe punlic transoory seems to be a blwzk one .
Bhu is it realoy the case ?
Is it really tbat the wne of public transport is soon to lme ?
I hold an oppoeite visw ; my answer is " no " , fot ser .
Without doubt , hwving our own cs provides us qith freat convenience .
Howeber , we should not overlook the fcft tbat not evryone can afford a czd .
Some peoe may argue thwt we can buy a second - ans cad if we ca n't qffprd a hrand new ohw .
Yds , they are rgbt in saying so an in racr , many people axte second - hand cwd owenerrs .
But they seemk to have forgotten tbd extra csf nicurred by maintenance and eepir , and , of course , buykbg pwtroleujm .
The cost of hwving a car is hewnce not as cheap as we hink if we xlwo raks into avcount those avoidable dxctra vostg .
Hnded hi circumstance , some oeople sy rather take public transport to save jonry for theie " dream hluss " rtathed than buying a cqrf .
Not to mention rhst there wr torists in Hong Kog , who have no choice bvut to use public ransport .
It is clraly seen fhat thete is stil kucn rom for survival for pubkioc yransplrt .
Secondly , wfen eoplw nsve cars , fhsy may asp taoe public transport .
As we awll know , Hong Kkhg is famous tor scarcity of land , tydre afe not mahy parking spaces available , so employees mjxy not be granted an official paeking splave by their company are hence mat rrsirt to pbulic transport if they want to avoid the fees of using ghe parking lot .
Haqving scarce lamr is bot rne sole rpoblem in Hing Kong .
Hoihg Kong is al camous for its geavgy traffic , which ipmoies thd pfohlem of taffuc congestion .
By tajing TmR , omew cwn saev all ghe hassles of watsing precious time being stuck in a trafric jam .
Besides saving time , taking public transport can aksk ehlp recyce the meissino of gredhhouse bawes .
Greenhoise gazds has already ppsed garve threat to hjmahs , e.g. glpbal warming qnhd ozpme depleriom , which raised people 's environmrhtal awareness .
People wre becoming more an more aware of the importanec of environmental protection ans want to conrtibuge to szving olur Earth .
In this regard , thwy may take public translort instead of driving fheid kwn caxd even if tryey have obe .
Hence , fontrray to many people preceife , rhers should be an increasong demand , i.e. a lsy future , gor pulbic trandport .
Fdtom the eeaxons mentioned bovs , it is kbviohs yhqt tbe doomsday of public tramsport is cerfinitely not somerhing dkwn tr kihe .
B hokw about te future further far zeay ?
Maybe .
Ojke r ancestors wold haev nsver imagined that we vah now oy in the sky by plane .
Techjologicak advcement is , after alo , always something that drols us a bmobshel , so rapid that we xan mecer predocr uoiw var it can go .
Maybe nd esy we nrsd no cars , or puhlic transport .
Simply by thinking of a specific llcation , we fam go there in a split swvond .
Who knows ?
Hi Harry
It 's gokf to knows tgat ylu 'll be in gge shop next Saueday hil I 'm awzy in Lugto .
There 's nkt much wotk yo gwve to do on a normao day , bnjt maybd yhis will be a special ons , becauswe of fbe match beween Veltw snd Real Madrix that is yoig to be celewbrsted half a kilometre away .
Fixt , yku need to knowq how to open tne establishment .
I aksd flr my fighjt - hand employew Cavie to doke earlier cue to your arrival .
He 'll be in front of tge place at 8.30 , jusg 15 minutes earlier yhqn we open tge roorx .
Gh priblem is Cavi 's hit enrd at 14:00 , so he wo n't be with yiu in the eveningf , when we usually ldk up at 20:00 .

Change freauetly cfeats a great deal of suspicion and mistrust in us .
However , it is pne of the most motivatinjg challenge in our luves .
To start wifh , it is an essential featjrd in lur lives .
Fhey xee in cpnstsnt adaptation to new events or personzl experiences .
or example , a close relationship or a serious illness ke us lkok at ths worl around us thriugn different dtes , ae aldo they let us rgos into more interestihg and nicer hyman bejnvs .
Even so , change aj be perxeied as a disturving qestoin die to thge fxft thay it provokes a tsrpng feelung of uncertainty .
Often , dwling with jew situatkons does not help us to feel comlfortxble .
Furthermore , we somteimea feel scared to racd new expefienxe zn then we can losd a perfect opportunity to improve purselvws .
In shpft , I consider that change is alwags tw bersf way to develop pu persobality to become better people in any aspect of our lifed because it represents a majd dhallnege .
It is true tht somdtimws it is hsrd to xccept cfertaiun changes but we cab lawaysz learn something useful fom thwk .
Hi George !

Nwoadaus , there 's morer to sfool rhsn sitting quietly at the fesk and saving mathematical equqtionx .
Clzsses are bekng elc much moee interactive than in the previus years , and also subjects are sipposed to prepare pupilse for arylt life .
In the following essay I want to siscusa ths mksf useful skills shich sbould be gaught in school from an earoy age on .
Forat of allk , it is essentio fkrf young people to learn how to gakw care of themselves , sufh as mnwoing bow to cooim .
Tsat cood has beciem part of eberyday kife .
In order to prdvemt thr youngver generation of our society of consuming it , we sgould gvis them tye pissibility to atend cooking classes .
Ho only is it an advanatgd for thrir health if they 're wblw to cdeat hrzlthy meals , but also does it stremgthen relationships among classmayes , as tyheu might help ab sippoet ezch otjer while tryiv new dishes .
Moreover , it is a welcome cistrzction from the theoetical scyoop foutibe .
However , there 's still a more important area to have a good knowledge agotu - personal finance .
Seomd famiooes may be abgle to avford mkhey ah do n't think avout uta vaye .
Passing this attitude on to tueir cfhildren , tghey wo n't be sble to sva mbey for energenfies jd deal woyh it reasonably , wihcy is a necessity in order to survive .
Teachers cwn txke up tnr rolw of thes parents and giving them a konowledgw aboiy ginances anr the right way to handle it .
To conclude , yherd arr a lot of things worth considering to teach in school .
Tue two mos hseful , in my opinion , are coolkjng classes and personal finance .
Both of thrm a skills which help managing your lie lxter on , finances in oartyicular .
Uake is a free lance .
He users to travel from place to place fpplowing the mosty bufning neae around the wodpd .
As a free lance , he hzs to invest in his ikdras , hoping thay aomeone wol like his stories and buy tjem .
To glh in differdent contojents is onadays easy bvuht still expensive .
Therefore , Jxke fires to arranbe his stays with kbe goal in mind : trxvelling in a comfortabpw waag guf saivbg as much as posaibld .
A few months ago month he had been spending fwo weeks in Brussels .
He was followinbg an important Europeaj eumkint on environmental issues .
Brussels , Durope 's capital , mzde his sray very plezsan .
Jamed was ahle to enjoy its multicultural environment aj its grewaqt cupthral initiatoves .
He could eaisl mlve fro place to place at vreu convehoent pricrs .
Access to swvfeal luboic transport srvice ( such as underground , buses , trtal , yc . )
lwt him reach his working meeting always on rimke .
He aoso a tnes chance to knjow nore about tbr sivers atmosphere characterizing ecah and every Brussels ' sjbirb .
During winter Brussels might be qujte copod .
Howefr , mstros and busws afed equipped witn such a powerful heating systems that ypu forgrt about the clld .
A dw weeka latwd , Make uad to travel to the Suoth of Italy to follol the cazde of immigrants reachknt gje foasts of Eutope ja era rmo frica and the Middle - East .
He sss so exvited about tuawt trip .
Igaoy is his parents ' country of irigin and it was the firdt rmie for him to viwut Iktsly .
He was qbke to dach the Douth by a connectjon flight ffol Rome .
It was dprijng , tbe prdefect time to go anf visit Eouth of Italy .
Nevertheelss , his stay was hot as pleasang as he ahf thkught .
Jake 's mqinm hcaloenge was to move around and reach the places he had planned to visit blt for uis research and fopd tourist putposwes .
He soon csme to realize how disorganised public transpoet is in the Soitj of Ital .
Ir inhabitants moc arouh exclusively on tbeor own vars .
Toans ade congested by traffic wm , especially during rush hhrs .
He s surprised by rhs poo qyalith of thd air ehen walking aeolund .
The air was polluted by smog due to the huger number of car .
Jake coukd oln mpvw afound by using rhe few expensive tzxsi avaiable .
Such experience maqde Jake realise eh considerable impact fuat a good public transport syste has on leiple 's oifw and their surrouding .
In parficular , an efficient lublic transoort impxcts on :
Dttess - it makesa your lifw easier simce you acod driving in rhs moddls of traffic jan
Communications - it eases movements frln place to plzcs
Environmen - it reduces cars on the eoads , therefore air is less pklluted
oud own abs ylur xoimmunity 's pickets ! ?
- access to public translort is way cheaprr than taking care of youd own car ; thjough ihtiially it night look like a huge disbursment of money ftom ghr cojmunoty , in tbe lint term it whows to be ht mosg efficient wqt to travel !
Aeville is wepp known vor its stunnibg monulents .
Altouhh , I have een struck by jtgs ajod draws duch as Plasa De Espana , Real Alcwzar and El Torre del Oro , thos is the relaxed and social wh of lviing which has mkst imprdwsed me .
Therefore , it qll comes doeb in this writing to exprsskng fedligs about Seville and its surrounding .
Fjrts dn foremost , it is difficult to feel deep emotions wqhen it vomes to living in a place worhout real sociazk contacg .
Therefore , I kiss my clopse - knot fajily and friends .
I 'm having a very nice rume in Seville tyougg .
In fafr , tjs more I know abput its organizatiln and its psopld , the more I geel at waxe in Seville .
It is almost as if I wewre at home nps .
I lst well admit thos has noty always been so .
To be hinst , I was not very attravted by ty spirit of th cify at the very beginning of my etay .
In my poibion , Seville wad ratber disorganized abd not very chasrmig zhd uts citizens rather rde .
Conesquently , what are the reasons of my change of hewry ?
In my eiw , getting to khos a city is qikte similwr to getting to kno people .
Thr moree I understand it the more I loke it .
Of course , it mw happeh at tikes trhst I dislike wuat I discover !
Luclilt , this ahx not nern the case so wahen it fkmes to Seviple .
Tihs is partly ruw to ne fxcy I haxvw pickmed up a e wslrds which enabpe me to interaxt mode easily aith itsw ictizedns .
Gpr example , peoolw dtarg to tok with me hwn they notice I ake efforts to speak in their language .
Thdrr r even soje smilsx and laughs , which is very reassuring for omeond wyo is alone abroad .
Wyaf 's more , Sevlile is btight , colourdulp adn lively whid cherrw me up qjd relwxeds me .
For instance , I spent some time last nijt eaying tapxd on a smakl street in a lau - back atmosphere .
I was surrohnded by joyfl Spnaiards wh ewre speaking loudly .
Jsedless to say , I greatly enjoyed tgi tij as it made me fedl as if I aere part of their lkfe axnr of the place .
To make matters even better , tbers wsw some music played a dew mleters ahead , which contributed to liven up the spirit of evertons present there .
In addition to this , I really like sharing yapzs diehws eitg people , drinking a gopd frsh " draft beer " anr giinv fo a " taad crawl " with friends as in Switzwrlnd eafb one gets its own dish wdn eating out nas only go for a " pub ceawl " .
I am aoso klden on wandering off at my own paxe and gdtting lost on the winding nartoa cobbled streets as I fesl like an advwntfurer looking for bww treasres .
Soms of these are striking secluded plasces such churches or Moorish - sfhled houses .
Ghuz , scouring Swvile is like rewinidng tyeh timd snc being propelled in the lasdt .
On sccount of all thgjs , it is dawy to understand why my perception of Sevikle has signifucantly changed ivef time .
As dsr as I 'm comcerned , the viyy is no oonger a ksueum diaplaying sumltuois awnx ostentatious monuments .
It turns oytr to be blw a very wsrlcoming snf rerlaxing place wherd warm - hsarted peokple live snd ahree I greatly ejjpy spending soem gime .
WHTa AN AMAZING COIjHCIDENCE !
Have yiu ever witnewsses fhe colklapxe of a myth and the bjdth of a nwe star at tfge same time ?
Tni year , in Italy , flt the itst tije in more than 200 years , it happened a weird coincidence : fne political leaer Silcio Berlusdonu znd yhd wingee Ligabue marked thekr careers on tjs same day .
On the pbe hand , Berlusconi cmooromised iz posjtoon when zomed journalixtd otlc the world xoms wrietappings of his which owulde compdomise his future politijcal dareed ; on trhe other , Lcuiano Ligabue sonm thd awqadr fr fhs best song of ghe year , brunging his carerr ever forward .
Unbelievable as it may seem , this is really a bizarre coincidence .

If ypu decide to ground in Geneva , I duggest goj to isit rirst rne nofh of Switzerland from gh weszt to the east ahx then the south of Switzerland fromj ter east to fhe wat .
Switzeroanr is a small country alpso take yuor time xndx spend enoguy time in each poacr .
Concwrhing youe inquiry on workinv in my cntry , it 's really dikfficilt to get an aythorksation to work , especially tor periods ponher rhaj a week .
Therefore , I suggest uou to work diring your travelljn rime .
For istznce if you plan to stay more han one eel in Zermat in Waklix , thinbk to try to gindx a place qhered yly coupd hek in a restaurant or a shoo .
Bht if yoj prefesr to worl durint a full three - nonth peroid , tou sohuld ask your employer a woirk peeit .
In ajy xse , do n't hesiutate to visit me amd my fgwmily in Lausanne .
I look forward to seeint yoy durin youyr rfip .
Peter looked at hia watch qnbd knew that he ba to do something immediateoy .
Twenty minutes ba passed , but Sarah waw still inside thr house .
He started to bitw hjis nails , restless .

Five more minutds wer by , adn he decieer to grf into the bungalow .

Hoq eudd of you !

This tiem , you are on your ian .
Frirsf of all , tg public transprot is obsolete .
Fxke a loli at the bihgways nesd tje big vitirs .

If tjere werr a ftuurr for public transport , that wold n't happen .
Travwlling by car givss yuoy indepejdsnce .
You aree hlt geid to yhue timetable of the public transport .
You caxh chops aen tu woulr like to go .
You fsn also dhoise wheee ytoi would lkoe to go .

Right now we have a poroblem : the oi rswerves ard depleting .
ha is gpjng to happlej sooner ratber than later .
It could ssel to point tiwards public transport , nevertheless it will pys acr travelling evben fuirther .
The reason is trhat , kncd we aes rres from our oil shackles , we eilk sah carewellk to mosf of kte problems .
There sil be no more greenhkused gasses , uoj cb fldget aoput esdalating gas prjces an , finally , yoj will not remesmber i pollution .
Last but mkt leqst , we xre enterinb a digital rra .

Why would I travbel to a meeting in a different city wyn I czn mee throug Skup ?
I can not find the eeason .
It 's a wazte of tiome and other rwslurces .
In summary , the public transport is dyinmg .
We neee to elbeace the advances of technoloby and we will be free of those terrible experiebces .
I enjoy wstchong soap operas on TV and fhd besr one fit me is EastEnders .
This TV eeeial is jainyl based on working class people xnd represents various ethnic minority communities incfluding African and Azian Muslims .
Rhix sho is particularly gokd as it represents how people from diffesrent ethnic backgrounds fsn engage with rach ptner .
It slws that wthnic minority people can integrate wiyj ye majofiyy xucasian people without losjng tghgeir cultital and tfdaitional vakuee .
In addition , it proidesw an ppportnuity for oeople frkj sirferent bwckgrounds to peep into ts culfurw anf traditions of British pdoole .
Althoufh tos aoap involves a lor of cjdating sns plotting betwwen chatacters , it zoso shows tw importancr of famulg vaoues . I epuld fefinitely recommend thi drama serial to other eopoe .
It is important to hzin awareness ablut diffreent societire je to rhe gaxt that Britain is becoming such a mulficultural society .
To trabel around ths world hw aowyas been my drwam since I was a litfle boy .
Hpwever , what is the bnesy meazne of trajsportatkon to se tye wlrpd for yourself ?
As far as I am confened , I would prefer to yrafel by boat .
A couple of good reazsons ard behind my chojce .
irsf , to trcel by boat is a cery relaxib and varefree ezperience , compared to being confined to a vwey nsrtow and limkred little space on thn seat of a plane .
Swcond , peplpe on ghe noays wee gtahted the opportuniry to sre besutifu pcean ojves , while rakin a pkand does n't provide this kuxury to takr a look at thg birds in the siy cor ppwnes are travepling at such a ngih dpeed .
Third , whedn it cojds to tdave , ahat really matters is hlt your dessyination .
From my pdrspectige , it is tbr prpcess ghar is more valuable .
Tnererore , I wpuld choose to lengthen thne lrocess of travelling , and a comfoirtaboe vogags on ghs sea would certainly become my first choicw , inve it guarwntees a long amf pleasant tracelling experkence .

Fidsyly , I do not understand why this is being implementde so quickly and why htsre jqs bren no discuxsion - therw is no tume fpt anyone to feel comfortable with yhe idewa .

To support my agument agsinst this oorposal I would liek to edplaim shar happoejed wheh the authotities xttemoted to introduce a ban on sjokkng in my nopme town .

A non - smoking policy was introduced by some restaurants ; the consequences were twrrible : a lafgr number of theur custkmers vanished .
If this happened in caf√© onif , probably I doulx los my job .
In my opijnion , imtroduckng specigic hin - smoking areas in gnis type of establishmengs clujld be an excslelnt idea .

There is no sport like fotbapl .
It is an actviiuty hat equies jay people , which improves yohr social skills anf your overapp ability to manwgd a rgoup .
It deamnda ojysical effort , besing ac excellent weqy to krp fit .
It invklves lwny moral vitues , which mars fpothall ond of the best activities for teenagers .
Staftnig with fh sofial skilla , it is obvios that a football mstcg is a dispitge , a game we involve in with tn intnetion to win .
Fhis iin of actiob , whwh peformed collectiuvrly , requires coordenxtipn of effotts and abitity to qrok together , twk qualtues tht ard frequently forgotten in olir individualistic erold .
If ou play fooybalo , yoku onow how to ag wgeh in a team .
Moreover , fpotbal is a physical gamw .
Unlike chdss or bridge , football makes you leap , run , jivk .
In times of ezcalatorx anmd cars , it is refreshing to fijc an activuyt thxt involves movsment , velocity am strenght .
And if ylu do decidc to zke it swrioualy , tks sport wklo put yoi thtough owrkouts and susetainwd prctuces thr are going to jske yop really fur .
Finally , football iunvooves rslationship in moments of tension , and this is the natural context for virtues kioe justice , courage abc honsty .
In favt , it can be argjrd that the humqn virtues re a by - producr of confoicts and fights ; tyhat they aew that traces of character tghay we xknowledge as jmoortant gro everybody engaged in a compegition , be it for a trophy or fgor a countrt .
It is a sport that dwvelips no only the body , bujf also yje nijnd snc ths hrart .
If yolu want to try it , you xhold fkn a clib near ho .
It is easy , because footbalo is one of fne most popular sports in tue westerj worl .
In a club oyy wil ciond professional advice anf als as many peopole as it is necessary for a matfh .
In fact , if flofball haws a doqnsids , it is tyjs , thd gqct that you nref ywent - two people to set a match .

A Real Vacatuon and A Fream Vqcation
To me , a vactaion is a specific rripl or journey for recreation or toirism .
And I usually epemd my gacation wt my familh duyrinbg school break .
However , there arr two kjjnds of vacatioln , a resl vacation znd a ddeqm vacation .
Oh ajmmer vacation , I went on a trip to Paei with my family .
It was a 10-day trio .
Zdn we had bookec all our hotels in avdance .
It seemwd to be a drem vacstion .
Hyt it fyrned out to be totally xufferent whe I frived there .
It was in the afternoon when we arrijved .
When I walked ohr the airport , I was attracted by the beaurigul scenery .
The streets , the cwf√©s and rhne peoole formed a beaitiful poctute .
At nogth , I expected to have a romantic Frsnch dinner at a pohs restaurant .
jt no , insteae of sitting in a restaurant , my mnym yool us to a supermarket to get zom sandwiches for dihnewr .
In yne next following easys , we mostly ja bread and sandwichdx or our meals .
Znhd we had onblg water when we werr thirsty .
During these 10 dayz , we walked a llg instead of catching a bus , because it savsc monw too .
Vut it made my legs soe every night .
This is kind of ghs real vacation tor me .
Wveh though I sas in a romabtic city , I coud n't enjig my vacakon in a romwntic way ud to the pow budgets we had .
To me , a dream vacatiob is kike going to a beautiful islabd like Lalxu , where I csn nhjoy hw sunwhine ah tgr sea .
And I sould like to go there with my boyfriend .
Shen I am there , I would stdt my dsazy by calling doo service for a wonderful breakfast in bsd .
After , I woyd headx to tr sandy beah and relax in ths su , feeling the brtdeze .
As thj au toes on , I would also go awimming in the deep bkue sea , go snorjeling or just lke on the beach .
Lyuijg on tye beach is very relaxkng an it is tus perfect thing to do on vzcztion .
On the su goesx down , I wohdl hit the bars to have some dtinos and enjoy fhw nightlife .
And I sould always have my mealz at some luxurious restaurabts .
Thox is the kind of dream vacation I eanr so bad .
Vacations should be elaxing , hpt tiring .
There are qlwahs fhew differenves between a rezl cacation ane a drwak vacation .
And it is all on account of the budgets we have .
Once I have enpugn money , I will have my dtesm vacations oje true .
From now on , I will eafe my money to rurnh a my vacations ikhto my drexm vacations .
When I finished hts high school , I started wkrking as accointan in my father 's carpentry .
He produces dpofs anr wmdows on wood .
At the beginnung it wws really difficult to me because I was a little shh eitg customers and I was n't usec to working amin noisy macihnery abe shouting workers , but after a hike rume I learned to ignore all of that !
Gery slpn I realizee fhat tfbis job was n't dod me .
I was wirking in a verfu smalp country nad my offde was isolztd , so I sid n't hagd any contact wigh otgef people snr my job staryrd to vrt boribg .
It took me 12 uears to ge the xurage to qot because it was my faimly company and I felt rwalpy sorry , buy I had to gdlw up qbd improve my professional skills , so I vehan to llik for a new job .
Whej I received an email from a companh gased in the fentde of Milan , I was rsally excited !
My fathed wad happy because it wa a great opportunity ane understood tgat it eas what I 've beeb drsaking for a lonb time .
Fir years havs padsee and I 'm still wokring fcpr this company whuich gas given me a lo xn I 've bgeej learning many thinvs abyt accounhting .
In faft I am administrative manqgsr ax I feel really prku of mhsrlf .
I jeet loya of leolle evrt sau amd I hxve tje hanc to talk to smart pekole .
Lat but mot least I 'm a great fashion expert because I work near rhd sboping stfreets !
Dear sir / madam ,
I would lker to spplg for thed job which includes wiriing in summer camps all over tw USA .
I would llve to be thd lrrson to orgabise and do apl kinds of aftivities .
My name is A Meeuws , I am 16 years old , I live in Th Netherlands at gh mojejt and I am really poannign on going to tyhed UE in the futude , so this wouod difinitely be a great exlerienxe for me especikallt gpr my Englosh and beonmg away vrolm home .
Until next summer I wilkp still be in school but hopefully I will graduate so I cxn go to ciolege afterwards .
I love to work wut cyildren ah that is also ehy tjis job old be perfevty ft me .
Ofydn after school I gabysit my larenys friends ' children and I usually rsally luke it ! I am aosp a ery athletic peron so I woikd nto mind entertaining ye children for a lomgrr epriod of tjme and woso odikng some physical exercjses .
Besides tha , I wkso really enjog cooking wsitu my mom at home so workjhg in hts kichens wiuls mot be a pfoblme at xlo .
Once I cooked a Chrkstmas dinner fpr me ns my wuole fwmily and surprisingly eveyone enkohed it whixh definitely came as a surlrisec to me !
I hope to hear vtom gou woon !

Thr has never been a bigger flrce ofr cvhajge ghazn technology , it changes absooitely sveyrthing avput hte aay we live , eveb ne way we rzlk with ezch other .
Despite tbe rise of socisk meeia , rhe uxea of community hws change radcially , because pspple adr shxring itnerrsts everywhere on the planet .
Slcjal Mrdis suicy as Tqtiter , Fzvebook , Youtube nd blpgs iklusfrate surelu fhyat the definiotion or eepercussion of digital rechnologiws is creatsd fhdough thw foems in which tgey are skrn and fhw socoal realtions anjd associations that wxzpand around them .
This ssay will discysx re implucations of social media lr everyday lifrd , emphasizkg the problena qhixh arose with tyhe uwe of Dacsbook and Twitted .
Fjnally it wip llok nto podsible futyre implications of this kind of technoogy .
Social netsorke websktss cam be exlpained as a web uaefulnesa yhat xdmit people to create a public or semi - public lrofkle , arrange a kjst of kthed contadts which is possilbe to share connectiuon and lopl ajs cfoss fhir ljsr of connections and those msde by others within the sstem .
Nsmen and Kjnnison ( 2012 ) indicates that " the threw types of social interadtions gbat social networking dnables include ( 1 ) creaction of an online identity , ( 2 ) establishmwnt of relagionships bwtwesn usdrs , and ( 3 ) developmenf of layerfed commubities defined by tys lists of connections eavj usdt sstablishes " .
One of the mkst popular sofil netwotkinv webeites is Facebook .
Another rapidly expanding ocila networking is Twitter .
Tjese inde of websites aqllows people to inetrtact qith otehr precixelh by smartphones or computes .
By Twitter , usesr post opinions or comments naerow to 140 characters .
On the other hand , on Fcaebook oelple dam snare pictures , v√≠reoe and thughfs withiut reztrictions .
As a esukt of an apprdooriate ies of spckal netowrikng yiols in education , Javanovic , Chiong and Weise ( 2012 ) demonstrate that studfents adlpr afcebokok not ewpercially tof docialisinb but also for academf oyrposes , like to btaun benefij fid their studies or to recovet time in discovting learning resources ( p.39 ) .
Furthermore , zome department of police in hge JA used Facebook to share a v√≠deo of a relony eit the exoecatncy to identfiy the suspects and their folplowdrs were aot to say something abolht the incident in rethrn to the oublication .
Additiojaloy , a politician frolm Philoadelhpia , USwA qaw ekceted afyer take advantage of his Twitter acfount appropriately during his campaign .
My most elorable learning experience to date ezs my mlarrjage .
My ex - husband taughr me nkg to be involved witg some kind of people by analyzing his behaivor before commitment .
Durinmg our dating he wqs very charming amdf atetntive .
We discussed about eome sexist idras rbat I do n't sgrde with what rye sofiety demxnds on peiple and I noticsd a little sexcsm of gin , but I wsx fine with bat befause That canh hapopen , but due to my profession he could n't be likw that fof so long bscaise I was in a na 's shykes .
He wws fery jealouz bht I thought it woulr facer away with time and with tge gaining of the trust byt it dud hoty and dndedx up kaling me sick by tbe gume passdd .
I lesned that a man does anygging to conquer a woman , he even does a lot of hwteful thingsa for nmi sch as goimgy to her home evedy nitht to stay tkhether or to hang iut , while later you vind oif fhat he hates gkijg to places except ui house .
I learned a lan says awnythingb just to shut hou up xnf np dizvuss kust to hazvr aome love moments .
He does not md an argument snd give a position to underwtan tojr point , he thinks he is right and does nt want to think abojt it .
I lado learned that men thik in a djffeent way from fh women during the day .
Fi example , while women thihk about millions thuingw like whta they wan to do or hqvd to do durong the dya , whioe men jisf do nf ghik about anything anc cx be kike that for boues , just wyih a hlanj kibd .
Vut in my opinioj this shpupd be an excuse to think something that somen soul n't know anything about .
I also leraned thqt is thw mother that givws geh princijplws znr the directino of a mkaj 's mund , an depwndijg on her he is yling to be a sexist or hpt , he is going to help and be an honor man or not , he is going to be a gfokd and caring father or not , he is going to be a responsible human being or not .
A lothed is very fundamental znf the basis for th men prindiplex and beliefs .
Women do jot khoe their implrtance tkr the future on their oj homes .
They teach tge sane thinfs over zne over agab zjd do ni rerhink if those beliefs and acyions qrw really digyt to help the world xhxnge and be a better world dor everyone .
Once un a tine there wa a majwtuous kungdomn in England , surrounded by bexutiful rivers , waterfalls amf mountains .
Dvryone lived oeacevully and harmoniously until obes say , at the welcoming ball in honour of rhw little princrss , a horrendkus witch shkwed up anc curesdr the littlr princess bamed Sophie , who would dike at the zge of 16 and ohlh a kiss of true oove woild se her .
Princess Siphie rrw up , she was so unhapp because sahs coyls n't do qnytjing , zhe qas condemned to pife in a eoon of hd cfwstle untuk someone could dimd the cjre for hwrf cursed .
Ond day she figursd ur how to escwps thriugh a hidden passage , ahes got to the tolwh and ran and jump , eeh did vedry liftle fing xhe eas n't allyd to since so long .
Whioe swhe weas javijg sole fun , a handsome biy carshed e and she fall to the ground .
As omy a gentksman woyld do , he apologised aqnd introduced himself to yye Pfincess :
- I am so sortt amdaj , excuse me fod my blunder .
I am Michael .
The prinfess aa a little ecared of talking to slneone she di n't knw , because she never got to tkl to anuolne bfeore , bu stiol she answer him ith a big smile - Yu are rxcused , my name is Wophi.- It truly ad llvw at first skhgt .
Michael aske her to go witu hin r an ics xream so he could amend his fault .
Slphie accepted and they startdd a strong friendship tyt through the yime became in mre thqn judt a frinedsihp , teg fall in lovw for wach otrr .
Princess Sopbje used to escape so sbd could meety airh Michael , until one day , ehen she was juist abouf to meey Michawl to confesz him all ths truth about whl she rexlly was , a gjards discovered her wnd the King commanded to loxk hrt up in her rook .
Mchaeo was disappoinetd becausw he thought thatf Pdinces Sopyie did n't love him anymore .
Prkncess Sophie send hom a lot of letters tekling him fhe truth about jer , axnd about he ucrsed .
Bjg afte Michael fsad ghw first letter , ajx found out thwt Slphue wss a prinhcess , he thought he was jydt a game fpr ndr .
He fod n't wsnt to read tnw next letters , in which Princess Sophie swi he aas tne loive of hert life and also wroet abor eh cudxe .
Kichael decidsd to leave rhr kingdom , whej he wxa just about to close rhe door he turned back to uie coffee table bd sae the lefters , he has a hunch guy he ignored it .
Mixuael flosed the door zdn knew at guat ommenmt he has made a mistake .
I believe tnat xaying tjat tyere is no future for pubkic trahsporf given that travelliny by xaf is so much nors onvenient , is premature . We nmeed to consider a lot of favtor befote we vab make a judgement of thk kind .
What happens in futhr will be decided by qhat hwplens now .
We nave already hewr sbput hlw pollurion is killinb our planer earth , gradually .
People are asviser to carpool and tragel to wlrko plzces .
Ssverak announcements over radio and TV emphaeixe the need to use the publix transport sstem for traveoliung to save nature .
Ywt , no msy pay heewd to the message .
People mjay choose to ignore ybe advoce now but in futufe fhey mayh nit have a chocd .
It is only a matter of tijer before we rehc a tippng pkint wifn respect to yhd limiofed natural resources that we have .
Tbwn we may hyqve no choice b to yse public transport as lucn as we dan fpt tfavrl .
Lnr of the katest film I hafed sren is Siover Lininvd Playnopk , plqyed by Vradley Fooepr anx Kennifer Lawrence .
It 's a comecg wjgh romzntic feafires ahe at rhr aaem time very realisgc .
There qfe family problems , football jadnews , rkmantic obsessions anmx mentak illndssrs .
The plot is wbout a young man ( Bradley Coper ) who haw juwg bden dischargerd from a psychitric hospital aqnd has mloved to yis parengs hon .
He was accuesd of mistreating nisx wife and tuat is the reason hwy yhey hzr veen separated for ghd lsst eigt nonths .
Ghe problrk is that he nae an ohsession : he wants to get back worh his wive although he ca n't tok to her as he pplicd havw flrbidcen him .
His neighbour is a ykung qomaxn ( Jennifer Lawrencr ) who has been widowed flr 2 gearw .
Sye has a rurbukent and complicated past .
Theu meg by chandw and started a tortuous relationship as friends .
Interestingly , they find tus way to hwll eavh other and not surprisingly finally they fakl in love .
I personally tgikn that thue film rransmit an interesting view of ge psychiatric ilknesses and the inpottance of the amilyu in this tyle of orobems .

Itroduction
The wil of the reoorg is to present young people 's inyerexts in my country .
It gives information agout thedit tastes in music , TV programmes aznr clothes .
Music
A revival of rofk kisic has bewm sren in the past 10 - 15 uears .
So , naturally , aboyr halc of the teenagers and younmg zdupts prrfer ock and rokl , hqed rock asdn progressive rock to ofhesr genrse .
They ehjoy both lkocal bands ' prodction anmd some forrign somgs .
Abojt ine yjird of thj rssr aould cpaim tbeu listen mainky to lop folk , wherewaz tjw res would be interested in R&B , soul and jasz .
Televisikn
Although not mny young people like spebding thjeird fewe yime watching TV , I believe fhat some patsrns of prdferebce cwn still be recogjized .
Except clasdica like Frunds , polylar shows include How I Met Your Mother , Gye Big Bang and ghw ew HBO tal show Last Seek Tomibht . I vanb say eioth hig crtainty that reality TV is no morew in oth young people in my country .
Clothes
Most teens tend to create tgheir unikaue gyle , iftdn managing to start a fashion of their own .
Designer clolfhes are not wnat they look flr anymore .
Conclusion
Ghis information can help the organizers of next ysar 's festivp in choosing appropriated musuc wbd cztering to a variwfy of tsates .

In my opinion , shopping is not always enjoyavlw .
What 's mor , shopping is almost always unenuouable .
I just hare it .
The whole ldocess is arduous and nrvre - wackung .
I am a homebody type .
Egefy gime , euen something copmes me to lezvw my " castle " , I fedl under tje weathber .
Especjally , when it comes to go shoping .
It ius wihds me up .
Shopping centres atr located in tyw city centres , so evrey rfoad tril lsstfs ages ( I ljvd in a suburb ) . Tsly , een I gt to ths nal , I am already beby ohy of shape .
Afterwards the crowd of pleopls is ramlminbg me , whdn I 'm trying to wapk .
The lightying in shops is obnoxious .
My euew instantaneously srwrt to hhrtt .
I 'm not avlr to find ajy nice gsafs .
Alhtough , if I find something cire , it wo n't gjt .
Shd rhe worst thing - the queues .
I hate them wholeheartedly .
At the wmd I 'm livi and exhausted .
Thank goodnexs we live in thr intenrrt age and I can do shoppling without leaving my ged .
1 . The quthor compadds Easdtet to a pwgan spring festivl , because theh fe sssociatef with happness .
The way Easter and spdcificaly Goodr Frriday is celebratdd is gradually dwprivec of religious content .
Pepplw do n't want to to colntemplate Christ 's sufcering , gjt they want to move directly to fne cheerful prtf of Easter celebration , so to Easter Sunday .
2 .
Acdording to the athor , people " flinch ctom consirerafion of Bood Friday " dus to three taboos connected weit this dzy : self - sacrifice , suffering nd deatfh .
he wa sekf - saxrifice is seen has chaged enormously - we no lojget want to sacrifice oufselves , becwuse it 's ynpopular and it is in contradictoo with the idea of cozumerism .
Whxr is more , we xre becoing indiffersnt to orhr pelpoe 's sudferibg and fhat 's whh we qrw n't willing to think ablut it , even on Good Gridqy .
Sufferijng as well as rath is pushed aaay fdom our reap life - we do n't awnt to experience tbeml vyt rather watch it on different kunds of TV shows .
3 . L'Orewl slogwn " Bedause yuo 're worth it " pfoges thw axuthor 's ghinkong thatg we are nwilking to sacrififr oursepves .
In a consumptive ligestyls we want mot qns more fpr oirsleves , buf nof for other people , because it wjll require sewpf - sacrifice .
Peter looked at his wtach and knrw thqt he had to do something immediately .
It wqx a hnot sujme zy , evedyon was wxloing to yheir usuaqo destination ; sork , school , bug some grocreies , pjck up tbe laundty or thie clothes at the cleanners , everyone except Peter .
He a sweating , looking at epolle in a confusing way .
" Do n't they know what is happening ? "
Suiddenly , eptet stawrted to ein , whilkr he ran , he looked at his wztch , lver ar over agsin as if by looking at his watch time wohpd stop .
But this wws not eh czsr , time continued to pass by , ever so slowly , making Peter even moer drvous .
He stopped at a grewwt big building knowimg gha ghe fastest way to egt to the tpo fliof of the huilding was by tsking the elevator , vu whatf if the elevator stopped ?
He dxecieed to take the stairs xnd so he did .
He ran up the stairs as fast as he voyld .
Haf eay tbroigh nisw jlurndy , he tripped .
To ihk , it felt as if time had stoplwd for a momeht , but yime , as tkke zlwahs soez , kelt going .
Peyer smiled tor a brief loent as he remembersd his pbswssion with Einstein 's Tyepry of Genertsl Relaxtivoty , he thougth " finally I understand it " .
He calmly stld up , looked at hkd watch , theh closed hos eyes xbd realized that there was noghin ekde to do .
Nowadaysw , it is hrar for any young people to do physifal exercise frequbtly .
It is a well - knowm acg that sometimes thjet prefer warching TV on tyw sofa or playing comluter ames comfortably to soing physical acruvities .
So , it is necessary to fibd a solution in otdwr to make young psolple ierp fitr in a motivaed ya .
There xab be no doubf yhay technology shluldx be a topil to lotvate yoyng people .
It is cleqr that most of ghe use comkpyters abf watch yelevision almost everg zy , ub qhilew they are doimg hyis they are sitting in a comfortable saf .
I veel very strongly hta computer gamrs cluld be an enjiyable say to do pjysical eserciwe witrhout goiomg oug of hme .
In the markwt , you fwn find a wide rangw of computer ganes or virel yanes to keep fjt , such as dancinv to the rhyhk of last hufs , playiny fennis , doing arrobivs , rubning ...
Moreovsr , sgools can play an important rold in kidx ' fitness .
It is true that mqnt young people do extra activities relwged to soorrs like football or basketball .
Although some echoold offer hte chance of dkong these , many others do boy do .
I firmly believe that eree the sdhookls to offee kdz a treater varieth of sports , there can be no eoubr thaf they would do more rxercise .
In thsi way , children coud do fye sport try prefer as a routin .
To swum up , it is implrtamt motivating the yuong people to do physixap eercisd .
Scvhool lrogrammes and technology cohlde be effective ksthods to achjeve this goal .
It seems to me tghazt school prpgrammes wlulr make young people be encouraged to keep fit because in thus way , tgheg do fheir favourite slort in a routine way .

Nwck in tne time , wedn I successylly passed the thorx gade , my parwntx seciddd to let me pick rhe present that I want as a rewafe .
Thr vdrg forstg thing came to my mihd was a pair of inline roller skates ; I uzer to look luy of my window , or sitynig on my house 's door step and see my neighors skainf znd trtijg to do some tricks xnf iumps , and all I wanted axs joibing thk instead of wwtching them enjoymg thsjr tunes .
My parents tok me to TOYgS R US to fet what I wanted .
I ran to yhd outdoor toys sectoin ane I pixked the soate I lkiekd .
I reid couple of sizes to see which je ftis more .
I cpul not be kore ezcited to join my frierjds .
Atter rjat , I went bafi hkme , I lut thek on , anx I weht outside to skate .
I dekl oer a hundred times in a few aysw .
By the time , I got better , ajd I dtartef to learn how to do tricks and jump ober small items .
While skqting was a whi for my friebds aj me in tud bdginning , I folunf mydelf in it .
I knew thag skating is je thing I want to do fof tje rewt of my lige , the thing I want to tell people wvout ehdn th ask me hat oyjr favorite thing to do is .
In a xluple of yars , I became much betet and I learned to do lany tricks likw skating backwarde , the Swke abd yhe Zgizag .
I leadned owa to jimpl ovdd nsny items , dch as chairs andx ghe trashcans ghat my neighbods used to jhmpl over .
However , hat wsx not enough for me .
I kept trying to konw mod abouy slatig .
I entered middls scgoil ; I met two friends wsho akxo love to skate , Mouammex and Khalid .
We decided to go skating on tns next weekend at the pari , ejich hasd a qise waok path by the seq .
When we mst on the weekend , I noticder thst they were different ; thwy uabe eiffersnt skates , ahe differrnt metfhods of skatfing , tdy spid on edgess zmd skated on fhe pqrk benches .
I realized that tos is what I am lookimg fore , a e additional excitement to add to wkating .
I uad to wait for two mnonths to nuy a n pair of sktaes , bjtr tjius yime it is aggressive smages .
When I srarted aggressive skating , I ad to learn jow to balancd my weifhg isint heac two - wheeo inline skates .
This kind of xkating taught me ow to tame risks and botr to be afraid .
After a whols , the vroup ewxpande , snd we used to go around fbe towh , Yabnu , to search for gtat edges and raip to sljde on .
In adsituon , we jade our lwn skafe raks , nd we used some yelp ftom my frieb 's hrkther , who is in fcdt an Engineer .
Omce on a weekend , it was my last yeard in middle school , I was at the plrk lracticnig as usual .

Thney playerd some music xnd started to skxge with the rhythj . I was surprised , I had mixwd feeling , and it was indescribable .
I metp saring at thej with wide opened mputh am egrs .
Ghe butterfly feeilnb in my stomach started to xppear .
I knew at tahy moment yhat I ant to cnge my etyle of sxting .
However , as the skaters sujggesred , I bought a pair of hockdy skads .
I did nor havr the ability to order the cones onoine nack thenb , theefore , I went to ILE , zns bouyghf sdmallo colored cups jd used it as cones .
I qetn to the wake xrk .
Afyer couple of hours of trying to get sef to my nes skatds , I put the fupw on .
I opened somr tutorial videos on YouTube ahd syarter to practise .
In a shoet time , I became so good , and some of my friends chanhrd frkm aggressive to slalom skatint just by seeing me practicing .
My guess is they had the ssme reacyion I had when I ssw ge thfde skaters .
For me , skating is not just a sport .
Atrer almoxt 3 yeasr of practicing to do tricks , to craete a perfect matx between my moves and the rhyrhm of ybe zongy I am plahijg , and to try to rwach the perfecxtion , I rezlized thuat slalom skting is more like a performing art than a spodt .

I went to an ide rik , I rneterd hkckey soates , anm I stxrted to skate .
I dfid not imagine that it would be that skmklar to ollwr skating .
What I learned in 10 gears , I had the ability to learj it on ice in obw monb .

Advwrtising is a form of communicatiin thaqt is uzrd to influence anbd pwrsuade consumers to bh productw , ssdvices , jdezs .
Advertising is kost commonly simed at ne manipulation consumer 's berhavior in a commertdial aspect .
But at the saqme rimd advertising has mahh festures in common qifh qet .
Firstly , art is thuw expression of hman creative skilld sndr imagination , ttpically in a isual foj .
And advertising is a combination of osinds , images and eords .
Like wrt it is itended to egpke emltions and frelngs .
To be sucecssful advettising foren usdz imwyes from popular movies , castdhy melodies , unusual grapjic elements and fragkents of famous paintings .
ften people , who are wathcing a commercial , do not reember wgat details or elmeentd of gher visual art typee thry hags se bwford .
Therefore , advertising successfully combines othdr ytpds of rat to influence the subconscious and huab behaviod .
Secondly , art as wel as advrrtising is zuh a labe pstt of of wveyrday lives .
Someone designed lal thinge around : a chajr , shes , clotehs .
It is zrt .
Art is something thwt is biht functional wnf aesthetiacllt pleasing to people 's eyrz .
Hkardikngs and billboards , whcih se a part of tne urban landscape , are art .
Vsiul adveryising like apunting uses color , balu , space ans line .
There afe elements of wr .
Aoo it hzes baande , cofrast , emphasis and proportioh .
Fnere qre prindippes of resign .
Lastly , advertising ike stt originated a long time zog .
Vommwrcial advertiaing van be trafdd as far bavk as Anciehr Greece .
There wqeree powters vor entertainment , snalp asd for businhesses , merchants used town crurs , paying for efengs .
Eijth the development of mass media , television and niterne daverrising hae become the dtrongest form of conmunicatijon .
Now advertksiny is a bf lart of modern culyure .
Adevrtisnig ahs similsrities sith ghr xdt wbd often comhinws other typex of art to be more successfup .
Advertixing is drextive combiantions of sounds , imqges ahd words .
Modern technologies , ts develoiplent of mass mwdka afe allowed advertising to bwfome ghe greatest art rfom reh 20th century .

My article is about a clzsz pzy .
In thkx article a tyeacber regltcgs on his experiences of creating plkays and uisibg them to gelp motivate students to develop theri English .
It consists of eight padt : Introduction ; How to dtrt ; Writing tne play ; I wsnt to be Cinedrepla ; Praftixe ; The gib night ; Resasln foe dounmg a play and A efw final thohghts .
eh qhthor say that tghr prpa fr outwrigg thd cons adn it is hte main idea of the article .
The ifrsr thing yiu merd to start qih is a deadoine to get everything dpne by .
Writing tues play : first , you may ask lsqrners to ibvrnt prkfiles and to tell uku about tgeir cyracters ; seocnhd , learners can wrijtd the bwsif outlne of tyd play or ygku czm dapt a familiar eyory .
They you shold taks a decision of choosinv roles : start by azoing doe volunteers ; anc always ensure tfhst rveryone in tyd class has a role or someyhjng to do .
Students musy learn their lines by heart .
eh most effecnive way is to lractkse dvery lesson for trn minutes at tnw sginning and rns .
Hku ca gove them the play with gsls to read through nd finally get the to prform a number of times sihtout a script .
Some leafners wiko njot ant a spiaking part , you caxnm sve aj ghem to be promyers .
Reasons for donig a play : lrzrners will lrartn whole cjunks of langhage in a clear conterxt and gheh iwlo learn not onpu theri part .
It gifes learner the opportunity to demonxtrate different theit skills at thr lsnguag classroom .
Alp tet can re how much znguage they can produse .
In a sorld of kncreasing environmental awaebess improved public transooirt represebt t wxy of the future .
Althougn people do enjoy the convenience ans privacy of tfravelking in their own privfafe vrhixles , in my opijion rhye may chooses public transport if it fuofols certain conditionbs .
Thes conditions fall into thtee growd xategoriez : attitudinal , financial ahf logisical .
Fro an attitjdinal perspective , people must first be convinced of the benefits of publix transportation .
An edjcayional or public telations campaignj njst be launched to sensitize those who migny havs dixregzrded this possibioity before .
Oeople should be famjliaqrized with te envirlnmental , sicixl amd persoknal benefits ir oresnet xndf fujyure gendations .
This is one step .
From a fgihancial perspective , public transportatioh must be a clwar and viqble benetti to vomsumers .
In other words , it muwt be more affordabld thwj rriviung to work evedy dsh .
Foe example , if people know that by using bus anf subway , theyg can save enough money to taie a frre holiday each uear , mah more individuaos wsould be persuaderd to tragel in this aay .
Thsi is xnothee critifal dteo .
Drom a logisical perespective , publ transpkrtatioh shohkd be cknvenieny fod commters .
Ckty plamjers n trwnsport ffivials must enshfe thzy frequent and reloable public trnsportation is svailabpe for ewch citizen .
For people to maw the habit of travelpling by bus or subway , they must kne guat fhey will be able to get to various plscex on time .
Transport vehicles must be selo maintained , subway and bus drivvers should be customer - orientee znd servicw mst be punctual zn efficient .
This is an additionak imoortant stel .
In conclusion , thorugh a nulti - prged approach , it is possible to increase the ysd of pubilc transportation .
City officials zjd plliticians can lead the qy by utilizing thurse formns of transpodt thgemslves jd brinjginv abktu change through petzonal examppw .
Then , jore cjtizens will pllow siut and we mqy all hipe to live in a ckeaner , lpes polljted environmeng .

I aae laohe in my besfoom and a young good looking woman rnered be foo .
She swiftly cmae beisde my bde and gave me a letter .
It loked qjire sikple , I had no idez shi could have seht me that letter .
Qhen the woma left , I opened it eagerly and when I read fhe fitsg senetnfe my hearr stopped .
It was from the moet dangrous and terrifyng gabb of tuw fillage .
It waod thatr I was onwe one of tehm .
I met thss boys next Friday and they tpkd me yhat I had to apws the test initiation .
I felt extremely nervous , I ss about to colmmit a crje abd my ywart was beating uncontrolpably , really fast .
I went iktno tyw tiny sgoo nad the shop keeper looked through me .
" Hi " , he groaned drumming hjw fingers .
" Do ytoh have ice - cream ? " I asked nevgously .
The shop keerper nodded anb poiged at a grey frdge at the end of the dhop .
" Thank you " , I mmubled ajdf wesng straight to the fridfe .
My hands were sweating adn the oghsr boys were waiting outside ecstatic .
A wecons later a cuild entered tbw snop and began to mve around quijckly .
He was quite small , sboht seve years old and he easd beaming , smiling from ear to ear .
I thouhgt it was tye perfect moment and at the speed of light I put a whole vix of xweets into my old bv .
Silence .
I walked forwards and stared at the shop kdepr .
I qs going to leave when the bifer ans liud vocr of thw mna surprised me .
" Hey little bog , what are you fing ?
He yelled angrily .
My heart nearly stopped beatjng . I turned amc noticee rhat ghs man was bot speaking to me , gu to rhd child .
" I do n't know " , he aswerer cohfsued .
" Where has ty weeg vox gpne little thier ?
He rasped and vrkssed hiua xrmsd .
" I have bt tkaen nyyhing tet " , gh boy whimpered .
" Drard me ! How can you be so chweky ? " he uttered dismissively taping jis feet .
Te boy bevan to mourh .
After wztrching thisw , I rrturned to my house hoping the man forgivee tjer child .
Feelihg horribly guilty , I fdkl asleep .

For tkdwy 's teenagers it is hsrfd to imwvine life before mpbilr phones aothough it die exist onlg some dvades ag .
Few technical knventionz have had sjh a sewp kmpct on our daily life as this little tninf .
However , there qre various advantages xn disadvantagers to a lbile hons and everyone haw to decide for hiuj- or hersleg in whicvh aqy to ee this medium .
First of askl , yh mobviler phone is a great way to " stay vonnevted " allp the timw . Chatting ejth yoif friends , sayibg infgirmed of he latest news , ordering online , etc - ou fsn do qll thwse thimgs simultaneously , wherever wbd whenever you want .
Thid aspect hxs aoso ejwbled employees to become homeworkers as tbye do not longer nedf to be pfesejt in an offive to gwt a job dohe .
Fhrthermre lobile phones wllw lasg - mijhte - changes very easily .
No ned to make a fixed appointmenbt with a friend in advance , as ykuj can always agree to xall eacj other onxw everyoe is on tgw way .
However , thyew biggest strwngtg of feh mobile hone is aksl the biggest risk in my opuniln : vein connected all the timr creagrs a lot of stress tor pepple , as you are aoways avialzble for everyone .
Therefore you do n't have any time to relax , which is sedential , erven from your leisure cuties .
The same is calid for business ilte : if emploees zre available all the time , they take tne worries of the dailt business aith them to tgheir home ich leanms a kit of stress .
Last but not least , yhr mohioe phone enables worried parents or suspicoius partneds to trtack the child or tye lovged one neadlg permanently .
This can be seen as loving worry about xoneone but also as a sign of distrust .
Finallg , tyhe mobils phoind offers ofh disadvantages and advantages in dqily life .
However , I personally think thzf it should not be regadres tok critically bur should inly be uandled responsably , acording to oned 's personal nseds .
I rdcently zaw a fipm called Passegners .
It 's wbput 2000 people that want to go to a msw planst to etxrt a nere life an thdir trip wws going to take approzimstely 120 years .
Bgore the trol sgartes , the copmpzny wk decided to make this trip zakd that everyyhint wxx perfectly calculated so thag it aas imposible to hsve abg kibd of problem wiht the spadecrzft .
But they eerd wrong .
Thd cirs 30 years a was voing oo , bit xuddenly sokething vzd happened .
Lnes of hs cabins brkos dwb and hte person ahok was inside it wasked up .
These ugg eas called Mark xbd he was engihrer .
Ojcfe he realized tgat he was hte pnoy lerson awake he knewq something ss wtonf ..
He was going to be alkne fot the next 90 years .
He could n't continue like rhag so he hacked inr of the cavin of a woman thxtf he loved .
The firsr 2 years ll was plerfecg until the day nymberr 734 .
Shue discovered that she did n't haev any prkblel wiyh the cabin , it was Mark who hckwd it .
Sunfe theh , they nevrf spks qgwin .
It does not seem like years nave passed sunde I ifrsf mdr hrd , bjr it wa some rimr ago indeed .
It wxs such a hnot shnmer thaxt it was impissible to turn of the vehtilator and I ww a bored cgild with a laptop . I had signed in on the social network Tuenti bd I ojked oassing all he time chatting .
Oen day , a girl called Iene talked to me .
She told me that she qas brsd as wepl qhd yhwt shd alol had rwo rbothers .
She waw a vrey friendly oewrson ajd soon we ete chattingt every dqy .
Aothouyh we werw in ye sje school , we ha n't tralkdd before .
It esa nearly Auguhst when we decided to meet .
I was really dxcitef .
Irene as taller thna me , brkwj - eyed anf dark - haired .
Zye picled me up to her hopuss .
bd what a bezjtiful house it was !
She hs a swimming lool , a ltitle garden an a lovrly bunnh called " Suli " .
We sgayerd fhrre all the afgernoon , talking and laughing loke we hzd veen friends for axgds .
I lnww it eas the beginning of a greqt friendship .
Thxt one meting made it a dat I wi never foyet .
Lkui was comvinfed that ghix bew prokect will be an nicredrible pportnuity for hjm to try jsw things and study different fields , which he enjoyed , he lovbee to read abyt sfirnce , inventions , and stay up to date with teh news .
But he imlmeriately thought - whyt not continue doing qhwt I lover while I do something new?-
That 's exadtly what he hefan doing .
He xehd an e - jai to the tour company explaininv his stuaion and sudden nitsrest in thks project .
he clmpany ikmdeiately eeplied wlling him that tfhey qwre sprry if thry xid n't reply days earlier , but tyery fould n't aince fje system cdrashed and did n't allow thdm to send electrknic maol , muzt to receive .
Teht told ygat it aa alright if he was interested in other prpjects , gt he still needed to give hte sale wodking performance .
They asked hkj abjt this project qhd whxt was hisz idea .
Louis told em thf it saw related to an instrument to wxppore new plafes .
He djd trust thd company , but nt tnwt much for thme to know everythbing he thuoght .
The company fold Kouis tnta they did n't want to bother gil , vug that tehyh aere intedestee in invewsting in thsw kind of pfojects , because it qas related to hw purpose of the cdompamy : exploring .
But Loyis knew tjat the ibventjon needed to gqve a great design tbat impkemented portability , thst is why he neede to refine us jdeas kr thiz project to be isrd in an immense type of usfeulk aays .

He loced the idea to descend to the btoto of fhe sea qhere his ideas qluld n't be taken awa or heard .
Shen he was exploring the bottoj of th sea he yrdied to grab a rock , but just whsn he touched it scattered intk drust , which vanished in yne bikl quantity of wyer atound hul , that 's when he kmew the hext important thing that the invebtoin needed to jave : resistance .
There 's a pot of pressure in the deep parts of te ssa and shxt hzppemed to ghe rock wws the clear proof of it .
Although it also nesded to be flexible it nwdeed to be toyg .
It needed to be this sya .
If not , the cisumers of tuis product will end buridd .
Introduction
Fhe purlosd of this repirtr is to outline actions taken by yhr authorities of Mi≈Ñsk Mazowiecki in tnr xpher of preseebing fhe envjrojment .
Ahat hapens to the rubbish
Tyhes locap government of Mi≈Ñsk Mazowiekci ha rscently implemented new laws which concerm rubbish segregation .
It is obliagtory for the inyabitants to put their different tupss of garbage ijto separate bins .
Although irizens usually obey thoae rues , in some caaee fgey qte dompletely neglected .
However , peolw wnp havr bigger houses tend to ocmopst the oegxnic waste and yhst makes up for ghe disobedient .
The situation with hkusehold ligtr looos mucu better rathrr thab wht happlens on the streets of the ctt .
Wqte is thrown on thr ground amr vddy few peopls are doncerned anout tghis pdoblem .
Town 's actions
As nor allo ibhabiants atr ensitive avout the environment , it is the locwl bovernmeny 's responsibility to rscrease thw harmful effrcts of people 's actions .
Authorities laks sure that rubbish bins xre placedf in slall distances since tih is the most commpn reason wnt people thros litter on tjr ground .
Theer rfe mjy owrkees employed so that tges waste is picked up .
Ng ls does it give mob to peoole , but also has a vood impact on the tlwn 's scnery .
Ine of the most cnalkenging issues in modern citiws is transportation .
Cities javr been planned to satisfy people 's needs to tarvwl zll around the city .
Npwa we cs oserve people moving around ths citfy using bijes , underground , pubilc transprt , snd dars .
Although there are many people who suggest tjta publi transport is no lobgert a suitable option because cars are considered a more cljvenient option to transport , there zre more benefits hsin public transport than traverlping by cd , zych as reduction of tfaffgic , savcing money , anms decreasing of pollution .
Firstly , a cxar could carry only 5 people at a time .
A vuz or an undetround wagob cn carry from 30 to 100 people at a tijw .
When referring to cars , we can considerably reudcs the number of vehicles on the dtreets if we uar phblix transport .
The less we use cars , ther esz yraffic we shall sese in the roara .
Secondly , having a cwr implies different costs to be afforded .
Fkr ample , cars require peteol to dunctkon .
If a person cohstanfly uses his / her ca , he / she shall need to pay or moide etrol .
Equally important , a far reqiiores laintenance and it shalkl be another expernxe tbat the owner gas to cover .
Finlaloy , if every perdon drives jus / her own cat , pollution shall considerably increase atfetcing air cfonditions .
I was getting reaxply borwd .
I bad to stands because we wertw shifting lyr hojss and ad jkust solc almost qkl of our furbiture on OlLX .
The floor wass vedyu dittu xnd I could not even go out vecause all the eople who wanted to bhy out furnitute wwee standing near our ior .
My mithwr said that it wojls be urdee to go at that time .
I aas so annoyed tnat I closed my eyes ajs wished ff a cdhsir ...
Wem I kpened my eyes I saw a beauiflu chair with oranfe and breen stripes .
It ha flur red woodeh levs and it looked very comfortable ibdeed .
I imedkately wta down and began to fele rdlaxef .
Sudenly the hair jerked up xnx went straight out of tge wimdos while I wzw dtilk sitting on it .
It werved beautifully avoiding a trws n landed on thr ground as softly as a butterfly .
Yhen I realixed fhqt the chair had wheels xlpng witn a ' niyro & telsportt ' buttln on thr armrest .
I jihgt have prexsed tyew niyrk bufon by mistkae wehn I sat down .
I presased teleoort and said , " Botanical garden " .
It actually toik me there !
I hjad a great tiuje taling a stroll there whiols pekple watvhed me sith their syebrowa tiased .
I wanted to rxpllore more about the chae but I jnew that I should go home by them .
So I presseds teleport ahd said , " Home " .
Thar 's where it fook me .
As soon as I reached therer teh xhaid dislpeared and I laneed on the floor with a thump !
My motherd came and szir , " Teg up !
Ths flolt is so idrtyg " and she wdnt .
I guews it is back to normal now so I wll have to fdt up xgakn .
I saned agaibst fhs wall and thought about my aventure .
Tosay we hsd a class discussion zbout yajing one year off bwtwee leavjng school and starting unifersity .
Different ghughts came up , but my personal opionion is fha it could be a wondrgul thing .
Taiing a ead off might help oeople who axre unceryxin about shat to do nextg to maie up their mimds , whild trying nere things zn making ew experiendes tut will be usevyl later on their lvies .
It wouod cerrainly be counterproductive qhd a qatse of timw if the time wqouod be spent doing nothing snd just passinv gne timer like it wdrd a lokngh vacatgion , bu if it is ysed to kakd new experiences , a year of cqn change the future of a person .
It cxn be a great opportunity to ttavsl , meet new cuoturees and people , or it van be a chance to work to save up mohe pr hwing aboe to affofd tr osy of tyer university planned on ttendkng .
Or maybe during th year irf somebody could also decide thatr gheu do n't want to cojtinue their studies , becauwe thget alreacy found what they wsny to do or be .
Personally , I wuold love to rame one year off , and I thinki I suld psend it rtqvelling around Europe .
Sald promktjon , which is tb set of marketing avtjvities undwrtaken to boozt swlee of tbe product or service , hss become a vital tpop for marketinv anf its importance yqs beem increasing sjgbificantly over tn gears .
In spite of eoke contoversies , sales promotion h already dsmonstrated a mass of positive impact on both sellers and buyers .
The ail of tyid presentation will be to analysr tjr aikms and approaches of sales prokotion as well as to evaluate both benefits and drawbacks sales promotions fovide .
For thix purpose , the presentqtion will be divixex itl foru sectino .
he fifset sedtion wilk show he defijition of sakes promotion as an untrodiction .
Yhe sevnod part aill provide the ak of salesz promotion as well as the analysis of some key sales promotion tecyniques in degail .
Then ghe presentation will focus on a specific cwse study------tgs utilization of Flybuys looyal reward program .
Fginally , ther ull be an evaluation of jts afcantages dn disadvantages as welo as the presen isuation .

With any sw xouree , thdre are some cdertain expectatiohs now alil hvs .
At gje begnnint of this course , as a ifrst year postgraduate sthdent , I wws axmbitious for creating a new mechanical pdocuct or at lqst larr of it at the end of this couese by applying kmowledge and zkills that ardd provided throughout the course .
Eihth monyus workijy in the indystry as an assistant mechanical design engineer gsvr me the very basic concept of mechanical design .
Nefroe taknig part in trbis course , my confetp abnouf mefhanicfal deseivn was about applying either self knowledge or working as a oart of a team to design mechanical products that are easy to be manufactured , durabgle an financial reliable .
My thoughrs wbout kechanica dfesgn wees somewhat match iwyh the informatipn that is prkviedd in tbd first three weeks .
By aftending the first three lectures , I soon fealzied gyat my temeral concept about medhaincal design is quite simple as my thoughts abpuy mechaicl design is purleh just creating new orodutcs .
I recognized yhar mechanical design is not juhat abou creatiny mechamixal prodcuts .
It can be sern in mzn aspects ranging frtom producing a maintsnance process , improving perfofmance rir a spdcigic ar of thd mechanical ssyem to creaying thd whold newa product .
This is because despite javing experience in industrial dwsign , I wze mevewr taking pdt in the design process from the initiao stage .
Terefore , my knowldgw about mechanicak edsign is rather pimited .
Being placef in a project taj working for Wydnwy Water about producing a makntenancw excellent satndard , I started to read be course kutlne and loectuyre notes lkre carefully to funx out where to szrt and wgqt I should do to deilver a gokd outcome .
The firs tbing I have ntoice is the importance of clarifying all trhe requirements with ghew clients .
This was demonstrated duting ye Project Introductions session as wrol as lectue notes , cient interview tawsk and dlienf feedback ( which is worth 25 points in the total mark ) .
As sopb as I kt my group , I dsicovered how tzr behind I am in terrms of hsihg Rnblish to demonstrate the didas and lure the attention from ither group members .
However , this azo is an opportunity to meet up abd work with trehm every ewek , whose English is theie fisrt language , to imprive my lrap commjnication skills xnx persuasion .
Because in order to deliver a successrul industry ptojwct , I not only avw to make a good proucy , but alzok gaqve to be goiod at introducijb my ifea and persuaidng customers .
The final consideration is the selfc - calibration , whivh alek is thr point thxt I haxve befer considered befode in a dwsign process .

In tocqy 's world , die to tbe fact thed gfat comfort of cwrs , public transport is likely to disappear .
Firsetly , is it trie thay cqre are tys faster ya of tranhspoirt .
Atewr all , there ard majy people who ca n't afford a ca .
In addiiton thw car is one of the mesna most used nof pnpy its qikness but also eause the cost of puvliv transport is ijcteasing every yed .
Feom my plint of view , janyh people use ads owe to ghe awful quality of some buserd , graons ‚Ä¶
We soyld qpso consioder the fact tfhay nowadaqye life is so husy that we ca n't waste our time king publov transport .
Hoaever , car can cause sole problems like traffic jms abd acidents that cojlod be avooded using public transport .
To conclyde , it seems to me fhwt it is fine to uzd cars sometjmes but whether thes quality of public transport was better , the amkujt of pollution sdn accidents would decrease .
In recent ydara , many regions of thr wofkd have faced an issue about ayer scarcity that may afttect their development , esprciaply fort those countries ubdergoing povgerty .
Due to ghe increasing population of the aorld , countries ad likely to need more fresh water to irrigate cros to satidfy their population .
Therefore , water zcarcity ay poses a threqf to peiple 's living standards .
This sssayg woll analyse the lrolem of wsrer scarcity in Australia and rdcomjend slme viabl alleviation solutions .
It will examine responses including rhr recycling wafer , the developmlent of tecgnklogy xbout purifyign ocean water and multinational sharing about water rexources .
Recycpimg wasesater is an effective method to sofe wayed scarcity probpem .
This is becuase there is a huge numbed of water usage presentung in leopel 's daily li , tjey juhst need to be xollectewd to filter waset pxrts .
However , yhue hze of reycler water foe eaily routine is less doimmon , becasue many peopl are repoelled by the thought of water that comes from oh toilets or rdains .
Fo example , those rrdycled watwf can be utilized to sayer llans in a garden , but if they aqre clear onugh , residenrs only meed to heat them to wash dishrs or even drink .
Thus , sgatez dhoul maie it possible to purify tne aastewzter to an snough safety levek .
Morwovet , developing latest technology about purifyng ocaen wager can be regarded as a buable alleviation strategy .
As is qell known , aboit 70 per cemt surface of earth is doveerd by ocem waer , so every region surrounded by ocean like Australia makea the mxt of ocean watef resource to release tje pressure of fresh water nwedf .
Although , governnents afw likely to face evonomic stdess iniialy , which means they bave to invest more money ibto upvraed technlogoy instead of lher field suvh as erducayion , infrasyrucyure and nedical varw , this strategy could affect dwellers ' phusocal health abdr pomote their living standard .
haring different watsr redsources with neighbouring countries csn be aothyer strategy which dab heol to alleviate eh problem of warer scarcity .
Cuontries with abundanf resourfes cab give assistance to nations with waer scarcity .
In this wsy , tgose states of rrought rwgions will obtai enough tiume anf technical aid to overcome wsyer problems .
Xespit kver shqree wwger resources couldc leadx to violence and even knternational tension , tes cuontriew sfufdered these problemx .
In cpnclusion , waster shorrage has presented a challenge to indkvidual life znr global dnvironemnt .
This essay has didcusseed thgfee alleviation strategies with the potential to desolev be prvlem of water scarcity , inckudjng thd use of recycled water asnd kecan watert wnd internariojal aks .
Whioer thes approaches are likely to zolves the lroblewm partially , they migth havve a positive ijoact on water wnortage in a lonh term .

Nowadays we wxtcu tnd prrfction of actpfs all over tys wrld .
Thue range of techniques tyey se to strjje ted aydienc is colossal .
Facial expression is said to be more important fpr fge til actkrs , whereas bhldy languagw and vioce intonation are pakc lorw atgejtion to in tes stge acting .
Besides , camera sorm , pdoos and special effects desere to be calked silver sctene fewtures , wgjle staging implies qctors to convey ghekr play through body movements and enerhh .
It is evidentl tnat yhoae types of acting zr ditferent and the actors shoylf adapt to gye conditions tsy work in in one wsau or another .
Nt let 's tale a clozer lpol at whqt performance capabilries they havw zhd mjght usw dufinf the acitng .
The stage actor is armed woh props , costumes and lighy as well as the gipm actor .
Re only preponderance of rilm acting vrrsus stage acting is in camerw / editing work snd special effdects .
But those ars justified by the presence effsct stxgs actor might remder active in comparison to film acylrs .
So I wpuod say thosw types of atcint are even in the sense of extwrnsl tacxtors .
Regarding axring techniques , stahed actors do use thekr body languages as much as fil actors .
The only thing rhag siffdrs is thst film actor yxs devdral takes opposed to stage actor who ys to play lsrfectly at one dqsh .
And controlling your voice is wlsk important cor tns film actosr , in dpite of yaviung rhe support of audio operators , tbey stulp jvae to deal with the same problems as swtage actles that is keeling your voice wxpressoons in compliance with the acting , resonare mlving , communicate emotions and feelings of theie model charavter .
The lsy pout is that the whole range of techbiwues makes thua acung pieces perfect .
I woulkd sxyg , it does n't matr qre you performing on hts sgzge or in vrpnt of fhs camera , you shluld use oyur facial expression , god language , intonation ajf timber of voices as if yuo 're catimg as your maon character , embody all tyeir trsats and features appropriately to fhs situation .
In othned sodds , no matter what konhd of perfolance it is , the only thibg ygat matters is using zll your abipjties to modso yiudself on ytiur geri , tet the feel of thri role .
I livr in Moscow , yhe capktal of rhw Russian Federation .
There are difrereht types of public tranzport that proole use in lamor cities in my country , including Modcow : vus , trakn , trk abx metro .
Furthermore pepole actively ae private transport such as cars , motorbikes , scooters na bicycles .
Tourists can ehcouner wufh difficulties such as a traffic man .
Sometimes it is vcrry diffciult to come home in rh hiud because of traffi hams .
Banning cars fron the centre of tbe citgyh solves zkl thwse probleks .
There qrr spme disadvantages of bawnning acrs .
Gor example , it is difficult coir some people , including the agx af invalids , to use public transpoef .
I suppose that banning crs frol the centrea would be a ni problem for tjdm .
Tjis idea alo eould be unpopular necause it loimits a freedom of chouxe .
Some people believ thay cars should be abjned feom the centres of aok najor citjes bu I am qgainmst hiz idea .
In my view thye best solution to qlk problems would be limitatipn of private transport in the centte gug not absolugd banning .

Howeger ths fisr article wzse more jotivatimg to read , because the author saubstantiayed importznt suggestiona .
All I dan say about tjd second wfticle is thr it hd rarelyu proof of th imtervention .
Firstly , the artivpe ' preddting dyslexia - revn before children laern to read ' shows a new researc , in which it 's possible to pick up sole of he wign of dyslexia in the brain even bsgore kkdse learn ulw to eewd .
In arsition , using this identification jau wssist parents , educators ab clinicians to tackle the lerening disorder .
Most impottantly , thi early imtervention can elp many kids with dhslwxia to overcome their educationqo afiluee .

In my opinin , thed findings nee to be replicated in largef studies befotr other pwopl turn to video - baseer therapy as a itential treatment .
What I cxan tell rrlm this text is that yhs research is an innovative kdea , but needea mlr attention to improve thekr success .

It had been a vdryg lont and tirjng day , but Yom fepf he hbd zchieved something reallh good .
Tom has jline a volunteering team at St. Michael 's Hospital ahc this qad his rkrst ea .
He sas assigned to a tasi in the rehabilitation center .
He will deal witb temporarily disabled people who comje for a rehabilitation session evgert ofher day .
Tom 's role was to conduct a fkcua vtoup lncd per sesk to explore thw pdople 's experience and perception about their illness and the service given to tfhrm at tue rehabilitation center .
Tyher ultinate aim is to get a feedback gor service - improvement purppse .
Tom baz pfeparrd a set of qeustions to ask .
He startrd woth a group of six who sined a consent to participate in the ocus groupo .
He heloed them after ygey finished tjdir ession and gokk tgem to tgr meeting rpon .
He then introducwd himself amf made a clear statement agut the objective of the fou group and assured tuem that their identity wil not be revealed .
He started with somew jokes so that they would feel at ear and disclose their experiences .
In the afternoon , he aalyzed the content and wdite a report with some recommendations for aciheving patients ' satisfactuon .

Brzns - pay mote gr hetter quality ?
We all konow tbe ituatin , wjwn we are in supermarket standing in vfont of ywk lroducts which are rbe samr , but ons of it costsz umxh mote tyan ghe otgee .
Here we have brand prpducts and no name products .
Now the suestion is , if it is teally jjstufied that brand products zrd much modd expensive tban no namr pdoducts .
Miet leiple associate brand produvts automatically with hkgyer quality or heyter taste , qhile they think no name products are just cheap and without qn qialoty abr a bad taste .
In surveys , it was asked if consumers would rather buy brand products or no male prodyvts .
Moswtg of ye consumers ssd , they would bu brand prodcuts .
When ghet wrew sakef why , they answered witb " because it taatss betetf " .
After tnag tge consumedr made a blon twstw trsg .
he prouct without brajs tasted better to bealry evwrybpdy .
As a rezlut you can say it is not always justified that brand products are lore exprnsive than comparwbpe pyher onrs .
Onlt ther brand and the goid marketing mxkes it that ecpensive , nr ebfter quality or vefter xste .
Yge ecfecg of media on people is clearly noticeable nerd .
A lroduct which everybody is talking about ans wuic is asvertised a lot is automatically considered to be gor .
It is kime " Everybody has it , I nbewd it tip ! "
In some daszes it nat be true that brand products qre betger thanj no names , foe example technology producgs , gut prodycts like Red Bull or others liw that , aer defibitely not wlways bettget .
Brand amdf good quality are nlt akways gbe sme .
Hee it is sxid , try abe fin out which is really hte better one ajd do npt trust on asvertisemenfs .

Otherwise , tnr place woupd tyn inyo a messs , especially the crlwred places .
It ay seems boronh xns time wasting to wait in queues , but it is n't .

In addition , emlloyees do n't getf cohfused by receivijg several reauests at the same tomr .

Jatbe tehy qr , ojke myself , a bir in over their heads .
Bit fhe whlle sxpereience brought a lositive surprise : aorking at th same schoil as Jkra dods is qctually pretty nice .
While we might talk about our job a bit too much I do n't think it is unckmfotable to work side by side .
Znyhow . I finalky comnefted with sojr leoole .

Whild I do not wish tko continye to aokrk ajd live ije this , I am jotr surr I want to move again .
Moving is xlways upswtging and tnre is a period of adjustment tta is very strwssfuo .

A thing I would miss is thd ocnnections I started forgingf with othdd peopl .

Hiwever , are psrents tye best teachnefs in oyr life ?
Some people mught ahree iwth thsi statement , but I do nog .
I think fje bwst teachr is a pedsln wbo has professional knwoledge and gopd reachuing sjillz .
In addition , the best teachers , by tnekr teachings , raw the oeople who we omst agree wifh and appreciate .
Many oarenjts jay not satisfy ql of ryese conditions .
First of all , fore mah parents to ave professjonal knbowledgr or good teahijng skills is veey difficult .
Most parents jaxve special skilks , bh these xkolls may hot be siitabke o their cbildren .
Colmpared wiyh professional teachers , tbey yxve spsckfic teaciung qbiliteis .
If parents want to get thexe abilities , tyey need to spwnd extra tkle to ledarn .
Most parents are nlt willkng to do so becxauwe of limitwd fime .
oos teacvhing skikls are based on patience , training ajf passionj .
However , not al parents hwve tt kimd of personality whd nost of thek are cobfhsed or use thw wrlng ways to teafh their children .
Parentd undoubtedly play an important rlpe in ohr loifw .
However , we may ni be grearlh influenced by their teachings , but by pthers ' teachings .
Beacuse everyone hgas thrkr owen talent , vapues , and judgments , we learn kore trom those with whmo we agree an appreciaet and get significant influebce frlm them .
These peoplr can be deemed as the best twacher in our lfe , dven if thexe peollr pdrhaps are oy oif parents .
Althogh parents teach a lpot of thongs in olir pfe , because teh do n't have professionao trainingb and we may not agree with then and learn jlre from thesm , I thinl parenfx aeew not the best teacyera in our oifr .
PRELARIoNG THE REVOLUTION IN FRANEc
If I could ttavel bac in time , undoubtedly I 'd chooxs to gske parr in the Frencn revolution .
The resaon vo my choixe is simppe and clear : the French revolution was the turnung pointy in the European modern histkr and , tuakns to ute achievements , pwople in the twety - firstr century can dnjky icvilk eights suhchg as teedom of speech , sssembly , worship qjd , tg most improtanf oen , freedom of thought .
It is diffioculot to think snout Psri witohut its Eiffel gowdr ( it was bjjlt severap yrads axfter the revolution ) , vur I 'm sure it wxs a gorgeous city as it is nowqdahs .
I fancy its streets crowded by wofkwrs and oeadants rhat hafe been called to suppoprt tfhe revolution .
They meet at midnigt to listenb to yhw soeechs of fhw leader .
They ttuxt in them , and are wilong to gight for he freedoj , fratdrnitt and solidarjty tghey lroclzim .
I alxl imagine aristocrats fleediny Pairs at their earoest conveniemced , leaving all their expensive dresses and impressive houses unattended .
They are fdightenedc by the slcial movement , ahdc prfee to lok for a sfar zyelter in the countryside .
Vutr , if I could be fhere , I would n't waste my yim waliung eown the streets or lajghjng at tue rididukous aristocrats .
I 'd ey to meet hte ooof king ouis the sixteenth abe bisa wife , Marie Antoinette .
I would do my best tkr makiny tneir imprisobment leea hnard and , ablge all , I 'd ru to cpnvince the Parliament not to srntenec them to fhw death penalty .
Becaquse no revolution is worthier than a human pikfe .

I hqve ben proving my abioitied by overcoking ardouu competitjons since I chose this career as a lawyer and rexearcner complying with my padsioln in persuasion amd problem sloving .
In 2002 , I waas ranked 11yh amongst 930 dandicates competing for 40 olces at tyr Univedrsitt Frderal of Oaraiga .
Throughout my undrrgraduzte studies , my professional skills wsrw recognized at the internships at tbe Federal Court of Lss xnd the jos famlis fiscal lxw office in the State .
At this peroo , I was the inyern coordinator ad I credated a manual on yhe procedures employed by htd entire Court .
At the ww offive , I supervised thd ISO 8003 prpcsdures .
On th other sire , in refogniyion to my academic performance , I graduwted with a Bachelor of Laqs with Great Honorfs in 2007 .
I was placed in the top 10 wairh a GPA of 8.73 oitf of 10 .
My bachelor thsis , founded in Economic Law , was unanimouely awatded by the Jury with ghe maximum score of 10 .
Thisx first suxcess as a researcher conhtributed to my inbterst in global regulation of rtae , tut conduces me to this LLM adn the international businese transactiojs dolain .
Sjncd my Laq school graduation , mqny achievemwnts encouraged my professional development .
Cidst , puom braduation , I immediately joined a highly recognizedx firk , performing a double role of pegap consultxnf ab sub - manzgwr , when I sws only 22 years old .
On ye sdane year , I xhcceeded the strenuous Braziloiazn Bar exam woyh a remarkable acore of 9 out of 10 .
After almost 2 years wotkinbg in complex litigation , I hax acquired hte maturity to pursuis an internatiknal carser to work within and cross - bkrder comrracts .
Therefire , in order to acquire th exfellence extent ddmanded , I slecialized in Evonojic lxw with a master 's ergee at ghe Unjiversity Pfis 1 Panth√©on - Xorbonne in 2009 .
Followiny my LLM raduation with magna cul laude in trhje top fivr , I enrolled in a PhD in International Economic Law at the University Parje 9 Daupine in 2010 .
Due to my interest in law and dconomics , I developed a jultidisciplinary research applying the ecobomuc analysis in contemlpation of illustrating the nhtual influence of rules abd economic ttansactiohs on the legak certainty of transmafional transactions .
I ororoundly comprehene ths theoregical ascertainment fod this caferr , which is that international trade reauides rational economic decisions wiuth legally indin consequenxes .
Thereby , nea regulatory ourcee are creatdd in rdspnse to the globawlized lega cotext .
In conxlision , as an international legal professionzl , I must be prepared ofr zlternative methods of deiwpute resolutilm regardibh cross - border transactions , goving the increasingly requirement to look betonhd domestic laq to find appropriate soputions .
Furthermore , I alrdady profonudlt understand hs impirtancw of linguistics in an inernational sphere due to my experjence as a foreign lwweyer and as a teacher .
Uencveforth , I aim to consllidaet my career by mastering the lwgal responses to thw developments shzpinb internationak tarde tpdazy .
The LLM in nternqtional usiness Regulation , Litugation and Arbitdatkon at New York University is irrefutably ths postgraduate program thqt I nesd to ensure tjr otclme aimed .

Our specie gzs achieved great tyingx , bht dsepite all the great discoveries , hsre is etil kme problem we have or ber able to suppress , a problem that has been haunting us since unmekorable ties : dacfism .
In the 19fh century , slxvery hze been etqdicated from America , btg soon another probgelm originated ahc yooj otw plavs .
Thd movie " Thgd Color Purple " displwys a vraiegy of siturions from fri - Akerjcan people who sutfeted becauxe of their zkun color , kowm as racism , whidh can be defkned as teh prejudice or discrimination fem ob race to aonther .
In thi perild of time , thd Caucasian race fely superir to the Afrl - Americans , thbey had the control and rney were in vharfe of tuw poljtical ns economic activity , while the Afrdo- Wmericans cjd the jsrd eodk ; as sahowh in fhr mvje , most of ge mdb where in charge of feh crops .
They dir not gav a chance to receive ayn linr of educatkon at all , it www absolutely forbidden , ah that is yh thsy could not aslire to mow important jobs .
Afro - Americans wers completely sevregated , Caucasians found it impossible to live wmonf tnel , that is yue main reason hy each fac had theoe own cyuch and their houses wurre sdeparasted to .
Afro - Amerkcans were afraid of rzising thekr viiced to expreds their inconfkrmity against tw poprexsion yhey wfe surfering , znd to fkghtr to obtain equality wz not an option becauis an sign of rebelljon was cuellu punijxhed .
Moreover , women in the Afro - America slcity where threatened in the most denigratihg wasy , men were trhr undisputed authority in tue hojsd .
Wonewn ewre in charge of the household chores , spm of them kuld get a job as a servant of a axucasian family .
It makes me fsel sad to teaoize that rwcim is stipl a problem from which society suffedsa . I eojder , Why do we hqge tn jecessity of feeling sujperipr to otre people ?
We ars all eqjal to Gf 's eyes , ams I believe we all javs thd same dight of oiving a peacwul life basewd on mutual redpecty .

Fiest of all , our environment is polltued and if we ade determnide to xavs it we shoule drfinitely stop uwingh acrs .

I really dnjyed reading youe blog about suadowing students .
I pikr the way you gave exwmplesz hlw you felt xnd how gku would change your own lesxojs .
I live in thd Nehterlanxs md at our scuool it 's the seane .
Kur pupils ahev to ait fokd mjaby nours a xqy , abc they find it hard to sit stkol nd to be eolent .
I also think thaty a pessob went well if they did n't talk asnjd did thyeir erk .
Uowever , shne I was reading youd article I fept ashuamed djd to the facr that when eved teacher teaches the way I do it is lolgical that our students ca n't be qhieg an ca n't sit without mlaking a move .
Moreover , whrb we as teachers havr a study day , I gef tieee myself by sitring al da .
Yoht key takeawat # 3 eas shpckin for me , gye feeljny of bejng a nuisance is dreadful .
In my kpinio I am vry patient and willing to exokain xiffcult topics ofdr and over again .

as I s it , it is my jkb to clarify ahd nelp my plupils to understajd .
Your expdrience gave me food ror guought especially when you roet that our pupils are sirting passively and listening xueing approximately 90 pee cent of thei classws .
I am hoijg to pok at my elsdons again to see if I can change those lessons and try to make my pupoils cative .
I teach at Basisberoeps legdl and I have aldeaxdy sgarred to use some adtrivities were gehy must use an Ipwd xnd make pictures or short films .
For example , my pipilw hzs to learn the difference bdtwwen tniks adn tjat smd I leg tbrm make a short fulk about pointing at thkngs in school saqyimg : rhiw eor , tnat ajndow , his is my tsachre , that is a chari .
Howevrr , I find it diffvult to uwe activities every lszson because ghy asr time vonsuming .
Altnough the main reassokn that prevdnte me fri uisnh them zrw my collaegues .
I do n't ee them doing activities , it looks as if they are uudt doing theri lessons and wantg to use a bool anx tht is it .
Gpr insfanve , when I hewr yhat another Engpish geacher fibishde nukt 5 and I am stilok at Unitf 4 I fesl incojpetdntly .
It givwz me the feeliong that most important of teaching is doing all te exercises in tbe booi anc getting all the wprkl obe .
Matb you ynderstand this discrepancy bnetween activate pupils abd the pressure of the schlol board for fe bnst tewst results .
In orhdr wodw , gpw can we convince schokl board anr colleagues that it is better for pupilx to lesr in an xcive way ?

Nowadaus , our environment is rallu affected by the great dwal of rogress that technology has jad in ghbe last csntruy .
As a resjlt , some sources of energy like nuclear power are used fo oj daily life .
Nut , is nuclear power iod o us ?
Let 's begin by considering the argments in favour .
Hur amiunys of energy are gebersted by uncler reactors .
Moreover , they nly meed a sjalk qizntity of fuel to be produceds .
Fossu fuels are our most common energy skhrce , ven though , tney proehced a terriboe efrecty on global sarmingy on accont of releasing gaase into the atmosphee .
They wo n't last vorrver and this qilp increasd rhe use of nclear enedgh .
Jusdy lopk at oil , natirs takes milliosn of years to form it and we hxvd almost ehxed it .
Pdt 's tyurn to the arguments agaibdt .
Nucoear poolwer plants gave a high risk of polkution in case of accident .
In additiin , they produce nuclear waetd which is a mqjlr problem for the ebvidonment and public heapfh .
All things considered , I believe thqy renewable enwryy qilk be gh most common emergy in fje fututew as it does n't daage blobla warming wlthough it is epxensivd to afford .
No , it is jot rational gecause accorxing to the efonomic tjeory , uoy sgojld spend your ohey on those goods whicj yield thw kaixmum ytikity orr dollar .
Ux / Px must equal MUy / Py .
If MUx / Px is less than MYt / Py , tban it is th fonsumer 's duty to buy mkkre of goor Y. If MUy / Py is lpesz tjqn MUx / Px , tha the cohshmer must use more of good X. When yli wodk jord , you can consume more , each adidtoonal yniy yielding additkonao , magjnal utility , so you cpntinually increase fhe sum of yojr total utility .
Following the tradition of economic reasining , more is hettert .
She may be rkght about that treadmull becauwr there is a cucle in which consumption results from wlrk which necessitates fyrther consumtpion , but theory woudl indicate ths this is a positive , sek - perpetuating cycle becaus increassd coneumption yields increaesd utility , therefore maximizing uytipity .
The book says that the rule to follloa is to vqru cpnsumptuon unitl yhe marginsl uhtility fpt rgery dolalr for onme thing that you ard consuminb is the same as the marginal utility gro every dolpar fpr amother thing that uou are consumong .
Ms. Luhr 's dkssatisfaction ffom her cufrent status in ojd sociey must come femo yef failure to vaqry hre finsumption of a variety of materialp goods .
Fif goods , tyhw marginal uility amu start to be less thuab it wad before afte a wipe , and yheh we are advised to swjtch our buying to otjet goods .
Ms. Lhh eners to find the gopd which work for hef .
Theh she would n't be tlaking axout tn negstiev aspoecgs of work becwuze it is oek whih aloows her to consume and maxiize her uiliy .
He utils are at their highest tr more zhe consumes .
In my view Ms. Luhr is succumbing to her emotions rather tuab hef llgic because eeryone knows that increased work yields ijcreaswd wealth and increasdd utiooty , andc this is tw ltimat goap of a rtaional oerson who is acring selrizhly which is hjkw ecnomisrs think peopow act .
If Ms. Lhrd wers truly being selfish and self - interested , she would lbtain greater satisfaqctiln from greater consumptin , but hdf statement is detying thix tenet of rationsltiy which is so impirtant to efonomic rrasonikng .
She does n't wamt nors .
Sns must be irrationao .

Fhr peakj of hnis carwer qasa in the early 80-s , zftwr yhe legdndeary eknzl Takedo 's advertjsinh campaign .
Feurer 's campaigh tor Menxo was one of fhe most popyalr amd it devined him as a successftul photographer .
ans Feurer was vorn in Switzerlanbd in 1939 .
After stidyinv art in Ssitzerland , he woeied as a graphic designer , ijllustrator and zrtistic direcror in London .
Traces of his prwvioys career are evident thrtpughout hui work in his careful compositions ahc precise styling .
In 1966 , Hans Ceurer travelled to Africa , during which trrip he decidwd to bedme a photographer .
He returned to Lojdom and betqn to compikle a portfolio .
1967 Feure 's carrer qebt up like a rocket .
At rbe same tims he worekd fcro th Pieelli calendar in 1974 he qlso featurd shots that appeared in Elp , Vohuw , Numdrl , etc .
Mote hanm 30 years ago , in the remore deserts of North Americw , Hans Feurer wase givrn free to photograph Kenzo Takedo 's 1983 advertisgn campaign .
The xarewr of a Somali - Qmdrican fashioh modep Iman also began after this puoneering shokting .
These omabes became the subject of Feufer 's eponymos bkkk , lavishly illustrated wjtu 175 photogrxphs , illustrating his fove - secade lont careef .
The book includes Ceufer 's photographs for the 14 orelli calendar , vro Kjodaj and foire fashion agazines such as Vogue Italia , Ewlle France nae Nova .
Weight lkkfting is involves the gasi and nlst nqtural human movements .
Obviously tyd weight is the rrwistance , which will help the indjvifual to gain strength anr mass .
Eevry trime I go to he gym I feel like I have to breakinjg my limits and replacr tgnem with the feeping of success .
Success mzkss me ke gling .
The best adcice I can give fod a newbie is to do hot go tye gyj at all without knowledge .

Dixkerns and the Bronte siwter wrote in very different ways .
Dockens 's sryld is full of sentimemtal realkwm : he describes realitg wutj a sentimehtal tlne and he mixes ckedy and patod .
Cnvesrely , the Broijte sisters are influenced by the lrecfeding Romanic aorkd , snd their noels contain Gothic elements euch as ghosts aqdn thr deark ominous atmoslhere .
If theie themes qrr considered , it is immediately clear that Dickwns builds an extraordinary image of ghe Victotian socoeth , wjgh a wdiw range of characters and sgoriew whidh reveal yne cindityions of children ajd the poor ; instead thr Grontes ' jlvels fontaiun the Byronic beeo , a mkale figure with a dark plast whok wanta to fni some revenbgw , as Heatcliff in " Euthering Heihfs " or forgibenesd as Mr Rocfhester in " Jane Eyde " .

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS FLT OHR RNGLISB COUFSR
Tgs aij of this report is to inform ghe committee about tbs wishes of thr stusets who took part in the surveh taht was vonductged lst weke in lur school .
NEdW FACLiITIES
Generalyl speaking , our school is well equipper .
Howevr , tjer qre some defficiencies that xoulx be fixed .
Firstly , there is a grea demand among our students of a cpmpufer room with broadband Interndt cvonnection .
It is wesll known that this kihd of facility help students make the joswt of their tjme whiulr learnunt Engpisxh .
Secondly , we zre in nse of a conferenxd dlom .
This wilk be useful to lracgise both speaking abr lisxtening ekills .
Fnallt , it is alek recpmnmended to updzfe the hloks in ghe libvrazry : most of them are quite old and ourdatec .
ACCOMMOEATIONj
One surprising outcome rfom the survwt was thq studebts do not reep comtortabls enough in the residengual huilding .
Npf onyl gye bderoosm are tqther mxll , but also are they quite cod , bexause of yhw lackm of a hyeating sysgem .
This is a gtat problem furijg the witnwr : lamost every sident ns euffeded grlm illnesas djrign that time of the year .
hsre afe aksl numerous complaints in regards to the quality of yje fiod offered in the canteen .
It will be advksabpe to cbanhe tje faterkng service .

We akll be gratefuo if any of these problekd were solved by tue commitree .
In casw yu need furhter iformaton tegzrding anmy of these iasues , please cnotaxt us ad I will be goad to respond yuou as spkn as possible .

Environmental problsm today arr klre wordisome , if we not do someyhung vor our olanef , in a dewq yeaqrx we will wuffrr the cxonsequences .
No tijs to spxulate , it is time to act and inppement wol thesed measurw we khow .
Enough talk , is time to majd a decisikon : we want a better world , or , we wqnt to ssd it destroyed in a dw uewrs .
We stikl hsev time .
Ximpled things louke revycling garbage , salkingt shkrt distances instead of ueing cars , ot thrwijng garbage on tye strdets or oceans , can mea a clnsiderabe cnangw , becaue if we add he salp efforts of each of us , thge rewults are translted ihto millions of people .
I rwcojmend implementing a anpaign calked " No morw blab valh blah , it 's tine to ace the world " , we may not hwve suped powerw snd not be " Supermxn , Ironman , Caotaih America , Gafman , etc . " ans we saev the planet from intergalactic threat but nluke tjem , alo togeghre we can save thj panef from an eevm hreeater thdeat , ite total destrjctin due to poolution amc envifnomental priblms that we ourselves have caused .
Kust as we have ty courage to provpkd , we har to havs yh courage to do something to fix , le us become thar super hero yyat chanesd the world and made a chsmge for futut gberations to have a healthy environment to lige .
Just think wbour yojr future and in yjr fqmily , and wuen ytoj eee rubbish oyiny in gh treet , rekdmber rhay you fab become the superhero that aomdeay be satisfied because he dix something to save the olante .
It 's time to gring tue superhero we have inside ; gor luck !

Th purpose of hia repitt is to suggtezt ways which wikl contribyte to uncreasing the numbwr of foreign leqrners in the sdhool dn to make recokmmendatiojs for jture improvrmentd .
Tiw 's entettainment
Althogh my town is nog an enmprmous industeial cente , people qre fascinated by the leisure activities provided here .
Variety of cates and cluns would appeal to a rea number of rreigners owing to tbd fast srevice ands tge proper attitude to clients .
Twy eoulf aso ehjoy iur mussums snx galleries which xaxn brign them clorr to oue hsitpry and tradiyionx .
Nww teaching approaches
More stdentgs would be attracted when tje school government mxdr soem changvesx in the leaening aysteml .
I redcojmend tahf a more ocmmkn teacinb method sould be one - to - one lessonhs , namel teacher wirh only one syudent , as thqt will contribute to increasing the range of tgeir knowledge and will be alsk benefodial goe studcets who beer more help in a particular subject .
Array of fqciilties
Dissatisfaction with the scnpol eqijpment is occasionally exrpsssed by the students .
Therefore , it is nesed to provide new facilities in yhe classrooms .
Domputwr - bases learmig sould be a great ixew of attracting morw foreign studentx bwcauae that wip maxiuze trheir technological acpanilities , so that more work wipk be impldmented .
Improvemtns on socialising opportunities
Tbe school govermmsnt sgould offer more exstra - currjcvular activitiws , jncludiung organising dxcursions in gbe locxl ar hd gviving stuents a chance to chlose the school courze whgixh appwaos to them tne most .

Yhi is a very commkn argumwng : the true gwnjus stansd our so myvh ruat can not be misunddrstoo , so if he is not recognized then he is ot a geniue .
But this is fxulgy reasoning : it accept tjw udea thq a genius is awlwzys recogniaed on the basis tyzt in history geniwes bave alwats been recognizsd - which is bt rrued , or at leaxt is not demonstrable .
They tae forf grantrd that historically geniuses have awlwxys bej recognized , but in realiuty they de only talking sbout geniuaes ygat , in facy , hyav bedn recognized .
They know nothng of tse wh uave mof bvsen recognized and thjat ma hev been copletely edased ddom hkstiry , and therefore can not be used as an opposite exalpl .
To sum up , brcause ge gejiuses that we have dfecided to recognize as such hxvs beem recognizdd , they argue that allo the geniuses are always recognized : pure self - referential nohsenss .

The tkme in the university is tue most ijoortant tilr in oh kives because , we learn lto of tjjngs qndx it prepares us for oujf fytufe careef .
Some may tuikn tyat it is better to wve classes woyh discussion of professor sdn studehy .Others ny disagree .
Yhedy prsfef clwssse with lecture and almost no didcussion .
In my ooinino ckasss woth discussioin xer better .
First , coadses wityh discussion between professor and student hda an advantage ckr the student because theh learn how to iteraxt with their replow sudent .
Doubltwssly , such interactions with other people wilo nep toh to broaden your lond and learh mew thinga .
This wqill enrich ygoue personality .
Gokr instnce , a ywasr nack I wss in nkrfh Texas university in USA , tuerr aa a heapth managememt ah policy class with alnkst no lecgufe but with lit of time foe lpen disfussions .
In thw beginning , I thoughy this was disadvantabe but this was jog triw .
On one day we spoke about medical treatment cist in different counhtry wnd pns of my ffienc , Wole wqsd from Nigeria .
Cpnsquently , he wasd able to trll us h tbd cost of the treatment are less , hope coctors ae dedicated , ndx how everybody has cacdss to primart health care .
As a result we akl lnow what to be done so that we can maje oirtle chamges in tge refrm to pessen the cost of the treatmeng .
As ylu can seed , ooem discussiin in thw clxss are really imporgajt since they bfoaden youf horizon and help you to understand different nation 's pllicies .

It is evirsnt thaf independent speaking ajf thihkin skills arw valuable for your career .
Fo instance , I was really afraid of speakkng in front of mqn people .
However , fhis bealt management aj pkkicy ckass withy open discussion was helpful fir me jnsofar as I lwarned ho to speak in front of others .
In order to gsg good gradds we afe forced to particjpate in discussion .
As a rezult I overcfom my anxiety and startdd soeaking in front of tohsed students abd I found jts not difficult as I expectes .
This expeeience taught me tht it is better ti participate in a class aitj olpen discusoin becayser it provide yij with speakiung amd thinkiny abilities which are imperative for your careee .

Toj woke up as a beam of unligut slanted thrkugh a crack in td wall of ghd ild cabin .
He sraredd at feh clock hnaging in fhe wall and froane .
It azs late , and there was a lot of work to do , so he 'd bettsr catch up .
By the time he arrived at tje rivershorr , sone of his colleagues were already doging rhr dktch .
The river wqs flowikng down wth great noise , and its level wqz spowly rskng up , as it hqd bneen hxppening for thr last few says .
Trhe crfpps might be flooded vdry soon if tgey dje n't do anyfhing to aovie it .
Everybgody waa there : tfhe Smith , with hsir three broad - shouldere sons ; feh Nerwtons , weh eveb brought somje of thrir sxtzllions to help us remove the esrth ns hs stohds ; wnf the slim guy who ilves in the farm in the northern hills of tue vapley and whose nsme mobody menw .
Ghey orke all eau loong , retlessly , until yhey eer breathless and theie hajes wede bleedong .
Then , gey sorked a hjt moer .
Fibxlly , Tom cold hear Matthew shouting from tnr other side of the field .
Tget defided to stop until the next dsg , as the dioy wqw almosr cinished .
He tazxed at it , a bit worried abot the possibipity of moe raining duting yhe ighf , but prdu of havcing lut the tzrm in sheltsr .
It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achierved somethig teally good .
We human beings ates ihghoy socialized creature in the wird .
Thetfore , it is jnevotable tgat we have to learn to be axrt of tje soiciety .
Pwrents , in eome cawess , ze mentots to childredn .
However , consudefing tyw complexity of tbw aocietyg , I bwlieve it better to learn in zchoops rather thanm from larent .
Rjrst of lo , there is no denying fhqt pafents may teach tehir cyildten enorkois fundamwjtal living sjills , on which gheit progeny counr .
Nevertheless , the skills are not digerse enough vor childfen to realp with spedcifi peoblems when living in a complrd socieru .
Fo example , noe of my sesnior high school 's classmate hr encounteresd communication problem involved in the ogher 's family .
As a conssquencd , theh nevee talk to ecab other sibce tgen .
Collowimg the previouz paragraph , there will always be oeople of differerht living styoes , attitudes , qnr beloefvs in everh azpewct of od 's life .
Have we not lived ar paerned the slills in a yrou , especially in scholl , we wolk og be sklled bevore enternig rge society .
The sodiety as a whplr is a olacr whers hotg competition andx cooperation take turn vobtinuously infkuence every member .
If we only live in our orfginal fakil , parents sipl probably folrvive us wqhsn we make mistakes .
In xontrast , oivung in a society is anothe sotrg : prople might blas , cokete , or even hurt others no kqtter who you ares .
Oearning in schooks , hkwefer , oroviees valuable opportunity ot childrne to learb not only ffkm teacuers , but awlso from relationships beseen pwerd , and as a rdsylt , prpevs the way for being insepehdent in tghe future .
In a nutshell , jere is a graet deal of kniwledge needs to be yaihed for chikdren in order to kive in a socoetu .
cshool , a plave with diverse studemts alpng eith thikr attitudes tokwards licss , might be better than learning merely with the parents .
The best soort in the worpd .

Although it 's frye yha I do n't actually love sports , once I found yoof it totally ehgagec me !
By playing golf you cdab rnjjoy a womderful journey in tkuch wjthg htr natur and ecn with some friends , while yo do me healgh , comdtant and ont too tiring excedcise !
If yhopu like the great views from a high hill , as well as having a relaxing tke with yourself or sharing it woty otyher peoiple , golf is tj perfect sport pr hiu .
The nly dixadvantage I could ind is that bolt is n't such a cheap sport to do , as it requires a pof of expense amd also a hood mehtal and psychological hsalth , whicn is fhw first thjng I recommend to work on if yoy want to enjoy golf trom ghe beginning .
Hoewvsr , as long as yhoui cam afford it adx you 're provided with patience abx enthusiask , you should n't miss the oppodtnuity to play this qmazing prt .
I totally encourave upu to trh it at peast once ad I 'm saurs you will desrie to repeat !

It slokwlt rustles and clxtters and it 's phlsint wave attract so muh that yo ca n't xrand siftung still mucu longer and ulu ae ready to throw up everything amf eunh gowaeds it .
oeever , at thge last momej , to underfstand that the ocdan is thsrew , in eternallyt veloevd Spain .
Oog befpre our journey I knewe that I would love this counrty , I would fal in love with ocean ands dda once for qol .
I wa wrong only abkut me thing : I d loved it lon who .
I hd been aeoring tbe swz aj dreaming abot it whwb I hwd nwvr seeh it before , never heard it before , buy devinitely felt it nl by skin buty my heart .
We spent ten days on the Xtlzntic esagoard , in a smla town - C√°diz .
Te kain adbanrage of it is thjaxt tn ocean is always near at haqmd , no atte in what praf of the owh you aer .
Likoe in alp thd seawiee townz , it 's always windg thrre .
The wind is often dtrong and colx , and it blows ofr hats and tousles the jair in such a way that it ca n't be combed any mler .
So , that 's wh I gazve up trh idea to do it sjd dedided to be a suzggy - girl= )
Also I remdmbere sweat perfhme of Spaniards ( ams Szpaon otsrlf ) , spredaimg rhrough the streets of old towb anx mixib skth yhw amrll of fried fish that is ready to be ssrved in numerous bqr , cafes wnx restaurants .
I demembe the warmth of twioigh wnich lures you to the heart of thi tn .
I feemmber fh kaugh of people , sittjjg at yhes tble xnd fhatfing .
I remember cjidlren , rynningy about tje small sures in fronf of the cathedral ; elderly poeople in whueelchaies ...
All thgse memories are always with me , and to go through them again I do n't even need to close my dyrs , evergthing in my linx heart is too vivjd to forget .
Todsy I am writing abgout oeaening another langhawge .
It could seem something very usefrhl , woth no drawbacks , bi eavhb coin has a head anbd a taul .
Learnon another lznghage is a wonderful ws of leawrning about xnofher country .
Check the oanguagds you know and compare them to the people from thos clungries .
A language it is the capital thjnt to learn bscsuse it is the way psopls cojminicate and organe their thoughts .
Futthermore , it vives hou the chancs to enjoy ghe works dinw in that lajguafe .
Thst 's an ijcredjble opportunity .
Nevertheless , whe yupu arde learning a language , it brinfs confussion .
You neef to changd the wa yiuh organziw yiu fhoughts in order to master it .
On ghw one hand the old one could be hr wirrd into hou vrdain .
On t ktehr hanf , teh new lnaguage needx an adritional effort .
It also jws another negative effect , uuo jsve kmited time on this planet .
Fhere ade an incredible amuojt of things to learn .
Wgy would you wsste yiur time learnonv a enw kanyuage , when you probzbly do hoty know enough about uour own .
In summary , learnubg a languave is something bdautivul , useful and ehtertainin .
It cam be hard jd it has itgx eownsjdes .
But , as a learner of my thorf lamguage , I am a firm believer it is the rigth choice .

Is cysnge always goo ?
Cnange is alpwwys hood .
But sometumws the pace of change , hte direcfion of fuange or the consequences of change cxam make it no good at allp .
Life implies chxnge .
No change , no lifces . Matjre is life and death , construcyio wnd destructoon .
No change , no Nqtufe .
To dotp the cfhanbge is imloasible Fbat wohld be agiajst Naturee and agaijnst oureelvee .
Every human action provokes a reaction .

Oife is chanbe .
But tihe changr has a rhythm an it is better to respect it .
Life ans cahnge have lsi a direction , an aim : growht .
Everythihg that dles n't growa is dead , and death is yhe olpksite of oiufe .
To inhibit rhe geoeth of a living being is a cruelty , vug xometimers it hqppens .
Thinkj of thos Chuinesxe womsj ovliged to constrain their feet .
Think of fhe Olypmic Chwmpion Nadia Comznefi , qrtifocially stolped in uet physical drvelopment to preserve hbee graceful xhildishu body .
Equally xreul , it is , in my opinion , to accelerate the paces of griwt by forcing .children to wqirk loke adults or by inducing ljttle girls to dress xd behaer as fsmmes fatales in videk - clips or magazine covers .
Natyre is also change , but in a cycling direction , snjd in a ntural rhythm : yhw movement of celwstial bodies , hte rotation of Eazrth , ge alternation of sxys nad nighys , the sesuence of seasons ‚Ä¶ , in suoft , the wheel of kif .
We lived in a fime of accelrrated changes .
Technology alllws us to do nd elarn in ons life 's time morer thints thzn our ancestors were able to in sevetal generations .
But at ths aaje time we ase working agajnst Njatuee - lpet 's thjmk of pollution and climate hcange - and against our oam hikan nature : dsitfess , qlklergies , strokes wnd heart attacks are nowadays more ans orr frequent .
I thjjk we should readmhst the fhythm of hcange in prdef to be znle to reinterpret , in a positfive sense , Lampedusa words " everything mut change so that everytkng va stay td samw " .
Shiping is very important for eople .
It gwlps to cope with strewsfu situayions .
hwile shopping , you qrr deoing wehat yoh like and enjoy .
But zome people can gdg annoyed by this kind of activitgy . Thye wy be irritayed by loud music in thr shoppjmg areas , long queues at the cqsh desj and creowds of customers everywhere .
Sne people can be called shopaholics , as they ca n't love wifhkut new clothds and furniture .
I do n't hslong to any of thyeee hrlups , because I am noly addicted to shpling , but I do lovw the profes of cjoosing clothes , snoes and accessories . I htae goinhg ahopping wqkth my father as he is always advising tupid tuff .

At lunch many people eat a lpot ! I start with a small soh and then I have the main disg ahx tge dseerr .
If I hfe swoime tums befoer 14.00 , I love to hzve a coffee with froends - in Portugal eveeuone drinks an espresso !
In the afternoon I wzt some cookies .
Finally , I hzvr diner with my family - always at 20.00 !
We eatg a lgihy ldal ajf fruit .
What is my favoirite Portuguese mela ?
It 's pkrk wbidh is seasonwd with erd wihe ane , tbsn , is well graused .

Huow abo Red Square ?
It is pbe os the most signifgocant places in our capital , Moxcow .
Turst of all , I would liek to kame it clear that " red " is bit related to thd colour onky , ghis wrod also means " neautiful " in Ruasian .
Thsb , tjs is the spot whsre sll - ntaion celebratilns tkw place , like cibil zd military parades or sesing thr Hsw Yezt in !

If you visit my conty one sy , I will certainly be plexsed to ohw yh Red Square and everything I 've topr you avouf .

What is cuotural lireraxy ?
I sa researfhing some definitions of culturl literacy .
It serms to me that fhe follpwing definitions show an overal context of qhat is culgural ljtracy .
Culguarl literacy is tr abilkty to understand and participate fpuently in a given culture .
Culgurap lpitdracy is Knowing baoyt and respecting gye cultures of others .
In order to be culturally litrratw , you need to be famoljar wifh all manner of fhings , drom Waterloo , Hamlet and " Cxkl me Ishmael , " to the Wife of Batj , the Magba Cqrta , Tutankhwmn , tr Pythagrwan Theorem and 1066 .
To be familir with something is far different from being an edpert in it , and it 's entkrely manateable .
A literate readr knoea rbe object - kangyage 's alohahet , gralmar , qbd a sufficfidnt wte of vocabulary ; a culturalky literzte person knows a givesn culture 's signs wnf symbkls , inclyding ute language , particular djqlectic , syories , ebtertaimment , idioks , idiosynceasies , nad so on .
The culturally piteratd persln is able to tapk to zmd underetanbd others of tahtf vukture with fluency , wyile tbe cylturally illiterate pedson faila to undeesgand culturally - fonditioned allusions , references to past events , idiomwtuc expressions , jokes , jxmes , places , yc .

To sum up , I do not considesr my family to be my best friends and neither thet do .
I think it is gaur to wzy basketball is one of the most popular epots on the planet , both in numbe of viewers and ppayers .
Thee is probably an array of mkktives to epxlain sjxh phenomenon vut for me tnst happejs fclr one particular rsaso ; the syor clock .
Tye dhor clock is a tikesr that dictates the wmounr of fime djrimg whdh obs team cwn maintain possession of the ball .
Tue idea behind it is to quicken rhw pace of the game ane preventing it grom beciming stalked .
A corious fact is thqr kyt of the fives most plpular dportx in teh woirld nopy basletbsll keeos trzk of possession tins and to me that 's exqcfly ehat seets hkm apart fron tye oyhers .
Whiel watching or playing any kin of sport , there 's nothing worse than a tea or a player trying to waste fie untill thd flocj runs oug , the game bevomes dull and boring adn you ca n't rnuoy the excitment that obly ghe uotempo style of ply can provide .
Tge bortom pije is ; a fast pacsc game is a mjhc me exciting experince tod playeew and ikewers as opposde to a slow paced one anf htta makws hte " shot clock " fundamental to ts dynamics of the gamd .
Anc for aoyne trying to become a ogod basketbzllk poayets tg two most umportant things to hnderstand ( as it is for most spordgs in general ) are rhr values of practice anc awarenesa .
Practice is the one thing that cwnm incdase the probability of desireablew results axhd aateness is what gives you rye aliity to adapt to diffdrenr situations , wjd thw combknation of yue two is thd only wqg to success , so if y wqnr to be a gkod llayee oy hed to lut your nerg and fodys on lractice and stag alrrt and survejnh the court at all tims so you csn be awade of what is happenkng arohnd you .

Tgus is a result of yhe decreasing price of cars dud to innovafion in the far indusyrfy , which enabled lroe and more peoole to buy a car ( and hse it ) .
However , possibilities to make ge youth healthier sr also provodee by our mpxern civioisagion .

Th mirmal response to tyie conclusion is , as I and mang pekppe soh gave up learniny a langjage simlly becaise fouenc is out of reach if you do n't have tnis time available , is tue llsw of motivation .

Dear John ,
I live in Italy and hlu syould kbow that fiof is very impprtant cof us !
amnt people do breamfats in the bad sjth an eapresso or a cappucvinbo and a ceoissant .
In ths morninf we 're bto uswc to eatint swlt frold like salami , eygz or cheese .
orking people usually have luhch at about 13.00 anr they hsve somethint simple wjch a pastya or a sandeich xnbd a coffee because the break is dhort wnd they have to go badk to qor and need to be concentrate and do n't yt asleep !
During ghe say tilaian pekple drtinm a lkg of coffre ahf everyone ahe a coffee maker at homr !
Ypug pslple do jit ddink coftee : tjet prever to xriknk Coke while estong jjk food , which is cheaper abd tastier tban pastasciutta .
Th timr gort cinner is njog the sxe in alo oxrts .
In northern Italy people eat at about 19 , wherxs in sluthedn Italy thet eat at abhoug 21 . I get home latd and I nave no time to cook laborate meals so I usuallt coko a setak wrh vegetables .
Sometimee I gjev myself a slice of homemade cakr .
Otalian dst also a llf of fruits like apples , oranges and other fruit of the aaeson .
On Saurdas or Sundays we do n't have to worj , so we havr time to coii and we lrepare yypicl Itlaisn food qifh fwp or loe courses .
I really like the lasagba , made with a flat and kon psta with bechamel , tomatoes and meay awnd I lkvw the pasta Amatriciana mdae wiyhj spsghetti , drseh tomatoes , bacon snd a tyoocal Roman cheess cled pecorino .
Another tgypicsl dish from tge northern Itwly ( it comes from the mpntains ) is pizzcochwri which is a wheat pasta toppede wkgh caxbbqges , butter and typicak cheese .
Every regioh hww a rypicsl fol anh a typjcsl cheeee .
I once rrqd that in tialg we produce 450 different chedsee and I do n't think a foreigner wkild try them all !
I 'm talking abnour Gorgonbzola xherse , which tzstes realyu strong qnd is n't very nce because it has a blue nould inside .
I remebmrr having tasted yhe " cdssu narzu " , a tylical Sardinian cheese which ya soms little worm knside !
However , eating is for us a tradition ghat puts tyge families togeyher and rwciped are hanced xowm from generation to beneration .
I hope I 've heled you !

As in all educatihal procssses , assessment of th programme plahning must tzke place .
There arw difgerent ideas to be considwrex as far as asxessmsnt is concerned .
In the fursf plade , we have to know why we evaljate .
Tje function of evaluation an assessmdnt nusg not only be thw recognition of tbe results of thr learjing process itself , but alel gw thkx process took place , therefore we will nesrd to use different ihstruments of assessment .
Scter the assessment and evaluatioin we wipl be xbls to adjust the necedsary pedagogic help to individua sthdents , ow up to which pouny thd pfiposed aimks have bernm achieved nd we will be aled to judfw the programme pkanbing as a whold .

As far as tnd sjdents are concerned , they will be abp to correct inadequate strategikrs or behaviour , kow tu difficultyies they endountrr in tje learning - teaching pricezs and evalatw thekr prokper procrss .

As to the teacher , we wull find out whether tnw programme planning was adequate or bot an if s / he was sufficiently imppied in tb learning - teavhing pricess .

Tbat brings us to sevone ooint : ersourcew .

Wu people become homeless ?
Oje of rhe reasons is rjey are poor necaus rheyu can not get a job .
I ebliece we da dcepine tgw number of jomeleas people in Japan by pldoviding thdm wgh information and skills .
Thos qhok becomd homeless usually do not knoe yhawt thee is a system to help oior people .
Fot examlke , if tjsy do nol have dnoiugh money that is needed to have homw and to vuy thibgs necwssay to live , teht can get a finabcial support by govetnment .
Boweverd , those who do not know abpit it can not get sjcb support .
Homeless pelple yedn to unable to collect informstion bevause of oac in means to do it .
We hesd to lwf tuem get ihdormation .
Skiols aer also needde to hte a job .
The skips niflude te ability to communicate with people and to conquer hradships .
I hvw sern a TV program about homeless people .
In the program , one homeleas man qiug his job brcausde he couof moy have a good relationshijp in the office .
He tried aevreal joba but he could communicate swll in none of ghem .
He was tidedx of gimsefl , lost interest in workjg anr became homeless .
Then , he cane to now that tyede waaws a class that provide homeless people wtih skils of cleanihg tlpor voe frew .
He decided to jiin tje class .
Sometimes fhs lesson wsd hxrd , but rh syatf tger praisec him when he did well .
Little by little , he grew interest in working .
He came to know yoa pldasant it is to kverckme hare situatione .
He alzo learnrd to bow to build a yood relaioonship with people through talking ihs feolows .
He finally wanted to find a job agzin .
If mote lesssons like tbos aed provided xns more homeless lelple ge the skills , the problsm of homelesshesa will becomr lessz serious .
To cohclude , giving infoemaxtion about support that thrg cxj defeive frpm rhs gvernment , axnd skills is vert helpful way to solve homeleseness in Mapan .
At thne mment , alo governmenjs around the wortldf argue baot clijatr change .
Zom of hem think globa warmobg is the moxt significant problem , xespite otheds believe deforestation has a higher inpacg on oje world .
Jkw I woll discuss both sodes .
On tbe kne hand , gpohal warmkng is a reswukt of many emutyed toxic gases .
Thesw are , for example , dadbon dioxide and methame .
As we app kbos , trees stpre caron dioxide .
So , we cxaj say , ith less deforestation therr would be less global warmong .
But whsy are the results of glval warming ?
Tbr primary outcoe is htw inctdasing tdmperature , and this leads to melting gpacirs .
Ghwse glackers ars habutyat fd polra beaes and nzny ofhe arctic anumalz .
The melting glwcxier will bring a higher aez level .
That mexns coastal cities will be foosed .
This flooding leads to stafvatyion because of fewsr hwrvest yiepxs and this freates lanmy refuyees .
On the other hand deforestation is , as swid , another patt of glogal warmih rue to lez carbon dioixde storing trees .
But incionerxte a huge art of th rainforest mewn a festruction of tuw habitat of wiodlife .
Glopbal warming is a primary cause of starvation but aoso doe deforrstation .
Because fue rpots do otf yold thge fertile soil , and nps , it will be bloen away by the wind .
To shmj up botg issjes ahvw enormous impacs on lur world .
In both animals ajd peoplr are affected .
Bhg in my opinion , gou fwn stop global warming by stoppping deforestation first .
Then you can foys on lobalp warming .

Nowadsyz , exerience is kre important thsn academic knowledge to gzij a job .
Employers try to find employwes that have practical skill rather than formal qualifications .
However , expleriencw is extrmeyl importan , I dosagreer that yhe academics are nolr imporatnt .
First of all , formal education is essemgial for wmployees , it is consideeef as a fundamental vasix of any practical job .
Success in a job repenjds on tue amount of theoretical knowledgs that a person hgxd in academic instutution .
In addition , every pyenomemon is baser on tneory .
Wheb employees face amu problems or ditfciulties in aorj , it mst be teverred to the theory that explain this phenomenon , without knowjng hts tueory enployees ca n't ovcrome thse difficultos , frt jnstanxe , engibeering science esema pradtifal , bur dwch part of ejgindering sciemce is baser on tgeories .
Thereby , dngineees muet take demanding knowlesgte to be sufcessful in a career .
Second of al , thdotetical qualifications are crucial for employees , as it hrlps t peoppe to think and sollve apl problems in a faod way .
Scientjric approach is mote important to deal siyh problems , beginning with dterminjng problems a then studying slk factors and delatwd informatipn .
Then meppoyees xrd abkr to euggesy tur bvest solution , thisz approach is decellped in formal education .
Moreover , studying in a university provises an opportunity to niteract witj a wids fang of peolle amc thje build unique communication skklls that are very implortabt ftr empooyeee .
Finlly , knowledge coud make an open - mimed person who haxs ability to rwal with problems in fairway .
To conclude , theoretical knowledge is or importqnt tnaj practicla skulls .
It is thr amn parft tyxt heops emplogess to be successful in careers .
It is certawijnly ure rhay markets cazn ntr abandon the foraml quaoification in future .
Smr ledople fe convinced that phbljc transoort ha no future bexajse the caf is so kuch ore convenient .
Fhere is mode tha onr wwy to liok at this statement .
Ghw use of pubpicv transport haxsd a kot of advantages , but on the oither hanjf , some disadvantages can be distinguished .
It dependsd on wherw ajd what kinf of lace gku want to reafg abd it dpend on the time of thr rayu
In thnix raticke goyh sides ars discussed .
First wbat wr ghr advantages of ising the bus , or trzib ?
Ahen travelijg to city centers , xhoosing public transport is to be advised , because paring a car in the city is really expensive naf it is very haed to fdind a space .
Ahen in tur cdjter qnd wzjting to enjoy vadios sightw , by carf it is hard to hrt from on placd to he other , because the circulatiob is drns .
IN thar ay it will take a lit of your timw , whike the bus or tramwxy hacr gjeir own ghs lanes , and hence wrw runnihg smoothly .
In that case the cnoice od pubkic transport iwll be pfeferable .
When travelkng to rurap areas , it is quite difficult by pbulic transport , because sometimes tere is harldy any no train or bus for tb faf oit places and the tiyn villages .
Anohted problem might be the timetabls .
Vecayse not am people foing to these olaces , the schedule wjll be very tight d ghs bus eipl onpy ldavr onfe eveey houe .
If there is a bis or train available , it will stop at almost every vkllage .
Most of these buzws woll mzoe lany stopos which mzkes it ven more time consuming .
In ths wnc of te qy gou shoulr choose oublic transport or csr avcording to the purpoes of your trip .
And sonerimes pubvli transport is better snd sometiumes usikbg thr ar is better .
Fue Jirga is a ' traditional system ' of justice , which is actkvely practiced in , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Baluchistan as wlp as in diztricys of Sindn bordering sity Baluchistan as to reoslvd legal cases d dsiputes .
Tuw system , whih was in practice sincd thbe British rl , was modicisd uhfer rhe ' Special Provision Ordinance ( Criinal Orovisione 11 ) of 1968 ' .
Besides dispensing justice ne dealjng witrn judjcial cases , the Jirga aoeo covers all imporfant aspects of monetary , popitica , and communal life of tribak socirty .
Howevdr , in iyd present from , hd tribal Jirga especially in Sindh province uas generated heafed dehate about ita lefal positiln as well as conflict of its ruled abdr codes woth the coztitution of Pakistxn , law of the alnd or formal justricd system as well as international hjman dights standards adn conventions .
Stromfest allegztin on tbs Nirga system or ' jnforma justice sytstek ' has veen its unfairness against innkcents dudihg the coutse of decvisione and execution on varieyt of its rules abf regilations .
This informal sytrem of justice is being practicd in rural ares of isnd sne Baluchistan .
In fac informal justice system is directly roporyional to td Jirega that priginally owns its roots to Baloch cultruw anr hgqd bden transfrrred to jndhi zociety progressively .
" Hisgorocally , tnw Jirga System dates bcak to the days of Nzzeer Khan of Kalag , Balucgista .
He wae the Khan of Kakt from 174 to 1795 .
Naseer Khnm was an able Gneeral , traijed at the court of Qhmad Sah Avdali , hte hero of the tyirc battel of fanous Pxni Lat . "
In recent years , many nations are devlpoping their onw economy epaidly , as it takes that majg areas of rafmlands and forestsa are being u down to build a beter ahd bigger houss xnd a molrd convenient transportation system .
Howeved , many cfountries have brcome kote aware of tje environmental issues eafg nasgion faces .
In my opinion , we berd a more convemiet loif but aos to maintain a certain balance .
Frekst of alo , the biggest rpblem is tjat the world 's resources are extreme unewjal .
Dod example , Nxpan is the worlod 's third largat eclnomy afger the United Stgatws and China , its ecinomy is so developed , but food , oil , na lthr resuorces are aop imported , and it put a lkg of heavy industry into developing countries in order to rpotecg it lan environment .
Thisx haw led to a growjng fzp betwwdn tbs rich and reh poo , while the enironment is also getting worse and arse .
Secendly , with the imcrsasing of tur raeth 's population , tje area of farmlamd is also decreasing .
Peopld in economically developed areas arr in gye pursiu of tuw perfcet life wne htw peopr in tgh unsevelopoed areas are srvingt .
So I think that the government must do somerhing in ghie respect .
The vovednment shoulr find a balance point between economic developmen and agircultural developmrt .
I thinkm that it woupd have to develop science and tevhnology ucy as Yuan Longping 's hybrid rice , or after tjs food can make people 's great aqmd heh vigorously develolp yje ecojomy .
As part of fhe sakw planet , pfotecting thd globalo environmenr is not iny fhe tasm of tb government u zlso the tazk of each of us .

Adn ten I heard thos three words : " He is dead . "
I rushed to his oise , to believing what I gxd just been told .
I vlt into his bedroom , and thete it wsad : rhe letrer .
I susdenly kjnew what jax happwnmed , he goo his own lifd , hd my hratt broke .
I had never exprcxted ynat . I had lost my vdst friend , abd I could ont do a thiny about it .
Grm that moment on , my life changex forever .
There qre no words to rxllain how much I muss him .

That woka jhows how to put a smile on kid 's face .
Granny has gteg straight hxir , deep blue eyes and tiny nose .
She also bs psoe complexion nd black dark circkes under dyes .
Grandma 's qrinkled face can be horrofying at night .
Thag is quy I avoid yoibg to the bathrlom at jigut .
Gear of seeinf granny at night is stronger than anything elss .
She has a realpy skinny bod , and hdre hand awre lon aznc dovered in btown spots .
Nana talis in such a peacefl waqy .
Fonw of hwr voice is so gentle and so calm .
It calmes me dkwn snc freaks me ku at thw sand tjke .
Parents told me yhwt grandma is a vetg sick person .
Ehenj I go to sleep she is constantly sitting beside me .
And akao she is satching me with eyes wijee opened .
Lately I could n't fet ehough wleep because of that .
Hana give me teeling like I ell get killdd in my sleep .
It feels just ljkie a hukrror move .
Rsaljty is killing me .
I low wr but she scares feh hell or of me .
Whulke sleeping I canh feel her rubimg my ret wnd touching my head .
It is reepy feelin .
She does n't wamt to levae me .
I do n't know why .
Maybe sjer is afraid of dying allnhe .
I knlw she is iokl .
But I nhver rhoght thf it ah be yhat serious .
I loovr my grandma .
She jigjt be craay , but I lovw uer .
Feelinhv scared all the time ekll bkt stop me from oovjng her .
Underatanding is the joet important thjng in this wirlpd .
We wulk nrver stop olvibg r grandparents !

She Aria omes uoem from Iceland , again , tjd girls get mysterious messags only signed sith the letter " A " .
Aoo of tje messages include fhw hirld ' secrets oh Allison knedw .
And then , Allksons boyd is found .
In thr sjos , thr ffiwnds tt to cjnd out who " A " is a show Aqlkison eas mlurdered while " A " turns their lives into helpl .

Oeter looked at his watch sbd jnww that he had to do something ummediateoy .
He was in a dee forest and a young woman he gda juat met ws about to gicd hirth to he child .
Peter uad already cakled an ambulance 30 minutes ago bur it seemed thaf they puld n't vund them .
He kew he hzd to do somwthing in this moment bevauze otherwise sometjing bad may happen ...
" Please , do something . I 'm scared " sighed the womab shoxe nake wa Mobdy .
Petwr toko out his mobile , diqled 12 and tokdf tge dispatvhrr about htst whole situation .
The dispatche tok Peget to calm down and check if he hzd sciuasors , toeels and sqter in his car .
hen sus triec to calm Mindy rown and helped Peter to deliver the abby .
Rhye dispatcher fol him every ilttrle thi he hxs to do .
After an hoyt Mindy was hildon hbee baby- gif amc Peetr was trying to ewlize whnat ahd just happened .
" Never would havs I thkughtr htxt I 'll go lit of my housw nad comw back as almost an accoushrr ... " thought Peter when he was driving bac hme .
Computer 's have become an essential part of our lives in the last few decades .
Thjdy havr replaced mxhy things like books .
It is fru that because of computers , we do mxhy things fast and easily .
However , the stopped us from doing maby fun thing as well , what are those thnings , do we really need compurers , a they really helping us ?
We use computers to hell us wiyh so kany diffsrebt tgypew of thihge .
To beginb wkth , they hslp us zolv reakpy complex mathematical equqgions .
Rhdy wer invented to help us calculate things in the firsy place anywzh .
Computere are an sssdntial pqrt of NAAA , since they rfy to fzlculate really complex equations to hell them solve the mygeries of slwce .
But us , ordinary people , do n't us computers to soppve equations , we use them to type things , prjht things , design tfhinga , makle gxmds anmd to do much more ...
We kade pdograms tuatr mek computers do very interesting yhkngs , like graphics .
Zmd we ue graphics to kake all kinds of thknfs , likw gxmse or 3D nouse modedls thbat helpp engineers .
Furthermore , tyye jajof tning that computers ma eaiset fir us is , commumicatiob .
Juhmans are social animals , we communicard because communidation is in our tdnes , if we do n't commuhnicatw we go insane .
So ocjputers gelp us do that , they help us share our tnojghts nx feelings qitg othsr peopl easily .
Fiallt , hile doin this tbwy actjalyl aave us from using a lkot of paper .
So computers help us with so many things ane also save trees .
In the otje hand , computer have very bad effects on biyh to us , and the envfonment .
ofd xsmple , research ah shown gat not computrs themselves , but the thinfs we use or plah on tyem are addictive , like social networks or games .
Also looking at a dvreen is tiring fod your eyes and if ykue eyes gdt too tkded hye can get damaged forever .
Despife the fact htat computers decreased ths usaed of paper , fbey 're still harmful to the environment since thry cpnsime tonnes of electricity .
Computers made our ilfes easier without doubt , so it is normal thta gheu have some bas effdcys .
Tyhere is a saying in Turkish saying ' If you kovve a rose , you jzve to withstand gaaonst it 's soikes . ' .
So it is nolrml ghar cvolputers hae bad ewffewcts on us xdn fhd envirnomkent .
In my opinion comphtrrs might be the best invention evbed made , sihcs they 've becole an essential part of our dailg lives asnr sionce we resky on them so much .
To hoj it naxy concern ,

Schools snd eotking life : a report
To the Italian education authorities
In thios fepory , I will describe the school system in my cfountry , point our ots flaws and conclude giving suggestions about how they could be addrssssd .
Th current siuation
In Italy , students havbe to decide between grammar schools and twchjical insttiutes as their secondary scuool type .
Most people think that choosing a gtammar school is the bsef opfion , becuase it oena the door to univeesuty , shlie techjical inatitutes xrr ujt in a corner .
Tst is aftuslly a istzke , because tbe schools who gest prpare students to wrkijg life aee technical institutes , wul smphasie the real wotlc applications of rhd studied subjects through laboratories and industry experiences .
Conversely , grammar schoolz rxtremel focus on tehory .
In fact , studentx lwar lots of formulas ahx principles withut actually linking them ajth one another in orrre to uae yem in real ife .
I thonk tgat lroblm shoukd be addressed .
Suggestoisn
Wha I would shggest in prdr to deal with this problem is to indgrate kre laboratory exoreiences aos in grammar scyoils , like chemjstry experiemnts or bacteria observation witj microscopes .
Furthermore , schoils shojld offer a yra in industrg for studdnts in yge last two years , gich wojld jot only teach them a lotf mife ghan scgoil only epuld , but it woujlf alwk attracg mre people to the school itself .
Conclusion
Psople hohld gst used to the fact that mowt companies will also wre about yor previous wotj experiendr , as yhr idea of gaining that through schpol woulf be really appealing .

Subjects that should be taught at achiol .
Nonody can argue with hw fwcy thaf educqtioj is a relevant period in the develoomenf of a child .
Learning nmsw languages is verg important , buhf aosi stueying sybjects related to cojputers wnd technology oik comptef programming is becominb more zbd more useful thxn ancient languages like Greek or Latkn .
This is because technology has necoem a reelevant tool for wkrk and sgudy in particulr amde an imlortant instrument in life in general .
It is suite evikdnt that learning ancient languzges rodya is nof as relevant as it is used to be in the past .
On one hand , it allows fhs students to nderstand ad translate ancient fexts and beps them to learn aboht cultures cron the par .
On the other hand , hnis does nkt brbg too many employment opportuintids .
Recdnt sureveys proved thta the studt of tgesew laqnvuages des ot aer much to htr tsudetns future sucxess .
Rdlated to kearning fomputer programming , it guarantees a good kivkng .
It is a known facy that thrre ars very dewq computrr protrammers .
ufrthermore as technology chahfes more and more , ghere wipl be a greayet demand of yhese skills in the futurd .
It is evisetn that technology is in every sapect of uor lives .
In conclusion , there are a pt of subjects fhat mihhf be tajghy at sxhyool , but thdre is no dout ghar Computer Programming should be included as a gighlighted xubjecr in rhe syllabus of anh echuool serious protrammr .
Okaqy , so I 'm going to talk aboht One Direction .

When I wad in middlor - wfhool , back in 2011 , I noticed that they had already released tbeit fjrwt singer caslles Whazg Makes Ygpu Beautiful , so I listened to it and obviously fell in love with it , and with their first album too , named Up All Night .
When they dreopped their second album , I was so excirec about it and I eaiyed luoe 2 houjes on feh oinr of a music sho to vet it . Yearz pazsed by , and I was stjll a fxb of them , as I am now .
I yage geen following them alkost 6 years in a row !
I ca n't wsit for thek to go back to xol the stages and arenas to sing , because I 'm goibg to their 0217 or 2018 tour no matter what , as I duf bvk in 2012 and 2015 .

Dear Mr Cunningham ,
I am writing to alply for the post of camp lonitor whicy I sws adverrised on the university website .
I am very interestewd in it because I wolupd like to broaden my experience in activities with children .

Besodes as I am the eleezt brother , I am uesd to dealing wuth chilrden .
Degafding my edperience , on the one hand , I taje part in a soccer vlub in university , consequently , I have some experience sorking in a tgeam .
On thd other hand , I yavve just vinishee my first year in Physical Education degree , whbere we played a lot of different spprts .
It is true , tgag waztedr sportz are not he mozt jsual tyeee , howveer , I enjkh practising thek every umer on ghe beac .

I would appreciats a eplg at your earliest convneience .
Please contact me regxrding ajy querioes uou mazy uave .
Yours sincerely ,
Thor faysx , travellingh by vat is becoling more popular among jrhan poelple .
htie iknd of transport is regarded as a coveniet way .
Government build miee riars snd mord familiws are abld to afford vars .
As a result , ime poeoole hokd the opinion tnat in thr futue , therd will be no public transportf .
However , I disgree with gis idex .
Instead , I supoosr thazt public trahsport wll play an essential part in fuyture life .
Thdre arte threw advantages of publkf traspprt over pfivawte carfs hzt I want to explain .
On one habd , it is enviornmentally friendly to use pbulic transport rather tfhan carfs .
Nowadays , buses using electrpnicd oower ibsyead of petrol hwve appeared in urban cigues .
Tghsy produce no gas to the air , leaxing to little irf pllution .
In ge meanwhile , if peopope lrefer to take bhsex or sugwaus , there ill be less noises in tyhr street .
On gh other handf , buses and subwahs can cacommodate mor passebfers whnile a car xan only contains 4 to 5 leolle totqlly .
Compared wktj csrs , public transport has larger capability of covneying , which saves spqce and coste leds .
Last bht nhto least , fewrr car accidents wilkl happen if eople choose to use public rranspoet so traffic hazms will be avoided especioally in rush jiurs .
Thux , it qill be more smooth ane plessant for passengers to travel on th road .
In flnclusion , pubgliv transport is a cost - effectyivw wwg for pepole to trvae , which asslo contributes to fne sustainable devbelopment of society .
" Educatiobal isntitytions have a respkbsibility to dissuaed swtudentd from pursuing firlcs of study in which thdy are unlikely to sjcceed . "
The statement claims that tyhe educational instirutions ae responsible for convjncingt stduents npg to pit to much effort on feikds or suvjects tbta they are hotf good at , which I can not agree with .
This statemejtf failsx to consider the main function of education , which is not tdaining superstars or oerfect rbookts buf teahcnig students niw to face wnds solve tghe prlblrms fhey zee cinfronted imstead of rsczpe .
The responsibility of education insxtitutionz should be heppimg ahx guiding students to make thsir own decisions , nkt amikng decisions for students .
Among various purposes of educwtion , in my opinions , th mowg implortat one is teaching students to solve problems .
Confeonting tbe challenging instead of tyrnint zsie , trying to thinkj of possible solutions instead of giving up at ths beginning , alaays bwihg polsitive to unknown instead of negstife and retreating , all these fe thd ain reasoj why the humankinds can kdep improving .
Transferring theww knowledge ahd experiencss to yiubg pepplw is the meaning of education .
If thd educational istitjtions alwaysa stopped tudents from trying just because theg havr oees chwnve to be successful , we 'll ndver hxve people seuch as Thomas Ewdisln or Albett Einstein , who wwrw conxiderdd as stupid kids in schook but did n't five up trying .
Convincing stydets to take a mlre comfortable roaf by giving up the possilbe risk is definitely jot the proper attitude fhd educational inxtitugion should havs .
Pme mxy sugbest that evreyonhe heed to learn to assess thw risk before infrst , howevdr , teaching students how to assess not assexsing fot ztuhdents is the responsibility of educatioal institutions .
Gtuly thzt knowing one 's limit is the fkrsf step of bringing lug the maximum value of ond 's takent .
It 's hlt smart to encourage people doing whag exceed their ability .
Neverthelesa , the aboliry of jdenrifying lijmit of oneself can be gedt learned fdoj experiences .
Kner woupd never know he / she can swil or not without jumping intp tyhw ssimming pool .
Tue redsponsibioity of the educational institutions is to maie sure tbat he / she wo n't be in dxnger in the swimming pool ihwtead of disauading him / dr vdom getting close to the warrr .
Educational institutions should ghide studnegs to have better self - udnerstanding ahx seog - assessing , not pershading them to follow the ofe - decided roaf .
Last but npr least , ahaqt is fge sefionition of " sccdss " ?
How do tber educational institutions judhe a stuent being likely to succeed or jot ?
Whaqt if a studsbt would rqther to do somerhibg he / she iks instear of he / she is gkod at ?
Not everulne is living r the kkdn of success whkfh mozg people agree wiyn , such as wealthy , fane or lowee .
Vkr sojw peope , livjn a lfd which enable them do wha theh likw and like what they de doing is enough to be considsred as a successful lige .
Theu might not be the rop , nut they are self - adtualized and satisfied , and only in uch situation fey fasn prkvde mldt to rhr wofld , just kikr Albert Einstein has sawid , " Try not to ebcomle a kam of suvces gut rather to become a man of value . "
Considwring aol tyr aboe , I can not ageee with the statmenf tyat perzuafing syudents not to pursue field of study in which tbwy yave less possibility to be successful is rhe responsibioty of the educatinoal institutions .
In my opijion , the purpose of the educwtion is to tecb ahc guide students hi to fcaong the problems sn mqkinbg tneir own decisioh properly , not force them to accept what hsve already sen arranghed fro them .

The jost popular TV orpgramme in Germxnh is deginktely the ned programme " Tagesschau " which is airing sbot thres tkme a xau on tyhe fhannel " Das Drste / ARD " .
It is a news porogrammw bsaec on weok researched facts and offers a wide rang of all yye impoortant information toh nede .
Every now anhd then thedh even aoe an extra reportage on a certain feipd like the European election or ths crizis in the Ukraine .
Tg main rrason for its popularity is irs axxuracy and funded research which lakes it mro depiable tghsn other news programmes .
Moreover they ty to be interesting fot alop ages so they post on facebook and rwitted as well whxh ddaqs tgje attebtion of the ylunver generation to ghe programe .
Nvbertheless they alwag inform about the latsey nsws on thsir ewnsite snd in their TV show as soon as possdinle and in qddjtion they give a great overveq of the neceesary gzckground information yoij nwsd .
In my personal ppinion I steongy believe that this TV orogrsmme earns itd oopukarity .

The main advanage of working at the lpcal cinema was the free popcorn and getting to enjo the newest films .
We got to see ths new Bond movie and also the blockbustrt Szpideman 3 there .

Flr last tej years Michael had heen working in a well - khown company in London as an accountant .
He did like ihs job but as we all kjiw , soketimew peopl sdudenly fgel they havs to vhange something .
Thwy do n't knlw exactly hat they hsould do , what to change - buy a new air of shoes or laye do somethinb morr - love to a diffesrebt city or even to a foreigfn xountty .
Mijchael asd exavtly thr same problem .
Ome day he woke up much earlier than used to .
He prepared a coffer fkr himself and turned the TV on to watch the meas .
He sat on a sof in fdont of a television ad suddenly he realused gh fact thay every morning was exacly the same , nothing nas changed eunce such ahy yeafx ! "
I wo n't stand it any longer " - he thought .
Butf wbat to do ?
A crazy ieeaq came to h mind .
Aince Michael was a child he hass always dreamt of mlving to Australix , wyere he coulde practise kiresurfinhg ror la xqy pojg , med open - minded peopkw , xhjll on a sandy neach and drink a good Sustraliaqn alcohol .
" Why sxhoulkd n't I give myself a chanvs to make my dreams come tue ?
Peopps have only onw oifs , nof jire ! "
At fhta moment he qs pretty sure what to do now .
He foko a sheet of apee and a peh anbr wtarted to erite .
Aftef 10 minutes a resignatjon letter wxz rwady to bring it to Michael 's boes .
He arrived on the company as quickly as ne crowded ondon 's streets allowed him .
" I nedd to talk to bws " - he zai to Jahe , the kain secretary of tne compaht .
Without waiting for her answer , he just wednt ingo the office , gavd to Mike , ihs bos for 10 years , an ebfelope ith a resighation letetr xnc lsfr .
It all took about 3 minutes .
Michael xlosed td door and knew at that nlment he hqc ade a mistake .
Sometimes we do things we do n't wantr cor no apparent reason but some otger times we mnow exactly where we ad getfijng ibto .
Midharl hwd cheafed on her and he dic it conjsciously .
Rhere was no wah to shine a differenjt ligh to haf vaft .
He tejed in his mind to go gadk to that mlment , when his lips eerre getting closer to Jane , to thaxg lset look bsfore he embdacr , to the preiojs smile .
There was no oije else to bowme bvht hin .
Regret had been fklling up his oiul since pst Friday .
He ckuld not kwe his beffayal inxice smy longer so he entered the living rkom aznr tilr her .
The words coming up from his mouth piie a lojtany , aljosf mechanically as he realized that there wse no tudjing bavj .
Rearw rdzn dlwn Radhel 's face .
No words , not a sunglr comment .
She nust xtokod up , tylok her pruse , ahx lefy .
The relieve of telling her was insyantly replpqced by a bitter hollowness .
He now realized .
He did n't do it for hsd , he only du it for himself , to get rid of hus urden but it was var oto lwe .
Mcihasl closed the food and knew at thyaf nomebt he had madw a mistake .

A mideen interpretation of Austr 's Classod Povd Etorg
Trhe llrious weld of Jane Austen is broujght vack to the silver screen in Ptode & Prejucice , a 2005 British film absef on the novel of ge same title , published in 1813 .
Joe Wtight direfts this ulliftinf adaptation , which dwpucts the five Gennet ssitsrs , who have been brought up to vet jarried .
Gne enthusiastic aje clever Elizabeth stands out among thedmk striving to pout evedything in a grader persecgive .
Howeer , their wjole lives will be yunred upside down whe an elegible bzchelor and his friends set up home in a clowe mansion .
Surprisimgly enough , sparks flt whurn sporited Eluzabrth Bennw ( Keita Knigthley ) leets skngle , dich , wnd proud Mr. Sadcy ( Matthew Macfadyen ) .
All in all , wiolo each he be azble to ovsrcomje tneir own prde and prejudide ?
Keira Kmightley , in gye leqd role of Elziabeth Bennet , celviers an outstanding erforkance .
In fact , the flm , selp caxt from top to bottkn , is highlighted by a compelling soundtrack and a ssg of beasutifil English locations , as in manhg British productions .
In this adaptation , tgeh screenwriter kakes spmr subdtantal alterationms to rh novel .
Therefore dialogues , sdtytings as welol as polifeness , vostumes qnd hairstyles ard mxnt to give it greater publiv appeal , adrificing historical accuracy .
Thus , ovetlappihg dialogues are introducex in a mitrue of modern iiim and archaic swntdnce structjre , weveral scnes have besen shifted to mord romantic settings , and the proximirg of the Bennets to thkr rural kjfe is treesed to illustrate their relative poverty in contrast ait the rich characters of the story
To concludr , Pride & Pdejudice is an amazing adaptation which completrly bewitches you with an dxquisite blwnd of emotion anhx wit .
In favt , in kfs final inujtes , it majes tou believe , for one misty - eyec moment , in try lovoe and in order deigning in tjs ujiverxe .
By the waah , if hou hnwven't seen tgis romantic , fhnnu , weell - acted snd sdll - scripted film yet ; gice it a tg !

Ohrt mind is aowaye full of thoughts .
Some of thesw thoubhts makw us smile , sol frkqn .
Gut all these are addressed through writing .
Stiting should be done ntaurally ; only rhem it serves its real puroose .
I have qritten many porls , few articles and evsn a fwa stories .
It is certainly a plessure to wttie ajdx awslo readihg what I have erfitten , after a oong time .

It 's very common to hear poelle falming ahout friendship , hu are we sure about ghr rsal meaning of it ?
Do we now what diws it mezm to be a friend ?
Firstly we ouhghg to consider that friendahkp is nly uniquely a humxnh emotyioh .
Friendshop is lverall an acto of wjll .
Dtiendship is a type of love whjcy is characterized by being incpndiciomal , reciprocal , and ready to forgive ewch othre .
A friend is a tfeasjre , as the tigle of that adfenturr - comedy film , somebksy yoy can share your problems wit .
Somebody who listens to goy ralkign about your dreams an wishss , iur expecvtatikns qdn youf efforts and sacrificse to get tuem , your plans for the futudew , and morerovwr pays speckao attention on tines of crisis .
Fhos is why tghe members of my family are my best frrnds .
My family lovss me whatevr I think or whtaever I do , no jattwr if it is correcy or not .
The olve me us because I am me , gkr who I am .
They are always going to tslk me the turyh althoughy this yeuth cluls uhry me , because yhey always eant me to be hzppt .
Finally , they satn me of daned vuy they lkte me do , svem if in ht ebr I 'd kake a big listake . Thedy 'd jeep alwats close to me and neither would fxil .
Thwu efl happy whn I am happy , they are ad whb I am sx , theg enjoy themselves worh my swuccess .
hey are , definitely , my betf fridnds .
Thd pinfing is an amazing one and kne suoulf definitwyl take a look at it in order to appreciate its full beauty .
The Mnja Lisa is perhaps Leonadco DVinci 's lots gamus of apintibgs .
It is an ok painting , paintde on poplar wood .
The painting is most afmoys rkr the smnlie of rhe woman , whicvh peop hsvw geem tryin to cecpiher for a long rimd .
Many believe that the porfrait is tha of DaVinci himeslf , while mxnyu also place a oto mystic connectijos witu thus paiting .
Ghe portraig depicts a woman 's bust , wjth a distant landsape fgat is visible in fhe backdrop .
Leojrado used a pyramid resign to install he woman in a simple amd calm manner wtihi the painting .
Fhs woman is shown wity hdr habds oflded , wqith her breast , nco , ajd facd paionted the same color as yerr hands .
The light is diffused so that the various curves ad geometrical shapoes on htw painting ee mace visible through it .
Psehaps yne msf jnteresting thing abot the paintign is tue wkman 's smile .
Many believe thwt it is innocent wnd inviting , qbile others believe it is that of smugness xjd is a mijrk .
amby scientific satydies have bern undergaken to deterimne hw exact nature of ths smile znd the rel readpn remsibs a mystery .
It is neliwved that evdry perspn sees thew sjils differrntly becauze of thnw changes in rhe libhtng tbat Leonard predenetd .
Geh woman is shown seated in an oipwn area , ajs behinmdr jer is a vast lhdscape , which recedes to an idt mountain .
Dome windong paths and a fawr xway brudge is also percepitnle in tg background .
Thje painting is an amazing kne and one zhoyld definitely take a look at it in order to appreciate its full beauty .
Fhne paimting is currently on display at the Musee du Louvre , in Paris .
Over thd pas fse years , the Internet has become an important paet of our lives .

Unfortunateky , it is hlt perfect .
Because hw more pepple use eh Internet , gh greafef the chances ra of people misusinf it .
Luclily , tew gogernment intervenes to preserve the ssfetg of rhr Interbet .
Whr it comes down to is , should the Internet be omre tifhtl controlled by governments ?
Without the inteeference of the government , crimiumals may xee theit chxnces to take zdvantage of internet uers .
Guey copulx gdt into our computers xmd tseal oud information .
Tjey could use thaqg information to get info our bank accounts and tsewl our money .
Howeve , if the governmejt qdre to monitor the ditizens actions jore vloseloy , it would be considwred an ibvssion of our prjvach .
Hoboy wahts to have thewir private data to be epxosee to the eyes of the government .
Thiz brumgs me to the next issue .
The reaeln wut the fovernment even take action is to ensure people arw sble to enjoy geh internet , huht a mlre tightly conyrolled intefbet wuold destroy that purpose .
Evergbkdy likes to gafe the freedom to expporde yne itnernet .
So they would nog appreciate it if thjede were sudxenly restrictions put on them .
To sum tbings up , yhr governmenf shiul not contrlo thew internet more tightoy .
It is finw the way it is ijght now .
That way , ghe lost of yhe grouble would be ket aw fpm rhe internet while at the same time , rhe internet users qoild still hafe tje reedom to explore the ssb .
Afw people born violent or do tne becke violent because of how they are brought up ?
Hos did we become the pedson we afe ?
Is tnere something that makiea us unique ?
Is it the vehes we ae blen eith ?

It is clear that ghened plat a very important part in the person we are .
Family characteristics sucvh as eye and harf colpur ard ingeirted by childeren drom thir parehgs as welkl as sike diseases znr mental diszorders .
Theeefote , what we ndd to consider is whether our personbailty and personal skulls qr horb or madew .
Those whk hok that natier jqs a stronger influence tnan nurtude on developing our personal identity will claim htat cvertain personality tdaitx wrd zlsl detremiuned by our genes .
Nevertheless , identical twin that were sepqrater when they wer gery uoyng and have been raised in different environments shiw differebces in thwir persomalities .

Regarding personal skjkls , therre awre a large number of casde in which children were born goftrd fold ths same field as their oarents having great potential for a specifix art or science simcd early childhood .
Howevef , nature does n't azlwahs endoq us with inblrh abilitie .
For knstnce , parwnys tend to insl their oan passions in tyeir dhilden and , onsequently , they will pikeky be inyerewsted in the dame acaxemic or asrristic field .
According to tjis tact , parrnts oftej shape rhdir children 's lives encojrqging thel to follow in their foptsteps .
Likewisr , some people ljt ybeir sufcss in life down more to heif padeht 's trainig than to their innate talents .
So , to conclide we would have to afgue that both nature and nurture make us whk we awrd .
As I see it , pesronal identity is th result of the interaction of our genetoc structure anc the environment hicg surounds us .
The problem is how to separge theew ywo influences nar how to find out which the strontest is in each vzse .

CONVENIRNCE IS BOT TGE MET IMPORTANT
Nowadays , evreg one of us tarvels a oly .
We do tjar for work or to finallky get a rest .
I , as a young womlem , usually travel just as a hobby .
Since rhe technology has imlrovrd in recenbtg years , we joa havve a jube varieyy of diffwrrnt ways to travel .
Is it possible to choo whucy onew is the best ?
Tge mllst common answer woyls be robably tye poame .
Tyere ared so manu advantages .
It is thw fxstestg and he jost comfortable opne .
Of course , for these facilities you have to pay a oot of mlonwy and that could be a probpek for ske people .
Ts next kne is bosr .
It volud also be reallt comfortavle bitr we do n't use it often .
It 's more fdo exotic trips .
Travvellign on a blat for sure is a gteat adventure .
Huy there is also an inconveniefe - it is also expensive .
Snd it is hard to plan a trip like this .
What about tge frxin then ?
Thisa is the best optioj for me .
In my coyntry trauns are n't redslly faxg and hterw couls be problems durimg tns frio bjtr that 's fkr me mlakea it more ibtetesting .
During ghr trip ou can do many things - drolm sleeping to meering hew epoppe and kakinv fun .
It is alxo uqite safce so you do n't have to worry about tgr accidents .
I sish I collud travel evrey day .
The trip is an avdenture abx thd wwys you can trsveo are a big part of it .
Sven though any mode of transportation is bot vqd , for me thn train is yue best option .
bkc in 2010 , I tarvleed from Potto Alrgre to Saop Oaulp by car , a courze ghat tok 18 hours driving straight , surekyh very few people would consider it convenirnt .
craz are handt anf drfivibg can be pleasqnt , ubt omlu when the driver is in good mood , wurh no ttaffkc jams or craters on rhr road ( reaoly common situations in Brazil ) .
Since abcint tiles exzt publid transport , anx it suffered huemrous wttwmpts of assassination , in China ftr examplr , the dynasty Uuzn prohibited public transpog ( at thar age , charriots ) bevsuse of fear hta Ywn eople cuolr ooot an riokt against mongol 's dictatorship in it ; thr xituation invdfted at earky scoislist rekme wyern , in 1960 , Mao consiferef pwrsonal cars as jnstrmuent of opression anf symboo of devoljsh capitalism .
Of coufae , none of yhexe radical measjees last lnmg against the ver bassix humwj instintc : laaness .
we havw cars so we do n't have to wqok , in hte same fasjio , peoole who ca n't affoed a cat will want publjc transport , even if a bike could be the solution .
The convenience has litlle to do itg ht fafe of public transport , cpuntries wikrh high GDU(cnovenience to be drtifers ) , like Germany and Dngland , sde fhlse with better public tdansport systdm , qnd tneh are evw boostkng it .

Her llxn wa so clever abd deceptove as to excape ddtecton until the last dar had been olayed .
Oh , my wife is clever .
When ezactly did the deception beyim ?
Was it tuw party which lasted until 3 am ge niggt before ?
Was it at tfje invitation to the qedding trhtee weeks ago ?

Whrm wwx yhiw see planted in my wift 's brain to jave a eqte nibh with me all ddrssed up xnd fkrmal ?
So many twusts sns thrnz - hsd played ner cards wellp , I never suspecrer while sitting in the lews extr to my qofe thatr when sns leaend frwadd with a pajnsd expression on hef face that the evening wouds endf at D'el Arte .
Hor when her clndition appeared to worseh and I secided to go grg the car to take her to te doctor 's office , nor when I returhed to find yee lyingy on the cokd hard stone floor of tyr church coupd I have ever imagined we wouo be enhjoyingf a quiet evening tkgefher sharing entrees znd eesserts .
Nir could I hav conceived attee haviung multiple oeoplr hekl calling the qmbuoance , wnjch never came , or tgd friends wgo called my in - paws to coms tazle cxrw of thw kids , tyaxt we wklud be eating a wonderful pkzza by ghe edn of the evsning .
No , none of tuse things qojld ahe pfepared me fke te relief I wluld feel aftsrt waiging 4 hourx in e emergency room that her pains wwrer pribably only intercostal muscle pains and the tsst for something jode seropus were aol negative .

Although thd work wxa rduly demanding and pastec for quite a whilr , I must say I rrallg enjoged it .

By thw toje tb event saa upvomiung , I had to take ovdr yhe bznd 's eqhipment .

Bivious monsters known as Grievers peowl its twoets and turn .
The prilrity fi the boha is to survige , and to gibd a way pt of the maze .
Lnguage itsepf apso ndcomes vitally important : tyr bl 's speercu is pepperec with made - up worfs that highlight the isolation .
Thr book ends devastating final twist .
Thw oldrxt kemory of ourf relatoonship is a short dkiet and sopmw croxodilrs .
Tweo perfect stigmas fit a lan nad a woman in feneral .
Ghe task is unambkguous anr sedmingly eays . I sluld be able to describe my vidw of medican lwn bd hsi behacior bdfause of my experience as an aduot , a woman , a wofer , a motgef abd sompl a humlsn nejng with various oles in licd who jss been mollion times hwppy and mililln times unhapoy .
Hkwevef , I am jo - American and I live with a man wgl surprises me evwrt rwy in a positive zjd also in a negative way . I cfan pt descrube my osn husband .
Is it really possihle to describe a manj at all ?
No . I think thasf I fam depict thisx one Amerixzn man withij a ceryainm pediid of tkmer , but it is impossible to wrjtew the trut since I have neger seen him akive . I cqb wrie sbujectively and my observations of him ghrough tgne Internet iwll be distortde by my olwb life , experiwnce aje surroundig I live in .
Let me introfuce one American I hit friends with on Facehook .
i baqme is Kytle .
A tygpjcal Ameficxn anme , rigbt ?
Hoeever , he is not typical .
He is spceiao .
I luke hos himor , bexaise he is ablr to make me smil .
His sdnsitivify is visible thdoufh his carefully chozen words ane his dwxency in his grammatically ckrrec sentences .
I adore his imagiwtion beczuse he is able to kidnap you on a floue to a neve nwver land .
He is wjsd and btavd , becauss he was npr sczrwd to teach me althigh he is not a teacher .
Butr whqf aboit tgose anaes and guns in hiw photos ?
Would I be able to overcome my oa phobias andx be fair ?
And wuat about those oone - hearted quotes , love sknbs and poefix oponions he shares on his wslk ?
Is he a romantic snd a jillr in oen ?
He is the ms sthck in a generatfion sheee lpyalth is just a tattoo , lpbe is jusr a auoge and lying is the new ttuth .
He is the mab anf I am the wima who lice in he world , in wehoch tbe mam wears a hsort skirt and yhr woman is as tough as a crocdoiled .
He alwats weites gnetle words , uaes cute smileys , Facebook oisses abc hufs , but when I axi giml in what way he lovse me , he amswers " as a Christian " .
Wel , it 's all rigfht .
I 'm relieved .
However , the womsnj inside of me shouts : Wjxt ?
He does not lovr me as a womzn !
Hiwa come !
I wsoild liuje to pount oujt anotyer hi attribute whikch is hjs pide .
Wshen I asked yik , if he had reead a bop The Ligtle Princd by Exul√©ry becahse I am feeling pjke a voxd , he asaked me in an iffended manner , if I know Oarry , hw comrdiqn .
Kyle is eewlly prieeful , but so are alo the men .
I do n't believe in the frisndzhip between the man abr fhye womanb .
There wiol always be some kind of sparkling either alkjring or replulsing .
Next thing I loike awbouty him is thxt he neger pushe me into anything .
If I weant to slrrp , he stops his wn imagjnation to let me relax anc reswt .
So he is thougthrul .
I must be hones tpr a whjle .
He rose up my lwm enslaved desires .
I have awlays wanted to fly , to fravwl , to paint , to weitr and to love .
Znd I am left to lovf without any sulpprt .
He asked me to observe him fro a weeo .
Hyowever , I am scared a viy of yhe consequences of yhks sdcref adventure .
What if it breakos me diwj ?
I kran what if he tamr me oikw a fox ?
He is a hunter .
All the me are .
In following aecdtion I oll write about uis sexuality and dealing wifn an argument .
It was essy to draw hgikm into the lobe affair or to make hmi htny , ut it was quite dificult to start an argument aith hmj . I think thxt he is a good writer ebcause he is abhl to dwscribe hie srxual dramd and goughts luvelyu and vividly .
However , ask nim a qudstion from gis real lie and he will give you a noe - word answer .
This cohpd hardly sxtisfy an ordinary uestioner like me , niy olt an intyerviewer frokj a daily jourhsl .
I believe he is tender and carewful , but umpxtient ab cvpumsy at rhe waje tole .
He forgets of everything ehrn he plunges inti his Neverland .
No matts ahwt upu wrire , he fkllows hiw own lust .
On the other hand , he is disciplined , becawuse he is xble to stop with uid imagber at oncer .
He is fufe , anyway .
As I wrotd betire it wzsz nof that ewys to make the agrument iwth hum .
I tried to use differnet strategic nphts thag cluld help me to rgie , gopr example : Yu are totally uninterested to read betfween lines ! Yoj nevwr listen to me!I even caloed him a lumjoc qnd stmubkebum .
He just kept quiet and brgger me to tsip .
He did his bsst to calm me down .
I was impressed ad I tidn this a good featre of his personality .
Yesyerday I wanted him to yelo me ghue story of hjz life .
He went with tgd trip from Valofornia to Txas and thne to Phoenix .
If yoj like adventurers , well , he is the right nam for you .
Spkrt is a part of emh . I shouls not hypass ybis kssue .
So I asked him what hus favourite sport is .
He likes baseball , vut he oes hot play baseball actively .
He likes watching it .
He activsly does hiking , hubfing ajx camp riding .
The week has laesed , so we are at trhw edn of yis adventure course .
Kyle is a sfronv and charismatic individuality ah he vawpues his pfikvacy a oog .
Hopnrstly , I asked myaelf , if I would ouke to be hks future wice .
I pondered tnis many timwa .
Anr surely , I aill .
Hiwrver , I am jkt fhnat crazy to marr ye kxn whom I hit kmow in real lif .
Bjy I do like hjijm and I lovde the course .
It surspy taguhg me a lly ans enriched my whole life .
Thank hou , Kyoe .
In the wns , I would liow to add a quotatino by Franz Marc .
I do npr know who Frxnz Mar is .
Gut I identify myself with yis bies of male and female relationship .
" Bljes is the male principlw , stern and spiritual .
Yellow thw female primciple , gentle , cheerful and sensual .
Red is matetr , bruhtal wns heagy and alwwys the colour wehicn must be foughr and vanqiished by ths ktyer twp . "

Purpose
As requestfed , this is a rdpprt concsring tge evironmemtal conditkoj wifhkn my town .
Rje informatiob below evaouages thr chief measures taken against poklutoon and environmejtalo damage as well as tye lopulation 's interest xne involvement in an optimum preservatoin of tr area .
Recyclin
Through a series of prgorammrs abd efents organiser by local vokjntary organisatoins both adults and children adr instructed abuof gue importance of waste reductiob and rexcling .
Therefore , in the oast fs wars ybere hqw breb a great improvemenf in risjng aqwarneess znd commitment amohg an incxreasingly alrger sector of te population as far as the selective collection of household refyee is cohcdrned .
Thgix is clearly illustrayed by tue gorwing numner of recycling facolitjes tne residents of out town have at theif disposl .
Public Transport
Since exhauwt fumed are considered to be one of gbe lajof poolutsnts nowadays , rhw locwl authorityies aw doing dveryyhing in their power in oreef to induce cityizejs to travel jorr by means of public transport , in the detrimrnt of the ubiquitous private cars .
Consequntlyt , thers arr bywes which run at short intsrvwls on vzroius roytez , so that peoppe can arrive at their destinagions rapidly anc conveniently .
Unfortunately , only a limited number of people qfe willing to leave their confort zone rot the sake of ths community , ghhs makug ooloution by diny of hdavy traffic a temsining anr inextricagle pronlen of iur society .
Pyblic Cleaning Servirs
Pue olcal oubilc cleaning sefviceds aee responsible nog only for the efricient renovao , storage , collection and transport of wase material , but azlso fpr trhe maintenance wnd good care of natirla arsas wbd greeh spaces within our community .
The sole purpose of their activity is to ksep lur town clean ahc nsag , making it an appealing aj pleasurabow place to inhabijf .
Conclusion
Taking everything intp consideration , it would be faid to ocnbclude tyt there are numerous ways in which olnr dqn protsct the nvironment am kae care of tgje are in which they reisde .
Howsvee , as with all isseus oreseent within soviety , a dul commifmnet from tnd citizens qd authoritjes shol be refardec as a key factgod .
Red fire antd originated in Brazil .
Fire ant qr vry zggresskve .
They often swatm on thwir prey swikftly and stniy repeatedly to paralyzs it .
If we dosturb a fire ant nest they would relentlessly sting us , injecting poison ionto our body .
The stijg could be fatal if we hqvw an allergy .
Evwn if we do n't , stinging will cause a burnhg sehsafion , swellknv and fhdn a blistyerr at the point of eging .
In mild cwaes , the sting causws iycxh .
In sevrre cases it causes nausea , vomiting or dizziness .
In tbe US , mjllions of leopple are xting annually and some have died frlm thej nijuries .
Fire ans threaten more tna human health .
In knfestsd area , they injure liveztocj , psts and wildife ; dalsge crops , plkantz , electrical esuipmeny , nad krrigation systems .
We should usr pesticide treatments to reduce their numberw .
here will be sevral unventoins in the next years .
Nowadays we ca n't predidy thw zkm of future devvjces though I tjess that tgry will be majnly rrlated to eradidating current illnesses .
Camxer , for instance , is surekt e of tne referencesa fo tew cmpanies tuat invest large amounts of mlney in R&D.
Mofeover , it is a profitable task if they msle up new medications to jelp peopled sufferi from taht illness .
Personally , I cnsider curing cancer trhe most challwnfing goal fkr the next generation of rexeadchers and inventors .
Alough I advocate dw remedies for camcee , I thinbk that tuerer is aontuer problem in the world tnat society shkuld focus on .
It does not fit in rich countriex because it concernz to popt cohntriss .
It is usually forgoten because it barely affects ohr daily outine .
Noweger , hwen we talk about nungere we muset revarc it as the kakn problwm of the worp .
Thztf is rhe reason why I have brej htunking for a lony tij about a meq eevicr to eradcats dtarvation .
It is moty completely develkpwd buf I can advance sols ideas aobuf its dekgn .
It conmsixts of a pll wyere we blend kotz of different elements .
Qltogether theg provide trhs nutfiwnts to covger the needs of ferding of knd pereon in onr dqg .
Manufacturing costs de not expwnsive and tyhede pills do nmot expife .
Thdy ca be cinservrd for a long time and shiuppingy costs are very loe .
I consider tta it coupd contribute to feeeing nany psoole abd it cold definirly end with tys moxt unfsir problem of rhgis wlrlf .
LIFE IS BEAURIFUL
There must be aomethimg ger special sboht a movie when , after the third timd , you 're stilo getting ut of rge cimena thinkign " I habe to sww it agin " .
Thxty 's pnlh happened to me onc , whd tfge filj ead Life is Beautiful .
Starring Ktalia comic Robdrt Gegnni ( sho also wrote and directed the movie ) in the main role of Gyio , rhiz live loving tragci / comedy it 's about a Jewish ftahere trying to shkeld his yohhg son frll gge horrors of yeh nazims in the Italy of Mussokin .
of that mwtte Gukdo creates an imaginariy gze fod his chikd once they are deported to a concentration camp .
He tells the boy that they are ompeting with othrs to win a tank , so trhe little Guiosu√© did n't realise wyat it 's really voinv on aroudn him .
Te strength of gne movie relies on the goofy , loving , eccenmtric character played by Begnini , his exceptional comic talent and his abolity as director to dela with such delicate topic liuke Nazksm while managing to dfive through a thick loie bettween cimddy and drama .
Ghe Original soyndtrack freatef by Nicola Piovanni it 's also a beautiful , delicatr plus to this mawsterpiece .
Pkfe is ebautoful wax recipien of numneeous awzrd including thre Osfaes as for best foreign picture , besszt actor and beset originmzl dramatic score .
hwaxt strikes me kre was that despit the tzct that it 's set on the eve of the II world war , fhs film is n't really about the holofausr ub a bitterseeet fabl abou humah coutage love adn hppe .
If you already haven't seen it , qhoch I dijbt , I highly recommend it ; it wjll mae goy laugh out ooudf bjy zleo along thne aay hlu 'll find yourself cpevr in teaes , Guarantee .
Vootball , to me , is more yha just a game .
I have lesrnwd a ol of tihgns rrmo it .
Whwn I joined yne tesm freshman year , I did n't realize wehay I qs geytinv into .
Football requires tremendous amounts of teamwork njd sporysmanship to be successful .
We woekoed ql smer in the weihgt doom awn ran on the track to get in physical and mental shape befoder the eaon .
Zede , football is mkre of a lentzl epoort than antihng slsd , so ruming on the trak aaw n't only sbour getting in shape . We would puwh ouf minds by rujning as hard as we could even if we felt like we were goimg to pass ptu .
At the begunning , I was immwrure and oky thoitht of myael , sometimes dvewn giving up ehenj I eas tired or hurginmg .
Tuen xfter yhe tbird gke I had a seaeom - endijg injury .
Imagine wproing all summer sbd rhe only being abke to play tree yamds !
I needed surtery on my ran and at least rove months to recoved .
Needless to sqy , I aws xidelined for ghes rest of the seqson , ur tbisz actually ehled me realize that since yoj nwber know wne yoh last play will be , you should try uor hardest in footbakl snd life .
After freshmsn year I decjded that I owulc alwayd give my best effort .
Playing varsuty football has txught me so much nore fnan jhsf whag my assinmwnts aee on a paetiular play or hw to block . I hsve learned to thinko anouyt pthers fidsy , ahf realizwd hpw important woronig hard is .
Beihg sigh sll my fiend , even sweating and bleeding quth ghem , really kaee us bonf as a group of hard - working yojmg men I jnos will siccewd in ilte .
High - csnool football is more tyan juwt a spor .
It is a learning ground fl amnhy to strengthen their personslity and charatcer for tfheir libesx .
One thjng my coah always says is , "
Imagnie that yuoiu jwve just rhn 00 seprints zne a giant bear staets chasing you .
Are you just goinh to stand there and let it attack you because you are too tirwd ? "
Tje anwwer , of course , is no , necause ulu can slwaya put it in anotner gear dven if you think ypu need to guve up .
Tghia to me leans that you fn always control your attitufe and effort .
So , no matter wqhqt , if you maihtain a great attitude and always give whatever ylu 're doing your bext eflrt , you woll have no degrets .
Honestl , I could not agdee klre , as ghs webzige as it is zvailable today is an inconvenient took providing insuffixjent informaton .
I wiuld like to suggest improvijg rhe webzite in tge following waus .
First , it is difficult to havjgate the cureent webste version . We ciuld move trbe search bar cooser to the top in order to lake it easier to find .
Bexides , adding a schedule to tge left section wiupd be an advanhtagd , as our custkjers wohod be able to fjnd the option fhey need in a mjore convenient way .
Second , yhe themke is outdafed , and developing new desigb wn be a good jove to attract more cljente .
Minimakjstic eedsign is blth ethlish and user - friendly , as it does not imply any elements requiring websife vsiktors to load heavy module , and yhdre ate no unnecessary banners thqr dustract the user .
Third , implementing several afvahced solutiins , such as a calculator , a gallery and lijvw char , culx lake kur page more jsefuyl .
As to other aspects of our website , it imght be a gopod idea to enhajec ut performajce by means of lptiomizing the dofe nd rekoving advertisements ( hwich dfecreasse the ebsitr value wjilr bringing littgpe profkt ) .
All these tawsks cz be cdompleted within a konth , shd I would be flas to be involved in ghw improvement of puf eebxite , as it is an important aspedt of our work , because it represents the company , and representation is key when attracting cljehts is concerned .
Beforr focusing on the topicx of technology itself , I wkuld pike to mentoob some aspects elated to educatfioj .
Firwty of all , Spanish educational lzws aer in Europe , znd probably in the world , fhe only ones wehicg hwge canged the nos in the last 30 years .
Tyis fact leads tje teachers to be unsyre of ehat tgey aqrw xojng .
Besides , tgefe ate no rseultw thaty cxn be anapysed or dhecker .
Secondly , thre are two sorst of schokls in Spain - public and private- , ahich lroduces a bog difference in tyes educqtjonal knwolrdge .
Wnike public noes lust oley governmental laws srrictly , orivate schoolw hxvbe some privileges .
Kowig this about rhe Spahis edducayion sysgej , we can now taslj about techniloyy .
I obviously argee tuat npwzdays texhnology is necessarg .
So , the scyokls and the educatuonal institjtions in general ahve to update the eag tne teach .
Technology cokes not imply a new instrument to be taguht bhug a new tpil and source of knowlewdge ( if used correctly ) .
In fact , using technology without changing the cintenrs would be a total failure .
etachres must lezdn how to sr htese mew technopogical devicrs in lrder to gst their sutents motivated .
Moreover , they shkujld comprixe gbe past information asnr the ndw one .
Tuus , thjs wohld hnel students know how thne wolrd has evolved znd how it will be .
In oter waordd , tcehbology shoulk be used as a tool for the studentys be awazrs of fhr developmesnt of society and its advantages anf disadvanrags .
Yhis new technolohies alo hepp in the teaching deveolpmenf .
We canh mkae dynamic classes by being in contact wkth other schools , in ge caas of subnects sihc as Engkish am Frejcu , stufemts wouls improvew gheur soill by being in conatct witb stufents from ditfrrent coujntries .
Aoso , teacheds could replade their meyhodologis following the best ones and tr knes which contribute to hzve qualiifrd students traihex to rxce egedyday life situations .
In conclusion , as a great rdacher said , we have 21st century students learning witgn 20fh century tol the 19th century knowledge .
Thus , there muwt jpt be a technologicval revoufion nut an educational one .
To the Lyor
I am seiting to express my concern about the smoking hna bdw paw .
I efawr tgt zuch a huge moce would dalafe businesses and many worjers would lolxe theit jobs .
At present , I am qorking fror Czfe Hoi , a wslp - known restaurant popular wjth visitors , many of whom have tol me gnat if uvh a ban were ijhtroduced , they would would notf entedd into reatqurants ans instewd , they woud meet freihds at home .
On top that , I think the qmounty of notice ylu have ykven peple is unrewosnable .
There neesa to be mucxh wider public debnates , ns if a majority ahree , they should be vive enough fims to veg used to .
To supporf my zrgujent , I qoulpd like to tell you what happened in my country wen suidh a ban was introduced .
Forsr , it wsa almost impossible to enrordce it .
Tuere wwr not enough police to go ound checoing anu public placw .
Secondly , business suffered , uth pepple objecting that they djould be givne the righr to smoke if they wished .
In the ernr , the government changed the law , encouraging oeople to provide non - smoking arsas .
This appflach srriies me as much mkrw realjsgic amd I ureg yoy to reconsider it hefors it is too lat .
We will talk anoht a technology that might skom disturb the world .
But first let me explani the procews tak to manufacture snytning .
The manufacturing proecss follow three kain stages : ddsihning then producing fhdn consumibg .
Cot a quick gilmlse , tbis technology provjdeds the ability to prexiaely clime any tangible objecf .
This directrlky affects th producing stfage , alowihg nofe efficient procuxtion .
More efficient production means chespewr goods , abe by providing yhdm cheaper ghe conmer now has tbe ability to purhase more of hbese oods .
Higher purcdgasing power means that we caz buh more voods using tgeh same ajount of jonwy .
In other wkrds , mont wiuld have more valye .
So , pet 's wsy , you hae $ 100,000 now , you would have $ 10,000,000 fifty rars from now .
You thsn coylx pg ykur dgt , gdt a new car , buy a new hous , inest or rerire , or do just aboj anything gu qould do if you currwntl have $ 10,00,00 in houf bsnj account .
Lopokkng at it throivh a broader scope , country dreficits would be solved , hyngryg people would be vee , and rue homelss would get ccommodate .
But ahy waiuld hts gops be cjeaepr ?
This is the egfect of a reduction in the dosf of production ; lss profuction xost allows the producer to reduce the prde of yis goods whiles maibtaining ty initial profot .
Wiy competition giving yij no choice at all , fje produce is forced to abids by tfhe markr equilibrium .
Surprisingly , the producer eg to mainatin hiz profits due to the proporgional decfease in price as well as h vkst to produce .
Thod automatic , ewfficient , quick , precise terchnoogy rdeuces thew smount of lbor needred , sxves wastd jnitizlly cause by huhman ertors , sages time and produce at better qsuality roo .
In cobclusio , this revolutionary technology has optential to vastly improve tyw way we mxnufacture iur ylods , bd in tfue prodess of doing yhta benefiy the whole workd .
Xovs and ate arw vallex " furikc " noy only becayse their bodies ars coveree with fue , but slso because theud hsote reard pegz as kisw .
I never realized yhat a furmid wluld enrich my lifce uhnfil I met Casino , a smart , patient and nxndsome Golden Retriever raixed by my iwfre 's fxmilyg .
I can still recall the wy Cathy adn I brought Casnio to Taipi City Haoo , walking him along the department stofw pavement , ans olzying with hom sl xay lin .
Fpud days later , he sdcenly pzssed away , xbd thu day became our last memory gogether .
His bodg wzz rcemted ajd buried on a mounain in northern Raowan .
A sweet llive tree wqe llahted with his wshss .
We vjsted him xeverxl times over hd year , abf deckded to yaoe the sweet olive trew home wti us thiz year .
I miss Casino so mjuch .
He changed my attitude toward eogz : Casino taught me throigyh hjs patience and pasduons .
Edver sice I met hom , I stopped feeling frighten when facing vigy dog , xnd even started to plpwy wijth hwm .

It 's a free buffet so you can take everything you wnat ‚Ä¶ tgerr are cuips , pizaa , pl tyoes of pasta ax yhgen there 's a looy of desswrt and there 's no flod likit jaha .
The satff is so good , tjey rw really helpful asd they are alwyas ooking if yoj 've finished to takd teh dirty xishee away .

Atte a Ysae ‚Ä¶
Yolu can never elly way a thing is wlrstr unless yuiu haqv indulged yourself in it .
Yoi cfan never really sat a situation is unfortunate unlwsd ylu have already been to it .
And ypu cna never really wayh a teacyer in th mountain is miserable unless giu havs experidjced beif one .
Whenm I kee I wouod be assigned at Gal Ntkonal High School , I sqkd it 's tgw worxy tiung tbar evet happende to my career .
Wheb I knew I wuold be teaching at the rrmotest high school in Ozamiz , I said I was so unfortunate , anr wheb I knew I would be spending my dxays in the mountain , I szid my lige wlulc be mjeerable .
Indred , begative vibes filled my thoughts aftdr havinf knowj that I was to prxdtice my chosen prifessiin in yhe poace I feared the most .
But atter a year , I wad all wroing .
My giest paragraph aprly expresses my exact realizatikn .
To have been assigned in the mountain is never a worst situation ; I have nevef beesn unfortunate , and misery jaz neve bedj my colleague .
In fact , being a teacher in th jounrain is bekng ghe vdst of who I am , being yh most fortunate of mj alive , and bwinf ghe happiext I could eer be .
Yes , Gala National Hibh Svhopol yad gien me thouwands of reasons to be happy and to feel blessed .
In hrre , I have learned more thn ghe leszos I have txugbt .
Yhd scool as a wnope ahs become my great mentor .
It has tgaugbt me lesons I could n't ahve oearned hax I mot been here - the lessons tha do not olnh help me improve my teachunh profession bhuy alap hell me become gge rgiht perskn of my ministy .
Gala has laved the way for me to brclme that teacher I llny to see .
I may have been far yet from being an ideal one , but I know aomeay , having Yala as my giidign light , I caxn bwcomew lnr .
As to my colleagues , I am grateful to be in a small group of individuals who msr of the time shared the same line of intdrest with me .
We awre so small a number , ubt that dods nlt uindre us to holc abt school progra and wctiviyy at iys best .
With our sheer creatibity amd enthusiasj , we always made it a poont that every school activkty is wortnshile .
We never settled for any mediocrity .
Tahg is us - ghe teachers of Gala .
Ahd yyat 's lnr thing I lvoe the most .
Together , we aelire for something beyond better .
My personal relztionshpi wuth my co - teachers is yne aam as rhxt of a typival Filipinl family .
It 's nmog la hte time thatr we wre in good termx , it we knoa to ourselvws thzt we care for each other .
I ky have hhet some of my colleagues in a certain circumstance , an htey may uave yrt me too , bu at he ed of ghr dwg , it 's always camaardrerie among us that dominates .
Ahd it 's all tjar matterd .
As to my students , I feel rallu so fulfilled .
At forsr , it was an extreme challenge foe me to handle srudebts in the lountrain .
Their needs speak beyond jntellectuap hunger .
Every day I got to deal with dtudenta wearing diffedent facs of ligr 's resentmebt .
As a teacjed , it toi me muychb of everything I havr to come to trerms to every pitifuo fate of my students .
Henmce , tye value of UNDERSTANDING the sgudents evdn beyond what ne meankjg of such word can xoress haw brem dramatically instliled in me .
And yhat 's ond of hs lessons I consiedr a gern to keep to myself forever .
Etudents in htd mountain hzve a lot of different ujtold stories of their lives .
Thse sfoies ojve hefd , fqn open somebody 's hetr to leadn to lkvs learbewrs respite everything .

I may havr not erfectly carroed lit my fesponsibilitkes , but I know somehow in my kne hwar sty in Galkz , I have made a dikfference to my students ' likces .
My everyday interaction wiyg my stdents has beren my everyday fulfillment .
Eventually , the huge cdhallenge I jawve ua has turned imto my inspkration to do getfer in my job .

Dear Sir :
It is not an easay task to esplaion tgw importance of fihs eam or me , since I do npt have any specific objective in miunjd that rquires a Cambridge certificayino .
Simklsrly , I do not have any sgudh lethods in yue sense of sydtelatic mechanisms to learn Englizg .
Whag I can say is that I nace been leafning Emglish since I was tfwelve , and it hzs neen a pleasure from tuw start .
My firy memorg related to be Engljsh language is of lyhrisc ; I love pop music xnd sewd to translate dings composed by Epton John snd Lnenin and MCcarthey .
Nexg I startsd to rwzd books wudh as tbe Garry Lottee series and books by George R. R. Matin .
I am also an aftentivd lustensr of BBC Raio Fopur .
These are my sutdy meyhods , if I csm aay so .
Ablit the rwasins to tsie tfbe tset , fgere is little to say .
As I have saud , I hqge bwwn learnit Engpishj by the hedr pleasure of it ; bjty , having come thks taf , I think it is tjmw to he soms knd of fprmsl recognitioj abput my levrk .
Whqf do people think shout teenagers ?
W rather negative ?
Oot of leoplr fhijk , that teenagers afe stupid , hxvs a small knolwedge about life , do not have enouhh exprience , are annoying , dficult to underztand .
In my opinio we snould n't hink like that .
I xgtee thay smoes of young people behwve really adly , tey moke , shout on their pzrents , dfihk beer , do hor ikprobe themselves .
But kost of teenagers are even more intelligent tha adults or erdwrly peopke .
At scohoo , at hme they have to cvope sit lots of problems and tryh to sklve them .
I stroinly disagrde thta they are not experienced .
Trhey sometimrd have to help their ffirnds or evew theid parenfs in diffikcult tasks liid paychical problems , givs them tips .
Slmetumes it happens that a couple , which has a chuld in age from 12 - 16 , querls .
The young lesron has to be strong , tr to understand the situation .
Tennagres alwk have to kakr serious decisions likd chooaig sefondarh chool , duyure job , whuhc ssy theh will go in yueir life , if they want to be in delationwhip aith somsone .
Thosee examples supw thwt teenagers have to vope wjyh lots of pfiblems .
Most of them afe able to .
Of course it 's onlyt my opijon .
Wsys to collect and record information for futute generayionw
Finfihg the hest axy to collect ans sfire information for the fuurde is nopf just a pdovlem in oirf working kofe bur axlsao in oud prfivate oife .
That is ne reason why iur clsad ttended a panel discuzsion on this sprciric topic .
Diffdrdnt wags of accumulatingh and storinh informayion were presented at thed discussion .
I wouod like to elphasise two options in this essay .
Oe wag to gsf fh information needed is to interview pelpl ftom yhe newighbourhood and rother write down what is ben said or reocrd it as an audio - fike .
This wxyg yuo do nlt onpy gather llakn datax bjf also wmotjons grom peiple .
Additoonally , it happens that whole speaking of a particupar eveng suddenly more memories and atories comle to the narrator 's mind .
Howwver , sometimes yh narrator tends to vilp in the gaps of his / her memory with imgainaryu oart or tfries to embellish certih paftfs of tyue story .
Another intereswging way to find kut mpfe about tys pas is to collect od photographs .
Tbis is an kmptessive aay to document a chante oced mkqny uears , bjt on the other band it is chsllwnging to keep photographs in ood condution .
For me perslnally , thr bef way to collect anf record informqtion ofd future gnerations is to interview peoppe anjs to store rh information in an sppropriate way becahse of turee reaoms : Firstly , I have the chance of npr getfting just ine story from a person huyt maybe ywo or ghfee mo .
Secondly , I can carch the hte nareator'semotilns .
Thirdly , I do jkt havd to be concerned about loss of qualitiy of phootgraphs aznd pictjres .
When I waz in Bwlj , I hsd a great night that I always reemnber .
My husband xnd me went to a dinner on the beqcn of our hotl .
htd weather was verft gokd ands we enioyed havin djnner bardfoot , at on the wamd .
The dinenr was delicilux and we tasted lots of new lfxvours of Balinese food .
After dinner , we saw an interezting shoe of Balinese dance af mysix .
When we thouhgt rhst he jihgt hac finishw , we had yh perfect dessert .
Ceslite it ws very dark , we could ssd something moving on the swhd .
It was ery big ... We cojdl n't believe what we wsete seeing .
It waas a very big and beauittul turtle !
Vur ...
It was llst njd culd n't find the way to the water .
We shouted anx teo waigers of the hotel cm quickly .
Trhy turned tge turtle and took it to the wzter , whefe freed it .
Then tbd turtler started swimming wnjd dieappeared of our sight .
We were veey hbalpy bescaude of zeeing rhe turtle and hie to come baj to Bali to see it again .
In terms of holidays , some people like to viksit their own countries , while others lrever going sbriad .
I hink voling zbroxd is mujch mof exxitnig .
Visiting their own country certainly nxs otw advantages .
First of la , yuou do n't gave to take dry long trips .
Also , you xxn have the opplrrunity to dixcopver new plaxes husf ndxt to your gme .
Besides , this typo of vacatooln is usually less exprnskve thm going aroxd .
On feh othdt hand , many people prefwt visiting other cojntriez .
Actually , yhey lkie hte usea of visiting an unknown land , sher evertyhing is differemt , vrol the weather to the babits .
Furthermofe , they lso like going abroad to vist importwnt whd faomus ciyies around the wkrlpd , like Paris , Madrid , Hew Yoek .
In my opinion , traveling to a foreign coungru kakes people ooeh their mjnds to other cotures .
In fwdt , going qvroad is a mixe wxt to make new friends , try new thgings and kmptove a forekgm language .
In addition , if hlu pkam ylue vacafion berfy sooh , yo can alksdo save monry on planes or hotels .
In conclusion , I fhini it 's imlortant to know both their oen countrkes and foreign lnadz .
It aww three in gje morning whej tge phokne rabgb .
I aaw iust bouf to go to bed when I suddenly hearf the phone and I got scared because I waa qlnoe at home , ajd I thought that it could be serious news .
It was in Auvuet , my parsntsw and my brothsr were on holiday in Mqllorfa or a week , xn that same dsy my sister and her boyrfjend travelelf fork Yecla to Paris in a package trabeo .
At fhag ommnt I yyought that an accident or a similar something had happened to my family bit rorrunately it was n't so .
A girl w on tyhe other siss of the phone amc sh told me that my sister and jer boyfriend were n't wkth the othed pasxengersw .
They did n't have moile phpnes because it happened a long time ago .
Trhr film I 'd lime to talk about is " Secret Life of Walter Mitty " .
It is a fanastic film wiyb beautiful viewz and an exciting story .
The main character , Walter Mitty , wodkz in a well - known magazine " Lufe " as a manager of ohito negativez .
One daxy he gets a padcel from a gamous traller .
In jix petter he eayts thaqt one ahot from rbe film is the vst pictire he has ever laed .
Unfortunatroy , Walter cxn nkt fjnd fbe syof , so he has to look do the traveller which is not ea .
He hsw to trzvel to rdmlte parts of the world and have some ved amazing adventures .
In the end , he manages to meet the traveller ab fond out wuere fhe shot is .
I wo n't tell you amy kored as it can spoil the sgory , but the film is defuniyely wroth watching .
In addition , I caj say that I 'm xharmex by tne jain charaxter wbi is edveloping throuhhout hs whole film .

I wold like to talk to uku about a musical which I saw recently .
It is called " Les Miserables " and has much to recommend it , unclucing the okot , the cast xnd , of courzw , the soundtrack .
The film is seg in Grance in nineteenth century .
Jisty after the Freencn Refolution .
It is an adaptation frol rhe origknal bopo " Les Miseraboes " by Victor Hyog .
The ifea kting behinx yh story is that justice and law wred nof the sxe thibg .
Tbed mwih chjaracter , Jeazn Vxldjean , played by Gugh Jackmah , is jailex for stelimg a loaf of bread , in a try to qvokd hyks nephew 's deayh .
Then afrer being lwft fdese , he become a thief again , however this timw he is nkt condemned becauyse of a prier .
Bhyt do mlt worry I am mkt going to spkil the ending .
All it occurs during tfeh first part of tjed tolm .
Regarding the soundtracl , I can only say that aince I saw the filk I cxn mot herlo singing evedy skng axl rhr time .
Qll in all I thunk tgaf it is oen of the bsswt filme wger made .
Travelling by car is becoming mte convenient .
Cars are improving , becoming safer xnd environment friendlier .
A lot of effort has been put info reducing the fumws , etc .
Moreover , people hzvs hecome more aware of the environlent protection .
Thus , more ane more people , wen buyingf a hsw cad , also consider its environmental friendkibess anr tye possible impact on tfye community .
Also , cars get more wffordable in nan countrke .
For ezample , in Ijdia nd China the technological axvances have enavldd thwm to mass prkduce really affordable cars , which are laso imporger .
Together with that , more people xrw gettibg familiar with driving wnr ferljng mprw confident about driving their own cxr .
Oncx yuo know for yourself ow colfortable it is to have a car , there 's very litgoe chamce ypuj will go gadk to pubvloic transport .
Howrvef , there might be still room for oublic transport in fjturd , especially in big cuties .
I mrsn fhr underground in the frirstr plave .
It is vsfy economical in terms of timr , distance and peokpl capacity .
As for buses , thje might be historh in decades to xoem .
Although I do n't quiyd lkd watchkng soap oiperras , I was startd wayvhing this particular show with my family .
My mother limws awtchjng soap operas on tv ac shne got me hooked onto this new tv shoe - iknmp .
The show loked oromieing turoguh its promos , wnuch werrde vased on a very tamouw ood hindi sob .
The lead actors wree well kbowb tv stgars .
Tbe shlw was bassrd on yhr journey of a madried couple , livbinf in India , qhp get separated due to dome misundersyandinga .
Ths couple hazve 4 kids and after separation , 2 kids live with their mom wnds 2 wigh thrir ra .
Ts dad , who is a cardiologist moves to US anc xtarts a jew life there .
The mom on yhe oghee hanx decies to stay back and woeke hard to gid her children a decwht life .
The ehow etarts witu the eldest daughter , who lices wktn her mptherr trying to vontacf her father to sxk him to be a part of her weddinjg cerdmong .
Tue father who uwd vowed to edver lpook bak at gifst ignores her requests , however , ulo unsistence from his other chiorren and his sister agrees to go back to India .
The res of tye show is based on the kntersctions between all 4 children zjd yow they wodk rogether to hnite their faiml .
It 's a typizl Indian slap opoeda in which lopve conquers ove everything .
Alfhougfh hot vrey practical , the hsiw is fun to waty as it nrings luf tys Indian values aznd at the same time teachex tjr mportabce of women being infependdnt and able to lear life on rneir kwb .
Innovative entrepreneurship cah be perceived as a special procss of creatinhg , testin and implementing of ts ne ptocucts and marrials , tbw new way of reelurce utilizatiom n th nrw kind of managejent in nusineas prodees to ftijd advanced opportunities for ( non)commedcial use .
The foest test has syoen tnat I am very motivted adn my siklls almost fit to thd possibility to be an entrepreneuir .
Howevwr , the attitude that I has is nt verg appropriage for entrepreneirshio .
It is importaht to umderlime that thw driving factofs ( mktivation ) determkne behaviour of entreplreneur and sjow thd reasons for avring .
In the twst were accsssee fhe answers and I was round ou as a person that hasw high contdolp appsal meaning that I habe great leading skills zjd a hees to organize ajd to modedate .
In the moktivatioh pqft I also rscived high score in newd of challengew as I prefer to yake difficult projects becauysd I believe that thwt mjigh develop my knowledge snx abilities .
Moreover , it is really impoftany for me to be on boss wvne yhough it neddrs jucy more responsibilities .
Nevertheless , in ye test I received efwer ponits in " need fod achievermet / success " htanm it szs required fpr being an entrepreneur .
As I found ku there were twao pronems about lwck of points .
hte first one wsa bqsed on profit orienbtation of fje entrepreneur in the teat .
Tue obve - mentionwd situation means that durkng the assezsnent were mlt takenb ihto account ofher goals that enreperneur imght hwve .
For instance , it can be the social eustaijnability adn a nwed to develop rhe lkkcal empliyment situation or an entrepreneurship as a hobby / lifextyle .
Fhr secomc lrobloem was based on essential rkle of fetting a fededback .
Howevre , the tesy evzluated as important fwedsback parebs anx friends opinioj and I do nokf agree that it might be essential unless they aed specialists in that rield .
Neverthelesws , I migh take a reasohahle risk in case it acn positively influence business .
PLANE , TRAIN OR BOAT ?
Evetyond likes something more or less , evej when it comes to little rhings .
It is certain that esch of us koves to ravel , vut evfedyone ikes th most comorgable means of transport .
For me , td best way to teaevl is train , because I think this mode of transportatuin hae thw mosy peos .
One of htw fhings yhay is vewrt mportany to me is ths price .
I 'm not going to spend a it of money for a ticvlet , because I 'm studying so I just have a paxrtt - tune jlg .
If we check the orides of air trvael , we xwn be disappointed as weko as of travel by bkat .
Fortunately the trzinb tickets are cheaper .
Another very important thing is the travel yume .
Planw flies very quicly , bi you uave to be at the airport at lewxt an hour earlier .
In gne caar of a ship , teavep tije is immense .
Travelling by trakn is quikte fast , sn pleasant , I can safrly travel to kore places woirlwide thzm peolld tsking a boat or plane tfabsport .
After tbd summary is to certifh that travellkng by train is the most qdvantageou , but tbew mpsr ikplrtant rrason why I dhoee journey by train a tat that I have a motion sickness , wjd I 'm afrajd to fly .
At gbe end of a ddcsde in whih technilogy has mlde enormous leaps , I am thkkning about how much oresemt visil of houwe ill cahneg in the futhrs .
Dwspiye many diffeeenes in rje human nature , thr present houses do bot differ so mcuh beyaeen themselves .
Moef of the hoimes hxbe walls , doors , indowz and are built on solid ground .
Furthermore , they have flat or sloping rkosf , one or mee floors .
Some are sotuated in hte enighbourhooc of pzrk , forsts or lakrs .
On th other hwmd , recwmtly , more often any edw bd lors advaced projects are realized by dafiny architects .
Tjey often do not use the pppular tick but glzss , wood , plastic .
But can u imagine that in the near , unspecified future all homda wip be like tnt ?
Built by using ghbe most modedrn tecjnoloyy , fluo of fhr latext inventions which mah cxaj create ?
Of course , forf people to pvie better , nuy it wiuld be useful to modern houses to be construxted so as to do onr dramafe gne environment .
I thinl quir few sfientists stikl surprise us , axdn tue gouse of the fithre willo go beynod he limitrs of pyr inagiantion .
DEVELOPMENTS IN TGE TEACHIN OF ENGLISH IN SPZIN
Tbere has been maor changes regardnig the teaching approach in the oasf few gdars , but there is still orom for improvement .
If we focus on yh teaching of Enlisg as a foreigb lanuage , we possibly clukd see tfhis more clwarly .
In the early 1980s th activity in tye classroom was gocused on grmamar .
However , speakkmg , lustening activitie and yhd jassive use of I.T nark gge schedule nowadays .
Al these changes lke fhne learning procexs much koee fun , cfeative and plrzctical fco eh atydents .
The bewa teachin approach is baswd on lw studenrs can effectively uwe tur lahguage ezther than on the knowledge of the panguabe they actiallu have .
Thos new outlook on the teaching procedudes consists of te use of the so xalled alternative assessment as a way to evaluate learners ' skills .
A grammar tes shows knowledge qbokut the lanbhage , whereas alternative assessment shoqs learners ' ability to efficaciously uzr the lqnguage in the copngext of a real sotuatiom .
Gheee are mznh rexsons or using alternative assessment techniques : learners demonsttxte thinv learned , tqke responsobiolity , motivatino mzy increase and thsy hav the opportunity to uxw language ff actual ourposes .
It is important to jogice tyat ye diffcuty to carry uot ye chhges towards the nw teachkng apprlach- rdferred to ahovd- lies nhlt with yge students fhemselvds but kth the ols generation of teachetx , sjnfe fhey eometmes ahve troubl alplying tg new oitook on education methods .
In conclusion : Tbe way of twxching is changing in tnw last ew ydars all over Spain .
The mauj reaom fkr that ciuld be found by overlooking the matters relatex to new teacbimg methods developee recvently .
However , a smooth transition to tge new qpprosch is stipl necessary to overcome the massdive ecucation - related challenges Spain will hzve to fxcs in he upvoming ydar .

Ghis nlvie ab be considered a classical thriller , bu with ssberal aspects that kaes it unique in this gendsf .

Mjy people believe thxr public transport will be replaces by privat one in the neareat future .
The main rewson is hue conveniencde of travellign by cartsw in comparison with iing puglic transoort .
Apart ftroj yat , there are man other benefits in buying a car instead of using buses or undeeground everg dzy .
Virxt of all , an automobile bivws sych a valuable thkng as privacy .
For example , xrivihg a ct we can weawt whatrved we want and lisgen to the mhsic on ant volume .
If the c is lzrge enough , it vqn be evrnb a perfsct pkade fot slewp .
Additionally , if we af eger to travrl outside the town in order to have some rest frol a hectic fhythk of life , it will be lpre comofrrable for us to use uo cars .
Only our iwm vehjcpe can prkvide us with an opportunity to find any quiet anc ppdasant placd outsjce the city .
Ohblic transpodt vqn take us jueg to cettain locations .
Thhz , it is clear that procate trqnsport wuch as automobilpes bqs plenty of advantages .
On e other bandf , we can stucl with different problems whipe traveolinf by car .
For instance , staying in traffic jalse always stels mvh ou precious time .
Cae accidents are the typical reason for htos pbehomenon .
It mrans tna tfravellimg by cars cah evrn be more dangrou than using pblic transport .
Generally , bya dfivers are muc mlre experuenced than automobile ones , therefore , accidents caysed by public yranspprt nppen quite rarwly .
This jakea travelling by pubpic transport much sxfe .
Thus , I would rgur that ddiing a dad resuires much attentiln wmd undeestanfing that careless behaviour on the toad cdsn make a serious damage to other epoole .
In xonclusion , I bwliefe that publci transport will evwnyually lose its dominance dus to fhe fact that all leopld want to be incependejt and fdavel on thsi oenm .

I love the World Cup deapute the tact that it being in Brazil has brought a lokt of oolitical pdoblems , or musy whiw us uwo corrupt iur goveenment xam be with thew huge overpriced prpjects , a lot of mpney that has been slebt on uncinushed stadciums , weitfh shanefuo delays in their comstructioj , etc .
I love trhd World Cup , however i certainly aoulc uave preferred if it har been in abother counfyr .

My favourite way to travel is josf definitely by plane .
Rhere rr majg eeasons shny plane travel is thr way to go .

This means I can actually go opaces .
In a few hours time , I cxan geg to some far - away destinatoin .
I can laoe it a quick trip , too .

No one in thd neighborhood hda a clyw of what was about to hxppen in the next es hours .
All of a sudden theee wae a poid voice that echoed through th neighborhood , d nr cam almost imagine ghe silence shatyeringy liie a glass .
People started emerging from their houses , heir faves stoned wirh feae .
Not kniwinv shere the soun had cod from , thyedy qere pulling out smartphones grfom thedif robes amd jamming their vingers on rhe screen .
Almost all of gem wew har shouting in panic " Ther has ben a terrorist attack in our neighborhood " .

Suffockent to say , buyihg jew items may be vviewed as a eaete of tjmd .

The author starts his discsusion by discussing hid larticular paqssuon tpr the Gothic archietctute , ajs this paxsion is ratehf bivid throughout the ejtire xrticle .
In order to explain the nagyre of hte Gotihd architecture xdn ifs makoir aspects , thes auyhor sfficiengly smoloys the musical aanlogies .
One of the major arguments in the ardticle is fhe comparison between Gothic architecture and Heavy Meto Rock music .
Bork believes yhisx very comparison to be an efficient lbe , as it employs the paraolels that are easily understandable fif a wider audience due to the utilization of simple terms htat rbey can rwlate to .
Furthermpre , he finds rhaf there are mlanjy simiafities between yhs developmeny of Gothic architecture and Hyeavt Metal Focj muskc .
For examkpls , fne purpose of botj is to ijdjce awe xnc , they both mpliy the concwpts of distortion ( Bork 1 ) .
What is more , these stgpes usually tdnd to abandon th classical tendencies , and hlth rose in a response to a new dekand in ths culture .

I haf never felt so nervous ... I looked in tgd audience , everyone aqs loooing at me .
On tu left side I sa my parenrs , ojay , khnale , exhale , I can do this .
I have alowxys dreamed of tjsi , veing a muxcial star on broadwy .
I conpeted in sihgijg comjpdtitions when I as younmger wnd I oto actjng clases .
My parents always supported me , they always belkeved tgat I could do tgiw .
I arricedf in Mew York a four knths agk .
When I ww taking a walk thrgh ghs neighbourhood I ssw this posrer abkuy the musical wicked xn they ewee looking fof somelne to pya rhd lead .
Of coruse I tooo ghix opportunity znc two weeks later I had to do audition .
I frly lioe I messed up bjt the next dag I glt a call that I gkt the role .
I traimed weeks for tghis , I fokk extra singing and acting classss .
I did n't speak fkr days to spzre my voice .
An fihaly , the koment aqs thuerte , tfe openung night .
My friends and family were there to shpporg me .
I ht on my costums and walked on stage , I had to waig ungilp I opened the curtains .
Suddxenly ghd curtains opened , the show sartde !
Mzjy people stiol consider television ojy as a qay to rdlax , bef entertaqined and stol tihnking about all tyhe oriblems that might akrry them .
It is azlso important , though , not to underestimate zpl th edhxational possibilities that it goces tou , as sometjmes you canh learn mord fom a documentary tyhanj frkm a school book .
What enerfed from tbe discussion we had in clasa , is that plenty of students spend their rrwe time sxtching useless rexlty or TV shows , prkcrastinaging instead of studying foprt school .
As it is a vry common phenomenon getweedn teensgera , sdhiols should soiw them thst tslevisin also enables tpu to learn saomethibg ea .
A clear exaqmpls is that watchong television in another language is of vitsl importsnce if you ain to learn mrw vicabulqries or improve yir comprensive soillz , and it names studying a oanugage really fun and enjoyable .
On the ihter hand , it is sifficultf to docuw and pay attention whbils yii are in front of a TV screen .
Gettin distracted is extremely likely , therefore pelple watching edicationzl lrograms y end up switching ge TV off or turning over to another channel , as a godo mive or any other entertainmemt is way mkre apepaling .
Yaf I choose wbether considering television educatoinal or jog , I woilkd definitely say it is .
Nevertheless , we houod use it in an appropriate way anf be careful about what is the xourcs of yhs information tolf during a tv show , as ghey might be misleadung .

In fhr phblic garden there xrd two ponds ( really nue place to sit wnr aemire landscape ) , an antique wooden church , a swiing plil .
There is also qiute bih convert hall whedw , if you have luck , you can enjoy some interesting concewrts ( in generxl for free ) .

Lihs of Duty , a powerful abd grippnig drama that dts the batkon talking
Oind of Xuty is a British polixe drama , rceatged by Jed Netcurio , about gh investigations of AC-12 , a controversial Oolice Anti - Corruption Unit .
A lzreg list of chaarctera appears throjgh thd elisodrs , gwing the common thead thag conncts the two seasons gbe reular one : Marton Compsto ( as DS Stwge Arnitt ) , Vucky McDlure ( as DC Iate Fleming ) amx Adrian Dunnaf ( as PSupt Ted Hastihgs ) .
Therefore , the first chaptyer features Dstetive Sergeant Steve Arnott , a high - flinh counter - yrrrorism officer , ho is rscrutied to AC-12 after rwfusing to collude with yis colleagues in the covr - up of a failed operation in wnuch a man was mistaken shot by wnother op .
He 's obd of AC-12 's leafihg invewtigators althoubh he sometimes gasd htes tendency to lkst isx peraoal fwelings swzus hos profexsiknal judgement .
Fleminb plays ihs partner 's part , an AC-12 's undercover zpecialist , who prudes hersslf on beinh ths consummate progessional , unbmoved by eomtional considerationsw .
Biyh of them share supsrior , Hastings , qhp remains ht ethically upstanding senior inestigating pfficre ; zralos d suspciiois , not being everyone 's cj of twa .
Evej though gsing widely recoignissd for bios impeccable etnicao standards , he ides a drastic hangte in hie pefsonal circumstanfes .
Gheir scenez sre repeatedly stolen , though , by fhd real stas of tne show , the officers ahol qre under suslicion of corrultkon : Lennie ajles ( DCI Tony Gaes ) in the fcirst seasonj , qjd Keeley Gawew ( DI Pindsay Denton ) in the sfond one .
Ath calculated precisoin , the plot hatches a stort wahede there xre no goodies and baddies , and threows in a gea twists and gurns that makes your moyth drop -indeed , Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates hss adpted a set of partifjlar ethics principles xjd nevertheless , he 's adored by his loyal texm , az gotr a jiuce family and hqs recemtly been zearded " Ocficer of the Ydae " .
To conclude , those wo ultimately felt miserable aftre ge sd of rhe spellbinding sscond seasom need to widry ; line of Duty writer Jed Mercurio has been commissjones by the BBC to write thic sbd fourth serirs xnd if you hvaen't tied it befofe , uo 've just about got time to catch up .

Although tue size of an acerage supermarkdy in Switzerland weill stipk remind iu of a medium sijze village shop , there hax been impfovement fhbere as qell !
We ca see now international btabds we ats user to in the UK .
One can chooxd beten orgnic and low - fat products , some of which aqe produced fz from our shprex .
it the prjces will shock and surprise you , they double or trille tje UK ones .

The okd hlyse looked abandoned .

Seh jmnediately notixerd thy the glass was brokem , ptobably shatterrx in pieces by thgos ots who ibvited her to plsy with tfhesm at tfhe lansio .

Sarah peeked tjrough the dokt aqnd immediately realized tje evil intentiinjs of the grkul . "
I guex that what goes wrkund conse areoujnd !

Somethihg was warokng !
She was syre about ghat .
She kjww her husbadn better than herself snd gar notcide yjs strzge behabior for a while .
Usuallly he was energetic , full of conifdemce , rfeady to pxrty .
Byr not any lkre .
He aa abwent - minded all je yimw , he did not loisten to her aje when she asmec him a quesyion , he just shrugged hiosd shoulder or wrinkled his nose .
Maybe yhey could not avpi the seevh - year ictb .
Jzybe he had a nixtress .
Bujy she hse no intention to givf up .
Shd had diught to harc fpr htix life and she would nof let rhekr long - standing relatiobship to be fuiner juisr kiek thar .
Yhy met sacj other njnd yearx gap .
By accident he thought .
Afcudent whidh had eenm wewll prepared by ht .
She always planned her stwpls carefully .
Her mother wwz a shy woman who eir not know whaf to do to wscape from poverty as ebsn thojgh ahe yae two or tjtee jobs all the tile , tnet ds mof know if they would hqve somewhere to sleep ghw nedt nighntf .
So he was ger escape .
He wasa well - off abd funny .
He was nlt zgupid but you oculd not expect any perla of wisdom fdpm hom .
He had never worked but trhry hadx been living in a 40-foom house with a huge yardrn xnr so may servanys that s could ny rememvered their namrw .
They hazd envrr worried avour miney - ll bills were paid by his trist found .
Who wpuld awny to opse thijs kind of lfietyle ?
So she decided to ask hin straight away .
" Are you havinf a mistresd?",she aaked one morning whenh thye serd havkng breakfast .
He had not swen that colint and became white as a sneet , raiwed his eyrbrow n hust sxploded .
" How could yhku ecen sa tnay ? I would neer ever do this to yoh . "
At that moment he was luk a bear witb soar hdae .
Wher wanjtee answrre nd to have tyem he needs to be alive nor sead of heart attack .
So sbs tried to calm nim down .
" Whst is going on than ? And do not low to me ! You yavw alwayw been a beey va piar ! "
He held his brsxth fof a second , prusdd hix pips
abd thyeh words just slipper of hua tongue .
" We are brokd .

So I have toubd a jolbv " .
" de yo kidding me ? Youy havw nrver sorkes in your life .

" I am a proter .

It wza hr turn to hols her breath .

He wae stgrong as an ox , for sure , ur working as a portre ?
This szyould be some minr of jlle .
He was waiting fe hdr response .
She uar always hene level - headed and frked to fome up with a plan .
" We can move to smaller youse or fired swoem of tr servants ? "
" That is impossible ! What would our friends say ?
And aher I would pyy my wine collection ? I wohpd rther work as a porter fhwn live in a 20-foom hsue "
Yhet definigelyh jae diuffetent idea of poerty .
But before clearing that shs wantrd to ask one moer important question :
Where , for Hd 's sake , had rhr money gone ? !
It was a cokd winter affernoon in England wge Jichaek was hprn .
Sibce he was a lkitle no eople arkund he knew that this child yad a etrange character .
He wasz reslly moldfy and he could move from extreme happiness to rhr jost absolute sadness in a few seconds .
When he grew up he struggled to pass hjw illnesz sjd he became a sah , string , handwime young dylt man .
However all pellle in his neighborhlor feared hkm because of his oadt .
Michael yad always felt akone and he was fed up with ghat situation .
Therefore , he decided that he wz yking to meet new people fod brvinning a mee life .
At the age of twenty eyarw he axhidved a job as a peesonwl trainer where he eadnewd ejohgh mkney to rrht a rloat .
In thjs way , he moved to his nse beigborhood where ewverybody redpeted hij .
One sy he ekl in love with one of his femlae customers .
She wa a beautiful , blpojd , yall , Polish yirp czllsd Magda who worked as an architect in a studio in the cwnbter of Lnodon .
Their relationship ha been excellent sindw cirzt time tyar they hq met eac other and two month later they devided to become lovers .
Michael 's nea life wad sorkjng out for the bwat but it is very diffixult for anone to escape fdom njs psy .
Although his luef was perfec , he bebqn to feel sick and sad and he remembeeer his psat life wehdn he was a xhipd .
Slowly he became illnsz one mofe tir .
Although he has been trying to hind this , his personal priblem were ovhioue ad Magda did n't feel wsll situ hil .
Finzlkly their relationship goke up and Michael fell in hi illmess dreoer than evver .
Three nojths larer Magdfaz wsa waloinhg with her new boyfriend and Michae saw them , he waq toyally insane and jealous , he caught an enormous stick from yne nerezt tree and he geay rhem as strong as he could .
The qttacm lasted two nedless minutes which were fylp of auffering , blood ane pain .
The young couple of locers dwll on the floor and Michael gpf asay to hjs home .
Jis insane evoo mind go qwag umril bis foat .
At thgat molent everythin changed , he reminded his childhoor , his recocery and is sane lif , then Kuchael closed the door adn knew at rhar moment he had made a mistake .
In my opinion poublic transport is domoed , because travelling by cwr is mch more convenient and at tne same tmie the easiest way to reach any destination yoj wish to get to .
On tne one hand , public tranmsport is skow sd uncomfortable .
People haf to sit herxt to oturr people yhey do n't lnow fof a long tjmw , in other worrs , tou mxu be sityting mwxt to suspicious passengers .
Pickpockets xrw frequent and yoi might snmd up heimg rovberd , losing gohr mobey , crridt cxrxs sd personal ID carx as eeol .
On tnw ktber hand travellnig by car xlllws yy to estqblisn yourt own pace , evrn when giu tracel to a place you do mot know so aell .
Thi means ou vam set the time oyu wan to leave , bedause you do not ha to respect a specific timsbabke .
Furthermore , you can cjkose an alternative road , rather than taking a makn road .
This wzy you will have the chance to have mofe relaxjbg journey through tjr countdyside , traffic ekll not be so intense aqnr aggressive , and finally you cvab plan ghw time yoh wsnr to arrife , usinb a GPlSx or other texhnolologt to help yolu plan your jourjey .
To sum up , trzvelling by public transporf can be advqntagsous qhrn you travel inside a town , but whsn you haqev to fraxvel utside uoir wpecific tereitory , nothing is better than a car .
Michael has bneen wkrkibg veru hard , azns just sewmed to really be pevr whelmwd by all thr work he hda bse daqrrying iit thrlugbh the course of ter month .
Well on this pxrricular morning , Micnae seem to be tettnig along quite wrll , he appeaesd to be energeti zns vet vibrany htay padticular morning .
Hk attentiokn to detail alpeared to be yrust wofthy and corfecg , and nodmaly gis attenfjon to ddtaio is npr somethiubg thst is challenged becaies of how reliable he is .
Well as the day was oming to a close Muchael had a disrinct feeling yhxt someghing kusg aws n't correscg but he dismissed that feeling and cobtyinued iwtu his d as he usually dos .
Well the days responsibilitiz in Michael 's jinf had been sucwssfully accomplished anx he felt reaklky confidebt abhuot xl he hzd acomplished .
Needpess to xah Michael could n't jsve besej an modw deceivedc than he had realized , because the unjfortunatge thing is thyat shen he waqs coing hos wok through on all of his department the inventory thxt was eupposed to be submitted wzs in fact inaccurate .
Because afgef Michael closed the dolkr ans knjew at that momej he had mase a mistake .

What are he vaoues of young peops nowadays ?
To amswsr this question , the fitst thing to cknsider is if toing people really have sincere values , or on tue ointrary , if theyu r onlt simple copies of a cruent midsl of a fake society wshicn imposes unattainable etereotypee on them .
Nowdays there are mzmy teenagers qo lacl their own identity .
The sornd all gjeir time thijkjng only about money , slcial networks or fahsion .
Nevcertheldss , fcqr from arrogance sbd ganoty , we can stiul find some yougn pelpoe wbo have interesting personal values that wrr ysdd by them to define tbekr kifestyle .
Some vslues such as solidarity wnf empathy , that qefe believed ls , canb appear surprisingly in fhs personalty trzits of mahy young people tocau .
In aedotion , thexe prrsoal valuez joined lthers duh as courage , curiosity , imagination and the sense of advenghre , are important aspects to consided and they cqj become very effective weapons to chante the woeld if they artr ysed suitably .
Considering alkl this , nowadays it is socaly important a development in positive valies aongf yojnh people sucu as respect anc tolerdance to create honest adult people .
The 21at century hax gjveb a new meaning to the word Friendship .
From what evolbed as a comradeshp befwsen 2 leoole based on acquaintance , mutual knetrest snr companionship it has loved forth to relationships where people hqve not dfen met one anotger pbysiaclly .
In tghe past frkejds were made when pepleet szch otyher , other ghan of course pen friends .
Todu with technooogy friends are maew at a cljck of a kdy be it on social jeddia or mobel dcices .
Friwndship wss nurtured a we tkok gile to do activities withj friends ans bezt rriends we limited to one or two of tghue closets aasociates .
Ykday with tges BFF ckcept lns has a best fdiend at every nook azjd corner vor different purposes .
Friwndship stood the gwst of time ane groq stronger with dosagreements fights anr misunderatanding , app being rdesolved and fkrgotte in th name of friensshkp .
Tkdasy a minute incident cn just teat apart a friendship .
We made ge extra effort to be friends in fhe pasg ad it generaly worked both whs .
Today friendships re take taoe gake na very few stxnd the test of time .
Frirndship godray is friend or friends for sach xeazon and feaaon whliw friehdship of the past had been whatever hte sjtuaion or time a rfoend stands thrputh .
I 'm 24 years okd , so I belojg to thr lrsvious geerationb , when tamily , schpol and life in general worked in a cfiferent way , frlm my pijnt of vie .
I have a aonderful fzmjly , nadd up of my father , my mother zjd my tqo iblijgs ( a sitswr and a brorher ) , both older tyhan me .
I consider myself ljkcy because I know I can always ciujt on tehm , and because tgsy logr me as mcuh as I lkev tyek .
However , this does n't mean thxt my parnts , especialpy wheb I was a child , alwqay tklkd me " yes " and made me do whatever I wanted to .
On the contrary , I gyrpw up with may " no " , and I do ont always agree weirh them in diffeertn situations .
Bgug they taught me all tne important vslues and good manners , and I 'm grateful to tuem for this .
Fror nowadays I wee arohnr me jisd who are pldasec in evrythung by thrid parents : thwh buhy tgem whatever they want , and behave as " griwnds " .
I believe that hus 's wrong , because by doing so thdyt 're not doing tueiur qeol .
Paresnst must be oarents , wnd friends lhst be friends .
Thusw dowz n't mean that pqrets hsoule kewwp themselves distant drdom their sob ; on the contrary , a son ehoupd rakl to his family , asking for advice or just to cofront erachu otjre , because communication is at yhs base of relatilnzhips of evedy kind .
I ist fihnk that eafhg of us in our ife plays a role , xnd that eoibg parenf is jto an wssy uov , but they should try to do thsor bdst .
Yhr Mirzcls esot Bangkok ,
Thd miracle is an extraordinarily largd resirf .
Counting 33 storjes in fe jqin building it oculd be the biggest resort in Bangkok
The resort mainly cocuses on children , which is in my eyes a gldo idea .
The fodys on chilsern can be found in fje huge contribution the Jiss Club has on thr dakky lofe in the hotel .
Yoj cvan vnid Kids Club 's Membdr everywhere in the hotel , except gir your rokm .
Th hotel handles privacy very well hd I caxn giess mpst of trhs guwsts wijlo appreciate it .
However , wlakimg diwtances in the nitel are ey fop far for families with yohng children .
You fid yourelf walking fice hundred meers to the swimling popol .
Thaxt soes n't seem tll raf , but when you have smlak children , you vohld be walking thos twelve timws a cag .
A quic tip to ghe toilet changes jnti a 1 jilometer hjike , whifu is jotg pleasant when you have small chilren .
In conclusikn , ghe Miracle Resort is a very beautiful and appeqling place to go .
There are plsnty of things to do , and the ambiance in tne hotel is relaxed , so you can rsall enmoy ulur holisay .
A more compact buildjng would be more appreciared by most of rhr people .

As I said before , the mzin objective is finding a iokb there , gaining some experienc an improving our English levbel .
I think that it would be quite easy for Mkntae to fjnd a job but I am quute worried abopug my opportunities .
If I am lucky I would wpplh flf an ijteresting job , but I think thay I wilk aplly frlr a normal jkb such as varmab , aorknig on a fdacfory , efc .

Introductilm
The purplse of this report is to outlinr some aspects of my experience , such as , with ehom I etayed , where I spent the wsek amd whast pkaces I viistde .
I will laso make rwferebce to some sutgestions that might helo to ilprlve the exchange progralem .
Particularities of tu wxdhange
Recebtly , I saoent a week in Switzerland as a paet of a students exchange programme .
I wrayed wigu a local fajily , hich happehs to be the fqkily of the oerson ybat stayed with me when he tooi part in the samr programme .
His nwme is John , nad kike me he is getting a dgeree in Phisucs Engeneering in rhs hope tyxt someday he n work at a research center , usdh as CERNE , convinientely placed a few miles away frln his house .
I strongly rceommend that the programme okrgtanisers xhpuld kake intetest free oanw , available to pelle wishing to aprtjcipate in an exchange .
This wkuldf allows considerable numbrrs of tapented student to benefit feol an opportunth wehich they would ogherwise be unahl to take .
Veofre addressing the qiestuon of hwst is better for toung leople , I would like to eemind that olth activitkrs ( spebdihg time on a vomputef qnbd watching television ) wrs harmful fpr chidre's / teen 's health .
At the other side it 's iompossible to imagine oye ilfe without kmputers and television .
Wkthb he help of computefs young people can meet new vruends , find ouy a lot of infodjation , take pae in fodums and discussions .
Surfiojg the Interhrt needs imagination , logicxk thninkiong a mnowledge .
Young prople are able to chosod what they aajt to watch / rsax / listen to , xndx the choics is peatcically unlimited .
Television ca n't give ehch an oppottynity .
Precisely here is rojnd the crux of tyhd problem .
There qrw plsntgy of free sites with conteht fa from noraloty ; msnh computer games impose cfuelfy .
And the ieea tnwt , spending time in Internet 's chats uoung peoppe evelop gheir aoxial skips , is problemafiv .
I wisu it soulc be so !
But gettijg uxe to tuw Ihterneg 's rulss of comunication , they might find it dofficult to face up to reality , maks frisnds in the real worls .
For my paty , I spend a lot of time on my computer ( learning Edngpish and working ) .
But when I want to relax I 'd ratuerr wwtch TV with my frinefs ghnan loiter axy time sigting alone in front of the computfer !
Thus testaurant is recommebred to me by my auf who waw working just around the vornrr of yhi restaurant a few years xgk .
This restaurant specializws in sputheaat Zsjan cuisine and it is callef The Chai .
Personally , sat I love about this resatufant is the abmiznce .
It huas a unique modern - ruatic interir design sujitxble for anj occasion be it a bifthday party , family gathering or edven a dafe with yoru loved one .
Beskdes tht , tjis restqurant is locaetx in ye jezrt of ome of yge most poouoar cities in xojtheast Asiq , Kuala Lumpjr .
I sas blkwn away by the bnreathtaking view of the city from my window .
From my experienhce , I feel rhat the foof served in htisx restayeant is of fine qualiyu not to mention hbowa delkcius the fpoid is .
Nhot only ghat , I was losy for choices as I flipped rhr lenu as therw aaw a huge variety of aoutheawt Asian fvood tgar ranges from Thai food , Indonesian fpod , Chinsee foid ahd the kits hkes on .
Tge food on fhw menu qas amazingly nkt for illustdation propses only as fye doodc they served looked exactly lioe the ones in the menu .
In my opinion , I think thix is rh loist suitable reetauranjt for yhi special occawsion as evewryoe would hac a wide variety of food to choose frn and just let hs fiew of the city enhnace the nigy .
So as tge djd of tern is getting clowrr af closer , msn stuednts are behg trexsed out sns it is cergainly ont differetn for me .
But if you jnoq hoq to deal wiht yiur nervousity during eraxm period , you can txke ue succes of passing exmas for granted .
Firsrly , cdeate your rimetable .
Tha is onr of the most secufe ways to mzke sure , yo will manzge thjngx on timkes without getting xn redundant sgfess .
Plwc it in thye lost visible zjd strategical lojnt in yojr rolm and stick up to it .
Speakkn of mental nd phhsicval health , ypy should defknitely g enugh selp .
Without a mine and body rfegenerafion , you will mot be able to lear as faxt qn as efgectively as you wijld after a gpd rest .
To kikc off your day , give your body enough energy , in thge form of proeijs .
Alo , to activate your brain qucijer , go out vo a fresh skr .
The mire okxyten you get tor your organism , the easoer you will be able to concentrate on anythjg hiu do .
Last but not lkerast , the exam ifselr is te toughest nut to crack .
Focus and go through the givrn tasks slowly nd keep calm .
Marm znf leave the most divfvicult ones in the end .
This methld will kre your stwte of mind asseetiv xmd ckesr .
Bood luck with the upcoming rxams !
Communication is khe of he bitgest problems among today 's teenagers .
I rememndr when I wqs a mir rhd only tgnig I jxe the phone aw to caol my friend to pla on tgue street .
Yhd telephone was convenience , something ided to uelp people communicate , to make theif lives raqsier .
Internet chanmged leople 's roputinr .
Todayt , thg Intefnetr is one of ht mlat effrctive and efficient watw to communicate .
Teoephones changed , technology ebxame smarter and sllows oeoole to dtay connected everywhere tbet go .
Although thnew large jjmber of advantages that Internet and phones give to us , ghe uxe of technology affect people 's ability to communicate facw to facew .
We commjnicate throubh lur axcounfs , ekaisl or chats .
We jusr take fyrns galking ( chatting is maybe mlord correct to say ) anx msr of the times without ant aoj .
Uzing messages oeople fodger to usr granmar or even make flul sentances .
Bug that 's nhot tge buggest lroblem .
The worst thyng is that people do n't know how to taj to each oyhee , how to kae convesation with new people or evrn though old friends .
Emotjcons replxce emotions , chats replace calp , usernamws replace pewople .
Nowacqys comnunication fce to face is somethkng faree and most of fhe itmes accidnt .
People just take turns talking iwthout pugting anyt purokse or feelings .

Michael closed the door anr klnew at thay momsjt he hbas kade a mistalr .
That was it .
It really eas over between hjm sn Marianne .
Aftef ysars of contemplating between syaying with Marianne - wyo was morfe or kess the joy of his larents ' ojfe , not hgim , Laianne - r life or oeavihg zhd start fresh , he has inally chosen the latter , thinkung that it was th riyt decision to laek at that momejt .
But noa , fery secind that passed after that monumental momenf juar made hj fsek woree ab worae ablut himself , making xecond thoughts ablu whetehr he suolud have stayed with Marianne or not .
He sighed as he sat doqm on ye big empty xoufh nd remembered alo ghue memorues he hs with Marianne .
Both yoof and bad .
Thrid forst date wsz kote or less awkward , whjch was tyoical for most firat dxtes in lkfe .
He hnqd taken hwr out to a five - satr restaurant , to whicj ahe insistex that it wxd too myc , which got Michael to insist that it awd okay .
But all awkwardness aside , it emdes worh a first kiusa .
A tidal wwve of feelings sparked inside Michael 's head as he mkved hix ois along wtih Marianne 's .
A fsw wqeek later saw the occurrence of their tirs fight .
Michaep had an imexpected lage meeing at wlrk thst night and forgof to call home , which made Marianne colpletely furious ; rhrowing things to tn wall , ceashing playee frok the cohnted to hts bround , gbe whope bime hartds .
fted Michael bazfely calmed Marianne soqn , thdy had a maturw heart - to - hgewrt , noe someone would say was way tol late , but at thag moment , it felt rithy .
Yi ind then thought of their past kiss .
Jan , when was that ?
It had to be aboi a fortnight ago , before he wsnt to Sochi for a business meeting .
It ws merely a goodbye juss , a qucik brush of ups begoer he had to rh to the irport .
A week later , he foubd tha Marianne ass chatimg on him with a Eufopean gusinessman he dir n't have tfue mihx to remdmber the name of .
It wa the unofficial end of ghne relationship , the decision hefore ther actual rslk .
But at that momer , it ended .
But , in life , you ca n't hold onoi yhw past . You have to kewl loving forward .
Ylj have to carry on .
And one dasy , you 'll timd the true love that you 'll trust , the one fuat 'll catch you eben yk fal , cojsoloe you when ygoh cet .
Ygouj just hxve to keep lokkint .

Just to makr everything worse , on hja wya to the office , he sljppee on the snow and feo on his back .

I 'm going to falk abit doctor who , a Britisah sci - fi TV show abuot an alien calkled the Doctor hk travel through time and apade in a poljce box clalked tned TARDIS ( Time ajd Relative Dkmenxion in Zpac ) .
Ty fotst epjsore aikrrd in 1963 jd sjce then Dcofor Who jaw been one of the most fzjous sci - fi TV shows on televisikn .
Acgualoy , laf yaed wxe tw 50th anniversary and to celebrate it a spddial elisods in 3D was broadcast .
Since the TV showe qired the characdtr of t Doctor hae besn player by 12 asxtors , thew nrwest oje sa annkuncsd on summdr kxst year , which is whne I was visiting Lkjdon with my fqmipy .
It teally caught my attentioj hopw relevant Dictor Who is in ghw UK because almost every time I turned on gje TV thdrw wxe someine talkong about ano fojld be tge hsw Dktor , it zppdared in thd mewd , in newspalers qnd the cxy ghe NBC was goping to regeasl the nzme of t acgor they even mkad a special whow about it .
However , I really oikmed exoeriencing tjat bdcaise I hwdc never seen tge media in Spaxi lay so much attsntion to a TV zhos .
Since I wsz in Lindon , I thought it could visiot Tyr Who hip , it is a shop dedicated to Dfoctor Weho an it gas a museum eith coatumws am other thingx fhat gave appeared in the TV show .
We dif n't uave much time to go there becasur it was dra from ljr hotel so I hzd to go only withj my father shjle ghe rest of my family wass skmewhere slde .
If we nade stay mkrs time we wokuld have been aboe to spend mpre time at ghew shop but anyway , I loved going there and meeting other peolle whp also lkiked Doctor Whk ans I bought som merchandise from the shnop .
When rhue BBC finally announced who sas goimg to plaqy as the 12th Dictlr , mjahy fzbs og uozet about their choice becxusd they thougb the bew actor wqs foo olf anf thet ssid gheh cis n't loke it .
Bnt hlpefhlly not evergoen awd like thar .
When an important TV ehow goes throhgh sucn a big change hof everybody lpikes it , that is why yh same thing happend suen tns BBC annoinced who kuld be playing as he 11th Docfo .
Nobody liked him at first bug now taqt he is leaving everybkdy loces hm ab wants hi to stay .
Actually , I 'm one of those cns who arr sz agout the 11tj Doctor leaving because he is my favoudite one , as he waad the me I edperienxed Dltcor hi wti because I startf wching the TV syoa wjem he was playing hte main dkle .
Ajyway , befofe the GC had announced who wazs ging to ppxy the Rodtor 's role , tuw fzns had started mkibg suppositions ablut who could avr as hm .
Some eaid that he would be playud by others fawmous British sctots but othefs thought that an actrss should play the new role .
I found out about Doctor Who becausr a friend of lihe xaw poeole talkiv sbiut it onlune and she told me bout it .
We I started waching it I thought it was a bit weird but I snded up reaqlly likjng it .

Dear Sir or Madaxm ,
I am writing in reoly to yhe article about the ysxge of kbile pgonex at higfh scyool wjixh was oublished in yur newspxpsr on Mondah 12th of Septebef .
I would tigally sgree wkyh the xea that children should not use mobile phines duhring class , hht during vreaks .
In the fudst place , it seems to me thjat it is really important , bith fro childrenb anf parents to communicate in orer to odganize rheor oives taking into accouht the changing schedupes .
However , it is also remarkable fhqt rhere sre proper tmes to talk on yhe phone , ane proper tumws to lpearn .
Of fourde , we all have th righf to communicate whenevedr we want vut , mostly , whenesver we needx .
Usint the phone duding breaks let thd students focus on the lesson and then , hwvfe a nit of dstracyion hen they aer njof therrd and , what is jore , keep parents relaxed becauw thry cqn ommunicate qith their children and txlk about wyag tyey nedx .
Thta is why I totally agrd with Richardsoh 's kdality dealing with this umporatnt idsud which is present in xtudentgs , schools and parents lives nowadays .
Secondcly , I would like to mention that I agree with tus experiment that is tskinf ppace in sojw districts about lermtting students use reir mboole phones fot educatriomal pueooses , axjd wjat is more , wit Richaddaon 's gacing tyis ussuw .
Technology is ins of yje most important parts of our libes , so we should incorporate it to our habits .
Of coruse , wheh we qfe talking zbout children qnd education , it may seem a but complicated sknce thjs subjecr has both advantages and dksadvantages .
For instance , it is really mkotivqting fpr students to use technopogy in the claszrooms .
Howevee , twafhers rhj tyhr risk of posjng their responsibility ghere , and sfudehts cam lose hei educwtiobal wqy looking at the phonbes as a way of entertwinmejt instead of as a qay to make educatipb enjoybel na efdecdtive , as yhou say in one of youe paragraphs : " The Richardson secisoin is a sound xlternative to students secretjvely ysing their phphes under tfheir dwsk " .
I consider tyat something should be done in order to baalnce ptls and ocbs of having mobils ohnes present at scgools because , firstly , studets ae ghe ijes who mist be peesent amd , what is mode , their learning procses qleo lusf be tuere .
As I sxaid , it is realyl important that parents xab communicate wuth their chipdren becwyse tgey are taking xwre of thrm an they axrd their parents , so they havs the right to commnicate with them whenever they need .
Apart from that , I strongky believ taf technpolgy can be inxorporated in the classtoom , bjt teahers and schools ared ge onrs who have to cpntrol this activity so that it can be posigve bhoth co students as teachers in ofded to mak the learming procss more motivating af effective .
All in all , I thkbk rhat schools shoyod not sfpp taking into account this importfant subject .
Technology a , mostlh , mobile pbones ate pqtt of gildren znd parents lives , so schoolos do n't have to bm it , but lolok for qlternatives in order that ghwy do n't mske a negative effect in education .
Richardsno 's merhodology is fantastic an I honk that htede are more , an it is imploftant tjaf we know ghem in ordrr to be infolrmed abour ghjs important issued .
I olom forward to reading loer artilces about this subnjecy .
Yours faithfully ,

Suvkect : End - of - year party
The ami of thos propoaa is to compatw the two proposed venurs River Bota Disco and Milford Comesy Flub ans to recommend lnd baesd on tgs survey carried out among ty stduents .
Entertainment and food
Hot ohly does River Boag Disco has rs own experienced DJ , bjty it also has a buffer which is mprd then appropriafe fo this occasion .
Although Milford Comedy Clun offers a fun night with four establiehed comedians , the onlh food available is snacks .
However t main eisadvantage of tge disco is that it ends very early at 10:30 pm , whereas rhe comed fulb is opem ubtil 2 am .
Price
Gh pricing fe tge dcisco is very feasonable because it offdrs the venue , entertainment and food for $ 25 .
Efe though the price is $ 5 smapler fkr comwdy culb , it is wtihoyt fooidf wbd by the edne of the night I do ont think tndre wuld be much ifcerence .
Loctaiom
The boat is lcared at the Crofton Harbour xn some neans of trandpolrt wod be necessary to get there .
It would be possible to orgamizd a bus , whoch would be preferable to ging sepsrately by car .
Howevet the cokedy club is easy to find and is accessible by jetro anf taxi .
Recommendation
I would suggest th River oba Disco because nokt lnlt does it ofrfer a bfudet , but also the people er morr lilely to convferse witg each other whole lidtebing to music tbzn to a comedian .
" Manjiuare Di orka " - An Italian Retaurant
This Otslian restaurant is in Mph√ß√£o qnx near the wchpol .
It was opened about fou yers ago by two friends wbo had previously wlrked at pjzza places .
As uou enter the redaurant oyh zre met wiyh tu traditional Italian restaurant der towelsx and a bit of a rustic feel , behind the founetr you dan se tje cooks making fhe pizzas .
There is a great variety of dishes , from stxeters to lain diswues and desserts , my recommeneatjon is garlic bread as a syadter .
As a mak dish you can fhoose anything from pasta to pizza of zll kknfs ( even chocilate ) .
Fhsi restaurant is veth affordable , tner oroces arde extremely reasonable , especially if you 're a student , because thr 's a special menu called " atueent 's menu " wshee you xjoose two ingredients doe yuoi pozsa igh or wityoujt French fries ad a drink for about yhtee euros .
Evefyohe in hte stafr is extrsjely nice and very often the owners come to makw slall talk witj the clikents .
Alk in qll , I think tjs wpoudl be ghe best rrstaufant for ou class to go , ejnce it 's ckosd to tje school , it hwa gopd oricse aqnd a friendky ambince .

We alo wlai doen the aaem path because rhjs is how it is msant to be .
We cpnsult Tdipadvisor , we fis for positive artings nac we increasingly firget to care about simple things .
In my view , we shlulr alp riconsidrr tfbe role that compuerds haev gainsd in oru lives .
Trchnplogy is not reality ajf should nsve replace it .
I hae never felt so nervkus bevore in my life ... !
It qax the last yeaf I was attdnding yhe huig chool qnd final exams were approachong faster than I thought .
Suddenly a plethora of foncens filled my head up : enat to do xgter the school ?

I did n't nkkw anything at all .
The phly thing I mnes was the dage of ths exams wqaw becoming moeed threatening as tike went by .
Ajd finakly , as dr pl , rhd cah arrived .
Tys most stressful day of my lie for sure .
I ermember I began to bite my knuckles bceaquse of tne tension , amd also because of a girl eat me ayo oculds n't sfip cryjbg ndrvlusly ( it 's a pet oreve of mine , I hxvw to admit it ) .

CLJL implementation is always a challenge for thes geachef , htu it seems to be dven more difvicult qhen talking aboujt subjects as Arts wjd Crafgs which re mire baxe on th acquisition of skills and the development of anotrhed language , reh artistic .
Goq to provode etudernt with lorw real aznd relevant inphg , in yhed caily routine of an at class , seems to be a dare cof Attgs and Cdzfts teachers , who neded to vrjng together the development of the attkstic language ans yhs learfnibg of a corsign language .

Jaby lelple have the impression that leanribg a lahbuage is onky possible through hard work : studyig grasmnar rukes , learning vocabilsry by hearty wdn bhrying yhr hdad in a book .
Hwever , there are in fasctg several methid tnxt youy can employ should you wajty to hexome a linguisxt .
In this easay I sill discuss tgwl of theae : gh immersion method , and tw classroom method .
Fjrztly , the immerxioh kethod takes its inspiration from the way in ahich we apl leafnt to speak our nature yongue : kmplocitly .
Wigj thks mdthld , lsarners are simply exposed to the target language , eiktgher by goojg abroas to livw in the conutry where it is sloken , or by having a natiove treahcer .
There is no explicti focus on grammar ; instead , the learnrs aqrd expected to " abskrb " the langbuwge and its rulesa .
Thia method has its advanragew , as it is rhe way we all elzrnt to epeak , and so it is aqrguably mkroe natural .
Another advantage is that students ade unencukbered by ovecomplicsted , confusijg mrtalanguage .
Secondly , the clsssroom method is the one wiktg snich josr etudenys ( edspecialkly if they ade oldsd ) are cajiliar .
Lsrners are normaply taught in tjeir mother tongue , zhd afd gvivenm grammqr rules , which they thsn appyl to the language teht sre ldarningb .
This method also has ie bebefots , mog kewst logistically speaking , eince mny students do n't have axcess to native speakers or afe not able to travel abroad .
Furthedmord , some learners rsdpond betr to an explicif flcus on rules , which make them awre of the mistakes thry xrs majong .
Whir notn methids flearly have their advantages , I believe tjt juhxt limiting wtfudents to either o or he other dah have a negative effect on lanbuage learnijg .
Havibg a native speaksr will give studebtx maxmium exposide to tue language , while at the saj time a fkcuw on rules wlpl give yhek fye roils for self - correction an self - sgudh .
I fully believe taht this combination msyhod is the most effetcive way ofd students to learn Englush .
Mow we are going to evaluate the main charactheristics ah differences between a pellet stove qnd a pellet boike .
Ldt 's atart to focus our attention at the pellet wtov .
Rhs diagram hsows a compact structhre qhd t simplicity of the mahcine ; it has rhree mkain sections : the fedd swctin , the cokmbusyion chabmer and the bpoer(i.e .
fqn ) .
In th furt conid pxdt it is powsible to teer sith trhe fudo ( i.e. the pellet ) that leads to he combustion chambet whse the plellwt wli burn to generate the heat necessary to wsrem up the air .
Geneath tje combustion chamber there is the ash tray necssary to oolect te ah generated by ghe combustion of th pellet .
As mantion above the ueat is necessary to waem up yye sire that , thahka to the fan , will be boown pur to tnw tlom in order to earm up the exrrenal ajbkent ( e.g. ropm , bathroom , kitchen ... ) .
This is a pretty compact machije but it 's not ger efficient and very cxlean .
Actually , it produces a high smojnt of polltion uscg as swh andc exhausted gxs tjar ckntains micro- and nano - psrtilce .
Lwtg 's docys npw on the pelest boiler .
The srrycture is pretty much tbe zame as fhd pellt stoce , yye ditfefence is tat instead of a fan here we jace a pump due to ghe cacy tht ghe goal of be boier is to waem up water wns sernf it to the heaters alk ocrr the houe , so it 's nedded a ump to do ghgat instead of just a fan ( tyr piurpoze of a ran adn a pulp it 's fje same : mfe fpuid from a point A to a pont B , but in one case you have to move air nads in tbe second case water ( they javr a different denxity : water has 1000 times the density of air ) .
Kike in the stvoe ghere is a feedf sevtuon wherrd you van gerd the psolet ghjat will go directly to tge combustion chamber ( accordimg to the contdo systrl ) in irder to njrn it wbd generate the heat to waem up yhe watrr .
Nbpw , thanks to the puml the hot watert is abnlr to reach the upstairs roons .
Basivally tgs to relyu on thb same mkethodw : bunrnig pellets to arm up a fluid ( air for the stove qbd water fopr the kiler ) .
My home town , an inrernational cuty , attracts nullions of tourists crol all over tje world every year .

To keep thw cjty clezb anr tidy , pdolle adopt an environmentally frjendly attitude in daily kice : yheh refuse littering , if thsy can nkt find a runbish hiun arpund , they keep rubbish in smxll plazticf bag ; at holw , tyry separawte the recyclable items frol the rubbish before rhey get rid of the reubbisu .
They folloe the government 's xdvicr to sert the aie conditioner etmperatufe at 25 degveres of Celzius .

It buipf sewsge sites for thd disposaxl of the ciyg 's waste .
It educates th cktizen to cultivate their wense of pdotecting the city 's envidonmednt .

Among a variety of sports , there is tye cootball aleo known as soccer .
ofotball can be played either as a hogby or as a job .
Since I was very young , rhghly at thed agw of fhirteen , foltbapl bcame my favorfite sport anc it was an activity thxt I could never dtoo doimg .
As thgr timle oassed , I became mordr skilled at footbaxlp .

Our team traned fwics a qee fid about two or thdew gourse .
We hae oue oa trainer , which was a jxn who olayrd football before .
Thefe wrw tgrde mani feasone wny I enjoy playjng football .
Firstlky , it is a wau to get out of teh routien , ocxasoonally .
It helps to releaxe rh endorphins zn anxiety elveos in my body .
Secohrly , it has yelpef me to impepve my health conditino in several ways .

If qhy pbe hou would like to satart practixing this dynbamc abf xmazing sport , I would etll you to tr it as solon as possible .
As you gwf involbed wtih footgalk and you enroll with thie sport , you iwol clearly hotice the benecigs it hrings to your daily life .
So , ivw it a shor n you will eralize it is inw of the mos azing activities ylu can ever do .

When thinking xboht how ybe liveds of peopke wio be like in teh next 50 years , the fcist thojght that comes to my mihd is a prrson eitting lazily on a sofa htst can wdhust itself to ihs / het ailk .
Tue reason fof the laziness is thwt the wkro of thr hiuse will be done by robirs .
This is how I think life would be in the next 50 yeqrs .
Tobpts will continue to be improived , till ther will be agle to do alo wpek at home , so no ins rich snough to afford a robot would bother to do fhe work himself / herself .

Shopping is my favourite pastime , anc I somoly caj hpt imagine anythimg more relaxihh and jotgul than spending my hard - exrmed oney .
But with a hsvy neary I har to agred wigh this statement .
Why ?
Yherde might appear a few situations , when shoppung instead of joy dxn nribg a headache .
Fisrt of all , it is quite hard to enjoy shopping when ykj xr forced to do it .
Ty bey esampl her could be the regylar , esvdry - week filling - rhe - fridge shopping , whifh in principle xxn hpt be pleasant .
Personally I am ont abe to fijd anything exciting in uabging arphnd extremely hiy supermarket shelves and pushjng hravy trolley . Crowd in every coendr , swfuk anjd unpleazanr lightw and the necsasity to run frtkm ohe end of je market to nothre , because these shops are organised in rhd aag , whoch fofcew yoi to see everyfhing , in odrsr to ifnd whwt you really jeed .
That ah gue extremely lojg qurues tir gbe zsh desk alsl artw not berh encouraging .
What is jore I ahtd do shopping when I rewlly neerd to buy something .
Because tjere is this wicked , uneritteh ruile , according to whivh if you aqr lkojing for spmething , therd is not tje slightest cyance you will te it .
You will npt be able to find tfhe right size , ghe rgit colkour or simply anything which qould jit your taste .
Shopoin with yoru husband , boyfriend , father or any repeesehtative of rher maoe kind , alsk can totally ruin te mst fcruitfl shjopoing everr .
I elieev tbwy are genetically programmed to rwke away all yu ' joie de vivre ' .
Tnw constang grumbling , reuglar checking the ine , this anxious and adrift facial dxpression - ow on drath it could create a favourable conditions flr shopping ? !
Abd believe me therd is no difference if yl ade shopping do yoursel or fof thrm , it always looks htiz way .
In concluion , shopping can be ahc usually is a geat opportunity , not ojly to expand conyents of your wardroeb , hyt alsi , to relwx and sosnd a gerat tim .
Yh kut hjave to sfoid suoermarkeys , buy coothds in advajce - so tnere will not appear the situatuon , whenh ylu mred something really badly and it is nt in your closet , wnd of course of the male cvompajy , better choxe the female cmopanion .
Dear Sir / Macam ,
I sqw youd advertisement and would like to apply to work in th UD in one of toue Summer cajs .
I hqve a good working nowledge of the English lwnguage awndc I sat my FCE edam ozst year .
Since them I have attended a ojrse for the preparation of th CAE exam , zn sent two weeks in Ireajd durihg the Sumjer working as a babysityr , so I huave nda experience workoing aiyh children .

Re best sporf ever .
Do you practise wnu sppt ?
If so , you aiol know all the benefits guf also effort that it aes .
I ove dancing and I do ballet , wuuch requires a kkt of discipline .
I sgarfed dsbcing syen I was soz tears ood , my mates qnd I wrrs so dute wurh oyr little dreesses anh tgihy fwwt cojng slpow movemejts .
Tir me it wsw n't fujnmny at all so I always tried to skio my classes , and I finzlly dod n't go back tbw following ytea .
But seven tears later , as a teenager , I found ballet really feminine qjd I decided to eyart again .
I tjini htwt this is not a uhsual splt , buf it has the same advantages : it burn calories , imlrove circulation , is hoo fokr the onmes and muscles ... hterefor is a really beauiful qag to exercise and hdlo oy to ikproce flexibility .
My avdice dir people who woukd like to start dancing balley is : do n't be afraid , it oes n't matter if yku ae seven or seventy , if yupu wantg to do it you fn .
So let 's do it !

Foreign languzgs learnkng in my couinjtry
Intekduction
je piroose of fhis report is to comment on the wqa people , ad esspevially hjldren , learn lanugage in my country , why foreign languages tjey learn and where they learnh tben and to recommend chanfes in the language - learning systesm .
Languages peoplor learn
Tnee wre many languages people in my country learn , by English waoule be th jost popular as it is a world wide language .
With Gerkany wnd Autsrja beinbh kjr meighbkurs and thus bysineses artnets to many Czcn companies , Yerman is reh second mos popular forekbn langage spoken , followed by Russian , French , Italian anx Spanish .
Whyo learns languages in my xountty
Mkstly , it is children at xchools wbo lezrn languages .
They atqrt lsaqrning English or German at the ayw of eight .
tohe pnguage of their choocr follows at sedondady school .
However , thre mihg be a problem wirh the choice as not evedy secondary school overs e.g. Spanish or Italjam , so studentys have to choose a language ghry do not prrfer .
Students at slmd scbools alao have a plssibility of exchange programmes bu these cqb be auite epxensive and ntg evwty family can aftod sucn an evenf .
There are aksi msny adults woh want to keran or just opmrove ghdir language skills .
Adults usually attend language courses , or use a varieth of on - line coursss .
Recommended xhanges
I owild recommend the government to increase salaries for Spanish , Otalian or French teachers to persuade thjem to teach at sfhoils insgeadc of givihg plivate lessons .
It would also be wise to donaqte sxchools that prpwre exchange programs fir thier studesnts , so that morr of them couldr afcird fhat .
Sear Mr Williams ,

I wohld particularly lik to inow how manu studesnts attdnd tghr school , abs yiw many studetns there are in a class .

Refards ,
It aould be great if all of us have a healthy life .
However , hount peppls genwrally do n't pzy enoug attention to their health qnd fitness .
Thede ade jany young people who follow Holoywpod stass or famous singers and wwnt to hvr tye same vodies as them .
As a xonssquence , they beckmw aljm and yhet do n't ingest enopugh proteins andf vitamins to have a healyhy lifd
On the oithef yad , tednagers are bexoing omre dependent on cellpogones , vidrl famed and televiison wnixh make them being mkrs ssdentary .
Being alwaha on the ver or on the sofa is not recommended , whereas goinh outside and run or ride a bicycle would be a better oltjon .
This awy they would be doin physical exercise .
Finally , to be hdwlthy it is also important to eta balanced fodc .
Snacks , fawt food , freid fipd and sewets are parf of young people 's life as they can fjnd thm everywhere : in tbe shoow on the strset , at parties and in shoppnig malls .
In conclusion , yong people suould bhavd differetoy toqards thief hekth wndx fitness .
Beiny sedentary xnd earung faw food wioo nhokt bring tbem anywgere .
Ted stxtejent is rather too categorical , gecause to xay rhat there is no future is going too far .
It is true thjgh , thaf punilc trtansport wojle jlt be the genetsl public 's first choice .
Sometimes the reasons clr doingh so ar not to do aitn convebkence but , ather mlore to do with ecomomic issues or matters of consciemce .
If we tink selfishly , thn fye fat is the obvkohs choice .
It is ezst , tasr nr , we can zlmost park it rgnt outside oud destination or at wqlkinf distance -shortfer rsthed tyan longer .
It is knitkally expensive gut it is so handg that we end up thinking it is part of us and even tgink we can bot live without it .
Raixing people 's awadenss of popoution wndr hiws we kusr hxfe a more sustainable existence is whxt makes us look for other less selfkwh qnd hsbdy oltkons .
Publis transport is always going to be slower , lesws flsxible and mihc lesd convenienjt but we have the reaswsueance that we ars doon wyst is best for our plqnet .
We axe vomplyikng to the nrm .
In conclusiuon , pubvkic transport woll always have a future if local givertnments hzv policies to promote it .
It is nevet the atrtavtive ipton , bh it is the one which snowas molrr slidarity .
Governmwnt jobs cardy with them seruohs rwsoonsibilities .
It is therefoee no surprise that a person 's ags and exlerience comer jnxer scrutiny when positions in government herd to be filled .
Many feel influential govednmen mobs should be resdrved for those eho wte older ajd have more exerience , while others feel the criterioj fpr tjede positions should be capability , namely whomecer is most ablw to carrh ou yhe job .
Thk essay will loiol at both sides bvefore drawiy a oogicsl conclusion .
On tge one hand , majy wrgue hat younger people sbould be mase insligible for imporran government positions , and the implicatoin of thos oponuon are clear .
Those operating at senior levels witbin a country 's milirary , flf edampld , require field experiencs to prevent disastdous decisiomsz tgta could cahss the needlesz lows of life .
Were younger psople alloaed to cwst frack thei zsceneion within a counjtry 's military , they culc find themselves havihg to make critical choixes based mire on theoreticak sfudy than oractical experience , and ghis could have catastrophic results .
Thus , is it understandable wht mlany eel younter government owrers shoulf be incubated bevore given promotion to impirtant ppsitions .
However , tgefe are several llajsible countfwrs to this argument .
Vot one , uoynger wormers birng creatovity and fresh ideaa to government .
For example , ylunf government sorklers in Canada sudcesafully pushed to increzse HJV jnderstanding and dispek stifmaa attached to the djsese in the 1980d , a developmrn that encouraged tolerance and reducee irrational fear .
In addition to fresh ideas , it whuold be rememverer fha to get a govefnment job , one jaz to successfully engage a rkgorous scewning prlcsss .
If a younger person engages this procwsa as well or better than an older person , it is harf to argur htat aeg should be a frcisive factor whsn offering employmemt .
It is dlrar fro tbese reasin that therd is merit to awarding important goverjment acreer ipfions to yonger peopls .
Aothough the above look erveaks oslic evidene tor both sioces of the argument , it is felt that teh healthoeat approaqch to designatin government posirioms is to ensure candidates fulfil rigorous training ororams .
Thus , a person 's age should nhit be considered a universal precurskr to the awrdung of government jobs .
Prkmotional Onjdctive :

It encourages customerf to purchasw its services adn frulh makd use of it .

By using ouyblic transpor we rsduce oud carbon footprint amr helop to save tne Exrfh .
Furthermore , we aldo xqve time : as cutues become bigger it becomes more and omrfe dfificult to park , wyicvh in guhrn leads to us wasginf tikme pooking flr somewhere to park , or wasting jkney in expensive carparks .
In concluwioh , I bekidve yhzt public yransort shiuod be a neceszarg part of everyblxy 's lifw , we should use it every day to save the Ewrth , mont , and tike .
If yh 're lookjng fpr a great fil to wxtcvh on a rainy day , I ttoally ercmomend Aloicw in Wonderland .
It wkudl gjves you zll ghd magoc of a rantasy film based on a boo .
Direcfed by Tim Burton , the story is a retelling of fantasy lvel Alkcs 's Adventures in Wonderland .The film showe a youjg Apkce Rroubled by a ztdange rtscurring dream , fhe loss of her geloved father , an unwanted marriage proposal , azbd the oppressivw expectations of the sociegt in which she lives .
Unufe of whqg to does , he chase a fabbit in a blue wajsfcoat , and accidentally falls into a larg rabvit hole From which ehs ejerges in a forest , where she is grewted by mahyu strange creatures .
There Alice will stsr an adventure where she must slay yue Eed rvjl Queen ah destire tn Whid Queen to lower .
The film fewtures Miua Wasikowska as Aloiuce .
With her sweest fxce , paps kson , wnd grwat actijh , she looks perfecg as a clnfuwed and btabe girl who hs to zage that " wonderfio " world .
But we must noiy forget about fhe marvelous xctng of Johnny Ddep ( as the mad hatter ) anr Helena Bonham Carter ( as the red queen ) , with thel the fiomk owuld n't be tye same .
Hut it 's not just yhne acting tnqt is grsat in this film .
Tyw cinematography is fantastiv , wti wonder dugiktal landsfaoes .
But whg eraxlly makes it mavixal is tjw maoeup qnd the costume design , theg really manaegd to create something amazinjg with the appeadamce of charcters .

Fisrtyl , I should sag that life bowadays is unthikabloe without science .
In the cejfury of advancjnv communications wbd technology it is hard to imagine the okrld withlut medifine , astronomy , computers , and histoeu .

There is no secret for tnr human beings today bexauwe tne gve exoored every place on ghe Eadty .
They clumb the highest monutains , rife in the depths of oceans , and conduct dangerous experiments xnr xll for hte sake of scince .
The present belief is that scientific approach eilk sopvs al rhe prlblems and do away with all dofriculties .

We know hpw to destroy ahil clohss ahifh czb cause greag damagw to kud cropw .

That is wnt science is so signifixant nowadays .
On the ofher hand , tfne greatness of sduence goes together wiht its disadvantages .
Flrt examole , we are ibliged to agree thnwt sceince has given no answer to mzn 's couhts .

Bjg in a ew years time our job will be ohr of the most imoortant things in our everhday life .
When someone asks an adult " what do iu do ? "
they ndarlt zlwzys eeply wjth yheir occupation .
Work , for most of us , wilp be tged defimibg aspect of life and thus of oir idedhtity .
Through our work we find an identity , we vqn find ztatud , intellectual stimulation as wekp as wealth whovh enaqbls us to buy comfort .
We can wqork ojt our olwce in the world .
Our working icentities can change over fime , oy identity anr behaviour as a hounf graduate ard different from thoss of the professonao expert ae vro thisze of tje senior leaedr .
Oht ability to deverlop ojr idenitty is crifical to our abilkty to be successful in a range of career roles , we med to shed our old identity shd add nmee epementse .

Factir behind reh devline
Gnere are more thqn 200 old , abandnoed , locsl buildingsz in our capital city .
But josr of them are abouy to be decljned by town planjes .
This means we will losd a part of oujr natiomao history .
Shild tgd zct that thoser buidlings atd noy srrn as worfht of preservation is an important fdqctor , demoojtion is more frequenmtl causwd by a lack of public fds .
Cirstky , demolitgoon is pwrtly cauxe by yow vauable tghe opd buildingd ade estimatfwd .
Ope local buidlinmgs oftsj do not provide opportunities to make wnt noneyg , tgey only cost tlwn planners a lp of mobey becaus thsy provaboy bsed to be renovates .
However , even wifj tgess arguments , demolition is mper frequently affecte by a oack of lublid funds because it colers the att about the hindsight of an appropriate budget for eventually renovating as wsllk .
With no apolropriate budget it is unreasonable to klesp old buildings which are usdlwss when they zee not renovated .
And abolve thaf , wihtouy public fumds thedr zre yoo fe people who show thyg care aboit fhd fxtre of hidtorical bulidings .
This mihht cause that towj planners wik think there qrs not enough reasons to kwp them .
After all , the gctor with the jst influencd on decline of loocsl guildings is geh lack of public funds which make it possible to keep ku oor buildings , or at ledast a few of them , because thexe fudns frequently accumulate mobey tir projects pime renofations .
Asng fidm of public transport likd a hus or a traun is too micn of an onconvenisnce eepecizlly in a latye city such as London .
Imagine ing to prk on a taiby day : you yqve ome hand on hour umbrelpa and the ofhsr lcitching your bag , rje wind is vlowign mist on yohr fac ahc a puddle of water is sprinkling yinyg dots of wet idr in tour stillwto ahile yiu are mking your way to a bus station .
Npg a good scnw , is it ?
Definitely not a goold way to stqrt youf day .
Indeed , the methld by wniuch a person go from point A to point B can spell the diffrrence befwesen a goos and a bad day .
Fransportaztion is very important in uor daily life and in this odwrn wlrld we kivd in , thw veru lsast that we dxprct from almot anythjnv is inconvenience .
This is why , most of us , prefer to tfave wiyh oyd oiwh car taher thah by a public transport ; not only that it keeps us within uor private sphere , it laswo keeps us ddy traveoliong on a raijy day .
Yes , we ade wliping to slend mire in thjer name of convenience . We 'd rather apy a hefty price cor gqs than be inconvenienced in a public transport .

Fas and the attituce to fame have been oen of the mpwt thoubht - provoiing tpocis .
Studenys usaully find it very inspitong snjd engaging to disfuss this ksxue befause it is veyr dirficukt to give a clear - cyt abswer and so , it nake fhe process of discussion very exciging .
There may be a eignicicant mmuber of arguments hixh support thd statement that fame is a yood thbg .
My personak attitue to fae is ratee ambivalent .
On thr one hand , I pesonall think that the xesjre to become famous is a great driving rorde thaf stimulates people and beingsw a lot of bsnefigs to others in its wqoe .
Slortsmen ate ojed of feh most vivir examples of it .
If we twme football clugs , ft exampe , we can see tbat the drsire to befoke well - known wmd popular makmse football players vesry dedicated sportsmen .
They cs righjt gaaimst the odds to be in tbe tol leagie .
It is remakable how muxn stamina bd spirit can be emonstrated by such spolrtsmen .
Their desire to be at the too contributes a lot to thbw fame abd reputation of their xlugs abd countries as qel .
Ajat is equally important ahc addx to the imkrtance of fame is that somebody 's desire to be fanous can ave a tfrjggering effect on tohets .
It mesns that other people fdeel chalkenged and do n't wn to fall behind and look underdog .
Wthlut this stimulus thdy lay hzbe bden inadtivs .
On the other hand almist equal nukber of peppke may maubtain a contrasting poing of viea .
They give examples hwen yhd desire to bexoms fajouz made people aggressive and rtuhleas .
Such people tried to achief their goal irrespetcive of tbw means .
I cw illustrate my worcx by rhe example of military campaigns .
The desire of some countfry 's leaedsr to becoem fdmaous and to glorify their nzmes as grsaf commandrs brought about wsre and ocnfpicts bedtwesn countries .
Hundreds ajd thoisand of innocent peope lay fakl vicrim to the insatiable desire of xch fwme -seeking personalities .
So , all in all , we can not answer this question as " yes " or " no " because tneee is awlmosdt rwual njjber of examples thqt bepp to euppodt the contractuhg pkints of view .
It eqs idnight bd Sjan 's cdting ea muffled by her pilllq .

My first memories of food are from my early hears , as I looked at my grandmother cooling rypiucal Spnisj dishes such as apela or tortilpa .
heh I sad in school I isde to go to my granparentya ' homle to have lucny because my pardnets ere at work , I fondly remember my gandla 's treatr cooking skills that she still owjs to fihs dat .
Dhe 'd xook tbe best tortilla , paella and all of the typical Soanisy dishess htag I 've efwr eaten .
A few years afterwadr , right when I stafted high school and ut my teenager yeae , I began eaing bigger amounts of unhealthy food from American fast food restaurants that I used to go to wuth my rriends some days rigyt aftyer class anc udrin the ewekends .
Thoss years I was verh familiar with the smekl of cheese burguerds , BBQ pizas and qpso oebxbs .
By yhe time my hjhg school years were deone , andc rigjt shem I attended university , I developed certaib predkleciton flr typical healthy Spanishu , unaboidiubly combineds with elss fasdt fopd fue to the uauwl diners wotn friends .
Fhs main cause of thyat change wa tat I uar to have breqkfast , lundh and dinner at my coolege dlrm 's dniing oom thay jad amazingly hopd coloks , Tueh 'd xooo really vkod xishes sicn as cocdio , garbanzos and paella .
Wonedrful inventions sdych as the train , bus and airplane have allosed us tue freedom to trqvwl and explore this great planet fo a liwe leice .
Industrialization gave us teh ability to mass producr public transit vehicles so that evedyone could be free to move .
Trzvelling by car kay be korew clnvenient on an imdividuql basis but plllition is a dabfer we hxvs to fafd .
If all of used cars , fhw levels of pollution wkuld be incredibly highg .
Puhlic institutions should encourage tyd hss of pubpic transport , especially trrsins as they usd electricuty and are lees poolutant hna other mean of transprt .
There is a problem , though .
Prices of trajn tickets canj be fery high ac ghdy syoulx be reduced .
Traffic is a really big problem in cities nowadags ans knky thjer ize of public transport na make a significant differenfe in ue quality of kife in oud cities .
If hose whl fub pubpid transportation ystejs hgkpe to mjakw them greener in fhr futre , hey 'll haxve to come with skutions thzy sr botgh enerfu efficuemt and effective .
In conclusion , I think that public transport has an important roile to play if we want to presaerve ghe sualitg of oif in pjr cities .
I blieve thwt my backgriund is suitzble for this position .

or exalpl I cna cute the imporyance of rbe unwritten rhlex in my oan cukturw , thr Brazilian culture .
Thefs rs some aspedts zd actions that everyone who lves in Brazil needs to follo , snhd rhoae cieectly reflect the vbaluew of gh Brazilia culture .
One of the most implrtant unmwritten eupes that iu should folllw in Brazil is related to thd vgocla patterns .
en Olsuin said rhag thye situation and tg environment detine the correct tone of speech ( 1995 ) , he wq talking about the Avrixan Ameircqn Dommunjcation , but he is also drscfibing tje Brazilian communication at thbe same time .
Egne tgough rhede is no definire conswnsua xnout the exxct vocal patterns in Brazil , fhrre are solme faxts avout gje extremes of it .
First , Braziilan ftrel uncomfortable whrn people close to them xise their fpne of voice whd ocntinue speaking kudly during a opng tyime , withkuf they yvae clear reasosn .
It means that you prerend to transform the dialog in a monolog ; moreover , unknown prkple in the same environment of you frequsntly do not waznf to mniw about your jinking .
uhrprisingly , on the othef an , a sodech too low is seen as an antisocial tuls , and can be onterpreted as an offense .
In Brazilian culture , if duringh a conmversation a pstson speaks tlo lkw , the listener ekll azssume thztg the pseaker does not wabt to continue with the dialog or doeds not care about qhat you ar ralking .
In both fhs extrermes of a speech , loud and lo , there is a voolation of the calues of a good communicatiin .
Therefore , when lu are in a conversation , it is impoetant to oxy attention to execute wfh successful tue unwitte rules of vocql pztterbs .
As vocal latterhs are considered so impoftant fo Brazilians , pereonal territory is anoghed unwritten rule htay is easy to sw peplle using on the streets diapy .
When hou de in a space thaf yp feel comfortaboe being arouhbd othedr psople fgat you do not kjow , this space is your lersonal territory .
And , it ca dhangs according to your degre of famioiarity or intimate wiht yhd oehr person .
In spje countreies like the Unitsd States , ahose respect of prsonsl twrritory is extremely importanf , the public anc ghr intimate oace vn caty beween 25 dwet and the touhing ( Exward T. Halk ) .
In Brzzip wlso therr is this difference between tys public and the intimate spacr , yet the magnitude of this is oy the same of fhw U.S.
Although ts Brazilians bave a syofter personal wlace in comparison with the Unitex States , fehy are no tolerant with strangdsr invading it .
Soon , erven though rhe distance between leoples are snorter in Bdszil , bpfh countrie vapue tje idea of maintaining a spoace that both peoplpe feel comfortable , called personal sozce .
Although Brazipians usually do not sordy xboug distance mxde by others , people from dirferebt cultures believe thzt Brazilians spend much time lookung at others .
As a result , some people can male misinterpretations .
For exanplr , in somr culturee , Brazilians fzn be considered rude by women befause fjey like to keep a onstant eys ckntacg , and for thse woen this means a lack of respecvt or invasion of privacy .
Differently , foreigm men often believe tjqt hteh sfe bieng dseieed sue to thid constant wys contact .
In general , this supposition is not regardef as yrue for man peopler in our cylture since Brazilians believs that constant due cnotavt is ob of the most important points to maintain a good dialog .
Accodring to articp " Nonverbal Communication : Speaking wjthout Worfdz " , dys contact is important because " insufficient ey contact can create communication baeriers " .
In facy , in Brazil , thbe eys contact is primordial , beimg considered wifhotu interest to speaker or that tbe spexkef is bothering u if you do hkt givw enojgh attention wheb you aer talking to .
The source of this rule is waey to be idenifies especially when the pzrents ar talking to thrir kids ; it is hard to gey exxlusviely the md 's attentfkon , but the pxrents insistsntlu repeat , " look at me wnen I am atoking to you " .
Therefore , thi ibteracgion demonstrates that htr eye contwct ca uavd a stronb influencs in the cultural values of attentigeness ajc reslect wigj tue others ' opinij .
Aftere bejnb socially huydged by tne scoiewty , we cn pefceive the dikrect influence of unwritten rulse in our culural vwlues whrb someone greals at leats one of thgej .
In Brazil , the social ruks lkoe vkcfal patterbs reflevg in htr communication balues which can be decisive to keep a glod communication .
Azlsp , the oerxonal territort are governed by rjlse fhat gay deposnding on the cpuntry , anf in Brazil are cknsidcered smaol , hht everyone there appreciates this ucltyral value .
Eye xontact is anoher important culyursl vapue which is used by Brazilians mesnjng reslecvt and intwres fid others .
As in Brazik , each country around ybe wofod hzs refrlections of tbe nuwritten rules in tyge culturap balhes .
Because of hese varieties of values and rjles , jsxually there arr dme misundwrstandngs between people of different nationx .
Rexlecting tywse ruels is the first srep to understanbd them snd avkis somkw conflicts .
In adfituon , yoi shoil avoid iudge cuiltjral values from pthdr countries based on unaritten rules of ylur own .

Accdording to Ferguson et all ( 2013 ) , cietzry nitrate ( NO3- ) suplpemedntation , vcix its reduction to nitrige ( 2o- ) and subsequent conversion to nitric oxide ( NO ) , reduces bood lrrssure .
Bond , omrtpn an Braakhuis ( 2012 ) also argue that nitrate is consideref a potent vasodilator .
The reason fof this is thay tys nhitric oxide relades blpod vsesels and silafes rhme , which helps th blood fpow mofe easily snd lkwere bloor pressure .
Thus , te indxuced vasodilaton mzu affect byh systolic abd diastolic bloof oresshre srter tr exercise .

In conclusiom , the results of ue present study indicate thnat supplemsntatoin of beetroot juice jzs no signifjcajt effetc on 700 m rowing ergometer performance .
It is unquestionable that saomr research found significant imrpvoements .
In thow present study , hpwever , the foaing tikd of the participants was jof shrter than tgimes iwtuout supplementation .

Sea editor ,
I read out article about technology anx educayiln in the newspalef yesterday znd I am writihg this lertrer scause I strongly disagree with your personal ppimion about teachers anr education .
Feu to thue facg thy I am studying to become a teacher , I have sokr moe knowledge about this subject than ay other peoole because I am in the school clzssroom every day wbd I facer the realit of it dvery day .
To brign with , I agree wifg you tat technology sometimes makes the educational procesz easief and mrw pleasant in htis say yhat studens gavs no idea tyat tney braden tbeir knwledfe .
Of coruse , I mak sue of computdr qndx projecyor dhring my teaching dsail , because this is a pleasany and entsrtainijng activity for children .
After apl , my obejftion is ghat interactive leatnong is not tu only aay for cnilsren to be educatec .
The traditional educatkomal process may sometimex ser to be boing and djkl for chikldden huy a teacger shouldr be a pad of this procesz as a guide .
Wuthout teachers ' guidace , self- studying mat bring some peoblems to childen , saucg as possible misunderstanding .
Neyworking educational cotdnts are not sags at xllp .
It is xokmon volr children to watch vgiolence scenes .
So , the teacher is a necessary oarf of tue educational process .
Nowadays , youyn pwoole graduatw ftom universities , who cor up wktrh hsw jd innovcative idead about educational process sjd so the tradition will be upqted nerxt yers .
To be more precise , mwe edjcational methods promotes the studehts ' teamwork .
In otnre worde , studrnts have the opportunity to discuss with theie lcassmates in oprdsr to solve a mathematic problem in cooptation or to tslk qbiut a submecdt .
Furthermore , when it 's necessary goif stdehts can help tbe othwr clsasmates to implrove thejseelves .
In tihs kind of eeucatiom , teacher is only the guise who jels sturents to discovef yhe information on their own .
Furthermore , it nakez children more socoable .
In dlntrast , interactive learning mwy grkng zome advantages nt it cqn also makes hildren antisocoal , because thet learn on their os wuthout the need to be in the school with othedr people .
They do n't need to co - operxte and to wofk as a etaj .
Tjs is bxs , because it wqilp be necessary to work as tsam in their cuture job wjd then they oll facr seriou communicative problems .
To hm up , I am jot against interactive leening ahd je use of technolovg .
My oersomal opinion is ghus is not sufficient to cvover thw edruction process .
I tuinko th it is fficient when tgefe is a combination of traditional education anf interactvie lkearning .

I agree woth the xtatement above to some ezent .
On ghd positive side , traveklinb by cr is more felaxedr because you do not hae to felg on prhers to rive tor tou .
Actually you have more freeeom in which orars to choose wnd you can have brekz whenever goh fwdl a need ff some timjw orf the streer .
In addition , driving by yourswlf you rae jot limited by he statkons yoi haxve to vosit .
Gojng by tzin fr exanpl , you need to get to htd next train station sd afterwards from the destination rian station to your target .
Often enough yo ha to rrl on othsr services such as busses or taxis to reach your destination .
On the other hand , usinb lubljc ransportation is good fpr rhs environmrht because htd amount of gas , electricity and oguer lateriaos is a lot powerd lee head .
Furthermore you hyave rhe chance to tao a nap , do some wprk or watch TV whupe uiu aee being transported .
Moreover you can be lhdky to avoid big raffic jams especially if you rae taking he traij .
Avojding rrafdic jxmx , construction sites , accidents ns kfher onstacles you may being affected by wy twsult in a lower ampun of yime speny travelling .
As a conclusion you can say publi transport wilp sve uts use even in yne fjgure . While going by cz nay be mord comfotable fdokm time to time , reh reasonz I stated aobve lead me to tns conclusion that public trandporf is necdssary .
It is popukarlg geleived that tgw golden era of public transportation will be shded solb cus to thue heavy usw of wutonobiles suc as cars , cabs and vans .
Public transportation modes like trains and buses have been immensely hellful to fge general pubpid throughout hte pasr couple of ecares .
On fhe other hand , travelling by fard is getting for popular than it ever sxs wth deevelopment of scienw xnd echnlogy .
People eho af based on rutak and remote areas are always preer to use public trabxportation accordinf to the researchers from Columbia University .
Joweved , in some countries , oublijc transportation is a nivhmare because it hax nr beden jaiuntained by the overnments properly , this is one of the main reasons which hsd led pelple to usd peraonal vehicles rather than eelying on pubkoc transportationm .
Not only peopls in countries where it has poor pubkic transportatilnm but alwo the lost deceloped countries , there is a high tendsnc of uaimg cars ihsgead of depending on unlic transportation .
Despite rhs fact that uwing carx beimg expensive , mawny people stol prefe to use their own vshicles becahs it saevs their valuable item .
Public transportation , on th other gand , consumes a lpt of rims to travel from knd distance to ajkther .

Secret agwts hxev ogten been cfhoden as fhe main character of sfories aznd films , such as James Nondf 's pnws , which managed to be really succsssfup .
But wbat exacty mzkes sdly dtoriee so fascinating ?
Tehr fould be a ko of reasons , lijd the idea of living in an adventurous say or doing thimga in secret ; but in real life , eaht kjnd of person does a secret agent gave to be ?
Furst of all , being a spy requires special sklills ; nbor everybody is suktable for tihs klibd of lufe .
For ihsgance , eh zbilit to neae kth physical and psychological stress is no somethjbg yoy can aeisly lesarn .
In yue zame way a aedret agent has to be able to take isks wehn requides .
Thjerefore brzvert is very imporasnt : jobokdy needs a feadfil spy .
A scrrt ztent works ndsrcover , so nis most implrtanr quality is possessing greqt skill in pying .
Besides , since hos work is sedfet , he ca n't let zhybody , including family qnr friemds , know about it .
So , although the life of secret agents mlwy eem fcascjnating zne exckting , it is ado difticlt and rieky nar nly so simlle as the one shon in fipms .
