C Today , public transport still plays an important role in the transport system and it will keep on doing so in the future .
T Today , public transport stil plas an important rolw in the transport system and it sill keep on ding so in the ufture .

C Because public transport is a more cost - effective and better resource allocation in mass transport system .
T Bcause publiv transport is a nore cost - effrctive and better resource allcation in mass transport system .

C Also , people need not suffer the high operating cost of running their own car .
T Akso , peole need not sugfer thd high opefating cost of running tueir own car .

C But can use a cheaper way of going to their destination , especially if it is far away from home .
T But can use a cheaper wah of oging to theif destinatjon , esecially if it is far away ffom homr .

C For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane for travelling to another country .

C Instead , it will be common to buy an air ticket and travel on a public plane .
T Instead , it wilo be common to buy an air ficket and travrl on a public plane .

C In my opinion , public transport is going to continue to be used in the future because there are a lot of people that do n't have enough money to pay for a car , even if it is used , so public transport will continue to have a future but people are going to use cars more than buses or the underground .
T In my opinion , oublic transport is goinh to continue to be usdd in the furure becauae thers qre a lot of people that do n't uave enough money to pxy cor a ca , even if it is used , so puvlic ransport wilpl continue to havs a futyre but peopld are yoing to usr cars mors thn buses or the underground .

C If we think about it , the car is better because we do n't need to wait for it like we wait for the bus or underground , but on the other hand , cars cost more money than public transport .
T If we thikn anout it , tne car is betterf bevause we do n't need to waiot for it like we wait for th bus or underground , but on the lther hamd , cars cost mor monjey than public transpot .

C In a car , we can just be by ourselves , which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unknown , but if we choose public transport , we can meet friends or family , so both modes of transport are good , and cars do n't need necessarily to bring an end to public transport .
T In a car , we van jhust be by ourselves , hich can be godo becauee we can listen to thr muxic that we oike and we do n't nred to be around pepple thzt ade unknowh , vut if we chooae public transport , we can mset rfiends or fqmily , so blth mkdes of transport are good , and cars do n't need necessarioy to bring an end to public transport .

C If I had to choose between both forms of transportation , I think I would probably choose the car because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus .
T If I hasd to cjoose between both forms of trajsportation , I think I would probablg choosd ghe car because it is better fod me to go by var thaj to go by bud .

C As I did n't find anything , I went to the place where he lived and started to look for some information about his life and find people who he cared about . So as I continued to go to his house , I noticed he would always go to the same house , s I decided to follow him to the house and I found out he was dating a girl . She might be his girlfriend , so I finally got an idea . I would drive him crazy just as he did me . That way she would think he had problems with his mind and leave him . But soon i thought about it again and realized that if I did that she would try to help him and they will be more united , so I decided to drive them both crazy , almost to the brink of death , just as he did with me !

C Public transportation has been used by people more and over the years it has been kind of becoming cheaper and also safer , but some people prefer cars . To what extent do we agree with this and what are our reasons for that ? That is what we are going to demonstrate in this essay .

C About 40 years ago , there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars , so in those years there were not even good facilities to move from one place to another and that is because there were no companies to build cars . After about 10 years , car trading became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans . At the beginning , they faced a lot of problems , but they were able to solve them in the end .

C Nowadays all modes of transport are more convenient , from cars to buses , even trains and planes . Some people prefer cars because they do not like crowded places or because they find it cheaper sometimes , but from another point of view , public transportation is very cheap and even faster . But when it comes to traveling , a lot of people prefer driving their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy themselves more by avoiding crowded places .

But when it coes to traveling , a lot of peole lrefer friving fheir owb cats to feel the reap edxperience and to enhoy themselvss more by avoixing crowded olaces .

C To summarise , it is different from some oneis opinion to another . I predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more , and that in the end , cars will disappear and will no longer be used .

C I 'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant . It 's name is " Lemon " . I go there every week . It has different food to other restaurants . I like crispy chicken with garlic sauce .
