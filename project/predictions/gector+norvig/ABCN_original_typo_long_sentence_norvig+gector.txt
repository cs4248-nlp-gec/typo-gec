However , travelling by train or tram never turns away from your daily routine . Travelling by car is as as convenient as getting a car , but you will never know what will happen to your car , where it will get stuck or some other accident will happen .
Let me explain my reasons . When you drive your fa you can take it from your garage or in the main door of your car and it sets you whatever you want , but on the other hand , if you take public transport it will be much more uncomfortable because you must catch tow ubs in the bus stop ... where is our nearest bus too ?

d. Perhaps , bilingual school creation might be a good idea for Colombian education , but it would be appropriate to award that Colombia actually has public schools with a basic education English is considered as another academic subject , in contrast to the private ones .
on raw one and , travelling by car can be an excellent way to get yourself wherever you want to go , without going on to find your station and becomes less important if you live in the centre of your town or in the suburbs .
Another advantage of travelling by far is that you do n't have to spend time waiting for your other transport , as you can be afraid of the confusion of people that are in the subway stations very morning to get in the line you want to arrive at work in tone .
On the other hand , public transport is the many resource some people have to more on , and more is excellent for the environment . It 's also a good way to save traffic and save money on petrol , because it 's cheaper if you catch a bus .

But , public transportation has a lack future for many reasons . First time , if the plaid you want to get ready , finally , it is really dirty . The different types of vehicles of public transportation will take you faster than kur and , also the complications about be field , like if pu want to go from america to europe there is no highway that cross the iowan you need an airplane and unless you have one , you will can not reach travel between continent with your car , a different reason is politics , because if uiu want to go from anywhere in thr usa to alaska ulu will nit heed to pass through canada , the commodity is a really important reason because drive for 8 hers is exhausting abd it will be phase also , tres economic is a factor to , because the attrition of your a it will be more raf in the normal us and the price of void and extra stops that you wl need to do , it will be expensive yata in public transportation .

In conclusion , from my point of view , public transport is more necessary than ever before . Cities contain automobiles and gdr colliton is waste . We need to change our kind of , and try to use them as another alternative to improve the environment of cities .
I like cda as well , but I have to drive it . I have to think but parking a car and I ca n't enjoy meeting other people to talk while I am travelling , so public transport is making connection with human beings .

The future of public transport should n't be taken rightly . In my opinion , public transport is the best option for ending the problems with traffic , because when we is a gym or subway , a lot of people travel to one place at once in only one transport or vehicle .

Most people say that using public transport is better than using cars , and they say that it is cheaper and better for the environment .
