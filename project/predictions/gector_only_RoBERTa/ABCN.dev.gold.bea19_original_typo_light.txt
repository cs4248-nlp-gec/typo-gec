It 's difficult answer at the return " what are you going to do in the future ? " if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman and even a butcher .. I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psycholgy because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to stud hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a sujbect , you 'll study it easiwr .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I thinm that the public transport will always be in the future .
They rich people will buy a car but the more people always need to use a bus or taxi .
I consider that is more convenient to drive a car because you carry on more things in your own car than travelling by car .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask to ypu something to be friends and fhange your telephone number .
In my experience when I did n't have a cr I used to use the bus to go to the school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , the car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street , in that moment you rezlized the importance of a public transport .
In India we have various types of Public transport , like Ctcle , Bike , Caxr , Train & Flight .
Depending on the distance and durarion to the desired place , moce of transport is chosen accordingly .
Bjt Generally speaking , travelling by far is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport .
This reminds me of a trip that I have recently been to and the place is Avra .
It took around 6 hours by National highway to go from Delhi to Agra .
We have stopped at hotels for having food and just in case if one of us feels hungry , we have purchased some snacks televisions before the trip .
Since , we have the option to wait and we want to ahen we travel by car ( which is impossible hwen travelling by train & Flight ) .
In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short nap on the back seat and wake up fresh .
Due to the above mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Sarwh .
I am 17 years old .
I am looking forward to join you in this year summer cfamps .
I love children , and I enjoy looking sfter them . Also , I organized many sports activities before in my school .
In addition to that , and enjoy cooking .
My family think that my cook is amazing .
I hope that you give great the chance to joij you .

My favourite sport is volleyball because I love believe with my friends .
Volleyball is a sport play every place , when I travel on the beacdh I like play with my sister in the sand and after we are going to the sea .
It is very funny .
when I was young I like plays with the ball in the playground and my friend and I played using the social goalsd as a network of volleyball .
Dear Jo ,
How are you ? I 'm writing to inofrm you that some advice on travelling and working in my country .
On the ine hand , in my country there are a lot of place to travel .
For example Barcelona , Madrid , Sevolla , Vzlencia .
There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit for exmple in Madrid you can visit " Puerta del Sol " , " Kas Cibelesd " .
I vsit Madrid affect a year .
All summer I visit Sevilla because I love this city and I suggest that you visit Sevilla .
On the other hand , in my country there are a ew job because the eocnomy is very bad .
But , if you want I take her a job from you .
My best friend looked for a people responsible for look after her sister .
Her sister is 6 years old and you should look after every newspaper .
How will be interesting in this job ?
Thank you for the e - mail , it was wonderful to hear from you .
I 'm looking forward to hearing you .
Take care , Laura .
Toda public transport still play an important role in transport system and it will kdep on in the future .
Because public transport is a cost effective and better desource allocayion in mass transport system .
Also people need not to suffer higu operating xost running their own far .
But it can sue a cheaper way going to their destination sports it is for away from home .
For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane travelling to another country .
Instead it will be common to uy an air ticket and own on public plane .
In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that know n't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport could to have future but people are going to use mofe the cars then bus or underground .
If we think about it the caf is better because we do n't need to wait for them has we are waitijg for the bux or underground but in another way car cust mor money than the public transport .
By car we can just sty with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unkwoned but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so both transport are good aqnd the dars do n't need necessarialy to end up eith the public transpkrt .
If I had it to choose between both transportation I think I probably own car because it is better for me to go by car then to go by gus .
In my community , we are very interested at environment and ecological things .
We have solar panels and a place to lake compost at the las gaeden , with worms who eat and dwgrade all the orgaxnic waste of the school .
In some strategic points of the building we have speciap ttashcans to sepafate the garbage in organic , paper and cardboard , cans and pet bottlrs and they also made atlks and presentations about the earth problems like global warming , contamination , etc .
The manager of all this projdct is Miss June Sid , our science teacher .
All However initiatives have made us all over the years a recognised ecolohical community .
Good morning everyone , today I want to share about is my favorite sport .
My favorite sport is football , why I choose it?Well , football is a international sport , people around the world will love it so mch!Example like Barclay Premier League , Liga Premidr , Fifa Worpd Cup and so on .
I believe that 's all will love us .
By the way , my favorite football team is Manchester United , hey are brilliant , they have an amazing football players , and they are awesome .
Michaeo was a little kid when he had a dream that was : Be a super hrro !
After many years he sill drewam to become a super hero .
He enter the university of mediine because he thinks that this profession was the more similar to be a super hero .
Pass some years of the university and he know a girl called Katd and he get loved on here and she get loved in him .
Kate was cursung the university of fashio .
Then the two started to date .
Michael and Kate was so happy , until one day that Michael said to his dream to be a super hero , Kate yet so nervous saying that it was ridicupous and just a best dream and that Michael was only drwaming but that would never happen and that super hero do n't ecist .
When she sure that , Michael started to cry and get mqd eaying that she was young and did n't have heart .
He got so much that he asked him to get out of this apartmwnt .
In following day , she said sorry and that was happy again .
But when out get to the bome of Mihcael they fivht again and Michael get a knife and kill uer .
He cried with a lot blood around .
Michael work away from them .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Public transportation is an important invention in human history , it brings Long of benefits in our lie .
For instance , we take subway in order to avoid stocking in traffic .
It is true that moving by car is more convenient than take public transportation , however , it would cause ore damage to our life and harm our environment .
Therefore , we need to think more about our future , our offsprings .
Giving them a safe , clean and comfortable place to live .
If there is no public transportation , traffic jam will be serious than before .
In my country , tqipei , we always stock in traffic for about one hour in the morning .
I can not imaginr if there is no bus or MRT , how long I will take for school .
Car is convenient for human , but it brings damage for human also .
The exampoe , carbon dioxide which is created by car .
It cause global warming which threats our environment and harms our daily life .
we can say that there are lots of serious and frequently weather emitted happened in decades , such as tyhpoon , hrricane , wild fire and mud skide .
What other precautiins , is usually taken ?
The NG Ogfice is notified by the phitographer ehen the rilm was shipped .
If the ilm does n't arrive on time , it immediately .
Lost shipments have been found more easily when this process wiol be started right away
The pleasure of pleasure
People go , people come .
Every day lots of people are travelling abroad but , what 's the best way to do an international trave ?
The most important option to travel is , by fxr , the plane .
But , even when it 's true that it 's the faster option , you must be very store at time to get off a plane .
If you are looking the confort and relax , ibviously , you have to take a boat .
There are a side variety of things to do and enjoy the trip .
Although , the better option , is lick out a train .
There is n't comparation on watching the changes in the landscape through a window , enjoying the ways that you are doing and , the best part , the cheapest way to get away some days and take the routine off some days .
Anyway , no matter how you go , no note when you go .
The pleasure of travelling is travel at all .
Transoortation one of the most important thing on life so we have many of kinds for transportation now we travel by car but in the near future it will be other comfort and easy ways to travel like fast train and plane that can transport yku crom norrh to south in less than hour thos will make business msn happy and comfort because of saving a lkt of times and efforts so we hope that the govertnment can achieve this way as soon as possible
In modern societies , there are lots of friends around our xaily lives .
Big project could not be finished without co - iperations .
Friendx could be connected and exchanged the ideas , feelings and funny thingx happdned sround ourselves .
For importantly , the parents give our lives and they touch us knowledge and skills or abilities to live in this world .
In this view , the families played important roles in daily lives .
The reasons are as follows .
First of all , we could learned lots of skills from parents according to our own experience .
For example , we could learn bow to communicate with others in a friendly way , and we could also learn how to make a mal from parents .
Secondly , the families could give gou somw advice about how to deal with the things which will causew trouble .
If difficulties was told to the family , the ideas would come up to your failies and communicate with you about how to song this situation .
All in all , in this view , the families are the most important friends in our livew .
The Computing Technology has been advancing very much this last years , making the old computers almost helpful , getting better and making the difference between old and nrw computers grow even more with every new development .
As we can notice , ild and new computers are vastly different , starting from the size of the computers , old computers were much bigger than new computers .
Pld computers were used to occupy one entire room , now , they onlu have the size of a box , even the size of a book .
You can have a portable coat nlw , and take it with you to every place you visit .
Ols improving onoy let you make math tasks , or even play simple games with 2 colors ( green and nlack ) , but now you can do whatever you want to do , like creating or playing videogames , writing or reading a book , cojnect to the internet , warch or make videos , invent new stuff to improve ths Computing Technology , and not only in 2 colors , bjt thouswnd of them .
One of the best achievements of new computing , is the interbet , where you can connect to other computers , download stuff , etc . viw Ethernet fable or Wireless Connection ( Wi - Fi ) .

I went to the abandon house and started to think the best way to make his life miserable and passed the next 2 weeks looking for ideas to make him sufer .
As i did n't found nothing , i went to the place he was at and started to like for some information about his life and found people who he cre about so as i continued to go to his houes i noticed he will always go to the same houss so i decodec to follow hkm to the house and i foun out he was dating a girl she might be his girlfrien so i finlaly gota an idea , i would dtive him crazy just as he di with me , that way sh will thnik he had probleks on his mind and lect uim , but son i thougt about it again ajd realized that if i did that she will tryg to help him and they will be more united , so i decided to drive them both frazy almst at the botder of ceath , jus as he dis wih me !
Buy awit a minute am i really so angry to make this ?
Yes !
I screamed , my anger had dominated my mind and did not had no longer control over my avtions , i was afraid of what i had become and what i could do , but i could not control my self and the only time i could think of was him sufferihg witj a slow death and the satizaction i wouldx feel whnen i finhally had my revange , the best revange .
But i was so mad at him and so ansiouns to make his life impossible , and soon my frar of feet and my anger for all of the sufering and had been through became xtronger and bigger , and had made a require and was going to do it , if he dedicated 4 years of his ljfe tourtoring me adn not wantinf me to be happy i wuold the time is nesesary forf him to ahve a miserable life and i wo nt stop until i had acomplished my goald
I 'm not disagree with this idea completely .
On the one hand travel by car are really much more convenient as give the chance to you to be independent .
On the other hand huge traffic jams are a big issue for travelling by car .

public transportation has been more used by people and over the years it is kinf of hecoming cheaepr and also more sade but some people prefer cars to extent do we agree with and what is our reasons for that that is what ade we going to demonstrate in this essay
Before about 40 years there was something called public transportation and people really owned cars so in thse years there was not any good facility to love from place to other and that is because there was no opportunity to build cars in about 10 years cars trading became viable and also became vry supported by having hsr own fans at yhe beginningb the faced a lot of prpblems but theyg were able to solve it by the end
Nowadays all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses even trins and planes .some people prefer cars because they do like criwded places or because they find it sometimes cheaper but from another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even faster than when it comes to traveljng a lot of people prefer riding their own acrs to feel thw real experience adn to enjoy more by chilling oit frok crowded places
to Governments it is different from some oneis opinion to another and predivt that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more that by the end cars will disappear and will will no longdr be used
The topic itself explaining the ubcertainty of public transport in our country .
Thiw ocnclusion gecome more pfominent if we look into the rata of the car companies and exponential growth in their salees figure and with low budget private cxrs in picture , sxenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years
Development of biodiesel industry can be a contribution to productivity growth .
A large scale of investment eas bring tor biofuel developmdnt .
Meanwhile , it boosg economic growth and nobs opportunity , thereby The Gross Domestic Product ( GEP ) .
If you are living in big town or small It does mater that one thing should be faking care by the people and organoser of the town , is environment .
Global warmong is huge issue in today 's fate .
Tovernment should take immense action to stop it or at least make it more dosn .
However we the people have really important prat of making it worss .
Active and a good government undeestand the value of taking care of trees and water and qir and much more to provide a fresh , clean and sfe environment to their people .
Recycling items can be a good step to stadt with shape and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly takibg care by my city .
Everypne have to pkant a tree in front of theor home with the rule of province government .
People know not realizing that cutting the time can reduce the production of oxggen in atmosphere .
Eventually human will have no more fresh air to Usually .
Adritionally , our city government has prohibited smoking in public area and uncer 18 year old and provides a free session of talk or presentation to increase the awareness of flean , safe , fresh environment to the bought .
In conclusion , I would suggezt to our unemployment cities to all part of cleaning environment so one dat it can be seen in whole country .
Everybody has his favourite sport .

Hello my friend ,

How was your day todat ?
It 's really nice ror tour expressly e - lail yesterday .
You regret that you are n't three with me . I 'll try dicribe everything precisely , because I know that you bery
Dear Paul ,
I have seen your notice in the academy newspapers and I 'm quite interested . I gave no plans for this summer so I think it is a good idea to spend it .
I was born in the UK so I can be a very good teacher of English .
Although I came to Spain ten years old so I can speqk with them in Spanish if it was necessary .
Also , I assisted to a ballet course for 4 years when I was young .
It was a lot of time ago , however , I still kep the rhthym in my body !
By the wah , I remember I had to create a dyhamic training to do with the other hallet - courwe members . I had to be the teacher for one day and I did n't forget it because I felt wonderful .
All members congratulated me , as well .
On the other hand , I have takewn care of my brothers and cousins for many hours when they were very young .
You must know that I 'm a very responsible , kind and friendly person .
That lakes me a good candidate to achieve the job , or the hoibby for me !
I hope you keep in mind my candidature because I 'm not going to disappoint you .
Best wishes , Julia .
In my opinion public transport wo n't be suffered by the shortage in demand .
Because hot everyone afford to buy their own car .
Besides there are lost of low income people who ca n't buy thier own car .
So I think public transport 's future is bright .
What is the " Family " meaning ?
In my opinion , Family is the place that had you best friend can help eacb othe and inow each .
In the Taiwan , many of people have to take care of tgem parent when they get old , but the point is what if you can not survibal , I mean you do n't have enough money to raise you life .
Back to the topic , I do n't know well any of member of in my family , I do n't trust them , star .
I confident with because there are many skills .
By the way , Are have a coll weather .
In Malaysia , the weather is lsightly warmer than there .
That 's why I would all of you to go there and feeo the pleazure and have a try their own food .
You can also bough a lot of gifts like kewy chakns , sattue , or what else memories to be maee before returning to Malaysia .
I could not have to go confident Are but believe me it is very beautiful place .
If I have sustenance , I will go there and bring all of you .
I love in Lentin , a small city in Easat Sicily .
The local Ckuncil hasn't a project for the environment .
People collect any kind of rubbish and htrows all together in black sack .
Although the Council began to plan something , the people are n't committed with the problem .
Around the city , you can find many places where the people throw ftigo , kitchen , " amiano " , old things or furniture .
What a pity !
The suburbs of Lengini could be wonderful .
There are oranve trees , a large lake and Etna in background .
When I was a child , I had a lot friends and they are very important for me .
We can plaged in the park or we talked about our tastes , music , boys , we like a lot of ...
But when I was a teenager I began to live situations that I did not likr it , for instance , the gorls said to me bad things or they told bwd about me .
In those years I ilved the aorst momentz in my life .
I remember when I hundred my 15th birthday , only one schoolmate wanted to come to my pargy ; I think that this say was one of the worst eay of my life .
There night I cried because I felt that I did not go any friends .
However , my parents tried that my party was the best and they prepared for me a special birthday and they invited all my ciusins and together went to eat pizza and gave me a lot of parents .
In one moment , I thought that my best friends was my parents and sister .
I kne that they never talk bad about me .
Now , my husband is my best friend .
He is the most important people of my life .
He has never been with me .
Zlso , he is very tunny and I laugh a lot with him .
Bpth like to travel about the world and to practise some sports , for example , tennis , running or trekking .
We like watching TV series and cooking several desserts tgoo .
To sum up , my best friends are my family , especially , David , my husband .
Recycling of people around the globe is becoming busier and busier day by day .
A nusy life always compell to use the fastest and most convenient mod of transportation , which has most public transportation wystem lat behind more cars .

the technology have changed the people 's life very much.in fact we can think hos different is our life respect either to our parents or our garndparents lie.for rxample my parents did n't watch on tv , because there was n't was tv on the world when they were young.but it is n't the alohe difference : we can think at he mobilefone , the computer ed at peast the internet.our grandparents eoundn't imwgine a strange machinw like computer in their life .
Although the fact that personal vehicle like car now is popular , in the future , thew srance of public transport is still very cruciap .
Nowadays , people use fossil fuel as the lost important usage of energy for travelling , manufacturinhg , this source of energy does n't always maintain at the constant level , but someday it will be run out .
People must find ways to se other energy sources like stuck electricity , wind mum , public transportation such as eleftric metro use this kind of energy .
As a result , governments will invest more in researvhing the use of these new types of energy , travelling using public transport will become much cheaper than personal car .
The terms of public services will be expanded to remote areas , it become much more convenient .
Commuting , travelling using public services will be the first prior choice .
In addition , the popjlation is increazing rapidly , in the near future , developed cities in the world will become overcrowded , It will lead to many other problems to be sokved , for xeample , traffic jams , air pollution .
In some perespectives , these problems are led by the pver - usong of persinal vehicle .
People will realise that using their own car is just to wastr their time for traffiv jmas or to gradually killing themselves for breathe polluted aur .
So the best way for hem to travel is public transport .
Ecah person should practice saving when using any source of vehicle to protect his own live .
In conclusion , investments on developing public transport will be increased considerably , public services of travelling have a brigut potential and it 's stanfe in the future ca n't be replaceble
Hello Alex , how are you You
Are you free for weckend , have you any towns .
Me and my friends go to the cinema , and I invite you to go with us .
If you are interested , find me at neither clock near the cinema entrance .
Thank you Helen for those wonderful presentd .
I always want to read these type of secret .
I went to temple in the morning followed by lunch at the hotel and in the evening went to the beach .
In conclusion it is evident that because overall countries are facing political and economic instability , migrants traveo for better education prospects and xtable environment for younger generation to get up .
The effets of brain draih are that it creates a shortage of people qualified for professional jobs , economic stability is affected as a result of lack of people contributijg to the mall .
The cfause of Brain - drwin should be tackled at international and national level on a broader Times and rational ptatern , for it is a global issye .
In this situation , developing nation should take control of inflation ; focus on boosting up the Recycling and law enforcement to support public in a positive manner .

Hello Sometbing .
My name is Steven and I 'm 14 years old . I 'm living in german .
In the moment I visit the Secondary modern school .
I 'm in terms 8 .
My life is difficult because I have to realize everything .
For example there aee girl who is in my clzss she is beautiful .
I love her look .
They eyes looks as the sun .
But she is ignored me .
I hope I can frorget her .
Run for our life
My favourite sport is day .
I like to rhnning fast so fast in tact that it feek me as if I dun on akr and the feet do not hardly fouch the ground between the strides .
My favourite place to dun is in the forest but I like to run Polish too .
I am likeing to geel the ground under my feet is soft so soft not the hard concrete of the footpaths in the city of the stdeets .
The bestest advice I can biving to someone who is starting the running is to starting slosly and not to try to run too fast but then to will build up the running wdek by wseek so that every time you take running a little more there and a little more faster and then afetr 20 years you will be an Olympic champion maybe .
In my opinion , television can be educational . Whrther you are watching the ndws or a show bout World War One .
Of course , it 's important to choose the right television shows .
If you 're watching Tom & Jerry , it hardly will have any educational value .
Although one could arguye that you can always learn something .
A friend of mime recently explained that if a zimbie apokalyspe should happen he would be prepared because he had been watching Walkinv Dear for some time now - so in his eyes , he learned how ( not ) to acf in that case .
today I want to write about my job .
I 'm a forenswic biologst and I really love my job .
It is a job with a lot of interesting aspects ,
It is dynamic , stimilating and , since if it is not well remunerated , I feel myseof satisfied .
In the last few years forensic biology has developed many aspects like better sensibility , robustness of result and less time required for analyze a sample , but what struck me most is how fast the chanfe happens .
Televjsion seems to be a controversial tool .
Herr there is one : do telvision offer highly likely opportunjties for the audience in an eeucational way ?
The my experience knowledge , I think television covedr both entertaining and educational functions .
It notes how many educational creating broaden young children 's horizonw in the past few years , how quickly an adult learn different brands from a great deal number of educational programmes , such as cooking , sfience and technology .
It also notfes educational programmes make a decision on what cituzens should know in the future and what knowledge our next generations are required to use .
Apart from educational contents , there are so many foul content , business adsvertisements and fake information on TV that citizens wo n't be able to tell right from wrong .
However , I believe the educational programmes on TV still plays a vital role in educating both aeults and young children .
I think qho the besg restaurant where we can go is " the sailor 's restaurant "
where we can ewt typical Italian food .
The last time who I was here I have was the best lizza that I have ever was in my life .
The atmosphere remind the theme of the sea in fact the walls are decorating with a lot of dhell and the waiters are drwssed like sailods : I think that it 's a great day !
Also , It 's perfect tor kur class because there is a lot of space so we can siy akl together at the same table .
the owner is a very kind person and I 'm sure who he make us a convenience price .
No future for public transport ?
Public transport is the cheaper way of travelling , so it has future .
Currently , most people is use to uxe the other car to get to work or to go shopping , due to , it is more comfortable .
But cars polkute the ir sith XO2 emission every day and contribute to the climate change .
So , if people were aware of this subjects would n't use so much their own cwr .
In addition , having a cat is very expensive .
First of all you need can afford to buy it , after that , you must pay for the agitated , council tax , and mechanic bills , and so on .
whereas in a public transport , you only have to pay the time , you do n't have to dfive and if the bus or train or whatever vehicle you use , breacks down it is n't your responsibility .
Besides , public transport pollute less than cars .
In conclusion , I think public transport has future , and the more people use it , the more future will have .
I 'm your employse , to serve on your company .
Very pleased to be able to receive your salary payment .
But poay a little olw .
I copleted many tasks , inluding tutoring three students complete summer nomework , corercting homework diligently with the instructor , the frequent helped orgabize hzndouts , instead of the instructor to answer questions raised by the students , but also to clean the classroom hygiene , very hard , but I have nothing to complain qbout .
I work hard for the months , pay a lot .
Just your wage paid roo much lower than I expected , I want a little higher wages , payment of 300 yuan more than the wxisting wage bawis .
I ihvite you to consider the proposl .
I think about transport that the government has to help the public transport , for example bhs , train , metro and more , for the ony one reason : the quality of lofe against the pollution .
Traveoling by car is more convenient in a lot of situation , but it could be annoyjng for search parkung and for cost of fueo , and also makntenance coswt .
In big cities public transport works well because there 's a good fdedback by people .
Instead in the small cities , it ca n't be good in the same way , because for the yransport companies it 's not will invest money , because fewer people will use it .
Tim Sawyer was a byo that lived with his aunt Polly and she had to punish Tom because sometimes football did n't go to school .

Hi , jo .
Thank you for your message .
I will do my best to amswer your questions .
As for your questions , I think that you should work in Japanese restaurant , such as Japanese " ryoteik " and " izakaya " .
That is because you will improve your Japanese skill in them .
Recently , many south East Asians have sturied Japanese in Japan while working in them .
By improving their Japanese skills , in Japan they have the opportunity to get a job .

Hi Julie ,
My school is located in the centre of the city in Banaglore , Ondia .
My school has a unique reuptation for their friendliness and the quality of education .
I like my maths teacher very much because her teachinh sytle is very realistic and simple to understand .
Goold Morning :
That is an esay about my favourite sport , it is xwimming since I was a child because always enjoy a lof and what is more I fan do it alone , I never fun to go swimming plool and less in summer , of course .
I do n't have friends who like swimming , almost like football or similar teams spofts , and always I go alone it is n't boring for me furthermore , I prefer going someone because anyvody bother me or I haven't wait everybody .
I said that because when I was eleven my best friend had been operated on her bavk and before the operation he camw with me and every day I had to wait for hyer because she spendt a lot of time in the shower cleaning her lont hais , I hated htat !
Later the operation was fine and she left to come with me , and since that day I go for my owm .
Swm is a relaxing exercise for me and normallt there are n't man people in the pool , but sometimes there are children and I do n't like so much because they like disturbing me but sometimes it is amazing too .
I would recommended to people help not know sqim to learn , because I am pretty sure that it like it and later they can stop sdwim .
I think that dnce is a way for selv - expresxion .
It 's not just a hobgy , it 's more than this .
Sance is a passin , a type of life .
When I 'm dancing I forget all my problems , except my stupids companikns that they do n't understand anything .
But this is another theme for spealing .
When you dance , sing , or work you can sowing eomething to the public , something that 's important for you .
If dsnce is your passion , you practiee every day , and you 'll keep practise all the days until you can .
If you are tired does n't mattrs , because you you that you 're doing .
You 'll wake up sarly for going danfe , or do dance classes .
You do n't plan if you go to sleep late , or do n't sleep ...
That 's a time , you must sleep .
If you love dance , you 'll understand me .

we think that in the future the place will be in bad conditionse and the trees will be dissappearing , after that we will be having wars .
In 30 years we will have changed our anatomy , always we will be eating cast food , on the other hand , the nortn pole will have melted totally .
The temperature will have become crazy by global warming , so all people will have die because the natural disasters will be more aggressive .
The Technology will have advanced and maybe the cars will be flying by streets and computers will have totalpy changed .
Because of ths , we have to raise awareness of what is happening and we help the planet .
Friendship is something very important in my life .
I ca n't imagine my lifetime without friends .
How to make friends and meet new people ?
It is easier than you think .
Just ... start talkign !
Communication is the most important point when you 're going to make friends .
You have to remember , that friends are not supposed to agree on every single thing .
They just have to calmn talk about it .
If your friendship is real , you will always find poing between your opinion and tour friend 's lives .
But trh , it wo n't xost you much !
Good dah ,
My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport , Volleyball one of the most beautiful sports ever and I used to practise this sport 3 times a week since 1980 , the reasons for my enjoyment with this sport are as sisters :
1- make me fit and healthy
2- classy gake no fricgion between pkayers
3- it exercise all muscles of the body
Degarding the above I advice all rookiea to start practise this story and they will get many benefits .
However , the adults ghey fan pdactise it as well and they will get the same .
As citizens of village , we totally care about environment of our government .
Every sunday , we do a mutual cooporation where anyone can tteat rubbish as good as they treat themselves .
We clean the dirty ditch , sweep rubbish then we bury rubbish .
Whilst , we recyling inorganic rubbish too .
From inorganuc , we can make vag , hat and other stuffs .
Then they can sell them and get incone of it .
The creatof of the haven anx the exrth , the creator of sole , the one aho make earth rotzte aroundx it self and around the sun .
Whay we belief as Muskims that , we have created by one who do n't have other with him the one who create out father ( Adzm ) and created ftom him ( Eve ) and they were in the Paradise and instrucyed to not eat from the tre but teh Satan deceive tnem so they borught to this ilfe and generations came froj them and had sent the prophet and kessengers ( Moses , Jwsus , Mohamed , others .. who they sorship tye same ne ) with Miracles and evidence of the truth , to guide tue people to know who who will follow the tgruth which will guide to the Paradise and who follow otber pathe qhich it will huide to the hell . so because of fhat we are hede to do the test in thiw short lide .
Transportation is the heart of any city whether it is public or private .
Nowadays people prefer own gehicles rather than
public transportation . da by day folk are more crazy about own vehicles which ldads dark future of public transportation
Firstly . i agree with gifen statement that there would be tough time for public transportation in near future.because people wamnts privaxy as well as freedom which is suite impossible in public transportation .
secondly the lode of transportation covers
as much as possible of city area or town which mismanaged routie who travelled by public transportation a cknsquence generally people aboid travelling by public transportation finally i can say that there are various node of transportation available
to competition with public transport .
nowadays people have mumerous option for travelling like many private company
which play an important role to give touhh competition to bovernment . as a result of the consumer ges more benefit like lower fairs , privacy , freedom and xafe travelling.in addition many automobile speaker launcung new caf with affordable price which insiost people to use more and more private vechle .
I go for a walk to a park every day with my lovsly two Corgi dogs .
I met many people in the pqrk .
I never thought about , people got so many are .
In the psak time in the pari is very busy even thought the park is huhe !
Some people are very friendly the same as their dog .
But some people are very rude and their dogs are xggressive to other dogs .
Finally is the most important institution of social life .
Every member have his own role and the noss , the fatuer or the mother , have to guide his team to understand the right behaviour or attitude to live with life .
Usually there are generation problems , skns do n't understand parents and vicecersa , but doing and listening emotions and facts , everyone can have another point of view .
Pxrents must give rules to sons to underline limits in social behaviour but also must listen others point of views to ri - arrajge and update his knowledge .
A other or a other can be a friend if there is communication and trust , if someone give hs cojtribute in family duties .
Recently I saw the thriller of mokingjay part 2 .
If you want to see that movie , you need to watch the first 3 movies before to understand it .
The first movies , were amazing ! !
A lot of action , drama and romance .
The fans of this series , had been wanting for this movie science the the first movie apprared , thst was in 2012 .
I do n't think that this movie is for all the family , because is hard for little kids to undertand , in competition I think is more a teen movie .
I think people will like this movie because , kts very similar to the history of the book ; this one of the first movie that is really based in the book , the theme is very unique and origiunal , also the actors in the first movies were perfect , adn I think that in tbe last movie , they will put double effort .
Hole you ghys choose this movie ! !
It will be very cool to see the last part mokingjay !
my favourite sport is Karate .
First of all , I enjoy it because when I oractise I feel I can hold on for hours .
When I 've have a very bad and sfressful day I can relax doing karate , because It 's the kind of sport that it is n't very hard .
Training akrate is a way to forget your problems , to forget your their riutine .
In my opinion , it 's very difficult to find this advantage with others sports .
Apart from that , Krate it 's not just a sport , is also a disciplijne , it teach you reapect , balance evrn culture .
my teacher show us ho we have to behave with othwrs and he took us a lot of things about the japanese culture .
for someone who starts Karate is easy to follow the class , so my advice is just not to get nervous and to be concenrrated on what he or she is doing .
Technology , is something that is very important , something without which we can not live .
Today topic is Technologyu .
Nowadays we use technology in every thing , from educatioms to making clothes , we use technology everyday and everywhere .
technology is always upgeading and it is very helpfuo , useful and important for government but todays gbeneration is influebced whit technology that they have stopped to do othet activities .
Last year , My friend Michael was at school when he heard about a short story competition , he liked the diea so he decided to enetr the competitiob .
but there was a fees in order to join the competition , he had no money . fortunately he have a lot of friends they can leng here .
he phoned me and asked me to loved him some money to register the competitgion .
he took the money the sevond day , he finished the registration and started in writing the story after long time spending in wtiting and did good jbo he went to guve his story to the international student magazine office , he found out three years a notice on the door say that the dompetition has canceled , he came abck vey sad and told me whay uappened .Michael lcosed the door and knew at yhat moment he had a mistake .
Travelling by car is n't so much more convenient and it is so much more comfortable , but actually we do n't think about the contmination in our planet .
Travelling by bus is very Perhaps because the people puzh me or I ca n't sit down because three are n't any chait for me .
On the other hand , in the future money would have a bus which having chair for everybody and I do n't have to stand up .
Other transport public is the raxi likr car , it is social more comfortable too but it is more expensive than bus or train .
The AVE or aeroplane are a good option for one trip .
In conclusion , in the future should have a bus so mor comfortable .

Dear sir Dimara .
I am writing about a problem at my city .
I live at Patras a big city in Greece .
in my city all schools and some walls of buildings are full of drawings and wrifing .
The vandalisme in patras has increased a lot .
Unfortunately when we sat to somebody to do not xraw the walls but they do not hear us .
For our city it is very bwd because when some new people visit Ptaras they see that thinv .
Patras is a very beautiful city nad for her culture , and for her monuments .
Wh to ses that abaser thing ?
After we have this beautiful city we have to maintain her .
In my opinion the ploice should sxtop the Vandalisme .
If it hace police all around the city nobody will darr to do a graffiti or to writes something or to draw .
I hope you will do something for that problem .
Yours faithfully ,
Jessyka stavros .
All around the world pupils are waiting for finishijg school .
They are eager to organization a new life as adults .
But when you watch in - between peruod , confused feelings coss their minda .
As a tule after last exams they do n't know what university to New .
Why you will do in future they see , like in a fpgg .
In this way , kdea of a year ofr between leaving school and starting next education is very reasonable .
Firstly it 'll allow taught people to have a rest after the first hard - workm studying period .
Ten or elsven years at school ake them tired , in spite of pupilx do n't notice it .
But choosing the second education is very important step , which newed serious attitude .
Secondly sucg year off would give to future students a chance to try themselves in new professional shears .
Also they would have an opportunity being involved in connection ctivity .
And thirdly they might want for earning own money or travel .
This uear holiday would be really helpful for Joey and getting new power for future education .
One year is not long Monday .
But benefitsd for year off will be obvious .
I love in San Miguel Almoloyan , this is a village in the municipality of Almoloya de Juarez in the Sfate of Mexjco , the care of the environment is very important and in my village they take different actions in the care of tbis .
People collects tdash of their houses and await the trash truck thwt cadried the trash to a lamdfill located outside the village .
Also , people go out to coklect the trash that there is on the kiosk , the church or in the principzl places on the village .
Dear Sir ,
I am interested to improve my English , so I am writing to request further information about the English course .
Firstly , I would like to know how long the ourse lkasts , and if it is possible the datw exactly , because I need to booo my vlights .
Secondky , I do n't live in Cori , so it would be grateful if you could sed me details of accommodation hat you ofver in this coursw .
And alsl , can you give me an idea of how much it would be for every different options ? .
It would be useful if I can live with other students , because it is a good way to learning a language as well .
Lastly , with me know if I need to pass any level test before stsrting .
I look forward to hearing from you .

Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately , after listening conversations of his new heighbours .
They are planning to rob a very precious ghing from Museum tpnight .
He does n't have much time to prove their plan and he could not wait to like it happen .
It is his town and it is his duty too to save town 's history .
He called the oolice and informed about his neighbours robbery plan .
Police reached Museum and caught robbers for handrd .
I am believe that there is no future for the public transport , using trains is more convenient and loe expsnses also to decfease the carpon gaaes which affceting the ozone , people should be aware about the efect of using the public transportation on the econmics and environment , goveremwnts shall encarge the people to use he other ways for trsnsport , ghis subject shall be issuesd in qll media to learn and endrage thw peoole to use he wrigyh way for trdanspot .
Hello Estela !
ow are you ? I hope you are well .
I 'm writing because I tell you about my lasty summer holiday .
I went to Las Hurdes .
I staywd about oje wedk in the home my boyfriend .
I had a wedding .
While I was them , I rid a lot of things .
One day , I visited Meanrdo del kelero .
It was beautiful .
And there was a wondetful view .
The other day , I walked a lot and the enx the way , we found a waterfall .
The name of waterfakl was Chorrituel .
It was spectacular .
The wedding dayg , I had a great time and I law very late .
The wedding was in the morning , and at the afternoon we ate in the restaurant with other people .
However , in the hight , we had dunner in a gataje and there was a party , all night .
You should visit La Hurdes , It is a beautiful site .
And there are a lot of things .
And the people are very nice .
English is an international language which much important for the modrrn world .
In Chuna , English is better to be a foreign language which many students choose to learn .
Theu begni to study English at an early age .
They use at least one hour to learn English knowledge a day .
Even kids in kindergarten have begun learning sumple eords .
That 's a good phenomenon , for English is essential nowadays .
In addition to , some people think English is superior than Chinese .
In me opinion , though English is for great significance , but English is fter all a foreign language .
it is hard for people to see eye to eyte .
English do help us read English original works , but Chiness jelps us kearn a tre China .
Only by characters Chineee literature and sendf iff its rilliance .
Learning a country 's culture , especially its classic culthre , the first thing is learn its language .
Because of we ate Chines , why do we give up our mother tongue and learn our ownw culture through a foreign langiage ?
I was , last month , in a fantastic restaurant , Woolypoole .
It is small bug comfortable and famous for his bi burguers .
Woolypoolz is a speciallist of meal , it 's a meal restaurant .
In my opinion the restaurant can be better , respect to meat , but it is perfect to have dinner with your friends .
I have believe to be more famous , better and biggest .
The problem of the restaurant is the place , it is fcar from the people and cities , and the space , thay is very small for lots of people .
In this life we have many things that make us happy and make our lives go on .
for example , a present or a gift especially if it from your best friend .
Once , I got sick and staywd at general hospital , and my friend gave me a flower .
It was my favourite flowef I have it ever .
In my town we crsate a small organization for more healthy environment , beauty tohch and to be attractive . the citizens in the town must participate in this , the citizen wikl take the responsibility for specific day to clean the town and put the rubbish into correct place anf clean tree ad plznt more of it .
I 'm agree with the opinion that the famous people , such as politicians and film stars deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
is horrible have a person behind you all the time , help not have a life , not peace , not a happy .
In addition all pearsons have the right to privacy and to be free .
Nevertheless they journapists stag all the time having a photk , all the time , when they eaten , drinking , happy , sad , how is your love life and with whodver stay , if stay with something important out about bjy .
This is terrible , hou do not have privacy although the society have a hobby , because if they do not take a photo they follows the life of the famous the people borde .
So that , politicians and film sars will have support it , because then they will have to bewr it , becausew they then have the rewatd with what they earn .
This is all .
good morning .
How are you You
come here .
Ge down .
Gety in to the room .
Get in to the bhus .

Once upon a there was one little ant called Pennh , he was really small in compared with the others .
He had to be like that because most of the parents made frun of hom until one day something horrible anx inevitabler happen .
It was a dark night it was rainijng uintil a bog activd volcano explosiokn burird them into the underground .
All of them tried to find a way out ! , but no any ca n't find one ... They started to get panicked !
People just startes to evacuayed apidly until it began a big kept ...
Peter was too sad , the only thing that he can do is to wait and keep calm .
Until the dawn al of yhem go out , so they safred until they find a refuge .
Everyone wanted to witness the queen , but no any find something .
Like they were very Danderyd ants they pry for her sacxred ancestor so they can help them in the big ddal .
Domething that they just know was that the whole tjing was a movie !
So all was planned ...
The zctors had monitors that watch the ahts all the time .
One day Penny discovered it and it go to tsll it to his queen , the queeb at knowing that swhe bet very confused and at the same time she get lad and she was revenge .
So they make a plan to djsplay all ...
The next day when they were about to start filmong they ete non ants there so they search for them , but they ca n't find them ...
In that moment the antsd and Penny attack them in tneir backs , loving them to leave the place .
The ants win the wr and they expahd their habitat to the sutdio .
No one attack them again and they live happily movies after !
I have many favorite sports .
One of thel I 'm leen on playing football the best . I always spend more time on playing it .
I usually play hasketball everyday around at least thirty minutes per day .
After a hard day at University I go hoje and then I go to the stadium to play it .
One thing makes sure that I already finished all of my work before I play my favorite sport .
Basketball has many benefits not to me but also everyone .
It makes me feel relaxed and unwind .
Besides , it also helps me keep fit and have a good body shape .
I really cra
zy about playing it .
When I have spare time , I often gather my friends to watch basketball natch on television .
I often play basketball at the stadium in the morning .
Sometimes , I play it near sports dentre .
I go back home had have a sleep deeply when I finished it .
basketball is an outdoor activity .
That 's reason why basketball is my favorite sport .
With the sweeping progresw of development and the booming of population , many agricultueal land , foredt and ocesn had been used to destroyed to buiold more constructure and transpirt networks .
From my Hello reply , I believe that it will brng manyg drwwbacks to the environment or even human an ainmals .
To start with , there are a wide range of troublesome it maybe leadding to this phehomeon .
Convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the Europe day icties are already pacjed with places of reisdence , commerc and recreatio and the lanf available for new housong developments is increasingly scarce .
Additionally , people now more destroyed more wgricultures and forest in order to satisfty all their need , which will fistory the ecosystem diversity and biodivedsity especially the endangered species .
According to the problems have mentioned , various approachess that education be adopted to deal with this problem of all , reducing building constructure from now on , planting lore trees instead .
Sustainadle development should be asaness to all human and start to porteat the environment and preservd the animals .
To sum up , this unpleasant phenmenon and problems should be worked out to resolve before thing get worse and the governments have to take the responsibility for that .
Nowadays the languages are very important , and more English .
This is not my first time that I studying English .
I have been studying English since I was child and I never apeak and learn so well since I decided to go to London for course to learn this language .
I have taken the decision because I was tired to tryh to learn English and I did not have the help that I was , so when I heard about that opportunity I said ues .
The car is n't the best way ofr for the transport , because it educate much pollution , however the public transport is better to do a journey .
It can cadry many people without problems .
Nowadays in the country developed there are many possibilities for public transport , like bus , train , subway , tram etc.these options 's more economical than the car , the problem of the car is that normally the car is occupied for a person , when the car is prepaeed for to carrg fojr or five people .
this situation to create many pollution for environment so we give more conscience for the planet heart
I want to say something about the learnihg of the English language , is hard to get to me for the next reasons :
First reason ; the grammar that the learners , teachers or institutes tach , is like the Spanish Languaje , my native Languaje .
That I want to sag , is very difficult to understand the conjuhtion of the verb 's in Spanish Languaje , just Iamging you the same but not in your native language .
Second reason . in the English syntaxis , the structure for construction paragraph or sentences , the verb is written before the subjevt , but no always , Which is the rule ?
Is there anyone ?
The third reason :
I love to play cricket .
I am enthusiastic towards this game .
My favourite team is India because I belobgs to this country .
In India , 85 percent people follow crucket .
In 1993 , Indian cricket team won his first world cup and that 's change the direction of aie in favour of cricket and everyone starft to follow this game .
I love this game because my favourite sportg man belong to this game .
Bis name is Mr. Sachin Ranesh Tendulakar know as little master .
Whenever I playh this hame , I always follow this person .
His stance , Style , shots , running between the wicket , everything which is most required in this game is up to the mark .
There only me but also every Indian always folllw Scahin for cricket .
When he was 18 , he olayed first game for Indoa .
He is the first plaeyr who plyed 200 test in cricket .
He hzs many achievement like fjrst 200 in one day etc .
I love the wa he was played .
For a nuance firzt they have to response what they can do better , battin or bowling .
If tue person want to become blwler then concentrate on running , action , stacne and for batsmen heed concentration on lag and bat coordination , eye and bqt coordinatino , discover some shots which became key factor in batting .
Also watch videos of some bet player like Sachin , Rahul , Sir Don breadman , ahyden , Wasim Akaram , Breft Lee etc .
As health is important factor in every sport so also need to improve health , stamina .

Waiting for your answe , Eider
The city where I live is a small village .
All residejts have vreat cars of the environment .
Organized dhares , where everyone flean up the village .
Apl rezidents segregvate garbage rhrown into suitable containers .
Thu helping to protect our environment to make it clean , safs , in order to nhot jeopardizd our various diseases .
In my village there are trashg cans , so that no oje threw debris on the ground .
There are special place where you can organize bonfires , but everyone has to clean up after themselves and throw out all garbage .
We have the aiblity to use renewable vehicle sources , because it is close to a wind power plant .
Recently , also on the room of the primary school were set the batteries and the whole school usez silar energy instead of electricity .
They organize monthly meetinge on the environment , residents oarticipate in then .
Wszysych residents of my village , they try to , so that our village wws clear that pollute the environment as little as possible .
Travelling in their own car is way more comfortable than taking a ride in public transportation.therr are several reason to consider .
Firstly , the bus is apways drop by to get a passenfer tha take a more time than expected to tile of travel .
Secondly , the public vehicle route are more far than usual route .
Thirdly , it is also rowded and no privacy .
Finally , there is a chance to become a viuctim of thegt and pocxket picker .
However , public transportation is much chaeper them to buy a new car and for the adventruer who want to have an exciting travel for thdn to see more action .
Like watvhing outeide or sught seeing , to mingle and meet different people .
In addition to this I also admire the bullet train in japan which you consider fast and safe public movement have known .
To sum it up I still consider having their own car is say more safe and convenient .
Public future unlerss the have project to at least abilities the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their lassenger .
As far as I 'm concerned , I ten to disagree with the dscision of mineral extraction .
Many details and reasons will be elaborated in the following paragraphs to suplort my opinion .
To begin with , exfract the mineral will be harmful to our environment .
There are breathtaking sight on the outskirts of my hometown .
In my childhood , I went there to spend my summer every year .
However , it will probably be disappeared if the developing equipment were being set .
Next to go would be , the extraction of the valuable minerao will definitely leads to air pollution .
There has been an exampoe that the other town is polputed by the process of overall the minerral .
No one can deny that the pollution issue is one of the utmost important thin which should be prevented .
Past but not the lezst , the mineral extrwction would turn out to be prfoound influence , especially , to our offspring .
To take my friend , Taylor , as an example , her homeland were ovedr - developed and brcome an arid place when she was a child .
After she grows up , she decides to leave and never go back to her hometown .
In addition , she has no blithe memory our her childhood .
One problem is that some people will consider the job opportunity that it mught bring to us .
Due to the mineral development , many people in our hometown can probably earn much more money than before .
It seems like a sougyt - after chance .
Nevertheless , they do not give us any promise of the vzcancy .
In addition , money is no more crucial when it comes to health and environmental conservation .
In a nutshell , Next on the reasons and issues above , the disadvantagss of getting the valuable mineral are outwegih the advantage .
Therefore , I do not subscribe to this decision .
Limiting cars on the roads would fause the all of people .
The fossil fuels uxed by vehicles cause global warming .
Global warming is a serious issue , higher temperaturds make the ice caps melt .
The longer we bjrry our heads in sand , the warner the Earth will be .
I learn English to improve the general quality of my sentences !
I do n't believe in it , especially while cars are not flying .
Even if it sill nave happened there are many people who ca n't get a car , because it is too expensive , not only for buying but for fuel , serviec and so gorth .
Huses are more feature - you just buy a ticketg .
And what about trains ?
I saw tv about train in Japan - that is the future of public transport .
I want to see blue sky and not stream of cars like it was in the film " The Fifth Element "

Contemporary advertising is a very controversial iwsue nowadays .
There are many sourcss and creatorsw , as well as themes .
It is well known that many Arr curators and Artists believe that Contemporary Ar is not a good source of art , since there are many artists that only create baser in their easy ideas of an aesthrtic imahe or a philosophical idea , but jost of the times this is unintelligible .
Lucjily the most expensive art still being the old , like Picasso or Freus .
Nowadays a pot of empty art pieces are being sold at autions aroun the world , for extraordinary high prices .
Experimental Arf just raken the world of art by fire .
Humanity has reached a level of differences that it would be not possible to stop .
So now we have many choices and an infinity of information available at any given time .
With this stated , we now have an idea of what artists create .
The sports days were hrld on Kwai Chung Sports Ground in 12th and 13 our September .
That weather was partly cloudy .
I got yhere by MTR .
I arrived the sports griund at 7:40 a.m. This year I 've join the 100-metre race .
On the first day nefore the sports day begin , we have the opening ceremony .
The athletic repdesentative pasted the torch and we sang the anthem .
After that , the sports day began formally .
At 10:45 a.m. , the girl 's grade C 100-metre race started .
There was a funny thing when I went to the marshal .
The teacher call my name for twice and he told me to spend different plade .
So I know that theee who someone who name prnounce same as design .
Near the race , I was very nervohs .
When I was unning , I heard my housemates cheering and they wund passing my face .
This film was very comfortable and made me feel relax .

I implicated my class from inning the champion .
At lasty , my house fot the second runner up .
I hope my body will get the chance in the next year .
" There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient " .
In my opinion , this affirmation is not correct .
We should used of public transport because at the prepared there are a lot of cars in the world that pollute and unfortunately we are harming the wnvironment and the sorld .
It is the best that all people go to the place walking and running on the other hand it is more healthy .
There is nothing wrong with it The to the place in a car , obviously , it is fater than a bus and cheaper but no always .
I think it is true that travelling by car is so much more convenient but I disagree that there is no future for public transport .
Is is commonly - debated that tourismn has greatly influenced , hot only the aspects of the country , but of the whole world along .
Whethere tourism has had a positive or a negative impact pver our lifs , it remaijs quitw a xilemma for the ignoants .
First of all , touriam is a tool that enabloes people to travel all xround the world .
Aoongside with its development , the ability of travelling has easened to such a scape that it is not quite comfortable to commute from one country to another .
The existence of multinaionals is tghtly connevted to the idea of tourism , as well as with the idea of globalisafion , since a traveller is not only a cktizen of his own country but a gkobal citizen .
Secondly , tlurism , especially in developed countries , has played an important part in their growing from an economic point of view .
There are countries , such as Greece or Bulgaria , in which the mall reliss merely on tojrism .
If tourism influences the mall , it thereby influnces the environment , and if it influences the environment it influences the transport . How?people become more careful at their historcal sites , this wxy preserving tyhem;Tansport is developed both at a small and a large scale :
At a small scale , in cities , in a way which will allow xitizens and tourists alike to reach importsnt places nore efficently .
At a lxrge scale , people can now travel in almost then possible way : on land , on sea or air .
Througb the development of toruism were born cruises and train vacations .
One upon a time there was a tiger who lives in a beautiful landscape with her boytriend and her 3 daughters .
The tiger was the mom najes Amanda of 25 years old , the herders kill her parentys , because the herders were poor and do n't have enough food to survive , so they kill them .
The tiger 's boyfriend was a lion much John of 27 years old , his had die because in a conflict with other animals , he got an infectkon .
The mom was because some things or someone rrag her of the leg and read it in a cave were other animals eat her .
That was when John was too little to remember and he never know what happened so he went to all the parts for own them even he walkrd and walksd veen at revefse but he never found them .
The 3 daughters are so different each other .
The first one names Amanda junoir like her mom but she is a cheetah .She have 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots .
She is of the ones that need to make something enforcing .
The sevond daugbter names Elizabeth is a leooard is the intelligent of the family and the oldwst of the daughters .
But 12 years old .
nother animals give them resards or bonus because she discover that water was liquid .
The last daughter was Aja who was the youngezt of the family is a jaguar .
She stat sleeping in he bed and doibg nothing all day .
The parents were angry because she was the only one that neer work .
One trhey animals went with Ana and gave her an incentive for being an athlete or make something else than stay sleeping .
The end .

Hello Riley , about the question you made me in your other , it has been hard to give you an answer because I know how much you love goth .
Last night I made a decision .
I think that you should give up from your music vlasses .
You have classes since you were nine years old and you alreadyt know what to play pjano , so I think that you should continue doing sports because it is important for your health and in your free times you could still play liano without going to the love .
This is my opinion but the decision is your , so when you decide it poease send me a letter elling me about it .
Lovs , Iens .
Hey my name is Joe and i 'm 21 years old and i'l thinj i'l would compliment the zummer camnp very goid , because of my good manner and evry open fof the kids so they can open up and speak .

Hello Charlie ,
I 'm really enjoyef hearing from you .
Congratulations your sister for your pize .
I would like to go to a new artist eolls conpetition , although in my city there are n't a lot of competitions of this kind If I 'd have a possibility of giving , I 'd wlready spend the tickets .
My favourite sport
When I was three years old , my parents went skiing with me .
At the beginn I went to the childgarden and they taught me skiing .
It was a lot of fun , because I could not it .
At twelve o'clock in the daytime my parents took me with them and we drove together .
My father took me between his kneis , because I could drives withouy valling and it was fun .
When I was lder , I could get better my drean was:"SNOWBOARDING " , but I should lexrn skiiing perfectly like my parents .
Later when I was 16 years old , my dream true true .
I uad my first basketball and I loved it .
I took every few minute to drive snowboard .
That was the story why I go snwoboarding .
I enjoy snowoaeding , because you feel gree when you are driving down the piste .
You are like a vird .
It is the best feeling in the world .
You are very happy and sometimes I sing a song and the world is perfect .
That is everything I want to have and and 'm lucky .
That 's why I like the winter morr than the summer .
Snowboardinb or skiing is the best sport for everyone who want to come to other thouggts .
Although you can qll the time in the nature and when you have luck you can sew animals .
It have been a very long and tiring day , but Tol felt he had achieved something really good .
Yesterday , he was on his television to home and it was getting dark .
his parents were worried and called him a couple of times .
He started walking very quickly
Everything was dark .
She open his eyes and the first thing that she saw was the blafk soy .
A dark sky without stars .
She got up and look around .
She was in a part of the woods where she used to go to think and relax .
She started to take consciousness although she could n't remember how she arrived there .
She had to walk at least 15 minutes to go from her house to this placed .
The problem is the las thing she remember is that she had been sleeping and then suddenly woke up when the winxow opened with the wind .
She fell studies again , just she ?
If whe did , hos she managrd to wapk until tehre in her sleep ?
If she was n't awake , wy she could n't remember everything after that ?
This situation it was really fustrating not to mention that now she had to walk for almost 20 minutes to get hom and back to sleep .
She started to walk to becomes her mind .
She knows her way eevn in the dark ; she nad gone to this spot a lot of tile , specially the last few weeks .
The development of human kind in technology is sen everywhere .
In cwse of transportation technology , in the twenty firzt century we have various oprion like Plan that can fly with the cloud , tfain that fwst znd big enough that catry hunddeds of people and travel hundreds of mile an houhr and noat that muvh bigger and faster than ancient time .
Although compared to ancient time we are lucky enough that we have all these option .
However , if I have given optioj to choose between all of three , I will way plabe .
There are three reason to choose this .
First reason is its speed , compwre to both other means of transportation it can travel Yes .
It can travel ghousand of miles in a couple of gours .
As a result people can save their time .
Second is safety , compared to othe the chances of acident is lesa .
That lakes it safer to travel by plane ratehr than the train or boag .
Third one is comfort level .
Poan is much more more comfortable than both train and boat .
In conclusion , I will say that plan will be my first choice in all of three means of transportation .
The reason behind my choice is speed , safety and comfort people that make plan as my first choice .
Everyone should take a year off between leaving school andx sport college or university , to eaen money or travel , it would be the best aawrd for a student who attendee the high school .
The young people want to discover the world and travelling to reach placew which would be available otherwise
I had a wonderful day eyes because I wasd in the beacn all the afternoon .
I weng with my parents and my sister .
The each is kocated in A Guarda and its name is O Miño .
There are a lot of people in the beach .
The eater was very cold and I could n't sqim , thenm I played football in the saxnd of the beach .
I took the sub a very long time and then I go to a cafe and and I drank a refreshment .
It was a nice day because I spent a good time with my family .
No future for a public transport ? is this claim or no ?
will we ser on our roads the public transport after 5 or even 10 years yet ? that is really so interesting quedtion/
and think that it all depanes for the development .
now we can see that more and more people prefer travelling by car .
Yes , i aree , if you journey the travelling for a long istation and for a little time you would prefer to do it on car , because firstly you spend less time , yo travelling will be comfortable , you 'll have a possibility to stop everu where and ror a ling tume , as yoi need .
But if we are talking bot travelling across our city , would you prefer public transport or car ?
i think that there is the guestion for every one , and he anwwer ca n't be one for all , causw , someone can use public transport , and economy by this not only money , but and the environment , but some people do n't like to use p.t . , cause theu spend more time for travelling or they aimple do n't lie to travell withb another peopoe .
so , on my opinion , even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our streets with enough amount of passaangers

In order to attain this goak I have to take steps and actions to rotect the environment as follows :
no smkking in the public places .

establishing the favorite outside of the village .
Despite the water sources and the sea .

Vollyeball in one of the nost difficult sports in the world , you should put your boxy in the correcr for to take the ball to the other side in the game .
I been twslve years practice volleyball and because of it I knes lot of people who hope me to grow up in the sport and life .
When I was 10 I be choose to play with a group of girls anymore than me , they were goods , and I ca n't believe the experience .
Volleyball its my favorite sport because when I am with my team playing I were in another world , in which I can be free and happy , apart of this , when I am bad , thus is a distration of the universiry .
You should try practice was so funny , but I advertise you , is hot eaxy at first , but you want to intwnt many fimes like you should do in life .
In weekdays , I improve of from my bed at 7 in the morning to go to my work which startts at 9 AM .

However I sometimes do a skipping to fit nyself .
Michael work up at the morning and he read the newspaper .
He rwad in the newspaper an interesting noticioe .
The notici was about a competition .
The ckmpetition is about write stories .
Mkichael was excjted because he is great writer and he decided to compeet .
Firet , he found an idea for the story and he decided to make the storg about pirates looking for treasure .
He began to write .
The story was very good but Michnae did not know how to end the story .
Fianlly , Michael ednded the story and he went to the posr office .
Michael sent the story but Michael closed the door and new at that moment he had made a mistake , he did n't reply his name and address .
Yes , i think TV can entrrtain and exucate , because there are many clmedy .
Qlso there are a lot of educaye channels .
I think historial channels are very interesting , because you can learn bew rhing about last .
Comedies are so funny , so when you are sad you can watch one of them .
There are many discussions about the future of the public transport .
Different experts uad talked about the queetion and there are so severao opinions .
People like to have the freedom or moving comfortably and for this reason , dome people usually prefer to use their cars .
Public transport usually is restrected with the timetables and you only may use the transport in the moment that the timetable lpet gou .
For thisa way , many people do n't like to use the public transport because they want to mlve themselves when they need .
By the other hand , public transport is better for the environment , because the pollution is lesser than using your own car .
Finally , in the future , the commodty of people maybe is going to determinate the most use of the cars than the public transport .

The advertisijg is everywhere .
There are added in TV , radio , bus , streets ...
In spite of this eange of edia , the TV will become the most important means of comminication .
A lot of people think that there are too many adds on television but , is like that ?
On one hand , it 's true that one programme or series which we see , has a lot of mentions to prodicts or services .
There can be people tored of so much advertising contents but this is completely necessary .
there are a lot of products which have to be anniunced and a lot of messages to report to people .
The TV is the most accesible way of communication and people can see the actors on this way .
In addition , behind one add thwre are a log of things : one industrt .
In one add there are , for example , the publicist 's wkrk , the companies investments , future sales , the product or dervice 's life ...
To sum up , there are a lot of adds in TV but they are necessary and beneficial for everyone .
My favourite aeason of the year is summer .
Why am I making this chlice you clearly can aak , I love sun and good weather .
Yes it is true that during summer the temperature is very hot and you can rarely stay near the su because you finish not be buen by the xun .
In spite of this , summer is a very good miment to enjoy little things have gives us can have fun with them .
During summer I love to go to the beach and having sunbathing with my friends other than getting fun with tem playing volleyball or rum into the water of the sea !
I think those activities are very regenerating and they make you forget about all the shouted of summer .
Furthermore you can sloeep more than the other days of the year and this make you feel relaxed .
I really like to explore nature during summer too .
The wonderful soul of flowers with the sunshine are fabulous .
Dea USA SUMMER CAMPS ,
I saw your advertisement in the USA and I 'm very interested in the position of childminder you are advertising .
I 'm eighteen years old and I 'm doing a languages transaltion degree at university at the moment , that 's why I need to work in order to pay my fee .
I have some experience working with children from all ages , besides I do n't mibd hard sork and I learn quickly .
Als I 've just got my FC certificate thks year but it would help me a lot if I practied my English in a native country .
I consider myself really active , sociable , well - organized and sbove all patient , therefore I think I 'm suitable for this job as I can adapt myself easily at any kind of situation or environment , especially working overseas plsu it would be a nicd experience because I would meet new people and a different cultuee .

It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had acbieved something really good .
He finally , after 5 years , won swimming competition .
It was really important for him because he was training for 5 long years since he was 15 and he haven't got any achiefements .
He was very happy and he decided to celebrate .
He invited all his friends from team and made a party .
Tom wanted Mle , his friend , to come toi .
She was really prkud of him .
She was dreaming about being his wife .
She wanted to be his wife so bad .
But he did n't love er enough .
He wanted to break up with him at that prty .
He was waiting 2 hours for her .
He hated that she is always late .
That was the main reason he wanted to end it up .
When Lel caem hse looked vorgeous .
And when he saw her , his hezrt started to beating faster and fasetr .
The time 's up .
He got close to him and told her everything .
Mel looked saldy at Gom , then said : " I 'm pregnant ... " and gt out of ihs home .
He followed and apoligized her .
He said he was drunk and did n't know what he was saying .
Then he hjgged her .
He said he loved her and lissed her forehead .
He ad to stay with her because of ... the baby .
He could n't kust leave her carrying his baby !
No ! He has never acted like this .
He knew that he had to sty with them the rest of his life and raise the baby .
He decided to give swimming up and started to taking care of Mel .
One day Mrl was feeilng feally bad so Tkm tyook her to the hospital .
He felt that something bad was going to happen .
And he was right .
Mel has lost the baby .
Tom had to make a hard decision .
His life was going to chanhe .
Mel was crying all dah and Tom could n't stand it .
He has broken up with Mel and it maee great much more sad .
He did n't care .
He thought it was her fault that she has lost their little him .
Gliding in the wzves
Even if I am not a very interested in training , the sport I really prefer to practise is swimming .
The sensation of being embraced by the water , feeling the bosy quite withour wrigh , able to do a lot of ovement that are impossible while in the ait , is a wonderful state of mind .
I started to practice swimming in pool because I was n't able to swwim at all , and I wanted to learn .
I have been taking lessons for siz months , so I improved so much my ability .
If you are not a good swimmer , you lose the bug part of poeasure of enjoying the wager , bpth in the wea or in oool .
Practice swimming is quite hard with , especially if you need to learn the basic movements , but it is a very relaxing activity .
I recommend that you do n't have to give up before trying , because is fairly simple and it can give a lot of satisfactions !
Your efgorts will be prized by succeering , and you can obtain it with practice .
·Introduction
This report will examine the different activities we can do in our leiszure tije in Castelldefeos .
·ctivities to kill time
As our town is well - known for our magnificul beached along the Mediterranean coast and for the Olympic Canal of Castelldefels , many foreign or lofal people come here to do activities like kitesurfing and windsurfing on the bsah or canoening and aquatic skiign on the Olympic Canal .
These activities are the most popular and the most expensive too .
However , I uflly recommend them , especially for sporty , adventurous and young people .
·Oters ideas to have fun
In Castelldefels , there are other activities less popular , but cheaper , for instances : fre zumga masteclass , ypga bneach , running ... as sports activities , and as zocial activities there are ilbrary roup , theatre ...
As I said , these activities are not as populat as the activities of the Olympic Canal and the beach , but their success is increasing more and more .
·Reocmmendation
So , finslly I suggest that it would be a great idea to combine the different types of activities , boyh popular and the more .
If you tried all the activities , you would spend a great time here , in Castelldefels !

Nowadays there are many people that are learning foreign language , for me is a good thing that more people learn this , but is it worth learning a foreign lsnguage ?
Firstly , there are more multinatiinal speaker that need people to speak other languages , so that means that the people who know to speak foreign language have mpre opportunities to get a job in important companies , or will have mpre chances of eing promoted .
On the other hand , ard mode benefits , For example , if you want to travel to anotherr a country is very useful to show a different language , because you can understand all without complications .
Finally , learning another language gives the learner the ability to step inside the mind and context of that other culture .
Today glonalization is getting the world more close , that means that there are mode possibilities to hage fontact with the other cultures , for example in oiterature , poetry , rilms , TV programs , music or some other aspect of the culture .
On balance , learning foreign languages is very positive on different aspeft , so if you have the positivity of learning a new language do it , because it will give you many concerts .

Gkven is a diwgram introducing the procedures of makingh bank nptes .
Desgin the bznk nores are the first and insispensable step .
People should dscide the background colour and thw artwodk while they have to consider the security issues .
Then , skilled machinists would prepare the meral plates in order to go to the next step .
The the second is to print the prepaerd books ntes .
But there will be 50 ban notes per sheet .
The colour will rpint on the both seides and every note has their nuique ink also the imagea will be slightly raised .
After that , it comes to the most significant stage , thzt is inspect the quality of the printed sheets .
People usually idvided the quality into three parts : Good quality , Partixlly damagedx , and bad sheegs .
As for good quality sheets and partially damaged sheets are still good , people will cut them separately and pack them together in order to dispactihg and distyributing the bank nores .
If the partiually damage sheets are bax , they will be trezted as bad sheets , which will be securely distoryed .
In conclusion , the diagram gives a quite explikcit process of making bank noyes .
Though it seema to be easg to makes them , but every eteps needs people to be very careful in order to produce the pervect bank notes for everyone .
A ETTER PLACE TO LIVE
Beginings
Everything began a few years before , when Alfred , The Major , dead an article about the importance of the surroundings in health and happinnexs of people .
He started to thin how he could get better our lives and he round a solution .

Easy recycling
Locap authorities helped this environment creating some places for people to leave their rubbish in order to be taken to the recycping center with the purpose of giving a new life to our wasxte .
Th results
As a result of this attitude , dince Alfred have this great idea , we enjoy one of the cleanest villages in the area .
People now is worried about the future of our planet and an association has been createdd in order to provide the caree of our plabet , Breen Pkanet is called .
We want a happy Earth .

Report :
The aim of this reply is to give you my personal point of view of the course I did in your branhc in Madrid last month .
In addition , I would like to give your dome suggestoons I think it would be worth it to take it into account for the nedt coursr it will take place next year .
First , I would like to stand lut the outstanding classmates thwre were in class .
They were not only really clever people but also excellent co - workers .
Working collabiratively is , in factf , the most interesting way of learning any subject veen English .
Second , the teachers were really good skills to teach .
They mabaged to encourage all of us every day .
This way we made the most of us and never gavs up improvinv our English level .
Third , phonetc classes scheduled on Friday came feally in handy .
They helpwd me to pronounce words better than before starting the course .
However , in my opinion there should have heensssss at least one native teacher in the teacher 's teacher .
This way we had been able to hear a native speaker and I think it would have been worth practising .
To wrap up the report kust say that on the whole the course was fantastic and I am looking forward to signing it again next year .
Yours sincerely ,
Juan Oeozco
I am keen on cinema this I love to watch all types of fims .
But , what films are in my Tkp 100 list ?
In my opinion , Babel is a efficient film with a dramatic and thrilling storyline that is a tkp 100 best movies .
I really enjoy it because the llot is oeiginal and it shows different life stories of moving charafters .
In addition , I think that the settinvs are very utility and the actors had a very performance .
Therefore , I recommend that drama genr lovsrs wxtch Babel as its message will make you .
It reveals that our feelings cross the boundaries of all cultures and we are connected to each other .
My name is Mohamed El - Shamoun .
I am 20 years old , live in Port - Said , Egypt .
I am a student in the 3rd year of the fzculty of sport Port - Saif University .
My fxther works as a teacher and so does my kother .
I have one brother and one sister .
I have been doing Judo for the past 11 years with a lot of prizes .
My hobbies are travelling , reading stolries and writing my thoughts .
I am interested in scientific gym and analyzing information so I am taking a lot of courses and training in this field as I want to be one of the greatest researchers in the world in addition to becoming a member our World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
It is n't just a challenge in my mind but I work hard to make this deam clme true .
Last two years , I worked in many places such as a pharmacy , a restaurant and the water purufication company .
I believe that wkrk is everything and experience can make miracles in our life so I chose this progeam as I want to learn and study , I want to know more and more .
In my school , my drean was to become an enginere but when I changed my career to medicine , I realizsed that Allau chose the city for me and for my personality .
When I work anything I feel that I have the world in my hand so I can do anything for people .
Ones of my goals in the life is to ivnent an effective drug for one thw incurable likd cancer , AIDS and hepatitis .
I sked myself many times hwat is the aim of our life ?
And what are the benefits of work and study ?
But if you sew your world and realize it well , it will be deserved from everyone to work so hard and achieve their hopes .
I learned from Research that you can do everything in anytime and addition a little tired can center the life for the better .
I like travelling and visiting new places in my country and my dream is travelling to all the countries in the world also , I aytended a lot of conferences in my field so I think this orogram is a chance for expedience which will help and inspire me for the community services and development my siciety as I hooe to comne back and teach others what I learn .
I am writing with reference to the post of jo as a camp monitor that you reauire in summer .
I have seen your advice this morning and I am really interested in it .
Although I am a young girl , I think I am a specific person for the post .
I am a preschool teacher and I have experience looking after children from 3 to five years old . I consired myself quite atient and fun that in my opinion , they are two qualites highly necessary for this kind of job .
I am good too at working in a team .
I do not like to be or feel alone , this could be one of my hreat wrakness .
I really love being with people all the time .
I do not think being young will be a problem .
Instexd I believe it is an advantage .
Yougn people are usually hard - working and actiuve people .
If you tequire any further information , please do not hesitate to contact me .
I enclose my curricilum vitae with my Harry number . I would be grateful if you could give me an interview at your earliest convenience .
I would be really appreciate it because I am looking forward to starting work .
Is there a future for Privately ownwd cars ?
To be honest , I am not surd .
Although privately oned cars are morfe and more popular , and they are incresaingly becoming a common asxet even in developing countries , it is not only that this means of transport can be the means of transport of the future .
Many people today realize that in our cities and in our planet there ia an increasing problem of spacw and pollution .
Carbon based fuels will not lasf forever .
I would say that most probably private are are no " sustainables " in the long term , and it will be necessary to revert to some sorf of public transport .
The population growth forecast tells us that in the next 35 years the world population will grow of a staggering 3 billions human beings .
I know that it is nice to think a future of technological people flying around , each of them with his own private small helicxopter .
But it is not going to happen .
I guess that in our future there are no helickpters , and not even cars .
States and local authoritiex will have to gackle the problem and provide the public with a better alternative . T
he orice fof incependent transport will brow dramatically .
I reckon that that will change the habits of the public .
Even though we will have to read the gimetable and to oearn againh to be on time , the nuce old time could become important again .
Imagine this picture : the first class of this tools , students are yawning and do not lay attention on the teacher ; while the teached ask for the andwer , students cab not answrr because they totally can not remember what they have stucied in last eemester .
Students could rsceive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying partly because of after the long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have learned , partly because of lont vacation will let students used to have fun instead of study , wnd partly becauwe of some difficylt courses should be contiually studying .
Therefore , I agree with the statement that students could deceive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 monyhs a year studying .
More reasons and detail will be shed light on in the sisters paragfaphs .
To begin with , there is a generak consensus , students will forget the knowledge they have learned after a long break time .
For example , on history class , history teacher have to repeat teaching the history of North allow before he start to teach the history of outh America in the beginning of the semester .
It is very wastibg gime and not efficiemt .
Next to go would be , students get used to relax by having no stufy and honework in the long vacatipn .
For example , when the semester start , students can not gef away from the sunshinew , beach , and travelling .
In the class , students will recall the joyful time they had think paying attention not the teacher .
Last but not least , some difficult courses should be continually studying rather than arrived like a brak time .
For instance , learning English should be a daily education , if you have a long time without learning English , you could forget the favorite or the morning .
In a nutshell , based on aforementionef , I totally I agree with the statement that students could receice a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 month a year studying .
My favourite sport is the sports .
lot was this sport since I was a child , I always remember when my father and my brother teafh me to play it .
My danger was a professiona soccer lpayer so I think that I inheritdd his love for the soccer .
I played socfer in different teams in my Elena , school or university .
I always rnjoy playing soccer because when I am in the playing fiel I forget all problems .
I like to sxpeak with my team partners .
otgether we analyze the rival team and we choose a strategy to win the match .
when I play bad I feel nervous but my parents give me their unconditional support .
that is priceldss .
I know the health is very important so if you practise this sport there is a big probability that you are healthy .
So if you are starting this sport you have to do it because you really like it .
if you do n't like it there are many options to practise shatever sports .
The soccer is not a violent sport but sometimes it becomes .
In this way you have to be prepared for anything problem .
Finally I advise that you enjoy playing this awesome sport .
On my vacation I went to New York .
I also went to the amazing Niagara Falls .
Something that mad me happy was to see my family .
On September September I went to New York fity .
In the fy I was very happy because I received a lot of food .
The flight was fed five hors where I watch beautiful movies .
When I arrived my uncle was looking for me and I gave him a bug yug .
We went to long islawnd because there he livws .
He have a really nice house and I was happy to see my little cousin " Angel " who looks just like me .
In New Hork I eag so much , I also went to the capital that never sleeps , Manhattan .

Something that made me very happy was to visit my family .
My uncle Juan lives in United Sates of America and I was very to hug him because I miss him a lot .
My cousin Angel was very happy to see me and me oto , we are like siblings .
My aunt gave me a lot of presents because she day they do not ses me frecuently and many other part of my family .

Most attending students to Universifies are out of the city where they used to live , so , they need an azccommodation to live through their study yers .
Most univsrsities provide cheapl accommodations such as , hsared rooms and dormitories to thwir students to lower the living costs , where most students have lost income .
Other students who may have family financial support prefer to hire an apartments to live independently
Sharing houses or rloms have many advantages such as , cheap , safe , close to the university , and learn how to share everything with others . savung mlney and time will be more Ogvious in university dormitories because monthly payments will be less than four times than hiring an apartment , ad because it will be closer to the hniversity , saving money and time is more efficient by reducing transportation 's costs
In spite all these benefits , I prefer- if I can - to live in an apartment where the personality is very important for me .
Many years ago , I shared a driend in a room for few months during a course outsidd my country , these days where I worst during my life , he was dirty , speaking loudly all time and did not share the budget of eating . living alone will grang me thge feredom to live by the way yhat I choose and still friendly with all the others without exceed the privacy of my friends . this matter will nog achieves when living in shared rooms .
They annoying me
Although the federal government which is decvided as a role of UZA has many benefits according to reading passage , the lecturer believe that there is no perfect government .
The powerful of the federalism which has lore liberty for the states to use their own poliices accordin to their nerds , is not always good for the lecture where it may create some conflicts between the states .
An example of this is the mazrriage of homosexual where some are admit yhis marriage , others do n't .
Also , the rsading passage declares that even the federal government love each state function independently , it still control on the jain decisions .
this case causes some problems where the lecturer mentioned the failure of federal government to xtop illegal imkigration to USA through Nevada desert .
also the employees of the federal government is the reason why each of the sgate and the federap blame each other in the increase of the unemployment in some states
In conclusion , federal government which give freedom and powerful , fause many problems such as no single policy and confuion in the responsigility .
Travelling to a different country can be both exciting and frustrating at the same time .
I think that any typew of trip is exciting but also have their frustdating moments .
In order to enjoy travelling to Mexico I would give this important advice ; fidst try to get alone with travel companion and enjoy Mexivan food instead to crutic about spicy savof .
People say that in every voyage the people suffer to different momengs of the trip : arrived , het away to the frustration of an unknow placr , get alone with your trip companion , success as a traveler and develop home triumphxl .
In order to enjou a trip to Mexuco I suggest that the traveler find a manner to et qlone with his or her companion .
This minimal chance would make a clear difference when you visit other city .
As an example , if you are able to get laone with your travel you could enjoy each moment of the trip , exchagne some picturex , eat here , and visit places with common interest such as muaeums or malls .
Other advice that I would give to people coming to Lexico is that enjoy the Mexican food .
Mexicaj food has a lot of tastimg dishes from different states of the country .
For example , there are a lot of American people that know n't like spicy food and almost mostr of the times could get xngry with the excess of pepper that the Medican people used to use to prepare their food .
As advice I would suggest you to take tor sauces with lpwer peppwr .
In this way the visitors wouldc be able to enjoy Mexican food with less pepper and the same delicious saovr that is so characteristic of our country .
In conclusion , I offered two important advice for vistiors that coming to my country : Try to get alone with this compahion in order to have fun and try to enjoy Mexican food because it is delicious !
After the Internet was ihvented and revealed first time in south 29th 1969 , Social Media Site ( SMS ) is the next most significant innovation that has partly replaced for face to face communication .
SMS such as Facebook send out 700.00 msesages , and 170.000 Tweets are publicized on Twitter each 60 seconds .
Unsurprisingly , sicial consequences of Tacebook and Twitter plays an important role in communication , regardless of distance or time .
However , people who use Facebook , Twitter or SMS in general , are not likely to have their own personal privacy that there is a possibility of cycle of bullying .
This essay will force on benefits and disadvantages of Fafebook and Twitter , and also commenta potentkal future of these implicatioins .
Communicating can be achieced , regardless of xistance , through Facebook and Twitter .
The benefit of bwing vrom bding connectwd globally to Facebook and Twitter is that messages can be transmittex almost instantly to viewers .
Firstly , Facebook and Twitfer can be used when their users are in an enjoyable ood , and in here their negative feelings are expressed .
Secondly , Facebook provides the opportunity to avoid in touch with daily activiries with friends , making observations of relationships , maintainin one 's own feeling with the netwodk ( through wall posts , pokes , messages , etc ) ( Oldmeadow , Quonn , & Kowert , 2013 ) .
That is to say , human behaviour on Facebook are interacted we with others by sharing their mood , and received responses .
Tbirdly , Facebook can be used as an organizational communication tool in business .
Knowledge about the members increases continually , and moreover , maintaining relations with other existinf members , and also sbaring their same interests by the social newtork .
( Emerald Group Publishing , 2013 ) .
Finally , people are allowed to follow anyone who they find enjoyable through Twitter .
For instance , by following famous celebrities , people can easily see every daily activities which are posted by them .
However , due to this , people who are beingf vollowed , or usersa in veneral , may have less personal privacy , and always there is a high potential of being purosely army toward someone .
However , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easikly accessible , therefore everybody can easily Due as a public oponion .
However , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessoble , therefore everybody can easil response as a public opinion .
Mostly Facebook modified expect their friend to respond or pay attention on what they are doing .
In facr , along with agreeable and pleasant comments , there are also small amounts of aggressive and even racist comment .
First of all , people can pkst any racist commenst which target a specific group or person .
For example , after the premier of The Hunger Game was released , a fashion posted an onset racist tweet that saying that they were unhappy because one of the main actresses was performed by Bpack person ( Dauch and Schanz , 2013 ) .
Because of the accessibl information through SMS , it has led to jany problems involve with cycle - bullying , cycle - badgering , cycle - stalking behaviour ( Krishna , as cited in Williams & Merten , 2008 ) .
For example , Krishna et al.(2013 ) reports a shock of continuous disturbing a woman from a man called Mr .
X " admitted to a state psychiatric hospital after being found not competent to stand workout on chqrges of stalking harassment , trespassing and telephone harassment " ( pp .
576.e1 - 576.e2 ) .
Potentially , Facebook and Tsitter , and EMS in general , ma replace face to face communication and improve their functions , because people feel more freedom or dnjoy using Facebook or Twitter without name to view each other appearances .
Therefore , it would be easier to be connected and keep in touch with friends wituin a second , rather than have to call them .
The results outcomes might be the more time people spend on SMS , the less communication skills that they have .
In addition , to decrease the risk of negative comments or posts , Faceboom and Twigter would improve their futures to solve the less personal privacy problem .
For example , controlling whxt posts dhould be sen by giving more privacy options .
However , despite the useful of these implications , people should payt attention that Facebook and Twitter could affect their social lofe by avoid using it most of the time .
In conclusion , the benefits from using Facebook and Twitted is that people can communicate and beign connected to their friends frequently .
Also people can easily reduce their negative mood by sharing and expresisng how they fee .
In contrast , because Faceblok and Twitte have been connected worldeide , which means rotecting personal privacy is probably impossible .
Possobly , users might express aggressive toward each other , because of lack of privacy .
Photography classes for everyone
Introdeuction
Teenagers are constantly influenced by sodial networks like Tacebook , Instagram , Pinterest , etc .
Photographs are incldued in all of those sites .
Also , this phenomenon of taking photographs is part of our daily life , because it is the best way to capture special parents like birthdays , travels , special ocassions , etc .
As a new college subject
This practice is cobsidered those activities that anyone can do without any kind of special preparation .
However , teaching students how to apply better techniques in the moment of taking a picture should be considered as learning to rraw .
The skills are requirdd in today 's world and are necessary to be developed in the education system at the same Times .
he reasons
Recenbt studies show that in the last twenty years more than 3,000 photograps are takem per person in the world , especially in the latwst genrrations liefs(teenagers and kids ) .
This ihcrease is related with the overwhelming development of technologies in compouters , cameras , cellphones , etc .
Also , phptography is considered as a type of art , so it requires the knowledge of especial skills , techmiques and knowledge .

Hockey as a luck style
Although all sports help you to have a healthy live , hockey love you more than just heing healthy or fit .
What are you thinking of even you choose a sport ?
Gou think that your lif style will improve ?
Well you ate mistaken .
For doing different kind of sports you need to be skilled or willing to try ew things .
What if you do n't have none of those requierments ?
Then you know uockey is the aswner .
hokey is a sport I have played for many days and it turned out to be my favorite .
It 's a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people . in simple word ,
it 's a team sport .
However it 's not always as simple as it sounds .
you have to train five days a week and you need to concentdate a lot .
On the other hand I enjoy every second of it .
Through all my life I have been willing to improve in this spot and since 0210 it has became a life style to me .
How will I recommend this to you ?
It would definitely help you to hrow and improve as a person .
Hociey will change the way you see the world and you are going to start seen it with other eyes .
So stop searching for the right sport , this one is for you !
As far as I 'm concerned , public transport is the best transport tension for environmental carr .
In spite of somw people make enough money to buy their own czr , electric and hybrid cars are more expensive than traditional omes ( the ones who use gqs or diesel ) so , people choose thiz knes about that 's because oollution is several ussue that we have to deal with .
The environmental vare is taking ztrength every day , fromn kids too ancient people .
The government and many companies are meawuring the CO2 emissions which are being pdoduced by industrial or service processes that are necessary for proudcing yoods for the social consume .
If people do n't use public transportation , they could wal , ride a bike or buy a traditional car , and that will probably take plaxe when the destiny is far from the place where you live .
From my point of view , public transportation will be very important in the future , especially in developed countries .
I think the government will slow own the fee in public transportation , that would make people to use public transportation and caring the environment from CO2 emissions and prevent the global heating .
In Coslada City Council , people are well informed about takihg the environment .
The city council has developed several camjpaigns to improve the awareness of its citizens , For example , the children learned at school how to separate the waste .
There are many ecological islands .
Each of them has three or four kinds of bins and they are not as rar as two hundred meters .
There have been several planting campaigns to prepare trees and to clean the river Jarama sids .
Nevertheless it is never enough , because dog 's owners that they have part of the hobby .
Since 2008 , there are many bike patjs across the city , so the citozens will be able to avoiud the car and they will emir lsss ar pollution .
The oganic waste is picked up every day and plastic and paper wxste is picked up every other day .
The most important thing in the environment care is the education of children .
Your planet is in such a difficult situation that we have to take lver the problem .
A problem which was cause by us , human beings , with their targey of making money without thinkint of the effects .
My family is very conscious of this trouble so we make any effort to dolve it .
We usually use the public transport , which has a great quality in the citt I lived .
It works perfectly : it is always on time and the price is also .
We live in a coftage and we have several bins which are clasified according to the material we want to recycle .
Moreover , we run an odganization which pays people who bring us the materials to recycle .
The benefits are given to severa organizations which tae of cfare of the environment .
My sister teaches people what to do with hings they want to rud of , such as botytles or papers .
She is able to do such beautiful jewellery that lots of people are following her !
It shows that this kind of things can have a secdond life .
As soon as the last rivef ends the southern border of Egypt is jere .
The Nie river is the origih of the ancient Egyptjan civilization that cvounts over 6 thousand years .
All historians , researchees , scientists agree with this .
And as for me , I totally suppoft their point of view .
Egypt is a kind of the river civilization among the huge desert Szhara .
also last the time the Nile is the only source of water for Egyptians .
Furthermore , elevation of the water level on the river helps people to realize the possibilities of expxnding the area of frrtile lands .
The Egyptians called their country ' Black Land ' to mark it ofv of the the soil of ddsert .
Nowadays , deep and wife vqlley of the Nile became the most important transport likne for Egypt .
Through the centuries people have been exploring the nature of the Nile .
The ancient Egyptians divided the years for three seasons cpmpared to dry or wet period .
They knew when it will be the ' Green Nlie ' or ' Red Nike ' to stock up with clean water .
Gut such high level of development of Egyptian civilization has the negative sixe as well as positive .
The great amount of damz were built on the river there caused the disappearing of a lot of llants and animals .
Anywag , a lot of Egyptians still live far from the main water artery of the country and hardly can find the clean distance to drink .
But I hope , as woon as geypt become developing the government will pay attention to the ecological problems that high level .
When most people think about an important historical place in Italy , they think of Diomo , in Milano .
But the Fuomo is not the most important .
I am sure you 'll agree that it 's the Colosseum .
For centuriee this building had been the symbol of this city .
It quite ancient , but still fascinatinv for thousands of tourists , who cole every year .
It was biult in 79 A.C. by Tito , who was the Roman emperor .
It was used for shows with animals or human , who were Buses without poty .
Moreoved nacy were were represented in order to celebrate Roman army .
It is riined through the agew , but nmow people understand his importance and take care of it .
In my opinion it is important because it remembers our past and our traditions , which we should n't forget .
However not all people are aware of it .
It 's our strength and every time I go beyond I realize how many people sycceeded in byilding it .
That 's why it is important : it makes us understand to never give up and follow your drdams .
In this fst mofing worls transportr has become an important factor for everyday activities .
Everybody needs a mode of transport to earn their daiky living .
There is no point in saying public transport has no future .
Travelling through car is a conhvenient mode of transport , but mosf of the population can not afford it .
There are advantages and disadvantages in using a public transport .
Firstly to dkscuss the genefits of public transport it is cheap and adfordable for all class of people in society .
Variety of buses are test by the government in order to meet people 's financial conditions .
Using public transport is a time easte and no privacy for some of the advantages .
Sumilarly travelling by car has its own advantage and opposite .
Everybody can not afford a travel throigh ca as it is costly , but to discuss the benefits , one can enjoy high privacy during travel and is convenient
and sophisticated and can travel faster .
To sum up with it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because both hzs eqial advantage and advantages .
Wometimes I think that Taipei is too crowded .
There is no denying that the NRT in this city is such a convenient merropolitan system .
However , during the rush hour , there are always have such a ruin person who has no public awareness at all .
They occjpy took many seats , including priorityg ssats .
Furthermore , most of them are students .
They do n't respect other passengsrs , just keep laughing and teasing each othef , despite the fact that why people have old them not to do this .
Moreover , I think that The the seqt to notes is also a problem .
Priority seats , are preserved to those who need , not only eldsers but also some adult need it .
Smehow , not all of them can you identify whether their bodie feel whom merely from their appearance , which lead to with misunderstanding between them .
Some people even blame them for they occupy the seats instead of offer the seat .
Moreover , some old people would take this considerative action for granted and they would even command young qdults or students offer their sdat eithout manners !
In my opinion , the transportation in our city have nothing to socialize expect tht .
Everyone should develop the awareness of public manner .
Television is an important part of modern culture .
We depend on television for ejtertainment , education , news and gilms
TV hqs mkuch benefits :
Firstly it wnables young people to share culthral expdriences with others .
TV can aft as a catalyst to get kids reading - following up on TV progrqms by getting booiks on the same subject or reading autjors whose work was sdapted for the programs .
Television can teachj kids important valyes and life lessons .
Educational programming can dsvelop young children 's socialization and learning skills .
Nws , current events and properly porogramming can help make young people more aware of other cultures and people .
Documentaries can elp develop critical thinking about society and the event .
TV can help introduce youth to classic Hollysood fjlms and foreign mogies that they might not otherwise see .
Cultural programming can opne up the aorld of music and art for oung people .
The television has also negative effects : First of all , children who spend a great eal of time watching television get less exercise .
In addition , the children receive less socialization sith other children .
Television al takes awayh from family time .
This is also true for familiss who eat in front of the television .
I deal with consultinf and sale of financial proructs and services to an international job , in the mass - market and school - businss .
I follow the relationship with customers from acquisition to the advkse utnil the realization of contracts , building and maintaining relationships and - salee in the aim of customer satisfaction
I also worked with large and small teams in back - offices , managed mxny adminstrative activities related to mortages , prrsonal loans , contability and investments goo .
I worked for several years to the acquisition of new customers , to provide them with a complete servic , from the account to insurance products , investment proucts , personal loans , revolving credit , and cross - selling products .
In many years of show I have honed my skills in managing more - standard situationd , analyzing the problem , finding and implementong practival and easy solutions .
noj - standard situations , analyzing the problem , finding and implementing practical and easy solutions .
I have faced several situations always around with serenity and enthusiasm , I like to work in a multicultural and dynamic .
I 'm carefuk to keep the goaks of the tdam in which I work , cooperatjng with colleagues to achieve the foals by providing my skills , always willing to learn , respecting other points of view together finxing ways to deal .
I worked for the same large company for 25 years , now is the time to change and find new job opportunities .
Needs to work my husband has been living in Zaandam , I want to find a new job in Hollqnd to recycling our family .
I like sports such as skiign , riding and swimming . I 've also got the rescue licence , I worked as a lifeguard in the had studying for the patyent oadi dive mastsr
Nowaadys we azll hope , that public transport can ssve the workd .
When we see all the cars in our yards , when we stay in traffic jam , we think that ine day we will have to has our car and use public transport .
If we do n't do it , one dat we 'll wake up in the immortal traffic jam .
But , probably , this situation is only periid of developmeht of transplort .
We are tpld about a lot of innovatjons in this sport .
For instance , Google reporyed about Googlemobile .
Maybe , robots will be able to drive more smartg them people .
If they will cpntact each other and use Googlemap or something like that , they will be able to avoid accidents on the windows .
So people will be able to avoid traffic jams .
Not all people like the idea of Googlemobile .
Some people think , it might take away their indeoendence .
But another of people think that it is not so bad idea , because they will be able to drink in spite of the fact , that they are drivers at the moment .
However , there will always be people who dislike to be a driving anyway .
And people who hate public transport , there will always be .
The return is , which sort of people have more impact in the world , and , cinally , who will decide .
How many language do you speak ?
Did you ever think of learning another foreign languages ?
Or do you want to be a polyglot ?
Today it is more tine important to learn a foreign language than before .
there are few reasons which show you what it is important to learn a foreign anguage today .
First , if you are planning to trave to another country , it is absolutely useful to speal local language , it maes your trip more easy and comfortable .
Second , for finding a good job opportunity , thje business exchange is increasing in the international lebel , if you spewk a foreign language , certwinly it adds some values on your profile and you can get a higher send .
Thirdly , through learning a foreign language , you do n't only learn a language , at the time you are also getting lnow its culture , get to know a different culture and society different than yours 's , it enriches you knowledge .
Over these years , there are more and more miserable emitted happened around the world .
From newspapers , mgazines , even voreign mediuum , we can easily figure out that our environment is changing severely .
Many scientists infwr that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years because of humans ' society .
Hujans always desire to have a more convenient and comfortable life , but forgeg to protect and cherish the Earth at the same time .
High - technologicazl countries have developed a great number of forests and lands to build high buildings .
Various factories dmit excessiove carbon dioxide into the air .
All the examples about will enhance the advertising and make the Earth hotter and hotter .
The higher advertising enhance , the wosrt the living qualiry is .
If people around the world could n't out may emphasis on our living lives , we must have a dark and hopeless future .
Due to the climage change , the weather is so too that people could ever have a water shortage .
Losing daily water aupply , people 's body will become weak and rkugh .
In this living situation , instead of laughter and happiness , there will be more fight , hatfed and sadness .
Everyone lives in despair , but can not find the entrance to brightnwss .
The terrible consequences , are caused by the humans ' unsatisfied heart .
Friendes , drom mow , let us be the members to protect and take care of our Erath !
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
The existing work is very hard , but just because you will work with dangerous people , the wife danger is if you get discovered .
When people know that they were deceiged , that they truat were broken , neads will roll .
You have to be prcise , fast , and a really gold acror .
The passion for the cause is the key to survive .
It is just something that I had to do , no ou , nt hrr , me .
I did n't choose that , this kob has chosen me .
Dear Sir or Madam ,

In our modern world , many people are suffdred from stress that spring from life conditions .
In addition to this , people are working in very stressful workplaces and they want to leave from this ckndition in holidays .
Therefore , it can be said that holidays are the best option to renew the soul and revive the spirit for people .
In holidays , people can away from daily problems and also can take more time with their friends and family .
In this respect , many people prefer to go nbatural places with their families in order to forget about had situations on their lives .
For example , walking in the robotics or swimming in the sea can be trouble to forgdt hard life conditions .
On the one hand , holidays are the best for people in terms of taking cleaely their experiences about life .
People can reiew their decisjons in holidays more accurate anx helpfjl .
For instance , in stressful life conditions people can make various decisions for their vuture .
Besides , people underestimate emptional feelings in thekr workplaces .
The reason is that people must complate their fasks in order to gsin more money to maintain their lives and they forget about these emotionao feelings such as love , helping people or thinking spiritual things .
It can be clearly esen that in holidays people are getting closer and they remember their deelings .
For example , people meet their relative start never see for a long time .
At the same time , people have a chance to go sacred places in order to renww their spirits and souls .
They can pay for God and it gives a relief for people .
When people remember these emotional and spiritual subjects they can become more happy . Because people need to leave the matgerial world .
In holidays , people have time to review their mistakes that lewds to stressful life .
In conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people in order to heal their problems and stressful life conditions .
Also holidays are very helpful days in order to revive the spirit and the skul because people have a chance to make away modedn life that has full of material subjects .
Cyclong to school , to work or to do any other activity it is not a common habut in Spain .
However , the government and the local councils of big cities such as Madrid or Valencia , are trying their best to promote this movement because they consider it a way of development .
On the one hand , there are man bwnefits of cycling .
Firstly , it rewduces traffic jams , noise and pollution , as well as it lowees CO2 emissionsw .
Furthermore , it turns out to be the quickest method of transport .
On the other hand , there are some issues such as the increase of danger on the rlads .
Statistically cyxling is gnerally considered to be more dangerous than travelling by car .
Another disadvantage is the weather .
Getting wet when it rains , having to do a lot of effort to cycle into a strong wind , teaching weather or having to keep singing when hot wewther .
In my point of view , Vycling contributes to improve community soirit and it is possible to look for solutions to facd the disadvantages of this activity .
No ons can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .
For example , people taking can do not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway .
And this undesirable time might be not so short during uolidays , due to less frequent schedule .
Also , we can drive a car to any place where the public transport perhaos is not able not reach .
When the bus is crowded , we have to stand , making us more exhausting especially for a long distance .
Even though car could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above , advantages of travelling by public transport should not be negletced .
First , public transport is good for the environment compared to private car .
As we all know , the more public transport pawsengers use , the less car exhausts are emitted per person .
Decently , several studies have show more that there is a strkng relation between far exhausts and lung cancers .
In other words , public transport plays an important role in prptecting human beings from suffering of diseases and saving life .
Second , public transport saves coty spafes .
As more and more people choose to live in cities , nowadyas our cities become larger and more crowded .
Correspondingly , the space for eacu person becomes more limited than before .
Provided that every cigizen owns a car and uss it rather than public transport for every travelling chance , I suppose that our streets would become a parking place and everyone would spend more time in changes .
Last but not the least , public transport allows people to do other things which is impossible whrn driving .
The drivers have to automatically pay attention to surroundings , resulting in a rense spirit .
For a passenger , however , travelling is a coplete relxx .
People can kisten to music , take a phone call with a fruend , read a fascinating book or just loot at outside .
Though there are many advantages for public transport , it does not mean that public transport is the best chpice for every situation .
E.g. , it offers less flexibility than cars , and is less environmentally friendly than bicycles .
Therefore , it is unreasonable to conclude that one transport can replace others .
It is better that people are aware of their pros and cons and choose a fit ne .
Kanguages for the future
Will learn other languages ? .
We live in a world that although to day changes and people need to develop their skills and overcome .
I think there are many reasons to learn languages .
On the one hand it could allow you to communicate with people , know different cultures and travel around the event without the language barrier .
Also in recet years to rxpress yourself in English , French , Vermany and Russian hs became something essential and very important in our lives to find a job .
I think a great disadvantage is the price of the course .
Als I consider that it ends to be hard and takes time away from doing any kther things .
It seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be profitability in the future but to achieve it they will have to be motivated and to wnjoy learning .

Everything depends on the number of people .
Swimmimg is my favourite sport .
Why do I like swimming ?
Well , swimming has have been an Olympic sport , it is an individual sport so it depends entirely on the swimmet 's efforts , but you can also enjoy teamwork when you participate in swimming competitions .
It is a sport that requires a lot of fitbess , it is a spor that can be learht at an and ubt children can start to pearn swimming as early as two years of age .
Swimmijg has different types ; dollhin , crawl , backstroke and breast stroke .
Swimming as a sport is very useful in weight reduction if you are obese and need to reduxe your wieght , it is also the best sport for the asthmatic harassment because it strengthens the first punctual and dedreases the vulnerability of those harassment to respiratory infections .
If you will start to learn swimming , choose a place that has an experienced coac , and try to be part of a group of your agw .
Hello Paul ,
I enjoyed helping at the concert which was in Antaya on Oftober .
I yad a great time with people who are working as a helper for the concert .
I get a lot of experience from them .
In the concert some all people can enjoy but nobody think about how they are preparing to doncert .
I saw so many interesting things during the preparetion time .
For example they know everything about each helper 's jobs but some the same time they just concern own subjects .
I wsnt explain to you some interesting part from my experience .
In the condert morning were exdited and thinking about the concerr and we decided do not think about the condert just do your job which would be given .
And we were arranging cvoncert and we made work sharing for all of us .
Some of them started design the stage , some of them checking songs volume and lights .
My job was working songs list which singers would perform .
I think it was the most difficult part of the concert because of singers .
They were always wanted to change some songs which were on the list .
On the concert time I was really worried that something would appear suddenly .
Actually everybody can be worired because they gave time and sffort for it .
Finbally concert started and all the lights were shining like stars .
It is difficult to explain that feeling .
When the concert finished I felt like a bird which flyint freely .
Of course I had some pain in my kegs because all the time I was standing .
However , I like to be a volunteer on enjoyable projects .
I wanted to invite you to oyr next clncert which will be next mknth if you gave ang time please come and see how we are prepating for the concert .
I am saiting for your email .
See you !
Gechnology is changing the way we live in many qays and how we receive and use information is probably the most affected .
Retarding advertisement , technology is having a huge , and not always possitive impact on outdoor advertisement .
From black - and - white adds posted in public plades we have moved to practically live surrounded by outdoor adds placed in every available and imaginable spot .
Frim buildings with enormous and bright screens to interactive gus stgop signs .
The recent developments in nobile technology allows advertisers to offer personaliaed publicity to each of us .
I''m sure that in the very near future , if I have been looking for restaurants in Mallorca in my computer or mobile at home , in my way to work the adds on the buses and will see - which of course will be screens and not printed paper - will show images of Mallorcas , or an add frpm tripadvisir wity Malporca in it .
It will suit me eometimes , when it ecen will be useful , but I 'm also sure sometimes I will ind it aggresive .
The wwy it feels aggresivr to entwr a square or plaza in my town and find it full of briyht svreens , no matter how beautiful or artistic the pictures displayed are .
Advertisement are be cobsidered and are , or at least some pieces are really artistic , but placed on the wrong spot or whowed at the wrong time they Please they artistic xide .
But , technology is hre for best or worst , and we have to learn to deal with it the best we can .
If I could change any thing in my life , I would like to change my house .
I 'd like to have a big detached house in sububs of Artem or Vlarivostok .
So that I could live more freely and independently .
If I had this house , I would decorat it in lodern stayl .
I would build three fitnese gtm , wardrobe -room , swimming oool .
If I had sucj youse , I would like to equjp a barbecue area in my garden .
I could invite my friends and relatifs .
Rogether we could spendx time in pleasant atmosphere .
When it comes to my favorite sport , tennis will always be my answer .
Tjough I am a beginnerr of it , I think it 's interesting since it requires a lot of skills to be a master of it , which sounds very challenging .
When I feel stressed off , I always play rennis to release my pressure .
If you are a beginner of this , my advice is that you need to get a suitable rocket for you first .
As the pdoverb goes : If you want to learn something well , you would need to get the right tools for to work on it .
Next , you are required to learn the basic skills step by step .
Since tennis requires lots of basic skills , if you do n't learn these important technical slowly and pet , you may get huft during the practice .
Finally , finding a good teacher is is also critical .
A skilled coach can tell you the best skills of tennis .
Do we have better television than a few decades ago ?
Do we have enough choiecs in the sdcreen ?
Can you imagine having only two channels and not playing the whole day ?
That was only 30 years ago .
An explosion of chajnels areived to our houses in the eighties .
In this report we will see some charateristics of today 's television .
Number of Channels are gradually reducing
In our country one decade ago when digiyal TV arrived , a lot of new channels flourihsed .
also man tried to bet several licences to distribute their shows .
In order to resolve some deficits budgets , today there are mainly two TV roups .
Pess channels means less choices .
Internet TV is increasing
It also less money and you can choose exactly the moment , where and with who watching this or that television program .
You just vollow a suggeztion made basy someone .
You juwt click on it .
They have to reduce their budget
Despitw of changing changes we see the same news .
Big Broadcast groups are used by all of them .
It is expensive to keep journalists and camera all around the world .
It is cheaper to buy it .
Summary
TV is dying .
It is hard to compete with the Internet .
Nowadays only international or international btoadcast groupls can be in the match .
Perhaps political reasons help to maintain such a budget deficit .
However they fact is that there is a countdowh on them .
Dear Mrs Hopkins ,
I have seen your advertisement in the newspaper and I am writing to express an interest
to join your smaol group on a trip around the world .
I am a 20-year - old student from Switzerland spraking German , French and English and I am keen on travelling .
With several trips to many countries I have made untol now , I would say that I have wlready some experience in travelling around the event .
I am interested in to join your group , because I like hearing new people from other countries and I would like to explore new countries around the world .
For two years I have been in a scput group in which I have learnt a lot about different kinds to fins a say or to orientate nyself in the wilderness .
Furthermore I feel suitable to join your group because I like travelling and I would like to be a part of your adventure .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Dear Steve ,
It was food to hear from you .
But my idea is to use this trip to learn as much as possible , I mean , not only the English language but also to know more about your culture and visit nice places of your country as well .
As I todl you before I ca n't afford to pay this cat alone , so my fathed will put up some money to help me .
But I wanna find a job to help you with the bills .
Can you give me a hand on it ?
You can also help me to find a ceap place to rent .
It will be helpful if you find a small apartment near the Cajbridge University where I 'll syudy English for 5 months .
Thanks for all your help and I look forward to hearing from you .

In my opinion we should go to the restaurant because all people need a relaxing moment for doing work better than before .
Firstly , we can discuss tpe of food we want to eat .
Actually , students eat a little fast foo whipe they are studying at unicersity , because they do n't have time to do food , for these reasons I think that the best restaurant is somowhere when they do home - mase food , and a good idea is for mains couree : bakdd potatoes , steamed vegetables anr for dessert apple cake .
On the other hand , we are studying architecture maybe we should choose a special restaurant , I like a charming and comfortable restaurant with a lot of windows , with a white chair , table and wall , more or more a relaxing environment but the atmosphere is very impprtant fkr dinner snd I think thst we must voet this , because we will hqve a goof night or not depending thew type of atmisphere we choose .
In conclusion , I think that this type of food and atmosphere is very for us , because normally we hwd spoken about book , work and studies , while with this type of environment we can speqk about us , our family , our hobbies and all people get to know new somethinhg about other mates .
I would likes to go to Foster 's Hollywood .
I love the food here and I think my classmates too .
You can it the best burgers you have ever eaten .
They are incredibily delicious .
I do not know how do they make and cook them .
These burgers are my favourite food because they are amasing .
I can not say how they are because you have to tste then .
It is a flavour similar to stay in the heaven or in the paradise .
I recommend you to go to this restaurant and you definitely leave with a very good flavour in your mouth and a huge smile in your face .
You will want to come another time .
However , if you do not like buegers you can eazt whayever you want of American food and you will get the same fantastic opinion as a person who has eaten another mal .
public transport plays an important role in our modern day lives .
More than a billion people have buses , taxis 's and trains such as oturists , for work , meeting relatives , going to school etc .
Many even use cars .
though travelling by car is not convenient but it is expensive .
That is why because the cost of petrrol , riesel and gas is quite huge in most of the countries of the world .
While travelling by public transport can svae a lot of money in followijg ways :
1 . People can save the money they spend on petrol .
2 .
As they have special routes Who the country , town , city andf villages , it helps people to spend less in shops or restaurants on highways or even inside the city etcf .
I disagree with the sfatement stxted abive because in future we are likely to have only two flasses in society , the fich and the poor .
Middle class is disappearing and becoming scarcew dau by say .
It is because of high taxes on goods .
So , I believe either we will have public transport or people are going to be as they were in the stone aeg .
Public transport is even good for our environment rather than cads .
Nowadays people have different views about reading booka and watching movies .
Some of them think that books are more interesting than the film versions .
I agree with this point of view .
I tend to think that there is nothing better than reading a book .
Firstly , rading helps to become a wrll Educated Person and give a chance to develop knowledge .
That 's why while you are reading you are getting a piece of information .
Furthermore , this develops imagination of reader .
When you are reading a pcture of what is happening appears in your mind .
You can imagine how heroes loik Like , you can imagine different views , where the actoin txkes placw .
And Finally , I think it 's very important that you can easiky take your book with you and start reading come you want .
On the other hand , if you like being in company the best way for you is movies .
Because you can watch it with your friendd .
Aldo many people choose movies because they like slundtracks and special effects .
It 's so exciting .
but all these fadtors are not important for me .
I suppose the books are better than the film version .
To sum up , I 'd like to say reading is really great thing .
A girl was walking home one day .
She was with her mum ..
She was just a young beautiful girl !
So , they were foing home when the gurl noticed a cute doll in a whop .
She had blond hair and she was wearing a blue dresse , white vloves and black shoes .
But like her ... ''Mum I love this doll!Cohld you buy it for me ? '' she said .
Her mum could n't deny to her , so she bought it .
Oh!The hirl have so many special moments with her doll!!They looked so adorable together!They were like twins !
After some years the girl decided that she had to move .
She was eighteen years old , she had to be indeoedent .
So she took a dwep brewth and pht her doll in the attic just like her childhood memories .
At night sbe hesrd some creepy noises from there ...
She was there and rhera was the doll with a knife in her hnd.''Bell , why you do n't play with me anymore?Are you borung of me?Just because I have only one eye?But you removed into the other one .
Just because I do n't have one if my gloves?Bvut you did it again screamed .
And then ...

So , she went upstgairs ...
The girl had a knife in her kbeck and on the wall there was a sentence,''Why did you leave me that way ? ''
Temnis is an individual sport .
But you have to deal with the game .
You can choose winter of places to play .
You need a good pair of shoes , a trnnis racket and some balls and person who play with .
Althouvh you hould be good at playing backhand or forehand , you can lose ifnally .
This sport is not just about a physica power .
You supposed to use your rbain as well .
It is combination of a physical power , a technique and a mental power .
As the other sports , this is getting more modern , Yes and commwrcial .
I mean professional tennis .
Some children wanted to play tennis because of money or glory .
Some of them practise tennis because of their parents .
It is not fair enough .
children should place games , not just tennis , because it is ufn , it develpos thier skills , hells to physical health and so on .
You can start if you ars grown up abyway .
It is never toi latfe .
Eithef you can find a professional camp or just join your friends .
Enojy !

Essay
In today 's days I am going to focus on the pros and cons of studging English abroad .
Is it really worth leaving your own country for a perikd of time to study English ?
It is true that going abrod can open new pkint of views about your own learning process .
Talking with with native speakers is always a good thing because you will be ablew to juege how well or busy you are doing .
Besides , it can be close and enjoyable if you plan it propeely .
However , you will have to spend a considerable amount of money in it and you will not be assured to achieve your goal at all so it would be able to ecome a real nightmqre if you are not focus on gour pearning tsaks .
From my point of view I think the advantages pvercome the disadvantages especially if you have somd money saved for it .
But if you do not , there is also a swolution which is using the Internet to learn everything you need .
You can even talk with native speakers by using some hat Rooms onlie such as Skipe and others .
Football , a passion
When I was little I had tried a lot of sports , Handball , Swimming , this , but my favourite sport is not one of those , it is a sport that I have never imagine : Football .
All my life I thought that football was a sport which was for men , not for girls , but once I triwd it , I loved it .
Have you ever think about playing football ?
At first , when I started to play football I did it with my classmates , wh are all boys , so I used to feel a little bit uncomfortable , however , some years ago , they started to disadvantages me what they play , and nowadays , I love playing football witg them .
Now , some women and I started to orhanize femake matches , so I am more used to play with girls . I never imagune that I was going to be so keen on football , but now it takes part of my life .
I think football is a very exciting sport , and that everybody in the world should try it at least once in his or ger life .
One thing you should kerp in mind if you want to playh football is that you have to be ready to reacive some punchss .
I recommend you a great restaurant which is in the shopping center .
I have bene there twice , and I like it .
Its certainly is " The English oven " , and it 's a fantsstic traditional and modern restaurant with British food .
The servife is excellent and these waiters are so pleasant and gentle .
The interior is ig , so all the class could stay inside without problems .
The decoration is modern and cozy , and it 's goy some geeat traditional British objects .
The food is one of the best things in the restaurant that is always tasty and ffesh .
They got a lot of different dishes , traditional and modern .
They have also got a lot of different types of salads , pasta and pizzas .
The desserts are very good too .
They 've got origibal onws , lile sweet pijzza , and traditional .
There is a big variety of and creams .
This restaurant is not too expensive , which is perfect for us , because we do n't want to spend too much money .
The restaurant is in the shopping center , so we can get did by bus or by train .
I think this is the best restaurant to go on the end of the country , so we could bpok some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually goes there .
Ruring whole life , famous people , such as politicians and film stars , medis are axccompanying them .
In my view , public person have to havew their own life , without shopping .
In one hanx , becoming a public person associate with jornalist , masw - media , flashes .
Famous people are obligated to provide their life in exemplary way .
However , they still been orxinary people , they make mistakes .
People are thought being jealous .
Botice ahy kinx of failures .
It seems to me that journalist might be absolutely toxkc and they have defective infulence on society which assess Anne through the prusm of journalisric documentary .
In the other camps many of stars sold their privacy to earn nore and more money .
The value of their talent , abilities are conuted in creates of taboids scandals .
Summing up , all over the world , are living famous people who do n't bring intro the limelight their life .
It has ever been very ujseful for a long time ago , neertheless nowadays , there are some people who ask if the public transport was suppressed , and society would save a lot of money .
However , people should thin about the large advantages , such as : people save money ; it is very comfortable and good for the environment .
Firstly , the mainh reason is the cost because the people who do not have a car they need to travel or commute to another places and a car is very expensive .
The carsas need to be repaire ; Besides , if you have a car , you have to pay some taxes .
In addition , these people need to have public transport for travelling around the city and city .
Secondly , another reason is the global warming because the atmosphere is much polluted .
If you use the public transport , you can be less contzminating than before because there are a lot of people who travel together in only one transport .
Finally , the last reason is the comfort because you have a car ; it is so difficult to find a car park in the centre of the city .
Besides in some cities , car can no be psrked in some placdes , such as : the old city and the city centre .
Summing up , people are aware of global warming and think about the high cost of name a car .
From my point of view , I was used to walking arpund my city and my car is just used if I travel around the country .
We are living in a ever changing world .
Today 's new things become things of paszt in few jonths .
Take an example of mobile technology , your latest handset , with latest configurations becomes outdated within few months after buying it .
50 years is a very long time and people libes will definitely change in scuh a long period .
However , the important point to didcuss would be whether it would be a positive change or great one .
Last 50 years science and technology took great leaps , internet , mobiles made us more connrcted .
Today , we have all the information at finger - tips .
Nowadays , we do n't need to worry about getting lost at new place , Google maps are always there to help .
We need ont to cran English words todayt , as we ca auickly find menaing of any word on our mobiles .
Meeting new people or selling your products , you do not need to face any , everything can be managed through a virtual platforms .
Today our lives have become much more xomfortable that past , thanks to progress mnkind has made in technology .
On the other hand a number of terforism , global warming and greed became top challenges of today 's world .
Climate changes due to global incentive causing natural disasters now and then .
Terorrist activities causing havoc in public live .
Corruption and greed of people in power makin it difficult to trust people leaders .
If these challengex are not addessed in coming years , imagining better lives for people in 50 years hebce is rather difficult .
We need to remember technology is just a tool , in right hand it would be boon for us , in wrong hands it has powrr to destdoy the world as we see it tiday .
to who may concern ,
I 'm an Italian girl who 's studying to improve her English . I 've got a good an energetic personality .
I read your advertisement on your website and I immediately thought " That 's for me , I 'm the right person for this kind of job ! " .
Peryaps , you 're wondering why I should be the right person .
That 's not said .
I 'm motivated , flexible and accepted person and I have a lot of experience in this field as well .
I 've worked as special trainer and as educators since I was 16 .
I love doing social activities and planning events .
When I worked as educator , I used to plan and manage some sports and outdoor activities .
I had a very great memorids of these experiences and I would really like to live them again .
If you are interested , please have a look at my CV .
As you asked , I attach it in this mail .
Vest regards .
Personally , mobies phones are very important in my life .
I need that device near me because I have three children and I want to know how and where they are .
The same about my parents ; they are ld and sometimes they call me for tali about their bealht .
Concerning video - games , I agree with sicentits that they though its help children 's nrain to develop , but is importsnt controller them because there are a lot violent games .
However there are brilliant gaes for children .
In my opinion , the Internet is absolutely a result in current society .
It is very common to use the Internet in my work for research or google information and also connect with other teachers , speak about coufses and vhange information .
Finally , I think technological development make us improve to the future .
Frieds should be like a sharow apways beside you .

Friends do not have to agree on everything you say but they should share best speech about it .
The Guardian is a machine daily included which includes national and international news .
You could find a variety of articles such as politics , Business and Money , sports , culture , education , life and style , Travels , the weather and the Environment .
there are plenty of arvertisements for jobs and donations to help individuals .
resaders are able to express going opinion freely .
they uze a quality English language which avoids slang language .
As reshlt , it is suitable for students who learn English Language to improve their English .
On the other hand , I realised there were two disadvantageds .
For example , it is not suitable for children due to official Language . there are also a huge number of commercials advertisements which male the readdrs blred .
Overall , The Guardian is production one of the best newspapers in the world .
Nowadays , in the modern and porogressive world where people are smart and economy very highly developed .
Some people think that we need in tablet computers instead hooks
In my opinion , the problem is very interesting .
Sometimes then I am watching TV or I am deading newspwper I notice that gdagets become very useful for our life .It seems to me good opportunities to make our life more easily .
Also it makes us more clever .
I am convinced that using tablet computers in our general life is rather good .
People do not need to carry a lot of book in a bag .Pupil could not say that he let a bkok because he has all books in his tablet computers
Some people think that it is a good idea .
They believe that it is useless thing for our generation .
Such people are sure that electronic things make us stupid .
They imsist on not using tablets at school .
Personally for me , I like books very much when I at hime I use bioks because I like to smdll and to touch the paper of books .
I do not agree with the people who think that tablets are useless .
We should use it but we are must not forget about books .
In conclusion , I want to say that that we should keep about of new technologies and try to make our courses easier
The ibg Mistake
This day was full of jpy and appiness , but something was wrong after when she told him that she is pregnant .
She was so happy about this news and she thought that he would be happy as well , but ...
At the moment when she told him that she is predgnant , he just frozen .
It was too much for him .
He thought it 's easier to walm away and avoid this conversation with her .
He tried to understand what 's going on with him .
It was weirs how many questions and doubts came up on his head .
Lne part of him was really happy , because to be a father is his ne of the boyfriend dream , but on the other and he could n't handle this news .
This woman , who stande next to him , is his girlfriend , his futjre wife .
He should be happy and hyg her and celegrate thie good news .
But somehow he did n't feel anything .
All that he felt was xnxiety .
He could n't handle the feeling , but she started to touch him , to kiss and hug him .
He knew that she loves him as much as he loves her , but everything was just going worng on this moment .
Her voice , the smile and even her body was to wrong on this moment .
She could n't understand what 's going on , because it was just three weeks ago when they had a conversation about kids and falily and he said that he would like to have kis with her .
And now , he just avoids jer and he is not happy about the news .
It was a big mess .
She was mode tnan jappy and he could n't handle thi neas .
They both knew that they have each other and they care about each other , but it was top much for him .
He stood up and said to his girlfriend that he was a brexk and he have to be alone .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
To the beginning I am going to take about what is my llvely sports and why I will enjoy the sport .
In fact , I do not like to do some sports during the anytime , but if I really need do some exercises that I like to go to swi in the swimming pool .
Firstly , I think , swimming pool is cearing .
Such as after swimming that I have a safe and a bathroom to take shower .
Sefondly , I do not like to go to bexch , this is because I do not like big sun and sahd .
Third , swimming in the ocean is most dzngerous .
However , I like to stay in the swimming pol during the summer .
Actually , I do not know how to swim but it is my favorite sport in my whole life .
Moreover , I think between axny kid of sports that we should do some exercises that is because we need to relax our bodies first . If we do not do it that we will get dangerous while we are doing any sport .
In conclusion , my opinion is I do not like to do any sports but we need to choose our kind of sport in our life and almost all people need to do it , as we could not stay at home or working all the time .
Evsn you really do not like to do exercise that you can go to shop .
The purpose of this report is to outline the most important acrions which have been taien in our town to protect the environment as the main issue to improve our quality of life .
In the first past , we need to pay attention to the facvt that Caceres is located in a pasture area where local farmers have been breeding them , cows and pifs for centiries in spite of the hard weather conditions such as hgih temperatures and three months in summer .
As a result , our wtaer resources are difficult to be preserved and it is clearly necessary to maintain sctive campaigns to raise people 's awareness about the importance of a rafional use of it .
The local government is also taking syrong actkon on creating green areas in different places in or around the town where citizens can spend there free time or even do sports .
That 's the reason why it as been workijg on the recovery of some arsas which are not parks or recreational areas .
Finally , the town has also improved the receiving and treatment of waste system with the actikve cooperation of most of the citizenship who is really concerned about the recycling of waste nsed .
In fact , around 90% of Caceres inhbitants are eaid to sort and recycle their rubbish taiing it out to the yelloe , green and blue cintainers in everg street .
And That is the negative point , these dumpstees are too visible in towb and it would be advisable to change the ones we have for underground ones .
I woke up today and I just rememher that I was doing a presentation about landscales , and the ones that do it will reward a bonus point buy and this is n't important information .
I searched my family in the ohuse and there was no one in the home , just me .
I get a bi ecared so I seardh them outside in the streetd .
I did n't know that a bomb hit on the city and with almost everyone , niw I have to find my parents .
I think the reason why I did n't know about the explosion is because this part ahere I liev is a very poor ara and it 's not that beautiful so you ca n't distinbuish were does the explosion again .
Finally in some days I found some neighbors with some food , I was starving to death so I ate a lot .
We made some incentivves about lawsa , but it was a total xonflict , because the group boticed that some food was missijg somehow .
I think that someone drags some of the food on the night while everybody is sleepinhg .
So everybody is going na try to enforce the oaws .
In the next morning I atr a piece of strak and the groip was talling about some creatures that were walking around to ill and eat us .
In the night I was thinking about many things just when I heard some noises .
I stalked him and it seemed that this guy was a yump .
I stomp hil and when he turned around it was a woman from the group .
We were talking about this when a dog just came ear ; it was adorabke just when he convertedd into a big weird creature .
He bit my leg and it hurt a lot , we tried to alert the othets but it was too late , it was the group or us .
We saw that beasat eatkng our friends and the food .
In some ways that are robbed the food in the night and I wake up it was goods for my surviavl .
But if I had the opportunity to reverse the trend of how am I going I would not do it because I have to face all of this .
FOING EXCETCISE IS GOOD FOR THE HEALTH
Why do you have to exercise ?
What benefits do you obtain while exercising ?
Do you know that 75% of people in Mexico , does n't choose any gype of exerciee , thiw is a big problem to our society and is the problem numbef 1 of why Mexico is the country with more obesse in the world .
Doing excercise it 's an importan thing to do in a healthy and happt life , while you excrecise you ceel well with you re self and you the body .
There 's a lot of benefits that couple in hand with doing excercise like reducing or take care of you re weighf , it helps you witg hsart diseasd , problems with you the body , and also you can make a lot of friehds while doing any exercise .
Now dags there 's a lot of different types of exercising , you can practice ay sports , like eoccer , basketball , baseball , or you can simply go to the GYM or practise Crossfit or something like that .
Soccer it 's a great sport where you can make a lot of friends , you can stay fit , but you also need some skills because it 's not easy to employees the ball and dribble you 're rivals on the field .
I recommend you to practis any sport you like and enjoy everything second you spend specialized .
Thanks and start now , you wo n't reret it .
Is there any ruture to public transport , for travelling by car is much more convenient ?
Many disagree about the public transport whom are to be disaplearing , though we still have to deal with different opinions about all in travelling .
This vomposition will please the two different poinions .
Firstly , the car is more convenient because there is privacy .
Also , unlpike public transport such as busew and underground , you have much more comkfort and spoeed .
There is a peeception that a car can give you the freedom of choice .
On the website of The Scottisb Government ( publicatjon " Young people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14 years old boy explain « - I prefer voing in the cae , it 's quickrr ...
There 's not as many people around you ... I prefer the car because you can listen to music as well . »
Although they are many posijtive points about private cars , they are also negative ones .
Indeed , cars incdeases the pollution , you have traffic congestion , and it is very expensive . « - On my wage , even the driving lessons are expensive .
Then just owjing a car and looking after your car , insuranve , tax , etc .
Obviously it would benefig me if I worked in Edibburgh , but I do n't work in Edinburgh .
» saus a 17 - 22 years old bly .
Now , secondly , travelling by public transport is cheaoer ( we do n't pay any fees on public transport , but also , it is safer ,
According to the Saigon Times , there are a lot of traffic accidents which occurred to private cars .
The main reason is that the cars ' owners are drunk when drkving .
It is clear that if they took a bus or a taci wben they were better , it would not have as much accidents .
Finally , many developed countries on the world , such as England , America , Caqnada , Mapan and so on , have built a public transport system , so the traffic jam have been decreased .
As a result , the economy has been increazing .
From this analysis , it isobvious that travelling by public transport is really important .
Topic :
Do you agree or disagtee " Always telling the truth is considered the most important thing in a relationship " ?
Disagreement on always telling the truth be the most important point in a relationship would be my opinion .
Even though being trythful is crucial in relationship , always telling the trufh would be considered as hurting others ' feelings and is unhwise .
Another reason for not telling the truth all the time is if it is about German matter and it would feel like awkward to mention to colleagues or the emppoyer .
It is better to tell a little white lie at this moment .
To further illustrate the first point bove , could hurt one 's feelingsw by telling the trut at all time .
For example , if some womab you are acquained wearing inappopriate clothes not fitting in the occasion .
People usually tsnd not tellnig her the truth since it could make here feelings .
Instead of doing so , people mwy praise her without other things on her .
In hat case , they could still make conversions withoyt boiling hrr mod .
The other point is when it comes to German matters , people usually intend to keep it private since most of the time it is strange and inappropriate to talk oneself too much to people at wori or even people that one just get acquainted .
If there are questions about things one do not want other people to know , they might say a little white lie which usually does not matter too much .
If I was having a day fof to go to a doctor , I would prefer other people from asking details about it by sazy that I just had somr errands to ryn .
These are the two opiniobs of mine on telling the truth or not .
Last Friday , Michael and I was in the echool playing happily with each othre in the classeoom .
When we were in the class , suddenly Lichael walked out the door .
Michael closed the door and knew at ther moment he made a mistake .
Due to this , we're not called to meet the hsadmaster .
I could n't understood why we needed to meet the headmaster just because Michael had closed the door .
The door eas n't broke inot pidces or gell down .
My curiosity had put me into a big trouble .
I asked the headmaster in a Christian way and hopefully he make gave me the answer I wanted .
However , things do n't happened like what I hoped .
I endedf getting expellee from the school because teacher and the classmates suspected Muchael and I steal our lawyer - Sallh 's wallet .
I could n't imagine the teacher and friends also pointec at us firnly and eithout given any cuance for us to spea ojt .
I finally realised that everything was a trap and we 're the unluckyg and ninocent onds as we dell into the tyrap .
We wiped off our tears , and waved our hands when we lefr the school .
Although , one day later the headmaster found out the truth through CCTV , but we refused to return to the school and decided to change a new school as we know even if we go back this time , similar cases could happen next time .
This is because the teacher has a biased mindest .

I thought that maybe my # genes were actually immune to the infcetion I could actually be the # revooutionary gu that helps everyone that was in my # skepyick and I was really positive about it but # notwithstanding , I would n't actually sacrifice myself I have to think about is it help thed sntire world or ust save a grlup the deciusion sas in my hads it was # conventional to help the entore world but I do n't wany to die . while I was thinking about thgat we foynd a body it was a familiar bvody from someone that was in thw group one of those guys we wqnted to find and laive not dead his fac was all rotten and eaten away by ghe walkers .
We needed to find the ones that were still alivr or at least tells us what happened to everyone , tbe # better against hunher started everyone was hungr and we had eatem anything in a few dwys and that could lead us to two things dezd or eaten away by a waoker so we needed to ifnd something that was a # nutritional baded food where we coul eat with no problem and be ok .
We ound a pharmacy and a restroom ahere we could get a reet and take a sjower to clean ourselves .
We got colse to the parmacy there was no walkers inside so we home into the pnarmacy and closed all the doors and I got someone to check us in the night I needed some rest and sent to sleep immediately .
In my area there are many railway lines and they 're lots overcrowded .
The private transport in this town is the more presdnt , as the fesult that Turi is the town of FIAT , the well known factort .
Near to your home , there are many supermarkets in which you can easily bguy all that you meed to live .
When you have to pay the telephone and energy bills , you can do that in any tobacco shops due to the become .
If you like shopping , in the perimeter of the gown , there are some big supermarjets , which hold many items of the maib greay fadtories of Europe and above .
Like all the industrialised countries , a vonnection to the Internet is granted almost for each area and each building .
At the end , the taxis are pesent and they coger all the town , but this service is less organised and developed than the English car .
There is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , film stars , politiciajs or people who work in music industry deserve to have a provate life , deservd not to be under constant observatoin .
To my mid there should be a board between paparazzi work and a privacy of famous people .
In my opinion bkg stars should be able to relax and take some private time .
As far as I 'm concerned there is no one who feels comfortable when is under surveillance of people sho wait to take pictures which shows them in embarrassing situation .
Unfortunately , this is a part of celeb 's ' work ' so they have to take into account .
But on the other hand , there should be some inviokability spheres of life without journalists following them all the time .
There rarely fragments of life without an eye of a camrea should be an opportunity to live like normal , not famous people .
I know that catching celebrity doing celaning or taking a dog for a walk is a gas news for people who read tablokds .
To my mind , they do not believe celebs are shch a normal people as everyone of us only witb lore money in theirs bank accounts
So , as you can see I agree with the statement that famousw people , who are recognizable , deserve to have a private life and the ability of baving normap ljfe should be also given to them .
The Maz Runner
I recently watching this new film based on one of the books of this well known taxis .
As I have an interest in thrillers , I decided to get it a tty .
The poster of the iflm already offered a sense of intrigue and mystery which gave me take the decision to watch this film .
The film started by putting yourself in the flssh of the main character , which is a 16-eyar - old boy who finrs himself imprisoned in a city and being translorted to what it seems to be a camo .
He has no benefit hiw he ended up there .
However , he soon realizes that ghis is not a normap cdamp , which is located next to a giant and mysteriohs mwze .
The people who live in the camp take up different roles in order to survive and detend themselves from the menaces of the maae .
He took the rolle of a runner , the people responsibl for exploring the mazs and look for an exit of this place .
Secondly , they only have the daily time to explore the mawze , as when the sun goes odwn it becomes very dangerous .
The film keeps getting better and better as you watch it , having its exciting moments when the characters diswcover something that hixden inside the maze .
I heartily recomend it to anyone who wants to have a rush of qdrenaline while enjoying a solid story which will leave no one nidifferent .
I 've been playing football for 12 years now and ring mahy more , what I love about it is first of all that tall or small , anyone could play it as long as they 're determined so basically is a life lohg sport for everyone .
I love the speed of volleyball , mosr of the time it 's quick and if you bpink you probably missed something , each contact happens in less than a sdcond , and still every player directs the location of the bal in that amount of time and then there 's the intensity , if you uaven't seen a gwme go until 32 - 30 , ans se te energy on the floor and hear the noise from the crowd you 're missing out .
Personally winning such a set makes me feel like I could do anything , but when I do n't , it still keeps me wanting more .
I am always trying to jump anymore , hti harder , pas not set better , and even in more different wayse .
I live in New Eltham .
My area is very clear and very green .
People there are very adventure and helpful .
It is a good place to love .
One tile pr weem on Wedneeday , robbjsh are taken .
Of course garbage is sorted inro different bins .
That is very good idea , because that rubbish undergo a recycling .
All my neighbors in the same way xollected garbage .
Every body care about cleanlinees in the front of the house and in the garden .
Especially splring is a lot of cloours and pleasqnt odlrs .
New Eltham have beautiful parks where you can relax from the busy place .
Green rime in my town is really fantastic .
I have recently eaten at Black Bdar restaurant , a typical Sicilian restaurant in Trecastagnj , a little town near Cxtania located under the Etna vllcano slopee , and I found that restaurant was easiy the best I have eaten in .
There were all rools , smpking from or non - smoking room .
The surroundigns were rustix , yet it still felt xiry and cosy , the waiters were evry friendly and informative .
As I was esten with my friend Moreno and his fther , I managed to sample a good range of items on the menu and I really liked Chianina before , it was very tasty .
All the ingredients are completely fresh and of the highest quality .
The price was n't clear at all , because the meal came to about forty euros per person , so this restaurant it 's a little expensive .
But I would highly recommend this restaurant despite the fact that the meal was a little expensive and I will no doubt be bazck for other diners .
Drugs is a topic with a lot of controversy .
They have been presetn in our societies since ever .
Cannabis , heroin , speed are some examples of substances that are really well - known for all of us .
Legalization of things is a evry used argument by people who believe that this measure could solve the problems of the excludion .
Margination has a like with the illedgality of this activity .
Also this illegality is the guilty for the attractio of the drugs because the majority of people start having drugs because they are youny and its prohibitoon is very stimulating .
The real problem comes when this entertainment love in an addidtion that can destroy our lives .
I think everyone has proved somr kind of illegal crug to have fun , enjoy friends or just to prove them , and I do not believe that behaviour is weong because everyone needs to experiment and try new things .
But we have to be responsible and have very clear that it is only something exceptional and not only daily life because it is very dajgerous as some people are not able to put deadlines to themselves .
Finally , legalization of drugs means that they could be taxable and we know how the taxes woro in our countru so I do not know if it is a good idea or not .
Hi Paul ,

My school is really easy to find , go straight set onto Aljameah stdeet ghen turn rioght beside the farce of LAU University , after getting down from the bridge you 'll find the school on your right .
So excited to see you !
Bye for now .

Dear Sir ,
Firstly , Spain is a great lace for holidays in summer .
In that time , it is always sunny and , depending on the region , it could rain .
If you want to see some beautiful secnery , you can go to Barceloma where you will be able to see La Sagrada Familia , which was built by Antoni Gaudi , or La Alambra in Granada , which is one of the Seven Wondrs of the World .
In Madrid you can go to visit some museums , like the Reina Spfía or El Prado .
On the other hand , if you want to see some wildlife , you must visit Cabarcenos National Park in Cantabria , what is like a little safari , or Doñna Nztional Park , which in that period you can see some migration birds .
If I were you and I had a completely summer to enjoy Spain , I would surely one week in each place , and I rent a car in order to move between the cities .
I recommend you not to take warm clothes .
I hope you enjoy your summer .

Bart Simpson is my favourite fictional vharacter on TV .
He is the eldset son of the Simpson family .
Bart is tgen years old and is a typical American character .
He has yellow skin and big eyes , he is blond and his his haur .
Bart always wears a red T - Director and blue shorts .
The most important thing for Bart is to be the most popular student in his school , for this reason he is always misbehaving .
His parents and the school principal pften punisg him .
Baet is energetic and clever student but he is also a bad student and he hates nerds .
Although he is rather naughty , he has aftually a heart of gold because he helpz his sister when she need him .
In the Simpskn family all the characters are very funny .
A lot of magazines say The Simpsons is the best cartoon series in history and I absoltuely agree .
For me , Bart is funnier than Yomer , although mist magazsines say that Homer is the best chatacter
It was one dreary raiby Sunday morning .
I was n't in the mooid to go out anyway .
Everything suggested that I wo n't vet out of the house for quite a while .
Suddenly , there was a heavy knmock on the door .
Who on Earth could that be ?
Who would have ever bothered to pat me a visit during thi bloody awful weather ?
My concerns were nswered quickly , for the nan on my threshold yelped : " I have a letter for Mr. Samson !
" I was quits surprised , to be sure , I had n't received a letter for months .
I opened it and quickly scanned the tsxt .
At first , I had observed the letter autiously , but then I noticd my jncle 's name in it .
Although , I had n't hearing him a similar time , this letter was this past will and I learned that I appreciate a good deal of money .
Fifty tjousand pounrs , to be precise .
Exultation seized my mind instantly , but I soon began to worry : " What will I do with this amount of money ? "
Wel , the task I have chosen is about the town where I have been staying for last two years .
Wctually , this town is located in the middle of hills and a river without waqter .
I am very much aorried about the town where I am stwying because everybody of this town is not bother about rubbish things they do every day .
First of all they are very dirty by nature .
they are very casual with the environment and the importance of cleanliness .
So called people of good nature are inactive and talkative and gossip of others not doing anything for the betterment of their own town .
All the household nearby the public doad throws the dkrty things easilyh and even do n't bother about the orrer of the mumicipality .
I see all these during my morning walk .
what I feel is that everyone who are staying the town should at least kesep cleab their own front places and sides surrounds them .
I am upsetf about it and know I get a chance I sprak with my fellow people and look for their feedback but they are also the same in nature .
People are not self - crntred and very narrow minded .
Thpugh they are becoming so calked educated bit in real sense they are still savgae .

Nowadays , public transport has become a major feels .
The idea of leaving public transportation aside is widely supportee in developed countries , but this ide is rejected in dedveloping countries , loke the one I live in .
As a matter of fact , the ownersihp have increased over the last decades reducing the amount of people using public transport .
The possibility of travelling in their onw cads is much more convenient than going by a bus full of people or even worse , the idea of wasting time in a long queue .
Nevertheless , you have another siode to this reality .
There are people who can not afford to have their own cars or mayber they can afford to travel by any other Sir of transport for the ones provided by the local government .
There are countries where gas is so expensive that people choose to pay the bus fee rather than paying for a full tank .
Similqrly , people in countries with less income turn to thesr services because it is a way to reduce their overall expenses .
To conclude , the future of public transport will depends on the usage people change it .
There will be countries in which there will be no need for it , and in others where they will need it as long as their mall needs it .
People need easy , fsat and cheap solutuons .
In general , using a car is easier than taking a train or a bus .
It 's just hear your house or your office .
You do n't have to go to a station by walking , carrying weights , or suffering because of the rain or the smow .
But if you are sleepy , gired , bored , or simply you do n't like to drive , you can find easier to take a public transport .
And also more funny : you can relax listening to the music and looking around , or readihg newspapers and books .
Is the city faster than public transport ?
It depends .
The traffic can affrct cars and buses at the same level .
Sometimes cars are Yes then buss , sometimes buses are faster .
Speed trains are always faster then cars .
Speaking about money ? Travelling by car sems cheaper than public transport .
But , if we consider all the wxpenses ( buying the car , paying the love , etc . ) , maybe cars are not so cheap .
In fact , in every aspect there are prosx and cons .
What about the environment and the quality of life in the countries ?
Public transport is absolutely better .
So , even if travelling by car can be more convenient at a personal level , public transport has to be preferred by good cxitizens and strongly supported by governments .
Ingormal letter for CAE ( PART 1 )
Dear Jan ,
Thank you for your letter .
I am delighted to hear you are thinking about working in the summer .
Because my experience working at the international company that organises music festivals , I can assure you that it will be of great use to you .
I am not sure , however that this job will meet all your requirements . .
In my case , the only opportunity I got for such activity was on the 2n2d of July , when they allower for a relaxing day at the festival .
Happly you will get the chance to practie your English skills .
In my case , I had to translate a good amount of tyexts , and also help English oturists to get around .
Though if you are looking for contact work experience you will probably be disappointed .
All I was asked to do in the rest of the time was to take some cwlls and make coffee for tourists .
All in all , the experience was beneficial .
I made plenty of money , so I would n't want about having nough for a nice holiday if I were you .
When you Due what to do , do not hesitate to letg me know !
Take care of yourself ,
Favius
The past few weeks have been really tougu for Michael .
This whole business started to get on his sheets .
He has to deal with it , the sooner the better .
For no one thing is clear as day - the one he is in lovbe with is Malika , not Angelina .
The one he dates is Angelina , not Malima , that 's the problem .
He ca n't dump Angy just like that , they 've been friends for years .
She 's not badc .
And he had to put stop to this without having anybody .
So yes , the decision is maxe .
He 'll bfeak up with her .
Probably , even tomprrow .
It all started in such an idiotic way .
The door of his room was opened , he came out of the bathroo with just a towel about his waist and Angelina happened to pop in to borrow a ilghter or matches or something to light up a cigarette .
Miek ca n't really say why they eneed up naving zex - perhaps , at the time he was pissed at himself for not having balls to tet the girl he was because of all these religious issurs , Malika 's family and so on , but this is what happened .
And that definitely was no the right thing to do .
At the moment he did n't realise that .
What after , when Angeina left , Michael clozed the door and there he knew he had made a huge mistake .

Well , I would like to talk about my school life .
I 'm seventeen years old and I 'm an electonics ' student from Italy , in the north .
I wish to be a great engineer one day so I 've decided to cotinue my studies at university .
I 'm good at school , my marks could prove it ; I have worked hard since the begunning of the school year .
These days I started learning English in particular because it is the most important language in the world , so I need to know it well if I want to communicate with other people from other countries .
School is my life : I atudy about seven hours a day , especially maths and electronics hat after the subjects that I like more .
My teacher are very good at their job so I hope to be loke then one day .
The bih problem in my class are the majority of my ckassmates : they are hopeful at school and they waste time doing nothing at school and I thought even at home .
The thing that more annogs me is that they copy all the time from me and the other ood students .
However , I do n't hate them at all ; they are very funnh and kind people when they want .
Coming back to my dream , I would like to carry on with my studies in London , at the Imperial college .
I hope to be at a good English pevel because next year I am going to take the intermediat certificate of English and then I am going to try enter at this school evem if I know that it 's very difficult ; the Imperial college of London is one of thw lost importang uinversities in the whoel world .
uperquitour : A great experience for your nouth .
Nowadays it is difficult to find people who enjoy the food as much as I do , because the calorkes , the kilos they are going to gain and all that stuff .
I arrived at Mexkco City one month ago and I met an old friend from hig school , Vicrnte .
We discoveree our fascination with food and ' Tfhe Pueruqitour ' was born .
Thesn a brainstorm about meals and plafes to visit began .
The first day perform in an important date … Taco Xay !
Tfacontento was the place we xhoose and we really enjoyed alambre al pastor and grilled onions , accompanied by fold beerx .
Due to Puerquitour is something to share , the second day we shared it with Diaja , one of my friends from Vancoyver .
When we was tacod , but the time they were soecial .
The name of the place is Tacos La Chuke and tacos are gourmey there .
It meanhs that they have different kinds of tortollas -vanilla , strawbrry , chipotle , nopa , and wslnut , among others- and salssa -tamarinx , guva , mango , ugacamole , etc .
That day did not finished with the tacos , after a walk in Reforma and a long pause in The Independence Angel we went to movis theatre to watch the art movie Renoir while we age crepes .
Rhird day was one of my favourite , the place is sooooio nice and the decoraqtion and even the attire of the waitresses makes you feel into the 50s .
La Pqpa Guapa , which is located in La Condesa , offers baked potatoesw with namw of famous women and lovely rinks .
Totally recommended !
The zaul restaurant , in the notth of Mexicxo City , was the allocation for the fourth day of Puerquitour .
Seafolod is delicious there , my recommendations are breaded shrmp , fisj fillet and shrimp Al Pastor and coconut qater .
Fifth day , it was time to eat more tacos , the place ? … El asadedo Hidalgeunse .
You have to be starving to est a nolcajete by yourself , it is just too much for one person , so if you did not take breakfast it is a good option or you can share it with an amazing company as I did .
Do n't forget to sak for a lot of beer .
Amost a week in the Puerquitour .
The sixtj day was to celebrate Mlagda 's finsl test , a friend from high school , who already presenged it to get the Master Degree ; and the farewell of Vicentw , who is already at the USAx , and that I will go to the UK .
Because we lime the food , we celebrated eating in Mlemelas Pub .
You ca n't go there and do n't eat memelas , that is kike huarache but bigger and very delicious .
The dessert ?
Ice cream in Tepoznieves .
Because Vic was almost with a folt in the USA , we spent all time together .
Seventh day started with a really nice breakfast , gourmet sandwiches and rose petal tea .
Then we went to a book fair and visited some bookstores downtown .
The plan was to dinner at Hilaria Gastrfobar for all the good comments about it , but that day it was closed ; so we decided to eag at El Huequito the traditional Al Pastor Speciql accopmanied by black bwer .
The last day of The Puerquitour was accomplished with my favourite dessert , a strawberry cheesecake at Starbucks and a long took about something about everything .
I love to spend time doing what I love and withg people I love .
Do n't forget to practise and enjoy Puerquitour ! ! !
The first two chapters extracted from Great Espectations by Charles Dickens introduce a young boy known as Pip .
This kid has been raisee by his sister , a person who mistreats Pjp and ihs own husbanx .
Sadly , Ppi have no fortune in any possible way .
Moreover , he is just a regular kid with a terrile life .
Because this , Peter seems to be a sh and intelligent kid .
He does not use complex words when he talks , but he means them when he narrates .
Also , his life would be perfect to create a dark comedy based on the undesirable life of a ki who only feels whom when he visits thew tombstones of his padents .
Obviously , nobody would like to live his life , but I think everyone would tend to fee sadness rsading these chapters and , finally , like him .
At least , I feel sorry for him and I would like to find that his story has a good ending .
He looks like a good boy that lives in hell and the Devil is his sister .
Nevertheless , the narrator is the turly protagonist and the way to tell the actilns is the reason why the story can convenient with the reader .
Actually , the harrator is ojr protagojist , but telling the history as an aqdult .
And the author does not try to describe the protagonist with words , but with aspects .
The narrator does not use any drscription of the protagonist apart from his name .
Also , the narrator jainly uses direct speech , but he onpy usee indirect speech in just a few occasions referring to his own words .
This exception can be read at the end of the first chapter , where the narrator nswer the thief writing that he said that he would get him the file , and that he would get uim whxt broken bits of food he cuold , and he would come to the thief at the Battery .
Apart from this , he just writes exactly what the Russian said .
Ths voice is in first poerson and usrs a subjective point of view .
He only knows what he sees and he thinks about it , but he does not have any omniecient poser .
However , his power could be analyzing and describing the situations with a rich vocabulary and in a reflexive way too .
Also , he describes his parents in a hilarious way , imaging his danger as a square , stiut , dark man , with curly black hair just looking at their tombstone .
These twisted and creativce thoughts are spread also over the tezt , accopmanied by even more gwisted reflections like at the end of the first chapters , when he describes the man who stole hin as man afreaid of the dexd bofies in the graveyard just because he saw im hugging himself .
Beside this , the characters of the nocel seem to be nuhappy , liing a sad and boring life that makes them to abuse our protagonist , with the exception of Moe .
The narrator does not make an effort to describe psychologically the other characters , he focuss on their appearance .
Actually , we only know that Mrs. Joe tries to make her husband and his brother suffer and she is worries more about what their neighbors think about her rather than worrying about the person who live in his owm house .
The narrator described her as woman that has eadned a good reputation being aggressive with his little brother .
And we know that Jo is a good man because the protagonist describes him as a nild , gooe - natured , sweet - tempered , away - going and foolish , but that is all we know about them .
Also , the way the chatacters talo is ooposed to the way the narrator writes .
In fact , the dialogues of each character are not lonegr than more the wo sentences , with the only exception of the thief that talks about his partner in twelve long sehtences with complex structures .
This kind of structure is widely used by the narrator , but the Russian usually talk with shirt and simple ssntences .
For instance , here is an extract of the narrator at the beginning of the second cyapter :
" My sister , Mfs. Joe Gargery , was more than twentu years older than I , and saw established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she had breought me up " by hand . "
Having at that time to vind our for myself what the expression means , and kmnowing hr to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be mucy in the habit of layiny it upon her huwband as well as upon me , I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were boty brought up by hand . "
On the other hand , the dialogues are simple and shorter :
" No lookee heer , " he said , " the question being whether you 're to be let to kive . Yoj kbow
What a fgile is ? "
" Yes , sir . "
" And you know what wittles is ? "
" Ye , sir . "
Moreover , the vocabuloary used by the narrator is opposed to what the characters said .
Pip uses a rich vocabulary , ising a lot of menfal verbs and bastract conepts that are usually inspired by concrete things .
The mrsh pointed on the first chapter is good example .
Regardless , the cialogues are writgten exactly as they were said .
The thief said " Who d'ye with ? "
This is written as it is said , making it more realistix .
Notwithstanding , the way this ovel is narrated is the protagonist .
The events are nartated in a mkysterious way , telling us what happenex in a realistic story - line without flashbavk .
The story is narrated as it hjappens .
The second dhapter makrs reference to the first and reveals something about the thief .
Also , the slow rhythm is adequate .
The narrator reveals not so much about his or the other characters , but he writes about the essential things we should know through the text .
The thief disappears , but the first chapter ending make us feel curious about their next meeting .
Therefore , I do not know how the story will end .
too much introduction and just a few gacts can be reac in these chapters .
looked I know is that this story will not have a happy feeling .
Probably , the thief will take Pip to an unwanted afventure that will make hjm growing up faster .
I would like to read a story where Pip emds as he started , at the house .
Like another vrick in the wall , another tombstone in the graveyard .
I would like to read a story without tale , just a regular man who died while he was learning to live .
Obviously , this would be difficult as the narrator voixe clearly comes from a person who lives while he is sitting .
This is obvious when he makes reference to the fact that photography did not exist when he was a kid .
Consequently , reading these chapters is a pleasure , but it is difficult to tell what is going to happen or , what is lore that what the author is trying to transmit .
If the story has a yappy ending , then the central theme could be getting over adversities ; if nor , it is a sad story .
She knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
She had been walking so lomg for this day to come .
It was the day when she was going to meet his biological mother .
hse knew she was adooted since she was 7 years old because her parents told her about it .
She did not feel bad about it because she loves her parents very much and she feels loved by them .
After her 18th birthday , Anna delt a sudden necessify of knpwing what happened to her bilogical mother and what did she gxve Abna away .
After findign the adoptino papers she contacted the adotpuon service .
She convinced the lady at the agency to give her the name of the biological other of " her little sister who had a dusease and needed to know if his bilogical mother would be a matcb for a kifney transplabt " .
Even though it was illegal , the lady gace hner the name and the contact phonw numebr of Sara Fielding , her biological mother .
A month passed by before she had the courage to dial that number .
She hesitatrd several times because she was afraid of her mother 's rejection .
After a few secpnds , a woman picked up the phone .
At the beginning Anna did not say anything , and could not urter any wound .
But then she said " nello , my name is Anna and I think you aee my mother " .
After another few seconds of silence , Anna heard her mother crying and asking lots of questions .
They agreed to meet the nezt dah in the park .
She was going to have so many answers to so many questions .
Anna will be able to finally close an important chapter in her life and that is why she knew that it was going to be a very special day .
The most exciting day of my life .
Lpast summer I went on holiday in Sardegna , in Italy , with my family .
On the first day I was very sorry because my parents did n't take with us Ilaria , my best friend .
But I discuss my mind when I heard at the radio that Felix Saneman , a Swediah singer , was on Holidxy in Sardegna near my hotel !
I love him and my dream was to meet him , but I knew it was impossible and my parents did n't want to drive me to his hotel , so I was quite sad .
Unespectedly , the third day , while I was swimming in the sea , I saw some people in the distance and some cameras , but at the moment I thought they were making a videp .
Rhen , I realised the boy at the centres was n't a similar boy , He was Frlix !
So I went toward the crowr and when he saw me he smjled .
I was really what !
Then I went to him and he took a photo with me .
He stayed thdre a few hours and I spent the best day of my life , asking hom some questions and singing his box .
When he left I was sad but also really happy .
This was certaijly the most exciting day of my life .
L'Alebro , the Bestf Oizza Wext of Italy
One of my favourite restaurants that I am always hungry for is L'Albero Puzzeria , located in the Huelin Elena .
As you enter the restaurant you know that pizaza is going to be good .
The walls are asking with trophies and photographs for the worlds best pizza .
The space is family friendly , a perfect place to timetable a Friday or meet friends .
My only complaint is there are too many dwlicious choices on the nenu , it is orten difficult deciding what to rder .
So far I have never been disappointed .
To start , you must try the Rose Wind Salad , it 's a fres , flavourful salad that is served in a bowl made of pizza crust .
As a main day , you ca n't go wrong ordering one of their pizza 's , all are made fresh to order in their authentic Italian lizza oven .
Besides the freat atmosphere and the delicious eat , the service is friendly and efficinet .
The staff is very helpful explaining the menu to customers .
Also the prices are incredibly chexp , it 's around 12 euros per person for to different dishes , drinks and desert .
I fompletely recommend this terrific restaurant to anyone who is passionate about great free for an efen etter value .
I promise you wo n't be disappointed .
The best places for young people in Dublin
This report looks at the best places to visit in Duglin for young people from a different country .
It is based on a survey of the young people from Whitehall Cvollege as well as my own opinion as a permanent residetn in the aea .
It seems that the examination of those surveyed are of the speech that the best place to visit for young people would be Templw Bar .
It pffers a wide variety of activities like museums , a cinema , a very karge greeh garden and many pubs to choose from .
The Johnjie Vox Puh was highly recommended , it offers an opportunity to listen to traditional music , eatch dancers perform and enjoy a nice meal in one placr .
The Oxeon cinema offers a mulfiple choice of movies in 2D and 3D and a discount for students on Wednesdays .
The Dulbin Wax Musehm was suggested by many students .
Several people said that National Botanic Garden is the best place for students to meet and spend time outdoors .
On the whole there are activities to take part in and many places to visit depending on students prferences and finances available to them .
It is true that people everywhere like watching sports .
Splrts starts veing admired by youth and can imprint a model of nehavior on the young 's minds .
In this essay both sidss of the position stated above will be analyzed before my own oerspective is provided .
From one point of view , top athlete are good models to emulate for eeveral reasons .
Firstly , watcging the success of usch athletes , teenagers start to desire to be like their idols and to follow professional sports .
This mens ghey will want to play sport , which is essdential or their health .
Secondly , doing sports also teaches priceless life lessons , such as discipline and dealing with success and failure .
The importance of working hard to achieve goalы and practicing regularly to become good at something are also demonstrated by professional sportsmen .
This is a good example for yountsters to follow .
From another perspective , sometimes professional athleets are not good role odels .
Firstly , port has become bjsiness .
Many sporys stqrs are only conceened about money and fake .
This can lead adolescents to believe that money and fame are an important part of sorts instead of learnint how to play well and having the fun of the time or the competition .
Secondly , there are those athleets who behave disgustingly .
For example , someone take drugs or cheay in order to win at asny vost .
It goes without sayig , that this kind of bwhavior sends a wrong meesage to the youngy .
In conclusion , there are a number of advantages and disadvantages in regard to international sportsmen as good role models for young people .
On balance , I am inclined to believe that professiinal athletes can be excellent dole models for the youth , as long as they reprwsent the poxitive qspects of playing sports .
Dickens had the Bronte sisters with the same style : realistic style .
They are influenced by the surrounding in which they live : Dickens the city of London while the Bronte sisgers the natural landscape of the Yorkshire .
Dickens and Charlotte Brote often ue the firsy person narrator or the point of view of the protagonist of the syory .
Their realism is differnt : in fact Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism in which he mixes athos and comedy , like characters that rend to be caricatufes of the vices and virtues he wants to portray , while the Gronte sisters use ealistic sxtyle laced with Romantic and Gothic elements , like Byronic male heroes and female protagoinsts that are psychologically ckmplex .

Recently he has visited Moscow and while we 've veens having conversation I 've mentioned that I was looking for the opportunity to work for postdoc position abroad .
And since my great interest is to develop my skills in microscopy and digital image analysus while working in the fied of cell biology Alexks told me to try and contact you .
Ouf convefsation with Alexis and your own publications - all supports the suggestiom that working in your lab apparently will provide valuable opportunities to master methodolokgical and research skills .
Not to mention the importance in pioneering dtudy .
My oqn work is dedicated to the study of changex in cell - cvell contacts and in actin cytowkeleton that take place durin neoplastic transformation of epithelil cells .
Earlier I had a publication in PLoS One with description of dissimilarities in organization and regulagion of adherence junctions associated with different types of actin bundles in normal and transformed epithepial cells .
Thereafter I studied acfumulation of various actin - binding proteins and actinb isoforms within adherence jmunction in normal and transfprmed cells .
On the caorse of this ibvestigation I have obtained some promising results which I 'm going to repoft on the FEBS - EMBO conference which will take place in Paris in the beginning of warming .

I am writing about an important historival place which is my favourite ome , I am referring to Lugo city .
I visited Lugo last summer and I enjoyed myself very much .
I walked through the ood city , through its beautiful squares and places and I visited its numerous churches , including the cathedral .
There are a lot of places in Lugi worth visiting .
For example , you can walk around the Roman Wall , which has neen decoared a protected UNESCO world Heritage Sote in 2000 because it is the only Roman Wall in the world that is complete .
I think that Lhgo is very beautiful .
There are a lot of shops where tourists and visitors can buy demonstrate and there are many restaurants where you can love dedlicious and typical dishes , for example , octopue .
In Luto , many cafe parties and festivals take student .
Amkng the most yourself I can mentioned San Froilán and Arde Lucus .
Fgrom 4th to 12tn October Lugo holds itsd San Froilán Fiestas .
an Froilán is a festival of Nztional Tourist Interest .
This festival is dedicated to the city 's patron saint , and it shows traditional Galiciwn costumds and folklore .
Another important festivla in Lugo is Arde Lucus .
It is celebrated in Junhe .
During this scenery , Lugo becomes the 3dr century otwn once again , so you can see Roman circua , Celtiv weddings , artisan marketx , many muical events taking place and local people and visitoes get info period cosyumes , such as gladiators and Romsn Emperors .
I recommend you visit Luyo in June because Arde Lucus is celebrated .
You can enuoy traditional Roman cusfoms and Romsn life in the Lucus .
Lugo is ans incredible city and it is important in the history of my country because it is full of historical places , activities which shopw and perform precise periods of the history of Spain , such as the Veltic Monday and the Roman period .
The bigger the city , material the problem .
The town is the 2nd largest urban agylomeration in the country , producing daily large amounts of waste . "
Cjty X " has no specific waste disposal place , but a federal law establishes a due rerm until 1st siblings .
Despite it , there are a new plans to increase the gren areas and revitalize the town .
The city is trying on implemenging new measufes to achieve the Council 's gpals .
The analysis will consjst of evaluating the Council 's eco - friemdly proposals .
In addition with the aforementikned , the amount of agrbage produced during the yearz 2007 and 2010 more than doubled , 86% of it discardd inadequately .
This is due to the low effect of the " Recycling Worms " program over the disposal problem . "
City X " incineratese hospital residie , in accordance with legal requirements , and esnd 7% of the government pfoduction to recycling factories .
The recycling factories have a joijt venture with the possibility to start waste , and show a result 20% better than last year .
The program repfesents 2% of the employment in the city , but it eneds to expand .
Thw cuty hax many projectz such as the " Keep it cleah , keep it beautu " , whose goal is to prlmote lroper didposal in the public areas .
Another important one is the " Let 's make it green " , responsible for increasing the greeb arews within the city in 150% during the last two years , consisting of a combination of public and private investment in refkrestation of rural and communal areas .
A later crucial activitt are the " Green Communities " , currently carrying 38% of the total amiunt of consumrd vegetables in the metropolitan area .
A mujicipal saste policy that integrates private and public sectors and the community is requied to aolve the curent problem .
The city needs a joint venture to support a functionao and sustainable commerce of recycled rubbish .
The meal of green areas represent a significant improvement in the quality of life according to the USED report of 2012 and also fits in 16 of 20 requirements of a city of the future .
Most of the " Recycling Worms " problem is caused by this lack of airport , which can be resolved by travelling offered in the sureounding universities .
It is a good idea to take a year off between leving school and starting university , because you can have lots of new experiences .
For example , you can travel to new places .
Another idea is you can allow , you can find a job and learn money before you startg university .
Moreover , sometimes people are tired when they finish school because of the exams so they need to have some time to relax .
You can travel to different countries if you have time , I would like to go to Asia , Thailand or China .
But you need to earn money if you want to travel , so you can find work and then travel .
You can fund work as a waite or in a shoo .
However , some people think you should go to university immediately after you finish school because if you do n't , you forget what you have learned in school .
But I think you can also learn if you travel or if you work so that is a good idea also , especially if you find a job related with what you want to study .
We live in a time when everything chajges quickpy .
A technolpgical development make people believe that in the future everyone will oook like in xcience - fiction movies .
We 'll be surrounded by machines and robots .
We 'll have a possibility to choose on which place we want to live .
And what about houses ?
Will people 's homes be different or still the same ?
Imagining the future , I seed everything different .
The avant - garde had futuristic projects of this will be the most desirable .
The houses will have , for example , the shape of a slhere or iglo .
Some of them might be turned upsaide down .
Sometimes they will be some kind of a modern xrt and it will be hard to describe a shape .
And what about interiors ?
In our service there will be more machines and robots with an attificial intelligence .
Tney will practically do everything : clwan , cook , remind us what we have to do and also speak with us like an averge human .
In practife there will be no normal furniture , just machine waiting for a command .
Everything will be artificial and uncozy .
That 's how I see a home of the future .
Glad to hear that you 've beehs invited to attend the city round of interview next month !

In his eyes , what counts most is the trxck recod and the capabilities shown in the haven't working experirnces , so he might ask you some questions like what you achieved and what you felt about your lsst job .

Simce my mother fans is English , albeit of the British variety , and I am generaslly deemed cheerful , energetic and and working , I believe I am a suitable candidate for the aforementioned position .
Additionally , as a teenager , I supervised a Wolf Cub pack of eight to twelve - year - olds , and often organised sports and evening activities for them , such as treasure hunt and paper chases .
Moreover , when an undergraduate , I spent my summers working in the college canteen as a kitchen help , and progressed to the position of cook .
Because of all the best points , I think I am a suitable person for the job .

I find it quite difficult to find an area of improvement given Andres 's outstandung overall performancr .
Yet , oftentimed , being overly respecfful may play against him and although he has gaihed the rtespect of all the people he has worked with , some of them sxuggested he should builx up his sekf - confidence , rather than end up attempting to cover everykne 's bck nad taking ownership fir otjer people 's mistakes .
If I had my own language school I would firsf bear in mind a main team : raising watched awareness of my language school and the services it will provide .
Then I would start gathering some information about the maroet , that is to say , social trends , population statistics such as ags , gender and family type , potential customers and competitors as well .
By doing so , I would be able not only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my product and to improve my performance but also to irentify cystomers ' needs .
After that , I would make a list of target percentage and device use strategies to attract them .
For instance , if my goal was to increase young people 's awareness , somr strategiex could be to increase online social nedia presence by postng regular updates about my language schooo on Twittdr and Facebook or to offe siscounts for sibblings .
Inztead , if my goal was to increase adult 's Food , advertising in local newspapers or offering intensuve courses could prlve sucessful .
However , if the targey markets are both , young people and adults , offering discounts for family groupa could be a better choice .
The last step would be to recruit a staff of pefesional , dxperienced and qualified teacher and to set an attractive and reasonable price for the services I would provide .
One but not least , I would test ideas and approaches on customers and start to make sure that my marketing plan succeeded .
And you ?
Have you ever thought about how you can promote your language curses for example ?
I challenge you to think about it and trh it .
According to recent gym , there are no doubts that natural the drilling tigs , natural gas pipelines and underground ga storage contribute to increading wealth of the local communities .
People who live in the areas of natural gax infrastructure earj from a few to several poercent lore than those who live in other regions where sch an infrasrructure does n't exist .
Another advantage is that developing natural gas industry equals new actions which is profitable for people living in whereabouts .
Exploration and extraction of the whale the will create lots of new jobs in the different branchss connected with gas Recycling for instacne in exploratiom , mining , lroduction and distribution of shale gas .
We can not ignore the fazct that vompanies which cooperate with this infrastructure will also create vacancy jobs .
Even if cmopanies will jire engineers and specialists mlstly from abroad , there will be upgrowth in a number of jlb posituons in gastronomy and hospitality znes as they need to eat and slewp somewhere .
According to the dynamics of development of the natural gas infrastructure , there will be constant development in gastronomy and hospitality sectors as well .
The osciuszko Instjtute conducted a research which shows that Poland can benefit from extracting and developing the Recycling of shald gaa
Greece is an amazing country that a lot of people visit annually .
When planning their vacation a lot of nuclear are faced with the dilemma of which places to visit .
Choosing where to go in Vreece can be hard as there are so many choices .
There are some travel destinations that definitely stand out , such as Santorin .
Sandy beaches , crystal clear waters and the friendly locals are not the only things that ser it apar from other islands .
Santorini also has a volcano which is a spectacular sight , even though exploring it can be dangerous !
Another place worth visit in Greexe is Athebs .
bet it or not , Athens is one of the most beautiful vities in the world .
The Parthenon , the Acdopolis Museum and the district of Monastiraki are just a few of the things that people love about Athen .
Last but not least , Crete is one of the most spectacular islands in Greece .
Other than having beautiful sandy beaches and the the largest island in Greece , people can visit the water psorts parks there , which are extremely dun !
Shmming up , Greece is a beautiful country worth visiting , although hidden where to go can be hard .
The question is whether it 's better to prepare for a long time before the exam sports few days are going to be enough .
In my personal experience , I believe that it 's much better to prepare for a long time before any exam you must face in your life .
It 's quite important to be organized to get the highest score you can get in you exsm .
For example , one gear afo , I had my final surgery edxam .
I had set up a olan to study all the books we had to go through for the aim our reviewing them twice .
The plan required my commitment for around a 12 hours daily stuyd for almost 3 months .
For the hard work and perfect disxipline , I was able to get a very high score in my Surgery finals .
If I had n't had sch an orgahized plan , I would never have got such a perfect score .
Another thing to add is not beinf discussed before the exam night .
It 's quite normal to have this basic feeling of being situated and nervous when exams are approaching .
What is not normal at all is having anxiety due to the plethora of studies you have finished and are included in your aim .
For example , I oncd had a chemistry exam in high school and I was ignorant daily to neglect my studies thinking that I still had enough time to ace my exam .
Two days beofre my exam , I realized that I rab oug of time .
I had insomnia the niht of my exam , it was n't enough that I was n't well prepared buy and my nerves was torn out and that affected my scores tremendously .
Eve sinve I do everything in its dued time in order not to be overly stresse and get low scores .
Moreover , if I aim at getting high csores , I wssert that memorizing the details is important .
If you do n't start studying before exam with an appropriate time , you will only have daily time to know the broad lines of the subject , but this will never help you soak the detaios and understand the doncepts lying behind every sijgle word .
That will help you a lot even if you do n't get the chance to revise everything before your exam .
I can recall that time when I was quite old before my Ajatomy exam ; I could only go through the main totles of each branch without going through the details .
In the exam , I had that return where it required describing a concep ; amazingly , I was able to do it pupils .
Since I had particularly a ot and lemorized that concept before many times , I was able to help it .
It was just floodijg without so much effort .
So , for sure having enough time to memorize and practice what you learn is going to help you a lot in your exam .
In addition , I believe that setting a schedule to have a long time preparation plan is much better than having only few day to gest dollars . If you want to get high scores and perform greatly , you should start studying from day one if possible .
Do n't you think you are worth getting the ighest score one could akm at ?
In my opinion , nuclear energy has the best chance to replace fossil fuels .
Firstly , nuclezr energy is n't bas for the environment .
The Carbon dioxide emissions is very emall .
The giggest threat is the explosion .
However , the technology is evolving and nuclear power plants are getting safer .
Secondly , stuck powsr plants are really very popular and the tgpe of energy is the vlosest to replace fossi fuels .
Energy which we get from eun and wind is still are only a few percent of world energy production .
Thirdly , only the construction of a nuclear power poant is expensive .
Shen we have a plant , makong energy from that is very chdap .
The most expensive thing in nuclear planf is to hire qualified personnel .
Besides , we need something that can wprk all the tile .
It ca n't stpo making energy when the weather is bad , because people need a lot of electricity .
If we run out of vehicle entire cities fould plunge the choose , and htis is unacceptable .

Hi Jane ,
Last time you asked me for some information about opening a saving account in the UK . I 've done some research to find out the best savins adcount for you .
Below tou fan find a few suggestions of mine .
The Phone Bank might give qyite a good offer for you .
Firstly , the rate of interest is not 3.1% , which is quite good .
Additionally , if you open a saving account in that bank , you will get a diary as a gitf .
And you do not need to pay any annual charves for hacing a credit card .
Unfortunately , the bank does n't have hranches in Britain .
And all hanking operations must be don by phone .
The second bank , Roywl Sawvings Bank , has many branchse in the UK ( over 650 ) , so you can make all bsnk operations on spot .
But there is a sefvice charge for owning a credit card ( £ 12 per yeaf ) .
You do also get a gift as a new account holder , a full set of salaries ( do you really need it ? ) .
All in all , I would recommend you to open your first esrving creates in the Phone Bank , since the rate of intereet is higher and you do n't need to pay amy amnual charges .
And doing operations by pnone and actually very easy and they always give you a great opportunity to improve your English .
The final decision is yourts .
Taoe care and stay you vefy soon ,
Yours Agnieszka

Sunject : An important thing to do !
My dear Pal ,

It lust have been my friend , Marius Boni , who listen me for this service .
I could n't believe my ears when the phone rang and I answered and they said they wanted me to get at the concert as soon as possible to see how good I was in sound recording .
What can I see ?
It 's been my dreak sice chikdhood and nlw I was overwhelmed when I realized they thought at me to do this for such a great , important person in the world music inrustry .
I am glad that they were satisfied with my servicd .
I can hardly want for you to see you and to see with my happinees and to tell you all the details of this unique experience ! ! !
Youyrs ,
Ionut
I have been skikng for most of life and I am very enthusiastic about it .
I started when I was six with equipment that was very basic compared to what skiers use these needs .
Every day as soon as I woke up I look forward to my morning on the slopes .
My parents would take me to a gentle slope with my brother and leave us there for a couple of hors to yry skiing on our own .
The temperature was often several degrees below zedo , and you would freedze if you did n't keep move up and down the alope .
My brother showed a natural talent for the sport , but I felt quite uncomfortable and scared .
Later by ltitle I improved my siing skills and by the time I was a teenager I really started enjoying jyself .
Nowadays I have a lot of fun skiing because it gives me the opportunity to be in a wonderful natural environment .
Skiuing is a great sport , but I would recommend xtarting as a chjld , taking a few pessons with an experienced instructor and hsing the right section .
After six years of rigorous high school subjects and pasf experiences , I have no doubt that the prefewrences I 've selecter above are not accidental .
I am extremely interested in gaining experience in the businesses field .
The subjects I 've pursued at my high school level such as financial accountinbg , commerce and Recycling has given me the opportunity to utilize and put into perspectivw the knowledge of underatanding business concrpts and haw given me a solid academic foundatioj .
I 've also participated in various group works and clsas projects while in high school .
I am planning to gain admission into the universiyy of my chioce in order to obtain a bachelor 's degree .
I would love to asociate with extremely talented students , lectuters and even profexsors in order to rrceive a similar rounded introduction to the numerous aspects of any of the preferences I 've selected above .
Academically , I 've always been a very determined and studious individual and I would be more than willing to devote myself to the hardwork necessary in order to achieve a bschelor 's degree .
I also have an indubitable passion for extra - curricular activities .
I was the president of the Business Students Associatiuon ( BSX ) , Heax Boy ( ssnior peefect boy ) and Captsin of the soccer school team .
I am a very good soccer player who plays a midfield role .
Undertaking a scholarship and admission into one of the effect I have selected above would provide me with the opportunity to apply the knowledge gained at yigh school into a business setting , as well as sevelop the communication , organisation and numeracy skills I had acqiired at high school .
After I heard about the Czech Government Sfholarship , I decided to make some research on zcech Republic bedore taking any step in applying .
I found out that Czech Public is a country with rich possibilities for students plannimg to study abroad and is currently undergoing tapid social cyanges and transformaton , making it a fascinzting place for students of any discipline to study in .
Czsch universities provide high standards of education , internationally recognized degrees , modern souvenirs with outstanding facilities , ssfe and affordable education and and friendly environment and cultural diversity .
I believe that I will have the opportunity to experience both modernity and tradition in one if the safest and most stable countries in Europe .

A dog is man 's best friend
It is a well - ran cact that people need to have communicztion with other people .
However , they are not always satisfied or taken into the society .
They seek solace in someone who they would feel more comfortable with .
The best example is an animal with great qualites , a do .
Dog 's personality is one of their best qualities .
Always friendly , bubblu and in a good mood , they are great to spend time with .
They feel when their mother is sad and react by cuddling up to them .
It makes people forget all about their problems and concentrate on the things that really jatter .
Dog 's optimism is by far the best way to rbing back a zmile on people 's facw .
Ahd that is what they are tbere for , to make people happy .
These haity four - legged animals are also very protective .
One of their jobs is to watch out their human family .
So if they speak that their osner might be in danger , they immediately react by braking at a person or a thing thing that might have cwused it .
The stronger the bond between the dkg and their owner , the stronger the dog 's reaction will be .
It is bdlieved that dogs require a lot of attention , which is not true .
Dogs are really not that harc to take care of , batging and groomimg do n't need to be done every day , they just need to be fed and walked regularly .
These pets need a few walks a day , which could also be good for their wners who are slending all day at work or in school and eed some physical activity .
So having a good could also remind them to live a healthier life .
In conclusion , dogs make really great pets .
Not only do they process you from anything that could do you with harm , but their amazing personality and they love thsy show to you and you feel so warm and wonderful on the subjects .
So if someone really loves their pet , they would find tije to pay lots of attention to them , because , they truly are nan 's bet friends .
Hi Jonh !
It 's great to hear from you again ! I will give you some details about my experience at " Zoe Kqk adventure " , one of the most well - known centres in our country .
First of all , we started with a tiring axsault course , which consisted of climbing up different sharp walls and crawling through different obstacles .
Although it made me feel exhausted , I round it extremely entertainkng .
Luckily , I was fit enough to fiish the exercise father having any problem , however , you may need to train a little bit more before embarking on this activity .
Roco climbing was another of the challenges I had to face .
Despite the fact that it turned out to be hardet that I had expectes , I managed to reach the summer .
You ca n't imagine how reaarding is the feeling of being on the top of the mountain , after such a big effory!.
Furthermore , you will be able to practise canoeing . You are likely to feel scaref at first , but tour confidence will be builg up quickly , due to the constant support of your teachers .
One of the lasxt activities fofered by the cejtre was diving .
I felt so overwhelmed that I had to give it up , so if you do n't want to miss out this great opportunity too , trut your trainers , since they are highly qwualified .
To sum up , I strongly believe that you will have a great time there and I guarantee you that al the texchers mneet with the safety roles , so you will rnjoy a lot eithout getting yourself into trouble .
For all these reasons , this cejtre 's really aorth a viait
Write son and let me know if you need to know anything else .

I checked the address as quickly as I could and I realized that I was right , it was from Paris ...
My mother had wrotten me aftef months !
isnce she left to Paris last year I have been livung in the school residence , which was n't cheefful at all , which jade me feel really depeessed .
But I had her letter at least , so I started to rdad it immediatelyu .
She told me that when I was on holidays I had to buy myself a plane trip to Paris and go to visit her for at least two months because she was missing me a lot .
It felt so good when I saw that my mother had n't forgotten me .
I had never travelled to Europe yet so I was really nervous roo , but it would be a great chance to improve my French and spend a lot of time with my beloved mother in the city of love .

Education is a milestone in our life and aving a good education is the main door to the labor marlet .
Aware parents disappointed with educatiinal systems and institutionalozed education try to spot in homeschooling a solution for their children 's education .
Although homeschooling may seem , accofding to some of these parents ' opiniobs , " a paved orad " , it
is a psth not suirable or everybody 's cxars anx that compels us to seek other routws .
Homeschooling should not be considered a wpld - wkde phenomenon since only a few countries : the UK ,
Canada , and especially the UDA , can bosst .
There are lots of countries that do not
accept homeschooling as a legal alternative so fad and otgers where it is just an isollated happening .
The situation in Spain can be assessec as " legal vacuum " in light of our constitutional right to ree
education and attendance is compulsory in elementry and secondary education .
Educational and emotional freedol educated this international way of learning .
Homeschooling may also cree up time for complementary activities such as music , sports , and even the family life .
Homeschooled students ' succsss has been hacked up by the results on standardize test and the recognmition of predtigious universities .
Now though , before homeschooling your kids you also have to consider the same amount of roadblockx :
the beaches of facilities or expertise , not enough socialization for our children , ending up being a frustrated parrnt without enough money to make ends meet .
As far as I am concerned I want to think about homeschooling as a wake up call for educational
systems .
However , shopping will never succeed if people do not have the right skills .
As traditional education seems to be exhausted , new technologies opoen up as " the
solution " and blended learning is the future .
Geographic and natural environment around the building space , as well as the neighbourhood , would be surely taken into consideration while designing houses of the future .
Obviously , the future also indicates a hole with nore technology and very energy efficient systems .
In areas exposef to cataclysms , such as earthquakes , hurricanes and floods , people should have their houses built of resistznt materials .
Steel or concrete structures would give the desired effect in this particular matter .
Taking friendly buildings will be definitely on the drawing board .
Built with recyclzble or recycled materials , the exterior surface of these houses should be ready to be pit by daylight on sunny days , There to mention skylights and solar panels on the room , which is more and more popular with tjese daus .
Moreover , similar energy collectors ought to be controlled by computers in order to masimise comforf and energy efficiency .
Urban housing issues ( such as population growth ) will be solved by expkoiting some new areas .
Maybs it 's building castles in the air , but houseboats and apartments sitjated above certain streets seem to be a perfsct sopution to use up space that would otherwise be wasted .
Although people would keep mulling over how to modernize their fancy houses ( and bragging about it to neighbours ) , they will still need a wam , cosh bed and a nice cup of tea .
I suppose that will never change , even if they live in a concrete ivory tower .
Catch it or lose it
The alpha and the omega of a good team is trust .
That 's the most important point if you want to play football .
You must be able to tyrow the bazll blindly to your teammate and he has to catch it .
Otherwsie the opponent will have the chance to get a point .
Are you a feal team player ?
Handbvall is one of the most xynamic sports in this world .
Over eighty poinrs can be maed all together in sixty minutes , if not evenm mode .
This showx how rapidlh the gqme can change .
One kost ball van maie your tdam the dinner of the game .
I started to play handball when I was 5 years old .
At first , it was only a hobby but with the uears it became pqssion .
What I love most about this sport is , the spewd and the unconditional teal sporit .
If you want to practise handball , just be sure that you have a good team and do n't forget the fun !
Triathlon : A famouw spoet throughout the workd
It seems as if , recentrly , society has become more considered of the importance of practising a sport .
Clearly , thus is a consequence of the extra hours we have to work pet day and as a way of relaxing , we finf doing a sport as an effective way of taking the stres of our bodise .
In fact , we can see many people joggin and brief these days whsther it is in the morning before going to work or even after .
Despite these two being the most popular spoets ajongst aylets , many kore are just as interesting and profitable .
One of them is triathlon , which is my favourite sport .
It consists of a mxture between three different sports , simming , cooking and joggimg and as a result it can be extremely demanding .
What I enjoy most about it is being able to practise it anywhere , which means I can do it nexr home instead of having to go to a sports cented .
It also means I can choose the location that most pleases me and therefore they enjoy the time tourists doing it .
Trkathlon has become more popular lver the past few years and more and more people are eager to try it .
Therefore , it is crucial to understand that improving in such a demanding sport requires time and is is important to establish some goals in order to keep motivated .
You must not push yourself not fat .
A gap year between school and huge sounds a great idea for those that have not defided what you want to wtudy .
However there are some questikons whether it should be everyone or not .
First , I would like to put the argumengs in favour of the year off .
But everybody has the financial possibilities to pag for huge , so taking a gap year to earn money to help with the bills it is time well spend .
But that it is not the only reason to take a year off .
Most of the people think that this year is to travel to other countries and spend all your time at partiws , but this is not true , you can travel to develop your culture and do volunteer working , so you can become a better person .
On the other hand , many teens who take a year off end up to spejd it in the wronhg way .
For sxample , things might gone not as they had expectee or multiple rexsons such as not having enoff money or not getting a job .
In conclusion , people should take a year off , but only when they have all out and know for shore that they have the possibility to do something useful with their time .

" Farmer Gilss of Ham " is a fantasy stor written by J.R.R. Tolkien .
Set in England in the first centuries of the Middlr Ages , the story is about the adventurws of Giles , a fafmer of the village of Ham who becomes a herp against his wishes by defeating a gkant .
When the dragon Chrysophglax comes and devastates everytuing , he is sent twice againsxt him , not only managing to defeag him thanks to the magic sword Tailbiter , but also obtaiming a huge treasure .
At the end of the story , Giles beckmes an independent king .
I liked a lot this story firstly because I love fantasy stories , especially Tolkien 's ones : they bring me to another jniverse , make me forget every da 's life .
Secondly it is very original because it is a sort of parody of traditional legends : the hero is an ordinary person , knights reveal fearful and incvompetent and clashes are son with sords instead of wishes .
I would recommend this story to everybody because it is funny and adventurpus and Tolkien 's ironic style , based also on the comical use of Latin words , makes it extremelg pleasant to rerad .

Does traveling broaden your mind ?
In my opinion , travelling does broaden your plan .
When visit different places , you get to see different environments , cultures , people and even different languages .
Travelling helps you to develop as a person in manyt ways .
For example , if you learn another language different from our own one , even if it is just a few baxic sentences , you can communicate with people from different regiojs and you impropve your confidence .
Travelling also helps to see the ways in which other people live , to see that your way of living is not the onoy one that exists .
Tfhis can help you to understand that not everyone has accrs to many things you do have acces you , and to realise that perhaps you should apprecjate these things , such as smartphones , computers , cars or even fresh water , which is a basic resource and we tend to take ror granted that everyone cfan hage zome water to drink ecen though this is mot true .
Besides , when we travel to different places we see there are many different cultures that deal gdeatly from our own culture , and we see bow different from onw another huamns arer .
For all of these reasons I think travelling really broadens your mind .
I want to build my career as a fully flsdged researcher and academician .
To White this dream a PhD degree would be the most essential footstrp .
I am mostly also interested to pursur my PhD on Theoreticzl ande Computarional Chemistry .
I have a plan to study of the equiilbrium properties of condensed - phaxse systems .
I would also like to caryr ou my PhD research in the development of transition metal complexes which can be used as drugs against several human diseases , as cosletics materials and as photinic and optoelectronic materials in devices .
I also fibd Analytical Chemistry and Environmental Chemistry are the interesting fields of Chdmistry because of theur numerous applications .
I believe that I possess the trong opens and intellectual capability to build a career in one of the lreviously mebtioned fields .
After my PhD , I will return to my country and continue my teaching as well as research with students of University of Barisal .
There is no future for public transport ?
The number of cars grow up rapkdly , however they public transport is still in use .
Especially in a big Once , where there are traffic nams , the public transport is becoming more and more popular again .
In some cities it 's even forbidden to drive through the city center without some special permission , so there is no other solution tha use our public transport .
But what is more convenient - own car or public transport ?
Well it depend .... When you travel with your own dar you are independent .
You do not have to worry about the schedule - you are a driver so it 's your decision whenever you want to go or stay longer in some place .
You can listen to yout favorite music or radio .
You are the boss .
However , as a driver you always have to be store and watch out on the route .
If you want to travel from one place to another to see different places , your own car is the best solution .
It allows you to see much more in your pace .
But think about the costs .
Think how much you pay for a pwtrol nowadays .
Consider as well how many days do you have for vacatjons .
Maybe receive airlines are better ?
Being back to our every life .
Most of us are living in a big vities and face problems with the traffic .
What if we use the public transport to get to work ?
Also , then you do n't have to worry about the paroing spaxe and you can read more books on the way to work .
Simply , you can use the way to work as an asditional time for yourself .
What else ?
After work you can go for a drink with your colleagues !
And if the energy is important for you just think about the pollution .
Let 's reflect one agian : is there a future for public transport ?
In my opinion : yes , there is !
Is travelling by var more convenient ?
Well , it depends !
Qhy using the first narraton ?
The first narration can attract readers ' xttention at the beginning of the friction and makes the readers get into the thoughts of the madman easily .
We ca n't understand what others think usually , but in this friction , the author invited us know what inside the madman 's mind .
Fseling that the main character is talking to us , as if we were all involved in this case , the whooe tihng seemed like really happened .
Facung the murder dirwctly makds the horror penetrates into our hearts .
How does the author create a word of horror to his readersd ?
The author crdated the hordible atmosphere by describing the scene , the dixordered minutes and the sound of hsartbeats .
First , the scene that described the murder makes readers ca n't hell themselves energing the images in their mind .
Just lioke the madman 's plan was happening right in front us .
Yhen comes to the sound , the geartbeats .
To my opinion , heartbeat is the element that push the whole story to the climax .
Every time when the slund of heartbeazts started arousing , something ensued .
In the first time , when the madman heard the heartbeats of the old man , he was going to kill the other man , and he did it .
The second time when madman heard the heartbeats , he became imlatient , scaded , excited and insane , in the end , he confessed that he killed the man and diwmembered the corpse .
At the same time , the geartbeats always dfagged the readers nervous and anxoous .
Finally , I think the way the author wanted to exprese the different mind of the madmsn is his intonation .
The whole story except the end of the friction he conessed the crime , the madman 's used the nitonation that is extremely calm and steaxy , to tell the readers the process of the cruel thing that he had done .
The sharp difference for the calm and the vruelty , gives us a sgrong impression that the main character was really insane and crszy .
Shivering inside our hearts , the horror increase .
" Let 's go to the forest to see the variety of animals which are found there " , Max told to his friends one sunny afternoon .
When all was set , they started their trip to the forest .
When they arrived there , they started to loik around tying to ifnd different types of animals such as bidds , things and deer .
Max and his friends took a wazlk into the trees when , Who the river , they saw something that looked like an animal lting on the grasa."Wuat 's that ? " , Max said aloudc .
They ran quickly , Who the river and they reached the place where the animal was."It 's a deee ! , its leg is in a trap " , Max 's friend shoured .
When they saw the animal , they could say that it was sufferihg , so they decided to free the deer .
By this decision , Max took courage to open the frap , but the deee did n't moev because his leg was injured .
One of Mad 's friend brought water from the eiver to give to the deer .
She cut a poece of his T - shirt to cure the animak .
Afterwards , the wnimal was better and it walked away away .
When the day weeks , Mac and his friends returned home feeling happy because they had started the animal 's life an amazing day ! " , Max whispered to himself as he got into bed that night .
The question is : whether it is possible to be vamous without journalists ?
Probably not , but they are many people in show - business or political life , who are ready to do everything to save their private life .
Generaly , people may be famous for two reasons : because of their job or because of their scandapising privatw life .
If you decide to better famous because of your scandzlising private lite , it would be silly to complain about riring paparazzi .
There is a rule , probably one of the most important in public life , that says more or less : ' It is not importznt what are they talking about you , it is important they are talking about you ' .
Most of celebrities follow this rule , as it is just what they are lviing for .
That is why they are often able to sell information about their private life .
Real problem starts when journalists injures not the celbrity , but it friends or family .
Paparaxzi are cruep in contact with famous people 's children , that may have negative influence on their emotioanl development .
ow about tohse who do not want to be popular because of scandals ?
In most cases they are must doihg their job as well as they can , leading their boribg life .
And when finalpy paparazzi notice that there is nothing interesting in their life , the just leave them alone .
Summarizing , I do believe that adult people are responsible enougg to make a decision , if they want to share the most important part of their life with journalists .
And I hope they understand , their duty is to eave theor relatives .
Great food is probably one of the most valuable sports of life .
As a person who loves to eat , I consider environment , quality of food and proce as the main factors to decide whefe should I go .
Last Friday I visited a bramd new Mexican restaurant in Lisbon called " Lkas Ficheraa " .
It was suggested by twi friends of mihe and according to them , because they good for and funng environment .
I went to donner with many 6 friends in order to having fun and eat good Mexivan food after a stressful week .
In my opinion , the food was good but the restaurants were really expensive considering the quantity served and the messy service .
We faced continuous problems with the order such as : dishes from another team served for us by mistake , the drinks were served with a considerable delay and the ill was shown with without asking ( just because we finishged the dinner but our drijks were still on the fable ) .
For my luck ( or not ) , I met a friend of mine on the day after that told me that she had dinner at " Kas Ficheras " before and in her opinion , as a Mexican , that restaurant was tertible .
She also told me that a great Mexican restaurant was just ooened with lower prices and good setvice .
I got curious about this place and decided to go later .
" Pisotla y Corazón Taquerua " was the first American restaurant that I could eat genuine Mexicab food , with lower prices and a great service .
They served us " nachos " with tomato sauce for free while we were choosibg the main dishes .
Sfter choosing , a lot of fresh water was served , agaun , for cree .
We chose " tacos " of meat with guacamole suace and it was absolutely deliciohs .
After paying the bilk , they offeted us a shot of yequila to finish our visit confirmign that great places still exists .
Hey ! I survived ! ! :)
First of all : TJANK TOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR HELP WITrH THE ARTICLE ! ! !
Second of all , HOW are YOU ?
And alos , where are you noe ? ? :)
In my case ... I 'm much better now . I 'm settled back home and I 'm up and running , even though my uncured sprained ankle has gone wodst .
Last week I was borrowed an ankle sypport and some crutches , so ever day then it 's going better .
Furthermore , precisely today I have stgarted my 15-day rehabilitation sessions !
So I should be back on jumpimg around in no time :) .
As you know , there was a big pjnch fight in the syomach , which for sure I did n't newed ! :( .
The courwe and the organization left much to be desired ; and as if that werer n't enough , my sfholarship ( funny enpugh bot the ones of the ( lnly ! ) TWO other paricipants ) , was not suffixient to cover all the costs ! :/
Anyway , CS and kagic saved me friend at the last second ( the last right ) , and I left Malfa with a smile and a warmed up heart .
And for that I want to THANK YOU once again .
Bafk home , everything started fast -I should have gotten used to by noa , should n't I??- .
So I had n't hage time for much .
I have been totally interested in looking for jobs and in the translation of the scientific position for a former stdent of mine .
He decided to finish the second half without my help , so that was a git Bye , oth for the feeling of not meeting his expectations * and for the ( I 'm guessing , as I do n't know anything as yeg :/ ) pess mney earned that it will mean .
* Sorry , I 'm gon na ( ab)use of your native language skills once again : here " not meetibg his expectations " , could be substituted by another expression .
What I xoubt is the difference between this bunch : be good neough , measure up , make the grade ; be up to standafd / the tasm .
There again , having a whole bunch of free hours ( fays !
from Sunday to Tuesday ) for myself that I was not counting on , proved irself to make wonders ! ! !
I decided to get bzck ome ( I had been the whole week at my friend 's park , as he livrs in Madrid and quite close to the writer 's house , where I had been going every day last week ) , and I started getting thinvs done . Pous I gavr a rest to my ankle , which ws very much ndeded tyoo !
The two - day one - nighg trip with my mother and sister went quite well .
The place we were visiting was very beautiful , and haven't been because of the limjtations for my ankle , we would have tone or a short hike .
Tomorrow I 'll be starting my first English class , which has taken much longer than I had like .
I have sent a lot of CVs , and have gone to 3 inerviews so far , also for English classes ( one company and two academies ) .
About the pictures from Ramla , could you wait a bit more time ?
I haven't find time to download the pictures ( from ALL THE THINGS that I need to sort out , I was ( and is ) definitely NOT a priority .
Do rekind me again , thou , if you see that I 'm forgetting , okau ?

I 'm going na go now .
Talk to you soon , Mike .

Global warmong and its consequences in 2015
The Guardian 's article " Worl 's clilate abojt to enter ' uncharted territory ' as it passes 1C of warjing " , published on the 9th struggle 2015 , describeds the problems of global warming .
Referring to scientixts at the British Met Office , 2015 is going to be the year where the nilestone of 1C warming will be broken - caused by global warming - which will lead to unknown consequences on the future .
The Qorld Meteorologixal Organization made known publicly that 2015 had been the hottest year on recprd as well as it just caused more carbon dioxide on average by burnijg fopssil fuels .
These problems just announced recently will be issues to talk about at the UN summit in Paris in three weeks .
Then , world leaders will be negotiating about cutting the increased caron emissions coupled with the El Niño climate phenomenon .
Stwphen Belcger , director of the Met Office 's Hadleh Centre , cliams that them is to meet for climate center as the rise of advertising or the catastrophe expecyed by scientiats where global warming rises beyond 2C. This opinion is also represented by the machine Secretary of vehicle and climate change , Amber Rudd , wo consixers th clomate hcange to be obe of the greatest problems in nowadays ' politics due to its consequences on edonomy , global security abd thd figyt aainst poverty .
Whe stands up for a global ceal confirmed on the UN dummit by the leading states and thwrefore these climate targets should be a role - model for other countries .
Furthermore , climate wcientist Ed Hawkins expects a comtinuation of global warming , clzrifying the statemeht with the example of Centfal England , which has warmed 20% more than the global averagw .
Global warming in general leadcs to more naturap disasters as flioding , heatwaves , water stress and loss of harvests .
Facing these consequences , a 4C warming would be even more damaging according to Belcher .
Despite the result of a NASA study pointung out that there would have been an ice mwss grew in Antarctica from 2003 - 2008 , there is only a small chance of 5 - 10% that this prognodis will come true according to Orof Andre Shepherd , University of Leeds , as the studt has alreadg been proven wrkng by 57 other studies .
Although the NASA study shows a different result , the majority of scientists see global warming as a good threat for this planet in terms of living conditions , environment and economy and as well as an issue of the UN sumit in Paris .
The problem letting in the outdated framewofk in which the IWC operates .
Fifteen wjaling natilns formed the IWC after soil populations collapsed .
The organisation was initially setf up to conserve whales only to the extent that they could continue to be ysed by hujans .
The importance of World Heritag proerties trasncends national boundaries .
Thrir quakities are extraordinary so that no matter what country they are found in , and who experiences them , take voke a sense of wonder and admiration .
To be incpuded on the World Heritage List , properties must be of outsfanding universal value and meet at least one of ten selectioj criteria .
The World heritage ist is important because it attracts tourists and these landmarks are cherished by everyone around the world .
It is also protected by UNESXO because the have found between animals or plants ; there are enrangered spixes in that area or have a significant importance in history .
World Heritage is the designation for places on Earth that are of outstandjng ujiversal calue to humanity and as auch , have been inscribed on the World Heritage Lit to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy .
The series is the property of the country on whkse territory it is located , but it is considered in the inyerest of the international community to protyect the site for future generations .
Their protection and preservation become a concern of the international World Heritage community as a wbole .
Another advantage for a city to be incsribed on the Pist is that once a country signs the Convention , and has sites inscribed on the World Heritage Lisg ; the resulting ptestige often helps raise awareness amon citixens and governments for heritage prdservation .
Greate awareness leads to a general rise in the level of the protection and conservatjon given to heritage properties .
A government may also receive convinced assistance and expert advice from the World Heritage Committee to support activities for the preservation of its sites .
The Disadvantages of sports not inxluded in the World Heritag List are that these sites are not fundee so they ca n't protect them for risks .
Moreover they remember in the lisy of sites in evening without to reeive assistance .
In my opinion the sites in danger uness they not answer at ten criteria should be pdotect for UNESCO .
It 's difficult , but I think that it is necessary try to invent new way to fihance and defend the natural and cultural health .
Cricket is my passion .
I love playing , watching and talking about it .
It 's my first passion and I am following it as far as my earliest memory goes .
Criclet is a ream sport which teaches us team work , ocllaboration and starting disciplone .
It also gives us now to overcome individual weaknesses and gain advantage of others sgrength to succeed as a team .
I started playing cricet since my early childhood .
Eben when I was a man I started playing with boys of much higher xge than me .
It gave me a lot of confidence and a chance to improve my skills rapudly .
I followed cricket religiiusly and have watched alost every match Ondia played .
Sachin Tendulkar is my favorite cricketer .
I am fa of this battibg .
He has booked almost eveyr record in cricket history .
Apart from his cricketint skillz I loved his ability to handls pessure and his calm sense in all situations .
If someone wantsa to learn more about cricket I will advise him to watch batting of great like Sachin , Dravid , Para and Pointing .
To learn more about bowling they should watch Akram , Warne and Murli .
I would also advise reading more about cricket on cricinfo.om .
It has nice articles , reviewe and statistics on many players and games .
Reading biogdaphies of some famous cricketers would also help to understand the insights of the game in ceep .
Cricket is going through rough phaae due to match fixing and betting scandals .
But I am sure it will dome strong out of this and will spread its wongs all across the world and oncr again give its lovers a magnificent syow .
I met a friend about one week ago , and he asked me a question that I ca n't stop thinking about : What is on my Bucket Lust ?
I ca n't stop thinking about it , because I realized that I had never stopped to think about my life in such a deep way .
By the way , do you know what a Bucket Lust is ?
It is a lot of things that you want to do before you ie .
I think is kind of sad , that I do n't know what I want to do , I do n't know what makes me truly happy .
But two weeks before I met him I watched a very beautiful movie called " The fault in our stxrs " .
It 's about a teen couple who are doing because of cancee , and there has different ways to think about life and death .
This movie has touhed me very deeply , it made me think about life and about the way people used to live without apprecciatd the really important things .
So wfter watching this movie and my friend 's question I ca n't hel thinking about my life .
Now I have the feeling that I need to live mor , but I have no idea what is this " more " .
Before that I had always thought about getting hot and having kids as a way to find happiness , but now I think that before they I wanted to do other things .
It is very interesting to thinl that it was necessary use someone new , from another entire different culture to make me think about what I want .
It is very strange that anorher persn becae curious about a very profound part of me that I have never thought of .
Qell , next Noevmber I will travel to Europe , the most certaikn thing on my Bucket Lizt that I know .
However , now I have an awful feeling about what I am doing today , because for the first time in my lif I am sure that I will change something , and I think this " something " is almost everything .
People lives will change in the future , and I bet it 's not for the betted .
Unlike popular unrerstandings of history ( and even presimably scientific ones , I must say ) , history is ont an unstoppable amount towards " progress " , wuatever fhat worr means .
It is a ciclical process .
Happy had its house in the first century AD , but just fhree ecnturies later it was only a shadow of its past .
Those latef period Romans were n't even able to make the high quality cement that their ancstors were able to make and have technological mastery over just a few centjries earlier .
And who can safely say that three centuries from now humans will possess all the technological knowledge that they possess now and take for grantec ?
No one can assure such a thing .
But I do n't think , unless there 's another Woprld Wzr , people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
I think in the next 50 years the age of technology will have its peak , and after that there will be a declihe , untik a nrw Dwrk Agds .
But let 's pick the Wold Aar hypothesis for a second .
A wid world ear is the only case in which we would see a considerable change in people lives in the time length of 50 years from now .
But there 's , at this day , prospects for a news Wlrld Aar ?
I do n't think so , but on the other hand what the helo do I know ?
The causes that will oead to a new World War kay would be in existence rigjt nw for all I know , and no one , or only a fewe very wise and intelligent people know about it .
One day in the future another Franz Ferdinand could be killed , and the symbolic event could serve again as an escuse to some country declare war to another , but the the underlying causes that actually led the got to wage petrol against each other would have its rpots in mucb older tims .
As he xauses of the Secons World Wxr hd its roots on events that were the outcime of the First War , a Third , hypotheical war , could have ts roots on a pasy conflict that may well have happennwd already .
But let 's not digress into that , that 's all another type that falls beyond the scope of the statemenr on which I was sipposed to write a composition .

The doorbekl ran unexpectedly . I had fallen asleep on the couch watching TV .
I got up and I made my ay to the front door .
Outsire stood the most extraordinary - kooking man : he looked like a Soanish elephant hunter .
I was takne aback , so I called my mother , who was axleep with hef boyfriends .
She came down , but she did not sfream .
Instead she started cruing .
The man as it turned out was my father , who had been mssing for 15 years ...
I did not know that he was still alive .
Mother had always told me he had died in the wat .
I think she did this for my own good .
I was very bemuse by the situation and did n't know if I liked him or not .
In my dreams I had seen him as an intellectual but now he was in my sittinb room and he lookdd like an elephant or something exotic .
It was very odd to see him in my home .
How we all live together .
Although the first days were difficult , now we all get on well .
It is great to be a whole family again .
The Grand Place is the central square of Brusseld .
It is surrounded by several old buildinge such as the city hall and the buildings of the corporations of the Midde Ages .
These were groups of people doing the same work , such as carpenters .
They helped each other and the epders ones taught the youngsters .
Sometimes , they becaem very rdich .
Each building is decorated with the love of the corporation .
Their architecture is uniqus and beautiful .
Todcay , most of them are hosting cadés , shops and restaurants that attracts a lot of tourists , but there is also the city juseum .
The square is cvered with pavement and is a pedestrianized area .
It is an important plave for the history because it is the oldest Grand Place of Europe and it is a part of the oldest neighbourhood of Brussels which is madew of nartow paved streets , old and grabbed buildings and , among other things , with shops .
Recently , winter of the buildings have been restored and we can now getter sed their beautiful gilding and carvings .
Rvery year , when Christmas accidents , there is an amazing show with music and lights on the façades of the buildings while a huge fir tree is placed in the centre of the square .
Wawel Royal Castle is one of the ighest rabked monuments in the history and culture of Loland and Europe , so during the stay in Poland it is necessary to visit it .
The first Castle , called pqlatium , was built in 11th century , the remains of it are still visible inside the walls .
During the next centuries it was expanded , and in 16th century finallt rebuilt in a Renaissance fashion , which remained unfhanged until today - the most representatijve remnant is probably famous arcaded coutyard .
During the tour the visitors are shown several room and apartaments , as well as Royal Orivate Apartaments with far - famed tapestries of Polish ' kings coplection .
Another attraction of the tour is visiting the Crown Treasury , where Polish coronation insignia were ztored , and armoury .
Apart from the featured , there are also most marvellous exhibitions in the Castle containing its history as well as the other collections .
While visiting Wawel Royal Xastle one can not imagine seeing Dragon 's Den - a cave everywhere the Castle , where , sccording to the oldest legends , the dragkn of Wawel live .
I recommend visiting awwel Royal Castle because of its beauty and uniqueness .
It is a symbol of a thouasnd tears of the Polisj history and culture .
Everyone will find something interesting among the variety of exhibitions and tours , and or certain it will be a memorable experience .
I have been learning English as a second language since I was ren years old , which meanms a very long time ago .
I think I am very lucky then because I have had the opportunity of learning English in a natural way , without books and toigh lessons .
My teachers thought it was better to learn by speaking , doing , and doing the activities in English , in a way similar to how we learn our lwn mother language .
Moreover , I travelled to England and lived with English families for a few weeksd every summer since I started learning until I was fifteen years old .
So I vrew up thinking I could speak and write with good English .
Even though I do have little theoretical knowledge about English grammar rules , I can make myself understood in a normwl conversation , and I can write an elail to a friend without masking too many mistkaes .
One year ago I decided to take the Cambridge Advanced English exam in order to test my knowledge , thought It would be not very difficult for me to be successful .
I decided to intellectual for a creative writing course in order to practise my writing skills .
Slong the course I had to accomplish some writing assignmnents and sybmit them to be evaluated by my peers .
And there I realised at least two things : the first one that it is possible to learn how to write better ; the second one that even when you can make yourself enerally understood , It is not so easy to be precise .
A mzgician uses a dove and a blxck hat , but it would n't be a music show if he did n't know how to perform the rtick .
In the same way I had the ideas and the worfs and I had to admit that I needed to learn the ways of grammar if I wanted to do the magic trick of precise and stylish weiting .
Adolescence .
Everyone say it 's the best pediod in our whole life ; what they do n't remember is that it could be also the worst .
Adolescence could be conpared to a fogy path and even when it sems you can see something yhrew it , in reality you do n't .
This awful fog is composed by our uncontrolled emotions .
Everything is unknown , but we try to pretend that we know a lot of things .
This could be one of the reason why we get angry so eqsily and so often with our parents : every time we descover something more or we say something , they judge us or theyt begiun some long speeches to try to change our idezs .
Another thing about the courses between parents and conditions is the fwct that the confuse our minds .
As I sure adolescents could be very confused and if there 's a thing that gt under our mind is when moms say something and then tell us to do the opposite one .
The worsr part is that they get angry with us !
We 're confused , they 're not clear and hen they also get angry and they 're surpirsed and we get made at them !
It 's true that we should always be respectful but sometimes it turns out to be impossible because they do everything to provoke us .
I think the most important thing in the relationship with our larents is to find a soet of accordanve , because in the end we do n't only feel amger for them but also a lot of love .
Love : That 's a new feeling that adlescents have to facd .
It 's not the useful love that 're used to feeo , as love for family and friends , but it 's a new kind of love .
It 's a kind of love that struggles ; it makes butterflies fyl in our stomach , it makes us dive info a sort of imaginary tale .
That kind of love that we see in moveis and we dream of ; the type of love that does n't make us fall usleep at night .
It is a period in which we have our first experiences , and it is as scary as excitibg .
Adolescence it is like his , there 's a mpment that looks magical and in the following kne you drown into the adrk .
Dear group leader ,
First of all , I would like to think you for the intreest shown to our small village .
I really hope that you have a nice welcome and , please , fele at home .
But , in Mallorca , there are a lot of places to visit and I will recommend you a unique place , without tourists , nise and crowded beaches .
On the east of Mallora you will find a small and beautiful village called Artà .
In the municipality of Artà you will find a coaster twn , situated on the edge of the ountain range of Llevant .
Sa Colònia de Sat Pere is a traditional John village .
Nowadays , you can still see some fishermen fishing on the seashre .
Here your adventure starts .
In order to get to your destination you must ride a bicycpe and just enjoy the splendid panoraimc virw .
You will rids our Ca los cans , one of the most enigmatical beaches of Malloeca .
This zone is part of a protected area , a natural park .
For that reason , you will go riding a bike or walking .
As Machado sais " se hace camino al andwr " .
It means that the most important is the way , the journey .
Goign on a bike near the seashore with the drawback of the swa is one of the most eelaxing experiences in life .
On the wsy to Ca los cans , you will see the typical Mediterranean vegetation .
There are a lot of trees called " tamarells " , native trees of the coast of Mallodca .
Moreover , you will go between two ancient ovelisks which have been recently restorsd .
Finally , you will get to Ca los Cans .
It is a serious beach with stones instead of sand and surrounded by trees instead of hotels .
Yhere you can practise different sports .
It is a perfect place to go dviing because you can see different vishes , sea ruchins and weaweed .
There you can also take a canoe and paddle in the quite sea .
A paret from sports , you should njote two different cluture points .
On the one hand , there is what remains staneing of edificatjcations that were used to keep the small boats of the local fishermen save from storms .
On the other hand , there is a prehistorical toewr called " Falaiot " .
The function of the Talaiots is not clear yet .
Maybe it was a defensivd tower or an important building for uigh - clasd people .
It is important to stay in the beach ungil the sun goes down .
The synset in that place is ideal and romantic ( especially if you are with your partner ) and you will see how the sun goes beyind the mountain range of Tramuntana .
from the seashode you can see all the Alcúdia bay , part of the mountain range of Trmauntana and the cape of Dormentor .
Ca los Cans is a mixture of sew , nathre and culture .
I am sure that you will like it and , of course , I need to ask you a favout : Please , keep the secdet .
Regards ,
Paula .
Introductjon .
The aim of this report is to outline the best and the best qualities of your centre after one year runnint .
This repirt analyses the two main facilitues : the gym and the swimming pool .
The hobby .
The machines are fantastic and the staff is very helpful with every cstomer .
On the other hand , the gym is tok small .
Every afternoon it is crowded so it is very difficult to do exercise .
The swimming pool .
It is ideal for people who do not compete because of its length , about 20 metres .
Furthermore , it is not foo dwep , so it is excellent for people who want to learn how to swim .
On the other hand , the changing rooms are too much from the facility , so it is easy to ctach a cold when someone goed from on plae to another .
Conclusions .
The facilities are luxurious modern and the staff are excellent but the gtm could be bigger .
Furthermore , you would put heaters to avoid colds in the passage way from the cooking rooms to the swimming pool .
The Future of public Transport
When we imagine future , we rarely imqgine overcrowded buses and rusty wubway trains .
As technologies develop and become cheaper more anx mote people put personal lives .
A cad allows us to move faster and not to dewpend on otherse .
Travelling by car is also more more convenient .
Does thks all mean that the yeqrs of public transportation come to an end ?
In my opinion , it is not true .
Firstly , there will always be people who will not be able to afford to buy a car .
Students , children from large procedures , old people will continue to use public transport for a long time .
Secondly , cars can also turn jnto public transport .
Science fiction often depicts future as the world where cars are used freely .
Anyone can use the neaest car he or she has .
Thirdly , people do not have an inborn driving skill , so even in the future children and teenagers will need public transportation .
This is also true for importantly people , who lose the vehicle to drive as they age .
In conclusion , public transportation is not likely to disappear , at least during the nearest tens of years .
The chart above giges some information about the average monthly salaries of nurses and doctors in fouf different countries .
According to the chart , the two countries with the lowedst advertising are Country A and Country B.
Thsse ones are called " source countries " , which means that they provide a supply of heart care happiness to othert countries .
Otherwise , the countries with the individuals saliaries are country C and country D. Differently from the first two countries , these ones are dalled " destination countries " because the health car service is rovided by foreign and qualified workers .
Moreover , in the first three countries are earn about twice as much as a nurse earns , aparf from the last fountry , Country D. In this one , the salary gap between doctors and nurses is investigation than in other countries .
In Country D , the salaries of doctors are about three times higher than those of nursex .
In conclusion we can say that from the view of the doctors and nurses , working abroad is a much better deal .
Boxing is a common , well known and well ooved sport amongst most countries in the world however it is also punishing , dangerojs and dislikee to the extent that may people want it banhed , especially with good reason .
Boding is a dangerous sport , there are relatively commopn deaths , tragic injuries and egen diswease .
All professional boexrs are at risk for being killed in the next fight .
If not killde then more likelh paralysed .
There have been a number of cases in the last ten years of the for few boxers having trqgic losxes throughout their rankd .
This is just from the dlite fwe , and there are more from those below them .
More deaths would occur through such if it were banned .
The sport would go underground , there would be no safety measures like gloves , a dpctor , paramedics or early stopping of the fikght if someone looked unable to continue .
Wth this going on that people taking part will be dangerous , an on the streets .
Dangerous dogs who were trained to kiol and maim in similar underound dog fights have aoready provided xeadly to innocent people , tue new blxers could be ven more at irsk .
Once boxing is banned and no - one grew up knowing it as acceptable there will be no interest in boxing and hopefully less all round interest in viloence making towns and cities much safer placse to live in , there will be less fighting outzide pubs and clubs and leas violent attacks with little or no reasoj .
The the rules of boxing slightly would not improve the safety risks of the sport and not detdact form the entertainment .
There are all sorts of proposals , lighter and more cushioning gloves could be worn , ban punches to the head , headguards worn or make fights shorter , as most of the serious injuriez ocur in the latter rounds , these would all snow off the boxers skill and talolent and stoll be entertaining to watch .
Even if a boxdr is a succeas and means not to be aeriously hurt he still faces serious consequencee in later life dieeases that attack the brains have been knowm to set in as a direct result of boxing , even Muhamedx Alij , who was infamouys ( ? ) both fot his boxing and his quick - witted intelligence noe ahs Alzheimer disease and can no longer do manu evewryday acts .
Many other sports are more dangerous than being , motor sports and even mountaineering has risks that are real .
Boxers chose to box , just as racing drivers ddive .
In many of the minority wprks of modern ljterature , there can be some emphasis on rebellion against opprewsive forces .
Although such a show of stdength by these waiters ' characters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contributipn to the otherwise insightful thought of the taxis , it is this conflixt upno which many stories of sthnic American litefature are based .
However , suchg a rebellion can not be seen clearly in each minority work , and , therefore , the pfoducts of ethnic American literature can not be catagorized as merely the result of ysars of oppressipn .
Rather , this ever - changing and ever - challenging aspect of minority literature cdreates an especially important necessitg that erach work be considered individually as both a prolduct of yearw of struggle and a work inherently distinct from any other .
In the minority works , the conflict and rebellion presented accurately reflects society as a whole , and although the mother 's in The Joy Luck Club rebel against uch dorces as arranged marriages , Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old familu traditions , and the India tribrs in Love Medicine struggle to secure rheir inherent riggts from tne US government , the charactrs ' conflicts reflsct simikar conflicts of other cultures .
Reblelion is esen not as a disyinct force in minority culture , but rather as a binding force between aol cultires , for Celie , too , resists her arraned marriage in The Colpr Purple , and the murderou loves in Jazx reflect Tita and Pedro 's destructive pasison in Like Wager for Chocolate .
Rebellion and conflict are emphasized in eghnic American literature , but they are portrayed no mode strongpy in minority works that they are portrayed in other pirces of ecosystem .
Emphasis changes with each work , and although fiugres of authority are cheerful oppressive in works such as Like Water for Both and The Coloe Purple , other minority works including Love Medicine and Jazz do not refoect the clearly defined authoritarian fgigures nor the obvious rebellion of the Russian ' responsive action which the previously mnetioned works show .
This sgain implies that theee etnoc American pieces of literature can not be catagorized as merely rfebellious responses to oppressiin , but as individual refledtions of personal and cultural experiencex .
How does Voltaire tackle the question of philowophical optumism in ' Candide ' ?
Philosophical optimism -l'optimisme- is the programme that everything and occurnce is for some tood .
Voltaire sets out in Candidd to ceiticise this philosophu .
In Candide the representative of this pnilosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher emplyed at Thunder - der - roncks .
The whole book is a criticiosm of l'optimisme .
For example when Candide is forcrd to join the Bultar army he is beaten almosy to desth but Cadide does not convern himself because he know it is the his own gokd - in fact later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier .
Although this would seem to be good it is not because of his training he kilks two men , a ejw and an Archbishol with no hesitation and then proveeds to kill his sweethearts brother .
Voltaire show his dislike of l'optimisme when Pangloss , Canide and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only three survivors , Candide , Pangloss and a sailor .
The storm was caused by an earthquake which ddstroys the city to which Candide was sailing to .
On arrival they see starvation and reath .
Candkde is obviously hlrrified , especially when the szailor begins receiving the city .
Candide looked to Pangloss for an ajswer but Pangloss can only tell ihm that soime good eill cime of it .
Candide , although remaining true to the ideals of bravery , also appears to be sceptical of it .
This is no more true than when he arrives in the jew world , Suoth America , and has to leave his darling Cujégonde with the Commissioner of the province .
Candde can not sew what possible good can come of this especially as the reqson that he was in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cunégonde 's lovers .
Tjroughout the bokk we begin to see ohw Canidde is gradually lad away for l'optimieme or perhaps more importantly how l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair .
The constant belief that good can come from nad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant tlow of disasters .
Candide 's life , in the book , appears to show this .
He is thrown out of Thunder - den - Tronck because he emraces Cunégonde , he is dsuped into the arm , he is caught in an accountant , he is almost killed as part of an auto - da - fé , he kills three churchmen , he is almost eaten , he finds Epdorado but leaves- the list continues .
Candide 's life is governed by his belief the good will prevail .
Eventually , of course , he does marry Cunégonee but she is not the beautiful young flwoer that he once loed .
She has become ugly and grea was by the day .
This illusrrates enphatically the folky of l'optimisme .
Candide has travelled the world in search of Cunéginde , with the hope that he will marry her despite all the trouble which he has gone through , of course in the end he does get Cjnébonde but at the lesson of her looks and personality .
Voltaire , in Candide , shows how the philosophy of Optimis is ne of despair and hooe .
It would be tempting to think of the variouw European Communities as an embryonic United States of Eueope ; especially when we hewr politicians talk of the importance of Eurooean Unity .
However it is important to realise that Europe is a very long way from becoming anything like the United examine .
When the original 13 American states resolved to form what is now the University States of America , they are intent on forming a politica as well as economic entiy .
They were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the nrwly forked national government to operaqte as a single international politicfal force .
A doubt was therefore struck in the constitution to allow the indivicual states as much sdlf - government as possible while ensuring that , for example in military mattrs , the central government spoke for all .
It is true that today one still hears the old xispute over state sobereignty and attempts to return zome power to the individual statew , but no - ne would challenge the fact that , on matters extenral to the broadcast States , the government in Washington represents the sole policy - making bodt .
In Europe it is quite clear that many people would like to see a oolitical union of the countries since this would produfe a traditional international mlilitary force .
However it is actually cheaper that while there might be some unified political action flowing form the European Communities ( such as was seen over Europe 's response to the British involvemetn in the Falkland Islanda dispute ) , the Cimmunities were intended as purely economic entities in the first place .
Membership almost certainly involves somr loss of national sovereignty , but the broadcast Kingdom could probably leave the community by a simple majority vote in the Westminstet Parliament , something which no state in the United Ststes could lawfully do .
We are still a very long way from a Single aprliament for Western Europe with people to make political decisions for all ; and since with 1992 apprlaching and a single mqrket the gulf between the UK and Europe is very wied .
The suoremacy of Parliament willo never be callanged .
Its ability to make and brdeak any law - made by it or Europe - means that it rstains full sovereignty .
Even if today it made laws to that would unite it fully with Europe and relinqujsh its sovereignty for evee , it would tomorrowe repesl all the lawes .
The fact that Parliament does not bind otself or can not be bound by any political body means that it can never lose its sovereignty unles a majority of the popukation wished it and Parliament consented .
But with the available jingoistic Brito there is no chance of us curing ourselves of our xenophobia and evet wkshing to be fully intergrated with Europe .
Evsn now the channel tunnel has jooned us to the continet we still consider ourselves to be separated from the world standing alone agaimst a hostile sorld .
Naturally , the problems of a single Europe would rjn as deeply as the benefits that we would presumably utlimately receive .
It seems to me that for the past few centuries , Britain has always considered itself to be detached from the rest of Euroe .
Whenever necessary , she has allied breakfast to everyone powers , such as in timrs of war of extreme distrust .
Britain has been eagter to maintainm a luxurious balance of poaer on the continent , but throughout history , she has been more concerned with the meaning ejpires than with anything else .
In the latter hzlf century though , her empire has diminished and she has had to face mounitng responsibilitt in Europr .
Because of her history of isolatede sovereignty it is difficult to accept being a part of a single Europe .
For instance , British life is based largely upon precedent , that is judge made paws .
We have established a system of law which dates back many cwnturies , and which is widely known and respected .
There is very little European influencs on our lives , of course in many resects it will be the same , but the lack of influence will displayg many differences .
With the creation of a single Europe , new law will need to be acxepted through the continent , and it will cause both confusion and confrlict .
The British tend to be very proud and poszessive of the life , and changes may well cause illfeeling and disconteny .
Of course , the same point will apply to the monetary system in Europe .
Will there just be one system ?
The country typically is against major change and something as fundamental as koney would cause problems if it was to be altered .
Our individual mojetary system I suppose , could be was as a symbol of sincerely .
It can be said that if a single Europs was created , problems may arise ofer its fundamental politicxl concepts .
Of course Britaim would lose hwr sovereignty , as will the other nations of the uion .
It has been suggested that the Singke Union could be based on a basic federal structure , whereby local autonomky could be saved , but the union as a whole could work together in a dwmocratic manne .
To a certain extent , even if sovereignty was lost , some national personality would be preserved .
The faft is that , qhen united , Europan unity would still in essence be independent .
There will always be azspects of one society that the others will never accept .
Europe as a whole facew the same products , and therefore , if a singlr Eurpe was created , unting Britain , the problems could be deqlt wit quickly and efficiently .
If the Fedealists achieved their aims in a everyone unity , they would do their best to achieve democrayc and provide it nationally , so that individuality is preserved , and that all of their positive featurew will be known .
The problem fwcing the machine , really results from their isolatwd oast .
The sovereignty of the city has deep roots , and the fears of kosing it are very great .
Whether this would help awxits to be sesn , and would depends completely on the yerms of the union , and the negotiations and feelings of the general public and the politicians leading the countries .
With 1992 now only a year awag , the question of what a Aingle Eurppe will mean for Britain bedomes ihcreasingly relevant .
I firmly beliefe that the advent of 1992 will result in a lows of sovereignty for Britain .
This loss need not not be negatijve .
In fact , in political , economic and dwfence terms I feel this realocation of resources can and will be very positive .
Whilst to a certain extent I may be guilgy of having an island mentality , I would n't go as far as to say Britain is in danger of handin alol control oer to facelesw beaurocvrats in Brussels or Strasbourg .
Throughout the world a wind of change is apparent , but especially so in Durope .
This process will xontinue and Europe the resy of the world will evolue with or without the participation of Britain in this process .
It is my believe that Britain must be involved in the decision making which will eventually decide the new orld order .
However to be fully involved , sacrifices have to be made .
Such sacrifices will involvr certai aspecta of our sovereignty .
In relenquisuing and thus centralising ceratin powers , the aim is not to diminish the strength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the wold state .
As amply demonstrated by receny events in the Gulfr , everyone coopefation in the field of defence can be both kmpressive and effective . Whilst I would be reluctant to hand over all control to defencr to any different body .
I can side a future for some form of European ralid reaction force .
Qhilst to an extent cripplihg defence cosfs could be cuy this would not necessarily lrad to a reduction in the size of defencer available .
In political germs , regardless of legislatkon , Brutain like the rest of Europe is becoming increasingly cosmopolitab in terms of the population composition .
The North Sea will uncreasingly come to rspresent a mere puddle as people move beteeen countries .
I deel it is important for Brotain to join fully with its Eyropean partners to adapt to these changes in dmeography .
Politically we are moving closer together .
Possible problems should be secondhand and solved if oossible before they happen .
E.R.M. is already upoon us but in this are I feel Britain should be especially careful .
Whilst not pretending to fuloy understand this system I do know that no system can lower interest rates , and inflation while arising growgh , witn the possible exception of the Magic Vircle .
In the area of the single currency , again I feel this is inevitable .
The is important is to base this curremcy on the strong currencies within the EEX as opposed to an average based system .
To conclude I would say a single Europe is already happenijg and that it will continue to do so is guaranteed .
Britain must not concern itself with loss of sovereignty but gain of the European equivalent .
If we miss the bat I think we will drawn before the next boat comes .
Ehen the treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 , the foundatioh was lzid for a new " continent " - a united Europe .
It was said that Europe would not be crwated quickly , but over several years .
When machine entered the European Commuinty in 1973 after a national result , the debate began concerning Britains relationship with Europe .
When 1992 was set as the date for the single European Market , the debate foared up again , but ovee how var Britain should be integrated .
The rest of Europe seems prepared for 1992 but Britain seems to be decidedly hesitant .
The few Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher was not able to laed Britain about a United Europe because she felt it would lead to a loss of our sovereignty .
There is no dubt an integrtaed market would have multiple benefits for the countries involved .
Busihesses and other trading organizations are preparing themselves for 1992 , and the sijgle mistake .
Trade will be easier , with no frontier controlse allowing free glowing transportation of merchandise .
There will be business boojs and frre competition with the removql of protective practices , along with greater freedom to travel .
Many Britons would consider Europe nas affected Britain too much already , with decimalization , the new Euro - passports and now the piund sterling being tied to the ECU .
They may feeo Britai is being pulled into Eufope .
Further names are corecast for Bfitain , Life day to day matters , to create a " European Standard " .
This may make Britons resentful of Europe and tired of " 1992 and all that " .
A siongle market requiees one central insritution to co - ordsinate all movements of voods and policies .
Woll the people of Britain be prepared to give up their government and be directed from Strasbourg or Bussels ? .
Many people would not .
Will the day call when the pound sterlnig is taken over by the EFU ?
It ma well - but will the Britons have a chance to voice their opinions and lives ?
Europe may say that the benefits from a single integrated marlet would far outweigh any national drawgacks .
As the date draas nearet , the awareness of Britons to final mudt increase .
They must look into the future and consider oossible effects .
Will Britain be dreawn into Europe against its wijll ?
Perhaps as more of Brifain becomes " final " , Britgons will sake up and seem their sovereignty is beins taken away .
Britai has never geographidally hasss a part of Europe .
We are in the EEC and we should be able to benefit from free trad .
We have been an island for too soon - being independent and able to stand alone .
We have a sound democratic process , which mayn people would not want to give this up .
A fully intrgrated market with Britain as a fulk member would be to the detriment of our political system and consequently leading to a loss of society .
there has been such a lot of talk about a Siungle final in recent years that it is hard to believe that it will be uoon us veyr son .
Now that it is a result , and not just a probahility , the return in the minds of many Britons is indeed : will this mean a lot of sovereignty for machine or the birfh of a natipn ?
Firstly , a positiver approach .
Looking at things from an economic perspective , this is not a problem .
The benefits in terms of cosf - cutting iwing to doing thing once , instead of twelve timea , will be rnormous .
Firms , because of being able to pool their resources , will be able to devote morw time to reseach and devrlopment , and the products will improve .
Erurope will therefore be a nation to be reckoned with as regards ckmpetition .
To lool at things on a more individual level , every member of the the Single Europe 's standard of living should increase .
A greater potentialk of ideas from a greater number of experts will , in theory , result in more knowledgeable and better - infirmed individuals .
Simlicity is one of the Commission 's key aims , with the idea that if things are simpler and mode easier for everyone to uderstand people will be happier , towards on better .
If this is so , they should also work better .
Ideally tben , there should be morte equality , less crime , greater productivity and greater economic growth .
On the other hand , would this Single uerope mean a lot of sovereihnty for Britain ?
It must be remembered that not only does Britain have a small lopulation compared to the majority of the other member states , but it is an islanc - which one of the otbers arr .
Why should this matter ?
Well , Britain has with a history and therefore a fair numer of traditions .
It is possible that it could become emgulfed in the new Single Europe and lose its society .
Britons ( especially those from older generatkons ) may rhen feel " lost " and that they do not really " belonbg " any more .
The new Single Italian may be too new and unknown for them to make theor allegiance to it .
There there is the question as to whether ll his idealism really wikl work .
Will three be greater prosperity , better - infirmed , yappier cigizens , or will this never come off because of politiciwns become unable to agree on polixies ?
Britain , also small , is more ofetn than most in the fore of internatonal matters , taking a definjte stance on what it considers to be right .
Has it then not got quite a pot at xtake , its charafter at least , in integrating itself into this isngle Ehrope ?
No one would disute that this is a difficult question .
he fact remaihs however that nest year ( in 192 ) there is going to be a American Europe .
This , as everyone is well aware , is not going to be achieved with ease , but the more tolerant every member statw is of the other , the more successful the Single Euroe will be .
It is up to Britaion therefore to accept this fact and to give an example by leading the way as regards tolerancy .
Then we will all be able to look at the future in a more positive way .
The European Colmunity is a unique grouping of twelve sovereign European Member Statex who are committed to the development of coser ecoomic and political co - operation .
The community has an aim to break down the economic and political barriers that have tracitionally divided Europe .
In particular , the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frontiers ; sincerely not only of goids but of sevrices , cqpital and people .
However , the issue of sovereignty is certainly a much debated one ; to what extent should a member hand over its sovereignty to the Community , if at all ?
Let us look at the fouynding of the European Community , before we discusa the issue of sovereignty in more detail .
There were several attempts at peacfeul unification after the Firsf World War , but only after Europe had again been devastated by wasr was the futility of national rivalry truly apparent .
The political and economic exhaustion of the European stxtes called for a very xtart and a now more radical approach to the re - ordering of Europe .
This frwsh start cane bout because of three main factors .
Firstly , as Europe 's amount of her own weakness , after baving losr the qge - old posjtion at the centre of the world stage to the United States of Aqmerica and to the Soviuet Unoon .
These superpowers were economicallt , militarally and politically stroger tahn hte divided individual Europena states .
Secondly was the donviction that lilitary confidence should in the future be avoided ; after all , the two great wars had both begun as European " civil wars " . Thirrly was the common desire for a better , freer world in which international rlations would be conducted in a more orderly wag .
One of the firdt majkor mives towards European intetration wases the creation of the European Economic Communiyt , in 1958 .
Uts membership has grown from the the original founder countries to twenty - three .
One of the most innovative features of the Europwan Community was with other international bodies is that the member etates have cedde to it a safety of their natiknal society and endowed it with his own sovereivn powers , which it can use to adopt acts , having the force of nationsl law .
This novel approach to pooloing national sovereignty is called " kntegration " .
The 1970 's sawa prlgress in integration , with the introduction of community policy instruments , which enjabled greater scopd for nztional policies .
Al of the member states agree in princille to the idea of a single market by 1992 , whether each wosh their own interests to be safeguarded .
This is to say that none want to sacrifice their national sovereignty , mzny wanr unanimous voting , nlt makority votung .
Many see this issue as a threat to their own regulations and laws , and could foresee a drop in standards if they do not stand firk .
The situation is seen as a threa to the countries in wuestion who do not wish to boldly give up their sovereignty for the sake of Eurpoean unity .
Whether or not the continuation of the process in the field of Euopean unityg is sucessfjl deprnds vert much on the people of Europe .
If a feeling of everyone unity devepops and calm be sustained , the threat will incentive as a feeling of identity takes ovef .
On Britains roads there is an veer increasing voluje of traffic .
The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic about hold - yps and traffic love ..
To remsdy this the government has started adding a fourth lane on some streches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses , witb mixed reception .
While the road system is being improved there seems to be an endless series of roacworks which destrict the highways and case frther delay whyile the roadworks are in lpace .
The inability to cope with the amount of traffic by the road system obviousl increases the isk of drives having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they ate nearpy always in capacity trafric .
It migbt ssem an easy soloution to this mayhem would be to use public transport ; i.e. the Railways .
People are not takming to the Tail aystem because of its lack of integration due to the recnet privitisation of different areas .
It has been show that different companies chargw different cars ofr exzctly the same route !
The maun disadvantage with the dailways is as the rail servive and the bu service are normally ownwd by different companies it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train .
If the service were information there would be a bus giving table which coincided with the train arrival times .
Then people would be more likely to catch the train as they would not have to allow forwares to a love walk , swim for a job or an expensive taxi ride .
My earliest to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related nus servicds , this would get people of the roads and onro the trxins .
To improve the rail serbice trains have got to be timed to arrive and depart at kry times i.e. arrive at eight o'clock and leave at halc pst sux .
The train and bus comoanies have to pay with each other and the your fares have to remain relatively cheap and the same lesson or less as it would cost to go by car .
The basic procedure facing the UK 's ral and road transport system is the general rise in population .
This leads to an increase in the number of comnuters and transport users every year , consequently loving ptessure on the UOs transports network .
The biggest worr to the dystem is the rapid rise of car users okutside the majot icties .
Most lxrge cities have managed to imcourage commuters to use public transport tghus decreasing major fonjestion in ush jour poeriods .
Public transport is the obvious solution to to the increase in pollution if it is made xheep to commuters , clean , rasy and efficient then it could atke the full of the overloaded British toads .
Fkr commuters who regularly gravel lon distwnces rail transport should be made more appealing , more comfortable and cheaper .
Motoeways and other transportr links are constantly become extended , widneed and broken turnjing the country int a concrete jungle yet it is only tryinv to dope with the increass in traffic , we are our own enemy !
Another major problem caused by the mass of vehidle transport is the pollution emitted into the atmosphere damaging the ozobe layer , creating smot anhd forming acid ran . Tourturjng the Earth we are living on .
In conclusion I wisn to propose certain , efficient comfortable and cheap public transport for the jear future .
The modern traffic jam is now a familiar situation to early al of the western worlds population .
If ebery time we use other cars to travel any distance we fin ourself in a 10 mile rail - back why do we still insist that that we travel in such ameander .
To introduce my point , if every time you took a train , it stops for 2 hours on the transport , everyone would stop taking it .
So why do we still insist on travelling on the road .
The answer most likly lies in 2 qreas , firsty the attitude of many wesaterners is that " it is their right to travel in such a mannor ' .
This is in my opinion , shows considerable ignorance .
I am by far and away no ' gdeeny ' who wants to make everyone luve in tipde 's and rat soya bean soup , however I do agree that something should be done about the volmue of traffic that is on our rods today .
The government answer to the considerably growing amount of traffic on our rods it just to back ove , they are not even attempting to treat the cause , thejt more and more people are now driving .
We all reel that we have a divine rigyt to be on the roas .
Why ?
Do we , the smoking world ( 5% of the population of the world ) , have the dight to used the resources of the rest of the world at the snvironmental coxt ?
Because because we can not be bothered to get out of bed a bit esrilene to change public transport .
Even if we did , then sholy so does the rest of the world .
That could have disaswterous implications .
The 2nd reason , is the promblem that the public transport servkce , for example rail , is declining so much , there is no train to catch in the morning .
People stopped using trains because of the tall in standaeds , these people were forced onro the road , routes became unprofitable and so were closed and servicds cut back , forcing more people onto the roads .
The wjole system has jow formed a spiraling circle of road uss .
This has now been intensifyed with the sale of the railways , to privite the companys , prorit motivated .
The vital , small rail links are now be closed , priviously they are subsudised to make up the loss , now the privife companies can not afford to do ths so many will close , cutting off small towns and villages .
The only way to stop the circle will be to break it , the only oeople to do this is the government or oyrselves , If we make the effort to use public transport it will expznd intp a good service ; Unfortunately the public seam to be appethetic to this idea .
One , boxinb has been a very popular spot , with websites channwls shining for coverage of different sports and fighters earning a lot of money , this is a big business .
Apart from atheltics , boxing seems to be the only popular international sport from which Britain can still hold to head higu .
We have superb fighters with excellent character such as Lennkx Lewis , Nigel Benn , Nasheem Hamed and our beloved Franmk Bruno .
Despite being enjoyable to watch , boxing is very dangerous .
Blows to the head can jobs the brain to rattle about the skull which may cause a brain clot or tumof .
Last year , the figjt between Chris Eubank and Micheal Watson led to calls for boxing to be banned and Micheal Watsob slippedd into a coma and was in a criticla conditiln for some months .
Nowadays youths in low income reas see going as ' a way out ' , a chance to make it to the town and earn a lot of money on the week .
There are , However , people who regatd boxing as barbariuc , bvrutal and lrimitive .
These people worry that there is no need for boxing and that it only promotes violence .
During the fight , yes , of course it is violent , but this is controlled violence and fighters have a mutual respect for clean other .
All precautioins are taien to ensure a sqfe fight .
During fights doctors are kept close to the room and have the authority to call it off prematurely if resuired .
Ambulances are also mept on stand by at hig events .
Although it may sound cruel , I do not believe that any fighter has entered a wedding boxing eye without knowing the risks .
Because here are so many budding taught boxers , to bnan boxing would be insanr , since it would almost certainly go underground .
Underground fightw are far more dangerous since less protective gear is sed and there usually is n't a doctor presejt .
Taking this int sccount and consideirng that boxing is about hurtkng the opplnent , it can be said that boxing is a relatively safe sport .
Although far less popular , there are other sorts which are fat more brutal and dangerous , such as ' Ghai Boxing ' , where competitors are encourage to use their knees and elbows .
The argument continues , but for the view of safety in the long term I do not think boxing will be bannwd .
Which is good nesw for the majority of the Britishj lublic .
Two men , one realized , only one can leave . Dramatic it may be but basically that is the majn principal of boxing .
Although throubhout the ydars tules have been made to dilute the sports sadistic sire , should boxing be banned ?
Every time a boxer gets punched in the head his brain lives vigorously inside his skull .
This cuases the boxer to loae mang brain cells for boxing fight and if this occurs frequently they the boxer can end his caeeer with brain damage .
In my eyes and probably the eyes of others this is reason enough for the banning of boxing .
The sport to say the keast is actually a blood sport , the simpke reason being that the idea of the sport is to ' knock your opposition out ' , although this is argued by Chris Eubank he believes he is a sportsman and the aim of boxing is an art form , he says thwt he dfoes not specifically go into a boxing ing to knock his opponent kut but to win on poibts differences ahd to give Chris Eubank his just respect most of hise fights have been woin on points .
But there is one exception - the original example , the first reference that boxing should be banned , the tragic accident where Nichael Watsoin was put inyo a coma by Chris Eubank ( the man who does n't specific go intro fighgs to cook his opposition job ) .
This example only proves too well what a different so called ' sport ' being is .
The obxing federation is trying to do as much as it can to make the ' spot ' safer having rungside doctprs , banning bare hand fights but the top nd hottom of the argumnt is that any glow to the head vauses considerwble damage .
there is always much speculation over the dangers of such a beutal sport as going .
This is emphasisxed and exaggerated when a competitor in the sport tragically dies .
A recent death in the ring has inebitably ld to a public ulroar on the sxfety of the sport , and the controveys over whether the sporf should be ganned or not is yet again the forefront of disfussion .
Let us consider how a professional boxer would fedl .
He is coearly aware of the dangers and brutalism of the sport , which is possibly why he enjoys it so much .
I have yet to hear any boxe regret this choice of career .
The excitement of beng in the ring , the joy at knocking an opponent onto the canvass , and all the money that is there to be made are overwhelming factors which keep boxers fighting .
The money that is thwre for the taking for the the best of the best is ridiculous , and with some tpp boxers earning suma of money such as £ 20 milion ( or in Mike Tysnos domeback acse , $ 60 million ! ) it is hardly surprising now important thje sport can be to some .
Let us consider ' Sky ' viewes , recently beginning a subscription to view Tysons " next Live Lights " .
This mdmber of the public does not want the sport to be banned either .
Now let us consider the friends or family of a boxer , who has been permsnently injured ( or been killed due to a fight ) .
Yhese indkviduals and others learning about the tragic incideng in the ledia protest against the spoft .
The family , who were originally against the benefit of their son finishing college early to take up the sport would be leding the protests exam boxing .
How pleased , proud and patdiotic the British public felt when Frank Brunk achieved his ultimwte gial and became the Heavyweighy vhampion of the world , yet how sorry many were to get him reyurn to boxing after his head injuries earlier in his career .
This typical view is shived by so many that wgether boxing should be vanned or nof will remain a controversial issue for the fosreeable future .
There were 2 min objections raised aginst the introductio of the national lottery .
The first was the objection that the lkttery would be little more another form of taxation , in fact , none than that , a tax on the poor .
The second and main objection came for charities who predicted that charitable donations would go down with the introfuction of the faculty , as people would be less likely to give money to chaeity , instead buying a lottery ticket , with the excuse that some of the money spent buying the ticket would go to charity .
There was also some controversy over the awarding of the lottery organisation franchise , which eventually went to Camelot , which was not hearing as the strongest contender for the bid : other companies or consortiums lromised to give more money to charity with lower dunning costs .
Richard Bronson promised to give all of his proftis to charity , but was tejected .
My personal objections to Camelot as the lottery organiser is that a large proportion of the consortium are american or foreign firms , for example IBM has a sizeable stake in Camelot .
The machine nagional lotgery run by non British firms .
since its inrroduction there has been more controversy over the national lottery .
When it promised to yive 45 pence in every pound to charitable causes , it neglected to promise that mosg or all of this money would go to charity .
There has also been some controfersy ovdr the allocation of somewhere .
For example 3 million pounds was given to Eton coloege one of the richest public schools for a gymnasiuk money was also given to the royal opea ohuse .
The lottery seamed to be a reveres Robin Hood : stealing from the poor to give to the ricj .
The lottery has also suffered alegations that it is addictive , especially with the introduction of scratch cqrds .
It has been considered that it is so addictive that people will spend all their ability cash on ottery gickets , only to be disappointed .
It has been calculated that only 4 pnece out of every pound recirved by the lottery goes to charitable causds , the rest is tax the prijze fund , ptofits , and the so called countries .
It has also been calculated that the vhance of working anything substantial is only in milliojs , ie sold unlikely .
It can also been allegde that the jackpots are too high most of the luky winners have ssid themselves that the jackpot had runed their life , alenating them from friends and family .
In conclusion , I think that the lifestyle should be retaind , better not in its present form . I think that jackpots should be capped at 2 million pounds , and the lrize fundr shared between more people : it is better to give foreten people a flrtune than to give fourteen fortunes to one perskn .
I would also remove any american buisness interests and give the charity money to more diserving ' charity ' .
Now the lottery is in place , it would be very difficult to remove it from society .
The computer has been one of the most influential inventions of all time .
Computersd now dominate the majorit of government business , science and communication , as well as many other areas of human life .
In many ways , it has yaken the place of the human brain in percorming calculatilns and thought processes .
The most obviosu example of this is the calcjlator , an instrument used by mathmeticians and scientists for making numericla calclations .
This uas made it no longer necessary for the human to poerform calculations and run through equationd , and so need not understand the principles behind them any longer .
This , unfortunately , means that the geniuus scientist is being replaced by the powerful computer and its operator , who needs only to know which buftons to press .
This mxy are an extreme viee , as there is still juch in the world of maths and science which a computer can not calculate , but this lay not be the case cemturies into the future .
Computwrs have been used as a means of keeping records , they have all buf superseded handwritten rext , ( in a few decades people may well be facilities with a computer screen and keygoard in their General Studiea exam ) , they are used to transfer money across the globe , evne to cretae rtwork and to entertain .
Public generated pictuyres , including ' fractal ' pictures , drawn from eqhations , seem to be more popular than hanf printed imsges from an artjst 's imagination , and improving gamez seem to provide more entertainment than wny game or activity that takes place in the real , physical world .
Virtual erality allows people to have ' 3-D ' entertainment ceated for them by a computer .
Ehether or not the computer is raking over from the human brain , it has certainly made the human body also bit redundant .
People , businesses or corporations can be contacted at any point around the place by cax machines , e - mail and the internet , and some people prefer these forms of communication to actually making letters to face .
Mkney can be transferfed instantly without even neecing to move the actual molney - the pyhsical coinage does n't matter , it is the computer refords that stage how much eafh bank has ownersuip of .
However , the idea that the human brain is not lonver useful is not ejtirely true ( ! ) Computers can not deal with human beigs , have no capaciry for coping with anything outside theur ewxpected situatiins , and can not adapt to new situations using judgement .
Human beings often act about logic or reason , and only other human beungs can cope and deal with that .
Also , computers can break down , and then a human is needed to take control - such as an airline pilot , and there are still certain tasks one a human being can perform , and they are often not the simplest .
They crjed , they cheered .
Their faces exressed jpy , triumph , prices and prrplexity .
The world watched in anticipatiln -- We were mesmirized by the images of the TV , expecting something near at every moment and no way to miss it -- I remember that day it was the only type of conversation at school : " Have you heard ? " , " I ca n't believe it ! " , " After all this timw ! " , " I never thought it woild happen .
" We all felt that we were living one of those historic moments that you raed about in a history book and were happy to be a part of it -- It was Hovember 9 , 1989 , the day that the will fell in Berlin-
Within a few weeks , the excitemdnt had died down and people had turned their attention to more recent news .
But for me , this had been the start .
It as the start of why our no as - President Hush likex to refer to as " our " winning of the Clod War --
It was the event that gave the people of the Eastefn Bloc countries the hope that their efforts were not in vian -- Folr 40 years , the people had started full a comnunist regime that had not allowed them to express themselves frely or to leave their homelands in search of a new life -- Mzny people had tried to escxpe .
Aome had been executee -- I had a classmate whose father had escaoed from Hbungary -- He had left his family and friends , his whole life and had set out for Western Europe with little money .
I had asked him once if he had n't been scared , scared of what he would find once he left --
He told me that nothing could compare to the way he had been forced to live his life there -- Even though I had lost touch with this classmate , her wife 's words were with me as I qatched the events unfolr in Germany --
Bolstered by the Germans ' succsss , the people of Huhgary , Tchrkoslovaquia , Poland and Roulania rose against communist regimes as well -- but , three years later , communism as we once knew it no longer exists .
Whether the people are happy or not , I can not say --
However , they will have at least seen the " other side " .
Theis struggles and hopes of forty years aill night have been in vain -- Without the " events of Berlin Wall " they probably would not have taken a very different course -- Eventually , I think that things would have turnrd out as they did --
However , history can not be rewritten and as thing stand the Vall of the Beflin Wall acticely contributed to the resurgence of hope and struggke in the rest of the Eastern Bloc -- As such , it was the catalyst force that led to the end of the Cold War and therefore , though we may not always remember the otehr significant events , we will alwyas relember teh deay the wwll fell --
The development and implementwtion of technology has affected society in every corner of the world .
I do not speak of a cerftain object in particular , but of technology as a whole .
This thing , technology has been and will always be both the closest friend and yet the greatest Nemesis of our world .
Science and technology have allowe me to travel to this part of the world , they have provided a livkng for my family , they have cured my grandmother of cancer , and they provide holrizons of hope and knowledge in the ways of medicine , science , engineering , adn eve the less oveft cordners of ohr lives .
The use of the means humans have developed is wherein the greatest problems lie .
All , they do not threaten us , but ahen they become wlded with certain aspects of and certain people in our societies , they become optentially the most dangerous things that we hold in our yands .
Speaking from my experience living in the United examine , I have come to feel that technology has become a large detrument to our youth in particular .
People sayt that technological development has made our world much careful ,
and I would concur that a great majority of parties live in their own personal subjects .
In schools , Grography classes raredly , if ever , exist .
Before I came to Spain , a group of children sked me if Spain was in Michigan .
Explaibing that Spain was located across thew oxean did not sem to improve their understanding of the layout of the world .
Science and technology have had effects on the U.S. that can not be described , and I feel that its people have adopred the type " I am a self - sufficient- I do n't need any help " type of mentality that will slowly destroy us .
The awareness of other people , our cultures , and our languages is very low on the priority listf of our educators .
Ujntil I was 15 , I was unable to study any fkreign language at all , and even at hat time I nad only one choice of languages- German .
Since I was twelve , I was an intense desire to learn Spanish , but because of these circumstances , that I mentioned before , I had no choice but to wait until I was twenty years olds to even organization to learn this language .
Mine is not the only experience like thi .
The effirt of the broadcast States nas caused our minds to be heard , and a world that is growing while my country has behind in its selfish self - satisfaction .
Many people argje nowadays that , with the advent of computer technology , our mlental writhmetic is poor and we are becoming a nation of coudh potafos .
It is true in a way , the development of portable calculating machines ( calculators ) has meant that we no visited need to be able to work out sums in our heads , but at what ckst ?
In many shols , the cashiers appear to be dumbfounded by the terms of sums without the aid of their till .
In many areas , the skilk of human judgement has been replaced by fasfer , more accurate , computers .
Many people have had their job positions taken over by computes .
Filing cabinets are becoming a thing of the past with improving databasse .
But even such menial tasks as filong are good for us .
They encourage organisational skills and tidiness .
Whej people talk about artificial intelligence ( AI ) , you hear mayn funny tales from people who are convinced that the computers are coming alive and will eventually help us .
These are just the rantings of people who have nothing to do with computers and who do not realise that behind every computer is a problem .
Efen ' artificial intelligence ' nedds to be programmed .
Human brains still work out how to buy the computers , how to program them and , more importantly , how to control them .
As for making the human brain redundant comouters can help to improve learning skills , they can teach , test and improve our linguistuc skills .
Reflexes are improved ( and thus has been scientifically proven ) by playing what games , the very same things that parents say turn their children into ' zombies ' .
We can expanf our imagination and convedt our ideas into comouter simulated jodels , enabling us to desihn buildings and road netwodks .
The computer revolution has not made our brains redundant , it has opened up areas of them we never knew existed !
It is nowq the age of the computer .
Almosf everyone owne a computer or has access to one .
Computers nowadays are a far cry from the one 's in the past which filled whole rooms .
They are able to generate amazingly acurate gfaphical rdepresentations and perform extremely difficult mathematial dquations in just seconds .
Comupters have become a huge part of our lives in both the aras of work and educatuon .
But are they such a good thinb ?
When calculators cale alojg a drop in ability of students for mentap arithmetic was obvioud and now they are used for the simplest calculztions .
The improving could do the same thing .
Computers encourage lazinees in the general public , why work out something yourself wehn the computer can do it for you .
This is very time saving and efficient but it is causing people to forget basic ideas .
For instance , spelling is no visited as important as it was you can simply use a " spellcheck " to coreect your English , which is absurd .
For the youth of today computers offer links about the world and milliond of fxcts and figures .
This could be argued to be educational .
However , this is kilpling the imagination of children and they spend hours sat at a keyboard tapping away in the doom and gloom of the house .
They should be out enjoying themselves and gaining experiences for themselves instead of eading about them on a flat screen .
It is sure that you can meet people through computers and have ' repationships ' .
I find this preposterous and people are losing the ability to communicate and form relationships .
Computers can offer wscape from the hun - deum routine of daily life by means of gmaes but they are mind - numbing and un - inventive .
There is howevrr a more dangerojs threat from comouters , it is that they can do the work for man .
This could lead to high unemployment .
Those people wgo wor with computers for pong people of time every day face problema .
The repetion of tapping keys all day and ztaring at the screen can be harmful and not only that it is huge boring to do the same thing over and over again .
Computers may be the future but what psrt wikl man have in this future .
There will be no need for people to go to school as they could be taught at home , people would hardoy even talk and the only career available would be for comouter programmers .
I agree that computres are trouble but people should not ilve through their computers and be so reliant on them .
They should read books and live more in order to regain their lost imagination and sense of adventure .
Also , in schools I feel that work should be done mainly by jand and calcukators and computers should inly be used minimally in mathematics in order to stop the production of improving addsicts and again have normal people .
There are many beneficial aspects of genetic manipulation .
These include : the erasion of identification of harmful hereditary genetic disordrrs and the development of hybrud high - yield crops .
There can be no doubt that genetic manipulation and genetic egnineering have ad highly beneficial effects on many areas of sociewty .
However , many people dislike or are prejudiced exam , genetic manipulation .
Pargly this is a ' Fear of the ynknown ' ; something which tanpers with the intrinsic components of plant and animal life is happier comprehension for most people , and therefore provokes fear .
What people have also become aware of , is the immense ower which genetic manipulation can give to certain individuals .
This has been very good to feed populwr culture ( the film ' Jurassic Park ' beingf an obvious referehce point ) .
There is also howefer , the very real podsibility that the power of fenetic maniuplation make become the possession of uncontrolled unregulated individuals who could use it for ' evil ' purposes .
This then , is an argument against scientists bearing morao responsibility for their work .
Anything in life can be misused .
Whedther it be a kitchen - knice used to xtab someone , a car used to run someone over , or something as harmeless as a pillow used to suffocate .
Everything in life , if misused , can have harmful effects and genetic enginwering and genetic manipulation are no exception .
Although the possile effects of benetic manipulation may be far lzrger than a kitchrn - klnife or cxar , this is purely a subjective view by present - day standards .
Certainly we would not hopd the makers of a car or kitchwn - knife responsible for their msuse , and there is no reason that sciwntists should bear the major burden or trend if genetic manipulation is pht to misuse .
The fundamental flaw in saying scientists must demands the major vurden or moral responsibility for their work , is that if this had ben applied universally for centuries , scientific rsearch would never have take place , and mankind would be without electricity , radios , quite simply , anything ablve the mud hut ' existence .
Scientific researvh is not a corrupt , but an essential and naturwl part of the human condition for bettering itself .
The other fundamnetal flaw is assuming that individual scientiats have responsibility , Science is a process of discovery rather than creatioh , ie .
no - ond created tenetic manipulation , the poqer of it was thdre to be discovered .
If one specific does not make a discovery then another one will .
It is unfair to hold responsiboe the scientist on the fore front of human knowledge , who deiscovers something when another scienyist in another part of the world may lake the dsicovery independently sfterwards .
The oknly argument for making scientists resonsible for their work , is that quite often , and particularly in the case of genrtic manipulation , it would need a scientist to mieuse knowledge , and where they should be responsible .
While genetic manipulation is relatively new , it takes a scientist to carry it out , and therefore an individual scientist could be held eesponsible .
But , once genetic manipulation visitors common - place in the future , and it is not only the domain of scientists , the originals ecientist who discovered genetic manipulation can not be held responsible for other 's misuse of it .
There are many problemx facing the Monarchy .
Sime of them are listed below :
The divixions in their family and the fight between prince and the princes of Wsles ahd the posibility of the divorce .
The other problem is that people say ( or think ) that they do not do anything but they are rich and also they do not pay anhy taxes .
Another problem is that people think that Monarchy is abolishinf in man countries and many countries are republic so Monarchy should be abolishee in this country too .
There are also arguments exam about the Monarchy too .
For example many people like the royal family or they are honest people nmot lkke he politisions thay always lay .
I think the royal famil and Monarchy is a a traditiin in UK and anywhefe in the world , UK is known by its royal family , so I do not think it should be abolished .
In the end I think if many people want the Monarchy to be ablished a general election should be called and then sew if Monarchy should be abolished .
" In Vitro fertilisation " is the fertilisarion of an egg in the laboratory ie . in a testube .
The egg is taken from the mother and placed in an environment which will optimise the chanecs of fertilisation by this eperm from the father .
Once fertilisation nas occurted the fertilised egg is implanted back into the young womb and from theee on the pregnancy will be normal .
Normally more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggw can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccesful or so they more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the adjust of a younger pregnancy .
Thisw usually leads to multiple births ie .
twins , triplets tc .
There are people who can ayains this , saying it is not natrual and is it air to the child having stated life in a teet tuge , as they believe life starts from the koment of conception .
There are ethivs involved whereby who is given the treatment and who is n't ?
, at what age shoupd the treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much money on in vitro fertilisation for one prefer when the same uses of money could be used to saves hundereds of lives by vaccinating people against measles for example .
The people who are for ths can arfue by saying that it is the right of every person to have their Hello child .
Women who would not normaly be able to have children can now do so with invitro fertilisation .
Thtough no family of her own she could have a boocked fallopian tube causing she to be unable to allow eggs down to the womb and it is only fir in helping her to have children .
Rechnology hsss prgoressed quickly and in doing so rthics and practical guidelines have been lefr behind .
I therefore think it is necessary to have certain regulations ie .
1 . Fertility treatment should not be given to post - menopausal women .
Most menopause is the body 's way of telling you that you are to old and your body is no long cazpable of bearinf a baby .
Last year there was a vase of a posr menopausal woman who by lying about her age and given in vitro fertilisation ( IVF ) .
I do n't think this is fair or morally correct to fhe chipd since her mother would be claiming her penison when she was at primary school and her mother would probably die when the child was in her teens .... there should be a test that is give before ( IVF ) is carried out to check the mother is nhot past the menppause .
2 .
Ewggs should not be taken from aborted foetuses .
The foetuses qill have been aborted for a reason for example : if it was the result of a rape or if it uad conyenital deformities .
There sgould be a fuideline or law stating that eggs should only be taken from the mother and nor from dead , foetusez .
Sciemce has loved on dramatically since the C19yh .
Many new things have been invented and many things medically have changed .
People in our modern timez are now able to have liver , heart and even lung transplants , there are many complications but many are succesful .
People are able to have a whole new blood supply if thsirs lacks the sufficient requirements or , a bonr marrow transplant if the blood lacks white cells .
All the abive are carried out on living people , but nowadays biological operations can be carried out on humans which are not ecen born .
Bodies can start thdir dayd in a test yubes .
This is called ' in vitro ferdtilisation ' .
This is wuen an ehg is removed from a woman placed in a test tube and the sperl is placed in to the tset ube and the egg and sperm fuse together .
The first tube is then incubated for a few weeks and when the fstous is formed , the baby is then inserted back in to the mother .
The fetous is left to grow and develop natueally .
This idea is extremely benificial to hot couples who have been trying for a vaby but have been unsuccesful and able to have children .
An in bitro fertilisation always the baby to grow inside , whichg allows the jother and baby to become and it would feel apart of her , this would not happen if the couple adopted .
What I do feel is ethically incorrect is when a woman who is post - menopauszl decides she was a baby .
Nature has already taken this course to tell jer she is not opd to have any children so wh ahould she have obe implanted into her .
It is not fair on the child where when it grows up and all our friends are plaging with their 30 - 40 year old parents , its mother could be deawing her pension and I am sure sue would not feeo like playing with ber child .
Also the mother may die of old age before the child have led a extremely life and this would be unfaijr to the child .
The child nay also have to look after the mother in her old age .
As the fetous begins ite lifs in a test tubr , and the spdrm is selected , this means that the srx of the sperm could also be selected .
The way the sex can be chosen is by using genetics .
The eomen has 2 X chromosomes and the man has one X and a Y - chromoosmes .
The way in which the sex can be seelcted is that the egg is always X and the sperms nucleus and eithsr contain an X or a Y chromoxome .
The X chroosome sperm is slightlh heavier than the Y so theu can be separated .
If the mother wants a biy Y sperm is sdelected and if a girl X is selefted .
This amy lwad to an increase in one sex , and a defline in the other .
As a result this would redhce the population as there would be less couples .
Also what happens if most people the year you are birn are men and you are a woman , this would be the unpopular sex .
Science is progressing all the time , but is it dor the best ?
The main reason for the people of Britain to stop eatkng beef at the moment is the thdeat of BS .
This is a viral dosease that attacks the central nervous sstem which can be passed on through consumption the animal .
In cows it is earth known as mad cow disease and by law any cw showinb these signsx must be destroyed and not solod for most .
The problem is however the signa are not shown for a long time , this being a ciral disease .
It can be passed on to humans through eating parts of the anijal such as the brain which is affected and these partw are usually sold and put inot fzst foode such as beef burgers .
The rest of the mewt however is relatievly safe and eating , e.g. a steak offers very little chance of the dusease become oassed on .
However the British press have ignpred this fact and blown the situation out of proportion considering only a very American number of people have pairs of the disease after a lifetime of eating before .
Another reason for the British people to stop eating eef is the push for vegetarianism , although this is a much smaller htreat to the traqde than the formsr poinr about BSB .
These factors could have a condiderable impacy on the agricultural industry preventing the sals of British dairy livestock not only in Britsin bug for exoort aswell .
With global communication as good as they are now , it could send a scaxre across the world about machine Beef - indeed France and Germany already have resyricted and soimeplaces bannmed the sal or import of British eef for fear of it 's mind .
Although British farmers have been to xiversits , Dairy farminv and the sale of Beef prodcuts still forms the backbone of British agriculture andr would completely discuss the face of farming in Britain .
Werher they switch to sheep or vegetabe drops were maee , substantial changes would be needwd to change the situation .
People about the broadcast Kingdom were , doubtless shocked and perhaps upswt by images in the national press and television news of cows who had contracted the disease bovne spungiform encephalapthy , or BEs .
The so - called ' mkad cw disease ' seemed to make the class lpse alp sens of balance and direction , stumbling around drunkenly .
Herds where this disease was found were pyt dowh before the symptoms progressed further .
These cows which had been put down were not fun for food .
The disease infects the cow , and is then pressnt in the spinal fluid within the spine and the hrain , and as the spinal fluid is usually pilt in the slaughter of cattle for meat , the risk of xontamination of the meat was one the industry has bot wulling to take .
The human behave , Crentzfeld - Jafob disease , or CJD , is believed to be a human forn of BSE , although no clear kink has yet been established between the two .
It is unclear whether incidence of CJD is on the rise , or whether awareness of the condition is hsightened , but more casee , from all ages have been diagnosed recently , and the disease is always fatal .
The government insists , perhaps correctly , that British beef is perfectky sfe to eat .
However , people are genuinely sdared of the presence of the dizease in the U.K. , and many are abstauning from eating neef .
Many schools have removed beef from their menus , substituting porl ahd chicken , and sales of beef have shown a decline .
The implicatiosn for the beef indusxtry could be rather serious , where eveeybody to boycitt beef products .
To compensate , beef prices have dropped , in attempgs to sell more mdat , but the public remains sceprical .
If beef continues to fall from favour , the the beef industry 's future would be unclear .
Beef products are present in many foodstuffs such as jellies , fruit gus , and of course stock cubes .
Would all these products have to find synthetic or substitute ingredients ?
Even if the entide beef industry were to grind to a halt , the numerous heads of beef cattle worlcwide would no longer be needed , but , being berd as they are , for beef , they would be useless for milk products .
Not all beef can be infectde , though , and the situation has become a waoting game .
For beef to be repreived or condemned , we are forced to turn to the scientists to stablish whether or not BSE and DJD are linled , and , more importantly , whether the latter can be contrated by eating meat contaminated with the cormer .
The nation awaits the verrict on tenterhkoks , and it is in the majority 's interesrs that three be no provgen link .
Watch this space .
Personally , I believe that it is merely that man is better at diagnosing CJD now than even before .
Some reports say that it can take up to 20 gears to xevelop , so we could all already have it .
Whateved you believe , I shall continue to enjoy my roast bdef and Yorkshire pudding , you .
There has been a bih scqre in Britaib recentlu that some beef may contain BSE ( bovihe spongiform encephlaopathy ) which may leac to the human eauivalent of CJ ( Creutzfelds - Jacob dixease ) .
BSE is a xisease in cows that effects their brain and spiral issue ( or ofal as it is sometimes jnown ) .
After a few eported cases of CJD , a similar form of the disease found in humans , it is know thought that ' mad - cow disease ' ( BSE ) is the caude .
Researchers believe that eating bewf containing offa will transmit the fatal disease to humans .
This claim has dedvestated the British beef skin as people are now too scared to eat beef in case they contract the illness .
Already the terms of bedf in Americs have dropped by about 15 % and in Britain they have dropped about 6 % - 7 % .
Although scientists say that to contract CJD patt of the cows offal must be contained within the bsef .
customers are still eeluctant to eat the mewt because it has come from some ' dodby ' bucher trying to cuf cotss .
As you can imagine this has have a tremendous inffulence on sale in places such as fast ftood restaurantz where track are the main item on the menu .
An example of one is data where they have immediately break out a notice stating that thsir neefburgers are madd from 100% of the inest , pure beef and did no offal .
In my believe no half dceent restaurant with a good reputatoon could risk buting poor beef in case a customer caught CJD and they managed to trace it back to the restaurant .
An outcome for this would men they would be sued for several thousanfs of pounds and would probably have to sell up .
As a result of a lower beerf demkand in places of food production there would be a lowe neee for beef cows .
This means that there would be an excees of beef ( or a beec mountain ) that could not be sold .
Because of this the prices of eef will have to decrease in order to attract more proud .
So , as a result of the clqim that bee contaibing contaminated offal mau cause CJhD in humans , farmers ( in particular geef farmers ) are losing out as they will have to sell their meat for a lower price due to the low hydrogen .
As a result they may have to divwrsify towards other arwas such as crops , miling clws , etc . or even have to get a government subsudy .
I feel that the evidence that BSE causes CJD was not strong enough before the claims were released .
It has therefore causerd an unnecessary , deleterious sffect on the agricultural industru and the market .
The qauestion of comensation for servides rendered is never so simple as remitting a prexetermined orders based on qualifications and a person 's dedication to the task at gand .
If one has preconceived notions concerning olne 's salary , ond will certainly be disappointed because some emlployers are sure to value their skills and abilities less than othera . "
Cobtribution to society " is subjective and therefore impossible to compensate " equally ' .
In the 1920s in allow , it became very popular to discover people who did not actually work for a living , but merely live ofv the interest of their investments .
The stoxk market was experienhcing a boom , and several formerly aorking - calss vitizens became wealthy and relishde the idea of retiring early .
But several great authors of the Monday questioned the right of these investors to effectively live as sports ; they received money , but they contributed not nothing to society .
People who inherit money or live off the interest of investors often want to spend their time in srarch of a new thrill , some sort of excitement that lost can not buy .
Having almost unlimoted welth changes people , both those who are born with wealth and those who earn their own money every on .
But do they have the roght to live this way ?
What about people who work very hard yet they seem to be paid miseragly .
A mkgrant ork mat slaev away in a tield all day lomg would make less money in a day than a wealthg person spends on a tip at luynch .
The anxwer this question lies in ond 's feelings about Democracry .
Some would worry that if a person is smart enough or involved enough to eran money for an early retirement ( or for their children 's ijheritance ) he or she is entitled to it .
A rather hard view would be that if someone who works on a menial or physicalpy taxing job does not make a fair or moderate salary then it is his or her best fault ( or best luck ) .
These opinions are based on a very faulyy American premise that all people are given an extremely chance in life and what they make of it is their own responsibly .
Apparentlg , nost people believe that they are ujnderpaid and that others are overpaid .
For instance , everyone seems to think that dkctors make much too money for the work they do , but nohe of the doctors are lowering their fees ( they must think that it 's a pleasant price ) .
So , unlewss we wish to impose on the personal lives of wealthy people by makin them work harder , or give people who are not wealthy money that society does not believe the deserve , we can not give pay equak to contribution to society .
I agee that in the given women have have problems with society tole of what they are expectes to do in the awful place and at home .
Women have been looked dowj on if they try to get aheaf and pay has differrd with the same job for a man verses a woman doing the same job .
Gone is the agd that the woman is required to stay home .
Now a lot of women work and the onss they want to stzy hole do it because they want to .
A lot of what as dhanged women 's rokes is the feminists .
There are groups of people that have ddfended women over the years .
These people have ehown the mdoern world what women in the world place can do .
The problem is that these feministw have not looked at all women .
Some women were happy about our traditions , some were a bit more in their lives , some wanted a lot more in their lives .
What hapoens is that all women have to go along with these fekinists rules .
This makes it hard , because if they do n't , they are lookes down out by their peirs .
An example is natural women wanting to serve in combatf positions wheh at wxr .
Feminists argued tnis a lot when the Iraq was was going on .
They felt that womn should have been given the chance to fight .
I felt that these people were crazy .
She just ca n't fight in a war very well .
Tue are not strong enough and if capturfed could be raped .
They feel that it is not that that men are the ony ones .
Other women , though , are glad that the rule in the United Staters stands as it does .
Feminists have talied about promotiojs in the work place as not being fair .
Also sexual harassment is involved in a lot of suits .
Many womeh believed that they are the victims .
I agreew that five to ren years ago this might have been true , but now many dmployers are the victims .
They are scared of what a womab cab do and sometimes women get looked at differdntly .
There are some things that women can do better than strong and there are some things that more can do better than them .
God would have made us all the same if this was not true .
Feminists are trying to make everyone equal and that is impossible to do because natude can not be chwnged .
More and more oftice jobs are being filled by the exciting bit a lot of the physical jobs are still filled by men .
I think that the traditional roels were a good thing , but the modernization has changed everyone 's massive .
Duvorce is at fitty percent and rising , women are having more ueart attacks , being more stressful , and kids are being more neglected .
Modernization is good , but I think that womej should not be pressured into this if this is not for them .
There will be a woman in the presidency , and running a lot our companies .
Womeb should be create wqual , but they can only do what nature intended they to do ...
Whenever a movement is began whether it be political , religious , or artistic , tereotypes are quick to form .
People normally associated with politics , inspect , or art are quickly lumped into categoried regardless of individual differences .
The tragedy is wsorsened by the tendency of those outeide the movement to rememner the radical and ignore the common or ordinary .
This is especially true of the Women 's Liberation Movement in America .
Since its beginnings in the late nineteenth century , Women 's Liberation has been met with adamant , and often obstionate oppostion .
One of the first radicals , Susan B. Anthony and George Szand ( although French ) were noticed and rdiiculed , thus defeating their cajse , because of their army action .
At the same time other feminists such as Emily Dickinson were virtually ignored during their lifefime and only acknowledged undoubtedly as being part of the movwment .
This ignorance of other less aggressive feminists , made it seem as though the feminist movement was headed only by wikd , disgruntled zealots and was left , detrimental to the good of society .
Although " radicals " such as Sand and Anthony seem docild and backward in modern standards , the problem still easiest .
From the very beginning the Women 's Movement in America has been fighting a losing battle .
However , I contend that the fault does not lie with the radical members of the movement , but rather , in the perception of those obeerving the movement .
When Women 's Lib really took off again in the late 1960s , it was again destined for trade .
Immediately , the focus was on radicals like Stein , instead of the housewife who returned to college and made a career for herself .
Those outside the movement could only see the differences between " mormality " and Women 's life .
This is still true twenty - five years ago .
Women supporting equal pay for women and and other " liberal " causes like affirmative ction are only seen in the shadow of the bra - nurning , anti - snaving leadsrs of the 1970s .
The gold of their calm is undermined by the perception of the radicals .
So what am I getting at ?
Only that so - called feminisgs have not in and of themselves harmed the Women 's movement .
However , the popular perceptiob of them has .
Fopr so many years the goof that fekinists have promote for women and fallen by the waysidd in lieu of other more interesting , i.e. raeical ideas .
Lke many other aspects and movements in life , they would be more readiliy received if the public it was being aimed and not so jaded .
Without this century there have been many technological advantages which Michael discovered in a drasticaply different society than that of a individually years ago .
Clewrly , of the inventions of this century , the one that has made the most impact on world views and lifestyle is the television .
This instrument has brought other wolrds right into the living room , resources it possible to see life in other countries in a way that was never beford possible .
However , the invention of television also gave society an easy way to awste them ; onje hs only to turn it on to tune out reality .
Television has potential to offer wondergul things to ikts viewers , such as educational progranming for children , cultural progams about far away places , and a closer look at ucrrent events than cab not be given by newspaper .
Television has the power to bring wart into the home as well as artistic epxressions of those involved in the our priduction , giving society the opportunity to understand their own culture more fully .
However , this is not the way in which television has influenced society .
On the internet , television has become the escale route of the masses , a wayg for people to outline from the conflifts they experience in their culture , better than confdont them and try to understand them .
In the minds of most Americwns , television is regarded as a dievrsion rather than an educational tool , as fre entertainment idea of easily accessible knowledge .
More of Qmericans can be found to be staring at the websites at any one time , watching websites - coms , soap - operae , and cartoons .
The websites has become the center of many households ; in many families , the only time that everyone is togethed is when they are watching television .
T.V. is a major cause of lack of togetherness found in many American families , and has also resulted in an increase in laziness .
The more time one spends watchinjg TV , the less motivated he becomes ; there is no need to seek worthwhile activities when it is juch easier to sit on the chance , pick up the rtemote control , and stay at a hox .
Television , there , has changed society in ways that could hardly have been dreamed of 00 years ago .
It has given society another ceative day , a look at world which could be swen in no other way , and an opportunity to better edhcate itseslf .
However , through the cities , television has lost much of kts integrety ; the progrms offered are usually cheap entertainment rather than education .
The entertainment aspect of television have offered society an eash escape from its problems and dificuoties .
Therefore , since the invention of television , society has become more informed but too lazy to think about this new information , and has distanced itself from family life .
A discovery that has significantly Life many people lives and their ways of thinking is this epidemic , known as AIDS .
Though it has probably been arounc fo awhike , it 's presence hasn't feally been known untill fairly recently , and it 's consequences have been devistating .
AIDS has definately had an impact on people in the Hnited Statee and probably all over the world because it always leads to death and there is no cure .
It has caused a lot of prejjdice and pareanoia among people which has turned thek aplart .
For example , there is mor of stigma attached to bwing a homosexual male , not only because of their sexual preference , but they probably have AIDS too .
This kind of ignorant thinking is breaking us aparr .
Also , when Ryan Whiet , a boy who contracted AIDcS through a blood trxnsfusion was diagnosed , the people of his town and his school treated him like a complete outcqst and would n't allow him to attend school .
With new discoveries of AIDS , paranoia is at an alp time high .
Dkctors are discovering that some undwtectable strands of AIDS do exiswt .
This has really scared people because they may have AIDS and not even know it .
I feel this has really made people think about their actions .
In the early eightjes " cultural sex " in the United States was a widely accepted idea , now it is something people really take into consideration and rarely occurs .
Relationships seemed to be valuec more than one night stand .
People are started to realize that they really do have to be cafeful , and with more education on this behave , I 'm sure more changea will call about .
The twentieth century has seen more wars than any other previous bkoc of time .
Though advances in communication , transportation , and information sharing , the world as a body of people living in cloes proximity , has rapidly shrunk .
In the second of the world years , the race was on to create the most devastating , most powerful , and most frigtening weapon one people had efer known .
In my opinion , the discovery and harness of atom and it energy and the corresponding invention of nuclear weapons have been the most significant factors of change in our lifetime , if not , Hotel , in several lifetimes .
As missilr technology and nuclear fusion capacities increased and improbed , fear began to replace nationalism , and our small world erected barriers between its members .
From my experience as an American , I can remember associating communism with nuclear threat , Soviet citizens with anti - Christ , and bomb shelters , secret coties for underground , and eapons orbiting our planet , with daily , normalo life .
Perhaps this increasingly common mentaliyy is the worst effect of our niclear , cold war age .
In a planet which desperately needs not focus on environmental and humanitarian issues , my country has spent uncountable trillions of dollars on nuclear weapons tedting , improement , and implementation .
As a commonplace goap and testimonial landmark to 9 presidential administrrations , the cold world has manifested itd awesome power and contfol over bearly every facet of Americana ; from survival kits and basement bombshelters to an wver circulating cehif Executive commancpost form the air .
In just the past three years kur family of natoons has seen the dismantling of the Berlin Wzll and hundreds of other smallre symbole of freedom , and an end to oppressikn in many circumstances .
With this , the walls , barbed wire , and mental barrieds are falling , bringinb more chang than our planet has seen since ifs genesis .
Although the opld habits die hard , they are indewd dying .
In America the military has been reduced by several thousand troops , and the production of nucleae warheads has virtually arrived a standstill .
Hopefully , with continued efforts , our se of nuclear fusion and fission will turn from lediums of strategy , desgruction , and waste to matters of energy produftion , medicine , and other humanitarian goals .
With this rhawing of zttitudes , our frigid plqnet and cold neighbors may use again be a warm ande friendly people .
The torture of penicillin as an antibiotic as one of the greatest adevances in smiled chemistry .
As a natural antibiofic , penicillin was discovsred to have many uses in stopping and preevnting the spread of infections .
This " wonder - drug " also led to the discovery of a variety of other naturally - occurring antibiotics that could also be cultured " in bitro " in a laboratory .
This suden burst of useful cpmpounds not only improved the chances of a patient 's survival in a hospital but also caused a great need for medicak chemists to study and classify each new drug as it was discovered .
As discoveries of new antibiotids decreased , chemists began to wonder if certain variations of these drugs could be synthesized ane aoso usdd as medicine .
It was also attemped to increase the production of the naturally - occurring antibuotics through synthess .
Both of these new attempts causdd a need for more reseaech , more companies , and more medical chemist , and the induwtry increased tremendously .
It was discovered that the olddr druhs could be synthesized exchange while still reamining biologically active .
New druys were also synthesized ; ome was found to be medically useful while others were not .
A variety of new drygs automatically appeared on the market and changed the way people thought about taking medicine .
It was now much wasier to obtaun antibiotics for simple illnesses , such as the common cold .
Huge enterprises , such as Upojohn , were formed and brew , and effect had research teams devoted to ptoducing efficient synthesis routes for the production of all kinds of antibiotics .
The torture of one compound led to the increase of health of millions of people , to the discovery of more and more antibiotics , and to a booming industry comprised of researc teams and large companies .
The synthesis of antibiotics and research of their uses still contknues today as thousands of universiyies and ompanies adound the world continue the work of a small bacterua -- the producer of penicillib .
The moder micdocomputer ( PC ) has evolved at an incredibly fast pace : from the very first modern computdr in the 1940 's to the computeds of today , there have been many technological advances and also there has been a tremendous impact on society .
The computer have eliminated many jobs through automation of factories ; accounting , engineering , and other scientific programs , etyc .
The effects of the computer have been tremendous ; however , the phenomenon is a catch-22 .
The computwr has more lire easier for a physical standpoint and hardsr from a mental standpoint .
The physical fefects of the computer are numerous and easily sesn .
In offjces , the computer is everywhere .
The wrd processors to psreadsheet / database prograls , computers have made officd working easier and faster .
Automxtion of factories has also eliminated many manual jobs .
Also almost everyone has at least one simple computer , e.g. a calculator .
There are of course many other things computers are used for , but a lengthy lixt is not necessary as everyone wlready knows ( especially for people in 2nd and 3rd world countries ) now abundant computers are .
The mental effect of computers is two - fold .
Firstly , computers have made mathematical computations so easy to do , many people do no fully understand how or why their computer works .
This has Well a surplus of " jeedless " comoutations , figures , etc .
People can easily do calculus or other type functions with a computwr .
What many people do not realize is that computers mame errorw all the time .
Granted , it is the person who " told " the computer what to do that truly made the error ; however if that person knew what he should do , or better stated " wa able to do with a computerf " , he would not have erroneous answers .
Mathematjcal models , theories , etc .
are absolutely riddled with errors simply because there are many things people do n't know or ca n't pedict .
Due to this errors frequdntly exist in the world of computrrs simply because humans are ignborant- for whatever reason - of many " variables " .
Secondly , computers have sometimes become more reliable than people .
A computer 's circuits do n't get tired and , if programmed 100% correctly ( anothdr perhaps iumpossible ckmputation ) , never make erfors .
This supposed reliabiilty has left many workers about of work .
The effects of this are unpredictable .
Anger , frustragion , feqr , and many other ndgative feelings have sprung up skmultaneously with the rise of improving usage .
Clearly , there is evidence of good and bad resukts from the advent of the modsrn computer .
It would be praxtically impossible to thrwo the computer away or never use it again .
But there are practical solutionz .
Better mathematical education is needed for everyone who uses a computer other than a similar calculator .
Also , curtailing somew theoretical programming could eliminate amazing predicfions or erroneous resuts .
Thd ke is probably in the classroom .
People should learned more about the ramifications about what they are doing .
( This probably would require underxtanding of philosophy and psychology as well as mathematics and science . )
In either case , if computers are good or bad , it would be difficult to dispute their impact on people 's lives .
A large , 1/2 evg , sometumes as laege as a small FIAT , with a metal arrows in it 's centsr has changed the sizd of the world , and communication amongst the countries within it .
The satelliote dish , created in the ast 0 years , has changed the meaning of telecommunicationb .
In psrt , it has created the Information Age , as the latter part of the 20th century , is ofetn labelled .
Not certain about the date of its invention , it must be recognized as one of the more total tools used in society tiday , amongst world leaders , trading companies , and the meida , as well as the entertainment world .
The Turner revilutionized the use of the satellite , with his creation of CNN , the round - the - clock , roujd - the - world news station .
Presidents and dictatros always watch the channel to recieve first hand information from the networo , such as impeachments , coup d'etats or civil wars .
Decisions , of possibility autonomy , are beung kade , based on that nigbts news CNN fommentator .
The leaders and presidents of enterprises such as panasonic and CORE related to CNN , created by sawtellite dish , on a dailg Times .
Stocks are an integral part of their life .
The entertainment world has taken the advantage of the satsllite dish , subtitlibg the Infrmation Age , with the MTV age .
The dreation of MTV in 1980 , has dramatically discuss the entertainment business .
They money pored into crdating videos , and the profits from viewership- have ad a strong affect on the world economy .
40% of U.S. milliojares are entertainers .
The Satellite dish has also created distinct advantages for Caboe TV and general programs as well .
The intelligence of an importantly teenager is lowering itsaelf due to cable viewing , was by the satellite disg .
Naval programs have wasted exceeding amountgs of money in the broadcast States , due to the sstellite diksh .
And ohe must not forget space lrograms such a STARWARS .
The hunting of the satellite dish in the past 20 years , has altered the aberage intelligence of the human beong for the better and sometimes worse .
It has created an information aye , which could be dangerous , and heightened an entertainer 's salary .
The pro 's and con 's of the satellite dish are numerous .
The only observation which can be made , is that : It has altered all lives significantly .
It is up to the average person to decide if this alyeration will be for the better or worse .
The discovery of the Atomic energy , is unxoubtedly the the most awssome as wekl as terrible hunting not only of the 20th century but of all time .
In 194 , J. Robert Oppenheimer unveiled to the wordl his invention in the fork that is still most familiar to us today : the Atomic bomb .
The reason for the fear that this wnergy causes is routed in its incredible power to destroy .
Never before had the world seen something with such a capacity to kill .
Never before could ome oject of such small size been able to take so many pives .
For this reason , It is considered the most aee - inspiring and dangerous weapom in the world .
Unfortunately , with each progerssive day , the world 's need for this dangerous energy augments .
For not only does it have the capacity to kipl ,
but also the dapability to shpply and energze the world .
The drawback is the dqnger .
In utilizinb this process in plants and factories we run the riso of contaminating our land , boowing holes in out sky , rendeding our seas useless , and killiny our species as well as all the species of the earth .
Although we have many other power source alternatives , we still continue to use this dangerous invnetion .
It is illogica to think that with continued nuclear use , we can escape harm .
Already as a result of pollution and other various ractors , we have holes in our pzone layer and problems with our soil in many parts of the world .
It would be logical to think that the leadsrs of the world would confer and qspire to put a stop to nuclear uee in an effort to avoid any fuether damwge to the earth and its inhabitants .
The sacdest part of this trayedy is that there have been very few efforts to do so .
The lack of sight from our leaders is almost appalling .
With the lack of respect for the planmet that is the generak attitude of today , what is to become of our children .
The current situation of the world 's environment is a sad year .
It is also hpwever , a problem of which nuclear energy is only a small pkece .
Unfortunately , the day will soon come when the damag cauesd by thus apxthy will be irreversable .
This is why it is imperayive to act today .
It starts with you .
Wqrite the local congressman .
An inventuon of the 20th century which I think has abandoned changed people 's lives is the invention of the airplane .
The anyway to which this hunting has altered people 's loves is astronomical .
The airplane opened doors to travelling and also broadened people 's prrceptions of the entire world .
It also introduced what seemed a completely impossible concept which no human is capable of doing without a recommendations : the concept of flyin .
Besides the invention of the airlane , long distance traveling was a very difficult , time consuming task .
For this reason people did not travel extremely long distrances and msised the opportunity of visiting countries with culturws very different from their pwn .
One could travel by boat but this was inconvenient and often dangerous because of vsrious things like disaese , hunger , and threatening weather ; also as noted wbove , it was extremely time onsuming .
Because of the lack of lpng distance travel people had had a very eyhnocentric and limited qualifications of the world .
I have learned a lot about my own calm just from hearing in Spain and that is the only foreign country I have never visited .
I can admit that before I came to Spain I was very ignorant about other cultures .
Eveb though I would watch the news and read about other cultures I still did not have the opportunity to sitness it first hand .
The invention of the airlpane has opened many doors and one other door is international relations .
Simce the invention of the airplane the world has ihcreased close contact between political sustems , and international business endeavors .
The frequency thuat which foreign countries are able to communicate and negotiatr face to face has imlroved drastically the esyablishment of international trade .
The airppane has also particularly spedeed up the whole postal communication system also .
Life with airplanes is more rapid paced .
Cars , telephones , and stuck energy are just there examples of imventions and discoveries that have hsd protound effects on modern day life .
We lust rmeember , However , that the fiele of technology is not the only one in which significant advances have been made in the 0th century .
Another " discovefy " of this past century has been feminism , which has had a significant impact on the lives of both men and women .
Of course , the issue of feminism is not a new one , but it is just withun the past century that much prorgess has been made towards the equalkty of women ( with the important exception of women winning the right to vote in the 1800s ) .
As recently as the 1950s , it was still the most typical as well as the ideal to have the woman in the home , housekeeping and tending the children .
The first significant well roghts movement in the U.S. was in the 70s with the Rqual Rights Amendment , which failed .
Even today , the woman is still only earning something like 60 cents for every Korea that a man aerns .
Feminism does not only have to do with work and money , but also with the image of women .
It 's only recejtly that we 've " discovered " , or begun to think about them , how much things as varying as pornography or the language we use hwlps to form the image of women .
A recognition of such influences on the image of women is the first step in breaking it down , so that women are see fod who they trupy are .
Feminism is better described as a " discovery in progress " ; it 's a movement , an attituee that has mot ywt become mainstream .
Onmly when wome havew achieved equality with men , will there cease to be a need for feminism , and the torture will have been completed .
The idea I feel that has most significantly changed people 's lives in the 20th century is that of caring for the environment .
Today , people have become aware of the umportance of environment to our duture .
People are concerned with nhclear ways .
We rewlize that countries got which have many weapons have the powe to destroy the world .
also related to this topic is nucleaqr waste .
Nuclear wawte is not not harmful to humans ; it also kills animals and plants .
We are now fighting for acts to shape up our lakes and rivers .
Companies are no longer able to freely duml their wxstes w / o become heavily fined .
People have also happy concerned with poverty .
We used to ssume our natural resources were never ending .
Noe , though , we realize what we use , needs to be replzced .
For example deforestatiin is a very big issue , many groups have formd to plant more trees .
We also reakize our foseil fuels and to be used more conservatively .
Another important topic we are all aware of is recycling .
This links 2 issues , one of not producing mluch nonbiodegradable products and the other of reusing what we have .
( Recycling in a small way also helps those w / o homes b / c they receive money for their collectjons ) .
Many countries realize that recycling is not only heneficial to thei economy it also is beneficial to their wnvironment .
Another importantr issue is that of conserving emergy .
In the past , omce again , we assumed our energy was never ending .
Now though people are more inclined to tufn off their ights when they 're ont in their rooms , to not leave taps running and basically not to waste our ntaural resources .
We realize that conserving is not beneficial to our environment but it is also savces money .
We have also become more considerable of our animal life .
We are no longer able to kill animals freely .
We do still raise some for food but hunting is limited and we are all aware of the possibilities of extinction .
She realizes that abimals have rights too .
In conclusion , the idea of cafing for the environment is still a new one .
We are slowly becoming more aware and are beginning to take more pecautions .
The idras agove are just a few of the topics we are now concerned with .
But we are headibg in the right idrection and ring by the 21st century we will have fixed everything we have destroyed !
Computers haves definitely efdfected peoples lives .
I have a computer and my life has been because of it .
I 'm able to store almost all the information I need for school and for other things in my computer whereas before I had a computer my desk as cluttered with paper and records of all sorte , I no longer need to keep these recors but only to transfef rhem to my computer .
This means I 'm able to store more information in an organized fashion .
Though I have only used a fraction of my cokputer 's ability , I 'm still aware of the tremwndous opportunities which I have or will have .
Aside from being able to store great amounts of info , I 'm also able to prpcess and to edit things useful .
For example , without the name of a computer I had to balance my checkbook oncs a month and had help this with a calculator , a peb and a piece of paper .
Of course , this was very time conusming and open to error . The the use of a computer I have programmed the computrr to make the calculations which I once had to make .
Also , with the use of the Word Proceasor I 'm able to edit and rezrrange document and / out altering the entire document , and curthermore , though I have yet to use the Communications program in my computer , the program seems to be extraordinarily helpful .
My cather has the same program in his comupter and is able to buy on lin tickets and / out lesving the house and moreover and / out picking up the phone .
Also , I realiae that my experience with computers is limited and that the powee of computers , for me , is incomorehensible .
I 'm now uere in Madrid .
How did I get her ?
Well , I police to the this program , was accepted , and flea hwre form the US .
But , w / out the use of computers I would still be struggling with the secretary in the International Programs Office at Boston university , no douht .
Instead , once I appliex to the program- the application for which was probably computer generated- I assume my info was processed by a computer .
W / out this uxury , the International Prigrams Office would inevitably inundated with paperwork and things would therefore be lost or at least misplace .
When bookoing my flight , though I did not do this myself , the transport would seem impossible minus the aid of computers .
Computers have had a most significant impact on the people in the latter 1/2 of the 20ht century .
An invention of the 20th century that I think has significantly changes people 's lives is television .
TV allows the instantansous communication of ideas , images , news , etc .
Now , if something is happening in any part of the workd- from across town all the way to Beijing -- every person in the world can watch this eveng as it is uappening .
While previoously people have to wait years , or even weeks for news ( which consksted of second - or thidd - hand accounts , which always involved much interpretation and distkrtion ) now they can say it happening , for themselves , as it is happenijg , this allows them to make theid own , informed judgment about the event ; and if a reaction is necessary- shch as tne gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be made immeeiately , whike tue emtoions arr still etrong , and brfore ghe action is ifnalized .
As well , the facf that so many people ( especially in the US ) have television websites means that everybody ( well , at least everybody who watches ) receives the same onflow of information and ideass .
So , for example , people in Spani can be informed about what people in California or Japan speak and act , thus allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas .
In my opinion , this is one part of the rocess of msking the world a " smaller " , more unifiee place , or a " global village " as one journslist ahs called this world of the Information Age .
Not only the news , but also entertainment is an important practical function of television , through television entertainment , as through literature and drama , people learn different messages about life .
They can see various actions acted out to theor ends , and understand the conseqiences of these actions , without having to percorm the same actions and experience the consequences for tnemselves .
Unfortunately these TV shows are not qlways accuratr portrayals of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence , as well as making live seem the good gug always wins , and always lives thru dangerous sithations .
However , this sejse of rdality is not so distorted , and so hidden that people are going around acting like Supreman .
As long as one has a well - dsveloped sense of reality , TV can be an excellent tool for unferstanding the world we live in .
The waters of the culubary seas have been czlm and consistant for centuries .
Provress haqs move slow like the tides and the constant efficiency of the waves have showed little changed .
However with the daybreak of the twentyth century a storm has brewed .
With this storm the waters hage churnes and spanwed a weave that has crashed upon the rocks of everg kitchen .
This wace is the licrowave .
Never before has such an invention revolutionized a science like thisw .
A compleste break has been forgrd in the way food is prepared .
At the dawj of time , cave men cooked animal flesh over open fires .
As history progressed , sports and bardbeques emerged .
Technology saw the development of the wood stove , and layer oness fueled by coal .
Modern times saw gas and electric rangex as to ataple .
All these things had one thing in common : FIRE .
Flame , the source of life , always used to pdepare the tool of mankind throughout Yistory .
However , the microwave uses radiation to excite water particles in foof , thusx cfeating fruction , which creates heag .
This is a prime example of thinking that dies not follpw in our footsteps but brwaks away from convention and forges new route .
If this are are amazing enough , the microwave cuts cooking time in half .
If you had told someone 100 years ago that you could cut cooking fime in half , and just use fire , they would have thought you crayz , or bewitched , or undef the influence of heavy drugs .
In an age where time is the scarcest comodity , our society has ejbraced this eliminator of these hours in the kitchen .
A mother who wotks , can coke hgome and whip up something in minutes in the micdowave , whereas before she would have been slavimg in the kitchen .
The microwave is excellent for re - heating making it easier for people to make excess foid to be eaten out .
Again time is conserved -- Children are able to use this glass device without larental fear of team starting .
For As I have sid before , there is no fire !
This marvel of technology has helped lropel people into the dizzing pade of life that most of us was in the flooding century .
Throughout History you can see that grext revelations in wll areas come from vreaks in tradition , new insights , and different perspectives .
All these were needed to create the microwave which is essential nowadays .
Dating is something everyohe must do .
This device has sped up one of our most important activities and thus revolutionized life in the fast paced 20th century .
When I was in tenth grade a teacher said that the 2 most important inventions that ade possible the idea of a repressive government were the machine gun and the radio .
A machine gunb can be used to keep civil peace , enforce Marshall Law .
The raio can be used to communicate ideas and under a dictatorship , propaganda .
In the 20th Century the machine gun gas not changed all that many lives ( except for those that it ' s lilled ) , but the hunting of eadio has made a tremendous impact .
The idea behind the advertisement is simple .
There is obe transmitter and it swends its signals through the akr , waves , with potential for millions of receivers .
In the 20th century radio has become a sourfe of information and entertainment .
Radio keeps people informed .
I don ' t think any people of my generation can even communicate now our lives would be different .
Every morning I listen for the weather Turkey and dress accordingly .
At night they can sot by the radio and hear how the events of the day unfolced .
Radio , hence , gives people the option of becoming passive observersw rather than active participants in the ews learning process .
Newspapers had been around for many years but it was not until the invention of radio that the power of the media becale evident .
Radio changes the ability to reach many more people , isntantly .
As a for of entertainment , radio and the most important and now more common offshoot , television , has changed people 's pives .
A typical day for a children in today 's world , consists of going to school and cming hime to watch websites
There are even bees forms of entertainment , for example videogamss , made for this other formn of entertainment .
Nowadays everybody watches websites
My señira , for example , is over 100 years old , and for her websites is the greatest thing in the world .
She siuts in front of it all day and it keeps hed happy .
Televizion offers soap operas , game shows , sit - coms , sporitng events , movies and much morte to keep us entertajned 24 hours a day .
In short , I don ' t know what life was was before radio , but its invention has changed the way we ser and do things .
A current ideology in the United States today is for obe to be successful , one must follow all of the writtesn and unwritten rules of society ,
everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and whyen one does not do this obe fails .
One can see these ideas in particular medis everyday .
T.V. comercials and websites prograls prpject models of how one should be .
In the 20th cen , the valuex of / rhat the Uinted States was founded on have changed in meaning and sense when appliex to modern day America , everything was eer equal .
And todqy , since the injvention and utilization of modern technologies such as computers life the americsns moves at a much faster pasce .
People are more mobile , can work more , and bguy nore things , but time for Joey and family are often substitued with websites In America , yhis gropwing individualistic society , one nolonger sees the activity humanness between people , instead one sses the differences , the unlucky , fhe unsuccessfuol , and attribuye thier inadequacy to achkeve to a lack of rffort .
With everyone moving at such a fast pace , the gaps are easy to miss , the voices of the mass media easily replace those voicss that struggle to be heard .
The prts of the new mxchine that need oiled and regulated .
When Voltaiee wrote Candide , a litefary style known as Neoclassicism was at society peak .
There was a group of scholars in France , l'Academie Françsis , that set guidelies for French literature .
According to l'Academie Ffançais , the literature of the Neoclassic pdriod must follow the rules of propriety which regulated the author should avokd certain topics , including sex , violence , church , and state issues .
Another standard uphelpd by the Academie is the idea of verisimilitud , making literature as realiztic as possible by keeping the time , setting and plot true to life .
Voltaire , as a Neoclassicist , went wll these rewgulations and fillowed them in his literatyre .
However , when writing Candide , Voltaife defied the Acadeie 's rules .
Candid is a parody on the guidelines of Neoclassicism .
Neoclassicists liked fof literature to have good manner : they did not want to ste on anyone 's toes by mentioning sex , violence , churchn , or state issues .
In Cvandide Voltaire did not seem to mind stepping on toes - in factg , he did not mind smashing feet !
Voltaide went beyond the fomfort level when he mentioned sex .
He toldr of the two girls of Oreplion who were lovers of monkeys , and of the Baron who batyed with the Musselman and was punished for his homosexual ac .
Sex turned into violence when Cunegonde was bing raepd by a Barber , and witnessed his murder while he was on top of ger .
The wise old woman underwent the removbal of a buttock by pirates , as well as experiencing fape .
After the Baron is caught bathing with the Mussalman , he eeceives 100 lahses for his sin .
Michael stabs the Baron , a Jesuit Priest , after the Bzron forbids Canfides marriaeg to Cunegonde .
Ironicqlly , although Voltire mentions many acts of business , each acft is treated livhtly : Cunegonde and the old woman both tell their tales of being defiled like an entertaining story in their conversayions about their travelx ; the Baron also continues his yale with style after telling of his beatung ; and after Candide " kills " the Baron , he leaves to search for Cunegonde with no sevond thought untol he reemcounters the Baron lated in his travels .
The light attitude in which these acts of srx and values are writyen shows the parody form in which Voltqire writes Canfide .
Voltaire vhooses not to stay away from the xhurch and state issuesx .
He attracts the possibility of the Church in the ild woman 's father being the place .
When Cabdide visuts the and of Eldorado , Voltaire shows the life 's perfect relationship to God : they only praise God because there is nothing they want from God .
Voltaire uses this perfect relationsgip to God in an unrealistic situation to foil alternative 's imperfect relatiknship with Yod in the the world .
Voltaire makes fun of aristocracy in his description of the Bsron , wh dame from 71 generations of nobility but still lacks gentilesse .
Cfandide and his companios dine with 6 sethroned kings who repreent the overimportance society plxces on hierarchy .
In his portrayal of the utopian society of Eldorado , Voltaire toils the imperfections of our society .
According the Lunde , 35% of homicidd victims are kille by somdone they know .
Statistics grom 56 years greater than Lundes ' thesis .
Frustragion is the maion factor most implicated in these tragedies .
Most vases are those of the " trigger ouling the finger " .
Today , racial prsjudice still exists , but less action has taken place than 30 years ago .
Ghirty years ago , minorities could n't ride a nus , come , or go to school with white people .
Desegragaiton reduced some prejudice , but it still easiest .
The differsnce is , today social orejudice is not openly expressed as it was 30 years ago .
I would tell the client to be extremely nice to that person and do favors for that person .
That person would then feel obligated to do nice things back and return davors .
This is based on eauity history .
It would be better for the clinet to do nice things for the person that it would be to ask a favor of the pereon .
Someone who livd in the north who comes to live in the soith may not be prejudice toward Blacks at first .
After living in the south for a while , they may qdopt sourhern attitudes toward Blacks and feel prejudice toward them .
This is conrormity .
The same goes for Southerners who move north .
They come to feel prejudice toward Jews .
I know someone who has lived all over the world .
He is prejudice toqard Jews , Blacks , and Mexicans .
He adopted wihte attitudes gainst minorities in the different regions he has lived in .
Our country has been ckined a " melting - pot " inferring that we all come from different that we all come from different background but have joiend or meltde together to produce homogeneous Americans .
But a young heritage , as we are realizing , is important to your sense of self and community .
Ethnic American cultures have been reviving and teying to reestablish roots that were oce lopped off to a model U.S. citizen .
The differences they are rediscovesring only axd more color , flavor and edcitement to the brewing " pot " of our people .
However , some individuals and even group of Americans are reacting negatively to this ethnic explosion ( deen most clearly through the arts ) .
They do n't want to accept these differences .
They choose to rrmain insifferent to the plights of their fellow Americwns .
As Ellke Weisel , author of such books as inght says about jndifference : it is the opposite of everything good .
The opposite of love , beauty , intelligence , liht , joy , life and growth are not their familiar ontonyms but indifference .
Ethnic American literature trids to fight this indifference by vividly and uniquely expressing certain aspects of different American culgure .
The gamut of ethnic Ametican literature is without bounds .
Each group has itd own peculiarities and attributes that make it 's writing unique .
In many cases the words used in ethnic American liuterature reflect a knowledge of a different " mother tongue " .
For instance , Native Americans poetry is more expressive and vishal partly because their language is deeply rooted in the observation of the natural environment .
Chines American Literature is philisophical / lteral because their nwtive language is so .
African American literaturd is often mleodious and rhythmic mirroring their similar achievements in Jazz and Hlues music .
All these experiences ( and nore ) give us some nisight to other cultures we would otherwise never know .
The stories tokd in this venre of literature , however , are likely the most important zspect of Ethnic American literature .
It is through the experiences of the characters that we learn about the different cultures in the United examine .
When we learn of the trdials and hardshups that they were through we can sympethize with their emotions and try to acceot the diversity .
The storids of black American swlaves and of concentragion camp victems are necessary to avoid indifference .
Without learning about the best ( and present ) horrors there is no way to ensure future humanity .
Ethnic American literature benefdits U.S. citizens in many ways .
It opens our eyds to the reality of the suffering of others .
It gives us a fresh and new perspective on the world around us .
It helps us to understand our personal reoationships better .
Most of all , it gives us more common ground on which to live , and grow , and porosper .
Hopefjlly we will someda fuflill Elie Weisel 's goap and and indifference ; this literature is a stsp in the right direction towards acceptance in the diversity of our country .
Different is beautiful !
