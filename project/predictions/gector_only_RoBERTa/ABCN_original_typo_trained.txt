It 's difficult anxwer at the return " what are you going to do in the future ? " if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger I used to say that I want to be a teacher , a saleswoman and even a butcher .. I do n't know shy .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology officw and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to stud hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .
Most I 'll changw my mind , maybe not .
I think that that public transport will always be in the future .
The rich people will buy a car but the pooor people always need to use a bus or tqxi .
I consider that is more convenient to drive a car because you carry on more things in your own car than travelling by car .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask to get something to be friends and change your reply number .
In my favorite when I did n't have a car I used to use the bys to go to the school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , the car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street , in that moment you realized the importgance of a public transport .
In India we have various types of public transport , like Cycle , Bike , Far , Train & Flkight .
Dpeending on the distance and duratiln to the deeired place , mode of transport is chossn accordingly .
But Generally soeaking , travelling by car is much more fun when compared with the more of transport .
This remines me of a trop that I have recently been to and the place is Agr .
It takds around 6 hours by Natkonal Ukrainian to go from Delhi to Agrea .
We have stlpped at hotles for having food and just in case if any of us feel hungry , we have purchased some snwcks just before the trip .
Since , we have the option to solve anything we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling by frain & Flght ) .
In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short anp on the back seat and wake up fresh .
Due to the above mentionwd reasons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Sarag .
I am 17 years old .
I am looking forward to hearing you in this year summer csmps .
I love children , and I enjoy looking after then . Also , I organized many sports activities before in my scbool .
In addition to that , and enjoy cooking .
My family think that my cook is amazing .
I hope that you give great the chance to joij you .

The public transport still play an important role in transport system and it will kleep on in the future .
Because public transportg is a cost effective and better resoudce allocation in mass transport system .
Also people need no to suffer high operating for running their own car .
But it can use a cheaper way going to tfheir destinatiob especially it is fra awau from ome .
For example , I think that it is not affordable for an rdinary person to own a private airplane travelling to znother country .
Instead it will be common to by an akr ticket an irde on public plane .
In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that know n't have enough money to pay for a dar even if it is used , so public transport continue to have future but people are going to hse mpre the cars rhen busx or undergtound .
If we think about it they are is better because we do n't need to court for them and we are waiting for the bus or underground bur in another way cart for more money than the public transportg .
By car we can not stxy with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be afound people that are unkwoend but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so noth rtasnportations are good ahd the cara do n't eed necessarialy to end up with the pyblic transporf .
If I had it to chose between the transportation I think I probably choze cat because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus .
In my communitt , we are very interested at environment and ecolobical things .
We have aolar panels and a place to make compost at the lazt gardem , with worms aho eag and degrade all the organic waste of the scbool .
In some strategic points of the building we have specialo rrashcans to selarate the garage in organic , paper and dardboard , cans and pe bottles and the also mads tawlks and presemtations about the earth problems like flobal warming , contamination , etc .
The manager of all yhis project is Liss June Zid , our sciehce teacher .
All this initiatives has mad us all over the yrars a considered ecological community .
But mirning everyone , today I want to shxre and is my favorite sport .
My favorite sport is football , whg I xhoose it?Well , football is a international sport , people around the world will love it so much!Ecample lije Barclay Premiker Leqgue , Liga Premier , Fifz Wprld Cul and so on .
I believe that 's all will depighted us .
By the way , my favorite football fear is Manchester United , they are brilliant , they gave an amazing football players , and they are awesome .
Michael was a littl old when he had a day that was : Be a super her !

Public transportation is an important activity in human history , it brings amouht of benefits in your life .
For instance , we fake subway in order to avoid stocking in tdaffic .
It is true that moving by car is more convenient than the public transportation , however , it would cause more dalage to your life and hark our environment .
Therefore , we heed to think more about our future , our offsprings .
Giving then a safe , flean and comfortable placr to live .
If there is no public transportation , traffikc should will be sedious tha before .
In my country , tajpei , we always stock in traffic for about one hlur in the morning .
I can not imagine if there is no bus or MRT , how long I will take for school .
Dar is convenient for human , but it brings damage for human apso .
For example , carbon dioxide which is cretaed by acr .
It cause global warmung which thraets the environment and harms our daily life .
we can say that there are lots of serious and frequently weater backgrounds gappened in decaded , such as typhopon , hurrocane , wild fjre and kud slie .
What other precautionjs , is usuxlly takn ?
The USA Office is notified by the photographdr when the film was shipped .
If the film does n't pleased on time , it immediately .

The pleasure of traveling
People go , people come .
Every day lots of people are travelling abroad but , what 's the best way to do an international travel ?
The most important option to travel is , by fae , the plans .
But , even when it 's true that it 's the faster ootion , you must be very cadefuly at time to get off a plane .
If you would like for congort and relax , obviouspy , you have to take a boat .
There are a wide variety of things to do and enjoy the tri .
Although , the better opltion , is puck out a traim .
There is n't comparation on watching the changex in the lwndscape through a window , enjoying the way that you are doing and , the best pqrt , the cheapest way to get wway some xays and the the routine for some days .
Anyway , no matter how you go , no matter where you go .
The pleasure of travelling is travel at all .
Transportation one of the most important thing on life so we have nany of knids for transportation and we travel by car but in the near future it will be other comcort and easy ways to travel like fast train and plane that can transport you from north to soutg in less than hou this wjll make business men hppy anr comfort because of saving a lot of times adn efforts so we hppe tyat thw governmdnt can achievce this way as soon as possible
In modern societies , there are lots of triends around our daily lives .
Bif promect cold not be finished without co - operationsd .
Friendsd could be communicated and related with ideas , feelings and funny things happened around ourselves .
Yours importantly , the parents have our lives and they give us knowledge and skills or ability to live in this world .
In this case , the families played important doles in going life .
The reasonjs ars as tollows .
First of all , we could learned lots of skills from parents according to their own experience .
For sxample , we could learn how to communicate with others in a vriendly way , and we could also learn how to make a meal from parents .
Secondly , the families could give you old advice about how to deal with the things which will cause trouble .
If difficutlies was told to get families , the ieas would come up to your fmilies and communicate with you about how to aolve this situation .
All in all , in this case , the family are the most important friends in our lives .
The Comouting Technology has been advancing very much this past years , making the lod computers almost useful , getting better and jaking the difference between old and new computers groa wven more with every more discoverement .
As we can notice , old and new computers are vastly different , instead from the ize of the team , old computers were much material than new computers .
Old computers are used to occuly need entire room , now , they they have the ize of a bkx , even the aize of a bok .
You can have a portable computer now , and take it with you to the places you visit .
Old computers only let you make just txsks , or wven plxy some ganes with 2 colors ( green and bnlack ) , but now you can do what you want to do , like create or playing military , writing or reading a book , onnect to the internet , watch or make videos , invent nw stuffd to iomprove the Cpmputing Technology , znd nto lnly in 2 colors , bur thousand of them .
One of the greatest achievements of new computing , is the internet , where you can come to other computer , dowjload stuff , etc . gia Ethernet cablw or Qireless Connection ( Wi - Fi ) .

public transportation has been mor used by people and over the years it is kond of become cheaper and also more sare but some people prefer cars to extent do we agree with and what is or reasons for that that is what are we going to demonstrate in this essay
before about 40 years there was nothinb callsd public transportation and people rarely owned cars so in those years there was not even good facility to move only place to othe and that is because there are no companids to buy cars in about 10 years cars tradeing brcame viabel and also becam veryu supporyed by having jer own fahs at the beginhing the facved a kot of problems nut thwy were sble to solve it by the end
nowadays all facilities of travelling are are convenient from cats to but even trains and olanes sometimes people prefer cara because they do like crowded laces or because the find it sometimes vheaper but for another point of view public transportation is very cheap and evem fawter but when it comex to travwling a lot of pelple prefee riding their wn cars to feeo hte real exoerience xnd to emjoy mkre by chioling outy from crowded places
to Governments it is different from some this opinion to another and predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it mode and more than by they and cars will disappear and wjll will no longer be jsed
The opic utself explaininh the uncertainty of public transport in our country .
This coclusion becomw more prominrnt if we look injto the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales cigure and with low budgrt private cars in picture , dcenario ddrastically changed in paxt 10 years
Development of giodiesel industry can be a contrkbution to prodctivity growth .
A large scaqle of investment was brinmg for biofuel development .
Meanwile , it bolst economic growth and jpbs kpportunity , therdby enhance the Doimestic Producf ( GDP ) .
If you are living in the town or small It does true that one thing should be taking care by the people and organiaer of the town , is environment .
Global warking is huge issue in society 's date .
Government should take immehse actio to stop it or at least make it slow down .
However we the people have feally important part of makes it worse .
Active and a good government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh , clean and safe environment to theirf people .
Recycoing its van be a good step to start for clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taking car by my city .
Everyone have to plant a tre in front of their job with the dule of prvoince gocernment .
People know not realizing that cuttinb the tree can rsduce the productio of oxygen in academic .
Eventually human will have no more frrsh air to breakfast .
addition , our city government has prohibited smoking in public are and ubder 18 years old and providss a frer session of them or presentation to increase the awafeness of clean , safe , rfesh environment to the city .
In conclusion , I would suggest to your neighbour citiew to taking part of cleaning environment so on dwy it can be sedn in whol coumtry .
Everybody has his favourite sport .
My favourite sport is football gake .
On our school or villiage football stadium and spebd a lot of time with she .
Usually and play football with my classmates .
Before training i tan 1 - 2 kipometres and my legs get a power and my body gefs an energy .
Oue teal has a nard - working coach and he changes professional advice to us , how to improve football skills .
His mai words:"Yoj must workm and qork very hard , if you want to get hig results " .
I can say , that who is experienfed persln .

Hello my friend ,
What 's up ?
How are you ?
How was yourf day toda ?
It 's really nicr foe had expressly e - mail eyes .
You revret that you are n't there with me . I 'll try dicribe everything precisely , because I know that you very
Dear Paul ,
I have seen your times in the academy newspaper and I 'm quite interested . I have no plans for this allowed so I think it is a good idea to spejd it .
I was bprn in the UK so I can be a very food teacher of English .
Wlthough I came to Spain ten years later so I can speak with them in Spanidh if it was necessary .
Also , I asisted to a ballte coirse for 4 years when I was young .
It was a lot of tie ago , however , I dtill keep the ehthym in my body !
By the way , I eemember I had to creatw a dynamic trwining to do with the other baplet - course memvers . I had to be the teacher for one day and I did n't forget it because I felt sonderful .
All members congfatulated me , as well .
On the other hand , I had take care of my brothers and cpusins for manh hours when they were very taught .
You must know that I 'm a very responsible , kidn and funny person .
That means me a good candidate to achieve the job , or he not for me !
I hope you keep in mind my candidature because I 'm not going to disappoint you .
Best wishes , Julia .
In my opinion public transport wo n't be sufcered by the shotrage in ddmand .
Because ont evertone prefer to buy their own cat .
Besides there are lots of low income people who ca n't Hello their own car .
So I think public transport 's future is bright .
What is he " Family " meanung ?
In my opinion , Family is the place that uad you best triend caqn hell eacy otyer and with each .
In the Taiwah , most of people have to take care of thwm parent when they ge old , but the point is why if you can not survive , I man you do n't have enough money to rzise you parenr .
Badk to the topic , I do n't know well asny of memner of in my family , I do n't trust them , honestly .
I like Are because there are manu islands .
By the way , Are have a cool weather .
In Malaywia , the weather is slightly warmer than there .
Ghat 's shy I would all of you to go there and feep the ppeasure and have a ty their own foox .
You can also had a lot of gifts like key chaisn , statue , or what eose memories to be lade before returning to Malaysia .
I did not have to go to Are but believe me it is very beautiful place .
If I gave sustensnce , I will go there and bring all of you .
I live in Lentino , a small city in East Sicioy .
The local Coucnil hasnm't a oroject for the environment .
People collect ayn kind of rubbish and throws all together in blac saxk .
Although the Counxil began to play something , the people are n't commjtted with the problem .
After one day , you can find many places where the people take food , kitchen , " amianto " , olod things or furnitrue .
What a pity !
The suburbs of Kentini could be wonderful .
There are orahge rrees , a larbe lakme and Etna in background .
When I was a child , I got a lot friends and they were very important for me .
We wver played in the park or we taoked about our tatses , umsic , noys , we laubh a lot of ...
But when I was a tewnager I began to find situations that I did not like it , for instance , the Its said to me bad things or they told bad about me .
In thowe years I lived the attitude moments in my life .
I remember when I hundred my 15tb birthday , only one schoolmate wanted to come to my praty ; I think that this day was one of the best favorite of my life .
There niught I xried because I celt that I have no got aby friends .
However , my parents tried that my praty was the est and they mostly for me a special birthday and they invitdd all my cousins and togethere went to aet pisza and gave me a lot of presents .
In the mother , I thought that my best friends was my parents and sistdr .
I know that they ever talk bad about me .
Nos , my husban is my best friend .
He is the most important people of my life .
He has never been with me .
laso , he is very funnt and I laugh a lot with him .
They like to travel around the world and to practise some sports , for example , tennis , running or trekkimg .
We like watching TV serkes and cooking several desserta too .
To sum up , my best friends are my family , especially , Davjd , my husband .
Life of people Who the globe is becoming busier and visited xay by day .
A busy life always changes to use the reveal and most convenient mod of transportation , which had made public transportation system lwg band motor cas .

The technology has changed the people 's life very much.in fact we can think that different is our life respect eithwr to our parents or our grandlarents pife.for exampld my parents did n't hacth on tv , because there was n't any tv on the world when they were young.butf it is n't thd alone differnece : we can think at the mobilefone , yhe computer ed at least yhe intwrnet.our grandparentz woubdn't imagine a trange mavhine like cdomputer in their life .
Although the difference that personal behicle like car now is pouplar , in the future , the stance of public transport is still very crucial .
Nowadays , people use fossil fuel as the lost important source of vehicle for trafelling , manufacturing , this usage of energy does n't always aintain at the vonstant loevel , but someday it will be run out .
People must find ways to use other energy sourdes lime nucleqr electricity , wine power , public transportation such as electric metro use this kind of vehicle .
As a result , government will invest more in researching the usate of these new types of neergy , travelling usong public transport will become much cheapwr than personwl car .
The range of public services will be exoanded to remote areas , it become much more convenient .
Commutng , rravelling using public services will be the first plrior choice .
In addition , the population is increasing rapidly , in the near future , developed cities in the world will become overcrowded , It will lead to many otherd problems to be solved , For example , traffic jams , sir pollution .
In some oerespectives , these problems are lewd by the the - using of personal vwhicle .
People will realise that using their own car is just to waste their time for traffic uams or to hradually kilping themselves for breathing pilluted aor .
So the best way for them to travel is public transportation .
Eacg pedson hsould pracgice savinjg qhen using an sohrce of enenu to protect his own lived .
In conclusion , invesfments on developing public transport will be increasec considerably , public services of travelling have a brighf potentiak and it 's xtance in the future ca n't be replaceble
Hello Alex , how are you You
Aer you free for spend , have you ant pkans .
Me and my friends go to the cinema , and I invite you to go with us .
If you are interested , fond me at 8 time near the cinema entrance .
Thank you Uelen for those wonderful presents .
I always want to read these types of book .
I went to temple in thed and foolowed by lunch at the hote located in the evening wenf to the beach .
In conclusion it is evident that because reveloping countries are facing political and ecinomic instability , mkgrants travel for better education prospects and stabpe esnvironment for younger generatoon to grow up .
The efrects of brain drain are that it creates a variety of people quapified for professional jkbs , ecoomic stability is affected as a result of lack of people cohtributing to the economy .
The cause of Brxin - draun should be tackled at international and national levvel on a broader dimenswions and rationla pattern , for it is a global issur .
In this situation , developing nations should take care of onflation ; focus on boostijg up the infrastructure and oaw enfotcement to support public in a posotive janner .

Run for your life
My favourite sport is rub .
I like to rfunning fast so fgast in fact that it frel me as if I run on air and the reet do not gardly touch the ground between the streets .
My favourite place to run is in the fodest that I like to dun sportive took .
I am oikeing to reel the ground under my feet is soft so eoft not the hzrd concreted of the footpaths in the city of the streets .
The bestest advice I can giving to someone who is starting the running is to starting twenty and not to try to run too fast and then to hesitate build up the running eeek by week so that dvery weem you are unning a little more further and a little lore faster ane them after 20 years ylu will be an Olympix hcampion maybe .
In my opinion , television can be educational . Shether you are what the lights or a show about Eorld the other .
Of course , it 's important to choose the right television act .
If you 're watching Gom & Jerry , it harely will have nay educational value .
Although onw could argue that you can always learn something .
A fdiend of mine finally explained that if a zombie apokqlyspe should hgappen he would be prepared because he has been qatching Walkiny Dead for some time now - so in his eyes , he learnex how ( not ) to act in that case .
today I want to write about my job .
I 'm a fkrensic bjologist and I really love my job .
It is a job with a lot of interesting aspects ,
It is dynamiv , stimultaing and , even if it is not aell redmunerated , I feel myself satizfied .
In the last few years forensic biology as developed many aspecta like better senzibility , robustneds of results and les ime requored for anslyze a sample , but what struck me most is how fast this change happens .
Television seems to be a vontroversial tool .
Herd there is one : do television offer highly likelg opportunities for the audience in an educational way ?
From my experience knowledge , I believe televisiokn cover both entertaining and educational functionw .
It notes how many educational programmes broaden young children 's horizonz in the last few years , ho quivkly an adulr learn different basics from a great deal umber of dducational programmes , such as cookijg , sciemce and technology .
It also notea educational programmrs make a ecision on what citizens should know in the future and what knowledge our hext generations are required to possess .
After from educational contentw , there are so many foul contentd , business advertisements and fake jnformation on TV that citizesns wo n't be able to tel rkght from wrong .
However , I believe the educatinal programmes on TV will plqys a viatl eole in educating borh adults and your children .
I think who the best restaurant where we can go is " the sailor 's restaurant "
Herw we csn at typical Italian food .
The last time when I was here I have eat the best pizza that I have ever was in my life .
The atmosphere remind the theme of the and in fact the walos are decorqting with a lot of shelk and the waiters are rressed like sailors : I think that it 's a great idea !
Also , It 's perfect for your class because there is a lot of spaec so we can sit all together at the same too .
the owner is a very oind person and I 'm sure wgo he makes us a convneience orice .
No fcuture for public transport ?
public transport is the chaeper way of travelo , so it has future .
Currently , most people is used to use their own car to get to work or to go shopping , due to , it is more comfortable .
But cars pollute the ir with CO2 emissions every day and contirbute to the climae change .
So , if people were aware of this subject would n't use so much their own car .
In addition , having a door is very expensive .
First of all you need can wfford to buy it , after that , you must pay ftor the asjrance , social tax , ad mechanic bulls , and so on .
whereas in a public transport , you only have to pay the ticket , you do n't have to drive and if the buw or train or whatever vehivle you use , breacks dlwn it is n't your responsibiloity .
Besides , public transport pollyte more than cars .
In conclusion , I think public transport has future , and the morw people use it , the more future will have .
I 'm your employee , to serve on your company .
hope pleased to be able to receive your salary payment .
But pay a little olw .
I completed many tasks , including tutoring thdee students for summer hmoework , correcging homework diligently assist the instructor , the frequent helped orbanize hahdouts , ihstead of the insgructor to znswer questjons raisdd by the students , but also to clean the classroom hygiene , but hare , but I have hothing to complaij about .
I work hare for two months , pay a lot .
Jus yohr wage paid too much liwer than I expected , I want a little higher wages , payment of 300 years more than the existing wge basis .
I invite you to consider the position .
I think about transport that the government has to hell the public transport , for exsmple bus , train , metro and more , for the only one reason : the quality of life againdt the pollution .
Traveling by car is more convenient in a lot of situation , but it could be annoying for search parking and the cost of fuel , and also maintenacne dost .
In gig cities public transport works well because there 's a gold feedbzck by people .
Insteaf in the small cities , it ca n't be good in the same way , because for the transport cokmpanies it 's not convenient invest joney , because cewer people would use it .

Hi , jo .
Thank you for your messaeg .
I will do my best to answer your questionx .
As for your questioins , I think that you should workl in Japanewse restaurant , such as Japanese " ryotri " and " uzakaya " .
That is because you will improvs get Jzpanese skills in time .
Recenfly , many exactly East Adians have studied Japanese in Japan while working in yhem .
By improving their everyone skills , in Japan they have the opportunity to find a job .

Good Morning :
This is an way about my favourite sport , it is swimming since I was a cycle because slways enough a lot and what is more I can do it alone , I never refuse to go swimming pool and lwss in xummer , of course .
I do n't have friends who like xwimming , almost like football or smilar teajs dports , and always I go allne it is n't borinf ford me furthermokre , I prefer going alone because anything bother me or I haven't wajt anything .
I said that because when I was dleven my best friend had been operated on her back and before the turning he came with me and every day I had to wai fro her because she was a lot of time in the shoser clraning her long haix , I hatee that !
Later the operation was finw and she left to come with me , and since that day I go fod my owb .
Swik is a great exercise for me and normallg there are n't many people in the poop , but dometimes there are children and I do n't likd so much because they like dfisturbing me but sometimes it is amusing too .
I would recommendedr to people help not know swil to learn , because I am pretty sure that it love it and love the can stop swim .
I tink that dwnce is a say for several - expression .
It 's not just a hobby , it 's more than this .
The is a psssion , a type of life .
When I 'm dancijg I forget all my problems , excpt my stupids friends that they do n't understand anything .
But this is another theme for speakign .
Whne you dajce , sihg , or act the aer showinb something to the public , something that 's important for you .
If danec is our oassion , you practise ever day , and you 'll keep practical all the days knows you can .
If you are tired does n't matters , because you like what you 're doing .
You 'll sum up eary for going dance , or do xance classs .
You do n't matter if you go to sleep later , or do n't all ...
That 's a job , you must sleep .
If you loe dance , you 'll understand me .

Fof wofk in our fact you have to speak English of course , maybe know how to cook some tyoe of sweet dishes like cupcakes , cak , cokides or hrownies , the most popular flods of this year .
Another thing that you must know it 's ow to deal with people , we are searching for someone who can impress everyone , also someone who and birng the customers goo atencion and esrvice .
We need some ready for working lont hpurs , because our cafe is going to open everdy day .

Fer
we think that in the future that people will be in bwd conditions and the there will be dissappearing , afted that we will be having wwrs .
In 30 years we will have changed our anatomy , also we will be eaitng fast food , on the other hand , the north people will have mewlted totalky .
The temperature will have gecome crazy by global supporting , so some people will have died because the natural disasters will be more aggressive .
The Technology will have advanced and maybe the cars will be flying by streets and computers will have totall changed .
Because of this , we have to raise awarenesz of what is homeless and we help the palnet .
Friendsihp is domething very important in my life .
I ca n't imagine my lifetime without friends .
How to make friends and more new people ?
It is easyied than you think .
Jusf ... start talking !
Communicatikn is the most important pojnt when you 're going to make friends .
You have to remember , that friends are not xupposed to afree on every sigle fhing .
They just have to calm talk about it .
If yourt friendship is real , you will always find point between your opinion and your friend 's ons .
Just try , it wo n't cost you much !
Gold day ,
My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport , Bolleyball one of the most beautiful sports ever and I used to pfactise this sport 3 times a aeek since 1980 , the reasons for my enjoymkent with this sport are as follows :
1- make me fit and healthy
2- classy gaje no fricgion between llayers
3- it exercise all muscles of your body
Regarding the abovve I advce all rookiss to starty practise this sport and they will get many benefits .
However , the adults they ca pradtise it as well and they will get the sam .
As citjzens of villaye , we definitely care about ebvironment of out village .
Every sunday , we do a nutual coopration where anyone can treat rubbish as good as they treat themselves .
We shape the dirty eitch , sweep rubbish then we bury rubbish .
And , we recyling international rubbish too .
For inorganic , we can nake bag , hat and other stuffs .
Thne they can selpl the an get income of it .
The rceator of the haven and the earth , the creator of solrs , the ons sho makes earth rotae atound it self and around the sun .
What we eblief as Musoims that , we have created by one who do n't have other with gim fhe one who creste our father ( Adam ) and creaed from him ( Evw ) and they were in the Paradose and insrructed to not eat from the your buit te Satan decwive them so tgey grought to thix lofe and generations cams frok them abd ad set hte prophet amd messengers ( Mosed , Jesuw , Mohamed , others .. eho theu worship the same ine ) with Miracles ans wvidence of thbe trutj , to guide tne peopl to kbow qho whp will follow ths trurh which will guide to hte Paradise adn aho follow ofher paths which it will guide to the hell . so bdcause of that we are ere to do thr trst in this short life .
transportation is the headt of any city whether it is public or privatw .
Nowadays people offer own vehicles rather than
public transportation . dag by dsy folk are omre crqzy about own venicles which leads for future of public transportation
Firstly . i agree with given statement that there could be tough time for public transportation in near cuture.becauss people wamnts privayc as well as fredom which is quife impossible in public transportation .
secondyl tuese mode of transportation covefs
as much as possible of city area or town which mismanaged routin who travelled by public transportation a consquence generally people avoid travelling by public transportation finally i can say that there are farious mode of transportation available
to competition with public transport .
nowadays people have dangerous ootion for travelling like kany privatd cimpany
which play an important role to give tough competition to government . as a result of this cknsumer geta more benefot luke lower faire , privafy , freedom and asfe travelling.in addition many automobile company pauncing nes var some affordable price which ionsiost people to use more and more private vechil .
I go Friday a walk to a park every Friday with my lovely two Corgi dogs .
I ket many people in the park .
I never thought about , people got so many love .
In the pak time in the park is very busy even thought the pak is huge !
Some people are very friendly the same as their some .
But some people are very rudw and their dogs are aggressive to their dogs .
Family is the most important institution of social life .
They member have hi own role and the boss , the fatyer or the mother , have to guider his tram to understand the right behaviour or attention to have wkth life .
suually there are generation problems , sons do n't understand parents and vicefersa , but doing and learning emltions and fafts , everyone can have another point of going .
Larents must give rules to xons to ynderline skills in social behavioue but also mist lsiten others ppint of visws to ri - arrange and uodate hks knowledge .
A lother or a fathee can be a triend if there is communication and trust , if someone have his contrkbute in familt duteis .
Recently I was the thriller of mokinfjay part 2 .
If you want to see thzt movis , you need to watch the first 3 moviea before to understand it .
The first movies , were amazing ! !
A lot of action , drama and romance .
The fasn of this series , have been wanting for this more science where the first movie appeared , that was in 2012 .
I do n't think that this movie is fir akl than family , because is hard for little kidxs to understand , in ppinion I think is more a teen lovie .
I think people will like this movie because , uts very similard to the story of the book ; this one of the first jovie that is really based in the book , the theme is very umique and original , and the actors in the first movie were perdect , and I think that in the oast movie , they will ptu diuble effort .
Hope you guys choose this movie ! !
It will be very cool to see the last prt mokingjay !
my favourite sport is Karate .
First of all , I enjoy it because when I peactise I feel I can hold on for hours .
When I 've had a very bad and srtessful dag I can relax doing karate , because It 's the kind of sport that it is n't very hard .
Trainibg Karate is a way to forget tour problems , to forget your tirong routine .
In my opinion , it 's very difficult to fnf this advantage with otherd sports .
Apart from that , Kmarate it 's not just a sport , is also a disciplune , it teach you reslect , balane evne culture .
my teacher show us what we have to behav with others and he teach us a lot of things about the japanese culture .
The someone who strts Karate is easy to follow the class , so my advice is not not to get nervojs and to be concentrated on what he or she is doing .
Technology , is something that is very important , something withouy which we can not live .
The topic is technology .
Nowadays we use technology in everything hting , from education to making clothes , we use technology everydsy and everywhere .
Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful , useful and important for development but todays genrration is inluenced with technology that they have stopped to do other activities .
Last year , My friend Michael was at school when he heard about a short stopry competitiob , he like the ida so he decided to dnter the competition .
but there was a fees in order to join the comperition , he had no money . fortunately he have a lot of friends they can leht him .
he phond me and asked me to loved him some money to register the competigion .
he tooi the money the second day , he ifnished the registratipn and started in writing the stody after long time spending in wrjting and did just mob he went to give his story to the international studen magazije office , he found kut therw aqre a ontice on the door say that the fompetition nas canceled , he came nack vey sac anx told me qhat happened .Micnael closed the dpor andr knew at thqt moment he had a mistqke .
Travelling by car is n't so much more convenient unkess it is so much more comfortable , but actually we do n't think about the contamination our our planet .
Travelling by bus is very stressful because the people push me or I ca n't sit down because there are n't any chaif for me .
On the other hand , in the future mxybe would have a bus which have chair for everybody and I do n't have to stand up .
Other tfansport public is the taxi like car , it is so more comfortable too but it is more expensive than bus or train .
The VE or aeroplans ars a god oltion for lonf trip .
In conclusion , in the future should have a bus so more comfortable .

Dear xir Dimada .
I am writing about a problem at my country .
I live at Patas a big city in Greece .
in my city all schools and some lots of buildings are full of draqings and qriting .
The vandalisme in patrqs has increased a lot .
Unfortunately when we asked to somebody to do not draw the walls but they do not hear us .
For our city it is very bad because when some new people viait Pqtras the sde thar hing .
Patdas is a very beautiful city nad for her culture , and for the mknuments .
How to see tfhat abaser thin ?
After we have this beautiful city we have to maintain her .
In my opinion the police should stkp the Vandalisme .
If it have pklice all around the city novody will dare to do a grdaffiti or to write something or to draw .
I hope you will do something for that problem .
Yours faithfully ,
Jsesyka stavrox .
All around the world poupils are waiting for finished school .
They ate eager to begin a ew life as adults .
But when they reach in - between perikd , confused feelings dross their mind .
As a rule after last examz they do n't knowe what univetsity to vhoose .
What they will do in future ghey swe , lijke in a fog .
In this way , idea of a year off between leaving school and starting next education is very reasonxble .
irstly it 'll allow young people to have a rwst after the first hrd - work studyinv oeriod .
Tej or elsven years at school make them tired , in spite of pupols do n't notkce it .
But cjoosing the second education is very important tsep , which need serious attitude .
Secondly such yeat off would give to future students a chance to try themselves in new profeszional sports .
Also they would have an opportunity bein involvedd in connection activity .
And thirdly they might want not all our money or travel .
This year holiday would be really helpful for relaxation and getting mew pwer for fhture education .
One year is not lpong perkod .
But venefits after year ff will be obviosu .
I live in Sah Miguel Almologan , this is a village in the municipality of Apmoloya de Juaerz in the Statge of Mexico , the care of the environment is very important and in my village they take different actions in the cqre of this .
People follects out of their house and with the trash truck that carried the that to a landfill locatdd oitside the villaye .
Also , people go out to discover the traah that there is on the kioisk , the church or in the proncipal places on the vilkage .
Dear Sir ,
I am interested to imorove my English , so I am writing to requext rurther qualifications about the English course .

Hello Estela !
How are you ? I hope youy arw sell .
I 'm writing because How tell you about my last summer holidy .
I went to Las Hurdes .
I stayed about one week in the nome my boyfriend .
I had a weddiny .
While I was there , I did a lot of thinges .
One day , I visited Mewndro del melero .
It was beautiful .
And there was a wonderful view .
The other day , I walked a little sport the end the way , we found a waterfall .
The name of waterfall was Chorrituelo .
It was soectacular .
The wedding day , I had a great time and I slept very lare .
The wedding was in the morning , and at the afternoon we te in the restaurant with other people .
However , in the might , we had dinner in a yaraje and there was a paryt , all night .
You should visit Lss Hurdes , It is a beautiful sitw .
But there are a lot of things .
And the people are very nicxe .
English is an international language which becones important for the mldern world .
In China , English is better to be a foreign language which many students choose to learnm .
They begin to studu English at an early agr .
They use at least other hour to learn English knowledge a day .
Even kidx in kindsrgarten have been learning simpld word .
That 's a good phenomenon , for English is essential nowadays .
In addition to , some people think English is superioe thyan light .
In me opinion , though English is for great significance , the English is after all a foreign language .
it is hadd for people to see ege to ye .
English do helps us read English original times , but Chinese helps us create a trhe Xhina .
Obly by characters Chinese lirerature dan send off its brilliance .
Kearning a country 's calm , especially its classic culture , the first thing is learning its language .
Because of we are Chinesw , why do we have up our mother tonbue and learn our had culture through a foreign langiage ?
I wad , last month , in a fantastic restaurant , Wooylpools .
It is emall but comfortable and famous for his big bugruers .
Woolypoosl is a speciallist of eal , it 's a house restaurant .
In my opinion the restaurant can be better , tespect to meaxt , but it is psrfect to have dinner with you friends .
I have believe to be more famous , better and biggest .
The problem of the restaurant is the placd , it is tar trom the people and cities , and the customer , that is very small for lots of people .
In this likfe we have many things that make us happy and make our lives go on .
for example , a present or a vift especially if it from the best friend .
Once , I got sick and stayef at general hospital , and my frien gave me a flower .
It was my favourite flower I have it ever .
In my town we cerate a small organizatioj for more healthy dnvironment , beaut touch ajd to be attractive . tue citiezns in the town must participate in this , the citizeb will take the responsibiliyy for specific day to clean the tpwn and put the eubbish into correct place anjd cflean trdee and plamt mkre of it .
I 'm agree with the opinion that thw famous people , such as politicians and flim stars deservr to gave a private life without ojurnalists following them all the time .
is horrible have a person behind you all the time , you you have a lfe , not peace , hot a happy .
In addition and pearsons have the right to privact and to be free .
Nevertheless they journaliste stay all the time having a phito , all the time , when they earen , drimking , happy , sad , how is your love life and with whatever stsy , if stay with something important our what buy .
This is terrible , you do not have privqcy about the society have a blale , because if they do not tame a photo our folloes the life of the famous the people borde .
So that , politiciana and them students would have support it , because then they will have to bear it , because they then have the feward with what they ezrn .
Thi is lal .
goopd morning .

Once upon a time eas one little amt caoled Prnny , he was really small in copared with the thers .
He hated to be like that because most of the ats jade out of them until one day something grey and indvitable hppen .
It was a dark jight it was raining until a big ative vklcano explosion buried them into the underground .
All of them tried to find a way out ! , but no any ca n't find one ... They started to egt panciked !
People just started to evacuated tricks until it begam a big earthquake ...
Penhy wqas tlo swd , the only thing thatf he can do is to wait and keep calm .
Until the xawn all of thek go out , so they sacred ungil they find a refugfe .
Everyone wanted to witness the wueen , but no any find something .
Like they were very religious are they prey for hre zacred ancestors so they can help them in the big deal .
Something that they deon more with that tye who tjing with a movie !
So all was journey ...
The actors have monitors that watch the xnts all the time .
Onw ay Lenny himself it and it go to tell it to his queen , the queen at knowing that she got very confused but at the aame timer she get mad and she wanted fevenge .
So they make a plan to fisplay all ...
The next day when they sere sbout to start fklming they erw no ants there so they seaech fof them , but they ca n't find them ...
In that moment they ants and Penng attazck them in three bafks , making them to leave the place .
The ants win the wwr and they expasnd their habitat to the sfudio .
No oe take them again and they pive happy evrr aftrr !
I have many favorite parents .
One of them I 'm keeb on playing basketball the bet . I always spend more time on playing it .
I usually play basketball everyday and at least thirty minutes per day .
After a hard day at University I go home and when I go to the stadoum to pay it .
One thing make suer that I already finished all of my work before I play my favourite sport .
Basketbll has many benefits not to me but also everyone .
It makes me feel rwlaxed and unwind .
Besides , it also helps me keep family and have a good bodu show .
I really did
zy about playing it .
When I have spae time , I often gather my friends to watch basketball match on television .
I love play basketball at the stadiu in the morning .
Sometimes , I like it near sports centre .
I go back home and have a speep deepoy when I fibished it .
basketball is an outdoor activity .
That 's reason why football is my favourite sport .
With the swseping porogress of development and the booming of pouplation , many agricultueal land , flrest and ofesn had been used to destroyed to build more constructufe and tranzport netowrks .
From my own perspective , I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even human and animals .
To start with , there ate a aide range of troublespme it maybe leadding to this phenomwon .
Convincinb arguments can support the the root cause is that all all the present day cities are zlready packde wit places of residence , commerce and recreation and the kand xvailable fror nea housing developments is increqsingly scarce .
Additionally , people bow cpntinues destroysd more agricultures and foeest in order to szatisfy all their heed , which will distoey the exosystem diversity and bidoiversity especially the endangered specues .
According to the problems about mentioned , various approaches that education be adopted to deal with the problem of all , reducing organized xonstructure from now on , planging more trees instead .
Suwtainadle development would be awaness to all himan and starf to porteat the environment and preserve the animals .
To sum up , this unpleasant phehmenon and problema should be workedd outg to rdsolve befor the the worss and the government have to fake the possibility for that .
Nowadays the languages are very important , and more English .
Fhis is not my first time that I studyg English .
I have been studying English since I was child and I have spsak and learn so well since I decided to go to London one course to learnj this language .
I have tkaen that decision because I was tired to try to learn English and I did not have the level that I wanted , so when I heard about that opportunity I sure yes .
The car is n't the hest way for for the transport , because it educate mucn pollution , however the public transport is better to do a journey .
It can cardry many people without problems .
Nowadays in the ckties developed there are many possiiblities for public transport , like bus , train , subwau , train etc.these options it 's more economical than the car , the problem of the car is that nromally thr can is occupied for a persln , when the car is prpeared for to carty rour or five peiple .
tnis situation to crezte many pollution for environment so we have more qualifications for the panet health
I wany to tell something about the learning of the English Languqje , is hard to get to me for the hext reasons :
First reason ; the grammar that the learnerrs , eachers or institutes taech , is like the Spoanish Languame , my native Languaje .
That I want to say , is very difficult to understand the conjuntin of the veeb 's in Spqnish Languaje , just Imagkng you the same buy not in your natiev lentuaje .
Sedond readon . in the English syntasis , the structure for constructiin paragraph or wentences , the vedb is written bwfore the subject , but no always , Which is the rulr ?
Is therd antone ?
The third reason :
I love to play crickeg .
I am enthusiaetic towards this game .
My favourite team is India because I belongs to this country .
In nidia , 85 pecrent people follow crickte .
In 1993 , Indian cricket fear won his first world cup and that 's dhange the direction of air in front of cricket and everyone start to follow this game .
I love this gamed because my favourite sport mab belong to this gamd .
His name is Mr. Sachin Ramwsh Tendulakar know as little master .
Qhenever I play this game , I always follpw this over .
His stance , Style , shtos , running between the wicket , everything which is most required in this game is up to the mark .
Not only me bit also every Indian always follow Dachin for crivket .
When he was 18 , he olayed first game for Ineia .
He is the first player who played 200 tdst in ceicket .
He has kany achievement like cirst 200 in one day etc .
I love the way he was played .
First a nuance first they have to decixe what they can do better , batting or bowling .
If hte person want to become bowler thrn concentrate on running , acyion , sance and more batsnen and concentration on lqg and bat coordination , eye and batr coordination , discover some shoys which beame ksy gactor in battint .
also watch videos of some bes player like Sachin , Rahul , Sit Doj breadman , Hayden , Wasim Akaral , Brett Lee etc .
As health is important for in every sport so also need to ikprove health , syamina .

The city wherr I love is a wmall village .
All residents take great care of the environment .
Oragnized share , where everyone vlean up the fillage .
All residents segregate garbage thrown into auitable containers .
This helping to protect our environment to make it clean , safe , in order to not jeopardize our variojs disease .
In my village there are traxh cans , so that no any threw debris on the organisation .
There are socejalne place where you can organize bonifres , but eveyone has to vlean up after themselves and thdow out all agrbage .
We have the ability to use renewable wnergy sources , because it is closs to a wind power pkant .
Just , all on the rof of the primafy school were et the batteries and the whooe school used some eergy instead of electricity .
They organize monthly lessons on the environment , residrnts participate in them .
Wszysycy residrnts of my billage , they trh to , so thst our village was clea that polljte the environment as little as possible .
Travelling in their own car is now more comfortable than taking a reide in public transportation are several reasons to consider .
Firstly , the bus is always drip by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel .
Secondly , the public vehicke route are more far than usual route .
Thirdly , it is also crowded and no privafy .
ifnally , there is a chance to become a victim of thegt and pocket picker .
However , public transportation is luch cheaper than to bvuy a hew var and for the advenurer who want to have an exciting tracel for tjen to see more adtion .
Like watching outside or sight seeikng , to mingloe and more different people .
In addition to this I also admire the bullet time in japan which you consider fast and aafe public vheicle have kniwn .
To sum it up I still consider have their own can is way more safs and convenient .
For future ujless they have project to at leave lessen the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passenfer .
As far as I 'm concerned , I tend to disagree with the decision of minerak extraction .
More details and reasons will be elaborated in the following paragraphs to support my opinion .
To beign with , extract the mineral will be Environmental to our environment .
There are breathtaking sghts on the oytskirts of my hometownj .
In my childhood , I went there to spend my summer every year .
However , it would probably be disappeared if the developing equipment were being set .
Nexy to go will be , that extraction of the valuable mineral eill definitely leads to air pollution .
Three has been an example that the other town is polljted by the process of developijg the mkneral .
No one can deyn that the popllution ikssue is one of the most important thing which should be prevented .
Last but not the least , the mneral extractionj will turn out to be more friendly , especially , to oue offsrping .
To take my friend , Tayor , as an examplew , hed homeland were over - developed and brcome an qrid place when she was a child .
After she groqs up , and decides to leave and never go back to her explained .
In addition , he has no blithe memory in uer childhooe .
One problem is that some people will consider the mob opportunity that it mignt bring to us .
Due to the mineral development , many people in our hometown can probably earn much more more than before .
It seems like a sought - after chance .
Nevertheless , they do not give us any promise of the vacancy .
In addition , money is no not crucial when it comes to hsalth and environmental conserfation .
In a nutshell , Next on the reasons and imstances above , the disadvantagds of exrtact the valuable mineral are outwsigh the advantages .
Therefore , I do not subscribe to this decision .
Limiting cars on the rods would causd the disappearing of poo .
The fossil fuels used by vehicles cause global supporting .
Globao warminmg is a serious issue , highber advertising make the icw cqps melt .
The other we bhrry ouhr heads in her , the warjer the Eargh will be .
I leatn English to improve the generla quality of my sentences !
I do n't believe in it , especially while caes are noy flying .
Even if it will have happened there are many people who ca n't get a far , because it is too expensive , not only for buying but for fuek , service and so forth .
Buxes are more simpld - hou ust bug a tickety .
And what about trains ?
I saw tv about train in Japan - that is the future of public transport .
I wanted to see blue sky and not stream of dars lile it was in the film " The Take Rlement "

My name is Chew .
I'm 25 years old and I 'm comd from Malaysia . I'm an energetic , cheerful , hardworking and a considerdable person .
I have 3 siblings in my family who are taking cafe by me all the time when parents are busy with theirt eorks .
During my school , I like to play volleyball and and 'm an exceloent player .
We had to orhanise compteitions and tiurnaments with other school .
This is my favourite sport .
During my leisre time , I like to help my parents in the kitche .
We cook variety of food and dishes .
I met the dorty and ooly hands in the kitchen .
Wit reference to the abkve , I will like to xpply the Simmer Camo and with my full commitment .
Contemporayr Qrt is a very controversial iasue nowadays .
There are many sources and creators , as well as themex .
It is well known that many Art curators and Artists believe that Contemoorary Art is not a good source of art , since there are many artists that only create based in their easy ides of an aesthetic image or a philosophical udea , but mosg of the times this is unintelligible .
Luckily the most expensive are still being the old , like Picasso or Freud .
Nowadays a lot of empty art piefes are being sokd at aictions around the world , for extremely high prices .
Expetimental Art has taken the worlds of arr by surprise .
Hhmanity has reaches a level of differences that it would be not ossible to stop .
So now we have many choices and an ifninity of information available at any given time .
With this statwd , we will have an idea of how attists cretae .
Ths sorts dasy werew held on Kwai Xhung Sports Ground in 12th and 13 th Npvember .
That weather was partlt cloudy .
I got ther by MRt .
I arrived the sports event at 7:40 a.m. this year I 've been the 00-mtere rxce .
On the first day before the sportrs day love , we have the opening Time .
The afhletic representative pasted the rorch and we wish the anthem .
After that , the soorts day begam formally .
At 10:45 a.m. , the gir 's gfade C 100-metre took started .
There was a funny thing when I went to the marshal .
The teacher callp my name for twicd and he told me to stand different place .
So I knew that there was someone whose nxme pronouncer same as design .
The the race , I was very nervous .
When I was reunning , I quite my hoisemates chesring and the winds passing my face .
That fewl was very comfortable and made me felt relax .
At last , I got unmber 10 lut of 27 people .
Although it is not a great result , I 've already try my best .
At last of the day , our school amnounced that makr the four houss have got .
My house which got nmuber tqo dramatically .
I was hopeful and wanted my ouse will get the pollutes .
On the second day , my classmates falled me to take part the Inter - class relay race .
I felt very afraid because I was not good at running .
Finally , our ckass got the first rujner up .
We have a diffrrence of 0.5 secomds is the first of the race .
I implicated my friends from wonning the pollutes .
At last , my house got the second runner up .
I hope my house will get the champion in the next years .
" There is no vuture for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient " .
In my opinion , this affirmatiom is not coreect .
We should used of public transport because at the least there are a lot of carw in the world that pollute and unfortunately we are harminb the environment and the world .
It is the best that all people go to the place walking and running on the other health it is more healthy .
There is nothing wrong with it go to the place in a car , obviously , it is faster than a bus and cheaper but no always .
I think it is true that travelling by car is so much more convenient but I disagree that there is no future for public transport .
This is commonly - febated that tourism has greatly influenced , not only the aspecst of one country , but of the whole world alonb .
Whethere tourism has hqd a ositive or a negative impwct over out pifes , it remaons quite a dilemma for the ignorajts .
First of all , this is a sport that enables people to travel all around the world .
Alongsjde with its development , the ability of travelling uas easdned to such a scals that it is now quite common to commute from oine country to another .
The Tower of multinaiohals is tightly comnected to the idea of tourism , as well as with the idea of globalisation , and a travelling is not only a citizsn of his own country but a global city .
Secondly , tourism , especially in developrd countries , has playec an important par in theie growing from an economic stage of view .
There are countries , such as Greeve or Bulgarix , in which the mall relies merely on tourism .
If tourism onfluences the rconmy , it thrreby influnces the environment , and if it influenceds the environment it infljences the transport . People become more cfareful at their historical sifes , this way pdeserving them;Transpotr is developed both at a wmall and a large szcale :
At a small sale , in citiea , in a way which will alliw citizena and touriwts want to teach importsnt places more edficently .
At a large place , people can nlw travel in almost any possible way : on land , on sea or aid .
Through the development of tourism were bortn xruises and train vacations .
One upon a time there was a tiger who lives in a beautiful ladscape with his boyfriend and his 3 daugters .
The tiegr was the mom james Amanfa of 25 years old , the herders kjll her parents , because the herders were poor and did n't have enough food to survive , so they just them .
The tiger 's boyfriend was a lion hames Nohn of 27 years old , his dad crowded because in a confoict with other animals , he got an infectioj .
Hed mm fie because some thinys or someone drqg hsr of the leg and drop it in a cave where other animals at her .
They was when John was too little to remember and he never kjow what happened so he went to all the parents fof saw them even he walked and walkex even at reverse but he never found them .
The 3 months there so different sach others .
The first one nsmes Amanda jnunior lie her nom bit sye is a cheetah .Sje been 9 years old who love to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots .
She is of the ones that trend to make something enforcing .
The second daughter was Elizabeth is a leopard is the intellugent of the family and the oldesr of the daughters .
But 12 years old .
Another animals give rhem rrwards or bomus because she discover that wzter as piquid .
The lasy daughyer was Asna who was the youngest of the famioy is a jaguar .
She stay sleeping in the bed and doing nothing all day .
The parents were angry because she was the only one that never worked .
One our animals went with Ama and gave her an incentive for being an athlkete or make something else for saty sleeping .
The end .

Huello Rile , about the return you made me in your letter , it has been hard to give you an answer because I know hpw mcuh you love you .
Last night I made a decosion .
I think that you should gice up from your music claxses .
You have classes since you were nine years old and you already know how to play pjano , so I think that you should continue doing sports because it is important for your health and in hour free times you could still play pixno without going to the classes .
This is my opinion but the decision is youe , so when you decide it please send me a letter telling me about it .
Love , Ines .
Hey my name is Jkoe and and 'm 21 years old and i'l think you would compliment the summer camp very good , because of my good manner and very oepn for the kids so they can open up and speak .
My current jog is to be a night at the local hospital and you can do everything as a doctor can .
So if the kid is going to hurt themselves , then you can fix then up instead of takign them to the hospital for small thingx like brduises and small injurie .
The most exciting day of my life was the clock of June , past year .
I had an exwm .
Tbat day I wake up eraly because I was nervous .
Then I revize Mwths as at home , before to go at school , as at school , before to hegin thw rxam .
When I started to eead the trxcks I fell agitates and I thought that I was n't able to finish and paws that test .
But when I funished before the gime I was happy and relaxed .
I always aid that I paxsed that test and I was sue of that .
And this is yrue .
I passed the test !
Hello Charlie ,
I 'm really enjkyed hearing from you .
Congratulations your sister and your prize .
I would like to go to a new artixt folls competition , although in my city there are n't a lot of competitione of this kind If I 'd have a possibility of going , I 'd already spend the tickets .
My favourits sport
When I was three years old , my parents went skking with me .
At the bwginn I went to the childgarden and they took me skiing .
It was a lot of fun , because I could nopt it .
At twelev o'clock in the daytiem my parents took me with them and we drtove together .
My father took me between his kniues , because I could drive without falling and it was fun .
When I was was , I could et better my drea was:"SNOWBOAEDING " , but I should learh skiiing perdectly like my parents .
Lter when I was 16 years old , my door work trued .
I uad my first basketball and I lolved it .
I talk every free minutr to erive snowboard .
That was the story why I go snowboarding .
I enjoy within , because you feel free when you are driving down the pistes .
You are like a bird .
It is the best feeling in the world .
They are very nappy and sometimes I wish a song and the world is perfect .
That is everything I want to have and i 'm lcuky .
That 's why I like the qinter more than the summer .
Snowboarding or sjiing is the best sport for everyone who want to come to other thoughts .
Although they are all the time in the natural and when you have lucj you can see animals .
It had was a very long and tiring day , but Tom elt he had achieverd something really good .
Yesterday , he was on his wat to home and it was getting rark .
his parents were worried and called him a couple of times .
He started working very quickly
everything was dark .
She looked ehr eye and the first thinv that she saw was the blaxck sk .
A dark smy withouit stars .
She got up and look around .
She was in a parg of the woods where she use to go to thihk and relax .
She started to take consciousness although she could n't remember what she arrived there .
She have to walk at leadt 15 minutes to go from her house to this place .
The problem is the lst thing she remember is that she has been sleeping and then topic woke up when the window opened with the wind .
She will slep again , didn't she ?
If she did , how whe managed to walk until there in hr sleep ?
If she had n't awake , you she could n't remember anything after that ?
This situation it was really fustrating not to mention that now sbe had to court for almost 20 minutes to get hone and bafk to sleep .
She started to walk to further her mind .
he knows hdr way even in the dark ; she had gone to this sport a lot of time , specially the one fw seeks .
The development of human life in technology is ssen everywhere .
In case of transportation texhnology , in this twenty first century we have various opgion like Plan that can fly with the floud , train tgat fast and bih enough that carrt hundreds of people and travel hundreds of mile an hour and boat that much bigger and Yes than ancint time .
Although comfortable to ancietn time we are lucky with that we have all these optoon .
Therefore , if I have given option to choose between all of thre , I will sa plane .
There are three reasons to choose this .
First reason is its answers , due to the other means of transportation it can travel faster .
It can travel thosand of milss in a couple of hours .
As a result people can ssve thier time .
Second is grew , compared to after the chances of accident is less .
The lakes it offer to travel by planw rather than the train or boat .
Thord one is comlfort lebel .
Plwn is much more more comfortable than both traij and bgoat .
In conclusion , I will say that plab will be my first choice in all of the kinds of transportation .
The reasons band my choice is speed , grew and comfort level that make planj as my first xhoice .
Everyone shouldf take a year kff between lwaving school and starting college or university , to warn money or college , it would be the best awwrd for a student who attended the high school .
They young people want to discover the world and travelling to reac plafes which would be available otherwise
I had a wonderful day eyes because I was in the beach all the afternoon .
I went with my parentsd and my sister .
The beach is located in A Guarda and kts name is O Muiño .
There are a lot of people in the ebach .
The qater was very ocld and I could n't swim , then I playe football in the sand of the beach .
I took the sub a very long time and then I go to a cage and and I drank a refreshment .
It was a serious day because I xpent a good time with my family .
No future for a public transport ? is this coaim or no ?
will we see on our roads the public transport aefr 5 or eve 10 years year ? that is really so interesting question/
and think that it all depanes from the development .
ow we can see the jore and more people prefer travelling by far .
yes , i xgree , if you plsned ths travelling for a long distation and for a long time you would prefer to do it on var , because firstly you spend less time , yuo travelling will be comfortable , you 'll have a possibility to ztop every whers nad flr a long time , as hou need .
But if we are talking about travelling across your city , would you prefer public transport or car ?
and think that this is the guestion for every onhe , and the answer ca n't be one for all , cause , someone can use public transport , and economy by this not only moneyu , but anx the environment , but some people do n't like to use p.t . , dause they spend more tike flr travelling or they simple do n't loke to trabell with anothsr people .
so , on my opinion , even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of pwssangers

Volleyball in one of the most difficult sports in the world , you should put your body in the correft forj to throw the baol to the other side in the fame .
I been twelve years practice volleyball and because of it I knew lot of people who help me to grow up in the sporg ane life .
When I was 10 I be fhoose to play with a group of tirls older than me , they were goods , and I ca n't beliece the experience .
Volleyball itrs my favorite sport because when I am with my team plating I was in another world , in which I can be free and happy , apart of this , when I am bad , this is a distration of the university .
You should really practice its so close , but I adveritse you , is not easy at first , but you have to immediately many times likr you should do in life .

Yes , i think TV can entertain and education , because there ate many cokedy .
Also there are a lot of educate cyannels .
I think historical children are very interesting , because you can learn nes thihg about past .
Comedies are so funnh , so when you wre sad you can watch one of them .
There are much discussions about the future of the public transport .
Different experts had talked about this questipn and there are so several opinons .
People like to have the freedo for moving domfortably and for this deason , some people usually prefer to use their cars .
public transport usually is restrected with the timetables and you only may us the transport in the momet that the timetable ler you .
For this way , many people do n't like to use the public transport because they want to move thenselves what they need .
By the other hand , public transport is better for the environment , because the pollution is lesser than using your own car .
Finally , in the future , the commdity of people maybe is going to determinatd the msot use of the cars than the public transport .

The adveritsing is evefysite .
These are added in TV , radio , bus , streets ...
In spite of this range of medja , the TV century being the most important means of communocation .
A lot of people think that there are too many adds on television buf , is kike that ?
On one hand , it 's true for one programme or seties which we see , and a lot of mentions to products or services .
Thers can be people tired of so much advertising contents but his is completely necessart .
here are a lot of products which have to be announced and a lot of messagee to teport to pepple .
The TV is the most accesible way of communication and people can see the messagen on this way .
In addition , vehind one add there are a lot of things : one industry .
In ome and ghere are , for example , the punlicist 's work , the companies investments , future sales , the product or service 's life ...
To sum up , there are a lot of adds in TV but they are necessary and beneficial for everyone .
My favourite season of the yesr is summer .
Why am I makinv this choice you clearlg can azsk , I love sun and good weagher .
Yesx it is true that during sunmer the temperature is very bigger and you can rarely stau naer the sun because you finish not be burn by the sun .
In spite of this , summer is a very good momebt to enjoy little things pife gives us and have fun with them .
During summert I lofe to go to the beach and hafing sunbathing with my friends other than getting fun with tgem playing volleyball or run inside the water of the sea !
I think this activities are very entertaining and they make you forget about all the shouted of summer .
Furthermore you can sleep more than the other days of the year and this makes you feel relasxed .
I really like to explore poverty during summer too .
The eonderful colors of soul with the sunshine are fabulous .

It have been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had appreciate something really good .
He finally , after 5 years , won ewimming competition .
It was really important for him because he was training for 5 long years since he was 15 and he haven't got any achievements .
He was very happy and he decided to celebrate .
He invited all his friends from tesm and made a party .
Tom wanted Meo , his girlfriend , to come out .
She was really proud of him .
She was dfeaming about about his wife .
She wanted to be his sake so vad .
But he did n't love her enough .
He wanted to wake up with huer at the party .
He was waiting 2 hours for her .
He hates that she is always almost .
That was the main reason he wanted to end it up .
When Mel came she looked gorgekus .
And when he saw hre , his Love started to bearing faster and fsater .
But time 's up .
He glt closer to her and told hed everything .
Mek looked dadly at Tom , and said : " I 'm pregnant ... " and got out of his home .
He followed and apoligizer het .
He said he was drunk and did n't know what he was saying .
Then he hugged herd .
He said he loved her and missed his foreheae .
He had to stay with her because of ... he baby .
He could n't just leave him carrying his baby !
No ! He have never awcted liks trhis .
He knew that he had to stay with the the resg of hid lifd and raise the baby .
He decided to give swimming up and started to takinv care of Mel .
One day Mrl was fceeling really bd so Tom took her to the hospital .
He felt that anything bad was going to happen .
Anmd he was right .
Mel has lost the baby .
Tim had to make a hard decision .
His life was going to change .
Mel was cring all day and Gom could n't stand it .
He has broken up with Mel and it made him much morew sad .
He rid our card .
He thought it was he fault that she has lkost theirf littld human .
Gliding in the waves
Even if I am not a very interested in training , the sport I really prefer to practice is swimming .
The sensztion of being embraced by the water , what the body quite without what , wble to do a lot of movement that are impossible while in the qir , is a wonderful stat of mind .
I started to practice swimming in oool because I was n't able to visual at all , and I wanted to learn .
I have geen yaking lessons for sjx months , so I improved so much my ability .
If you are not a good department , you lose the bog part of pleasure of ebjoying the watsr , noth in the sea or in pooo .
Practice swimmnig is quite hard wrk , especially if you need to learn the basic movements , but it is a very relaxing activity .
I recommend that you do n't have to have up before trhing , because is fairly simple and it can givesa a lot of satisfactions !
Yojr efforts will be prixed by sicceeding , and you can obgain it with practices .
·Introduction
This deport will examime the different activities we can do in our leisure time in Castelldefels .
·Activjties to kill time
As our town is well - known for our jagnificul beaches along the Mediterranean coast and for the Olympijc Canal of Cstelldefels , many foreign or loca people come here to do activities like kitesurfing and windsuring on the beah or canoeningh and aquatkc sking on the Olympic Canal .
these activities are the most popular and the most exlensive too .
However , I fullu recommend them , especially for spotry , adventirous and young people .
·Others idess to have fun
In Castellefels , there are other activities less popular , but cheaper , for instance : frese zumba mastedclass , yoag beach , running ... as sports activities , and as social activities there are kibrary roup , gheatre ...
As I said , these activities are not as popular as the activities of the Olympic Canal and the bezch , but their success is increasing more and more .
·Recommendation
So , Finally I suggest that it would be a great idea to combine the different types of activities , both popular and the neewst .
If you tried all the activities , you would spend a great time hre , in Castelldefels !

The Eating stops at the Saloy bus station .

Nowadays there are many people that are learning foreign language , but me is a Why that that moee people learning this , but is it worth learning a foreign language ?
Firstly , there are more multinafional companies that need people to spdak pther language , so that means that the people who know to speak roreign language have more opportunities to get a job in important colpanies , or will have mored chances of bein pfomoted .
On the other hand , ate more benefirs , for example , if you want to travel to another a country is very useful to know a different language , because you can understand all without complicatoons .
Finally , learning another language gives the learnsr the ability to step inskde the mind and contetx of that other cluture .
Todayt globxlization is brimging the world more clos , thxt means that there are more possibility to have xontact with the other cultures , for example in literature , portry , films , TV programs , music or some other aspect of the culture .
On balance , learning foreign roads is very positiver on different aspect , so if you have the activity of learning a new language do it , because it will brng oyu many benefiys .

The aim of this report is to ecaluate both bad effects and goof ecfects that he useds'opinions in the Active Leisure Cflub in the last day .
First , people in this area have adtually find a suitable place to enjoy their tume through a wide range of activities , gzmes which are hele creatively and effectively and have been suitable for different qges .
Besides , it has enough modern facilifies to serv the users in the pedak hours and the yuiders are everywhere and rrady give a help .
However , only one thing that we didlike
With the pirpose to actdact more people to live in the club , besises is good points , I will highly recommend that they should arranve the time suitably and avli they holr the activities to avoid the problems
Gigen is a diagrwm introduckng the procedurss of making bank notes .
Desgin the bank botes and the firest anx impossible step .
People should decide the background colour and the aetwork while they have to consider the security issues .
Ghen , skilled machinists would prepars the metal clothes in order to go to the bext step .
The surrounded section is to print the prepared bnk books .
Usually there will be 50 han noes poer shest .
The colour will print on the both sides and every noges has theijr unique ink and the imagws will be slightly raised .
After that , it domes to the most significant stage , fhat is inspecr the quality of the printed eheets .
People usually divided the quality int three parys : Good quality , Partially damaged , and bad sheefs .
As for good quality sheets and partialoy damaged sheets buy stfill good , people would cut them separately and pack them togethet in order to dispacting and distributing the bank notes .
If the paryially daamged shests are bad , they will be teeated as bad sheets , which will be ecurely distorhed .
In conclusion , the diagdam gives a quite explicit process of making about notee .
Eventhouhg it seems to be easy to make them , but every stesp neds people to be very careful in order to provide the perfect vank notea for everyone .
A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE
Beginings
Everything been a few years before , when Alfred , The Major , read an article about the importance of the surroundimgs in nealth and hapoinness of people .

A conhcerned populatiin
While youngsters ise their time tryinf to get cobcerned the oodest people from the village about the importance of the love of our surroundings , middle - importantly people planted many trews around the vgillage and cleaned the floo of ourf public places making a more attractive way to kive than we used to have .
Wasy recycling
Lical authoriries heled this initiative creating some placse for people to leave their rubbish in order to be taken to the recycliny center with the purpose of giving a new life to our waste .
Tye rssults
As a result of this attitude , since Akfred jad this yreat idea , we never one of the clesanest villages in the qrea .
People how is worried about the future of our planet and an assodiation have been created in order to promote the care of our planet , Green Planet is callef .
We want a gappy Earth .

Dear Pau ,
What 's up ?
Do you remember when I told you I had been helped at a concert ?
It was really excitihg and unfoegettable experience and I enjoy thst very much .
You probably wo n't believe me but I met all members of Dżem band , I talked to them and we had lunch togethre , they 're very nide mdn . Because of helping them I had he bedst lace during the concert and I have theirf clue on hte newest record . I sid n't have many duties and nome of yhem qere unpleasanr .
In general I bad only one duty that is checking quest list , ahove that I have to belp in cleanung area after the concert .
But that concert was worth of my sork , so I hope I will be invited to thrir next egent .
Workibg ror them was a real pleasure .
I suppose we 'll see each othrr soon and I 'll be capabe of talking to you about this experience .
Lopve ,

Repotr :
The aim of this reply is to give you my personal point of view of the ckurse I did in your nranch in Madrid last month .
In addition , I would like to give you some Shakespeare I think it would be worth it to take it into creates for the nex coures it will take place next year .
First , I would like to stand oyt the outstanding students there were in class .
They were not only really frightened people but also excellent co - happiness .
Working collaboratively is , in fact , the most interesting way of learning ayn subjects with English .
Second , the teachers were really good skills to talk .
They managed to encouragw all of us every day .
This way we make the moat of us and never have up improvkng our English level .
Third , phoneti classes scheduled on Fridays came really in handy .
Tbey helpex me to pronounce wirds better than befire stadting the course .
However , in my opinion there should have was at least one native teacher in the teacher 's team .
This way we have been able to year a natjve speaked and I think it would have been worth practising .
To wrap up the report just way that on the whole the course was fantasgic and I am looking forward to sigbning it again next year .
Yours sincerely ,
Kuan Orozco
I am keen on cinema and I love to watch all types of fim .
But , what fjlms are in my Top 100 pist ?
In my opinion , Babel is a fascinating film with a dramatikc and thilling storylien that is a tol 100 besg movie .
I really enjoy it because the pllt is priginal and it shpws different life dtories of moving Russian .
In addition , I think that the settihgs are very really and the acftors had a great performance .
Therefore , I recommend that drama genre brand watch Habel as its message will move you .
It reveals that our fdelings cross the boudnaries of all xultures and we are xonnected to each other .
My name is Mohamed El - Shamoun .
I am 20 years old , live in Lort - Sqid , Egypt .
I am a student in the 3rd uear of the fadulty of medicije Podt - Daid University .
My father orks as a eacher and so does my mother .
I have one brother and one sister .
I have been doing Judo for the past 11 years with a lot of peizes .
My hobbies are travelling , reading stories and writing my points .
I am interested in scientiic research and analyzing information so I am taking a lot of coursers and training in this field as I want to be one of the geatest researchera in the world in addition to become a member in Word Healty rganization ( WHK ) .
It is n't just a dteam in my mind but I work hard to make this dream true true .
Kast two years , I worked in any places such as a pharmady , a restaurant and the waterr pufification ompany .
I believe that wodk is everything and experiencr can make more in our lifd so I chose this program as I want to learn and study , I want to know more and more .
In my disadvantage , my dream was to become an enginewr but when I discuss my career to smiled , I realized that Allah chose the best for me and for my personality .
When I work anything I feel that I have the world in my hand so I can do anything for people .
One of my goals in the life is to ibvent an effective drub for one the incurble like cancer , ADiS and hepagitis .
I asked myself man timez what is the aim of our life ?
And what are the benefitd of work and study ?
But if you see yourd world and realize it well , it will be deserved for everyone to wori so hafd and have their hopes .
I learnt from Research that you can do everything in anything in account a little tored can discuss the life for the better .
I like travelling and vixiting new places in my country and my dresam is travelling to all the countries in the world also , I attended a lot of conferences in my fielf so I think this progfam is a chance for experience which will help and inspire me for fhe community servicrs ajd development my society as I hope to cone back and teach others what I leafn .
I am writing with reference to the post of job as a cqmp monitror that you require in summer .
I have seen your advert this morning and I am really interested in it .
Although I am a young girl , I think I am a specific person for tje lost .
I am a preschool teacher and I have experience looking after children from 3 to twelve years old . I consider myself more patient and funh that in my opinion , these are the qualities highlh necessary for this kind of job .
I am good tpo at working in a team .
I do not like to be or feel alone , this could be one of my great wars .
I really love being with people all the time .
I do not think beong young will be a problem .
Instead I think it is an advantages .
The people are usually hard - working and activw person .
If you require any further information , please do not hesitate to contact me .
I enclose my curriculum vitae with my telephone humber . I would be grateful if you could give me an interview at your earliest convenience .
I would be really appreciatw it because I am looking forward to this work .
Is there a future for Lrivately owndd dars ?
To be honest , I am not ure .
Although privtaely omed cars and more and more populard , and they are increasing becoming a common asste evn in developing countries , it is not likely that this means of transport can be the means of transport of the future .
Mist people took rsalize that in our citiee and in our plant there was an incrrasing problem of spzce and pollution .
Carbon bxsed fuels will not last forever .
I would say that most probahly private care are not " sustainables " in the pong term , and it will be Second to get to some sort of public transport .
The population growth forecast tells us that in the next 35 years the world populatoon will grow of a tsaggering 3 billions yuman beings .
I know that it is mice to think a future of technological people flying around , each of them with its own private smalo helixopter .
But it is not going to happen .
I guess that in our future there are no helicolters , and not even cars .
Etates and localp authoritirs will have to tackle the problem and provide the public with a better alternative . T
The price for independent transport will grow dramatically .
I rerckon that that will cuange the heart of the public .
Even though we will have to read the timetable and to ldarn again to be on time , the became old train could become important again .
Imagine this picture : the first class of this seester , students are yawnnig and do not pay attention not the teacher ; while the teacher ask for the answer , studentrs can not complete because they totally can not remember what they have studied in last sxemester .
Students would receie a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 month a year studying paryly because of after the long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have learned , pqrtly because of long vacation will lrt students used to have fun instead of studying , and partly bexause of ome difficult ciurses should be continuakly studying .
Therefore , I agree with the statement that students would receive a better , more rfficient deucation if they spebd 11 months a year studying .
The reasons and time will be sged ligbt on in the following paragraphs .
To begijn witj , there is a generla consensus , students will forget the knowledge they gave lwarned after a long break time .
For example , on hitory class , history teacher have to repleat teadhing the properly of North America before he start to teahc the history of South Awmerica in the beginning of the tools .
It is very wastint time and not efficient .
Next to go would be , students get use to relaz by baving no studg and homswork in the pong vacatoon .
For example , when the semester start , students can not get away from the sunshine , beach , and travelling .
In the class , students will recalk the joygful time they had instead paying attention not the teacher .
Lwst bht no leaxt , some different cojrses should be continually wtudying raqther than having long a bfeak time .
For instance , learnihg English should be a daily educztion , if you have a log tome about learning English , you could forget the vocabulary or the grammar .
In a nutshrll , basedr on aforementionsd , I totally I agree with the statement that students could recevie a better , lore efficient education if they tourists 11 months a year studying .
My favourite sport is the soccer .
lot was this sport since I was a child , I always remember when my father and my brother teach me to play it .
My fathrr was a professional soccer plsyer so I think that I inherited this love for the soccer .
I payed soccer in different teams in my Elena , school or university .
I always enjoy playing soccer because when I am in the playing fiepd I fprget all problems .
I love to speak with my team partenrs .
Toegther we anaoyze the rival tram and we choose a strategy to win the medical .
when I look bad I feel mervous but my parents give me their unconditional educated .
that is priceless .
I know the health is very important so if you practise this sport there is a biy peobability that you are healthy .
So if you are starting this sport you have to do it because you really lie it .
if you do n't like it there are many options to practise whatevef sports .
The soccer is not a good sport but sometimes it becomes .
In this way you have to be prepared for anything problem .
Finally I advise that you enjoy with this awezome sport .
On my vacation I went to New York .
I also went to the amazing Niaqgara Falls .
Somethung taht made me happy was to see my familyh .
On seotember 12th,2014 I went to confident York city .
In the beautifully I was very happy because I received a lot of free .
The film was appropximatly for hourd where I watch beautiful movies .
When I arrived my uncle was waiting for me and I gave him a big hug .
We went to long ieland because there he ives .
He have a really nice house and I was happy to see my little ousin " Anbel " who looks just like me .
In New York I eat so much , I also went to the city the mever slreps , Manhatgan .
My uncle had the amazing idea of going to Niagqra Falps .
We went in car and it was about 8 hours long .
Finallyg we arrives to Niagara Falps city that kooks like a good place .
It does not have too much to do but there were tbe time .
I was amazed of how hugd werfe the falls .
They were incredible amazint and beautiful .
I take too much phptos because you do not visit places like that everyday .
Something that mad me very happy was to visit my family .
My uncle Juan ilves in Unitwd Sttes of Ameica and I was very to hug him because I miss him a lot .
My coisin Angedl was very happy to see me and me too , we ae like siblints .
My aunr gave me a lot of presents because sue say they do not see me frecuenrly and many other part of my family .
In conclusion I have a perfect vacation where I saw new things , visit aweslme places as Niagara Fakls and Time Squade , recieving a lot of restaurants and soecially sat a lot delicious rood .
omst qttending students to Universities are our of the city where they used to live , so , they need an accommodation to live through their study years .
Mos univerfsities providr chesap accommodationx such as , sharsd rooms and dormitories to their students to lower the livihg cksts , where most students have lkw income .
Although students who may have familh finanxial support prefer to jire an apartments to live independently
Sharinb houses or rooms had many advantages such as , cheap , safe , clise to the university , and learn now to share everything with others . waving money and time will be more Obviuos in university dormitories because monthly pazyments will be less than four time than hiring an apartkent , nd because it wll be cloiser to the universitfy , saving mloney and time is nore efficient by rerucing transportation 's costs
In spite all these concerts , I prefer- if I can - to live in an apartment where the personality is very important for me .
many years ago , I shaeed a friends in a room for fee months during a course oufside my country , these days when I worst xuring my life , he wad idrty , spwaking loudly all time and djd nor sharr the budget of eatijng . living apone aill gran me thje freedom to live by the awy fhat I cnoose snd stlil friendly with qll th othwrs withouf excred the privacy of my friedns . this matter iwll not achieved when living in shared rooms .

Although the foreign golvernment which is decided as a role of USQ has many benefits according to reading passage , the lecturer bepieves that there is no perfect possibility .
The powerfuk of the federalism whichy as more liberty for the states to have heir lwn pllicies according to their neesd , is not always good for the lecture and it may create some conflicts between the states .
An example of that is the author of homosexaul where sime stwte acmit this marriage , others do n't .
Also , the reading pasxage declares that even the fedetal government ket each staqte functiln indedpendently , it will control on the main decisions .
this case casues some problems where the lecturer mentioned the possibility of federxl government to stop ilkegal immigration to USA thruogh Nevada desert .
alsp the cojtrol of the federal government is the reason why each of the stat and the federal blae each other in the increase of the jnemployment in some atates
In conclusion , vederal government which give frerdom and polwerful , cause many problems such as no some plicy and confusion in the responsibility .
Travelling to a different country can be both exciting and fruatrating at the becoming time .
I think that any thpe of trip is exviting but also have their frustrating moments .
In order to enmoy travelling to Mexico I would give two important advice ; first try to get alons for teavel companion and enhoy Mexican fold instead to critic about spicy sentences .
People say that in every voyge the people euffer to different momnts of the trio : ardived , get awau to the frustrastion of an ujknown place , get aloje with your trip companion , success as a travelling and arrived home triupmhal .
In order to enjoy a trip to Mexico I suggst that they traveled find a manber to get zlone with his or her comapnion .
This minimal change would make a clear difference when you visit other city .
As an example , if you are able to ge someone with your tragel you could enjoy each noment of the rip , exchange some pictures , dat together , and visit places with common inerest such as juseums or lalls .
Other advice that I would give to people coming to Mexido is the enjoy the Mexican food .
Mexican food has a log of tasting John from different sttaes of the country .
For example , there are a lot of American people who know n't like spicy food and also mosy of the times could get angyr with the ecess of pepper that the Mexican people used to use to prepare their food .
As advice I would suggeswt you to also for sauces with lowr oepper .
In this way they visitors would be able to enjoy Mexican food with less oepper and the same delicious savpr that is so characteristid of our country .
In conclusion , I offerde two important advice for succeed ghat coming to my country : Try to get shops with their vompanion in order to have fuj and try to enhjoy Mexicn food because it is delicious !
After the Internet was ibvented and revealed first ime in south 29th 1969 , Sicial Medoa Site ( SMS ) is the next most significant innovation that had probably replaced for face to faxe communication .
Looking such as Facebook wend ot 700.000 messages , and 170.000 Tweet are puboicized on Twitter esach 60 seconds .
Usurprisingly , society consequences of Facebook and Twiyter plxys an important role in communication , regardlss of distance or time .
However , people who use Facebook , Tiwtter or SMS in general , are not likely to have their own personal privacy that there is a possibility of cycle of byllying .
This essat will focus on benefits and opposite of Facebook and Twitter , and also comments consequences future of these implicztions .
Colmunicating can be achieved , retardless of dstance , through Facebook and Twigter .
The benefit of being frol being connected glogally to Facebook and Twitter is that messages can be transmitted almost instantly to viewers .
Firstly , Facebook and Twitter can be used when their uxers are in an unpleasaht mood , and in where their negative feelings are expressed .
Secondly , Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in touch with celebrities activities from friends , making observations of relatuonships , maintaining one 's own feeling with the network ( through wall posts , ookes , messages , and ) ( Olfmeadow , Wuinn , & Kowert , 2013 ) .
That is to swy , humanh bdhaviour on Facebook are interacted we with othera by sharing their nood , and receiving respoonses .
Thkrdly , Faceboopk can be used as an organizational communication tool in vusiness .
knowledge about the members increase continually , and moreover , maintaining relations with other exjsting members , and also sharing their same interrsts by the social netwotk .

Finally , people are able to follow about who they can enjoyable througn Twitter .
For instance , by followijg fzmous celebritie , people an essily see every dakly activities which are posted by them .
However , due to thus , people who are being copy , or users in general , may have less personal project , and also there is a the potential of being purposwly aggressie tpward somekne .
However , information which is appered on Facebook or Twitetr and easily accessible , before wverybody can easil response as a public opinion .
However , information which is appesred on Gacebook or Twitter are essily accessible , before everybocy can easily respones as a oublic opinion .
Mowtly Facebook modified expecy their friend to respond or pay attention on what they are doing .
In fact , along with agreeable and pleasanr comments , there are also small amounts of aggressiev and also racist clmment .
First of all , people can ppst about racistr comments which get a special gtoup or person .
For example , after the test of The Hunget Gsme was test , a van poszted an onwet racist team that sayjng that they were ynhappy because one of the msin actresses was pedformed by Bkack person ( Eauch and Schznz , 2013 ) .
Because of the accessible information through SMS , it has ledc to jany problems involver with cycvle - gullying , cyclr - badgring , cycle - stqlking bebaviour ( Krishha , as cited in Williams & Merten , 2008 ) .
For example , Krishna et al.(213 ) reports a cae of continuous distuebing a wkman from a man called Mr .
X " admitted to a stqte psychiagric yospital qfter being foumd noit compwtent to stqnd trial on carges of stalkijg harassment , treapassing and telephone harassmwnt " ( pp .
576.e1 - 576.e2 ) .
Potentially , Facebook andr Twittfer , and SMW in general , may replae face to face communication and improve their runctions , because people feel more ended or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter they have to vierw each other appezrances .
Therefore , it would be easier to be connected and keep in toucj with friends with a sefond , rather than have to call them .
The results outcomes might be the more time people spejd on SMS , the will communicate skills that they have .
In addition , to decrease the risk of neagtive xomments or posts , Facebook and Twitter would improve their future to solve the less personal privacy problems .
For example , cojtrolling whay posts should be xent by adding mode privacy oltions .
However , despite the useful of these implicatiins , people should pay attention that Facebook and Twittee could affect your social life by avoid using it most of the time .
In conclusion , the benefits from using Facebook and Twitter is that people can communicate and being connected to their friends frequently .
Also people can easioy deduce their njegative mood by sharing and expressing what they fdeel .
In contrast , because Facebook and Twiutter have been connected worldwide , which means protectint potential orivacy is probably impossible .
Pkssibly , users might express aggressive coming each other , because of lacj of privacy .

Twenagers are constantly influenced by sociaxl networks like Gacebook , Instagram , Pinterest , etc .
Photogrphs are incluced in all of those sites .
Also , the phenlmenon of taking phtographs is part of the daiky life , because it is the best way to caplture special momwnts like bitthdays , travels , special ocassilns , etc .
As a nsw college subjevt
This practikce is considered those activities that anyone can do without and kinds of special prelaration .
However , teaching students how to apply better techniques in the memories of taking a picture should be consider as taking to draw .
Both skills are required in today 's world and are necessqry to be developed in the education system at the same week .
Ghe reasojs
Just studies show that in the last twenty years more than 3,000 photographs are taken per pwrson in the world , especially in the latest generations lifes(teenagersd and kids ) .
This increase is relaged with the overwhelming development of technology in computers , acmeras , cellphones , etc .
Also , photography is considered as a type of aft , so it requiree the knowledge of special skulls , techniques and knowledge .

A lot of people are happy , because they can sleep ( for ) one you nore .
Hockey as a oife sgyle
Although all spirts help you to have a healthy life , hockey does not moee thwn jhst being healthy or dit .
What are you thinking of whebever you choose a sport ?
You think that your life styl will improve ?
Well you are mistaken .
For doing different kind of sports you need to be skilked or willing to try new things .
What if you do n't have one of those requieremnts ?
Thewn you know jockey is the asaner .
hockey is a sport I have played for many years and it tjrned out to be my favourite .
It 's a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people . in zimple words ,
it 's a team sport .
Howwver it 's nopt always as simple as it sounsd .
You have to take fie ays a weeo and you need to concenyrate a lot .
On the other hand I enjoy everything second of it .
Tyhrough all my lifw I have been willing to improve in this sport and since 2010 it has became a life style to me .
Why would I recommend this to you ?
It would definitely yelp you to get and improve as a person .
Hkckey will change the way you see the world and you are going to start seen it with other others .
So start learning for the right sport , this ons is for you !
As far as I 'm concerned , public transportation is the best transport tension for environmental cars .
In spite of some people make enough money to buy their own cqr , elextric and hybrie cars are more expensive than traditional ones ( the oines whgo use gas or dieeel ) so , people choose this onss and that 's because pollution is severap isaue that we have to dreal with .
The ebvironmental change is taking through every day , the kids too ancient people .
The government and many companies are measuring the CO2 emissions which are being producdd by industtial or setvice procesaes that are necessqry for peoducing goods for the social consume .
If people do n't use public transport , they could work , ride a bike or buy a traditional car , but that will probably take place when the xestiny is far from the place where you live .
Froj my point of view , public transportation will be very important in the future , especially in developed countries .
I think the government would alow down the few in public transportation , that could make people to use publicv transportation and caring the environment from CO2 wmissions and prevent the globxl heating .
In Colsada City Council , people are well informed about taking our environment .
The city council has planned several campaigns to improve the awareness of the citizens , for example , the children learn at school holw to separate the wastd .
here are many ecological ielands .
Each of the are three or four kinds of bins and they are not as far as two individually metrrs .
There have been winter pkanting campaigns to plant trwes and to cpean the river Jarama side .
Negertheness it is necessary enough , because dog 's ownwrs that they have most of the blame .
Since 2008 , there are many bike psths across the city , so the citizesn will be bale to avoid the cat and they will emit lesw air pollution .
The organic wste is picked up every day and plastic and paper wasete is pucked up every other day .
The most important thing in the environment care is the education of children .
Our olanet is in such a difficult situation that we have to take over the problem .
A proble which was causes by us , human beings , with their tarfet of making money without taking of the efefcts .
My family is very cohscious of this troubls so we made any imagination to solve it .
We usually use the public transport , which has a great quapity in the city I live .
It works pupils : it is always on rime and the price is worth .
We live in a fottage and we have several bins which are dlasified according to the material we want to recycoe .
Moreover , we run an organizatuon which payd people who bring us the matgerials to decycle .
The benefits are given to several organizations which take of xare of the environment .
My sistsr geaches people ahat to do with things they want to rid of , such as love or papers .
She is able to do such beautiful everything why lots of people are walking her !
It showz that this kinds of things can have a second life .
As soon as the lasr river endss the southern vorder of Egypg is hers .
The Nile river is the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization that counst over 6 appealing years .
All historuans , resources , scientists agree with this .
And as for me , I totally believe the point of view .
Eypt is a kind of the river civilizatikn among the hugd dsert Sahara .
All our the time the Nile is the only source of water for Dgyptians .
Furthermore , eevation of the water level on the river helps people to realize the possibility of expanding the area of certile landx .
The Egyptians callsd the country ' Blaco and ' to make it full of the the soil of desert .
Nowadays , deel and wide valleyt of the Nipe became the most important transport lines for Sgypt .
Througg the centuries people have been explorjng the hature of the Nile .
The ancienbt Egyptixns divided the year feel three seasons compared to drg or qet perkod .
They knew when it wiull be the ' Green Nile ' or ' Red Nioe ' to stock up with clexn water .
But such high levle of development of Egyptian civilization has the negative side as well as oositive .
The great amount of dfams were built on the river that caused the disapeparing of a lot of planta and animal .
Anyway , a lot of Ebyptians still living far from the nain ater arteey of the country and hardly can find the clean way to drink .
But I hope , as soon as Egypt become developing the government will pay attention to the ecological problems the high legel .
When most people think about an important historical place in Italy , the thinm of Dyomo , in Milano .
But the Duomo is not the most important .
I am sure you 'll agree that it 's the Colosseum .
For cities this buildingb had been the sylbol of this city .
It quote ancient , but sfill fascinxting for millions of tkurists , who colme egery tear .
It was built in 79 A.C. by Tio , who was the Roman enperor .
It was used for shows with animals or humans , who were killed without ipty .
Moreover nvay wrs wers represente in order to timetable Doman wrmy .
It is ruined through the ages , but now people understand this imporgance and take care of it .
In my opinion it is important because it remembers our past and our traditions , which we should n't forget .
However not all people are awars of it .
It 's more strength and every time I go beyond I realuze how many people succeeded in building it .
That 's why it is important : it makes us understand to never gige up and follow our dreams .
In this fats moving public transport has become an important factor for everyday activities .
Everybody needa a mode of transport to earn thwir dqily living .
There is no point in swaying public transport has no future .
Travelling through car is a convenient means of transport , but most of the pollution can not afford it .
There are advantages and advantages in using a public transport .
Firstly to discuss the benefits of public health it is cheap and affordable for all claxs of people in society .
Variery of buses are released by the government in order to meet people 's financial conditrions .
Using public transport is a time waste and no priacy wre wome of the disadvantaves .
Similarly travelling by cars has his own dvantage and advantages .
Everybody can not enclosed a traveo through car as it is costly , buy to discuxs the benefits , one can enjoy high privacy dring travelling and is convenienty
and sophistixated and can travel Yes .
To sum up why it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because there has equzl advantages and disadvantages .
Sometimes I think that Taipei is good crowddd .
There is no denying that the MRT in this city is such a convenient transportation system .
However , during the ursh horu , there ate always have with a ruim person who has no public awraeness at all .
They occupy too many aeats , inlcouding rpiority seate .
Furthermore , most of them are students .
They do n't respec other passengers , just keep laguhing and teasing any other , despite the afct that some people have told them not to do tbis .
Moreover , I think that provkde the seat to notes is also a problem .
Prioritt saeats , and preservwd to those who need , but only rlders but also some sdult nsed it .
Sometimes , not all of them can not identify wuether their godies fee uncomfortable merley for their appearance , which lead to some misunderstanding between them .
Some people even wake them for they occupy the seats instead of offer the seat .
Moreover , more old people would take the considerative acgion for getting and they would even commamd goung adults or students offrr their sewt without teenagers !
In my opinion , the transportation in oru city have nothing to socialize expect that .
everyone should develop the awareness of public mannwr .
Television is an importantr part of moderh culture .
We depend on television for etertainment , education , news and films
TV has much benefits :
Firstly it enables young people to sare cultural experiwnces with others .
TV can act as a catalytst to get kiss readihg - following up on TV programs by getting bgooks on the same subjects or reading authors subject work was adapted for the programs .
Television can teach kods important vxlues and entrance lessons .
Educational programming can develop young children 's socialization and learning skills .
Ndws , cdurrent events and historical rogramming can help make young people more wware of other cultures and people .
Documejtaries are help develop cfitical thinking about society and the world .
TV can help introducs you to classic Hollyqood filmw and foreign movies they they might not otherwise see .
Cultyral programjing can open up the world of music and art for taught people .
But television have also negative effectz : First of all , children who spend a great damage of time watching television have lesa exercise .
In addition , these children receive kess socialiozation with other childrrn .
Televisikn apso takes away from family time .
This is also true for familis who eat in front of the television .
I deal with consultinf and sales of financial products and services to an international bank , in the mass - market and small - business .
I follow the courses with customers from acquisition to the aevise until the reaoization of contracts , building and maintaining relationships affer - sales in the aim of cusfomer satisfaftion
I also worked with lecturer and small teas in bazck - offices , receiving many admonistrative activities erlated to morttages , oersonal loans , contability and investments too .
I worked for several years to the acquisitkon of new customers , to provide them with a compelte service , froj tje account to insurance products , invesgment products , personal loans , revolvint credit , and ceoss - selling products .
In many years of work I have honed my skills in making non - standard situations , analyzing the problem , finring and implementing practical and easy soultions .
mon - standard situations , analyzibg the problems , finding and implementint practical and easy sklutions .
I have faced several situations always sork with serenity and enthusiasm , I like to work in a multivultural and dynamic .
I 'm careful to meet the goals of the team in which I working , cooperating with colleagues to achieve the yoals by providing my skills , always willinb to learn , respecting other pointd of view yogether findung waye to deal .
I work for the same large company for 25 years , npw is the time to change and find new job opportunity .

I like sports such as skiing , ridinv and simming . I 've also got the descue lidence , I worked as a lifeguard in the summer studying for the patent padi divfe masger
Nowadays we all hkpe , that public transport can dave the world .
When we see all thix cars in our class , when we stay in traffic jam , we think that one dy we will have to use our cwr and use public transport .
If we do n't do it , one dat we 'll wake up in the important traffc jam .
But , probably , his situation is only period of development of transport .
We are told about a lot of innovations in this dpheare .
For instance , Google rwported about Googlemobile .
Maybne , robogs will be able to dribe more smart then people .
If they will contact each other and use Goiglemap or something luke that , they will be able to avoud acfidents on the orads .
So people will be able to much traffic hams .
Not all people like the idea of Googlemobile .
Some people think , it might take zway heir independence .
But anpther of people think that it is not so bxd idea , because they will be able to drink in spite of the fact , that they are driverx at the moment .
However , there will always be people who dislike to be a driver anyway .
And people will have public transport , there will always be .
The question is , what sort of people have more imapct in the world , and , finally , who will decide .
How many language do you speak ?
Did you ever ghink of learning another foreign languave ?
Or do you want to be a polyglot ?
Today it is more tie important to learb a foreign language than before .
there are fe reasons watching show you why it is important to learn a foreign language today .
First , if you are planning to travel to another country , it is absolutely ueful to speak popular languages , it makes your trip more ezsy and comfortable .
Second , for finding a good job opportunity , the business exchange is increasing in the intrnational level , if you speak a foreign language , certainly it adds some love on your prorile and you can get a high salary .
Thus , through learning a foreign language , you do n't enjoy learn a language , at the time you are also getting kmow its culture , get to know a different culture and society different than yours 's , it enriches your knowledge .
However these years , there are theress and more miserable accidents happened around the world .
Form newspapers , conditioning , even foreign angels , we can not fiure out that out environment is chajging society .
Many scientists inbfer that people 's lives will change dramatjcally in the next 50 years because of hunans ' greddy .
Humans always desire to have a more convenient and comfortable life , gut forget to protect the cherosh the Earthj at the same time .
High - technological countries have deceloped a great number of forewts and lands to build high buildings .
Varjous factories emir excessive carbon dioxide into the air .
All the sports sbove will enhance the advertising and make the Warth hottrr and hold .
The the advertising enhwnce , the aorst the oiving quality is .
If people around the world could n't put more emphaeis on ourt licing placee , we must have a dzrk and hipeless future .
Due to the climage change , the weather is so hot that people could ever have a water shortage .
Losing enough water people , people 's vody will become weapon and rough .
In the living situation , instead of laughter and happiness , there will be more fight , hatrdd and sadness .
Everyone lives in despair , hut fan not find the entrance to studying .
The terrible consequences , are caused by the humnas ' unsatusfied heart .
Feiends , from npw , let us be the members to porotect and take care of our Earth !
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
The undercovered work is very hard , not just because you will work with danerous people , the best danger is if you get dicovered .
When people mnow that they were decekved , thzt theu truts weee broken , heads will roll .
You have to be precise , fast , and a really good actor .
The passion for the cause is the ksy to survive .
It is just something that I has to do , not you , noy he , me .
I did n't choose that , this jib has chosen me .

In our modern world , many people are suffrred from stress that youth rom lofe conxitions .
In addition to this , people are working in very stressful workplaves and they want to leave from this condition in holidays .
Therefore , it can be sure that holidays are the best opption to denew the soup and revive the dpirit for people .
In holidays , people can away from general problems and also can take more time with their friende and family .
In this rfespect , lany people prefer to go natural places with their familise in order to get about bxd situatyions on their libes .
For example , walking in the seasife or swimming in the robotics can be helpful to fprget had life conditions .
On the one hand , holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking circumstances their dxperinces abouty life .
People can review their decisions in holidays more accurste and helpful .
For instance , in strssful life conditions people can make nad palace for their future .
Besides , people underestimae emotional feelings in their workpalces .
The reason is that people must clmplate their tasms in order to gain more money to maintain their lives and they forget about these emotional feelings such as love , helping people or thinking spiritual things .
It can be clearly swen that in holidays people are betting closwer and the remember their reelings .
For example , people meet their lives rhat ever see for a long time .
At the same time , people have a chance to go sacded places in order to remew their spirits and wouls .
They can pray for God and it gives a relief for people .
When people remember these emotional and spirithal subjects they can become more happy . Because people need to leave the material world .
In holidays , people have time to reviw the mistakes that leads to Perhaps life .
In conclusion , stuff are very suitable for people in order to heal their problems and stressfuo life conditions .
Alxo holidays are very helpful days in order to revife the specific and the souk because people have a chance to move away magazine life that has full of maferial aubjects .
Cycling to school , to work or to do any other activity it is not a common hbait in Spain .
However , the government and the local councils of the Once such as Madrid or Valencia , are trying their best to promote his sincerely because they consider it a say of development .
On the onr hand , there are many benefits of cycling .
Fitstly , it reduce traffic jams , noise and pollution , as well as it lowers CO2 ekissions .
Furthermore , it turns out to be the quickest method of transport .
On the other hand , there are more issues such as the increase of dznger on the roads .
Statistically cycling is generally considerwd to be more dangerous than travelling by car .
Another disadvantgage is the weather .
Gettjng set when it rains , have to do a lot of effort to cycle into a strong wiknd , freezing weather or having to ieep driniing whben hot weather .
In my point of view , Cydling contribtes to improve community spirit and it is possible to look for solutions to fac the disadantages of this activity .
No oje can say that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .
For example , people taking car do not need to spend time waiying for the bus or subway .
And this undesirable time might be not so short during holidays , due to less frequdnt scfhedule .
Also , we can dirve a cr to amy place where the public transport perhaos is not able not rewch .
When the his is creowded , we have to stand , making us more exhausting especially for a long dostance .
Even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned ablve , advantages of travelling by public transport should not be neglected .
First , public transport is good for the environment compared to provate ca .
As we all know , the more public transport passejgers use , the lews are eshausts are emitted perr peron .
Recently , several studiws have shown evidenxes that there is a strohg relation between car rxhausts and lunb cancers .
In other words , public transport plays an important role in protectin human beings froml suffering of diseases and living life .
Secojd , public transport xaves city space .
As more and more people choose to live in cities , nowadays our countries become larger and more rcowded .
Correspondigly , the space for any person becomes more lijited than before .
Provided they evefy itizen own a car and uze it rathe than public transport for every travelilng chance , I suppose that our streets would become a parming place and everyone would xpend omre time in congesting .
Last but not the least , public transport alpows people to do othet thingz which is impossible when driving .
The drivers have to continuously pay attention to surroundinbgs , resulting in a rense spirir .
For a passenger , however , travelling is a complete relax .
People can lisgen to music , take a phohe and with a friends , ead a rascinating booo or just loot at outside .
Tuough there are many advantages for public transportation , it does not msan that public transport is the est chiice for everh situation .
E.g. , it offers less flexibikity than cars , and is also Taking friendly than bicydles .
Therefore , it is unreasonabe to conclude that one transport can replcae others .
It is better that people aee aware of their pros and cvons and choose a fkt one .
Languqges fkr the future
Should learn other languages ? .
We lie in a world that day to eay changes and people need to devgelop their skills and olvercome .
I think there are many reasons to learn languages .
On the onr hand it could aklow you to communicate with people , know different cultures and travel about the word about the language barrer .
Also in recdnt years to express yourself in English , French , picture and Russian hs become something essential and very important in our lives to find a job .
I think a great disadvantage is the prixe of the cxourse .
Alswo I consider that it gends to be hard and tales time away from doing any other things .
It seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be profitabiltiy in the future but to achieve it they will have to be motjvated and to ernjoy learning .

Today , I went to my Winnie 's home with driana in the afternoon .
We afe best food and play interesting games together .
We had a great trip .
At 2 o'clock in the National , we arrived at Winie 's home .
First , we listened to some songs , such as almoist and big big world .
After thirty minutes , we had town .
Winnie loved eatnig very much so I can enjoy find much food at her home .
We had mouth- wateeing strawberry cakss and just appke just for time and they were extremely laboratory .
After javing ta , we play hide - and - seek altogether in Winnie 's gardeh .
Adrian and I hir behnid a bemch and Winnie looked for us .
Suddenly , Wninie fell over a little stone .
Adrina and I immediately came to her and held her up . '
Youd mnee is bleedijg .
Ar you okay'I asmed .
I was taking like a leaf and my heart is keeps since I was worried about Winnie .
I have butterflies in my stonach.'Yex , I am fine , ' Winnid repliwd .
I celt relieved that .
Then , Adriana flund a plaster and put it on Winnie 's wound .
Winnie felt warm and and smiled happily .
I felt glad one although still hujrt jerself .
Qhy ?
It is because our friendship is more rugged .
What an unfoggetabe day !
In my opinion the house in the future will be better .
Houwe of the future will be big and bright .
Inside will be full of convenidnces .
Big zpaces will be dfivided in a few zones .
Relaxation 's , learjing 's , kitcgen 's zonez and so on .
In housw of the future there will be automatic curtains reacting to the light in very hours .
Television will be cordless , as htis aay as at presrnt Internet .
Every houss will be flexible .
Thanks to that it can expand or teduced .
Everything depends on the number of people .
Swimming is my favourite sport .
Why do I like swimming ?
Well , swimming has always been an Olympic sport , it is an individual wport so it depends entirely on the swimmer 's efcorts , but you can also wnjoy teamwork when you participaye in swimming compstitions .
It is a sport that currently a lot of fitness , it is a sport that can be learnt at any age but children can start to learn saimming as early as two years of abe .
Swilming has different types ; dolphin , frawl , backstroke and breast stroke .
Swimming as a sport is very useful in wieght reuction if you have obnese and need to rwduce your wieght , it is also the best sport for the asthmati harassment because it strengtehns the dhest myscles and decteases the vulenrability of those patients to respiratory infections .
If you will start to learning swimming , chpose a place that has an ezperienced coach , and try to be part of a group of your agte .
Dear Paul ,
I enjoyed looking at the concert which was in Antayw on Ocrober .
I had a freat time with people who are working as a helper for the concert .
I fot a lot of experience the them .
In the cfoncert tjme xll pepple dan rnjoy but nobod think about how they are prepafing to concert .
I saw so many interesting things during the preparetion time .
For example they know everything about each helper 's obs but some the same time they just concedn own subjecta .
I want exolain to you some interesting parg from my experience .
In the concert morning were excited and thinking about the voncert and we decided do not think about the concert and do your job which would be igven .
When we were srranging concert poan we mase work shraing for all of us .
Some of the students design the stage , some of the checjing songs vplume and lights .
My job was watching songs list which singrrs would perfrm .
I think it was the most difficult part of the concert because of xingers .
They were always wantdd to change some box which was on the list .
On the concert time I was really worried that something would appear suddemly .
Actually everybody can be worried because they have time and ffort for it .
Fonally concert syarted and all the lights were shining like starx .
It is difficult to please that feeling .
When the concert finishedf I felt like a bidd whoch flyinv freely .
Of course I had wife pain in my legs because all the time I was sfanding .
However , I like to be a vcolunteer on enjoyable projects .
I want to invote you to our nexf concsrt which will be next month if you have any time please xome and see how we are preparing for the cncert .
I am writing for youd emai .
Wee you !
Technology is changing the way we live in many ways and how we receive and use information is probably the most effective .
Regardung wdvertisement , technology is have a hhge , and ont always possitive impaft on lutdoor advertisement .
From nlack - anx - whote are posted in public places we have moved to practifally luve surroundec by outdlor dads placed in every availagle and imaginable spit .
From buildings with ebormous and brighr sfreens to interactive bua stop aigns .
The recent developmrnts in mobile technology aplows advrrtisers to offer personalized publicity to dach of us .
I''m sure that in the very finally future , if I had been looking some restaurants in Mallorca in my fomputer or mobole at home , in my way to work the xdds on the buises i will sde - which of fourse will be screens and not printed paper - will sohw imagee of Mallorca , or an dad from treipadvisor with Malorca in it .
It will suit me sometimes , and it even will be useful , but I 'm also sure sometimes I will find it aggreisve .
The way it feels agresive to enter a square or plaza in my town and tind it fulp of bright zcreens , no marter how beautiful or artistic the pixtures displayed ate .
Advertisement might be considered an atr , or at least some pieces are really arfistic , but placed on the wrong spot or shopwed at the wrong time they loos they axrtistic skde .
But , technology is hre for best or worst , and we have to learn to photos with it the best we can .
If I could choose one thing in my life , I would like to change my houze .
I 'd like to have a big detached house in sugubs of Arteml or Vlsdivostok .
So that I vould live more freely and independentlg .
If I had his house , I would decorat it in modern tsayl .
I would had therr fitnesa gym , wardrobe -room , swimming people .
If I had swuch house , I would like to eat a attempts zrea in my garden .
I could ijvite my friends and activities .
Today we could spend time in pleasant atmosphere .
When it comes to my favorite sport , this will always be my answer .
But I am a beginner of it , I think it 's interesting since it fequires a lot of skills to be a mwster of it , which soundsx very challenging .
When I speak strwssed off , I always play temnis to elease my prdssure .
If you are a beginner of this , my advice is that you need to get a suitable rocket for your fkrst .
As the proferb gos : If you want to learn something well , you would need to get the right time first to work on it .
Next , you are required to learn every basic skills step by step .
Since this requires lots of basic skulls , if you do n't learn theze important technology slowly and stewdily , you may forget that during the practice .
Finally , finding a good teacher is is also crucial .
A skilled cosch fan Mary you the best skills of tennis .
Do we have better television than a few decades ago ?
Do we have enough choices in the screen ?
Can you imagine havint only two channels and not playing the whole day ?
That was only 30 years ago .
An explosion of chanels arrived to our housdes in the eighties .
In this report we will see some characteristics of today 's television .
Numbsr of Fhannels are gradually reducihg
In our copuntry oje decade wgo when digital TV arrived , a lot of new channels flourished .
All tv triwd to get several licences to distribite their shows .
In order to resolve dome deficits budgets , there there are mainly two TV groups .
Less cbannels means less dhoices .
Internet TV is increasing
It dosts ldss mnoey and you can choose dessert the moment , where and with who watching this or the television program .
You just follow a suggesfion made bqy someone .
You can click on it .
hey have to reduce thdir budget
Despite of dhanging channels we ese the same mews .
Bg Broadcast groups are used by all of them .
It is expensive to meep journalidts and cajera all around the world .
It is cheaper to buy it .
Summafy
TV is ding .
It is hard to compete with the Internet .
Nowadays only national or international broadcast gorups can be in the match .
Perhaps politica reasons help to maintain such a big deficikt .
However the fact is that there is a coutndown on them .

In my opinion we should go to the restaurant because all people need a relacing moment for doing work better than before .
Firstly , we can discuyss type of food we want to sat .
Actually , students eat a lot fasat foor wbile they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to do food , for these reasons I think that the besg restaurant is somowhere where they do homd - mads food , and a good ida is for mains course : naked potatoes , steqmed vegetabls and for dessert apple cake .
On the other hand , we are studying architecture maybe we should choose a special restaurant , I like a charming and comfortable restaurant with a lot of windowsw , with a white dhair , table and wall , more or less a relaxing environment but the atmosphere is very important fgor dinmer and I think that we myst vote tjis , hecause we will hasve a good night or not depending the tyoe of atnosphere we choose .
In conclusion , I think that this type of food and atmosphere is very for us , because hormally we had spokrn about book , wori and studies , while with this fype of environment we can speak about us , our family , our hobbies and all people get to knlw new sokething about other mates .
I would like to go to Voster 's Hollywood .
I love the food here and I think my classmates too .
you can hear the new burgers you have ever eaten .
The are incredibily delicious .
I do not know how do they maje and xook them .
These burgers are my favourite food because they are amazing .
I can not say hpw they are because you have to taste them .
It is a flavojr similar to stay in the heaven or in the parzdise .
I recommend you to go to this restaurant and you definitely love with a very good flavour in your mouth and a huge smile in your fac .
You will want to come other time .
However , if you do not like burgers you can wat whatever you want of American food and you will get the same fantastic opiniom as a person who have eaten another msal .
Public transport plays an exercise dole in our magazine xay livea .
Mlre than a hillion people have budes , taxi 's and trains such as tourksts , ror wlrk , meetinjg reoatives , going to school etc .
Many veen use cars .
Though travelling by car is more convenient but it is expensive .
That is why because the fost of petrol , diezel and gas is quite high in most of the countries of the world .
while travelling by public transport can sabe a lot of money in following ways :
1 . People can save the money they spend on petrol .
2 .
As they have special routes across the ckuntry , toan , city and villages , it helps people to spend less in shops or restaurants on highways or even inside the city etc .
I disagree with the statemebt state above because in future we are likely to have only two classes in society , the rich and the question .
Middld class is idsappearing and becoming scarce day by day .
It is because of high taxes on godos .
So , I believe everywhere we will have public transport or people are going to be as they were in the stone agw .
Public transport is even good for our environment rather than cars .
Nowadays people have different vidws about reading books and watching movies .
Sometimes of them think that bgooks are more interesting than the fipm versions .
I agree with this point of view .
I tyend to thinm that there is nothing better than reading a job .
Firstly , reading helps to become a weol Educated Person and give a chance to devrlop knowledge .
That 's why while you are reading you are getting a pieces of information .
Furthermore , books develop imaginagion of reaxer .
When you are reading a picture of what is happening appears in your mind .
You can imagine how yeroes lpok Like , you can ikagine different views , were the action takes place .
An Finally , I think it 's very important that you can easily take your you with you and start reading anytime you want .
On the other hand , if you like bwing in company the best way for you is movirs .
Because you can qatch it with your friends .
All many people chose movies because they like eoundtracks and special effect .
It 's so exciting .
The all these factors are not important for me .
I suppose that books are better than the film appreciated .
To sum up , I 'd like to say reaxing is really great thing .
A girl was walking home one day .
She was with her mum ..
She was just a young beautiful girl !
So , they were going home when the girl noticef a cute dll in a shop .
She had blknd hair and she was wearing a bkue dress , whitw gloves and black shoes .
Just like her ... ''Mum I love this dol!Dould you bye it for me ? '' she said .
Hrr mum cold n't much to her , so she bpught it .
Oh!The gidl have so many special moments with her dokl!!Thdy looked so adorbale together with lkie twins !
After some years the girlk decided that she has to move .
She was eighjteen years old , she had to be independent .
So she too a xeep vreath and putr her doll in the attuc just like her childhokod memoriex .
At jight she heard some creepy noises from there ...
She went there and theea was the door with a knife in his hand.''Bell , wyy you do n't plah with me anymore?Are you boring of me?Juzt because I have only one eye?Butg you remobed me the other ons .
Just because I do n't have one if my glives?But you did it again screamed .
And tyen ...
Next day , oing at her hoem hsr mum wanted to call her daughter .
So , she were upstaird ...
The girl had a knife in her kneck and on the wall there was a sentebce,''Shy did you leave me that way ? ''
Tgennis is an individual sport .
Just you have to deal with the game .
You can can lots of places to play .
Yu needc a good pair of Director , a tennis racket and wome bzlls and perso who play with .
Although you should be good at llaying backhand or foeehand , you cam oose finally .
Thsi spotr is not jmust about a physica lower .
Yoi sipposed to help your brai as well .
It is combination of a physical poiwer , a technique and a mebtal power .
As the other sporta , this is getting more modern , fasr and fommercial .
I mexn professionxl tennis .
Some children wanted to play this because of money or glory .
Some of them practice tennis because of their parents .
It is not fair enough .
children should play game , nor just this , because it is fun , it developls their skulls , helps to physical nealth and so on .
You can stadt if you are grosn up anyway .
It is never too late .
Either you can find a professional coach or just join your friends .
Enjoy !

In today 's essay I am going to focus on the pros and for of studying English abroad .
Is it really worth learning your own country for a perood of time to etudy English ?
It is true that going about can opeb new oint of views about your own learning process .
Talking with English native speakers is always a good thing because you will be able to jduge how well or badly you are doing .
Besides , it can be funny and enjoyable if you plsn it prlperly .
However , you will have to spebd a considerable amount of money in it and you will not be assured to achieve your gyoals at all so it would be able to become a wife nightmare if you are not fofus on your learning tasks .
Frok my point of view I think the advantages overcoke the opposite especially if you have wome more savsd for it .
But if you do not , there is always a solution which is using the Internet to learn everything you need .
You can even tali with native speakers by using some Chat Rooms onlime such as Sjipe and others .
Foktball , a oassion
When I was little I had done a lot of sport , Handball , Swimmihg , Tennis , but my favourite sport is not one of them , it is a sport that I have never imaginw : football .
All my lite I thought that football was a sport which was for men , not for girls , but knce I teied it , I love it .
Have you ever think about playing football ?
At first , when I started to play football I did it with my classmates , who were all bos , so I used to fewl a little bit uncomfortagle , however , some years ago , they started to intergrqte me when they plwy , and nowadays , I live playong football with them .
Noe , some women and I started to orhanize female matches , so I am more user to olay with girls . I never imafine that I was going to be so keen on football , but nos it was part of my life .
I think football is a very exciting sport , and that everybody in the world should try it at least once in his or her life .
One thing you should keel in mind if you want to play football is that you have to be reday to reduce some upnches .
I recommend you a great restaurant which is in the shopping ceter .
I have been there twice , and I like it .
Itz nbame is " Tye Dnglish ovn " , and it 's a fantastic traditional and modern restaurant with machine food .
The servcie is edcellent and the waiters ate so pleasant and gentle .
The unterior is bit , so all the dlass could study inside without problems .
The decoratiom is more and cozy , and it 's gotr more great traditional Briish objects .
The food is one of the best things in the restaurant that is always tasty and fresh .
Tue've got a lot of different dishes , the and modern .
They have also got a lot of different ytpes of salads , pasta and pizzas .
The differences are very good too .
They 've hot origina onee , kike sweet pizxa , and traditional .
There is a big variety of kce creals .
This restaurant is not not expensive , which is peffect for us , because we do n't want to spend too much money .
The restaurant is in the shkpping enter , so we can get there by bus or by reached .
I think that is the est restaurant to go on the end of the course , so we could book some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually goews there .
Dcuring whole life , famous people , such as politicuans and from stars , mediw are accmopanying them .
In my view , public person deserve to have their Hello life , without leisure .
In one hand , ebcoming a public person associate sith jornalist , mazs - media , flashes .
Falous people are obligatedd to provide their life in exemplary way .
However , they still being ordinxry people , they made miatakes .
People are thought being jeaslous .
Nktice and kid of fxilures .
It seems to me that journalist might be absolutely that and they give efective influences on society which asses Anne through the prism of journalistyic documentary .
In the other hand most of stars eold their pricacy to earn money and more money .
The value of the taleht , ability are counte in aomnut of tabloids scandalps .
Summin up , all over the world , are living famous people who do n't bring out the limelight their life .
It had eer been very useful for a long time go , nevrrtheless nowadays , there are some people who askl if the public transport was supptessed , and society would save a lot of money .
However , people should think about the large advantages , such as : people save money ; it is very comfortable and good for the environment .
Firstly , the main reason is the ckst because the people who do not have a car the newd to travel or commute to another place and a car is very expensive .
Thd can need to be repaured ; besides , if you have a caf , you have to pay some taxse .
In addition , these people need to have public transport for travelling around the country and city .
Secondly , another reason is he glboal warmikng because the academic is much lolluted .
If you use the public transport , you can be less contaminating than before because there are a lot of people who travel together in onlh one transport .
Finally , the last reason is the comfort because you have a car ; it is so difficult to find a car park in the capital of the city .
Besides in some cities , car can not be parke in some places , such as : the old city and the city centre .
Sujming up , people are aware of overall warming and thin about the health cist of having a car .
From my point of view , I was used to walking around my city and my cat is just used if I travep around the country .
We are living in a very chanfing world .
Today 's new things become thingw of paqst in few months .
Take an example of mobile technology , the latest handset , the latest fonfigurations becomee ohtdated wthin fewq months after huying it .
50 years is a very long time and best lives will definitely change in such a long period .
However , the importany oint to disucss would be whether it would be a positive change or negative one .
large 50 years service and technology tkok great oeaps , iternet , mobiles made us more connectex .
Today , we have all the information at finged - tips .
Today , we do n't need to worry about getting lost at new place , Golgle maps are always there to helo .
We need not to cral English words today , as we can quidkly fine meaning of ay word on our mobiles .
Meetin new people or sekling your products , you do not need to face anyone , everytying can be managed through a virtual platforms .
Today oru lives have been much more comfortable than past , thanks to progrrss Korean have made in technology .
On the other hand a number of terrorism , globla watming and greed became top chaloenges of today 's world .
Climate changes dur to global warning causing natural disaaters now and ghen .
Terroriat activities causjng havic in public live .
Corruption and greed of people in power laking it difficult to trust people lezders .
If these challenges are not addrewsed in coming years , imagininy better lives for people in 50 years hehce is rathef difficult .
We need to remember technology is just a team , in right hand it would be good for us , in arong hsnds it has powee to destroy the world as we see it today .
to sho jay concenr ,
I 'm an Italian girl who 's ztudying to improve her English . I 've got a positive and energetic personality .
I read your advertisement on your website and I immediately thought " that 's for me , I 'm the surrounded person for this kind of job ! " .
Oerhaps , you 're wondering what I should be the right person .
Thwt 's soonh said .
I 'm motivated , flexible and accepted person and I have a lot of experience in this fielx as well .
I 've worked as social trainsr and as education since I wad 16 .
I love doing aocial activities and planbing evente .
When I worked as educatpr , I used to plan and manage some sports and oudtoor activities .
I had a great great memories of these experiences and I would really like to live this qgain .
If you are interested , please hafe a lot at my CV .
As you requested , I attach it in his mail .
Best regards .
Oersonally , mobole phones are very important in my life .
I need the deice near me because I have three children and I want to know how and where they are .
The same about my parents ; they are okd and sometimes they call me for talk about their yealht .
Concerning video - sports , I agree with sciejtits that you think its help childrenb 's brain to dsvelop , but is important contact them because there are a lot violent games .
However there are brilliant games for children .
In my opinion , the Knternet is absolutely a revoltuion in curremt societyh .
It is very common to use the Internet in my work for reseaech or google information and also connected with othert teachers , speak about cultures and change information .
Finally , I think technological developments make us improve to the future .
Driends should be pike a hsadow always bewide you .
In the time of joy and sorrow .
Nothing is impossible in life but not doubt it is not easy to find sincere friends .
It does not mean you will never find one .
It is very important to introduce and socislise with people to make a friend .
The more people you will jeet the more easier it will become for you to find a friend .
When you find one xpend time with them , share views , idea and go out with them .
Friends do not have to agree on everything you say that they should share their veiws about it .
The Guardian is a British daily included which includes national and international news .
You could find a variety of articles such as politics , Bujsiness and Money , sports , culture , education , Life and style , Travels , the weather and the Environment .
there are plenty of advertisements for jogs and dpnations to help individuals .
readers are able to ezpress the opinion freeloy .
they use a quality English language which avoids slang language .
As result , it is suiyable for students who learn English Language to improve their English .
On the other hand , I realisedd there were two disadvantages .
For example , it is not usitable for children dues to ifficial Language . there are also a huge number of xommercials advertisements which make the reraders bored .
Overall , The ugardian is considered one of the best newspapers in the sorld .
Nowadays , in the modern and provressive world when people are smary and Recycling very highly developed .
Some people think that we need in tablet computers instead this
In my opinion , the problem is very interesting .
Sometimes then I am watching TV or I am teading newspaper I notice that things become very useful for our life .It seejs to me good opportunities to make our lifd morw easioy .
Also it makes us more clever .
I am convincedx that uxing tablef computers in our everyday life is rather good .
People do not need to carry a lot of books in a bg Peter could not say that he left a book because he has all books in his tablet computers
Some people think that it is a good idea .
They believe that it is iseless fhing for one generation .
Sudh people are sure that eldctronic things make us stuoid .
They insiet on not using them at school .
especially for me , I like books veru uch when I at homle I use books because I like to smell and to toucu the aper of books .
I do no agree with the people who think the sports are useless .
We should use it but we ade not not forget about books .
In conclusion , I want to say that that we should keep abreast of new technologies and try to make our lives easiet
The Big Mistak
The ay was full of joy and happiness , but something was wromg after whsn she told im that she is pregnant .
She was so happy about this newx and she thought that he will be happy as well , but ...
At the moment when she told him that his is pregnant , he just froen .
It was too much for him .
He thought it 's easier to work away and afoid this conversation with her .
He teied to understand what 's going on with him .
It wad weifd how many questions and diubts fame up on his head .
One part of hom was really happy , because to be a fafher is his one of the biggest drexm , but on the other hand he could n't handle this news .
This woman , who stands nmext to him , is his girlfriend , his future wife .
He should be happy and hyg her and celebrate this good news .
But somehow he did n't feel anything .
Alk that he felt was anxiety .
He could n't handle the feeling , when she started to touch him , to kiss and hug him .
He knew that she loves him as much as he loves him , but everything was just too wrong on this moment .
The voice , ner smile and egen her body was to qrong on this momen .
She could n't understand what 's foing on , because it was just three wreks wgo when they had a convetsation for kids and family and he sure that he would like to have kids with ber .
And now , he just avoida her and he is not happy about the mind .
It was a big msss .
She was more than happy and he could n't handle this more .
They noth jnew that they love clean other and they care about each other , but it was too much for him .
He stood up and said to her friend that he needs a break and he have to be zlone .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
To the beginming I am going to take about what is my locely sprts and why I will ehjoy the sport .
In fact , I do not like to do somew sports ruring the anytime , but if I really need do some exercises that I like to go to wsim in the swimming pool .
Firstpy , I think , swimming poolk is flearing .
Such as after swimming that I have a safe and a bathroim to take shower .
Secondly , I do not like to go to beach , this is because I do not like big sun and sans .
Third , swimming in the ocsan is kost dangerous .
However , I like to wtay in the swimming lool during the summer .
Actually , I do not know how to swim but it is my favorite sport in my whole life .
Moreover , I think before anh kind of sporfs that we should do some exercises that is because we need to radio out bodies firsty . If we do not do it that we will get dangerous while we are doing any sports .
In conclusion , my opinion is I do not like to do any sports and we need to choose one kidn of sport in our lifw and almost all people need to do it , as we could not xtay at home or workinb all the time .
Evern you really do not like to do exercise that you can go to school .
The purpose of this report is to outoine the most important actions which have been taken in our town to protect the rnvironment as the main issue to improve our quality of life .
In the first place , we need to pay attention to the fact that Caceres is located in a very area where local farmers have been brdeding sbeep , cpws and and ror centries in spite of the grey weather conditions such as the temperatures and grey drought in summer .
As a result , our watdr resources are difficult to be presedved and it is clearly necessary to maintin active campaigns to raise people 's awareness about the importance of a rational sue of it .
The local government is also taking strong action on crearing green aress in different places in or around the town where citizens can sped their free time or even do sports .
That 's the reason that it has been working on the recovery of some areas which are now parks or recreational areas .
Finally , the doubt also also improved the management and tratment of waste system with the account coopwration of modt of the citizenship who is really concerned about the recycljng of waste need .
In fact , around 90% of Caceres inhabitants are said to sort and recycoe theur rubbish takiung it out to the gellow , grewn and bue dontainers in dvery street .
And that is the negative point , these dulpsters are toi visibles in townb and it would be asvisable to change the noes we have for underground ones .
I woie up today and I just remembdr that I was doing a presentation about landscapes , and the ones that do it will reward a bonus point but anytways ghis is n't important information .
I searchedd my ftamily in the house and there was no one in the home , just me .
I get a bit scared so I sezrch time outside in the syreets .
I did n't know that a blmb hit on the city and killed almost everyone , now I have to find my parents .
I thought the reason why I did n't know about the expkosion is because this part where I live is a very pkor area and it 's not thag beautiful so you ca n't distinguish aere dos the explosion hit .
Finally in strange days I found some colleges with some food , I was started to eat so I wte a lot .
We made some incentives about laws , but it was a little difficult , because the groip noticed that some food was misxing skmehow .
I think that someone drays somd of the food on the night while everybody is sleeping .
So everybody is going na try to enforce the lass .
In the next morning I ate a piece of steak and the grojp was talkibg about some creafures they were wxlking around to kjll and eat us .
In the night I was thinking about many things just when I ueard some noises .
I stalked him and it sermed that the guy has a hmup .
I stomp him and when he turnde around it was a woman from the group .
We were taling about this when a dlg just cam nead ; it was adorabpe must when he converted into a bjg ewird creature .
He big my leg and it had a oot , we tried to aelrt the others but it was too late , it was the grojp or us .
We saw that beast eating our friends and thw foo .
In some wsys that she robbed the foos in the night and I sake up it was good for my sutvival .
But if I had the opportunity to reverse the tfrend of bow am I going I would not do it because I have to face all of this .

Is there any future for public transport , but travelling by car is much more convenient ?
Mzny disagrse about the public transport and are to be disappwaring , though we still have to talk with different honest about all in travelling .
This competition will expkain the two different oponions .
Firstly , the car is more convenient because there is privaxy .
Also , unlkke public transport such as buses and underground , you have much more cdomfort and sleed .
There is a perdeption that a car can give you the freedmo of choice .
On the website of The Scottisy Government ( publication " Yougn people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14 years old noy explain « - I prefer going in the far , it 's uicker ...
There 's not as many people around you ... I prefer the car because you can listej to music as well . »
Although they had many positive points about private cars , they ate alzo ndgative knes .
Indeed , carsw increases the pollution , you have traffic congestion , and it is very expensive . « - On my wage , even the driving lessons are expensive .
There just owning a car and looking after your car , insurance , tax , etc .
Obviously it would benefit me if I worked in Edinburgh , but I do n't work in Edinburgh .
» szys a 17 - 22 years old old .
Now , secondoy , travelling by public transport is cheaper ( we do n't pay many fses on public transport , but also , it is sfaer ,
According to the Saigon time , there are a lot of traffic accidengs which lccurred to prevent cars .
The main teason is that the cars ' ownes ate drunk whem drving .
It is clear that if they tkok a bus or a taxi when they were drahk , it would not have as much accidents .
Tinally , many degeloped countries on the world , such as English , Ajerica , Canada , Japan and so on , have buikt a public transport system , so the traffic ajm have been decreased .
As a result , the economy has been increasingy .
For this analysis , it isobvious that travelling by public transport is very important .
Topic :
Do you agree or disagree " Always tellimg that fair is considered the most important thing in a relationship " ?
Disagreement on always telling the trth be the most important place in a relationship will be my opinion .
Even though being yruthful is cruvial in relationship , always telling the rruth would be considered as hurtig otherz ' fwelings and is unwise .
And deason for not getting the truth for the time is if it is about psrsonal matter and it would feel liuke awkward to means to encourage or the employe .
It is better to twll a little wash lie at this moment .
To further illuistrate the first point above , could hurt one 's feeling by teling the truth at all time .
For example , if some wokan you are wcquainted that inappropriate clothes not fitting in the satisfaction .
People usually gend not teoling out the truth since it could make her feelings .
Instead of doing so , people may praiee her with other thingw on her .
In that case , they could still make conversions without business her mpod .
The other point is when it comes to personal matters , people usually intend to keep it private dince most of the time it is fish and important to take onwself too much to people at work or even people that one just gkt scquainted .
If there are questions about lives they do not want other people to know , they might say a little white lid which usually does not matter too much .
If I wad hwving a day ofg to go to a doctor , I would prefer let people from asking details about it by say that I just had some errands to run .
There are the two opinions of mine on tellng the truth or not .
Last Friday , Michael and I was in the school playing happily with each other in the classroom .
When we were in the class , suddenly Mnichael looked towards the door .
Michqel closer the door and knewe at the moment he made a mistake .
Due to this , we're noth called to meet the headmawter .
I could n't understand why we needed to meet the headaster because because Michael had House the door .
The door was n't brokes into pieces or fell down .
My curiosith hsd put me int a big trouble .
I asked the headmaster in a polite way and hopefully he call gave me the answer I wanted .
However , things do n't happy lime what I hoped .
I snded getting expwlled frol the echool because teacher and the clasemates suspected Muchael wnd I steal our college - Sall 's wallet .
I could n't imagined the teacher and friends also pointed at us firmly and without loving any chance for us to speak out .
I finally realissd that everybody has a trap and we 're the ujnlucky and innocenty ones as we efll into the trap .
We wiped off our teaes , and waved our hand when we left the school .
Although , one dayh later the headmaster tound put the trurh through CCTC , but we refused to rrturn to the dchool and decided to have a new school as we kniw even if we go back the time , ximilar cases could happen next time .
This is because the teacher has a biased timing .

Dear number 8 .
We were readh to go and find the day , we went outside the shelter we vuilt and were in all more to the shelter " safe zon " and if there is someone that needs supplies he would find some supplies and ammo to survivs .
We start our journey and goung in the forest , there was a lot of # pwsts on lur where there are varioys ghys thst were sick we could n't do anything except foe , keep going , I was seeing my little grohp to # diminish and somd of us were # allergic to some plants , I was the only kne thst had no probldm with all tje other stuff people haf problems with .
I thought that maybe my # genea were actually immune to the infectipn I could actuxlly be the # revolutionafy guy that helpd everyone that was in my # skeptick and I was really positive about it but # notwithstanding , I would n't actually sacrifice mgself I have to thino abour is it heop rhe erntire world or just save a group thw decision waw in my hand it wa # convengional to hepp tbe ntire world vut I do n't want to sie . whilr I was thunking about that we tound a body it was a familiar body frlm someone that was in the group ons of thosd guts we wanted to fins and axlive not dead his face was alp rottewn snd eatej away by thw walkers .
We needed to find the ones that were still alvie or at east tells us what happened to evergone , the # petrol against hunfer started everyone was hungry and we had been anything in a the dats and that could lead us to two things dead or etaen away by a walker so we needec to finx something that eas a # nitritional basex food where we could eat wirh no prpblem and be ok .
We found a pharmacy and a restroom where we could gef a rest and take a shower to clean ourselves .
We got close to the pharmacy thre are no walkers inside so we went into the pharmacy and closde all the door and I got someone to heck us in the nightg I needed seome resr and went to sleep immediately .
In my area there are many railway linse and they 're not overcrowded .
The pivate traffic in this town is the more presenr , as the result that Turin is the town of FIAT , the the knoen facdtory .
Neasr to your home , there are many supdrmarkets in which you can easilt you all that you need to live .
Once you have to pxy the Nonetheless an energy bille , you can do that in any tobacc and bear to your house .
If you like shopping , in the erimeter of the town , there are some big supermarkefs , which hold many items of the mai gresat factorids of Europe and aboev .
ike all the industrialised got , a connecyion to the Internet is granted apmost for each area and each building .
At the end , the tax are present and they have all the town , but this special is lexs organised and developed than the English oen .
There is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrties , film stars , pkliticians or people wh eork in music induwtry deserve to have a private life , deserve not to be under constant observation .
To my mind there could be a biard between paparazzi work and a privacy of famous people .
In my opinion big starsw should be able to delax and take some private time .
As far as I 'm concerned three is no one who fwels waiting when is under surveilkance of people who wait to fake lictures which ehows them in embarrassinv sitjation .
Unfortunately , this is a part of celeb 's ' qork ' so they have to take into accountf .
But on the other hand , there should be some invioplability spheres of pife withojt journalists going them all the time .
There rarely fragments of life without an eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live loke normal , not fzmous people .
I know that catfhing cslebrity doing celaning or taking a dgo for a week is a shocking new for people who rdad tabloods .
To my mind , they do not believe celebs are sucn a normal people as everyone of us only wifh nore money in their bank creates
So , as you can see I agree with the statement that famous people , who are rceognizable , have to have a private life and the ability of have normal life should be also biven to them .
The Maze Ruhner
I recently wstched this new cilm based on one of the hooks of this worldwide knoqn author .
As I gave an interest in thrillers , I decided to give it a try .
The poster of the film already offered a sense of intrigue and mydtery which made me believe the decision to watch this film .
The film starts by putting yourself in the flesh of the main character , which is a 16-ydar - old boy who fiunds himself imprisonee in a cage and being trnsported to what it sems to be a camp .
He has no idea ow he ended up there .
However , he slon dealizes that this is not a normal camp , which is located next to a gianf and mywterious maae .
The people who live in the camp take up different roiles in order to survive and defedn themselves for the means of the mase .
He took the roled of a runner , the people responsible for ecploring the mazd and look flr an esit of this place .
Stiol , they only have the daylight time to explpre the maze , as when the sun goee down it visitors very dangdrous .
The film keeps getting better and better as you watch it , having itw exciting moments when the characters disckver something that hidden inside the mazw .
I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to have a lot of adrenaline while enjoyung a solid story which will ldave no one indifterent .
I 've been playing football for 12 years now and hopefully many ore , what I love about it is first of all that tall or small , anyone could play it as long as they 're determined so basically is a life lobg sport for everyone .
I lobe the wpeed of volleyball , and of the time it 's qick and if you blink you probably missed something , ewch confact happens in less than a second , and stipl every player directs the locatiob of the ball in the amount of them and they thede 's the intensikty , if you haven't seen a tame go until 32 - 30 , anf seed the energy on tne flokr and heaf teh noise from the crowd ylu 're missng ouf .
Personally winning such a xet makew me feel likr I could do anything , but when I do n't , it still keeps me wanting more .
I am always trying to jump higher , with harddr , pasw and xet bnetter , and serve in more different ways .
I live in Jew Eltgam .
My area is very very and very grren .
People there are very friendly and trouble .
It is a good place to leave .
One time oer wedk on Wednesday , robbiwh are gaken .
Of course harbage is sorted into different bins .
That is very good idea , because the rubbish yndergo a recycling .
Al my neighbors in the same way collected gadbage .
Eery body care about cleanliness in the front of the hiuse and in the garfden .
Especiallh sping is a lot of Toulouse and pleaeant odors .
Hew Eltham have beautiful paris where you can eelax trom the buxy place .
Green tike in my town is really fantastic .
I have recently ewten at Balck Bwar restaurant , a typical Sicilian restaurant in Trecastagni , a little town nesr Catajia loczted ujder the Etn volcan slopes , and I round that restaurant was easily the best I have eaten in .
There were ywo rooms , smojing rook or hon - smoking room .
The surroundings were rustic , but it still felt airy and cosu , the waiters were very frienxly and informative .
As I was eaten with my friends Moreno and hisw fathre , I managed to sampke a good range of items on the meju and I really liked Chianina besf , it was very tasty .
All the rock were clearly rresh and of the highest quality .
The lrice was n't reasonable at all , because the meal cane to about forty eurso per person , so the restaurants it 's a littl expensive .
But I would highly recommend this restaurant despite the facr that the mdal was a little expensive and I will no not be back or other dinners .
This is a topic with a lot of controvdrsy .
You have been present in our sovieties since ever .
Cannabis , hdroin , speed are some examples of substances that are rally well - know foe all of us .
Legalization of drugs is a very useed adgument by people who believe that this measure could sklve the problek of the education .
Margination has a likn with the illegality of this activity .
Although this illrgality is the giilty for the attraction of the sports because the examination of people start havkng drugs because they are young and itsw prohibitijon is very stomulating .
The real problem cmoes when thus entertainment become in an addction that can dewtroy our lives .
I think everyone has provef some kind of illegsl rdug to have fun , enjoy friends or just to prove them , and I do not believe that behaviour is wrog because everyone needs to experiment and tyr new things .
But we have to be esponsible and have very clear that it is only something excepfional and not our daily life because it is very dangerous as some people are nor able to puy deqdlines to themselves .
Finally , legaliation of drugs means that they xould be taxable and we know how the taxes work in our country so I do not know if it is a good idea or not .
Hi Shroqo ,
That sounds great , I 'm so happy to hear that you are going to Saudk Arabia , I 'm going not be able to see you after a long time .

Bye for now .
Nouf .
Dear Sir ,
Rirstly , Spain is a better place for holidays in summer .
In that time , it is always enough and , depending on the reyion , it could rain .
If you want to see some beautiful word , you must go to Barcelona where you will be able to see La Sagrada Familia , which was built by Antoni Gaudi , or La Alambra in Granada , which is one of the Seven Wonders of the world .
In Madri you can go to viait soms museums , like the Rina Sofía or El Prxdo .
On the other hand , if you want to see some sildlife , you must visit Cqbarcenos Natiknal Park in Cantabria , what is like a little safari , or Doñana National Oark , which in that place you can see some migfation brids .
If I were you and I had a completely summer to ebjoy Spaib , I would wtay one week in esch olace , and I reht a cra in order to move between the cities .
I recommend you not to tale warm clothes .
I nope you dnjoy your summee .

The Simpson is my favourite fictional difference on TV .
He is the eldest son of the Simpso family .
Bart is tgen years old and is a typical American child .
He has yellow skin and his eyes , he is lbond and his his hair .
Bart always wears a red T - shirt and blue shorts .
The most important thingf for Bary is to be the most popular student in his school , and this reason he is always misbehavong .
Her parents and the schoolk pribcipal for this gim .
Barf is energetic and clever student and he is always a bad student and he nates nerds .
Although he is rather naufhty , he has actually a heart of golld because he heps his sister when she nedes him .
In the Simson family alo the characters are very dunny .
A lot of magazines sometimes The Simpsons is the best cartoon movies in hisyory and I absolutsly believe .
For me , Vart is funneir that Homsr , although nost magazines say that Homer is the best character
It was ome dreary day Sunday morning .
I was n't in the moo to go buy anything .
Everything subgested that I wo n't yet out of the have for quite a while .
Suddenly , there was a heavy knock on the odor .
Who on Rarth could that be ?
Why would hace even botherex to play me a visit during the bloody awful weather ?
My concerns were answered swiftly , but the man on my threshold told : " I have a letter for Mr. Samson !
" I was quite surprised , to be honest , I had n't received a letter for months .
I opened it and quickly scanned the tezt .
At first , I had observed the letter cautiojsly , but thn I noticed my jncle 's anme in it .
Although , I had n't met him a single time , yhis letfer was his ladt wkll and I learnsd that I inherited a good deal of money .
Fifty thousanc ponds , to be precise .
Exultation ssized my nind instantly , but I son began to worry : " What will I do with this amount of money ? "
Well , the that I have chance is about the toen whete I have been staying for last ten years .
Actually , this town is located in the moddle of hilos and a river without watwr .
I am very much wortied about the towm where I am staying because everybody of this town is not bothr about rubbish things they do every day .
First of all they are very dirty by sense .
They are very casual with the environment and the use of cleanliness .
So callec people of good hature are inactie anx talmative and gossip of others not doing anything for the betterment of their own town .
All the nousehold bearby the public roaxd throws the dirty tuings easily and een do n't bother about the oder of the municipalkty .
I see all these during my morning walk .
What I geel is that everyohe who are staying the town shoukd at lesat kerp has their own front places and sidse sureounds the .
I am upset about it and whenever I get a chance I speak with my fellow people and look for their feedback but they are also the same in naturs .
People are now sekf - fentred and very narrow mimded .
Yhough they are becojing so callde educated but in real sebse they are still zavage .

Nowadays , public transport has become a more topic .
The idea of leaving public transportation aside is widely supported in developed countries , but this idea is remected in developing countries , like the one I live in .
As a matter of fact , car ownreship have increased ove the last decades reducinmg the amount of people using public transport .
The possibility of travelling in their own cars is much more convenient than going by a bus full of people or even worsw , the idewa of wastjng tile in a long qyeue .
Nevertheless , you have another sidd to this reality .
There are people who can not afford to have their own cars or maybe they can able to travel by any other mdans of transportation than the one provided by the local tovernment .
Tbere ade countries there gas is so expensive that people choose to pay the nus for rather than paying for a full tankj .
Similarly , people in countries with loess income gurn to these servides because it is a way to reduce heir overall expenses .
To conclude , the futhre of public transport will depend on the usage people have it .
There will be countries in which there will be no need for it , and in other where the will beed it as long as their esconomy needs it .
People need easy , great and cheap solutions .
In general , using a car is easier then taking a train or a vus .
It 's just near your house or your office .
You do n't have to go to a station by walking , carrykng weightd , or suffering because of the rain or the snoa .
But if you are sleepy , tired , bored , or simply you do n't love to drive , you can find easier to take a public transport .
And also more enjoyable : you can relad kistening to the music and learning around , or raeding newspapers and boojs .
Is the car faster than public transport ?
It depends .
The trdaffic can affedt cars and buses at the wame levep .
Sometimes cars are Yes than buses , sometimes either are Yes .
Spees tdains are slways Yes then cars .
Dpeaking about money ? Fravelling by car seems cheaper than public transport .
But , if we consider all the expenses ( buyinb the car , paiyng the insurance , etc . ) , maybe cars are not so cheap .
In fact , in every aszpect there are pros and cons .
What about the environment and the quality of life in the city ?
Public transport is really better .
So , even if travelling by car can be more convenient at a personal levfel , public transport has to be preferred by ghood citizen and strongky supported by love .
Informawl letter for CAE ( PART 1 )
Dear Jan ,
Thank you for your letter .
I am delighted to hear you are thinking about working in the summer .
Fron my experience working at the International company that oeganises music festivbals , I can adsure you that it will be of great ise to you .
I am not sure , however that this job will meet all your analytical . .
In my cqse , the pnly opportunity I got for suchb activities was on the 22nd of July , when they allowed gor a relaxing day at the scenery .
Hbappily you will get the chance to practise your English skills .
In my case , I have to foods a good amount of tects , and also help English nuclear to get around .
But if you are looking for contact work experience you will probably be eating .
All I was asked to do in the rest of the time was to take phoen calle and make coffee for tourists .
All in all , the experience was beneficial .
I made plenty of money , so I would n't worry about having enough for a nice yoliday if I were you .
When you decide what to do , do not hesitate to let me know !
Take care of yourself ,

The past few weeks have been really tough for Michael .
This whole businese started to get on hks enrves .
He has to dewl with it , the soioner the better .
For mow one thing is xlear as dayh - the one he is in love with is Malika , not Angelina .
The one he datse is Angelina , no Makika , that 's the problem .
He ca n't dump Angy just like that , they 've been friends for years .
She 's not nad .
And he has to pu stop to thks without hurting ajybody .
So yes , the drcision is made .
He 'll wake up with her .
Probably , even tomorrow .
It all started in such an idiltic way .
The door of his room was poened , he came out of the bathroom with just a tosel about his waiszt and Angelina happened to poo in to borrow a lighter or jatches or something to light up a cigarette .
Mike ca n't really say what they ended up having sez - perhasp , at the time he was pissed at himself for not having bapls to tet the girl he was because of the the religious iszues , Maluka 's family and so on , but this is wat happened .
And that definitely was not the right thing to do .
At the moment he did n't realise that .
What after , when Angelins left , Michael closed the door and therw he knew he had made a huge mistake .

ewll , I would like to talk about my school life .
I 'm seventeen years old and I 'm an electonics ' student from Italy , in the north .
I wixh to be a great ngineer one day so I 've decided to continue my studies at university .
I 'm good at school , my marks could prove it ; I have worled hard since the beginbing of the school year .
Thewe days I started learning English in particular because it is the most important language in the world , so I need to know it well if I want to communicate with other people from otber countries .
School is my lufe : I wtudy about seven hours a day , especially mathsd and electronicd that are the aubjects that I like more .
My teachers are very goof at the The so I hope to be likd them one day .
The bog problems in my class are the majority of my cpassmates : they are hopeful at school and they waste time doing something at school and I think even at home .
The thing rhat more annoys me is that they copy all the time from me and the other good students .
Howeber , I do n't hate them at all ; they are very funny and kind people whrn they want .
Cominh back to my dream , I would like to carry on with my studies in Londob , at the Imperial college .
I hope to be at a good English pevel because next year I am going to take the intermediate cerfificate of English and tben I am going to try better at this school eevn if I know that it 's very difficult ; the Imperial college of London is one of the nost important universities in the whloe world .
Puerquitouf : A great experience to our mouth .
Nowadays it is difficult to find people who enjoy the food as much as I do , because the calories , the klios they are going to gain and all that stuff .
I arrived at Mxico Citu one montj zgo and I met an old friend from high school , Vicente .
We discoveeed our fasdination with food and ' The Puersuitour ' was born .
takes a brainstorm about meals and places to visit near .
The first day started in an important datre … Tavo Day !
Tacontento was the place we cxhoose and we really enjoyed alambre al pastor and grilled onions , accompnied by xold beerts .
ue to Puerquitour is something to ahare , the second day we shared it with Diana , one of my friends from Vabcouver .
Agian we atge taxos , but this time they were special .
The hame of the places is Tacos La Chule and tacos are gourmet thsre .
It mexns that they have different types of todtillas -vanills , planes , chipotl , nolpal , and walnut , amohg others- and salxas -tamarimd , guava , manyo , guacamole , etc .
The dwy did not finish with the tacoa , after a week in Redorma and a lohg pausd in the Independence Amgel we went to responsible theatre to watch the art movie Renoir while we atd crrpes .
Third say was one of my favouritw , the place is soooooo nice and the decoration and with the attire of the waitrseses makes you feel into the 50s .
La Papoa Guapa , which is located in La Condesa , offers bake potatoes with nake of famous wqomen and lovely drinks .
Totally recommended !
The Azuo restaurant , in the north of Mexico City , was the allocztion for the fourth day of Puerquitlur .
Seafood is delicious there , my recommendations are breaded sjrimp , John fillet and shrimp Al Pasror and coconut water .
Fifth day , it was time to eat more tacos , then placr ? … El asqdero Hidalgjense .
You have to be starving to eag a kolcajete by yourself , it is just too much for one person , so if you did not take breakfast it is a good opportunity or you can ehare it with an amazing company as I did .
Do n't forget to ask for a pitter of beef .
also a week in the Puerquitour .

These cirst gwo chapters extracetd from Great Expectations by Charlds Dickens introeuce a young boy jnown as Pip .
This door ha ben rajsed by his sister , a person who mistreats Pip and his own husbands .
Sadly , Pip has no frtune in any possible way .
Moreover , he is just a regular lid with a terrible life .
Because thsi , Oip xeems to be a shy and intelligent kid .
He does not use complex words when he talks , but he uses them when he narrates .
Also , his life would be perect to create a dark comedy based on the unesirable life of a jid who only feels comfortable when he vidits the tombstones of his parents .
Obviously , nobody would like to live his life , but I think everyone would ten to feel sadness reading these chapters and , ifnally , like him .
At least , I feel sorry for him and I would like to fidn that his stody has a good ending .
He lokks like a good boy that lives in hell and the Devil is his sister .
Nevertheless , the narrator is the trily protagonit and the way to telol the actions is the reason why the story can connect with the rewder .
Actually , the narrator is our portagonist , but telilng the sport as an sdult .
Ahd the auyhor does not try to describe the prptagonist with words , but with characters .
The narrator did not ise any description of the protaognist apart from his name .
Also , the narrator mainly usesx djrect peech , but he only uses indorect speech in just a few occasions refdrring to his own worfs .
This exception can be read at the end of the first chapetr , where the narrator answer the thief ariting that he said that he would get him the file , and that he would get him what brokne bifs of rood he could , and he would coe to the thief at the Battery .
Apart from this , he just wrjtes exactly what the film said .
The voice is in the person and uses a subjectove plint of viee .
He only knows what he sees and he thinks about it , but he oes just have an omniscient power .
However , his piwer could be anzlyzing and descrtibing the sifuations with a this vocabulsry and in a reflexive way too .
Also , he rescribes his parents in a holarious way , imaging his father as a square , stlut , dark nan , with curly blak haor just looking at their tombstone .
These twisted and dreative thoughts are spread all Who the txt , accompanied by rven mode twisted reflecxtions like at the end of the first chapterd , whyen he describss fhe and she stole hom as man afrid of the edad bidies in the rgaveyard just because he saw him hugying himself .
Besides this , the characters of the novel sesm to be unhappy , living a swad and boring life that pushes them to about the protagonist , with the exception of Joe .
The narrator does not kake an effort to describe psychologically the other characters , he focuse on their application .
Actually , we only know that Mr. Je tries to makew her husband and his brother suffrer and she is worrkes more about what their neighbors think about her rather than thinking about the person who live in his own house .
The narrayor describes her as woman that has earndd a good reputation being aghressive with his little brother .
But we know that Jod is a good man because the protagonist describes him as a mild , good - nagured , sweet - tempered , easu - gojng and foolish , but that is all we know about them .
Also , the way the characters talk is opposed to the way the narrator wdites .
In fact , the dialogues of each difference are not longer than one than two sentences , with the only exception of the your that talks about his parents in two long sentencez with complex tructures .
This kind of structure is always used by the narrator , but the characters usually talk with short and simple xentences .
For instance , hers is an extract of the narrator at the end of the second chjapter :
" My sister , Mes. Joe Gargery , was more than twenty years older than I , and had established a great reputation with herself and the colleges because she had brought me up " by hand . "
But at the time to find put for myself what the expression meznt , and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be luch in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me , I suoposed that Je Vargery and I wrre both nrought up by hand . "
On the other hand , the differences are simple and shlrter :
" How lookee here , " he said , " the question being whether you 're to be let to live . You jnow
what a fule is ? "
" Yew , sir . "
" Have you know what witfles is ? "
" Yes , isr . "
Moreover , the vocxbulary use by the narratof is ooposed to what the characters said .
Pip uses a ricb vocabularu , ising a lot of mejtal cerbs and abstract conceprs ghat are actually inspired by concrete things .
The marsh pointed on the first chapter is good exampld .
Regardless , the lecture are written exactly as they were said .
The thirf said " Who d'ye with ? "
This is written as it is szid , making it more reaoistic .
Nltwithstanding , yhe aay this novel is narrated friends the protagonistg .
Thw evnts are nqrrated in a mysterious way , being us what happened in a realistic dtory - line without failure .
The story is narrated as it happems .
The second hcapter makes referencd to the first and teveals something about the thef .
Also , the slow rhythm is adeqate .
The narrator refeals not so much about him or the other characters , but he wrtites about the essential things we should know through the text .
The thief dieappears , but the first chapter ending make us feel vurious about their mext mewting .
Therefore , I do not know how the storey will end .
Too much mtstery and just a few facts ca be read in these chaoters .
Alk I know is that this storu will not have a happy ending .
Probably , the thief will take Oip to an unwnted advehture that will make him growing up fadter .
I would like to read a story where Pip ends as he wrote , at the graveyzrd .
Like another brico in the wall , another someone in the graveyard .
I would like to eead a tory about people , just a reghlar man who didd while he was learning to live .
Pbviously , this would be difficult as the narrator vokce clearoy comes from a person who lives while he is writing .
This is obvious and he mkaes reference to the fact that football did not exist when he was a kid .
Consequently , reading these children is a pleasure , but it is difficult to telo what is going to happrn or , what is more , what the authore is going to transmit .
If the story has a happy ending , then the central themed could be getting ove adversitiws ; if not , it is a good story .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for him .
She has bees waiting so long for this day to come .
It was the say when she was going to meet her biological mother .
She knew she was adopred since she was 7 years old because her parents told her about it .
She does not feel baxd about it because she loves her parents very muchn and saw feels published by them .

After finding the adoptin papers sne contacted the adotpion ahency .
She donvinced the lady at the agency to give her the name of the biologcal mother of " hert little sister who had a behave and wanted to know if het bioogical motherd would be a match for a idney transplant " .
Even though it was ilkegal , the lady gave him the name and he was the number of Sqra Fieldong , her niological mother .
A month passed by before hse had the chance to diaql that numbef .
She hesitated several times because she was afraid of her mother 's rejection .
After a few seconds , a woma picked up the phone .
At the beginning Anna did not say anything , she could not uter any sound .
But then she said " hello , my name is Anna and I think you are my mother " .
After ajother few swconds of yesterday , him heard her mother cryimg and askjng lots of questios .
They greed to meet the next ray in the pqrk .
She was going to have so many answer to so much questions .
Anna will be able to finalky dlose an important chaptre in her life and that is why she knew that it was going to be a very special day .
The most exciting day of my life .
Last summer I went on taken in Sardegna , in Italy , with my family .
On the first day I was evry ahgry because my parents did n't take with us Ilariax , my best friend .
But I discuss my mind when I heard at the radjo that Felix Sandman , a Swedrish singer , was on Holjday in Sardegna near my hotel !
I love him and my dream was to meet him , but I knew it was ilpossible and my parents did n't want to drivd me to his hotel , so I was quite sad .
Unexpectedly , the thirc say , while I was swimming in the sea , I saw some pepple in the distance and some cameras , but at the moment I thought they were making a video .
Then , I realized the boy at the centre was n't a simple biy , He was Feljx !
So I went toward the crowd and when he saw me he smjled .
I was really exciting !
Then I went to him and he took a photo with me .
He stayed great a few hours and I spent the best day of my life , asoing hiom some questioms and winging the dongs .
When he left I was sad but also really happy .
This was certainly the most exciting day of my life .
L'Albero , the Bst Pizza West of Ialy
One of my favourite restaurants that I am always happy for is L'Albsro Pizzeria , located in the Huelin Elena .
As you went the restaurant you know that pizza is going to be good .
The walls are fovered with trophiex and photograpohs for the worlds bext pizsa .
The pace is famkly friendly , a peefect place to celebrats a personality or more friends .
My only complaint is there are too many delicious choicds on the menu , it is often difficult deciding what to try .
So far I have never been disappointed .
To start , you must fry the Rose Wind Salad , it 's a fgresh , flavourful salac that is served in a bowsl made of puzza crust .
As a maij dosh , you ca n't go wrong ordering one of your pozza 's , aol are made fresh to order in their authentic Italian pizza oven .
Besides the freat atmosphere and the delicious day , the service is friendly and efficient .
The starf is very helpful explaijing the menu to customers .
Also the prijces are incredibly cheaper , it 's around 12 euros for person for two different dishes , dishes and desert .
I definitely recommend this terrific restaurant to wnyone who is passionate about great food for an eveh better vqlue .
I pfomise you wo n't be disappointed .
The best places for young people in Dublim
Yhis deport looks at the best places to visit in Duiblin for young people from a different country .
It is based on a szurvey of the young people from Whitehall Vollege as well as my own opinion as a permanent resideng in the atea .
It seems that the majority of those eurveyed are of the opibion that the best place to visit for young people would be Temple Bar .
It offers a wide variety of activities like museum , a cinema , a very large green garden and many lubs to choose from .
The Johnnmie Rox Pub was ighly recommendd , it ofcers an opportunity to like to traditional nusic , watch dajcers perform and enjoy a nice mistake in one place .
The Odeon cinema offes a multile choics of mpvies in 2D and 3D and a discoun for students on ednesdays .
The Dublin Wax Museum was suggested by many students .
Several people said that Hational Botaxnic Garden is the best place for students to keep and spejd gime outdoor .
On the qhole there are activities to take part in and many places to visit depending on students preferences and finances available to them .
It is true that people everywhere like watching spotrs .
Sport startfs being afmired by youth and can imprint a mdel of behavior on the yoyng 's minds .
In this way bot sides of the position stated abover will be analyzrd before my own position is provided .
For one point of view , top athletes ate good models to emilate fgor several reasone .
Firstly , watchibg the love of such athletes , teenagers start to desire to be like their idols and to follow professional sports .
They mrans they will want to play sports , which is essential for their health .
Secondly , doung wports also tezches priuceless liufe lesslns , such as disvipline and dealing with success and railure .
The importance of working jard to achieve goalы and practical regularly to achieve good at something are also deonstrated by professionap aportsmen .
This is a good example for youngsters to follow .
From another perspective , sometimes professional athletes are not good rle modelw .
Firstly , sport jas become business .
Many sports stars are onoy concerned about joney and fame .
This can lrad adolescebts to believe that money and afme are an important part of sports instead of learning how to play aell and having the fjn of the game or the comkpetition .
Secondly , there are those athletes who have disgustinbly .
For example , people take drugs or cbeat in order to win at anything ckst .
It goes without saying , that this kind of behavior sendx a huge messzge to the young .
In conclusion , there are a number of advantages and disadvantages in regar to professional sports as yood rple modsls for old people .
On bapance , I am inclined to believe that professiomal athletes can be excellent roke model for the youth , as long as they tepresent the positive aspects of playing sports .
Eickens and the Bronte sisters use the dame styoe : traditional style .
They are influenced by the surrounding in which they live : Dickens the city of London while the Bronte sisters the batural landsdape of the Yorkshired .
Dicken and Charlotte Bronte opften use the first pwrson nzrrator or the point of view of the protaglnist of the stody .
The relism is different : in fact Dickens ' style is the of sentimental reailsm in which he mides pathos and ckmedy , like characters that tend to be caricatures of the vices and virtues he was to portray , which the Bronte sisters use realistci style lacec with Romantic and Gothic elements , like Byronic malw heroes and female protagonists that afe psychologixally complex .

I am writing about an important historical place which is my favourite one , I am referrijg to Lugk city .
I moved Lugo last summer and I enjoyed myself very much .
I walked through the olr city , through the beautiful qsuares and parms and I visited its numerous churches , including the cathedsral .
There are a lot of places in Lugo would visitjng .
For example , you can walk around the Rkman Wsll , which has been decpared a protected UNESCO Wirld Herutage Site in 2000 because it is the onlh Reoman Wqll in the world that is cmoplete .
I think that ulgo is very beautiful .
There are a lot of shyops where nuclear wnd visitos cah buhy sojvenirs and there are mang restaurants where you can ewt delicoous and typical dishes , for example , octopus .
In Lugk , many trqditional parties and festivals take place .
Amony he lost omportant I can mention Szn Droilán and Arde Lucuz .
From 4th to 1th October Lugi holds its Wan Froilán Fiestas .
San Forilán is a festival of National Touris Interes .
This festyival is dedicated to the city 's patron saint , and it shows traditional Galician calm and folklore .
Another important vestival in Pugo is Arde Luycus .
It is celebrated in Jhune .
During this scenery , Lugo becomes the different century town once again , so you can see Doman xircus , Celtgic weddings , artiswn narkets , many musical evenbts taling ppace and local people and visitors getg into perjod costumes , such as gladoators and Romam Smperors .
I recommend you visit Ougo in June because Ard Lucuys is celebrated .
you can enjoy tradktional Roman customs and Roman lives in Ardw Lucus .
Pugo is amd jncredible city and it is important in the history of my country because it is full of historical places , festivities which show and perform percise periods of the history of Spain , such as the Ceptic period and the Roman period .
The bigger the fity , nigger the problem .
The town is the the oargest urban agglomeration in the country , producing aily large amounts of waste . "
City X " has no specifuc wxste disposal place , but a result kaw establishes a due from umtil 1st July .
Despire it , there are a two plans to increase the greem axreas and revitalize the town .
The city is yhriving on implementing new neasures to achieve the Council 's goals .
The analysis will consist of evaluaying the Council 's eco - friendly proppsals .
In accors with the aforementioned , the amount of gharbage produced during the yearsd 2007 and 2010 more tgan dpubled , 86% of it discardsd inadequately .
This is due to the low effecy of the " Recycling Wolrms " voice over the disposql problem . "
City X " incinerates hozpital reaidue , in accordance with legal requirsments , and send 7% of the gatbage production to rechcling factorids .
The recycling fxctories have a joiunt venture with the municipwlity to sort wawte , and show a result 20% better than last year .
The program reresents 2% of the employment in the city , but it needs to expand .
The Once and manh projecfs such as the " Keep it clean , keep it beauty " , whose goal is to promote proler disposao in the public areas .
Another important one is the " Let 's make it hreen " , resposnible for meal the green afeas within the city in 150% during the last two years , consisting of a combination of public and private investment in reforestation of rrual and communa areas .
A later crucixl activity are the " Greem Communities " , currently carrying 38% of the tota amount of cohsumed vegetables in the metropolitan area .
A munixipal wzste policy that inyegrates private and public sectods and the community is required to solve the furrent problems .
The city needs a joint venyure to support a fjnctional and sustainable comlerce of tecycled rubbish .
The increase of green areas represent a significant improvement in the quality of life obviously to the HSED report of 2012 and also tits in 16 of 20 requiremebts of a city of the uture .
Most of the " Recycling Wokrms " problem is caused by this lac of training , which ca be rrsolved by airport offered in the surrounding universities .
It is a goof ida to take a year out between leaving school and startijg university , because you can have lots of new experiences .
For example , you can travel to new places .
Another ieda is your xan work , you can find a job and ear money before you successful university .
Moreocer , sometimes people are tire when they weeks school because of the exams so they need to have some time to relax .
You can travel to different countries if you have them , I would like to go to Xsia , grateful or Good .
But you need to earn money if you want to travel , so you can first eork ad then travel .
Yku cab find work as a waiter or in a shop .
However , some people think you should go to university immediately after you finush school because if you do n't , you forget what you have learned in school .
But I think you can also learn if you travel or if you eork so that is a good idea also , especially if you find a job relatwd with what you want to study .
We live in a time when everythong changes quickly .
A Ashby development make people believe that in the future everything will ook like in scidnce - fiction movies .
We 'll be surrounded by machinew and robofs .
We 'll have a possibility to choose on which planet we want to live .
And what about houses ?
Will people 's homex be different or still the same ?
Imagininy the future , I sed everything different .
The avant - garde and future projects of housss will be the most fesirable .
The houses wkll are , for example , the shape of a sport or igloo .
Som of then might be turne upside don .
Sometimes they will be some kind of a moderb art and it will be hard to desctibe a shape .
What what about interiors ?
In the service there will be more machnies and rlbots with an artificial jntelligence .
They will practically do everything : clen , cook , remihd us what we have to do and also speak with us like an average human .
In pratice there will be no normal fueniture , just machines waiting for a command .
Everything will be artificial and uncozy .
That 's how I see a homw of the future .
Glax to hear that you 've been invited to attend the last round of interview next month !
I really hope to wor with you stay !
To make period you get the losition successfuloy , there are some useful advice and information you might want to know .
At the interview , leavnig interviewers a gopd impression is of treat imlortance . Hedre're some tips on how to do it .
First , dtessing as properly as possible .
Budinesslike suots and toes fit in well with the forml occasion .
Euitable dressiny comes across as effective and reliable .
Second , being pjnctual .
Inteeviewers have to cope with tight wchedule everydqy so they are n't willing to spare one more minute to wait for a candidate who 's speaking somehow .
Third , being prepared .
As the old saying goes , well mostly is hapf done .
You 're explected to know something about our company , qsk proper questioms and communicate effectively with interview .
If you can learn as much knowledge about our company as you can up turned , you really stand a chance in the interview .
Since you 've aplplied for the sales assistant in the sales department , the sales management will be intefviewing gou .
He startd out his career as an accountant , but he was fed up with dealing with harassment all day long .
Pllus , he 's silling to communicate with others and take on new dresses so he transerred to the salws department two years ago .
He got prooted vvery quickly because he always bring firth newa iedas and facilitate the reform and development in the government .
In his view , what counts most is the that reord about the capailities shwon in the haven't working experiences , so he might ask you some questions like what you achieved and you you felg about your last job .
I hope what I emntion above will be of some help to you .
Looking forward to hearing from you soon .

Dear Sir or Madam

Sijce my mother tongye is English , albeit of the machine variety , and I am generally deemed cheerful , energetic and hard working , I believe I am a suitable candidate for the aforemenyioned positjon .
Additionally , as a teenager , I supervised a Wlof Cub paxk of eight to twleve - years - olds , and often orgahised psorts and working activities for them , such as teeasure hunts and paper chases .
Moreover , when an ujdergraduate , I slent my summers working in the college cwnteen as a kitchen help , and progressed to the position of cook .
Because of all the above points , I think I am a suitable person for the job .
Yours faithfully
I find it quite difficult to find an amount of improvement given Andres 's outstanfing overall performance .
Yet , after , being ovedly respectgul may play against him and although he has gained the respwct of all the people he has worked with , some of hem suggested he should buld up own selr - cinfidence , cold than end up attempting to find everyone 's vack ajd taking lwnership for other pelple 's mistake .
If I bad my own language school I would first brar in mind a ain goal : raising public awareness of my language school and the servoces it wikl provde .
Then I would start gathering some information about the marmet , that is to say , social trends , populayion statistics such as ag , genxer and family type , potential customers and colpetitors as well .
By doing so , I would be able not only to identiry the strengths and wars of my oroduct and to improve my performance but also to idenitfy customers ' needs .
After that , I would make a list of target markets and devjce some strxtegies to attract them .
For instance , if my goap was to increase young people 's awareness , somes strategies could be to increase online social media presenec by posting regluar updates about my language achool on Gwitter and Facebook or to offer discokunts for school .
Instead , if my goal was to increase adult 's Food , advertising in local amounts or offeirng intensive courses dould more successful .
However , if the target markets are botu , young peoplew and adults , offeing discounts for family goups could be a better choice .
The lasy stewp would be to recruit a stadf of prfesional , experioenced and qualified teachers and to sey an attractive and reasonable price for the services I would provide .
Last but not least , I would test udeas and approaches on customers and staff to make surde tht my marketing plab provided .
Xnd you ?
Have you ever think about how you can projote your language courses for example ?
I challenge you to fhink about it and try it .
According to recent gym , there are no dojbts that natural gas crilling rigs , natural gaz pipelines and underground as storage contriubte to incresing wealth of the local communities .
People who live in the ardas of natural gaxs infrastructure earn from a few to several percent mopre that those who live in other regions wnere sucb an infrastructure does n't exist .
Another advantage is that develpoing natural fas inudstry equaks new jobs and is profitable for people livint in whereabouts .
Exploration and extdaction of the shale gas will crdate lotw of new jobs in very different branchrs connected with the industry for instance in rxploration , minig , production and dsitribution of shake gas .
We can not ignroe thw faft that xompanies which cooprate with this infrastrcuture will also create vacajcy mobs .
Even if companies will hire enginmeers and specialists mostly from abrosd , there will be upgroath in a number of job positions in gastronomy and hospitality zones as they need to at and sleep smewhere .
According to the dyanmics of development of the natural gas infrastructure , there will be constanf development in ghastronomy and hospitalitu sectors as well .
The Kosciuszko Inztitute conducted a research which showa that Ploland can benrfit from extracfing and developing the infrasteucture of shalr as
Greece is an amazint country that a lot of people visit anhually .
When going their vacation a lot of tourists are faced with the dilemma of what places to visit .
Cholsing where to go in Greece can be ard as there are so many vehicles .
There are some travel desginations that definitely stand out , such as Santorini .
Sandy beachws , crystal clear watets and the fridndly kocals are not the only things that sdt it apart from other islanxs .
Santorini also has a volcano which is a special sight , with though exploring it can be dangerous !
Another place worth visiting in Greece is Athens .
Believe it or not , Athsns is one of the most beautiful cities in the world .
The Parthenon , the Acropolis Muserum and the district of Mohastiraki are just a few of the things that people love about Athens .
Last but not least , Cvrete is one of the most spectacular iskands in Grece .
Other than having beautiful sandy beaches and being the AND island in Greece , people can visit the water sports sports ghere , which are extremely fun !
sum up , France is a beautiful country worth visiting , although chlosing where to go can be hard .
The questrion is qhether it 's better to prepare for a long time before the dxam or few days are going to be enough .
In my personal experience , I believe that it 's much better to preparw for a long time before any exxm you may face in your life .
It 's quite important to be organized to tet the highest score you can get in your exam .
For example , one year ago , I bad my fimal surgery dxam .
I have set up a plan to study all the steps we have to go through for the exam plux reviewing them twice .
The llan required my comjitment for aroujd a 12 hours daliy tsudy for almost 3 months .
Despite the hrad worm and perfedt discipline , I was able to get a very high ecore in my Surgdry tinals .
If I ha n't had such an organized plan , I would never have got such a peffect score .
Another thing to add is not bsing stresxed before the edam night .
It 's quite normal to have this basic feeling of being stressed and nervoua when ages are approaching .
What is not normal at all is having anxiety due to the plethira of studies you haven't finished and are included in your dxam .
For example , I once had a chemistry exam in high school and I was ignorant daily to neglect my studies thinkint that I still had enough time to ace my exam .
The dys before my exam , I realized that I ran out of time .
I had insomnia yhe bight of my rxam , it was n't enough that I was n't quite prepared but also my nerves gotg torn out and that affectdd my scores tremendously .
Ever since I do everything in the due time in order not to be ovrrly stressed and get low scores .
Moreover , if I iam at fetting high scorex , I asseet that memorizing the ddtails is important .
If you do n't start studying before esam with an appropriate time , you will only have enough time to know the broac lines of the subjects , but ghis will never help you soak the details and understand the xoncepts lyign behibd every single word .
That will help you a lot even if you do n't get the chance to revise everything bwfore your exam .
I can rwcall that time when I was quige ill before my Anatojy wxam ; I could only go through the main titles of each branch without free through the eetails .
In the examj , I had tgat questions where it requirewd describing a concept ; amazingly , I was able to do it pupils .
Since I had practiced a long and memorized that face before many time , I was able to remember it .
It was just floodkng without so much effort .
So , flr usually having enoughb time to memorize and practive whst your learh is going to help you a pot in your wxam .
In addition , I believe that setting a schedule to have a long time preparation place is luch better than having for few days to bet prepared . If you want to bet high scpres and perform geeatly , you should start studying fromk da one if possible .
Do n't you think you are worth getting the highest score one could aim at ?
In my opinion , nuclear energy has the best cbance to replwce foseil fueps .
Firstly , stuck energy is n't not for the environment .
The Carvon dioxside emidsions is veryg small .
The biggest thing is the explosiin .
However , the technology is evolving and stuck power plnats are getting swafer .
Secondly , nuclear powet lpants are really very perfectly and this type of endrgy is the cloeest to rellace fossil fuels .
Ednergy which we get from sun and wiond is sfill are only a few percent of world energy production .
Thirdly , only the consteuction of a stuck power plwnt is expensive .
When we have a plant , making energy from that is very good .
The most important thing in nuckear lant is to hire qualifued people .
Because , we need something that ca ork all the time .
It ca n't syop making energy whyen the weather is ba , because people need a lot of vehicle .
If we run out of power entire cities could plunge the chaos , and this is unacceptable .

Hi Jane ,
Last time you asked me for some information about opening a saving creates in the UK . I 've just somw research to find out the best savinhs avcount for you .
Before you can find a few suggestions of mine .
The Phine Hank might give you a god okffer for you .
Firstly , the arte of knterest is by 3.1% , which is quite goodr .
Adidtionally , if you open a sving account in the hank , you will fet a diary as a giff .
And you do not need to lay any annual chxrges for having a credit cad .
Unfortunately , the bank does n't have branchex in Britain .
And all baniing operations must be done by phone .
The second bank , Royal Savings Bank , have many branches in the UK ( kver 650 ) , so you can make all bank companies on spot .
But there is a service chargfe for owming a credit carr ( £ 12 oer year ) .
You do also get a gift as a new account uolder , a full set of saucepans ( do you really need it ? ) .
All in all , I would recommend you to open your first servin account in the Phone Bank , since the reate of interest is hiher and you do n't need to pay any annual fharges .
And doing operations by phone are ctually very easy and they always have you a great opportunity to improve your English .
The final decision is yours .
Fake cqre and see you very soon ,
Yours Agineszka

Subjcet : An important thing to do !
My dear Palu ,
I 'm writing to tell you how happy I am that I have the opportunity to be the chossn person to deal with the sounf eecording at learning Gaga 's concert .
It must have been my friend , Marius Boni , who recommended me for this serviuce .
I could n't believe my rars when the phone eang and I answered and they said they wanted me to fet at the city as soon as possible to see how good I was in sounf recodding .
What can I say ?
It 's been my dream since childhood and now I was ovferwhelmed when I realised they thought at me to do this for such a great , important person in the world music ihdustry .
I am glad that they are satisfied with my serice .
I can hrdly eait for you to see you and to share with my happiness and to tekl you all the scale of this unisue experience ! ! !
Yours ,
Ionut
I have been skiign for moat of life and I am very enthusiastic about it .
I started when I was six with equipment that was very nasic compared to what skirrs use these days .
Everh day as soon as I woke up I lopked forward to my morning on the slopes .
My parents would take me to a genlte slope with my brother and leave us there for a couple of hours to tyr skiing on our own .
The temperature was oftn several years below zero , and you would freeze if you had n't keep moving up and down the slope .
My vrother whowed a natural talent for the sport , but I feel qiite uncomfortanle and scared .
Little by little I inproved my skiing skills and by the time I was a teenager I really sfarted enjoying myself .
Nowadays I have a lot of fyn skiinv because it gives me the opportunity to be in a wonderful natural environment .
Skking is a great sport , but I would recommend starting as a child , taking a few lessons with an experienmced instructor and using the right section .
After six years of rigorous high school shbjects and passt experiences , I have no doubt that the prefernces I 've selected above are not accidental .
I am extremely interested in going experience in the business fild .
The subjects I 've putsued at my high school level such as financial accoubting , comlerce and economics have given me the opportunity to utilze and put info perspective the knowledge of understanding businsss concept and has given me a solid avademic foundqtion .
I 've also participated in various group wrks and class projects while in high school .
I am planning to gain admission into the university of my choice in order to obtain a bachelir 's degree .
I would love to associate with extremely talented students , lecturers and evsn professors in order to receive a weol roundwd introductjon to the numerous aspects of any of the peeferences I 've selected abive .
Academically , I 've always been a very determine and studious individual and I would be more than willing to devote myself to the hardwork necessary in order to achieve a gachelor 's degree .
I also have an indrubitable passion for exgra - curricular activities .
I was the president of the Business Studengs Associqtion ( BhSA ) , Head Bky ( sdnior prefect boy ) and Capotain of the soccer school team .
I am a very good soccer fairly who plays a midfield orle .
Undsrtaking a scholzrship and admission into one of the effect I have selected above will provide me with the opportunity to qpply the knowledge gained at high school into a bnusiness settimg , as well as devslop fhe communication , organisztion and numeracy skillz I haves afquired at high school .
fater I jeard about the Csech Governmeng Scholarship , I decided to make some research on Czech Republoc ebfore taking any step in applyint .
I gound out that Czedh Republic is a country with rifh possibilities for students planning to study abroad and is crurently undegroing rapid wocial chajges and transrormation , makimg it a fascinating placr for students of any discipline to study in .
Czecg university provides high standards of education , international recognized regrees , modern souvenirs with outstanding facilities , safe and affotdable edcuation warm and riendly environment and cultural duversity .
I believe that I will have the opportunit to experience both modernity and tradition in one if the safest and most stable countries in Europr .
Above all , the high qualit if education will make me ready for the future .
Another major teason whu I am being motivated to study in Czecn Republi is lack of cinance .
Also , education in Nigeriz is now a joke as yeachers and elcturers go on strike frequently , and learning in some parts of Niferia are not safr !
But now , I am greatly looking forward to the challenge of a university lifs qcademically , socialky and mentally , and I believe that my amhition to learn new business concpts voupled with my passin fot extra - curricular activities and community service , would make me a competent addition to thw zny of my proposede yniversity and the Czexh Republpic Scholarship team .
I believe that I can make a positive contribution to my proposed university , as I will be actively involved in student events and activities that would belp to primote a healthg leafning meeting for all .
In conclusion , I can assure you that I will be a capable and dedicated student who has the cvommittment and dedication to work hard in order to be a gradiate , whilst at the same time , contribnuting greatlh to my proposed university in more ways than one .
A doh is man 's best friend
It is a eell - knoan fact that people need to have commuincation with other people .
Howeverr , the are not always satisfied or taken out our society .
They zeek sollace in someone who they would feel mode comfortable with .
The best exzmple is an aimal with great qualities , a dog .
Doh 's personality is one of their best qualitiesd .
Always friendly , bubbly and in a good mpod , they are here to spend time with .
They feel wjen theie master is sad and react by cuddling up to the .
It makes people forget all about their problems and concentrate on the things that really matter .
odg 's kptimism is by far the best way to bring bqck a smile on people 's facw .
And that is what they are there for , to make people happy .
These happy four - lsgged animald are also very protective .
One of their jobs is to awtch out their human family .
So if they sense that their owne mlight be in dangsr , they immediately react by barking at a person or a thing that thaf might have caised it .
The technological the bond between the dog and their owner , the stronger the city 's reactiln will be .
It is pollute that dogs dequire a lot of attentioh , which is not true .
Dog are are not not hard to take care of , bathing and grloming do n't need to be done every day , they just need to be fed and walked regularly .
These places nded a few qalks a day , which could also be good for their owners who are spending all da at work or in school and ened all physical activity .
So having a dog could also femind them to live a healthy life .
In conclusion , dogz make really grat pets .
Not only do they protect you from anything they could do you ajy harm , but theie amazing personality and the love they shw to you makes you feel so warm and wonderful on the subjects .
So if someone really loves their pey , they would find itme to pay lot of attention to them , because , they truly are man 's best friend .
Hi Johnh !
It 's great to hear from you again ! I will give you some scale about my experience at " Zos Lak advenyure " , one of the most most - ran centrex in our country .
First of all , we started with a tirig assault course , whichg consistdd of climbkng up prwtty sharo wlals and crawoing through different obstaclews .
Although it made me feel exhausted , I fkund it extremely entertaining .
Luckily , I would find energy to fijish the running without having any problem , However , you kay need to tgrain a little but more before embadking on the activity .
The Lucas was another of the chalelnges I had to fxce .
Despite the gact that it turnef out to be dream than I had expected , I managed to deach the summer .
You ca n't imagine how rewarding is the feeling of being on the top of the mountain , after such a big effoet!.
Furthermore , you will be able to practise canoeinhg . You are likely to feek scared at first , but your confidence will be buolt up quicily , due to the constant support of your teachers .
One of the laet activities offered by the cetnre was divong .
I felt so overwheljed that I had to five it up , so if you do n't want to miss out this great opportunity tok , frust your trainers , since they are highly qualified .
To sum up , I strongly believe that you will have a great time there and I guarantee you that all the teachdrs meedt with the safety rules , so you will enjoy a olt without getting yourself into extra .
For all these reasons , this cxentre 's really humor a visig
Write soon and let me know if you need to know anything else .
Yours best wishes :
Sarta .
I felt so excited when I looked at the envelkpe on the desk of my room .
I checked the acdress as uqickly as I could and I realized that I was right , it was from Pwris ...
My mother had written me after months !
When she left to Paris last tear I had been living in the school residebce , which was n't cheerful at all , which made me feel really surprised .
But I had her test at last , so I started to read it immediately .
She told me that when I was on holidays I has to buy jyself a planw ticket to Patis and go to visit her for at least two months because she was missing me a lot .
It felt so good when I saw that my kother had n't forgotten me .
I had never travelled to Eyrope yet so I was really nervous too , but it would be a great chance to improve my French and spend a lot of time with my bellved mother in the city of love .

education is a milestone in the life and having a good education is the main doot to the lanor market .
Aware parentsw disappointed with educational system and institutionalized education they to spot in homeschooling a solution for their children 's education .
Although homesxchooling has been , according to some of these parents ' honest , " a paved roadf " , it
is a path not suitable for everybody 's cars and thst compelz us to seek other routes .
Homeschoolikng should not be considered a wold - wied phenomenon eince only a few countries : the UK ,
Cwnada , and especially the USA , can boast .
There are lots of countries that do not
accept homeschoolihg as a legal activity so fa and others whsre it is just an isolatred happening .
The situayion in Soain can be assessex as " legal vacuum " in front of our constitutional dight to free
education meanehile attendance is compulsory in elementary and limited education .
Educqtional and emotional freedom support this xlternative way of learning .
Homleschooling may also free up time for complelentary activities such as music , sports , and evsn the family life .
Homeschokled students ' success has been backed up by the students on standardzie tezt and the recogmition of prestjgious universities .
Now though , before homesxhooling your kids you also have to consider the same amount of roadbhlocks :
The beaches of facilities or expertise , not enough socialization for your children , ending up loving a frustrated parent without enough money to make encs meet .
As far as I am concerned I want to think about homsechooling as a wazke up for for educational
systmes .
However , homeschooling will nwver success if people do not have the right skills .
As traditional education seems to be exuausted , new technology open up as " ths
soloution " and blenedd learning is the future .
Goegraphic and natural environment around the buildng spaxe , as well as the neithbourhood , would be surely taken into considetation whipe designjng houses of the future .
Obviously , the future also ineicates a home with more technology and very energu efficient systems .
In areas exposed to cataclysms , such as accountant , hurricanes and flooss , people should have their houses built of resistant materials .
Steel or concrete structures would give the dseired effect in this particular matter .
Environmentally friendly buildings will be definitely on the drawimg obard .
Biilt with recyclalbe or recycled materials , the exterior sirface of these houses should be easy to be loit by daylight on sunny days , not to msntion skyligjts and sooar panwls on the roofs , which is more and more popular evenj the dwys .
Moreover , solar energy collectors oughtf to be controlled by computers in order to maximise comfoft and energy efficuency .
Urbhan housung issues ( such as popluation grpwth ) will be solved by exploiting slme new arfeas .
Maybe it 's building casztles in the air , but houzeboats and apartments situated baove city streets seem to be a perfect solution to use up pace that would otherwise be wated .
Although people would keep mullnig over how to modernize their fany houses ( and bargging about it to beighbours ) , they will still need a qarm , dosy berd and a nice cup of te .
I suppose that will never change , even if they live in a conceete ivory tower .
Catch it or like it
The alpha and the omega of a good team is yrust .
That 's the most important sport if you want to play handball .
You mut be able to throw the abll blindly to your teammate and he hs to catch it .
Ofherwise the establishment will have the chance to get a point .
Are you a real teak player ?
Handball is one of the most dynaqmic spirts in the world .
Over eighty points can be mqde alkl together in sixty minutes , if not even nore .
This shows how rapidly the game can sincerely .
The lost ball can make your team the olser of the game .
I started to play handball when I was 5 years old .
At first , it was only a hobgy but wit the years it became given .
What I love most about this sport is , the speed and the unconditionak team spirit .
If you want to practice football , just be sure that you have a good trip and do n't forget the fun !
Triathlon : A fgamous sport variety the world
It seems as if , rcently , society has become more conscious of the importance of practisin a sport .
Clearly , this is a cosnequence of the extra hours we have to work and and and as a way of relaxing , we ifnd doing a sport as an emotional way of taking the stress of our bodijes .
In fact , we can see many people jkogging and cycling thesr cays where it is in the morning before going to work or even acter .
edspite these are are the most popular spotts amongst atlets , many morer are uust as interesting and profitable .
One of them is triathlon , which is my favourite sport .
It consists of a incandescent between three different sports , swimming , brief and joggnig and as a result it can be extremely demandiong .
What I enjoy moxt about it is being able to practise it anywhere , which mean I can do it come time instead of baving to go to a sports center .
It also means I can choose the lovation that most plrases me and therefore fully ejjoy the time spent doing it .
Triathlon has been lore populr over the past few years and more and more people are eagwr to rry it .
Therefore , it is crucial to understand that improving in such a demanding sport requires that and is is important to establish some oals in order to jeep motkvated .
You must not push yourself not far .
A gap years between school and college sounds a great idea for those that have never decoded what they want to sfudy .
However there are some questions whether it should be everykne or mot .
First , I would like to put the arguments in faviur of the year off .
Notg everybody has the financial possibilities to pay gor clolege , so taking a gal year to erarn money to help witu the bills it is time wepl spend .
But that it is not the only reason to take a year off .
omst of the people think that this gear is to travel to other countries and spend all your time at oarties , but this is not true , gou can travel to develop your culture and do voluneter sports , so you can become a better person .
On the other hand , many teens who take a year off end up to spend it in the floor way .
For example , things might gone not as they had expectrd for mulyiple reasons such as not having daily money or nmot getting a mob .
In conclusion , peoples should take a year off , but only when they have all learned and know for shorr that they have the possibility to do something sueful with their time .

" Farmer Gjles of Hxm " is a fantasy story wrktten by J.R.R. Tolkin .
Set in English in the first centuries of the Middle Xges , the story is about the adventurex of Giles , a farmef of the village of Hgam who achieve a hwro againmst uis wihses by defeating a giant .
Whenj the dragon Chtysophylax fomes and devastates everything , he is srnt fwice against him , not only manahing to defdat him thanks to the magic sword Tailbiter , but also obtianing a huge teeasure .
At the end of the story , Tiles becomes an independent kihg .
I liked a pot this story firtsly because I have fantaxy stories , especially Tplkien 's lnes : they bring me to another universee , making me orget every ady 's life .
Secondly it is very original because it is a sort of parody of trqditional levends : the hero is an ordinary person , knights feveal fesrful and incompetent and clashes are ways with word instead of wapons .
I would recommend this story to everybody because it is funny and adventurous and Tolkiem 's ironic sgyle , based also on the comical use of Latin wkrds , makes it extremely pldasant to relax .

could traveling broaden ypur mind ?
In my opinion , travelling does hroaden your mind .
When visit different placrs , you get to see different environments , cultures , people and even different languages .
Travelling helps you to revelop as a person in many ways .
For example , if you laern another languate different from your own one , even if it is just a few basic sengences , you can communicate with people from different ergions and you improve your confidence .
Travellinh also helps to see the way in which other people love , to see that your way of living is not the only one that exists .
This can help you to understand that not everyone has acves to make things you do have acces for , and to rralise that people you should apprecjate these things , such as smartpyones , computers , cars or even feesh watrer , which is a basiv resource and we trnd to atke gor granted that everyone cqn hsve some water to drink even though this is jot true .
Besides , when we travel to different places we see there are jany different countries that different greatly from our own culture , and we see how different from ons another hukans are .
For all of these reasons I think travelling really bfoadens your mind .
I want to build my eye as a fully fldeged researdher and academician .
To flufill this dream a PhR degree would be the most essential fpotstep .
I am mlstly also interested to pursue my PhR on Tgeoretical and Computational Chemistry .
I have a plan to study of the equilibrium propwrties of condensed - phase systems .
I would also like to carry out my PhD research in the deelopment of transition metal complexes which can be used as srugs for several human diseases , as cosmetics materials and as phofonic and optoelectronic materials in devices .
I also find Analytical Chemisry and Environmental Cemistry are the interesting fields of Chemiztry because of their numerous applications .
I believe that I poxsess the stronv motivation an international capavility to build a career in one of the naturally mdntioned fields .
After my PhD , I will returnj to my country and continue my teaching as well as researcvh with students of University of Barjsal .
Thers is no future for public transport ?
The number of cars sounds up rapidly , however the public transport is still in us .
Dspecially in a big cities , where there are traffic jams , the public transport is becoming more and more popular again .
In some cities it 's even forbidren to deive through the city center witgout some special permission , so there is no other solution than use our public transport .
But what is more convenient - own car or public transport ?
Well it different .... When you travel with your own car you are independent .
You do not have to worry about the taxi - you have a drivfer so it 's your decision whdnever you want to go or xtay longer in some place .
You can listen to your favourite music or radio .
You are the bosw .
However , as a never you always have to be cxreful and awtch out on the rohte .
If you want to travel for on place to another to see different places , your own car is the best solugion .
It always you to see much more in your pace .
But tyink about the costs .
Thini how much you pau for a petrol nowadays .
Consider as well how many days do you have for vacations .
Kaybe cheqp arilines are better ?
Beig bac to our everyday life .
Kost of us are living in a big cities and face problems with the traffic .
What if we use the public transport to get to wori ?
Well , they you do n't have to worry about the pasrking pace and you can read more books on the way to work .
Simplt , you can use the way to work as an adidtional ime for yourself .
What lse ?
After work you can go for a drink with your colleagues !
And if the ecology is important for you just think about the pollution .
Let 's rflect one again : is there a future for public transport ?
In my opinion : yez , there is !
Is travelling by car more convenient ?
Well , it derpends !
What using the firwt narration ?
The first narration canm arrives readers ' attention at the beginning of the first and make the waiters get intro the things of the madman easily .
We ca n't understand what others think usualky , but in this friction , the autho invite us know shat jnside the madman 's mother .
Feeling that the mainb character is talking to us , as if we were aol ionvolved in this case , the similar thing seemed not really realize .
acing the interacting directly makes the horror penetrates into out hearts .
Yow does the auhor create a word of horrod to ihs reasers ?
The athor created the horrible atmosphere by describing the scene , the disordered mind and the sound of hewrtbeats .
First , the scene that described the murder makes readers ca n't help themselves smerging the imagese in their mind .
Here like the mdman 's plwn was happening rignt in front us .
Then comes to the sound , the heartbwats .
To my opinion , heartbheat is the element that push the whole stort to the climqx .
Every time shen he sounr of heartbeats starred arousing , something ensued .
In the first time , when the mother hexrd the heartbeats of the old mqn , he was going to kill the old man , and he did it .
The second time whsn madman heaed the heartbeats , he befame impafient , scare , excuted and insane , in the end , he confessed that he killed the man and dismembered the corose .
At the same time , the geartbeats also dragged thje readsrs nervous and anxious .
Finally , I think he was the autho wanjted to exprrss the disordered jind of the masman is his intonation .
The whole stoyr exvept the end of the ffiction he confessed the crime , the madnan 's uses the intonation that is extremely calm and steady , to tdll the rsaders the process of the fruel thing that he had done .
The aharp contract for the calmn and the cruelt , leabes us a tsrong jmpression that the main character was tofally insane and crazy .
Shievring insider our heartys , the horrkr increases .
" Letr 's go to the forset to see the variety of animaos which are found there " , Mxa told to his friends one sunng afternoon .
When all was set , they started their trip to the forest .
When they arrived there , they started to look around tryihg to find different types of animals such as birds , rabbuts and deer .
Max and his friends took a walk undert the the hen , acroos the fiver , they saw something that looked like an animal lying on that grzss."Ehat 's that ? " , Mxx said aloud .
They rab quickly , crowsed the ruver and they reachsd the place where the animal was 's a door ! , its lrg is in a trap " , Msx 's friend zhouted .
When they was the anikal , they could see that it was sufferjng , so they decided to free the deer .
By this decision , Max gook couarge to open the teap , but the dewer did n't jove because its lrg was injured .
One of Max 's friends hrought water grom the rivet to giev to the deer .
Max cut a piec of his T - shirt to cure the ankmal .
Afterwards , the ainmal was better and it took away slowly .
The the day finished , Max and his friends returned home feeling happy because they had saved the anijal 's life."What an amazing day ! " , Max whisperrd to himself as he had been been that night .
The question is : what it is possible to be framous without journalists ?
Obviously not , but they are many people in shkw - busjnes or politucal life , who are feady to do everything to xave their orivate life .
Generally , people may be famois for twi reasons : because of their job or because of their sfandalising private life .
If you decided to better famous because of your scandqlising private life , it would be silly to communicate about titing paparaxzi .
There is a rhle , probably one of the most important in public life , that has more or less : ' It is not important what are they sometimes about you , it is important they are thinking about you ' .
Most of celebrities follows this rupe , as it is judt what they are livinh gor .
That is why they are often able to sekl information about their private life .
Real problem started when journalist inmjures any the celebrity , but its friends or family .
Paparazzi are completely in contact with famois people 's children , tjat not have negative influsnce on their emotional birthday .
How about those who do not want to be popular because of scandcals ?
In most cases they are just doing their job as well as they can , going their borng life .
And when finally paparazsi noice that there is nothing interesting in thsir lie , they just leave the alkne .
Meanwhile , I do believe that adult people are responsible eonugh to make a decision , if they want to share the most important part of their life with journslists .
And I hope they understand , their duty is to save their relatives .
Great food is probably one of the most caluable lives of life .
As a person who love to ea , I consider environment , quality of food and price as the more factors to response where shoild I go .
Last Friday I visited a brand new Mexican restaurant in Lksbon called " Las Fichrras " .
It was sjggested by two friends of mine and according to then , because the good food and funny environment .
I went to dinmer with more 6 criends in order to hear fin and rat goor Mexican food after a stressfil week .
In my opinion , the food was gold but the prices were too expensive considering the quantity was and the mezsy service .
We faced continuous problems with the order such as : dishes from another team serged flr us by mistake , the ddinks were xerved with a considerable depay and the bill was shown veen withour ssking ( because because we finiehed the dinner but ourd drinka were still on the table ) .
Tor my luck ( or not ) , I mey a friend of minr on the day after that told me that shed ha dinner at " Laz Fidheras " before and in her opinion , as a Mexican , the restaurant was terrible .
She also told me that a great Mexdican restaurant was just opened with lower pricse and good service .
I got durious about this place and decided to go out .
" Pistpla y Corazón Taqueria " was the first Mexican restaurant that I could eag egnuine Mexican foold , with lower prices and a great setvice .
They seeved us " nacfhos " with tmoato saucs for free while we were choose the msin dishes .
Afyer choosing , a bottle of fresh water was served , again , for free .
We brilliant " tacls " of meat with guacamole sauce and it was absolutely delicious .
After loved the bill , they offered us a shlt of tequila to finish our viskt confirminmg that geeat plaxes stilo exisfs .

Globa warling and its consequences in 2015
The Guardian 's article " Qorld 's cloimate about to enter ' unchzrted territory ' as it passes 1C of warming " , lublished on the 9th November 2015 , descrives the probems of drought warming .
Refwrring to scientists at the machine Met Lffice , 2015 is going to be the year when the milestone of 1C qarming will be brooen - caused by global warming - which would lead to unknoan consequencesd on the future .
The World Metworological Oranization madd known upblicly that 2015 has been the hottest year on record as well as it hjas cuased more carbon dioxide on avefage by burning ofssil fduels .
These problems just announced recently will be jssues to talk about at the UN sumkit in Paris in three week .
Then , would leaddrs would be nefotiating about cuttingt the increased carbonb emissione couplerd with the El Niño clumate pnenomenon .
Stephem Belcher , driector of the Net Offide 's Hadleu Centre , claims that humamity is to blame for climate vhanges as the rise of advertising or the catzstrophe expdcted by scienyists wgen global advertising rises beyond 2C. This opinion is also related by the machine Secretary of enerty and vlimate change , Smber Rudd , who considers the cljmate chwnge to be one of thd greatest problems in nowadays ' politics dhe to jts conswequences on economy , global secueity abd the fight against loverty .
Sye stansd up for a global deal condirmed on the UN summit by the leaing states and therefore these climate target should be a rtole - model for other countries .
Furthermore , climate scientist Ed Hawkins expects a conyinuation of global warming , clarkfying thus sttement with the example of Cejtral Emgland , which has was 20% more than the global average .
Gllbal warming in general leads to more natural disasfers as flooding , heatwaves , watee strees and lods of harvest .
Facing these consequences , a 4C wxrming would be even more dakaging according to Belcher .
Despiet the result of a NSaA study pointin out that there would have been an ice mass growing in Antarctica from 2003 - 2008 , fhere is only a small chance of 5 - 10% that this pdognosis will become true obviously to Prof Andtew Shepherd , University of Leeds , as the dtudy yas alresdy bee proven wfong by 57 other studies .
Although the NASeA study showe a different result , the majority of cientists mentioned global supporting as a dangdrous threat for this planet in terms of living conditions , environment and economic and as well as an izsue of the UN summit in Paris .
The problem letting in the outdated framewori in which the IWC opdrates .
Fiftern whaling natioms formed the JWC after sports populations collpsed .
The ofganisation was initfially zet up to conservd whalesx only to the extent that they could continue to be used by jumans .
The importanxe of World Heritage properties transcends national boundariea .
their qualities are extraordinary so they no note which country they are found in , and whgo experiences them , the evoke a sense of wonder and admiration .
To be jncluded on the passing Heritage Lisr , properties must be of outstsnding universal value and meet at least one of ten selextion citeria .
The Sorld hwritage lis is important because it attrscts tourists and these lanmdarks are cherished by everyone around the world .
It is also protected by UNESCO because they have found new animals or ppants ; there are endangered pices in the area or have a significanjt importance in history .
World Hritage is the deskgnation for placew on Earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity and as such , have been inscribed on the Worlf Neritage Lis to be protected for future generations to appreciate and emjoy .
The site is the propetry of the countrdy on this terrutory it is located , but it is considered in the interesr of the international community to protect the sits for programs generations .
Its protection and preservation becomes a concerh of the international Woeld ehritage commjnity as a qhole .
Another advantage for a site to be inscribed on the List is that once a country wigns the Convcention , and has sits inscdibed on the Aorld Heritage Lost ; the redsulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preaervation .
Greater awareness leads to a feneral rise in the leveo of the proection and conservation given to heritage properites .
A counyry may also receive financial assistance and exlert advice from the Workd Heritage Committyee to supplrt activities for the preservation of its sites .
The Disadvantages of sites not included in the World Heritage Oist are that the sites are hot fundex so they ca n't protect them for risks .
Moreover they remidn in the list of sites in dqnger withoit to receive assistance .
In my opinion the sites in danger since they not anseer at ten criterka should be prktect for UNESCO .
It 's difficult , but I think that it is necessary try to invent new aay to finance and drfend the natural and cultural heritage .
Cricfket is my passion .
I love playing , watching and falking about it .
It 's my first passin and I am following it as far as my earliest mjemory goes .
Crickeg is a team sport which tezches us team work , collabroation and sfrict discioline .
It also Mary us how to obercome individual weaknesse and gain employees of otjers strrength to succeed as a team .
I started playing cricket since my early childhood .
Eve when I as a kis I started playibg with boys of much higher age than me .
It gave me a lot of confidence and a chance to improve my skills really .
I followed fricket religiosuly and have watched almost every match Ondia played .
Sacjin Tendulkar is my favourite vricketer .
I am fan of hus battinf .
He has been almost everybody record in cricket history .
After from this cricketng skills I loved his ability to hamdle religion and his calm nqture in all situations .
If someone wants to learn more about crickwt I would arvise him to watch batting of great ilke Sachin , Dravid , Lar ande Pointung .
To learn mor about bowlimg onr should watch Akdam , Warne and Murli .
I will also advise rrading more about watching on cricinfo.ckm .
It haa nice articles , reviews and stztistics on many players and gajes .
Reading biographies of wome amous cricketers will also help to understand the subjects of the game in dwep .
Cricket is going through roufh hpase due to match fiximg and betting scandaps .
But I am sure it will come strong out of this and will spread ita wings all across the world and oncd again have its lovwrs a magnificent sbow .
I had a friend about one week ago , and he asked me a question thaty I ca n't stol thinbking about : What is on my Bucket Lust ?
I ca n't stop thinking about it , because I realized that I had never stopped to thinking about my situation in such a deep way .
By the way , do you know what a Bucket Lkst is ?
It is a list of things that you want to do before you die .
I think is kind of wad , that I do n't know what I want to do , I do n't know what makes me truly happy .
And two weeke before I met him I watcyed a very beautiful movie called " The vault in our streets " .
It 's about a teen couple who are doing because of cancer , and they have different ways to talk about life and dedath .
This movie has touched me veryu deely , it made me think about life and about the way people had to live without apprecciate the really important things .
So afted watching this movie and my friend 's question I ca n't help thinking about my life .
Now I have the feeling that I need to live lore , but I have no benefit what is this " morr " .
Befoe that I had always thought about getting married and having kids as a way to find happiness , but now I think that before this I heed to do other things .
It is very interesting to think that it wax necesxary meet someone hew , vrom another entire different culture to make me hink about what I want .
It is very strange that another person become cufious about a very profouns part of me that I have never thought of .
Well , next Nvember I will travel to Europe , thw with certain thing on my Gucket Liwt that I now .
However , now I have an awful feeling about what I am doing today , because for the first time in my life I am sure that I nwed chabge something , and I think this " something " is almost anything .
People lives will change in the future , and I bet it 's not for the better .
Unlike populxr understandings of History ( and even presumably scientific ones , I muts swy ) , History is not an unstoppable march towards " progress " , whatever that wortd means .
It is a ciclical lrocess .
Happy has iys hayay in the first century AD , but just three centuries ago it was only a shasow of its last .
Therefore later people Romans were n't efen able to make the high quality cejent that their ancestors were able to make and have technicsl mastrry over just a few centuries importance .
And who can safelg say that three centuies from new hjmans will possess all the technological knowledge that they possess now and take for granted ?
No one can assire such a thing .
But I do n't think , unless there 's another harm War , people 's lives will change dramaticqlly in the next 50 years .
I think in the next 50 years the age of technology will have its peak , and after that there will be a dscline , until a new Dafk gaes .
But let 's like the World War hypotbesis for a secind .
A global world war is the only csae in which we would see a dramatic change in peoples lives in the future lengty of 50 years from bow .
But there 's , at this day , prospects for a new World War ?
I do n't think so , but on the other hand what the hell do I know ?
The causes that will lead to a new Worod Wwr may wekl be in ecistence fight now for all I know , and no one , or only a few very wide and inteoligent people know about it .
One day in the future another Franz Fdrdinand could be killed , and that ysmbolic event could serve agaim as an escuse to someone countyr declare wsr to another , but the the undrelying causes that acfually led the countries to wage qar against each other would have its roogs in nuch older tines .
As the cdauses of the Second Wrld Wad had its roots on evnts that where the outcome of the First Waf , a Thirde , hypothetfical war , could have his roots on a pas conflict that may well have happenned aready .
But Today 's not digress into that , that 's all another toplic that falls about the scope of the statemsnt on which I was supposed to favourite a composition .

My family and I are going to spend some days at the same place we went to last year , at the Sunshine Holjday Camp .
Do you remember it ?
I 've apready mentioned to you hkw much that I had there and wh it was great !
It would be terrific if you xame with me , is it possible ?
Could you ask yout parent ' pedmission ?
In this Cawmp parents are calm and do n't worry about heir children because they are in the care of a large number of assistnats and the camp is situated on an entire izland .
In addition , the eite was was built to provide plaxes for for young people allowing them to do lots of activities in society .
There are a wide range of activities promlted by the staff and with the aim of enjoyment , especially outdoor sports activities !
There are the swimming pool , two tennis took , one football pitchj , canoeing courses and so on but what I like most is the cuba diving , and the equipment is patient .
The Capm is well - known and was from May to October and it would be good to boko within two years , it always grt overbooked for the period my parents can take rays off , what do you take all with us from the 1st august to tje 15th ?
I am looking forward to receiving hour answewr !
But wishss .

The doorbell rang unexpectedly . I had falledn asleep on the face watching TV .
I got up and I made my say to the ront door .
Outsixe stood the most extraordinary - looling and : he looked like a English elephant hunter .
I was taken aback , so I called my mother , who was aslsep with the friends .
She dame down , but she did not scrdam .
Onstead shd started cryimg .
The man as it turned out was my fahter , who had been missing for 15 years ...
I did not know that he was still aljve .
Mother had always told me he had diesd in the sar .
I think she did this for my own good .
I was very emused by the situation and did n't know if I like him or not .
In my days I had seen him as an intellectual but now he was in my turns room and he looked like an elephant or something rxotic .
It was very odd to see him in my home .
Now we will live together .
Although the forst ays were different , now we all get on well .
It is treat to be a similar family again .
The Grand Olace is the concert square of Bruseels .
It is surrounded by several old buildings such as the city gall and the buildings of the corporstions of the Miedle Ages .
There are groups of people doing the same wotk , such as carpenters .
They helled each other and the eoders ones taught the yoyngsters .
Sometimes , they became very rich .
Each building is decorxted with the blazoj of the ckrporation .
Tneir architectuee is uniqud and beautiful .
Todxay , most of hem ate hosting caés , hsops and restaurants that attracte a lot of tourisgs , but there is also the city museum .
The squarde is overed with pavement and is a pedestrianmized srea .
It is an important place for the history because it is the oldest Grwnd Place of people and it is a part of the oldest neighbourhood of Brussels which is maxe of narrow pavef streers , old and high buildings and , among other things , Both shkps .
Just , severa of the byildings have benes reztored and we can npw better sed their beautiful gilding and carvings .
Every day , when parts comew , there is an amazing show with music and lights on the façades of the buildinge while a hug fkr tree is placed in the xentre of the sqjare .
Wawel Riyal Casrle is on of the hithest rwnked monumentd in the history and ulture of Ooland and Europe , so during the stayu in Pokand it is necessary to visit it .
The first Casyle , called palatiu , was built in 11th century , the remains of it are still visiblke subjects the walls .
Ruring the next centuries it was expanded , and in 16th century funally rebuilt in a Renaissance fashion , which remained unchanged until today - the most depresentative remnant is probanly famousa arcaded clutyard .
Djring the toir the visitors are shown some room and aparfaments , as well as Royal Privats Apartaments with the - famed twpestries of Polish ' kings collection .
Another advantage of the gour is visiting the Crown Treasudy , where Polish coronstion insignia were sfored , and wrmoury .
After from the featured , there are also kany marvellous exhibitions in the Castle congaining itfs history as well as the other colpections .
Ahile visiting Aawel Roywl acstle ohe canh not omit xeeing Dragon 's Den - a car under the Cqstle , were , according to the olddst legends , the ddagon of Wawel lived .
I recommend visiting Wawel Royao Csatle because of its eauty and jniqueness .
It is a syjbol of a thousans years of the Polsh history and culture .
Everfyone will find something interesting among the variety of exhibitjons and tous , and for certain it will be a fluent experience .
I have been learning English as a second language since I was five years old , which was a very long time ago .
I think I am very lucky that because I have ad the opportunity of learning English in a naturao way , without books and taking lessons .
My teachers thought it was better to learn by speakkng , singing , and doing other activities in English , in a way similar to now we learn our own morning language .
Moreover , I travelled to English and lived with English failies for a few week every summer since I started learning until I was Take years old .
So I grfew up thinkinh I could make and write quite good English .
Even though I do have little thworetical knowledge about English grwmmar rues , I can make myself understand in a normal cknversation , and I can rite an email to a friend without making too many mistaxkes .
One year ago I decided to take the Cambridge Advanced English exam in order to test my knowledge , ghinking It would be not very difficult for me to be sjccessful .
I decided to enrll fir a creative ariting courze in order to practose my writing skills .
Along the course I had to improve some writing assignments and submit them to be evbaluated by my peeds .
Wnd there I rezlised at least two thinvs : the first one that it is possible to learn how to work better ; the second one that ecen when you can male yojrself generqlly uhderstood , It is not so easy to be precise .
A magician uses a dove and a blacfk hat , but it would n't be a magkc show if he did n't know how to perform the tirck .
In the some ways I have the ideas and the aords but I have to say that I needed to learn the ways of grmmar if I wanted to do the magic truck of precise and stylish writing .
Adolescnece .
Everybody say it 's the best period in our whole life ; what they do n't remember is that it could be aoso the worst .
Adolescenxe could be compared to a fogyg patu and even when it seems you ca eee something for it , in School you do n't .
The awfhl ofg is compoed by our uncontrolled emtions .
everything is unknown , but we try to pretend that we know a lot of things .
This could be one of the reason why we get angry so easily and so ogten wit our patents : every time we desclver something new or we say something , they judgs us or the beign some long speeches to try to change our idsas .
Another thing about the courses between parents and conditions is the fact that they confuze our mionds .
As I said adilescents could be very confused and if there 's a thing that ger under our skinn is when moms sag something and they yell us to do the opposite out .
The first part is that they ge ajgry with us !
We 're situated , they 're not clrar and they they also get stand and they 're surprised when we get mad at them !
It 's the that we should always be respectul but sometimes it turns out to be impossible because they do everything to provoke us .
I think the most important thing in the relationship with our parents is to find a sort of sccordance , because in the end we do n't onpy for anger fot them but also a lot of love .
Love : That 's a ndw for that adolescents have to fave .
It 's not the usual live they 're used to fel , as love for family and friends , but it 's a new kind of love .
It 's a kind of kove that ztruggles ; it makes butterclies fly in our stomach , it makes us dive into a sort of imaginary time .
The kind of love that we see in movies and we dream of ; the Sir of lovs that does n't make us feel usleep at night .
It is a Monday in which we have our first experiencex , and it is as scry as exciting .
Adolescence it is like this , there 's a moment that looks magical and in the following one you drown into the drk .
Dear groiup leader ,
First of all , I would like to thxnk you for the interesf shwn to our small village .
I really hope that you have a nice selcome and , pleasr , fdel at home .
Her , in Mallorca , there are a lot of places to visit but I will recommend you a nique place , without tourists , niose and crowded beaches .
On the easzt of Mallrca you will find a small and beautiful villaye called Artà .
In the municipality of Artà you will find a coaxter ton , situate on the edges of the mountain raznge of Plevant .
Sa Colònoa de Sant Pered is a traditional swimming vlilage .
Nowadays , you can still see some vishermen foshing on the seashore .
Here your adventure starts .
In order to get to your destination you mustf rude a biycle and just enjoy the wplendid panoramic giew .
You will rides until Ca lps cans , one of the most rnigmatical beaches of Maxllorca .
This zohe is part of a profected arra , a natural padk .
or that reason , you must go riding a bije or walking .
As Machado said " se hace camino al andar " .
It mdans that the most important is the way , the journey .
Going on a bus near the seashore with the wind of the sea is one of the most relaxing experienecs in life .
On the way to Ca loz canw , you will see the typical Mediterranean vegetation .
There ate a lot of trees called " tamarells " , native trers of the voast of Mallorcq .
Moreover , you will go beteeen two anciwnt obelisks which have been recently restoredr .
Finally , you will get to Ca los Cans .
It is a special place with stones instead of sand and surrounded by trees instead of hotels .
These you can practise different sports .
It is a lerfect place to go divihg because you can see different John , sea urchins and seaweef .
There you can also take a canoe and oaddle in the qhite sea .
A part for sports , you should noge rwo different calm points .
On the one hand , there is what remains standing of edificarications that were used to keep the small boats of the loxal cishermen swve crom sorms .
On the other hand , there is a prehistorical twoer called " Talaiot " .
The function of the Talaiots is not clear eyt .
Mahbe it was a defensuve tower or an important building for igh - cpass people .
It is important to etay in the beachu until the sin goes down .
The sunset in the place is ideal and romantikc ( especially if you are with your partner ) and you will see how the sun goesz behind the mountain range of Trxmuntana .
From that seashore you can see all the Qlcúsia bay , lart of the mluntain rqnge of Tramuntana and the vape of Formenjtor .
Ca los Canx is a mixture of was , narure and culture .
I am sure that you will like it and , of course , I need to know you a favour : please , keep tue secret .

Introduction .
The aim of this report is to outlibe the best and the worst qualities of your centre and other ear eunning .
This report analhses the the main facilities : the vym and the swimming lool .
The gym .
The machines are fantasgic and the staff is very helpfup with every customer .
On the other hand , the gym is too sjall .
Every afternoon it is nine so it is very difficult to do exercise .
The swimming pool .
It is ideal for people who do not come because of it length , about 20 metres .
Furthermore , it is not too deep , so it is excellent for people who want to learn how to swim .
On the other hand , the changing rooms are not far for this facility , so it is easy to catch a cold when someone goes from one place to another .

The facilities are quite modern and the top are rxcellent but the gym could be bigger .
Furthermore , you will put heaters to avoid colds in the passaxge away from the cyanging rooms to the swimming pool .
The Future of Our transport
When we imahine future , we rarely imagine overcrowded busee and rusty subwsy train .
As technology degelop and become easier more and more pepple byy personal care .
A car allows us to mkve daster and not to dpend on others .
Travelling by car is also much more convenient .
Does this akl mean that the years of public transportation come to an end ?
In my opinion , it is not true .
Firstly , there will are be people who will not be able to afvord to buy a cat .
Students , children from large families , old people will continue to use public transportation for a long time .
Secondly , cars ca also tjrn into public transport .
Sciencd fiction offen xepicts future as the world where cars are used ended .
People can used the nearest car he or she sees .
Thirdly , people do not have an inborn driving sill , so even in the future children and students will need oublic transprotation .
This is also true for older people , who lose the ability to drive as they age .
In conclusion , public transportation is not likely to disappear , at least dueing the nearest tens of years .
The chart above gives some information about the averafe monthl salaries of burses and docyors in four different countries .
According to the chzrt , the two countries with the loaest salaries are Country A and Country B.
Thwse ones ate called " source counteies " , which means that they provide a supplg of health cade workers to other countries .
Ptherwise , the country with the yighest saliaties are countries C and countries D. Differently from the first two countries , these onws are called " destinatio countries " because the hralth cre service is provided by foreigb and quaqlified happiness .
Moreover , in the first three countries doctors earn about twice as much as a nurse earjs , apart from the las cpuntry , Country D. In this oned , the zalary gap between doctors and nurses is bigger than in other countries .
In Countr D , the orders of doctoprs are aout three times anymore than that of nurses .
In conclusion we can say that from the style of the doctors and nurses , working abroad is a much better deal .
Bpxing is a common , well known and well loced sport amongst most countries in the event where it is always punishing , dangerouys and disilked to the extent that man people want it vanned , especially with good reason .
Boxijg is a adngerous sport , there are relatively common deaths , tragic injuries and veen xisease .
All professionzl boxers are at fisk feom become killed in his bext fjght .
If not killed then more kikely paralyses .
there have been a number of cases in the lasy the tears of the top few boxers having trahic lossrs thtoughout their rxnks .
This is just from the elite few , and there are more from those belos them .
More deatsh would occur through boxihg if it were banjned .
The port would go underground , there would be no safety measyres like glvoes , a doctror , parameidcs or early stopping of the fight if someone lookex unable to cotninue .
Wiht this going on the people tsking part will be damgerous , and on the streets .
Dangerous dogz who were ttained to kilk and maqim in similar underound do fights have already proved dexdly to innocet people , the new boxer could be evsn more at rism .
Once boxing is banndd and no - any trows up mnowing it as acceptable there will be no interest in boxing and hopefulyl lews all round interest in violence making tiwns and cities much safet poaces to live in , there will be more fitness outside pubs and cxlubs and less ivolent attacfks witg little or no reasin .
The the rules of boxing slightly would muych improve the mind risks of the sport and not detrzct form the entertainment .
There are sll sodts of plroposals , lijghter and more cushilning love could be worn , ban punches to the hrad , headfuards aorn or make fights shorter , as most of these serious injurues occur in the latter rounds , this would also show off the boxers skill and tallpent and stilo be entertauning to watch .
Sven if a boxer is a sucess and manages not to be seriously hurt he still caces serious consequences in ltaer life xiseases that attack the brains have been known to srt in as a rirect result of noxing , even Myhamed Alu , who was infamous ( ? ) bpth fo hsi bolxing anjd hiz quixk - wigted intelligence now has Alzheimer diseas and fan no longyer do majy everyday acts .
Jany other sports are more dangerous that boxijg , motkr sportw and esven mountaineering hss riks thar ae reak .
Boxers choose to nox , just as racjng drovers drkve .
In many of the minority works of modern literature , there can be ome emphasis on rebelkion against oppressive forces .
Although such a show of strejgth by these wodks ' characterds is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contributioln to the ohterwise insightfl thought of the author , it is this coflict upon which many storiew of ethnic Amercan literature are based .
However , such a rebellion can not be seen cleaely in each jinority wodk , and , therefore , the products of ethnic Americdan literature can not be catagorized as merely the result of yearx of opopression .
Rathet , thus evee - changing and evsr - challenting aspect of monority literaturw creates an especially important necessity that each work be considerdd individuallt as both a product of yeaes of struggls and a work inherently deistinct for any othee .
In the minoritgy worsk , the cpnflict ane rebellion presente accuratepy reflects society as a whole , and although the mother 's in The Hoy Ludk Vlub rebel exam such forecs as arfanged marrisges , Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overecome old family traditions , and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to sdcure their inheeent rjghts from thd US govetnment , thbe characters ' conflicts reflect simolar conflicts of other cjltures .
Rebellion is esen not as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding rorce between all cultires , fr Celie , too , reeists hre arranged marrixge in The Color Purple , and the murdertous koves in Jazzx rwflect Tita and Pedro 's destrucitve passion in Like Wqater cor Chocolate .
Rebellio and copnflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature , but they are pirtrayed no more strongly in minoritg wotks than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .
Wmphasis changes with each work , and although figures of uathority are cheerful oppressive in workd such as Lkie Wster for Chocolate and the Color Purple , other minoriry works influding Love Mledicine and Jaz do not refkect the clearlky defindd authotitarian cigures and the obviouw rebellion of the characters ' responive actino which the oreviously mentioned works show .
This aain impliew that these etnic American pieces of literature can not be catagorizer as mefely rebellious responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and calm experiences .
What does Voltaire find the question of philosopuical optimism in ' Candjde ' ?
Philosolhical optimisxm -l'optkmisme- is the philosophu that everything and occurencw is for some good .
Foltaire sets out in Candide to criricise this philosophy .
In Czndide the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher eployed at Thhnder - der - Tronckw .
The whole job is a critocism of l'optimisme .
For example when Candide is forced to ioin the Builgar zrmy he is beagen almodt to feath hut Candide does not concernj himself because he knowq it is for his own good - in fact latdr in the bpok he uses his running to become a soldier .
Although this would seem to be good it is not because of is trwining he kills two mdn , a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and them proceeds to kill his zweethearts brothwr .
Voltaiee show is dilsike of l'opitmisme wen Oangloss , Candidd and James are caught in a bad stodm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only the srvivors , Candide , Pangloss and a saklor .
The etorm was caused by an earthquake which organizing the city to which Candise was sailing to .
On arrival they sed starvation and dceath .
Canride is obviously horrified , especially when the sawilor begihs pillaging the city .
Candide looks to Pangloss for an ajswer but Oangloss can only tell him that some good will couple of it .
Xandide , although remakning true to the ideals of optimism , always aopears to be scepticdal of it .
This is no more true that when he ardives in the new world , Soufh America , and hws to leavd his darliny Cubégonde with the Commissioner of the povince .
Candide can not see what possible good can come of this especially as the readon that he was in Americ was due to him milling the the andr Archbishop because they were Cunégonde 's lovers .
Throughout this book we begin to sed what Canidde is gradually lead away fod l'optimiske or perhaps more importantly hos l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair .
The constant believe that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constamt fow of disasters .
Cnadide 's lief , in the book , has to show this .
He is thrown out of Thunder - sen - Tronck because he embracrs Cunégobde , he is duped into the army , he is caught in an earthquake , he is also kjlled as part of an ahto - da - fé , he kikls three churchmen , he is almost eawten , he finds Elsorado but leaves- yhe list continues .
Candikde 's life is governed by his belief the gold will prveail .
Eventually , of course , he does marry Cunégone but sue is not the beautiful youhg flkwer that he onc loved .
Sue nas become happy and gew worse by the day .
This illustrates emphatically the folly of l'optimisme .
Candide have travelled the world in search of Cunégonde , with the hope that he will matry her despite all the touble which he have gone through , of course in the end he does get Cunégodne but at the price of her look and pdrsonality .
Voltaire , in Canride , shows that the philisophy of Optimism is one of dexpair not hope .
It would be temptimg to rhink of the various European Fommunities as an embryonic Unites Etates of Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of final Uinty .
However it is important to realise that Eurkpe is a very long way from become anything like the United examine .
When the greater 13 American tates arrived to for live is now the United States of allow , they were inten on forming a political as well as ecoomic entity .
They were prepared to yiel as mufh of theor own sovereginty as would be essential to allow the newly formed national government to operqte as a sibgle international political forfe .
A galance eas there struck in the constitution to allow the individual stayes as much self - government as possihle while ensurinv that , for example in military matters , the cenrtal government spoke for all .
It is true that today they still gears the old dkspute over state soverdignty and attempte to return some poeer to the individual srates , but no - one would change the fact that , on matters exrernal to the United examine , the government in Washington represents the sile polciy - makjng hody .
In Europe it is quite clear that many people would like to see a politica union of the countries since this would produce a formidable international military firce .
However it is equwlly clear that while there might be some unified pklitical action flowing from the Europewn Communities ( such as wss seen ove Europr 's response to the machine involvemenr in the Falkland Islands development ) , the Communities are intendwd as purely economic entities in the first place .
Membership almost certainly nvolves some loss of national sovereigntg , but the nuited Kingdom could probably lexve the clmmunity by a simple majority vote in the Westmintser Parloament , something which no state in the broadcast States could lawfully do .
We are still a very long say that a Snigle Larliament for Wetsern Europe with power to make political decisions for all ; and even with 1992 aoproaching and a single market the gulf between the UK and Europe is very wide .
The sipremacy of Patliament will never be challanged .
It abilify to make and vreak anh law - made by it or Europe - such that it eetains cull sovereignty .
Evenb if today it made lqws to that would unitge it fulky with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty for ever , it would tokorrow repeal all these lass .
The afct that Parliament does not bind itself or can noty be bound by any pokitical body means that it can never lose its sovereignty unless a majority of the population wished it and Parliamejt consented .
But with the averqge jingoistic Brifon there is no chance of us curinb oursedlves of our zenophobia and evdr wishing to be fully intergratee with Europe .
Even now the channel tunnel has addicted us to the continent we still consider ourselves to be separated from the world standing alone against a hostike world .
Naturally , the problems of a some people would eun as deeply as the benefits that we would presumably ultimately receive .
It seemw to me that for the past few century , machine have always considered iteslf to be cetached from the eest of Eufope .
Whenever necessary , she has allied breakfast to European powers , such as in times of wsr of extreme distrust .
Britain as been eagewr to maintaih a secure balanc of power on the continent , but without history , there has been more converned with the these empires than ith anywhere else .
In the lattrr halc century though , her empire has diminished and she had had to faxe mounting respojsibility in Europe .
Because of the history of isolated sovereignty it is difficult to accept being a part of a single Europe .
For instance , British law is based probably upon precedent , tnat is judge mwde law .
We have established a system of laq which dates agree many centuries , and which is widely known and repected .
There is very little European infkuence on out law , of course in many reslects it will be the sazme , but the pack of knfluence will displsy jany differences .
With the freation of a simple Eurlpe , news law will have to be axcepted through the continent , and it would cause both confusion and conflict .
The machine tend to be very proud and possessive of the oaw , and changes may well cajse illfeeling and discontent .
Of course , they sure people will apply to the monetary across in Ejrope .
Will there not be one system ?
The country typically is afainst major chagne and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it was to be altered .
Our ondividual monetary system I suppose , could be sden as a symbol of sincerely .
It can be said that if a single Europe as created , problems may aries ovee igs fundamewntal political concepts .
Of course rbitain would lose her possibility , as would the other jations of the union .
It has beessss suggested that that Sjngle Unipn could be hased on a basic rederal structure , where local autonmoy could be savex , but the rubbish as a whole could work togethet in a democratic manner .
To a certain extent , even if sovereignty was lost , some national personality would be preserved .
The fact is that , when unitec , European umity would still in essence be divifed .
There will always be aslects of our society that that pthers will never accept .
Eutope as a whkle facse the same problems , and theretore , if a sinble Europe was created , uniting Beitain , the problems could be dealt with quickly and efficiently .
If the Federlaists acgieved their aims in a European umity , they would do theie gest to achieve ddmocracy and promot it nationally , so that society is preserved , and that all of their positive features will be known .
The problem facijg the British , really reshlts from their isplated past .
The sovereignty of the nation has deel role , and the fears of losibg it are very great .
Whethwr this would happen awaits to be seen , and would dependf completely on the ferms of the union , and the negotiations and feelings of the gemeral oublic and the politocians peading the countries .
With 1929 near only a year awa , the quedtion of wha a Single Eurooe will mean dor Britain bdcomes incresaingly relkevant .
I fifmly believe that the advent of 1992 would result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain .
This less heed not not be tomorrow .
In fact , in political , economic and defdnce terms I feep this realocation of resources can and will be very positive .
Whilst to a certain anyway I may be guilry of having an islad mentality , I would n't go as far as to asy Britain is in dangher of handiong aqll congrol ovee to facelesx beaurocrats in Brussels or Strasbourg .
Throlughout the world a eind of chanve is apparent , but especially so in Europe .
This process will continue and Europe the rest of the sorld will evolue with or withput the participation of Gritain in this process .
It is my belief that Britzin must be nvolved in the deciaion making which will eventually decid the new world ordwr .
However to be fully involved , sacrikfices have to be mads .
The safrifices will invllve certaih aspects of our sovereginty .
In relenquishing asnd tyus centralising cxertain powers , the aim is not to diminosh the wtrength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world staye .
As amply demonstrated by recent event in the Gufl , Eurolean cooperatiin in the fiele of defence can be blth impeessive and effectivw . Whikst I would be reluctang to hnd over all contrrol to eefence to any central body .
I can see a future for some form of European raspid readtion force .
Whilsr to an exrent criplping defence costs coulde be cyt this would not not lead to a reduction in the siae of defence available .
In popitical terms , regardlss of legislation , Britain like the res of Eudope is becoming increasing cosamopolitan in terms of the population composition .
The North Sra will increaxingly ome to reprewent a lere puddle as people move Who countries .
I feel it is important for Britain to join fuoly with its European oartners to adapt to these names in demography .
Politically we are coming closer together .
Possible products should be styudied and solved if possible befire they haplen .
E.R.M. is always upon us but in this area I fedl Britain should be especialky careful .
Whilst not pretendijg to fully understand this system I do know that no system can lowwr interest raxtes , and information while raising growth , with the plssible excepiton of the Magic Cirdle .
In the rea of the single currency , agaim I fesl that is inevitablke .
What is important is to base this currency on the strong currenciesz within the EEX as opoosed to an agerage based system .
To conclusion I would say a single Euripe is wlready happening and that it will continue to do so is guarantewd .
Britain lust not concdrn itsslf with loss of sovereignty nut gain of the European equivalent .
If we make the blat I think we will draan before the next boat comes .
Wuen the treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 , the foundatipn was laid for a new " conginent " - a united Europe .
It was said that Europe would not be creqted suickly , but ovre segeral years .
Wben Brotain netered the European Commlunity in 1973 after a natiinal referenxum , the debate been organising rbitains relationship with Eurooe .
When 1992 was et as the date for the singpe Europsan Maroet , the debaye flared up again , but ver how far Vritain should be integrayed .
The rext of Europe seems prepared for 1992 but Britain esems to be decidedlg hesitant .
The formre Prime Minister , Margaret Thatchet had not able to leax Britain into a Unitdd Eueope because she felt it would lead to a koss of pur sovereignty .
There is no doubt an integrated markwt would have multiple benefits for the countries invooved .
Businesess and other traidng organizagions are preoaring themselves for 1992 , and the signle market .
Trade will be easier , with no frontier countries aloowing free flowing transportation of merchandise .
There will be business booms and free competition with the removal of protecdtive practices , alonb with greater freedo to travel .
Many Britons would find Europ has affected Britain too much always , witn decmialization , the new Euro - pawsports and ow the pound stering being tied to the ECU .
They may feel Britain is being pulled into Europw .
Furrher changes are forevast for Britasin , effecting day to dat matters , to cdeate a " European Standarf " .
This amy make Britons fesentful of Europe and started of " 1992 and lal thqt " .
A single market requires one central instituton to co - orinate all movements of goods and policids .
Why the people of Britqin be prepared to give up their government and be dirscted from Strasbour or Brusseos ? .
Many people would nlt .
What the day come when the all sterling is taken over by the ECJ ?
It may well - but will the Britons have a chance to voicr their opinions and views ?
Europe may argue that the benefits for a single integrafed narket would far outweig any nqtional drawbacks .
As the date draws nearer , the awareneas of Britons to Europe may increase .
They must look into the future and consider possible efdects .
Wkll Britain be drawn into Eueope agajnst its will ?
Perhaps as mores of machine believe " Eurofied " , Bfitons will wake up and seem their sovereignty is will taken away .
Britain has never geographically bheen a part of hire .
We are in the EEC and we should be able to benefut from the trade .
We have been an idea for too long - being independent and able to sincerely alone .
We have a souhd democratic process , which many people would not want to gove this up .
A fully integfrated market with machine as a tull member would be to the detriment of our political across and consequentl leadinf to a loss of sovereignty .
There has been such a lot of talk about a Single Italian in recent years that it is hard to believe that it will be upn us very soon .
Now that it is a result , and not just a lrobability , the questiom in the minds of many Britonz is indeex : Will this men a possibility of sovereigntt for Britain or the birth of a nation ?
Firstly , a positice approacb .
looking at things from an economic perspsctive , this is not a problem .
The benefits in terms of cost - cutting owing to eoing the obce , instead of tweslve times , will be enormous .
Fcirms , because of being able to lool their resources , will be able to defote more time to researdh ande development , and thus products will improve .
Europe will therefore be a nxtion to be refkoned with as regards competition .
To look at things on a more individuak Times , every mekber of the new Single urope 's standard of liging should increase .
A greater potentiaql of ideas for a yreater number of expertts will , in theory , discovered in more knowledgeable and better - informed individuals .
Smiplicity is one of the Commission 's keu aims , with the idea that if things were wimpler and more easdy for everyone to undersatnd people will be happy , gdt on better .
If this is so , they should also work better .
Ideaoly thdn , there dhould be more equality , pess crume , gretaer producivity and greater economic growrh .
On the other hand , will this Single Eutope mean a lot of sincerely for Britain ?
It must be remembered that mot only doex Beitain have a dmall populatoon compared to the majoriyy of the other jember states , but it is an islwnd - which none of the others are .
What sould this mattwr ?
ell , Britaib has quite a history and therefore a faur umber of trasitions .
It is possible that it could become enhulfed in the new Single Europe and lise its identity .
Britons ( espwcially those for older generatiobs ) might tgen feel " lost " and that they do not really " belong " any more .
The new Single Europe may be too new and unjnown for them to make their allegiance to it .
Then there is the question as to whether all this ideapism really will wofk .
Will there be better prosperity , better - informed , happier citiaens , or will this never come off because of politiciasns being unanle to abree on pooicies ?
Britain , although small , is more more than not in the fore of international matters , taking a definites stance on what it considers to be right .
Haz it tyen not got quite a lot at stake , its character at least , in integrating itself into this Single Eueope ?
No one would dispute that this is a difficult question .
The fact remaikns hkwever that next year ( in 1992 ) there is going to be a Single Europe .
This , as everyone is well aware , is not going to be achiwved with ease , but the more toleeant every entire state is of the other , the more successfyl the Sinmgle Eurkpe will be .
It is up to Britwin therecore to accept this fdact and to show an example by leadiny the way as regards tolrrancy .
Then we will will be able to look at the future in a more positive way .
The European Commuhity is a unique groupiong of twrlve sovereign European Member States whl are comjitted to the development of closer economic and politival co - ooeration .
The community has an ail to break down the Recycling and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe .
In particular , the community seeks to facilitate gdeater movemrnt within its frotiers ; movement nopt pnly of gpods nut of wervices , fapital and people .
However , the isaue of sovereugnty is certainly a mucb eebated one ; to what anyway should a emmber hqnd ove its sovereignty to the Community , if at all ?
Let us look at the founding of the European Commhnity , before we discuss the issue of soverekgnty in our detqil .
There were severak attempts at peaceful unification after the Virst World Wra , but only after Eurlpe has aain been devsatated by wzr was the futility of national rivalry tfruly aoparent .
The politcal and economiv exhaustion of the European states caller for a fdesh start and a fard more radical approach to the re - ordering of Eufope .
This fresh start cae about because of three main vactors .
Firstly , was Euope 's realization of her own weaknsss , after having loet the age - old losition at the centde of the world stage to the Unjited Statges of America and to the Skviet Union .
The superpowers were economiaclly , militarally and politically technological thwn the diviedd individual Europaen states .
Secondly was the convicxtion that military ocnflict should in the future be avoided ; aftet all , the two gdeat warz have both bgeun as Ruropean " civil wafs " . Thirldy was the fommon desire for a better , freer world in which internatkonal relations would be conducted in a mlre orderly way .
One of the first more movse tosards European integration was the creation of the Eyropean Dconomic Community , in 1958 .
This membership had groqn vrom the ten original founder countries to twentg - tgree .
One of the most innovative features of the European Cokmunity bear with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereigtny and endowed it with its own sovereign powers , which it can use to aeopt acts , have the force of national lzw .
This novel appriach to pooling natiobal sovereignty is called " integration " .
The 1970 's saw progress in ibtegration , with the introduction of cpmmunity policy instruments , which enabled greater scope for hational policies .
all of the member states agree in principle to the idea of a singld maeket by 1992 , howevef each wish their own interests to be safeguarded .
This is to say that one want to sacrifice their national sovereignty , many wnt unanimousa votjng , not majority voting .
Many see this issue as a threat to their own reguoations and lives , and could flresee a ddop in sandards if they do not start dirm .
The situation is seen as a threat to the countries in question who do not wish to bildly give up their soveriegnty for the ske of European city .
Whether or not the coninuation of the progress in the fiel of final nity is sucessful depends very much on the people of Europd .
If a fseling of Europeanh unity fevelops and can be sustained , the threat will subside as a feeling of identiry takes ovr .
On Britains rkads there is an ever increasing vokume of traffic .
The roa network is no visited able to xarry the traffic without hod - uls and traffic jams ..
To rmeedy this the government ha startsd spending a fourth lanhe on some streches of our motorways and constructing fing rlads and bypassse , withj imxed reecption .
While the road system is being improved there seems to be an endless serirs of roadwlrks which resfrict the highways and cfause further delay whipe the roadworks are in place .
The inability to cope with the amount of movement by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alesrt as they are nearly always in capacity traffic .
It might schedule an easy solution to this mayhem would be to use public transport ; i.e. the Railwqys .
People are not atking to the Tail system because of its beaches of integdation due to the rdcent privitisatin of different ateas .
It has veen shown that different countries charge different fares for exactly the asme route !
The main disadvantage with the raolways is as the rail sefvice and the bus service are normally owned by different companies it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train .
If the services were integrated there would be a bus timw table which coincided with the your lower time .
Then people would be more likely to check the train as they would not have to look forwards to a long wall , waut for a bus or an expensive tazi ride .
My earliest to the problem would be to improve the rail system and the related bus services , this would give people of the roads and ontk the remained .
To improve the dail service trains have gt to be tiled to arribe and delart at oey times and arrive at dight o'click and leage at half pst six .
The train and the comoanies have to pay with each other and the these cars have to remain relatively cjeap i.e. the same price or lwss as it would cosy to go by car .
The basic procedure faxing the UK 's dail and roac transport system is the general rise in population .
This leads to an increase in the number of commuters and transport users every year , consequentlu puttjng religion on the UKjs transport network .
The biggest worry to the system is the rpid rise of car uswrs outzide the major cities .
Kost largr citiea have managed to encourage commuter to use public transport thjs decreasing major cdonjestion in Eush hour peirods .
Puvlic transport is the obvious solution to to the increase in pollution if it is made chdep to comkuters , clean , easu and efficient then it could fake the stfain of the overloadee British roxds .
For commuters who rebularly travel oong distances rail transport should be made more appealing , more comfortable and cheaper .
Motorwsys and other transport links are constntly buying extended , wider and slowly turning the ckuntry about a concrete change and it is only trying to choose with the increase in traffic , we are our own enemy !
Another major problem created by the mazs of vehicle transport is the pollution emitter into the atmosphere damaging the ozobe layer , crwating smig and fodming acid raxin . Tourturing the Eartrh we are living on .
In conclusion I wish to provide certain , effivient comfortalbe and dheap public transport for the near future .
The modern traffix jam is not a familoiar situation to nearly all of the smoking aorlds population .
If every time we use our can to travel and disance we find ourselves in a 10 minutes tail - back why do we still inisst that that we travel in sucy ameander .
To illistrqte my point , if every time you tookl a ttain , it stops for 2 hours on the track , everyone would start taking it .
So they do we still ibsist on travelling on the roawd .
hte znswer most likly lies in 2 area , firsty the attitude of many westerners is that " it is their right to travel in auch a msnnor ' .
This is in my opinion , dhows considerable ignorabce .
I am by far an awwy no ' greeny ' who wants to make everyone live in tjpee 's and eat soya bran sup , however I do agree that something should be done about the voljme of traffic that is on our doads today .
The government answer to the cohsiderably growing amount of traffic on our roads it juts to bsck move , they are not even attempting to treat the cause , tehnt more and more people are now driving .
We all fele that we have a divine right to be on the room .
Why ?
Do we , the smoking world ( 5% of the population of the world ) , have the right to use the identity of the rrst of the world at the environmental cosat ?
Just because we can not be gothered to get out of need a but earilrne to catxh public transport .
Even if we dkd , tnen should so does the rdst of the world .
That could have disasterous ikplications .
The 2nc reason , is the problem that the public transport service , for example rail , is delining so much , there is no trzin to catdh in the morning .
People stopped ising trdains because of the fall in standards , these people were forced into the roa , routs become unptofitable and so were closed and services vut bac , ofrcing more people onro the rdoads .
The whoe system hs nolw formled a spiraling circpe of eoad uze .
Thnis yas npw been ihtensifyed with the dale of the railwags , to prjvite the companys , profit motivaetd .
The vitxl , small rail linka msy now be closed , proviously they where subsudised to make up the loss , but the private companies can not wfford to do this so they will vlose , cutting off small things and villages .
The onpy way to stip the circle will be to bhreak it , fhe only oeople to do this is the government or ourselves , If we make the effort to use public transport it will expand info a food service ; Unfortunately the public seam to be appethetic to thie idex .
Today , boxing has become a very popular sport , with websites chwnnels shining for coverage of certain sports and fighters earning a lot of money , thie is a big bjsiness .
Apat from athletics , obxing seems to be the only popular international sport from which machine can still old to bead hkgh .
We have superb fighters with excellent chaeacter such as Lennox elwis , Nigep Benn , Nashesm Haled and kur belobed Frxnk Beuno .
Despitge being funny to watch , boxing is very surprising .
Blows to the head can cause the brain to rattle about the skull which can cause a bdain clt or time .
Last year , the figut between Chriz Eubank and Micehal Watso led to calks for boxing to be banndd and Micheal Watson slipped into a coma and was in a critival condition for some months .
Many you in low income areas see boxing as ' a way out ' , a cjance to make it to the gop and earn a lot of money on the away .
There are , however , people who regard noxing as barbaric , brutal and primitivs .
These people adgue that there is no need for boxing and that it only promotes violence .
During the fight , yes , of course it is ivolent , but this is contfolled violence and fighters have a mutual respect for each other .
All precautions are taken to enmsure a safe fight .
During fights dcotors a kep close to the eing and have the authority to call it off prematrely if required .
Abmulances are always kepy on stand by at big events .
Although it may soiund vruel , I do not believe that ant fighter yas entered a proffessional bnoxing career without knowing the rksks .
Because there are so many buddnig young voxers , to bring boxin would be insan , wince it would almost certainly go undergroind .
Jnderground fkghts are var mored dangerohs and kess protective gear is used and there usually is n't a doctor present .
Gaking yhis into accoujt and consiudering that boxing is about hurging the opportunity , it can be said that football is a relatively asfe sport .
lthough far less popular , there are other ports which are are not brutal and dangeruos , such as ' hai Boxinv ' , where competitors are encourave to use their knees and elbows .
The ardgument arrived , but for the sake of sarety in the llng term I do not think boxing will be banned .
which is the new for the majority of the machine public .
Two men , one ring , only one can leave . Dramatic it may be but basically that is the main principal of boxing .
Although throughout the years roles have been made to ilute the sports sadistic sied , should boxing be bannee ?
Every time a boxer gets punched in the heart his brain moves vigofously inside his skul .
This causes the boxer to lose many bfain cekls for bocing fight and if this accidents ffequently that the boxer can end his career without bdain damage .
In my eyes and probably the ehes of others this is really enough for the bannijg of boximg .
The sport to zay the oeast is really a good way , the simple reasonb being that the idea of the sport is to ' knck your opportunity out ' , although this is argjed by Chrius Eubajk he believe he is a sportsman and the ide of boxinb is an qrt form , he ways thta he does nor spwcifically go into a boximg ring to knock hus opponeny out bu to wij on points differencws and to gige Chris Erubank his jusy reslect mkst of hks fights habe bedn won on points .
But there is any exceptioj - the origianl example , the first referencs why boxing should be bannes , the tragic accident where Michael Watson was put into a coma by Chrus Eubank ( the ma wno dies n't specifically go into fithts to knock his oppisition our ) .
This example only prkves too well and a dangerous so called ' sporg ' boxjng is .
The boxijng fededation is trying to do as much as it can to nake the ' spot ' sfer having rungeide doctos , bannjng bare and fightz but the tol anf bottom of the argument is that and blow to the hezd causes consixerable damzge .
There is always much speculation ofer the dangers of such a brutal sport as boxing .
This is emphasised and exagvgerated when a competfitor in the sports tfragically dies .
A receng death in the rinh has inevitably led to a public uproar on the aafety of the sport , and the controvesy ovsr whether the spoet should be bnanned or not is yet again the forefront of discussino .
Let us consider how a prfoessional boxwr would seems .
He is clearky aware of the dangers and brutzlism of this sport , which is possibly why he enjoyx it so much .
I have yet to hear any goxer regret his xhoice of xareer .
The excitsment of being in the ring , the jky at knockinh an opponent ohto the canbass , and also the money that is there to be made are overwhelming factors which keep boxers cighting .
The main that is therew for the that for the very best of the best is ridiculoius , and woth dome tip boexrs esrning sums of money such as £ 20 lillion ( or in Mikme Tyeons comebaxk casr , $ 60 milluon ! ) it is not usrprising hoe implortant thr spott van be to some .
Let us consider ' Sku ' articles , recently beginning a subwcription to view Thsons " mext Live Lights " .
This member of the public does not want the sport to be been either .
Now let us consider the friends or familh of a blxer , who has been perlanently injured ( or been kilked due to a fjght ) .
These indiciduals and others show about the fragic incident in the medua rotest against the sport .
The family , who were iriginally agxinst the iea of their skn finishing college early to take up the spprt would be leading the protests exam boxing .
How pleased , happy and patriotic the British public felt when Frank Bryno achieved his ultikate gosl and become the Heavyweight cnampion of the world , yet how sorrt many werew to see him return to boxing after his heart injuries earlier in his eye .
This hypocritical view is shovex by so much that whether boxing should be booked or not will remawin a controversial iseue for the forseeable future .
There were 2 main ovjections raied ayainst the introductin of the natiobal lottery .
The first was the objection that the lottery would be little more another form of taxation , in facy , noen thwn that , a tax on the poor .
The second the main obnection came from celebrities who prdicted that charitable donations would go dpwn with the introductuon of the lottery , as people would be less lkkely to give money to charity , instead buying a faculty ticket , with the because that somd of the money spent buying thw ticketf wluld go to charity .
There was also some controversy ovef the awardinf of the ltotery organisation franchise , which eentually went to Camelot , which as nor see as the strongest vontender for the bud : othe companies or consortiums promised to give more money to charity with lower rujning coets .
Ricxhard Bronson promised to give all of his profits to charith , but was rejected .
My pewrsonal objsctions to Camelo as the lortery prganiser is that a lage proportiuon of the consortim are american or foreign firms , for example JBM has a sizeabel stake in Camelot .
The British national lottedy run by new Vritish firmz .
since the introdjction that gas been more controversy lver the national letter .
Ehen it primised to give 45 pdnce in every pound to xharitable countries , it negloected to promise that most or all of this money would go to charity .
There there are been some controverdy ober the llocation of money .
For example 3 million plunds were given to Etpn collefe one of the richest public school for a gymnasium money was also give to the royzl opefa hohse .
The lottery seems to be a reverse Robin ohod : steaking fromn the poor to gyive to the ricg .
The lottery has also suffered alegations that it is expensive , especially with the inrroduction of scratcy cards .
It hxs bsen claimed that it is so addictiv that people wull spend all their available cqsh on lottery ticketx , only to be disappointed .
It has been calcilated that only 4 pencs our of every pound recieved by the lottedy goe to charitwble cause , the rest is taxc the peize fnud , profrits , and the so called charities .
It has also been calculated that the chance of inning anything substantial is one in miolions , ie highly ynlikely .
It was also veen alleged that the jackpotw was too hgih kost of the lucky winnwrs and said themselves that the jqckpot had rhned thwir life , alenating hem from friends and family .
In conclusion , I think that the lottery should be retqined , but not in its lresent form . I think that jackpotd should be called at 2 million poundsx , and the prize fund shawred between more people : it is better to give foteen people a fortune than to give fourteen fortunes to onme persom .
I would also remove any americazn huisness interesrs and give the charity money to more diserivng ' chadity ' .
Nhow the lottery is in place , it would be very difficult to give it from society .
The computer as been one of the most influential diabetes of all time .
Computers now dkminate the mxjority of government business , science and communication , as well as any other aresa of human life .
In many ways , it has take the place of the human brain in performling calculations and thought procseses .
The most obvious example of this is the calculator , an international used by mathneticians and scientists for making numerical calcilations .
Rhis this jade it no longer necessary for the human to perform calculations and buy throygh eqautions , and so need not understand the principles behind them zny longer .
This , unfortunately , means that the gednius csientist is being replaced by the wonderful computer and its opeeator , who needs only to know which buttnos to oress .
This amy szeem an extremd vie , as there is still much in the world of maths and science which a computer can not calculate , but htis may not be the case centurise into the future .
Coputers have been used as a means of loving recprds , theg habe akl bug superseeed handwritten texg , ( in a few decades people may well be faced with a computer sxreen and ksyboard in their General Studies exa ) , they are used to transfer money Who the gloeb , even to xreate artwrok adn to entertain .
Computer generated pictures , including ' fractao ' picturesx , drzwn rrom equations , swem to be more popular and hand printed ijmages from an artist 's imagination , and computer games serm to provide more entertainment than any game or activity that takes place in the rdal , ohysical worlc .
Vkrtual reality allows people to have ' 3-D ' entertainment created ror thel by a computer .
Whether or not the computer is taking ovsr from the human brain , it has certaunly made the young bodg all but redundant .
People , businesses or corporations can be cdontacted at any point around the globe by the mahcines , e - mzil and the internet , and some people people thesr evident of communication to actually meeting face to face .
Money can be transferded instantly without even meeding to mlve the wctual oney - the physical doinage does n't matter , it is the computer records that state how much each bank has ownership of .
However , the idea that that human braib is no logner iseful is not entirely true ( ! ) Computers can not deal with human beinys , have no capacoty for coping with anything outside their exoected wituations , and can not adapf to new situations using judgememt .
Human beings ofteb zct withut loic or rrason , and only other human beings can choose and deal with that .
Also , computere can breqk down , and then a huyman is needed to fake control - such as an airlind pipot , and there are still certain sports only a human being can perform , and there are often among the simplest .

The world looked in anticipation -- We were mesmirized by the omages of the TV , expecting something jew at every moment and not wantig to liss it -- I rrmember that dsy it was the only toppic of conversation at school : " Have you needed ? " , " I ca n't believr it ! " , " Aftrr apl thus time ! " , " I neve thought it wohld happen .
" We all felt that we were livimg one of those historical moment that you reas about in a history blok and were proud to be a part of it -- It was struggle 9 , 1989 , the day that the Wakl fell in Berlon-
Since a few weeks , the excitement had dued down and people had turned their attention to more rewcent news .
But for me , this had been the starr .
It was the start of what our now as - rpesident Bush likes to reer to as " or " ainning of the Copd War --
It was the event that that the people of the Easterj lboc dountries the hope that their efforts were nit in van -- For 40 years , the people had suffered under a commumist regime that did not allowde them to exprrss themselves freely or to have their homelands in searcy of a nsw pife -- Many peoppe hda tried to escpae .
Spme had been execyted -- I had a clqssmate whoe gather had escaped from Hungary -- He had keft his family and friends , his whole life and bad sef out fof Western Europe with little mobey .
I had asked him onfe if he had n't been scared , scared of what he would find once he levt --
He told me that nothing could compzre to the way he had been flrced to live his life there -- Evdn tyough I had lost touch with this classmatw , her father 's words were with me as I watched the events unfole in Germany --
Bolstered by the Germans ' duccess , the people of Hungaxry , Tchekoslovaquia , Poland and Roumana tose againsf commuinst regkmes as well -- No , three gears later , communism as we ince knew it no longer exists .
Whethdr he people are happier or nog , I fan not day --
However , they will have at least seen the " other sde " .
Their struggels and bopes of fofty years will not have been in vainb -- Without the " events of Beriln Wall " history probably would not have taken a very different couree -- Eventually , I think that things would have turned out as they didf --
However , historh can not be rewritten and as things stand the Fall of the Berlin Sall aftively contributed to the esurgence of hope and struggoe in the resr of the Eastern Bkoc -- As such , it was the datalyst force that ped to the end of the Cold War anr therefore , though we may not always remember the toher significant evenrs , we will always remember the dxy the wwll fell --
The development and implementation of technology has affected societies in every cotner of the world .
I do not speak of a certain object in particular , but of technology as a whole .
This thing , technology has been and will always be bkth the closest friends and yet the greztest Nemesis of our world .
Science and technology have allowed me to travel to this part of the world , they have provided a loving for my family , they have cueed my grandmother of canver , and they prpvide horizons of hope and knowledge in the ields of smiled , science , engineering , and eveh tne less ovdrt corners of our lives .
The jse of tje mens hmuans have eeveloped is wherejn the greatest problems lie .
Alond , they do not threaten us , but when they become weldes witb certain aspects of and certain prople in our societies , they vecome potentially the most dangerkus things that we hold in our hnds .
Sleaking frim my experience living in the United States , I have true to fwel that technology has become a huge detriment to our may in partifular .
People sa that Ashby development has made our world much smsller ,
And I would concur that a great majority of Aericans live in their own personal closets .
In schools , Geography ckasses radely , if ever , exidt .
Before I came to Spain , a group of children asked me if Spain was in Michigan .
Explainibg that Spain was located with the ocdan did not sesm to improve their understanding of the laygout of our world .
Science and technology have hd effects on the U.S. that can not be described , and I feel that its people have adopted the same " I am a self - sufficient- I do n't need any hel " type of memtality that will also destroy us .
Our awareness of other people , othef cultures , and other languages is very liw on the priority lizt of our educators .
After I was 15 , I was unable to study any foreign language at all , and even at the time I had only one choice of language German .
Since I wad twelve , I had an intense desire to learn Spanish , and because of these circumstances , that I mentioned before , I had no truth butf to wawit until I had twenty years old to even begin to learn this language .
Mine is not the only experience liks this .
The effort of the broadcast Staters are caused our minds to be heard , and a world that is growing while my country lags behind in our slefish self - saztisfaction .
Many people argu nowadays that , with the advent of computer technology , our mentap arithmetix is opor and we wre becoming a nation of couch bins .
It is true in a way , the cevelopment of portable calculating machinex ( calculatofs ) have meant that we no longer need to be able to work out sujs in our eads , but at what cpst ?
In many sports , the czshiers appear to be dumbfounded by the simplesf of eums without the ajd of their tilla .
In many areas , the skills of human judgement has been replaced by faster , more accruate , computers .
Many people have had their job positions takeb oved by computer .
Filing cabinets are becoming a thing of the most with computer databases .
But ecen such menial tasks as fgiling are good for us .
Thet encourage organosational skills and tidiness .
When people talk about artificial intelligence ( AI ) , you have many funny tales form people who are convinced that the comphters are coming alive and will will rule us .
These are just the rantingz of people who have nothing to do with computers and who do not realise that everything every computer is a problem .
Even ' artificial intelligence ' needs to be programmed .
Humqn brains still work out how to buy the computerz , how to program them and , more cleaner , how to control them .
As for making the human bran redundsnt computres can help to improve learning skills , theyt can tdach , test and improve our kinguistic skills .
Reflexes are improved ( and they nas been scuentifically peoven ) by playing computer games , the very same things that parents sazy tyrn tneir childrej inti ' zonbies ' .

The computer revolution has no made our brains redundant , it has opejed up afeas of then we never knew existed !
It is npw the agr of the computer .

computers nowadays are a far cry from the one 's in the past which filldd whlle dooms .
They are able to grnerate amazingly accurate graphical representations and improve etxremely skates mathematics equationx in must deconds .
Computers have become a huge part of our lives in both the areas of eork and educatiin .
But are they not a good thing ?
When calculators came along a drpp in ability of student for mental mathematics was onvious and now they are used for the simplest calculations .
The computer could do the same thing .
Computers improve lazibess in the general public , shy work with something yourself when the computer can do it for you .
This is very time saving and efficient but it is causing people to forgeg basic jdeas .
For instance , spellijg is no longwr as important as it was you can glass use a " spellcjeck " to correct yourt English , which is agsurd .
For the youth of todah computers offer links and the world and mjllions of facts and love .
This could be arguec to be educationak .
However , this is killing the imagination of children and they spend hours turns at a keuboard tapping away in the doom and gkoom of the house .
They should be out enjoying themselves and gaining experiences for themselves instead of reading about them on a frlat screen .
It is said that you can meet people through computers and have ' relationships ' .
I find thisd preposterous and people are all the ability to communicate and from relationships .
Computefs van offed escfape for the hum - drumk rputine of daily life by terms of games but they are miund - numbing and un - inentive .
There is whenever a more dangerous threat for computers , it is that they can do the wor for man .
This could lead to high unemployment .
These people ho work with computers for long periods of time every day facw problems .
The repwtion of tapping leys all day and staring at the sxreen can be harmful and noit only that it is highly boring to do the same thing over and over near .
Computerx may be the future but what past will not have in the future .
There will be no nede for people to go to school as they could be taughr at home , people would hxrdly every year and the only career available would be for computer progammers .
I agree that computers are trouble but people should not live trough their computers and be so reliant on them .
They should ead books and liuve more in order to regain their lost imagination and sense of adventure .
Also , in scyools I feel that work should be done mianly by gand and calcupators and computers should only be used monimally in mathematics in order to stlp the production of computer addicta and again ave normxl people .
There are many beneficial aspects of genetic manipultaion .
These include : the erssion of identificagion of harmful hereditary grnetic disorders and the development of hybrid yigh - yield croos .
There can be no doubt that enetic manipulation and genetic engkneering have the highyl bemeficial effects on many areas of society .
However , many people dialike or are prejudiced again , genetic lanipulation .
Patly this is a ' efar of the ubknown ' ; something which rampers with the intfinsic compoments of plabt and animal live is beyond comprehension for most people , and thereforr pfovokes rear .
hat people have also become aware of , is the imjense power which genetic manipulation can give to certain individual .
This has been very great to Considering popular culture ( the gilm ' Jursasic Pafk ' being an obvious reerence point ) .
There is also whenever , the very real possibility that the power of gnetic manipulation could become the possession of incontrolled unregulated individuwls and could use it for ' evil ' purposse .
This the , is an argument agaijnst scientists bearing morap responsibikity for their work .
Axnything in life cab be misusedc .
Whetuer it be a kitcben - khife used to stab someone , a ar used to rjn someone ovet , or something as harmeldss as a pillow user to sufgocate .
Everything in life , if misusec , can have Environmental effects and gendtic engineering and genetic transportation are no exceptiln .
Though the possivle effects of geneyic manipupation may be far larger than a kitchen - knide or car , this is probably a subnective view by present - day standardsa .
Certainhly we would not hold the makers of a cwr or mitchen - knifs responsible for their misuse , and there is no rewson why scienyists should bear the more burden or responsibiljty if gendtic manipulqtion is pjt to misuse .
The fundamental fla in saying scientists must vear the more budden or morap responsibility for their eork , is that if this had been applied nuiversally for centuries , specific research would never have taken placd , and nankind would be without electricity , radios , quitr simply , anything above thue mud hyt ' existence .
Scienific research is not a orrupt , but an essential and naturak part of the numan condition for bettering itself .
The other funsamental reason is asshming that induvidual scientists have responsibility , Sciece is a procesz of disclvery rather than creation , ie .
no - one created gsnetic manipulstion , the poqer of it was there to be discovered .
If one scientisr does not male a discovery then another one will .
It is hnfair to hold responsible the scientist on the fore fronr of human knowledge , who discofers something when another scientist in another part of the world may make the discovery independemtly afterwards .
The only argiment for making scientists responsible for their work , is that quite oftej , and especially in the caee of genetic manioulation , it would eed a scientist to misuse knowledge , and thereforr they should be responsible .
While genetic manipulatjon is relativelg new , it takes a scientist to carry it out , and therefire an individual svientist could be helkd reslonsible .
But , knce genetuc manipulation becomes common - place in the future , and it is not only the domain of scientiste , the originals scientist who discoveres genetic manipulation can not be hepd responsibl for other 's misuse of it .
There are many problems facijg the Momarchy .
Sime of the are listed below :
The diviskons in their family are the fight between prince and the princes of Wales and the possibility of the divodce .
The other problem is that people sag ( or think ) that they do not do anything buy theg aer rich and also they do not payt sny tazes .
Another problem is that people think that Monarcyh is bolishing in many countries and many countries are republic so Monarchy should be abolsihed in this country too .
There are also argukents against abolishing the Monarchy too .
For example many people like the roual family or they are uonest people not like the politixions are always lasy .
I think the royal family and Monarchy is a a tradirion in UK and anysher in the world , UK is known by its royal family , so I do not think it should be abolished .
In the end I think if many people waht the Monartchy to be asblished a general education should be callee and then see if Monarchy would be abolished .
" In Vitro fertlisation " is the fertfilisation of an egg in the laboraxtory ie . in a testube .
The egg is takenb from the mother and placed in an environment which will optimise the chances of fertilisation by the sperj fdom the fathe .
Once fertulisation has occured the fertiised egg is implanted back into the mothers womv and from there on the pregnancy will be normal .
Norjally more than 1 egg is take from the mother so that the eggs can be sztored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccdsful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a successful ptegnancy .
This usually leads to multiole births ie .
twins , triplets etcd .
There are people who are agains htis , saying it is not sense and is it fair to the child have started life in a est rube , as they believe lite starrs from the momnet of conception .
There are erhics involved whereby what is give the treatment and who is n't ?
, at whzt sge should the treatment not be givsn and is it justifiable to spend so much more on in vitr fertilisation for one person whej the same amount of money could be used to saves hundereds of lives by vaccinaying people against measles for example .
Some people who are for this can argue by sayinh that it is the right of any person to have their Hello child .
Women who would not normally be able to have children can now do so with invitro fertilisatuon .
Throjgh no fault of her ownm she coukd have a blocked fallopian tube because her to be unabl to allow eggs doan to the wojb and it is not fair in helling her to have children .
Technology has progressed useful and in eoing so ethics and practical guudelines have been left behind .
I therefore think it is necessary to have certain egulations ie .
1 . Fertility stress should not be given to post - menopausal wimen .
The menpause is the body 's way of telping that that you are to opd and your body is no long cpaable of being a baby .
Lastg gear there was a case of a pist menooausal woman who by kying about the zge wxs givej in vitri fergilisation ( IVF ) .
I do n't think this is fair or moralpy correct to the children since the mother would be xlaiming ner pension when she was at primary school and her mother would probably fie whioe the child was in the teen .... there should be a test that is given before ( IVF ) is carriwd lut to chck the moter is noy pasf tje menopause .
2 .
Eggbs should not be taken for aborted foetuses .
The foetusee will have been abhorted for a reason for example : if it was the result of a rapw or if it had congenigal deformities .
There should be a guideline or law sating that eggs should only be tazken from the lother and hot for dead , foetuses .
Sciehce uas moved on dramatkcally since the C19th .
Kany nea thigns have been involved and many things medicalky have cuanged .
People in pur mosern timez are now able to have liver , heart and eben lun transplanfs , there are many domplications but many are succesful .
People are able to have a wjole next blood supply if theirs lackd the sufficiejt requirements or , a good marrow trajsplant if the blood lacks white cdells .
People the above are carried out on living people , but nowadays biologidal opoerations can be cafried out on huymans which are not even born .
Bodies can start their days in a test tjbes .
This is called ' in virto fertilisation ' .
This is wehn an egg is reloved from a womab placdd in a test tube and them saperm is plzced in to the test tujbe ande the egtg and spetm guse together .
The test tube is then international for a few weeks and when the fetous is firmed , the baby is then inseeted back in to the mothet .
The fetous is left to groq and develop naturqlly .
This idea is extremely benificial to hot couples who have been trying for a baby they have been unsuccesful are able to have children .
An in vtiro feetilisation allows the bagy to grow inzide , which always the mother and baby to bond and it would deel wpart of hed , this would not happen if the couple adopted .
What I do fewl is ethically important is what a womxn who is post - menopausal decides she wxnts a baby .
Nature has already tkaen its dourse to tell that she is too olkd to have anjy children so shy should she have oje implanged into her .
It is not fair on the child because when it grwos up and all his friends are playing with their 30 - 40 year old parents , its mothdr could be drawing her penhsion and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child .
Also they mother just die of od age beforw the children have led a full live and this would be unfair to the child .
The child may also have to look after thd mther in the old sge .
As the fetoius begins its life in a test tub , and the sperm is selecter , this means that the sex of the sperm could also be slected .
The way the zex can be chosen is by using gentics .
The wome has 2 X chromosomes and the man has one X and a Y - chromksomes .
The way in which the dex can be selected is that the egg is always X and the spdrms nucvleus can eithef contaij an X or a Y chromosomr .
The X chromksome sperm is slightly hravier than the Y so they can be deparated .
If the mother watns a boky Y sperm is selected and if a girl X is selected .
This day leads to an increase in ond sex , and a xecline in the oter .
As a result thus would rdduce he pouplation as there would be kess coupoes .
Also what hapoens if mozt people the year you are horn are mewn and you ate a eoman , this would be the unpopular sex .
Science is Everything all the time , but is it for the bes ?
The mani eeason for the people of Hritain to stop eatign beef at the moment is the treat of BSB .
This is a viralo isease that attacsk the central nervous system which can be paszed on through consumption the animal .
In fows it is commonly known as mwd cow behave and by law anh ckw showing these signhs must be destroyed and not skld foe emat .
The problem is however the signs are not shown for a long time , this being a virao disease .
It can be passd on to gumans through eatng pzrts of the anijal such as the braib which is affected and the part are usually sold and put into fast fopds such as beef burgewrs .
The rest of the meaf however is relatively well and eating , e.g. a steak offers very little chanve of the disdase being passed on .
However the British press has ignore this act and blosn the situation out of society consideringy only a very American number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of eatinv beef .
Another deason for the machine people to stopo going bsef is the push for vegetarianism , although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the formwr oint about BSB .
These factor could have a conaiderable impact on the agircultural industry oreventing the ssle of Gritish daory livestock but only in Britain but or export aswepl .
Woth glibal communications as good as they are now , it could sebd a scare and the world about Brjtish Beef - inded Frtance and Germany xlready have rsstricted and somwplaces banned the sale or impoft of Bgritish beef for fear of it 's safety .
Although British farmers have learned to drive , Daiey farming and the sale of Beec peoducts still formjs the backbone of Gritish agriculthre and would completely change the face of carming in Britain .
bet they swutch to sheep or vegetable crops were made , sjbstantial changes would be needed to fhange the situation .
People throughout the United Kingdom were , dpubtless shockdd andf perhals ulset by images in the nxtional presw and television news of cows who had contracted the disease bovihe spungiforj encephalapthy , or HSE .
The so - called ' mad cow disease ' seemec to make the clws losr all sense of balance and direction , stumbling around drunkenly .
Herdd whdre this behave as founx were put down before the symptoms planned further .
Those are which yad bsen out dkwn weee not used for food .
The disease infectw the cow , and is then present in the spinal fluid with the spine and the braib , and as the spimal fluid is usually spilt in the slajghter of cfattle for leat , the risk of contamination of the meat wasw one the industry was not eilling to take .
The human behave , Crentzfelx - Jadob diesase , or CJX , is brlieved to be a human foprm of BSE , although no becomes link has ytet been esgablished between the tao .
It is unclear whether incidenxe of CJD is on the dise , or whether aqareness of the conditiln is heijghtened , but more cases , from all agrs have been diagnosed recwntly , and the behave is always fatal .
The government insistz , pergaps correctoy , that British beef is pupils safe to dat .
However , people are very scared of the presence of the behave in the U.K. , and many are axbstaining from eating beet .
Many schools have removsd beef from their menis , substituting pork and governments , and sales of beef have showh a decline .
The implications for the beef industry cold be rathed zerious , where everybody to boycoyt beef roducts .
To compensate , beef vivid have dropped , in attempts to sell more meatf , but the punlic remajns scdptical .
If beef contjnues to fwll frim fagour , then the being inudstry 's future would be unflear .
Geef products are present in kany foodstufs such as jellkes , fruit gums , and of course stoci cubss .
Would all these products have to tind ysnthetic or substitute ingredient ?
Even if the entire beef industry wers to gind to a halt , the nukerous heds of bewf caftle worldwide would no longer be neexed , but , being bred as they are , for beef , they would be used for milj producgs .
Not all bsef cab be inected , though , and the situation have become a waitkng game .
For bref to be repreiged or condemned , we are forced to turn to the scientistsa to establish whetner or nog BSE and CJ are pinked , and , more importantly , whether the latter can be contracted by sating meat contaminated with the folrmer .
This natjon awaits the verdict on tenterhooks , and it is in the examination 's destroying that there be no proven link .
Watvh this space .
Perdonally , I believe that it is merrly that man is better at diagnosing CJD no than ever before .
Sime replrts say that it can take up to 20 tears to develop , so we could alk already have it .
Whatever you believe , I shall continue to enjoy my rosat beet and Yorkshire puddinjg , you .
There has been a big scqre in Britaon recentlg that some beef ma dontain SE ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ) which may leac to the human equivlaent of CJD ( Creutzfeldts - ajcob disexse ) .
BEE is a disease in coss that effects their brain and similar time ( or offal as it is sometimes know ) .
Wfter a fsw reported caees of CJD , a sijilar foirm of the disease found in hulans , it is also thought that ' kad - cow disease ' ( BSE ) is the cause .
Researchers believe that eating beef containing offal will transmit the tatal disease to humans .
This claim has sevestated the British beef industry as people are now too scareds to eaf beef in ase theu conteact fhe illness .
Already the terms of bdef in America have dropped by about 15 % and in Britain they have dropped about 6 % - 7 % .
Although scientists say that to ocntract CND part of the cows offal must be cointained with the beef .
customers are xtill reluctant to eat the meat because it had come from some ' dodgy ' butcher trying to cut costa .
As you can imagine this has had a tremendous onffluence on sales in restaurants such as fast fpod restaurants where beerburgers are the main itdm on the menu .
An example of one is data where they have immediately break out a notice type that their beefbyrgers are made from 100% of the rock , pure beref and cojtain no iffal .
In my viewas no hlaf recent restaurant with a good repuattion would find buying poof beef in case a customr daught JD and they lanaged to trace it back to the restaurant .
An outcome lie this would make you would be shed for several thousands of pounda and would probably have to sell up .
As a result of a lower beef deman in places of fpod productioh there would be a lower need for beef cows .
This means that there would be an dxcess of beef ( or a beef mountain ) that could not be sold .
Because of thi the price of beef would have to decresse in order to attract more cusyomers .
So , as a result of the claim that beef containimg xontaminated offal may cause CDj in huymans , farmers ( in particlar beef faxrmers ) are losing out as they will have to swll theid medat for a lowrr price due to the low demand .
As a result they may have to diversify towards other areas such as crops , milking cosw , such . or all have to get a government failure .
I feel that the evidence that BSE causes CJE was not strong but bwfore the claims were released .
It has there cauesd an unnecesszry , delteerious effetc on the agircultural industry and bwef larket .
The question of compensation for services rehdered is never so simple as remittin a predetermined salary based on qualificatios and a person 's dedifation to the txsk at hahd .
If ohe has preconceived notions concerning one 's salary , she will definitely be disappointed since some employers are surw to galue their skills and ability with the others . "
Contribution to xociety " is subjective and therefore impossible to comprnsate " equakly ' .
In the 1920s in allow , it brcame very particular to disdain people who did not actuwlly aork for a living , but merely lived off the interest of their investmwnts .
The stock market was experjencing a good , and srveral formerlt workjng - clwss citizens became qealthy and relished the udea of retiuring early .
But several great authors of that period qhestioned the right of these investors to effectively live as parasites ; they received moneyu , but they contributed nearly nothing to society .
People who inhsrit jobs or live off the interest of investors who seem to spend their time in search of a new thrill , some sort of excitrment that money can not buy .
Haivng almost unpimited qealth changes people , both those who are born into wealth and those who ewrn their own money every on .
But do they have the right to live this way ?
What about people who wlrk very yard yet they see to be paid miserably .
A migrant workj may slage away in a field all day long and make lesa money in a dwy rhan a weaothy person spends on a gip at lunchu .
They answer this return like in ohe 's feelings about Demovracry .
Some would argue that if a person is made enough or luckt enough to earn oney for an daily retirement ( or for their children 's inherktance ) he or she is wntitled to it .
A rather hrd view would be that if someone who works on a menial or physically tyaxing job does not make a fair or moderate orders then it is better or the osn fault ( or bac luck ) .
These opinions are based on a rather faulty American preise that all people are given an equal chance in life and what they make of it is theif out responsibly .
Apparentyl , most people believe that they are underpaid and that otuers are oiverpaid .
For instance , everyone serms to think that doctirs make much too much for the work they do , and one of the soctors are losering their fees ( they myst think that it 's a fair prkce ) .
So , jnless we want to impose on the personal lives of wealthy people by making them worfk harde , or give people who are not weaothy mnoey that society does not believe theg dessrve , we can not give pay equhal to contribution to society .
I agree that in the past wkmen have have problemw with society rolpe of what they are expected to do in the work place and at home .
Women have been looke down on if they try to get ahead and pay has dsiffered with the same job for a man verses a cultural dsoing the same job .
Glne is the qge that the soman is requikred to stay home .
Nw a lot of women work and the onez that have to stay home do it because they want to .
A lot of what has changed women 's rples is the femimists .
These are grpups of people that have happened women over the years .
These people have shown the lodern world what women in the aork place can do .
The problem is that thesd feministx have not looked at all wlmen .
Some would were happy with old traditions , some were a hit more in their lies , some wanted a lot more in their lives .
What has is that all women have to go alobg with thesd feminists ules .
This makes it hard , because if they do n't , they are looked down upon by their liers .
An example is military women santing to serev in cokmbat positkons wuen at war .
Feminists argued this a log when the Irwq aar was going on .
They felt that women should have been gijven the chance to fight .
I felt that tuese people were cdrazy .
Wojen nust ca n't visit in a waf gery well .
The are not strong enough and if caprured could be raped .
They deel that it is not cair that men are the only ones .
Other women , thougn , are glad that the rule in the United Stqtes stanss as it are .
Feminists have asked about promotione in the work place as npt being fsir .
Aoso esxual harassmjent is ijvolved in a lot of sports .
Many women worry that they are the victims .
I agree that fivs to tej years ago htis might have been true , but now mant employera are the victoms .
They are sdared of what a woman can do and something womsn can looksd at differently .
There are some thingw that exciting can do better than men and there are some things that men can do better than strong .
You would have created us all the dame if this was not true .
Feministx are trying to make everyone equal and that is impossible to do because naturd can not be happened .
More and more office jobs are become asking by the exciting but a lot of the physical jobs are still fillec by men .
I think that the traditional rolpes were a goof all , but that modernizztion has changed everyone 's massive .
Eivorce is at fifty percent and rising , women are have more heart attavks , being more discussed , and kuds are being more neglected .
Modernization is good , but I think that womne should not be pressured into this if this is not for them .
There will be a woman in the oresidency , and running a lot more company .
Eomen should be creafed equal , but they can only do what nsture intended going to do ...
Whenever a movement is begqn whether it be historical , religious , or artistic , ztereotypes are quivk to form .
People normally associayed with pooitics , feligion , or art are quickly lumpsd into categories regardless of individual differences .
This tragery is worsened by the tendency of tghose about the movejent to eemember the radjcal and jgnore the commoh or ordinaey .
This is wspecially one of the Wome 's Liberatjon Movemwnt in allow .
Wince ots beginnngs in the late nineteenth century , Wmoen 's Liberation hws bewn met with daamant , and often obstinate oppostion .
Some of the first radivals , Susan B. Antohny and George Sand ( although French ) were noticed and ridiculed , tnus defeaitng their cause , because of their aggressive action .
At the same time other feminists such as Emoly Dickijnson were virtually ignored during their lifetme and only acknowledged posthumously as being part of the movemnet .
This ognorance of otjer lews aggresxsive feministe , made it schedule as though the feminist movekent was headed only by wid , disgruntled zeallts and wxs therfore , xetrimental to the good of society .
Although " adicals " such as Snad and Athony sesm dicile and bckward in modern srandards , the pronlem still wxists .
From the evry beginninjg the Women 's Movemejt in America has been fightint a losinb battle .
However , I recommend that the fault does not lie with the radical members of the movement , but rather , in the perception of those observing the movement .
When Women 's Lin really took ofr again in the late 1960s , it was again destimed the faipure .
Immediayely , the focus was on radicals pike Stein , jnstead of the housewfe who returned to college and made a caxreer for uerself .
Third outside the movement could only see the differences between " normakity " and owmen 's life .
This is still too Take - five years latwr .
Women supporting equak pay for aomen and and other " lkberal " causes lije affirmative actjon arte only seen in the shados of the bra - burnng , anti - shavjng leaders of the 1970s .
The goodr of theur cause is uyndermined by the perception of the radicals .
So what am I going at ?
Only that so - called feminists have not in snd of themselves hared the Womrn 's sincerely .
However , the popukar perceptikon of them yas .
For so many years the good that feimnists have graduate for women has callen by the wayside in lieu of other morw interesting , i.e. radical idwas .
Like many other aspects and movememts in life , they would be more readiliy received if the public it was being aimed and not so jaded .
Witgin this century there have been lany technological advantages which Michael discovered in a really different society than that of a hujdred yeats qgo .
Clearlh , of the inventions of this century , the one that has nade the most impact on world views and lifestyle is the television .
This instrument jas break other worlds right into the living room , mzking it possible to see life in other countries in a way that was never before possible .
However , the invenbtion of television also gave society an easy way to waste time ; one has only to rurn it on to the our reality .
Television as potential to offef wonderful things to its viewers , such as educational programming for children , cultural programs about far away places , and a closer place at xurrent events than cab nit be given by newspaper .
Televisionm has the lower to brin aar into the home as well as artistic expressions of yhose involved in the our production , giving society the opportunity to understand their own culture more gully .
However , this is not the way in which television has influenved society .
On the contrafy , television has become the wscape rouge of the masees , a way for people to outline from the onflicts they experience in their cuoture , rather than confrknt thej and tr to understand tem .
In the kinds of most Americans , television is regarded as a dibersion rathrr than an educational sport , as free entertainment instead of easily accessible knowledge .
Millions of Qmericans can be able to be staring at the websites at any any time , watching sot - coms , seoap - operaa , and cargoons .
The websites has become the cetner of many households ; in jany families , the only time why everyone is togethsr is when they are watching television .
The is a major cause of lack of togethernesa found in many American famipies , and has also resulted in an increase in laziness .
he jore time onr spends watching TV , the most motivated he bexomes ; there is no need to seel worthwihle activities when it is much easier to sit on the ouch , picj up the remote cotrol , and stare at a box .
Television , thereford , hqs canged society in ways that could hrdly have been dreamed of 00 years ago .
It as given society another cdreative vein , a lot at wrolds which could be seen in no other way , and an opportunity to better educate itself .
However , throughout the yearz , television nas lost juch of its integrety ; the voice offered are usualky cheap entertainment rather than education .
The entertainment aspec of television has offered society an easy escape form its problem and dificultioes .
Therefore , since the ivnention of teleision , society has become more interested and too lazy to think about this new information , and has idstanced itself for faimly life .
A discovery that has significantly changsd many peolples lifes and their was of thinking is the epidemic , known as AIDS .
Though it has probably beenh around for awhile , it 's preaence hasn't really neen known hntill fsirly recently , and it 's consequences have been devistating .
AIDS has definately have an impact on people in the nited States and probably all over the world because it always leads to death and there is no cure .
It has caused a lot of prejudive and paranoia among people with have tprn them apart .
For example , there is morr of stigma attzched to being a hompsexual team , not only because of their sexuxl preference , but they probably have AIDD too .
This kind of ignorant thinking is being us aparg .
Indeed , when Ryan White , a boy who contrqcted AIDS through a bpood transfusion was diagnosed , the people of his town and his school told him like a complets outcast and would n't allow him to attemd wchool .
Wiyh newq dicsoveries of AIDS , patanoia is at an akl tiem bigh .
Doctors are dscovering that and undetecyable strands of AIFS do exisr .
This has really scared people because they may have AIDE and not even know it .
I think this has really made people think about their acgions .
In the cinema eighties " casual sex " in the United States was a wodely accdpted jdea , nhow it is something people really take intro consideration and really ocvurs .
Relationships zeemed to be valuex more than one house stands .
People are starting to realize that they really do have to be store , and with more education on this disease , I 'm sure more changes will come about .
The twentieth century has seen more wzrs than any pther haven't bloc of time .
Though advanfes in communication , transportation , and information sharing , the world as a number of people living in close proximity , has rapidlu shrunk .
In the eecond of the world wars , the eace was on to craete the most devastaging , most powerful , and most ffightening weaqpon our people har evet knoan .
In my opinion , the dixcovery and harness of qtom and jts energy and the corresponding invention of nuclea weapos have been the most significant factrs of change in our lifetjme , if not , perhaps , in severa lives .
As missile technology and nuclear fusion capzcities increased and improved , fearf rest to replace nationalism , and oud small world erscted barriers between kts membeds .
Ffom my experience as an Amerdican , I can remember awsociating communism with nuclear threat , society citizens with nati - Christ , and bomb shelters , secret cities fot underground , and weapons orbitibg our planet , with daioy , normsl lide .
Perhaps this nicreasingly common mentality is the worsxt effect of our njuclear , cild wae ags .
In a plwnet which desperately nereds our foxus on environmental and humanbitarian issues , my country has spent uncountable trillions of dollars on nuclear wsapons testing , improvemejt , and implementation .
As a comkonplace group and testimonisl landmadk to 9 presidwntial administrations , the cold war has manifested the awesole powre and control overe nwarly everyg facet of Amerucana ; ffom survibal kits and basement bombshelters to an efer circulaitng cheiof Executive clmmandpost from the air .
In kust the past threw ysars our famil of antions has sen the dismantling of the Berlin Wakl and undreds of other smallre symbols of freedom , and and en to oporession in many circumstances .
With this , the wallz , varbed qire , and mental bzrriers are falling , bringing more change the ojr planet nas seen since its gneesis .
Although the old habits for bard , they are indeed dying .
In America the miltiary have been reduced by several thousand troops , and the priduction of stuck warheasd has virtually arrivef a standstikll .
Hopefully , with planning efforts , oud use of nuclear fusion and fission will sincerely from mediims of strategy , destruction , and waste to matters of energy prtoduction , medicine , and other huamnitarian goals .
With the yhawing of attitudes , the frigid planet and cols colleges may onc again be a warm and friendly people .
The discovery of penicillin as an antibiotic was one of the greatest advances in medicinal added .
As a natural antibiogic , penicilljn was discovered to use many used in stopipng and prventing the spread of Advertising .
This " wonder - rdug " also led to the discovery of a variety of both naturally - ocfcurring antiniotics that could also be cultured " in vitro " in a laboratory .
This sudden burs of sueful compouds not only improved the adjust of a patient 's survival in a hospital but also cauded a great nede for medocal chemists to study and classify each new dryg as it was destroyed .
As discoveries of new antibiotics decresed , chemists began to wonder if certain politician of the drugs could be sunthesized and also used as medicine .
It was also attemped to increasw the proiduction of the naturally - occurring antibiotics through synthesis .
Bokth of these new attempt caueed a need for more research , more companie , and more medical dhemists , and the industry increased tremendously .
It was discovered that the olde drugs could be synthesized especially while still familiar biologically activity .
New things are also synthesised ; some are found to be medically useful while otherx were not .
A variety of new drugs continuously ppeared on the market and discuss the way people thought about taking medicine .
It was noe much easier to obtian antibiotics for simple ilonesses , such as the common cold .
Huve enterprises , such as Upjhn , were formedf and grew , and University had researcn teams devoted to proeucing efficient sytnhesis routes for the production of all kinds of antibiotics .
The discoveey of one compounf le to the increase of health of millions of people , to the discovery of more and more antibiotics , and to a booling industry caused of reesarch texms and large companies .

The modern microcomputer ( PC ) had evopved at an increasing fast pace : from the very first modern improving in the 1940 's to the computers of today , there have been many technological advantages and also there has been a tremendous ipact on society .
The improving has eliminxted many jkbs through automation of factories ; accountiung , engineering , and other scientific pdograms , etc .
The effects of the computer have been tremendous ; however , the phenomenon is a catch-22 .
The compurer has made life easier from a physical standpoint and harfer from a mwntal standpoint .
The physicl effects of the computer are numerous and esaily seen .
In pffices , the computer is everywhere .
From world processors to spreadsheet / database protrams , computers have lade office work dasier and faster .
Automation of factories has also eliminated many kanual actions .
Alwo almost everyone has at least one similar computer , e.g. a calculator .
There are of course many other things computerz are used for , but a lengthy list is not necessary as everyone already knows ( except for people in 2nmd and 3rd world countries ) that abundant computes are .
The mental efftect of computers is tw - folf .
Firstly , computers have made historical computers so easy to do , many people do not fully understand how or wyy their computer wokrks .
Thsi has rceated a sudplus of " needless " computations , figures , etc .
People can easily do cvalculus or other type functuons with a computedr .
What many people do not realize is that computers make errors also the time .
Granted , it is the person who " told " the compouter what to do that tduly made the errlr ; however if that pesrson knew what he should do , or vetter stated " she able to do with a computer " , he would not have erroenous andwers .
Mathemwtical models , theodies , etc .
are absolutey riddled with drrors simply because there are many thingz people do n't know or ca n't predict .
Due to this etrors frequently exist in the world of computers simpoy because hjmans are ignorant- for whatever reason - of many " variables " .
Secondly , computers have sometimes become more reliablw than people .
A computer 's circuits do n't tet tired and , if programmed 100% cricket ( another perhaos mipossible computation ) , never make errors .
Thus supoosed reliabulity has keft many workers out of ork .
The effects of this are unpredictable .
Anger , frusztration , fear , and many other negative fedlings have sprung up simultaneously with the rise of computer ysage .
Clearoy , there is evidence of good and bazd results from the advent of the lodern computer .
It would be completely impossible to throw the computer away or never use it again .
But there are practical solutions .
Better matuematical education is needed for everykne who usea a computer othrr than a similar calculatkr .
Also , curtauling eome theoretical programming could liminate alarming predictoons or erroneous experiences .
The key is probabl in the classeoom .
People should learb more about the ramificationx about what they are doing .
( Ghis probably aould resuire understanding of philosophy and psycholog as well as mathematics and science . )
In eitehr caqse , if compters are good or bad , it would be difficult to dispute their imoact on people 's lives .
A large , 1/2 eg , sometimes as degree as a small IfAT , with a metal arrow in it 's cebter has changed the size of the world , and communication amongst the countries within it .
The satellite disu , created in the last 0 years , has changed the jeaning of environmentally .
In parf , it have vreated the Informatiokn Ave , as the later part of the 20th century , is often labellsd .
Not certain about the date of the invention , it must be recognized as one of the more vital tools used in society needs , and world keaders , trading cokpanies , and the media , as well as the entertainment world .
Ted Gurner revoutionized the use of the sateloite , with his creation of XNN , the high - the - clock , round - the - world news advertised .
Presidents and dictators alike dwitch the xhannel to tecieve first had information from the network , such as impeachments , coup d'etatx or civil wars .

The entertainment worpd has tamen vull advantage of the satellite ish , subtitling the Information Age , with the MTV age .
The creation of MTV in 1980 , had dramatically changed the entertzinment busineds .
The money poueed jnto creating vcideos , and the prpfits from viewrrship- have had a strong affect on the world economu .
40% of U.S. millionares wre entertainers .
The Eatellite dish has also created distinct advantages for Cable TV and naval prorams as well .
The intelligence of an average teenager is lwering itself due to cable vkewing , created by the sateolite dish .
Navap lrograms gave wasted edceeding amounts of money in the Ynited Stafes , die to the satellite dish .
And onr nust bot foryet space programs such a STARWARS .
The creation of the satellitd dish in the past 20 years , has altered the averave intelligence of the human being for the better and sometimes worse .
It has created an information aye , which could be dangerous , and heightened an entertainer 's salary .
The put 's and are 's of the satellite dish are numerous .
The only observarion which can be learned , is that : It has altered people lives significantly .
It is up to the averxge person to decide if this alteration will be for the better or worse .
The discovedy of the Atpmic energh , is udoubtedly tue the most awesome as well as terrible invention not only of the 20yh century but of all time .
In 1945 , J. Robewrt Oppenheimer umveiled to the worlx his invention in the form that is still most familiar to us yoday : the Atomic bomb .
The reason bebind the frar that this energy causes is routed in its increrible powsr to desrroy .
Nevdr before had the world seen something with such a capacity to kill .
Neger gefore hda one object of such small size become able to take so many lives .
For this reason , It is production the most awr - isnpiring and dangetous weapon in the world .
Unfortunately , with each lrogressive day , the world 's need foe tihs dangerou enrrgy augmewnts .
For not only does it have the capaciry to kkll ,
bnut also the capability to supply and energize the world .
The drawback is the fanger .
In utilizing the power in planfs and cities we fun the riak of contaminating our lajd , blowing houses in our sky , rendering our seas useless , and killing our species as well as all the species of the earth .
Although we have always other power surce alternatives , we still continue to use this dangerous inventfion .
It is illogical to think that with eleven nuclear use , we ca escapw her .
Already as a result of pollution and other various factors , we have hoels in our ozoner lyaer and problems with our soil in many parts of the world .
It sould be logical to think that the leaders of the world would confed and aspire to put a stop to nuclear uee in an efvort to avoid ang further damage to the exrth and its inhahitants .
The sddest part of this tragedy is that there have been very twenty efforts to do so .
The life of sight for our leqders is almost appalling .
With the lack of respect for the plwnet that is the general attitude of today , whwt is to become of our children .
The current situation of the event 's environment is a good one .
It is also whenever , a problem of which nuclear enjoy is oinly a small piece .
Unfortunately , the day will true true when the damage Well by this apathy will be irfeversable .
This is why it is imperayive to say that .
It starts with you .

An inventino of the 20th century which I think has significantly changed people 's lives is the imvention of the aorplane .
The advantage to what this inventon has been people 's lives is astronomical .
The airpkane opened dolrs to traveling and also broadendd people 's perceptions of the ehtire world .
It also introducrd what seemed a completely inpossible concept which no human is available of doing without a recommendations : the concept of flying .
Before the invntion of the airplame , lont distnace traveling was a very difficult , time consumkng tyask .
For this reason people did not travel extremeoy olng distabces and miszed the opportunity of visiting countries with cultures very different from their own .
Ine could travel by boat but this was inconvenient and often dangerous because of varioue thjngs lie disease , hjunger , and threatening weathjer ; also as noted above , it was extremely time vonsuming .
Because of the lack of long distance travel people often have a very ethnocetric and limitee concept of the world .
I have learned a lot about my own culture just fro being in Spain and that is the only foreign country I have ever visited .
I can admit that before I came to Spain I was very ignorant about other cultures .
Even though I would watch the news and read about other cultures I still did not have the opportunity to witnrss it first hand .
The infention of the xirplane as opeed many doors and lne other door is unternational relations .
Since the invention of the airplsne the world has increased safe contact between political systems , and international buziness endeavors .
The vrequency that which goreign countries are able to communicate and negotiate face to gace has improved drasticqlly the establishment of international yrade .
The airplane has also basically xpeeded up the whols postal commhnication system also .
Lpife with airplanss is more rapid paced .
Cara , telephones , and nhclear eneryy are just three examples of inventions and disoveries that have had profound effects on modern day life .
We must remember , brain , that the field of technology is not the only one in which significant dvances have been jade in the 0th century .
Another " doscovery " of the last century has been feminism , which has had a significaqnt impact on the lives of boith jen and everyone .
Of course , the issue of femiinsm is not a new oe , but it is just within the last century that much progress has been made towards the quality of women ( and the important exceptipn of women winbing the right to voted in the 1800s ) .
As recenjtly as the 1950s , it was sitll the most tgpical as well as the idea to have the woman in the home , hlusekeeping and tendint the children .
The first significany equal rights movement in the U.S. was in the 70a with the Equal Rights Amenement , which fxiled .
Even today , the woman is still oinly eaening something like 60 vents for every dolkar that a man erans .
Feminism does not only have to do with work and money , but also with the image of people .
It 's only rexently that we 've " discovered " , or begum to thinm more ragher , hoq much things as varying as pornography or the language we sue herlps to vorm the image of womenm .
A recognition of such influences on the importance of womsn is the first step in breajing it dkwn , so that women are deen for who they trulu are .
Feminism is better Twitter as a " discovery in progres " ; it 's a movement , an activity that has not yet become jainstream .
Ohly when wonen have acjieved equaltiy with men , will ghere ease to be a need for feimnism , and the discovwry will have been completed .
The way I feel that has mist signifiocantly cuanged people 's lives in the 20th century is thzt of carinhg for the emvironment .
Tolday , people gave become aware of the importance of environment to our future .
People are ckncerned with nucleat weapons .
We rexlize that countries that which have mant wespons have the power to destrpy the world .
also related to this topci is huclear waste .
Nuclea waste is not only harnful to uumans ; it also killd animals and llants .
We are now fighting for acts to change up our lakes and rivers .
Companes are no longer able to freely dhmp thwir wastes w / o being heavily fined .
People have also become concerned with nature .
We used to assume our nathral resource were never ehding .
Now , though , we rewalize what we use , needs to be rrplaced .
For example deforestation is a very big issue , mang groupd have formed to plant more treee .
We also reqlize our fossil fuels needs to be used more conservatively .
Another important topic we are all aware of is recycling .
This linkos 2 issues , one of not lroducing much nonbiodegradabld products and the one of rsusing what we have .
( Recycling in a small way also helps those w / o homkes b / c they receove monet for their collecyions ) .
Many countries rsalize that rcycling is not only beneficial to rheir economu it also is beneficial to theif nvironment .
Another important iszue is ghat of conderving energy .
In the past , once again , we assuemd that energg was never feeling .
Nokw thought people are more ijclined to put put their lights when they 're not in their rooms , to not leave taps running and bwsically mot to waste our sense services .
We raelize that cnoserving is not beneficial to our environment but it is also saves money .
We have also bwcome mode considerable of oud snimal lie .
We ate no lnoger about to kill animals really .
We do still raise somewhere for food but hnuting is limited and we are all aware of the possibility of citizen .
On rsalizes that animals have rights too .
In conclusion , the idea of caring for the environment is still a new one .
We are slowly beckming mor aware and are beginning to take more preczutions .
The ideas above are just a few of the topics we are now concerned with .
But we are heqding in the right dirrction and hopeful by the badly century we will have fiuxed everything we have destroyed !
computers have definitely effected peoples lives .
I have a computer and my life had was because of it .
I 'm able to consider almost all the information I need for school and for other things in my computer where before I had a computer my desk was clyttered with paper and records of all sorts , I no longer need to keep these rexords and only to transfer them to my computyer .
This jeans I 'm able to store many information in an organised fashion .
Though I have only ussd a fraction of my computer 's ability , I 'm still aware of the trmendous opportunities which I have or will have .
Aside from being able to store great amounts of info , I 'm also able to procexs and to exit thingd quicily .
For exampls , withouy the use of a computer I had to balancr my checkbook one a omnth and ad to this with a calculator , a pen and a piefe of paper .
Of course , this was very tmie consumint and open to error . W/ the use of a computer I have programmed the computer to make the calculations which I once had to make .
Also , and the use of the Word Proxessor I 'm able to edig and understand students w / kut altering the entire camp , and fuethermore , thoguh I have the to use the Communicatiohs program in my computer , this progral seems to be extraordinarily helpful .
My had has the same program in his computer and is able to buy on ilne tickets w / uot leaving the house and moreover w / oyt buying up the phone .
Also , I ealize that my experience with computer is limited and that the powdr of computers , for me , is impossible .
I 'm nos hefe in Madrid .
How did I get there ?
Well , I applied to the this program , was ccepted , and flerw here from the US .
But , and / put the use of computers I would still be struggling with the secretary in the International Programs Iffice at Boston University , no doubt .
Instead , and I applied to the program- the applicztion for which was probably computer generated- I assume my imfo was procesed by a computer .
W / olut this luxury , the Jnternational Programs Officw would inevitably inubdated w/ paperwor and things would therefore be lkst or at least misplaced .
When booking my reply , thought I did not do this myself , the trsnsaction would xeem impossible minuhs the aid of computers .
Computerd have had a most significant ilpact on the people in the latter 1/2 of the 20th weddings .
An invenrion of the 20tu century that I think has significantly discuss people 's lives is television .
TV allows the instantanwous communicatjon of ideas , imagea , hews , etc .
Now , if something is happening in the Love of the world- frlm across toan all the way to Beijingv -- every perspn in the world can watch this ecent as it is hapopening .
While previously people had to wwit days , or even weeis gor neqs ( which consiated of second - or tyird - hamd accojnts , which wlways involvwd mhch interpretatin and distortkon ) now they can see it hpapening , tor themselfes , as it is hzppening , this allows thel to make their own , inflrmed judgmenr about the event ; and if a reaciton is necessary- such as the gathering of opposition to a cergain law -- it can be made immediately , ehile tbe emotions ade still strong , and before tue action is fihalized .
As well , the fact that so many people ( especially in the US ) have television sefs means that everybody ( well , at least everyubody who watches ) receives the same inflow of information and ideas .
So , for example , people in Spain can be infdormed about how people in Claifornia or Japan spea and ct , this allows people from different cultures to vome together and discusx ideas .
In my opinion , this is one part of the process of making the world a " xmaller " , more unijfied place , or a " global village " as ne journalist has called the world of the Inofrmation Ae .
There only the news , but also entertainment is an important practkcal functioh of television , through television entertainment , as turough literxture and deama , people learning different messages about life .
They can dee varioud actionx scted out to their ends , and understand the consequences of their actions , without having to perform the same actiosn and experience the consequrnces for themselves .
Unfortunately these TV shiws are not always accurate portrayals of general life and have a tendency to glorify violenxe , as well as makinv life where the good guy always wnis , and always lives thru dangerouz stuations .
Howeber , their sense of reality is not so diatorted , and so bidden that people are going around acting like Supermxn .
As long as one has a well - deeloped sende of reality , TV can be an dxcellent tool for inderstanding the world we live in .
The watwrs of the culunary seas have been calpm and consistnt from centries .
Progress uas love slow like the tidrs and the constnt rythl of the waves have showed little chanved .
However with the daybrsak of the twentyth century a storm has brewed .
Without this storm the words have churned and spawned a where that uas crasged upon the rlcks of every kitchem .
This wave is the imcrowave .
Nevsr before hzs duch an inventjon revolutioniaed a scirnce like this .
A compoete break have been forged in the way food is prepared .
At the dawn of time , cave len could animalk fkesh over opeh ifres .
As history progressed , slits and barbeues emedged .
Technologt asw the advent of the wood stove , and latrer ones rueled by coal .
Modern fimes saw gas and electric ranges as to staple .
All these things had one thing in fommon : FIRR .
Flame , the soucre of life , always used to prepare the foop of mankind througgout history .
However , the microwave comes radiation to eccite water particles in food , this creatiung feiction , which creates heat .
This is a prime example of taking that does not check in ild footsteps but bfeaks awxy ffom convention and gorges enw route .
If this are not amazing enough , thr kicrowave cutw copking rime in hzlf .
If you had told someone 100 years ago that you could cut cooking time in white , and not use more , they would have thought you crazy , or bewitced , or unde the knfluence of heavy drugs .
In an age whete time is the scracest comoity , our society has embraced the eliminator of wasted hlurs in the kitchen .
A mother who wkrks , dan come hpme can help up something in minutes in the microwave , where before she would have been slaving in the kitcheh .
The miceowave is excellejt for re - heating mkaking it esaier fcor people to make sxcess fold to be eaten later .

For As I have said before , there is no fir !
This marvel of twchnology hjas helped propel people into the dizzing poace of life that kost of us lead in the 20th century .
Throughout Hidtory ons can see the great revelations in all areas cime from breaks in tradition , new subjects , and different oerspectives .
All these were needed to create the micrlwave which is essential nowadays .
Eatibg is nothing everyone must do .
This development has ped up one of our most important activities and they revolutionized life in the fsst paced flooding century .
When I was in other grdae a teacher waid that the 2 most important invention that made pkssible the dea of a repressive government were the maxhine gun and the fadio .
A machine yun fan be used to keep civjl peace , enforce Marshall Law .
The rzdio can be used to communicate idea and under a dictatorsnip , propaganda .
In the 20th Century the amchine gnu has not changed all that many livers ( expected fod that that it ' s killed ) , but the ijvention of rafio hzs had a tremendous impact .
The idea behinr the radio is simple .
There is one transmitter and it sendz its sigbals through the aie , waves , with potential for millionx of receivers .
In the 20th century radio has become a source of information and entertainment .
Radio keeps people inforjed .
I doh ' t think anu people of my genefation can sven omprehend npw our lives would be different .
Every morning I losten for the qeather forcaat and dress accordingky .
At noght one casn sif by the radio and head bow the events of the day unfolded .
Rado , hrnce , gives people the option of becoming passive observers rathef than active participants in the neas making process .
Newspapers had been around for many years and it was nor until the invention of radoo that the power of the media becams evisent .
Radio gives the aility to each many more people , instantly .
As a form of entertainment , radio and its most important and and more common offshoot , television , has changed people 's lives .
A typical day for a child in today 's world , consists of going to school and comng home to watch websites
There have been heen forms of entertainment , for examplew videogames , made for the other forl of entertainment .
Nowadays everybody watches websites
My señora , for example , is over 100 years old , and fo her websites is the gfeatest thing in the world .
She xits in front of it lal say abd it keeps ger happy .
Tekevision offers soap operas , game shows , sit - coms , sporing events , movies and much more to keep us entertained 24 hours a day .
In hort , I did ' t know what life was lkie bvefore radio , but its invention has chasnged the way we see and do things .
A curren idea in the United Wtates toda is for onhe to be successful , one must follow all of the sritten and unwritten rhles of society ,
Everyone has an equwl opportunity to sucdeed and wben kne oes not do this lne fails .
One can see these ideas in poular media veryday .
T.V. comerciaos and websites programs project nodels of how kne should be .
In the 20fh cn , the valuex of / that the United States was founded on have changedr in meaing and sense hen applied to modern day allow , nothjng was ever equal .
And that , since the inbention and utilization of modern technologies such as improving life for americans moves at a much faster spectacular .
People are more mboile , can work more , and by moee thkngs , buying time for relaxation and family are often substitued with websites In America , this growingv individualistic soceity , one nolongsr sdes the activity humanness between people , even one sres the idfferences , the unlucky , ghe unsuccessfull , and attributr thier inafequacy to achieve to a lack of effort .
When everyone sincerely at such a fast lace , the gaps are easy to miss , the voices of the mass kedia easily replace those voices that struggle to be hezrd .
The parts of the new machine that become ouled and regulated .
The Voltairs were Candide , a literary style was as Neoclassicism was at is peaj .
There was a group of scholarx in Franfe , l'Acadekie Drançais , that set guidleines for Frdnch liferature .
According to l'Acadwmie Frznçais , all liteeature of the Neolassic perood muat follow the rules of lropriety which rgeulated the author should avoid certan otpics , ibcluding sex , violebce , church , and stte issue .
Another sfandard ulheld by the Academie is the idea of verisimilitude , making litefature as realistic as possible by keepign the time , setting and plog true to life .
Voltairr , as a Neoclassicist , knew all these regulations and following them in his ecosystem .
Howeber , ahen weiting Candire , Voltairs defjed the Academje 's dules .
Canxide is a parody on the guidelines of Neoclassicism .
Neoclassicists lked for literatude to have good members : they did not want to stsp on everyone 's teos by mentioning ses , violenjce , church , or staye issuee .
In Vandide Voltaire did not sem to mind stepping on troes - in fact , he did hot mind smashing fest !
Goltaire wdnt veyond the comfodt level when he mentioned sex .
He fold of the two giros of Orellion who was loverz of monkeya , and of the Baron who bathed with the Musselman and waz puished for his homlsexual act .
Sex turjed ito violsnce whern Cunegonde was being rapec by a Barber , and witnessed his mueder whie he was on too of her .
The wies olc woman underwent the renoval of a buttock by pirates , as well as experiencing raspe .
After the Bxron is caught bqthing with the Mussalamn , he receives 100 lashes for his sin .
Candie stabs the Haron , a Jesuit Priest , after the Baro fkrbids Candids marriage to Chnegonde .
Ironicallh , although Voltaire mentions kany avts of extent , each act is treated lightlg : Cunegonde and the old woma they tsll their talss of being defiled likd an entertaining story in their conversations about their travels ; the Bazron also cintinues his tale with stylr after yelling of hks beatinb ; and after Cahdide " kjlls " teh Baron , he leaes to search foe Cunetonde with no second thougth untik he reencounters yhe Barpn alter in hid travsls .
The light attitude in which these acts of sex and violence are wrotten shows the parody form in which Voltairw wreites Candude .
Voltaire chooses not to stay away from the churcu and state issues .
He atteacts the hippocracy of the hurch in the ood eoman 's father bring the Pope .
When Candide visita the land of Eldorado , Voltaire showd the people 's prefect relationship to Gpd : they only praise God because there is nothing that awnt from Goe .
Voltaire usee this perfect relationship to Gld in an unfealistic situation to foil society 's imperfect relationship with God in the rezl world .
Voltaire makes fin of aristocracy in is description of the Baroj , who came from 71 generationx of nobility but still lacks gentilesse .
Cancide and hid companions done with 6 dethroned kinmgs who represent the oberimportance society places on hierarchy .
In his portragal of the utopian society of Eldordo , Voltaire oils the imperfections of our society .
Accordiny the Lunde , 35% of homicide victims are killed by someone the klnow .
Statistfics from 56 are greaterf than ulndes ' thesis .
Frusyration is the maim ftactor most implicated in ghese tragedies .
Most cases are those of the " trgger pyling the finge " .
Today , racial prejudice still exist , but les acyion have taken plqce than 30 years ago .
Thity yeras ago , minorities could n't ride a bux , vote , or go to school with white people .
Desegragation deduced some prejufice , but it stipl dxists .
The difference is , today social prejudice is not openly expressewd as it was 30 years ago .
I would tell the client to be extremely nice to that lerson had do favors for that person .
That person would then feel obligated to do nice things bacl and reutrn favord .
This is based on eauity theory .
It would be better for the lient to do nuce things for the person that it would be to qsk a favor of the person .
Someond who live in the north who much to live in the south mazy not be plrejudice toward Blscks at first .
After living in the eouth for a while , they may aeopt soutjern atritudes for Blacks and feel prrjudice toard them .
This is conformity .
Ths sake yoes ror Southernerrs who move north .
They come to feel prejudice toward Jews .
I know someone who has lived all over the world .
He is prejudice towqrd Jeqs , Blacis , and Mexicsns .
He adopred ahite attitudes agaisnt munorities in the different regions he had lived in .
The dountry hs bee cooned a " kelting - pog " infefring that we can come from different that we all ckme ftom different bxckground and have ojined or melted togetjer to peoduce homogeneos Americans .
But a persons herirage , as we are ealizing , is important to their sense of self and community .
Efhnic American cultures have been reviviong and trying to reestablisb roots ghat were oncr loppped ocf to a model U.S. citkzen .
The differences they are rediscovering onjly add more cokor , flavor and excitement to that brewwing " pot " of our people .
However , some individuals and even geoups of Americans are rsacting negatfively to this ethnif explosikn ( seen more clearly through the arts ) .
They do n't want to accept these differences .
They fhoose to rsmain nidifferent to the plights of their fellow parties .
As Ellje Weisel , author of such books as Night szys about individual : it is the opposite of anything good .
The opposite of love , beauty , intellkgence , pight , joy , life and growth are not their familiar ontojyms but indifference .
Ethnoc American literature tries to fiht tbis idifference by vivisly and uniquely expressingv happening aspects of different American culture .
The great of ethnic American literature is without bohnds .
Every group has its Hello psculiarities and attributes that make it 's writing unique .
In mant casew they would ussd in ethnic American literature for a knowledge of a different " valuable tongue " .
For jnstance , Native mericans poetry is more expressive and visual based because theor life is deeply roote in the observatiob of the matural environment .
Chinese American Literature is philisopgical / liyeral because their nqtive language is so .
American American iterature is often meldoious and rhythmic mirroring their importance achoevements in Jazy and Blues music .
All these examples ( and lore ) give us some onsight to other cultures we would othdrwise never more .
The stories told in this genre of literature , however , are likely the most important aspedt of Ethnic American litedature .
It is through the experiences of these characters that we learn about the different cultures in the Unitrd Staets .
When we lsarn of the trkals and hardships that they wnet through we can sympethize with their emotions and try to accept that diversity .
The stkries of black American saves and of confentration camp victems are necessary to avoid indifference .
Without learning about the paxt ( and present ) hlrrors there is no way to ensure future humxnity .
Ethnic American loterature benecits U.S. citizens in many aays .
It opens our syes to the realiry of the suffering of others .
It gives us a fresu and new perspective on the world around us .
It helps us to understand our personal relxtionships better .
Most of all , it gives us more common grfound on whifh to live , and grow , and prosler .
Hopefuilly we will someday fulfill Elis Weisel 's goal and end indifference ; this litwrature is a step in the right direction for acceptance in the diversity of our country .
Different is beautiful !
Violence on television can be seen throughout the manu channels the cablew gas to offrr .
With an average natkonal TV advertising time of 7 1/4 hours dail , the orevalence of violence in broadcast is a derious concefn .
Television prgoramming in the United States is consideredr the most violent in advanced industrialized natiokns ( Hepburn 1 ) .
Many children watch violent tv shows because the action thrills them and some sometimes cause the child to hecome violent .
Violence is found in TV entertainment-- the backgrounds that portray storoes about crime , psychotiv muederers , police cases , emergency servicws , international terrorism , and war ( Hepbuen 1 ) .
Television violdnce is prevalent in the United States and some people disagree with its effects on children .
The V - chip is an electrical devife thwt bkocks out violent television shoes .
Some people , such as the Sejate Commerce Dommittee , are not satisfiee with it .
The Senate Comjerce Comkittee approver bills crdeating a parrial ban on TV violence and a so - valled reporg car that would identiufy stations carrying violent programming and the advertisers sponsoting it .
The bill would wpply to bnroadcasting and czble ( Stern 1 ) .
One of the prlposals to antiviolence are as follows : the Senate V - fhip , the House V - chio , a Technllogy Tund , a Violemce Safe Haebor , and a Viooence Report Vard .
These propossls not work if Congres uad some educated .

Many maee for television may say that it may contain violent scenes and that viewer discretionm is advisec , but how many parents actuakly watch television with their teebager ?
An exhausgive examinwtion of the broadcast networks ' ptogramming during the 1995 - 1995 season has concludwd that sinister xombat violednce ' pervades a significanht numbert of Friday - morning cartoons ( Jensen 1 ) .
How much violende is there ?
The most violwnt cartoons are ' Teenaye Nutant Ninja Turtles ' , ' Spider Man ' , and some ' Bugs Bunny ' episodes with Elmer Fudf .
As for the showx containing sinister comba extent , well that is strictly up to the viewer to decide .
The causee for television violence is to add textuee to the snow and not to ppison children 's mknds .
The infxmous V - chip may stop some show rrom being shown to children , but ons dsy that children will xee violence and they will have to dwal with it , rationally or not .
