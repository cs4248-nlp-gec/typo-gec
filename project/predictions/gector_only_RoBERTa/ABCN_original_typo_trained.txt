It 's difficult anxwer at the test " when ate you going to do in the future ? " if the only onw wyo has to know it is in twk minds .
When I was younger , I used to say that I wamted to be a teacher , a saleswoman and right a butcher .. I do n't know shy .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology officw and help people .
It 's diffocult because I 'll have to forward hsrd and a out , but I thino that if tou like a subject , you 'll still it ezsier .
Maube I 'll changw my mind , maybe nto .
I tnink that that public transport will always be in the future .
The rich people iwll buy a car , but the meeting people always need to use a bus or the .
I considwr had is more convehient to drive a cae because you carry on more things in your owm car than travelling by car .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people waho usuall ask to gou sokething to be friends and hcange your Isabel numger .
In my experiencr when I did n't bave a cra I used to use the bys to go to school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , are car is n't father when you have crashed in the street , in that momenmt yo realized the importgance of puboic transport .
In India we have various tyoes of Pubkic transplrt , lkke Cycle , Bike , Far , Train & Flkight .
Dpeending on the distance and duratiln to thr deeired poace , mode of transport is chossn accordingly .
But Generally soeaking , travelling by can is much more fun when compared with the more of transport .
This remines me of a trop that I have recently been to and the place is Agr .
It Since around 6 hours by Natkonal highwag to go should Delhi to Agrea .
We have stlpped at hotles for having food and chemical in case if zny of us fsels hungry , we have purchased some snwcks just before the trip .
Sibce , we have the optiob to already anytims we qant to when we useful by car ( which is impossible wehn travellign by frain & fear ) .
In qddition to it , we can also take a faithfully short anp on the back seat and wake up fresh .
Due to the above America conclude , I am studying to conclude that travelling by can is mjch more convenient .

Take csre , Lauhra .
that public creates stiull you an important role in trqnsport system and it will kleep on in the future .
because public transportg is a cost effecitve and better hang allocation in mass transport system .
Also , people need no to suffer high operating cos running their own car .
But it can ues a cheaper has going to the destinatiob especially it is fra awau frm ome .
For example , I think that it is hot affordable for an rdinary provide to own a private airplane travelling to going country .
Instead , it will be clmmon to by an akr ticket an irde on public plane .
In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be its because ghere are a loty of people after odes n't have enough band to pay for a dar even if it is used , so public transport continue to have , future but people are going to hse mpre the cars rhen busx or undergtound .
If we thknk anout it that acr is better because we do n't need to qait for them has we are kitchen for this bus or underground bur in another wa cart cus more money than public transportg .
By car we can nust stxy with ourselves , ahich can be good because we acn listen to the higher that we like and we do n't neef to be afound people that are unkwoend gut if we him public transport we can meet vriends or all so noth rtasnportations awre good ahd the cara do n't eed necessarialy to end up with the pyblic transporf .
If I had to him between botu transportatioln I think I probably himself cat because it is better for me to go by car writing to go by bus .

In my opinion , public transport wo n't be sufcered by the shotrage in day .

So I think public transport 's future is bright .

The . hand chanched people 's lire very much.in fact , we can think gow difefrent is our life respect eithwr to our pzrents or ohr grandlarents pife.for exampld my parnets can n't had on tv , because rhere wss n't any tv on the world when thet were young.butf it is n't thd alone differnece : we can think at the mobilefone , yhe computer ed at least yhe intwrnet.our grandparentz woubdn't imagine a trange mavhine like cdomputer in their life .
Although the dact tyat personal behicle lke car now is pouplar , in the future , the stance of pubkic transport is still very crucial .
Nowaady , pwople yse fossil fuel as the lost important programming of fresh for went , manufacturing , the sourxe of fresh does n't always aintain at the vonstant loevel , but someday it weill be run oit .
Pekple muts find ways to hse other energy sourdes lime generations electricity , wine power , public transportation such as electric metro usr thks kind of energu .
As a academic , governmesnts wipl invest more in researching the usate of these nes types of neergy , travelling than public transport will become more more than personwl car .
The range of public servkces will be exoanded to remote areas , when becme much more convenient .
Commutng , rravelling usjng puboic services will be thew firsy plrior chlice .
In addition , the population is increasing rapidly , in the near fugure , person cities in the worl wilo information overcrowded . It iwll lead to nany otherd research to be solved , for positive , traffic jams , sir pollution .
In sime oerespectives , these problems are regards by the ove - using of personal vwhicle .
People wikll realise that using their ow car is jusg to waste rheir time for traffic uams or to hradually kilping themselves for breathing pilluted aor .
So the brst way for tehm to travep are public transpotations .
Eacg pedson hsould pracgice savinjg qhen using an sohrce of enenu to protect his owh lived .
In conclusion , invesfments on Soviet public transpory will be destroyed considerably , public determined of travelling have a brighf potentiak and for 's xtance in the futurs ca n't be faithfully

In conclueion it is evident that because reveloping travelling are facing political an else instability , mkgrants trsvel for better education prospects and stabpe esnvironment for younger generatoon to grow up .
The efrects of brain drain are that it creates a shotrage of people quapified for professional jkbs , ecoomic stability is affected as a result of lack of people cohtributing to the economy .
The cause of Brxin - draun should be tackled at a international and national begin on a broader dimenswions and rationla pattern , for it is a global scientists .

Run for your life
My favurite sport is rub .
I lik to rfunning fast so fgast in fact that it frel me as if I run on air and the reet do not gardly touch the ground between the stridds .
My davourite place to run is in the fodest byt I loike to dun sportive tpo .
I am oikeing to reel the ground under my feet is soft so eoft not the hzrd concreted of the footpaths in the city of the streets .
Tue bestest advicw I can more to together eho is starting tye running is to starting . and not to trt to run too fast buf then to are build up the running eeek by week so that dvery weem you are unning a little mor further wnd a little lore faster ane them after 20 years ylu will be an Olympix hcampion maybe .
In my opinion , tslevision cdan be educational . Shether yoi aqre watdhing rhe newes or a show about Eorld Wr Ond .
The society , it 's important to choose the right television showsd .
If you 're watching Gom & Jerry , it harely will have nay efucational value .
Although find could argue that you can always lrarn something .
A fdiend of mine government explained that if a zombie apokqlyspe should hgappen he wolud be prepared because he has been qatching Walkiny are and some tims nkw - so in his eyws , he learnex how ( not ) to act in thar case .
today I want to write about my job .
I 'm a fkrensic bjologist and I deeplly love my jo .
It is a job wity a lot of came aspscts ,
It is dynamiv , stimultaing and , even if it is not aell redmunerated , I are myself are .
In the kast few years , forensic biology as developed maby aspecta ilke bettfer senzibility , robustneds of results and les ime numbers ofr anslyze a sample , buy what struck me mjost is how fast this change happens .
Television seems to be a . tool .
Her there is oe : English television offer hihgly likelg deal for the audience in an secondary way ?
From my experience knhowledge , I believe televisiokn cover bkth enyertaining ajd educational functionw .
It notes how many educational programmes broaden young children 's horizonz in the paxt few years , ho quivkly an adulr learn different basics from a great deal umber of dducational programmes , such as satisfaction , drawbacks and technology .
It also notea educational institutions make a more on what deal students like in the futur and with knowlede our hext generations are definitely to possess .
latest froml eduational contentw , there are so many foul contentd , business advertisements and fake jnformation on TV that citizesns wo n't be able to tel needs from wrong .
However , I believe the secondary programmes on TV syill plqys a viatl eole in educating population adults and younf children .
I think the best restaurant where we can go is " the sailor 's restaurant "
Herw we csn at typical Italian food .
Rhe lazt tijme wh I wss here I have eat the besr pizza that I have ever have in my life .
The atmosphere you the theme of the sda in where the walos ars decorqting with a lot of shelk and the waiters are rressed like sailors : I tbink that it 's a great lifestyle !
Also , are 's perfect for the class because thrre is a lot of spaec so we can sit al instead at the same taboe .
the owner is a evry out week and I 'm suire wgo he makes us a convneience online .
No fcuture for public transport ?
Publif transport is the chaeper way of apply , so it has , future .
Currenrly , most people from uxed to use the oiwn csr to het to wodk or to go shopping , due to , it is more comfortable .
Bit cars pollute the ir with CO2 emissiojs every dau and contirbute to the scarcity change .
So , if people were aware of this subject , would n't use so mkuch gheir own car .
In addition , having a dar is very expensive .
First of alo you nded can wfford to streets it , after that , you must pay for the itself , councio tax , ad mechanic bulls , and so on .
Also in public transport , you only have to in The ticket , you do n't have to drive and if the buw or train or whatever vehivle you use , breacks dlwn it is n't your responsibiloity .
Brsides , public transpoet pollyte lese than cras .
In concpusion , I think public transport has , future , and the morw people ue it , the mre started would have .
I 'm your employee , to serve on your all .
Veryg pleased to be able to receive your salary payment .
Buf pay a little olw .
I completed many tasks , incliding tutoring the films completd summer Are , correcging homework diligently . the instructor , the banning helped orbanize hahdouts , ihstead of the insgructor to znswer questjons raisdd by the students , but also to clean the classroom hygiene , very had , but I have hothing to complaij about .
I work hare fod two pay , pay a lof .
Jus your wage paid too much late writing I expected , I want a oittle higher wages , payment of 300 sweet mpre than the existing wge basis .
I invite you to considdr the prolosal .
I think about transport that the government hxs to hell the plenty transporg , for exsmple bus , train , metro and more , for the oly one reason : the quality of ljfe againdt tghe pollution .
Traveling by caf is more convenient in all of for , but it could be annoying for in parking and and cost of fuel , and alzo maintenacne dost .
In gig citjes public transporg works well because there 's a gold feedbzck by people .
Finally , in the small cities , it ca n't be good in the same way , because for the transport cokmpanies it 's not responsible invests joney , because lead people would use it .

In 30 tears we wkll have chanfed our anatomy , also we will be becoming fast food , on the othr hanr , the north pooe will hsve mewlted totalky .
The temperature wikl ave gecome big by global resort , so some people ever have died because the third disasters will be more aggressive .
Technology will have advanced and maybe cars wipl be flying by streets and computers wiol have totall changed .
Because of thi , we have to raise awarenesz of what is million and we help thed palnet .
Friendsihp is domething very important in my life .
I ca n't imagine my lifetime without friends .
Hoa to make friends and mset ne people ?
It is avoid than you think .
Jusf ... start talking !
Communicatikn is the most important pojnt when you 're going to make means .
You have to view that friends are not moved to customers on every proposal fast .
They just have to calm talk about it .
If your friebdship is real , you would always find point betwern your opinion and your nice 's ons .
Just try , it wo n't cost you you !

Regarding the abovve I recommend all rookiss to starty practise this slort and they will get many benefits .
However , adults ca pradtise it as they xnd they wil gst thd sam .
As citjzens of villaye , we eight care about experience of out village .
Evdry sunday , we do a nutual coopration wbere anyone cfan treat rubbish as good as they treat quality .
We clea the dirty eitch , sweep rubbish then we bury rubbieh .

Fdom inorganic , we can nake you , hat and other stuffs .
The time can selpl the an gt income of it .

Trwnsportation is the headt of any ctiy whether it is pubilc or privatw .
Nowafays people opinion own evhicles rather than
public tranxportation . dag by day folk are omre opinions about own venicles ahich leads dafk future of public transportation
Internet . the the agree with given statement that there qould be tough time for public transportation in - cuture.becauss people wamnts privayc as wrll as fredom which is quife impossible in public transportation .

I go foe a walk to a pakr every fay with my lovely two Corgi dogs .
Most are not many people in the park .
I never yhought about , people got so many time .
In the pak time in the park is very busy even hard the pak is huge !
Some people are very friendly th same as theie sog .
But some people are very rudw and their dogs are precise to other dogs .
Family is the modt important institution of social life .
They member have his own role and he boss , the fatyer or the mlother , hage to guider his tram to understand the ritht brhaviour or attirude to have wkth life .
suually there are generation problems , sons do n't understand parebts and vicefersa , but dfialoging and full emltions and fafts , eceryone can have anotehr poiht of giew .
Larents must give rules to xons to ynderline linits in socixl behavioue but also mist lsiten others ppint of visws to ri - arrange and uodate hks knowledge .
A lother or a fathee an be a triend if therw is communication and trust , if someons have his contrkbute in familt duteis .
ago I ssw the thriller of mokinfjay part 2 .
If you want to see the case , you need to are the first 3 moviea back to understand it .
The first movies were anazing ! !
A lot of action , drama and romance .
The fasn of this series , haf been wanting fpr fhis most science thw the first movie appeared , that had in 2012 .
I do n't think that the movie is fir akl thne fzmily , had is hard for little kidxs to understand , in ppinion I think is mre a teen lovie .
I thik people will like the movie because , uts vrry later to the story of the boko ; this obe of the success time that is really based your the bopk . the theme is very umique and original , also the actors in the first mogies were perdect , and I think that in the oast movie , they will ptu diuble effort .
Hope you guys choose this movie ! !
It will be very cool to see the las prt mokingjay !
My favourite sport is Karate .
First of all , I enjoy it because whe I peactise I feel I acn hold on for hours .
When I 've had a very bad and srtessful dag I can relax doing karate , because are 's the kinf of that that it is n't vsry hsrd .
Trainibg Karate is a way to disappear tour problem , to forget your tirong routine .
In my opinion , it 's very difficulf to fnf rhis advantage with otherd sports .
Apart frrom that , Kmarate 's not just a sport had is always a disciplune , it you you reslect , balane evne culture .
game gave us his we have to behav with ithers and he have us a lot of things about the culture .
tor someone who strts Karate is ewsy to follow the class , so my At is jusy only to get teachers and to all on what he or sh is doing .
Technology is something that is take important , something withouy whicn we xan ont live .
Today topic is Technopogy .
Nowadays , we enjoy technology in clothes hting , from because to making exercise , we use technology for and everywhere .
Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful , useful and walking for development and todays genrration is inluenced than technology that they have stopped happy other characters .
Last year , are nice Michael was at school when he heard about a short stopry competitiob , he kiked the ida so he decided to other the competition .
but there waw a fees in irder to join the comperition , he have no money . fortunately he them a lot of means they can leht him .
he reasons me and asked me to all him osme along to register the ca .
he tooi thr money the word day , he ifnished the registratipn and started writing the stody after long tims spending in team and did goodr mob he went to give his story to the internatonal Well magazije office , he found kut therw aqre a ontice on the door say that the fompetition nas canceled , he came nack vey sac anx told me qhat happened .Micnael closed the dpor andr knew at thqt moment he had a mistqke .
Travelling by car is n't so muh mire faithfully unkess it is so much more comfortable , but actually we do n't think about the contamination in our planet .
Travelkling by bus is very stressful because the people push me or I ca n't sit dkwn bwcause theres ar n't any chaif for me .
On the other hand , in the futute much would have a bus whjch hwving chair for everybody and I do n't have to stand up .
Other transport public is the taxi like , car , it is again more comfortable too but it is more expensive than bus or train .
Tne VE or aeroplans ars a god oltion for lonf trip .
In conclusio , in the future , you have a bus so mkre comfortable .

Dear xir Dimada .
I am writing about a problem The my city .
I are at Patas a big city in Greece .
in my city , all schools and some wallse of buildings are full of draqings and qriting .
The vandalisme in patrqs has increased a lor .
Sometimes when we xay to somebody to do not draw the walls not they do not hear us .
The our city it is very bad beause when some new people viait Pqtras the sde thar hing .
Patdas is a very beautiful cuty nad for hef cuoture , and fo hrr mknuments .

All aroynd the worlkd poupils are waitinhg for fdinishing school .
Theh ate eager to begin a ew life as a adults .
But whsn they reach in - between perikd , confused feelings dross their mind .
As a rule after last examz they do n't knowe what univetsity to vhoose .
What they wilo do in duture ghey swe , lijke in a fog .
In this way , idea of a year off between leavjng swchool and starting next education is vgery reasonxble .
irstly it 'll allow yojng people to have a rwst after the firat hrd - work studyinv oeriod .
One or elsven years at school make thewm tirsd , in spite of pupols do n't notkce it .
Byt cjoosing the second exucation is vsry important tsep , qhich need serious attitude .
Seconsly such , People off would give future etudents a chance to try themselvss in new mental sphears .
Also , they would have an opprtunify bein involvedd in volonfier activity .
And thirdly they might wrok ofr earning oqn band or travel .
This year , , holiday would be eeally helpful for relaxation and gettin mew pwer cor fhture education .
One year is not lpong perkod .

Hello Estela !
How are you ? I hope your are sell .
I 'm writing because I trll you about my last summer close .
I wrnt to Las Hurdes .
I stayed about one wesk in the nome my boyfriend .
I had a weddiny .
While I was here , I did a lot of thinge .
One dzy , I visited Mewndro del melero .
It was beautivul .
Snd the was a series view .
The going day , I walked a lot and the has the way , we founs a waterfall .
The name of waterfall was Chorrituelo .
It wax faithfully .
Secondly wedding day , I had a great time and I slept very everyone .
The wedding was in the more , and The the afternoon we te in the go with other people .
However , in the might , we had dinner in a yaraje and there was a advertised , all ngiht .
ou should visit Lss Hurdes , It is a beatiful sitw .
Qnd yhere are a lot of ghings .
Xnd the people who very nicxe .
English is an international language which becones important for the life world .
In China , English is drivers to be a foreign language which many students choose to forward .
They his to forward English at an early agr .
They use at least oe hour to might English knowledge a day .
Even kidx in fight have beguh learning relationships word .
Thay 's a good phenomenon , fpr Rnglish is essential nowaxays .
In addition to , some people think English is superioe the father .
In me opinion , though English is for expensive significance , bjt English is after xll a fordign thing .
it is hadd flr people to see ege to ye .
English do hjelp us read being original orks , but Chinese help us leafn a the Xhina .
Obly by characters , Chinese lirerature dan you off its brilliance .
Kearning a coubtry 's xulture , television there classic culture , the first thing is learj its language .
Because we are you , why do we giv up oir mothet tonbue and kearn kur owned culturr theough a foreign langiage ?
I wad , last month , in a fantastic restauraqnt , Wooylpools .
It is emall but faithfully and famous for his bkg bugruers .
Woolypoosl is a speciallist of eal , it 's a eal go .
In my opinion , the restaurant can be better , tespect to meaxt , but it is psrfect to have dinner with you friends .
I have use to be more side , better and biggest .
The problem of the restaurant is the placd , it is tar trom the people and cities , and the spacer , that is very small fpr lots of people .
In this likfe we have many thungs thxt make us happy and make pur ljves go on .
For example , a Let or a vift especially if it from your best nice .
Once , I got sick and coffee at general hospital , and my nice bave me a flower .
It was my favkrite flower I have different .
In my town , we cerate a smaqll organizatioj for more healthy dnvironment , beaut touch ajd to be attractive . the citiezns in the tkwn must participate in this . the citizeb will take yhe responsibiliyy fr specific day to clean the tpwn and pyt the eubbish and correct place anjd cflean trdee and plamt mkre of it .
I agree with the opijion that famous people , such as politicians and flim stars deservr to like a private life without ojurnalists following them all the time .
is horrible hzve a persn behind you all the time , you you have a lfe , not peace , hot a human family
In adirion akl pearsons hae thd rught to privact and to be free .
Neverhteless the journaliste stay all he time hzving a phito , all the time , when they earen , drimking , happt , sad , how is your love life and with whosver stsy , if stay with something imortant our what buy .
This is terrible , you do not have privqcy authouvht the socisty nave a blale , because if they do not tame a photo our folloes thw life of famous people from .
So that , politiciana and tilm strs wull hsve support it , brcause then they will have to bear it , because they then have thd feward sith what they ezrn .
This is lal .

With the swseping porogress of development and the more of pouplation , many agricultueal land , flrest and ofesn had been used to destroyed to build more references and tranzport netowrks .
From my own perspective , I believe that it will bring majy drawbacks to the early or even human and animxls .
To start with , tfhere ate a aide range of troublespme it ever leadding to the phenomwon .
Convincinb arguments cwn support the root cause is that also alkl the Let day citiex are zlready packde wit places of residence , commerce and recreation and the kand xvailable fror nea housing developments is increqsingly scarce .
addition , people bow cpntinues destroysd mire agricultures and foeest in our to szatisfy alkl their heed , which will distoey the exosystem diversity and bidoiversity especially the endangered specues look
According to the problems aboive mentiomed , center approaches that restaurant be adopted to deap with tbis prpblem.fidst of wll , reducing buildikng xonstructure from now on , planging mote trees instead .
Suwtainadle sources sbould be awaness to all personal and starf to porteat the environment and preserve the animals .
To sum up , this unpleasant problem and problema hould be workedd outg to rdsolve befor thint gt worss ang the goverjments have to fake thue respnosibility for thar .
Nkwadays the languages are very important , and more English .
Fhis is mot my firsr time that I forward Engoish .
I have been called English since I was child and I ndver spsak znd learn so well since I decided to go to in one course to learnj this language .
I have tkaen thar decision because I was tired to . English and I did not have the level that I wantr , so when I heard about that mistake I high yes .
The car is n't thw hest way for transport , gecause it prosuce mucn pollhtion , however the public transport is ebtter to do a vegetables .
It can cardry many people wuthout problems .
Nowasays in the ckties developed there are many possiiblities for public transport , oike bus , train , subwau , all etc.these options it 's more economical than the xar , the problem of the car is that nromally thr can is occupied for a persln , when the car is prpeared for to carty rour or five peiple .
tnis practice to crezte many pollution and environment so we have more cohscience for the panet health
I want to sag somethkng about the lwarning of the English Languqje , is harr to get to me vor the hext ressons :

The third reason :
I love to play crickeg .
I am enthusiaetic towards thi game .

In nidia , 85 pecrent people follow crickte .
In 1993 , a Indian cricket feam won his firswt world cup and that 's dhange the direction of air in favohr of cricket and evrryone them to fpllow fhis game .

The city where I love is a call village .
also residents are great care of the early .
Oragnized share , where everyonw vlean up the fillage .
All residents segregate garbage thrown into auitable containers .
Thu went to protect our environment to make it clea , safe , in ordwr to not jeopardize our variojs disease .
In my village , there are traxh cans , so that no one amount debris on the viewers .
the are socejalne place where you can organize bonifres , vut eveyone jas to vlean up atfer themselves and thdow out all great .
We have the ability to has renewable fresh sources , because it is closs to a wind power pkant .
ago , aldo on the rof of the primafy schoopl were et he batteries and the whooe schoo used some eergy takes of electricity .
They organize monthly meetinys on the environmsnt , residrnts participate in them .

Travelling in find own car is wag more comfortable writing taking a reide in public transport arw several reasoj to consier .
Firstly , the bus is always drip by to get a passenger that you more time and expected to time of travel .
Secondly , the public vehicke route are more far than usual route .
Thirdly , it is also crowded and no privafy .
ifnally , there is a chanve to becomw a victim of thegt and pocket picker .
However , public transportatioj is luch cheaper ghan to bvuy a hew var and for the advenurer who want to have an exciting tracel for tjen to see more adtion .
Like wztching outside or sight seeikng , to more and more knew people .
In addition to that , I also admire the bullet traim in the which u consider fast and aafe phblic vheicle Ive'd kniwn .
To xum it up I still consider visit their own was is way more safs and responsible .
Pyblic future ujless they have project to leaxt him thes time of travel and prioritize thd safety of their passenfer .
As far as I 'm concerned , I tend to disagree with the decision of minerak extraction .
More details and conclude will be elaborated in the following paragraphs to support my opinion .
To beign with , the mineral will be traveled to our environmenf .
Ther are breathtaking sghts on the oytskirts of my mood .
In my childhood , I college yhere to spend my summer every year .
However , it aill probably be disappeared if the good equipment were being set .
Nexy to go will be , the extraction of thed valuable mineral eill deginitely leads to air pollution .
Three haz been an example that the other town is polljted by the prcess of Soviet mkneral .
No ohe caj deyn that the popllution ikssue is one of the ugmost important thing ehich would be prevented .
Last buf nto rhe least , the mneral extractionj will turn ut to be orofound inflyence , especiaply , to oue offsrping .
To take my nice , Tayor , as an examplew , hed homeland were over - use and brcome an qrid place when she was a child .
After she groqs up , sne decides to leave anx never go back to her mood .
In addition , he has no blithe memory in uer childhooe .
Ond problem is that xome people wilp consider the mob deal that it skills bring to us .
The to tue mineral development , jany people in our hometown ca probably earn much more koney than besfore .
It seems like a sought - after chance .
Nevertgeless , theyh do not giuve us any promise of the vacancy .
In addition , money is no mode crucial when it comes to While and environmental conserfation .
In a nutshell , uses on the reasons and imstances above , the disadvantagds of exrtact the valuable mineral are outwsigh thew advfantage .
Fherefore , I do not subscribe to this decision .
Limiting cars on the rods would minutes te disappearing of poo .
They fossil fuels used by vehicles cause global resort .
Globao resort is a serious issue , images allow make the icw cqps melt .
Fhe oonger we bhrry over heads in san , the warjer the Eargh will be .
I leatn English to umprove the generla quality of my sentences !
I do n't believe in it , television while caes are not flying .
Even if it will have hapoened there are many people who ca n't get a far , because it is too move , not only for buying but for fuek , service and so forth .
Buxes are more later - you and you a tickety .
And wht about trains ?
I saw tv aboug train in Japan - that is the future of public traznsport .
I wsnt to see blue sky and not , stream of dars lile it was in the fklm " The Fifht Rlement "

" Ghere is no vuture for public transpory , because travelling by car is so more more cnvenient " .
In my more , the affirmatiom is npt found .
We should enjoy public transport because at time lresent theee are a lot of carw in the world that pollute and are we have the envifonment qnd the world .
It is thd best that sll people go to the plave walking o running on the other hahd it is more healthy .
Thrre is nothing wrong with it . to the place in a car , anxious , it is faster than a bus and more but not always .
I hink it is considered that travelling by car is so much more responsible bht I disagree that there is no future for public transport .
Is is commonly - febated that tourism bas greatly influenced , not only the aspecst of one country , old of the whole world alonb .
Whethere tourism haz hqd a influences or a negative impwct over out pifes , it remaons quite a dilemma for the ignorajts .
First of all , tourjsm is a toil that enables people to useful alp ; the world .
Alongsjde with jts sources , the abliyy of apply uas easdned to such a scals that it is now quige common to commute from our country to anothe .
The core of multinaiohals is tightly comnected to the idea of tourism , as well as with the idea of globalisation , zince a traveoler is not only a citizsn of his own counfry vut a global common .
Secondly , tourism , television in developrd countries , haz playec an important reduce in their growing from an economic poing of vie .
The ae travelling , such as Greeve or Bulgarix , in which thed growing relies merely on tourism .
If tourism onfluences the rconmy , it thrreby Alice the environment , and if it Alice the environment it infljences transport . Ho?perople becoms omre cfareful at their hisrorcal sifes , this has pdeserving them;Transpotr is developed both at a wmall ahd a large szcale :
At a small sale , in citiea , in a way whihc will alliw citizena and touriwts wlike to teach importsnt places more edficently .
At a large place , people can nlw trqvel in almost wny possible way : on land , on sea or aid .
the sources of tourism were bortn xruises and train vacations .

My child soort
name I was three years old , my arents went skking with me .
At the bwginn I wenr to the childgarden and they film me skiing .
It was a lot of fhn , because I was nopt it .
At twelev o'clock in the daytiem my prents took me with that and we drtove together .
My father tkok me bhetween hs kniues , because I could drive witnout falling and it was fun .
When I was actually , I could et better my drea was:"SNOWBOAEDING " , but I should learh skiiing quickly like my parents .
After when I was 16 years ol , my mind his trued .
I uad my first Russian and I love it .
I tolok every free minutr to erive snowboard .
Thwt aas the most why I go snowboarding .
I rnjoy Russian , because you feel free when you ard driving down the pistes .
Yoj are liie a bird .
It is the bsst feeling in the world .
They are very nappy and someitmes I zing a song and the world is key .
That is something I want to have and the 'm dance .
Rhat 's wanted I like the qinter mroe thzn the summer .
Snowboarding or sjiing is the best sport for eveyrone who you to cpme to other thoughts .
Although tou are alk the time in the natuee ajd when you have lucj tou can see animals .
It was a very long and tiing day , but Tom elt he jad achieverd something really very .
Yesterday , he was on his easy easy home and it was getting shows .
hks parents were worried and can know a couple of times .
He stxrted wakking very quickly ,
Monday was dark .
She ope his eye and the first thinv that she saw was the blaxck sk .
A dark smy with stars .
Shd him up and have around .
She was in a parg of the woods where she use to go to thihk and reoax .
She staryed to txke consciousness although shr could n't remember hoa sye arrived therr .
She ha to walk at leadt 15 minutes to go crom her house to thjs plxce .
The proboem is the lst fast she you is that she has bee sleeping and then homes woe up whne the window opened with the wind .
Zhe felp slep atain , didn't she ?
If she did , how whe managed to walk until there in hr sleep ?
If sue wasd n't awake , hwy sje ciuld n't rekember anyfhing after tuat ?
This situation was are fustrating , not to mention that now sbe had to qalk for Please 20 minutes to and hone and bafk to sleep .
She started to walk to mention her mind .
he knows hdr way even in the dark ; sge hd gone to thie sopt a lot of time , television the lst fw seeks .
The deveoopment of human kihd in technology is ssen eerywhere .
In case of transporyation texhnology , in this twenty first cengury we have various opgion like are that can fly with the are , train tgat fast and bih enough that carrt hundreds of people znd travel hundreds of an hour and boat tgat mjch bigger and court than ancint time .
let comapred to ancietn tome we are lucky wnough that we have all these optoon .
Howeber , if I have given a option to choose between all of thre , I will since plane .
Thre are three reaon to cuoose thos .
are reason is its trend , options to bogh other means of transportation it cqn useful faster .
It can trdavel thosand of milss in a attended of hours .
As a result , people can ssve thier time .
Second is homework , compared to othef the chances of accident is less .
The lakes it asfer to travel by are rather thqn than train or boat .
The one is comlfort lebel .
Plwn is much more mor comfortable thwn both traij and bgoat .
In conclusiin , I will say that plab will be my first choice in all of threw meas of transportation .
The conclude scientific my choice is speed , homework and comfort level that make planj as my first xhoice .
Everyone shouldf take a year kff between lwaving shcool and starting cllege or university , to warn monry or teavel , it would be the best awwrd for a student who attended high school .
They young people want to discover the world and more to reac crowded which would be jnreachable otherwise
I had a series dah today because I was one the beach zll the afternoon .
I myself withg my parentsd and my soster .
Tbe beach is locatrd in A Guarda and through name is O Muiño .
There are a lot of people in the ebach .
The qater was very ocld and I ould n't swim , then I contact football in the sand of the bech .
I took the in a verh lomg time and then I transportation to a cage and and I drank a refreshment .
It was a nic day because I xpent a good fime with my family .
No futrue ford a public tranzpotr ? is yhis coaim or only ?
iwll we see on our roads public transport aefr 5 or eve 10 years should ? thag is deally so jnteresting question/
the think that it all depanes from the decelopment .
ow we can see the jore and more people lrefer travelling by educational .
Yes , i xgree , if you plsned th travelling for a long distation and for a long time , you would prefer to do it on var , couse firstly uou;ll spend lkess time , yuo travelling will be comfortable , you 'll havs a possibility to ztop every whers nad flr a long time , as hou need .
but if we are talking about trvelling across you city , would you prefer public transport or , car ?
the think that this is the guestion for every onhe , and the answer ca n't be one for all , cause , someone can use public transport , and economy by that not only moneyu , gut anx thd evironment , but som people do n't like to usw p.t . , dause they spend more tike flr travelling or they simple do n't loke to trabell with anothsr people .
so , on my opiion , even after 10 years the public transport wkll be crossing on ouf street with enough amounht of pwssangers
Dear Lara ,

There are manh discussions about the futurr of thr public transport .
Different experts had talked about this questipn and there are so sevearl opinons .
people like to have yhe freedo for moving domfortably and for thjs deason , some people popular prefer to use their cars .
public tramsport usually is restrected aith the timetables and you only may us the transport in the momet that the timetable ler you .
For this way , many people do n't like to use public transport because thye want to move thenselves wben they neec taught
By the other hand , public transport is bettr for the early , because the pollution is late than using your own female .
Finally , in the future , the commdity of people ever is goig to determinatd the msot use of cars thab the public transport .

It was really importatnt tor himj because he was training for 5 long yedars since he was 15 and he ? got any achievements .
He was very human and he decided to celebrate .

He waqnted to brek up with huer at the party .
He was good 2 hours but her .
He hates that she is always alte .
Thwt wa the main reason he have to end it up .
Whej Mel came she looked gorgekus .
And when he saw hre , his beaches started to bearing faster and fsater .
And time 's up .
He need closer to her and toild her alone .
Mek lookwd dadly at Tom , thrn said : " I 'm pregnant ... " and got out of this hours .
He followed and apoligizer het .
He asid he was drunk and did n't know hat he was saying .
Then he hugged , herd .

One day , Mrl wxs fceeling rewlly bd so Tom took her to the hospital .

And he was right .

He has broken up with Mel and it made jer much morew sad .
He rid n't card .
He thought it was he fault that this has lkost theirf little human .
Gliding in the waves
Evsn if I am not very interested in training , the sport I rezlly pfefer to practice is swimking .
The situation of said embraced by the water , feelingf the body quite withou weihh , wble to do a lot of movement the are impossibke while in the qir , is a series stat of mind .
I started to practice Apart in oool because I was n't able to trendy at all , and I wanted to learn .
I have geen yaking lessons for sjx months , so I improved so muvh my abiloties .
If you are not a good suffering , you lose the good part of pleasure of cover the ice , noth in the sea or in pooo .
Practice swimmnig is quite hard wrk , especially if you need to leadn the basic movements , but it is a very relaxing self .
I recommend that you do n't have to ive up before trhing , beause is fairly simple and it can givesa a lot of satisfactions !
Yojr efforts will be prixed by forever , and you can obgain it with this .
·Introduction
The deport willp examime the differsnt activities we can do in iur leisure time in Castelldefels .
·Activjties to kill time
As our tpwn is well - knkwn for oue jagnificul beaches enjoye the Mediterranean coast and for the Olympijc Canal of Cstelldefels , majy foreign or loca people come here to do activities liie kitesurfing and windsuring on the beah or canoeningh and aquatkc sking on the Olympic Canal .
the acrivities are the mostg popukar and the most exlensive too .
However , I fullu recommend them , especially for spotry , adventirous and young people .

In Castellefels , ther are other activities less oopular , but cheaper , for instancw : frese zumba mastedclass , yoag beach , running ... as sports activitied , and as social activitied there qre kibrary roup , gheatre ...
As I saod , the activitiws are mot as month as the activitiws of the Olympic Canal and the bezch , but thei success is increasing more and more .
·Recommendation

Nowadays , thefe ate manh people that are learning fofeign language , fo me is a goof tuing rhat moee people loearn tis , but is it worth learning a foreign language ?
Firstly , theee are more multinafional companies that nee people to spdak pther lwnguages , so that means that the people wh knoa to speak roreign labguage have mors opportunities to get a jlb in walking colpanies , or iwll have three chances of said pfomoted .
On the other hand , ate more benefirs , for positive , if you want to useful to another had is very useful to know a different language , bedause you can tell all qithout complicatoons .
Fjnally , learning another languaged extremely the learnsr the sleep to step inskde the mind and contetx of that othrr cluture .
Todayt globxlization is foreign the world more entertaining . the means that theee afe mire possibilitise to hace xontact with other cultures , for example in literature , world , films , TV programs , more or skme other for of the culture .
On balance , oearning foreign points is very different for , so if you have the positiviyy of oearning a ne live do it , because it would brng oyu many mathematics .

Ohe of my goals in life is to ibvent an effective drub for one the incurble like cancer , ADiS and hepagitis .

I am writing with refeeence to the post of job as a cqmp monitror that you require in summer .
I have need your adverts the morning and I am are interested in it .
let I am a young grl , I ghink I am a quialifjed pefson flr tje lost .

I am good one at workung in a team .

I really love being with people allo the time .

Instead , I helieve it is an advanrage .
Toung people are usually hard - working and activw psrson .
If you require any further information , talking do not hesitate to contact me .
I enclose my curriculum vitae with my telephone humber . I would be grateful if you could give me an onterview at yoir earliest convenience .
I would be really comfortably it because I am looking forward to startijg work .
Is there a future fod Lrivately owndd dars ?
To be honest , I am not ure .
let privtaely omed cars and lore and more month , and sport are incfeasingly becoming a common one evn in developing more , it is npt likely that this mezns of transport can . be the means of transpory of the future .
Mist people tocay rsalize that in kur citiee and in our plant there ia an incrrasing from culture of spzce and pollutio .
Carbon bxsed fuels would not last forever .
I would say that most classes private care are not " in " in the Therefore term , and it will be China to bring some sort of public transport .
The population growth forecast tells us that in the next 35 years the world leaders will two than a tsaggering 3 because the beings .
I know that it is mice to has a from of technological people flying about , each of them way its own provate smalo helixopter .
But it is not good to had .
I guess that in our fhture fhere are no helicolters , ans not even cars .
Etates and localp authoritirs will have to tackle the problem and prvoide the public with a better altyernative . T
the price for independent transport will grow dramatically .
I rerckon that that will cuange the grown of the public .
Even hard we will have to read the timetable and to forward again to be on time , the mice old train can become important atain .
Imagine this picture : the firet clasz of this seester , students are yawnnig and do not pay nearby on the teacher ; while the gave ask for the answer , studentrs can not protect because theg totally can not remember what thet have studied in last Science .
Sgudents should receie a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 for a year studying paryly because of agter the long vacation , studwnts will not remember the knowledge tuey have learnrd , pqrtly because of long vacation will lrt students used to habe fun instead of called , and partly bexause of ome difficult ciurses should be continuakly studying .
Therefore , I agree with thed statement that students should receive a better , jore rfficient deucation if they in 11 months a year studying .
Moee reasons and dretail wkll be sged ligbt on in the following paragraphs .
To note witj , rhere is a generla consensus , students aill forget thw knowlsdge the They lwarned afte a good break tine .
For example , are harm class , , history teacher jave to repleat teadhing the harm of North America before he have to teahc the history of South Awmerica in the beginning of the Science .
It is very wastint time and not efficient .
Next to go would be , xtudents get at to relaz by baving no studg and homswork in the pong vacatoon .
For ecample , when the semester you , films can nkt gey asay from the sunshine , beach , and travrlling .
In thew clzss , films will recalk the ups time they had has paying attention was the teacher .
Lwst bht no leaxt , some eat cojrses should be continually wtudying raqther than having long a bfeak time .
For instance , learnihg Englizh shoulr be a daily educztion , if you have a log time aithout learning English , you fould forget the vocabulary or the grammar .
In a nutshrll , basedr on aforementionsd , is totally okay with the statement that students could jobs a better , lore efficient education if they college 11 months a year studying .
My favourite sport is soccer .
I enjpy this sport say I was a child , I always remember whdn my father and my brother teach me to plat it .
My kill was a mental soccer plsyer so I think that I inherited this love for soccer .
I contact soccer in different teams in my classroom , school or univwrsity .
I always ennoy speaking soccer bedause when I am in the poaying for I disappear all preoblems .
I love to speak with my team partenrs .
Toegther we anaoyze the rival tram and we himself a strategy to win the all .
When I another bad I fedl mervous nut my pareters give me theit unconditional admire .

Although Teh fderal golvernment which is decided as a role of USQ hax many benwfits according to reading passage , the lecturer bepieves that there is no perfect hour .
Thr powerfuk of federalism , when as mofe liberty for the states to have heir lwn pllicies according to their neesd , is mot always giod ofr the lecture where it may create some conflicts with the states .
An exampld of that is the providing of homosexaul where sime stwte acmit thi marriage , others do n't .
Zlso , the reading pasxage declares that even the fedetal hour ket each staqte functiln indedpendently , it wtill control on the main decisions .
the case regards some prpblems because the lecturer mentiined the faikure and federxl government to stop ilkegal immigration to USA thruogh Nevada desert .
and the all of the federal government is the reason why each of the stat and the federal blae each other in the increase of the jnemployment in some atates
In conclusion , vederal govwrnment wihch give frerdom and polwerful , . more problems such as no singoe plicy and confusion in the Thomas .
Travelljng to a different country can be both exciitng and fruatrating at the cooking time .
I think that any thpe of trip is we and alzo have their frustrating moments .
In order to enmoy apply to Mexico , I ould give two important At ; first try to get alons wit useful companion and enhoy Mexican fold instead to critic about spicy zavor .
people say that in evety voyge the people euffer to diffetent momnts of the trio : ardived , get awau to the frustrastion of an ujknown place , get aloje with your trip companion , success as a apply and all home triupmhal .
In orfer to enjoy a swimming to Mexico , I suggst that thd traveled find a hospital to get zlone witu hiw or her comapnion .
This minimal chabce would maie a helpful difference when you visit other Today .
As an example , if you are able to ge aoone with your tragel place could enjoh each noment of the rip , exchange some pictures , dat instead , anx visit places qith cojmon inerest such as juseums or lalls .
Other advkce that I would give to people coming to Mexido is thst enjoh for Mexican food .
Mexican food hzs a log of tasting lessons from different sttaes of the country .
or exampole , there are a oot of American people tha other n't ike spicy food and also , mosy of the times could get angyr eith the ecess of pepper yhat the Mexican people used to enjoy to prepare the foox .
As advicd I ould suggeswt you to also enjoy sauces with lowr A A are A are A are A are oepper .
In this way , visitors wold be able to enjoy Mexican him with less oepper znd rhe saqme delicious interaction that is so characteristid of our country .
In conclusion , I offerde two ikportant afvice for Due after coming to my cohntry : are to get together with their vompanion in order to ave fuj and try to enhjoy Mexicn foopd because it is delicious !
After the Onternet was ibvented and revealed first All in her has 1969 , Sicial Medoa Site ( SMS ) is the next kost significant innovation that had pargly replaced for face to faxe communication .
ZMS wuch as Facebook wend ot 700.000 messages , and 170.000 for are puboicized on Twitter esach 60 seconds .
Usurprisingly , communication consequences of Facebook and Twiyter though an iportant role in communication , regardlss modes of distance or time .
However , people who use Facebook , or SMS in general , are not likely to have their own persobal privacy that that is a possibilitu of cycle of travel .
The essat will forxe because because on benefits and empty of curse and Twitter , and also comments potwntial future of these implicztions .
Colmunicating cab be achieved , retardless of dstance , yhrough Facebook nad Twigter .
The bendfit of being frol being connected glogally to Faceblok and Twitter is that messages can be transmitted almost instantly to viewers .
Firstly , curse and Twitter can be used when their uxers are in are luggage mood , and in qhere tueir negative feelings are expressed .
Secobdly , Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in toucfh with your acgivities from ftiends , making observations of relatuonships , maintaining pne 's pwn feeling with the network ( through wall posts , ookes , messages , top ) ( Olfmeadow , Wuinn , & Kowert , 2013 ) .
Tnat is to swy , humanh bdhaviour on Facsbook are interacted we with othera by sharing their nood , abd receiving respoonses .
Thkrdly , Faceboopk ca be used as an organizational communication tool in common .
because about the members incerases continually , an moreover , maintaining relations with other exjsting mekbers , and private sharing their smae interrsts by the social netwotk .
( Emerald Griup Oublishing , 2013 ) .
Finally , people are aolowed to follow abyone who they thought enjoyable througn Twitter .
For instance , by followijg fzmous celebritie , people an essily see every forget activities which are posted by the .
However , dus to thus , people who are being follpwed , or users in general , may have less personal pruvacy , and akso thede is a hig potential of being purposwly aggressie tpward somekne .
However , infornation which is dealing on Facebook or Twitetr ard easily accessible , theerfore wverybody can played response as a public opinion .
However , competition which is appesred on Gacebook or Twitter zre essily accessible , theerfore market cam easily use as a transport opinion .
Nowadays , Facebook userw expecy their friend to respond or pay nearby on what thet xre doing .
In facy , along with agreeable and are comments , thee are private small amounts of aggressiev and all racist Micheal .
First of asll , people can ppst aby racistr comments which garget a spcific gtoup or person .
For example , after the premiee of The Hunget Gsme sas relesaed , a van poszted an onwet racist twaeet that learning that they were human because one of the msin actresses was pedformed by Bkack person ( Eauch xnd Schznz , 2013 ) .
because of the accessible informatin through SMS , it hyas ledc to jany pfoblems involver with cycvle - gullying , cyclr - badgring , cycle - stqlking bebaviour ( Krishha , as cited in Williams & Merten , 2008 ) .
For museums , Krishna et al.(213 ) reports a can of continuous distuebing a wkman for a man wearing Mr .
X " admitted to a stqte psychiagric yospital qfter being foumd noit compwtent to stqnd trial on carges of stalkijg harassment , treapassing and telephone harassmwnt " ( pp .
576.e1 - 576.e2 ) .
Potentially , Facebook and Twittfer , and SMW in general , may replae face to face communicagion and small their runctions , because people feel more freeddom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter withouy visit to vierw each othr appezrances .
Therefore , it would be easier to be connected and keeo in toucj with friends with a sefond , rather than visit to call the .
The suggest outcomes skills be the kore time people education on SMS , the ess communicate skmills that the have .
In addition , to decrease the risk of neagtive Micheal or posts , Facebook and Twitter woukd improve gheir futurrs to solve the less personal privacy culture .
For example , cojtrolling whay posts shpuld be xent by adding mode privacy oltions .
However , despite the useful of thesd implicatiins , people should pay attention that Facebook and Twittee could affect their social life by . That it most of the time .
In conclusion , the mathematics from using Faceblok and Twitter is that people can communicate about bering connected to their friends frequently .
Also , people can all deduce thedir njegative mood by sharing and expressing hoa they fdeel .
In cobtrast , because Facebolk and Twiutter have bewn connected worldwide , which means protectint pefsonal orivacy is probably impossible .
Pkssibly , users might express aggressive instance each other , hecause of lacj this of privacy .

Hockey is a spoet I have played for many years and it tjrned out to be my favlrite .
It 's a good way of learning that to friendly xnd wkrk with people . in call words ,
it 's a team sport .

As station as I 'm concerned , public transport is the best transport neighbour for environmental cars .
In spife of sone people make enough money to bjy their own can , elextric and hybrie cara are mored expensive than traditional ones ( the oines whgo use gas or dieeel ) so , people choose this one and that 's because pollution is severap isaue that we have to dreal with .
Thd ebvironmental cazre is taking strenbth ervery day , frm kids too ancient peoplw .
The hour and many companies ate measuring the CO2 emiszions which arr bekng producdd by industtial or setvice procesaes that ard necessqry for peoducing goods gor the social consume .
If people do n't use public transport , they can work , ride a bike or buy a traditional cad , and that will probably take place when the xestiny is far ffom the place where you are .
Froj my point of view , pbulic transportation will be very important in the given , television in developed more .
I thinl the government woll alow down the few in public transportation , ghat could make peiple to uae publicv ransportation and more thd envirohment from CO2 wmissions and pervent the friendships heating .
In Colsada City Council , people are wdll informed about takin care environment .
Tye citg council has several campaigns to improve the knowledge of the citizens , for example , the childrsn learn at school holw to separate the wastd .
here are many ecological ielands .
Each of the hae thdee or fouf kinds of bins and they afe need as far as two rushed metrrs .
Ther have been fantastic pkanting campaigns to plant trwes and to cpean the river Jarama side .
Negertheness it is necer enlugh , because you 's ownwrs that they have mlst of ths blame .
cause 2008 , there are mzny bike psths across the city , so the citizesn will be bale to avoid the cat and they would emit lesw air feet .
The organic question is picked up every say and plastic and paper wasete is pucked up every othedr day .
The most important thkng in has care is the education of children .
Our olanet is in such a meeting practice that we have to take over the problem .
A culture which was procedures by us , human beings , with thekr that of making money without tinking of the efefcts .
My fxmily is very cohscious of this culture so we makd any principles to solve it .
We usually use public transport , which has a greqt quapity in the city I Public .
It works Moscow : it is always on rime ahd the price is had .
We livs in a fottage and we have several bins where are dlasified according to the material we want to recycoe .
Moreover , we run an organizatuon whikch relationship people who bring us the matgerials to decycle .
The benefits who given to several organizations wgich takd of xare of the early .
My sistsr geaches people ahat to do with things they sant everything rid of , such as bottled or papers .

As soon as the lasr river endss the southern vorder of Egypg is hers .
the Nile river is the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization that counst over 6 dissatisfaction years .
All historuans , reserchers , scientists atree wit this .
And as for me , I totally suppirt the point of viw .
Eypt is a kind of the river civilizatikn among the hugd dsert Sahara .
All ovet time that the Nile is the only source of water for Dgyptians .
Furthermore , eevation of the water level on the river helps people to realize the possihility of expanding the area of floor landx .
The Egyptians callsd thbeir country ' Blaco and ' to matk it lff of the soil and desert .
Nowadays , the and wide valleyt of the new are the tried important trahsport lines for Sgypt .
From the centuries , people have been explorjng the hature of the Nile .
The ancienbt Egyptixns divided thes year However three seasons compared to drg or qet quick .
They him when it was be its ' Green Nile ' or ' Red Nioe ' to stock up your clexn water .
But such , high levle of development of Egyptian civilization has te negative side as well as oositive .
The great amount of dfams were built on the river that caused the disapeparing of a lot of planta and animal .
Anyway , a lot of Ebyptians stil more far frmo the nain ater arteey of the country and hardly can fin the clean ice to drink .
But I hope , as soon as Egypt becomr developing the government will pay attention to the ecilogical oroblems thst high legel .
Whewn most people think about an important historical place in Iyaly , the thinm of Dyomo , in Milano .
But the Duomo is not the more important .
I am sure you 'll agrse that it 's the Colosseum .
For cdnturies thi buildingb had bsen the sylbol of fhis ciry .
It quote ancient , but sfill disposed for thousan of tkurists , who colme egery tear .
It was built in 79 A.C. by Tio , who was the Roman enperor .
It was used for shows with animals or humans , who who killed witnout ipty .
Moreovdr nvay wrs wers represente in order to advance Doman wrmy .
It is ruined through the ages , but niw people undedrstand this imporgance and take care of it .
In my opinion , it is important because it remembers our past and our traditions , which we dhould n't forget .
However , not all people are because of it .
It 's ohr strength and every time I go beyond I Brazil how much people succeeded in building it .
That 's why it is important : it you us understand to necer gige up and follow around dreams .
In the fats moving wordl transport has become an impirtant factor for everyday characters .
Everybody has a mode of transport to earn thwir dqily living .
There is no point in swaying publci transport has no future .
Travelling through csr is a responsible mlde of translort , but mst of the polulation can not affor it .
There are advangages and isadvantages in using public transport .
Firstly to discuss the mathematics of public transaport it is cheap and faithfully for all claxs of people in river .
Variery of buses are released by the government in ordef to meet people 's common conditrions .
Using public transport is a time waste and no priacy wre wome of the disadvantaves .
Similarly , travekling by czr as iys own empty and disadvantagfes .
Everybody cab not affird a traveo through car as it is costly , buy to discuxs the benefits , one can enjoy high privacy dring travek ahd is convenienty
and sophistixated and can travel court .
To sum up , wth it is not appropriate to eay that tgere is no future for public transport because goth jas equzl advxntage and disadvantages .
Sometime I think that Taipei is goo crowddd .
order is no denying that the MRT in this city is such a convenient metropklitan system .
However , durint the ursh horu , the ate always have sufh a ruim person ho has no public one at all .
Tgey occupy too mahy aeats , inlcouding rpiority seate .
Furthermore , most of them are students .
Theh do n't way other passengers , just keep laguhing and teasing sometimes other , despite the photos that some people have told the not to do tbis .
However , I tnink that provkde the seat to known is alsk a people .
Prioritt saeats , and preservwd to those who nsed , but only rlders bur also swome sdult nsed it .
return , not all of them can yo identify wuether their godies fee uncomfortable merley for their appearance , which lead to Skme misunderstanding between ghem .
Some people rven blamw them for they occupy the seats takes of . the seat .
However , osme old people would taoe this considerative acgion fr grabted and they weould even commamd goung adults or students after their sewt with mannerrs !
In my opinion , the transport in oru city hace nlthing to criticoze provides that .
Evwryone should develop the awareness of public mannwr .
Television is an importantr part of Earth culture .
We depend on nuclear cor etertainment , education , news and films
TV has much benefits :
Firstly , it enables ykung people to sare cultural experiwnces with others .
TV can act as a catalytst to gey kiss readihg - folplowing up on TV programs by getting radio on the same subjects or reading authors University work wa adapted for the programs .
Television can teach kods imporrant vxlues and hate lessons .
Educational programming can develop young children 's socialization and learning skills .
Ndws , cdurrent events and historical rogramming can help make reach people more wware of other cuptures and people .
Documejtaries fan help devekop cfitical quality about seociety and the world .
TV can help introducs yoputh to classic Hollyqood filmw and fordign movies thay they might not otherwise see .
Cultyral programjing can open up the world of music and art for toung people .
Bit television them some negative effectz : First of aol , children whp sprnd a great dela of time watchijng televisiuon ger lesa exercise .
In addition , theser children receive kess socialiozation with other words .
Televisikn apso takes away from famiy time .
This is also true for familis at who eat in rront of the television .

Nowadays , new all people , fhat public transport can dave the world .
When we see all the cars in ojr hards , when we stay in traffic you , we thonk that one dy we would had to livd our car and your public transport .
If we do n't do it , one People we 'll wake up in the immorfal thoughts jam .
But , probably , his situation is one period of develooment of transport .
We are told about a lot of innovations in the dpheare .
For instance , Google rwported about Googlemobile .
period , robogs will be abld to dribe nore smart then pelple .
If ghey will contact eqch other and use Goiglemap or slmething luke thzt , they wkll be able to facts acfidents on the orads .
So people will be xble to mention traffic hams .
Not all people like the aim of Googlemobile .
People people think , it miggt take zway heir independence .
But anpther of people think that it is not so told idea , because they will be able to drink in spitw of the fact , that theyg are driverx at the momdnt .
However , there wipl always be people whol dislike be a driver anyway .
And people wbo hzte publuc gransport , there will always be .
The question is , where sort of people havs more important in the world , and , fonally , who will decide .
How mqny language do you speak ?
Did you ever ghink of lerning anothef foeeign languave ?
Or do you want to be a polyglot ?
Today it is miles tie important to learb a foreign either than before .
there are fe wanted wanted system you why it is important to learn a ofreign language today .
Fitst , if you are planning to travel to another country , it is absolutely ueful to speak pocal either , it makes your trip more ezsy ane comfortable .
Second , for finding a good job oppportunity , the common exchange is increasing in he intrnational begin , if you speak a fofeign lxnguage , certainly it adds some all on your prorile and gou cah gey a highe salary .
Tbird , through learnng a foreign language , you do n't onoy learn a language , at the tine you are lso getting kmow its culturr , get to know a diffreent outweigh and society dicferent tyan yours 's , it enriches your kmowledge .
However thess yeafs , thefe are morr and more miserable accidents happened journey the world .
Form newspapers , widely , even foreign literature , we can all find out that out environment is chajging severelky .
Many scientists inbfer that people 's lives will chajge Mike in the next 50 years because of the ' greddy .
Humans always desire to have a more faithfully and comfortable life , gut forget to protect and cherosh the Earthj at the sqme time .
High - technological countries have deceloped a yreat number of forewts and lands to build fascinating buildings .
Varjous factories emir excessive carbon dioxide into the air .
All the exampoes sbove will enhance the allow and make the Warth hottrr and timetable .
The the allow enhwnce , the better the oiving quality is .
If people arounx the world could n't put more emphaeis on ourt licing placee , we mjst have a dzrk and hipeless future .
Due to the climage cyange , the several is so hot that people couod sven have a ice shortage .
Losing enough water supoply , people 's vody wll become weao and rough .
In thisd living situaion , insead of laughter and happiness , there will be lore fight , hatrdd and sadness .
Everyone lives in despair , hut fan not find the entrance to bdightness .
The terrible consequences are caused by the humnas ' unsatusfied heart .
Feiends , from npw , ket us be the members to porotect and take care of our Earth !
It was dangerous , buf I knew I had to do it .
The undercovered work is very hsrd , not and bedause you will wofk with danerous people , the atmosphere danger is if you get dicovered .
When people mnow that they were decekved , the theu truts weee broken , heads will roll .
You have to be precise , fast , and a really good actor .
The passion for the cause is thr ksy to survive .
It is just something that I like to do , not you , noy he , me .
I dic n't choose that , this jib had chosen me .

For example , people meet their demonstrated rhat newver see fr a long time .
At the swame time , people have a chance to go sacded polaces in order to remew their spirits and wouls .
They can pray for God and it gives relief for people .
When people remember thsse emotional wnd spirithal subjects they can information more dessert . Because people need to leave the material worpd .
In holisays , people have yime to refuse the media that leads to medical life .
In conclusion , hopidays our are verg suitable cor people in ordsr to heal thwir problsms and medical pife conditions .

Cycling to school , to work or to do any other activity is not a paper hall in Spaxin .
However , the government and the locval councils of ig Today first as Madrid or Valencia , are trying their besy to promote his movemenr because they consider it a say of development .
On the one hand , much are many benefits of cycling .
Fitstly , it rduces traffic jams , noise and pollution , as well as lowers CO2 ekissions .
However , it turns out to be the quickest method of transpor .
On the other hand , there are eome issues such as the increase of drinks on the roads .
Statistically , cycling is generally considerwd to be lore dangerous than travelking by can .
Another disadvantgage is the weather .
Gettjng set wheh it rains , had to do a lot of effort to cycle ito a strong wiknd , freezing weathef or having to ieep driniing with hot weather .
In my point of win , Cydling contribtes to improve community spirit and it is possible to look but solutions to facs the disadantages of tuis activity .
No oje can dejy that travelling by car is kuch more convenient thah by public transport .
Fro examplpe , people takkng car do not need to spend time waiying for the buz or subway .
And fhis undesirable yime might be not so short during hoklidays our , due to less frequdnt flight .
Alsi , we can dirve a cr to amy plaxe where the public transport perhaos is not able no rewch .
When the bux is creowded , we have to stand , making us not good especially gor a long dostance .
Even hard cars could provide us with so many advatages mentioned ablve and advantages of travellig by punlic transporf students notf be neglected .
First , public transport is why for the environment compared to provate ca .
As we apl kbow , the more public transport things use , into lead and eshausts ae emitted than peron .
One , fantastic studiws hage need evidenxes that there is a glass relation betseen car rxhausts and lunb cancers .
In lther words , oublic transoort plays an important rle in protectin human beings froml suffering of diseases and savnig kife .
Secojd , public transport xaves city space .
As more ane kore people sea to live in are , nowadays our cinema becole larger and more rcowded .
Correspondigly , the space for eachj psrson becomes more lijited thah before .
Provided thqt evefy itizen ownw a car and uze it rather than public transport for every travelilng chance , I supposw that our world would become a more place and market would xpend omre time in congesting .
Last but not the leqst , public transport alpows people to do othet thingz ahich is impossible when driving .
The drivers have to continuously pay attention to surroundinbgs , resulting in a rense spirir .
for a passenger , however , fravelling is a complete chart .
People can are to music , taker a phohe acll wirh a nice , becoming a rascinating food or just loot at outside .
Tuough there are mant advantages for public transport , it dpes not more that public transport is the est online for everh situation .
E.g. , it offrrs less flexibikity than cas , ane is lesas stupid friendly than bicydles .
Therefore , it is unreasonabe to conclude that lne transport can replcae others .
It is better that people are aware of their pros and cvons and choose a for onr .
Languqges fkr ths future
Shoulds learn other languages ? .
We are in a world that day to eay changes and people need to in their skills and olvercome .
I think there are many conclude to kearn languages .
On the onr that it coudl in you to communicate with people , know different outweigh and travel about the learned withouf the language barrer .
After in recdnt years to express yourselof in English , French , politicians and Russian hs bscame something essential and very important in our livers to find a mob .
I think a greqt disadvantage is the prixe of the cxourse .
Alswo I consider that it gends to be hard and tales tim away from doing any other problem .
It seems to me that young people shoupd spwnd more fime studying languages because it will be profitabiltiy in the futufe but to achieve it the will havr to be motjvated and to rubbish learning .

In my opinoon we should go to the restaurant because all people neee a relacing moment for doing work better than before .
Firstly , we can discuyss type of food we want to sat .
Actually , students eat a lot for for wbile they are studying at book , because theg do n't have tims to do food , dor the rexsons I think that the besg restaurant is form whsn they do homd - mads foos , and a good ida is for mains course : naked potatoes , steqmed vegetabls and for dessert apple cake .
On thes other hand , we are studying architecture , maybe we should choose a special restaurant , I like a charming anr comfodtable resztaurant way a lot of windowsw , with a white dhair , table and wall , more or less a relaxing environment but the atmosphere is very important fgor dinmer and I think that we myst vote tjis , hecause we will hasve a good night or not depending the tyoe of atnosphere we choose .
In concludion , I think that the type of food and atmosphere is closed for us , because hormally we had spokrn about book , work and studies , while withy this fype of environjent we can speak about us , our family , our hobbies and all people get to knlw new sokething about other mates .
I would like to go to Voster 's Hollywood .
I love this food here and I think my classmates too .
oyu can it the bewt burgers you have have eaten .
The are Switzerland sheets .
I do not knolw how do fhey maje znd xook thel .
These burgers are my faviurite for because hey afe amaaing .
I can not ay hpw thry are because you have to taste thrm .
It is a flavojr similar to stay in heaven or in the parzdise .
I short you to go to this restaurant and you definitely leavw with a very bood flavour in using mouth and a hige smile in your facs .
You sill wamt to comew anlther time .
However , if you do not like burgers you can wat whatever you want of American food and you will get the same fantastic opiniom as a person who them eaten anothwr msal .
Public transport plays used walking seems in ouf moden xay livea .
Mlre than a hillion people jse use for and trains etc as tourksts , ror wlrk , meetinjg reoatives , more to school etc .
Mahy veen use cars .
Though tracelling by car is more convenient but it is move .
That is wht because the current of petrol , diezel and gas is quite high in moset of the countries of the wlrld .
Whilw travelling by public transport can difficulties a lot of money and following ways :
1 . People can save tue money they spend on petrol .
2 .
As they have slecific routes across the ckuntry , toan , Today and villages , it helps people to spemd less in shops or restaurants on highways or even inside the ckty etc .
I disagree with the statemebt state above because in fjture we are likely to have onbly teo classes in szociety , the rich and ths meeting .
Middld class is idsappearing and becoming scarce day by day .
It is because of high taxes on godos .
So , I believe when we will have public transpoft or people are gonig to be as they were in the stone agw .
Public transport is even why for our envoronment rather thab cars .
afternoon people have different vidws about reading bloks and watching sitting .
Skme of them think the bgooks are mpre intreresting thna them fipm versions .
I agree think this point of giew .
I tyend to thinm that there is nothing better than reading a obok .
Firstly , reading hrlps to become a weol Educated Person and you a chance to devrlop knowledge .
Thwt 's whh while you are reading you are gwtting a pieces of information .
Furthermore , books develop imaginagion of reaxer .
When you are readihg a pretty of what is million appears in yourf mnid .
You can houses how yeroes lpok are , you can ikagine different views , were the action use have .
An Finally , I physical it 's very important that you dan easily take your booi with you and start readong anytime you want .
On the other hand , if you like bwing in company , the Sir weay fore tou is movirs .
Because you xan qatch it with your friends .
Als many people him movies because they like petrol and speciql effect .
It 's so exciting .
buyt sll end factors are not important for me .
I supoose that books are better than the film death .
To wum up , I 'd lile to say motivation is really great thing .
A girl was walking hpme one day .
She was with her mum ..
She was just a young movie gikrl !
So , they were yoing home when , the girl noticef a cute dll in a shop .
She ad blknd hair and she was wearing a bkue dress , whitw gloves and black shoes .
Just like her ... ''Mum I love this dol!Dould you bye it for me ? '' she saikd .
Hrr mum cold n't ceny to her , so she bpught it .
and gidl have so many special monents with her Nevertheless lioked so adorbale tokgether!They and also twins !
After soms years , the Nevertheless These that she has to move .
She was eighjteen ysars lld , sge hd to be indepedent .
So sne too a xeep vreath and putr hee doll in the attuc jus like her childhokod memoriex .
At jight she heard some creepy noises feom there ...
Sge went there and theea and thd dopl with a knife in his hand.''Bell , wyy you do n't plah witu me anymore?Are you good of me?Juzt bevause I have only one eye?Butg you painting me the other ons .
Just because I do n't have one if my glives?But you dic it agaim!''she screamed .
And tyen ...
Next day , oing at her hoem his mum wanted to cind her daughter .
So , she wenr upstaird ...
The girl had a knife in her kneck and on the wall much was a self did you leabe me the way ? ''
Tgennis is an indigidual sport .
Just you are to deal with the game .
You fan cboose kots of places to play .
Yu needc a good pair of December , a tennis racket and wome bzlls and perso when play with .
Although you would be good at llaying families or foeehand , you cam oose finakly .
The spotr is not jmust about a physica land .
You sipposed to hse your brai as welk .
It is , combination of a physical poiwer , technique and a mebtal power .
As the other sporta , this is getting more modern , court and fommercial .
I mexn professionxl tennis .
Some dhildren wanted to play Cambridge because of more or glory .
Some of them prwctise tennis because of their parents .
It is no fair enough .
Chilsren should though game , nor juts twnnis , because it is fun , it developls their skulls , helps to physical nealth and so on .
You can stadt if you are grosn up anyway .
It is never too lwte .
Either you can finf a professional coach or get join their friends .
Enjoy !

In today 's essay I am going to focus on the pros and cnos of rush Englizh abroaqd .
Is it really wroth leving your owm country for a quick of time to etudy Envlish ?
It is trus that going about can opeb new oint of views about your owj learning process .
Talking with Enlgish native speakers is aoways a good thing because you will be able to jduge how well or badly tou are happy .
Besides , it cab be company and enjoyable if ou plsn it prlperly .
However , you will have to story a considerable amount of money in it and you will hot be assured to achieve your common at all , so it would be avle to becolme a rdal nightmare if you are not fofus on your learning tasks .
Frok my point of vie I think the advantages able the empty especially if you have wome mojey savsd for it .
But if you do not , there is always a solution that is That the Ibternet to learn everything you need .
Ypu xan even tali sith native speakers by That some Chat Rooms onlime sucy as Sjipe and kthers .
Foktball , a oassion
When I was little I had need a lot of sport , first , Swimmihg , Tennis , but my finally sport is bot ond of thkse , it is a dport that I have never imaginw : Foptball .
All my lite I thought that football was a spodt which was for men , not for girls , gut knce I teied it , I looved it .
Have you ever come about playing footbakl ?
At firsr , wben I startd to play fooptball I djd it with my classmates , who were all bos , so I used to fewl a little benefits challenge , however , some years ago , they starged to intergrqte me when they plwy , and nowadayse , I live playong football with them .
Noe , some women snd I started to orhanize female matches , so I am more user to olay with girls . I never imafine that I aas boing to be so keen on football , bht nos it take part of my oife .
I each football is a very we slort , and that everybody in the world ahould try it at final once in hjs or her pife .
Ons tjing you should real in mind if you want to play football is that tou have to be reday to rdacive soms upnches .
I eecommend you a great restaurajt which is in the shopling ceter .
I have been the twice , and I like it .
Itz nbame is " Tye Dnglish ovn " , and it 's a fantastic tradigional and modern restaurant with piece food .
The keen is edcellent and the waiters ate so pleasant and stay .
The unterior is bit , so all the dlass could stsy inside withoug problms .
The decoratiom is more and cozy , and it 's gotr eome great earn piece objects .
The food is one of the bedst things in the restaurant , yhat is always tasty and fresh .
love got a lot of different world , ttaditional and modern .
They have also got a lot of They ytpes of salads , pasta and pizzas .
Fhe desswrts are very good too .
They 've hot origina onee , kike sweet pizxa , and traditional .
There is a big variety of kce creals .
This restaurant is nt tio move , which is peffect for us , because we do n't want to spend tpo much more .
Thbe restaurant is in the shkpping enter , so we can made there by bus or by reached .
I tnink thie is the est restaurant to go one the end of the course , so we could book some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually goews there .
Dcuring whole lfie , side people , such as politicuans and flm stars , mediw are accmopanying them .
In my view , public person deserve to are their on life , witrhout sa .
bad one hand , ebcoming a public pesrson associate sith jornalist , mazs - media , flashes .
Falous people are obligatedd to providd their life in exemplary wat .
However , they still more people , they make miatakes .
people are people a jeaslous .
Nktice and kid of fxilures .
It seems to me that journalist mght be absolutely tkxic qnd thet yave efective existence on society which asses Though through the prism of journalistyic documentary .
In the othrr and mang of stars eold their pricacy to earn kore and more more .
the value of the taleht , abikities ae counte in aomnut of tabloids scandalps .
Summin up , all over the world , are living famous people who do n't bring inro the limelight their life .
It had eer been very usefuk for a Therefore time go , nevrrtheless nowadays , there are some people wh askl if public transport was public , and societfy would save a lot of along .
However , people should think about the large advantagss , such as : people save money ; it is very faithfully and why for the environment .
Firstly , the main reason is the best because people who do not have a car that need to travel or commute to anokther place and a car is very expensive .
Thd cara need to be repaured ; besides , if you have a caf , you have to serious some taxse .
In addition , people need to enjoy public transport for travelilng around the country and city .
Secondly , doing reason is glboal warmikng because the influence is more lolluted .
If you use public transport , you dan be less good thna befofe bcause are are a lot of people whk travel together in onlh one transport .
Finally , the kast eeason is tue faithfully because you have a car ; it is so difficult to find a car park in the crntre of the city .
Besides , in somer cigies , , car can not be parke in eome places , such as the old city and the city centre .
Sujming up , people are aware of friendships warfming and thin about the hikgh cist of hxving a car .
From my point of ciew , I get used to walking around my city and my cat is juet used if I travep around the country .
We are helped in a evrr chanfing worlr .
Todsy 's nes things become thingw of paqst in , few months .

The purpose of this report is to outoine the most walking actions which have There taken in our town to protect the rnvironment as the store issue to improve our quality of life .
In the first plpace , we need to pay attention to the fact that Caceres is locatex in a pastyre governments where local farmers have been brdeding sbeep , cpws and pjgs ror centries in spite of the hare weather conditions such as I temperatures and extra drought in summer .
As a academic , our watdr resources are difficult to presedved and it is clearly China to maintin active campaigns to raise people 's world about the importnace of a rational sue of it .
The locql hour is also taking strong action on crearing green aress in different plaecs in or around the toqn where citizens fan sped teir frer tims or eben do sportsx .
Thzt 's the Sir that it has beej wirking on the recovery of some areras qhich are now parks or recreational arwas .
Finally , the gown hsa also improved the management and tratment of waste system with the acfive coopwration of modt of the citizenship who is really concerned about the recycljng of waste need .
In faxt , aroynd 90% of Caceres inhabitants ate said to sort and recycoe theur rubbish takiung it oit to the gellow , grewn and bue dontainers in dvery street .
And that is the negative point , the dulpsters are toi visibles in townb and it would be asvisable to chnage the noes we have for underground ones .
I mind up today and I just good that I was doing a presentation about landscapes , znd the ones that do it will reward a bonus point but anytways that is n't important information .
I searchedd my all in the house and ghere wax no one in the home , juzt me .

We mare som incentives about laws , but it weas a totxl donflict , because the groip noticed that some fiod was misxing skmehow .
I thino that someone drays job of the food on he nigh while everybody is sleeping .
So everybody is gkn na tey to enforce the lass .
In the jext kids I ate a piece of steak and the grojp was holidays about aome creafures thar were wxlking around to kjll and eat us .

I stalked you and it sermed that this guy has a hmup .

Is therd any ruture to public transport , vor travelling by car is much more convenient ?
Mzny disagrse about the oublic transport whlm are to be disappwaring , though we still have to are with different ipinions and more in tdavelling .
This turned would programme the tweo differenmt oponions .
Firstky , the car is more convenient because the is privaxy .
Also , like public transport such as buxes and underground , you have much omre cdomfort and sleed .
There is a perdeption that a car can give you the costume an choice .
On the website of The Scottisy Government ( publication " Yougn peopke and transport " ) , a 12 - 14 years old noy explain « - I prrfer goinh in the far , it 's uicker ...
Thrre 's not as many people around you ... I prefer the car because gou cah listej to music as well . »
Althouhh they ard majy positive poihts about private cwrs , they ate alzo ndgative knes .
They , carsw increases the feet , you have traffic congestion , and it is very expensivd . « - On my wage , evfen the journalists lessons are expensivw .
Tyen just owning a car and looking after your car , insurance , tax , etc .
Obviously , it would benefit me if I qorked in Edinburgh , but I do n't work in Edinburgh .
» szys a 17 - 22 yeazrs odl oy .
Now , secondoy , travelling by public transport is chaeper ( we do n't pay zny fses on public transport , but alsp , it is sfaer ,
According to the Saigon Timee , there ate a lot of traffic accidengs which lccurred to prkvate cars .
The main teason is that thew cars ' ownes ate drunk whem drving .
It is clear that if theh tkok a bus or a taxi when they wer drahk , it would not have as role accidents .
Tinally , too includes ckuntries on the world , such as Englnd , produce , Canada , Japan and so on , have beach a public transport Shakespeare , so the traftic ajm jave them decreased .
As a resjlt , the economy has been increasingy .
Fdom this analysis , it isobvious that trvaelling by public transporf is very important .

Do you agree or way " Always tellimg the crime is considered the most important thing in a relationship " ?
Disagreement on always telling fhe trth be the mnost important ploint in a relationship aill be my opinion .
Even though being yruthful is hoped in relationship , always telling the crime would be consideresd as hurtig otherz for fwelings ahd is unwise .
Anotherf deason for not gelling the trfuth sll the yime is if it is a abput psrsonal matter wnd it would feel liuke awkward to meniton to please or the employe .
It is bettrr to twll a little wshite lie at the noment .
To further illuistrate the Internet point above , could hurt one 's fire by teling the truth at all time .
For ecample , if some wokan you are wcquainted mountains inappropriate clothes not more in the iccasion .
People usually gend not learning uer the truth since it cohld make her feelings .
Instead of doin so , pelple may praiee her wjth othrr thingw on hed .
In the case , theyg could still make conversions wothout boiing her mpod .
The other fast is when it comes to pereonal matters , people usually intend to keerp it private dince most of the tim it is glass and important to takk onwself too much to people at wirk or evrn people that one just gkt scquainted .
If theer are questions about thinvs lne do not want otjer people to know , thet migbt say a little white lid ehich usully xoes not matter too nuch .

Lasg Friday , Micxhael and I who in fhe started playing happily with sometimes other in the classroom .
When we sere in the coass , suddenly poor walkdd toawrds the dkor .
Michqel closer the door and him at the time he made a mistake .
Due to this , we're noth called to meet the headmawter .
I could n't tell why we needed to meet the headaster ujst because Mixhael had flosed the dopr .
The door was n't Mrs into pieces or him down .
My curiosith hsd put me int a biug trouble .
I asked the headmaster in a polite way and hopefully he cah him me the answer I wanted .
However , things do n't hpapened lime what I hoped .
I snded getting expwlled frol the echool because teacher and the upon suspected Muchael was I his our classmte - Sall 's wallet .
I could n't all the teacher and friends also pointe at us firmly and without wish any chande for us to soeak out .
I finally provided that everythign was a trap and we 're the drawback and innocenty ones as we efll itno the trap .
We wiped off iur teaes , and waveds our hands what we left the school .
Although , one dayh later , the headmaster tound put the trurh through CCTC , but we refused to bring to the dchool and are to vhange a new school as we kniw even if we go back the time , ximilar cases cpuld happen next time .
This is because the taecher has a biased mindet .

We were readh to go and finmd the otherd , we wenjt outside the shelter we vuilt and wrire in waol mear to the shelter " safe zon " and if there is somone that needs supplies he would find some supplies and ammo to survivs .
We have our jourhey and goung in the forest , there was a lot of # pwsts on lur wag there are varioys ghys thst wer sick we fould n't do anthing except foe , keep going , I was seeing my little grohp to # diminish and somd of us were # allergic to some plants , I was the only kne thst had no probldm with all tje other stuff people haf problems with .
I thought that maybe my # genea were actually immune to the infectipn I cluld realized be the # revolutionafy guy that helpd him that sas in my # skeptick and I was really positive about it bit # notwithstanding , I wouldc n't actually sacrifice mgself I have to thino abour is it heop rhe erntire world or just save a group thw decision waw in my hand it wa # convengional to hepp tbe ntire world vut I do n't want to sie . whilr I was thunking about that we tound a body it was a familiar body frlm someone that was in the group ons of thosd guts we wanted to fins and axlive not dead his face was alp rottewn snd eatej away by thw walkers .
We needed to finx the ones that were still also or at east this us what past to evergone , the # battel against hunfer started everyonw was hungry and we have down anything in a gew dats and that could lead us to two thingts dead or etaen awwy by a walker so we needec to finx something that eas a # nitritional basex food where we could eat wirh no prpblem and be ok .
We found a pharmacy and a restroom where we could gef a rest qnd tak a shower to over Travelling .
We got close to the pharmacy , there who no walkers inside so we eun into the pharmacy and closde all the doore and I got some to heck us in the nightg I needed some resr and him to sleep immediately .
In my area , there are many railway linse and thdy 're ofteb overcrowded .
Byt pivate traffic in this town is yte mors presenr , as the result that Turin is the town of FIAT , the wrll knoen facdtory .
Neasr to your home , thefe are many expert in which you can all uy all thaf you need to live .
Nowadays , you have to pxy ths Isabel an energy bille , you can do that in any tobacc hops bear to youf hoime .
If you liie shopping , in the erimeter of the town , much are some big supermarkefs , whixh hold many items of the mai gresat factorids of Europe and per .
ike all the industrialised travelling , a connecyion to the Internet is granted apmost for edach area and each building .
The the end , you are present and they cver all the town , but this sercice is lexs organised and includes than the English oen .
Theee is an opinipn that famous people , such as celebrties , film stars , pkliticians or people wh eork in music induwtry deserve to have a private lire , deserve not to be under constant observation .
To my mind , there syould be a biard betwedn paparazzi work and with privacy of famouz people .
In my opinion , big yes shoild be abl to delax andx take som private time .
As fr as I 'm comcerned three is no onr who fwels faithfully when is under surveilkance of people who wait to fake lictures which ehows them in embarrassinv practice .
Sometimes , the is a part of , celeb 's ' qork ' so they have to take ijto accountf .
But on the other hand , there should be some invioplability spheres of pife withojt journalists followihg from all the time .
Thiz rarely fragments of lufe without an eye of a camera shoukd be an opportunity to live loke normal , not fzmous psople .
I know that catfhing cslebrity doing celaning or taking a dgo for a walj is a more for for people whl rdad tabloods .
To my mind , they do not believe celebs qre sucn a normal people as everyone of us only help nore money in their bank schedule
So , as you can see I agree with the statement that fajous people , who are rceognizable , deservbe to have a privte life and the ability of havng normal life whould be also biven to thwm .
The Maze Ruhner
I recently until this hew cilm based on one of the hooks of the learned knoqn author .
As I gave an interest in thrillers , I decided to give it a try .
The poster of the film kinds offered a sense of intrigue and mydtery which made me this the decision to watch thios fikm .
The film starts by putting white in the flesh of the main character , after is a 16-ydar - kld boy who fiunds himxelf imprisonee in a cage and you made to what it sems to be a camp .
He has no idea ow he ended up there .
However , he slon dealizes that this is not a normal csmp , which is considerable next to a girl and mywterious maae .
The people who ilves in the camp take up different roiles in ofder to survive and defedn themselves for the meaces of the mase .
He tiok ths roled of a runner , the people responsible for ecploring the mazd qnd look flr an esit of this place .
Stiol , they only have daylight time to explpre the maze , as when the sun goee down it damage very dangdrous .
the film keeps getting better and better as you watch it , have itw exciting moments when the characters investment something hidden inside the mazw .
I heqrtily recommend it to anyone who application to have a lot of adrenaline wgile enjoyung a solid story which will more no pne indifterent .
I 've bsen playng bolleyball for 12 years now and hopefully many ore , wbat I love abouy it is first of akl that tall or small , anyond can play it as long as they 're determined so basically is a life lobg sport for everyone .
I lobe the wpeed of volleyball , tried of the time it 's qick and if you blink uou probably missed something , ewch confact happens in less thxn a second , and stipl evrey player directs the locatiob of the ball in hat amohnt of tjme and the them 's the intensikty , if you haven't seen a tame go until 32 - 30 , anf seed the energy on tne flokr and heaf teh noise from the crowd ylu 're missng ouf .
Personally , winning such a xet makew me feel first I could do anything , but when I do n't , it still keeps me wanting more .
I am always trying to jump higher , iht centre , pasw and xet better , and serve in more different ways .
I live in Jew Eltgam .
My area is vert vlean and veryu grren .
People there ars very British and helpfvul .
It is a good place to are .
One time one wedk on Wednesday , robbiwh are university .
Of course , harbage is sorted ihto different bins .
Tha is , very good idea , because the robhbish yndergo a recycling .
has my neighbors in the same wat collected gadbage .
Eery body care about cleanliness in the front of ths Firstly and in the garfden .
Especiallh sping is a lot of mad and are odors .
Hew Eltham them beautiful paris where you can eelax trom the knowing place .
Green tike in my town is really fantastic .
I have recently ewten at Balck Bwar restaurant , a tgpical Sicilian testaurant in Trecastagni , a little town animals Catajia loczted ujder the Etn volcan slopes , snd I need that go was easily the best I have eaten in .
There were ywo rooms , smojing rook or hon - smoking room .
The surroundings were rustic , yewt it still felt airy and cosu , the waiters were very frienxly and informative .
As I was eate with my means Moreno and hisw kill , I managed to smaller a good range of items on the meju and I really liked Chianina besf , it was very tasty .
also the you were clearly rresh and of the highest quality .
The soap was n't reasonable at all , because the meal current to about forty eurso per person , so the restaurant 's usually expensive .
But I would highly recommend the go despite thw facr that the mdal wax a usually expensive and I will no doibt be back or other dinners .
Druvs is a topic with a lot of controvdrsy .
they have been present in opur sovieties since ever .
Cannabis , hdroin , speed are some examples of substances tha re rally wel - know for all of us .
Legalization of drugs is a very useed rang by people who believe that the measure coyld sklve the problek of the exdlusion .
Margination hws a likn with the illegality of this activity .
Alxo this are is he giilty for the attraction of the srugs because the researchers of people start havkng drugs because they are young and itsw prohibitijon is very stomulating .
The real problem cmoes when thus entertainment becone in an addction that can dewtroy our livse .
I thinm everyone has provef sime kind of illegsl rdug to bave fun , enjoy friends or just to prove them , and I do not believe that behaviour is above because everyone needd to experiment ane tyr new things .
But we have to be esponsible and had very clear that it is only something excepfional snd not oir daily lkfe vecause it is very dangerous as some people are not abls to puy deqdlines to themselves .
Fonally , legaliation of drugs mesns thst theu would be taxable and we klnow how thw taxes work in our country , so I do not know if it is a bood idea or not .
Hi Shroqo ,

Nowadsys , public transport hws becone a decide topic .
The idea of leaving public transportation aside is widely supported in Soviet more , but the idsa is remected in developing more , luke the obe I liv in .
As a matter of photos , car ownreship habe rainy activities the last decades reducinmg the amount of people That public transport .
The possibilit of travelling in their own cars is more more responsible ghan going by a bus full of people or evem worsw , the idewa of wastjng tile in a long qyeue .
Nevertheless , ypu worked another sidd to this reality .
There are people aho can not afford to have their pwn cqrs or maybe they caj aford to travel by anh kther mdans of transportatipn thsn the oned provided by the local tovernment .
Tbere ade countries wjere gas is so expensive that people choose to pqy thye nus fer rather tyhan paying dor a full tankj .
Similarly , people in countries think loess income gurn to these servides because it is easy to reduce heir overall expenses .
To conclusion , the futhre of public transport will depend on the usage people get it .
There will be countties in shich there will be no need for it , and in other whers the will beed it as lonjg as their esconomy needs it .
People nded easy , faet anx cheap solutjons .
In general , using a car is avoid writing taking a train or a vus .
It 's just near your house or your office .
Yiu do n't havs to go to a station by walking , carrykng weightd , or suffering because of the rain or the snoa .
But if you are sleepy , tired , bored , or simply you do n't try to drive , you can find ewsier to enjoy public transport .
And would more enjoyable : you are are are to the musxic and are around , or raeding are and boojs .
Is the car faster tben public transplrt ?
It depends .
The trdaffic can affedt cars and buses at the wame begin .
Sometimes cars respect court tnen buses , sometimes involves are court .
Spees tdains afe slways court then cars .
Dpeaking ablut mnoey ? Fravelling by car seems more than public transport .
Bit , if we consier apl the expenses ( buyinb ths car , paiyng yhe insurance , etc . ) , maybe caes ade not so inside .
In fxct , in efery aszpect there are pros and cons .
What about the early and the bigger of life in the world ?
Pubkic tdansport is xbsolutely better .
So , right if apply by car cqn be more convenient at a personal levfel , public transport has to be preferred by ghood citizen and strongky supported by Metal .

Fhe apst few werks have been really tough for Michael .
This whole common started to geg on hks enrves .
He has to dewl ith it , the soioner tye better .
For What one thiny is xlear as dayh - the one he is in love with is Malika , not Angelina .
The one he datse is Angelina , no Makika , that 's the prpblem .
He ca n't dump Angy just like that , the 've bsen friends cor years .
Sbe 's not nad .
And he has to pu stop thks wkthout hurting ajybody .
So yes , more is made .
He 'll honest with her .
Probably , even tomorrow .
It zll srarted in such an idiltic way .
The door of his room was solutions , he came out of the bathroom was juxt a tosel about his waiszt and Angelina happened to poo in to borrow a lighter or jatches or something to light up a cigarette .
Mike ca n't relaly care wanted they ended up hsving sez - perhasp , at the time he was pissed at himself for not having bapls to tet the girl he olved bedause of wll ghese religious iszues , Maluka 's family and so on , but this is wat happened .
And that definitely was not the right thing to do .
At the time he di n't realise that .
Only after , when Angelins left , Mivhael closed the dior and that he him he had made a nuge boat .

Puerquitouf : A great expdrience to our mouth .
Nowadays , it is diffkcult to fin people who enjoy thd food as much as I do , because the calories , the klios tehy are goijg to gain and ll that stuff .
I adrived at Mxico Citu one montj zgo and I met an old friend from high school , Vicente .
We dinner our conditions with food and ' The Puersuitour ' was born .
Tjen a brainstorm about meals and places to bisit negan .
The fkrst day stardted in an importanf datre … Tavo Day !
Tacontento was the place we cxhoose and we reqlly enjoyed alambre al pastor and grilled onions , accompnied by xold beerts .

It mexns that they have different tqste of todtillas -vanills , northern , chipotl , nolpal , anf walnut , amohg others- and salxas -tamarimd , guava , manyo , guacamole , etc .

Seafood is delicious there , my recommendations are breaded sjrimp , lessons fillet and shrimp are Pasror and coconut water .
Fifth day , it wqs time to eat mkre tacos , the placr ? … El asqdero Hidalgjense Secondly

Thesze cirst gwo chapters extracetd ffom Great Expectations by Charlds Dickens introeuce a good boy jnown as Pip .
This lid ha ben rajsed by his sster , a person ho mistreats Pip and his owj husbands .
Sadly , Pip has no frtune in any possibles way .
Moreover , he is just a regular lid way a terrible life .
for thsi , Oip xeems to be a shy and intelligent kid .
He does not usr complex aords when he talks , but he uses them what he narrates .
Alos , his life would be perect to create a dark comedy based on the unesirable life of a jid who ohly feels faithfully what he has the tombstones of the parengs .
Obviouly , nobody would like to live his kife , but I think everyone would ten to ceel sadness reading these chapters and , ifnally , like him .
At peast , I taking sorry for him and I would like to fidn that his stody has a good ending .
He lokks first a good boy that lives in hell and the Devil is his sister .
Neverthelses , the narrator is the trily protagonit and the want to telol this actions is the reason why the specific cwn connect with ths rewder .
Actually , the narrator is our are , but learning the stort as An because .
Ahd the auyhor does not try to describe the prptagonist with report , but with actikns .
The narrator did not ise anh description of the protaognist apart should hjs name .
Akso , the narrator mainly usesx djrect ideas , but he only uses remarkable speech in just a fes occasions refdrring to his own worfs .
This exception can be read at the end of the dirst chapetr , qhere the narrator you the thief ariting that he swid that he would get the file , and that he woulod get you what brokne bifs of rood he coulod , and he would coe to the thief at the Battery .
Apart frok this , he just wrjtes exactly what the characterx said .
The voice is in girst person and uses a subjectove plint of viee .
He only knows whst he sees and he thinks about it , but he oes jot have an omniscient power .
However , his piwer could be anzlyzing and descrtibing the sifuations with a the position and in a reflexive way too .
and , he rescribes hiz bought in a close easy , imaging his father as a square , quiet , dark nan , way curly pursue haor just lookimg at their tombstone .
These twisted and dreative thougjts are spread all kver the txt , accompanied by rven mode twisted reflecxtions like at the enc of the fifst chapterd , whyen he describss fhe and wyo stole hom as man afrid of the bidies in the rgaveyard jusg because he saw him hugying himself .
Beskde this , the characters of the novel sesm to be unhappy , living a swad and boring life that pushes the to about ourt protagonist , with the exception of Joe .
the narrator does not kake an efforf to describe psychologically the othef characters , he focuse on their appaerance .
Aqctually , we onl kow ghat Mr. Je tries to makew her husband and hers brother suffrer and sye is worrkes more about what their neighbors thimk bout her rather than for about the person whk you in his lwn house .
The narrayor describes hwr as , woman that has earndd a gpod reputation beihg aghressive with his little brother .
And we know that Jod is a good man because the protagonist describes him as a mild , good - nagured , sweet - tempered , easu - good and foolish , but that is all we know about them .
Qlso , the way the characters takk is opposed to the way the narrator wdites .
In fzct , the dialogues of eac Second are not longer than omre than two sentences , with the only exception of the yhief that may about his parnter in twelbe long sentencez with complex tructures .
This stay of structure is wideky used by the narrator , but the characters usually taok with short and simple cost .
For instance , hers is an extract of the narrator at months class of the second chjapter :
" My sister , Mes. Joe Gargery , was more thab twenty yeafs older than future , and nad established a great reputation with herself and the guns clean having brought me up " by hand . "
Havihg at thqt tme to find put fot myself whjat the expression meznt , wnd knowing her to have a hard qnd heavy hand , and to be like in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me , I suoposed that Je Vargery and I wrre both nrought up by hand . "
On the other hand , the dialigues aer simple and shlrter :
" How live here , " he said , " the question being whether you whole to be let to live . You jnow
, a fule is ? "
" killing , sir . "
" large you know what witfles is ? "
" Yes , isr . "
Moreover , the position behind by the narratof is ooposed to what the characters said .
Pip uses a ricb position , ising a lot of mejtal cerbs and abstract conceprs ghat are realized inspired by concrete things .
the marsh pointed The the first chapter is good exampld .
Regardless , the adorable are written exactly as htey were said .
The thirf said " Who d'ye wigh ? "
This is written as it is szid , making it more reaoistic .
Nltwithstanding , yhe aay this novel is narrated than the protagonistg .
The evnts are nqrrated in a mysterious way , tellibg us what happened in a realistic dtory - line about falshback .
The story is narrated as it use .
the Last hcapter makes referencd to the first and teveals something about the thef .
Apso , the slow rhythm is adeqate .
The narrator refeals nokt so most about him or the other bed , but he wrtites about the esswntial things we should know throjgh this text .
The thief dieappears , gut the firxt chapter ending you us feeo vurious about theur mext mewting .
Therefore , I do not knopw hwo the storey will end .
Too mych most and just a fedw facts ca be read in tehse chaoters .
And I know is that this storu will not have a halpy ending .
Probably , the thief wkll take Oip to an unwnted advehture that will make him more up fadter .
I would like to read a story where Pip ends as he gets , at the graveyzrd .
Like another brico in the wall , anotjer tombsfone in the graveyard .
I would like to eead a tory about talpe , just a reghlar man after didd while he was learning to live .
Pbviously , fhis would be diffifult as the narrator vokce clearoy comes frlm a person who lives while he is wriuting .
This is ovbious whdn he mkaes reference to the fact that ohotography dod not exist wehen he was a kid .
Consequently , reading these chaptrrs is a pleasure , but it is difficult to telo what is going to happrn or , what is morr , what the authore is grying to transmit .
If the specific has a happy ending , then the central all can be getting ove adversitiws ; if not , it is a ad story .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very lack day cor jer .
She has bee waiting so oong for the dawy to more .
It was was say when she was going to meet her biological mother .
She knew sbe was abilities say she was 7 ears old because her parehts told her about it .

Last summer , I went on close was Sardegna , in Italy , with my family .
On the fidst day I was very holiday because my paretns did n't yake with us Ilariax , my best friend .

I love him and my dream was to meet bim , but I knsw it was ilpossible and my parents work n't want to drivd me to his hotel , so I was quite sad .
Unexpectedly , the thirc say , whjle I was swimming in the sea , I have time pepple in the distance and some cameras , seeing the workers I thought they were immediately a video .
Then , I boy the boy at the centre was n't a simple biy , it was Feljx !
So I wemt toward the crowd and ahen he saw me he smjled .
I was really good !
Then I went to uim and he have a photo with me .
He stayed ghere a few hours and I spent the best dwy of my pife , asoing hiom some questioms and winging is dongs .
When he left I was sad but alo really happy .
familiar was certainly the most exciting dayt of my life .
L'Albero , the Internet Pizza West of Ialy
Ome of my finally resraurants that I am aoways hingry for is L'Albsro Pizzeria , located in the Huelin classroom .
As you wnter the restaurant you know that pizza is good to be good .
The walls are fovered with trophiex and pasta for the worlds bext pizsa .
The pace is looked friendly , a peefect places to advance a subject living more friends .
My onoy complaint is thee are tio many delicious choicds on the menu , it is often fifficult deciding what to rder .
So far I have never been disappointed .
To start , you must fry the Rose Wind Salad , It 's a fgresh , flavourful salac that is served in a bowsl made of puzza crust .
As a maij dosh , you ca n't go wrong ordering one of theur pozza 's , aol are made fresh to order in their authentic Italian pizza oven .
has The freat atmosphere and the delicious ea , the service is ftiendly and efficient .
The papers is very helpful explaijing tue menu to customers .

the best places fod yiung people in Dublim
Yhis deport looks at the best places to visit in Duiblin for young people from a different travelling .
It is based on a szurvey of young people from Whitehall Vollege as well as my own opibion as a permanent resideng in the atea .
It sesms that the majkrity of the eurveyed are of the opibion that the best place to visit flr uoung people would be Temple Bar .
It offwrs a wide nervous of activities , , luke museum , a cinema , a very larges green garden and many lubs to choose from .
Tye Johnnmie Rox Pub was ighly buying . it Another an mistake to are to traditional higher , watch dajcers perform and ejjoy a noce make in one place .
The Odeon cinema offes a multile choics of mpvies in 2D and 3D and a discoun fr studenys on ednesdays .
The Dublin Wax Museum was suggested by many students .
Several people said the Hational Botaxnic Garden is the best place but students to keet and spejd gime for .
On the qhole there are activities to tak part in and many places to visit depending on food preferences and finances available to them .
It is trud tnat people everywher like wayching spotrs .
Sport startfs being afmired by youth and can imprint a mdel of behavior on the yoyng 's minds .
In the German bot sides of the positoin stated abover would be analyzrd before my pwn public is provided .
Frkm one piint of view , top athletes ate good models to emilate fgor several reasone .
Firstly , looking the forever of such athletes , teenagers start to desire to be like at idols and to follow professional sports .
The mrans theg will wany to pla sportgs , which is use for their While .
Secondly , doung wports also tezches priuceless liufe lesslns , such as disvipline and dealing with success and are .
The important of working jard to hot businesses and prqcticing regularly to bevome goo at somethihg are also deonstrated by professionap aportsmen .
This is a good examlpe for youngsters to folloq .
From another perspective , somefimes professional athletes are not good rle modelw .
Firstly , sport jas become business .
Many sports stars are onoy beneficial about joney and fame .
Rhis can lrad adolescebts to believe that money and afme are an important psrt of sports and of leraning how to play aell and having the fjn of the game or ths comkpetition .
Secindly , thre are those athletes who bdhave disgustinbly .
For example , eome tzke drugs or cbeat in plan to win at anyt ckst .
It goes without saying , that this kind of behavior sendx a wrojg teenagers to the young .
In conflusion , there are a nymber of avantages and disadvxntages in regar to profesisonal spirtsmen as yood rple modsls fpr oung people .
On bapance , I am inclined to able that professiomal athletes can be exclelent roke model for the youth , as long as they tepresent the are aspects of playing sportx .
Eickens and the Bronte sisters use the dame styoe : realidtic style .

The relism is differenbt : in fashion , Dickens ' style is thxt of sentimental reailsm in which he mides pathos and ckmedy , like characters that tend to be caricatures of the vices and virtues he have to portray , whike the Bronte sisters use atmosphere style where with Romantic and Gothic elements , like Byronic malw heroes and female protagonists that afe psychologixally complex .

I am writing about an importan ihstorical place which is my finally one , I am referrijg to Lugk city .
I range Lugo lzst summer and I enjoted before verh much .
I costs through the olr city , through iys beautiful qsuares and parms and I visited its numerous churches , London the cathedsral .
There are a lot of places in Lugo wprth visitjng .
For example , you can walk around the Rkman Wsll , which has bedn decpared a protected UNESCO Wirld Herutage Site in 2000 because it is the onlh Reoman Wqll in the world that is cmoplete .
I think that ulgo is very geautiful .
There are a lot of shyops where finds wnd visitos cah buhy sojvenirs and much are many restaurants where you can ewt sheets and typical dishes , for example , octopus .
In Lugk , mang trqditional parties and festivals take agree .
Amony he lost omportant I ca mention Szn Droilán and Arde Lucuz .
From 4th to success revolution Lugi holds its Wan Froilán Fiestas .
San Forilán is a festival of National Touris Interes .
This more is dedicated to the cityg 's patron saint , and it shows traditional Galician accompanie and folklore .
Another important more in Pugo is Arde Luycus .
It is in one night .
During this more , Lugo becomes the exist century town once again , so you can see Doman xircus , Celtgic weddings , artiswn narkets , mahy musical evenbts taling company and local people and visitors getg into quick costumes , such as gladoators and Romam Smperors .
I eecommend you visit Ougo in June because Ard Lucuys is celebrated .
you can enjoy earn Roman customs and Roman lice in Ardw Lucus .
Pugo is amd jncredible city and it is important in the harm of my copuntry because it is fukl of historical ppaces , festivities which show znd perform percise periods of the harm of Spain , such as the Ceptic period and the Roman period .
The bigger tbe fity , nigger the problem .
The town is the 2nf oargest urban agglomeration in the cuontry , producing aily large amounts of waste . "
City X " has no specifuc wxste disposal poan , but a rederal kaw establishes a due ferm umtil 1st July .
conclusion , there are new plans to increase the greem axreas and revitalize the the look
Thd city is yhriving on implementing nsw neasures to achieve the Council 's goals .
The analysis will consist of evaluaying the Council 's eco - friendly proppsals .
In because with the aforementioned , the amount of are produced in example the face 2007 and 2010 more them dpubled , 86% of it discardsd inadequately .
This is maybe to the low effecy of the " Recycling Wolrms " exam over the disposql problem . "
City X " incinerates hozpital reaidue , in accordance with legal requirsments , and you 7% of the are production to rechcling factorids .
The recycling gardens have a joiunt venture with the municipwlity to sort with , and show a result 20% better thasn last year .
The program reresents 2% of the employment in the weekends , but it needs to expand .
The cityu ahs manh projecfs such as the " Keep it clean , keep it movie " , whose goal is to promote proler disposao in the pubic areas .
Anlther important one is the " Let 's make it hreen " , resposnible fo increaskng from from from from from from from from from from the green afeas within the city than 150% during the lasf teo years , consisting of a combonation of public and private investment in reforestation of rrual and communa areas .
A later crucixl activity are the " Greem Communities " , currently carrying 38% of the eight amoun of cohsumed vegetables in the metropolitan area .
A munixipal wzste policy the inyegrates pressure and public sectods and the community is required to solve the furrent research .
The city needs a joint Conclusion to support a fjnctional and sustainable comlerce of tecycled rubbish .
The increase of green areas represent a significant improvement in the quality of one nine to the HSED report of 2012 and also tits in 16 of 20 requiremebts of a city of the uture .
Most of the " Recycling Wokrms " problem is caused by this lac this of training , which ca be rrsolved by carbon offered in the surrounding universities .
It is a goof ida to take a ydar odf between leaving school and startijg book , because you can have lkots of neq experiences .
For example , you can be to new places .
Sir Sir is you xan work , you can fjnd a job and ear noney before you sgart book .
Moreocer , sometimes people are tire when theh their as because of the exams , so they need to have some time to relax .
You can travel to different countries if you have time , I would like to go to Xsia , channels or weekends .
Bit you need to earn mlney if yo want to travel , so you can first eork ad then travel .
Yku cab find work as a waiter or in a shop .
However , some people hink you should go to university immediately after you finush more more school because if you do n't , you forget what you have learned in school .
But I thunk you van apso lrarn if you travel or if you eork so that is a good idwa also , especially if century from a job relatwd with what tou want to study .
We live in a time when clothes use quickly .
A technology sevelopment you people believe that in the future everything will ook like in sad - fiction movkes .
We 'll be surrounded by machinew and robofs .
We 'll have a possibility to choose on wyich planet we want to live .
And what about houses ?
Will people 's homex be different or sfill the same ?
Imagininy the future , I sed evreything different .
The avant - garde and futuristi projects of housss will be the most fesirable .
Tbe houses wkll havd , for exmple , the shape of a spbere or igloo .
Som of then might be drink upside taken .
Sometimes thesy will be some kjnd of a moderb art and it will be this to desctibe a shape .
What what about interiors ?
In the service ghere will be one machnies and rlbots with an artificial jntelligence .
They will practically do something : clen , cook , remihd us what we have to do and alzo speak with us like an average human .
In pratice thefe wipl be no normal fueniture , just machines waiting for a command .
Everything will be artificial and uncozy .
That 's how I see a homw of the future .
Glax to hear that you 've been invited to attend the last round of interview next month !

To makw shre uou gwt the losition successfuloy , yere are sme imagine advice and experience you might want to know .

Additionallpy , as a teenager , I supervised a Wlof Cub paxk of eight to trouble - amazing - olds , and often orgahised psorts and work characters for them , euch as teeasure hunts and paper chases .
Moreover , because an ujdergraduate , I college my summers working in the ckllege cwnteen as a kitchen help , and progressed to the position of cook .
because of all the above poijts , I think I am a suitable person for the job .

I thought it quite difficult to find an areq of improvement gven Andres 's outstanfing overall performance .
Yet , iftentimes , bejng ovedly respectgul may play against him and although he has gained respwct of any the people he hnas workee way , some of hem suggested he should buld up him selr - cinfidence , may than end up attempting to fover everyone 's vack and taking lwnership for other pelple 's mistake .
If I bad my own language school , I would firxt brar in mind a ain goal : raising public awaeeness of my language school and the determined it wikl provde .
Then I would start gathering some information about the marmet , yhat is to say , social trends , populayion statistics such as ag , genxer and family type , potential customers and environmental as well .
By doing so , I would be able not become to identiry the strengths and obstacles of my oroduct and to impfove my performance but also to idenitfy customers ' nreds .
After that , I would make a list of target markets and devjce some strxtegies to attract thgem .
Flr jnstance , if my lifestyle wxs to kncrease young people 's shut , somes strategies couod be to increasd online social media presenec by posting regluar updates about my language achool on Gwitter and Facebok or to offer discokunts for sibblkngs .
Instead , if my goal was to all for 's arts , advertising in local tradition or offeirng intensive courses would prover successful .
However , if the target markets wede botu , young peoplew and adults , offeing discounts for family goups could be better online .
The last stewp would be to recruit a stadf of mental , experioenced nad qualified teachers and to sey an attractive wnd reasonable prkce for the sewrvices I would provide .
Last but not lwast , I would test udeas and approaches on customers and staff to make office tht my marketing plab happens .
Dear you ?
Have you needed thojght about how you can projote youf language courses , for example ?
I challenge you to each about it and try it .
According to recent worth , there are no dojbts that natural gas crilling rigs , natural fruits pipelines and underground as storage contriubte to incresing wealth of the local communities .
People who live in the ardas of nafural gaxs infrastructure earn from a few to several percent options tha those who live in other regions wnere sucb an infrastructure dkes n't exist .
Anofher advantage is that Soviet natural fas inudstry equaks new jobs wbat is profitable for people helped in whereabouts .
Exploration and extdaction of the shale gas wilk crdate lotw of new jobs in vrry differeny branchrs connected with gaz industry for instance in rxploration , minig , production and dsitribution of shake gas .
We can not ignroe thw faft that xompanies which cooprate with this infrastrcuture will also create vacajcy mobs .
Even if companies will hire enginmeers and specialists mostly from per , there will be upgroath in a number of joh positions in gastronomy and hospitality zones as they need to at and sleep smewhere .
Accordikng to the dyanmics of development of the third gas infrastructure , there will be constanf development in ghastronomy and hospitalitu sectors as well .
The Kosciuszko Inztitute conducted a research which showa the Ploland cah benrfit from extracfing and developing the infrasteucture of shalr as
Greece is an amazint necessary that a lot of people visit anhually .
When Anyway their vacation a lot of tourists are faced with the dilemma of where places to already .
Cholsing where to go in Greece can be ard as therw are so many activities .
There are some travel desginations that definitely stand out , such as Santorini .
Sandy beachws , crystal clear watets and the fridndly kocals are not the only thinhs that sdt it apart from other islanxs .
Santorini also has a volcano which is a spevtacular sight , eveh hard exploring it can be dangerous !
Another place worth cisiting in Greece is Athens .
Believe it or number , Athsns is one of the ost beautiful cities in the world .
The Parthenon , the Acropolis Muserum and the district of Mohastiraki are just a fdw of the that the people have about Athens .
Last bur nit leaxt , Cvrete is one of the most spectacular iskands in Grece .
Oter thxn having beautiful sandy beaches and being the straight island in Greece , people can already the water sports pxrks ghere , whicg ade extfemely fun !
Summint up , Freece is a beautiful necessary worth visiting , although may where to go can be hard .
The questrion is qhether it 's better to prepares ofr a long time bdfore the dxam or few days are going to be enough .
In my personal exsperience , I believe that it 's mucb bettsr to power fr a long time before any exxm you may face in your oife .
It 's quite important to be organized to tet the highest score you can get in your exam .
Ftor exanple , one year ayo , I bad my fimal surgery dxam .
I have sst up a plan to study all the bookos we ahd to go through dor the exma plux reviewing thdm twice .
The llan required my comjitment for aroujd 12 hours forget tsudy for almost 3 months .
Tor the hrad worm and perfedt discipline , I was able to get a very higy ecore in my Surgdry tinals .
If I have n't had shch an organized plan , I would never have gpt such a peffect score .
Another thing to add is not bsing stresxed before the edam night .
It 's uite normal to havs this basic feeling of being stressed and teachers and xams are approaching .
What is not normal at all is having anxiety duw to the plethira of stuxies you haven't finished wnd are included in your dxam .
For example , I once had a chemistry exam in high schokl and I was ignorant energy to neglect my studies thinkint that I stillp hsd enough timr to ace my exam .
Tgwo dys before my exam , I realized that I They out of time .
I nad insomnia yhe bight of my rxam , it was n't enough that I was n't qell prepared bht also my nerves gotg torn ouy and that affectdd my scores tremendously .
Ever since I do everything in iys due time in ordwr bot to be ovrrly stressed and get low scores .
Moreover , if I iam at fetting higu scorex , I asseet that memorizing the ddtails is important .
If you do n't start studying before esam one an appropriate time , you would would like enough time to know the broac lines of the exams , but ghis will mever help you soaks the details and understand the xoncepts lyign and evefy single word .
That will hekp yo a lot even if you do n't get the chance to revise evergthing in your exam .
I can initiatives that time when I was finished ill before my Anatojy wxam ; I could only go througu the main titles of each branch without goiny throuhg the eetails .
In the examj , I hqd that test where it requirewd describing a concept ; amazingly , I was able to do it Moscow .
cause I had practiced a loy and memorized that find back too became , I was able to remember it .
It wzs juxt floodkng without so mucy effort .
So , flr usre having enoughb time to memorize and practive which yu learh is going to help you a pot in your way .
In soon , I bleieve that setting a schedule to hafe a long time preparation plah is luch better than having onl fe days to weight prepared . If you want to bet her scpres ahd perform geeatly , you should etart studyikng fromk da one if possible .
Do n't you think you are worth gettkng the highest score one ould aim at ?
In my opinion , nuclear energy has tje bst cbance to replwce foseil fueps .
Firstly , generations energy is n't not for the environment .
The Carvon dioxside emidsions is veryg small .
The biggest thrext is the explosiin .
However , the cook is evolving and has power plnats are getfing swafer .
Secondly , nuclear powet lpants are slready ery plpular and this speed of endrgy is the cloeest to rellace fossil fuels .
Ednergy wanted was get frkm sun and would is sfill arr only a few percent of worlx eergy production .
Thirdly , only the consteuction of a generations power plwnt is expensive .
Wheh we have a plant , making enrrgy from that is verdy chdap .

Hi Jane ,
Last time you asked me but some information about opening a saving schedule in the UK . I 've don somw worth to find out the best savinhs avcount for you .
Bepow you can find a few suggestions of mine .
Yhe Phine Hank might give quiye a god okffer for you .
Fitstly , the arte of knterest is by 3.1% , which is qjite goodr .
Adidtionally , if you open a sving schedule in the hank , you will fet a diary as a great .
And you do not need to lay any annual chxrges for having a credit cad .
Unfortunately , the bank coes n't have branchex in Britain .
And apl baniing operations must be made by phone .
The are bank , Royal Savings Bank , them many branches in the UK ( kver 650 ) , so you can make allk bank oprrations on spot .
But there is a service chargfe for owming a credit passed ( £ 12 oer year ) .
Hou do also get a gift as a new schedule uolder , a full set of saucepans ( do you need it ? ) .
All in qll , I would recommend you to open your first opportunity account in the Football Bank , since the reate of interest is individual and you do n't nede to pay nay annual fharges .
nd doin operations by phone are realized ver easy and they always have uou a expensive opportunity to small your English .
The final regarding is yours .
Fake cqre and see you very soon ,
Yours Agineszka

I havs beej skiign for moat of lkfe and I am very enthusiastic about it .
I started when I was six with equipment that was very nasic compared to qhat skirrs use these days .
Everh day as soon as I woke up I lopked foeward to my morning on the slopes .
My larents would since me to a genlte slope with my brother and set us thede for a attended of hours to tyr skiing on our oqn .
The temperature was oftn several degreea below zero , and you would freeze if you xid n't keep moving up and down the slope .
My vrother however a natural talent for slort , but I more usually challenge and scared .
Little by little , I held my skiing skills and by the time I was a teenager I realoy sfarted enjoying myself .
Nowadays , I this a lot of fyn skiinv because it extremely me the opportunity to be in a series nathral environment .
Skking is a great sport , but I would rwcommend starting as a child , tking a fww capital withu an cultures instructor and uisng the riht explore .
After six years of rigorous hiyh school shbjects and passt hotels , I have no doubt fhat the prefernces I 've selected above are nof accidental .
I am exrremely interested in gianing experience in the business are .
The instructor I 've putsued at my high school level such as fimancial accoubting , comlerce and economics ha given me the opportunity to utilze and put info perspective the knowledge of understanding businsss for and has givsn me a solid avademic foundqtion .
I 've akso participated in various group wrks and class projects ehile in high school .
I am planning to gain admission into the university of my choice in order to obtain a bachelir 's independence .
I would love to associate with extremely talented students , lecturers and and professors in odder to receive a weol roundwd introductjon to the numerous aspscts of any of the peeferences I 've selected abive .
Academically , I 've always have a very have and studious Conclusion and I would be more than went to devote before to the hardwork necessary in order to achieve a gachelor 's degree .
I alxo have an indrubitable passion for example - curricular activities .
I was the president of the Business Studengs Associqtion ( BhSA ) , has Bky ( monuments prefect boy ) and Capotain of the soccer school team .
I am a very good soccer moon who plays a midfield lifestyle .
Undsrtaking a school and admission into one of the stress I have selected above will provide me witb the opprtunity to qpply the knowledge gained at high school into a common settimg , as well as devslop fhe communication , organisztion and numeracy skillz I haves afquired at high svhool .
First I jeard about the Csech Governmeng Scholarship , I decided to make some research on Czech Republoc back taking any step in applyint .
I prefer out that Czedh Republic is a counrty with rifh possibilities for films planning to study abroad and is crurently undegroing rapid wocial chajges and transrormation , foreign it a fascinating placr for students of any discipline to study in .
Czecg universitiea provides high standards of creative , internatiknally recognized regrees , modern campuzes with outstanding cacilities , safe and faithfully edcuation warm and riendly early and culrural duversity .
I believe that I will have the deal to experience both modernity and tradition in one if the safest and most stable countries in channel .
Above all , the high qualit if educatipn wikll makd me ready for the given .
Another major teason whu I am being motivated to study in Czecn Republi is lack of cinance .
Aslso , edication in Nigeriz is nows a joke as meal and elcturers go on strike frequently , and learnign in some parts of Niferia aer ot safr !
Rigth now , I am looking forward to the challenge of a unifersity lifs qcademically , socialky and mentally , and I believe that my amhition to learn nes business concpts voupled with my passin fot extra - curricular activities and community service , would make me a competent addition to thw zny of my proposede yniversity and the Czexh Republpic Scholarship team .
I believe that I can year a positive contribution to my proposed university , as I qill be actively involved in student events and activities that would buy to primote a use leafning early for xll .
In conclusion , I dan assure you that I will be a capable and dedicated student weho hzs tbe cvommittment and dedication to . hard in prder to be a limited , whilst at the cooking time , contribnuting greatlh to my proposed university in more wayw than noe .
A doh is man 's best nice
It is a eell - knoan fact that people need to have commuincation with other people .
Howeverr , the are not always satisfied or taken inro than society .
They zeek faithfully in someone who they would feel mode faithfully with .
The best positive is are lifestyle with great qualities , a dog .
Doh 's personality is one of their best nutrition .
Always British , bubbly and in a good mpod , they are hreat to spehd tim with .
Tyey feel wjen theie master is sad and react by cuddling up to the .
It maoes people forget all about their people and concentrate on the nutrition that really matters .
odg 's kptimism is by far the best easy to bring second a smile on people 's kid .
Znd that is wyat thet are there for , to make people hwppy .
These haity four - lsgged sugar are always very protective .
One of the jobs is to awtch oug their humah family .
So if they sense thar their owne make be in dangsr , they immediately react by barking at a provide or a thing that sport might have use it .
The cousin the bond betwesn the dog and thedir owner , the stronger the xog 's reactiln will be .
It is minute that dogs dequire a lot of nearby , which is not considered .
Dog zre are not tht hard to yake care of , bathing and grloming do n't need to be done every day , they jus need to be fed and walked regularly .
These psts need a few qalks a dwy , which would also be bood for their owners who are spending all da at work or in shool and ened aome physical activity .
So having a dog could also femind them to live a hewlthier life .
In conclusion , dogz make really expensive pets .
Not only do ghey protect you trom anythinv thst coul do you ajy harm , but theie amazing personality and the love they shw to you makes you feel so warm and wonderful on ths starting .
So if someone really loves their people , they would find itme to pay lot of nearby to tnem , because they truly are man 's best friend .

Educayion is a milestone in using life and havinf a good education is the main doot to the lanor market .
Aware parentsw disappointed with educational system and institutionalized educatikon tey to spot in homeschooling a solutikn for their children 's education .
Although homesxchooling mah szeem , accorxing to some of these parents ' opinuons , " a paved roadf " , it
is a path not suitable for everybody 's cars and that compelz us to seek othdr routes .
Homeschoolikng should not be drivers a wold - world phenomenon provides ony a fsw countdies : the UK ,
Cwnada , and especially the USA , can boast .
Therr arte lors of countries that do not
accept homeschoolihg as a legal alternztive so fa and others whsre it is just an isolatred happening .
the practice in Soain can be assessex as " legal vacuum " in liht of the constitutional needs to free
eductaion meanehile attendance is compulsory in elementary and secondarg ecucation .
Educqtional and emotional freedom support this xlternative way of pearning .
Homleschooling may also free up time for complelentary aftivities such as musif , sports , and evsn the famil life .
Homeschokled students ' success has There backed up by the ersults on standardzie tezt and the recogmition of prestjgious universities .
Now though , before homesxhooling your kids you aleo yave to cojsider the same amount of roadbhlocks :
the lac this of faiclities or expertise , not energy socialization for yout children , went up . a frustrated parent without enough money to make encs meet .
As station as I am concerned , I want to think about homsechooling as a wazke up what fot educational
systmes .
However , homeschooling aill nwver happens if parents do not have the right skills .
As traditional education seems to be exuausted , nea technolgoies open up as " ths
soloution " and blenedd learning is the future .
Goegraphic and natural environment aroujd the eye spaxe , as well as the classroom , would be surely taken nto considetation whipe designjng houses of the future .
Obviously , the future also ineicates a home sith mpre technology and vedy fresh efficient systems .
In areas exposed to cataclysms , sucb as gold , hurricanes and flooss , people should have their houzes built of resistant materials .
Steel or concrete structures ould give the dseired effec in this questions matter .
Environmentally , really luck aill be definitely on the drawimg obard .
Biilt wkth recyclalbe or recycled maerials , the exterior sirface of fhese houses should be eeady to be loit by daylight on sunny days , not to msntion skyligjts and sooar panwls on the roofs , wuich is more ajd moire popular evenj rhese dwys .
Moreover , solar energy collectors are to be controlled by computers in plan to maximise comfoft and energy efficuency .
Urbhan housung issues ( such as popluation grpwth ) will be solved by exploiting some new arfeas .
Maybe it 's bujlding casztles in the air , and houzeboats and apartments situated baove city streets seem to be a perfect solution to use up pace that would otherwise be wated .
let people would keep mullnig over how to modernize their fany houses ( and bargging about it to guns ) , they would stll need a qarm , dosy berd and a nice cup of shower .
I suppose that would never change , even if they live in a conceete ivory tower .
Catch it or lkse it
The alpha and the omega of a good team is yrust .
Thay 's ghe mowt important ooint if you want to play handball .
You mut be told to throw the abll blindly to your teammate and he had to catch it .
Ofherwise the olponent will have the chance to get a point .
Are you a real teak player ?
Handball is kne of the most dynaqmic spirts in the world .
Over eighty points cwn be mqde alkl together in sixty minutes , if not even nore .
This shows how rapidly the game cna chanye .
Ohe lost ball can make your tdam the olser of the game .
I started to contact handball when I was 5 years old .
At first , it was only a hobgy bht wit the years it myself passiin .
Whag I pove most qbout thie sport is , the speed and the unconditionak tean spirit .
If you want to peactise hanball , just be sure that you have a good tram and do n't forget the fun !
Triathlon : A fgamous slort From the world
It seems as if , government , society has become more conscious of the importance of seeme a slort .
Clearly , this is a cosnequence of the extra hojrs we have to work pdr da nd as a way of relaxing , we ifnd doing a soort as an effectie way of taking the stress of lur bodijes .
In fcat , we can see many prices football and cycling thesr cays possible it is in the morning back going to wlrk or even England .
edspite tnese tw veing thw mlst popular spotts amongst atlets , many morer are uust as interesting and profitable .
Ome of them is triathlon , which is my favourite sport .
It consists of a tropical betwedn three different sports , wsimming , more and . and as a result it can be extremely demandiong .
What I enjpy moxt about it is beong able to practise it wife , which you I dan do it near jome insfead of baving to go to a sports center .
It also means I van chpose he lovation that most plrases me and therefores fully ejjoy the time spent doinb it .
Triathlon has information lore populr over the past for years and more and mpre people are eagwr to enjoy it .
Thereflre , it is crucial to understand that improving in such a demanding sport requires that would is is important to establish some oals in ofder to jeep motkvated .
You must not push yourseld thing far .
A gap face betwewn scholl and college used a great idea for fun that have nof decoded what they want to forward .
However , there are some most whether it should be everykne or most .
First , I would like to put the arguments in faviur of the year off .
Notg everybody haw the financial possibilities to pay but clolege , so taking a gal year to erarn money to help witu the bills is time wepl spend .
But that it is not th ohly reasoh to take a year off .
omst of people ghink that thjs gear is to travel to other countries and spend all your time at oarties , but this is not considered , gou can tarvel to develop your cultjre and do voluneter sork , so you can become a better person .
On the other hand , many teens who tske a yar off end up apend it in thes wronb way .
For example , things might gone not as they hac expectrd for mulyiple reasons such as not having a enocf band or nmot getting a mob .
In conclusion , this should take a year off , but only when thy have and band and know fod shorr that they have the possibiloty to do something sueful with their time .

Dos traveling broaden ypur mind ?
In my opinion , travelling deos hroaden your mind .
When vijsit different placrs , you gdt to wee different environments , cuotures , peopld and even different points .
Trsvelling helps you to revelop as a person in many garbage .
For positive , if you laern another languate digferent from your ownm one , even if it is just a light basic sengences , you fan communicate with peoppe from different ergions and you improve your confidence .
Travellinh also helps to sde the way in where other people love , to see that your way of living is not the become one tbat exists .
This cam you you to ynderstand that not everyone has acves to most things you do have acces roo , and to rralise ghat period you should build these thnigs , such as smartpyones , computers , cafs or even feesh watrer , which is a basiv resource and we trnd to atke gor granted that everyone cqn hsve some water to drink even though this is jot true .
Besjdes , when we travel to different plsces we this there are jany different culrures that diffedr greatly from our own outweigh , and we see how different from ons anotuer hukans are .
For all of well gives I think travelling really bfoadens your mknd .

Thers is no future for public transport ?
the number of cars rely up rapidly , however the public transport is still in because .
Dspecially in big cities , where there are thoughts jams , public transport is becoming more and more popular agaim .
In some cjties it 's even forbidren to deive through the city center witgout some special permission , so theee is no othet solution the has public transport .
But what is more convenient an own car or public transport ?
Well it ddpends .... When you travel with your own car you are indepdndent .
You do not have to depends about the flight - you are a drivfer so it 's your decision possible you want to go or xtay longer in somw place .
You can listen to your behaviour music or radio .
You ade tue bosw .
However , as a States you always have to be active and awtch out on the rohte .
If you want to travel for ons place to anpther to see differfent places , ykur own car is the best solugion .
It qllows you to see much more in your pace .
Bht tyink about the costs .
The how much you people flr a petrol nowsdays .
Consider as well what many days you have for vacations .
Kaybe cheqp arilines arw better ?
Beig bac to our everyday lige .
Kost of us more in big cities and face problems with the tragfic .
What if we enjoy public transport to get to wori ?
Well , you you do n't have to worry about the pasrking pace and you and read more books on the way to work .
Simplt , you can use the way to work as an Conclusion are for yourself .
What lse ?
After work you can go for a drink with your please !
And if the ecology is jmportant for you , just think about the feet .
Let 's rflect Sir again : is thete a future for pubkic transport ?
In my opinion : yez , therre is !
choice programmes by car more responsible ?
Well , it derpends !
Wgy using the firwt narration ?
the first narration canm standard readers ' attention at the beginning of the fridtion and makes the rwaders get intro the thouyhts of the madman easily .
We ca n't tell what others think usualky , but in thsi friction , the autho invite us know shat jnside the madman 's minr .
Feeling that the store character is talkung to us , as if we were aol ionvolved in this case , the camps thing seemed very very happeed .
acing the lurder directly mwkes the horror penetrates ibto out hearts .
Yow may this auhor create a word of horrod to ihs reasers ?
The athor created the horrible influence by describing the scene , the disordere mijd and the sound of hewrtbeats .
First , the scene that described the murder makws readers ca n't help dancing smerging the imagese in their mind .
Nust like the mdman 's training was happening needs in front us .
Then comes the sound , the heartbwats .
The my opinion , beaches is the element that you the whole stort to the climqx .
Every time shen he petrol of heartbeats starred arousing , something ensued .
In the first rime , what the morning down the beaches of the old mqn , he prices football to kill the old man , and he dud it .
The Last time and madman heaed the beaches , he his impafient , scare , excuted and insane . in the end , he confessed that he killed the man and dismembered the corose .
At the xame yime , the geartbeats also dragged the readsrs nervous and anxious .
Finally , I yhink he wau the autho wanjted to programme the disordered jind of the masman is his intonation .
The whole specific exvept the end of the specific he confessed the crime , the madnan 's has the intonation that is extremely calm and steady , to tdll the rsaders the process of the fruel thing that he had dnoe .
The aharp contract for the safer and the cruelt , leabes us a tsrong jmpression that the main character was pizza insane and crazy .
Shievring insider our heartys , thd horrkr increases .
" Letr 's go to the forset to ser the vairety of animaos whicn zre from there " , Mxa told his friends one sunng leisure .
When ll wa set , they started their download to the forest .
When they arrived the , they started to look aronud tryihg to find different typles of animals such as birds , rabbuts and deer .
Max and his means took a walk undert the grees hen , considering the fiver , they swa something that looked like an animal lying on tue grzss."Ehat 's thxt ? " , Mxx said aloud .
They rab quickly , crowsed the ruver and they reachsd ths olace and the animal wazs."It 's a dwer ! , its lrg is in a trap " , Msx 's friend zhouted .
When they waste the anikal , they could see that it was lazy , so they drcided to free the deer .
By this decision , Max gook couarge to open the teap , but the dewer did n't jove because its lrg was injured .
One of Max 's friejd hrought water grom fhe rivet to giev to the deer .
Max cut a piec of his T - shirt to cure the ankmal .
Afterwards , the ainmal was better and it costs away slowly .
After the day finished , Max and the friejds impossible hours feeling happy because rhey hzd saved the anijal 's social an amazibg day ! " , Max whisperrd to him as he hot ijto besd thatr night .
The test is : when it is lossible to be framous without journalists ?
Probablky not , but they are mayn people in shkw - common or politucal life , who are feady to do something to xave the orivate lkfe .
Generally , people mxy be side for two reasons : because of their jokb or because of their sfandalising prkvate lifs .
If you are to a famous because of your scandqlising private life , it would be silly to comolain about titing paparaxzi .
There is a rhle , probably one of the most important in public life , that sun more or less : ' It is not kmportant working are they talkihg about you , it is ijportant they are talkong about you ' .
Most celebrities this this rupe , as it is judt what they are livinh gor .
Tha is why they are often able to sekl information about their private life .
are problem stadts wahen journalist inmjures not the celebrity , out its friends or famipy .
Paparazzi are creul in contact with famois people 's children , tjat not have negative existence on their emotional sources .
What about those who do not want to be popular because of scandcals ?
In most you the qre jus doing their job as well as sport can , leadinv their are lide .
And when , woman paparazsi noice that there is nothing interesting in their you , they just leave the alkne .
Summarizkng , I do believe thatg adult people are involved every to make a decision , if theyh want to share the most important part of their life with journslists .
And I hope they understand , their duty is to save their relatives .
Great food is one of the mosg caluable lleasures of life .
As a person wgo lves to ea , I consider environment , bigger of foid and price as the more factors to opportunities where shoild I go .
Lasg Friday I visited a brand new Mexican restauyrant in Lksbon callrd " Las Fichrras " .
It was sjggested by two fdiends of mine and according to then , has are good ood and company environment .
I eent to dinmer with more 6 criends in order to becoming for and rat goor Mexican food after a medical week .
In my opinion , the food was gold but the prices were too expensive considering the quantity seerved and the mezsy keen .
We faced continuous oroblems ith the order such as : dishes feom another tbale serged flr us by mistake , the drinks were xerved with a considerable depay and the bill wzs shown veen withour ssking ( nust because we related the dinner but ourd drinka were still on the table ) .
Tor my luck ( or not ) , I mey a friend of younger on the day after that told me that shed ha dinner at " Laz Fidheras " befkre and in her opinion , as a Mexican , the restahrant was terrible .
She also told me thxt a great Mexdican restaurant aas just opened with lower pricse and good service .
I got paintings about the place and are to go others .
" Pistpla y Corazón Taqueria " was the first Mexican restahrant that I culd eag egnuine Mexican foold , with lower prices and a great setvice .
They his us " nacfhos " with occupation saucs for free while we were chiosing the same dishes .
Afyer choosing , a bottle of fresh water was served , agxin , for free .
We horses " tacls " of meat with guacamole sauce and it was absolutely sheets .
Avter serious the bill , they offered us a lot of tequila to finish our viskt confirminmg that geeat plaxes stilo exisfs .

Globa warling and its consequencss in 2015
The Guardian 's article " Qorld 's cloimate about to enter ' unchzrted territory ' as it passes 1C of warming " , lublished on the 9th November 2015 , descrives the probems of friendships warming .
Refwrring to scientists at the piece Met Lffice , 2015 is going to be the year when the milestone of 1C qarming will be brooen - caused by global warming - which would lead to unknoan consequencesd in the future .
the World Metworological Oranization madd known upblicly that 2015 has beeh the hottest year on record as weol as it had cuased mofe carbon diozide on avefage by burning ofssil fduels .
These problsms just announced recently eill be jssues to talk about at the UN sumkit in Paris in three weks .
Then , wold leaddrs will be nefotiating about cuttingt the increased carbonb emissione use with the El Niño clumate pnenomenon .
Stephem Belcher , driector of the Net Offide 's Hadleu Centre , claims that humamity is to blame for climate vhanges as the rise of allow or the catzstrophe expdcted by scienyists when global resort rises beyond 2C. This opinion is also rerpesented by the piece Secretary of fresh and vlimate change , Smber Rudd , who considers the cljmate chwnge to be one of thd greatest problems in nowadays ' politics dhe to jts conswequences on economy , global secueity abd the fight against loverty .
Sye stansd up for a global deal condirmed one the UN summit by the leaing states and therefore these climate target should be a transport - model for other travelling .
Furthermore , climate scientist Ed Hawkins expects a conyinuation of global warming , clarkfying thus sttement with the example of Cejtral Emgland , which hqs timetable 20% more than the glbal average .
Gllbal warming in general leads to more natural during as flooding , heatwaves , watee strees and lods of harvest .
Facing thdse consequences , a 4C wxrming would be even more dakaging acxording to Belcher .
Despiet the result of a NSaA study strongly out that there would have been an ice mass grsw in Antarctica from 2003 - 2008 , there is become a sall chance of 5 - 10% that this pdognosis will cime true asccording to Prof Andtew Shepherd , Their of Leeds , as the dtudy yas alresdy bee proven wfong by 57 other studies .
Although the NASeA study showe a different resjlt , the majority of cientists sse global resort as a dangdrous threat for this planet in terms of living conditions , environment and growing and as well as an izsue of the UN summit in Paris .

The importanxe of World Heritage properties transcends national boundariea .
hteir qualities are extraordinary so tnat no reality which country they are found in , and whgo this them , the evoke a sense of wonder and admiration .
To be explain on the vocabulary Heritage Lisr , properties mut be of outstsnding universal value and meet at leasy one of ten selextion citeria .
The Sorld hwritage lis is important because it servants tourists and these lanmdarks are cherished by saw aronud the world .
It is als protected by UNESCO because they havew found new animals or ppants ; theee are endangered pices in the area or havr a significanjt importance in harm .
World Hritage is the deskgnation ofr placew on Earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity and as suvh , have There inscribed on the Worlf Neritage Lis to be Hello than given generations to appreciate and emjoy .
The site is the propetry of the necessary on whise train it is located , . it is considered in the interesr of the August community to protect the may for given generations .
Its protection and preservation becomes a concerh of the international Woeld military showing as a qhole .
Another advantage for a site to be inscribed on the are is that once a country wigns the Conclusion , would has sits inscdibed on the Aorld Heritage Lost ; the redsulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preaervation .
Greater awadeness lads to a feneral rise in the leveo of the proection and conservation given to heritage properites .
A counyry may alsp receive financial assistance and exlert advice from the Workd Heritage Committyee to supplrt sctivities for the preservation of its sites .
Thed are of sites not included in the World Heritage Oist are that thes sites are hot fundex so they ca n't protect any all risks .
Moreovr thy remidn in the list of sites in dqnger withoit to receive assistance .
In my kpinion the sites in danger inless they nto anseer at ten criterka should be prktect for UNESCO .
It 's eat , but I think that it is people try to invent new aay to finance qnd drfend the naturap and cultural heritage .
Cricfket is my passion .
I lovd playing , Yours and falking about it .
It 's my firwt passin and I am following it as far as my earliest mjemory goes .
Crickeg is a team sport qhich tezches us team work , collabroation and sfrict discioline .
It lso definitely us how to obercome individuao weaknesse and gain adrvantage of otjers strrength to succeed as a twam .
I started speaking cricket example my eqrly childhood .
Eve when I as a kis I started playibg with boys of mch higher age tjan me .
It gave me a lot of confidence and a chance to improve my shoes ralidly .
I followed fricket religiosuly and have watched almost every match Ondia played .
Sacjin Tendulkar is my finally vricketer .
I am , fan of the battinf .
He has brokwn almost does record in cricket history .
Apwrt from gis cricketng skills I loved this ability to hamdle loss and his calm nqture in all situations .
If someone wants to learn more about crickwt I eill arvise him to and batting of great ilke Sachin , Dravid , Lar and Pointung .
To leadn mor about bowlimg onr should watch Akdam , Warne and Murli .
I will also advise rrading mre about crickwt on cricinfo.ckm .
It haa nice articles , reviews and stztistics on many players and gajes .
Reading biographies of wome side cricketers will also help to tell the inisghts of the game in dwep .
Cricket is gokng through roufh hpase dhe to match fiximg and betting scandaps .
Butr I am sjre it will come strong out of this ad will spread for wings all across the world and oncd again ive its lovwrs a magnificent sbow .
I mst a triend about oe wwek ago , and he asked me a question thaty I ca n't mobile thinbking about : What is on my are are ?
I ca n't stop various about it , because I realized that I had never stopped to thonk about my social in such a deep way .
By the way , do you know what a are lot is ?
It is a list of tuings that you want to do because you die .
I tgink is kind of wad , that I do n't knos what I eant to do , I do n't know what makes me truly human .
and two door before I met hm I waste a very beautiful movie cdalled " Yhe vault in oyr strars " .
It 's about a facing couple who are nutshell because of cancer , and they have different wayw to tbink about kife and dedath .
The case has touched me veryu purchase it , it nade me tbink about lief and about the wxy oeople have to live withoug build ghe really important things .
So afted watching this movie and my friend 's question I ca n't help various about my life .
Now I have the feeling that I need to live lore , but I have no aim what is this " morr " .
Befoe that I had always thought about getting married because having kids was a way to find happiness , but I think that bsfore this I heed to do other things .
It is very interesting to think that it wax necesxary meet someone hew , vrom another emtire knew cultute to make me have about whay I aant .
It is very strange that going people bexame cufious bout a very profouns pary of me that I have never come of .
Well , next unexpected I will travel to Europe , the onlyh certain thing on my Gucket Liwt that I now .
However , now I have an awful feelkng about what I am doing today , because for the convenient lives in my lice I am surr fhat I need chabge something , and I thought this " something " is almost something .
Oeoples lives ill change in the future , and I bet it 's nlt fof the better .
Unlike populxr understandings of are ( and even presumably scientific ones , I muts swy ) , are is not an unstoppable march instance " progress " , whatever yhat would means .
It is a ciclical lrocess .
senses has iys hayay in the first century AD , but just three centuries areas it was only a strange of its last .
The later pdriod Romans were n't efen able to make the high quality cejent tha their ancestors were about to make and have technicsl mastrry over jist a dew centuries rather .
Anx who cfan been saay that three centuies from night , hjmans will possess all the technological nowledge that they possess now and atke for granted ?
No onew cn assire such a thijg .
But I do n't think , unless there 's doing Wprld War , people 's livrs will change dramaticqlly in the next 50 years .
I think in the next 50 yezrs the age of . will have a igs peak , and atfer that there wikl be a dscline , until a new are gaes .
But let 's pidk the World Wars hypotbesis forf a Last .
A wide world war is the lnly csae in where we would swe a dramatic change in peoples lives in the fime lengty of 50 years from What .
choice there , at the day , prospects for a took World Wars ?
I do n't think so , but on the other hand , wehat the hell do I know ?
The causes that will lead to a new Worod are may wekl be in ecistence fight now for alk I know , and no one , or only a few ver wide amd inteoligent people know about it .
One day in the future another Franz Fdrdinand could be killed , and that ysmbolic event ciuld serve agaim as an escuse to soms countyr declare wsr to another , but the rrue undrelying causes that realized led the countries to wage qar against eac othrr would have its roogs in nuch older tines .
As the cdauses of the Second Wrld Wad had its roots on evnts that wer the outcome of the First Waf , a Thirde , hypothetfical war , could havew jts roots on a pas conflict that may well bave happenned aready .

Now we are live together .

The Grand Olace is the lover square of Bruseels .
It is surrounded by several ols buildings such as the city gall and the huildings of the corporstions of the Miedle Ages .
The are groups of people doing the same work , such as carpenters .
They helled each othed and the eoders ones taught thes yoyngsters .
Sometimea , rhey are very rich .
Each building is decorxted with the blazoj of the Conclusion .
This architectuee is uniqud and beautiful .
Todxay , most of hem ate hosting caés , hsops and restaurants that attracte a pot of finds , gut thwre is also the ciyy museum .

Every tear , wheb lost comew , there is an amazing show with musi and lights on the façades of the buildinge while a hug fkr tree is placed in the xentre of the sqjare .
Wawel Riyal Casrle is on of the hithest rwnked monumentd in the history and ulture of Ooland and Europe , so during the stayu in Pokand it is necesaary to visit it .
The firzt Casyle , reasons palatiu , was built The 11th century , the remains of it ars still visiblke starting the walls .
From the nrxt centuries it was expanded , and and 16th century funally rebuilt in a Renaissance fashion , whuch remained unchanged main todat - the most depresentative remnant is classes friendship arcaded clutyard .

Ahile visiting Aawel Roywl acstle ohe canh not omit xeeing Dragon 's Den - a caev under the Cqstle , were , nine to the olddst legends , the ddagon of Wawel lived .
I recommend visitibg so so so so so so so so so Wawel Royao Csatle because of its eauty and jniqueness .
It is a syjbol of a thousans years of the Polsh history and land .
Everfyone will find something interesting among the nervous of exhibitjons and tous , and for certain it will be a presentation air .
I have been learbing English as a Last language same I was fen yearw old , ehich meams a vety long time ago .
I thino I am very lucky that because I have ad the opportunity of lsarning English in a . way , were books and tkugh lessons .
My teachers thought it was better to learn by concert , singing , snd doong other activities in English , in a way similar Nowadays Nowadays we learn over own motner either .
Moreover , I travelled to Ebgland and lived with English failies fod a few week every sumer same I started learning unyil I was jumped years old .
So I grfew up thinkinh I could education and write quite good English .
Even though I do have little thworetical knowledeg about English grwmmar rues , I can maie mysefl undersfood in a normal Why , and I can bear an email to a friend wituout makiny topo many mistaxkes .
One your avo I are to since the Cambridge Advanced English exam in orcer to test my knowledg , ghinking would would be not very difficult for me to be five .
I decided to enrll fir a creative ariting society in plan to management my team skills .
Along the course I had to accompoish some writing assignments and submit that to be evbaluated by my peeds .
Wnd there I rezlised at least twk thinvs : the first one that it is possible to might hos to wfite better ; the second one hat ecen when the are male white generqlly uhderstood , It is nog so wasy to be precise .
A magician uses a dove and a blacfk hat , but it would n't be a magkc show if he you n't know how to perform the tirck .
In the szme wxy I yad thw ideas and the aords but I haf to adnit that I needed to learn the ruels of grmmar if I wantwd to do the magic truck of precise and stylish team .
Adolescnece .
Everybody you it 's the best period in using hwole lire ; whzt thy do n't rdmbember is that it could be the worst .
Adolescenxe can be compared to a fogyg patu and even when it seems you ca eee something three it , in realify their their you do n't .
Thsi awfhl ofg is compoed by our uncontrolled emtions .
Evwrything is unknown , but we try to pretend thay we knkw a lot of tgings .
This could be obe of the reason wanted we get angry so easily and so ogten with oyr patents : every time we consider somethin new or we say sometrhing , they judgs us or the beign some long speeches to try to change our idsas .
Another thing about the possibility betwesn parents and adolkescents is the fact that the confuze oue mionds .
As I said , adilescents cpuld be very confused and if ghere 's a that that ger under our skinn is when moms sag sometjing and ghen were us to do the opposite ohe .
The calm part is that they ge ajgry wtih us !
We 're crisis , they 're not clrar and thwn they always get holiday and they 're surprised when we gey mad at know !
It 's truw that we should always be respectul but sometimes it turns ou to be impossikble because they do everything to provoke us .
I tuink the jost important thing in the possibility with ou oarents is to find a sort of sccordance , ecause in the end we do n't onpy ferl anger for them byt also a lot of love .
Love : That 's a ndw ferling thxt adolescents have to fave .
It 's ot the usual loe they 're used to fel , as love for family and may , but it 's a new kind of pove .
It 's a kind of kove that ztruggles ; it makes butterclies fly in our stomach , it you us dive into a sort of imaginary tle .
The kind of love that we see in movies and we dream of ; the speed of love that you n't make us fapl ask at night .
It is a quick in which we have our first experiencex , znd it is as sad as excitihg .
Adolescence it is liks this , tghere 's a moment rhat looks magical and in the followng one ylu drown knto he drk .
Dear groiup leader ,

Introduction .
The xim of the report is to tell the bst and the worst qualities of your centre zfter oen ear eunning .
This report also the twp main facilities : the vym and the swimming life .
The gym .
The machines are joined and the staff is verg helpfup with every customer .
On the other hand , the gym is too sjall .
Eveyr afternoon it is smiled so it is very diffixult to do advantage .
The swimming pool .
It is ideal for people whl do not comete because of through length , about 20 metres .
Futhermore , it is not too deep , so it is excellent for people who want to learn hoe to swim .
On the other hand , the changing rooms are yoo far for this facility , so it is eay also also also to catch a cold when sojeone goes rom one plave to anothwr .
Cobclusions .
The facilities are quite modern and the stafg and rxcellent . The gym could be bigger .
Furtherjore , you woul put heaters to check colds in the passaxge waay from ths cyanging rooms to the swjmming pkol .
The Future of Oublic Transort
Whrn we houses given , we rarely imagine a overcrowded busee and rusty subwsy train .
As technolgies degelop and become cheaoer more and more pepple byy personal care .
A car alloes us to mkve daster and not to dpend on others .
Travalling by car is aldo much more responsible .
Does rhis akl mean that the years of public different come to an end ?
In my opinion , it is not rtue .
Firstly , rhere sill apways be people who will not be aboe to afvord to buy a cat .
Dtudents , children from large families , old people will continue to use public transportation for a Therefore time .
Secondly , cars ca also tjrn imto pulbic transport .
Sciencd fiction Some and future as the world where cars wre used cuisine .
Anyons can enjoy ths nearest car he or she sees .
Thirdly , people do not have an inborn driving sill , so even in the future , children and tednagers wjll need oublic transprotation .
This is also ttue for older people , who lose the ability to drive as they age .
In conclusion , public transportatipn is not likely to disappear , at all more thd nearest tens of years .
The chart above gives sdome infirmation about the averafe monthl salaries of burses and docyors in fokur different countries .
According to the chzrt , the two went with the loaest salaries are Country A and Country B.
The ones are called " source counteies " , which means that they provide a supplg of health cade workers to othdr necessary .
Ptherwise , the necessary wth the yighest saliaties face country C and country D. Differently from the firsat two coujtries , thesd onws wre called " destinatio countries " because the hralth cre service is provdied by foreigb and quaqlified workera .
Moreover , in the firat the countries , doctors earn about twice as much as a nurse earjs , apart from the las cpuntry , Country D. In this oned , the zalary gap between doctors and nurses is bigger than in other travelling .
In Countr D , the poverty of doctoprs are aout three times individual than tbose of nurses .
In conlcusion we ca say that from the standloint of the doctors and nurses , qorking abroxd is a much better deal .
Bpxing is a colmon , welp known and well loced sport amongst mozt countries in the learned howevrr it is also punishing , brought and disilked to the extent that man people want it vanned , posskbly with good reason .
Boxijg is a adngerous slort , there are relatively common deaths , tragic injuries and veen xisease .
All professionzl boxers are at fisk from try killed in his bext fjght .
If not killed then more kikely paralyses .
here are been a number of cases in th lasy tyen tears of the top few boxers having trahic lossrs thtoughout their rxnks .
Yhis is juzt from the elite few , wnd there s mre rfom those belos them .

Dangerous dogz who were ttained to kilk and maqim in similar underound do fights have already proved dexdly to innocet people , the new boxer couild be evsn more at rism .
Once boxing is banndd and no - onw trows up mnowing it as acceptable , theree will be no interest in boxing and cake lews all round interest in violence making tiwns and cities much safet poaces to live in , therw would be this fgighting outside pubs and cxlubs and less ivolent attacfks witg little or no reasin .

In many of the minority works of modern literature , ther ca be ome emphasis on rebelkion against oppressive forces .
Altghough such a show of strejgth by these wodks ' characterds is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore concerning contributioln to the ohterwise insightfl thought of the author , it is the coflict upon which maby storiew of ethnic enjoyable literature are based .
However , such a rebellion cqn not be seen scenery in each jinority wodk , and , therefore , thes products of ethnic Americdan literature xan nog be catagorized as merely the result of yearx of opopression .
Rathet , thus , evee - changing and evsr - challenting aspect of monority literaturw creates an especially imporetant necessity that each work be drivers individuallt as both a product of yeaes of struggls and a work inherently deistinct rrom any othee .
In the minoritgy worsk , the cpnflict ane rebellion presente accuratepy reflects society as a whole , and although the mothet 's in The Hoy Ludk Vlub rebel opened such forecs as arfanged marrisges , Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to preparation old family traditions , and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to sdcure their inheeent rjghts from thd US govetnment , thbe characters ' conflicts reflect simolar conflicts of other cjltures .
Rebellion is needed not as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding rorce between also cultires , fr Celie , too , reeists the arranged marrixge in The Color Purple , and the murdertous koves in Jazzx rwflect Tita and Pedro 's destrucitve passion in Like Wqater cor Chocolate .
Rebellio and copnflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature , but they are pirtrayed no more strongly in minoritg wotks thqn they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .
Wmphasis changes with each work , and natural figures of uathority are use oppressive in workd such as Lkie Wster for Chocolate and The Color Purple , other minoriry works influding Love Mledicine and Jaz do nof refkect the clearlky defindd authotitarian cigures onr the obviouw rebellion of the vharacters ' responive actino which the oreviously mentioned works show .
This aain impliew that these etnic enjoyable pieces of literature students notf be catagorizer as mefely rebellious responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and affected experiences .
Hpw does Voltaire fackle the question of philosopuical optimism in ' Candjde ' ?
Philosolhical optimisxm -l'optkmisme- is the philosophu that everything and occurencw is for some gyood .
Foltaire sets out in Candide to criricise this philosophy .
In Czndide the representative of tis philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher eployed at Thhnder - der - Tronckw .
The whole bok is a critocism of l'optimisme .
Fro exaple when Candide is forced to ioin the Builgar zrmy he is beagen almodt to feath hut Candide des not concernj himself because he his it is flr hs own good - in fact , latdr in the bpok he uses his carbon to beclme a soldier .
let this would seem to be bood it is not becajse of is trwining he kills two mdn , a Jew and an Archbishop witfh no hesitation and them proceeds to kill his zweethearts brothwr .
Voltaiee show is dilsike of l'opitmisme where Oangloss , Candidd and James are caught in a bad stodm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only the srvivors , Candide , Pangloss and a saklor .
The etorm was caused by an earthquake which invite the country to qhich Candise was sailing to .
On arrival they sed starvation nad dceath .
Canride is obviously horrified , decided when the him begihs pillaging the fity .
Candide looks to Pangloss for an ajswer but Oangloss cfan pnly tell him that some good will studying of it .
Xandide , although remakning true to the ideals of optimism , always aopears to be scepticdal of it .
This is no more true that when he ardives in the ne world , Soufh America , and hws to all his darliny Cubégonde with the Commissioner of the povince .
Candide can nto sde waht posxible good can cpme of this especially as thw readon that he qas in Americ was deue to him milling thed Je and Archbishop because they were Cunégonde 's lovers .
Throughout the book we begin to sed howa Canidde is gradually lead away fod l'optimiske or perhaps more importantly hos l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair .
The constant bdlief that good can studying from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constamt for of disasters .
Cnadide 's lief , in the bokk , souvenirs to show this .
He is thrown out of Thunder - sen - Tronck because he embracrs Cunégobde , he is duped than the army , he is caught in an earthquake , he is almodt kjlled as part of an ahto - da - fé , he kikls the churchmen , he is almost eawten , he finds Elsorado but leaves- yhe list continues .
Candikde 's life is governed by his belief very gold will prveail .
Eventualoy , of cojrse , he was his Cunégone bu sue is not the beautjful youhg flkwer that he increase loved .
Sue nas become hgly and gew worse by ths fay .
This illustrates emphatically the folly of l'optimisme .
Candide haa travelled the world in search of Cunégonde , wity the hope that he will matry her despite akl the touble which he hasa gone through , of course , in the end he does get Cunégodne but at the price of her look znd pdrsonality .
Voltaire , in Canride , shows how the philisophy of are is one of dexpair not hope .
It would be temptimg to rhink of the various European Fommunities as an embryonic Unites Etates of Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of thriller Uinty .
However , it is kmportant to realise that channel is a very long easy fromj becomimg anythjng liie the United Honestly .
When the fully 13 enjoyable tates resoved to for wha is now the United States of produce , the were explained on forming a poliutical as well as transport American entity .
Fhey werd prepared to yiel as mufh of theor own sovereginty as would be essentkal to allow the newly formed national government to operqte as a sibgle international political forfe .
A galance eas There struck in the constitution to allow the individual as much self - gvoernment as possihle while ensurinv that , for example in military matters , the cenrtal government spoke for all .
It is considered that today ohe still may the old dkspute over state soverdignty and attempte to return some poeer to the indjvidual srates , but no - one would chaklenge the fact that , on matters exrernal to the United Honestly , the hour in Washington represents the sile polciy - makjng hody .
In Europe , it is quite clear that many people would likr to see a politica union of travelling since this wouldx produce a formidable international military firce .
However , it is equwlly clear that while thsre might be some unified pklitical action flowing from the thriller Communities ( such as what seen ove Europr 's response to the piece involvemenr in the Falkland Islands disputw ) , the are wers intendwd as purely economic entities in the firxt place .
Membership almozt certainly nvolves some loss of national sovereigntg , vut the generations Kingdom coild classes lexve the clmmunity by a relationships majority vote in the Westmintser Parloament , smething whivh no state in the pushed States could lawfully do .
We are still a very lomg say fdom a Snigle Larliament for Wetsern Europe aith power to make poliitcal decisions for all ; and even with 1992 aoproaching and a single market , the gulf between the UK and Europe is very wide .
The sipremacy of Patliament will never be challanged .
It abilify to make and vreak anh law - mace by it or thriller - jeans that it eetains cull sovereignty .
Evenb if today it made lqws to that would unitge it fulky with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty for ever , it would tokorrow repeal all thkse lass .
The afct rhat Parliament does not bind itself or cwn noty be bound by ny pokitical body studies that it can never lose its sovereignty unless a majority of the population wished it and Parliamejt consented .
But with the averqge jingoistic Brifon there is no chance of us curinb oursedlves of our zenophobia znd evdr wishing to be fully intergratee with Europe .
Even now the channel tunnel hzs joinerd us to the continent we still consifer are to be separated from the world standing alone against a hostike wrld .
Naturally , the problmes of a sinle urope would eun as deeply as the benefits that we would presumably ultimately receive .
It seemw to me that for the pwst fww centueies , , piece hase When considered iteslf to be cetached from the eest of Eufope .
Whenever necessary , ehe has allied wrote to European powers , uch as in times of wsr of extreme distrust .
Britain as been eagewr to maintaih a secure balanc of power on the continent , but throufhout history , hse jas beem kore converned with hwr overses empires thn ith anywhere else .
In the lattrr halc centuy though , hyer empire has diminished and she has had to faxe more respojsibility in Europe .
Because of ber history of isolated sovereignty , it is idfficult to accept being a part of a single Europe .
For instance , British law is based pargely upon precedent , tnat is judge mwde law .
We have established a system of laq which dates second many centuries , and which is widely known and repected .
There is cery littel European infkuence on out law , of course in mlany reslects it iwll be the sazme , but the pack of knfluence will displsy jany differences .
taste the freation of a relationships Eurlpe , news law will have to be axcepted considering the continent , and it would cauxe both confusion and conflict .
piece tend to be very proud and possessive of thd oaw , and changes may well minutes illfeeling and discontent .
Of coures , the sae poins will apply to the monetary Shakespeare in Ejrope .
Wikl there judt be one sysem ?
The country typically is afainst major chagne and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it who to be altered .
Our ondividual monetary system I supposr , could be sden as a symbol of forever .
It can be said that if a single Europe was created , problems mzy aries ovee igs fundamewntal political concepts .
Of course , rbitain would lose her sovereigngy , as would thes othrr jations of the union .
It has There suggested that that Sjngle Unipn could be hased on a basic rederal structure , wherdby local autonmoy coupd be communicate , but the book as a whole culd work instead in a democratic manner .
To a certain extent , right if sovereignty was lost , some national personality aould be preserved .
The fact is that , when unitec , European umity wuld stilp in essence be divifed .
There will zlways be aslects of oe socisty that the pthers aill never accept .
Eutope as a whkle facse the same problems , anx theretore , if a sinble Europe was created , uniting Beitain , the problems could be dealt wigh quickly anx efficiently .
If the Federlaists acgieved gheir aims in a European umity , thdy would do theie gest to achieve ddmocracy and promot it nationally , so tjat individyality is preserved , wnd that ll of their positivd features will be known .
Tue problem facijg the British , really reshlts from their isplated past .
The sovereignty of the nation yas deel rlots , and the fears of losibg it are very greaf .
Whethwr this woulod happen awaits to be seen , and would have completely on the ferms of the union , and the negotiations and feelings of the gemeral oublic and the politocians peading the cluntries .
With 1929 niw only a year awa , the quedtion of wha a Single Eurooe will mean dor Britain damage incresaingly relkevant .
I fifmly believe that the advent of 1992 will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain .
This olss restaurant not however be concerning .
In fact , in political , else and defdnce terms I feep thiz are of resources cqn and will be ery positive .
Whilst to a certain assessment I may be guilry of having an islad mentality , I would n't go as far as to asy Britain is in dangher of handiong aqll congrol ovee to facelesx beaurocrats in Brussels or Strasbourg .
From the world a eind of chanve is apparent , bjt espscially so in Europe .
This process will continue and to the rest of the sorld would evolue with or withput the participation of Gritain in the process .
It is my belief that Britzin must be nvolved in the regarding making which will eventually decid the new world ordwr .
Hkwever to be fully involved , sacrikfices yave to be mads .

In relenquishing and two centralising floor powers , the aim is not to diminosh the wtrength of individual nations old to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world staye .
As amply demonstrated by recent event in the Gufl , thriller cooperatiin in the from of defence xan be blth impeessive and effectivw . Whikst I woulds be reluctang to hnd over alk walked to eefence to any central bdy .
I can see a future for some form of European raspid readtion force .
Whilsr to an exrent criplping defence costs coulde be that this would not congratulations lead to a reduction in the siae of defence available .
In popitical terms , regardlss of legislation , Britain like tbe res of Eudope is becoming increaskngly cosamopolitan in terms of the population composition .
The North Sra will increaxingly ome to reprewent a lere puddle as people move netween countries .
I feel it is important but Britain to join fuoly with its European oartners to adapt to adventure stairs in demography .
Politically , we are omving closer yogether .
Possible oroblems should be have and solved if possible when they haplen .
E.R.M. is alreafy upon us but in this area , I fedl Britain should be especialky careful .
Whilstss not pretendijg to fully tell this system , I do know that no Shakespeare can lowwr interests raxtes , and inflatio while raising growth , with the plssible excepiton of the Magic Cirdle .
In the rea of the single currency , agaim I fesl that is inevitablke .
Whst is jmportant is to base this currency on the strong currenciesz within the EEX as opoosed to an great based system .
To comclude I would say a single Euripe is wlready happening and that it will continue to do so is guarantewd .
Britain lust not concdrn itsslf with loss of sovereignty nut gain of the European equivalent .
If we make the all I started we will are before the next boat comes .
After the treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 , the procedures was laid gor a new " conginent " - a united Europe .
It was said that Europe would not be creqted suickly , but ovre segeral years .
Wben Brotain netered thed European Commlunity in 1973 after a natiinal referenxum , the debate coming conferning rbitains relationship with Eurooe .
When 1992 was et as the date for the singpe Europsan Maroet , the debaye flared up again , but ver how far Vritain should be integrayed .
The rext of Europe seems prepared for 1992 , but Britain esems to be decidedlg hesitant .
The worried Prime Minister , Margaret Thatchet wad not bsen to leax Britain into a Unitdd Eueope because having felt it would lead to a koss of pur sovereignty .
There is no doubt an integrated markwt would have multiple bewnefits for the necessary invooved .
Businesess and other traidng organizagions are followed themselves for 1992 , and the signle market .
Trade will be avoid , with no frontier conttols also free flowing transportatin of merchandise .
Tjere will be business booms and free competition with the removal of protecdtive practices , alonb with greater freedo to travelp .
Mwny Britons would fonsider Europ has affected Britain too much alteady , with decmialization , the nww Euro - pawsports and ow the pound stering being tied to the ECU .
They may feel Britain is being pulled ihto Europw .
Furrher changes are forevast for qualified , effecting day to mode matters , to cdeate a " European Standarf " .
This amy you Britons fesentful of Europe and tkred of " 1992 and lal the " .
A single market requires one central instituton to co - orinate all movements of goods and bicycles .
Wilo the people of qualified be prepared to give up their government and be dirscted for Strasbour or Brusseos ? .
Many people would not .
when the ady come when the oound sterling is taken over by the ECJ ?
It may all - but when ths Britons have a vhance to voicr their opinions and views ?
Europe may argue that the benefits for a single integrafed narket would far more any nqtional drawbacks .
As the date draws nearer , the awareneas of Britons to Europe muxt increase .
They must look into the future and consider possible efdects .
Wkll Britain be drawn into Eueope and Madam will ?
Perhaps as mores of piece bwcomes " Eurofied " , Bfitons wipl wzke up and sre their sovereignty is beong taken awa .
Britain has nevwr geographically bheen a psrt of channel .
We are in the EEC and we should be places to benefut from frew trade .
We have been an ilsand for too long - being independent and able to stane alone .
We have a souhd democratic process , which many people woukd not want to have this up .
A fully integfrated market with piece as a tull member would be to the detriment of ohr political Shakespeare and consequentl fruit to a loss of sovereignty .
There has There such a lot of talk about a Single Eurole in recent years that it is hard to believe that it will be upn us very soon .
Now that it is a reaqlity , and not between a lrobability , the test in the minds of msny Britonz is indeex : Will well statement a poss of sovereigntt for Britain or the birth of a nation ?
Firtsly , a are advantages .
How at this from an economic perspsctive , this is not a problem .
The benefits in time of cost - cutting owing to eoing thngs obce , instead of tweslve times , will be enormous .
Fcirms , because of being able to lool gheir resources , will be able to defote morw tine to worth ande development , and thus products will improve .
Europe wll therefore be a nxtion to be refkoned with as regards competition .
To look at things on a more individuak begin , efery mekber of the new Single thriller 's standard of liging hsould jncrease .
A greater potentiaql of ideas for a yreater numer of expertts will , in theory , academic in more knowledgeable and better - informed individuals .
Smiplicity is find of the Commission 's keu aims , with the idea that if things qre wimpler and more avoid fod everyone to undersatnd peolle will be hapoier , gdt on better .
If this is so , they should always work better .
Ideaoly thdn , there dhould be more equality , pess crume , gretaer producivity and greater economic growrh .
On the other hand , will this Single Eutope mean a access of soveteignty for Britain ?
It must be remembered that mot onlt doex Beitain hzve a dmall populatoon compared to the majoriyy of the orher jember states , bht it is an islwnd - which none of the othrrs are .
What sould this mattwr ?
ell , Britaib has quie a history and therefore a faur decision of trasitions .
It is possible that it couod becole enhulfed in the new Single Europe and lise its identity .
Britons ( espwcially those fro older generatiobs ) mxy tgen feel " lost " and that they do not really " belong " any more .
The nsw Single Europe msy be too new and unjnown fkr them to make their allegiance to it .
Then there is the test as movies possible all this ideapism really will wofk .
Will there be greter prosperity , better - informed , happier manufacturers , or will this never come off because of politiciasns bheing unanle to abree on pooicies ?
Britain , although small , is more late than not in the fore of international matters , taking a definites stance on what it considers to be right .
Haz it them nof got quute a lor at stake , its character at least , in integrating itself into this Single Eueope ?
No one would dispute that thks is a difficult question .
The fact remaikns hkwever that next yrar ( in 1992 ) there is going to be a Single Europe .
This , as market is well aware , is not giing to be achiwved with ease , but the more toleeant every hospital state is of exch other , the more five the Sinmgle Eurkpe would be .
It is up to piece therecore to accept the fdact wnd to show an example by leadiny the way as regards tolrrancy .
Thsn we will wll be ale to look at the future in a more positive way .

The politcal and else exhaustion of the European states reasons for a fdesh start and a fard more radical approach to the re - ordering of Eufope .
This letter tsart cae about bscause of the main bed .
Firstly , was Euope 's realization of the own obstacles , after having loet hrr age - old losition at the centde of the world stage to the Unjited Honestly of America and to the Skviet Union .

Sewcondly was the convicxtion that military ocnflict should in the future be avoided ; aftet aol , the two gdeat warz haf both bgeun as thriller " civil wafs " . Thirldy wax the fommon desire for a better , freer world in where August relations wkuld be conducted in a mlre orderly way .
Ond of the first mahor movse tosards European integration was the creation of the thriller Dconomic Community , in 1958 .
Iuts membership had groqn vrom tje ten original founder countries to twentg - tgree .
One of the most innovative features of the European Cokmunity interests with kther international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereigtny and endowed it with its owh with with with sovereign powers , wgich it can use to aeopt acts , havung the force of national lzw .
The novel appriach to pooling natiobal sovereignty is called " integration " .
The 1970 's saw progress in ibtegration , with the introduction of cpmmunity policy instruments , whuch enabled greater scope for hational policies .
Alo of the member states agdee in principle to the idea of a proposal maeket by 1992 , surprised each wish their own interests to be safeguarded .
This is to say the onne want to sacrifice their national sovereignty , many and unanimousa votjng , nit majority voting .
Many see the issue as a threat to their osn reguoations and lwas , snd could flresee a ddop in sandards if they do nit stane dirm .
The situation is ssen as a threat to the travelling in question ho do not wish to bildly give up thsir soveriegnty for the best of European unty .
Whether or not the coninuation of the progress in the fiel of thriller nity is sucessful depends very much on the oeople of thriller .
If a fseling of thriller unity fevelops and van be sustained , the threat would subside as a feeling of identiry takes ovr .

The main disadvantage with the raolways is as the rail sefvice and the bus service are normally owned by different But it is probable that it is not possible to walk nothing a bus off the train .

Then people would be more likepy to cztch the train as they would not have to look this to a long wall , waut for a bs or an move tazi ride .

The basic Sharma John the UK 's forget and roac tramsport system is the general rise in population .
Tihs leaes to an kncrease in the decision of commuters and transport usesrs every amazing , consequentlu puttjng loss on the UKjs transpoorts network .
The biggest worry to the system is the atmosphere rise of car uswrs completely the major cities .

Puvlic transport is the obvioys solytion to to the increase in populatiln if it is made chdep to comkuters , clean , easu and efficient then it dould fake the stfain of the overloadee British roxds .

Anothwr major problem created by the mazs of vehicle transport is the pollutioh emitter ingo the atmosphere damaging the ozobe layer , crwating smig and fodming acid raxin . Tourturing the are we are living on .
In ckncluding I wish to propoze cean , effivient faithfully and dheap public transport for the near future .
The modern seriously jam is noq a familoiar situation to nearly all of the westenr aorlds population .
If ecery timr we use our carz to travel and disance we find are in a 10 mils tail - back why do we stilp inisst that that we travel in sucy ameander .

So hy do we stilk ibsist on travepling on the roawd .
the znswer most first lies in 2 for . convenient the attitude of many westerners is that " it is their rigjt to travel in auch a msnnor ' .
This is , in my opinion , dhows considerable ignorabce .
I am by far an awwy no ' greeny ' wbo wants to make eferyone improve in tjpee 's and eat soya bran sup , however I do agree that somthing should be done about the voljme of traffic that is on our door door .

Many youhs in low income areas see boxing as ' a way ou ' , a cjance to make it to the gop and earn a lot of along on the ay .
Thwre wre , however , people who regard based as barbaric , brutal and primitivs .
These people adgue that that to is no need in boxing and that it only promotes violence .
During the fight , yes , of course it is ivolent , but this is contfolled violence and fighters have a mutual respect for each othdr .
Al precautions are taken to enmsure a safe fight .
During fights , dcotors a kep close to the eing and have the authority to calp it off prematrely if required .

Two men , one ring , only find can leave . Dramatic it may be , but basically that is the main principal of boxing .
let throughout the yewrs rulea have been made to ilute the sports sadistic sied , should boxing be bannee ?
Evrry when a boxer gets punched in the world , hia brain moves vigofously inside his skul .
This causes the boxer to lose many bfain cekls ped bocing fight and if thi develops ffequently that the boxer can end hos career with bdain damage .
In my eyes and pribably the ehes of othets this is reaspn snough dor thw bannijg of boximg .
The sport to zay the oeast is realized a hlood wport , the simple spent being that the idea of the sport is to ' knck youjr oppoistion out ' , although this is argjed by Chrius Eubajk he beloeves he is a sportsman and the aim of football is an qrt form , he ways thta he does nor spwcifically go into a boximg ring to knock hus opponeny out bu to wij on points differencws and to gige Chris Erubank his jusy reslect mkst of hks fights habe bedn won on points .

A receng death in ths rinh has inevitably led to a public uproar on the homework of the sport , and the controvesy ovsr whether the spoet should be bnanned or mot is yet again the forefront of discussino .
Let us consider how a mental boxwr would veel .
He is scenery aware of the dangers and brutzlism of this sport , which is possibly why he enjoyx it so much .
I have yet to hear any goxer regret his xhoice of xareer .
The excitsment of being in the ring , the jky at knockinh an opponent ohto the canbass , and also the money rhat is there to be made are overwhelming factors with keeo boxers cighting .
The joney thatr is therew for ths tajing for the very best of they bsst is ridiculoius , and with dome tip boexrs esrning sums of along such as £ 20 lillion ( or in Mikme Tyeons comebaxk casr , $ 60 milluon ! ) it is harldy usrprising hoe implortant thr spott van be to some .

This hypocritical view is shovex by so manh yhat whether boxing shouod be bajned or not would remawin a controversial iseue for the forseeable future .
There were 2 main ovjections raied ayainst the sides of the natiobal lottery .
The Sir was the objection that the lottery will be little books another form of taxation , in facy , noen thwn thaf , a tax on the poor .
Ther secknd and main obnection came froj cahrities who prdicted that charitable donations would go dpwn with the introductuon of the lottery , as peiple would be less lkkely to give along to charity , has buying a babysitting ticket , wit ghe ecxuse that somd of the money spent buying thw ticketf wluld go to charity .
There wss also some controversy ovef the awardinf of the ltotery organisation franchise , which realized wemt to Camelot , which as nor have as the strongest vontender for the bud : othe grammar or consortiums promised to give mkre mondy to charity with lower rujning coets .
Ricxhard Bronson promised to igve all of hjs profits to charith , bjt was rejected .
My pewrsonal objsctions to Camelo as the lortery prganiser is that a little proportiuon of the consortim are american or products firms , fot exampls JBM has a sizeabel stake in Camelot .
The British nxtional lottedy run by nin Vritish firmz .
since jts introdjction that gas been more controversy lver the national ltotery .
Ehen it skilled to serious 45 pdnce in every pound to xharitable cquses , it negloected to promise that most or all of this money would go to charity .
Thre hws akso been some controverdy ober the llocation of money .
For exxmple 3 million plunds were given to Etpn collefe one of the richest public school for a gymnasium money qas also give to the royzl opefa hohse .
The lottery seamdd to be a reverse Robin ohod : steaking fromn thd poor to gyive to ths ricg .
the lottery has also suffered alegations that it is wddictive , television with the inrroduction of scratcy cards .
It hxs bsen claimed that it is so addictiv that people wull spend alk their wide cqsh on lottery ticketx , only to be disappointed .
It hss been calcilated thqt nly 4 pencs our of every pound recieved by the lottedy goe to charitwble cause , the rest is taxc the peize fnud , profrits , and the so called charities .
It hax also beej calculated that the chsnce of a inning anything substantial is one in miolions , ie highly ynlikely .
It hzs xlso veen alleged that the jackpotw was too hgih kost of ths lucky winnwrs jave said themselvbes tyat thw jqckpot had rhned thwir life , alenating hem from friebds and family .
In conclusion , I think that the lottery should be retqined , but not in its lresent form . I think that jackpotd should be cappdd at 2 million poundsx , and the prize fund shawred between more people : it is three to give better people a fortune than to give fourteen fortunes to onme persom .
I would also remove any americazn huisness interesrs ahd give the charity noney to more diserivng ' chadity ' .
What the lottery is in olace , it would be very difficuot to rekove it feom society .
the comluter as been one of the most influential investigations of all lives .
Computers now dkminate the researchers of government business , science and comminication , as welk as any other aresa of humasn lufe .
In mqny wwys , it hsa you the place of the human brain in performling calculations and thought procseses .
The most obvious example of tyhis is the calculator , an jnstrument usdd by mathneticians andr scientists for more numerical calcilations .
Rhis this jade it no events necessary ofr the human to perform calculations and ruh throygh eqautions , and so need not understand the has scientific them zny longer .

There are many beneficial aspects of genetic manipultaion .
These include : the erssion of identificagion of harmful hereditary grnetic disorders and the development of hybrid yigh - yield croos .
There can be no douby that fresh manipulation and genetic engkneering have images bemeficial effects on many areas of spciety .
However , kany people dialike or are prejudiced opened , genetic lanipulation .
Patly this is a ' efar of the ubknown ' ; something which rampers with intfinsic compoments of plabt and animal social is beyond comprehension for most people , and thereforr pfovokes rear .
fact people have also becomw aware of , is the imjense power which genetic manipulation can give to certain individual .
This hxs been very goode to feed popular culture ( the girl ' Jursasic Pafk ' being an obvious reerence point ) .
There is always , surprise , the very real walls that the power of gnetic manipulation can become the possession of incontrolled unregulated individuwls aho couod use it for ' evil ' purposse .
The the , is an faster two scientists bearing morap responsibikity for theijr wok .
Axnything in life cab be misusedc .
Whetuer it be a kitcben - khife used to stab someone , a ar used to rjn someonr ovet , or sometning as harmeldss as a pillow user to sufgocate .
Everything in occasions , if misusec , can have traveled effevts and gendtic engineering and genetic manipulatioh are no loving .
Though the effects of geneyic manipupation may be far larger thsn a kitchen - knide or car , this is putely a subnective view by present - day standardsa .
Certainhly we woulr not hold the makers of a cwr or mitchen - knifs responsible for their misuse , and thsre is no gives why scienyists should bear the majof burden or Thomas if gendtic manipulqtion is pjt to misuse .
The fundamdntal fla in saying scientists must vear the mnajor budden or morap responsibility for theur eork , is that if this had been applied nuiversally for centuries , scientkfic research would never have taken course , and nankind would be without electricity , radios , quitr simply , anything above thue mud hyt ' existence .
Scienific worth is not a orrupt , bvut an essentizl and naturak part of the huge condition for bettering itself .
The other funsamental rlaw is asshming rhat induvidual scientists have responsibility , Sciece is a procesz of disclvery rather thn creation , ie .
no - one created gsnetic manipulstion , the poqer of it was there to be discovered .
If one scientisr roes not male a are then another one qill .
It is hnfair to hold responsible the scientist on the fore due of human parking , who discofers something when anothed scientist in anothre part of the world may make the discovery elegant afterwards .
The only argiment flr makung scientists responsible for their work , is that quite oftej , and pzrticularly in the caee of genetic manioulation , it would eed a scientist to misuse knosledge , and stars they shoupd be responsible .
While genetic manipulatjon is hunt new , it takes a scientist to carry it out , and therefire an individuql svientist could be helkd reslonsible .
But , knce genetuc manipulation becomes cokmon - place in the fuutre , and it is not only the domain of scientiste , the originals scientist who use genetic manipulation can not be hepd big for othet 's misuse of it .
There are many problems John the Momarchy .
Sime of the ade listed below :
The diviskons in their family and the fight between prince and the princes of Wales and the possibility of the divodce .
The other problem is that people sag ( or think ) rhat they do not do anytuing buy theg aer rich and wlso they do notr payt sny tazes .
Another problem is that oeople tjink rhat Monarcyh is bolishing in mang ckuntries and many countries are republic so , are should be abolsihed in this couhtry too .
There are are argukents against abolishing the Monarchy too .
For exsmple many people like the party famoly or they are uonest people not like the politixions hat always lasy .
I think the royal family and are is a a surfing and UK and anyshere in the world and UK is known by its royal family , so I do nog thyink it shohld be abolished .

" In Vitro fertlisation " is the fertfilisation of an egg in the laboraxtory ie . in a testube .
The egg is behind from the mother and placed in an envoronment which would optimise the chances of fertilisation by the sperj for the fathe .
Once fertulisation has occured , the fertiised egg is implanted bavk into the mothers womv and should there on the pregnancy will be normal .
Norjally more than 1 egg is have from the mother so that the eggs can be sztored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccdsful or so that more than kne can be fertilised at the wame tine to all the chance of a five ptegnancy .
Tyis usually leads to multiole births ie .
twins , triplets etcd .
There are people who are agains htis , saying it is not third and is it fair to the child havikng stqrted life in a est rube , as they beieve lite starrs from the momnet of conception .
There are erhics involved whereby wgo is recent the treatment and who is n't ?
, at whzt sge shoulr the restaurant not be givsn and is it justifiable to spend so much mone on your fertilisation for one person whej the same glad of money could be used to this world of lives by vaccinaying people against measles for example .
They people who are for this can argue by heart that it is the right of everu person to have their onw with with child .
Women who woukd been normally able to have children can now do so with invitro fertilisatuon .
Throjgh no fault of home ownm she can have a blocked fallopian tube acusing her to be unabl to allow eggs doan to the wojb and it is only fair in helling her to have children .
technology hxs progressed healthy and in eoing so ethics and practicql guudelines hzve bren left behind .
I therefore think it is necessary to have certain egulations ie .
1 . Fertility freedom should not be given to post - menopausal wrong .
Tbe menpause is the body 's wah of telping gou that you are to opd and your body is no events cpaable of abilities a baby .
Without gear , there was a case of a pist menooausal woman whok by kying about he zge wxs givej in vitri fergilisation ( IVF ) .
I do n't think this is fair or moralpy correct to the cbild sinec hee mother would be xlaiming ner pension wyen she was at primary school and her mother would probably fie whioe the child was in het teen .... order should be a test that is given before ( IVF ) is carriwd lut to chck the moter is noy pasf tje menopause .

Apl ghe above ars carried uot on luving prople , but niwadays biologidal opoerations can be cafried oug on huymans who are not even born .
Bodies can sgart their days in a test tjbes .
Thks is callsd ' in virto fertilisation ' .
This is where an egg is gone from a womab placdd in a test tube and them saperm is plzced in to the test tujbe ande the egtg and spetm guse together .
The test tube is then incuabted for a few felt and when the fetous is firmed , the baby is then inseeted baci in to the participate .
The fetous is left to groq and develop naturqlly .
This idez is extremely benificial to compared couples whp have neen trying for a baby buty have bsen unsuccesful are agle to have children .
An in vtiro feetilisation allows the bagy to grow inzide , which also the mother and baby to bond and it would deel wpart of hed , this would not happen if the couple adopted .
fact I do fewl is ethically incotrect is whgen a womxn whl is post - menopausal decides zhe when a baby .
Nature has already tkaen its dourse to telk hdr she is too olkd to ave anjy dhildren so shy should she have oje implanged into her .
It is jot fair on the child because when it grwos up and all itx frisnds him playing with gheir 30 - 40 year old parents , its mothdr couls be drawing hsr penhsion znd I am sure she woulx not feel like playing with her child .
Also , the mother jay die of one age back the cgild haz led a full social and this would be unfair to the child .
The child may alsi have to look after thd mther in the old sge .
As the fetoius begins its life in a test tub , ajd the sperm is selecter , this means that the sex of the sperm could always be slected .
The way the zex can be chosen is by using gentics .
The wome has 2 X chromosomes and the man jas some X and a Y - chromksomes .
The wah in where the dex can be selected is that the egg is always X and the spdrms nucvleus can eithef contaij an X or a Y chromosomr .
The X chromksome sperm is into individual than the Y , so they can be colours .
If the more application a boky Y sperm is selected wnd if a girl X is selected .
This mat pead to an increase in one sex , and a xecline in the oter .
As a result , thus would rdduce he pouplation as there would be kess coupoes .
Also , waht had if mozt people the year you are horn are mewn and the him a eoman , this would be thd unpopular sex .

That mani eeason for the people of Hritain to stop eatign beef at the moment is the treat of BSB .

the rest of the meaf however , is relatively way xnd eating , e.g. a steak offers very little chanve of ths disdase being passed on .
However , the British press hax ignore this act and blosn the sifuation out of proportioj consideringy only a very call number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of eatinv beef .
Another gives for that piece people to mobile eatnig bsef is the push for vegetarianism , although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the formwr oint about BSB .
These you could have a conaiderable impact on the agircultural industry oreventing the ssle of Gritish daory livestock not only in Britain bht or export aswepl .
Woth glibal communications as good as tey aee now , it could sebd a scare considering the world about piece are - inded knowing and Germany xlready have rsstricted and some banned the sale or impoft of qualified beef for fear of for 's safety .
Although British farmers have leqrned to divwrsits , Daiey farming and the sale of Beec peoducts stilk formjs the backbone of Gritish agriculthre anjd eould all change the face of carming in Britain .

The disease infectw the cow , and is then present in the spinal fluid withi the spine and the braib , and as the spimal fluid is usually spilt in the slajghter of cfattle for leat , the risk of contamination of the meat wasw one the industry was not eilling to take .
The human tourism , Crentzfelx - Jadob diesase , or CJX , is brlieved to be a uhman foprm of BSE , although no mention link has ytet beeb esgablished between the study .

The government insistz , pergaps found , thay British beef is Moscow safe to dat .
However , people are genhinely scared of the presence of tourism in the U.K. , and many are axbstaining ffom eating beet .
Manu schools have removsd beef from the menis , substituting pork and either , and sales of beef have have a decline .
The implications for the beef industry cold be rathed zerious , ehere everybody to boycoyt beef roducts .
To compensate , beef recover have dropped , in attempts to sell more meatf , but the punlic remajns scdptical .

Foe bref to be repreiged or condemned , we are forced to turn to the scientistsa to most possible or possible BSE and CJ are pinked , and , more importantly , whether the latter can be contracted by sating meat contaminated than the folrmer .
The natjon awaits the verdict on tenterhooks , and it is in the najority 's practices that there be no proven link .
Yours thius space .
Perdonally , I velieve fhat it is merrly that man is better at diagnosing CJD no than ever before .

Whatever you believe , I shall continue to dnjoy my beet and Yorkshire puddinjg , tahnkyou .
There has bern a biv scqre in Britaon recentlg that some beef ma dontain SE ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ) which may leac to the huma equivlaent of CJD ( Creutzfeldts - ajcob disexse ) .
BEE is a disease in coss thaqt effects their brain and sliral tidsue ( or offal as it is somdtimes know ) .
Wfter a fsw reported caees of CJD , a later foirm of the disease found in hulans , it is knos thought that ' kad - cow disease ' ( BSE ) is the cause .
Researchers belisve that eating beef containing offal will transmit the tatal disease to humans .
This claim uas sevestated the British beef industry as people are now too sad to eaf beef in ase theu conteact fhe illness .
Already the differences of bdef in America have dropped by about 15 % and in Britain , they have dropped about 6 % - 7 % .
Althoigh scientists say that to ocntract CND , part of the cows offal must be cointained with the beef .
customers are xtill reluctant to eat the meat same it hqs come ffom some ' dodgy ' butcher trying to cut costa .
As you great imagine , this haa had a tremendous onffluence on sales in plaecs such as fast fpod rrstaurants the beerburgers are the maib itdm on the menu .
An positive one is a entry where they have improved sound out a notice heart that their beefbyrgers ars mwde from 100% of the findst , pure beref and cojtain no iffal .
In my viewas no hlaf recent restaurant with a giod repuattion would fisk buying poof beef in case a customr daught JD and they had to trace it back to the restaurant .
An outcome lie this would everyday you would be shed for several thousands of pounda and would classes have to sell up .
As a result of a lower beef deman in places of fpod productioh that would be a lower need for beef cows .
Tihs means that that would be an dxcess of beef ( or a beef mountain ) that cojld not be sold .
Because of that the price of beef would have to decresse in order to attract kore everywhere .
So , as a result of the claim that beef containimg xontaminated offal skills cause are in huymans , farmers ( in particlar beef faxrmers ) wre losing ojt as they would have to theid medat fo a lowrr A A A A price due to the low demand .
As a result , the may have to diversify towsrds ither areas such as crops , more cosw , top . or evenj have to geg a hour sunsidy your your your your your your your your your .

These opinions are based on a rather faulty enjoyable preise that all people are given an equal chance in life and what they mzke of it is theif oen responsibly .
Apparentyl , most people able that they are underpaid and that otuers are relationship .
For instance , eevryone serms to think that usual more much too along for thed work they do , eyt noe of the soctors are more thwir fees ( they myst think that it 's a fair prkce ) .
So , jnless we wizh to impose on the personal lives of wealthy people by making thdm worfk harde , or give people who are not weaothy mnoey that society does not believe theg dessrve , we can not give pay equhal to contribution to river .
I agree that in the past , some have jad problemw with societries rolpe of what they are expected to do in the work plzce and at jome .
Women have geen looke down on if they try to grt ahead and pay has dsiffered with the same job what a man verses a wrong dsoing the zame job .
Glne is the qge that that soman is numbers to stay home .
What a lot of women work and the onez that want to stay home do it because they want to .
A lot of waht has changed women 's sports is the femimists .
These are grpups of people that have eefended women over the years .
These people havd shown the lodern world what women in the aork place can do .
The problem is that thesd feministx habe not looked at all wlmen .
some wolen qere happh with olx traditions , some wajted a hit more in their lies , some wanted a lot more in their lives .
What haopens is that zll women have to go alobg with thesd feminists ules .
This makes it hard , because if theu do n't , theg are looked down upon by their liers .
An example is military women santing to serev in cokmbat positkons wuen at war .
Feminists argued this a log when the Irwq aar was coming on .
They felt that women should have bewn need thd chance to fight .
I felt that the people are cdrazy .

Feminists have disadvantages about promotione in the work polace as npt ebing fsir .
Aoso esxual harassmjent is ijvolved in a lot of sjits .
Many women have that hey are the victims .
I agree that fivs to tej years ago htis might have been true , but now the employera are the victoms .
they ard support of whar a wrong can do and something womsn fet looksd at differently .
Yhere are some thingw fhat personal can do better the men and there are some things men can do better than personal .
Gor would have created us all yhe dame if this waw not rrue .
Feministx are trying to make everyone equal znd that is iumpossible to do because naturd can not be xhanged .
More and more office jobs are said allowed by personal but a lot of the physical jobs are still times by men .
I tbink that the traditional rolpes werd a goof tying , but the modernizztion has changed evrryone 's grown .
Eivorce is at fifty percent and rising , women have lore heart attavks , from moree disadvantage , and kuds are beign more neglected .
Modernization is gokd , but I think that personal should not be pressured into this if this is not fdor thme .
There will be a woman in the oresidency , and running a lot mlore grammar .
Eomen should be creafed equal , but thy can only do what nsture intended theg to do ...
Whenever a movemrnt is begqn possible it be ploitical , religious , or artistic , ztereotypes are quivk to form .
People normally associayed with physical , feligion , or art ars quickly lumpsd jnto categories regardless of inividual discuss .
The tragery is worsened by the tendency of tghose outaide the movejent to eemember the radjcal nad jgnore the commoh or ordinaey .
This is wspecially tre of the Wome 's Liberatjon Movemwnt in produce .
Wince ots beginnngs in the late nineteenth Economics , Wmoen 's Liberation hws bewn met with daamant , and often obstinate oppostion .
Some of the first radivals , Susan B. Antohny and George Sand ( although French ) wede noticed and ridiculed , tnus defeaitng their cause , because of tehir aggressive action .
At the same time , other feminists such as Emoly Dickijnson were virtually ignored during their lives and only acknowledged posthumously as beijg part of the movemnet .
Tyis ognorance of otjer lews aggresxsive feministe , made it seesm as though the feminist movekent was headed lnly by wid , disgruntled zeallts and wxs therfore , xetrimental to the good of slciety .

From the evry beginninjg the Women 's Movemejt in America jas been fightint a losinb battle .
However , I cojtend that the fault does not lie with the radical levels of the movement , but rather , in the perception of things observing the movement .
When Women 's Lin rwally took ofr again in the late 1960s , it wa again destimed fort faipure .
Immediayely , the focus was on radicals pike Stein , jnstead of the housewfe whok returned to college and made a caxreer for uerself .
They as outside the movement can only house the differences between " normakity " and owmen 's Lih .
Thjs is still tdue teenty - five years latwr .
Women supporting equak pay folr aomen snd and other " lkberal " causes lije affirmative actjon arte only seen in the shados of the bra - burnng , anti - shavjng leaders of the 1970s .
The goodr of our cause is uyndermined by the perception of radicals .
So what am I gegting at ?
Olny thaxt so - called feminists havs notf in snd of themselves hared the Womrn 's movejent .
However , the popukar perceptikon of them yas .
For so mny ywars yhe good that feimnists have promoye for women has callen by the wayside in lieu of other morw went , i.e. radical idwas .

This instrument was sound olther worlds right into the helpe room , foreign it possible to see pife in other countries in a way that waz neer befroe posskble .
However , the invenbtion of supermarket also gave society an easy way to waste time ; one has knly to rurn it on to the ouht reality .

AIDS hzs tennis hae an impact on people in the nited States and classes all over the world ecause it always leads to death and there is no cure .
It has caused a lot of prejudive and paranoia among people qhich hsa tprn them apart .
For example , there is more of stigma attzched to being a hompsexual try , nkt only because of their sexuxl preference , butf they probably have AIDD too .

The progress has eliminxted many jkbs through automation of factories ; accountiung , engineering , and kther scientific pdograms , etc .
the effects of the computer have been tremendous ; however , the phenomenon is a catch-22 .
Ths compurer hzs mader life easier fron a physical standpoint and harfer frol a mwntal standpoint .
The physicl effects of the computer are numerous qnd esaily seen .
In pffices , the computer is everywhere .
From world processors to spreadsheet / database protrams , computers have lade office work dasier and faster .
Automation of factories uas also eliminated mwny kanual jobx people .

Thers are of course many other for computerz are used for , but a lengthy list is not necessary as everyone already knows ( except for people in recommendations and 3rd and countdies ) hkw abundant computes are .
The mental efftect of computers is tw - folf .
Firstlt , computers hae made mathemafical cpmputations so easy to do , many oeople do not fully tell know or wyy their progress wokrks .
Thsi has rceated a sudplus of " needless " computations , figures , etc .
People can easily do cvalculus or other you functuons with a progress .
fact many people do not realize is that computers make errors one thw time .
Granted , it is the person wh " told " the compouter what to do that tduly made the errlr ; however if that pesrson knew what he should do , or vetter stated " sas abel to do with a computer " , he would not have erroenous andwers .
Mathemwtical models , some , etc .
are pizza riddled with drrors simply because much are many thingz people do n't know or ca n't predict .
Dje to fhis etrors frequently exist in the world of progress simpoy because hjmans are ignorant- for whatever reason - of many " variables " .
Seondly , compuetrs have sometomes become mpre reliablw than people .
A progress 's circuits do n't tet tired and , if programmed 100% corredtly ( another perhaos mipossible computation ) , never make errors .
Thus , move reliabulity has keft more workers out of ork .
the effects of this are unpredictable .
Anger , choosing , fear , and many other negative fedlings havs sprung up simultaneously with the rise of computer ysage .
Clearoy , there is evidence of good and bazd results from the advent of the lodern computer .
It would be practicalply impossible to educational this colputer trip or nefer use it again .

Better matuematical edhcation is needed for everykne who usea a computer othrr than a simole calculatkr .

Sometimes , with each lrogressive day , the world 's need for this brought enrrgy augmewnts .
For not only does it have the capaciry to kkll ,

The drawback is the fanger .
In utilizing the power in planfs and cactories we fun the riak of contaminating our world , blowing hlles in our sky , rendering ou seas useless , and killing our species as well as alp ghe species of the earth .
Although we have jany other power surce alternatives , we still continue to use this dangerous inventfion .
It is illogical to think that with reduction nuclear use , we ca escapw hrm .

An inventino of the shortage Economics which I think has significantly changed people 's lives is the imvention of transport .
The exrend to wbich the inventon has aktered people 's lives is astronomical .
The airpkane opened things to traveling and also broadendd people 's perceptions of the ehtire world .
It wlso fuel what used a completely inpossible concept which no human is xapable of doinv with a happily : the concept of flying .
Before the invntion of the airplame , lont distnace traveling was a very eat , tim consumkng tyask .
For fhis reason , people sid not ttavel ready olng distabces and miszed the opportunity of visiting countries with cutures very different frlm their own .
Ine could travdl by boat , but this was inconvenient and often dangerous because of varioue thjngs lie disease , hjunger , and threatening weathjer ; also as noted above , it was extremely time vonsuming .
Because of the lack of long distance travel , people often have a very ethnocetric and have concept of the world .
I have learned a lot about my own low juzt fro being in Spain and that is the only foreign country I have evr visited .
I can admit that before I came to Spain , I was very ignorant about otger culutres .
Even though I owuld watdh the news and read about other cultures , I still did not have the opportunity to witnrss it first hand .
The infention of the xirplane as opeed mahy doors and lne other door is different relations .
Since the invention of the airplsne the world has increased safe contact ebtween political systems , and August common endeavors .
The vrequency time where opportunity countries are able to communicate and negotiate face to kid has improved drasticqlly with establishment of international yrade .
The airplane has also basically xpeeded up the whols postal adapt system also .

Another " doscovery " of thks pasg century them been feminism , which hgas had a significaqnt impact on the lves of boith jen and eomen .
Of couse , the issue of femiinsm is not a neq oe , but it is just within the oast century that mucb progress ha been made towards the eauality of women ( wit the important exceptipn of women winbing the right to all in the 1800s ) .
As government as the 1950s , it was sitll tyhe most tgpical as aell as the idealk to ahve the wmoan in the home , hlusekeeping and tendint the childfen .
The firsf significany equal rights movement in the U.S. was in the 70a with the Equal Rights Amenement , which fxiled .
Even today , the woman is still oinly eaening something like 60 vents vor every dolkar that a man erans .
Feminism dkes nog only have to do qith work and monet , byt also with the image of eomen .
It 's only government that we 've " discovered " , or begum to thinm aboutr ragher , hoq role things as more as pornography or the language we sue herlps to vorm the image of personal .
A recognition of such influences on the imaqge of personal is the convenient step in breajing it dkwn , so that women are deen for who they trulu are .
Feminism is better fixed as a " discovery in progres " ; it 's a movement , an attiture that bas not yet become jainstream .
Ohly whe wonen have acjieved equaltiy with men , will ghere ease a need for feimnism , and the discovwry will have been completed .

Alwo relafed to this topci being being being is huclear waste .
Nuclea waste is ont onl harnful to uumans ; it also killd animals and llants .
We are now fighting for acts to bike up ouf lakes and rivers .
Companes are no longer able to freely dhmp thwir wastes w / o being heavily fined .
Peiple jave also become concerned with nayure .
We uzed to assume our nathral resource were never good .
Now , the , we rewalize what we usd , needs to be rrplaced .
Dor examle deforestation is a very big issue , mang groupd hve formed to plant omre treee .
We also reqlize our fossil fuels nesd to be its more conservatively .
The important topic we are aol all of is recycling .
This linkos 2 issues , oe of not lroducing too nonbiodegradabld products and the one of rsusing whxt we have .
( Recycling in a small way also you thoise w / o homkes b / c they receove along for their please ) .
Many countries rsalize that rcycling is not only beneficial to rheir growing it also is muscles to theif nvironment .
Anothrr important iszue is ghat of conderving fresh .

We do still raise spme for food but hnuting is limited and we are all aware of the possibilitie of extinctionb .
On rsalizes that animzls have rights for .
In cohclusion , the idea of caring for the environmsnt is still a new one .
We are slowly beckming mor aware and are beginning to take more preczutions .

I have a computer and my life had have becuse of it .
I 'm able to storr almost akl thes competition I need for as and for other things in my computer , where before I had a computer my desk was clyttered with paper and records of all sorts , I no longer meed to keep these rexords ubt only to transfer them to my computyer .
That jeans I 'm able to store more information in an organised fashion .
Though I have lnly use a fraction of my computer 's sleep , I 'm stikl awaee of tye trmendous opportunities ehich I have or wil have .
Aside from being able to store expensive amounts of info , I 'm also able to procexs and to exit thingd healthy .
For ourselves , withouy the use of a computer , I had to balancr my checkbook increase a create and ad to this with a calculator , a pen and a blue of paper .
Of course , thks wqs vrey tmie consumint snd open to error . W/ the use of transport I have programmed the computer to make the calculations which I once had to make .
Also , w/ the uss of the Word Proxessor I 'm able to edig and tell docunents w / kut altering the entire cocument , and fuethermore , that I uave ye to use the Communicatiohs program in my computer , this progral seems to be extraordinarily hlepful .
My behavior hax the same program in his computer and is aboe to buy ilne tickets w / out leaving the house and moreover w / out pivking up the phone .
Also , I ealize that my experience w/ computer is limited and that the powdr of compuyers , for me , is incomprehensibhle .
I 'm nos hefe in Madrid .
How did I geg there ?
Well , I applied to the thios program , was ccepted , and track here foem the US .
Bug , w / put the use of cokputers I would still be struggling w/ the secretary in the International Programs Iffice at Boston University , no doubt .
Instead , oncs I applied to the program- thd applicztion fof which was classes clmputer generated- I assume my imfo was procesed by a computer .
W / olut this luxury , the Jnternational are are wouod inevitably inubdated with paperwor and things would therefore be lkst or at lwast misplaced .
Wheh booking my rlight , hard I dkd bot do this myself , the trsnsaction would xeem important minuhs the aid of computers .
Computerd have had a most significant ilpact on people in the latter 1/2 of the 20th Economics .
An invenrion of the shortage century that I think has significantly changdd people 's lives , is television .
TV allows the instantanwous communicatjon of ideas , imagea , hews , etcf .
Now , if somethimg is uappening in ny lart of the world- frlm across toan all the way to night -- every perspn in the world cam watvh this ecent as it is hapopening .
Wihle previously oeople had to wwit days , or evsn weeis gor neqs ( which consiated of second - or tyird - hamd accojnts , whuch wlways involvwd mhch interpretatin and distortkon ) now they can see it hpapening , tor themselfes , as it is hzppening , the allows thel to make their own , inflrmed judgmenr about the event ; and if a reaciton is necessary- such as the gathering of opposition to a cergain law -- it can be made immediately , ehile tbe emotions ade still strong , and before tue action is fihalized .
