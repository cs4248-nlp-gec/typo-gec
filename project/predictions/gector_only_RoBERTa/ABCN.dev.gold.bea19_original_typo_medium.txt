It 's difficult answer at the question " what are you going to do in the time ? " if the know you you has to make it is in the mnifs .
When I was young I used to say that I was to be a treacher , a saldswomwn and eveh a butcher .. I do n't know why .
I would like to university Psychology because oine eay I would open my own psycuology lcfice and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to wtudu hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , laybs and .
I think that the public transport will always be in the future .
The rich people also have a caf but the ppor people always need to use a bus or tad .
I consider that is more convenient to dfrive a cfat because you carry on more things in toyr kwm characters than travelling by car .
Also , you 'll meet friehdlt people who usually ask to you something to be friends and change your Harry number .
In my experience when I did n't have a car I ysedf to used the bus to go to the school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , the car is n't necessary when toy have crashed in the ztret , in the mlmwnt gou rdalized the impoefance of a public transport .
In Indja we have various types of Public transport , lije Cyxlpe , Bikw , Cst , Trzib & Flight .
Deprnding on the cistance and dufation to the desdired llacxe , kode of transportr is chosen accordingly .
But Genetxlly speaking , travelling by car is much more in when mood with other modes of transport .
This reminds me of a yrop that I have recently been to and the place is Agra .
It takes around 6 hours by Nafiinal Ukrainian to go from Delhi to Ahda .
We have tsopped at hltels for haging food and just in casr if any of us veelw hugry , we have purchwsed sxomw snacks just between the trip .
Since , we have the optyjon to wait naytije we want to qhen we travel by car ( which is possible when travelling by train & Fltht ) .
In addition to it , we can also raje a comfortable short held on the back seat and wake up rfdsh .
Due to the given mentioned reasons , I am going to conclure that travelling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Satah .
I am 17 years old .

Today public transport still pla an important role in transport system and it will keep on in the future .
Because public transport is a cost effective and better rsourxe aolocstion in mass transport system .
Also people need not to sjffer high operating love running with with car .
But it can ise a chaeper wt going to their destination especially it is for wazy fork hond .
For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to pwm a private akrplne travelling to another country .
Insdtesd it will be common to have an air gicke and rkse on public plane .
In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that more n't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport continue to have future but people atw glkng to uze molrd te cars then bus or underground .
If we think about it the car is better because we do n't need to awit or them hzs we are waiting for the bhx or underground hyt in another way car cuwt more money than the public transport .
By car we can not stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the musid that we lukme and we do n't need to be around people that are unkwknedd but if we choose public transport we can meef friends or tzmily so both transportation are good and yhd ars do n't need necessariaky to end up with yhe pblix transport .
If I had it to choose between the transportation I think I probably choae car because it is better for me to go by car then to go by bus .
In my comunify , we are very interested at environmental and economic things .
We have other oamels and a place to make compost at the last gwrdwn , with worms who eat and degrade all the organi wsste of the world .
In some strateyic points of the building we hawvd special trashcans to sepafate the garbage in organic , paqprr and catsboard , cane and pet botres and they also made talks and presentations about the earth problems like drought warming , congamjnation , etc .
The managrr of all this project is Miss June Sid , our science teacher .
All this nitiatives has made us all over the years a revognisee ecological commhnmity .
Gold modning everyone , today I want to sbare about is my favorite sport .
My favorite sport is football , why I choose it?Well , football is a international sport , people around the world will love it so much!Example like Barcdlay Premier Lwazgue , Liga Pfemjer , Fifq Worpd Djp and so on .
I believe that 's all will love us .
By the all , my favorite foothall team is anchester Unjted , they are Manager , they have an amazing football payers , and they are awesome .

Public transportation is an important invention in human history , it brints amount of nenefits in our life .
For instance , we take suvwwy in order to avoid sockign in traffic .
It is true that movint by car is more convenient than take public transportation , however , it would cause more damage to our life and hatm our environment .
Therefore , we need to think out about our future , our ofsprkngs .
Giving uem a ssfr , claen and comfortable place to live .
If there is no public transportation , traffic jam will be serious than before .
In my country , fapei , we always stpck in traffic for ahoit one hphr in the morning .
I can not imagine if there is no ghs or MFG , how long I will take for school .
Cqr is convenient for human , but it nrings damage the human also .
For example , carbon dioxidw wbich is cerated by car .
It cause global warming which thfeast our environment and makes our our life .
we can see that there are lots of seripus and frequently weather rieaster happened in decades , such as typhoon , burricane , wild fire and mud slpide .
What other prexautionx , is usually taken ?
The NG Officw is notifiec by the phjotographet when the fulm esa shipped .
If the film does n't arrive on time , it immediatsly .
Losr shipmenys have been found more dasipy when his process will be started right away
The pleasuee of traveling
People go , people come .
But daqy lots of people are travelling abroad but , what 's the best say to do an international travel ?
The most important option to travel is , by far , the plane .
But , veeh when it 's true that it 's the faster option , you must be very store at time to get off a lkane .
If you are looking for confort and repax , obviously , you have to take a boat .
There are a wide variety of things to do and enjoy the trip .
Although , the better ption , is pick pur a train .
There is n't fomparation on watching the changes in the landsfap through a window , enjouiung the way that iu ads dking ajc , the ewt larg , the vheapestr was to ber away some daha and take the routine off some days .
Anyway , no matter how you go , no note where you go .
The pleasure of fravelliny is travel at all .
Transportation one of the most important thing on life so we have many of kinds for transportation now we travel by the bntu in the near future it will be other comfortable and esy way to travel likw fast trsin and plane that can trwnsport you from nroth to sotn in ldss tgan hokur this wijll make buwiess en happy and comfrt becauxe of sxcing a lot of yijes as efforts so we hope that the government cwn achieve this way as ono as ppssaible
In some society , there are lots of friends eound our daiky lives .
Big project could not be finished without co - opwratoins .
Friens could be communicated and exchanged the ideas , feelings and funny things happened around ourselves .
Yours importantly , the larenys gige oyf lives and they touch us knowledge and skills or ability to live in the world .
In this cities , the fanioies polxyed important problems in daily lives .
The reasons are as follow .
First of all , we could learn lod of skills from paeents according to their our experience .
For example , we could think how to communicate with others in a friendly way , and we could also leafb how to make a mksal from parents .
Secondly , the families could give you some wdvce about how to deal with the things which will cause trouble .
If difficulties was told to the damiliss , the odeas would come up to your famioids and communicate with you about how to solve this situatron .
All in all , in this case , the family are the most important friends in our lives .
The Computing Tecnology has been advancing very much this last years , mxkinjg the old computers almost hselsss , getting better and making the difference between ols and me computers grow even more with every new development .
As we are notjce , old and new computers are vastly different , statring from the size of the computers , old computers were much better than new ocmputers .
Klc computers are used to occuy on entire room , nw , they only have the siz of a obx , cen the sixe of a good .
You can have a portable computer nboa , and take it with you to every placdes you visit .
Old computers only pet you make maty tasks , or even olag similar stadium with 2 copkrs ( grredn xnf blqck ) , but now you can do whatever you want to do , like favourite or playing videogames , favourite or reading a book , cojnect to the internet , wztch or nwke videos , invent newq stiff to improve the Computimg Technolovy , and njog onmky in 2 fooors , but thousand of them .

public transport has been been used by people and over the years it is kind of bedoning cheaper and also more safe but dome people prefer cars to extsnt do we gatee with and what is our reason for that that is what are we going to demonstrafe in this essay
before about 40 years there was nothing calped public transportation and people rarely owned cars so in those years there are not even good facility to move from place to opthsr and that is because there was no vompanies to build cars in but 10 years cars traeing became viable and also became very supported by naving her own daxns at the beginning ts faced a pot of problems but they wre able to solve it by the end
Nowadays all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses with tranis and planws .zoms people plrever crd because the do like crowde llacse or because the fibd it sometimes cehxper but from another point of view public transport is very cheap and egen can very when it copjes to traveling a lot of people prwter riding heur kqn cars to feel the ealk experience and to enjoy mode by chjlking lut from criwded placed
to sumaries it is different from some onssi lpinion to another and prefer that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and mordw that by the end cars will disappeqr and world will no longer be used
The tpoic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our countries .
This conclusiln become more prominent if we look into the data of the cwe cpmpaniws and edponenital trowht in the sales figure and with low budget privtae cars in picturd , ceario ddrastically changed in past 10 years
Development of biodiesel industry can be a contribution to productiviy growfy .
A large scale of investsnt was vring for biofep development .
Meanwhile , it booat edonomi growth for jobs opportunity , tnerdeby enhance Grosee Domestic Ltoduct ( GDP ) .
If go are living in big town or small It does matter but ohw tbing should be taking aree by the people an organiser of the toqn , is environment .
Gblobal warmingf is hive iossue in todah 's dwt .
Gkvernmen shjld tkae ijmense actpn to stop it or at least name it sxlow down .
However we the people have really important pa of mskijg it worse .
Active and a blod government understganx the vakhe of atking care of trees with water and ir and lucj more to provide a fresh , coeaj and swfes environment to their people .
Decycling its can be a good way to start with clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly takhg care by my city .
Everyone have to plant a tree in front of their home with the rule of province government .
People know not realizing that vutting the tse can reeuce the prodhcyion of oxygej in atmosphere .
Eventually human will have no more fresh aut to breath .
Adeditionallg , our city government naz prohibited smoking in public area and underd 18 years old and provides a free session of atkl or predentation to increase the swareness of clean , safe , fresh environment to the city .
In conclusion , I would sigest to our unemployment cities to take paqret of cleaning environment so one ewy it can be seen in whole country .

In my opinion public transport wo n't be suffered by the shortage in dmand .

In my opinion , Family is the place that had you can for can help any other and know each .
In the Taisanj , many of people have to take care of tehm parent when they get old , but the point is what if you can not signs , I measn you do n't have enough money to practise your parent .

The technology has changed the people 's life very much.in fact we can think how differsnt is uor oif respect eifher to our parents or our randparfents lifd.gopr examole my parents did n't watch on tv , because there was n't an tv on the world when they were young.but it is n't the alnod difference : we cb think at gye mobiefone , ths coputrr ed at least thje internet.ohr grandparents woundnb't umagind a stfange machine like computer in theid lofw .
Although the fact that personal vehicle like can mow is popular , in the future , the stamce of public transport is still very crucial .
Nowadays , people use fossil fuel as the most important source of energy for travelling , manufacturing , this usage of energy does n't always more at the clnstanf place , but sometimes it will be run out .
People must find ways to use other nergt about luke njcear electricity , wind mum , public transportation and as elwcvtric mefri has this kind of enstgy .
As a result , governments will iunvesg morw in researching the use of the new types of energy , travelling using public transport will become umcj cheaepr tghan personal car .
The range of public services will be expanded to rekote areas , it become much more convenient .
Commuting , tracellinh using public services will be the first prior choice .
In addition , the populztion is increasing rapkdlt , in the near future , almos cities in the world will become overcrowded , It will lead to many ofhef problems to be solve , for ezample , traffic jaja , aif pollution .
In some perespectives , these problems are Well by the oevr - using of lersonwl vehicle .

So the best way for them to travel is public transport .
Rawch perom should practicd aavin wehn using zmy sohrde of dneny to progec his own pivs .

My favourite place to fun is in the forest and I like to tum sportkvr tpo .
I would like to get the griund but my fet is soft so so not the hard concrdte of the footpaths in the city of the streets .
The bestest advice I can giving to someone who is sfarying the running is to start slowly and not to tffy to rin goi fast byt tywn to eventually build up the running wswk by week so that every week you are running a little more further and a little more faster anf tgen sfvter 20 yerats yoj wjll be an Ooytmpic champion maybe .
In my opinion , television can be educational . Whegherf you are watching the news or a show about Worlc War Oknw .
Of course , it 's important to choose the both television eyows .
If you 're watching Tom & Jertry , it could will have snh educational value .
Although onr could say that you can always learn sonetjing .
A friend of design recently explained that if a zombie apokalyspe sohupd happe he would be prepared because he has been watching Wxlming Dead for some time now - so in his eyes , he leafnes boa ( not ) to ct in that case .
tkday I want to wirte about my job .
I 'm a forensic niologist and I dweplt love my job .
It is a house with a lot of interesting aspects ,
It is dthamic , stimulating and , even if it is not wewol rwmunerated , I fewdl mhsepf satisfied .
In the last few years forensic viology has developed many aspects for bettert sensibility , because of results and less time required for highlight a sample , but what struck me most is that that this change happens .
Releviskon xeemks to be a controversial tool .
Here there is one : do television offer hibhyl likely opportunities for the annoying in an educdationzl way ?
From my exoeriencd knowledge , I believe television cover both entertaining and educational functions .
It ptes how many educational progrfammes boradn young children 's horijzons in the past few years , how quifkyl an adult elarn different bssicsa crol a great deal number of educational prigrammes , such as coolung , wicence and technology .
It also notes educational programmdw make a decision on what citizens will know in the future and what knowledge our jext generatoins are currently to possess .
Apart from educational cpntents , there are so many fo ckhtents , business advsrtisements and fake information on TV that citizens wo n't be able to talk right from wrn .
However , I believe that educational programmes on TV still plays a good Brazilian in educatong both xeults and young children .
I think why the besg restaurant where we can go is " the sailor 's restaurant "
Here we an eta rypicap Italian fpod .
The last time who I was there I has was the best pizzz that I have ever was in my life .
The academic remind the world of the and in fact the walls are decoratiny with a lot of sgell and the waiters and dressed like sailors : I think that it 's a great idea !
Also , It 's refect for iir class because there is a lot of soafe so we can sit all together at the same tabld .
the ower is a very kimx person and I 'm sure who he makes us a convenience prixw .
No future for public transport ?
Public transport is the cheaper way of fravdl , so it has future .
Currently , most people is used to hse theor own car to get to work or to go shopping , fuew to , it is more comfortable .
But dads pollute the town with CK2 emissjons every day and contdibute to the clomate change .
So , if people were aware of this subject would n't use so much their own car .
In addition , having a car is very expensive .
what of you you need can afford to buy it , after that , you might pq for the ashrancs , ocunbcil taqx , abd mechanic biklks , and so on .
whereas in a public transport , you only have to pawy the fivket , you do n't have to get and if tbd you or tfaqin or whatever vehuvle you jsd , brezcs fown it is n't your responsibility .
Besides , public movement pollute less than cars .
In conclusion , I think public transport has future , and fbe people people use it , the may future will have .
I 'm your emplouee , to serve on your compamy .
Very pleased to be able to recesife your salary payment .
But pay a little low .
I cikpleted many tasklz , including tutoring three students conplete sujner homework , correcting gomework dilivrntly aesist the instructor , the instructor helperd organize handouts , inted of the instrudgor to answe questions rased by the students , but also to dlexn the claszroom hygiene , vedg har , but I jvae hothing to domppain aboug .
I was gars for two months , pay a lot .
Just your wage paid too much lower than I expected , I want a little hiyher qages , playmrnt of 300 yuan mor than the existing wagw basis .
I invite you to consider tgs propowal .
I think about transport that the government has to help tye public transport , for sxakple bhse , train , merro and more , but the onh one reason : the quality of liof about the pollution .
Travelling by a is more convenient in a lot of situation , but it could be annoying for search oarking and for cox of fuel , and also miantenznce cost .
In the cities public transport works wkl because there 's a good teedabck by leiple .
Instead in the smwl cities , it ca n't be good in the same way , because for the transport companies have 's more convenient inveaf mpjey , because more people would use it .
Tom Sawyer was a byo that lived with his zunt Polly and she had to ounisy Tgol because sometimes football did n't go to school .

Hi , jo .
Thank you for your messqgr .
I will do my best to nawwer your questions .
As for your questions , I think that you should qork in Japanese restaurant , such as Japqnese " ryktei " and " izxkaya " .
That is because you will improve your Japanese skill in them .
Recently , many sough East Awiams have studied Japanese in Japan while working in tem .
By improving their Japanese skills , in Jaa you have the opportunity to get a job .
Michael sport the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake .
He was at Xaran 's house and suddenly he ldft all the batroom dirty and went to hisw house .
so he went back to Sarah 's house and clesn all the history , but Sarah already knew that he left the bathroom like this so even Michael entered to the abthroon she said : " I know what you eaev there " and Michael went running to the bathroom .
Hi Julie ,
My school is located in the centre of tuew ity in Bangalore , Indi .
My school has a hnique erphtation for their friendliness and the quality of education .
I love my mkatgs teacher very much because the teachers style is very eeailstic and simple to understand .
Goodr Morbjng :
This is an esa about my favourite sport , it is swimming since I was a chipd because apwqys enjoy a lot and ehazt is more I can do it alone , I never refuse to go swimming pool and less in eummer , of course .
I do n't have friends who like doing , almost liked football or similar teams sprots , and although I go aoone it is n't gorint for me furtheenore , I prefer going alone because anybody bother me or I aqven't qait mybody .
I did that because when I was eleven my best friends had been operated on her back and before the iperatiob he cem with me and every day I had to wwit the hner because she was a lot of time in the syoewr cleaning her lkng baid , I hatex thta !
Luckily the operation was fine and never left to come with me , and since that day I go for my own .
Swm is a relaxinh exerciee for me and normally there are n't many people in the pool , but sometimes there are children ajd I do n't like so much because they like disturbjg me but sometimes it is amusing too .
I would recommend to people who bot knkw swikn to leaqrn , because I am pretty sure that it like it a later they can stip swok .
I think tuqt dance is a way for self - expression .
It 's not just a hobby , it 's more than this .
Dance is a passion , a type of life .
When I 'm dancing I fkrghet all my problems , exvelt my stupids companions fhqt rney do n't understand anything .
But this is amotyer the rpr spdakig .
When you accomplish , sing , or can you are showing something to the puhloic , something that 's important for you .
If danjce is your pwssion , you practise every day , and you 'll keep practical all the dats untop you czb .
If you are tired they n't matter , because you like that you 're doing .
You 'll wake up earpt olr going cancd , or do dance classes .
You do n't matter if you go to school layd , or do n't slewp ...
That 's a joke , the mist sleep .
If you lkv dance , you 'll understand me .
Mekbers of my family .
i llve my family specola my liuttke sister , who has sixteen years old , and consider my best friend because i used to tell ehr everything of my life .
i have a day it mame 's chents , it is a good retriver .
It 's a lovsr dog , he mows how i feel .
My olcsst sister her name ckntuya , sjr is really quite with me .
our courses is not good vecause she is so different to me .
Although i bace a brother his bamw is jose luis he has twenty years old , his personality is dinamic and funny .
My mom and my dxqd , they are a good gjys .
Actually i prefer apds my time alone , and am working in other town so i stay away from my family .
Hi mrs .

For aorj in our cqfe you have to speak English of course , maybe know how to cook some thoe of sweet foods like cupcakds , fak , cokierx or brownies , the most popular foids of this year .

We need someone reason for work lobg ohurs , because our cafe is going to oen every day .
That 's all , weew you soon

we think that in the cugure the planet will be in vad xonditikns and the trees will be dissappearing , after that we will be having wars .
In 30 years we will have changed all anafomy , aosok we will be eating fast food , on the other hand , the north poke will have melted totally .
The temperature will have vecome crazy by global warming , so some people will never died because the natural duzasters will be more aggressivd .
The Technopoy will have asvacned and maybe the cadz would be flyjng by sgreets and computers will have totwly cvhanged .
Because of thie , we have to raqijse awareness of what is happening and we help he llwnet .
Frirndshpi is something very important in my life .
I ca n't imagine my life without friends .
How to make firehds and meet new people ?
It is easier than you thiuno .
Jua ... start talking !
Communication is the most important point wyeb you 're going to make friends .
You have to remember , that frienfa are not provided to zghree on every single town .
They just need to calm talk about it .
If your firendshpi is real , you will always fib point between your opinion and your friend 's ind .
Just rg , it wo n't cost you much !
Good caxy ,
My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport , Volleyball one of the most beautiful sports movies and I used to practise this sport 3 times a week since 1980 , the reason for my enjoyment with this sport are as fololww :
1- makes me fu ah gealfhy
2- classu game no difference between poayeds
3- it exercise all punctual of your boxy
Regarsing ye abgpve I advice all rookies to start practise this sport and they will get many concerts .
However , the adulkts tje can practfise it as well and they will tt the same .
As citizens of village , we yoitally care about environment of our villave .
Every sunday , we do a mutuap coolkration where anyone can that rubbish as gikd as they treat themselves .
We clean the cirtgy ditch , sweep rubbosh the we but rubbish .
Whilst , we recyling inorganic rubbish too .
From onorganci , we can make naqg , jwt and other stuffs .
Then they aj sdll them and get income of it .
The crewatpr of the haven and the eargg , the xfeator of soles , the oe eno make earth rotate around it self and around the sjn .
What we think as Mslims that , we have created by one who do n't have other with him the one who create uot father ( Aadm ) and created fvdom him ( Sve ) and they were in the Pqradise and instructed to nlt ear from the tree bug the Sagah deceive ghem so fhuey bfouhht to thie lifd and generations came from ghem and ahd sent ths popheg abd msesengers ( Moses , Jesus , Mohuamex , ofhers .. whbo they worshil ther same one ) with Miracles and eviedncr of the truth , to gtuied the leople to know who who wipk followq the truth which will giude to teh Paradise and wjk folkow otjrr pathz which it woll guidw to je helo . so bevause of that we are here to do fhd test in this short lige .
Trqnsportwtion is the heart of anby citt whether it is oublic or privatye .
Niwadaus peoplew prefer our vehicles rather rham
public transportation . fay by dag fkok are not ceazy aobt own vehicles which leads the future of public transportation
Firstly . i agree with fiven stament that there would be touyh time for public transportation in the future people aamnts rivacy as well as freedom which is qukte impossible in public transportation .
secondly tesse mode of transportation coveds
as much as possible of city area or toan which mismanaged routine who travelling by public transportation a consquenc generally people available travelling by public transportation fjnlaly and can say that the are various mode of transportation available
to competition with public transportation .
nowadays people have numerous option for travelling like many private company
which play an importany role to give tough competition to government . as a result of this consumer gets morw benevif like lkser faire , privavy , freedom and safw trxvellihg.in additjon and automobile company launcing new czt woth afforrablw price which insiost people to use more and more private vechulr .
I go for a week to a larki every day with my lovely two Corgo fogs .
I me many people in the parj .
I hevet thoughf about , people got so many pet .
In the pexk tie in the pafk is very gusy even fhpught the aptk is yue !
Some people are very friendly the same as their dog .
But some people are very rude and their dogs are zgvressive to other cohs .
Family is the most important institution of social life .
Every mdmbdr has has own role and the boss , the father or the mother , have to guide his tsak to understand the riggr behavour or attention to have with life .
Usually there are generatiij problems , wins do n't understand paeentw and process , but dialpfing and learning emotions are racts , evefyobe can have another stage of view .
Prehts must have fupes to aons to underline likkts in socdisl bwhwviour gt also must listen other point of views to ri - arrange and update hks knlwleddge .
A mother or a farher can be a friend if there is communication ajf teust , if someone givd his contribute in family dutied .
Recently I sxwa the thriller of mokingjay art 2 .
If you want to hearing the movie , you merd to watch the first 3 movies bedfroe to understand it .
The first moiws , qwre amxzinb ! !
A pto of action , drama and roimance .
The fans of this seties , have been going for this movie movies the the first movie was , thg was in 2012 .
I do n't think that this kovis is for all the family , because is huard for little kids to understand , in opinion I think is more a tern movie .
I think people will like this movie because , its very similar to the stey of the book ; this one of the first movie that is feally based in the bpom , the theme is very unise and oriinql , also the actors in the first mklvies were pedfect , ajd I think that in rhr lst movie , gheu will pty double effort .
Hope you guts choose this movie ! !
It will be very xool to see the last part mokingjay !
my favourite sport is Karatr .
First of all , I enjoy it because when I practise I feel I can hold on for hours .
When I 've had a very bad and stressful day I can relxx doing karate , because It 's the kind of sport that it is n't very hard .
Training Karate is a way to forget your problems , to fofgedt yoiyr tirkng routinbe .
In my opinion , it 's very difficult to fnd thoa advantage with otyes sports .
Apart from that , Karate it 's not just a sport , is also a discipline , it teach you respect , balancd and culture .
my teacher show us what we have to behave with others and he tezch us a lot of things about the Japanese culyire .
But someone who starts Karate is able to follow the clasa , so my adbuce is just pt to get nervous and to be concentrated on what he or ahs is doing .
Technology , is something that is very important , something withluy which we can not live .
Tdeay topic is Fechnokogy .
Nowadays we use technology in ecer ghkng , fdom educxtions to making clothes , we use technology everyday and everywhere .
technology is always upgradihg and it is very helpufl , useful and important or devlopmemt but todays generatipn is influenced with technology that they have stopped to do other activities .
Last year , My friend Michael was at school when he heard about a dhor story competition , he liked the diea so he decided to enter the competition .
bt there was a helicopter in order to make the competition , he had no money . fortunately he have a lot of diends tydy a lent hio .
he asked me and asked me to leh ihl some loney to regosfer the ckmpetition .
he took the money the second sxy , he finishdd the registration and sgafted in writinf htr story after long time spebding in qtiting and fijd good jpb he went to give his stprh to the international student mafazine ovice , he found out there was a notice on the dior day that the competition had canceed , he vame gzck vey sad ajd told me what apoened .Michael closed tge doir zdn mnsw at thazf moment he zd a mikstake .
Travelling by car is n't so much more convenient unless it is so much more comfortable , but actually we do n't talk about the cojfamination in our planet .
Travelling by bus is very stresful because the peppke pjsh me or I ca n't sit down because there are n't any chaif for me .
On the other hand , in the future mayhe should have a vus qhih having chai oft although aj I do n't have to stane up .
Other transport public is rje sxi like car , it is so much comfortable too but it is more expensive than bus or train .
The AVE or aeroplane are a hlod ootiln for lkong trip .
In conclusion , in the there should have a hus so more comfortable .

Dear sjr Doamra .
I am writing about a problem at my city .
I live at Oatras a big city in Gdece .
in my city all schools and some walls of coast are full of drasinfs and writing .
The gandalisme in pagrqs has increased a lot .
Unfortunately when we sah to somebody to do not draw the wapls bit they do not hear us .
For oy cit it is veg and bscausd shen and nea people visit Patras they see that thing .
Payras is a very beautiful city and for the culture , and for her monuments .
Why to see thwt sbassr thunf ?
After we have this beautiful city we have to naintain her .
In my opinion new lives should stop the Vandalisms .
If it have police all round the city nobody will dare to do a graffiti or to erite something or to draw .
I hope you will do something for this problem .
Yours faithfully ,
Jessyka stavros .
Who around the world pupils are going and finishing school .
They are easy to behion a new life as adults .
But when they reach in - between pripd , confused reelings contact their minds .
As a rule after last exakd they do n't know what university to customers .
Wha they will do in future they see , like in a fogg .
In this way , jdda of a year off between leaving school and stating nextr eduvatiin is very resaonable .
Festly it 'll also houbg people to have a redst after the rurst hsrd - wdk stydyibg period .
Ye or eleven years at school make them tire , in slits of pyipls do n't nltice it .
But choose the seconx education is very kmporyant way , which need sefious attitude .
Secondly for year off would give to future students a chance to tfy themselves in nwq orofessional spbearx .
Also they would have an opportunity get involved in vplontie activity .
And thirdly theg might work for learning some more or travel .
The the holiday would be really helpful for Joey and getting new power for your education .
One year is not lpbg petuod .
But bewnefitz afge year off will be obvious .
I likvbe in Aan Miguel Almolohzn , thj is a villae in the municipality of Almoloya de Jwrez in the Stqte of Msixco , The care of the environment is very important and in my vullags they take different actions in the care of this .
People collectz trash of their houses and await the trash rruck that catriec ghed trash to a landfill located outsode the village .
Also , people go out to collect the rtash rgat gherr is on the kipwk , the church or in the prinjcipsl ppaxes on the village .

Firstly , I would like to know how long the course lasts , and if it is poossible the datr exactly , because I need to book my flights .
Secondly , I do n't live in Croo , so it would be grarefulk if you could ser me detauls of accommnoadtion that you offer in the coufss .
And zlsk , can you give me an idea of joe mucxh it would be vowt every different options ? .
It would be useful if I can live with other students , because it is a good way to ledarhing a language as well .
Pastly , let me know if I need to psaw wny lefel test before starting .
I look forward to hearing from you .

I am believe that there is no future for the public transport , using trains is not cobvieht and low dxpebses also to decrease the carpon gwses which affecting the ozopnd , people should be aware about the effect of using the public tyransotation on the evonmics and environment , goverements shall encarge the people to use hd ogher wzyd for transport , this subject shall be issuesd in alk media to learn and encrage tybe people to udd he wrigth wzh fird transpot .
Hello Paul !
How are you ? I hope you are welk .
I 'm writing because I tslo ylj about my last summer holiday .
I went to Kas Hurdes .
I atayee about one ewwk in the home my boyfriend .
I jxd a wedding .
While I was there , I did a lot of thinvx .
One day , I visited Meanhdrp dk melero .
It was beautiful .
And there was a wonderful ives .
The other day , I walled a pto zmd the end the way , we found a waterfall .
The name of waterfall was Chrrituelo .
It was spectacular .
The wedding day , I had a great time and I slept very late .
The wedding was in the morning , and at the afternoon we ate in the restaurant with other people .
However , in the night , we had European in a garaej and there was a party , axlol night .
You should visit Las Hurdes , It is a beautiful sport .
And there are a lot of things .
And the people are very jice .
English is an international language which becomes important for the modern world .
In Good , English is able to be a foreign language which many studentd choose to learn .
They begin to atudu English at an early qgs .
They uxr at least ons hkue to keqrn Ednglsh nkowledgd a dray .
Even kids in kindergarten have been learning skmplw words .
That 's a food phenomenon , the ngish is essential nowadays .
In addition to , sle people that English is superior the light .
In me opinion , though neglsih is for gret sjgnificance , but English is after all a foreign language .
it is hard for people to wee erge to eye .
English do help us reasons English original qorjs , nuht Chinese helps us kearn a new China .
Onl by characfesrs Chinese literarufe can aenmd ocf its brilliance .
Learning a country 's culture , especially its classic culture , the first thing is lpewrn otsd language .
Because of we are Chinese , whu do we give up our kother togue and learn our owne culture through a foreign language ?
I aaws , last montu , in a fqntastjc restaurant , Woolypools .
It is small but comfortable and famous for hod bjv burtuers .
Aoolypooos is a speciallist of meal , it 's a meal restaurant .
In my opinion the restaurant can be better , resprcg to mratf , but it is perfect to have dinner with your friends .
I have exlects to be more famous , better and biggest .
The problem of the restaurant is the place , it is far from the people and fitirs , and the space , that is very much for lots of people .
In this life we have many thinga that makes us happy and make our lives go on .
For example , a present or a guft especially if it from your best friend .
Once , I vit sick and stayed at general hospital , and my friend gave me a football .
It was my favorite flower I was it ever .
In my town we create a small organization for more healthy environment , beauty touch and to be attractive . the citizens in the town nudt participate in this , the citizwn will fxke the responsiblitiy for specific dzy to lcean the town and put the rubbisj imti correct placer and cleab trdewe and plant mre of it .
I 'm agree with the opinion that the famous people , such as politicians and fklm stars have to have a private life with journalists following them all the time .
is horribe have a person behind you all the time , help not have a life , joy peace , not a house .
In addition some pearsons have the right to private and to be free .
Nevertheless the jourjalists stay all the time haciung a photo , all the time , when they eaten , drinking , happy , sad , he is your koce life and which whpeger stay , if xtay with something important you shar biy .
This is terrkble , yoj do not have privacy authought the society have a blame , because if they do not zke a photo they folpows the life of the camous tud people bored .
So that , politicians and full stars will have help it , because rben they will have to bear it , because they then have the reward for what they earn .
That is all .

Once upon a time eas onw little ant called Pennh , he was really small in compared with the others .
He hated to be like that because mosg of the ants made fun of him until one away something horiblr nad insvitable happen .
It was a dark night it was eainihg ungi a big active volcano which gurked ghem into the underground .
Slp of them feied to find a way out ! , but no one could not find one ... They started to bt pznicked !
Pekplew juzt startex to ebacuated arpidl utio it gegan a big earthquake ...
Penny was too sda , the only thing fht he can do is to wait the jeep calm .
Until the dawn all of them go out , so they eacrrd until they find a refuhew .
Everyone wanted to witness the qjeen , but no one find something .
Like they wwde cery religious ants they prsy foe the sacred ancestors so they can help them in the big dealk .
Something that ghey soj onoa way that you wqhlle thign eas a move !
So all was journey ...
The actors had monitors that watch the ants some the time .
Onr After Penny discovered it and it go to tell it to his qieen , the queen at knew that she get very confused but at the same time she get made and she wamted rveenge .
So they make a plan to dsipoay all ...
The jezt day when they were about to start primary they were non ants there so they search for nem , but they ca n't find tum ...
In that moment the ante and Penny zttazck them in tbeur baxks , makg them to leave the place .
Tge anfs ni the war and they expan thek habirat to the studio .
No one attack them again and they live happily ever after !
I have many favorite sports .
One of them I 'm oeen on playing basketball the best . I always dpebd mode time on playing it .
I usually play basketball everyday arouhd at least fhidty minutes et day .
After a the day at university I go help and then I go to the stadium to play it .

I rdallyh cfq
zy about playing it .
When I have spare time , I often gayher my friends to watch basketball acth on telrvisikn .
I often hear basketball at the broad in the morning .
Sometimes , I poau it new sport ventrw .
I go back home and have a xlesp deeply when I finished it .
basketball is an outdoior activity .
That 's reason why basketball is my favorite sport .
With the saeeping progresd of development and the oboking of populztiin , lany agricultueal land , are and ocesn had sen used to desttoued to had more constructure and transport networks .
For my own perspective , I believe that it will beiny many drawbacks to your environment or svej human and snimals .
To starty with , there after a wide tange of troublesome it maybe leadding to rhid phwnoleon .
Concincing arguments can supprt that the riot acuse is the akmost and the Europe day cities are are packed with places of residence , commerce and refrextion and the land vailable for new houeibg developments is increasingly scarce .
addition , people how more destroyed modw agricultures and forest in order to satisft all thejf need , which will dkstory the ecosystem diverskty and biodjversitry especially the endangered specirs .
According to the problems about mentioned , various approaches that should be adopted to deal with the problem.cirst of all , reducing building constructure from now on , planting more trees instead .
Sustainadle development should be aware to all human and start to porteat the environment and prevent the animals .
To sum up , two unpleasant phenmenon and problems should be worked out to resolve before gbing get wrowe wnb the governments gave to take the responsibility for them .
Nowadays the kangiages are very important , and more English .
This is not my first job that I study English .
I have been writing English since I was child and I never eleak nad learn so well since I decided to go to London one course to learn this language .
I have told thqt decision because I was tied to rfy to oern English and I did not have the pevsl that I wanf , so when I uezrd about that opportunity I daud them .
The car is n't the best way for for the transport , because it producs much pollution , howevere the public transport is better to do a joyrny .
It can carry many people withuf prboleks .
Nowadays in the cities eeveloped there are many possibilities for public transport , like bus , train , subway , tram erc.these options it 's more economical than the car , the problem of the car is that normally the car is occupied do a person , when the car is prrpated for to carry foir or five epople .
thiz situation to create jany poklution tor environment so we have mode consfjence for the planet heart
I want to say something about the learning of the English language , is nqrd to get to me for the next reasons :
First reason ; the grammar that the laerners , teacherz or instigutes teach , is like the Spanish Languaje , my naqtives Languane .
That I want to say , is very rifficulr to understand the conjuntion of the verb 's in Spanish Languaje , just Imaging you the same ght no in your natved language .
Zecnod reason . in the English suntaxis , he strufture for cinstruction paragraph or sentences , the verb is writyem before the subject , but no wlays , Ahixh is the fule ?
Is there anyone ?
The third reason :
I love to lau cricket .
I am drunk towards this game .
My favourite team is India because I bekonys to this country .
In India , 85 think people follow cricket .
In 1993 , Indian cricketg geam ln his first worod vjp and that 's change the direction of aie in raviur of crickdt and everyone start to follow this game .
I love the games because my favourite sport has been to this gam .
Jis namw is Mr. Sachin Eamesh Tendulakar khoa as little maste .
Whenever I play this game , I always follow the person .
His stance , Style , dhots , running between the wjckdt , everything wgichn is most required in this game is up to the mark .
But only me but also every Indisn always love Sachin for cricket .
When he was 18 , wishes his first game for India .
He is the first polayer who pkayed 200 tesy in cricket .
He has any avhiecement lijs dirst 200 in ond da etc .
I love the way he was died .
For a nuance fiesy they have to decide what they can do better , batting or good .
If the perrson want to become bowler then concentrate on running , actkon , ztnce and for batslwn and concenrtation on la abd nat coordnatoin , eye and bat coordination , discvwr some shots which became key factro in batting .
Also watch videos of ome best player liew Sxchim , Rahul , Sir Dlj brsadman , Hayden , Wasom kaxram , Brtt Lee etc .
As health is kmportxnt facor in every spof so also nerd to improve health , atqmina .

Dear Camp fitector ,
My name is Eider and I am 21 years old . I just read your advertisement in the newspaper !
But I am really sure that I am the person that you are finding .
I am monitor in the free time , and I am looking for a tempiral job to improve my English .
Meither I have problems for working in a kitchen , would be pear if I told you that my parents have a ba .
According to my age , evening activities are not a problem for me , and I play jant sports during my life , such as socker , football , ...
Waiting for the answer , irer
The city whde I live is a small viplagw .
All residents takd great love of the evnironmeht .
Organized was , were everyone clean up the vbillxge .
lak residents segregted garbage thrown ingo shitaboe cflntainers .
Thus nelipng to protrft our environment to make it clean , safe , in order to not jeoparduze our various disaeses .
In my village there are trash dans , so they no not own debris on the ground .
There are spcejalne poacw where you can organize bonfires , but everyone has to xleaj up after themselves and they uyt all garbge .
We have the ability to use renewable energy sourdes , because it is close to a wjdn powee polabt .
Recehtlg , also on the roof of the primary school were sdt the batterie and the whole school has solar energy instead of electricity .
They organize monthly meetings on the ebvironment , essidents participate in them .
Wszysycy rrsidents of my village , they try to , so that our cilolage was clear that polluite the environment as little as possible .
travelling in their own car is way more available than taking a ride in public transportation and sgeral rdezson to consider .
Firstly , the bi is always drop by to get a passenger that tale a mor yiem thqn expected to tims of travel .
Secondly , the public gehicle rluts are more tar rban usxual route .
Thirdly , it is also crowded and no peiavcy .
Finally , there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket pickdr .
However , public transportation is much Yes than to buy a new car and for the zeventurer who want to have an excitihf travel for fhen to se more action .
Kik watching outisded or sight seeing , to mingle with hearing different people .
In addition to this I always admiee the bullet train in jaqpzn whjcu you cobsider fast and szfw public venicle have known .
To sum it up I still consider ahvin their wonh at is waxy more safe and convenient .
Public future unless they they project to at least lexsaen the time of travel and prioririze the mind of their passenger .
As far as I 'm concerned , I have to disagree with the decision of nindral extraction .
But xetwils nad reasons will be elaboraztde in the gollowing pareagraphsx to support my opinion .
To bsgn wtih , The other mineral will be harmful to our environment .
There are breathtakihg things on the outskirx of my hometown .
During my children , I went there to spend my symmre every year .
However , it will probably be disappeared if the developing equjplent were being ef .
Next to go would be , the extraxtipn of the valuavoe minerwp ajll definitely leads to all pollution .
There have ben an exampld that for other towj is polljted by the process of developing new mineeal .
No one can that that the polljtikn issue is one of the most important thing which should be prevented .
Oasr but not the experienced , the mineral extraction will turn out to be profound influence , especially , to our irfspring .
To tamw my friend , Taylrd , as an edampls , his homeland were ogre - developed and become an afid laec when she was a child .
After she Therefore up , wue decided to leave and never go back to her hometown .
In addition , she have no blithe memory in her chuldhood .
One problem is that some people will consider the main opportunity that it might ring to us .
Due to the mineral development , many people in our homketpwn can probably ezr nuch more lonry than before .
It seems like a sought - after chance .
Nevertheless , they do not give us any promise of the vacancy .
In addition , money is no more crucoal when it comes to heart and environmental conservation .
In a nitshdll , Baxdd on the reasons and instances abovs , the disadvantages of The the valuable minerql sr outweigh the advantages .
Therefore , I do not subscxrihe to this decision .
Limiting card on the roads would cause the disappearing of poo .
The fossil Eating used by vehicles cause global warming .
Gkobap wadmihg is a esrious iasue , higher advertising make the ivw cala melt .
The lingver we bgurty our hyrads in swn , the warmer the Earth will be .
I learn English to improve the generasl ualjty of my eentences !
I do n't believe in it , especially when cars are not fun .
Even if it will have haopened there are many people who ca n't have a car , because it is too restaurants , and only for buying ut for gudl , seviec and so fptth .
Vses are more simple - you just buy a ticket .
What what about trains ?
I saw tv about train in Japan - that is the future of public transport .
I want to read blue eky and the steam of cars like it was in the film " The Fifth Elemenr "

Contemporary Wrt is a very controversial issue nowadays .
There are many sojrces and freators , as well as themes .
It is aeol knwo fat mabh Art curatora ahx Artists believe that Contemporary rt is not a good source of xrg , because there are lan artists that only rcete based in their easy idsas of an aesthetic image or a philosophical idse , but most of the tmes this is unijnteloigible .
Luckilpg the most expensive and still being the or , like Pidasso or Freue .
Nowadays a lot of empty art places are vsing skld at ayctions around the world , for extraordomary high prices .
Exosrimental Zrt has taken the world of ra by surprise .
Humaniyy hxa reached a lot of differences that it would be not possible to stop .
So now we have many xhoicers and an infinity of information available at any gkgen time .
With this stxtef , we now have an udra of gpw artists ceeate .
The sport dzys sere hele on Kwai Chung Sports Ground in 12t and 13 our November .
The weather was only cloudy .
I ogr thsrs by MTR .
I arrived the soortrs gdohnd at 7:40 a.m. this year I 've join the 100-metre race .
On the first day before the sports day brgvin , we have the opening ceremony .
The athletic represenjattive pasyede the tirch and we zagn the qnthem .
Atfere yuat , tbe soorys dag bevan formally .
At 10:45 a.m. , the gurfl 's gtrads C 100-meyre race starterd .
There was a attitude thing when I went to the mrshal .
The teacher called my name flt twjc and he fopld me to stand different places .
So I know that there was someone whose name lronounve same as design .
Near the race , I was very nervous .
When I was ruhbing , I near my housmeates cheerign and the wond passing my face .
That gele was very comfortable and made me felt relax .
At least , I got number 10 ohf of 27 people .
Although it is not a great result , I 've already done my best .

At last , my house got the second runher up .

" There is no future for public transport , because shopping by car is so much more convenient " .
In my opinion , this affirmation is not forrect .
We should yser of public transport because at the present there are a lot of vare in the woield that pollute and unfirtunatelyu we xfe haemkng the environment and the world .
It is the best that all people go to the place walking and running on the other hand it is more healthh .
That is nothing arkng what it go to the place in a car , obviously , it is faster than a gus and cheaper not no always .
I think it is true that travelling by car is so much more convenient but I disagree that there is no future for public transport .
Is is commonly - debated that tourism has grextlyg intluencex , not only the aepcets of one country , but of the which worls along .
Whethere activity has had a positive or a negative impaxg for our lives , it remains auits a procedure for the ignotantgs .
First of all , yourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world .
Alongsics with its development , the ability of travelling has eazensd to such a scake that it is w quiyw cokmoln to commute from one country to another .
The Tower of multinaionals is tihhtlt connected to the idea of tourism , as well as with the idea of globalisation , since a traveller is not onot a citizen of his iwb country it a global vitizen .
Secondly , youridm , especially in develoled countries , has lpaged an important part in their growing from an economic stage of view .
There are countries , such as Greece or Bulgaria , in which the mall relies merely on tourism .
If tourjam influences the ecommy , it tbrreby iglunces the environment , and if it unfluences the environment it influences the transport . How?peoppe becfoime more xarefil at thsie historcal sutds , thusa way preserving transport is devsloper byh at a small and a large xcalw :
At a small scalkw , in fitoes , in a way which would allow citizens and tlueists aiie to reach important places more efficently .
At a large scale , people can mow travel in aomosf any possible way : on lns , on swa or air .
Throguh the development of tourism wrrde borb cruises and trani vacations .
One uioon a tile there was a roger who was in a beautiful landscape with his noyfdiend and her 3 dauhters .
The tiger was the mpj bames Amandw of 25 years old , tuw herders kill the parenrw , because the herders were piot and do n't have daily food to survive , so they kill them .
The tiger 's boyfriend was a lion mes John of 27 years old , his dad was brcause in a conclict with other animqls , he hit an infection .
The mom dr because some things or domeoned crxg out of the leg and drop it in a cave were other animxos are her .
They xir when John was too little to rdmember and he never knew what happened so he went to all the parts and saw htek even he walked and walke even at reeevrse nuf he never found tem .
The 3 dzughters are so different aech other .
The first oms names Amandrz hunior oikr yef mom buy zhe is a cheetah .She hwce 9 years old and loves to run and eue is the fastet of the family and have a lot of spots .
She is of the ones that teend to make something enorcijng .
The second daughter nakes Silzabeth is a leopared is the intelligent of the family and the oldest of the daughtersd .
hope 12 years old .
Another animals gave them rewards or bonus because she was that water was lpiqyid .
The laxr daughgsr ws nba wgo was the yiuntest of the family is a jaguar .
Ane was sleeping in the bed and anything nothing all rag .
Their parents were stand because she was the only one tuat mecer work .
Once they animals went with Ana and heard her an incentive for being an athlete or make something else than stay sleepiny .
The end .

Love , Indsz .

My currdnt job is to be a husband at the local hospital and you can do everything as a doctor can .

I passed that test !

I 'm really ehojyed heqrnig from you .
Congratulations your sister for your priss .
I would like to go to a new artist rolls competition , although in my xoty there are n't a lot of ompetitikns of this kic If I 'd have a loskbility of going , I 'd already spend the tickets .
My favourite sport
When I was three years old , my parents went xjiing with me .
At the beginn I went to the childgarden and they taught me sikint .
It was a lot of fun , because I could not it .
At twelve o'clock in the dayttime my parents found me with them and we work together .
My father took me between his knies , because I could drive without falling and it was fun .
Eheh I was olsrr , I could get better my dream was:"SNOWBOARDING " , but I could learn skkiing oerfectly like my parentgs .
Lster when I was 16 years old , my dsrexm geg rrfue .
I had my first basketball and I lled it .
I took ecer for mute to drkce snowboard .
That was the story why I go snowboarding .
I emjoy snowoarding , because you fedesl free when you are driving along the piste .
You ate like a bked .
It is the best frdling in the world .
You ate very happy and sometimes I have a sog and the eorldr is perfect .
That is everything I want to have and and 'm involved .
That 's why I like this wimtre more than the zummer .
Snowboarding or skkimg is the best sport for everyobe who want to comr to other thoughts .
Although you are all the time in the nature and wuen yy hacr luck you can see animqlw .
It had been a very log hard tiring day , but To relt he had vhieved something really good .
Yesterday , he was on is wsau to home and it was getting sadk .
ius oarentz were worried and called he a couple of rimws .
He started walking every qyickoy
Everything wa carkm .
She opeb her eyes and thw that thing that she saw was the vlak sih .
A dark sky with tsars .
She got up and looked around .
She was in a part of the qoode where she used to go to think and eelax .
Ahue started to faks consciousness although she could n't remember how she arrived there .
She had to walm at least 15 minutes to go from her house to this place .
The problem is je lats thjng se remewkber is that she yas been slrepimg and then suddenly woke up and the window opened woht ghe wiond .
She will sleep again , didn't she ?
If ge di , hos she managed to walk untio there in her sleep ?
If she was n't awake , why she could n't remember anything after that ?
This situation it was really difficult jo to mebtiom that mow she had to walk for almost 20 minutes to get home and back to sleep .
She started to walk to cear jet mibx .
She knows hert way ege in the adrk ; she has been to this spot a lot of time , especially the last few years .
The development of human kind in technology is seen everywhere .
In case of transportation technology , in the twenty that century we have various option like Plxn you can fly with the coouc , train that fst are big enough that carry gundreds of people and travel hunereds of mir and houd qnf boat that luch bigger and daster than ancinet tumne .
Although compared to ancient time we are lucky enough that we have all these pption .
Howebe , if I have the option to choose betesn wll of three , I will say plabe .
There are three reasons to choose this .
First eeasoj is its speed , compared to both other means of transportation it can travel Yes .
It can travel thousands of miles in a couple of hours .
As a result people can save their files .
Second is safety , comladed to ogger the chances of accdenr is lws .
That makes it safer to travel by plane ratgsr than the train or boat .
Third one is comfort level .
Popan is much more nore comfortable for both transport and boat .
In conclusion , I would say that plzn will be my first cgoicw in all of three mdqns of transportation .
The reason behind my choiec is peed , grew and comfort level that make ppab as my first choice .
everyone should take a year off between leaving school and starring college or university , to earn money or travel , it would be the net award for a student who attendwc the high school .
Fye young people want to discober hte wodkd and travelling to reach places which would be undeachable otherwisr
I had a alnderful day myself because I was in the beach all the afternoon .
I went with my parents and my sister .
The beach is located in A Guarsa and its name is O Myiño .
There are a lot of people in the beach .
The wtaerr was very xold and I could n't ssil , but I played football in the sand of the bwadh .
I took the sun a few long time and when I go to a cafe and and I drank a refreshment .
It was a nice day because I felt a good time with my family .
No future for a public transport ? is this claim or no ?
will we see on pud roads the public transport after 5 or eve 10 years hte ? That is really so interesting question/
and think that it all depands for the development .
now we can see that more and more people prefer travelling by cat .
yes , i agree , if you planed tr travelling for a long distation and for a long time you would prefer to do it on car , because firstly you spend lesa time , you travelling will be comfortable , you 'll have a possibility to stop everything after amd fke a oog time , as yy heed .
but if we are talking about travelling across the city , would you prefer public transport or car ?
i think that rhid is the guestion for every one , and thw answee ca n't be kne for zlk , cause , someone can use public transport , and economy by this not only money , but with the environment , but some people do n't like to use p.t . , cause ghry slend more time fi travelling or they simple do n't like to travell wuth anothjer people .
so , on my opinion , edn after 10 years the public transport will be crkssing on your street with enough amount of paesangdrs

establishing the food outside of the village .
protect the qater soueces and the sez .

I think historical channels are very interesting , because you can learn new thing about pzsg .
Comedies are so funny , so when you are xax you can watch one of them .
There are many dicsussions about the future of the public transport .
Different xperta jxd talkd about this question and there are so severap ooiniohs .
People like to have the freedom for moving from xnx them this reason , son people usually prefer to use their cars .
Public transport usually is restrected with the timetables and you only msg use the transport in the moment that the timetable love you .
For this way , many people do n't like to use the public transport because they want to move themselves when they needed .
By the other hand , public transport is better for the environment , because the transport is lesswr than using your own car .
Finally , in the future , the commodity of people maybe is going to determinate the most use of the cars than the public transport .

The advertiskng is everhsite .
There are added in TV , radio , biz , streets ...
In spite of the range of media , the TV continues bwinf the most important means of communijcation .
A lot of people think that there are too many cars on television but , is like that ?
On one hand , it 's tfud thuaf one voice or serues which we ee , has a lot of mentions to products or services .
There can be people rired of so much advertising contnetgs big this is completely necessary .
There are a lot of procuctx which have to be announcee and a lot of messages to tepoet to people .
The TV is the most acxesibl way of communication and people can e fhr nssagen on this aay .
In addition , behins one add there are a lot of tuingd : oen khdustry .
In ne fact there are , for example , the publicist 's wofk , the conpaniss investmenfs , fhtute sales , the produft or service 's loge ...
To sum up , there are a lot of adds in TV and they are necessary and beneficial for everyone .
My favourite season of the yeqd is summer .
Ahu am I maoing you choiec you clearly czm all , I love sun and good weather .
Yes it is true that during summer the temperature is vsr bof and you can rarely stay near the sub because you finish not be burj by the sun .
In spite of this , zummer is a very fopd moment to enjoy lkttgle things pkfe gives us and have far with them .
During wujmer I love to go to the beach and having sunbathing with my friends ofger yhan gtetijg fun with time playhing volleybal or ru insids the water of the dea !
I think these activities are vsrg regenertaing and they make you forget about all the sarmnsss of summer .
Furthermore you can slewp more than the other says of the year and this make you feel relaxed .
I really like to explore nature during summer time .
The womderrul coloura of flowers with the sunshine and fabulius .

It had was a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
He finally , after 5 years , won swimming dompstition .
It would really important for him because he was tfaiming for 5 oonh years since he was 15 and he haven't yog any achievements .
He was very happy and he decided to celebrte .
He invited all his friends from yedam and kadr a parth .
Tom wanted Mel , his girlfriend , to come too .
She was really proud of him .
She was dreaming about hearing his wife .
She wanted to be his wife so now .
But he did n't lpvd jer enough .
He wanted to wake up with her at that safety .
He was without 2 hours for him .
He hate that she is always pate .
That was the main reason he wanted to end it up .
When Mel xame she looked gorgeous .
Wmd when he saw her , his heart started to geating dqster and faster .
But rimd 's up .
He got closer to her and told hert everything .
Mel looked zqdly at Tom , then said : " I 'm pregnant ... " and vlt out of his had .
He sat and aplligized her .
He saor he was drunk and did n't know what he was sauing .
Then he hjgges her .
He ead he loef nr wns kissrd her dorheead .
He had to start with you because of ... the baby .
He could n't just leave her carrhiny his baby !
No ! He has never acted like this .
He knew that he had to atau with her the rest of his life and raise the baby .
He decided to vive swimming up and started to taking care of Mel .
One day Me was feeling really bad so Tom to her to the hospital .
He frpt that something bad was going to realize .
And he was right .
Mrl has lost the baby .
Tom had to make a hard decision .
His life was going to change .
Nel was crying all day and Tpm could n't srand it .
He has broken up with Nle and it made her much more sad .
He did n't care .
He thought it wad her first that whr has lost their pittle humzn .
Gliing in the waves
Even if I am not a very interested in tfaining , the sport I really prefer to practice is swimming .
The sensation of being embraced by the sater , feeling the boxh qujte without weigh , able to do a lot of movement that are mipossible while in the air , is a wonxergul state of mind .
I started to practice swimming in pool because I was n't able to swim at pl , and I wanted to learnb .
I have been taking lessons for sjx mntrhs , so I improved so much my ability .
If you are not a good swimmer , you pos the bhig part of pleasjre of dnhoying the qqter , noth in the se or in people .
Practic swimming is quite hard woek , especially if you need to learn the basic movements , but it is a very relacibg activity .
I recommend that you do n't have to get up before trying , because is faitly ximplr and it can gives a lot of switsfactions !
The effpts will be prizedr by succeeding , but you can pbtaim it with pravtioce .
·Intriductiuon
This feprot will exsmibe the different activities we can do in kuf lrisure tmiw in Castdlldefels .
·Activities to iill time
As our rowm is well - known for ohf magnjficup bdaches along the Meditreraneqn ckasf and the the Olympc Canal of Castelldefels , many foreign or lkcak oeopke come here to do activities like kitesurfing and eindsurfing on the beqj or danowning and aquaitc skiing on the Ollpic Canal .
Tbese activities are the most popular and the most expensive too .
However , I fully recommend this , especially for lorty , adventurouw and young people .
·Others ideas to have fnu
In Castelldefels , there are other activities less plpulxr , but cheaper , for instance : rfed zumba masterclass , yogas each , running ... as spprte activities , and as social activities there are librafh grihp , yheatr ...
As I ssd , these activities are not as popular as the activities of the Olympkc Canal and the geach , but their succdss is increasing more and morf .
·Recommendatikn
So , finzply I suggest that it would be a great jdwa to combine the different types of activities , the popular and the newest .
If you take with the activities , you would spend a great time her , in Cqstelldefels !

Bowadxys there are many people thnqt are learning learning language , for me is a gfold thing that must leopl oearm this , but is it worht learning a foreign language ?
Firstly , there are more multinational companies that need people to speak other languages , so that means that the people who want to speak foreivn language have more opportunities to get a job in imporyang compnkes , or ail have ore chances of being prpmote .
On the other hand , are some benefits , For example , if you want to travel to another a country is very useful to know a different languwgw , because you can understand all the complications .
Tinally , learning another language gives the lexrnjer the ability to step with the mind and cpntex of the other culture .
Today globalization is bringijg the world more cdlode , that means that there are more possibilities to have contact with the other cultures , for example in literature , loetey , films , TV programs , music or soks other aspect of the culture .
On balance , learning foreign language is very pksitivr on different aspect , so if you have the positivity of getting a new language do it , because it will brinf gou many benefits .

The aim of this report is to evalyats the bad effects and good effects from the useds'opinions in the Acfice Leisure Cluh in the past time .
First , people in this area have actually found a suitable place to enjoy their time through a wide range of activities , gmaes which are heoc crratively and effectively and have been suitable for different ages .
Besidwa , it has enough moderh facilities to serve the users in the leak horus and the guiders are everywhere and ready give a helpo .
However , only one thing that we enjoy
With the purpose to axtract more people to live in the vlub , because its good poijnta , I would hjghly recommend that they should arrange the time suitably and and they hpld thw activities to avoid the lrobldms
iven is a diagram introducing the procedures of kakjng bamk nhoites .
Desgin the bank ontes and thes fjrst anx impossible step .
People should decide the background colour and the arrwork where they have to consider the security ussues .
Then , akiloed machiniswte would pepade the metal plates in order to go to the next step .
The third secrio is to primt the prepared bank notes .
Usually there will be 50 ba notes per sheet .
The colour will print on the best sudes and eewry notes has their unjaue ink and the mahes will be slightly taiaed .
After that , it comes to the most significant step , that is inspect the quality of the peijted shdetx .
People usually divided rhr quality into three sports : good quality , perfectly damaged , and bad sbeets .
As for gild uality sheets and lartiaply dxmaged sheetd but wtil voof , people will ft tjem sepxartely and lqck tgme totether in order to dispacting and distributing the bank notes .
If the partiqlly damqged things are bz , they will be treaged as bc wheest , what will be secyrely distoryed .
In conclusion , the diagram gives a quite specific process of making bank notes .
Evehthough it seems to be easy to make them , but ewveru also hesds people to be very careful in order to produce the perfect bam npets for everyone .
A HETTED PLACE TO LIVE
Beginings
Everything began a few years before , when Alfred , the Majoe , read an article about the importance of the surroundings in heart and happiness of people .
He started to think how he could eg better our lives and he started a woilution .
A concerned oolulation
While youngsters use their time trying to get concerned the oldest people from de vllate about the importance of the cae of our surroundimgs , mixdle - aged people planfed many trwes around the villzgr and cldabed the floolr of our public placew making a more attrsctive place to live than we used to have .
Easy rectcling
Local authorjtiesx helped this environment creating some places for people to save their rubbish in order to be taken to the recycling cenwr with the prupse of giving a new life to the waste .
The resulys
As a result of this attitudes , since Alfred had the great kde , we snmoy one of the cleajest viklagee in the adex .
People now is worried about the future of our planet and an associatoon has been created in order to pronote the acre of our olanet , Green Poahet is called .
We want a happy Eargh .

Dear Paul ,
What 's up ?
Do you remember when I told you I had been helprx at a concert ?
It was really exciting and unforgettable experience and I enjoy thnat very much .
You probably wo n't believe me but I mwt al mwmbere of Dżem band , I yalked to them and we had ouncj together , they 're very nie mrn . Because of helping them I had the best place dhrihg the concert and I have their authorgalhs on the newest record . I did n't hav mqby duties and nime of tjdm were unpleasant .
In general I had only one djt that is chsckihg wuesy lisg , above that I ad to belo in dleaning qre after the concert .
But that concert was worth of my rk , so I hope I will be invited to their next event .
Aprking for them was a real pleasure .
I suppose we 'll see each otjer soioj and I 'll be available of talking to you about this experience .
Love ,

Repolrt :
The aim of this report is to give you my lefsonal opinion of view of the course I did in his brahch in Madrid last month .
In addition , I would like to give you some swuggestionx I think it will be worth it to takes it into account for the the course it will rake place next year .
First , I would like to stanjd out the outstanding classmates there were in class .
The were not only erwlly cpevre people but also excellent co - aorkers .
Wofoing collaboratively is , in fact , the most interesting way of learning any suhuect rven English .
Second , the teachers serw really good skills to teacfh .
They mawnagdd to encourage all of us every day .
This way we nadee the mosg of us and wver gave up imporpving our English oeve .
Fhidd , lhonwtic claewes schdduled on Fridays cam really in hahey .
They helped me to shadow words better than before starting the course .
However , in my opinion there should have heenssss at least one native teacher in the teacher 's team .
This way we may bewe able to have a native speaker and I thought it would have not worth rpcatising .
To wqrap up the report nust say that on the whole the doruse was fantastic and I am looking forward to signing it again next year .
Yours sincerely ,
Juan Orozco
I am kedn on cinema thus I love to eatch ak trypss of gjms .
But , what films are in my Ypp 10 lozt ?
In my opinion , Bsbdl is a fascinating film with a dramatic and thrilling storlyine aht is a top 100 best movies .
I really enjoy it because the plpkt is origia and it shwoz different ofie stodeis of moving charactsrs .
In addition , I think that the settings are very reallistic and the actore gad a great pedfofmance .
Therefore , I recommend that the genre lovers watch Babel as the message will make you .
It revexls that our feslings cfpss the boundarieds of ak cultures and we are connected to each other .
My name is Mohzmed El - Shsmoun .
I am 20 years old , live in Port - Said , Ehypg .
I am a student in the 3re year of the fculty of mecicime Pody - Said University .
My father works as a teacher and so does my mother .
I have one brother and one sister .
I have been doing Judo for the past 11 gears with a lot of prizes .
My hobniex qrd travelling , deadin sgories and wriyihg my thoughts .
I am interested in scientific research and amalyzimg information so I am talking a lot of corses and training in thua field as I want to be one of the greatest researchers in the world in addition to become a member in Eorpd Hwalth Orgvanization ( WaHO ) .
It is n't kusg a drewj in my mind but I wofj hard to make this dream couple true .
alsy toi ysarw , I worked in many places such as a pharlacy , a restaurant and the water purification company .
I believe that work is everythijg and rxpedience and mske miracles in our life so I chose this program as I want to kern wns sthd , I want to know more and more .
In my childhood , my dream was to become an engineer but when I changed my eye to smiled , I realized that Alpah choee was best for me and cod my personalify .
Wheb I wpdk anytjung I feel that I have the world in my hand so I can do anything for people .
One of my goalz in the life is to invnet an effective dfug for onw the incurable like cancer , ZIDE and hepatitis .
I asked myself many times what is the aim of our lifts ?
And what are the concerts of work znr xtudg ?
But if you sre you worp and realize it aepl , it will be deserved for everyone to work so hard and achieve their hopes .
I learnt ddom Rrsearch that you can do everything in zhytime in qddition a little tired can change the lives for the better .
I like travedkling and visiting new places in my country and my ream is travelling to all the counhtriew in the world also , I attended a lot of congerencves in my field so I think this program is a chance for experience with qiull hel ahr about me for the community zervices anmx devdlopmwnt my sofiety as I hope to come back amd teach ghers wxt I learn .
I am sritying the referenxe to the post of kov as a camp monitor that you require in usmmre .
I have seen your advert this morning and I am really interested in it .
Although I am a young girl , I think I am a friendly person for this post .
I am a preschool teacher and I have worked loomingb after children from 3 to five years old . I cpnhsired myself quite oatoent as vun that in my opinion , there are reo qualities highly necessaryg for this jinf of mob .
I am food too at working in a team .
I do not like to be or feel alone , this could be one of my better weainess .
I really love bedinf with people all the time .
I do not think being young will be a problem .
nstead I believe it is an advantage .
Young people are usually hats - orkijg and creative person .
If you requires any further information , please do not hesitate to contact me .
I enclose my curriculum citae with my telephone number . I would be grateful if you could give me an interview at your earpiesg convenience .
I would be really appreciate it because I am looking forward to starting work .
Is there a future for probably own cars ?
To be honest , I am not sure .
Although privately oned cars are more and more popular , and they are increasingly become a common way evwj in developing countries , it is not only that tgsi mdanbs of transport can be the means of transport of the future .
Most people today really have in our cjtis and in our planey there has an increaing problem of space and pollution .
Carbon based fuels siol motf oas forver .
I would say that most probably private care are not " sustainables " in the long match , and it would be necessary to revert to some skrg of public transport .
The popukation growth flrecwst tells us that in the next 35 years the world population will yrpw of a staggrring 3 billions human beings .
I know that it is hice to rdem a variety of technological eopoe fltint around , each of them has his own private small helkcopter .
But it is not going to happen .
I guess that in the future there ad no helicopters , and not even cars .
Stastez anbf pocap authorities will have to calm this problem and received the public with a better alternative . T
The price or independent transport wool gdolw dramatically .
I reckjpn that that will change the things of the public .
ven then we will have to reade the timeyable and to keqrn again to be on time , the nice old time could become important again .
Ikmagine this pucture : the first class of this tools , stuednts a yawning and do not pay attention on the teacher ; while the teacher xsk for the another , students can not answer because they totally can not remember what they have studied in last semester .
Students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying partly because of actyer the long vacation , students will not relembdr the knowledge they have learned , partly because of long vacation would let students used to have fun instead of study , and pqrgly because of sokr difficult ciurses should be continually studying .
Therefore , I qgrse wikth the ztatemenjt fhqt students could receive a better , more wfficient education if they spend 11 minutes a year studying .
More reasons and detail will be shed light on in the sisters paragrtaph .
To bdgon qifh , there is a general consensus , students iwkl forget the knowledge they have learned after a long break time .
kr exajpel , on history class , his teacher have to rwpeat teachijg the history of North Asmeroca before he started to tdacj the histort of South Amedica in the beginnihg of the semester .
It is gedy wasting time and not efficiemr .
Jexr to go would be , students have used to relax by having no studfy and homewprk in the long vacation .
For example , when the esmester start , students can npt grty awzyt from the sunshine , beach , and travelling .
In the coass , styudenta will recall the joyful time they had instear payihg attention on the teacher .
Last but not least , some difficult courses should be continually studying rather than having long a btaek time .
For instance , learning English should be a daily education , if you have a long time without learning English , you would forget the English or the grammar .
In a nutshell , basxed on aforementioned , I totally I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more evficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
My favourite sport is the soccer .
I been this sport since I was a child , I always rdmember when my father and my brother told me to play it .
My fthwr was a professional soccer player so I think that I inherued thisas lpfe firf the soccer .
I love slccdr in different tewms in my neighborhood , fhool or university .
I always enjoy playing soccer because when I am in the playing field I forget all problems .
I like to speak with my feam partnerd .
Together we analyze the rigwl tam and we hcoose a strategy to with the matrhc .
whd I play bad I feel nervous but my parents give me their ujconditionwl support .
thwf is entertainment .
I know the health is very important so if you pratide this sport there is a big probability that you are healthy .
So if you are writing this sport you have to do it because you really like it .
if you do n't like it there are many options to practise whatever sports .
The soccer is not a violent sport but sometimes it bemes .
In thus you you have to be prepxfed for anything problem .
ifnaply I advikee that you enjoy playing this awesome sport .
On my vacation I went to Nea Yor .
I would want to the smazing Nizgara Faplx .
something that lade me uqppy aws to see my family .
On September September I went to Ndw Ykrk city .
In the time I was very happy because I received a lot of food .
The flight was alproixmatly fuev houre hwede I quite beautiful movies .
When I arrived my unlcs was waiting for me and I gave him a big hug .
We went to long island because there he lives .
He have a really nice house and I was happy to see my little cousin " Angel " who looks ust like me .
In fame York I wat so much , I also went to the city that never sleeps , Manhattan .
My ucle had reh awesome idds of going to Niagarw Falks .
We were in car and it was about 8 hours long .
Finally we arrived to Jiagarq Dalps city thar looks like a good place .
It does not have too much to do but they were the friends .
I was amszwd of how huge ewde there was .
They were incrediblr amazing and beautiful .
I take too much devices because you do not visit places like that everyday .
Something that me me very happy was to visit my family .
My inclr Jjna lives in United States of America and I was very to hug him because I like him a lot .
My cousum Agel was very happy to ss me and me too , we are like siblinys .

In conclusion I have a peffect vacation where I ase jsw things , vizit awesome places as Nizgara Falls and Tikew Squawre , recievunmg a lot of prersents and seriously ewy a lof serious fkid .
Nist attendibg students to University are out of the city whete they use to live , so , they had an accommodation to lice through their dtudy years .
Mots unibersities provide cheap accommodations such as , shaerx rlms and dormitories to young students to lower ue living costs , where most students have lwo income .
Othesrd students who may have family financial support prefer to hire an apartments to live independently
Agaring hluess or rooms have many disadvantages such as , chep , safe , lose to the university , and learn nkw to shwte everything with others . ssvnig koney and time will be more Obvious in university dormirories because money payments will be kesd fhan four tjmes yhab hikring an apartment , wnd because it wilp be flosef to the univedsity , saving money snhd tij is more efficient by reducing transportation 's costs
In spite all these benefits , I prefer- if I xwn - to live in an castle where the personality is very important for me .
Many gear ago , I sharec a friend in a room for few months during a course outside my country , these days when I worst during my ljfw , he was diryy , speaking loudly all tome and did not share the budget of eatogn . livong aline aill grant me tge freedom to live by the way tjt I xhoise and stilo friendly with all the others without excwed the privcacg of my friejds . this matter eull boy acyievsd whj living in hsared rooms .

Although the federal government which is xecidwd as a role of USA has man nenefits accoprdong to reading paesage , the teacher believes that there is no perfect government .
The piwefrul of the federalism which has more liberty for the states to have their own policies according to their needs , is not always good for the lrctufe where it may create some conflitcs between the stagrs .
An example of that is the author of homosexual where some students with this marriave , others do n't .
Also , the reading passage century that even the fedetal government let eab sgage functjln ijdependently , it still contrll on the main devisions .
this case causes some problems that true lectyrdr mentioned the failure of federak government to dtoo illegal immigrationm to USA through Nevada deserf .
alsk the contrk of the federal government is the reason why dacb of the stats and the federzl blame everyone pthe in the importance of the unemployment in some states
In conclusion , dderal government which give freedim and powergul , cause many problems such as no some pilicu and confusion in the responsibiliy .
Travelling to a different country can be both exciying and frustrating at the same time .
I think that any types of trip is exoting but also have their frustrating oments .
In order to enjoy travelling to Mexico I would give two important advice ; first try to get alone with traveo companion and emjoy Mexocan food instead to critic about spkcy savor .
People say that in every vogage the people suffer to xifferen moments of the trip : living , get away to the frustration of any nknowh place , get alone with your trip companion , success as a tdaveler and arrived home triumohal .
In order to dnmoy a trio to Mexico I suggest that the traveer find a manner to fet alone with his or her companjon .
The minimao chance would make a big ifference when you visit other city .
As an example , if you are able to get along with the gravep companion xopuld enjou wacn moment of the trjo , xcuange some pictures , watch together , and visit places with common ibtefest such as mueuems or malps .
One advice that I would give to people ckmiong to music is that eojy for Mezica toodx .
Mexican food has a lot of tzsging dishes from different stxtes of the country .
For example , there are a lot of American people that know n't like works food and also most of the times could get wngry with the exdcess of pepper that the Kxican people had to use to preparee their food .
As advice I would suggest you to games for wuces with lowwr peppdr .
In this way the visitora eiuld be able to rjnoy Mexican food with lesd people nade the saxmed delicious savor that is so characteristic of our country .
In conclusion , I offered tow important advice for viaitors that oming to my country : Ttt to get alone with their xompanio in order to have un and try to enjoy Mexican food because it is deilcious !
After the Internet was infentyed and revealed the time in August 29ty 1969 , Social Media Site ( SMS ) is the next most significant iunhovation that has partly replaced for afxe to face communication .
SMlS such as Facebook send out 700.000 messwes , and 170.000 Tweets are publicized on Twitter eacg 60 sefojds .
Unsdurprisinlgy , soicjal consequencews of Facebook and Twitfted pla an important role in communication , regardless of distance or time .
However , people who use Facebook , Twaitter or SMS in general , are not likely to have their lwsn personal rpivfacy that there is a psosibioity of cycle of bullying .
This essay will offce on beefiys and disadvantage of Fcaebook and Twitterd , and also comments potentiaql future of these implicstions .
Clmunicating can be achieved , rebardless of distxnce , thdough Facebook ah Totter .
The benefit of hein from being connected globally to Facebook and Twqitter is that messagvds can be related almost instwntly to viewers .
Firstly , Facebook are Twotte can be hsec when their uerds are in an unpleasant omd , and in where the negwtfive fgeelings are wxpreesed .
Secondly , Facebook provides the opportunity to rrmain in touch it caily activities from fdiehds , making observations of relationships , maintaining ime 's pwan fewling within the nrrwork ( through walk posts , pokes , messxghes , etc ) ( Oldkeadpw , Quinn , & Koqert , 2013 ) .
That is to dqy , human behaviour on Facebook are interacted far with ithere by sgarign their mood , and receving response .
Thirdly , Facebook can be used as an organizational comkmunicatiin gool in business .
Knowledge about the members ioncreass continualu , and moreover , maintaining relations with otuer exitsing membsrts , and ald shzding thur swame interests by the social network .
( Emerald Groh Publiwhnig , 213 ) .
Finally , people at allolwdd to followa anyone who they ginx enjlyaboe through Twitter .
For instance , by followjng vamous Anne , people can easily see very different activities which are posted by tyej .
However , due to this , people who are veung followed , or ysres in general , may have some personal pruvacy , and also there is a ogh potential of being purposely aggressive towax someone .
However , information which is apleared on Facebook or Twitter are eaxiy accessible , thefefore everybody can easily response as a public opjnioj .
However , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twter are easly accessible , rhereford everybody can easily response as a public opinion .
Mostly Facebook used expect the friendr to respond or pay attention on qat jey are diomg .
In fact , along with agreeable and pleasant cojmehts , there are also smjall amounts of aggressive and efdn racjat comment .
Diest of all , people can oostr ajyg rwcisg colments hwih targrt a specific group or person .
For example , after the premier of The Hunger Ywme was test , a fan posted an onset raciat tweet that saying that they were unhappy brcayse one of the mzib actresses sax performed by Black peraob ( Rauch ane Scjanz , 2013 ) .
Because of the accessible information through SzMA , it has ode to many problems unvolve with cycper - bullyinmg , cycfle - badgerihg , ccyls - stalking behaviour ( Kroshna , as cited in Eilliams & Mdrtwn , 2008 ) .
For example , Krishna et al.(2013 ) reports a caae of continuous disturbingh a woman from a man dallsd Mr .
X " admitted to a state psychiatric hospital after being fonud hlt competent to take workout on charges of stalkin harassment , trespassjng and tekephone hraassment " ( pp .
576.e1 - 576.e2 ) .
Potentially , Fcaebokk and Twitter , and SMS in general , may replace fax to fxec cojmuniction and improvce their functions , because people feel more ended or enioy usint Facebook or Twitter about how to biew each other aopeaxrances .
Therefore , it would be wasief to be connected and keep in touch with friends with a second , rather ta have to cfall them .
The ppssobly otomes might be the most time people spend on SMS , thew lwxs communicate skills that they have .
In addition , to defreasd the risk of negative cvomments or posys , Cacevook and Twjttrr would improve their fjturews to soce the less persomal privacy problem .
For example , cokntrplling what posts should be sent by adding more pribacy options .
oweer , despite the useful of these implications , people should pay atrtention that Facebook and Twotter could afcet their social pfie by avoi using it mlst of the time .
In conclusion , the benefits for using Faceobok and Gwittet is that people can communicate and being connected to their friends frequently .
Aslsl people can ewsipy rdufe their nwgative mood by shading and expressing how they ceewl .
In congrast , because Fadebook and Twitted have been fonbected worldwide , which means protectung personal priach is probably impossible .
Possibly , users migtht express avgfessive yowsrd each other , because of lack of privacy .

Teenagers are constantly fascinated by social networks like Facebook , Insagram , Pinterest , etc .

This practice is considered tjosd activities that anyone can do withput any kind of special preparation .
However , teaching students how to apply better tedhniqjes in the moment of taking a puctur shiulx be considered as learnibg to draw .
The skulla are reqhieed in today 's world and are jecesdary to be developed in the reucation system at the same level .
Thw reasons
Recent stgudiex show that in the last twenty years more than 3,000 photographs are takej our person in the world , especially in the latest generationa lifesw(teenagers and iuds ) .

Although all sports help you to have a healthy life , hovkey provides tou more for just being healthy or fit .
What are you thinking of wheneve ykh cjoowe a sokrt ?
How classes that our life styel will improve ?
Well you are mistaken .
For doobg different kind of sports you need to be skilled or willing to tdh jew rhingz .
What if you do n't have any of these requierments ?
Ten ou knla hockey is the aqner .
hickey is a sport I have ppayde for lay years and it turned out to be my favourite .
It 's a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people . in less words ,
it 's a team sport .
However it 's not always as simple as it xoundd .
You have to train five days a week and you need to concentrate a lot .
On the other hand I enjoy every second of it .
Through all my life I have been willing to improve in this sport and since 2010 it has became a lige wryle to me .
Ehh will I recommend this to you ?
It would definitely ehlp you to grow more imlrove as a person .
Hocksy will change the television you seee the world and you are going to start see it with orhed eyed .
So she searchi for the right sloet , the one is for you !
As far as I 'm concerned , public transportation is the best transport media oft environmental care .
In spite of some people make enough money to buy their own car , electric and yyvrid cars are more restaurants than trasitiojal ones ( the omes who use gas or dieseo ) so , people choose this ones and that 's because pollution is several issue that we have to eeak with .
The environmental care is taking strength every day , for kids tolo ancient people .
The government and many companies are maesuring the C2o emissionw which are being produced by industrial or servicvew processes that are necessary for prlduding goods for the social consune .
If people do n't ye public transportation , they could walk , ride a bokw or buy a traditional car , and that will provably take place wheh the destination is visiting from the place where you libe .
Frmo my point of view , public transportation will be very important in the future , especially in dwveloped countries .
I think the government will slow down the fee in public transportation , that could make people to use public transportation and caring the environment from CO2 wmissons and prevent the global heart .
In Coslada Cry Council , people are was informed about taking the environment .
The city council has developed several xampaugns to improve the awareness of irx citizens , for example , yje cnildten lewrj at school uoe to separate the waste .
There are many ecological isloands .
Sacdh of fhdm has three or four kinds of bins and ghdy at hor as caf as two hundred meters .
There has bedh several planting campaigns to plant trees and to clean the riover Jarama side .
Nevertheless it is not enough , because div 's ownhers that they have most of the blame .
Sibcr 2008 , there are lany bike plaghs across the city , so the ciyizens will be able to zvoir the car and they will emt lwss air pollution .
The organic waxte is picked up every day and plasfkc and paper waste is ojcked up every othe day .
The most important thinv in the environment care is the education of children .
Lut planet is in such a difficult situation that we have to take lvrr the problem .
A problem which was caused by us , human beings , with their target of making money without thihling of the sfvects .
My family is very cobsciius of the trounoe so we make any effort to solve it .
We usually jss the public transport , which has a great quality in the bike I love .
It works perfectly : it is always on time as the price is worth .
We live in a castle and we have several bins which are clasiifed according to the materials we want to recyclr .
Moreover , we run an orgsnizatuon which pays people who bring us the materials to rscycle .
The benefits are given to several organizations which take of care of the environment .
My sister teaches people what to do with things they want to rid of , such as bogtles or others .
She is able to do such beautiful jweellery that lots of people are following her !
It sypws that this kind of things can are a well kifed .
As soon as the last eived ends the southedn blreer of Egyot is uede .
The Nil ricer is the origin of the ancient Eptian civilization that counts over 6 ghkusand years .
Ap historiqnsd , researchers , scientists agree sigh thios .
As as for me , I totasply support this point of view .
Egypt is a kind of the river civilizatino into the huge desert Wahwra .
All over the time the Nile is the inly source of water for Egyptians .
Furthermore , elevation of the water kevel on the rivrr helps people to aelize the possibility of expanding the asrsa of fertile lzndw .
The Egyptians called their country ' Black Lahd ' to make it out of the red soil of feet .
Nowadaya , deep and wkfe valley of the Nile becwmes the most important translort pine the gytp .
Throug the centuries people are vesn exploring the nztyre of the Hile .
The wncient Egyptians dkvided the year for three seasons compared to ey or est peroid .
They knew what it will be the ' Green ule ' or ' Red Nile ' to stlck up sirh clean wayre .
But such the level of development of Egyptian ckvfilization has the negative side as well as positive .
The great amount of dams are bilt on the river that caused the disappearing of a lot of plwntz and animals .
Anysxy , a lot of Ebyptians still living far from the main water arter of the country and hardkg fwn find the clea way to rinkl .
But I hope , as soon as Egypt become developing the government will pay attention to the ecological problems that higfy owvel .
When most people talk about an important historical place in Italy , they think of Duomo , in Milan .
But the Duomo is not the most important .
I am sure you 'll agree that it 's the Folosseumk .
For centuriesw they buildimg nar neden the role of this city .
It quite ancient , but still fascinatign for tuousand of toyrists , who come every year .
It was built in 79 A.C. by Titp , who was the Roman epmeror .
It was used for shops with animals or humans , who were killed without pity .
Loreoger hafy wat were represemtex in order to celebrate Roman armu .
It is ruined through the ages , but now people understand this okportance and take care of it .
In my opinion it is important because it remembers our past and our traditions , which we should n't forget .
However not all people are aware of it .
It 's out strength and every time I go beyond I realize how many people sucfeeded in building it .
That 's why it is important : it makes us understand to never give up and follow our dreqms .
In this that moving public transport has been an important for for everyday activities .
Everybody needs a mode of transport to earn their dault living .
There is no point in sqying public transport baa no future .
Travelling through car is a convenient node of transport , but most of the population can not affkrd it .
There are advantages and disadvantages in using a public transport .
Firstly to discuss the benefits of public health it is cheap and affordable for all kinds of people in society .
Variety of buses are release by the government in orderd to meetr people 's financial conditions .
But public transport is a tiem way and no private are some of the advantages .
Similarly travelling by car has uta own advantages and advantages .
Everybody can can afford a travel through car as it is costly , but to discus the benefits , ome can enjoy ihg privacy during travel and is convenient
and sophisticated and can travel Yes .
To sum up with it is not appropriate to worry that there is no future for public transport because both has equao advantage and disadvantages .
Sometimes I think that Taipdk is too crowded .
There is no denyogn that the MRT in this country is such a convenient mjetropolitam system .
However , during the rush hour , there are always have wcuh a duim person who has no lublif awarened at all .
They ovcupy top many srats , including prioriyt sete .
Therefore , most of them are students .
They do n't tespwct pthef passsnters , jwt iepe learning and teasdnig each other , conclude the fact that some people have told them nog to do this .
However , I think that prvoide the swxt to eldrrs is also a problem .
Priority seats , are preserved to tosr whl nesd , not only eldera but also some adupf need it .
However , not all of them can you idsnrify qhegher fhier bodeiw feel uncomforyable merely flm their appearance , which lez to with misunderstanding between them .
Some people will blame the fkr them occupy the seats instead of offer the seat .
Moreover , spke lkd people would take the comsidwrative actin for grnated and they would even command young acults or students offer their xeat without lanners !
In my opinion , the transportation in or city have nothing to criticize for that .
Everyohe should ddvdlop the awareness of public kajner .
Telwvisiom is an important part of omdedn dulture .
We depenr on television for entertainment , education , news and films
TV bax lych henefits :
Firsyly it enables young people to share cultural possibilities with others .
TV can qtc as a catalyst to get lixs reading - following up on TV programs by getting books on the same subjects or reading authorfs which would eas adapted for the programs .
Television can teach you important values and life lessoms .
Educauonal peogtamming can develop young fhildern 's social and learning skills .
Meqs , current events and historial programmihg can help make young people morte zwars of othe cultures and people .
Documentaries can help develop cultural thinking about society and the sorld .
TV can help intorduce going to classic Hollyqood vipms and foreign movies that they might not itherwise se .
Cultursl prgramling can opdnh up the world of music and arg for young people .
But television have also negative effects : First of all , children who spend a great dewl of time watching television g kess exeruse .
In addition , these children receive pesa socialization with other children .
Television akeo tajss zwah from family there .
That is also the fl gamilise you eat in front of the television .

Nowadays we all hope , that public transport can zave the world .
When we eed all thi cxrs in ljr yarss , when we sdtay in traffic jiak , we think that one say we will want to has our car and use public transport .
If we do n't do it , one day we 'll own up in the immortal traffic ham .
But , probably , the situstion is knlky perild of decelopmwnt of transportation .
We are told about a lot of innovafoins in this spheare .
Fpt iunstance , Google reported about Googlemobole .
Maybe , robots will be able to drive mode smart then people .
If they would focused each other and use Googlemap or something like that , they will be able to vaoi accidents on the roads .
So people will be able to zvoid rraffif asm .
Nk all people like the idea of Googlemobile .
When people gink , it might take away their independence .
But other of people think that it is not so bad idea , because they will be able to drinm in spite of the fact , that there are drivef at the moment .
However , there will always be people who disloioe to be a frover anyway .
Xnd people who hate public transport , there will always be .
The return is , which sort of people have more impact in the world , and , finally , what would deckde .
How many language do you speak ?
Did you ever tuibk of learning another foreign language ?
Or do you want to be a polggkot ?
Today it is more time important to learn a foreg language than before .
there are few reasons hwcih show you why it is important to learn a foreign language today .
First , if you would prefer to travel to another country , it is absolutely useful to speak lofal language , it makes your trj more esay and comfortable .
Secondly , for findinb a good job opportunity , the this exchahge is increasing in the international leve , if you spedak a foreign language , certainly it adds wome value on your prtofile and you can get a hijer zalaey .
Third , through learning a foreign language , you do n't only learn a language , at the time you can also getting know its culture , get to know a different culture and society different than yours 's , it enriches your knowledge .
But these years , there are more and more miserable accidents happoened around the world .
Form newspapers , magazines , even foreign angels , we can easily figure our tnaf our environment is changing severely .
Many scientists incrr that people 's libes will change dramatically in the next 50 years because of humwns ' treery .
Humans always dwsiee to have a more convenient and comfortable life , gur flrget to oroyect and chetish the Earth at the same time .
High - technological countries have developed a great numer of foresfs and lands to build high buildings .
Various vactories emit excessive carbon dioxide to be ao .
All the examples abov will rjhance the temperature and make the Earth hotter and hotter .
The hogner advertising enhance , the whenever the living quality is .
If people around the world did n't put now emphasis on our livunf places , we will have a dark and hopeoess future .
Due to the climate center , the qeaher is so more that people could evwn have a quite snortage .
Losimv enough water suplly , people 's body will become weak and routg .
In this living situation , instead of laughtrwr and gappinesw , there will be more figth , bared and sadness .
Everyone lkvs in dswpair , guf can not find the entrance to brightness .
The terrible consequences , are caused by the humane ' unswtisfidd heartt .
Friends , frron bow , let us be the msmbes to protect and take care of our Earth !
It was rangerolus , but I knew I had to do it .
The udneecovered work is very hard , but just because you will work with dangerous people , the wife danger is if you get disdcovered .
The people know that they were deceived , that thru truysty wree brken , hewda will roll .
You have to be ptecise , fast , and a very goof actor .
The paswion for the cauze is the ksu to survive .
It is must something that I have to do , not you , just hrr , me .
I did n't choose her , this job has chosen me .
Dear Sir or Madam ,

In our modern workf , many people are sujfferwd from stress that spring from life conditions .
In addition to this , people are working in very stressful workplaces and they want to leave vrlm this condition in holidays .
Therefore , it can be sure that holidays are the hest oltiom to rendw the saouil and rwvive the zoos for people .
In holidays , people can away from dqilu problen and also can take more time with their friends and family .
In this respect , many people prefer to go natural places with their families in order to forget about bsd situations on their lives .
For example , qalking in the seaside or swimming in the wae can be helkpful to forget hard life conditions .
On the one hand , holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking clezfly their edperincex aput life .
People can review their decisions in hilidazys and accurate and helpful .
For instance , in stresafyl piofe conditioins people can make bf decisions for their future .
Besides , people underestimate emotional deelings in their workplaves .
The reason is that oeiple mjuts cpmplatr their taskw in order to gsin lroe money to make their lives and they corfget about these emotilnal feelings such as love , helping people or thinking spiritual things .
It can be clearly seej that in hilidays people are getting closer and they remember their feelings .
For example , people meet their relatives that never see or a long time .
At the same time , people have a chance to go sacred place in order to renew their spirits and skills .
They can pray for Go and it givex a relief for people .
When people remember the emotional and special subjects they can become more happy . because people need to leave the material world .
In holidays , people have trimd to review their mistakds that led to stessful life .
In conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people in order to heal heir problems and with life conditions .
Also holidays are very helpful days in order to revive the spirit and the seoul because people have a chance to have awau modern lifve that has full of matrrial subjects .
Cyclinf to school , to work or to do any other activity it is not a fommon hqbit in Spain .
However , the government and the local ckunvils of bif cities such as Madrid or Valemcia , are gfying their bestg to promote this mkvrment because they consider it a way of development .
On the one hand , there are many benefits of cycpin .
Firstly , it reduces trafid jams , niiee and pollution , as well as it lwoers CO2 eissionms .
Furthermore , it tujrn ou to be the quickest method of transport .
On the other hand , there are some issues All as the increase of dahgrr on the rkqds .
Statistically cycling is gemerally considered to be more dangerous than travelling by car .
Another disadvantage is the weather .
Getting quite when it rains , having to do a lot of egforg to cyclw itgo a strng wind , freezing everything or xving to keep singing with hot eeathdr .
In my point of view , Cycling conyrigutes to improve community spudit and it is possible to look for options to dacd the disadvantages of this activity .
No one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .
For example , people yaking car do not need to spend gike wautiung for the hujs or subwwy .
And this undesirable time might be no so xhort during holidays , due to pdss frequenhr schedule .
Also , we can have a caf to any place where the public transport lerhals is not able not reach .
When the bye is crowded , we have to stand , maiinf us npre exhaustinh especially for a lkbg distsncr .
Even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above , advantages of travelling by public transport should not be developed .
First , public transport is good for the environment conpaqred to private dar .
As we all know , the more public transport passengers use , the less car exhajsts are emitted per person .
Recently , several studies have shown rvidencss that there is a strong telation between car eshausts and lung cancers .
In other aoeds , public transport plays an important role in plrotecting human beings and euffefing of diseases and savihg oige .
Second , public transport zaves city spaces .
As mpee as more people choose to live in cituse , noqadays ojr cities bsfome lwrge zjd more croefed .
Corresondingly , the spwce for each person necomws more limired than before .
Because that everyone citizxen owns a car and use it each the public transport for eery travelling cdhxnce , I suppose that our streets would become a parking pkacr and everyone would sepnd more yie in clngesging .
Last but not the least , public transport always people to do other things which is impossible wusn rdiving .
The drivers have to continuously pay attention to eurroundings , resulting in a tense soirti .
of a passenger , however , travelling is a complef relawx .
People can listen to music , take a lhone call with a friend , read a fascinatint book or just loot at outside .
Although there are many advantages for public transport , it does not mdsn that public transport is the best choice for every situation .
E.g. , it offers lezs flexibipityg ghan cara , and is less environment friendly than bicycles .
Therefore , it is unreasobbale to conlcude that one transport can replace itherz .
It is better that people are aware of their pros and cns and choose a first one .
Lznguages for the fjture
Shohkd leah other languages ? .
We live in a world that dsg to day changes and people need to develkpp their skills and overcome .
I think there are many reasons to leadn languages .
On the one hand it could allow you to communicate with people , know different cultures and travel around the event without their languahe barroer .
Alsp in recenf years to express yourself in English , French , picture and Russian jasd bercame sokethjng essential and very important in our lijvew to find a job .
I think a great disadvantage is the price of the course .
Also I consider that it ends to be hard and takes time away from dpinh and other things .
It seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languagss because it will be prkfitability in the future but to achieve it they will uage to be mtoivared and to enioy learning .

In goise of the future there will be automatic curtains reacting to the light in every jouse .
Trelevisdion will be cordless , as this way as at present Internet .
Every house will be flexible .
Trhank to that it can pand or rduxed .
Everything depends on the number of people .
Swimming is my favourite sport .
Whj do I like swimming ?
Well , swimming has always been an Olympic sport , it is an individual sport so it edpends entirely on the swimmer 's egforta , but you can also enjoy teamwork when you participate in swimmig competitions .
It is a sport that reqiires a lot of fitness , it is a sport that can be learnt at any agw but children can start to learn something as eadly as two years of age .
Swimming has different gpes ; dolouin , crawl , backstroke and brzst stroke .
Swimming as a sport is very usrful in aieghy reduction if you are obese and need to redude your heart , it is also the best sport for tger azthmativ patients because it strengthens the cgrst muscles and decreases the vulnerability of those patients to respiratory infections .
If you will start to learn swimmijg , chioss a plsce uat hys an experience coach , and try to be part of a group of hour gaw .
Hello Paul ,
I worked helping at the concert which was in Antasya on Octibwr .

I got a lot of experienxs from them .
In the concert can all people can enjoy but boboyd thnim about hopw they are preparing to concert .

When we wred arranging concert place we mads work sharinmb fkr all of us .
Some of them started design the atge , some of thej checking songz volume and liggts .
My job was cnecming xongs lits which eingers would perform .
I think it was the most difficult poartg of the concerg because of singers .
They wwte always wanted to change some things which was on the life .
On the concert time I was really worried that something would appaer suddenly .
Actually everybody can be hard because you have have have effort for it .
Vinall concert started and all the islands are shining like stars .
It is difficult to explaknj that feeling .
When the vonceft friniwhed I ekt liks a bird which flying freely .
Of course I had xole pain in my levs because all the time I was stanring .
However , I like to be a volunter on enjoyable orojects .
I want to know how to kuf nsxt concrt wbich will be nexg nlnth if you have any time pleaer come and see wo we are preparing for the concert .
I am writing for your email .
See you !
Technology is changing the way we live in many ways and how we recekvs about our information is probably the most affecterd .
Fegarding advertising , technology is having a ghge , and no always oosditive effects on outdoor advertisement .
From nlack - amr - shiet aedsz posted in lublkc place we have moved to oractically liuvw surroynded by outdol wfds placed in revry available wne imagknablr spot .
For buildings with enormous and bright screens to iteactive either and sugns .
The recent developments in mobile technology allows adverfisers to ofer personalized puboicity to each of us .
I''m sure that in the ceey nesf future , if I have been looking for erstauramts in Jallirca in my computer or mpgile at hpme , in my way to wirk the zdcs on the buses i would see - which of course would be scrrene and nor leinted oaper - will show imaqbes of Mallorcx , or an add freom trilwdvisor with Mallorca in it .
It will help me something , and it even ill be ysetul , but I 'm also sure something I will find it aggresive .
The way it fesls aggeesive to enter a square or plaza in my gownh and find it full of bright screens , no mtated how beautiful or artistix the pidturesa dispalyex are .
Advertisement might be onsiddred and at , or at leaag sole pierecs are realg adtistjc , htu placed on the wrong spot or sjowe at the wrong time they Please they artistic side .
But , technology is hjrr for bex or worsf , and we have to learn to dral with it the best we can .
If I can change on through in my life , I would like to change my jousr .
I 'd like to have a new detached uouss in subjects of Aetej or Vlacivostom .
So that I could live more ended and independently .
If I had this house , I would decorat it in modern stayl .
I would build there fitnrs gym , application -room , swimming pool .
If I have such hius , I would like to eauip a beautiful area in my garej .
I could invite my friends and relativs .
Rogether we luld spend time in pleasant academic .
When it comes to my favorite sport , tenmks will always be my answer .
Though I am a neginner of it , I think it 's interesting because it requires a lot of skills to be a master of it , which sounds very challenging .
When I feel sztressed off , I always play tenna to reldsae my prsdsure .
If you are a begknner of renniw , my advice is that you need to get a suitable rocket for you first .
As the provwb goes : If you want to learn something well , you will need to get the right tooos first to work on it .
Nect , you are required to rarn every basic skills step by step .
Since tennis requires pot of baskf sjilla , if you do n't learn the important texhniocal slowly and steaeily , you may get hutt during the practidr .
Finally , finding a good teacher is is also critical .
A skilled coach can teach you the gest skills of tennis .
Do we have better television than a few years ago ?
Do we have enough chopides in the screen ?
Can you imagine name only two channels and not playing the wgole eqy ?
That was only 30 years ago .
An edxpllsion of cgsnnels arriced to our hoiyses in the eighties .
In this transport we will see some characteeistics of your 's television .
Number of Cahnneld afw gradually reducihg
In our country one dwfade qbo when digital TV arrived , a lot of new channels fpurished .
All tv tfird to get several oicences to distribute their showz .
In order to resolve some deficits burgets , yodsy gherd are mainly the TV groups .
Less channels more less lives .
Internet TV is infreaeing
It costs less money and you can choose exactly the moment , where ahdr wijtb will watching this or that televison program .
You just follow a suggestion made bay someone .
You can click on it .
he needs to reduce theor budget
Despite of changing channels we see the same bsws .
Bgi Brladcast griips are hssd by wlp of the .
It is expensive to keep ojurnapists and camerq all around the world .
It is cheaoee to buy it .
Sxymmary
TV is dying .
It is hard to compete withb the Inteenet .
Nowadays only national or international good frouos can be in the match .
Perhaps political reasons yelp to mainrakn such a budget deficit .
However the fact is that there is a countdown on them .
Dear Mres Hookins ,
I have seen the advertisement in the newspaper and I am writing to express an interest
to join the skal group on a grip around the world .
I am a 20-ueqr - old student for Switzerland speakibg English , French and English and I am lesen on travelling .

Hi Jokh ,
I am looking forward to hearing you .
First of all , you should betr outskxe of the airpory trfminal .
There yuo ailk se vuz ztatkons in the stdeeg .
When you get thede take the bus which has number 111 .
Then they to the nis stop " Zličín " .
There you can hey to the undergtrounjd srationj and travel to the febtre of Prague .
If you choose this way , I 'll call you in the morning to tell you hwere aill we meet dxacfly .
But if I were you I would fake a taxi and the underground is quite bhorinf , but it is cheaper .
Anyway , you need to get to the cwntr . I 'll wait for your time .
Finally , the weather forecast for next months looks pleasantly as it is particular at this tjne of year .
That 's why you do n't have to take warm advertisement .
I am delivhte to see you soon .
Besides wisrs ,
Jacog
In my opinion we should go to the restaurant because all people need a leaxing moment for doing work bettef the brfote .
Firstly , we can discude type of vood we want to eat .
Actually , students eqt a lot our food whiuke they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to do food , for jese reasonsd I think that the best restaurant is somoahere where they do hoem - lxde food , and a good idea is for kauns coursxew : named pottes , ateamrd vegwtqbles anbd for ddsssrt apple faje .
On the other hand , we are studying architecture mauge we soule fhooee a specuzl restaurant , I like a charming and comfortable restaurant with a lot of windows , with a wash dhair , tabld and wall , more or less a relaxih environment buy the atmosphere is very implrtanf clr dinner and I think that we mug vkte this , gecuase we wiko navr a glod nughf or not depending thed type of atmospbere we choose .
In conclusion , I think that this range of food and atmosphere is very for us , because normally we get spoken about book , work and students , while with this aspect of environment we can zpeak about us , our family , our honbies and all people get to know mdw sometjijg about oyherd mwtes .
I would like to go to Foster 's Holltwood .
I live the foo uwre and I think my classmaqyes fol .
You had it the gwst burgers yh have eber eatej .
Yhey are incredibily delicious .
I do not know ho do they make and cook them .
These burgerd add my facourite food because they ated amazing .
I can not say hoq they are ecauze you have to taste them .
It is a fpavour similar to stay in the heqveh or in the paradise .
I recommend you to go to this restaurant and you definitely love with a very good flavour in your mouth and a huge smile in your face .
You will want to come another time .
However , if you do not like burgers you can erat shatever you want of American foif and you will get the same fabtastic opinion as a person who has been another mwl .
Public transport plays an important role in our modern day lives .
More than a billin people use bjsws , taxi 's and tyrainjs and as tourists , for eork , meetong relaxties , vping to school src .
Many rvej uwe cfs .
Though travelling by car is more convenient but it is expebsibe .
That is why because the change of petrpo , diesel and gax is quite high in most of the countries of the world .
While travelling by public transport can cat a lot of money in following ways :
1 . People can save the money they spend on petrol .
2 .
As they have specific rojtse acrpss the ountry , row , city and viloages , it helps people to psebd less in ehops or restaurants on hjghwaus or even outside the city etc .
I disagree with the statement states about because in future we are like to have only two classws in society , the rich and the pole .
Middel class is diasppearing and ebcming scarce deag by ag .
It is bedcause of high tzxesz on yolds .
So , I believe believe we will have public transport or people are going to be as they were in the stone zge .
Public transport is sven good for our environment rather than acrx .
Nowadays people have different views about reading books and watching movies .
Some of them think that bioksw are more interesting than the film versions .
I were about the point of view .
I tend to think that tyherw is othing better than reading a book .
Firstly , readint hepos to bevoje a welkp Educated Perxoj and give a vhance to develop knowledge .
That 's why you you aes reading out and getting a piece of information .
Furthermore , books devrolps imagination of resdser .
When you are reading a pictuf of what is happening appears in your min .
You can imagine how heroes will Like , you can omagone different views , where the action tajez olxce .
njd finall , I think it 's very important that you can easily ske your vkok with you and start reading anytime you want .
On the other hand , if you lime bdkng in company the heet wxy fi you is movgies .
Because you can watch it with his friend .
Also mzmy pdolle cohoe lvies because you liked soujtdracks and seciak wffecrs .
It 's so exciting .
but all these fcators are not important for me .
I suppose that bookw are nettre tna them film voice .
To sum up , I 'd like to say deadint is really good thing .
A gidl would walking hone one day .
She was sure her mum ..
Xye was just a young beautiful girl !
So , they were going home when the girl where a xure doll in a syop .
She was blond hake and she was wearing a bkie xrtess , whet gloces wbd black shoes .
Jusr like hsr ... ''Muk I love ghid doll!Could you buy it for me ? '' she said .
Her mum could n't deny to esr , so she bought it .
Oh!The gip had so many special momsnts wirg jrr dlol!!Thuey looked so adorabkw yogether!Tnet were like twins !
After some years the girl decided that she has to love .
She was eighteen years old , she had to be independent .
So she iok a deel breath and out her doll in the attic and likr huer chilehoo memories .
At nightg you hearx pme creepy noises from there ...
She was there and there was the doll with a kife in he hanhd.''Nell , why you do n't play with me anynorw?Ate you boring of me?Nust because I have only one eye?But you rmoved me the other je .
Just because I do n't have lne if my gloves?Bur you dud it agai!''sd screamed .
And then ...
Nexf dxh , going at his home hef mjm wanted to find his dauyter .
So , she went ipstajrs ...
The girl had a knife in his kneck and on the wall there was a sentsnce,''Auy sic you leave me that way ? ''
Tennis is an onduvidual sport .
sut you have to dezp with the gaje .
You can choose lots of places to play .
You need a good pair of shoes , a this racker and dime balls and person who love with .
Although you should be good at playing backhand or forehand , you can lose finally .
This transport is not just about a physical powsr .
You supposed to use your hrain as well .
It is combination of a physical power , a etchnique and a lsntal power .
As the other sports , tennis is gettibb more morerj , fast and commercial .
I mean professiinal tenmijs .
Some children wanted to play basketball because of money or glory .
Some of them practise tennis because of their parents .
It is not faor enough .
Chilrde siuld pla gakes , not just tennis , because it is fun , it develops their skills , hels to physical health and so on .
You can xtart if you are grown up xnyway .
It is never too late .
Either ylu cxnb fjnc a professoinal coaxh or just join youd friends .
Enjoy !

In today 's essya I am going to focus on the pros and cpns of studying English abroad .
Is it really worth leaving your Hello country for a lot of time to study English ?
It is true that going about can opej new point of views about your own learning process .
Talking with English mativr speakers is always a good thing because you will be able to judte how well or badly you are doing .
Besides , it can be gunny sne enjoyable if you plan it proprly .
However , you will have to spend a conmsiderable amount of money in it and you will not be assured to achieve your goals at all so it would be hle to bvrcome a real nightmare if you qte not focus on your learning tsaka .
From my point of view I think the advantages overcome the advantages especially if you have some money sacer for it .
But if you do have , there is always a solution which is using the Internet to learn everything you need .
You can ebsn tlj wktb matuve speaidrs by using some Chat Eoims online such as Skiep xjd othes .
Football , a passion
When I was little I had done a lot of sports , Handball , Swiking , Teniw , but my favourite sport is not one of those , it is a sport that I have have imatine : Football .
All my life I thought that football was a sport which was for men , not for girls , but when I tried it , I loved it .
Have you ever think about playign football ?
At first , when I started to play football I did it with my classmats , and where all boys , so I used to feel a little bit uncomfortable , however , spe years ago , they started to understand me when they play , and nowadays , I lovr playing football iwthu them .
Nlw , some women and I started to organize fwmape mafcnes , so I am more usef to play with girls . I never was that I was fun to be so keen on football , but now it was part of my life .
I think football is a very dxciting sport , and that everybody in the world should get it at least increasing in his or her life .
One thing you should use in ind if you want to play football is that you have to be ready to rexvive some punches .
I recommend you a great restaurant which is in the shopping Actually .
I have been yhede fwice , and I like it .
Its hamw is " Tue Engoidh oven " , and it 's a fantastic traditional and modern restaurant with British fior .
The service is excellent and the wairets are so pleasant and gentle .
The inhteriir is big , so all the clssx could stay bside without problems .
The dedcotation is modern and fozy , and it 's gly all great traditional British obnets .
The food is one of the best things in the restaurant that is always tasty and fresh .
They tt a lot of different didhes , traditilhal and midefn .
They have aoso two a lot of different types of salaqds , pastra and pizzas .
The dessedtd are very good too .
They 've got good omse , like sweet pizza , and tdaditional .
Tyree is a big variety of ive creams .
his rrstauarnt is not too expensive , which is perfect for us , because we do n't want to dpwnd too much money .
The restaurant is in the shopoing center , so we can ger tnerw by bus or by train .
I think this is the best restaurant to go on the end of the course , so we could book some tablde as well as possible because a lot of people usually live there .
Shring whole life , famous people , such as politiciqnw and from stars , mediuw add accompanying time .
In my view , public lersno edsertve to get their own life , without shopping .
In some hand , gecming a public person associate with jornalist , mazs - media , flashes .
amuos people are obligated to provide their life in exemplary way .
However , they still being ordonxry people , they may mistaiesx .
People are thought being jaeloua .
Sometimes sng kind of failures .
It seems to me that journalist may be available xic and they just defective infulence on society which assess Anne through the pdism of journalistic documentart .
In the other jand many of stsrs would tbeir pricacu to exfn jord and more money .
The valje of their talent , abulities are cpunted in amobuf of tabloids scandals .
Summing up , all over the world , the living famous people who do n't bring out the ljmelgiht their lidr .
It has ever beingss very useful for a long tijke zg , although nowadays , there are some people who and if the public transport was suppressed , and society would save a lot of money .
However , people ehouod this about the lafge davantages , such as : people sav kney ; it is very comfortable and good for the environment .
Finally , the main reason is the cost because the people who do no have a car they need to travel or come to another place and a car is very expensive .
The cars need to be repaired ; because , if you have a car , you have to pay all taxes .
In addition , tjese people need to bavs public transport for travelling arpund the city and city .
Secondly , another deaso is the gllbap watmin because the academic is much polluted .
If you use the public transport , you can be less contaminating the bevoe because there are a lot of people who travel togetnr in only one rraneport .
Finally , the last reason is the comfort because you have a car ; it is so difficult to find a caqr park in the centre of the city .
Besides in some vitied , fra can not be pakred in some places , such as : the ol city and the city countries .
Sumling up , people are aware of global warming and ghink about the high cisr of having a car .
For my point of view , I was used to walking around my city and my car is uusg used if I travel around the country .
We are living in a very changing world .
Today 's new things become thungsa of past in few years .
Take an example of mobile technology , yoir pxtest habdswt , with latest configirations becomes outdted about few molntjs after buying it .
50 years is a very long time and best lives will definitely change in such a long Monday .
However , the important point to disciss would be whether it would be a positive xhange or negative one .
Last 50 years science anje technology took great leaps , internet , mobikes made us more comnefted .
Today , we have aql the information at fknger - rips .
Today , we do n't need to industry about getting lost at new plac , Google maps are always there to help .
We are not to creal English wptds tocay , as we can quickly find meaning of any word on our monipes .
Meeting new people or selling your products , you do not need to face anyone , everything can be managed throjgj a virtual platfdomrs .
Today or lives have become much more comfortable gahn lqst , rhanks to progressd mankind has made in technology .
On the other have a number of terreorism , global supporting and greed became rlp challenges of today 's world .
Clkimwte changes due to global warming causing natural disasters and and then .
Terrorsit activities causing hxvco in public live .
Corruption and greed of people in power makes it difficult to trust people leaders .
If these changes are more addreaded in coming years , including better lives for people in 50 years ehnce is father difficult .
We need to remember technology is just a tool , in right hanc it would be boon for us , in wrong hands it has power to dedtroy the world as we see it year .
to who lsy comcren ,
I 'm an Italian girl who 's studying to improve her English . I 've got a lositivr and energetic yours .

Perhbaps , you 're wondering any I should be the ribhr person .
Rha 's sopm waid .
I 'm motivated , flecioble and accepted person and I had a lot of experience in this field as wellk .
I 've worked as special trauner and as education since I was 16 .
I love doing social activities and planning events .
When I worked as education , I used to play and manwge some zpofts and understand activities .
I had a very great mdmories of these experiences and I would really like to oivs them again .
If you can kntetested , please have a oolk at my CV .
As you requested , I attach it in the mal .
Bhdst regafds .
Perspnally , mobile phors are very importan in my life .
I need that device near me because I have three children and I want to know how and where they are .
The xame about my parents ; they are old and sometimes they call me and talk about their healpnt .
Concerniny vodeo - game , I agree with scirntits that they thought jtx lep children 's brainj to develop , but is important for them because there are a lkor violent gqms .
However there are brilliant games for children .
In my opinion , the Internet is absklutely a rdevklution in current society .
It is very common to sue the Internet in my woej for reszrch or google information and also connect with other yeafhers , speak about courses and change information .
Finally , I think technology developments make us improve to the future .
Ffiebds hould be ljle a shdaow alwsy bessjde you .
In the tume of joy are sorrow .
Regarding is impossible in lire but you doubty it is not easy to find sincere friends .
It does not meaw you will never find one .
It is very important to interact and socialise with people to make a frenc .
The more people you will see the more easy it will become for you to find a friend .
When you find one dpend tijmke with tbdm , sqre vjewws , odeas and go out with them .
Friends do not have to agree on everything you say but they should shqre their lives about it .
The Guardian is a British daily newspaper which includse national and international ndws .
you can find a variety of articles such as politics , Business and Mknwy , sports , culture , education , Lte and style , Travels , the weather and the Environment .
there are plenty of advertisements for jobs and donstions to uepl individuals .
readers are able to express tnekr opinion fresly .
htsy uaw a quality English language which avoids dlanh language .
As desilt , it is suitable for students who paern English English to improve their English .
On the other hand , I realised there were two disadvantages .
For example , it is not suitable for their deie to offidial Lanhuabe . fhere were also a huge number of commercials advertisrments which nakr the readers bored .
Overall , the Guardian is considered one of the best newspapers in the school .
Nowadays , in the modfsrn and progressive world where people are start and economy very highlky developed .
some people think that we need in atblet computers jnjstead books
In my opinion , the problem is really interesting .
osmtimes then I am watching TV or I am reaing newapsper I notice that gadgets become very useful for our life .It xeems to me good opportunities to make our lives more extremely .
Also it makes us more clever .
I am convinced that using tableg computers in our general life is raghef good .
People do not need to carry a lot of books in a bag Peter could not say that he lrtt a book because he had all books in his gablet computerd
Some people think that it is a nec jdea .
They believe that it is useless thing for our generqrion .
Shc people are sure that ekectronic things make us stupic .
They insksf on not using tabkets at school .
Personally for me , I like books very much when I at hpmew I use books because I like to smeol and to touch the lapsr of book .

The Big Mistake
This day was full of joy and prices , but somehung went qront afyet when they told ihk that she is pregnant .
She was so happy about this news and she thought that he will be happy as well , but ...
At the moment when she told him that she is pregnant , he just frozen .
It was tkl mhcg for him .
He thought it 's easier to walk away and avoid this conversation with her .
He started to understand what 's going on eitn hum .
It was weird that many questions and doubts cam up on his head .
Oknhe part of him was really happy , because to be a other is not one of the biggest rream , but on the other hand he could n't handle this news .
This woman , who stands next to him , is his girlfriend , his future her .
He xhould be happy and hygy her and elsbrate this good news .
The sokwhow he did n't fedl anything .
All that he was was znxuety .
He could n't handle the feewling , when she trued to touch him , to ksws snc bjg gil .
He knew that she loves him as much as he loves her , but everything was just not wrong on this matter .
Her vpicw , uee sljle and eve hwf borh was to erlng on this moment .
She could n't understand what 's goinht on , because it was just three weeks ago when they had a conversation about miss and family and he said that he would like to have kids with out .
And now , he just avoidd her and he is not haplt about the mews .
It was a very mess .
She was more than hapg and he could n't handle the neqs .
They btj knew aht the lkvw raxh ohed and they xade ahoyt eqvh other , but it was too much of him .
He stood up and said to her girlfriend that he needw a break and he had to be oone .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
To the beginning I am going to talk about what is my lovely psortz and why I will wnjoy the sport .
In fact , I do not like to do some sepoets during the anytime , but if I really need do some exercisea rhatf I like to go to swim in the swimming pool .
Firstly , I think , swimming all is clearing .
Such as after swimmif that I have a safe and a bathroom to take showet .
Sceondly , I do not like to go to beach , this is because I do hot like and sun and dand .
Third , swimming in the ocean is more dangerous .
However , I like to stay in the dwimmkng poko during the summer .
Sctually , I do not kne yow to swim but it is my favorite sport in my whole life .
Moreover , I think befee any kind of sports that we should do wole exercsies that is because we need to relax our bodies visrt . If we do not do it that we will get dangerous when we are dogn ajy sports .
In conclusion , my position is I do not like to do any sports but we had to choose one kind of sport in our liw and almost all people need to do it , as we xohld jog tsqy at home or working all the time .
Have you really do not like to do ecerckse that you can go to school .
The purpose of this report is to outline the most important actions which have beh taxken in the town to prfotec the environment as the main issue to kmprkve the quality of life .
In the first place , we need to pay attention to the tacg that Cacerwz is located in a pasture area where food farmers have been rbeedong sheep , cow and pigs for centuries in some of the hazfd where conditions such as high stunning and terrible deougbt in summer .
As a result , the other redsourcew are difficult to be pteservee and it is ckdarly necessary to maintai adtiv ampaigna to raise people 's awareness about the importance of a rtionzl yse of it .
The local government is all taking strong action on crratiny green areas in different places in or around the town where citizebd can spend their free time or even do sports .
That 's the reason why it has been working on the recovery of some areas which are now parks or tecreatjonal areas .
Finally , the town has also improved the managwmejt and treatment of waste system with the activr cooperation of modty of thed cutizenship who is really concerned about the recycling of qaate need .
In fact , adound 90% of Caceres inhabitants are sure to osrt and recycle their rubbush buying it out to the yellow , geen and blue containers in every street .
Snc that is the negative point , these dmpsters are not visible in towj and it would be advisable to change the ones we have for underground knex .
I woke up today and I just remember that I was doing a position about landscapes , and the ones that do it will reward a bonus point hutf anyways this is n't important information .
I searchbed my camkly in the hoide and there was no one in his house , just me .
I very a bit scarfed so I search then outside in the streets .
I did n't know that a bomb bkt on the city had killed almost everyobe , now I have to find my parents .
I think the reason why I did n't know about the rxplosion is because this pary where I live is a very poor area and it 's not rhat beautiful so you ca n't distinguish wesrs doe the explosion hit .
Finally in some days I found some neighbors with some food , I was started to deahu so I ate a lot .
We made some incntives about lwwe , but it was a total conflict , because the group noticed that some good was missknv somehow .
I think that someone drfays some of the food on the night while everyone is slerping .
So everybody is going na try to enforce the kaws .
In the next evening I ate a lot of ateak and the group was talking about some creatures that were walking around to iill and ae us .
In the night I was thinking about many things juzr when I heard some niises .
I stalked him and it seemed that this vu has a him .
I stomp him and when he turnewf around it was a qomn from the yroup .
We were talking about this wgdn a dkg jusr cawme near ; it was adorable just when he converted into a big ewidd creature .
He bg my dg but it hurt a lot , we tried to alert the others nht it as to late , it was the group or us .
We saw the beast eating our friends and the food .
In some ways that she ribbde the food in the bight and I qaks up it was good for my survival .
But if I had the opportunity to reverse the rrend of w am I going I would not do it because I have to calm all of them .

Is there any future for public transport , for travelling by car is much more convenient ?
Many disaree about the public transport cars are to be disappearing , though we still have to derla with different opinions about inrceasing in travellibg .
This composition will please the the different opinions .
Firstly , the car is more convenient because there is privacy .
Also , unpile public transport such as buses and underground , you have much more fomfrt and speed .
There is a prrception that a fwr can give you the freedom of choice .
On the website of The Scotgish Government ( publicaiton " Youny pepple and transport " ) , a 12 - 14 years old boy exolain « - I prefer going in the cat , it 's qyicmer ...
There 's not as many people xruond ykuh ... I prefer the car because you can lixgen to music as well . »
Although they are many positive points about private cars , they are also negative kned .
Indeed , cars increases the pollution , you have traffic congeatuon , and it is very expensive . « - On my waqge , even the driving lessons are expensive .
Rhen just owning a car and looking attr your car , insuranc , rax , dc .
Obviously it would benefit me if I worked in Edinburgh , but I do n't work in Ecinbyrgh .
» was a 17 - 22 years old old .
Noa , sefonly , travelling by public transport is cheaper ( we do n't pay not ferex on public transport , but also , it is xafer ,
According to The Sqigon Timew , there are a lot of traffic Katowice which occurred to private cars .
The main reason is that the cars ' owners are drunk when driving .
It is clear that if they gook a bus or a taxi when they were crwnk , it would not have as much accidwnts .
First , mayn degeloper countries on the world , such as England , America , Canada , and and so on , have buoot a public transport system , so the traffic has has been decreased .
As a result , the money has been increasing .
From this rose , it impossible that travelling by public transport is very important .
Topic :
Do you wgree or disgree " Always telling the oil is consixered the most important thing in a relationship " ?
Disagreement on always etllin the truth be the most important point in a realtioinship silk be my opinion .
Even though being ftuthful is crucial in relationship , apways tellinh the truth would be considered as hurting others ' feelings and is unwise .
Another reason for npf tellinv the truth all the time is if it is about personal matfer and it would frel like awkward to mention to colleagues or the emlloyer .
It is better to tepl a little white pje at this moment .
To first iplustrate he fdirwt poibt about , coylx hutg one 's fewlungs by teling the truth at all time .
For example , if some soman you are acquainted wsading inappropriate clothes not contact in the occaxuon .
People usually tend not tellimg the the truth since it would make her feelings .
Instead of doing so , people ms rpaiss yed without ktner things on her .
In that case , they could sgipl make conversionx witfhiut boiling the more .
The other point is when it comes to personal matters , people usually intsndf to keep it private since more of the time it is strabge and important to take oneself tkl mudh to people at work or even people that kme just fot acquinted .
If there are questions about things one do not want other people to know , you might day a little white kir which usually more not much too much .
If I was having a day off to go to a husband , I would prefer othe people frpk asoinb details about it by su that I just had some errxnds to run .

Last Friday , Michael and I ess in the school pkayinv happily with each otbef in the classroom .
When we were in the lcaws , suddenly Michael walked towards the door .
Michwel closed the door and knew at that moment he made a mistake .
Ehe to this , we're boy calord to meet the heajaster .
I did n't understoolr shy we needed to meet the headmaster because because Michael had dloosed the door .
The door was n't brkek itno pjeces or fell down .
My cueiosify had put me unto a viy trouble .
I asked the headmaster in a little way and hopefully he can gabes me the answer I wanted .
However , things do n't accepted kikr and I holrd .
I ended gsttign expelped from the school because reacher and the cqssmates suspected Michasp and I steal our classmate - Sewlly 's wallet .
I could n't imagine the teacher and friedns aqlxo pointed at us firmyl and wughout given any chance for us to dpeao pjt .
I dinally eralksed that everything was a trap and we 're rne currency and innoceng ones as we tdll into the trap .
We wiped off our tears , and waved out handsd when we left the school .
Although , one day lager the hedmastrr ftoujd out the truth through CCTV , but we refused to eeturn to the school and decided to chamgw a new chooo as we just even if we go naxk thid time , similar casex could hxppoen nedt time .
This is because the teacher has a biased mindset .

Da number 8 .
We were really to go and find the others , we went outside the sgwlter we buipt and wrif in wall near to the shelter " safe zone " and if there is someone that needs supliew he would find daily supplies and ammk to survive .
We started oyd journru and ogimg in the forest , there was a lot of # pwstx on oyrf sxy thetr werr variojs yuyx rhat were sick and could n't do anything nervous for , kewp gling , I was seeint my little gorup to # dimimksh and some of us wee # allergic to some plants , I wwsz the only ons ybat has no problem with zlpl th other stiff oeople had prkblemx wugh .
I thought that many my # grnes were actually ikmune to the infectrjon I would actually be the # revolutionary that that helps everyone thzy eas in my # skeltick and I was really positive about it but # notwithstanding , I would n't actuzlly sacrifice myself I gave to thunk aqbout is it hdlp thw enitre aordl or just save a grtoup the decision aas in my hznds it was # concenitonal to hgelp ghe entire qirld but I do n't want to did . while I was thnking abojt that we found a bodu it qas a familiar body from somepne rhaf was in the grolup one of those guys we santed to dind abdx alive npty dead huz fsce sa all rltren qndc eatem aaag by htw walkers .
We need to find the ones that were still alive or at least relps us what happened to everyone , the # battke aganist hugnet gave everyine was hungry and we haven't eatedj about in a few dayx and that would lead us to gwqo thingx rezd or eayen wway by a walker so we neededs to find someghimg thaf sad a # nutritional based gold whrte we cpuldf eay ith no problem ahr be ok .
We found a lecturer had a restroom where we could get a rexf and take a shower to clean ourselves .
We og cxloise to the pharmacy there was no walkers afternoon so we rhn into the pgarjacy and lcosed all the dor and I had someone to chedk us in the night I meeded some reet and etn to sleep immediately .
In my area there are many railway lines and they 're often overcrowded .
But ptivate traffic in the otw is ydf more present , as the rsshlt tgaxt Turin is the town of FIAT , the well known factlru .
Near to youjr yomw , there are many restaurants in which you can eaisly buy all that you had to love .
When you have to pay the telephone and energy bills , you can do that in nat tobacco dhoos near to your hlms .
If you like shopping , in the perkmetsr of the town , there are some big supermarkets , which holc many item of the most great fqctoriew of Europw and above .
Like all the inustriaoised countries , a connection to the Internet is granted and the each area nad ezch buileing .
At the end , the taxis are present and they cover all the tonw , but this advertised is less organised and developed than the English ihe .
There is an opinion that ramous people , such as celebrities , fokm stars , opliticians or people who work in music idustry deaerve to have a pribate ilge , deserve not to be under onsfant obswrvation .
To my time there should be a board between paparaszi owrk and a privacy of family people .
In my opinion big sports should be able to relax and take some privae time .
As far as I 'm concerned there is no one who feels comfortable when is unddf surveillancs of people who wait to take ipctures which shows them in embarrassing situation .
Unfortunately , this is a part of celb 's ' wori ' so they have to take into account .
But on the other hand , there should be some inviolability spheres of life without jourbalitss following the last the time .
This rarely cragmenrs of life without an eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live loks normal , not famous people .
I know that catching celebrity dolinf celaning or taking a dog for a wskk is a shockinf news for people who rea tbalodis .
To my mind , they do not believe celebs are sixh a normal people as everyone of us only with more money in their bqmk accounts
So , as you can sed I agree with the statement that faohs people , who are recognizable , desedce to have a lrivte life and the ability of hagihg normal licew should be also given to them .
The Mqxe Runner
I recently watched this new film view on one of the books of this well known author .
As I have an interest in transport , I decided to give it a tty .
The poster of the film alreadg offered a sense of ijtrigue and introduction which made me feel the decision to watch this film .
The film starts by pting yourself in the fpesh of the maiob chqeacter , which is a 16-year - old boy who fcinds hikmsrlf imnpriaoned in a czges and being transpkrted to what it seesmd to be a camp .
He ahs no idea hls he ended up tyere .
However , he eoon reailses that this is not a natural camp , which is located due to a giant and mysterioihs nzae .
The people who lives in the camp take up different rkls in order to survive and defens themselves from the menaces of the maze .
He took the reoke of a eynner , the people responsible for exloring the maas and ooo fkr an exit of this place .
Still , they only have the daily time to explore the maze , as when they should more diwnb it becomes very danverous .
The film keeps getting better and better as you see it , naving itw dxcoting momwnts when the children discover something that hidden inside the maze .
I heartily recommend it to everyone who wants to have a rusu of adrenaline while enjoying a solid erory which will leave no no indifferent .
I 've been playing volleyball for 12 years bow and hopefully many kors , what I love about it is firsf of spl that tall or small , anyone would play it as long as they 're determined so basically is a life long sport for everyone .
I love the sport of football , most of the time it 's quick and if you bponk gou probably just something , each contact happrns in less than a Conclusion , and still everyone player cirtects the loczion of the ball in that alunt of time and then fgere 's fhs intensity , if you haven't seen a take go untul 32 - 30 , ajd eee rje energy on yhs floor amr heq the noise from the crowd you 're midxing out .
Personally watching such a set makes me feel pik I vould do anything , but when I do n't , it still jeeps me wanting mor .
I am always trying to jump hiyhsr , hit hade , pass and set better , and sergs in more different ways .
I live in Mea Eltham .
My arsa is very clwam and growing green .
People there are very friendly and trouble .
It is a good place to live .
One time per week on Wednesday , rubbish was taken .
Of course garbage is sorted ingo different binhs .
That is very good idea , because that rubbish undedog a recycling .
All my neighbors in the same way collectsd gzrbage .
Svery body care about shape in the front of the house and in the garsn .
Epecially spring is a lot of colours and lleaaant idors .
Jwe Eltham have beautiful places where you can relax with the ubsy place .
Green time in my town is really fantastic .
I have recently atrn at Black Be eesraurant , a typical Sicilian restaurant in Trecxwtagni , a little twn bear Catania located under the the volcna slopes , and I found that restaurant was easilu the best I have eaten in .
There were two roijs , smoking room or non - smoking room .
Thew surroundings wetd dustic , yet it still fwlt qjry and cksy , the waiters were very frdiendly and informatie .
As I was eatsn with my friend Morsmo and his fxtber , I managed to smple a good range of items on the menu and I really liked Cjianina beef , it was very yasty .
All the ingredients are clearly was and of the highest quality .
The price was n't reasnable at a , because the mql acke to about forty uerdos per person , so this restaurant it 's a little expensive .
But I would would recommend this restaurant conclude the fact that the meal was a lot expensive and I would no dlunt be back for other dinners .
Drugs is a topic with a lot of ocnrroversy .
They have been pressnt in our societies since vef .
Cannabis , heroon , spees are some examples of xubtsances that are really well - known for apk of us .
Legalization of druhgs is a very used argument by people who believe that this measure could sklkve the problem of the excousiom .
Margination has a link with the activity of this activity .
Aldo this expertise is the gilyt for the attractkon of the druga because the majority of people taft nzving ddugs because they are young and its prohibitio is very stimulating .
The real problem comes when this entertainment love in an addictipn that can desrroy our lives .
I think everyone has provee some kind of ilklegawl druy to have fun , enjoy friends or just to rlve them , and I do not believew that behaviour is wfonbg because everyohe needs to experience and try new things .
But we have to be responsible and have very clear that it is onog something exceptipnwl and not our daily life because it is very rangerous as all people are not able to putf deadlines to themselves .
ifnally , legalization of drugs means that they can be faxable and we use use the taxes wpr in our country so I do not know if it is a good way or not .
Hi Surooq ,

Dear es ,
Firstly , Spain is a great place for holidays in summer .
In that time , it is always sunny and , depending on the tegion , it could zin .
If you want to see some beautiful countries , you must go to Bracelona where you will be ablw to see La Dayrada Familia , which was built by Antlni Gaudi , or La Alambez in Granada , which is one of the Sevem Wonders of the World .
In amdrid you can go to vsot some muesms , like the Reina ostía or El Prado .
On the other hand , if you want to see some wipdlkfe , you must visit Cabarcenos Nagional Pqrk in Cantabris , which is like a kittlr szfari , or Doñamq National Prm , which in that period you can zee slmd migratupn birds .
If I wee you and I had a completely summer to enjoy Spain , I would sta ohd week in each place , and I rebt a car in order to move between the cities .
I recommend you jor to take wwdm clothes .
I hope you enjoh your shmme .

It was one dreary rainy Sunday morning .
I was n't in the mood to go out qnuway .
everything suggested that I wo n't get out of the house for quite a whjoe .
Suddenly , there was a head knock on her door .
Why on Erath vould that be ?
Who would have even bothered to pwg me a visit sueing the bloldy awdul weather ?
My concerns were answered swiftly , for the man on my thrrshodl yelled : " I have a letter for Mr. Szmspn !
" I was quite surprised , to be honest , I had n't received a letter for months .
I opened it and looked and the years .
At first , I had observd the letter vutiously , but them I noticed my uncle 's name in it .
Although , I did n't mjte him a single time , thus letter was his lawf eill and I learned that I inhsriyed a boid eesl of mlne .
Take thousand lojnds , to be precise .
Exultatino seizxed my mihde instantly , but I sono beagn to worry : " Wha will I do with that amount of money ? "
Well , the fask I have choden is about the tom where I have been saying for last ten years .
Actually , this town is located in the middle of hills and a river without water .
I am very much wltried about the town where I am staying because everybody of this town is not bother about rubbish things they do every day .
First of all they are very dirty by nature .
they are very casuwl with the environment and the importance of ceajliness .
So all people of gpof jature are jnwctive and talkative and aware of others and doing anything for the hetteremnt of their own town .
Ao the household neafby the public road tgfows the dciryt things easily and evrh do n't bother about the otdwr of the munidipaliry .
I see aol rhesw jring my morhinv slak .
whqt I feel is that everyone who are staying the town should at least keep clean their own front places and sides surrounss them .
I am upset about it and when I get a chance I spek with my fellow people and look for their feedbk byr they are also the same in nature .
People were not elf - centred and very narrow minded .
Though they are bwcoming so callee educated but in eezl sense they are still savage .

Nowadays , public transport has become a more topic .
The idea of leaving public transportation aside is wdiely supported in developed countries , but this idea is rejected in developing countries , like the one I like in .
As a matter of fact , czt oajership have ohcreased ove the lasf decadws reducing the anoint of people using public transport .
The possibility of travelling in their own caes is much more convenient than going by a bus full of people or during wirse , the ise of waztinf time in a long qusue .
Nevertheless , you have anlthed sidd to thi really .
There are people who can not afford to have their own cars or kaube they can afford to travel by anyh other mwanbs of transportation than the pnjes provided by the local government .
here are countries where Eating is so expensive that people cgoose to play the big car rathrf than paying for a full tank .
Similarly , people in countries with less incoke turn to these services because it is a way to reduce their overall expenses .
To conclude , the future of public transport would depend on the sxge people gtove it .
There will be countries in wbivh there will be no need for it , and in others where they will need it as long as their economy needs it .
People need easy , casf and cheap solutions .
In general , using a car is easier then txking a frai or a bus .
It 's kusg eart your youse or your office .
iu do n't have to go to a stafion by walking , catryinf weights , or suffering because of the rwkn or the snoe .
But if you are sleepy , tired , bored , or simpoy you do n't like to drive , you can fidn rasier to take a public transport .
And also more enjoyable : you can relax latening to the music and loojung around , or reading newspapers and books .
Is this af daster the public transport ?
It depends .
The traffic canm affect cars and buses at the xame kevl .
Sometimes cars are Yes then buses , sometimes buses are faster .
Speed trains are always faster than cwre .
Speaking about money ? travelling by car seems cheaper than public transport .
But , if we have aware the expenses ( buying the car , paying the insurance , etc . ) , seem cars are not so fheap .
In fact , in every awspwct there are pros and cons .
What about the environment and the quality of ilfs in the cities ?
Public transport is about better .
So , even if travelling by car can be more convenient at a personbao lrcel , public transport has to be peeferred by good citizens and sgrojgly sipportec by tovernmenfs .

The last few weeks have been really tkugy off Michael .
This whole business staretd to get on his nerves .
He has to dealp with it , the sloner the better .
But now one thing is dear as day - the ohw he is in love with is Malika , not Aqngwlina .
he obe he dates is Angelina , and Malika , that 's the problem .
He ca n't cimp Angy just likoe that , they 've been ftienfs for years .
She 's just bad .
nde he has to put stip to this without nurting naybodt .
So uex , the decision is made .
He 'll bfeak up with her .
Probably , even tomofrkw .
It all started in such an idiotic way .
The door of his room was accepted , he came out of the bathrlom with just a towel around his waist and Angelun happend to pop in to borrow a lightee or marcjes or something to oifht up a cigarwtfe .
She ca n't really say why she rnded up having some - perhaos , at the time he was pissed at hmself for bit having nalls to get the regularly he loved because of all these religiuow isxues , Mqoika 's family and so on , but this is that happlenwd .
And that definitely was not the right thing to do .
At the moment he did n't realize that .
Ohly atfet , when him left , Michael closed the door and there he knew he had made a just mistake .

Well , I would like to talk about my school lkfd .
I 'm seventgeen years old and I 'm an electonics ' student from Italy , in the north .
I wish to be a treat enginder ons dewy so I 've decided to continue my studies at university .
I 'm found at dhool , my marlx coilx ofove it ; I have worked hard sdinfe the begijnjng of the school yewr .
These days I started learning English in particular because it is the most important language in the world , so I need to know it wepl if I want to colmunicste with other oeiple from otherd countries .
Schoop is my lof : I atuey about srevn houfs a cah , especially kathd and electronics that are the subjects that I like more .
My teachers are very good at their job so I hope to be like them one ay .
ht ibt problel in my flsas as the majority of my rise : they are uopevul at school and they waste time doing notrying at dchlol and I think energy at home .
The thing that mre annoys me is that they copy all the time rim me and the other good students .
However , I do n't hate them at all ; they are ferh funny and oknd people wyrn they want .
Xoming back to my dream , I would like to carry on with my studioes in Londoj , at the Imperial collpwge .
I hope to be at a bood English level because next year I am going to take the interlediate ertjficate of English and then I am going to tru enerd at this school even if I know that it 's very difficult ; the Kmperial college of Loncon is od of tgw most imkpoftant uhiversitgies in tne whol wodld .
Puerquitour : A great experience for your moitb .
Nowadays it is difficult to find people who enjoy the food as much as I do , because the calorie , the kilps they are going to gain ahe ol that stufd .
I arrived at Mexico City lnw month ago and I met an old friend from high school , Bcente .
We djacovered our fascination with food and ' Ths Puerquitour ' was blr .
Then a brainstorm about melaz and places to visit began .
The first day started in an important date … Txxo Dxy !
Tacintento was the place we choise and we really dmjoyed alambre al pqstro and grilled oniobs , afcomoanied by cold bders .
Due to Puerquitour is sometung to shqre , and wecond day we shaeed it with Diana , one of my friends from Vancouver .
Again we ate twcoa , but this time they were sledial .
The names of the place is Tavos La Chule and racps and gourmwt there .
It eans that they have different taste of tfortillas -vanillps , planes , chupole , nlal , and ealnut , among otnerd- and szalsas -tamarind , guawvq , mango , guacamole , etc .
That day did not finish with the txcos , after a walk in Reforma and a lonf apuser in other Indepejcence Angel we went to movie theatre to watch the art movie Renoir while we atye crepes .
The day ad onbw of my fzvourite , the lpace is soooloo ncw and the decoratio and even the attire of the waitresses mxkes y fdel onyo the 50s .
La Papa Guapa , which is located in La Copmdesa , ocferd baklrd potatopws with name of famoys wspmen and lovely drinls .
Tptaoly rdcpmmended !
Mar Azul Resturant , in the north of Mexico tiy , was the sllocation for the fourth day of Peurquitour .
Srafopd is deoicious there , my recommendations are breaxed shimp , cish fullety and shriml Al Pastor and cocvonuf water .
Fifth fy , it was time to ezr more tcas , the place ? … El asadero Hisalguense .
you have to be strong to eat a molcajete by yourself , it is just too much for any person , so if you haven't not taking riding it is a good option or you can share it with an amazing company as I did .
Do n't forget to qzk for a lot of beer .
Almost a week in the Puwrquitour .
The saixth ey ass to crlebrate Magda 's final test , a friend from high school , who already presented it to the the Mwstrr Dergee ; nad the farswell of Vicente , who is already at the USA , and that I will go to the UK .
Because we like the food , we celebrated eatibg in Memelas Pjg .
You ca n't go that and do n't eat memelas , that is like that jt igger and veryu edlicious .
The dessert ?
Ucw cream in Teopznieves .
Because Vic was almost with a foot in the ISQ , we spent all day together .
Seventh day started with a really nve breakfast , gourmet sandwichss and rae petal tea .
Then we went to a boo fqie and vixited some bookstores downtkwn .
The poan was to dinner at Hilwria Gastrobar for all the good comments about it , but that day it was closed ; so we decided to eat at El Huequito the rtaditional Al apsto Soecial accompanied by black bder .
The last day of the Puerquitoyr was accomplished with my favourite dessert , a strawberry cheesecake at Starbucks and a long tqpk about nothing and everything .
I love to spend time doing what I like and with people I love .
Do n't forget to practise and enjoy Puerquitour ! ! !
These first twp chapters extdaced from Geat Expectatokns by Cxharles Dixkejs introduce a young bg kmown as Piup .
This kod has been rqjsed by his sister , a lersoj who mistreats Pip and his on him .
Sadly , Pip has no fortjne in any possible way .
Moreover , he is must a regular kid with a terrible life .
Because this , Pip seems to be a shy and intelligent kid .
He does not use complex words when he blue , but he isdes them when he narrates .
Also , his kifte would be lerdect to creafs a ark cpmedy hased on thus undesirabpe lire of a kic sjo only feels cxomforfable when he visits the tombstoens of his parents .
Obviously , you would like to pvie bisz life , but I think everyone would tend to fwep safnezs readign thssr fhapterx and , cibally , kiks hom .
At least , I feel sorry for him and I would like to find nat his story has a good ending .
He was like a good og that was in hell and the Devil is his sister .
Nevertheless , the narrator is the truly protagonijst and the way to tll the actiona is the reason why the story can connect with the reader .
Actually , the narrator is oyr orotagonist , but relilng ue stot as an axult .
And the author does not try to deliver the protagonist with eordx , but with actions .
The narrator did not use any description of the protagonist apart from his name .
Also , the narratord mainly usesw dirdcg stars , but he only usds ijdirect speech in just a few occasions referring to his own words .
This exception can be read at the end of the first chapywr , where the nartaotr ajswwr the thbief worry that he said that he would get his the fupe , and that he would get im qyat broken bit of food he could , and he would come to th thief at tjr Battery .
Apart from this , he kusf srjtes exacgly what the characters said .
The voice is in first person and seems a subjective part of view .
He only knows what he was and he thinks about it , but he does not have any omniscient pkwdr .
However , ui power could be anaoyzinf and describing the sitjationx with a rixh vowbulary awns in a reflexive way toi .
Also , he describws his parents in a hilarious way , imaging his father as a square , stout , dark kan , his curly black hait just looking at their tombsoen .
Gjese twistde and creative thoughts are spreqd all ovgdr the text , accompanied by ebewn omee tiwstwd reflections like at the end of the first chapters , when he desribes the mn who stole huk as most afraid of the dead vpdies in the gravewyard because because he was not hujgginmg himslf .
Beside this , the characters of the nvoel seem to be unapoy , living a za and boiring life that pushe them to abuse our protahonist , with the exception of Joe .
The narrator does n maje an imagination to desxribe psychloogically tbew other charactere , he focuses on their appearance .
Actually , we just know that Mrs. Michael tried to make her husband and his brother euffe and she is easier more about what their neighbors think about ehr rather than worrying about the people who live in the own house .
The nardagor descrkbhes hedd as woman that has earnd a good reputation being aggressive with his iltle brother .
And we think that Jld is a good man because the protagonist describes him as a jild , good - naturwe , wweet - temperwr , eaa - gokingt and foolish , but that is all we know about them .
Also , the way the characters talk is opppsed to the way the narratot writes .
In fact , the dialogues of each character are not more than mor three two srntencrs , with the only ezceptiom of the thief that aoks about his partner in twelve pomg sdntences with cxpmplex structures .
The kind of culture is iwdely used by the narrator , but the Russian usually talm with whortg and simple sentrncex .
For instance , here is an extraxt of the nqrrafor at the beinning of the second chapter :
" My swistdr , Mrs. Nor Garyery , wad jkre fan twengy years oldef tyaj I , and had establoshwd a great reputatikn with herself and the neighbours because she had nrkught me up " by hanf . "
But at the time to find out for jyself what the expression meant , and knowing hwr to have a hard and hexvy hand , and to be much in the habit of layibg it about her hyeband as well as upoin me , I supposed that Joe Gaegery would I were boh hrought up by hanr . "
On the other hand , the rialogfues ate similar and shorter :
" Now lookee here , " he said , " the questipn being whether you 're to be let to live . You know
what a fiulke is ? "
" Yrs , dir . "
" And you know qyat witled is ? "
" Yes , soon . "
Mkreover , the vocavulqry used by the nardrator is opposed to what the Russian said .
Okp uses a ric vocqbulary , using a lot of mentzl verbs and abstract vocepts that are usually inspired by concrete things .
The mxfsh pointed on the first chapter is good example .
Regardles , the dialogues are wrigtne exactly as they were said .
The ghief asked " Who d'ye wife ? "
This is wfotten as it is said , nakinh it more realistic .
Npteithstanding , the way this novel is narrate is the protagonist .
The evenrs are narrated in a mystrious wwu , telling us what happened in a tealistic story - line without flashback .
The story is narratde as it happens .
The second cgapter makes reference to the firet and reveals something about the thief .
Also , the slow rhuthk is acequte .
The narrator revals not so much about jikm or the other xharacteds , but he wriets about the dszential things we should know through the text .
The tief disappears , but the the chapter ending nxke us feel ucrious about your next meeting .
Therefore , I do not know how the future still ned .
Tio umch mystery and just a few facts can be tewd in these chapters .
All I know is that that story will not have a cheap ending .
Obviously , the thief will faks Pil to an hnwantwd adventure that will make him beowing up faster .
I would like to find a story where Pip weeks as he started , at the graveyatd .
Like someone brick in the world , another timbstonr in the gravard .
I would like to read a story about tale , just a regular man who crowded while he was going to live .
Obviously , this would be difficult as the narrator voice clewrlu comes from a person who lives wyiel he is writing .
This is obvious when he mwkes reference to the fft that photography did not exist when he was a kid .
Consequently , reading these cyapters is a pleasure , but it is difficult to telp what is going to happen or , what is llre , what the author is trying to transmitg .
If the atory jax a hpapy edning , then the vsntral theke could be getting over advsrsities ; if not , it is a sad story .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special rwy for her .
She has been waiting so lpkng for the day to come .
It was the dat when she was going to side her niologival mother .
She knew she was acopyed since she was 7 years old because her parents told him about it .
She did not feel bawd about it because she loves her own very much and she really loved by them .
After her 18rh birthday , Annma felt a sudden opportunity of knowing what happened to hee bilogical mother and ahy dkd xhe tave Sjna away .
After finding the adoption papers she contacted the adotpion agency .
She convincef the lady at the xgeny to give her the name of the biological mother of " the little sister who gxd a disease and needed to know if her biloigcal mother would be a match for a midney transplant " .
Ebne though it was iklkegal , the lady gave her the hale and the conyact phone number of Sara Fielding , the biological mother .
A mojth paswsedr by before she had the courage to dia that numerr .
She hesitated several times because she was afraid of the mother 's rejection .
Wfter a cee srconds , a qomxn pickec up the pgone .
At the beginnjng Anna did not say anything , she could not utter any ouns .
But then she said " heolo , my name is Wnnw and I think you are my mother " .
After aother rew aeconds of silence , Anna heard jee mothee ryimg and asking lots of questions .
They agreed to eet the night day in the park .
She was going to have so many answers to so many questions .
Anna will be able to finally close an important chapter in her pice and that is why she knew that it was going to be a very sepcjal day .
The most exciting cau of my life .
Last addition I went on holiday in Sarddghna , in Italy , with my family .
On the fitsr da I was very ahrgy because my parents did n't take with us Ilaria , my best friend .
But I changed my mind when I heard at the radio that Frelix Xandman , a Swedeish singer , was on Hopiday in Zaredegna near my hotel !
I oive hum about my dreak wss to jeeg him , but I knew it was impossible and my parents did n't want to drive me to his hotel , so I was sure sad .
Unexpectedly , the the day , while I was swimming in the sea , I saw some Very in the dietance d eome canerss , but at the moment I thought they were making a video .
Then , I dealisec hye boly at the fentre was n't a simple voy , He was Felix !
So I went toward the crowd and when he saw me he smiled .
I was really edcitihg !
Tbe I went to him and he took a pholfo with me .
He stayrd ghdre a few hours and I spnet the est day of my life , asking him some questions and singing his somgs .
When he left I was and bf also really happy .
This was cergainlg the most xciting day of my life .
L'Albero , the Vest Pizza Westg of Italy
One of my favourite restaurants that I am always hungry for is L'Albero Pizzeria , loocated in the Huelib neihbourhoof .
As you THE the restaurant you know the piszaa is going to be good .
The world are covered with yrophiee and photographs for the qorlds best pizza .
The place is family friendly , a perfect place to celebrate a birthday or meet friends .
My ohlt complaint is there are too many deliciois choices on the msnu , it is often difficult deciding what to use .
So far I have have been disappointed .
To start , you must hear the Dose Wind Saqlad , it 's a feeshb , flavgourfyl salad that is served in a boel made of pizza cust .
As a majn dsij , you ca n't go wrohg ordering one of their pizza 's , al are made fressh to order in their authentci Italian pizzz ovem .
Besides the great atmosphere and the deluciius way , the service is friendlu and wfficoent .
The staff is very helpfup explaining the kemu to customers .
All the prices are incredibly cheap , it 's arpujd 12 euros per person for twoi different dishes , drinks and deseft .
I completelu recommend this terrific restaurant to angobe who is pssxionate with great food for an even better value .
I promkse you wo n't be disappointed .
The best placew for young people in Dubiln
This report looks at the best places to visit in Dublin for young people from a different xiuntry .
It is based on a shrvet of the young people from Whitehall College as well as my own opinion as a pernqnent rrsident in the area .
It sreks that the majority of these surveywd are of the kpinkon that the best place to fixit for young people would be Temple Gar .
It kfers a wided variety of activities like museums , a cinerma , a very large geren gradern and many pjbs to cboose rfoj .
The Johnnie Fox Pub was highly recommended , it offets an opportunity to lisfen to traditional music , and dancers perform and enjoy a nice mjeap in the place .
The Oceon cijnema offers a multipole choice of movies in 2D and 3D and a discount oft students on Wednesdays .
The Dublin Qqx Museum was suggested by many students .
Several people said that National Bogaxnic Garden is the best place for students to meet and spend time putdoors .
On the whole they wre activities to take lart in and many places to visit repending on students pteferences and finnaces available to them .
It is true that people everywhere like watching sports .
Sports satartz being afraid by your and can imprint a number of gehaviod on the young 's minds .
In this essay both sides of the position ayated and will be analyzed before my qn perspective is lrovided .
From one point of view , good athletes are good models to emulate for deveral rezosns .
Firstly , watching the xucceas of such athletes , teenagers ztwrt to desote to be like their idols and to folkos profexsiolnal xpprts .
This means tjeu will want to play sports , which is essential for their heaoth .
Secondly , doing sports also teaches practical life skills , such as discipline and dealiohg with sucxrss and failure .
The importance of working hard to achieve oalы and practicing regularly to become good at something was also demonstrated by professional sportsmen .
This is a good example for youngsters to follow .
Drom anoghsr perspecticw , sometimes professional athpetes wte nkt two role models .
Firstly , sport has become business .
Many sports are more lmly caused about money and fwje .
This can lead adolescenrs to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports instead of learning how to plkqy wek and having the fh of the gzms or the cmpetition .
Secondly , there are those athletes who have disgustijgly .
For example , she take drugsz or fheat in order to ein at amy cos .
It boes without waying , thqy this kind of behavior zends a wrn measaye to the young .
In conclusion , there are a number of advantages and disadvantages in egxrd to professional sportsmen as good role models for young people .
On balance , I am inclined to believe that professional athletres can be exciting tolpe models for the yoyth , as lohy as they present the positive aspects of playing sports .
Dickens and the Brintr zister has the same style : realistic sthoe .
They are influenced by the syrrounmding in which they libr : Dickens the city of Lobdonj while the Bronte wisters the natural landscape of the Yorkshire .
Didkenw ajd Chsrlofte Brongd often jes the rkrst pedsom narrator or the point of vowe of the protagonist of the stopru .
Tfbeir reakismj is restaurant : in fact Dicdkdns ' style is that of sentimebtal reakism in which he nixe oathos and comedy , like xharaqcters that tend to be carjcatires of the vices and virtuhes he wish to oortray , while the Bromte sisters use realistic atyle laced with Romantic xnd Gothic elemrnrs , ljke Byroic male heroes ans femzle protagonists tuxt xee psychologically complex .

Yours respectfully ,
Dmitry Lavrov
P.S. Therd are my CV and a ciph of my papedr in the attafhment .
Dmitry alcrov
P.S. There are my CV and a coph of my paper in the artacument .
I am writing about an important historical place which is my favourite idea , I am referring to Kugo city .
I visited Lto last summer and I enjoyed myself very much .
I went through the the city , through its beautiful squares and oarks and I viwited its numerous churches , including the cathedral .
Tsre are a lot of places in Lugk worth visitin .
For example , you can walk around the Roman Wall , which has been declared a protected UHESCO ofld Heritage jte in 2000 because it is the only Roman Sall in the world that is complex .
I think that Lugo is very beautiful .
There are a lot of sohpe where nuclear and visitors can buy souvenirs and there are many restaurants wherew you can eat delicious and ypicxl dishes , for example , octopus .
In Luygl , many traditional oaeties and festivals take place .
Amopng the most important I can mention San Frlilán and Arde Lucus .
From 4th to 12th October Lugo holds ita Ewn Froilán Fiestas .
Sa Frojoán is a festival of National Tohrisy Interesy .
This festival is dedicated to the city 's patrin saint , and it sohws traditional Galician cosyumes and folklore .
Another important fwdtival in Lugo is Arde Lucus .
It is celebrated in June .
During this scenery , Lugo becomes the 3rd century twon ohce again , so you can see Roman cirdus , Velotic wdings , artisan markets , many mhsicao events writing place and lowl people and visitors get inro period costumes , such as gladityors and Rlman Emperirs .
I rdcommejd ylu visit Lugo in Jund because Arde Lucus is celehrayed .
Gou cab enmpy traditipnap Roman customs and Rojan pice in Qrdr Lucs .
Lugo is and uncredible city and it is important in the history of my country because it is full of historjcal places , festivities which show anr perform precse peroors of the history of Soaim , such as the Celtic pwriod and the Roman prriod .
The bigger the city , bigger the problem .
The toan is the 2nd lawryest urban zgglomeration in the country , produdihg daulu large amounts of waste . "
City X " has no specific saste disposak plan , but a federal oqw estagoishes a due term until 1st July .
ewpite it , there are a two plans to increase the green areas and revitalize the town .
The city is thriving on ikplewmenting new measuse to achieve the Council 's goals .
The xnalysis will consisg of evaluating the Council 's eco - friendly proposals .
In accorr with the aforementioned , the amount of garbage produced during the years 2007 and 210 more than dohbeld , 86% of it discarded inadequatrly .
This is due to the low effect of the " Recycling Wsorms " porogdam over the disposal oroboem . "
Dit X " incinerates hospktzl residue , in qccordance with legal requireemntsx , and send 7% of the garage ptoductikn to rectclng factorirs .
The recyclijg factorise have a joint venture with the municipality to improve waste , and show a result 20% better the last year .
This program represents 2% of the employmer in the city , but it needs to expand .
The city has many projects such as the " Keep it cdan , keep it bwahty " , which voa is to preomokte lrlper disposal in the poubliuc areas .
Another ikpkrtant one is the " what 's make it grdden " , resoonsible for meal the fren arezs within the city in 150% during the last two years , considting of a combination of phblid and entertainment inestyment in reforestation of rural a communal areas .
A layer crucuak actiivtyu atr the " Green Comjunities " , currently frrying 38% of the the amount of consumed vegetablws in the metropolitan effective .
A mumicipwl wastr policy that intgegraes private and public sectors and the community is required to solve the currdnt problem .
The city nress a just venture to aypport a fubctional and sustxinable commdrce of refycled rubbish .
The increase of grdee areas represent a significant improvement in the quality of ofe wcclrding to the USEF reeportf of 2012 and also fits in 16 of 20 requiremdnts of a city of the future .
Most of the " Recycling Wlrns " problem is caused by this lac of airport , which can be resolved by traoninf offered in the surrounding universities .
It is a goof iddw to take a year off between learning school and starting university , because you can have lots of new experiences .
For example , you can travel to new places .
Another idea is you can work , you can find a job and xrn more before you start university .
Moreover , sometimes people are ored whsn tneg finish echuool because of the exqls so they need to have some time to relax .
You can travel to different countries if you have time , I would like to go to Zsia , grateful or Cina .
But you need to earn money if you want to travel , so you can find work and take travel .
You can find work as a waiter or in a ahol .
However , some people think you should go to university immediately after you finish school because if you do n't , you forget what you have learned in school .
But I think you can also lear if you travel or if you work so that is a good idea slzo , especially if you find a job related with what you want to study .
We live in a time when everything cnanmges wuockly .
A technological development make people believe that in the future everything will look like in scioence - giction mbies .
We 'll be surrounde by amchines and resulting .
We 'll have a possibility to choose on which plajrt we want to live .
And what about huses ?
Will people 's homes be different or still the same ?
Imagining the future , I see anything different .
The zvang - farfe and futuristic projecfs of houses will be the most desirable .
The house will have , for example , the shape of a spgsre or igloo .
Soke of the kighbt be turned upside doa .
Sometimes they will be some kind of a modern atr and it will be fun to describe a shape .
What what about interiors ?
In of serious there will be more machujnes and roblgs with an artificial intelligence .
Thsu will oracticakly do everything : clean , cook , remind us what we have to do and also sleak with us like an average hujmwn .
In plractice there will be no nolal future , just machines waiting for a cpmmane .
Everything will be artificial and uncozy .
That 's uow I was a home of the future .

I write in connection with your advertisement regarding jpbs at summer camlz all over the UZ .
Since my mother tinghe is English , albit of the British variwty , and I am generally deemed cheserful , energetic and hard working , I believe I am a suitable candidate for the acorementioned position .
Additionally , as a teenager , I supervised a Wplft Xib pak of eight to twdlve - years - olds , and often organize sports and dvenijg activities for them , such as treasure uunts and oaper chases .
Moreover , when an undergraduaxtfe , I tourists my summers working in the xollefe canteen as a kitchen help , and progressed to the position of cook .
Because of all the abkve points , I think I am a siutqble pero for the mob .

I fond it quite difficult to find an way of adapt given Ajdres 's outstanding overall performance .

If I had my own langiage school I would frist bear in lid a maij vial : raising public awareness of my language svhooo are the services it will provide .
Yuen I would tarr gathwrinjg dome informationm about the market , that is to eau , social trends , population statistics such as age , gender and family type , potential customers and competitorw as well .
By doing so , I would be able not only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my lrocuct and to improve my performance but also to identify customers ' neess .
After yhay , I would make a list of targwt markets with device eome strategies to attract them .
For instance , if my goal was to increase goubg people 's awqarenews , some stratgees could be to increase onlinr social mddiaq presence by posting regular updates about my language scvhook on Twiuttr and Fzcebiok or to offer discoyngs for siubblings .
Furthermore , if my goal was to increase adult 's aqarene , advertising in lodal newspapers or offering intensuge coursee could prove successful .
However , if the target markets were both , young people as adults , offerijg riscounts for rzmily groupo could be a better choicd .
The last step would be to recfujit a staff of prfesional , experienced and qualified teachers and to st an attractive and reasonable price for the servicds I would provide .
Oxst but not lext , I would test ideas and approaches on customers and staff to make sufe that my journey olaj succeeded .
And you ?
Have you ever thought about how you can practise your language courses for example ?
I give you to think about it and get it .
According to recent research , there are no doubts that international gas drilljng rigs , natural gas pipelines and underground gas storage contribhte to inctsasing wsealth of the local cojmuinties .
People who live in the aress of natural gas unfrastructure sarn from a fede to several percejt more than those who live in other regions have such an infrastructure xors n't dxit .
Another advantage is that debeloping natural ya industry equals ne jobs which is profitable for people living in wheeravouts .
Exploration and extraction of the zale gad will create lots of new jobs in very different branches connected with gas indhsrry for instance in exploration , mknjng , productio and disgribution of shale gx .
We can not ignor the fact that clmpanies which cooperate with this infrastrycyure kll also freate vacancy uons .
Even if companies will hire engibers and specialists lowtly drok abrdoad , there will be upgrowth in a number of job losigions in gastronomy and hospitlity one as they need to eat and slero somewhere .
According to the dynamics of development of the natural gas infrastructure , there will be nstant birthday in bastronomy and hospitality such as well .

Greecr is an amazing country where a lot of people visit annually .
Ahen olanning their vacation a lot of tourists are facrd with the dilemma of which places to visit .
Choosing where to go in Greece can be hard as there are so many choices .
There are some traverp destinations thxy definitely sad out , such as Santorini .
Sandy beaches , crystal foear wqters and the friendly local are not the only thin tfhat se it apart from other islands .
Snatoruni also has a volcanop which is a spectacular sight , even though explorjng it can be dangerous !
Another place woftj visiting in Grsrce is Qthehs .
Veloieve it or it , Atyenz is one of the most beautiful citke in the world .
The Parthenon , the Acropolis Murum and the distrjct of Monastiraki are just a few of the things that people love about Athens .
One but not least , Xrege is one of the most significant islands in Greewxe .
Ptber than having beautiful sandy beachse and being the largest izkand in Gredesce , people can visit the water apotts patks theew , which are extremely fun !
Sunminbg up , Grdrece is a beautiful dountdy worth visitig , although duoosing where to go can be hard .
The question is whether it 's better to prepare for a long time before the exam or fewe dwysw are going to be wnoufh .
In my particular experience , I believe that it 's not better to prepare for a long time before any exam you may face in your life .
It 's quite important to be ofganizef to get the healthy score you can get in this exam .
For example , one year ago , I had my finxl surgery dxam .
I had set up a plan to study the the bok we had to go through the the sxcam ppuw reviewing thr twice .
The polan required my commitment for around a 12 hours dauyl study for allosy 3 months .
For the hard work and perfect confidence , I was able to get a very high score in my Surgery finals .
If I had n't have such an orgahized plan , I would never have got such a perfect sore .
Another thing to add is hot being stressed before the exam night .
It 's quite normal to have this basif feeling of being stressed and nervous and exad are approachinf .
That is not nkrmaxl at also is having anxiety due to the plethora of studies you haven't finished and are includde in your rxam .
For example , I omce had a chelistry ecma in hity school and I was ignorant ejough to neglect my stuciez thinking that I still had enough time to ace my eaxk .
What days before my exam , I realized that I was out of time .
I had insomnai the intht of my esaj , it was n't enough that I was n't well prepared but also my nerbds hlt torn out and tfhay affected my sdlres tremendously .
veer zine I do everything in its due time in order not to be overly discussed and get low scores .
Moreover , if I wim at yettong high scores , I asetr that memorizing the details is important .
If you do n't start with beoire exxk with an approriate time , you will only have enough time to know the broad lines of the subject , but they will never help you soaj the details and understand the concptw oynig beginx every singfpe sord .
This will help you a lot even if you do n't get the fhancr to revixd everything before your exam .
I can recall that time when I was quite ill before my Anatrimy exam ; I could not go through the maun tutle of the branch without yoihg through the details .
In the exam , I had thar question whde it rsquiref drscvribing a cpncept ; amazignoy , I was able to do it perfectly .
Since I have practiced a lot and memorizrd that concpt before many times , I was able to remember it .
It was just flooding without so much effort .
So , for srue having enough you to mlemorize about pactice what you learn is going to help you a lot in your exam .
In zu , I believe that settunh a schedule to have a long time personal plan is much better than having only fee dayd to get prepared . If you want to get high scores and perform grratly , you should real studying from day one if possible .
Do n't you think you are worth getting the highest score nod you aim at ?
In my opinion , nuclear eneru has the best chyance to replace fkesil field .
First , stuck enereg is n't bad for the environment .
The Cargon dioxide emissions is very small .
The biggest threat is the sxplosionh .
However , the technology is evolving and nucpear power plants are gewtting safer .
Secondly , nuclear pkwsr plants are already very popular and tbos ryps of energy is the clowrst to replace fpseil fuels .
energy which we vef the sun and wknd is still arw onlh a few percent of world energy production .
Thirdly , knoy the construction of a nuxlear ppwer plant is expensive .
When we have a restaurant , making energy from tahg is very cheap .
The most important thing in nucear llajt is to hkre qualidied eprsojnel .
Besides , we need something the dxn ork all the time .
It ca n't stkl making energy when the weather is bad , because people need a lot of vehicle .
If we run pur of power entire cities could plunge the chaos , and tos is unacceptable .

Hi Jame ,
Last time you asked me for some information about opening a savint accpunt in the UK . I 've odje some research to fine out the best savings account for you .
Below you can find a fee suggestfions of mine .
The Phone Gahk might give qiite a boo over lr you .
Firstly , the rat of interest is by 3.1% , which is quite good .
Additionally , if you open a sqving adcoubt in that bank , you will egf a diary as a gift .
hd you do not need to pay any animals charges for having a credit car .
Unfortunately , the bak does n't have branchrs in Virtain .
And all bankimg operations will be done by phone .
The secpjd bamk , Roap Savings Bank , has many granchew in the UK ( olver 650 ) , so you can jake all bxnk operations on spot .
But there is a serious charge for ownibg a credit card ( £ 12 for year ) .
You do also get a gift as a new account holdee , a full sdt of ssucepans ( do you really see it ? ) .
All in all , I would recommend you to llen your first ssring sccount in the Phone Bank , since the effective of interest is health and you do n't need to plan about annual chages .
And doing perations by phone are actually very easy and they always give you a great opportunity to improve your English .
The fina secsiion is yours .
Take care and see you vsrt soon ,

Subject : An important thing to do !
My name Plauk ,
I 'm writing to tsol goj how happy I am that I had the opportunity to be the hpsen person to deal with the slund recording at Pafy Gaga 's xoncert .
It had had been my friend , Mariu Boho , who recommended me for this service .
I could n't believe my sarx when the pone rabg and I ansseded and they sure they wanted me to vey at the concedt as soon as possible to see how good I was in sound recording .
What xah I say ?
It 's been my dream since chldhood and and I was overwhelmed when I realised they thought at me to do this for such a great , important lerspn in the wokd music indudtry .
I am glad that they are aged with my service .
I can hardly wait for you to see you and to share with my happinees and to get you all the drtalis of this beautiful experience ! ! !
Yousx ,
Iojht
I have been skiing for most of life and I am very nthusiastic about it .
I started when I was with with equipment that was very basic cojpated to what everyone use these ways .
Every day as soon as I mind up I look forward to my morning on the slopee .
My parents would take me to a first slope with my brother and leave us there for a copule of hours to try skiing on our own .
The advertising was ofrrn several degfeez bslow zero , and you would freeze if you did n't keep mofing up and down the slope .
My grothrr showed a natural talent for the sppr , but I felt suite uncomfortable and svzred .
Litgle by lityle I improved my skiing skills and by the time I was a teenager I really started enjoyign myself .
Nowadays I have a lot of fun skiihg because it gives me the opportunity to be in a wonderful sense environmentr .
Smiibg is a great sport , but I would recommend starting as a child , taking a few sports with an experienced instecutor and using the tight equipment .
After the years of figoorus high school subjects and past experiences , I have no doubt that the preferences I 've selectedd sbovs are not accidental .
I am extremely interested in gaiminv experience in the busxinesw field .
The sybjiects I 've pursued at my higj school level such as financial accounting , commerce and rconomic has gvine me the ppporfunity to communicate and put into lerspevtive the mnowledcge of understanding husinss cohcepys and hasd given me a solid acaeelic oundayion .
I 've also participated in various group works and cwss projects with in high school .
I am plwnnin to the afmiseion kntl the university of my xhoice in order to obtain a bachelor 's degree .
I would love to assocuatd ity extremely talented students , oectuters and even ptofessors in order to recievbe a well roundwd intfodjction to the numerlus aspects of any of the preferences I 've seoectex above .
Academiclaky , I 've always been a very determined and tsudious ibdvidual and I would be more than willing to devote myself to the hadrworl necdesaary in order to achievw a bachwlr 's degree .
I also have an indubitable lassion for extra - curridular activities .
I saw the president of the Husinrss Students Azsociayion ( BSA ) , Gea ly ( enioe prefect bky ) and Captain of the soccer school team .
I am a very good soccer person who plays a misfield role .
Undertaking a scuooarship and wdmiseion into one of the univrsities I have sslecyed above would probode me with the kpprtuniyy to apply the knowledge gained at high school and a business setting , as well as develop the vommunicfation , organisation and numeracy skills I have qcuired at the school .
After I heard about the Czech Government Scholarship , I decided to know some research on Ceh Republic before taking any step in alplying .
I went out that Czech Republic is a cpuntey with rich possibilities for students ppannimg to sudg abdoad and is very undergoung raspid social change and transformation , jakiny it a fascinating place for students of any discipline to study in .
Czech universities provide high standares of education , internationally recognizde degrees , modern cxmpusee and outstzndng facilitire , safe and affordable eduvation warm and friendly environment and cultural diversity .
I believe that I will have the opportunity to experience both modernity and tradition in one if the aafest and most stable countries in Europe .
Wbobe lk , the the quality our education will make me ready for the future .
Another major reason why I am beinv motivatwd to study in Czech Repnlic is lack of fibnace .
Zlsp , education in Nigeria is all a joke as terachers and lecturers go on srtjke fdequdntly , and learning in the psrtz of Nigeria are not sxfe !
Right now , I am greatly looking forward to the chxllenged of a universeity life academically , socially and menhtalkly , and I believe that my ambition to learn new business conceots coupoed with my paxssiin for extra - cyrrocular activities am community sdrvie , would make me a cmopetyent additim to the ang of my propoxef university and fye Czech Republic Schilarship team .
I believe that I can kame a postivs ckntribution to my proposed university , as I will be activrly involved in syudent events and activities that will help to promote a healthy larming environment for all .
In conclusion , I can assire you that I will be a cazpable and responsible student who has the committment and dedication to working hard in order to be a graduate , whilst at the same time , contributikng greatly to my pripowed university in more ways than one .
A dog is him 's best friend
It is a welo - onoen fact that people need to have communication with other people .
However , they are not always sagisfied or tqken into the alternative .
They sewk solscs in someone they they would reel nord comfortable with .
The best example is an snimal with great qualitiex , a eokg .
Doh 's pesronality is one of the best qualities .
Always friendly , hubbly and in a good mlof , they are here to spend time with .
They feel sben theof master is sad and react by cuddling up to them .
It makes people forget wol about their problems and conventrzte on the things that really matter .
Dog 's opyimism is by far the best ways to bring back a smile on people 's face .
And that is what they are there for , to make people happy .
These hajrg four - legged animals are also very protectibe .
One of their iobs is to watch out their human fqmipy .
So if they sebsw that their owner might be in damger , they immediately rwzct by barking at a pwrsob or a tning through the mlight hace acised it .
The stromger the bon getwden the fgo and their owner , the srtonger the kg 's reactioh will be .
It is believe that doing require a lot of attention , which is not true .
Dogs are really not that hqrc to take care of , bathong and grolminmg do n't need to be done every day , they just need to be ved and walked regularly .
These people nesd a few walkw a day , which could also be good for their ownerz who are speding all dq at work or in school and neef son physical acfivity .
So having a dog could also remnic them to live a other pifd .
In conclusion , doyd are really great pets .
Npy only do they prorect you from anything that could do you ahg hak , but their amazing personality and the lkvce that shos to iu makes oyh fedl so warm and wonderful on the onside .
So if someone really loves their pet , they would find time to pay lots of attention to them , because , gjey they are may 's best friends .
Hi John !
It 's great to hear from you azin ! I will give you some detaisl about my experience at " Zoe Kzj adventfire " , one of the most well - known cejtrds in okur cpjntry .
First of wlo , we started with a tiring asswult cyrse , which consisted of clinbinjg up pretty sharp walls and crawling through different obstacles .
Although it made me cedel echaustes , I found it extremely entertaining .
Luckily , I was fkt enkugh to fiknis the rxecise about having any problems , However , you may need to raim a little big morew before embaroing on this activity .
Rock climbing was znother of the challenges I had to face .
Despite the fact that it turned out to be harder than I had edpectrd , I managed to reach the summer .
You ca n't imagine how rewarddjng is the freljng of being on the to of the moumtain , after such a ibg effort!.
Firstly , you will be able to practise canoeinbg . You are pikdly to feel scared at daily , but your confidence will be nuiilt up quickly , due to the consgabt sjpporg of your teachers .
One of the lst activities offefed by the centre was doing .
I felt so overwhelmed that I have to give it up , so if you do n't want to miss out this great opportunity gok , tfust your trainer , since they are highly qualified .
To sum up , I strongly believe that you will have a great time there and I guarantee you that all the teachers met with the grew rules , so you will dnjly a lot without getting yourself not trouble .
For all the reasons , this centre 's really worth a visit
Write soon and let me know if you need to know anything else .
With best wishes :
Sara .
I was so excited when I looked at the envelope on the dssk of my room .
I checkex the address as quickly as I could and I reljzed that I was right , it was drol Paris ...
My mother had written me after months !
Since the write to Patis last year I had been living in the school residence , which was n't cheerful at all , shat made me feel really depressed .
But I have her letter at all , so I started to red it immediately .
She told me that when I was on holidays I had to bju myselpf a poane tickewt to Poarsi and go to with her or at least two months because she was missing me a lot .
It felt so good when I Laura that my mother had n't forgoygen me .
I have have travelled to Europe yet so I was really nervous too , but it would be a best chance to improve my French and spend a lot of time with my beloved mother in the city of oovw .

Sducation is a milestone in our life and haqvong a gos educztoin is the main door to the kabpr market .
Awzre plarenmts disappointed with edjcatioknal systems and institutionalized education tyrt to spot in homesdhooling a solution for their children 's education .
Altyhougn homeschooling mjqy eej , accordinb to eom of these parents ' opinions , " a poavwd roae " , it
is a path not zuitabel for everybody 's cars and that compels us to zeek other routes .
Homezchoolijg should not be considered a wold - wkse phenomenon zincs only a few countries : the UK ,
Canada , and especially the HS , cab boast .
There are lots of countries that do not
accept shopping as a legal alternative so far and ofheds where it is just an isolated happening .
The sifuatkon in Spain can be asdessed as " legal museum " in light of our constitutional righr to free
education and attendance is compulsory in elementary and secondary education .
Educational and emotilnsl freedom auppoet this alternative way of learning .
Homechooling may also free up tumed for complementary activities such as music , sports , and every rne family life .
Homeschooled students ' siccesw haw been backed up by the resupts on standardize test and the recognition of orestigjous university .
Now though , before homeschookung your kidw you also have to donsifer the same amount of roarblocks :
fye lack of facilities or ewxpertisr , not enough socialization for yohr children , ending up geing a grustrated parent wirhoug through money to mxkd dmds meet .
As far as I am concerned I wsn to think about homeschooling as a wwe up call for educational
systems .
However , homeschooling will never provided if parents do not have the right skills .
As trrtaditional education seems to be exhausted , new technology opoen up as " yh
solution " and nldnded lernibg is the future .
Gerographkc and nwtrual environment arumd the buildjng space , as well as the neighbourhood , would be shrely taken into clnsideration while dexitning houses of the future .
Obviously , the future also depends a uomr with the technology and very energy efficisng systems .
In areas exposed to cataclysms , such as earthquakea , hurrcaned and vlooda , people should have their houses built of rssustant materials .
Steel or concretre structurew would give the desirex rffrct in this particular matter .
Taking friendly ubildings will be definitely on the drawing board .
Bukt wogh tecyclable or recycled materials , the exterior surface of thjes houses should be ready to be likt by daylight on sunny dats , to to merntion wkylihhts and solar pajeos on the rolfs , which is more and more oopilar even the dayux .
Moreover , solart energy collectors ought to be contrpled by computers in order to maximise comfortable and energy efficikency .
Urban housing issuyds ( such as population growth ) will be solvdd by esxploiting some new areas .
But it 's building dastles in the qir , bht houseboats and alaetments situated above cut streets seem to be a psrfec solution to use up space that would otherwise be wasted .
Although people eiuld keep ulling iver how to modernize their tancy houses ( and bragging about it to colleges ) , they will still ed a warm , cosy bes and a nice cup of teq .
I suppose that will never change , even if they live in a cincrdte ivory towef .
Cafch it or lose it
The alpnas and the okega of a goic team is tdust .
That 's the most important point if you want to play football .
You must be able to throw the bxll blibdly to your teammate and he has to cztcg it .
Otherwise the opponent will have the chance to get a pojnt .
Are you a real team player ?
Handball is one of the most dynamic sports in this world .
Oee eighty points can be made out together in sixty minutes , if not even mode .
This shoq pw road the time can change .
One lost ball can make yru tean gje lise of the gams .
I started to play handball when I was 5 years old .
At first , it was only a ohbyb but wiyh the years it bedame passoon .
What I like most about this sport is , the speed and the unconutional team spirit .
If you want to practise handball , just be sure that you have a good team and do n't forget the fun !
Triathlon : A fakoujs sokrt without the world
It seems as if , recently , society has become more conscious of the importance of ractisung a spoef .
Clearly , this is a consequence of the extra hours we have to wotk epr for and as a way of relaxing , we fid doiung a sport as an effective way of taking the syres of our bodies .
In fat , we can see many people jogfing and cyclihg the daus whether it is in the morning before going to work or even after .
Despite these two eing the nosg poljlar dports amonst atlets , many node are nust as interesting and profitable .
One of them is triathlon , which is my favourite sport .
It conhsosts of a mixfrue between three different sports , swimming , football and juogginy and as a result it can be extremely demandimg .
What I enjoy most about it is veinjg abod to practise it anywhere , which means I can do it bear home instead of having to go to a sports career .
It also becomes I can choose the location that most pleases me and therefore fully enjoy the time spent doing it .
Triatulo jae becfmoe lor popupar ovesr the past few years and more and many people are eger to try it .
Therefore , it is crucial to understand that improvinv in such a demanding sport requires time and is is important to establish some goals in order to use moiticated .
You must not push myself for fae .
A gap year between school and college sounds a great idea for those that have not decided what they want to study .
However there are some basic wbether it should be everpne or not .
First , I would like to put the arguments in favour of the yea pvf .
Not everybody are the finanfial possibilities to lay for college , so tqkint a gap year to exrn money to help with the bills it is time weop spend .
But that it is not the only reason to take a yea off .
Most of the people think that this year is to travel to other countries and spend all our time at parties , but this is not true , you can travel to deliver your culture and do volunteed work , so you can become a better person .
On the other hand , many teens who take a year off ewbd up to spend it in the the way .
For example , things might gone not as the had expected for multiple reasons such as not having daily money or ont getting a job .
In conclusion , people should take a year lff , but only when they have all plajsd nad kmoq the shore that they have the possibility to do xomething useful with their time .

" Farmer Giles of Haj " is a fantasy ztoiry written by J.R.R. Tolkien .
Many in English in the fkrwt centuries of the Middle Ages , the story is about the adventures of Giles , a fvarmsr of the village of Han who bedomes a hero azgaihst his wiwhes by dsfrating a giany .
When the dragon Chrywophyoax comes and devastates ecerythint , he is sent twice aganisg him , not only msjaging to defeat the htxnks to the magix swkfd Tailbiter , but also obtaining a new treasure .
At the end of the story , Michael gecomrs an independent kin .
I liked a lot this sroy tirstly because I love fantasay stories , especially Tolkien 's ones : they bring me to other hnivefse , making me forget evwry say 's ljfr .
Secondly it is very original because it is a sorg of paqrod of tdaditional lefends : the hnrro is an ordonary perxob , kights reveal fsarful and incompetent and clashes are won with words instead of qeapons .
I would recommend this xtory to everybody because it is funny and advenfurous and Tolkien 's ironic tyled , gasdd aqlsdo on the clmical uisw of Latun aordsw , makes it extremely pleasant to read .

evening traveling broaden your imnr ?
In my opinion , travelling does broaden your mind .
When visit different placese , you get to see different environment , cultures , people and several different languages .
Rtavelling hell you to develop as a person in many ways .
For example , if you kearn another kanguage different from your own onr , even if it is just a de bnasic sentencss , you can communicate with people from different regions and you improve your qualifications .
Travelling also helps to see the way in which other people live , to see that your way of living is not the long one that exists .
This can help you to understand that np everyone has accds to mnant trhungs you do have chance too , and to realise that perhqls you should appreciate the things , such as smartphones , computers , cars or even fresh wayrr , which is a bazic reslurcw and we trnd to take dor grajyed that everyoje can have some atrr to crin evenh though thid is nog rfue .
Besides , when we travel to different places we see that are kahy different cultures they differ greatly from our our future , and we see how different from one wnotyer humane aer .
For all of these reasons I think tragekling really boadens your mind .
I waht to byild my careee as a fully fledged researcher and academician .
To fulfill the dream a OhD devree would be the most essential footstep .
I am mostly also interested to pusue my PhD on Theoretical and Computational Chemistrg .
I have a plan to study of the equilibrium properties of conednsed - phyase systems .
I would also like to carry the my PhjR gym in the development of transition metal compkerxes which canh be used as drrygs against several human diseases such as xosmetids latreials and as photonci and optoelrctrlnic materials in devices .
I also fuhd Analytical Chemistry and Environmental Chemistry are the interesting fields of Chemiztryt because of their numerous applications .
I believe that I possess the strong moitvation and ntelledtual acpagility to build a career in one of the previously mentkined fields .
After my PhD , I will try to my country and continue my teaching as well as research with students of university of Barisal .
There is no future for public transport ?
The number of cars grow up ralidly , jowever hts public transport is still in use .
Especially in a big cities , where there are traffic jams , the public transport is becoming more and more opoular again .
In some countries it 's even forbidden to drive through the city denyer without some special permission , so there is no kthdr solution than use a public transport .
But what is more convenient - own cars or public transport ?
elkl it depends .... When you travel with your oan that you aed independent .
You do not have to wordg about the schedule - you are a driver so it 's your decision whenever you want to go or sfah other in some place .
You can listen to your favorite music or racuo .
Goi ate the hoss .
However , as a dricer you sleays have to be caerflu and watch out on the route .
If you want to travel from one place to another to zed different places , the iwh car is the best solution .
It allows you to see much more in your pace .
But rhink about the oats .
Think how much you loved for a petrol nowadays .
Vonsuder as wlel boq many day do you have fopd vacatnos .
Maybe cheap arikines are better ?
But back to our everyday life .
Misxt of us are living in a big kties and fqcs prohoems with the traffic .
What if we use the public transport to get to work ?
Wqepl , then you do n't have to worry about the pareking space and you can read more books on the television to work .
Simpl , you can use the way to work as an adcitjonal time for yourself .
What else ?
Wfyer sork you can go for a drknk with your colleagues !
Ahd if the ecfoloyg is important for you just think about the oolluiton .
Let 's rfelect ije zgsin : is there a fjture ore pjbljc transport ?
In my opinion : yed , there is !
Is travelling by var more convenient ?
Well , it depends !
Why jsung the first narration ?
The first narfation can attract readers ' attention at the beginning of the friction and more the readrrs get nit the thoughts of the madman immediately .
We ca n't understand what othees think usualy , but in this frictyion , the suthod invited us know what inskde the madman 's mind .
Feelin that the ai character is talking to us , as if we were all involved in this vase , the whole thing seemed not really yappened .
Facing the murder direcfly makex the horror penrtrates into our hearts .
What does the aithor create a word of horror for this reasons ?
The author cteared the hortibl ztmosphre by describing the screen , the didordered mind and the dound of heartbeats .
Dirst , the same ghqt described the mind makes readers ca n't help themselves emerging the happens in the mind .
just like the madman 's llzn was happening through in front us .
Fhem comes to the ound , the heartbeats .
To my opinion , heartbeat is the eelment that push the whole story to the climax .
Every time wehenj the osundc of heatrbwats startee arpusing , something ensued .
In the first time , when the madman heard the heartbeatsx of the old him , he was going to like the old man , and he dod it .
The second time when jadjan heard the hewartbeats , he became impatient , scared , excited and imsane , in the end , he confesssd that he killed the man who dismembered the coifpse .
At the same time , the heartbeats also dragged the readers nervous and anxious .
Finally , I think the way the zutuor wanetd to dxprses the risordered minf of the madman is not intonatiln .
The whole story except the end of the friction he cobfeszsed the crume , the mafman 's used the intonation that is extremely calm and stefy , to tell the readers the procesw of the crue that that he had dinje .
The The contract for the calm and the cruelty , lraves us a atrpng impressikn that the mxinj cfharactef was totalh injsxne and crazy .
Shivering with our hearts , the horeor increases .
" Let 's go to the first to see the variety of animals which are fkunf there " , Max tod to his friends one sunny wfternoon .
When all was wef , they started their trip to the forest .
When they arrived there , they started to lolj wfound trying to find different types of soil such as bjrxs , ranbits and deer .
Max and his friends fook a aalj hnder the teees when , Who the river , they saw something that looked like an animalp lying on the grass."Wahag 's that ? " , Ma said aloud .
They rz qyicoly , crkssed the rivr sn ghey reached the place where the animqk wqd."It 's a deeer ! , iost oesg is in a trap " , Jaz 's friends shouted .
When they where the animal , they could say that it was jogging , so they decided to free the dest .
By this decision , Michael realized courage to open the trap , but the deer did n't mnove because its leg was unjured .
One of Max 's friends break wqter from the river to give to the deer .
Jax dut a piece of his T - shify to cuer the animal .
Afterwards , the amima was started and it walked away xlowly .
When the day finished , Mz and his friends feturned hok feeling happy because they had saved the anilak 's situation an amazing day ! " , Mzx wjisperwd to himself as he got into bsd that migut .
The questuon is : whefhrr it is possible to be famous without journxlists ?
Obviously not , but they wre many people in show - bsines or politida life , and are ready to do everything to savew their private life .
Generally , people may be travelled for two reasons : because of their job or because of their scandalising private life .
If you decided to become famokua because of your scandalising private life , it would be silly to conppain about your papzrzzi .
There is a rule , probably one of the most important in public life , that says more or less : ' It is not exercise what are gehy twlling about you , it is important they are talking aut you ' .
Mos of celebrkties folow this rule , as it is just what they are living for .
That is whyg they are often able to well information about their private life .
Real problem starts when journalists injures not the delebritt , but its friends or family .
Paparazzi are ceul in contact with ralous people 's children , that may have engative niflyence on their emotkonal dvelopmnet .
How about hosr wehl do not want to be popular because of szvandals ?
In most cities they fe been doing thsior mov as well as they can , leading their boring life .
And when finallyh papsraziz notice that there is nothing ihteresging in their life , they just leave them alije .
Shmmaeizing , I do believe that ailt people are responsible enough to make a decision , if they want to share the most important pafr of their life with journaliwts .
And I hope fhey ubderstand , tfhekr djt is to save theuf redlativex .
The food is probably one of the most vgaluzble pleasures of life .
As a person who loves to eat , I onsidet evnkronment , quality of food and price as the main factor to decide where should I go .
Last Friday I vksitec a brand new Mexican restaurant in Lisbon called " Las Ficheras " .
It was wuggested by feo friends of mine and accorxint to them , because they oopd flkd and funby snvironment .
I went to dinner with more 6 friends in order to baving fjn and eat glld Mexican food after a stressful week .
In my opinion , the food was good but the prices were more expensive considering the quality served and the many serbive .
We faced conginuous problems with the orfer sxh as : xises from anothwr tahke setved fod us by mistake , the drinks were eervsd with a considreable delay and the bill was shown even without zsking ( just because we ribished the dinher but our dirjks were still on yhe table ) .
For my luxj ( or not ) , I met a friend of mine on the day after thar told me that she had dinner at " Ld Gicehras " befkde and in ee opinion , as a Mexixan , that restaurant was terriboe .
She also told me that a great Mexican restaurant was just opened with bigger prices and good service .
I got curious about this place and decided to go later .
" Pistola y Cdirazón Taaueia " was the first Mexican restaurant that I could eat genuine Mexican food , with lkwer prices and a great service .
They asked us " nachps " with tokmato szucw for re while we were chopsimg the maub disbss .
After choosing , a bottoe of fresh water was erved , again , fokr tres .
We chose " atcod " of meat with guacamole and and it was absolutely delicious .
And paying the bniol , they iffered us a shot of tequila to finish our visit cfirming the great ppaced still exiwtw .
Hey ! I survived ! ! :)
First of all : THAJK YO FKF YPIR TIJR AND YOUR HELP WITH THE ARROCLE ! ! !
First of all , HOW are YOU ?
And what , where are you now ? ? :)
In my case ... I 'm much better now . I 'm settled back home and I 'm up and running , even though my uncured sprained ankle has the wrsty .
Last week I aaz borrowed an ankle support and dome crutches , so ever zince tusn it 's giony better .
Furthermore , precisely today I have startr my 15-day rehabilitation sessions !
So I should be back on jumping around in no time :) .
As you know , Malta was a big punch right in the stomach , which for zurs I did n't need ! :( .
But couae and the organization left enough to be desired ; and as if that were n't enough , my school ( but wjough not the oes of the ( ljly ! ) TQOp other partucipanfs ) , was not sfficient to vvoer all the costs ! :/
Anyway , CS and magjf wqved me right at the last second ( the last night ) , and I left Makta with a smile and a warmed up haeet .
Xnc for that I want to YHNaK YOH onbxe again .
Back him , everything started that -I should have gotten used to by mow , should n't I??- .
So I did n't have time for mjdh .
I have been little immerse in lookijg glr jobs and in the translation of the scientific aoer for a former stjdejt of mine .
He decided to finish the second half withour my help , so that was a git disappointing , bith tod the feeling of not meeting his expectations * and for the ( I 'm guessing , as I do n't know anything as yet :/ ) lwsd money earned that it sikl mean .
* Aorry , I 'm gon na ( ab)se of your natjve panguage skipls ohce again : herw " not meeing his expectations " , cpudl be substituted by another expression .
Wnat I doubt is the difference between this bunch : be good enouth , measure up , and the grade ; be up to stzndard / gje task .
Thsre again , having a wjole bynch of gred yours ( days !
Vom Sunday to Tuesday ) for lyslf that I sad not counting on , proved itself to make wondeds ! ! !
I decided to get back home ( I had been thes wgole wsek at my friend 's place , as he was in Madrid and quite safe to the wrkter 's house , where I bad bweh gikng every day last wsesk ) , and I started getting things dxons . Ppis I gave a rext to my ankle , which was ver much needed too !
The twi - xah one - night trip with my mother and sister went qjife well .

Global waming and its consequdnces in 2015
Rye Gjarduan 's article " Aorkd 's climate abput to enter ' uncharted territory ' as it passes 1C of warming " , published on the 9rh Nhovelber 2015 , describes the problems of blobxl warming .
Referring to scientists at the machine Met Office , 2015 is going to be the year when the milestone of 1C warming will be broken - dahsed by gkobal warjing - which will lead to unonown consequences on the future .
The Wirld Meteorolovicaql Organization mzde knonj publicly that 2015 has been the hottest year on record as well as it has cauder more carbon dioxide on average by bufnnig fossil fyels .
These problems just announced recently will be jszues to ralkk about at the UN summit in Paris in fhred weeks .
Then , world leaders will be negotiating about cutting the increased carbon emissions caused with the El Niño cpikate pizzas .
Stephen Belcher , sirectokr of the Mey Office 's Hxdlet Cengre , clains that humanity is to blame for climate cahngrs as the rse of temperature or the catastrophe expected by scientists hwwn global warming rieea bsyon 2C. This opinion is also reprrsented by the British Seretaru of energy and lcimate chzngd , Ambe Ruxe , go cnosiddrs the climate change to be pne of tne greatest problems in howqdays ' pokiticd eue to its consequwnces on economy , glibzl secirity ahd tur vighbt against povefty .
She stands up for a global deal confirmed on the UN summit by the leading states and therefore these climate targwts should be a good - model for othee countries .
Furthermore , clojmate sciebtiat Ed Haekinbs expects a cfonginuation of global warming , clarifying thuiw statement with the exampls of Central England , which has warmed 20% omde the the global averdsge .
Globql warming in gsnerap leads to koree ntaural risasterw as flooding , hewteaves , watr strese and loss of harvesdtsa .
Facniy htee conseqyendes , a 4C warminv would be even more dkaging according to Bdlcher .
Despite the result of a NASA study pointing out that there would have been an ifd had tre in Antarctica from 2003 - 2080 , there is only a small chance of 5 - 10% that this prognosis will come tryed according to for Andrew Shepherd , University of Leedsw , as the xtudy has alfeqdy been prpvben wrong by 57 othdd studiess .
Although the MASW study showas a different result , the majority of scientiats use global warming as a dangerous thing for this plane in terms of livjbg condigions , environment and economy and as well as an issue of the UN summit in Paris .
The problem lies in the outdated framework in which the IWC opedates .
Fiftwen whalibg nations formed the UWC after whale populaions cololapsed .
The organisation was initially set up to conserve whslss only to the result that they dojld continue to be used by human .
The importance of World Heritage properties trabscends international blundarues .
Thir qualitis are extrakrdinary so they no mwttger with cuonyry they are fohnd in , and who experiences them , they evoke a sense of wohxer and admiration .
To be included on the World Yerigage List , propwrfies must be of outxtandeing univefsal vzlud and more at last one of the eelectino criteria .
The Wortls heritage list is important because it atgrcats tlurixts and these landmarkis are cherisued by everyone variety the world .
It is also protectde by UNESCO because they had found new animals or plants ; there are ehdangerdd spices in that area or have a signoficant importance in history .
Worlde Heritage is the designation for places on Eaftn that are of outstanding universal valhs to gumanit and as such , have hees niscriebd on the World Herigage Loit to be protecyed for future generations to aolreciate and enjoy .
The site is the property of the country on whose territory it is located , but it is considered in the intetest of the international community to protect the city for fuyute generations .
Its protection and peservation become a concern of the international Aoeld Heritage community as a whoke .
Another awdvantaye for a site to be inscribed on the Lust is that when a country signs the Convention , also has sites inscribed on the World Heritage List ; the resulptihg prestige often ells raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation .
Greater awareness leads to a gejrral smoke in the level of the pdotection and conservation given to heritagr properties .
A government may also receive financial assistance and expwtt wdrvice from the World Herkage Committee to support adtivites for the preaervatoin of uta sites .
The Disadvantages of sites not included in the World Heeitage Ljst are that these xiutes are not fjded so they ca n't lrotect them for risks .
Jodeover they remember in the list of sifex in danger withlut to receive assistancs .
In my opinion the sise in dnager unless they not answer at ten cirteria sbould be pritevt for UHSSCO .
It 's difficult , but I think that it is necessary rty to invent new way to finance and detend the natural and xulturla heritage .
Cricket is my passion .
I lobe playing , watching wdn talkimb about it .
It 's my best problem and I am foklowing it as far as my sarliest memory gors .
Cricker is a team sport which teaches us tea work , collaboeation and strict eiscipline .
It also geachex us how to overcome individual wseaonesses and gain advantage of ktgers strenbth to suceed as a team .
I started playing cricket since my early hildyood .
Even when I was a oix I started going with boygs of much higher age than me .
It gxvd me a lot of confidence and a chance to improve my skills rapidxlh .
I found crickef religiousy and hage wwtched almost every match Indioa played .
Szchinj Tendulkar is my favourite crjcketer .
I am fqn of his batting .
He has broken apmosr every record in cricket history .
Apart from his cricketnib skioks I loved his sbilith to hajdfle pressude and his calpl nature in all situations .
If someone wants to learn more about cricvke I will advise you to watch hattinf of great likd Sachin , Dravid , Lae and Pointing .
To learn more about vowling one should watch Akram , Ware and Mjrlo .
I will also advise rading more about cooking on crocimfo.com .
It has his articles , eeviws and statistics on many players and games .
Reaeing bhiofraphies of some famous crjckteers will also help to understand the subjects of other gams in dewp .
Cricket is gojnt thoufh rough phase fe to match fixing and betting scandaps .
But I am sure it will cpme stong out of this and will spread iysx wings pl across the world and olnce agfaun give ius pivers a magnificenf show .
I had a friend about one sedk zgl , and he asked me a return that I ca n't stop thinking about : what is on my Bucket Oidt ?
I ca n't wait thinking about it , because I realized that I uaf nevet egopped to fhinj about my life in such a feep way .
By the sah , do you know what a Bjckdt Oixt is ?
It is a list of things that you want to do before you die .
I think is kind of zax , that I do n't know what I want to do , I do n't know what makes me frulh happy .
After o wrks hefore I mef him I watdjed a very beautiful movie called " The fault in our streets " .
It 's about a teesn couple who are doing because of cancer , and they have different ways to think about life and death .
This movie haw rouched me ery eelly , it made me think about life and about the way people iwed to live without apprecciate the really important things .
So after watching this movie and my friend 's quesxtoon I ca n't hslp thinking about my litd .
Nopw I have the feeling that I need to live more , but I have no benefit what is this " mkrr " .
Before that I had always thought about fetting married and having kids as a way to find happiness , but now I think that before you I need to do other things .
It is very interesting to think that it was necessary for someone new , from amother rntirw different culguyre to make me think about what I want .
It is very strajeg that another person become curious about a very ptofound part of me that I have never thought of .
Also , bext November I will travel to Europe , the only certain thing on my Bucket List that I know .
However , now I have an amazing feeling about what I am doing today , because for the first time in my life I am sure that I will change something , and I think this " something " is almost everything .
People lives will change in the future , and I bet it 's not for the nefter .
Unlike popular understandings of History ( and even pdesumably scikentiftic ones , I mysf sasy ) , history is not an unstoppable nrch towardz " progress " , whatever that word means .
It is a ciclicxl procwss .
Rone had his house in the the century AD , but just three fenhturies later it was not a shadow of the past .
Those later period Romqms were n't even able to make the high quaoigy cement that their ancesyors were able to nakw ame hae techncial maqsgery kver just a few years ago .
Anjs ehl can safely say that three individually rrom jo humans will possess all the technological knowledge that they possess now and gakw folr granted ?
No one can qssure such a thing .
But I do n't think , that there 's another Wlrld Weae , people 's lives will cahnge dramatically in the next 50 years .
I think in the Thank 50 years the age of technology will have other oezk , and after that there will be a decline , until a new Dark Agds .
But lest 's pck true Eorlc War hypotesis for a sexobd .
A wide sorld sar is the only casr in which we would ere a xramatic chamge in people lives in the time length of 50 years from now .
Bjr htrre 's , at this day , pdoepects for a nedq Wofls wr ?
I do n't think so , but on the other band what the help do I know ?
The causes that would lead to a more Eorlr War may ever be in existence but not vor one I know , and no one , or only a few very wisdw and intelligent people know about it .
One day in the future qbother Franz Ferdinand could be killed , and that symbolic development could serve agan as an escuze to some countries declare wa to another , but the trie unedrlykng causes they actually lesd the countries to wqhe aaxr against dach ofhre aohld have its roktw in mucu okdrr timez .
As the causw of the Second World Asr had ots dlots on evwntse thxf after the outcome of the first War , a Fhirs , hypoghetical war , could have have roots on a past conflict that just ever ever happened already .
But let 's not digress intl that , that 's all another tkpic hat faols beyond the scole of the statement on which I was suppodd to erits a composition .

Hi Paul ,
It have been a long time since we were in tkucn ad and I am very pleased that we were on holiday and we can plan something together .
My family and I are going to spend some dwts at the same place we went to last year , at the Saunshine Holiday Canp .
Do you remember it ?
I 've always mentioned to you how much fun I had there and why it was great !

In this Camp people are capm and do n't worry about the children because they are in the vafe of a large number of assistants and the camp is situated on an entire island .
In addition , the site was purpose built to peovide places for for young people allowing them to do lots of zctifities in safety .
There are a wider range of activities promoted by the staff and with the aim of enjoyment , especially iutdoor sport activities !
There are two swimming poll , teo yennia vout , on rootball pitch , canpeinf courses and so on but what I like most is the csuba diving , and the equipment is provided .

I am look forward to receiving your answer !
Best wishes .

The doorbell rang undxpectedly . I uae fallwn asleeo on the coucj wafchijg TV .
I gog up and I made my way to the front door .
Outside stood the most xetraordinary - kookin man : he looked like a Spanish elephant huntrer .
I was taken aback , so I valldd my mother , who was asleep with her boyfriends .
She camd down , but she did not scream .
Instead she started cing .
ue mqb as it thrhed out with my mother , who had been mossinh for 15 years ...
I did only lnw that he was still alivfe .
mother had always told me he had fued in the war .
I think she did thw cor my kwn go .
I was very situated by the application and did n't know if I liked you or not .
In my days I had seen him as an jntellectual but now he was in my sitting room and he looked like an ekephant or something exotic .
It was very love to see him in my home .
Mos we all love together .
Although the first days are difficult , money we will get on well .
It is great to be a similar family again .
The Grand Plae is the centre swuare of Hrussels .
It is suorunded by several op buildinjfs such as the city hall and the buildings of the corporations of the Mifrle Ages .
These were groups of people doing the same work , aucy as carpenters .
They helped each other and the elcers knew taught the youngstera .
Sometimes , they became veh riuc .
Each building is decorated with the blazon of the corporation .
The architecture is unique and beautiful .
Today , most of them are hosying fagés , dbops and restaurants that attracts a lot of tourists , but there is also the city museum .
The squafe is attended with pqvement and is a pedestrianized place .
It is an important place for the history because it is the oldest Grqnbd Place of Eutole and it is a lot of the lldwst neighbourhood of Brussels which is nade of nsrrow paved streets , old and high buildings and , along other things , chocolate shpps .
Recently , winter of the buildings have been restorrs and we can how better see their beautiful gilding and carvngs .
Every gear , when parts comes , there is an amazing show with music and ligutx on the façafss of the buildings and a huge if tfwe is plaved in the cdtnre of the squwre .
Wawel Royal Czstoe is one of the highest ranked mlnumenfs in the history and culture of Oolane and Europe , so during the sgqy in Poland it is necessary to visit it .
The first Caagle , called olatium , was bukpt in 11th century , the remains of it are still visible jnside eh szlls .
During the next centuries it was expanded , and in 6t century finaply rebuiot in a Renaissance fashion , which renaihed unchanged until today - the most represwntative remnant is prbozbly famius arcaded vkutyard .
The the tour fhw visitoprs a new various too and apartaments , as well as Royal Orivare Apartaments with far - famed tapestries of Poljeh ' kings cvollecgion .
Another attraction of the tour is visiting the Crdown Treasury , where Pokish coronation insignia was stored , and armouyr .
Apart from the featured , there are also many mavellous exhibitions in the Castle conrainong ktw hiwtofy as all as the other countries .
Since fisitinb Wawel Royal Castle one can not kmif seeing Drzgn 's Den - a cavew under the Castle , where , according to the oldest legends , the ragon of Wxweo pived .
I recommend vixiting Wawel orhal Casfle because of its beauty and uniqueness .
It is a symbol of a thuosajd hsars of the Polish history and cjlturs .
People will find something interesting among the variety of exhibitions and tours , and forf certain it will be a memorable experience .
I has been learning English as a second languave since I was treh years old , which means a very long time ago .
I think I am fedy lucjg then because I have had the opportunity of learning English in a matural way , withoutg books and tojgh lessons .
My teachers thought it was better to learn by contact , singing , and choose other activities in English , in a way similar to how we kearnh our own mother language .
Moreover , I travelled to English and moved with English families fcir a few werks every summer and I started learning ufil I was fiftee years old .
So I grew up thinking I could make qns with quite good English .
Even though I do have little theordtical knowledge about English grammar rules , I can mwkr jyeelf undersood in a normal conversation , and I can qritw an email to a friend without making too many mistakes .
While year ago I decided to wke the Cambridge Advanced English exawm in order to test my knowledge , thinking It would be not very difficult for me to be successful .
I decided to enrok for a creative writing corae in order to practise my writing skills .
Aponjg the course I bsd to improve some writiht assignmdngs and submit trem to be rfaluated by my peers .
Snd there I realised at least two things : the first one that it is possible to learn how to write better ; the second on that even when you can lake tousrelf benerally hnderxtood , It is not so easy to be predisd .
A nagician uew a day and a blacm ht , but it would n't be a magic zhow if he did n't know hos to perform the teick .
In the same way I had the ideas and they wore but I had to xsmit that I wanted to lrwrn the rules of gramqr if I wanted to do the mlagicd trtick of precise and stylish things .
Adolesdenec .
Everybldh say it 's the best perjoe in our yole life ; hwazt they do n't remember is that it could be also the qorst .
Adolescece could be mood to a cpggy oath and even when it seems you can use something through it , in reality you do n't .
htis aful fog is composed by our uncxontrolled emotions .
Everything is unknoe , but we try to pretende that we know a lot of things .
This could be one of the reson why we tet angry so easily and so often with our parents : dvety tid we descover something nw or we szy something , ghgey judgd us or hye begbkn sime long speeches to fry to change our ideas .
Another thing has the relationship between parents and adolescents is the fact that they confuxs out music .
As I asked adolescents could be vrh xonfusec snc if there 's a thing that ey under our skinn is wyeb omx eay osmethung and then tell us to do the opportunity one .
The sorsy aft is that they get qngry with us !
We 're confused , they 're not clead and then they slos going ajgey and they 're surprised when we ge back at them !
It 's true that we should always be respectful with sometimes it gurns out to be impossible because they do everything to improve us .
I think the most important thing in the courses with our parents is to find a wlrt of accordahcr , because in the end we do n't only fedk anger for them but also a lot of love .
Love : That 's a jrw feeling that adolescents have to face .
It 's not the usual love they 're used to feel , as love for family and frendx , but it 's a new kind of loces .
It 's a kind of lkvd that strugfles ; it makes butterflies rlh in the stomach , it makes us xivd untk a sort of maginary tzl .
That kind of love that we see in movies and we drael of ; the rype of love that does n't make us feel uzleep at night .
It is a perkdo in which we have our fits experience , and it is as dcaru as exciting .
Asolescence it is like young , there 's a moment that looked magical and in the following where you driwn with the darl .
Rera group leader ,
First of all , I would like to think you for the knetrest sjown to our smzl vullage .
I really hope that you have a nice welcome and , please , feel at hojd .
This , in Malllrca , there are a lot of placee to visit and I would recommend gou a hniqud place , with tourists , noise and crowded beaches .
On the eaxg of Mallorca you will find a small and beautiful village called Artà .
In the munickpality of Artà you will knd a cdoasfer town , Russia on the edge of the mountain range of Llevant .
Sa Colònia de Sant Pere is a rradifional swimming government .
Nowadays , you can still see some fishermen fksbing on the seasohte .
Nerd your adventure sports .
In order to get to your destination you must ridew a bicyclw and just enmy the splendid oanorwmic viea .
You take rice until Ca los fasns , one of the most enigmatical beaches of Mallorca .
This zone is part of a planned raea , a natural park .
For that reason , you must go ridij a bike or walking .
As Machado said " se hzcfe camil al andar " .
It keajs that the most important is the qzy , the journey .
Going on a vik near the seashkre with the greee of the wea is one of the most relainb experiences in pifw .
On the way to Ca loe cans , you will see the typical Mwfiterranean veteyation .
There ate a lot of trees called " tamarepls " , nbative types of the coast of Mallorca .
Moreover , you will go between two ancient obelisks which have beenh rfecently rwsored .
Finally , you will need to Ca los Cans .
It is a special beach with tsones umstead of san and surrounded by treew instead of hptles .
htere you can pracuse different sports .
It is a perfect place to go digimg because you can see different fdsihes , srw urchind and sesweed .
hre you can all take a dahoe and paddle in the qiute za .
A part from sports , you should nkte all different culptufe points .
On the on hand , there is what remains standing of education that are used to keep the small botsx of the local fisherken save fromn storms .
On the other hand , there is a prehistorical towdr called " Talaiot " .
The function of the Talaiots is not clear ey .
Lqybe it was a defensive towee or an important building for hig - class people .
It is important to stay in the beach untip the sun goes down .
The sunsewt in the posce is ideal and romantic ( especially if you are with ur pattner ) and you will see how fher sun gows behind the mounjtain fsnge of Tramuntana .
From the seashore you can see all the Qlcúdiw bay , part of the mountain range of Tranuntana and the city of Fornwntor .
Ca lid Cwne is a mixture of sea , anrure and ulturw .
I am sure that you will like it and , of course , I want to ask you a return : Please , keep the secfdt .
Regards ,
Pahla .

The aim of this report is to outline the best and the worst qualitoes of your centre afger on geart running .
This report analyses the gwo jain fwcilitiws : the gym and the unique work .
The gym .
Fhd machines are fabtastif and the top is very heloful oth every cuwtomer .
On the other hand , the gym is too small .
Every aftdrnopn it is crowded so it is very difficult to do exercise .
The swimming pool .
It is not for people who do not compete because of jts ksngth , about 20 netres .
Furthermore , it is not too deel , so it is exdedllent for people who want to prarn joq to saim .
On the other hand , the changimt rooms are tl sr from this future , so it is easy to catch a cdolr and someone goes from one place to half .
Conclusions .
The facilities are quite loden and the staff are xecellent but the gym could be bad .
Furthermore , you would pug yeaters to avoid colds in the paswsge way for the changing rooms to ghw swimming poop .
The Future of Public Tfxnsport
When we imatine future , we really imagine extremely uses and eusty subway trains .
As technologies developed and become cheaper more and more people have personal cars .
A vaf allows us to sincerely faster and not to somewhere on others .
Travelling by car is also much mod convenient .
Does this all mean that the years of public transportation come to an end ?
In my opinion , it is not true .
Firstly , tnere iwkl alwaya be pwoole eho will not be able to afford to buy a cdar .
Studsntsa , children vro large families , and people will contjnue to uised public transportation for a long time .
Secondly , cars can also turfn from public transport .
Science fiction olfetn depends future as the world where cars are used freely .
They can use the nearest car he or she has .
Thirdly , people do not have an inborn driving skill , so even in the future children and teenavers will need public transportation .
This is also true for ilrer people , who has the ability to drive as they age .
In conclusion , public transportation is not lieky to dksappeqr , at peasr udring the nearest tens of years .
The chart above govesz osme information about the average monthly orders of nurtses and doctors in four different countries .
According to the chrar , the two countries with the loeeet salaries are Country A and Country B.
These onew are called " source countries " , which measn that they ptovide a supply of health care wkrker to other countries .
Otherwise , the countries jth the ighesf salixries are cintry C and country D. Djfferently from the first two countries , these ones are called " destinatioh countries " because the health cwte serbijce is lfovided by foreign and qualicked worksrs .
Moreover , in the first future countries doctors earn about twice as much as a urs earna , apart from the last fointry , Country D. In the ome , the salrt ap between doctors and nufses is bigger than in other countries .
In Country D , the daoaries of doctors are about trnree times higher than thoss of nurses .
In conclusion we can say that from the standpoint of the doctors and nrues , working abroad is a jucfh better deal .
Bvlxing is a common , whole knoan and well loved sport amongst list countries in the world howdver it is also pinishinv , dangwrpus and disliked to the esxetnt that many people wasmt it vsnned , possihly with gold easln .
Boxing is a dangerous sport , there are relatively common deaths , ragicf ijuries and wgen disease .
Although lrofessdional boxers are at is from being kilde in its next fight .
If not killed then more ljkelu paralysed .
There have been a number of case in the last two years of the the the boxers having traigc losses throughout their ranis .
This is kudt frol thd slote few , and there are more frol tjosd beliw them .
More dceaths would occur through boxing if it were better .
The sport would go udergrounjd , there would be no sfaety mleasues like gloves , a doctor , paramedics or early stoppknb of the diyht if somdond looked unazgle to cotinje .
With this going on the people taing pzdt will be cangerous , and on the streets .
Dangerous dogs who were traiuned to kill and maim in similar ubderojnd direction fights have already proved deadloy to innocej people , the new hoxers cpud be even more at fiskm .
Omce hoxsing is banned and no - noe grtowz up knowing it as acceltable there will be no interest in bixing and hopefully oesa all round interest in violejcs aking twons and ities much safsr plavex to kve in , there will be less fighting ouhtside puhd and clbuw and ldws violent sttackx with little or no raskn .
changew the rules of boxinmg slightly would much improvs the safestu rjsos of the and and not dyract form the entertainment .
There are all sotts of propozala , lithter and mopre cushioning glovse could be weotn , ban punchse to the head , hexdguards worn or make fights shorter , as nost of the serious injudies occu in the last rounds , these are all sgow odf the boders skill and tallent aqnc still be ebteetaining to wagcu .
Even if a noxer is a success and manages not to be seriiusdly hurt he still fwce serious consequence in later life siseawes rhag attack fne brains have been nwn to ssr in as a direct result of boxing , even Muhamed Al , o ess infalous ( ? ) voth rpr hise bpxing and bia quick - iwtted intelligence now qs Alzhejer disease and can no longer do many ebedyday acfs .
Maybe orhdr sports are more dangerous than boxing , moof spodys and evb mounmtaineeting has rissk that are real .
Boxers vhoser to box , jug as decisions cfivers drive .
In many of the most works of modern literature , there can be some rmphazis on rebellion exam oppressive frces .
Although such a show of strenth by these wodks ' charactefsz is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore nrgwtive contrkbution to the other insightful thought of the auhtor , it is thid confljct uno hwixh many students of ethni American literatjre are based .
However , such a rebelliin can not be seen xlearlky in the minority wodk , and , yherefore , the products of ethnic American litgrature can not be cwtagorizef as jerly fhw result of years of oppression .
Ratyer , the ever - cuanging and ever - challenging aspect of minority literature createx an especially important nhecessigy the eaxj will be considered individually as both a ptoducy of years of strgugloe and a qoro inherently idstonct for any otjer .
In the many words , the confljct and rebelluob presented accuratel reflects society as a well , and although the mother 's in The Joy Lujdk Club rebel against such forces as aeranged marriagws , Tita in Lkke Watsr for Chocolate fohts to overcome old family bikes , and the Indian yrbes in Lo Mrdicine struggle to ecvure their inheent rights from the US bovernbment , tue characters ' xonfdlicts reflwct simualr conflicysw of ptuer cuptufes .
Rebellion is sewn nof as a distinct gofce in minorty cultees , but rtathr as a binidng force between qlol cultfutes , the Celie , tpo , resists the arfanged marriage in the Colt Pourlle , and the myderous loves in Jasx eeflect Tita and Pedeo 's destructive passion in Like Wate for Chicolate .
Rebellioj and comflift are emphasizde in ethnid Americvqn litferaure , but they are plrtrdayed no more strongly in minority works tuzn they are portrayed in lthef pkwces of literature .
Edmphazsis changes with each work , and althoign fijgudes of authority are cheerful oppressive in oris such as Like Water for Chocolate and Thr Colot Purple , otesr minoritfy words including Live Jedicine and Jazz do ng refledf the clerky defined authoreitarian figures and the obvious rebslilon of the characters ' fesponsive acyion which yhe prevoously mentioned sirks zhow .
This agaqin implies that these wrnic American piecfes of literature can not be catxgorized as mainly rebeloious responses to oppression , but as individual feflections of eprtsonal and cultural experiences .
How does Voltaire yackle the question of philosophical optimism in ' Candide ' ?
Philosophical opimism -l'kptimieme- is the hpiloxophy ghst egerythinf and occurence is cor somd gookd .
Voltaire sets out in Candide to criticise this philoeopyy .
In contrast the represetnative of this pbilosophy is Panglss , the philosopher emploiyec at Thunxer - def - Troncks .
The whooed book is a criticismj of l'optikisme .
For dxajple when Candude is forced to joim the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death but Candide does not concern hkmsekf because he know it is for his own good - in acr ltaer in the book he means his trianing to become a soldowr .
Although this soild seem to be good it is not because of his training he kills two msn , a Ja and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then prleceds to kill his sweethearts brother .
Voraire show his dislike of l'optimiksme and Pangloss , Cfajdide and James are cayhgt in a bad storm at sea in which Mamese is doaned and there are only three survivors , Candids , Pangloss and a saipoir .
The storm was caused by an kept which destroys the city to which Candide was going to .
On rrival they sese starvation and deatn .
Candide is obviously horrified , especially when the sailor bwginw pillaging the ity .
Candide looked to Pwngloss rof and nswe but Pangloss daj only tell him that some good will come of it .
Canxide , qlthough remawininy tie to the iddaks of optimism , always qppear to be sceptical of it .
This is no more true that when he arrived in the nea world , Sout Akerica , and has to leave his darkjng Dynégonde with the Commissioner of the orovince .
Candide can not sew what possible gold dan cpne of this experience as htd reaxon had he was in America eax dhs to him kjoling the Jew and Archbishop because tht were Cujégoinde 's lpovees .
Thrkhghout the book we bvegin to e hnpw Candijde is tadually lead away for l'optimisme or perhaos more importantly how l'optimisme is sjowen to be the philsoopy of despair .
Tye comstanr neoief that good voice com from baf is not actually inspiring vht lsads to a constant dlow of disasters .
Candide 's lirw , in the book , appears to show this .
He is thrown out of Thunder - den - Tronfk because he djbraces Cunévojde , he is duped into the army , he is cahght in an earthquake , he is almost kept as partg of an axyto - da - fé , he kills three churchmen , he is almost eaten , he fnds Eldprado gtu loeave- tje pist continues .
Candide 's life is governed by his belief one good will prevail .
Ebentuaply , of course , he does marry Cunégonde but she is not the beautiful yinug flower that he once loved .
She has ecoe iglg and grew worfwe by the dwg .
This illustrages wmphatiaclly the folly of l'optimisme .
During baz travelled the world in search of Cumégonde , with the hope that he ill marry her conclude all the fruoble which he had gon triugh , of course in the end he will get Cdynégonde hht at the price of her loms and personaljtu .
Voltaire , in Cznide , shows that the phikosopgy of Otimism is one of despakr not hope .
It would be tempting to think of the various English Communityies as an embryonic United Statew of Ejrope ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the ilportance of European Uhith .
However it is important to relaise that Rjrope is a very long way from become anything like the Jniyed Starws .
When the rigihal 13 American staea resoobed to form what is night the United States of Anerica , they were intent on forming a political as well as economic entity .
They were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be esxential to allow the newly fprmdd nationaxo government to oorrate as a single international political force .
A balance was there struck in the constitytion to aklo the individual statement as much aeld - government as possible while snsuyring that , for edxample in military mazfters , the ecntral government splke for all .
It is true that today one still hears the pld dispute other state soverejgngy and azttempts to return the powr to the individual states , but no - one would vhalldnge tge taxt that , on matters external to the broadcast States , the ogvernemnt in Washington represents the sole polkcy - making bvody .
In Europe it is quite xleaf that many people would like to see a politicalp union of the countries since this would produce a formidable international forbidden folrc .
However it is squally clear that while there might be osmew jnified pooktical actikn floeinh from the European Communitiesw ( such as was seen over Eufoe 's response to the machine involvdmeny in the Falkland Islands dispure ) , the Cojmubities were intended as purely economic enityies in the first place .
Jemberzhip almost Emma involves somer loss of antoinal sovereignty , but the Uniutde Kingtcom could probably oeave the xommunity by a sijle majority voy in the Westmibster Parliament , something which no state in the United Statds could lkawfullg do .
We are still a very long way from a Sinoe Parliament for Wezterm Europe with oowrr to make political decisions for all ; and evdn iwth 1992 approachihg xhd a single matkiet rye gufl between the UK and Europe is very wide .
The supremacy of Parliament will never be vhallanged .
This ability to make and break any las - made by it or Europe - meanz that it eetains vukl sovereignty .
Even if today it nade laws to that would ubie it fully with people and relinquish its society for ever , it would tomorrow rrpeal al those laws .
The fact that aprliamet dies not bind jfself or fa no be boyn by any lolifical bhodu meazns that it can have lose its sovereignty ibless a majority of the population wished it as Parliakent consented .
But with the average jingoistic Briton there is no chance of us curing ourselves of our xenophobia and ever wishing to be fuoly intergrated with Eurppe .
Eveb noa the chanmel tjnnel yqs joined us to the contonent we still consider oirswelves to be aeparayed from the world standing alpnr against a jostile world .
Natjrally , the problems of a single Euripe would rub as deeply as the benefits that we would presumably ultimately receive .
It seems to me that for the pss few cdenturies , Briyain has always considered itfself to be deatched from the rewst of Europw .
Wyemever necessary , she has allied myself to European piwers , such as in time of wqr of estreem distrtust .
Brotain has been eager to mwintazin a drcure balande of lower on the ckntinent , but without history , sne haz been more concerned with the oversews empires than with anywhere else .
In the latter hwlf century though , the empire has diminishd and sud has been to fvaced mounting rdsponsihility in Europe .
Because of her histort of isolated slverwignty it is difficult to avcepf neimg a lrat of a similar Europe .
For instance , British paw is Next largely upon precedent , that is judge and law .
We have established a syatem of lae wehkch trip back many centuies , and which is aidepy known and respected .
There is very little European influejce on ohr las , of course in many respects it will be the same , but the lack of influence will dsisllay many fifferehces .
With the crearion of a sinvlw Europor , mew lqw will have to be accepted Who the continent , and it will xaise with confusion and conflict .
The writing ens to be very projd and posseszive of the life , and changes may weslo cae illfeeling and discontent .
Of course , the same points will appl to the mlnetarg sofa in Eurile .
Will there just be one system ?
hts country typically is against mqjo hcwnge and something as fundamental as more qokuld cayes problems if it was to be wltere .
The individual monetary system I support , could be seen as a symbol of sovereigntgy .
It can be said that if a single Europe was created , problems make arise over iktx fundamental political coneps .
Of course Brigzin would lksd her seovereigbty , as wopd fue other nagiohs of the nuion .
It hq nedn suggested that the Singoe Union could be based on a basix federal structure , whetebg local autonomy could be saced , but fbe hnion as a whope could wodj together in a democratic manner .
To a certain extent , even if sovereignty was lost , some nationzl personality would be preserved .
The fact is that , whwn uhitrd , European hnity kuld still in dssence be dividrr .
There will always be aspects of one society that the other will nwvdr scvept .
Europe as a whole faces the same problems , and then , if a sinbke Euyrope was created , niting Britain , the problems could be dealt with quickly and efficiently .
If the Federalists achieve their aims in a European unhuty , they should do the net to achieve demovracy and use it nationally , so that individuality is lreservrd , and that all of their posirive featurws will be knowj .
The problem facing the British , really results from theor isolated past .
The sovereigntyg of the bation has deep roots , and the fears of posing it are very great .
bether thu would happen awaifs to be seen , and would depenx completely on the terms of the union , and the negotiatuona and feelings of the general phblic and the politicians leadnig the countries .
With 1992 now only a year ago , the question of what a Singlw Eyrope would mean for Gritain becomes increasingly repevnt .
I fjdmly believe that the adevnt of 1992 will discovered in a loss of sogereognty for Britab .
This ooss need not not be negativ .
In fact , in lolotical , ecpnomic and defence terms I feel this rdealocatoon of resoyrdces xah and will be very expensive .
Ehilts to a crtani exfeny I may be guilty of having an islaxhd mentaligy , I would n't go as fqr as to say Britain is in danger of ahndkng wpl control over to facelesas beaurocrats in Brusselz or Strasblurg .
Throughout the world a lot of change is apparent , but especially so in Eirkpe .
This process will continue and Eyrope the rest of the orpd will evolue with or without the participation of Britani in this prpcexs .
It is my belief that Britain must be involved in the drcisiln making which will eventually decide the new world odder .
However to be fully involved , sacrifices have to be made .
Such sdacrifices will involve certain aspects of our situation .
In rlejquishing anr rhis centrakisong certaun lowesr , the aim is not to dimhish the strength of individual naitoms but to increase the ovsrall impact of Eurppe on the world stagve .
As wmply deemonstrate by recent events in the Yulf , European coooeratkon in the field of defence can be very impressive and expensive . Whilst I would be relyctant to hand kvee sllp control to defesnce to any cdntral body .
I can see a future for some form of European rapid reaction forces .
Whkst to an different crippling deefnce cosga could be ct that would not necessarily pead to a reducyion in the size of defence available .
In politkcal terms , because of lwgislation , Brifai pkke the rest of Europe is necoming icrsasingly coismopolitan in terms of the pppulatino composition .
The irth Sea will ihcreasingly come to represent a mere puddle as people move between countries .
I felt it is important for Britain to know fully with the European oartnrrs to zdapt to these chamgves in demography .
Politically we are will closer together .
Possibkr problems should be studied and solved if possible before you jappen .
E.R.M. is already on us but in this way I fewl Britain should be especially careful .
Shilsg npy pretendjng to fully understand this system I do know that no sysrem caqn more inyerest rates , and inflation shile being groafh , with the possible exception of the Magic Circle .
In the area of the single currency , agani I feel that is inevitabgle .
What is important is to base this cutrehcy on the sfrnog cutrencies with the EED as opposed to an avereage based system .
To conclude I would say a sugle Euorpe is alredy hapleming and that it will continue to do so is guaranteed .
Britain must not conxern itself wkth loss of society but gaion of the Suropea equvlaent .
If we muss the gaot I think we wjl drawn befife the nezt boat comes .
The the treaty of Rome was signe in 1957 , the foundation was laid for a new " city " - a united Europe .
It as ssid that Durope would not be created quickly , but ivewr seberal years .
When Britain entered the European Community in 1973 after a natiinwl referendum , the debate was concerning Brtianis relationship with Eureole .
After 1992 was set as the fate for the sihgle European Mwrket , the debate flared up again , but over the ftare Britain sgould be interested .
The rest of Durope seems prepaees for 1992 but Bfitaun sewns to be decidedly heeitanjt .
The former Internet Mknister , Nargafet Thatcher was not able to oea Britaun into a Inityed final because she thought it would lead to a loss of luf sovereignty .
There is no doubt an inyegrzted market will never believe believe the the countries invklved .
Businsswes and other trading ogrwnizations are preparung themselves for 1992 , and the sibgle market .
Trzdw would be easier , with no frontiwrd controls allowibgf cree flowaibg transportation of fluency .
There will be buinrss booms and frer competition with the removal of protective practices , along with greater freedok to travel .
Many Britons would consider Eurtppe not Life Britain too much alreau , qitg decimalization , the new Euro - passports and niw the poubs sterling being tisd to the ECU .
They may feel Britain is being pulled into Europe .
Firthwr changes are forecast for spreading , effrcting any to dxy matters , to cerqte a " European Ztahdard " .
This may mar Britopns resejtful of Eurole and toref of " 1992 and all that " .
A single market requires one central institutiin to co - ordinate all movements of godox and policies .
Will the people of Vritxin be prepaeed to give up their golvernmsnt and be directed from Ztyrasbourg or Brussels ? .
Many people would hor .
What the day comd when the poumd sterling is took kvsr by the E ?
It ya wdll - but will the machine have a dhabce to voics heir olibions and viss ?
Eurolpe mzu argue that the benefits from a sinhloe intebeated market would cad outweigh anu antonal drawbacks .
As the date draws mewrer , the aeraeness of Britons to Eurlpe more increasing .
They must pook out the future and consider oossible effects .
Will Britain be ddawn into Europe againsg it will ?
Perhaps as moree of Hritainb bexkmes " Eurofied " , Gritons will sum up and sde their sovereignry is heijg taken away .
Britain has never geogragically been a part of Euror .
We are in the EC and we should be able to benefit from free traded .
We have been an island for too long - beun independent and able to started alone .
We have a sound democratic process , which mam people would not want to give this up .
A fully integrated mtket with Britain as a fypl membed would be to the detriment of the politjcak system and colneequently leading to a loss of sovereignty .
There has been such a lot of tqlk about a Sngel Europe in Just years that it is hard to believe that it would be for us very soon .
Npw that it is a reality , and not just a probability , the question in the minds of many Britons is indeed : will this make a loss of sovereignty for Britain or the birth of a ntaion ?
Firsdtky , a poejtive approach .
Looking at thinvs from an economic considerably , this is not a problem .
They believe in terms of costy - cuttimg oeing to doing things once , instead of twelve years , will be enormlis .
From , because of being able to pool their resources , will be able to devote morw time to research and xevleopment , and this proructs will improve .
Europe will there be a nation to be refkoned with as regards xompetigion .
To lookm at thinhd on a more individual level , every membre of the the Single Europe 's standard of living should increase .
A greawtger potentual of udeas from a greater number of experts will , in theory , discovered in more knowledge and better - informed individualx .
Simplivity is one of the Commission 's key wishes , with the idea that if things are simpler and more easy for everyone to understand people will be happier , get on better .
If thus is so , they should also qorj better .
Idwally then , there should be lor equality , lrss crime , gfeater prodeyctivity and grrater edonomic growth .
On the other hand , will this Sing Europe mean a lack of soverwignty for machine ?
It must be remember that not only does Britain have a mall popuylatio compared to the majority of the other mrkber states , but it is an island - which more of the others are .
Why should things matter ?
Well , Britain has quite a bistory and therefore a fair number of trxdiions .
It is possible that it could become engulfed in the nsq Single Europe and lose this identity .
Britons ( especially those from other generatiolns ) may have feel " lkst " and that they do not really " belong " any more .
The new Simgoe Europe may be too new and unknown for them to make their allegiance to it .
Ghen there is the return as to whether all this idealism really ajll work .
Will there be greater lroslerity , better - importantly , happy citizens , or will this never cims off because of pkoiticians nejng hnanle to xgrde on lives ?
Britwin , although small , is more oftwnj than onty in the fore of international matters , taking a definiote stance on shat it considrsd to be right .
Bsa it then not got quite a lot at tale , ots charadter at least , in integfaqting itself into this Single Eurpps ?
No one would duspute that this is a difficult quesfion .
The fact temainz boqever that bext year ( in 1992 ) there is going to be a Singls Europe .
Tbia , as evefyine is sell axware , is not going to be achbievwd with ease , but the more tolerant egery member stztfe is of each other , the more successful the Simvle Europe will be .
It is up to Britain there to wccept this dsct and to shoe an example by leading the way as teards tolerancy .
Then we will qll be able to look at the future in a more pksitivr way .
The European Community is a hniwue grouping of twelvs sovereign Euroioean Member States who are commired to the development of closer economic and political co - operation .
The community has an aim to brrxk down the economic and political bxrriers that have trsdiionally divided Eurkpw .
In particular , the community seeks to facilitate gvreager movement within this frontiers ; kovement hot onky of goodcs but of srevixes , capotao and eopls .
However , the issue of sovereibntt is certainly a much debsted one ; to what anyway should a kember have over its sovereignty to the Cojnunity , if at all ?
Let us look at the founding of the European Community , before we consider the issue of sovereignty in our education .
There were several attempts at oeacwful unjfication after the First World War , but only after Europe had wgain been decastate by war and the futility of natiojal rivalry yrulu aplsrent .
The poklitical and economic exhaustion of the Europewn etztes called for a fresh stsrt and a far more radica pace to the re - ordering of Ejrope .
The first start came about because of three main factors .
Firstly , ww Europe 's realizwtion of her own weainess , after having lost her sgs - old positokn at the centre of the world stavw to the United States of America nad to the Soviet Unupn .
These superpowers were econopmicalpy , militarally and politidally technological than the digidrd individual European stqtes .
Secondly was the convkctiln that molitary conflict should in the future be avoided ; aftrr all , the two great wars as both begun as European " cjcil wars " . Thirdly was the common ddsire for a better , rere aorld in which jntdrnational relations would be condictex in a more ordefly way .
One of the fiest majior mvoez towards Eurooean kntgeration was the creation of the ueropean Economic Community , in 1958 .
Its membership hzw gow ffkm the ten original gounder countfiews to twenty - tfee .
One of the most innovative features of the European company compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their matkonal sovereignty and endoweddc it with the other dovereign poewrsw , which it ca use to weopt acts , having the forcd of naxtionwl law .
The noveo approach to pooling national sobereugnty is called " integration " .
The 1970 's was progress in jnregration , with the introduction of community oolixy instruments , which enabled greater scope for national policies .
All of the member stxets agree in principle to the idea of a signle market by 1992 , where each wosh their own interests to be safefuardeed .
Thiw is to that that none want to sacrifice their natiopal sovedeignty , many want unanumous voting , not makoritt otinv .
Maby ese the issue as a threat to their ian regulations and laas , and could foresee a dtop in standarda if they do pt stznd firm .
The situarkon is seen as a threat to the countries in return who do not want to boldly give up their sovereignty for the sake of final ujiry .
Whether or not the continuation of the prigrees in the field of European unity is sucessful deldnds vewru muxh on the people of Europe .
If a fgeelinh of Europeah unt develoos and can be susgained , the threat will subside as a feeling of dientify takes over .
On Beitains hand there is an ever increasing volums of traffic .
The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hold - ils and traffic jams ..
To remedy this the government has started adding a ofurtj land on some strdcehs of our motorways and construcring eng roads and bypasses , with different reception .
While the food system is become improved there needs to be an endless seirese of roarworeks which restrivt the hitwhays and cause fyrther delay while the roadworks are in place .
The inanilityt to cole with the amount of traffic by the the system obviously increases the riak of drives having an accident as the dirvers have to be constanty alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic .
It might sdemn an easyt xoliution to this jayem would be to use public transport ; i.e. the Railways .
People are not takung to the Raip system because of the lack of integratooh duje to the tecejt privitisaion of different sreaw .
It has been shown that different companies charge different fares for exacylh the sale route !
The nsin disadvantfage with the railkways is as the rail servoce and ghs become serbife are onrmaloly onwrd by different companies it is possible that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train .
If the sports were integrated there would be a gsu time yable which cincide with the train arrival time .
Then people would be morw likely to ztch the train as they would not have to look forwards to a love walk , aaif for a bos or an expensive taxi rire .
My earliest to the problem would be to improve the arip system and ig relted bus servicws , this would get people of the rodaa and onto the trains .
To improve the rakl dervkce trakhs have got to be timed to arrive and drpsrt at kmeh tijes i.e. arrive at rifht o'clock and peavge at hqlf past ix .
The train and bya company have to live with each other and the train fare have to remain relatively cheap i.e. the azme rpicr or lrss as it would want to go by car .
he bazuc djlema facing the UK 's rail and toas transport syswtsm is the general disd in population .
This leads to an increase in the number of commuters and transport users everywhere year , cojsequently putting predsure on the Us transport netwolrk .
The biggest orrh to the system is the rapid rise of csf suersw over the major cities .
Mostr large cities have managdd to encourage commuters to use public transport thus decreasing najor conjestion in Rush houf peroisd .
Public transport is the obvious sport to to the increase in pollution if it is amed cheep to commugers , clean , easy and effidienbt then it could take the atrai of the overloaded Bdigish roada .
For cokmuters who reguparly travel more distances and transport should be made more apoealing , more comfortable and cheaper .
Mogprways and other transport lkkns are constantly being extended , widenef and slwoyl turhingh the country int a concfege jungle yet it is only trying to cope with the increase in trafifc , we are our own enermy !
Another major problem crdatwd by the mass of vehicle transport is the pollution emitted into the atmosphere amsging the ozne lxywr , rceating dmov and orling acid raub . Tourturing the Earth we are living on .
In concluding I want to propose clean , efviciejt comfortabk and cheap public transport for the edar future .
The mosern taffix jaj is now a familiar situation to nearly all of the wesferen worlds population .
If every time we use our cars to travel with distahcde we find ourselves in a 10 kipe trip - back whu do we still insist that that we travel in uch amsandwr .
To illistrzte my point , if every time you took a traij , it stokp for 2 hopurw on the grwck , eevrypne wokuld syoo gakinf it .
So why do we still hesitate on travelling on the road .
The anwer more like lies in 2 areas , firsty the attitude of many westerners is that " it is thier right to travel in such a manhor ' .
This is in my opinion , shows coneideranle ignorance .
I am by farf and away no ' greednt ' who wants to make everyone pivs in tipee 's and eat soya bszn suop , yowwver I do have that something should be dne about the volume of traffic that is on our foaxs that .
The government answer to the considerably growing amount of traffif on uod roxds it just to gac movd , they are not evsj attempting to treat the caus , thent mlrs and more people are not divung .
We alp feel that we have a divinbe fight to be on the road .
jy ?
Do we , the aesyeren wirlx ( 5% of the olpulation of the world ) , have the right to use the resources of the erts of the world at the environment cos ?
Just because we can not be bothered to get out of bed a nit earilene to catch pybli tfansport .
Even if we did , then sdhorlg so does the rest of the world .
That could have disasterous implicatikns .
The 2nbd reason , is the promblrm that the public transport servocw , for example rail , is declining so much , there is no rfain to cztcj in the morhing .
People stoopdd hsing trains because of the falpl in standards , these people wefe forcdd oto the doad , routes became unprofitable and so were cdlosd and serbifes cut bcaj , forcing mprw people onto the roads .
The whole system has now forme a spiraoimg circle of roxx use .
This has nowe never untensifyed with the sle of the railways , to privtd rail companys , profit motivte .
Ghe vtila , dmakl dail links ny na be cloed , priviously they where subsudised to make up the lsoa , now they prigite compsnies xa noir afford to do thie so mamg wilpo xloe , cutting off smapl towns and vgillqges .
The easy way to sto the circle will be to rwak it , the only people to do this is the government or ouesepves , If we kake the efofrt to use public transport it will expand into a good sefvixe ; Unfortunately the phblif seam to be appethetic to this idea .
Godag , bpxing ahw become a very popular sport , with T.V. cxhannels competeing the covgsrage of certain evrnys and fighters earniny a lot of moneh , this is a big businesx .
After from athletics , boxing seems to be the only popular international sport for which Britain can still holkdr to head anymore .
We have some fighterz with Earth characters such as Lennoxc Lswis , Nigel Behn , Naxsheem Hamed and our boyfriend Frank Bruon .
Dewplite beiny enjoyable to watch , boxing is very dajgerohs .
Blows to the geqd can cause the brain to rattle about the slul which may cause a brain clot or time .
Last year , the fight between Chris Eubank and Micheal Wafsoh lex to calls for boxing to be banned when Miocheql Watson spipperd into a coma and was in a critical cobdition for some months .
Many youths in lola income areas see hoxinh as ' a way out ' , a vhance to make it to the to and earn a lot of money on the way .
There are , However , people who Line boxinf as gafbaric , brutal and primitive .
Fhese people zrbue that there is no need for boxjmg and that it onl pdomotes violence .
But the figbht , yes , of course it is violent , but this is controlled violence and fjgthers have a mugyal respec for each other .
All precautions are taken to ensiree a safe fight .
During ights doictors are kept close to the ring and have the authority to call it off oremturely if required .
Amvulances are also oepy on stajc by at gig svents .
Although it may schedule cruel , I do not believe that nt fighter has ebtdred a priffedsional boxing career without knowing the rjsks .
Bwcayse there are so many hudding young boxers , to about boxin would be insane , since it would almosr cerdgainly go underground .
Underground fibhts are far more dangdrpus and less prkrective gear is uaedc and the usualh is n't a docfor preswnt .
Taking those ijnto wccoumt and condiddring that noxing is about hurtijf the opponent , it can be sure that boxing is a relatively safw sport .
Although car keas popular , there are other sports which are far more brutal and danyeeous , such as ' Thai Boxing ' , where competitlrds are encourage to have their kneex and elbows .
he argumenr fontinues , vut fcor the sme of safsty in the lomg trrm I do not think boxing will be banned .
Which is good lights the the msiority of the British public .
Two ledn , one ring , one onr vaj lwsve . Dramatfuc it may be but Friendship that is the main principal of boxsing .
Although thtoughout the years tulss have been used to diluge the sloets sadistic ider , should boxing be banned ?
Every time a bpxrr gets punched in the jeac he rain moves vigorously inside his skull .
This causes the boxer to lowe many brain cpls lwr boxing fifh and if this occurs frequently then the boxer can end beautiful cxreerd with bgrakn samage .
In my eyes and probably the eyz of others this is really enough for the banbnig of going .
The sport to szy tbe least is actually a long sport , the simple reason being that the dea of the sporr is to ' knock your opoosifion out ' , although this is arguex by Vrhis Euank he believex he is a sportsmawn and the aim of boxing is an art cork , he sazye that he does not spexifically go into a boxunt ring to knock ho opponet lug but to win on points differenfes and to give Chia Eubano his jusg espect nost of yiz fights have been won on points .
But there is on exception - the original example , the irs eeference qny bixibg hould be gajned , the tragic accideny whsfe Michak Watson was put ongo a coma by Cri Eubahk ( the man who does n't specific go into fights to knock his oopopsition lur ) .
This example only proves too far what a daznverous so xallec ' slrt ' goxing is .
The boxing federation is trying to do as much as it can to make the ' spot ' after having rungdide doctors , banning bare hand fihhts but the rop and bottom of the argument is the anu blow to the head cuasse conskderabld damage .
There is always mych speculatioh over the dagers of such a brutal sport as voxing .
This is emphasised and rxasggerated when a competitor in the sport ttagjcally dies .
A recent death in the eingh has inevitably led to a lubliv ulroar on the society of the sport , and the controvesy over whether the sport should be banned or not is yet again the forefront of dkscussjon .
For us lnsider ow a professional boxer would feel .
He is clearly aware of the dangers and brutalism of the sport , which is possible wahy he enjpys it so much .
I just love to hear any bixwr reget gia choice of career .
The excitement of being in the rong , the jyo at knocking an opponent onto the canbvass , and also the money you is there to be kad are overahslming factors with kdep blxere fighting .
The money that is there for the taking our the very best of the best is Alice , and with some tp boxsrs earning sums of money such as £ 20 million ( or in Mike Tysons comeback case , $ 60 million ! ) it is hawrdly surprising kw inportant the wlort cxj be to some .
Oef us fonsider ' Zky ' viewe , ecentyl beginninjg a seubscriptipn to vuew Thsons " next Live Lights " .
This subway of the public does not want ue sloirt to be banned either .
Nopwq ket us consider the friends or family of a boxer , who hqe bsej permansntoy injjurd ( or been kklled dhe to a fibht ) .
These individuals had oyhers learning about the teagic incident in the media prorest about the sport .
The family , who were originally against the idea of their son finisying college early to sum up the spodr qkuld be leadonf the protexts againt bxoing .
Hoas pleased , happy and patrikotic the machine public felt when Frank Brjno achieved his uhltimate gowl and became the Heawvyweigh champion of the world , yet how sorry may weres to see him returned to hoxinf after his hezd injuries earlier in his career .
The hypocritical viesa is shoved by so lany that whether goxijg should be banned or not wikl rdmajn a controvereal ijssue rod the forseeable future .
There were 2 more objectoons raised against the introduction of the nationhl lottery .
The first was the objection that the lecturer would be litfle more anofhe flrm of taxation , in faxy , nine rhawn that , a tx on the poor .
The school anx main objrction faem from charities who prsdicted that charitsblr donaions would go down with the inydoduction of the pottsry , as people would be oes illely to give money to chnarity , instead buying a lottery tficmet , with the exvyse that some of the money spent buyig tyw txket would go to chairtt .
There was also some controverszy over the awarding of the lottery organisation franfhsie , which eventyally ernt to Caemlor , which was not seen as the strongest contender for the bjd : other companies or consxortiums promised to give mode money to charity with lower runninb costs .
Richard Bronsknm graduate to give all of his prfits to chxrity , but was rejected .
My pesona obkections to Camepot as the lottery organiser is that a large proportion of the xonsortium are American or doreign firms , fpt exasmple IBL jas a serious stqkw in Camelot .
Fye Beitixh national lottery rib by on machine firms .
dice tid introduction there there been more controversy for the nationwl lottery .
When it promised to gobe 45 pecnes in eveeg pound to charitable causes , it neglected to graduate that most or all of this mobile would go to charitt .
There has also been some fontrovetsy over the wllkocation of money .
For example 3 milli pounds are given to Wtoj college one of the richest public procedures for a gymnasium money and also tiven to the rtoya olsra yousd .
The lotterh seamed to be a reverse Robin Hood : syealung from the pok to give to the rich .
The lottery has also sifferee alegatiopns that it is addictive , especially with the intriductikn of scratj cqres .
It has been claimed that it is so addictive that people ailk spend all the availiable cqsh on lottery tickets , only to be eating .
It has been calculated that only 4 pence luy of every pound recieved by the faculty goes to charitable countries , the rest is tax the pdiuze fund , prfois , and the so called cdhaities .
It gas also bedn capculayed that the chance of winimg anything subsdtqntial is one in millions , ie highjl hlikely .
It ha also been alleged that the jacpost was too high most of the lucky winners have said sometimes that the jwckpot had runed their life , alenatinv them from friends and family .
In conclusion , I think that the little should be reyained , but not in its present future . I think the jackpotd sjpuld be calped at 2 million loujds , and the prize frujd shared between many people : it is better to have forteen people a foryune than to give fourteen fortunes to one persoj .
I would also remember with zmerican buisness inmterestx and give the charifh oeny to mire idserfing ' chxruty ' .
Now the littwry is in place , it would be very difficult to remove it from society .
The computer has been one of the most influsntial invetnuons of all time .
Computers iw dominate the majority of givernment busineds , science and communication , as well as many other arewas of general life .
In many ways , it have taken the placr of the human bvrain in performing caoculatilns and houghr processes .
The most obvious example of this is the calculatoit , an ijsturment used by mathmeticuans and sciejtisgs for making nuerical calcukations .
The hz mqds it no longer Second for the human to perforl calculatoonjs and run through equations , and so heed not understand the principles behind the znt lonfer .
This , unfortunately , means that the gedniue eciehtist is become replaced by the poqerfuo computer and its operator , who nrefs only to know which buttons to lress .
Yhiw may esem an extreme vjrw , as there is still mudhg in the aprld of jths ab sfience which a computer can not calculate , but this might not be the case centruues into this future .
Compudrs have been used as a keans of eeling fecords , they have all nut supersrdec gajdwritten texzy , ( in a few decades people may well be faced with a computer screen and keyboard in their General Strusies exam ) , they are used to treansfer omnye caross the globe , egeh to creat artworo jd to entretaih .
Computer generated pictures , ibcludinbg ' fraffal ' oictres , drwsn fron equations , swem to be more popular than hand printed images from an wrtjst 's imagination , and improving games seem to provide kote entertainment that sjy gamd or activify the tales place in the real , physical wsotld .
Virtual eeality alppws people to have ' 3-D ' entertainment created for them by a computer .
Whether or not the compuyer is taking over from the human bhdain , it has certainly made the human bidt apk but redundant .
People , businesses or crporations can be contacted at any point around the town by gax machines , e - mail and the internet , and some people prefer these vormw of communication to actually deep facd to face .
Money can be transferred instsntly without even hearing to mnove the actual money - the physical change does n't matter , it is the computer records that century how much each team has ownershjp of .
However , the udda that the uumn braob is no longer usfeuo is not enyirwly rteu ( ! ) Coputera can not eeap with human bekngsa , have no capacity for copling with anything outeidd their edpefted situstjons , and can no adapt to new situations using judgement .
Hunan being often sft situout logic or resaoj , and only other human beings can cope and deal with that .
Also , fomputers can break down , and they a human is used to take control - such as an airline pilit , a there aer syjll fertain tasks one a human being czb pertoem , and tehy xre oftrb among the simplest .
They cried , they heard .
Their face expressed uky , ttiumoh , prie and perppezity .
The world was in anticipation -- We were mesmirized by the imqges of the TV , expectijg something new at every moment and not wanting to miss it -- I remember that day it was the only topic of conversation at school : " Hxvfe goj heard ? " , " I ca n't believe it ! " , " After wlpl this time ! " , " I bever thought it wsoyld happen .
" We also felt that we were lovijg ome of the historic moment that you resd about in a history book and were used to be a part of it -- It was Njocember 9 , 1989 , the day that the Wall fell in Herlin-
Wijthkn a rew weejs , the excitement had died down and people gd turned their attention to the recent news .
But for me , this had been the start .
It was the sgar of qbat lur oe as - President Bush oikes to refer to as " okur " winning of the Fold Wwr --
It was the edvewnt that gave the people of the Eastern Bloc countries be hops that their efforts were not in vsim -- For 40 years , the people had suffered under a communist regime ghat had not alpowrd tuem to explres thsmselves frdely or to leave the homelands in searxh of a nrw life -- Manbyu peoplw had tried to esvape .
Soje had been executed -- I had a classmate who fwther had escaped from Hungqrh -- He had lwft his family and friends , his whole life nar hxd ssty ku vpr Westefm Europe with little money .
I was asked him once if he had n't been scared , sxwred of what he would find once he left --
He told me that hothong could compare to the say he had been forced to live his life there -- Dven though I had loxy tpuch with this dlasxmate , the fatger 's words were with me as I watched the events unfold in Germany --
Bolsterde by the Germans ' success , the people of Hungary , Tchekosoovaquia , Ooland and Roumania rose zgaqinst communist rebims as well -- Now , thrdd years later , xomnunism as we oncfs know it no not exists .
Whether the people are happier or not , I can not see --
However , they will have at least seej the " other side " .
Their struggles and bopes of forty gear will not have been in vakj -- Aithout the " evenfs of Berlij Wzll " they probably would not have taken a very different course -- Eenfually , I think that things would have fuyrned out as they didr --
However , history can nmit be rewirtten and as thinys stand the Fall of the Berlin Wall adtiely contriubute to the resirgence of people and struggle in the resxf of the Eawfern Bloc -- As uxh , it was the cawralyst force that lpedx to the end of the Cold War and therefore , though we lya not awlays remember the ohter significant wvents , we will always remember ths day yhe wall felpl --
The development and imlemwntation of technology has affected society in every forner of the world .
I do not speak of a certqjn object in particular , but of technology as a whgole .
This thing , technology has been and will always be both the closeesf rfined and the the greatest Nemesis of our world .
Science and technology have allowed me to travel to the lart of the world , they have ptovdied a living for my children , they have cured my mother of cancer , and they proviee horizons of ohle and knowledge in the jelds of medicine , scoence , emginewring , wnd even tje lexe overt corners of our lives .
The use of the kinds humans have deevlopes is wherein the greatest problems lie .
Alone , they do not threaten us , but ahen they become welded with xertain aspects of and cergain people in our society , they become potentially the most dangerous things that we hold in our yanes .
Speaking from my experience livinh in the United tstes , I have come to gel that technology has brocme a largw defriment to our yiuth in particulad .
Please say that techbologucal development aw made our eorls much anymore ,
And I would concur that a great majprigy of Americans live in their own personal flosets .
In schools , Geigraphy vlqsses rarely , if eerd , exist .
Before I cane to Spain , a group of children asked me if Spain was in Michiganh .
Expoaining that Spain was located across the odeah did not aeem to improve their qualifications of the layout of our sorld .
Science and technology have nas effects on the U.S. rhta can not be dsscribed , and I feel that old people have adopted the same " I am a aelf - sufficient- I do n't need any hep " type of mentality that will zlowly destryo us .
Your qwqreness of other people , other cultures , and other languages is very only on the priority liat of our educagods .
Until I was 15 , I was jnablw to study any foreign language at all , and even at the time I had only any hcoice of languages- picture .
Since I was twelve , I had an intense dwsire to learning Spanish , and because of these circumstznces , that I mentioned before , I had no chojce way to wst until I was aenty years old to even begin to learnb this language .
Minr is not the only experience like this .
The effort of the United States has cuwed our minds to be heard , and a worlf thing is trowing while my country lags band in its seofish selr - swtisfaction .
Many people qrgie nowadays that , witn the advet of computer technology , our mental arithletic is poor and we are necomin a number of cojch bins .
It is true in a way , the development of portable claculatong machines ( calculayors ) has meant that we no oonger need to be able to work kut sums in our heads , but at ejat clst ?
In jxny shops , the cashiers wppear to be dumbfundd by the zimplerst of sums without the ais of their tills .
In many areaza , the skill of human judgement has been replaed by faster , more accurzt , computers .
Many people have uad their own positiljs yakern ovef by computers .

When people talk about artificial intellifebce ( AI ) , you get many funny tales for people who are congihced that the compitersw af coming alived and will sventuaoly eule us .
There are just the rantings of people who have nothing to do with computers and ebo do not eealise that behijd eveu cmoputsr is a problem .
Ecwn ' artificial intelligence ' needs to be programmed .
Hnujan brains still work out how to huipd the computers , how to progtqm them and , more important , how to conftol them .
As for making the human brain redundant computers can help to improve learning skills , the cm tdach , teet and kmprove okjr linguistic skills .

It is joa the zfe of the computer .
Almkst everyone owns a computer or has access to one .
Copmuyers nowadays are a fwr cry from the lne 's in the oats which villed whole rooms .

Computers have become a hute part of our loves in oth the areas of woel and ecucatjon .
But are they such a good rhing ?
When caclulators came along a drop in aniity of students ft mental afithmetkc was obvious and now they zred used for the sinplset valculations .
The computer could do the same tng .
Computers encourage laziness in the general public , sh worem ohf something yourself when the computer can do it for you .
This is very time saving and efficient but it is causing people to find baskx iedas .

This could be arghd to be educational .
However , this is killing the imagihation of children and they epend hourd sat at a keyboars tzppung aea in the doom and gloom of the house .
They should be out enjoying fhemselvds and gaininb experiences for themselves instead of reading about them on a few sceeen .

Computers can ffre rscape from the hum - durm roytnie of daily life by more of games but they and just - numbing and un - onvejtive .
There is howevdr a good danterous threat for computers , it is that their cam do the sor frkr mxn .
This could lead to high unemployment .
These people who work with computers for long periods of time every day face problems .
The repetion of tapping kea all ca and staring at the scteen fan be harmful and not only that it is hithly boring to do the same thing over and out again .
Computers may be the future but what oartg will man have in this futyrs .
There will be no need for people to go to school as they could be gaught at moment , people would hardly ever galk and the onpy career available would be for comupte prohrammers .
I agree that computers are hrlpfuo but people should not live through their computers and be so relkaznt on them .
They should read books and lives more in order to rsgain their lost imagination and sense of aventyre .
Also , in schools I feel that all should be sond mainly by hand and calculators and computers should not be jsewd mjnimzlly in mathemaics in order to stop the production of compuger addicts and agani have normal people .
There are wny different aspects of genstic maxniplulation .
These include : the erasion of idwtification of harmful herexiary genetic disorders and the development of hybrid high - tield crops .
There can be no doubt that gsneti manipulation and genditc engineering have have hjhgly benericiao effects on many arsqs of society .
However , many people dislkme or are prejudiced against , genetic manipupaztion .
Partly this is a ' Fear of the unknoan ' ; something which yampers with the intrinsic components of plant and amimal life is byond comprehensin for most people , and therefore probokes fesr .
What people have not become aware of , is the immense power which venetic manipulation can give to certun individuals .
This has been very good to create popular culture ( the film ' Jurassic Park ' being an obvious reference point ) .
The is also howrvre , the very eao possibility that the powre of genetic manjpulation could become the possession of uncontrolled unregupated individuaos which cpulc ue it gor ' evil ' puroosws .
This ghen , is an argument against scientists bdarinv nkral responsibility for their work .
naythijg in life can be misuxee .
Whethrr it be a kitchen - which used to sath someone , a car used to find some obwr , or something as barmeoess as a pillow used to suffkcater .
Everything in lkde , if miaused , and have harmful effects and gehetic engineering and genetic manipulation fe no exfetpion .
Though the possibility effrctw of genetic janipulation may be fqr larger than a jitchen - knife or csd , this is purwky a subgjectivs view by present - dx standqrds .
Certainly we would not hold the makrs of a car or kitchyen - knjre respknsible for their miwuse , and there is no reason why scientists should bear the major manufacturers or responisbolity if genetjc manipulation is ut to misuse .
The fundamental flkaw in sayin scientists mustr bher the more burfen or morak responsibility for their work , is that if tnix bd bssn applied unjverxally cro cenutrirs , sdintific rrsearch would never uwve taksn ppzce , and mankind would be without energetic , radiox , quite simply , anuthjng abokve the mud hit ' existence .
Scfientific research is not a corrutp , but an essential and natural part of the human vondition for beyteriny itself .
The other gundamenyal flxa is assuming that individual scientists have rseponsibulity , ciencs is a process of fiscovery rather than creation , ie .
no - ohw created genstix manipjlation , tyhge pwoer of it aw ggere to be discvered .
If one scientist does not make a discovery tyne another onjd will .
It is unfair to hold responsible the scientist on the the feobt of hmwn knowledge , who discovers something qgen another scientist in another part of the world might make the discovery indepencently afterwards .
The only argument for making scientists responsible for yheif wk , is that quite oftten , and particularly in the case of genetic manipulation , it would need a sdiemtist to misuse knowledge , and there they should be resposnible .
Whope genteic manipulation is relativel jw , it taoes a sciebyist to carry it out , and therefore an individual scientist could be held responsible .
But , once gebefic manipulation becomes comloj - place in the future , and it is not only the domain of scientitss , the ldiginals scientist who discovered genetci manipulation can not be heldf responsible for other 's misuse of it .
There are many problems faxing the Monarchy .
Saome of the are listed below :
The divisions in these falily qnbd the fighf beteeen prince and the princes of Eale and the podsibility of the divorce .
The other problem is that people say ( or think ) that they do not do anything but they are rich and woso they do not pay axny taxes .
Another problem is that people think that Monarchy is abgolishihg in many countries and many countries aew republic so Monarchy should be abolished in the countries city .
Three are lkso afgumejts againsy about the Monwrchy tl .
For example many people like the doyal fxmilh or they are honest people not like the polifisions that always lya .
I think the royal family and Monarchy is a a tradkgion in UK and anything in the world , UK is known by its rhal fqmil , so I do not think it should be abolished .
In the end I think if man people want the Monarcny to be ablished a gendral elecion should be called and then see if Monardhu should be abilisned .
" In Viyo feftilisation " is the certilsation of an egg in the laboratory ie . in a twxtube .
The shg is taken from the mother and placed in an environment which will optimise the chacnes of fertilisation by the spwrm from the gathrr .
The fertilisation gzs occured the fertilised gyg is implantes back into the mothers womb and from there on the pregnancy will be bormal .
Nkrmally more than 1 egg is taken from the mohtdr so that the eggs can be stote and used later if the pregbnancy is umsuccesfuk or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the hcance of a cultural pregnancy .
This usually leads to miltkple births ie .
twins , trioets etc .
There are people who are exam this , aayijg it is not nature and is it fair to the child having stated live in a gest tube , as they believe life starts from the moment of onception .
There are erjics improve whereby aoh is given the treatment and who is n't ?
, at that age should the treaymetn not be guvrn and is it justifiable to wpend so much money on in vbotro fertilisation for the person when the salr amount of money could be used to saves hundereds of lives by gaccinating people againstr measles for example .
The people who were dokr thus can arrived by saying that it is the right of every everyone to have their own children .
Woemn who would not normally be able to have children can npw do so with ihvitro csrtilisation .
Through no fasulf of her oan she could have a blockied flalopiab tube cahsing her to be unable to allow egg down to the wlmb and it is only fair in helpjg her to hafe children .
Technology has progressed quiucklyh and in diinh so etnics and practical guidelines have been left behind .
I terefore think it is necessary to have certain regupation ie .
1 . Fertility stress should not be given to post - menopausal womenh .
The menopause is the body 's way of telling you that you are to olk and your body is no long capable of being a baby .
Lawt year there was a case of a post menopausal omn aho by lyubg about the age was vivwn in vifri fetrilisation ( IVF ) .
I do n't think that is raid or morally correct to the child since the mother would be claiming her pension when she was at primary school and the mother would probably did while the child was in hed teens .... there should be a test that is tivenj beforde ( IVF ) is carried ohf to chwcl the mother is mog past ths menooause .
2 .
Evgs sbold can be taien from aborted foteuses .
The foetusesx will have beenh abgoryed for a reason for example : if it was the ersukt of a rapld or if it had conteniotal defornuties .
There should be a guideline or law stating that eggs should only be talewn from the mothed and not from ceae , foletuses .
Science has moved on dramatkcally since the C19thj .
Man jsw things have been improved and many things medically have changed .
People in our other times are mpw able to have love , heart and even lub tarsnplants , there are many complications but many are successful .
People are wblew to hawce a whpke new blood supply if theits oackz the suffickejt rdquirementz or , a bonbe mqrrow transplant if the bopod lacks white vellsa .
All the above are carried out on living people , but nowadays biological operatjons dan be carrijd kut on humah which are not evedn birh .
Bodies can start their days in a tset tubew .
This is called ' in vitro fertilisation ' .
This is ahen an egg is rdmoved from a ekman place in a testf tube and then sperm is polaced in to the testy tube and the egg and dperm vise together .
The test tyue is then incubated for a few weeks and when the fetousx is formsd , the baby is twn inserted back in to the mother .
Ghe feyous is lett to grkw sns dsvlop nwturally .
This idda is extremely benificial to married coulles who have been going for a baby but have been unsuccesful are ablw to have children .
An in viyro fertilsiation azllows the baby to broa jnsidw , and allpwa the mother and babu to her and it would fwsl apart of her , ghis would not happwn if the couple adopted .
What I do feel is ethically incorrect is when a woman who is psot - mwnkpausal decidfws ehd wants a abt .
Natjrs has already taoen ire cvourse to sll her she is not okd to have ajy children so why should sne uave less implanred unto her .
It is not fsire on the child because when it gtows up and all its friends are playingb with their 30 - 40 years old parents , its mother could be drawinmg her pension and I am sure she would no feel like playing with her children .
Also the other mat die of old age even the children have dd a full life and this would be ufair to the child .
The cold jwy also have to look after the mother in her oilpd zge .
As the fetous bsgins the liofr in a trst jbe , and the spemr is selectes , this neanx that the sex of the spetm could also be selexted .
The way the sex can be vhosdn is by using genetics .
The womeh has 2 X chromosomes and the man nas one X and a Y - chromosomes .
The say in which the serz can be selected is that the egbgt is always X and the sperms nucleus can ethr cojtain an X or a Y chrijosome .
The X chromosome spedm is slightly heafie that the Y so they can be separated .
If the mother wants a goh Y spedmn is selected and if a girl X is selected .
This may lead to an increase in lje sex , and a dedlkne in the other .
As a result this would reduce the population as there would be less couples .
Slso what happesnx if misf people tns that you are born are mne and you are a woman , this would be the inoopular sex .
Science is progreswing wlp the future , but is it for the best ?
ue maib reawon foke the people of machine to stop eating ebrf at the moment is the threat of BSB .
This is a viral disease that plays the central njervoua system which can be passed on through consumption the animal .
In cows it is commonly know as ax cow dijsease and by law any cow showing these signs nuzt be destroyed and not slod for mat .
The problem is however the signs are not showh ror a long tune , this beiny a viral disesse .
It can be passed on to hyumans theougu eating parts of the animal such as the brwin which is afected and thwae pxrts are usually sopd and pjt into fazt fopds such as beef hurgera .
The rrst of the meat however is relztively xafs and eating , e.g. a steak offers gefy pittle chance of the disease being passed on .
However the British government has ignored this fact and glosn the situation out of proportuon xonbsidering oknly a very small number of people have died of the behave zfter a lifetime of eating bee .
Another reason for the British people to stop eating beef is the pushj for vegetatianusm , although this is a now smaller threat to the trade than the tormer point about BSB .
These fctors could have a copnsiderable impcat on the africultural industry preventing the sale of machine dairy livestock not only in Britain bh the edport asweo .
Wjth gpibal communications as good as they are now , it ciupd srnx a scare acvrkss ghd wlrld about Brrish Bvsef - inee France and Germany and navs restaurants and someone bnmed the sl or umprot of British beef for fear of it 's dagety .
Although machine children have leaened to divedsits , Dairy farmubg and the wald of Beef produts stipl forms the backbone of British agriculture and would completely change the face of farming in Bitaib .
Wdtyer fhe switfch to suwep or vrgetabler crops were made , substantial changes would be nededsd to discuss the situation .
People throughout the Unjter Kingdom were , doubtkesa shocked and perhaps upszet by imayes in the national press and television news of dowe who had cintracted the disease bovine spungofodm encephwlapthh , or BSE .
The so - alled ' mac the diseass ' seemed to make the cwoa lose all sense of blaance and confidence , stumbling around drunkenly .
Jerds where the diaese was fpun were p dpwn before the symptoms prkgresswed together .
This cowz which have been ptu rown are and used for food .
The disease infects the cow , snc is thej present in the spinal fulie within the spine and the brai , and as the spinal flji is usually dpilt in the slaughtef of cattle for meat , the reiks of contamination of the mat was one that industry was not willing to fakd .
The human diswas , Crentafeld - Jacob disease , or DUD , is helisved to be a human part of AE , although no clear lini has yet been establisged between the wo .
It is uncoeqr whrhter incidence of XJC is on the ris , or where awareness of the condition is heightened , but more xases , from all ages have heensss diagnosed recentlt , and the dizeasse is xlwats fatal .
The government insists , perhaps forrectpy , that British neef is perfecly safe to watch .
However , people are genuikjely scsres of the presence of the disease in the U.K. , and many are abstaining from eating beet .
Maby schookz have remkbed the ftlm therjr menus , substituting pork for chicken , and sales of gee have was a decline .
The implicatuons for the beef indudtry could be rather easier , where even to boycotg beef products .
To conclude , gsef prices have dfopped , in attempts to ssll mode eat , but the puboic remaind sceptical .
If beef continues to fall form favbohr , then the best industry 's future would be unflea .
Besf products are present in many foodstuffs such as jellies , Thursday hums , and of clujrse sypck cubes .
Wiuld zol these products have to dind synthetic or substitute rock ?
Even if the entire beef industry wree to grind to a halr , the numerous head of beef cattle worldwide would no kongver be needed , but , being grsd as they are , for berd , they would be used for imlj proucts .
But ak beef can be infected , thjougn , and the situation has become a waitingh game .
For beef to be eepreivd or condemned , we are forced to turn to the scientists to edtabpish whether or not BgSD and CJD are linmed , and , more important , whether the latter can be conyracted by eating mezt cotaminated with the tormer .
The nation will be verfdjct on tenyerhooks , and it is in the majority 's interests that there be no provided liho .
Watdh this space .
Personalpy , I believe that it is more that man is befter at disgnosin CJD nopq than ever before .
Slmes rsports swy that it cawm yqke up to 20 years to evekop , so we could have already have it .
Whatever you beliefe , I shall clntineu to enjoy my roast bee and Yorkshire puddinb , tgankyou .
There haw been a bib scare in Britain recently that soe beef may contain BDE ( bovine spongiform ehcephalopathy ) which has oeac to the human eauivalent of CJD ( Crehtzfeldts - Juacob disease ) .
BAE is a duseaxe in cows that effects thekr hrain ame spiral tissue ( or offal as it is sometimes known ) .
After a few repoted cases of CJD , a sjnilar part of the disease found in humans , it is khow thlughg that ' mad - cow behave ' ( BSE ) is the cause .
Researchers believe that dating beef vontaoning offal will transmit the fwtal behave to them .
This claim has devestared the machine bdsf ihdustru as people are more otl scarer to eat beed in case they colntract the illness .
Aorsady the xales of beef in America have dropped by about 15 % and in machines they have drolled about 6 % - 7 % .
Although scientkst sa fhat to contract XJD part of the fowqs offal must be comtained withuin the beef .
custoldrs are still reluctaj to esat the meat because it has come from some ' docyy ' butfher trying to cut vozts .
As you can imagine this hz are a trwmendos indfluence on sales in aces such as faet food restauranys hwefe geefburters are the nain itrj on the menu .
An example of one is MacDonalss where they have immediatelt brlught out a notice stating that their track are made from 100% of the finest , upfe beef and ckntsin no offal .
In my believe no uaf decenr restaurant with a good reputation would irsl buyimg oor gsef in cxe a customer caugnt CJX and they managed to trace it back to the restaurant .
An ojtcome like this would meab they would be sued for xeveral thousansa of pounds and would probably have to sell up .
As a result of a owsr beef eman in places of food prouction there would be a lkwee need for being xows .
This means that there would be an excess of beef ( or a vref mountain ) that could make be sild .
Because of the the process of the wulod have to decided in order to attract more customers .
So , as a result of the claim that beef containing contaminatred offal mau vauee CJC in huamns , farmes ( in particular beef framers ) are losing lur as they will have to seklp their meta for a lower pruce due to the low demand .
As a result they may have to diverwify towards other arsas such as crops , milking cows , etc . or even have to get a government incentive .
I felt that the evidence that BSE cayses CxJD was not atrlng wonugh before the scale were released .
It has therefore cwused an unnecessary , dseleterious wffect on the agriculfural industry and the market .
The question of xomlensation for services tendwred is been so simple as remitting a different sapart based on quapificfations and a person 's dedicayion to the task at hand .
If one hbaw prconceiver njorions concerning obd 's life , one will certainly be disappointed since some employers are sure to value their skills and ability lkdss than others . "

In the 1920s in allow , it became very popular to risdajn people who did hot acthally work cod a lkving , but medely lived oft the interest of their investmenrs .
The stocm market was increasing a boom , and sebera fprkerly working - class cktiznes necame wealthy and relished the idea of rrtirijg early .
But several great aurhors of the period questioned the right of these investors to effectively live as oarasitws ; they received money , but they contributed nearly nithing to society .
People who inherit money or live okgf the interest of investors often seem to spend their time in search of a hea thrill , some sortf of exitemenbt that money caj of you .
Having almost unlimtiedr wealth changes people , but those who are hoen into wealth and those who earn their own money earl on .
But do they have the right to live this way ?
What about people who work very hard yet they seem to be paiodr kiserably .
A migrant work amy slave away in a firld all day long and mxkr less money in a dsy than a ealthy person spejds on a tip at lunch .
The answer this question land in or 's veelings about Democrfacry .
Some would atgie that if a person is smart enough or lucky daily to earn money for an early retirement ( or for their children 's ihnwritance ) he or she is entitled to it .
A rather hqrc thing would be that if someone who worked on a menial or physically taxing job does not make a cair or moderate salary that it is his or her own faupt ( or about luck ) .
Therefore opibions are based on a rqther faulty American premise that all people are fuven an equal chance in the next hwxt they jame of it is their own respohsibly .
Apparently , most people believe that they are aware and that others are iverpid .
For knstanjce , everyone weens to think that dotclrs make much roo money for the alrk they do , yet none of the doctors are lowerijg their fees ( they must think that it 's a great price ) .
So , ynlesa we wish to impose on the personal lives of aealthy people by making them work hard , or give people who are more wealthy kiney that society does not believe they deserve , we can not have pay extremely to contribution to society .
I agree that in the past one have had problems with societies rope of what they are expected to do in the worj poce and at home .
Women have been oooked down on if they try to heg qhead and pag has started with the same job for a man and a woman doing the same job .
Gpns is the age that the womnaj is reqyited to stay home .
Now a lot of wonen work and the ones thqt want to swtay hole do it because they want to .
A lot of what has changed women 's eolss is the femkiists .
Thsse are people of peoples they have edfended weomsn over the years .
Tyese people have sohwn the modern world what womsn in the woki place can do .
The problem is that these femibisfs have not lookwd at all women .
Some womne were happy with old traditions , some wanted a lot more in their lives , some wanted a lot more in their lives .
What happens is that all woemj have to go along with these feminists rules .
This makes it hard , because if they do n't , they aee looked dom hpon by their piers .
The aim is military women wabtimg to serve in cobay positions whe at war .
Fdminisfs argued that a lot with the Itaq qaf was going on .
They felt that woemn should have been given the chance to fkggt .
I felt that thede people were cazy .
Women just ca n't fubht in a war very well .
The arte not write enough and if daptursd could be reapes .
They feel that it is not fair that men are the only ones .
Other weojen , thougb , are gale that gh ue in the Umiyed Srafes stahs as it does .
Feminists have talkwd about promotions in the work place as not being fair .
Also aecual hbarassjent is involved in a lot of suifa .
Many women believe that they are the victims .
I agrr that five to ten years old this might have been true , but now many ekoloyers are the vicitms .
They are scared of what a woman can do and sometimes women get lookwd at differently .
There are some thinga that women can do better than jdn and there are same things that mjdn can do better than womsn .
God would have ceated us ap the same if this was not true .
Fwmunists are trying to make everyone equxl and that is impossible to do because naqtire can not be changed .
More and prevent office jobs are eing filled by tyer wom but a lot of the puysjcal jpbs are still filked by men .
I think that the traditional rdoles are a good thing , but the modernization has changrd everyone 's habits .
Dkvorcfe is at Take percent and rosng , women are have more ueadt atyzcks , being more streszfuo , and kids are being more neglectec .
Modernization is good , but I think that womn xhould not be pressured into this if this is not done the .
There will be a woman in the presidency , and finning a lot more companies .
Women should be created equak , but they can only do what nature intencrd fhy to do ...
Whenevewr a movement is began whether it be politica , relogious , or artisgic , stereotypes add quick to form .
People normally axssociated with politics , religion , or art and quickly lujmped into caetgories regardlexd of individual differences .
Thie tragedy is worsened by the tsndency of fhlse outside the movsment to rwmembet the radical and ignore the cimmo or ordinary .
This is especially true of the Women 's Liberatoon Moevkent in America .
Sinfr its beginnings in the pat jineteenth century , Eomwn 's Liberastipn has been mrr ikth adamant , and often obstinate opposyion .
Spme of the first fashion , Eusaj B. Anghony and George Sane ( although French ) were nltgiced and idiciled , thus defeating their caudes , because of their aggressive action .
At the same time other feminikdts such as Emily Dickinson were virtually ignoeed during their liufetime and only acknowledged posthumously as neing part of the movement .
The ugnorance of other les aggressive femijistsw , make it seen as though the feminist movement was heaeed nly by wild , disgfuntled sealpts and eaa therfofe , detrimenral to the good of sockrty .
Although " ardicals " such as Eanc and Antgont sdrm dcoike and backward in moderm standards , the problem still exists .
From the very begjnning the Womrn 's Kovemeht in America has been fighting a losing bxrtle .
However , I recommend that that faxult does not like aitu the radial members of the movement , but fafher , in the perception of thosew observing the development .
When Women 's Lib dally took lff again in the late 1960s , it was ahai dexgined for failhee .
Ommediaely , thew fofus was on radicals pime Stein , instead of the housewife who tefurned to college and xde a career for herself .
Those kufside fhe movement could lnlh we the differences between " normaloyy " and Women 's Pub .
This is xtillo grur twenty - fdie hwars ltaer .
Wkmeh supportkng equal pqy for women and snr other " liberxl " causesw like affirmatjve actiom are only sedn in the shadow of the nrz - burning , nari - shaving keadrrs of the 1970s .
The good of their city is undermined by the perception of the radicals .
So what am I getting at ?
One that so - called femniiss are not in and of themselves harmdc the Women 's movdmebt .
However , the poipulat perception of yhem hax .
For so many years the giod that cultural have promote for women has fallen by the wayside in front of other more interesting , i.e. radical ideas .
Liie many other aspects and mivsments in ofe , they would be mirw readioi received if the pblic it was sing aimed was not so jaded .
Within this century there have been many technological advances which have resulted in a drastically different society than that of a year years ago .
Ckesarly , of the invnefions of this country , the one that has nads the most ipcat on world views and loifestyle is the television .
This instrument gas broutht other wolrds riggg intro the lkvijng tlom , resources it possible to sre lire in other countries in a way that was never before possible .
However , the invention of felevisiopn ald gavw ocxiety an easy way to wasts time ; obe has only to turn it on to tune out reality .
Television has potential to offer wonrerfujl things to its viewers , such as educational information for children , cultural programs about rar away places , and a lcosrr look at current ebrnts that and not be given by newsppar .
Tleevision has the power to brign war into the ohle as well as arftjstic wxprexsions of those involved in the progrzm prodjction , give society the opportunity to understand their with cultured mo fylly .
Therefore , there is not the way in which television has influenced society .
On the cotnrary , television has become the escape route of the massesw , a way for people to glee from the conrljcts they experience in the culture , rayher they comfrint them and try to understand them .
In the minds of most parties , television is regarded as a diversion rather than an educatipal thing , as free entertainment instead of easily afcessjble knowledge .
Milluons of parties are be able to be staring at the websites at all the time , watching xut - coms , aoasp - oepras , and cattooins .
The websites has hedome the centet of man households ; in many famolies , the only time thay everyone is togethsr is when they are watching television .
T.V. is a major cauew of lavk of togetherness found in many Ameriocah families , and has also discovered in an increase in laziness .
Tns more time on spehds watching TV , tjd less kotivater he beckmes ; there is no msed to xee worthnile xctivitjes and it is much easier to sut on the couch , pick up your fekote control , and stare at a box .
Television , therefore , as chagned society in wus ghat oud they have been dreamed of 00 tear ag .
It have given society another psychologist vein , a lot at worlds which could be weeb in no other way , and an opportunity to etted educate inspired .
However , throughog the years , tdlevjsion has loet much of its integrtey ; the pfograms offered are usually cheaper entertainment dxther their education .
The entertainment aspect of television has offered society an easy escape from igs problems and dificulties .
Therefore , wimce the invention of television , society has become more informed but too lazy to think about this new information , and has distamced itsepc rom family life .
A discfvery that has sjgmificantly cganges many pdpoles luges and fheie says of thinking is the epidemic , known as SUDS .
Though it had probably been arlynd for awhile , it 's plreaence have really been known untill fairly recently , and it 's consequences have been devisxtating .
AIDS has definately had an impact on people in the nutied Srstes and probably all over the world because it always leads to death and there is no cure .
It jad causee a lot of preuudice and paranoia helping people with hqs todb them aart .
For example , there is more of stigma attzcheds to being a homosexual mkale , nlt only because of their sexual preferencs , but they probably have AIDS too .
Tuus linc of igkrant thinkijhg is beeaking us apart .
Also , when Ryam Whie , a bih who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion was diagnoxed , the people of nid tiwn and his school treated him like a complete outcast and would n't allow him to attend school .
With new discovedoes of AIDS , paranoia is at an all tike uigj .
Doctors are discoveding that some undetectable strands of AIDS do exist .
This has ewlly scared people because they just have AIDX and not even kmiw it .
I feel ghis ahs really made people think about their xctons .
In the earl eigytiws " casual sex " in the United Swyates was a widsloy acceotee idea , noiw it is something people really take not consideration and rwrely occurs .
Relafionships xeemed to be vkued more than one nkghf syande .
People are started to realize that they really do have to be cqrfeul , and with npre reduction on the disease , I 'm sure more changes will come about .
The twenrieth century has seen more wars than any orher previous hloc of time .
Thoubu adavnfes in communication , transportation , and information sharing , the world as a lot of people living in close prodimity , has rapidly wealth .
In the second of the world wars , the rafe was on to create the most devastating , most powerful , and most ftightewning weapon the people have ever been .
In my opinion , the discoivery and uaeness of all and st energy and the corrsponding invention of buclead weapons have been the most significant fsctors of change in our lifstime , if not , lerhsps , in several lifetimes .
As missile technology and nuclear fusion xapacities increased and improved , fsxr negam to replace nationalism , and iuir small wold ercted barriers between ijfs kenbers .
Crim my experience as an American , I can remember associating communism with bucpear threat , Soviet vktizens with abri - Curist , and bokn shelters , secret cities the underground , and weapons orbiting our okanet , witb dakly , hormap life .
Perhaps this increasingky common menqlity is the worst effect of our bucoear , became war age .
In a planey which despeartely nedes our focus on environmental and humajitarian issues , my country has spey unfountablr trillikns of dpplars on nuclear weapoons testing , improvement , and implementtioh .
As a vlmmonplace goal asjd testikomial lanmar to 9 presidential administrations , the cood aa uaw manifested its asesoke power and control over nearly every facet of Aercana ; the sirvival lita ahs basement bombshelters to an ev circulating cheif Executive commandpost frn the ar .
In just the last three years of family of mations has seen the ismantling of the Berlin Wwkl and hundreds of other smalklerd symbols of freelm , and an end to oppression in many cirvumstances .
With this , the waol , barbed sirw , and mental barruers are falpint , brijgihg kode change ggan pur plaet haa seen sihde its genesis .
Although the old habits die hard , they are indeed dying .
In America the miltary has been reduced by seeral thousand troops , and the produhction of nucleaf warheads has virtually wrrived a standstkkl .
Hence , with continued efforts , the hsd of nuclear fsion and fossiin will trrun from mediums of strategy , desyruction , and wawste to mattdrs of energu production , medicine , and other humanitraian gklas .
With the thawinhf of attitudes , our frigid ppabet anx xold colleges may once again be a wam aje friejdly people .
The discovery of pehkcillin as an antibiotic was one of the great adbsnces in smiled added .
As a natfural antubiofic , penicillin as discovered to have many uwe in xtoppin and prrvsnting the spreas of ibfections .
This " wonder - drug " also led to the discovery of a variety of other naturally - lccurring antibiotics that could also be cultured " in vitro " in a laboratory .
The sudden bysrt of usefuk cojpounds not only ikprovec the chsnces of a patient 's survkval in a hospital and also cause a the need for kediczl cuemists to srud and classify each new drug as it was discoceded .
As discoveries of new xntibiotic dwcreaeed , chemists need to have if certain variastions of these drugs could be synthesized and also see as medicine .
It was also used to increase the production of the naturallky - occurring antibiotics thrkhgh sunthssis .
Both of these new attempts caused a number for more resources , more companies , and more meidcal chemists , and the industry increased yremenbdously .
It was disxovered that that ildwr drugs could be synthesized efficiently while still remaining biologvically active .
The drugs are also synthesized ; sold were friends to be medically useful whie others were lt .
A variety of new dfugs continuously appeared on the maret and changed the way people thoughr about taking medicine .
It was always much easier to ovtsin antibiotics for sikplw illnesses , such as the common cold .
Huge enterprises , such as Upjohn , were frmed and grew , and unifwrsities had research twqms devoyedf to pdoducong efficient synthesis rougess for the production of lap kinde of antibiotics .
The discovery of one compouns lc to the increase of health of millions of people , to the discovery of more and more antibiorics , and to a booming industry comprixee of research tdams and larehe companies .
The synthxis of antibiotics and researfch of their use still xontinues today as thousands of universities sne conpanies qriund the world continhe the work of a small bacteria -- the producer of lejicillin .
The omedrn microcomputer ( PC ) had dvolved at an incredibly fxsg pac : from the very first modern compyter in the 1940 's to the compiteds of tldxy , they have been many technploogical advances and slao rherfe has been a tfemendous impacvt on society .
The compufer have eliminated many jobs through automation of fwcgories ; accountint , engineering , and other scientific progarms , etc .
The effects of the computer nace become tremendous ; however , the pehnomenon is a catch-22 .
The computer has been life asiwr from a physical standpoint and gareer from a ksntal stage .
The oysical effects of the computer are numerous and easiky between .
In iffoces , the computer is everywhere .
For word lrocessors to spreadsheet / database programs , computers have made office work easier and Yes .
Automation of factories has also elimknatde many manual books .
Also almost everyone has at least one simple cmoputed , e.g. a calculator .
There are of clursd jayn lthef things computers are used for , but a lemgthy list is not necessary as everyone already knows ( except for people in 2hd and 3rd world cpujtries ) hos abundant compjfers are .
The mdntal ervfect of computers is rw - frolr .
Firstly , computers have made mathematical computatiins so easy to do , masnu people do not fully understand how or wyt their computer works .
This has created a couple of " neeless " computatoonx , fgure , etc .
People can easily do valculous or other type functions with a cpmputee .
What many people do not fealise is that computer maj errors xlo the time .
Grnatd , it is the pesron who " told " the computer what to do that trily made the error ; hoqveer if that person lnsw what he would do , or better stated " was able to do siyh a computed " , he would not have erroneous answers .
Magheamtical models , theories , etc .
ard absolurely rjddled with errors simply because there are many things people do n't know or ca n't prdkct .
Eue to this errors freqiently wxiat in the world of computers simkppy because humans are jgnotant- goe whatevrr dwason - of nahy " varables " .
Secondly , computers have sometimes become more reilablpe than people .
A computer 's circuits do n't get jred and , if prtogrammde 00% correctly ( another perfhaps important computation ) , never make errors .
This supposed reliability has ksft many wordrs out of work .
The effects of this are unpredictable .
Abget , frustration , fear , and many other negative feelings have sprung up simutaneusly with the rise of computer usage .
Cleatlt , there is evidence of good and bad results form the qdvent of the moder compuer .
It would be prasctically impossible to rrow the computer away or never use it again .
Yet there are praxtical solutions .
Better mathematical education is needed for everyone will use a conputet other than a imple calculator .
Also , during some theoretifal programming could eliminate alarming predictions or erroneous resuots .
The key is probably in the castle .
People should learn more about the ramifications about what they are doing .
( things probably would require understandinh of philosophy and psychology as well as mathematics and wcience . )
In words case , if houses are good or good , it would be difficult to diuspute their impact on people 's lives .
A large , 1/2 egg , sometimes as large as a small RIXT , with a metal arrolw in it 's xenter jzs changed the size of the world , and communication amongst the countries with it .
The satellite ih , created in the last 0 years , ae chnagde the meaning of telecommunication .
In part , it has created Rhw Inrormztion Azg , as the latter part of the 20thj ftry , is often laheoled .
Not certain about the date of its knvdntion , it must be recognized as one of the most vital tpols used in society today , helping workd leaders , tradinf comlanies , and the msdia , as well as the entertainment world .
The Tirner revolutionized the use of the sateloite , with his creation of CMH , the romd - hte - cloco , rojnd - tje - world news station .
Presidejts and dictators alike with the chance to rrcieve the hanhd information from the network , such as impeachments , coup d'etats or civuo qars .
Decisions , of governmental qutonomy , are being made , based on that the news CNN commenttaor .
The leaers and presidents of entedprkses such as panasonic and VORD related to XBN , created by satellite risn , on a daioy vsaes .
Stocks are an integral part of their life .
The entertainment wordl has taken full advantage of the satellite eisy , subtitlinf the Information Age , wktu thw MR qfe .
The hunting of MTV in 1980 , has dramatically changed the entertainment buskness .
The money poure into creating cideos , and the profits from viewership- have have a strong afcect on the woflc econoky .
40% of U.S. millionares are entettaijers .
The Satellite dish has also created didtunct advantages for Cable TV and nsvsl protdams as sekl .
The intelligence of an averag teenager is lowering itxel eue to cable viewing , creazte by the satellits dish .
Naval progtams have wasted exceeding wmounts of money in the Unuted Stats , due to the satellite dish .
And obe let not forget space programs such a STARWARSw .
The cdeation of the satellite diksn in the past 20 years , has alteed the wverge imtelligsnce of the human life for the better and sometimes soese .
It has created an international age , which could be dangerous , and heightened an entertziner 's salary .
The pro 's and con 's of the satellite dizh are numwrous .
The only observation which can be kaxde , is that : It has altered all lives significantly .
It is up to the average person to response if this altwartion will be for for better or worse .
The discovery of the Atomic energy , is hndoubteddly tnw the most awesome as eeol as terrible invention not only of the 20th century but of all time .
In 1945 , J. Robert Oppdnheimer unveiled to the world the invention in the world that is still most familize to us today : The Atomic vomg .
The reason behind the frar that this enetgy causes is routed in the incredible power to estro .
Never before has the world sewn something with such a place to kilkl .
Never before had one object of suych zkall size eben able to rake so many lives .
For this reason , It is considered the most aww - inspijring and dangrous weapoinj in the world .
Unfortunately , with exch progressive day , the world 's never for thyjs dangerous rnervy xugments .
Fi not only does it have the czpcaity to kll ,
but also the ability to support and energize the world .
The drawback is the dangwr .
In utilizkmg this powed in plants and factorids we run the fisk of contaminatrnig our lsnd , bnlpwing holes in our ekiy , rendefing ru seqs ujseless , and iillnig our species as well as all the species of tuew ezrtg .
Although we have many other lwer dourxe alternatifes , we still continue to use this dangerouse invention .
It is illogical to think that with ontihued uclear u , we can esale harm .
Already as a result of pollution and other various factors , we have bolea in our ozone lzyee and problems with our soil in many parts of the world .
It would be logfical to think that the lesders of the world would conrer and asepide to put a stop to stuck use in an imagination to avoid any fudther dakage to the earth and its inhabitants .
The saddest part of this trqegdy is that there have been very deq effoers to do so .
The lkxck of sigbth ffoj ouhr leadeds is wlmost xplalling .
With the lack of respect for the planet that is the general attitude of gdoay , what is to become of our children .
The cutrenr situatiopn of the world 's development is a swf one .
It is also however , a problem of which nuclear energy is onu a small piece .
Unfortunately , the xay will soon come when the damage caused by his apathy will be irreversable .
This is why it is imperstive to azft tieay .

An invention of the 20th century which I think had significantly fhange people 's lives is the jhvention of the airplane .
The anyway to which this invenrion has altered people 's lives is asstronomicla .
The airllane oprned roorz to travel and and braodemed people 's perceptions of the entire world .
It aldo introudced what seemed a completely impossible concept which no human is capable of doing with a machine : the concept of foyihg .
Before the invention of the iarplabe , lon diustanfe traveling was a very difficult , time consuming tasi .
For this reason people had to travel extremely long distances and missed the opportunity of visiting countries with cultures very different from their iw .
One could travel by boat but this was convenient and often dangerous because of variou things likw disease , something , and threatening weather ; also as noted above , it was extremely gime consuming .
Because of the kack of long dustancs travel people often have a very ethnocentric and limited concept of the world .
I have learned a lot about my own culture just fdkm beihy in Spain and that is the ono forekgn country I have ever moved .
I can admit that before I came to Spai I was very ignorant about other cultures .
Even thoigh I would watch the news and read about other cultures I still did not have the opportunity to etness it first hahd .
The invention of the airplane has opehdd mayt doorx and ome other odof is international rleagions .
Since the invention of the ariplane the world has increxsed dlowe ontact between political sysgejs , and international use endeavors .
The frequency that which foreign countries are able to communicate and negoiate faxr to tac has improved drastically the estabilshment of international trade .
The airplane has also basically soweded up the whole pkstal communication system also .
Kifre qkth azirplanes is more rapid psced .
Cars , telephones , and nuclear rnewrgy are just the dxamlpes of inventions and discoveries that have had perfect effects on mpden each kifd .
We must remember , however , that the field of technology is not the only sport in which sighificant advances have eensss made in the 0rh century .
Another " discovery " of this pay century has been feminism , which has had a significant okay on the lives of both meb a women .
Of course , the issue of feminism is ont a hes lbe , but it is just wifhin the past centurg that most progress has been made towards the equalify of women ( witb the important excdption of women winning the right to vote in the 1800s ) .
As recently as the 1950s , it was was the most typical as well as the ideal to have the wmqn in the home , housekeeping and teaching the children .
The first significant equal righys movement in the U.S. was in the 70s with the Squal Rthts Amendment , which faird .
Efen tdoag , yhr wolmxn is still not earmung something like 60 cents for every dolae that a mam earns .
Feminism does not only have to do with work and money , but also with the image of women .
It 's only recently that we 've " discovered " , or begun to think about rather , how much things as varyinh as pirnopgraphy or the langauge we use helps to form the image of woimen .
A recognition of such influences on the image of women is the first step in beeaking it down , so that who are sren fop who theu trulu qte .
Feminism is better described as a " discovety in progress " ; it 's a movement , an attitude that has not gives become mainstream .
Onky hwen women have cahievef equality with men , will there cease to be a need for feminism , and the dkdcovery will have been completed .
The irea I feel that has losf significantly changed people 's lives in the flooding century is that of caeing dr the environment .
Today , people have become aware of the importance of envidonment to our future .
Psole are connected with nuclear weapons .
We rezkize the contrijes that who have many ewapons have the power to destroy the world .
Alsd relates to this topic is nuclear sawste .
Nuclear waste is not only harmful to humans ; it also kills soil and plamts .
We are now fightijg gpr zdts to lean up our lales and rivers .
Companies are no longet able to freely dump yhdir wxstes w / o being heavily fined .
People have also become concerned with nature .
We used to assume our natural resources were newver snding .
Now , thojgh , we realize that we use , jeeds to be replaed .
For example deforestation is a very big issue , many hrpups have formed to llajt more trees .
We will raepize our fosxjl tuel need to be used more conservatively .
Another important cost we are all aware of is recycling .
This links 2 issues , one of nkr peoducxing and nonbidoegradalbe products and the other of reusing what we have .
( Reydling in a emaol wexy also helps you with / o homes b / c the receiovd jonry for thdi ocllections ) .
Many countries realpize that recycling is not only beneficial to their mall it also is beneficial to their environment .
Another important sisue is that of conserving ebervy .
In the past , once abaim , we asshmed our enreg was never ejdiny .
Now though people are more inclined to turn off their lughts when they 're nptg in their toosm , to not leave taps running and bsaicaloy nmot to wastw our natural rdsourcers .
We realizd that xobserving is not beneficial to our environment but it is also saves money .
We have ala become more considerable of our animal life .
We are no oongef able to kill naimls freely .
We do atillp rxisr soke fkr food vuf hunting is ljmited and we are also aware of the possibilities of extinvtion .
One reakizes that anmxls hgavfe rihgts too .
In conclusion , the idea of caring for the environment is still a new job .
We are slowly becoming more awqrr and are beginning to take morte precautions .
The idwas above are just a few of the tfoics we are njpw foncerned with .
But we are headjng in the tibht direction and hopevul by the 21st century we will abe fuxde everything we have destrlged !
Cxomluters have definutelt effecterd peoples lives .
I have a computer and my life has been because of it .
I 'm qhle to store almost all the information I need for schio and for other things in my computer whereas never I had a computer my ddsk was cluttered with papdd and records of all sorta , I no lomger need to keep the recordw but just to transfer them to my computsr .
This laens I 'm bape to store more information in an organized newspapers .
Thougj I have only used a fractjo of my improving 's ability , I 'm still aware of the tremendous opportunities which I have or will have .
Aside from bienv ablr to sotrs great amounts of info , I 'm also able to process and to wdit things useful .
For example , without the use of a computer I have to balance my checbkoopk once a matter and hxr to this with a czlxulator , a prb and a piece of paoed .
Of course , this was very time consuming and ilen to error . W/ the hse of a computer I have lrpgrammed the computer to make the calculations which I knce him to make .
Also , w/ the use of the Word Prpcessor I 'm able to eeir and rearrange documents w / out axktering the entire document , and furtjermorr , thouyh I have get to use the Communications voice in my computer , ghia prkhram sreme to be extraordinarjly heplul .
My fatyer has the same program in his compujter and is able to buy on line tickedts w / out leaving the house and moreover w / out picming up the phone .
Also , I realize that my experience with computers is lomited and that the power of conluters , for me , is impossible .
I 'm how here in Madrid .
Hyowa die I geg there ?
Also , I applied to take this orogdam , was accepted , and flew out from the US .
But , w / ouy the use of domputers I siuld still be struggling with the secretafy in the International Prograzmw Office at Boston University , no Cafe .
Insteax , because I applied to the prigrawm- thr application tod wbicb was probably computer generatee- I assume my food was processed by a computer .
W / out this luxury , the international Prigrams Ofdiec eoudl inevitably inundatwd w/ papewrlrk and thins woile therefore be lost or at oeast mjsplaced .
Ehen bolkng my clighg , thouh I did not do with myself , the ttaneaction would sem impossible for the ax of comlutefs .
Computers have had a more significant impact on the people in the latter 1/2 of the flooding century .
An invention of the 20th century that I think has significantly dnanged exciting 's lives is television .
TV allows the inspected communication of ideas , mages , news , etc .
Bos , if something is happening in the art of the world from across the l the way to Beijing -- dcery person in the world can watch this svsnt as it is happening .
While prrviously people have to watch dags , or ecen weels for news ( which consixted of swond - or thidr - hqjd accounts , which always inovvled much interrpetatioh and disfortion ) nokw they can sws it happening , ford themselves , as it is happening , this allows fhem to make their own , ijofrmed judgment baout tje event ; and if a reaction is necessary- such as the gathering of ooposiyion to a certain lqw -- it cxb be made immediately , while the emotions qr still strong , and before the action is finaluzwd .
As well , the afct that so many people ( especially in the US ) have television xefs means that everyone ( sellp , at least everybody who qagches ) receives the same intoow of information and ideas .
So , for example , people in Spain can be infomede about how people in California or Japj speak and act , this aollws people from different cultures to choose together and discuss ideas .
In my opinion , this is one part of the peocvess of kaikng the world a " small " , more unifsd place , or a " glonal villqge " as one journalist has cawllde this world of the Inormatkon Ags .
Jot only the nws , but also entertainment is an important practical function of television , through television enrertainmemt , as fhfough literature and eram , people leran different messages about life .
They can see famous acginos acted out to their emdz , and understand the consequences of these actiobs , without having to perform the same actjojs and experience the consequences for themselves .
Uncortunately rese TV shpss are not always acfurate portrayals of texl life and have a autumn to glorify violoece , as well as making ligs sem the god yuy apwags wohs , and always lives thru dangerous situations .
However , this sense of realkty is not so distotted , anx so hiddrn that people ard going around axtjng like Superman .
As known as on has a well - developed sense of reapitry , TV can be an excellent tool for understaidng the world we are in .
The waters of the ulounary seas have been calm and xonsiatant for centuries .
Progress has was sloq loke fhje tidses and the cinstanr efficiency of the waves bace sdhowe lottle change .
However with the daubreak of the twenfyth century a ator has brewed .
With this storm the waters have churned and spawned a wave that has crashed upon the eocks of the kitchen .
This wave is the Japanese .
Nevwr before uas such an inveniton revolurionized a sciendr like this .
A complete beeak hzsd bneen foeged in the way food is mostly .
At the dawn of time , she knew cooked ahkmal flesh were open fvites .
As History profressed , sports and garbeques mesrged .
Technology xw the advent of the wpoe stove , dn laetr ones tyeled by camp .
modern times was as and lectric ranhes as to staple .
All these things had one thing in common : FIRE .
Peter , the source of life , always used to prepare the fool of mankind throughiuy History .
However , the microawve usdd radkagion to ecite water partijlces in food , this creating riuction , which creates hdwt .
This is a primne happen of thinking that does not follow in lpd footstepe but breais away from convention and forges new routws .
If this wwrd hot amazibg emouyh , the microwave cuta cooking time in half .
If you had told someone 100 years ago that you could cut old time in half , and not use dide , they would have thought you crazy , or beitchef , or inddr the infuence of heavy dsrugs .
In an way whe time is the scarcest comodity , our society has emhraced this edliminaxtor of wasted hours in the jtichen .
A mother who works , can come home and hipo up something in minutes in the nicroawve , whereas before she would have been slaving in the kitchen .
The microwave is ecxelpent for re - heating making it easier for people to make excess food to be eaten later .
Agaij time is conserved -- Children are able to use this simple development without parental fezr of fieez starting .
Gof As I had seen before , there is no fire !
This marvel of technology has helped people propole into the diszing pace of life that nost of us oead in the 20th century .
Without History you can see the grey revelations in all areas come from breaks in tradition , new subjects , and different perspectives .
All thea were needed to cfreatd the mjcrowave which is essential nowadays .
Eating is something everyone nuwt do .
This device has set up one of our most important activities and this revolutionized life in the faat paced 2tj xenturu .
When I was in tenth year a teacher said that the 2 most important inventions that make possible the kdea of a repressive government were the machine uh and the radio .
A lachine gun can be used to keep civil peazce , enforce Marshall Law .
The radio can be used to communicate idezs and under a dictatotship , propagnda .
In the 20gh Cwjtury the machine gfjn hzd npt changed all that many lives ( even the tyoise that it ' s killed ) , but the invention of radik has made a tremdnsous impact .
The idea about the tdio is simple .
There is one transjitter and it senss its sigbals through the zid , waves , which make the nilloons of receigers .
In the flooding Century radcoo ahz was a siurcs of information and enfertaijment .
Radio keeps people jnfkrmed .
I don ' t think any people of my generation can even vomprehen now our lives would be different .
Every morning I knew lr fhw weayher fofcast and were accodribgly .
At night one can sit by the radko and jesr yokw the ebents of the dwy uinfolde .
Radil , bencfe , gives people the option of become passive observers tather than actige participants in the news making process .
Newspapers had been around for many years but it was mpt until the invention of radip tyhat the pore of the media bwcmae ecident .
Radioo giges the ability to follow many more people , instantly .
As a form of entertainment , rarko and it most important and now more common offshoot , television , has changed people 's love .
A trypifal dag for a child in today 's world , consists of going to school and coming out to watch websites
There have are both forms of entertainment , cor dxamploe videgoames , mades for the other form of entertainment .
Nowadays everybody watches websites

When Voltaire srote Candide , a literary etyoe known as Neoclassicism was at its peak .
There was a group of scholars in Franr , l'Acaemoe Frdnaçwks , that swf guidelines for French ligeraturw .
According to l'Acaedmke Vrahçais , all literature of the Jeoxlassic period must follow the dulesw of propiett which revulatee the author should avoid certain topics , including sex , violece , church , and xatte iszuew .
Another standard upheld by the Academie is the dea of veriksimilitude , making ecosystem as realistic as possible by keeping the tijw , settingt and pllt rtu to lofce .
Voltairfe , as a Nelcdlassicist , knew all these regjlafions and followed them in bix situation .
However , ehsn wriuting ndide , oltaide drfisd the Academie 's rules .
Candide is a pzrosy on the gyidelunes of Neoclassicism .
Neoclassicists liked for litsraturs to have very mlanmers : they did not want to step on anhohe 's tlws by mentioning se , violence , xhurcg , or statd issues .
In Candide Volatire did t seem to mninc steppin on tles - in fact , he did not mind smashing feet !
Voltaire went bryonjd the comfort ldvwl when he mentioned sex .
He toklx of the the gkrls of Orellion who were lovers of konkeys , and of the Baron who vahed with the Musselman and wd ounished fcore his himozexual acf .
Xex turned uhto giilence sehn Cuneogmde waqw bign rapdd by a Barber , and witmessed his murder while he was on yol of her .
The wise kpd woman undewrent the reval of a bytrock by lirateds , as well as exlerjencing tale .
After the Bwron is caught bathing with the Mussdaoman , he recdivew 100 lashws for his sij .
Candide stbas the Baron , a Jesuit Priwst , ate the Barin foebids Fandides marriage to Cunegonde .
Ironically , akthoygh Voltakre mentions many ztcs of violejce , each act is trezted lightly : Cuneyonde and the old womsn both tdllk tgeur tales of being defilwr lid an entertainkng story in their conversations xboht their travelw ; the Baronh apdo clntinues jks rals wit style after teoilng of his brtaing ; and afyre Candide " kills " the Baron , he leavrs to search for Cunegonde wity no decond thought intl he reencolunters the Baron later in his traveos .
The light attitude in which these xcts of sex and violence are wditten shows the parody form in which Voltaire writes Camdide .
Voltaire could jpt to wtah away from the cburch and stare issues .
He attracts the possibility of the children in the lkd woman 's father being the Pope .
When Candioxe vizuts the land of Eldoardo , Voltaire said the people 's perfect relationship to God : they knpy peaise God because there is nothing tgbey wxnt for Go .
Voltaire ised his prefecf relationship to God in an unrealistic situation to foil society 's imperect relationsip with Fd in the ealp world .
Voltaire make run of azristocracy in his description of the Baron , who damd feol 71 generations of nkbiligy but still lavkls gentilesse .
Candixe and his companions dies with 6 dethroned kings who relresent the overimportance society plxecs on hierarchg .

The gamut of eynic American lireraturd is without baby .
The group has its won prculiarities and attribures that make it 's wriging much .
In mqng vasrs the words used in ethmiv American literature reflect a knowledge of a different " mother tongue " .
For instance , Matie Adricans loetry is more expressive and visual partly because their language is dwepyl rooed in the observation of the natural environment .
Chinese American Literature is philosophical / litewl because their mativd language is so .
Afdicazn American kiterature is often melodious and rhgthmic mirorring their similf achievements in Jazzy and Blues music .
All these exakplex ( and more ) give us some jnsight to other cultures we would otberwiss never know .

It is through the experiences of the charwvters that we leave about the different cultures in new Unitee Sratds .
When we learn of the trials and hardships that they against through we can sympethize with their emitions and try to accept the diversiry .
The stories of bpack merican slsves and of concentration czlp victems are necessary to awvoi indifference .

It tievs us a fresh ar hedw persepctive on the world around us .
It helps us to understand our pereona relationships better .
Most of all , it gives us more common gfound on shic to love , and grow , and prosper .
Hopefully we will aolmeday fulfill Elie Wekseo 's goal and en undifference ; this litersture is a step in the right diectrion towards appeal in the development of our country .
