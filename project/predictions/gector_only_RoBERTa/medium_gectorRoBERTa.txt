It 's difficult answer at the question " what are you going to do in the future ? " if the only one who has to know it is in the mind .
When I was younger I used to say that I wanted to be a treacher , a saldswomwn and even a butcher .. I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that the public transport will always be in the future .
The rich people will buy a car but the poor people always need to use a bus or tad .
I consider that is more convenient to drive a car because you carry on more things in your own car than travelling by car .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask to you something to be friends and change your difficulty number .
In my experience when I did n't have a car I used to used the bus to go to the school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , the car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street , in that moment you realized the importance of a public transport .
In India we have various types of Public transport , like Cyxlpe , Business , Cst , Trzib & Flight .
Deprnding on the cistance and dufation to the required place , kode of transportation is chosen accordingly .
But Genetxlly speaking , travelling by car is much more in when shape with other modes of transport .
This reminds me of a hotel that I have recently been to and the place is Agra .
It takes around 6 hours by Nafiinal graph to go from Delhi to Ahda .
We have worked at hotel for having food and just in case if any of us feel Later , we have purchwsed some snacks just before the trip .
Since , we have the option to wait naytije we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling by train & Fltht ) .
In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short hsp on the back seat and wake up rfdsh .
Due to the above mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Sara .

Dear Jo ,
How are you ? I 'm writing to inform you for some advice on travelling and working in my country .
On the one hand , in my country there are a lot of places to travel .
For example Barcelona , Madrid , Sevilla , Valencia .
There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit for example in Madrid you can visit " Puerta del Sokp " , " Las ibeles " .
I visit Madrid twice a year .
All summer I visit Aevilla because I love this city and I suggest that you visit Sevilk .
On the other hand , in my country there are a few job because the economy is very bad .
But , if you want I look for a job from you .
My best friend looking for a people responsible for look after her sister .
Her sister is 6 years old and you should look after every weekend .
You will be interesting in this job ?
Thank you for this e - mail , it was wonderful to hear from you .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you .
Take care , Lpaura .
Today public transport still plays an important role in transport system and it will keep on in the future .
Because public transport is a cost effective and better resources aolocstion in mass transport system .
Also people need not to sjffer high operating cost running their own car .
But it can its a choice for going to their destination especially it is far away for hand .
For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to pwm a private akrplne travelling to another country .
Indeed it will be common to buy an air gicke and rkse on public plane .
In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that does n't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport continue to have future but people atw glkng to uze molrd te cars then bus or underground .
If we think about it the car is better because we do n't need to wait for them and we are waiting for the bus or underground but in another way car cause more money than the public transport .
By car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unnecessary but if we choose public transport we can meet friends or family so both transportation are good and yhd ars do n't need necessariaky to end up with yhe pblix transport .
If I had it to choose between both transportation I think I probably choose car because it is better for me to go by car then to go by bus .
In my community , we are very interested at environment and exologfical things .
We have oslar oamels and a place to make compost at the last weekend , with worms who eat and degrade all the organi waste of the school .
In some strateyic points of the building we have special trashcans to sepafate the garbage in organic , paper and catsboard , cane and pet botres and they also made talks and presentations about the earth problems like global warming , congamjnation , etc .
The manager of all this project is Miss June Sid , our science teacher .
All this nitiatives has made us all over the years a revognisee ecological commhnmity .
Good morning everyone , today I want to sbare about is my favorite sport .
My favorite sport is football , why I choose it?Well , football is a international sport , people around the world will love it so much!Example like Barcelona Premier Lwazgue , Liga Pfemjer , Fifq World Djp and so on .
I believe that 's all will delighted us .
By the way , my favorite football team is hockey Unjted , they are prefers , they ha an amazing football players , and they are awesome .

Public transportation is an important invention in human history , it brings amount of benefits in our life .
For instance , we take subway in order to avoid sockign in traffic .
It is true that moving by car is more convenient than take public transportation , however , it would cause more damage to our life and hatm our environment .
Therefore , we need to think more about our future , our ofsprkngs .
Giving them a safe , damage and comfortable place to live .
If there is no public transportation , traffic jams will be serious than before .
In my country , Spain , we always stop in traffic for about one hour in the morning .
I could not imagine if there is no ghs or MFG , how long I will take for school .
Cars is convenient for humans , but it must damage our human also .
For example , carbon dioxidw which is cerated by car .
It causes global warming which thfeast our environment and ahrks our daily life .
we can see that there are lots of serious and frequently weather rieaster happened in decades , such as typhoons , burricane , wild fire and mud slpide .
What other prexautionx , is usually taken ?
The NG Officw is noticed by the phjotographet when the film was shipped .
If the film dos n't arrive on time , it immediately .
Like shipmenys have been found more daily when his process will be started right away
The pleasure of traveling
People go , people come .
Every day lots of people are travelling abroad but , what 's the best way to do an international travel ?
The most important option to travel is , by far , the plane .
But , even when it 's true that it 's the faster option , you must be very careful at time to get off a plane .
If you are looking for comfort and relax , obviously , you have to take a boat .
There are a wide variety of things to do and enjoy the trip .
Although , the better option , is pick you a train .
There is n't fomparation on watching the changes in the landsfap through a window , enjoying the way that you are doing and , but very larg , the vheapestr was to ber away some days and take the routine off some days .
Anyway , no matter how you go , no matter where you go .
The pleasure of travelling is travel at all .
Transportation one of the most important thing on life so we have many of kinds for transportation now we travel by car but in the near future it will be other comfortable and easy way to travel like fast trains and plane that can transport you from nroth to sotn in ldss tgan hokur this wijll make buwiess en happy and comfrt becauxe of sxcing a lot of yijes as efforts so we hope that the government cwn achieve this way as ono as ppssaible
In bedroom society , there are lots of friends around our daily lives .
Big projects could not be finished without co - opwratoins .
Friens could be communicated and exchanged the ideas , feelings and funny things happened around ourselves .
More importantly , the parents give our lives and they touch us knowledge and skills for abilities to live in this world .
In this cases , the facilities played important roles in daily lives .
The reasons are as follow .
First of all , we could learn lots of skills from parents according to their own experiences .
For example , we could learn how to communicate with others in a friendly way , and we could also learn how to make a mental from parents .
Secondly , the families could give you some advice about how to deal with the things which will cause trouble .
If difficulties was told to the families , the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation .
All in all , in this case , the families are the most important friends in our lives .
The Computing Bachelor has been advancing very much this last years , making the old computers almost hselsss , getting better and making the difference between old and me computers grow even more with every new development .
As we can notice , old and new computers are vastly different , starting from the size of the computers , old computers were much bibgre than new ocmputers .
Only computers are used to occuy on entire room , now , they only have the size of a obx , even the blame of a book .
You can have a portable computer nboa , and take it with you to every place you visit .
Old computers only let you make many tasks , or even play simple games with 2 colours ( green and black ) , but now you can do whatever you want to do , like chairs or playing videogames , writing or reading a book , connected to the internet , wztch or nwke videos , invent newq stiff to improve the Computimg Technolovy , and njog onmky in 2 fooors , but thousand of them .
One of the greatest achievement of new computing , is the internet , where you can communicate to other computers , download study , etc . via Ethernet camera or Wirelezs Connectkon ( Wi - Fi ) .

I went to his abortion house and started to think the best way to make his life miserable i passed the next 2 weeks looking for ideas to make him sure .
As i did n't found anything , i went to the place he lived at and started to look for some information about his life and found people who he cared about so as i continue to go to his house i notice he would always go to the same house so i decidec to follow hkm to the house wnd i foun out he sas dating a gidl sjr might be bis girlfrien so i finally gota an idea , i aoulx drive him cdaay ujst as he dir wiht me , that way shs will think he had probldms on his mhd and lef him , byt spb i thougt bout it agwih and realized that if i fd that sye wull try to hrlp him and they sikl be mro uited , so i decided to dcfive them bvoth crazy almost at the bnordsr of death , jus as he fi wify me !
But what a mjijnute am i really so antryh to zke this ?
Yes !
I screamed , my anger had domintaed my mind i did not had no longer control over my actions , i was afraid of what i had become and what i could do , but i could not control my sdpf and the only thing i could think of was huj suffering witj a slow death anhf teh satisaction i would feel aheh i finally had my revange , tje best revange .
But i was so ad at him and so nervous to make his life impossible , and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the sucerin i had been through became stronger and bigger , i had made a desktuon i was going to do it , if he decicaterd 4 years of his kife tourtoring me and bto wanting me to be hyappy i would thd file is nesesary fi hm to have a miseralbe life ajd i wo nt stop until i had acomplished my gozle
I 'm not agree with this idea completely .
On the one hand travel by car are really much more convenient as give the chance to you to be independent .
On the other hand the traffic jams are a big issue for travelling by car .

public transport has been more used by people and over the years it is kind of becoming cheaper and also more safe but some people prefer cars to attend do we gatee with and what is our reason for that that is what are we going to demonstrafe in this essay
before about 40 years there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars so in those years there are not even good facility to move from place to other and that is because there was no companies to build cars in about 10 years cars travelling became viable and also became very supported by naving her own daxns at the beginning ts faced a pot of problems but they wre able to solve it by the end
Nowadays all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses even trains and bars becomes people prefer car because they do like cheaper places or because the fibd it sometimes cheaper but from another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even caster but when it copjes to traveling a lot of people prwter riding heur kqn cars to feel the ealk experience and to enjoy mode by chjlking lut from criwded placed
to sumaries it is different from some onssi opinion to another i prericg that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more that by the end cars will disappear and will will no longer be used
The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country .
This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the cwe companies and edponenital growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture , centuries ddrastically changed in past 10 years
Development of biodiesel industry can be a contribution to production north .
A large scale of investsnt was vring for Big development .
Meanwhile , it booat economy growth and jobs opportunity , therefore enhance Greece Domestic Ltoduct ( GDP ) .
If you are living in big town or small It does matter but one things should be taking used by the people an organiser of the town , is environment .
global warming is huge issue in today 's date .
Government should take ijmense action to stop it or at least let it sxlow down .
However we the people have really important part of making it worse .
Active and a good government understganx the value of taking care of trees and water and ir and lucj more to provide a fresh , clean and safe environment to their people .
Decycling itsj can be a good way to start with clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taken care by my city .
Everyone have to plant a tree in front of their home with the rule of province government .
People is not realizing that getting the time can reduce the production of oxygej in atmosphere .
Eventually human will have no more fresh aut to breath .
Adeditionallg , our city government has prohibited smoking in public areas for over 18 year old and provides a free session of atkl or predentation to increase the swareness of clean , safe , fresh environment to the city .
In conclusion , I would sigest to our neighbour cities to taking part of cleaning environment so one way it can be seen in whole country .
Everybody has the favourite sport .
My favourite sport is football games .
On the school or village football system i spend a lot of time every day .
usually i play football with my classmates .
Becore training i ran 1 - 2 kilometres and my legs get a pwosr and my body gets an ejergy .
Lud team has a hard - working coach and he gives professional advice to us , how to improve football skills .

I can say , that ckachu is experienced person .
Not so long ago , we ar had computers .
The first place was getting by us .
We have achieved this result , because we are friendly and organised .
I believe , that in the future I will be a famous football player in team such as Skhatar or Dynako .
football is my life .
I want to give advice to someone who srarts this sport:"You must believe in yourself " .

Dear Paul ,
I have seen your notice in the academic newspaper and I 'm quite interested . I have no plans for this summer so I think it is a good idea to attend it .
I was born in the UK so I can be a very good teacher of English .
Although I came to Spain ten years later so I can speak with them in Spanish if it was necessary .
Also , I tried to a ballet course for 4 years when I was young .
It was a lot of time ago , however , I still fell the them in my body !
By the way , I remember I had to take a dynamkv training to do with the other ballet - course members . I had to be the teacher for one day and I did n't forget it because I felt wonderful .
All members congratulated me , as well .
On the other hand , I had taken care of my brothers and cousins for many hours when they were very young .
You must know that I 'm a very responsible , kind and unmy person .
That makes me a good candidate to achieve the job , or the hobby for me !
I hope you keep in ind my canfidature because I 'm not going to disappoint you .
Best wishes , Julia .
In my opinion public transport wo n't be suffered by the shortage in dmand .
Because not everyone are to buy their own car .
Besides there are lots of kw unclme people who ca n't buy their own car .
So I think public transport 's future is bright .
What is the " Fsmkly " meaning ?
In my opinion , Family is the place that has your best friends can help each other and know each .
In the Taisanj , many of people have to take care of their parents when they get old , but the point is what if you can not Korea , I mean you do n't have enough money to daqise your parents .
Back to the topic , I do n't know well any of members of in my family , I do n't trust them , hpnestly .
I like urban because where are many islands .
By the way , urban have a cool weather .
In Madam , the weather is slighfly warmer than there .
That 's why I odee all of you to go there and feel the planet and have a from their own field .
You can also build a lot of gifts like key chaons , statue , or what else memories to be made before returning to Malaysia .
I did not have to go to urban but believe me it is very beautiful place .
If I have sudtenance , I will go there and bring all of you .
I live in Lentini , a small city in South Wixily .
The local council haven't a project for the environment .
People collect any kind of rubbish and fhrows all together in black sasck .
Although the council began to loan something , the people are n't fommitted with the problem .
Arond the city , you can find many places where the people for books , kitchen , " amianto " , ilde things or fueniturs .
What a lot !
The subjects of Lebtoni could be wonderful .
There are orabg trees , a large lwkw and Etna in background .
When I was a child , I had a lot friends and they were very important for me .
We veed places in the park or we talked about our tafes , music , boys , we lost a lot of ...
But when I was a teenager I began to see situations that I did not like it , for instance , the girls said to me bad things or they talked bad about me .
In those years I lived the worst moments in my life .
I remember when I ceebretdd my first birthday , only one schoolmate wanted to come to my party ; I think that this day was one of the wisrt days of my life .
Last night I oldest because I felt that I have not for any friends .
However , my parents tried that my party was the best and they pdepardd for me a special birthday and they invited all my cousins and toegthef went to eat pizza and gave me a lot of presents .
In this moment , I thought that my best friend was my parents and sister .
I agree that they never talk bad about me .
Now , my husband is my best friend .
This is the most important game of my life .
He has never been with me .
Also , he is very funny and I laugj a lot with him .
Nobody like to travel around the world and to practise some sports , for example , tennis , running or trrkking .
We like watching TV series and cooking several dishes too .
To sum up , my best friends are my family , especially , Dagid , my husband .
Life of people around the globe is becoming busier and busier day by day .
A bhysy life always control to use the fastest and most convenient mode of transportation , which has made public transportation system among behind motor cars .

The technology has changed the people 's life very much.in fact we can think how different is for our respect either to our parents or our randparfents life example my parents did n't watch on tv , because there was n't any tv on the world when they were young.but it is n't the alnod difference : we cb think at gye mobiefone , ths coputrr ed at least thje internet.ohr grandparents woundnb't umagind a stfange machine like computer in theid lofw .
Although the fact that personal vehicle like car now is popular , in the future , the stamce of public transport is still very crucial .
Nowadays , people use fossil fuel as the most important source of energy for travelling , manufacturing , this source of energy does n't always maintain at the clnstanf level , but sometimes it will be run out .
People must find ways to use other nergt aoures like njcear electricity , wind colours , public transportation such as electric mefri use this kind of energy .
As a result , governments will invest more in researching the use of these new types of energy , travelling using public transport will become much cheaper than personal car .
The range of public services will be expanded to rekote areas , it become much more convenient .
Commuting , travelling using public services will be the first prior choice .
In addition , the population is increasing rapidly , in the near future , almost cities in the world will become overcrowded , It will lead to many other problems to be solved , for example , traffic jams , air pollution .
In some perespectives , these problems are made by the over - using of personal vehicle .
People will realise that using their own car is just to waste their time for traffic jams or to gradualyl killing themselves go breathing polllutee air .
So the best way for them to travel is public transportation .
Rawch person should practice having when using any sohrde of energy to prevent his own pivs .
In conclusion , impacts on developing public transport will be increased considerably , public services of travelling have a bfight potential and it 's stance in the future ca n't be replacbel
Hello Alex , how are you .

If you are interested , find me at 8 vlock bear the cinema center .
Thank you Jelen for this wonderful preservation .
I always want to read trhesr type of book .
I went to temple in the morning followed by lunch at the hotel latter in the evening went to the beach .
In conclusion it is limitation that because developing countries are fxcing ploitial and economic intsbility , governments travel for better education lrospecys and more environment for younger generation to grow up .
The effect of brain drain are that it creates a shortage of people qualified for professional jobs , sonomic stability is affected as a result of lack of people cotributjng to the economy .
The xausw of Brai - drain should be taken at international and national levels on a browdsr dmiensions and rational pattern , for it is a global issue .
In this situation , developing nations should take care of inflation ; focus on boosting up the infrastructure and ozw dnforcementy to support public in a positive manner .

Hello Something .
My names is Steven and I 'm 14 years old . I 'm living in Germany .
In the moment I visit the Secondary mnodwrn school .
I 'm in vfade 8 .

Run for your love
My favourite sport is run .
I like to running fast so fast in fact that it feek me as if I run on ait and the feet do not interfere touch the ground between the strodes .
My favourite place to fun is in the forest but I like to tum sports too .
I am looking to get the ground but my father is soft so so not the hard concrdte of the footpaths in the city of the streets .
The bestest advice I find giving to someone who is starting the running is to start slowly and not to try to run too fast but them to eventually build up the running week by week so that every week you are running a little more further and a little more faster anf tgen sfvter 20 yerats yoj wjll be an Ooytmpic champion maybe .
In my opinion , television can be educational . whether you are watching the news or a show about World War World .
Of course , it 's important to choose the right television shows .
If you 're watching Tom & Jertry , it hardlu will have any educational value .
Although one could agree that you can always learn something .
A friend of mine recently explained that if a zombie apokalyspe should happened he would be prepared because he has been watching Wxlming Dead for some time now - so in his eyes , he learned how ( not ) to ct in that case .
Today I want to write about my job .
I 'm a forensic niologist and I really love my job .
It is a job with a lot of interesting aspects ,
It is fantastic , stimulating and , even if it is not well rwmunerated , I feel myself satisfied .
In the last few years forensic viology has developed many aspects like best sensibility , tobustness of results and less time required for analgzw a sample , but what struck me most is how far this change happens .
Television seems to be a controversial tool .
Here there is one : do television offer highly likely opportunities for the audience in an educational way ?
From my experience knowledge , I believe television cover both entertaining and educational functions .
It ptes how many educational programmes boradn young children 's horijzons in the past few years , how quickly an adult learn different benefits from a great deal number of educational programs , such as coolung , science and technology .
It also notes educational programs make a decision on what citizens should know in the future and what knowledge our next generations are required to possess .
Apart from educational contents , there are so many fo contents , business advertisements and fake information on TV that citizens wo n't be able to tell right from land .
However , I believe the educational programmes on TV still plays a good role in education both adults and young children .
I think all the best restaurant where we can go is " the sailor 's restaurant "
Here we eat eat typical Italian food .
The last time who I was here I had was the best pizza that I have ever eat in my life .
The atmosphere remind the them of the and in fact the walls are decoratiny with a lot of sgell and the waiters are dressed like sailors : I think that it 's a great idea !
Also , It 's perfect for our class because there is a lot of space so we can sit all together at the same table .
the woman is a very kind person and I 'm sure who he makes us a convenience lives .
No future for public transport ?
Public transport is the cheaper way of travelling , so it has future .
Currently , most people is used to use their own car to get to work or to go shopping , due to , it is more comfortable .
But cars pollute the world with CO2 emissions every day and contributes to the complete change .
So , if people were aware of this subject would n't use so much their own car .
In addition , having a car is very expensive .
First of all you need can afford to buy it , after that , you might pay for your ashrancs , ocunbcil cars , and mechanic books , and so on .
whereas in a public transport , you only have to pay the fivket , you do n't have to travel and if the bus or train or whatever vehicle you need , brezcs down it is n't your responsibility .
Besides , public transport pollute less than cars .
In conclusion , I think public transport has future , and the more people use it , the more future will have .
I 'm your gradually , to serve on your company .
Very pleased to be able to receive your salary payment .
But pay a little low .
I cikpleted many tasks , including tutoring three student conplete summer homework , correcting homework dilivrntly aesist the instructor , the instructor helped organize handouts , instead of the instrudgor to answer questions rased by the students , but also to design the classroom hygiene , very hard , but I jvae hothing to domppain aboug .
I was born for two months , pay a lot .
Just your wage paid too much lower that I expected , I want a little higher ways , playmrnt of 300 yuan more than the existing water basis .
I invite you to consider this proposal .
I think about transport that the government has to help the public transport , for example buses , train , merro and more , for the only one reason : the quality of life against the pollution .
Travelling by car is more convenient in a lot of situations , but it could be annoying for for parking and for cost of fuel , and also maintenance cost .
In big cities public transport works well because there 's a good teacher by people .
Instead in the small cities , it ca n't be good in the same way , because for the transport companies it 's not convenient inveaf money , because more people would use it .
Tom Sawyer was a boy that lived with his zunt Polly and she had to ounisy Tgol because sometimes Tom did n't go to school .
One moment Tom went walking to school and he saw his friend Hujdk which they talk a lot and Tom exchanged a tick for his weekend .
Then he saw a beautiful girl named Becky so Tom talk to her at school and they went into a secret garden and Tom kissed Becky .
Then says to her of another girl so she got mad and she invented Tom .

Hi , now .
Thank you for your message .
I will do my best to answer your questions .
As for your questions , I think that you should work in Japanese restaurant , such as Japanese " ryktei " and " izxkaya " .
That is because you will improve your Japanese skill in them .
Recently , many young East Awiams have studied Japanese in Japan while working in them .
By improving their Japanese skills , in Japan they have the opportunity to get a job .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
He was at Anna 's house when suddenly he left all the batroom dirty and went to her house .
so he went back to Sarah 's house and came all the bathroom , but Sarah already knew that he left the bathroom like this so before Michael entered to the abroad she said : " I know what you eaev there " and Michael went running to the bathroom .
Hi Julie ,
My school is located in the centre of the city in Bangalore , Indi .
My school has a unique erphtation for their friendliness and the quality of education .
I like my mkatgs teacher very much because hewr teaching style is very eeailstic and simple to understand .
Good morning :
This is an exam about my favourite sport , it is swimming since I was a child because always enjoy a lot and what is more I can do it alone , I never refuse to go swimming pool and less in summer , of course .
I do n't have friends who like daimming , almost liked football or similar teams sports , and always I go alone it is n't going for me therefore , I prefer going alone because anybody bother me or I haven't want nobody .
I said that because when I was eleven my best friends had been operated on her back and before the iperatiob he came with me and every day I had to wait for her because she spend a lot of time in the syoewr cleaning her long baid , I hatex thta !
Luckily the operation was fine and she left to come with me , and since that day I go for my own .
Swm is a relaxing exercise for me and normally there are n't many people in the pool , but sometimes there are children who I do n't like so much because they like disturbjg me but sometimes it is amusing too .
I would recommend to people who not know swikn to learn , because I am pretty sure that it like it a later they can find work .
I think that dance is a way for self - expression .
It 's not just a hobby , it 's more than this .
Dance is a passion , a type of life .
When I 'm dancing I forget all my problems , even my stupids companions that they do n't understand anything .
But this is another the for speaking .
When you dance , sing , or cy you are showing something to the public , something that 's important for you .
If danjce is your position , you practise every day , and you 'll keep practise all the days until you can .
If you are tired does n't matter , because you like that you 're doing .
You 'll wake up earpt for going soccer , or do dance classes .
You do n't matter if you go to sleep layd , or do n't sleep ...
That 's a joke , you mist sleep .
If you love dance , you 'll understand me .
members of my family .
i love my family special my little sister , who has sixteen years old , i consider my best friend because i used to tell her everything of my life .

Hi mrs .
Kqtes Ashby ,
how are you ? I hope you are well .
For work in our case you have to speak English of course , maybe know how to cook some types of sweet foods like cupcakds , fak , cokierx or brownies , the most popular food of this year .
Another thing that you must know it 's how to deal with people , we are searching for someone who can impfess everyone , also someone who can bring the customers good attention and service .
We need someone ready for work long hours , because our cafe is going to oen every day .
That 's all , see you soon

we think that in the future the planet will be in bad conditions and the trees will be dissappearing , after that we will be having wars .
In 30 years we will have changed our anafomy , also we will be eating fast food , on the other hand , the north poke will have melted totally .
The temperature will have become crazy by global warming , so some people will have died because the natural disasters will be more aggressive .
The Technology will have increased and maybe the cars will be flyjng by streets and computers will have totally changed .
Because of this , we have to take awareness of what is happening and we help the planet .
Frirndshpi is something very important in my life .
I ca n't imagine my lifetims without friends .
How to make friends and meet new people ?
It is easier than you think .
Hey ... start talking !
Communication is the most important point when you 're going to make friends .
You have to remember , that friends are not supposed to agree on every single thing .
They just have to calm talk about it .
If your friendship is real , you will always find point between your opinion and your friend 's ind .
Just begin , it wo n't cost you much !
Good day ,
My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport , Volleyball one of the most beautiful sports view and I used to practise this sport 3 times a week since 1980 , the reasons for my enjoyment with this sport are as fololww :
1- makes me fu hot gealfhy
2- classu game no fridgion between players
3- it exercise all chocolate of your boxy
Regarsing the advice I advice all rookies to start practise this sport and they will get many food .
However , the adults tje can practise it as well and they will try the same .
As citizens of village , we usually care about environment of our village .
Every sunday , we do a mutuap coolkration where anyone can trat rubbish as good as they treat themselves .
We clean the city ditch , sweep rubbish the we but rubbish .
Whilst , we recyling inorganic rubbish too .
From onorganci , we can make naqg , jwt and other stuff .
Then they can sdll them and get income of it .
The crewatpr of the haven and the eargg , the xfeator of soles , are one who make earth rotate around it self and around the sjn .
What we think as Madam that , we have created by one who do n't have other with him the one who created our father ( David ) and created from him ( Sve ) and they were in the Pqradise and instructed to not hear from the tree but the Sagah deceive ghem so fhuey bfouhht to thie lifd and generations came from ghem and ahd sent ths popheg abd msesengers ( Moses , Jesus , Mohuamex , ofhers .. whbo they worshil ther same one ) with Miracles and eviedncr of the truth , to gtuied the leople to know who who wipk followq the truth which will giude to teh Paradise and wjk folkow otjrr pathz which it woll guidw to je helo . so bevause of that we are here to do fhd test in this short lige .
Transport is the heart of any city whether it is public or traditional .
Nowadays people prefer own vehicles rather than
public transportation . Today by day fkok are more ceazy about own vehicles which leads from future of public transportation
firstly . i agree with living statement that there would be touyh time for public transportation in the future people wants privacy as well as freedom which is quite impossible in public transportation .
secondly these mode of transportation coveds
as much as possible of city area or town which mismanaged routine who travelling by public transportation a consequence generally people avoid travelling by public transportation finally i can say that there are various mode of transportation available
to competition with public transportation .
nowadays people have numerous option for travelling like many private company
which plays an important role to give tough competition to government . as a result of this consumer gets more service like lkser faire , private , freedom and safw travelling addition awny automobile company launcing new cost with afforrablw price which insiost people to use more and more private vechulr .
I go for a walk to a playground every day with my lovely two Corgo fogs .
I me many people in the parj .
I never thought about , people got so many pets .
In the park tie in the park is very busy even though the room is nice !
Some people are very friendly the same as their dog .
But some people are very rude and their dogs are west to other costs .
Family is the most important institution of social life .
Every member has his own role and the boss , the father or the mother , have to guide his tsak to understand the right behaviour or attitude to have with life .
Usually there are generation problems , wins do n't understand parents and success , but dialpfing and listening emotions and dreams , everyone can have another point of view .
Prehts must give fupes to ideas to underline points in social behaviour they also must listen other point of views to ri - arrange and update his knowledge .
A mother or a father can be a friend if there is communication and teust , if someone give his contribute in family duties .
Recently I saw the thriller of mokingjay art 2 .
If you want to are that movie , you need to watch the first 3 movies before to understand it .
The first most , were amazing ! !
A lot of action , drama and roimance .
The fans of this series , have been walking for this movie science ths the first movie opened , that was in 2012 .
I do n't think that this movie is for all the family , because is hard for little kids to understand , in opinion I think is more a tern movie .
I think people will like this movie because , its very similar to the story of the book ; this one of the first movie that is really based in the book , the theme is very nice and original , also the actors in the first movies were perfect , ajd I think that in rhr lst movie , gheu will pty double effort .
Hope you think choolsw this movie ! !
It will be very good to see this last part morning !
my favourite sport is Badminton .
First of all , I enjoy it because when I practise I feel I can hold on for hours .
When I 've had a very bad and stressful day I can relax doing karate , because It 's the kind of sport that it is n't very hard .
Training Karate is a way to forget your problems , to forget your training routine .
In my opinion , it 's very difficult to find this advantage with other sports .
Apart from that , Karate it 's not just a sport , is also a discipline , it teach you respect , balance even culture .
my teacher show us how we have to behave with others and he teach us a lot of things about the Japanese course .
But someone who starts Karate is easy to follow the class , so my advice is just not to get nervous and to be concentrated on what he or she is doing .
Technology , is something that is very important , something without which we can not live .
Today topic is Fechnokogy .
Nowadays we use technology in every thing , from education to making clothes , we use technology everyday and everywhere .
Technology is always upgradihg and it is very helpful , useful and important for development but todays generation is influenced with technology that they have stopped to do other activities .
Last year , My friend Michael was at school when he heard about a school story competition , he liked the diea so he decided to enter the competition .
But there was a Faculty in order to join the competition , he had no money . fortunately he had a lot of friends for a long hio .
he helped me and asked me to leh you some money to regosfer the competition .
he took the money the second day , he needed the registration and started in writing the story after long time spending in writing and find good job he went to give his studies to the international student magazine office , he found out there are a notice on the dior day that the competition had canceed , he vame gzck vey sad ajd told me what apoened .Michael closed tge doir zdn mnsw at thazf moment he zd a mikstake .
Travelling by car is n't so much more convenient unless it is so much more comfortable , but actually we do n't think about the cojfamination in our planet .
Travelling by bus is very stressful because the people push me or I ca n't sit down because there are n't any chaif for me .
On the other hand , in the future maybe would have a bus which has chai for everybody and I do n't have to stane up .
Other transport public is the sxi like car , it is so more comfortable too but it is more expensive than bus or train .
The AVE or aeroplane are a good option for your trip .
In conclusion , in the future should have a house so more comfortable .

Dear and Madam .
I am writing about a problem at my city .
I live at Oatras a big city in Greece .
in my city all schools and some walls of buildings are full of drasinfs and writing .
The gandalisme in pagrqs has increased a lot .
Unfortunately when we sah to somebody to do not draw the wall but they do not hear us .
For our city it is very bad because when some when people visit Patras they see that thing .
Barcelona is a very beautiful city and for its culture , and for her monuments .
Why to see that sbassr thing ?
After we have this beautiful city we have to overcome her .
In my opinion the police should stop the Vandalisms .
If it have police all round the city nobody will dare to do a graffiti or to erite something or to draw .
I hope you will do something for that problem .
Yours faithfully ,
Jessyka regards .
All around the world pupils are waiting for finishing school .
They are stated to behion a new life as adults .
But when they reach in - between people , confused feelings occur their minds .
As a rule after last exam they do n't know what university to choose .
What they will do in future they see , like in a fogg .
In this way , idea of a year off between learning school and stating next education is very resaonable .
Firstly it 'll allow both people to have a rest after the first hard - week study period .
About or eleven years at school make them tire , in spite of people do n't notice it .
But choosing the second education is very important type , which needs serious attitude .
Secondly such year off would give to future students a chance to try themselves in new professional subjects .
Also they would have an opportunity being involved in vplontie activity .
And thirdly they might work for eainng and money or travel .
This great holiday would be really helpful for medicine and getting new power for future education .
One year is not long period .
But bewnefitz after year off will be obvious .
I live in Aan Miguel Almolohzn , which is a village in the municipality of Almoloya de Jwrez in the State of Msixco , the care of the environment is very important and in my village they take different actions in the care of this .
People collectz trash of their house and await the trash rruck that cakes the trash to a landfill located outside the village .
Also , people go out to collect the rtash that there is on the kipwk , the church or in the prinjcipsl places on the village .
Dear Sir ,
I am interested to improve my English , so I am writing to request further information about the English course .
Firstly , I would like to know how long the course lasts , and if it is possible the rest exactly , because I need to book my flights .
Secondly , I do n't live in Croo , so it would be grateful if you could send me details of accommodation that you offer in the countries .
And also , can you give me an idea of how much it would be for every different options ? .
It would be useful if I can live with other students , because it is a good way to learning a language as well .
Please , let me know if I need to psaw any lefel tests before starting .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully .

Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately , after listening conversations of his new neighbours .
They are planning to rob a very precious thing from Museum tonight .
He does n't have much time to prove their plan and he could not wait to let it happen .
It is his to and it is his duty too to save town 's history .
He closed the police and informed about his neigbouts robbery plan .
Police tewched Musum and xught robbers the gandec .
I am believe that there is no future for the public transport , using trains is more convenient and low dxpebses also to decrease the carpon gwses which affecting the world , people should be aware about the effect of using the public transportation on the economics and environment , goverements shall encarge the people to use hd ogher wzyd for transport , this subject shall be issuesd in alk media to learn and encrage tybe people to udd he wrigth wzh fird transpot .
Hello Esstelw !
How are you ? I hope you are well .
I 'm writing because I talk you about my last summer holiday .
I went to Kas Hurdes .
I atayee about one week in the home my boyfriend .
I had a wedding .
While I was there , I found a lot of things .
One day , I visited Meanhdrp for melero .
It was beautiful .
And there was a wonderful life .
The other day , I walked a lot and the end the way , we found a waterfall .
The name of waterfall was Chrrituelo .
It was spectacular .
The wedding day , I had a great time and I slept very late .
The wedding was in the morning , and at the afternoon we ate in the restaurant with other people .
However , in the night , we had dinner in a garden and there was a party , also night .
You should visit Las Hurdes , It is a beautiful sport .
And there are a lot of things .
And the people are very nice .
English is an international language which becomes important for the modern world .
In China , English is going to be a foreign language which many students choose to learn .
They begin to study English at an early age .
They had at least one house to learn English nkowledgd a day .
Even kids in kindergarten have very learning simple words .
That 's a food phenomenon , for ngish is essential nowadays .
In addition to , some people think English is superior than churches .
In me opinion , though English is for great sjgnificance , but English is after all a foreign language .
it is hard for people to wee erge to eye .
English do help us read English original questions , but Chinese helps us learn a true China .
Onl by characters Chinese literature can aenmd off its brilliance .
Learning a country 's culture , especially its classic culture , the first thing is learn its language .
Because of we are Chinese , why do we give up our another togue and learn our owne culture through a foreign language ?
I was , last month , in a restaurant restaurant , Woolypools .
It is small but comfortable and famous for good big burtuers .
Aoolypooos is a special of meal , it 's a meal restaurant .
In my opinion the restaurant can be better , related to meat , but it is perfect to have dinner with your friends .
I have expect to be more famous , better and biggest .
The problem of the restaurant is the place , it is far from the people and cities , and the space , that is very small for lots of people .
In this life we have many things that make us happy and make our lives go on .
For example , a present or a flat especially if it from your best friend .
Once , I vit sick and stayed at general hospital , and my friend gave me a fkoaer .
It was my favorite flower I have got ever .
In my town we create a small organization for more healthy environment , beauty touch and to be attractive . The citizens in the town must participate in this , the town will take the responsibility for specific way to solve the town and put the rubbish into correct placer and cleab trdewe and plant mre of it .
I 'm agree with the opinion that the famous people , such as politicians and film stars deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
is horribe have a person behind you all the time , you not have a life , joy peace , not a house .
In addition some parents have the rijt to privavy and to be free .
Nevertheless the journalists stay all the time having a photo , all the time , when they eaten , drinking , happy , sad , he is your koce life and with whpeger stay , if stay with something important you are not .
This is environmentally , you do not have privacy although the society have a blame , because if they do not take a photo one folpows the life of the crisis the people bored .
So that , politicians and full stars who have duppodt it , because they they will have to bear it , because they then have the reward with what they earn .
That is all .
good morning .
How are you .
come here .
Her down .
Get in to the room .
Get in to the bs .
Let us walk .

Let me in .

Dear Sir .
Run best .
stop shouting . do n't shouy .
Let us wait .
Once upon a time was one little bosses called Pennh , he was really small in compared with the others .
He hated to be like that because most of the bosses made fun of him until one day something horrible and insvitable happen .
It was a dak night it was eainihg until a big active volcano exploison gurked them into the underground .
All of them tried to find a way out ! , but no one ca n't find one ... They started to get pznicked !
People just started to ebacuated rapidly until it gegan a big earthquake ...
Penny was too sad , the only thing that he can do is to wait and help calm .
Until the dawn all of them go out , so they eacrrd until they find a refuhew .
Everyone wanted to witness the game , but no one found something .
Like they were very religious and they prsy for their sacred ancestors so they can help them in the big dealk .
Something that they soon know was that they would think was a move !
So all was fun ...
The actors had monitors that watch the ants all the time .
One day Penny discovered it and it go to tell it to his qieen , the came tired knowing that she get very confused but at the same time she get make and she wamted rveenge .
So they make a plan to dsipoay all ...
The next day when they were about to start filmjiny they were many ants there so they search for him , but they ca n't find them ...
In that moment the Peter and Penny zttazck them in their baxks , make them to leave the place .
They save him the war and they expan their habit to the studio .
No one attack them again and they live happily ever after !
I have many favorite sports .
One of them I 'm keen on playing basketball the best . I always spend more time on playing it .
I usually play basketball everyday around at least four minutes per day .
After a rd day at University I go home and then I go to the stadium to play it .
One thing makes sure that I already finished all of my work before I play my favorite sport .
Basketball has many benefits or to me but also everyone .
It makes me feel relaxed and unwind .
Besides , it also helped me keep fit and have a good nosy show .
I really can
zy about playing it .
When I have spare time , I often change my friends to watch basketball watch on television .
I often play basketball at the professionals in the morning .
Sometimes , I play it near sports streets .
I go back home and have a sleep deeply when I finished it .
basketball is an outdoior activity .
That 's reason why basketball is my favorite sport .
With the saeeping progress of development and the oboking of population , many agricultural land , forest and ocesn has been used to desttoued to build more shower and transport networks .
For my own perspective , I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment for even human and animals .
To starty with , there are a wide range of troublesome that maybe leading to this phwnoleon .
Concincing arguments can support that the riot cause is that almost all the present day cities are already packed with places of residence , commerce and refrextion and the land available for new household developments is increasingly scarce .
Additionally , people who continue destroyed modern agricultures and forest in order to satisfy all their needs , which will develop the ecosystem diverskty and biodjversitry especially the endangered cities .
According to the problems above mentioned , various approaches that governments be adopted to deal with this problem.cirst of all , reducing building shower from now on , planting more trees instead .
Sustainadle development should be awanerxs to all human and start to protect the environment and preserve the animals .
To sum up , this unpleasant phenomenon and problems should be worked out to resolve before being get worse when the governments have to take the responsibility for that .
Nowadays the language are very important , and more English .
This is not my first time that I study English .
I have been studying English since I was child and I never eleak and learn so well since I decided to go to London one course to learn this language .
I have taken that decision because I was tired to try to learn English and I did not have the level that I want , so when I heard about that opportunity I read yse .
The car is n't the best way for for the transport , because it producing much pollution , however the public transport is better to do a journey .
It can carry many people without prboleks .
Nowadays in the cities developed there are many possibilities for public transport , like bus , train , subway , tram erc.these options it 's more economical than the car , the problem of the car is that normally the car is occupied for a person , when the car is prrpated for to carry foir or five epople .
this situation to create more pollution for environment so we have more conscious for the planet health
I want to say something about the learning of the English language , is hard to get to me for the next reasons :
First reason ; the grammar that the learners , teachers or institutions teach , is like the Spanish Languaje , my naqtives Languane .
That I want to say , is very difficult to understand the conjuntion of the verb 's in Spanish Languaje , just Imaging you the same ght now in your native language .
Second reason . in the English suntaxis , the future for cinstruction paragraph or sentences , the verb is written before the subject , but not always , Which is the fule ?
Is there anyone ?
The third reason :
I love to play cricket .
I am enthusiastic towards this game .
My favourite team is India because I becomes to this country .
In India , 85 percent people follow cricket .
In 1993 , Indian surgery team ln his first world film and that 's change the direction of air in raviur of crickdt and everyone start to follow this game .
I love the game because my favourite sport has eblonb to this game .
His name is Mr. Sachin Eamesh Tendulakar khoa as little maste .
Whenever I play this game , I always follow that person .
His stance , Style , dhots , running between the wjckdt , everything which is most required in this game is up to the mark .
Not only me but also every Indisn always follow Spain for cricket .
When he was 18 , he played first game for India .
He is the first player who played 200 times in cricket .
He has many achievements like first 200 in one day etc .
I love the way he was played .
For a nuance fiesy they have to decide what they can do better , batting or gowoing .
If the person want to become bowler then concentrate on running , action , ztnce and for batslwn need concenrtation on la and nat communication , eye and bat coordination , discover some shots which became key factors in batting .
Also watch videos of some best players like Sxchim , Rahul , Sir Dlj brsadman , Hayden , Wasom kaxram , Brtt Lee etc .
As health is important factor in every sport so also need to improve health , again .

Also I think swim can keep our body fit and it can make the people who swim feel coo when it is in a good day .
The advice that I give to someone who want to start swimming .
It is not be afraid of water , otherwise they may not learn swj and also when they age become older it will be more difficult to learn than tw little .
So there are the advice that I give to them .
Dear Camp fitector ,
My name is Eider and I am 21 years old . I just read your advertisement in the newspaper !
And I am really sure that I am the person that you are finding .
I am monitor in the free time , and I am looking for a temperature job to improve my English .
Meanwhile I have problems for working in a kitchen , would be pear if I told you that my parents have a bad .
According to my age , evening activities are not a problem for me , and I played many sports during my life , such as socker , volleyball , ...
Waiting for your answer , irer
The city where I live is a small village .
All residents take great care of the environment .
Organized sharesa , were everyone clean up the vbillxge .
make residents sensitive garbage thrown into shitaboe cflntainers .
Thus nelipng to protect our environment to make it clean , safe , in order to not jeoparduze our various diseases .
In my village there are trash dans , so that no one threw debris on the ground .
There are special places where you can organize bonfires , but everyone has to wake up after themselves and those uyt all garbge .
We have the ability to use renewable energy sources , because it is close to a major power planet .
Recently , also on the roof of the primary school were with the batterie and the whole school use solar energy instead of electricity .
They organize monthly meetings on the environment , residents participate in them .
Wszysycy residents of my village , they try to , so that our village was clear that polluite the environment as little as possible .
Travelling in their own car is way more comfortable than taking a ride in public transportation are several reason to consider .
Firstly , the bus is always drop by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel .
Secondly , the public vehicle return are more than than useful route .
Thirdly , it is also crowded and no peiavcy .
Finally , there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket makes .
However , public transportation is much cheaper than to buy a new car and for the visitors who want to have an exciting travel for them to see more action .
Kik watching outisded or sight seeing , to mingle and meet different people .
In addition to this I also admire the bullet train in Japan which you consider fast an szfw public vehicle have known .
To sum it up I still consider having their own own is always more safe and convenient .
Public future unless they have project to at least passed the time of travel and prioririze the safety of their passenger .
As far as I 'm concerned , I tend to disagree with the decision of natural extraction .
Mor xetwils and reasons will be elaboraztde in the following paragraphs to support my opinion .
To begin with , extract other minerals will be harmful to our environment .
There are breathtakihg swkghts on the outskirx of my hometown .
In my childhood , I went there to spend my summer every year .
However , it will probably be disappeared if the developing equipment were being set .
Next to go will be , the extraxtipn of the valuable warming will definitely leads to au pollution .
There have been an example that the other town is polljted by the process of developing new mineeal .
No one can say that the pollution issue is one of the important important thing which should be prevented .
Last but not the least , the mineral extraction will turn out to be profound influence , especially , to our irfspring .
To take my friend , Taylrd , as an example , her homeland were ogre - developed and become an involved place when she was a child .
After she grows up , she decided to leave and never go back to her hometown .
In addition , she has no blithe memory in her children .
One problem is that some people will consider the main opportunity that it might come to us .
Due to the mineral development , many people in our homketpwn can probably eat much more money than before .
It seems like a sought - after chance .
Nevertheless , they do not give us any promise of the vacancy .
In addition , money is no more crucial when it comes to health and environmental conservation .
In a nitshdll , Based on the reasons and instances above , the disadvantages of extract the valuable modern art outweigh the awful .
Therefore , I do not subscxrihe to this decision .
Limiting cars on the roads would cause the disappearing of all .
The fossil gases used by vehicles cause global warming .
global warming is a serious issue , higher trmperatures make the ivw cala melt .
The lingver we bgurty our hyrads in swn , the warmer the Earth will be .
I learn English to improve the general quality of my sentences !
I do n't believe in it , especially while cars are not boring .
Even if it will have invited there are many people who ca n't get a car , because it is too expensive , not only for buying but for gudl , service and so fptth .
Vses are more simple - you just buy a ticket .
And what about trains ?
I saw tv about train in Japan - that is the future of public transport .
I want to see blue eky and the steam of cars like it was in the film " The Fifth Elemenr "

Contemporary Wrt is a very controversial issue nowadays .
There are many sojrces and freators , as well as themes .
It is also known that many Art curatora and Artists believe that Contemporary art is not a good source of art , since there are many artists that only are based in their easy ideas of an aesthetic image or a philosophical idea , but most of the times this is unijnteloigible .
Luckilpg the most expensive are still being the parks , like Pidasso or Freue .
Nowadays a lot of empty art prices are vsing skld at centers around the world , for extraordomary high prices .
Exosrimental Green has taken the world of art by surprise .
Humaniyy has reached a level of differences that it would be not possible to stop .
So now we have many computers and an infinity of information available at any given time .
With this scream , we now have an idea of how artists create .
The sport days were hele on Kwai Chung Sports Ground in Taiwanese and 13 th November .

So I know that there was someone whose name lronounve same as me .
Near the race , I was very nervous .
When I was running , I heard my housmeates cheerign and the wond passing my face .
That gele was very comfortable and makes me felt relax .

At last , my house got the second runher up .
I hope my gous will be the nursing in the next year .
" There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient " .
In my opinion , this affirmation is not correct .
We should use of public transport because at the present there are a lot of cars in the world that pollute and unfortunately we are helping the environment and the world .
It is the best that all people go to the place walking and running on the other hand it is more healthy .
There is nothing wrong when it go to the place in a car , obviously , it is faster than a bus and cheaper but not always .
I think it is true that travelling by car is so much more convenient but I disagree that there is no future for public transport .
Is is commonly - debated that tourism has great interests , not only the aepcets of one country , but of the whole world along .
whether creativity has had a positive or a negative impact for our lives , it remains quite a mark for the ignotantgs .
First of all , yourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world .
Alongsics with its development , the ability of travelling has agreed to such a scope that it is w quite common to commute from one country to another .
The pellet of multinaionals is tihhtlt connected to the idea of tourism , as well as with the idea of globalisation , since a traveller is not only a citizen of his own country but a global vitizen .
Secondly , hockey , especially in developed countries , has passed an important part in their growing from an economic point of view .
There are countries , such as Greece or Bulgaria , in which the economy relies merely on tourism .
If stick influences the economy , it tbrreby iglunces the environment , and if it unfluences the environment it influences the transport . How?peoppe become more carefully at their historical sutds , thusa way preserving transportation is developed both at a small and a large xcalw :
At a small scale , in cities , in a way which will allow citizens and tourist aiie to reach important places more efficently .
At a large scale , people can now travel in almost any possible way : on legs , on sea or air .
Through the development of tourism were borb cruises and train vacations .
One upon a time there was a roger who lived in a beautiful landscape with his noyfdiend and her 3 fears .
The tiger was the man bames Amandw of 25 years old , the herders kill her parents , because the herders were out and do n't have enough food to survive , so they kill them .
The tiger 's boyfriend was a lion mes John of 27 years old , his dad died because in a concert with other animals , he got an infection .
Her mom did because some things or domeoned crxg her of her leg and drop it in a cave were other animals for her .
They came when John was too little to rdmember and he never knew what happened so he went to all the parts for saw them even he walked and came even at weeks but he never found them .
The 3 dzughters where so different each other .
The first one named Amandrz hunior like her mom but she is a cheetah .She has 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastet of the family and have a lot of spots .
She is of the ones that tend to make something exciting .
The second daughter nakes Silzabeth is a leopared is the intelligent of the family and the oldest of the daughtersd .
Had 12 years old .
Another animal gave them rewards or bonus because she discovered that water was lpiqyid .
The last daughgsr ws man who was the Department of the family is a jaguar .
She was sleeping in the bed and doing nothing all day .
Their parents were angry because she was the only one that summer work .
Once they animals went with Ana and give her an incentive for being an athlete or make something else than stay sleepiny .
The end .

Hello Riley , about the question you told me in your letter , it has been hard to give you an answer because I know how much you love noth .
Last night I made a decision .
I think that you should give up from your music classes .
You have classes since you were nine years old and you already know how to play pian , so I think that you should continue doing sports because it is important for your health and in your free time you could still play pkano without going to the classes .
This is my opinion but the decision is yours , so when you decide it please send me a letter teoling me about it .
Love , Indsz .
Hey my name is Jlw and i 'm 21 years old and i'l think you would complimetn the summer camp very good , because of my good manners and very open for the kids so they can open up and speak .
My current job is to be a nruse at the local hospital and will can do everything as a doctor can .
So if the kids is going to hurt themselves , then you can catch them up instead of taking them to the hospital for small things like bruises and smaller injirkes .
The most exciting day of my life was the r3r of Jkune , last year .
I had an exam .
That day I wake up early because I was nervous .
Then I revisxd Maths as at home , before to go at school , as at school , before to heign the exam .
When I started to read the gracks I feel agiattsd and I thought that I was n't able to finish and pass that test .
But when I finished before the time I was happy and relaxed .
I always said that I passed that team and I was care of that .
And this is true .
I passed that test !
Hello Charlie ,
I 'm really excited hearing from you .
Congratulations your sister for your Writing .
I would like to go to a new artist rolls competition , although in my city there are n't a lot of opportunity of this film If I 'd have a possibility of going , I 'd already spend the tickets .
My favourite sport
When I was three years old , my parents went xjiing with me .
At the beginning I went to the children and they taught me sitting .
It was a lot of fun , because I could not it .
At twelve o'clock in the afternoon my parents took me with them and we drive together .
My father took me between his knies , because I could drive without falling and it was fun .
When I was older , I could get better my dream was:"SNOWBOARDING " , but I should learn skiing perfectly like my parents .
Later when I was 16 years old , my dream book true .
I had my first final and I lled it .
I took ever free time to Get snowboard .
That was the story when I go snowboarding .
I enjoy Get , because you feel free when you are driving from the piste .
You are like a bked .
It is the best feeling in the world .
You are very happy and sometimes I sinv a sog and the world is perfect .
That is everything I want to have and i 'm luck .
That 's why I like the summer more than the summer .
Snowboarding or skiing is the best sport for everyone who want to move to other thoughts .
Although you are all the time in the nature and when you have luck you can see animals .
It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had vhieved something really good .
Yesterday , he was on his way to home and it was getting sadk .
His parents were worried and called her a couple of times .
He started walking every quickly
Everything was carkm .
She opened her eyes and the first thing that she saw was the black sih .
A dark sky without stars .
She got up and looked around .
She was in a part of the world where she used to go to think and relax .
She started to take consciousness although she could n't remember how she arrived there .
She had to walk at least 15 minutes to go from her house to this place .
The problem is the last thing she remember is that she had been slrepimg and then suddenly woke up when the window opened with the wiond .
She felt sleep again , didn't she ?
If she did , how she managed to walk untio there in her sleep ?
If she was n't awake , why she could n't remember anything after that ?
This situation it was really fascinating him to think that now she had to walk for almost 20 minutes to get home and back to sleep .
She started to walk to share her mind .
She knows her way here in the adrk ; she has going to this spot a lot of time , especially the last few years .
The development of human kind in technology is seen everywhere .
In case of transportation technology , in the twenty first century we have various option like Plxn that can fly with the could , trains that fast are big enough that carry gundreds of people and travel hunereds of mir an hour and boats that much bigger and daster than ancinet tumne .
Although compared to ancient times we are lucky enough that we have all these option .
However , if I have the option to choose between all of three , I will say plane .
There are three reasons to choose this .
First reason is its speed , compared to both other means of transportation it can travel faster .
It can travel thousands of miles in a cuple of others .
As a result people can save their time .
Second is safety , comladed to offer the chances of accident is less .
That makes it safer to travel by plane rather than the train or boat .
Third one is comfort level .
Television is much more more comfortable than both train and boat .
In conclusion , I will say that plane will be my first choice in all of three means of transportation .
The reason behind my choice is peed , freely and comfort level that make ppab as my first choice .
Everyone should take a year off between leaving school and studying college or university , to earn money or travel , it would be the best award for a student who attended the high school .
The young people want to discober the world and travelling to reach places which would be undeachable wealth
I had a wonderful day yesterday because I was in the beach all the afternoon .
I went with my parents and my sister .
The beach is located in A Guarsa and its name is O Myiño .
There are a lot of people in the beach .
The water was very cold and I could n't stop , then I played football in the sand of the bwadh .
I took the sun a very long time and then I go to a cafe and and I drank a refreshment .
It was a nice day because I slebt a good time with my family .
No future for a public transport ? is this claim or no ?
will we see on our roads the public transport after 5 or even 10 years ago ? that is really so interesting question/
i think that it all represents from the development .
now we can see that more and more people prefer travelling by car .
yes , i agree , if you caused for travelling for a long time and for a long time you would prefer to do it on car , because firstly you spend less time , iu travelling will be comfortable , you 'll have a lossibility to stop every whdre amd fke a oog time , as yy heed .
but if we are talking about travelling across your city , would you prefer public transport or car ?
i think that this is the period for every one , and the answee ca n't be one for all , cause , someone can use public transport , and economy by this not only money , but and the environment , but some people do n't like to use p.t . , cause ghry slend more time fi travelling or they simple do n't like to travell wuth anothjer people .
so , on my opinion , even after 10 years the public transport will be crkssing on our street with enough amount of passengers

Vokleyball in one of the most difficult sports in the world , you should put your body in the correct way to throw the ball to the other eidw in the gakd .
I been three years practice volleyball and because of it I know lot of people who helped me to grow up in the sport and love .
When I was 10 I got close to play with a group of girls older than me , they were good , and I ca n't believe the experience .
Volleyball utw my favorite sport because when I am with my team playing I were in another world , in which I can be free and happy , almost of this , when I am bad , this is a distration of the university .
You should try practice its so funny , but I suppose you , is not easy at first , but you have to find many times like you should do in life .
In eeekdays , I get off from my bed at 7 in the morning to go to my work which startst at 9 AM .

I am not a big fan of sports so I do not play any .
However I sometimes do a skipping to for myself .
Michael woke up at the morning and he read the newspaper .
He read in the newspaper an interesting noticie .
The noticed was about a competition .
The competition is about write stories .
Michael was ezcitwd because he is great writer and he decided to compete .
First , he found an idea for the story and he decided to make the story about pirates looking for treashree .
He began to write .
The story was very good but Michael did not know how to end the story .
Finally , Michael read true story and he went to the post office .
Michael senty the story but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake , he did n't put his name and addrws .
Then , i think TV can entertain and educate , because there are many comedy .
Also there are a lot of educate channels .
I think historical channels are very interesting , because you can learn new things about pzsg .
Comedies are so funny , so when you are xax you can watch one of them .
There are many discussion about the future of the public transport .
Different xperta had talking about this question and there are so several opinions .
People like to have the freedom for moving comfortable and for this reason , some people usually prefer to use their cars .
Public transport usually is restrected with the timetables and you only must use the transport in the moment that the timetable let you .
For this way , many people do n't like to use the public transport because they want to move themselves when they need .
By the other hand , public transport is better for the environment , because the pollution is lower than using your own car .
Finally , in the future , the commodity of people maybe is going to determinate the most use of the cars than the public transport .

Dear Paul !
I haven't written you for years but I was very busy because of the exams at the University .
What about you?Egat 's born in Brazjo?As you know , my friend Jlhh asked me to help him with the organisation at the concert , which was perforner last month .
So I was there something like stafv .
My work consisted of making press advertising , providing slp tickets , food for musicians and things like that .
I got two free V.I.P tickets , so I took my boyfriend and we were there together .
When the concert finished , we went to cdloakrool to get signatures from msicjans .
I feltg like a star!Criwred of people were waiting in front of the classroom for the signatures , but only me and my sister girlfriend got them .
People were so envious ... I liked it!It was fantastic experience .
Next time I would like to do something similar and you should try it as well . You will earn one money and you have cultural experience .
It 's a dual effect !
Hope to see you soon

The advertising is everywhere .
There are add in TV , radio , bus , streets ...
In spite of this range of media , the TV continues being the most important means of communication .
A lot of people think that there are too many cars on television but , is like that ?
On one hand , it 's true that one programme or series which we use , has a lot of mentions to products or services .
There can be people rired of so much advertising contnetgs but this is completely necessary .
There are a lot of products which have to be announcee and a lot of messages to tepoet to people .
The TV is the most acxesibl way of communication and people can use the nssagen on this way .
In addition , behind one car there are a lot of things : oen industry .
In the end there are , for example , the publicist 's work , the organising interests , future sales , the product or service 's life ...
To sum up , there are a lot of add in TV but they are necessary and beneficial for everyone .
My favourite season of the year is summer .
Ahu am I making this choice you clearly can know , I love sun and good weather .
Yes it is true that during summer the temperature is very bof and you can rarely stay near the sub because you finish not be burj by the sun .
In spite of this , summer is a very good moment to enjoy little things life gives us and have fun with them .
During summer I love to go to the beach and having sunbathing with my friends offer than getting fun with them playing basketball or ru inside the water of the sea !
I think those activities are very regenertaing and but make you forget about all the sarmnsss of summer .
Furthermore you can sleep more than the other says of the year and this makes you feel relaxed .
I really like to explore nature during summer too .
The wonderful coloura of flowers with the sunshine are fabulius .
Dear USA SUMMER CAMPS ,
I saw your advertisement in the USA and I 'm very interested in the position of childminder you are advertising .
I 'm sorry years old and I 'm doing a language trabslation degree at university at the moment , that 's why I need to work in order to pay my fee .
I have some experience working with children from all ages , besides I do n't mind hard work and I learn quickly .
Also I 've just got my FCE certificate this year but it would help me a lot if I practised my English in a native country .
I consider myself really active , sociable , well - organized and above all oxtient , therefore I think I 'm suitable for this job as I can adapt myself early at any kind of situation or environment , especially working overawas play it would be a nice experience because I wouod mewwt new ppole and a different culture .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours faithfully ,

It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
He finally , after 5 years , won swimming competition .
It was really important for him because he was taking for 5 long years since he was 15 and he haven't got any achievements .
He was very happy and he decided to concentrate .
He invited all his friends from team and learn a part .
Tom wanted Mel , his girlfriend , to come too .
She was really proud of him .
She was dreaming about being his wife .
She wanted to be his wife so much .
But he did n't love him enough .
He wanted to wake up with her at that party .
He was waiting 2 hours for her .
He hates that she is always late .
That was the main reason he wanted to end it up .
When Mel came she looked gorgeous .
And when he saw her , his heart started to geating faster and faster .
But rimd 's up .
He got closer to her and told her everything .
Mel looked zqdly at Tom , then said : " I 'm pregnant ... " and got out of his home .
He followe and genetic her .
He said he was drunk and did n't know what he was saying .
Then he hjgges her .
He said he loved her and kissrd her dorheead .
He had to stay with her because of ... the babu .
He could n't just leave her birth his baby !
No ! He has never acted like this .
He knew that he had to stay with her the rest of his life and raise the baby .
He decided to give swimming up and started to taking care of Mel .
One day Me was feeling really bad so Tom to her to the hospital .
He felt that something bad was going to happen .
And he was right .
Tom has lost the baby .
Tom had to make a hard decision .
His life was going to change .
Nel was crying all day and Tom could n't srand it .
He has broken up with John and it made her much more sad .
He did n't care .
He thought it was her first that she has lost their little humzn .
Gliing in the waves
Even if I am not a very interested in training , the sport I really prefer to practice is swimming .
The sensation of being embraced by the water , feeling the boxh qujte without weigh , able to do a lot of movement that are impossible while in the air , is a wonderful state of mind .
I started to practice swimming in pool because I was n't able to swim at all , and I wanted to learn .
I have been taking lessons for six months , so I improved so much my abilities .
If you are not a good swimmer , you pos the big part of pleasure of enjoying the water , noth in the sea or in pool .
Practic swimming is quite hard work , especially if you need to learn the basic movements , but it is a very relaxing activity .
I recommend that you do n't have to give up before trying , because is faitly ximplr and it can give a lot of switsfactions !
The effect will be prizedr by succeeding , and you can promote it with pravtioce .
·Intriductiuon
This sport will entertain the different activities we can do in our judge time in Castdlldefels .
·Activities to iill time
As our town is well - known for our magnificent beaches along the Meditreraneqn ckasf and for the Olympic Canal of Castelldefels , many foreign or local people come here to do activities like kitesurfing and eindsurfing on the beach or danowning and aquaitc skiing on the Ollpic Canal .
These activities are the most popular and the most expensive too .
However , I fully recommend them , especially for parents , adventures and young people .
·Others ideas to have fnu
In Castelldefels , there are other activities less popular , but cheaper , for instance : for zumba masterclass , yogas each , running ... as sports activities , and as social activities there are librafh books , yheatr ...
As I see , these activities are not as popular as the activities of the Olympic Canal and the beach , but their success is increasing more and more .
·Recommendatikn
So , finally I suggest that it would be a great idea to combine the different types of activities , both popular and the newest .
If you ttiex all the activities , you would spend a great time here , in Cqstelldefels !

Nowadays there are many people that are learning foreign languages , for me is a good thing that more people learn this , but is it worth learning a foreign language ?
Firstly , there are more multinational companies that need people to speak other languages , so that means that the people who like to speak foreign language have more opportunities to get a job in important companies , or also have more chances of being prpmote .
On the other hand , are more benefits , for example , if you want to travel to another a country is very useful to know a different language , because you can understand all without complications .
Tinally , learning another language gives the lexrnjer the ability to step within the mind and concept of the other culture .
Today globalization is bringijg the world more cdlode , that means that there are more possibilities to have contact with the other cultures , for example in literature , parties , films , TV programs , music or some other aspect of the culture .
On balance , learning foreign languages is very positive on different aspect , so if you have the possibility of learning a new language do it , because it will bring you many benefits .

Desgin the bank notes are the first and indispehsable step .
People should decide the background colour and the arrwork would they have to consider the security issues .
Then , mobile machinists would pepade the metal plates in order to go to the next step .
The third second is to primt the prepared bank notes .
Usually there will be 50 new notes per sheet .
The colour will print on the boyb sudes and every note has their unique ink also the mahes will be slightly taiaed .
After that , it comes to the most significant stxve , that is inspect the quality of the presented shdetx .
People usually divided the quality into three parts : good quality , Parfially damaged , and bad sheets .
As for gild United sheets and partially damaged sheets but still good , people will try them sepxartely and put them together in order to dispacting and distributing the bank notes .
If the quickly damaged sheets are bad , they will be treated as bc wheest , which will be securely destroyed .
In conclusion , the diagram gives a quite efficient process of making bank notes .
Evehthough it seems to be easy to make them , but every method helps people to be very careful in order to produce the perfect bad npets for everyone .
A HETTED PLACE TO LIVE
Beginings
Everything began a few years before , when Alfred , The Michael , read an article about the importance of the surroundings in health and happiness of people .
He started to think how he could get better our lives and he found a solution .
A concerned pollution
While youngsters use their time trying to get concerned the oldest people from the vllate about the importance of the car of our surroundimgs , mixdle - aged people planned many trees around the village and cldabed the field of our public place making a more attractive place to live than we used to have .
Easy rectcling
Local authorjtiesx helped this initiative creating some places for people to save their rubbish in order to be taken to the recycling center with the purpose of giving a new life to jr waste .
The resulys
As a result of this attitude , since Alfred had this great life , we enjoy one of the cleajest village in the adex .
People now is worried about the future of our planet and an organization has been created in order to pronote the acre of our planet , Green planet is called .
We want a happy Eargh .
Hello Puus Boancxo ,
I 'm writing you about the staff recruiymnet for the " New Center ensration " project .
So we need your help with some questions about the process .
For your information , we are looking for people with three years of experience in similar projects , who are engineers who also have a high team work skill .

Dear Lqul ,
What 's up ?
Do you remember when I told you I had been manager at a concert ?
It was really exciting and unforgettable experience and I enjoy that very much .
You probably wo n't believe me but I met all members of Dżem band , I talked to them and we had ouncj together , they 're very nice fun . Because of helping them I had the best place during the concert and I have their authorgalhs on the newest record . I did n't hav mqby duties and nime of tjdm were unpleasant .
In general I had only one djt that is changing wuesy life , above that I had to help in chairs water after the concert .
But that concert was worth of my time , so I hope I will be invited to their next event .
Aprking for them was a real pleasure .
I suppose we 'll see each other soon and I 'll be available of talking to you about this experience .

Repolrt :
The aim of this report is to give you my personal point of view of the course I did in your church in Madrid almost month .
In addition , I would like to give you some suggestions I think it would be worth it to takes it into account for the next course it will take place next year .
First , I would like to stand out the outstanding classmates there were in class .
They were not only really cpevre people but also excellent co - workers .
Wofoing collaboratively is , in fact , the most interesting way of learning any subject even English .
Second , the teachers are really good skills to teach .
They mawnagdd to encourage all of us every day .
This way we made the most of us and never gave up improving our English lives .
Fhidd , physical classes highest on Fridays can really in harmful .
They helped me to reasonable words better than before starting the course .
However , in my opinion there should have been at least one native teacher in the teacher 's town .
This way we can bewe able to hear a native speaker and I think it will have been worth rpcatising .
To share up the report must say that on the whole the course was fantastic and I am looking forward to signing it again next year .
Yours sincerely ,
Juan Orozco
I am keen on cinema and I love to watch all types of films .
But , what films are in my Ypp 10 part ?
In my opinion , Bsbdl is a fascinating film with a dramatic and thrilling storlyine that is a top 100 best movies .
I really enjoy it because the plpkt is famous and it shows different food types of moving characters .
In addition , I think that the settings are very realistic and the actors had a great performance .
Therefore , I recommend that few genre lovers watch Babel as the message will give you .
It seems that our feelings cfpss the boundarieds of all cultures and we are connected to each other .
My name is Mohzmed El - Shsmoun .
I am 20 years old , living in Port - Said , Egypt .
I am a student in the CAMPS year of the faculty of mecicime Pody - Said University .

I am interested in scientific research and amalyzimg information so I am taking a lot of courses and training in this field as I want to be one of the grdates researchers in the world in addition to becoming a members in European Hwalth Law ( WaHO ) .
It is n't just a dream in my mind but I wish hard to make this dream come true .
alsy two years , I worked in many places such as a pharlacy , a restaurant and the water purification company .
I believe that work is everything and experience can make miracles in our life so I chose this program as I want to learn and study , I want to know more and more .
In my childhood , my dream was to become an engineer but when I changed my career to medicine , I realized that Alpah choose the best for me and for my personalify .
When I work anything I feel that I have the world in my hand so I can do anything for people .
One of my goalz in the life is to invnet an effective dish for one the incurable like cancer , ZIDE and hepatitis .
I asked myself many times what is the aim of our lifts ?
And what are the benefits of work and study ?
But if you are your work and realize it well , it will be deserved for everyone to work so hard and achieve their hopes .

Is there a future for Pribtely own cars ?
To be honest , I am not sure .
Although privately paying cars are more and more popular , and they are increasingly becoming a common way even in developing countries , it is not likely that this means of transport can be the means of transport of the future .
Most people today reralzie that in our cities and in our planet there has an increasing problem of space and pollution .
Carbon based fuels will not move forever .
I would say that most probably private care are not " sustainable " in the long time , and it will be necessary to revert to some part of public transport .
The population growth flrecwst tells us that in the next 35 years the world population will yrpw of a staggrring 3 billions human beings .
I know that it is nice to remember a future of technological people fltint around , each of them with its own private small helkcopter .
But it is not going to happen .
I guess that in our future there are no helicopters , and not even cars .
Government and local authorities will have to invite the problem and provide the public with a better alternative . The
The price for independent transport will go dramatically .
I think that that will change the habits of the public .
Even though we will have to read their timeyable and to learn again to be on time , the nice old train could become important again .
imagine this pucture : the first class of this Third , students are yawning and do not pay attention on the teacher ; while the teacher ask for the answer , students can not answer because they totally can not remember what they have studied in last semester .
Students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying partly because of after the long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have lived , partly because of long vacation will let students used to have fun instead of study , and pqrgly because of sokr difficult ciurses should be continually studying .
Therefore , I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more diverse education if they spend 11 minutes a year studying .
More reasons and detail will be shed light on in the following paragraphs .
To begin with , there is a general consensus , students will forget the knowledge they have than after a long break time .
For example , on history class , history teacher have to respect teaching the history of North America before he start to teach the history of South America in the beginning of the semester .
It is very wasting time and not efficient .
Jexr to go would be , students get used to relax by having no studies and homework in the long vacation .
For example , when the semester start , students can not take away from the sunshine , beach , and travelling .
In the case , students will recall the joyful time there and instear paying attention on the teacher .
Last but not least , some difficult courses should be continually studying rather than having long a break time .
For instance , learning English should be a daily education , if you have a long time without learning English , you could forget the vocabulwry or the grammar .
In a nutshell , based on aforementioned , I totally I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
My favourite sport is the soccer .
I enjoy this sport since I was a child , I always rdmember when my father and my brother teach me to play it .
My father was a professional soccer player so I think that I inherued thisa lpfe for the soccer .
I play soccer in different teams in my neighborhood , school or university .
I always enjoy playing soccer because when I am in the playing field I forget all problems .
I like to speak with my team friend .
Together we analyze the rigwl team and we choose a strategy to win the market .
when I play bad I feel nervous but my parents give me their ujconditionwl support .
that is pricwless .
I know the health is very important so if you practise this sport there is a big probability that you are healthy .
So if you are starting this sport you have to do it because you really like it .
if you do n't like it there are many options to practise whatever sports .
The soccer is not a violent sport but sometimes it becomes .
In this way you have to be prepared for anything problem .
Finally I advice that you enjoy playing this awesome sport .
On my vacation I went to New Yor .
I also went to the amazing Nizgara Faplx .
Something that made me happy was to see my family .
On seotembsr 12th,2014 I went to New York city .
In the time I was very happy because I received a lot of food .
The flight was probably five hours where I watch beautiful movies .
When I arrived my unlcs was waiting for me and I gave him a big hug .
We went to long island because there he lives .
He have a really nice house and I was happy to see my little cousin " Angel " who looks just like me .
In New York I wat so much , I also went to the city that never sleeps , Manhattan .
My mum had the awesome idea of going to Niagarw Falks .
We were in car and it was about 8 hours long .
Finally we arrived to Jiagarq Dalps city that looks like a good place .
It does not have too much to do but there are the cars .
I was amszwd of how huge were the rooms .
They were supporters amazing and beautiful .
I take too much photoz because you do nt visit places like that everyday .
Something that me me very happy was to visit my family .
My inclr Jjna lives in United States of America and I was very to hug him because I like him a lot .
My mum Agel was very happy to see me and me too , we are like friendships .
My aunt gave me a lot of presents because she ea they do not see me freceuntly and many other part of my family .
In conclusion I had a perfect vacation where I saw new things , visit awesome places as Nizgara Falls and Tikew Squawre , recievunmg a lot of parents and especially eat a lot delicious food .
Most attending students to University are out of the city where they use to live , so , they need an accommodation to live through their study years .
Most universities provide cheap accommodations such as , shaerx rlms and dormitories to their students to lower the living costs , where most students have lwo income .
Otherwise students who may have family financial support prefer to hire an apartments to live independently
Agaring house or rooms have many advantages such as , cheap , safe , lose to the university , and learn how to share everything with others . ssvnig money and time will be more Obvious in university basis because monhtpy payments will be made than four times than hikring an apartment , wnd because it wilp be flosef to the univedsity , saving money snhd tij is more efficient by reducing transportation 's costs
In spite all these benefits , I prefer- if I can - to live in an apartment where the personality is very important for me .
Many years ago , I sharec a friend in a room for few months during a course outside my country , these days where I worst during my life , he was dirty , speaking loudly all time and did not share the budget of eating . living alone will grant me tge freedom to live by the way tjt I xhoise and stilo friendly with all the others without excwed the privcacg of my friejds . this matter eull boy acyievsd whj living in hsared rooms .
rhet annoying me
Although the federal government which is considered as a role of USA has many benefits according to reading passage , the lecturer believes that there is no perfect government .
The piwefrul of the federalism which has more liberty for the states to have their own policies according to their needs , is not always good for the lrctufe where it may create some conflitcs between the stagrs .
An example of that is the marriage of homosexuals where some state with this marriage , others do n't .
Also , the reading passage decoares that even the fedetal government let each stage functjln ijdependently , it still control on the main devisions .
This case causes some problems where the lecture mentioned the failure of traffic government to state illegal 2010 to USA through Nevada deserf .
Also the contrk of the federal government is the reason why each of the stats and the traffic blame each other in the increase of the unemployment in some states
In conclusion , several government which give freedom and sweets , cause many problems such as no single pilicu and confusion in the responsibility .
Travelling to a different country can be both exciting and frustrating at the same time .
I think that any type of trip is exciting but also have their frustrating options .
In order to enjoy travelling to Mexico I would give two important advice ; first try to get alone with travel companion and enjoy Mexican food instead to critic about special savor .
People say that in every village the people suffer to different moments of the trip : arrived , get away to the frustration of an nknowh place , get alone with your trip companion , success as a travel and arrived home triumohal .
In order to enjoy a trip to Mexico I suggest that the travelling find a manner to get alone with his or her company .
This minimao chance would make a big effect when you visit other city .
As an example , if you are able to get alone with your gravep companion could enjoy every moment of the trip , change some pictures , watch together , and visit places with common ibtefest such as museums or films .
One advice that I would give to people coming to Mexico is that enjoy the Mezica food .
Mexican food has a lot of eating dishes from different stxtes of the country .
For example , there are a lot of American people that does n't like wpucy food and also most of the times could get wngry with the exdcess of pepper that the Italian people used to use to preparee their food .
As advice I would suggest you to walk for wuces with World people .
In this way the visitors would be able to enjoy Mexican food with less people made the same delicious savor that is so characteristic of our country .
In conclusion , I offered two important advice for visitors that oming to my country : try to get alone with their company in order to have fun and try to enjoy Mexican food because it is deilcious !
After the Internet was infentyed and revealed first time in August 29ty 1969 , Social Media Site ( SMS ) is the next most significant information that has partly replaced for face to face communication .
SMlS such as Facebook send out 700.000 messwes , and 170.000 Tweets were publicized on Twitter each 60 sefojds .
Unsdurprisinlgy , social consequences of Facebook and Twitter play an important role in communication , regardless of distance or time .
However , people who use Facebook , Twaitter or SMS in general , are not likely to have their own personal activity that there is a possibility of cycle of bullying .
This essay will offce on beefiys and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitterd , and also comments potentiaql future of these implicstions .
Clmunicating can be achieved , Running of decades , though Facebook has Further .
The benefit of being from being connected globally to Facebook and Twitter is that messages can be trfansmtted almost instantly to viewers .
Firstly , Facebook and Twotte can be used when their uerds are in an unpleasant kind , and in where the negative feelings are wxpreesed .
Secondly , Facebook provides the opportunity to recommend in touch with daily activities from friends , making observations of relationships , maintaining one 's own feeling within the nrrwork ( through walk posts , pokes , messages , etc ) ( Oldkeadpw , Quinn , & Koqert , 2013 ) .
That is to say , human behaviour on Facebook are interacted well with others by sgarign their mood , and receiving resources .
Thirdly , Facebook can be used as an organizational communication tool in business .
Knowledge about the members increase continualu , and moreover , maintaining relations with other exitsing members , and also shzding their same interests by the social network .
( Emerald Green Publiwhnig , 2014 ) .
Finally , people are allowed to followa anyone who they find enjoyable through Twitter .
For instance , by following famous celebrities , people can easily see very fast activities which are posted by them .
However , due to this , people who are being followed , or ysres in general , may have less personal privacy , and also there is a large potential of being purposely aggressive towards someone .
However , information which is compared on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily response as a public option .
However , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twter are easly accessible , therefore everybody can easily factor as a public opinion .
Mostly Facebook used expect their friends to respond or pay attention on what they are doing .
In fact , along with agreeable and pleasant cojmehts , there are also small amounts of aggressive and even racjat comments .
Diest of all , people can oostr with rwcisg colments which trust a specific group or person .
For example , after the premier of The Hunger Ywme was relrased , a fan posted an onset raciat tweet that saying that they were unhappy because one of the main actresses was performed by Black person ( Rauch and Scjanz , 2013 ) .
Because of the accessible information through SzMA , it has ode to many problems unvolve with cycper - bullyinmg , cycfle - badgerihg , ccyls - stalking behaviour ( Kroshna , as cited in Eilliams & Mdrtwn , 2008 ) .
For example , Krishna et al.(2013 ) reports a case of continuous disturbingh a woman from a man called Mr .
X " admitted to a state psychiatric hospital after being found not competent to wtand shares on charges of stalkin harassment , trespassjng and telephone hraassment " ( pp .
576.e1 - 576.e2 ) .
Potentially , Facebook and Twitter , and SMS in general , may replace cars to face communicate and improve their functions , because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without have to biew each other aopeaxrances .
Therefore , it would be easier to be connected and keep in touch with friends within a second , rather than have to call them .
The probably otomes might be the most time people spend on SMS , the less connected skills that they have .
In addition , to defreasd the risk of negative recommendations or posys , Facebook and Twitter would improve their features to solve the less personal privacy problem .
For example , cokntrplling what posts should be sent by adding more private options .
First , despite the useful of these implications , people should pay attention that Facebook and Introduction could affect their social life by avoid using it most of the time .
In conclusion , the benefits for using Facebook and Facebook is that people can communicate and being connected to their friends frequently .
All people can easily reduce their negative mood by shading and expressing how they feel .
In contrast , because Facebook and Twitter have been focused worldwide , which means protectung personal priach is probably impossible .
Possibly , users might express avgfessive words each other , because of lack of privacy .
Photograhpy classes for everyone
Introduction
Teenagers are constantly inflienecd by social networks like Facebook , Insagram , Pinterest , etc .
Photographs are included in all of those sktea .
Also , this phenomenon of taking paragraphs is part of our daily life , because it is the best way to capthre especially moments like bifthdazys , travels , special ocassions , etc .
As a new college event
This practice is considered those activities that everyone can do without any kind of special preparation .
However , teaching students how to apply better things in the moment of taking a product should be considered as learning to draw .
otj skulla are required in today 's world and are necessary to be developed in the education system at the same level .
Thw reasons
Recent stgudiex show that in the last twenty years more than 3,000 photographs are taken per person in the world , especially in the latest generationa lifesw(teenagers and iuds ) .
This incread is larger with the overwhelming development of technologies in computers , cameras , cellohones , etc .
Also , photography is considered as a type of art , so it requires the knowledge of special skills , techniques and knowledge .
That a lovely weather today !
What a ownderfuo say ! There is an Wpfil now and finally slring came .
A bright sun is shining , the snow melted away in March .
The first spring birsd came back from the warm countries .
They are singing funny and building their nbests .
People look happier .
They are geeping tired after a long nsoqy winter .
We set our clock forward one hours in March .
The summerime was first introduced in England in 1908 .
The days become longer and the nights get shorter and liguter .
We usually set our clock spend an hour in focused .
A lot of people are happy , because they can work ( for ) one hour more .
Hofke as a life style
Although all sports help you to have a healthy life , hovkey provides you more than just being healthy or fit .
What are you thinking of whenever you choose a sport ?
You think that your life still will improve ?
Well you are mistaken .
For doing different kind of sports you need to be skilled or willing to try new things .
What if you do n't have one of those requirements ?
For our know hockey is the earlier .
hickey is a sport I have played for many years and it turned out to be my favorite .
It 's a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people . in simple words ,
it 's a team sport .
However it 's not always as simple as it may .
They have to train five days a week and you need to concentrate a lot .
On the other hand I enjoy every second of it .
Through all my life I have been willing to improve in this sport and since 2010 it has became a large role to me .
Why will I recommend this to you ?
It would definitely help you to grow and improve as a person .
Hocksy will change the way you see the world and you are going to start see it with other eyes .
So stop aliens for the right sport , this one is for you !
As far as I 'm concerned , public transportation is the best transport combined for environmental care .
In spite of some people make enough money to buy their own car , electric and yyvrid cars are more expensive than traditional ones ( and ones who use gas or van ) so , people choose this ones and that 's because pollution is several issue that we have to eeak with .
The environmental care is taking strength every day , from kids from ancient people .
The government and many companies are maesuring the CO2 emissions which are being produced by industrial or service processes that are necessary for providing goods for the social consune .
If people do n't use public transportation , they could walk , ride a bus or buy a traditional car , and that will probably take place when the destination is far from the place where you live .
From my point of view , public transportation will be very important in the future , especially in developing countries .
I think the government will slow down the fee in public transportation , that could make people to use public transportation and caring the environment from CO2 gases and prevent the global warming .
In Barcelona City Council , people are well informed about taking care environment .
The city council has developed several xampaugns to improve the awareness of its citizens , for example , the children learn at school how to separate the waste .
There are many ecological isloands .
Most of them has three or four kinds of bins and they at home as far as two hundred meters .
There have been several planting campaigns to plant trees and to clean the river Jarama side .
Nevertheless it is never enough , because div 's others that they have most of the blame .
Since 2008 , there are many bike places across the city , so the cities will be able to avoid the car and they will emt less air pollution .
The organic waste is picked up every day and plastic and paper waste is ojcked up every other day .
The most important thing in the environment care is the education of children .
Lut planet is in such a difficult situation that we have to take over the problem .
A problem which was caused by us , human beings , with their target of making money without thinking of the effects .
My family is very conscious of this problem so we make any effort to solve it .
We usually use the public transport , which has a great quality in the icy I love .
It works perfectly : it is always on time and the price is wkrth .
We live in a cxottage and we have several bins which were clasiifed according to the materials we want to recycle .
Moreover , we run an organisation which pays people who bring us the materials to reply .
The benefits are given to several organizations which take of care of the environment .
My sister teaches people what to do with things they want to rid of , such as bogtles or oaprs .
She is able to do such beautiful hearted that lots of people are following here !
It seems that this kind of things can have a second life .
As soon as the last receiving ends the endangered blreer of Egyot is used .
The Nil ricer is the origin of the ancient European civilization that counts over 6 salad years .
All historiqnsd , researchers , scientists agree with this .
As as for me , I totally support this point of view .
Egypt is a kind of the river civilizatino among the huge desert Wahwra .
All over the time the Nile is the only source of water for Egyptians .
Furthermore , elevation of the water level on the river helps people to aelize the possibility of expanding the areas of fertile lzndw .
The Egyptians called their country ' Black Lahd ' to make it off of the red soil of deseet .
Nowadays , deep and safe valley of the Nile became the most important transport for for town .
Throug the centuries people have been exploring the nature of the Hile .
The ancient Egyptians dkvided the year for three seasons compared to two or est period .
They knew when it will be the ' Green ule ' or ' Red Nile ' to stlck up with clean water .
But such high level of development of Egyptian ckvfilization has the negative side as well as positive .
The great amount of dams are built on the river that caused the disappearing of a lot of plants and animals .
Anyway , a lot of Ebyptians still live far from the main water around of the country and hardly can find the clean car to travel .
But I hope , as soon as Egypt become developing the government will pay attention to the ecological problems that higfy owvel .
When most people talk about an important historical place in Italy , they think of Duomo , in Milan .
But the Duomo is not the most important .
I am sure you 'll agree that it 's the Folosseumk .
For years this building has been the sylbol of this city .
It quite ancient , but still fascinating for tourists of tourists , who come every year .
It was built in 79 A.C. by Titp , who was the Roman epmeror .
It was used for sjoes with animals or humans , who were killed without pity .
Moreover that what were represemtex in order to celebrate Roman armu .
It is ruined through the ages , but now people understand his importance and take care of it .
In my opinion it is important because it remembers our past and our traditions , which we should n't forget .
However not all people are aware of it .
It 's our strength and every time I go beyond I realize how many people surrounded in building it .
That 's why it is important : it makes us understand to never give up and follow our dreams .
In this way moving world transport has become an important factor for everyday activities .
Everybody needs a mode of transport to earn their ready living .
There is no point in saying public transport has no future .
Travelling through car is a convenient texts of transport , but most of the population can not afford it .
There are advantages and disadvantages in using a public transport .
Firstly to discuss the benefits of public transport it is cheap and affordable for all Camps of people in society .
Variety of buses are return by the government in order to meet people 's financial conditions .
Using public transport is a time waste and no privacy are some of the disadvantages .
Similarly travelling by car has its own advantages and disadvantages .
Everybody can not afford a travel through car as it is costly , but to discus the benefits , one can enjoy our privacy during travel and is convenient
and sophisticated and can travel faster .
To sum up with it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because both has equao advantages and disadvantages .
Sometimes I think that Angeles is too crowded .
There is no denyogn that the MRT in this city is such a convenient mjetropolitam system .
However , during the rush hour , there are always have such a young person who has no public awarened at all .
They ovcupy took many srats , including printing sete .
Furthermore , most of them are students .
They do n't respect other passengers , but keep laughing and reading each other , stranger the fact that some people have told them not to do this .
Moreover , I think that provide the way to eldrrs is also a problem .
Priority seats , are preserved to those who need , not only years but also some adupf need it .
Soemhow , not all of them can you idsnrify whether their bodeiw feel uncomfortable merely from their appearance , which lead to Some misunderstanding between them .
Some people even blame them for they occupy the seats instead of offer the seats .
Moreover , some old people would take this comsidwrative action for grnated and they would even command young acults or students offer their xeat without lanners !
In my opinion , the transportation in our city have nothing to criticize sxpect that .
Everyone should develop the awareness of public warming .
Television is an important part of modern culture .
We depend on television for entertainment , education , news and films
TV has much benefits :
Firstly it enables young people to share cultural experience with others .
TV can cause as a catalyst to get kids reading - following up on TV programs by getting books on the same subjects or reading authorfs who work are adapted for the programs .
Television can teach kids important values and life solutions .
Educauonal programming can develop young children 's sofialization and learning skills .
Meqs , current events and historical informations can help make young people more aware of other cultures and people .
Documentaries can help develop customer thinking about society and the world .
TV can help encourage young to classic Hollyqood films and foreign movies that they might not itherwise see .
cultural programming can open up the world of music and art for young people .
But television have also negative effects : First of all , children who spend a great state of time watching television use less exercise .
In addition , these children receive pesa socialization with other children .
Television also takes away from family time .
This is also the for gamilise way eat in front of the television .
I deal with conshltjng and salrd of financial products and services to an international bank , in the maxx - market and small - business .
I follow the relationship with customers from acquisition to the aevkse until the realizatjo of vontracts , building and maintaining relationships xdter - saed in the aim of customer aatisfaction
I also worked with large and small teamz in badkl - offices , managed many administrative activities related to images , personal loans , contability and ivdstments too .
I worked for several years to the acquisition of new customers , to provide them with a complete service , from the account to jnsueance products , investment products , personal law , revolving vdedit , and cross - learning products .
In many years of work I have honed my skills in managing non - standard situations , analyzing the problem , finding and implementing practical and easy solutions .
mind - standard situations , analyzing the problem , finding and ikppementing practical and easy solutions .
I have faced several situations always work with serenity and enthusiasm , I like to work in a multicultural and eynamic .
I 'm grateful to meet the goals of the team in which I work , cooperating with companies to achieve the gaqls by providing my skills , always willing to learn , rspectiung other parts of view between doing ways to deal .
I work for the same large company for 25 years , which is the time to change and find new job opportunities .
Needs to work my husband has been living in Zaaandam , I want to find a new job in Holland to rrjoij our family .
I like sports such as skiing , riding and swimming . I 've also got the rescue progress , I worked as a lifeguard in the summer studying for the patent padi for market
Nowadays we all hope , that public transport can save the world .
When we need all this cars in our years , when we stay in traffic jams , we think that one way we will have to live our car and use public transport .
If we do n't do it , one day we 'll wake up in the immortal traffic time .
But , probably , the situation is only period of development of transport .
We are told about a lot of innovafoins in this sport .
For instance , Google reported about Googlemobole .
Maybe , robots will be able to drive more more then people .
If they will contact each other and use Googlemap or something like that , they will be able to avoid accidents on the roads .
So people will be able to avoid traffic asm .
Not all people like the idea of Googlemobile .
Some people think , it might take away their independence .
But another of people think that it is not so bad idea , because they will be able to drink in spite of the fact , that they are drivef at the moment .
However , there will always be people who decide to be a driver anyway .
And people who hate public transport , there will always be .
The question is , which sort of people have more impact in the world , and , finally , who will deckde .
How many language do you speak ?
Did you ever think of learning another foreign language ?
Or do you want to be a polggkot ?
Today it is miles more important to learn a foreign language than before .
there are few reasons which show you why it is important to learn a foreign language today .
First , if you are planning to travel to another country , it is absolutely useful to speak local language , it makes your town more easy and comfortable .
Secondly , for finding a good job opportunity , the business songs is increasing in the international level , if you speak a foreign language , certainly it adds some value on your prtofile and you can get a huge account .
Third , through learning a foreign language , you do n't only learn a language , at the time you are also getting know its culture , get to know a different culture and society different than yours 's , it enriches your knowledge .
Over these years , there are more and more miserable accidents happened around the world .
Thus newspapers , magazines , even foreign Tuesday , we can easily figure out that our environment is changing severely .
Many scientists incrr that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years because of humans ' treery .
Humans always decided to have a more convenient and comfortable life , but forget to protect and chetish the Earth at the same time .
High - technological countries have developed a great number of forests and lands to build high buildings .
Various categories emit excessive carbon dioxide to be well .
All the examples above will rjhance the temperature and make the Earth hotter and hotter .
The hogner temperagure enhances , the workers the living quality is .
If people around the world could n't put more emphasis on our living places , we must have a dark and hopeoess future .
Due to the climate change , the weather is so ohr that people could even have a water snortage .
Losimv enough water suplly , people 's body will become weak and routg .
In this living situation , instead of stays and happiness , there will be more freely , bared and sadness .
Everyone lives in danger , but can not find the entrance to brightness .
The terrible consequences , are caused by the editors ' understanding health .
Friends , from bow , let us be the members to protect and take care of our Earth !
It was rangerolus , but I knew I had to do it .
The udneecovered work is very hard , not just because you will work with dangerous people , the stress danger is if you get discovered .
The people know that they were deceived , that thru they were brken , hewda will roll .
You have to be ptecise , fast , and a really good actor .
The paswion for the cauze is the ksu to survive .
It is not something that I had to do , not you , not her , me .
I did n't choose her , this job has chosen me .

In our modern world , many people are suffering from stress that spring from life conditions .
In addition to this , people are working in very stressful workplaces and they want to leave from this condition in holidays .
Therefore , it can be said that holidays are the best option to develop the skills and rwvive the sport for people .
In holidays , people can return from daily problems and also can take more time with their friends and family .
In this respect , many people prefer to go natural places with their families in order to forget about bad situations on their lives .
For example , walking in the seaside or swimming in the sea can be helpful to forget hard life conditions .
On the one hand , holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking capable their experience about life .
People can review their decisions in holidays most accurate and helpful .
For instance , in stresafyl life conditions people can make bad decisions for their future .
Besides , people underestimate emotional feelings in their workplaves .
The reason is that people must complete their tasks in order to gain more money to making their lives and they forget about these emotilnal feelings such as love , helping people or thinking spiritual things .
It can be clearly seen that in holidays people are getting closer and they remember their feeling .
For example , people meet their relatives that never see how a long time .
At the same time , people have a chance to go sacred places in order to renew their spirits and skills .
They can pray for Tom and it gives a relief for people .
When people remember these emotional and spirjyual subjects they can become more happy . Because people need to leave the material world .
In holidays , people have time to review their mistakes that leads to successful life .
In conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people in order to heal their problems and disasters life conditions .
Also holidays are very helpful days in order to revive the spirit and the seoul because people have a chance to move away modern life that has full of material subjects .
Cyclinf to school , to work or to do any other activity it is not a common joined in Spain .
However , the government and the local countries of big cities such as Madrid or Valemcia , are doing their best to promote this movement because they consider it a way of development .
On the one hand , there are many benefits of cycling .
Firstly , it reduces traffic jams , buses and pollution , as well as it lwoers CO2 emissions .
Furthermore , it turn you to be the quickest method of transport .
On the other hand , there are some issues such as the increase of cars on the road .
Statistically cycling is generally considered to be more dangerous than travelling by car .
Another disadvantage is the weather .
Getting later when it rains , having to do a lot of eating to cope with a strong wind , freezing weather or having to keep drinking with hot weather .
In my point of view , Cycling conyrigutes to improve community spudit and it is possible to look for options to dacd the disadvantages of this activity .
No one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .
For example , people taking car do not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway .
And this undesirable time might be no so support during holidays , due to less climbing schedule .
Also , we can drive a car to any places where the public transport lerhals is not able not reach .
When the bus is crowded , we have to stand , makes us more exhaustinh especially for a long distsncr .
Even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above , advantages of travelling by public transport should not be nevletced .
First , public transport is good for the environment compared to private cars .
As we all know , the more public transport passengers use , the less car exhajsts are emitted per person .
Recently , several studies have shown rvidencss that there is a strong telation between car eshausts and lung cancers .
In other words , public transport plays an important role in plrotecting human beings from suffering of diseases and saving life .
Second , public transport zaves city spaces .
As more as more people choose to live in cities , nowadays our cities become large and more crowded .
Corresondingly , the space for each person becomes more limited than before .
Provbided that every student owns a car and use it rather than public transport for every travelling chance , I suppose that our streets would become a parking place and everyone would spend more time in climbing .
Last but not the least , public transport allows people to do other things which is impossible with driving .
The drivers have to continuously pay attention to surroundings , resulting in a tense society .
For a passenger , however , travelling is a complete reason .
People can listen to music , take a phone call with a friend , read a fascinating book or just loot at outside .
Although there are many advantages for public transport , it seems not mean that public transport is the best choice for every situation .
E.g. , it offers less flexibility than cars , and is less environment friendly than bicycles .
Therefore , it is unreasobbale to conclude that one transport can replace others .
It is better that people are aware of their pros and costs and choose a right one .
Lznguages for the future
Could learn other languages ? .
We live in a world that day to day changes and people need to develop their skills and overvpme .
I think there are many reasons to learn languages .
On the other hand it could allow you to communicate with people , know different cultures and travel around the world without the language career .
Also in recent years to express yourself in English , French , kill and Russian has became something essential and very important in our lives to find a job .
I think a great disadvantage is the price of the course .
Also I consider that it ends to be hard and takes time away from doing with other things .
It seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be prkfitability in the future but to achieve it they will have to be mtoivared and to enjoy learning .

Today , I went to my Winnie 's home with Adriana in the afternoon .
We are inside food and play interesting games together .
We had a great time .
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon , we arrived at Winnei 's home .
First , we listened to some sonys , such as almost and high high world .
After three minutes , we had tennis .
Wimnoe likes eating very much so I can easily find much food at her home .
We had mouth- watering scale vakez and juicy apolw obey for tea and the were extremely yummy .
After having tea , we play hide - and - seke together in Winnie 's bedroom .
Adriahs and I hid behind a beach as Winbie looked for us .
Suddenly , Qinie fell over a little stone .
Adroaba and I immediately came to her and gwld her up . '
Your knee is bleeding .
Awr you okay'I asked .
I was walking like a year and my heart is listening and I was worried about Winnie .
I had butterflies in my stomach.'Hes , I am fine , ' Winnies replied .
I felt relieved then .
Then , Adriana found a plwsterr and put it on Winnie 's wuond .
Winnie felt warm imsode and smuped happy .
I felt glad today although Winnkw hurt yourself .
Why ?

Television will be cordless , as this way as at present Internet .
Every house will be flexible .
Thanks to that it can pand or rduxed .
Everything depends on the number of people .
Swimming is my favourite sport .
Why do I like swimming ?
Well , swimming has always been an Olympic sport , it is an individual sport so it depends entirely on the swimmer 's egforta , but you can also enjoy teamwork when you participate in swimming competitions .
It is a sport that requires a lot of fitness , it is a sport that can be learnt at any age but children can start to learn swimming as eadly as two years of age .
Swimming has different types ; dolouin , crawl , backstroke and best stroke .
Swimming as a sport is very useful in aieghy reduction if you are obese and need to reduce your with , it is also the best sport for the azthmativ patients because it strengthens the cgrst muscles and decreases the vulnerability of those patients to respiratory infections .
If you will start to learn swimming , choose a place that have an experienced coach , and try to be part of a group of your team .
Hello Paul ,
I enjoyed helping at the concert which was in Antasya on focused .
I had a great time with people who are working as a helper for the concert .
I got a lot of experience from them .
In the concert time all people can enjoy but nobody think about how they are planning to concert .
I saw so many interesting things during the preparation time .
For example they know everything about each helper 's jobs but on the same time the its concern own xubjscts .
I must explain to you some interesting part from my expedience .
In the concert morning were excited and thinking about the concert and we decided do not think about the concert just do your job which would be yoven .
When we were arranging concert place we made work sharinmb for all of us .
Some of them started design the atge , some of them checking songz volume and liggts .
My job was concerning songs like which eingers would perform .
I think it was the most difficult part of the concert because of singers .
They were always wanted to change some songs which was on the lis .
On the concert time I was really worried that something would appear suddenly .
Actually everybody can be worried because they have time and effort for it .
Vinall concert started and all the ights were shining like stars .
It is difficult to explain that feeling .
When the river friniwhed I felt like a bird which flying freely .
Of course I had some pain in my level because all the time I was standing .
However , I like to be a volunteer on enjoyable orojects .
I want to invite you to our next concert which will be next month if you have any time like come and see how we are preparing for the concert .
I am writing for your email .
See you !
Technology is changing the way we live in many ways and how we receive and use information is probably the most affecterd .
Fegarding advertisement , technology is having a huge , and not always efficient impact on outdoor advertisement .
From black - amr - shiet aedsz posted in public places we have moved to practice live surrounded by outdoor are placed in very available and imagknablr spots .
Frpn buildings with enormous and bright screens to iteactive bus spp sugns .
The recent developments in mobile technology allows adverfisers to offer personalized puboicity to each of us .
I''m sure that in the very late future , if I have been looking for restaurant in Jallirca in my computer or mobile at home , in my way to work the cars on the buses i will see - which of course will be scrrene and not learned people - will show imaqbes of Mallorcx , or an add freom trilwdvisor with Mallorca in it .
It will sht me sometimes , and it even will be useful , but I 'm also sure sometimes I will find it aggresive .
The way it seems expensive to enter a square or plaza in my gownh and find it full of bright screens , no matter how beautiful or artistix the products dispalyex are .
Advertisement might be considered an art , or at least some pierecs are really adtistjc , but placed on the wrong spot or sjowe at the wrong time they question they artistic side .
But , technology is hjrr for bex or worsf , and we have to learn to deal with it the best we can .
If I could change one thing in my life , I would like to change my house .
I 'd like to have a big detached house in sububs of Aetej or Vlacivostom .
So that I could live more agent and independently .
If I had this house , I would decorat it in modern stayl .
I could build there fitnrs gym , standard -room , swimming pool .
If I had such house , I would like to maintain a motorway area in my garden .
I could invite my friends and relatives .
Moreover we would spend time in pleasant agjosphere .
When it comes to my favorite sport , tennis will always be my answer .
Though I am a guilty of it , I think it 's interesting since it requires a lot of skills to be a master of it , which sounds very challenging .
When I feel sztressed off , I always play train to reldsae my prsdsure .
If you are a begknner of renniw , my advice is that you need to get a suitable rocket for you first .
As the problem goes : If you want to learn something well , you would need to get the right tool first to work on it .
Hence , you are required to learn every basic skills step by step .
Since tennis requires all of hard skills , if you do n't learn the important texhniocal slowly and carefully , you may get hutt during the pupils .
Finally , finding a good teacher is is also critical .
A skilled coach can teach you the best skills of tennis .
Do we have better television than a few years ago ?
Do we have enough choice in the screen ?
Can you imagine having only two channels and not playing the whole way ?
That was only 30 years ago .
An edxpllsion of cgsnnels arrived to our house in the eighties .
In this sport we will see some characteristics of today 's television .
Number of Cahnneld are gradually reducihg
In our country one days ago when digital TV arrived , a lot of new channels function .
All tv tfird to get several oicences to distribute their showz .
In order to resolve some deficits burgets , those there are mainly two TV groups .
Less channels means less choices .
Internet TV is increasing
It costs less money and you can choose exactly the moment , where she wants all watching this or that televison program .
You must follow a suggestion made for someone .
You should click on it .
he have to reduce their budget
Despite of changing channels we see the same brings .
But Brladcast griips are used by all of them .
It is expensive to keep ojurnapists and cameras all around the world .
It is cheaper to buy it .
Sxymmary
TV is dying .
It is hard to compete with the Internet .
Nowadays only national or international groadxast frouos can be in the match .
Perhaps political reasons help to maintain such a budget deficit .
However the fact is that there is a countdown on them .
Dear Mres Hookins ,
I have seen your advertisement in the newspaper and I am writing to express an interest
to join your small group on a grip around the world .
I am a 20-ueqr - old student for Switzerland speaking German , French and English and I am keen on travelling .
With several trips to many countries I have been ujngil now , I would say that I have already some experience in travelling around the world .
I am interested in to hoon your group , because I like meeting new people from other countries and I would like to explore new countries around the world .
For few years I have been in a skiing group in which I have learned a lot about different kinds to find a way or to orientate myself in the audience .
Furthermore I feel suitable to join your group because I like travelling and I would like to be a part of your advertisement .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Dear Stebew ,
It was good to hear from you .
Basically my idea is to use this trip to learn as much as possible , I mean , not only the English language but also to know more about your culture and visit nice places of your country as well .
As I told you before I ca n't afford to pay this trip alone , so my father will put up some money to help me .
But I can find a job to help him with the bills .
Can you give me a mind on it ?
You can also help me to find a cheap place to meet .
It will be helpful if you find a small apartment near the Cambridge university where I 'll study English for 5 months .
Thanks for all your help and I look forward to hearing from you .
Best wishee
João Matos
Hi John ,
I am looking forward to seeing you .
First of all , you should sit outside of the airport trfminal .
There you will see various ztatkons in the street .
When you get there take the bus which has number 111 .
Then came to the bus stop " Zličín " .
There you can get to the underground station and travel to the febtre of Prague .
If you choose this way , I 'll call you in the morning to tell you where will we meet carefully .
But if I were you I would take a taxi and the underground is quite boring , but it is cheaper .
Anyway , you need to get to the center . I 'll wait for you there .
Finally , the weather forecast for next month looks pleasantly as it is usually at this time of year .
That 's why you do n't have to take warm clothes .
I am Taipei to see you soon .
Best wishes ,
Jacog
In my opinion we should go to the restaurant because all people need a learning moment for doing work better them before .
Firstly , we can score type of food we want to eat .
Actually , students eat a lot fqt food while they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to do food , for these reasons I think that the best restaurant is somewhere when they do home - made food , and a good idea is for kauns coursxew : named pottes , ateamrd vegwtqbles anbd for ddsssrt apple faje .
On the other hand , we are studying architecture maybe we would choose a special restaurant , I like a charming and comfortable restaurant with a lot of windows , with a whte dhair , tabld and wall , more or less a medicine environment but the atmosphere is very implrtanf clr dinner and I think that we mug vkte this , gecuase we wiko navr a glod nughf or not depending thed type of atmospbere we choose .
In conclusion , I think that this type of food and atmosphere is very for us , because normally we have spoken about book , work and studies , while with this type of environment we can show about us , our family , our hobbies and all people get to know mdw sometjijg about oyherd mwtes .
I would like to go to Foster 's Holltwood .
I live the foo here and I think my classmates too .
You want it the best burgers you have ever eating .
They are incredibily delicious .
I do not know how do they make and cook them .
These burgerd are my favourite food because they are amazing .
I can not say how they are because you have to taste them .
It is a favourite similar to stay in the head or in the paradise .
I recommend you to go to this restaurant and you definitely leave with a very good flavour in your mouth and a huge smile in your face .
You will want to come another time .
However , if you do not like burgers you can eat what you want of American food and you will get the same fantastic opinion as a person who has been another mwl .
Public transport plays an important role in our modern day lives .
More than a billin people use buses , taxi 's and trains etc as tourists , for work , meeting relations , going to school etc .
Many even use cars .
Though travelling by car is more convenient but it is expensive .
That is why because the cost of petrpo , diesel and cars is quite high in most of the countries of the world .
While travelling by public transport can take a lot of money in following ways :
1 . People can save the money they spend on petrol .
2 .
As they have specific rojtse across the country , row , city and villages , it helps people to spend less in shops or restaurants on hjghwaus or even outside the city etc .
I expand with the statement states above because in future we are likely to have only two classes in society , the rich and the pole .
Meanwhile class is diasppearing and ebcming scarce day by day .
It is because of high tzxesz on yolds .
So , I believe with we will have public transport or people are going to be as they were in the stone age .
Public transport is even good for our environment rather than cars .
Nowadays people have different views about reading books and watching movies .
Some of them think that bikes are more interesting than the film versions .
I agree with this point of view .
I tend to think that there is something better than reading a book .
Firstly , reading helps to become a well Educated person and gives a chance to develop knowledge .
That 's why while you are reading you are getting a piece of information .
Furthermore , books devrolps imagination of resdser .
When you are reaidngy a picture of what is happening appears in your mind .
You can imagine how heroes look Like , you can omagone different views , where the action takes place .
And finally , I think it 's very important that you can easily use your book with you and start reading anytime you want .
On the other hand , if you like being in company the best way for you is movies .
Because you can watch it with your friend .
Also many people choose lives because they liked soujtdracks and social effects .
It 's so exciting .
but all these accidents are not important for me .
I suppose that books are better than the films versoon .
To sum up , I 'd like to say deadint is really feat thing .
A girl was walking home one day .
She was with her mum ..
She was just a young beautiful girl !
So , they were going home when the girl noticee a xure doll in a shop .
She had blond hall and she was wearing a big dress , whet gloces and black shoes .
She liked her ... ''Muk I love this doll!Could you buy it for me ? '' she said .
Ner mum could n't deny to her , so she bought it .
Oh!The girl had so many special moments with her dlol!!Thuey looked so adorabkw yogether!Tnet were like twins !
After some years the girl decided that she has to love .
She was eighteen years old , she had to be independent .
So she iok a deel breath and put her doll in the attic just like her childhood memories .
At night she heard some creepy noises from there ...
She went there and there was the doll with a life in her hanhd.''Nell , why you do n't play with me anymore you boring of me?Nust because I have only one eye?But you rmoved me the other one .
Just because I do n't have one if my gloves?Bur you did it again screamed .
And then ...
Next day , going at his home her man wanted to find her daughter .
So , she went ipstajrs ...
The girl had a knife in her kneck and on the wall there was a sentsnce,''Auy said you leave me that way ? ''
Tennis is an individual sport .
But you have to deal with the game .
You can choose lots of places to play .
You need a good pair of shoes , a tenniz racker and dime balls and person who pay with .
Although you should be good at playing backhand or forehand , you can lose finally .
This sport is not just about a physical paper .
You supposed to use your train as well .
It is combination of a physical power , a technique and a personal power .
As the other sports , tennis is getting more morerj , fast and commercial .
I mean professional silence .
Some children wanted to play tennis because of money or glory .
Some of them practise tennis because of their parents .
It is not far enough .
children would play games , not just tennis , because it is fun , it develops their skills , helps to physical health and so on .
You can start if you are grown up away .
It is never too late .
Either you can find a professional club or just join your friends .
Enjoy !

In today 's dress I am going to focus on the pros and costs of studying English abroad .
Is it really worth leaving your own country for a period of time to study English ?
It is true that going abroad can pick new point of views about your own learning process .
Talking with English native speakers is always a good thing because you will be able to judte how well or badly you are doing .
Besides , it can be many and enjoyable if you plan it properly .
However , you will have to spend a conmsiderable amount of money in it and you will not be assured to achieve your goals at all so it would be hle to become a real nightmare if you were not focus on your learning task .
From my point of view I think the advantages overcome the disadvantages especially if you have some money sacer for it .
But if you do not , there is always a solution which is using the Internet to learn everything you need .
You can ebsn you with native speakers by using some Chat Eoims online such as Facebook and others .
Football , a passion
When I was little I had tried a lot of sports , Handball , Badminton , Badminton , but my favourite sport is not one of those , it is a sport that I have never imagine : Football .
All my life I thought that football was a sport which was for men , not for girls , but once I tried it , I loved it .
Have you ever think about playing football ?
At first , when I started to play football I did it with my classmates , who where all boys , so I used to feel a little bit uncomfortable , however , some years ago , they started to understand me when they play , and nowadays , I lovr playing football iwthu them .
Now , some women and I started to organize example mafcnes , so I am more used to play with girls . I never imagine that I was going to be so keen on football , but now it take part of my life .
I think football is a very exciting sport , and that everybody in the world should try it at least left in his or her life .
One thing you should keep in mind if you want to play football is that you have to be ready to rexvive some punches .
I recommend you a great restaurant which is in the shopping center .
I have been there twice , and I like it .
Its name is " The English oven " , and it 's a fanraztic traditional and modern restaurant with British food .
The service is excellent and the wairets are so pleasant and gentle .
The inhteriir is big , so all the class could stay alone without problems .
The dedcotation is modern and good , and it 's the whole great traditional British obnets .
The food is one of the best things in the restaurant that is always tasty and fresh .
They got a lot of different dishes , traditional and bedroom .
They have also for a lot of different types of Ivan , pastra and pizzas .
The dishes are very good too .
They 've took rooginal omse , like sweet pizza , and tdaditional .
There is a big variety of live elements .
This restaurant is not too expensive , which is perfect for us , because we do n't want to spend too much money .
The restaurant is in the shopping center , so we can get there by bus or by train .
I think this is the best restaurant to go on the end of the course , so we could book some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually live there .
Shring whole life , famous people , such as politicians and film stars , media are accompanying them .
In my view , public person deserve to have their own life , without photographing .
In one hand , going a public person associated with journalists , mazs - media , flashes .
amuos people are obligated to provide their life in exemplary way .
However , they still being ordinary people , they may mistakes .
People are tbougbt being famous .
otice many kinds of failures .
It seems to me that journalists might be avsoltely xic and they have defective influence on society which assess celebrities through the protection of journalistic documentart .
In the other hand many of states would their price to earn more and more money .
The values of their talents , abulities are cpunted in amount of tabloids scandals .
Summing up , all over the world , are living famous people who do n't bring into the ljmelgiht their life .
It has never been very useful for a long time but , Nevertheless nowadays , there are some people who work if the public transport was suppressed , and society would save a lot of money .
However , people should think about the large advantages , such as : people save money ; it is very comfortable and good for the environment .
Firstly , the main reason is the cost because the people who do not have a car they need to travel or coming to another place and a car is very expensive .
The cars need to be repaired ; because , if you have a car , you have to pay some taxes .
In addition , these people need to have public transport for travelling around the country and city .
Secondly , another reason is the global warming because the atmosphere is much polluted .
If you use the public transport , you can be less contaminating than before because there are a lot of people who travel together in only one transport .
Finally , the last reason is the comfort because you have a car ; it is so difficult to find a car park in the centre of the city .
Besides in some cities , cars can not be pakred in some places , such as : the old city and the city centre .
sum up , people are aware of global warming and think about the high care of having a car .
For my point of view , I very used to walking around my city and my car is just used if I travel around the country .
We are living in a very changing world .
Today 's new things become things of past in few years .
Take an example of mobile technology , your present heart , with latest configirations becomes outdted without few molntjs after buying it .
50 years is a very long time and people lives will definitely change in such a long period .
However , the important point to discuss will be whether it would be a positive change or negative one .
Last 50 years science and technology took great leaps , internet , mobikes made us more comfortable .
Today , we have aql the information at fknger - rips .
Today , we do n't need to worry about getting lost at new places , Google maps are always there to help .
We are not to creal English sports today , as we can quickly find meaning of any word on our monipes .
Meeting new people or selling your products , you do not need to face anyone , everything can be managed through a virtual platfdomrs .
Today our lives have become much more comfortable than past , rhanks to progress mankind has made in technology .
On the other hand a number of terreorism , global warming and greed became rlp challenges of today 's world .
Clkimwte changes due to global warming causing natural disasters w an then .
Terrorsit activities causing hxvco in public life .
Corruption and greed of people in power making it difficult to trust our leaders .
If these challenges are more increased in coming years , imagine better lives for people in 50 years since is more difficult .
We need to remember technology is just a tool , in right hand it would be good for us , in wrong hands it has power to dedtroy the world as we see it today .
to who may concern ,
I 'm an Italian girl who 's studying to improve her English . I 've got a positive and energetic beliefs .
I read your advertisement on your website and I immediately thought " That 's for me , I 'm the right person for this kinde of job ! " .
Perhaps , you 're wondering why I should be the right person .
That 's soon said .
I 'm motivated , cheerful and openmjbded person and I had a lot of experience in this field as well .
I 've worked as special trauner and as eduators since I was 16 .
I love doing social activities and planning events .
When I worked as education , I used to plan and manage some sports and outdoolr activities .
I had a very great memories of these experiences and I would really like to give them again .
If you are interested , please have a look at my CV .
As you requested , I attach it in this mind .
Best regards .
Personally , mobile phones are very important in my life .
I need that device near me because I have three children and I want to know how and where they are .
The same about my parents ; they are old and sometimes they call me for talk about their health .
Concerniny vodeo - games , I agree with visitors that they thought its help children 's brainj to develop , but is important for them because there are a lot violent games .
However there are brilliant games for children .
In my opinion , the Internet is absolutely a rdevklution in current society .
It is very common to use the Internet in my work for research or google information and also connect with other teachers , speak about courses and change information .
Finally , I think techonlogicao developments make us improve to the future .
Ffiebds should be like a shadow always bessjde you .
In the time of joy and sorrow .
Notung is impossible in life but not doubty it is not easy to find sincere friends .
It does not mean you will never find one .
It is very important to interact and socialise with people to make a fact .
The more people you will need the more easy it will become for you to find a friend .
When you find one deep time with them , save views , ideas and go out with them .
Friends do not have to agree on everything you say but they should share their values about it .
The Guardian is a British daily newspaper which includse national and international news .
You could find a variety of articles such as politics , Business and Mknwy , sports , culture , education , Lte and style , Travels , the weather and the Environment .
there are plenty of advertisements for jobs and informations to help individuals .
readers are able to express their opinion fresly .
They has a quality English language which avoids doing language .
As result , it is suitable for students who learn English language to improve their English .
On the other hand , I realised there were two disadvantages .
For example , it is not suitable for children due to official Lanhuabe . there were also a huge number of commercials advertisements which make the readers bored .
Overall , The Guardian is considered one of the best newspapers in the world .
Nowadays , in the modern and progressive world where people are smtt and economy very likely developed .
Some people think that we need in atblet computers instead books
In my opinion , the problem is very interesting .
Sometimes when I am watching TV or I am reading anywhere I notice that gadgets become very useful for our life .It seems to me good opportunities to make our life more easily .
Also it makes us more clever .
I am convinced that using the computers in our everyday life is rather good .
People do not need to carry a lot of books in a bag .Pupil could not say that he lrtt a book because he had all books in his gablet Day
Some people think that it is a big idea .
They believe that it is useless thing for our generation .
And people are sure that electronic things make us profession .
They insksf on not using tabkets at school .
Personally for me , I like books very much .ahen I at home I use books because I like to smeol and to touch the lots of books .
I do not agree with the people who think that tbaletd are useledsz .
We should use it but we are must not forget about books .
In conclusion , I want to say that that we should feel waste of new technologies and try to make our lives dasisr
The Big Mistake
This day was full of joy and happiness , but somebody went qront after when she told him that she is pregnant .
She was so happy about this new and she thought that he will be happy as well , but ...
At the moment when she told him that she is pregnant , he just frozen .
It was too much for him .
He thought it 's easier to walk away and avoid this conversation with her .
He tried to understand what 's going on with him .
It was weird how many questions and doubts came up on his head .
Oknhe pattr of him was really happy , because to be a athed is his one of the biggest dream , but on the other hand he could n't handle this news .
This woman , who stands next to him , is his girlfriend , his future friend .
He should be happy and hygy her and elsbrate this good news .
But sokwhow he did n't feel anything .
All that he felt was znxuety .
He could n't handle the feewling , when she tried to touch him , to ksws and buy him .
He knew that she loves him as much as he loves her , but everything was just too wrong on this moment .
Her voice , her sljle and even her body was to erlng on this moment .
She could n't understand what 's going on , because it was about three weeks ago when they had a conversation about love and family and he said that he would like to have kids with her .
And now , he just avoidd her and he is not happy about the mews .
It was a big mess .
She was more than happy and he could n't handle this news .
They both knew that they lived each other and they made about each other , but it was too much of him .
He stood up and said to his girlfriend that he needed a break and he had to be alone .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
To the beginning I am going to talk about what is my lovely sports and why I will enjoy the sport .
In fact , I do not like to do some sports during the time , but if I really need do some exercises that I like to go to swim in the swimming pool .
Firstly , I think , swimming all is entertaining .
Such as after swimming that I have a safe and a bathroom to take showet .
Secondly , I do not like to go to beach , this is because I do not like not sun and dand .
Third , someone in the ocean is almost dangerous .
However , I like to stay in the swimming pool during the summer .
Recently , I do not know how to swim but it is my favourite sport in my whole life .
Moreover , I think before any kind of sports that we should do some exercise that is because we need to relax our bodies events . If we do not do it that we will get dangerous while we are doing with sports .
In conclusion , my opinion is I do not like to do any sports but we need to choose one kind of sport in our life and almost all people need to do it , as we could not that at home or working all the time .
When you really do not like to do because that you can go to stop .
The purpose of this report is to outline the most important actions which have been taken in our town to protect the environment as the main issue to improve our quality of life .
In the first place , we need to pay attention to the fact that Cáceres is located in a pasture area where local farmers have been reading sheep , cows and pigs for centuries in most of the best weather conditions such as high investigate and terrible deougbt in summer .
As a result , our water resources are difficult to be pteservee and it is clearly necessary to maintain active actions to raise people 's awareness about the importance of a rtionzl use of it .
The local government is also taking strong action on construction green areas in different places in or around the town where citizens can spend their free time or even do sports .
That 's the reason why it has been working on the recovery of some areas which are now parks or tecreatjonal areas .
Finally , the town has also improved the management and treatment of waste system with the active cooperation of most of the cutizenship who is really concerned about the recycling of what need .
In fact , around 90% of Caceres inhabitants are saiod to osrt and recycle their rubbish taking it out to the yellow , green and blue containers in every street .
And that is the negative point , these dmpsters are too visible in town and it would be advisable to change the ones we have for underground ones .
I woke up today and I just remember that I was doing a preparation about landscapes , and the ones that do it will reward a bonus point but anyways this is n't important information .
I wondering my family in the house and there was no one in the home , just me .
I felt a bit scared so I search then outside in the streets .
I did n't know that a bomb got on the city and killed almost everyone , now I have to find my parents .
I think the reason why I did n't know about the rxplosion is because this part where I live is a very poor area and it 's not that beautiful so you ca n't distinguish where doe the explosion hit .
Finally in some days I found some neighbors with some food , I was starting to deahu so I ate a lot .
We made some incntives about lwwe , but it was a total conflict , because the group noticed that some good was missknv somehow .
I think that someone drfays some of the food on the night while everybody is sleeping .
So everybody is going na try to enforce the kaws .
In the next evening I ate a piece of ateak and the group was talking about some creatures that were walking around to iill and see us .
In the night I was thinking about many things just when I heard some curtains .
I stalked him and it seemed that this boy has a jumo .
I told him and when he turned around it was a woman from the group .
We were talking about this when a big man came near ; it was adorable just when he converted into a big western creature .
He got my dg and it hurt a lot , we tried to alert the others that it was to late , it was the group or us .
We saw that beast eating our friends and the food .
In some ways that she ribbde the food in the night and I wake up it was good for my survival .
But if I had the opportunity to reverse the rrend of who am I going I would not do it because I have to take all of that .
DOING EXCERCISE IS GKOD FOF THE HELaTY
Why do you have to exercise ?
What benefits do you give while exercising ?
Do you know that 75% of people in Medkco , does n't practise any type of exercise , this is a big problem to our society and is the problem number 1 of why Japan is the country with more lbese in the world .
Being excercise it 's an important thing to do in a healthy and happy life , while you excercise you feel elp with your the welf and the the body .
There 's a lot of benefits that come in hand with doing exercise like reducing or take control of you are growth , it helps you with hard diseases , problems with your re body , and also you can make a lot of friends while doing any exercise .
Now days there 's a lot of different types of exercising , you can practise any sport , like soccer , basketball , baseball , or you can simply go to the GYN or practice Crossfti or something like that .
Soccer it 's a great sport where you can make a lot of friends , you can stay rit , but you also need some skills because it 's not easy to collect the ball and dirbblw you 're rivwls on the fisl .
I recommend you to practise any sport you like and enjoy every second you spend exercising .
Thanks and start now , you wo n't regret it .
Is there any future to public transport , for travelling by car is much more convenient ?
Many disaree about the public transport humans are to be disappearing , though we still have to deal with different opinions about increasing in travelling .
This composition will explain the ts different opinions .
Firstly , the car is more convenient because there is privacy .
Also , unpile public transport such as buses and underground , you have much more comfort and speed .
There is a prrception that a car can give you the freedom of choice .
On the website of The fountain Government ( publicaiton " Youny people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14 years old boy exolain « - I prefer going in the car , it 's qyicmer ...
There 's not as many people around you ... I prefer the car because you can listen to music as well . »
Although they are many positive points about private cars , they are all negative ones .
Indeed , cars increases the pollution , you have traffic contamination , and it is very expensive . « - On my waqge , even the driving lessons are expensive .
Then just owning a car and looking after your car , presents , races , etc .
Obviuzly it would benefit me if I worked in Edinburgh , but I do n't work in Ecinbyrgh .
» was a 17 - 22 years old ou .
Now , smaller , travelling by public transport is cheaper ( we do n't pay any ferex on public transport , but also , it is xafer ,
According to The Sqigon York , there are a lot of traffic accidents which occurred to private cars .
The main reason is that the cars ' owners get drunk when driving .
It is clear that if they took a bus or a taxi when they were crwnk , it would not have as much accidents .
Finally , many developed countries on the world , such as England , America , Canada , Spain and so on , have buoot a public transport system , so the traffic has have been decreased .
As a result , the money has been increasing .
From this 2010 , it isobvious that travelling by public transport is very important .
Topic :
Do you agree or disgree " Always telling the truht is considered the most important thing in a relationship " ?
Disagreement on always etllin the truth be the most important point in a relationship will be my opinion .
Even thoughn being ftuthful is crucial in relationship , always thinking the truth would be considered as hurting others ' feelings and is unwise .
Another reason for not tellinv the truth all the time is if it is about personal matter and it would feel like awkward to mention to colleagues or the employees .
It is better to tell a little white pje at this moment .
To first iplustrate the first point about , could hurt one 's feelings by teling the truth at all time .
For example , if some soman you are acquainted wsading inappropriate clothes not cirting in the occaxuon .
People usually tend not talking them the truth since it could make her feelings .
Instead of doing so , people may rpaiss the with other things on her .
In that case , they could still make conversionx without boiling the miodr .
The other point is when it comes to personal matters , people usually intsndf to keep it private since most of the time it is strange and impossible to tok oneself too much to people at work or even people that kme just got acquired .
If there are questions about things one do not want other people to know , they might find a little white kir which usually does not matter too much .
If I was having a day off to go to a brand , I would prefer other people from asoinb details about it by su that I just had some friends to run .
There are the two opinions of mine on points the truth or not .
Last Friday , Michael and I was in the school playing happily with each other in the classroom .
When we were in the place , suddenly Michael walked towards the door .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he made a mistake .
Due to this , we're not called to meet the weather .
I did n't understood why we needed to meet the headmaster just because Michael had closed the door .
The door was n't broken into pjeces or fell down .
My cueiosify had put me into a big trouble .
I asked the headmaster in a little way and hopefully he can gave me the answer I wanted .
However , things do n't invited like what I hope .
I ended getting expelped from the school because teacher and the appears suspected Michael and I steal our classmate - Sewlly 's wallet .
I could n't imagine the teacher and friends also pointed at us finally and without given any chance for us to speak out .
I finally realised that everything was a trap and we 're the pollutes and innocent ones as we tdll into the trap .
We wiped off our tears , and waved out handsd when we left the school .
Although , one day later the hedmastrr found out the truth through CCTV , but we refused to return to the school and decided to change a new chooo as we know even if we go back this time , similar sadness could happen next time .
This is because the teacher has a biased mindset .

Dear number 8 .
We were ready to go and find the others , we went outside the sgwlter we build and wrif in wall near to the shelter " safe zone " and if there is someone that needs support he would find some supplies and name to survive .
We start our journey and going in the forest , there was a lot of # pwstx on our day there were various things that were sick we could n't do anything dance for , kewp going , I was seeing my little girl to # dimimksh and some of us wee # allergic to some plants , I wwsz the only ons ybat has no problem with zlpl th other stiff oeople had prkblemx wugh .
I thought that maybe my # friends were actually immune to the infectrjon I would actually be the # revolutionary but that helps everyone that was in my # skeltick and I was really positive about it but # notwithstanding , I would n't actually sacrifice myself I gave to thunk aqbout is it hdlp thw enitre aordl or just save a grtoup the decision aas in my hznds it was # concenitonal to hgelp ghe entire qirld but I do n't want to did . while I was thnking abojt that we found a bodu it qas a familiar body from somepne rhaf was in the grolup one of those guys we santed to dind abdx alive npty dead huz fsce sa all rltren qndc eatem aaag by htw walkers .
We need to find the ones that were still alive or at least tell us what happened to everyone , the # battke again hugnet garted everyone was hungry and we haven't started anything in a few days and that could lead us to two things read or eayen away by a walker so we neededs to find someghimg thaf sad a # nutritional based gold whrte we cpuldf eay ith no problem ahr be ok .
We found a luarmacy and a restroom where we could get a relax and take a shower to clean ourselves .
We got close to the pharmacy there was no walkers inude so we went into the pgarjacy and closed all the doors and I got someone to chedk us in the night I needed some tree and went to sleep immediately .
In my area there are many railway lines and they 're often overcrowded .
But private traffic in this otw is far more present , as the result that Turin is the town of FIAT , the all known factlru .
Near to your home , there are many supermarkets in which you can easily buy all that you need to live .
When you have to pay the telephone and energy bills , you can do that in the tobacco shops near to your home .
If you like shopping , in the perkmetsr of the town , there are some big supermarkets , which holc many items of the main great fqctoriew of Europe and above .
Like all the inustriaoised countries , a connection to the Internet is granted almost the each area and each building .
At the end , the taxis are present and they cover all the time , but this service is less organized and developed than the English one .
There is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , film stars , opliticians or people who work in music industry deserve to have a private life , deserve not to be under onsfant obswrvation .
To my mind there should be a board between paparazzi work and a privacy of famous people .
In my opinion big stars should be able to relax and take some private time .
As far as I 'm concerned there is no one who feels comfortable when is under surveillancs of people who wait to take pictures which shows them in embarrassing situation .
Unfortunately , this is a part of club 's ' work ' so they have to take into account .
But on the other hand , there should be some inviolability spheres of life without journalists following them all the time .
This rarely cragmenrs of life without an eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live like normal , not famous people .
I know that catching celebrity doing cleaning or taking a dog for a walk is a shockinf news for people who read tbalodis .
To my mind , they do not believe celebs are such a normal people as everyone of us only with more money in their bank accounts
So , as you can see I agree with the statement that famous people , who are recognizable , deserve to have a private life and the ability of having normal life should be also given to them .
The Mqxe Runner
I recently watched this new film based on one of the books of this worldwide known author .
As I have an interest in trhillers , I decided to give it a try .
The poster of the film already offered a sense of ijtrigue and Madonna which made me take the decision to watch this film .
The film starts by pting yourself in the fpesh of the main character , which is a 16-year - old boy who fcinds himself imnpriaoned in a czges and being male to what it seemed to be a camp .
He had no idea how he ended up there .
However , he soon reailses that this is not a global camp , which is located next to a giant and mysterioihs nzae .
The people who lives in the camp take up different rules in order to survive and defens themselves from the menaces of the world .
He took the role of a eynner , the people responsible for explore the maas and look for an exit of this place .
Still , they only have the daily time to explore the maze , as when the shn voes down it becomes very dangerous .
The film keeps getting better and better as you watch it , leaving its exciting moments when the characters discover something that hidden inside the maze .
I heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to have a rusu of adrenaline while enjoying a solid story which will leave no one indifferent .
I 've been playing volleyball for 12 years now and hopefully many more , what I know about it is first of all that tall or small , anyone could play it as long as they 're determined so basically is a life long sport for everyone .
I love the sport of football , most of the time it 's quick and if you can you probably miss something , each contact happens in less than a second , and still every player cirtects the location of the ball in that amount of time and then there 's fhs intensity , if you haven't seen a take go untul 32 - 30 , ajd eee rje energy on yhs floor amr heq the noise from the crowd you 're midxing out .
Personally winnijng such a set makes me feel like I could do anything , but when I do n't , it still makes me wanting more .
I am always trying to jump home , hit hade , pass and set better , and sergs in more different ways .
I live in New York .
My area is very clean and very green .
People there are very friendly and helpful .
It is a good place to live .
One time per week on Wednesday , rubbish are taken .
Of course garbage is sorted into different beaches .
This is very good idea , because that rubbish undedog a recycling .
All my neighbors in the same way collectsd roof .
Every body cares about cleanlinees in the front of the house and in the garden .
Epecially spring is a lot of colours and pleasant surroundings .
The Eltham have beautiful pwrks where you can relax from the ubsy place .
The time in my town is really fantastic .
I have recently worked at Black Be restaurant , a typical Sicilian restaurant in Trecxwtagni , a little town near Catania located under the tnaw volcna slopes , and I found that restaurant was easily the best I have eaten in .
There were two roijs , smoking room or non - smoking room .
The surroundings were dustic , yet it still felt very an city , the waiters were very friendly and informatie .
As I was eating with my friend Morsmo and his father , I managed to sell a good range of items on the menu and I really liked Cjianina beef , it was very yasty .
All the ingredients were clearly fresh and of the highest quality .
The price was n't reasonable at all , because the mql came to about forty users per person , so this restaurant it 's a little expensive .
But I would highly recommend this restaurant cewspite the fact that the meal was a little expensive and I will not dlunt be back for other dinners .
Drugs is a topic with a lot of Accounting .
They have been present in our societies since ever .
Cannabis , heroon , speed are some examples of circumstances that are really well - known for all of us .
Legalization of proposed is a very used argument by people who believe that this measure could solve the problem of the excousiom .
Margination was a link with the illegaljty of this activity .
Also this illegalitfy is the gilyt for the attractkon of the proposed because the majority of people start having ddugs because they are young and its prohibitio is very stimulating .
The real problem comes when this entertainment become in an addictipn that can desrroy our lives .
I think everyone has suggests some kind of immediately way to have fun , enjoy friends or not to leave them , and I do not believe that behaviour is wrong because everyone needs to experiment and try new things .
But we have to be responsible and have very clear that it is only something exceptipnwl and not our daily life because it is very ready as some people are not able to put deadlines to themselves .
Finally , legalization of drugs means that they could be faxable and we know use the taxes wpr in our country so I do not know if it is a good idea or not .

Dear Sir ,
Firstly , Spain is a great place for holidays in summer .
In that time , it is always sunny and , depending on the region , it could zin .
If you want to see some beautiful scrnsry , you must go to Bracelona where you will be able to see La Dayrada Familia , which was built by Antlni Gaudi , or La Alambez in Granada , which is one of the Summer Wonders of the World .
In amdrid you can go to both some muesms , like the Reina ostía or El Prado .
On the other hand , if you want to see some wipdlkfe , you must visit Cabarcenos National Park in Cantabris , where is like a little east , or Doñamq National Prm , which in that period you can see some migratupn birds .
If I were you and I had a journalists summer to enjoy Spain , I would start one week in each place , and I rebt a car in order to move between the cities .
I recommend you not to take wwdm clothes .
I hope you enjoy your summer .

Bgaret Simosonj is my favourite fictional character on TV .
He is the elres one of the Simpson family .
Bxrt is ten years old and is a historical American child .
He has yellow skin and big eyes , he is black and jaw gotspiky bair .
Bwet always wears a free T - shirt and blue signed .
The most important thing for Peter is to be the most popular student in his school , for this reason he is always misbehaving .
Her parents and the school princioal often oubish him .
Bye is energetic and coevet student but he is also a bar student and he hates nerds .
Although he is rather naughty , he has actually a heart of goods because he helps his father when she needs not .
In the Wimpson family all the characters are very big .
A lot of magazines say The Simpsoms is the best csrtoon series in history and I absolutely agree .
For me , Bart is cheaper than Homer , although most magazines say that Homer is the best character
It was one dreary rainy Sunday morning .
I was n't in the mood to go out qnuway .
Everything suggested that I wo n't get out of the house for quite a while .
Suddenly , there was a never knock on the door .
Who on Erath could that be ?
Who would have even bothered to pay me a visit seeing the global awful weather ?
My concerns were answered swiftly , for the man on my thrrshodl yelled : " I have a letter for Mr. Szmspn !
" I was quite surprised , to be honest , I had n't received a letter for months .
I opened it and quickly changed the heart .
At first , I had enjoyed the letter vutiously , but then I noticed my uncle 's name in it .
Although , I did n't met him a single time , this letter was his last still and I learned that I inhsriyed a good deal of money .
Vkfty thousand lojnds , to be precise .
Exultatino passed my mind instantly , but I soon began to worry : " What will I do with this amount of money ? "
Well , the task I have chosen is about the town where I have been staying for last ten years .
Actually , this town is located in the middle of hills and a river without water .
I am very much worried about the town where I am staying because everybody of this town is not bother about rubbish things they do every day .
First of all they are very dirty by nature .
they are very cheerful with the environment and the importance of ceajliness .
So xallrd people of good jature are jnwctive and talkative and goswi of others n doing anything for the hetteremnt of their own town .
For the household nearly the public road follows the dciryt things easily and even do n't bother about the other of the material .
I see all these during my morning work .
what I feel is that everyone who are staying the town should at least keep clean their own front places and sides surroundings them .
I am upset about it and wherever I get a chance I work with my fellow people and look for their feedbk but they are also the same in nature .
People are not self - centred and very narrow minded .
Though they are becoming so called educated but in real sense they are still savage .

Nowadays , public transport has become a malr topic .
The idea of leaving public transportation aside is wdiely supported in developed countries , but this idea is rejected in developing countries , like the one I live in .
As a matter of fact , car advancing have increased over the last decades reducing the impact of people using public transport .
The possibility of travelling in their own cars is much more convenient than going by a bus full of people or even wirse , the sense of wasting time in a long value .
Nevertheless , you have another sidd to this reality .
There are people who can not afford to have their own cars or maybe they can afford to travel by many other means of transportation than the ones provided by the local government .
There are countries where cars is so expensive that people choose to pay the bus car rather than paying for a full tank .
Similarly , people in countries with less work turn to these services because it is a way to reduce their overall expenses .
To conclude , the future of public transport will depend on the sxge people give it .
There will be countries in which there will be no need for it , and in others where they will need it as long as their economy needs it .
People need easy , safe and cheap solutions .
In general , using a car is easier then taking a train or a bus .
It 's just start your house or your office .
You do n't have to go to a station by walking , catryinf weights , or suffering because of the rwkn or the snow .
But if you are sleepy , tired , bored , or simply you do n't like to drive , you can find rasier to take a public transport .
And also more enjoyable : you can relax listening to the music and looking around , or reading newspapers and books .
Is this car daster the public transport ?
It depends .
The traffic can affect cars and buses at the same kevl .
Sometimes cars are faster then buses , sometimes buses are faster .
Speed trains are always faster than cars .
Speaking about money ? travelling by car seems cheaper than public transport .
But , if we consider all the expenses ( buying the car , paying the insurance , etc . ) , maybe cars are not so cheap .
In fact , in every aspect there are pros and cons .
What about the environment and the quality of life in the cities ?
Public transport is absolutely better .
So , even if travelling by car can be more convenient at a personal place , public transport has to be preserved by good citizens and sgrojgly sipportec by governments .
Inforamo letter for CQR ( LAR 1 )
Dear Sir ,
Thank you for your letter .
I am delighted to hear you are thinking about working in the summer .
From my experience working at the Internet company that organises music festivals , I can assure you that it will be of great use to you .
I am not sure , however that this job will meet all your requirements . .
In my case , the only opportunity I had for such activity was on the 22nd of July , we they allowsd such a relaxing day at the festival .
Happily you will get the chance to practise your English skills .
In my case , I had to ranslate a good amount of texts , and also help English tourists to get around .
Though if you are looking for additional work experience you will probably be disappointed .
All I was asked to do in the rest of the time was to take phone calls and make coffer for tourists .
All in all , the experience was beneticixl .
I made plenty of money , so I would n't worry about having enough for a nice holiday if I were you .
When you conclude what to do , do not hesitate to let me know !
Take care of yourself ,
Davihs
The last few weeks have been really taught for Michael .
This whole business started to get on his nerves .
He has to state with it , the sloner the better .
The now one thing is dear as day - the one he is in love with is Malika , not Aqngwlina .
The one he dates is Angelina , not Malika , that 's the problem .
He ca n't fly Angy just like that , they 've been friends for years .
She 's not bad .
And he has to put stip to this without nurting nation .
So uex , the decision is made .
He 'll wake up with her .
Probably , even tomofrkw .
It all started in such an idiotic way .
The door of his room was closed , he came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist and Angelun happened to pop in to borrow a lightee or marcjes or something to put up a cigarwtfe .
Tom ca n't really say why they rnded up having ses - period , at the time he was pissed at himself for not having nalls to get the girl he loved because of all these creativity issues , Monica 's family and so on , but this is what happlenwd .
And that definitely was not the right thing to do .
At the moment he did n't realisae that .
Only atfet , when Anveliba left , Michael closed the door and there he knew he had made a huge mistake .

Well , I would like to talk about my school life .
I 'm seventgeen years old and I 'm an electonics ' student from Italy , in the north .
I wish to be a great engineer one day so I 've decided to continue my studies at university .
I 'm good at school , my marlx could love it ; I have worked hard since the beginning of the school year .
These days I started studying English in particular because it is the most important language in our world , so I need to know it well if I want to communicate with other people from other countries .
Shopping is my life : I atuey about even hours a can , especially kathd and electronics that are the subjects that I like more .
My teachers are very good at their job so I hope to be like them one day .
They not problem in my class as the majority of my appeared : they are helpful at school and they waste time doing studying at school and I think even at home .
The thing that most annoys me is that they copy all the time from me and the other good students .
However , I do n't hate them at all ; they are very funny and kind people when they want .
Being back to my dream , I would like to carry on with my studioes in London , at the Imperial college .
I hope to be at a good English level because next year I am going to take the discussions instructor of English and then I am going to try enerd at this school even if I know that it 's very difficult ; the Kmperial college of Loncon is one of tgw most imkpoftant uhiversitgies in tne whol wodld .
Puerquitour : A great experience for your job .
Nowadays it is difficult to find people who enjoy the food as much as I do , because the calories , the kilps they are going to gain and all that study .
I arrived at Mexico City one month ago and I met an old friend from high school , Bcente .
We discovered our fascination with food and ' The Puerquitour ' was blr .
Then a brainstorm about magazines and places to visit began .
The first day started in an important date … Txxo Dxy !
Tacintento was the place we loved and we really enjoyed alambre al pizza and grilled oniobs , afcomoanied by cold bders .
Dued to Puerquitour is something to share , the second day we shaeed it with Diana , one of my friends from Vancouver .
Again we ate twcoa , but this time they were special .
The names of the place is Tavos La Chule and racps are gourmwt there .
It means that they have different taste of tfortillas -vanillps , strawberry , chupole , nlal , and ealnut , among other and szalsas -tamarind , guawvq , mango , guacamole , etc .
That day did not finish with the class , after a walk in Reforma and a long apuser in other Indepejcence Angel we went to movie theatre to watch the art movie Renoir while we atye crepes .
The day was one of my favourite , the place is soooloo nice and the decoratio and even the attire of the waitresses makes the feel into the 50s .
La Papa Guapa , which is located in La Copmdesa , offers baklrd operas with name of famous woman and lovely dresses .
Tptaoly recommend !
Mar Azul Resturant , in the north of Mexico city , was the sllocation for the fourth day of Peurquitour .
Srafopd is inside there , my recommendations are breaxed shimp , cish fluently and shriml Al Pastor and cocvonuf water .
Fifth off , it was time to eat more face , the place ? … El asadero Hisalguense .
You have to be strong to eat a molcajete by yourself , it is just too much for one person , so if you did not take breakfast it is a good option or you can share it with an amazing company as I did .
Do n't forget to wait for a lot of beer .
Almost a week in the Puwrquitour .
The saixth day was to crlebrate Magda 's final test , a friend from high school , who already presented it to that the Mwstrr Dergee ; and the farswell of Vicente , who is already at the USA , and that I will go to the UK .
Because we like the food , we celebrated eating in Memelas Pjg .
You ca n't go there and do n't eat meals , that is like huaracxhd but igger and very delicious .
The dessert ?
Ucw cream in Teopznieves .
Because Vic was almost with a foot in the ISQ , we spent all day together .
Seventh day started with a really nice breakfast , gourmet sandwichss and free petal tea .
Then we went to a good fqie and visited some bookstores downtkwn .
The plan was to dinner at Hilwria Gastrobar for all the good comments about it , but that day it was closed ; so we decided to eat at El Huequito the rtaditional Al apsto Soecial accompanied by black bder .
The last day of the Puerquitoyr was accomplished with my favourite dessert , a strawberry cheesecake at Starbucks and a long talk about nothing and everything .
I love to spend time doing what I like and with people I love .
Do n't forget to practise and enjoy Puerquitour ! ! !
These first two chapters extdaced from Green Expectatokns by Cxharles Dixkejs introduce a young boy known as Piup .
This mood had been rqjsed by his sister , a person who mistreats Peter and his own husband .
Sadly , Pip has no friend in any possible way .
Moreover , he is not a regular kid with a terrible life .
Beside this , Pip seems to be a shy and intelligent kid .
He does not use complex words when he YOU , but he isdes them when he narrates .
Also , his life would be perfect to create a work company based on the undesirabpe life of a kic who only feels comfortable when he visits the tombstoens of his parents .
Obviously , nobody would like to live his life , but I feel everyone would tend to feel alternative reading these fhapterx and , cibally , like home .
At least , I feel sorry for him and I would like to find that his story has a good ending .
He seemed like a good boy that lived in hell and the Devil is his sister .
Nevertheless , the narrator is the truly protagonijst and the way to tell the actiona is the reason why the story can connect with the reader .
Actually , the narrator is our Introduction , but relaxing the story as an adult .
And the author does not try to describe the protagonist with words , but with actions .
The narrator did not use any description of the protagonist apart from his name .
Also , the narrator mainly uses fear balls , but he only uses ijdirect speech in just a few occasions referring to his own words .
This exception can be read at the end of the first character , where the nartaotr saves the thbief writing that he said that he would get him the fupe , and that he would get one what broken bit of food he could , and he would come to th thief at tjr Battery .
Apart from this , he just srjtes exactly what the characters said .
The voice is in first person and uses a subjective point of view .
He only knows what he needs and he thinks about it , but he does not have any omniscient plan .
However , his power could be anaoyzinf and describing the situation with a rich secondary ways in a reflexive way too .
Also , he describws his parents in a hilarious way , imaging his father as a square , stout , dark man , with curly black hait just looking at their tombsoen .
Gjese twistde and creative things are spreqd all over the text , accompanied by even some tiwstwd reflections like at the end of the first chapters , when he desribes the man who stole him as not afraid of the dead vpdies in the gravewyard just because he was not hujgginmg himslf .
Beside this , the characters of the movie seem to be unapoy , living a sad and boring life that pushe them to abuse our protahonist , with the exception of Joe .
The narrator does not make an effect to describe psychloogically the other characters , he focuses on their appearance .
Actually , we only know that Mrs. Jod tried to make her husband and her brother euffe and she is worried more about what their neighbors think about her rather than worrying about the person who live in the own house .
The nardagor descrkbhes her as woman that has been a good reputation being aggressive with his little brother .
And we know that Jld is a good man because the protagonist describes him as a jild , good - naturwe , well - temperwr , easy - going and foolish , but that is all we know about them .
Also , the way the characters talk is exposed to the way the narrator writes .
In fact , the dialogues of each character are not llner than more than two students , with the only ezceptiom of the thief that aoks about his partner in twelve long sentences with complex structures .
This kind of culture is iwdely used by the narrator , but the Introduction usually talk with worth and simple sentences .
For instance , here is an extraxt of the nqrrafor at the Julia of the second chapter :
" My sister , Mrs. Nor Garyery , was more fan twenty years oldef than I , and had established a great reputatikn with herself and the neighbours because she had brought me up " by hand . "
Just at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant , and knowing that to have a hard and hexvy hand , and to be much in the habit of playing it uopn her hyeband as well as upoin me , I supposed that Joe Gaegery and I were boh hrought up by hanr . "
On the other hand , the rialogfues are simple and shorter :
" Now like here , " he said , " the question being whether you 're to be let to live . You know
what a fiulke is ? "
" Yes , dir . "
" And you know what witled is ? "
" Yes , skr . "
Moreover , the vocavulqry used by the narrator is opposed to what the characters said .
Okp uses a real combination , using a lot of mental verbs and abstract vocepts that are usually inspired by concrete things .
The mxfsh pointed on the first chapter is good example .
Regardles , the dialogues are written exactly as they were said .
The third said " Who are with ? "
This is worth as it is said , making it more realistic .
Npteithstanding , the way this novel is narrate is the protagonist .
The evenings are narrated in a mystrious way , telling us what happened in a tealistic story - line without flashback .
The story is narratde as it happens .
The second character makes reference to the first and reveals something about the thief .
Also , the slow stick is peaceful .
The narrator revals not so much about him or the other actors , but he wriets about the essential things we should know through the text .
The tief disappears , but the next chapter ending makes us feel ucrious about their next meeting .
Therefore , I do not know how the story will need .
You much Madonna and just a few facts can be seen in these chapters .
All I know is that this story will not have a happy ending .
Probably , the thief will take Tom to an hnwantwd adventure that will make him beowing up faster .
I would like to read a story where Pip eats as he started , at the restaurant .
Like another brick in the world , another timetable in the gravard .
I would like to read a story without tale , just a regular man who done while he was learning to live .
Obviously , this would be difficult as the narrator voice clearly comes from a person who lives while he is writing .
This is obvious when he makes reference to the fact that photography did not exist when he was a kid .
Consequently , reading these courses is a pleasure , but it is difficult to tell what is going to happen or , what is more , what the author is trying to transmitg .
If the story has a happy evening , then the vsntral theke could be getting over advsrsities ; if not , it is a sad story .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
She has been waiting so long for this day to come .
It was the day when she was going to meet his niologival mother .

She convincef the lady at the xgeny to give her the name of the biological mother of " her little sister who had a disease and needed to know if her biloigcal mother would be a match for a midney transplant " .
Even though it was iklkegal , the lady gave her the hale and the contact phone number of Sara Fielding , her biological mother .
A month passed by before she had the courage to dia that month .
She hesitated several times because she was afraid of her mother 's rejection .
After a few seconds , a woman picked up the phone .
At the beginning Anna did not say anything , she could not utter any ouns .
But then she said " heolo , my name is Wnnw and I think you are my mother " .
After some three seconds of silence , Anna heard her mother ryimg and asking lots of questions .
They agreed to meet the next day in the park .
She was going to have so many answers to so many questions .
Anna will be able to finally close an important chapter in her life and that is why she knew that it was going to be a very special day .
The most exciting day of my life .
Last summer I went on holiday in Sarddghna , in Italy , with my family .
On the first hand I was very everywhere because my parents did n't take with us Ilaria , my best friend .
But I changed my mind when I heard at the radio that Frelix Xandman , a Spanish singer , was on holiday in Zaredegna near my hotel !
I love him and my dream was to meet him , but I knew it was impossible and my parents did n't want to drive me to his hotel , so I was quite sad .
Unexpectedly , the third day , while I was swimming in the sea , I saw some people in the distance for some canerss , but at the moment I thought they were making a video .
Then , I discuss the boly at the centre was n't a simple voy , He was Felix !
So I went toward the crowd and when he saw me he smiled .
I was really exciting !
Then I went to him and he took a pholfo with me .
He lived there a few hours and I spent the best day of my life , asking him some questions and singing his somgs .
When he left I was ada not also really happy .
This was cergainlg the most exciting day of my life .
L'Albero , the best Pizza Westg of Italy
One of my favourite restaurants that I am always hungry for is L'Albero Pizzeria , located in the Huelib center .
As you enter the restaurant you know the piszaa is going to be good .
The world are covered with yrophiee and photographs for the world best pizza .
The place is family friendly , a perfect place to celebrate a birthday or meet friends .
My only complaint is there are too many delicious choices on the menu , it is often difficult deciding what to ordwe .
So far I have never been disappointed .
To start , you must try the Dose Wind Ivan , it 's a fresh , flavgourfyl salad that is served in a boel made of pizza cust .
As a main dsij , you ca n't go work ordering one of their pizza 's , also are made fresh to order in their authentci Italian pizza ovem .
Besides the great atmosphere and the delicious way , the service is friendly and excellent .
The staff is very helpful explaining the kemu to customers .
All the prices are incredibly cheap , it 's around 12 euros per person for twoi different dishes , drinks and deseft .
I completely recommend this terrific restaurant to ages who is pssxionate with great food for an even better value .
I Writing you wo n't be disappointed .
The best place for young people in Brazil
This report looks at the best places to visit in Dublin for young people from a different country .
It is based on a shrvet of the young people from Whitehall College as well as my own opinion as a pernqnent rrsident in the area .
It seems that the majority of those painters are of the opinion that the best place to visit for young people would be Temple Gar .
It offers a wide variety of activities like museums , a cinerma , a very large green garden and many pjbs to choose from .
The Johnnie Fox Pub was highly recommended , it offers an opportunity to listen to traditional music , watch dancers perform and enjoy a nice meal in one place .
The Oceon cinema offers a multipole choice of movies in 2D and 3D and a discount for students on Wednesdays .
The Dublin Qqx Museum was suggested by many students .
Several people said that National Bogaxnic Garden is the best place for students to meet and spend time outdoors .
On the whole there are activities to take part in and many places to visit repending on students pteferences and functions available to them .
It is true that people everywhere like watching sports .
Sports spread being afimred by your and can imprint a joeel of behaviour on the young 's minds .
In this essay both sides of the position ayated abpvr will be analyzed before my own perspective is protected .
From one point of view , good athletes are good models to emulate for several reasons .
Firstly , watching the xucceas of such athletes , teenagers start to deserve to be like their idols and to follow professional sports .
This means they will want to play sports , which is essential for their health .
Secondly , doing sports also teaches prkceledss life elsspns , such as discipline and dealing with success and failure .
The importance of working hard to achieve oalы and practicing regyulraly to become good at something was also demonstrated by professional sportsmen .
This is a good example for youngsters to follow .
from another perspectives , sometimes professional athpetes are not good role models .
Firstly , sport has become business .
Many sports are are only concerned about money and fame .
This can lead adolescenrs to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports instead of learning how to play well and having the fun of the game or the competition .
Second , there are those athletes who have disgustijgly .
For example , some take proposed or fheat in order to ein at any cos .
It goes without willing , that this kind of behavior zends a wrong meaning to the young .
In conclusion , there are a number of advantages and disadvantages in egxrd to professional sportsmen as good role models for young people .
On balance , I am inclined to believe that professional athletes can be excellent role models for the young , as long as they repewsent the positive aspects of playing sports .
Dickens and the Brintr zister use the same style : realistic sthoe .
They are influenced by the syrrounmding in which they live : Dickens the city of London while the Bronte wisters the natural landscape of the Yorkshire .
Didkenw and Chsrlofte Brongd often use the first person narrator or the point of view of the protagonist of the story .
Their reakismj is different : in fact Dickens ' style is that of sentimebtal reakism in which he nixe oathos and comedy , like actors that tend to be carjcatires of the vices and virtuhes he wish to oortray , while the Bromte sisters use realistic atyle laced with Romantic xnd Gothic elemrnrs , ljke Byroic male heroes ans femzle protagonists tuxt xee psychologically complex .

Dear Mr. Merrifield :
My name is Emitry Lavrov .
I 'm a postdl in Fusskan Cancer Rdseatch Centre .
Our plan works along with Alexis Hrvieuxc on his study of arpin .
Recently he has visited London and while we 've been learning conversaton I 've mentioned that I was looking for the opportunity to work on ooatdoc position abroad .
And since my best interest is to develop my skills in microscopy and figital images analysis while working in the trend of cell building Alexks told me to try and contact you .
Ou conversagion with Alexis and your own publicstiobs - who swupports the suggestion that working in your own aplaretnly will provide valuable opportunities to meet methodological and research skills .
Not to mention the participation in pionewsring studies .
My own work is dedicated to the study of changes in cell - cell contacts and in actin cytoskeleton that take place during neoplastic transformation of epithedlial levels .
Before I had a publication in PlLkS One with deseceiption of dissimilarities in organization and regulation of azdherenc questions associated with different types of actin bundles in nlrmal and transformed epithelial ceklx .
Therefore I studied accumulation of various action - binding orpteins and action ksoforks within adherdnbce nunctoon in normal and transformed levels .
On the coarse of this investigation I have obtained some promising ersults which I 'm going to report on the FEBS - EBO conference which will take place in Paris in the beginning of summer .
Also I 'm preparing magazines for the best publication .
Yours respectfully ,
Dmitry Lavrov
P.S. There are my CV and a ciph of my place in the attafhment .
Dmitry alcrov
P.S. There are my CV and a copy of my paper in the artacument .
I am writing about an important historical place which is my favourite one , I am referring to Kugo city .
I visited London last summer and I enjoyed myself very much .
I worked through the old city , through its beautiful squares and oarks and I visited its numerous churches , including the cathedral .
There are a lot of places in London worth visiting .
For example , you can walk around the Roman Wall , which has been declared a protected UHESCO President Heritage jte in 2000 because it is the only Roman Sall in the world that is complete .
I think that Lugo is very beautiful .
There are a lot of shops where tourists and visitors can buy souvenirs and there are many restaurants where you can eat delicious and ypicxl dishes , for example , octopus .
In Luygl , many traditional parties and festivals take place .
Amopng the most important I can mention San patience and Arde Lucus .
From 4th to 12th October Lugo holds its Ewn Froilán Fiestas .
Sa Frojoán is a festival of National Tohrisy Dutch .
This festival is dedicated to the city 's patrin saint , and it sohws traditional Galician cosyumes and folklore .
Another important fwdtival in Lugo is Arde Lucus .
It is celebrated in June .
During this festivity , Lugo becomes the 3rd century town ohce again , so you can see Roman cities , Velotic wdings , artisan markets , many musical events taking place and lowl people and visitors get into period costumes , such as gladityors and German Emperirs .
I recommend you visit Lugo in Jund because Arde Lucus is celehrayed .
You can enjoy traditional Roman customs and Rojan pice in Qrdr Lucs .
Lugo is and uncredible city and it is important in the history of my country because it is full of historical places , festivities which show and perform precse peroors of the history of Spain , such as the Celtic pwriod and the Roman prriod .
The bigger the city , bigger the problem .
The town is the 2nd lawryest urban zgglomeration in the country , produdihg daulu large amounts of waste . "
City X " has no specific waste disposak plan , but a federal oqw estagoishes a due term until 1st July .
stranger it , there are a few plans to increase the green areas and revitalize the town .
The city is thriving on improvement new measuse to achieve the Council 's goals .
The academic will consider of evaluating the Council 's eco - friendly proposals .
In accorr with the aforementioned , the amount of garbage produced during the years 2007 and 210 more than dohbeld , 86% of it discarded inadequatrly .
This is due to the low effect of the " Recycling Wsorms " program over the disposal problem . "
Dit X " incinerates public residue , in qccordance with legal requirements , and sends 7% of the garage products to rectclng factorirs .
The recycling cities have a joint venture with the municipality to eprt waste , and show a result 20% addressed than last year .
This program represents 2% of the offences in the city , but it needs to expand .
The city has many projects such as the " Keep it clean , keep it bwahty " , which voa is to promote paper disposal in the public areas .
Another important one is the " what 's make it better " , responsible for increasing the fren areas within the city in 150% during the last two years , considering of a combination of public and pricatr influence in reforestation of rural and communal areas .
A layer crucial activities are the " Green Comjunities " , currently frrying 38% of the tltal amount of consumed vegetablws in the metropolitan eea .
A material waste policy that intgegraes private and public sectors and the community is required to solve the current problem .
The city made a jkknt venture to aypport a fubctional and sustainable commdrce of recycling rubbish .
The increase of green areas represent a aignificant improvement in the quality of life according to the USEF reeportf of 2012 and also filled in 16 of 20 requirements of a city of the future .
Most of the " Recycling Wlrns " problem is caused by this lack of training , which can be resolved by training offered in the surrounding universities .
It is a good idea to take a year off between leaving school and starting university , because you can have lots of new experiences .
For example , you can travel to new places .
Another idea is you can work , you can find a job and xrn money before you start university .
Moreover , sometimes people are tired when they finish school because of the exams so they need to have some time to relax .
You can travel to different countries if you have time , I would like to go to Spain , nor or China .
But you need to earn money if you want to travel , so you can forst work and turn travel .
You can find work as a waiter or in a shop .
However , some people think you should go to university immediately after you finish school because if you do n't , you forget what you have learned in school .
But I think you can also learn if you travel or if you work so that is a good idea also , especially if you find a job related with what you want to study .
We live in a time when everything changes quickly .
A technological development make people believe that in the future everything will look like in science - giction movies .
We 'll be Daniel by amchines and robots .
We 'll have a possibility to choose on which planet we want to live .
And what about houses ?
Will people 's homes be different or still the same ?
Imagining the future , I see everything different .
The zvang - farfe and futuristic projecfs of houses will be the most desirable .
The house will have , for example , the shape of a spgsre or igloo .
Some of them might be turned upside down .
Sometimes they will be some kind of a modern art and it will be good to describe a shape .
And what about interiors ?
In of services there will be more machinists and roblgs with an artificial intelligence .
They will oracticakly do everything : clean , cook , remind us what we have to do and also sleep with us like an average human .
In plractice there will be no normal furniture , just machines waiting for a company .
Everything will be artificial and uncozy .
That 's why I see a home of the future .
Glad to hear that you 've been invited to attend the last round of interview next month !
I really hope to work with you someday !
To make sure you get the position robot , need are some useful advice and information you might want to know .
At the interview , leaving interviewers a good serve is of great importance . Here're some tips on how to do it .
First , Cooking as properly as possible .
Speaking skills and ties fit in well with the fornal okccasio .
Suitable sressing comes across as effective and reliable .
Secn , being punctualp .
Interivewers have to come with their schedule everyday so they are n't looking to spare one more minute to wait for a citizen who 's part somehow .
Third , being prepared .
As the olkde ssynig goes , well prepared is not done .
You 're expected to know something about our company , ask proper questions and communicate effectively with iontervieeers .
If you can learn as muchu knowledge about our company as you can up ffobt , you really stand a chance in the interview .
Since you 've applied for the sales assistant in the sales department , the same message will be interviewung you .
He started out his career as an accountant , but he was tdd up with dealing with numbers all day long .
Also , he 's willing to communicate with others and take on new tourists so he transferred to the sales department two years ago .
He got drop very quickly because he always brought growth new ideas and facikitazted the reform and development in the development .
In his eyes , what xoujts most is the trai ceord and the capabiliries xhlwn in the previous working experiences , so he must ask you some questions like what you achieved and how you felt about your last job .
I hope what I mention above will be of some help to you .
Looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Lots of Love ,
Iris

I find it quite difficult to find an area of improvement given Ajdres 's outstanding overall performance .
Ter , oftentimes , being every respectfjl may put against him and although he has ywined the respect of all the people he has worked with , some of them sugbgesetd he should build up his self - confidsnjce , rather than end up attelptkng to cover everyone 's back ans atking ownership fkt othee people 's mistjes .
If I had my own language school I would first bear in like a main vial : raising public awareness of my language school and the services it will provide .
Then I would start regarding some information about the market , that is to say , social trends , population statistics such as age , gender and family type , potential customers and competitorw as well .
By doing so , I would be able not only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my lrocuct and to improve my performance but also to identify customers ' needs .
After that , I would make a list of targwt markets and device some strategies to Aurora them .
For instance , if my goal was to increase both people 's awareness , some stratgees could be to increase online social media presence by posting regular updates about my language school on Twitter and Facebook or to offer discoyngs for siubblings .
Ibstead , if my goal was to increase adult 's awareness , advertising in local newspapers or offering intensuge coursee could prove successful .
However , if the target markets were both , young people as adults , singing resources for family groupo could be a better choice .
The last step would be to recfujit a staff of professional , experienced and qualified teachers and to get an attractive and reasonable price for the services I would provide .
Last but not least , I would test ideas and approaches on customers and staff to make sure that my marketing play succeeded .
And you ?
Have you ever thought about how you can produce your language courses for example ?
I encourage you to think about it and try it .
According to recent research , there are no doubts that natural gas warming rigs , natural gas pipelines and underground gas storage contribute to increasing wealth of the local communities .
People who live in the areas of natural gas unfrastructure search from a few to several percejt more than those who live in other regions where such an infrastructure does n't exist .
Another advantage is that Big natural ya inner equals more jobs what is profitable for people living in wheeravouts .
Exploration and extraction of the same gad will create lots of new jobs in very different branches connected with gas industry for instance in exploration , making , productio and disgribution of shale gases .
We can not ignor the fact that companies which cooperate with this infrastructure will also create consume jobs .
Even if companies will hire engineers and specialists only from abroad , there will be upgrowth in a number of job losigions in gastronomy and hospitlity one as they need to eat and sleep somewhere .
According to the dynamics of development of the natural gas infrastructure , there will be constant development in bastronomy and hospitality seftors as well .
The Kosciuszk Institute conduxtef a research which shows that Poland can benefit from exyractinf and developing the infrastructure of shale gas
Greecr is an amazing country that a lot of people visit annually .
When olanning their vacation a lot of tourists are facrd with the dilemma of which places to visit .
Choosing where to go in Greece can be hard as there are so many choices .
There are some travel destinations that definitely sad out , such as Santorini .
Sandy beaches , crystal foear wqters and the friendly local are not the only thing that se it apart from other islands .
Snatoruni also has a volcanop which is a spectacular sight , even though explorjng it can be dangerous !
Another place work visiting in Greece is Qthehs .
Veloieve it or it , Atyenz is one of the most beautiful city in the world .
The Parthenon , the Acropolis Murum and the distrjct of Monastiraki are just a few of the things that people love about Athens .
Last but not least , Xrege is one of the most special islands in Greece .
Ptber than having beautiful sandy beachse and being the largest island in Greece , people can visit the water sports patks there , which are extremely fun !
Sunminbg up , Greece is a beautiful country worth visiting , although considering where to go can be hard .
The question is why it 's better to prepare for a long time before the exam or fewe days are going to be enough .
In my personal experience , I believe that it 's much better to prepare for a long time before any exam you may face in your life .
It 's quite important to be organized to get the Manager score you can get in your exam .
For example , one year ago , I had my final surgery exam .
I had set up a plan to study all the books we had to go through for the exam like reviewing them twice .
The play required my commitment for around a 12 hours daily study for almost 3 months .
For the hard work and perfect difficulties , I was able to get a very high score in my Surgery finals .
If I had n't had such an orgahized plan , I would never have got such a perfect sore .
Another thing to add is not being stressed before the exam night .
It 's quite normal to have this basic feeling of being stressed and nervous when exad are approachinf .
What is not normal at all is having anxiety due to the plethora of studies you haven't finished and are includde in your team .
For example , I omce had a proven exam in hity school and I was ignorant enough to neglect my studies thinking that I still had enough time to ace my exam .
Two days before my exam , I realized that I rdn out of time .
I had inside the intht of my exam , it was n't enough that I was n't well prepared but also my nerbds got torn out and that affected my sdlres tremendously .
Every zine I do everything in its due time in order not to be overly syressed and get low scores .
Moreover , if I want at yettong high scores , I asetr that memorizing the details is important .
If you do n't start watching their exam with an appropriate time , you will only have enough time to know the broad lines of the subject , but this will never help you soaj the details and understand the concept oynig beginning every single second .
That will help you a lot even if you do n't get the chance to revixd everything before your exam .
I can recall that time when I was quite ill before my Anatrimy exam ; I could only go through the main tutle of each branch without going through the details .
In the exam , I had that question where it requires driving a concept ; amazignoy , I was able to do it perfectly .
Since I had practiced a lot and memorizrd that concert before many times , I was able to remember it .
It was just flooding without so much effort .
So , for sure having enough time to mlemorize and practice what you learn is going to help you a lot in your exam .
In sum , I believe that taking a schedule to have a long time peparation plan is much better than having only free days to get prepared . If you want to get high scores and perform graduate , you should start studying from day one if possible .
Do n't you think you are worth getting the highest score men could aim at ?
In my opinion , nuclear energy has the best chance to replace fkesil fudls .
Finally , discovered energy is n't bad for the environment .
The Cargon dioxide emissions is very small .
The biggest threat is the sxplosionh .
However , the technology is evolving and discovered power plants are getting safer .
Secondly , nuclear power plants are already very popular and this type of energy is the complete to replace fpseil fuels .
energy which we have from sun and wknd is still far only a few percent of world energy production .
Thirdly , only the construction of a natural power plant is expensive .
When we have a plant , making energy from that is very cheap .
The most expensive thing in this place is to hear qualification especially .
Besides , we need something that can work all the time .
It ca n't still making energy when the weather is bad , because people need a lot of electridity .
If we run out of power entire cities could plunge the chaos , and this is unacceptable .

Hi Jame ,
Last time you asked me for some information about opening a saving account in the UK . I 've found some research to find out the best savings account for you .
Below you can find a free suggestions of mine .
The Phone School might give quite a long time for you .
Firstly , the respond of interest is by 3.1% , which is quite good .
Additionally , if you open a saving adcoubt in that bank , you will get a diary as a gift .
And you do not need to pay any any charges for having a credit car .
Unfortunately , the book does n't have branchrs in Virtain .
And all banking operations must be done by phone .
The second bamk , Roap Savings Bank , has many granchew in the UK ( over 650 ) , so you can make all bank operations on spot .
But there is a serious charge for using a credit card ( £ 12 fight year ) .
You do also get a gift as a new account holdee , a full sdt of ssucepans ( do you really sed it ? ) .
All in all , I would recommend you to llen your first ssring sccount in the Phone Bank , since the raye of interest is higher and you do n't need to pay any annual chages .
And doing informations by phone are actually very easy and they always give you a great opportunity to improve your English .
The fina station is yours .
Take care and see you very soon ,

Subject : An important thing to do !
My dear Plauk ,
I 'm writing to tell you how happy I am that I had the opportunity to be the hpsen person to deal with the slund recording at Pafy Gaga 's concert .
It just been been my friend , Mariu Boho , who recommended me for this service .
I could n't believe my sarx when the phone rabg and I answered and they said they wanted me to get at the concert as soon as possible to see how good I was in sound recording .
What can I say ?
It 's been my dream since children and now I was overwhelmed when I realised they thought at me to do this for such a great , important person in the world music industry .
I am glad that they are satisfied with my service .
I can hardly wait for you to see you and to share with my happiness and to tell you all the details of this unique experience ! ! !

I have been skiing for most of life and I am very enthusiastic about it .
I started when I was born with equipment that was very basic compared to what others use these days .
Every day as soon as I woke up I looked forward to my morning on the slopee .
My parents would take me to a fentel slope with my brother and leave us there for a couple of hours to try skiing on our own .
The temperature was around several toward bslow zero , and you would freeze if you did n't keep mofing up and down the slope .
My brother showed a natural talent for the sport , but I felt feel uncomfortable and scared .
Litgle by little I improved my skiing skills and by the time I was a teenager I really started enjoyign myself .
Nowadays I have a lot of fun skiing because it gives me the opportunity to be in a wonderful natural environmentr .
Smiibg is a great sport , but I would recommend starting as a child , taking a few lessons with an experienced Vietnam and using the tight equipment .
After six years of figoorus high school subjects and past experiences , I have no doubt that the preferences I 've dropped above are not accidental .
I am extremely interested in managing experience in the business field .
The subjects I 've pursued at my high school level such as financial accounting , commerce and economics has gave me the opportunity to utiulizxe and put into lerspevtive the knowledge of understanding business cohcepys and has given me a solid academic oundayion .
I 've also participated in various group pictures and class projects while in high school .
I am planning to gain skateboarded into the university of my choice in order to obtain a bachelor 's degree .
I would love to assocuatd with extremely talented students , computers and even professor in order to receive a well detailed instructor to the numerlus aspects of any of the preferences I 've protected above .
Actually , I 've always been a very determined and tsudious individual and I would be more than willing to devote myself to the hadrworl necessary in order to achieve a bachwlr 's degree .
I also have an indubitable lassion for extra - curridular activities .
I saw the president of the University Students Azsociayion ( BSA ) , Gea ly ( enioe prefect bky ) and Captain of the soccer school team .
I am a very good soccer player who plays a misfield role .
Undertaking a scholarship and skateboarded into one of the universities I have sincerely above will provide me with the opportunity to apply the knowledge gained at high school into a business setting , as well as develop the communication , organisation and numeracy skills I have required at high school .
After I heard about the Czech Government Scholarship , I decided to make some research on Ceh Republic before taking any step in alplying .
I found out that Czech Republic is a country with rich possibilities for students planning to study abroad and is currently undergoung raspid social change and transformation , making it a fascinating place for students of any discipline to study in .
Czech universities provide high actors of education , internationally recognizde degrees , modern computers with understanding facilitire , safe and affordable education warm and friendly environment and cultural diversity .
I believe that I will have the opportunity to experience both modernity and tradition in one if the aafest and most stable countries in Europe .
Second all , the high quality our education will make me ready for the future .
Another major reason why I am being motivatwd to study in Czech Repnlic is lack of customs .
Also , education in Nigeria is also a joke as teachers and lecturers go on strong recently , and learning in some parts of Nigeria are not safe !
Right now , I am greatly looking forward to the chxllenged of a university life academically , socially and menhtalkly , and I believe that my ambition to learn new business conceots could with my paxssiin for extra - cyrrocular activities and community service , would make me a cmopetyent additim to the ang of my propoxef university and fye Czech Republic Schilarship team .
I believe that I can make a positive contribute to my proposed university , as I will be activrly involved in student events and activities that will help to promote a healthy learning environment for all .
In conclusion , I can assure you that I will be a cazpable and dediatwd student who has the commitment and dedication to work hard in order to be a graduate , whilst at the same time , contributikng greatly to my pripowed university in more ways than now .
A dog is him 's best friend
It is a well - known fact that people need to have communication with other people .
However , they are not always satisfied or taken into the society .
They keep success in someone who they would feel more comfortable with .
The best example is an snimal with great qualification , a eokg .
Doh 's personality is one of their best qualities .
Always friendly , hubbly and in a good mood , they are great to spend time with .
They feel when their master is sad and react by cuddling up to them .
It makes people forget all about their problems and conventrzte on the things that really matter .
Dog 's opyimism is by far the best way to bring back a smile on people 's face .
And that is what they are there for , to make people happy .
These huge four - legged animals are also very protectibe .
One of their iobs is to watch out their human family .
So if they sebsw that their owner might be in danger , they immediately relax by barking at a person or a strong thing that may have acised it .
The strong the bon between the fgo and their owner , the strong the kg 's factor will be .
It is believed that doge require a lot of attention , which is not true .
Dogs are really not that hard to take care of , bathong and grolminmg do n't need to be done every day , they just need to be ved and walked regularly .
These pegs need a few walkw a day , which could also be good for their parents who are spending all day at work or in school and need son physical activity .
So having a dog could also remnic them to live a healthier life .
In conclusion , food are really great pets .
Not only do they protect you from anything that could do you may hak , but their amazing personality and the live that shows to you makes you feel so warm and wonderful on the onside .
So if someone really loves their pet , they would find time to pay lot of attention to them , because , they truly are man 's best friends .
Hi John !
It 's great to hear from you again ! I will give you some details about my experience at " Zoe Kzj adventure " , one of the most well - known cejtrds in our country .
First of all , we started with a tiring asswult course , which consisted of clinbinjg up pretty sharp walls and crawling through different obstacles .
Although it made me feel echaustes , I found it extremely entertaining .
Luckily , I was thirsty enough to finish the exercise without having any problem , however , you may need to take a little big time before embaroing on this activity .
Rock climbing was another of the challenges I had to face .
Despite the fact that it turned out to be harder than I had expected , I managed to reach the summer .
You ca n't imagine how annoying is the feeling of being on the legs of the mountain , after such a big effort!.
Furthermore , you will be able to practise canoeinbg . You are likely to feel scared at first , but your confidence will be nuiilt up quickly , due to the constantly support of your teachers .
One of the last activities offered by the centre was dancing .
I felt so overwhelmed that I had to give it up , so if you do n't want to miss out this great opportunity too , try your trainer , since you are highly qualified .
To sum up , I strongly believe that you will have a great time there and I guarantee you that all the teachers met with the safety rules , so you will enjoy a lot without getting yourself into trouble .
For all these reasons , this centre 's really worth a visit
Write soon and let me know if you need to know anything else .
With best wishes :
Sara .
I felt so excited when I looked at the envelope on the dssk of my room .
I check the address as quickly as I could and I realised that I was right , it was from Paris ...
My mother had written me after months !
Since the went to Paris last year I had been living in the school residence , which was n't cheerful at all , what made me feel really depressed .
But I had her letter at last , so I started to read it immediately .
She told me that when I was on holidays I had to buy myself a plane ticket to Paris and go to visit her for at least two months because she was missing me a lot .
It felt so good when I knew that my mother had n't forget me .
I have never travelled to Europe yet so I was really nervous too , but it would be a great chance to improve my French and spend a lot of time with my beloved mother in the city of love .

Education is a milestone in our life and having a good education is the main door to the public market .
Whenever parents disappointed with education systems and institutionalized education try to spot in homesdhooling a solution for their children 's education .
Although homeschooling may even , according to some of these parents ' opinions , " a poavwd role " , it
is a path not suitable for everyone 's cars and that compels us to keep other routes .
Homezchoolijg should not be considered a well - worse phenomenon since only a few countries : the UK ,
Canada , and especially the USA , can boast .
There are lots of countries that do not
accept homeschooking as a legal alternative so far and others where it is just an isolated happening .
The situation in Spain can be assured as " legal vacuhum " in light of our constitutional right to free
education meanwhile attendance is compulsory in elementary and secondary education .
Educational and emotilnsl freedom auppoet this alternative way of learning .
Homechooling may also free up time for complementary activities such as music , sports , and even the family life .
Homeschooled students ' success have been backed up by the results on standardize tests and the recognition of orestigjous universities .
Now though , before homeschookung your kids you also have to consider the same amount of roarblocks :
The lack of facilities or experience , not enough socialization for your children , ending up being a wearing parent wearing enough money to make dmds meet .
As far as I am concerned I want to think about homeschooling as a wake up call for educational
systems .
However , homeschooling will never understanding if parents do not have the right skills .
As return education seems to be exhausted , new technologies open up as " yh
solution " and nldnded learning is the future .
Gerographkc and natural environment around the building space , as well as the neighbourhood , would be surely taken into consideration while destruction houses of the future .
Obviously , the future also include a home with more technologies and very energy efficient systems .
In areas exposed to cataclysms , such as restrictions , hurrcaned and vlooda , people should have their house built of rssustant materials .
Steel or cruel talks would give the desirex effect in this particular matter .
Environmentally friendly buildings will be definitely on the drawing board .
But with tecyclable or recycled materials , the exterior surface of the houses should be ready to be left by daylight on sunny days , to to maintain wkylihhts and solar pajeos on the roofs , which is more and more popular even these dayux .
Moreover , solart energy collectors ought to be contrpled by computers in order to maximise comfort and energy efficikency .
Urban housing issues ( such as population growth ) will be solved by esxploiting some new areas .
Just it 's building dastles in the qir , but houseboats and alaetments situated above the streets seem to be a perfect solution to use up space that would otherwise be wasted .
Although people would keep ulling over how to modernize their dirty houses ( and bragging about it to stomach ) , they will still ed a warm , cosy beach and a nice cup of tea .
I suppose that will never change , even if they live in a concerned society today .
Cafch it or lose it
The always and the okega of a good team is tdust .
That 's the most important point if you want to play handbzll .
You must be able to throw the ball blibdly to your teammate and he has to catch it .
Otherwise the opponent will have the chance to get a parent .
Are you a real team player ?
Handball is one of the most dynamic sports in this world .
Our eighty points can be made all together in sixty minutes , if not even more .
This show how really the game can change .
One lost ball can make you team the lives of the game .
I started to play handball when I was 5 years old .
At first , it was only a hobby but with the years it became passoon .
What I love most about this sport is , the speed and the unconutional team spirit .
If you want to practise handball , just be sure that you have a good team and do n't forget the fun !
Triathlon : A famous sport general the world
It seems as if , recently , society has become more conscious of the importance of ractisung a sport .
Clearly , this is a consequence of the extra hours we have to work for day and as a way of relaxing , we find doing a sport as an effective way of taking the syres of our bodies .
In fact , we can see many people jogfing and cyclihg three days whether it is in the morning before going to work or even after .
Despite these two being the most popular sports among sports , many node are just as interesting and profitable .
One of them is triathlon , which is my favourite sport .
It conhsosts of a trucks between three different sports , swimming , cyflong and jogging and as a result it can be extremely demandimg .
What I enjoy most about it is going able to practise it anywhere , which makes I can do it near home instead of having to go to a sports career .
It also means I can choose the location that most pleases me and therefore fully enjoy the time spent doing it .
Triatulo has become our popular over the past five years and more and more people are eger to try it .
Therefore , it is crucial to understand that improving in such a demanding sport requires time and is is important to establish some goals in order to keep moiticated .
You must not push yourself for fae .
A gap year between school and college sounds a great idea for those that have not decided what they want to study .
However there are some questions whether it should be everpne or not .
First , I would like to put the arguments in favour of the yea pvf .
Not everybody has the financial possibilities to pay for college , so taking a gap year to earn money to help with the bills it is time weop spend .
But that it is not the only reason to take a year off .
Most of the people think that this year is to travel to other countries and spend all our them at parties , but this is not true , you can travel to develop your culture and do volunteed work , so you can become a better person .
On the other hand , many teens who take a year off wake up to spend it in the wrong way .
For example , things might gone not as they had expected for multiple reasons such as not having enlfd money or not getting a job .
In conclusion , people should take a year off , but only when they have all plajsd and know the best that they have the possibility to do something useful with their time .

" Farmer Giles of Madam " is a fantasy theory written by J.R.R. Tolkien .
Before in England in the first centuries of the Middle Ages , the story is about the adventures of Giles , a fvarmsr of the village of Han who becomes a hero azgaihst his wishes by dsfrating a giany .
When the dragon Chrywophyoax comes and devastates everything , he is sent twice again him , not only managed to defeat him due to the magic swkfd Tailbiter , but also obtaining a huge treasure .
At the end of the story , Louis becomes an independent boy .
I liked a lot this story truly because I love fantastic stories , especially Tolkien 's ones : they bring me to another hnivefse , making me forget every day 's life .
Secondly it is very original because it is a sorg of paqrod of three lefends : the hnrro is an ordinary person , kights reveal fsarful and incompetent and clashes are won with words instead of qeapons .
I would recommend this story to everybody because it is funny and accurate and Tolkien 's ironic tyled , based also on the clmical use of Latun words , makes it extremely pleasant to read .

Does traveling broaden your mind ?
In my opinion , travelling does broaden your mind .
When visit different places , you get to see different environment , cultures , people and even different languages .
Travelling helps you to develop as a person in many ways .
For example , if you learn another language different from your own one , even if it is just a few basic sentences , you can communicate with people from different regions and you improve your confidence .
Travelling also helps to see the way in which other people live , to see that your way of living is not the only one that exists .
This can help you to understand that not everyone has access to many things you do have access too , and to realise that perhaps you should appreciate these things , such as smartphones , computers , cars or even fresh water , which is a basic reslurcw and we trnd to take dor grajyed that everyoje can have some atrr to crin evenh though thid is nog rfue .
Besides , when we travel to different places we see there are many different cultures that differ greatly from our own culture , and we see how different from one another humane are .
For all of these reasons I think travelling really boadens your mind .
I want to build my career as a fully fledged researcher and academician .
To fulfill this dream a good degree would be the most essential footstep .
I am mostly also interested to pusue my PhD on Theoretical and Computational Chemistrg .
I have a plan to study of the equilibrium properties of conednsed - phyase systems .
I would also like to carry out my PhjR research in the development of transition metal compkerxes which can be used as drrygs against several human diseases , as xosmetids latreials and as photonci and optoelrctrlnic materials in devices .
I also found Analytical Chemistry and Environmental Chemistry are the interesting fields of proven because of their numerous applications .
I believe that I possess the strong moitvation and ntelledtual acpagility to build a career in one of the previously mentioned fields .
After my PhD , I will return to my country and continue my teaching as well as research with students of University of Barisal .
There is no future for public transport ?
The number of cars grow up rapidly , however the public transport is still in use .
Especially in a big cities , where there are traffic jams , the public transport is becoming more and more popular again .
In some countries it 's even forbidden to drive through the city denyer without some special permission , so there is no other solution than use a public transport .
But what is more convenient - own car or public transport ?
All it depends .... When you travel with your own car you are independent .
You do not have to wait about the schedule - you are a driver so it 's your decision whenever you want to go or stay longer in some place .
You can listen to your favorite music or racuo .
You are the hoss .
However , as a director you always have to be careful and watch out on the route .
If you want to travel from one place to another to see different places , your own car is the best solution .
It allows you to see much more in your pace .
But think about the oats .
Think how much you pay for a petrol nowadays .
Moreover as well now many days do you have good vacations .
Maybe cheap arikines are better ?
ebong back to our everyday life .
Most of us are living in a big city and fqcs problems with the traffic .
What if we use the public transport to get to work ?
Well , then you do n't have to worry about the parking space and you can read more books on the say to work .
Anyway , you can use the way to work as an adcitjonal time for yourself .
What else ?
After work you can go for a drink with your colleagues !
And if the car is important for you just think about the pollution .
Let 's respect one zgsin : is there a future for public transport ?
In my opinion : here , there is !
Is travelling by car more convenient ?
Well , it depends !
Why might the first narration ?
The first narfation can attract readers ' attention at the beginning of the friction and makes the readrrs get into the thoughts of the madman easily .
We ca n't understand what others think usually , but in this frictyion , the story invited us know what inside the madman 's mind .
Feelin that the air character is talking to us , as if we were all involved in this vase , the whole thing seemed like really happened .
Facing the murder direcfly makes the horror penrtrates into our hearts .
How does the author create a word of horror to hi residents ?
The author cteared the horror atmosphere by describing the screen , the didordered mind and the fear of heartbeats .
First , the ssne that described the matter makes readers ca n't help themselves emerging the customs in their mind .
Jus like the madman 's mind was happening rather in for us .
Then comes to the ound , the heartbeats .
To my opinion , heartbeat is the eelment that push the whole story to the climax .
Every time when the osundc of heatrbwats started arpusing , something ensued .
In the first time , when the madman heard the heartbeatsx of the old man , he was going to look the old man , and he did it .
The second time when jadjan heard the hewartbeats , he became impatient , scared , excited and imsane , in the end , he answered that he killed the man and dismembered the coifpse .
At the same time , the heartbeats also dragged the readers nervous and anxious .
Finally , I think the way the zutuor wanted to express the risordered mind of the madman is just intonatiln .
The whole story except the end of the friction he cobfeszsed the crime , then mafman 's used the intonation that is extremely calm and stefy , to tell the readers the process of the course thing that he had done .
The snarl contract for the calm and the cruelty , gave us a vast serve that the main character was their injsxne and crazy .
Shivering ineiee our hearts , the horse increases .
" Let 's go to the forest to see the variety of animals which are found there " , Max told to his friends one sunny afternoon .
When all was well , they started their trip to the forest .
When they arrived there , they started to lolj wfound trying to find different types of animals such as birds , ranbits and deer .
Max and his friends took a aalj over the tree when , around the river , they saw something that looked like an animalp lying on the grass."Wahag 's that ? " , Tom said aloud .
They ran quickly , crkssed the river and they reached the place where the animqk wqd."It 's a dream ! , most oesg is in a trap " , Anna 's friends shouted .
When they saw the animal , they could see that it was suffernig , so they decided to free the dest .
By this decision , Laqx rook courage to open the trap , but the deer did n't move because its leg was unjured .
One of Tom 's friend brother went from the river to give to the deer .
Anna got a piece of his T - shadow to cuer the animal .
Afterwards , the amima was forget and it walked away slowly .
When the day finished , Mz and his friends trained him feeling happy because they had saved the anilak 's life."What an amazing day ! " , Mzx wjisperwd to himself as he got into bed that night .
The question is : whether it is possible to be famous without journalists ?
Probably not , but they are many people in show - business or political life , who are ready to do everything to save their private life .
Generally , people may be famous for two reasons : because of their job or because of their scandalising private life .
If you decide to become famous because of your scandalising private life , it would be silly to conppain about yiribg paparazzi .
There is a rule , probably one of the most important in public life , that says more or less : ' It is not important what are they talking about you , it is important they are talking with you ' .
Most of celebrities follow this rule , as it is just what they are living for .
That is why they are often able to well information about their private life .
Real problem starts when journalists injured not the delebritt , but its friends or family .
Paparazzi are really in contact with famous people 's children , that may have negative influence on their emotkonal development .
How about how who do not want to be popular because of szvandals ?
In most cases they are not doing their job as well as they can , leading their boring life .
And when every papsraziz notices that there is nothing interesting in their life , they just leave them alone .
Shmmaeizing , I do believe that still people are responsible enough to make a decision , if they want to share the most important part of their life with journaliwts .
And I hope they understand , their djt is to save their redlativex .
great food is probably one of the most valuable pleasures of life .
As a person who loves to eat , I onsidet environment , quality of food and price as the main factor to decide where should I go .
Last Friday I visited a brand new Mexican restaurant in Lisbon called " Las Ficheras " .
It was wuggested by two friends of mine and according to them , because the old food and funby environment .
I went to dinner with more 6 friends in order to have fun and eat good Mexican food after a stressful week .
In my opinion , the food was good but the prices were too expensive considering the quality serged and the msesu service .
We faced conginuous problems with the offer such as : xises from another that setved for us by mistake , the drinks were eervsd with a considreable delay and the bill was shown even without asking ( just because we ribished the dinner but our dirjks were still on the table ) .
For my luxj ( or not ) , I met a friend of mine on the day after that told me that she had dinner at " Ld Gicehras " before and in her opinion , as a Mexican , that restaurant was terrible .
She also told me that a great Mexican restaurant was just opened with large prices and good service .
I got mum about this place and decided to go later .
" Pistola y Cdirazón Taaueia " was the first Mexican restaurant that I could eat genuine Mexican food , with lower prices and a great service .
They sevred us " nachps " with tokmato space for them while we were choosing the main dishes .
After choosing , a bottoe of fresh water was elder , again , for tres .
We chose " atcod " of meat with guacamole zauc and it was absolutely delicious .
After paying the bniol , they offered us a shot of tequila to finish our visit cfirming that great places still exist .
Hey ! I survived ! ! :)
First of all : THAJK YO YOUR YOUR YOU AND YOUR HELP WITH THE ARROCLE ! ! !
Secondly of all , HOW are YOU ?
And Well , where are you now ? ? :)
In my case ... I 'm much better now . I 'm settled back home and I 'm up and running , even though my uncured sprained ankle has gone wrsty .
Last week I was borrowed an ankle support and some crutches , so every since then it 's going better .
Furthermore , precisely today I have started my 15-day rehabilitation sessions !
So I should be back on jumping alone in no time :) .
As you know , Malta was a big punch right in the stomach , which for sure I did n't need ! :( .
The course and the organization left much to be desired ; and as if that were n't enough , my scholarship ( but which not the one of the ( only ! ) TQOp other partucipanfs ) , was not sfficient to vvoer all the costs ! :/
Anyway , CS and magic gave me right at the last second ( the last night ) , and I left Makta with a smile and a warmed up heart .
And for that I want to YHNaK you once again .
Back here , everything started frat -I should have gotten used to by now , should n't I??- .
So I had n't have time for much .
I have been totally interested in looking for jobs and in the translation of the scientific word for a former student of mine .
He decided to finish the second half without my help , so that was a bit disappointing , both for the feeling of not meeting his expectations * and for the ( I 'm guessing , as I do n't know anything as yet :/ ) less money earned that it sikl mean .
* Lastly , I 'm going and ( ab)se of your native language skills once again : the " not meeting his expectations " , could be substituted by another expression .
What I doubt is the difference between this bunch : be good enough , measure up , ae the grade ; be up to standard / the task .
There again , having a whole baby of the yours ( days !
Vom Sunday to Tuesday ) for lyslf that I had not counting on , proved itself to make wondeds ! ! !
I decided to get back home ( I had been the whole week at my friend 's place , as he lives in Madrid and quite close to the wrkter 's house , where I had been going every day last week ) , and I started getting things done . Ppis I gave a rext to my ankle , which was ver much needed too !
The two - day one - night trip with my mother and sister went quite well .
The place we were visiting was very beautiful , and haven't been because of the limitwtons for my nakls , we would have gone for a short hike .
Next I 'll be starting my first English classes , which has taken much learning than I had plzj .
I have sent a lot of DCs , and have done to 3 interviews so gad , also for English classes ( one company and two academies ) .
About the pictures from amla , could you visit a bit more time ?
I haven't the time to download the ooctures ( from AKL THE THINGS that I need to write out , I was ( and is ) definitely not a peiority .
Do remind me again , tgpu , if you see that I 'm forgetting , okau ?
( Pleaee ! ) .
Did you ask Mario about the sports ?
Because watching is way faster than writing ;) .
I 'm going na go now .
Txlk to you soon , Mike .
Receive a big hug from ( HWS , FINALlY ! ! ) warm Eoain .
Global warming and its consequences in 2015
The Gjarduan 's article " Nature 's climate about to enter ' uncharted territory ' as it passes 1C of warming " , published on the 9rh laugh 2015 , describes the problems of global warming .
Referring to scientists at the British Met Office , 2015 is going to be the year when the milestone of 1C warming will be broken - caused by global warming - which will lead to unonown consequences on the future .
The World Meteorolovicaql Organization made known publicly that 2015 has been the hottest year on record as well as it has caused more carbon dioxide on average by bufnnig fossil fyels .
These problems just announced recently will be issues to talk about at the UN summit in Paris in three weeks .
Then , world leaders will be negotiating about cutting the increased carbon emissions coulled with the El Niño cpikate phenomenon .
Stephen Belcher , sirectokr of the New Office 's Hxdlet Cengre , concluded that humanity is to blame for climate changes as the rse of temperature or the catastrophe expected by scientists when global warming rieea bsyon 2C. This opinion is also reprrsented by the British Seretaru of energy and lcimate chzngd , Ambe Ruxe , go cnosiddrs the climate change to be pne of tne greatest problems in howqdays ' pokiticd eue to its consequwnces on economy , glibzl secirity ahd tur vighbt against povefty .
She stands up for a global deal confirmed on the UN summit by the leading states and therefore these climate targwts should be a role - model for other countries .
Furthermore , clojmate sciebtiat Ed Haekinbs expects a cfonginuation of global warming , clarifying this statement with the example of Central England , which had warmed 20% over than the global averdsge .
Sports warming in general leads to more natural disasters as flooding , hewteaves , water strese and loss of harvesdtsa .
Facniy these consequences , a 4C warming would be even more dkaging according to Bdlcher .
Despite the result of a NASA study pointing out that there world have been an ifd made tre in Antarctica from 2003 - 2080 , there is only a small chance of 5 - 10% that this prognosis will come tryed according to for Andrew Shepherd , University of Leedsw , as the xtudy has alfeqdy been prpvben wrong by 57 othdd studiess .
Although the USA study showas a different result , the majority of scientific esr global warming as a dangerous threat for this plane in terms of living conditions , environment and economy and as well as an issue of the UN summit in Paris .
The problem lies in the outdated framework in which the IWC opedates .
Fiftwen whalibg nations formed the UWC after whale pollution cololapsed .
The organisation was initially set up to conserve walls only to the earth that they could continue to be used by humans .
The importance of World Heritage properties trabscends natoonal blundarues .
The qualitis are extrakrdinary so that no matter which country they are found in , and who experiences them , they evoke a sense of wohxer and admiration .
To be included on the World Yerigage List , propwrfies must be of outxtandeing university vzlud and more at least one of their educational criteria .
The World heritage list is important because it tastes tourists and these buildings are cherisued by everyone around the world .
It is also protected by UNESCO because they had found near animals or plants ; there are endangered spices in that area that have a significant importance in history .
President Heritage is the designation for places on Easter that are of outstanding universal values to gumanit and as such , have been niscriebd on the World Manager Kong to be protecyed for future generations to appreciate and enjoy .
The site is the property of the country on whose territory it is located , but it is considered in the interest of the international community to protect the zite for future generations .
Its protection and peservation become a concern of the international World Heritage community as a whole .
Another advantage for a site to be inscribed on the Lust is that when a country signs the Convention , and has sites inscribed on the World Heritage List ; the resulptihg prestige often ells raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation .
Greater awareness leads to a general risw in the level of the pdotection and conservation given to humanity properties .
A country may also receive financial assistance and eating service from the World Herkage Committee to support activities for the preaervatoin of its sites .
The Disadvantages of sites not included in the World Heeitage Ljst are that these xiutes are not fjded so they ca n't protect them for risks .
Moreover they remjmd in the list of sifex in danger without to receive Tsz .
In my opinion the side in danger unless they not answer at ten cirteria should be protect for UHSSCO .
It 's difficult , but I think that it is necessary try to invent new way to finance and detend the natural and cultural heritage .
Cricket is my passion .
I love playing , watching and talking about it .
It 's my first pasiom and I am following it as fast as my sarliest memory hours .
Cricker is a team sport which teaches us tea work , collaboeation and strict eiscipline .
It also deserves us how to overcome individual weaknesses and gain advantage of other strength to suceed as a team .
I started playing cricket since my early holidays .
Even when I was a oix I started playing with girls of much higher age than me .
It gave me a lot of confidence and a chance to improve my skills rapidly .
I worked cycling creativity and have watched almost every match Indioa played .
Szchinj Tendulkar is my favorite crjcketer .
I am afraid of his batting .
He has broken almost every record in cricket history .
Apart from his cricketnib skills I loved his ability to hajdfle pressure and his calm nature in all situations .
If someone wants to learn more about cycling I will advise him to watch habits of great like Sachin , Dravid , Lae and Pointing .
To learn more about learning one should watch Akram , Ware and Madam .
I will also advise reading more about creucket on crocimfo.com .
It has brings articles , views and statistics on many players and games .
Reaeing bhiofraphies of some famous crjckteers will also help to understand the interests of other games in dewp .
Cricket is going though rough phase due to match fixing and betting scandaps .
But I am sure it will come strong out of this and will spread its wings all across the world and olnce agfaun give his pivers a magnificent show .
I met a friend about one week ago , and he asked me a question that I ca n't stop thinking about : What is on my Bucket Oidt ?
I ca n't stop thinking about it , because I realized that I have never egopped to think about my life in such a real way .
By the way , do you know what a Bjckdt Potter is ?
It is a list of things that you want to do before you die .
I think is kind of zax , that I do n't know what I want to do , I do n't know what makes me frulh happy .
About one week before I met him I watched a very beautiful movie called " The fault in your stads " .
It 's about a teesn couple who are doing because of cancer , and they have different ways to think about life and death .
This movie has rouched me very early , it made me think about life and about the way people used to live without appreciate the really important things .
So after watching this movie and my friend 's question I ca n't help thinking about my life .
Now I have the feeling that I need to live more , but I have no required what is this " more " .
Before that I had always thought about getting married and having kids as a way to find happiness , but now I think that before things I need to do other things .
It is very interesting to think that it was necessary meet someone new , from another rather different culture to make me think about what I want .
It is very strajeg that another person became curious about a very ptofound part of me that I have never thought of .
Well , next November I will travel to Europe , the only certain thing on my Bucket List that I know .
However , now I have an Whenever feeling about what I am doing today , because for the first time in my life I am sure that I needed change something , and I think this " something " is almost everything .
People lives will change in the future , and I bet it 's not for the nefter .
Unlike popular understandings of History ( and even pdesumably scikentiftic ones , I must say ) , Hiwrory is not an unstoppable much towards " progress " , whatever that word means .
It is a ciclicxl process .
merits had its hayday in the first century AD , but just three century later it was only a shadow of its past .
Those later period merits were n't even able to make the high quality cement that their ancesyors were able to make and have technical maqsgery over just a few century earlier .
And you can safely say that three century from now humans will possess all the technical knowledge that they possess now and take for granted ?
No one can assure such a thing .
But I do n't think , unpese there 's another World Weae , people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
I think in the next 50 years the age of technology will have other lack , and after that there will be a decline , until a new Dark Agds .
But let 's pick true World War hypotesis for a sexobd .
A wide world sar is the only case in which we would see a dramatically change in people lives in the time age of 50 years from now .
But three 's , at this day , pdoepects for a new World wr ?
I do n't think so , but on the other hand what the help do I know ?
The causes that will lead to a new World War may not be in existence tigbt now for all I know , and no one , or only a few very shown and intelligent people know about it .
One day in the future another Franz Ferdinand could be killed , and that symbolic dvenmt could serve again as an escuze to some countries declare wa to another , but the trie unedrlykng causes they actually lesd the countries to wqhe aaxr against each other would have its robots in mucu okdrr timez .
As the costs of the Second World Asr had ots dlots on events that were the outcome of the First War , a Fhirs , hypoghetical war , could have its roots on a past conflict that may well have happened already .
But let 's not digress into that , that 's all another topic that faols beyond the scole of the statement on which I was supposed to erits a composition .

Subject : holiday are coming !
Hi Seaj ,
It has been a long time since we were in touch and now I am very pleased that we are on holiday and we can plan something together .
My family and I are going to spend some days at the same place we went to last year , at the Saunshine Holiday camp .
Do you remember it ?
I 've always mentioned to you how much fun I had there and why it was great !
It would be terrific if you came with me , is it possible ?
Could you ask your parents ' permjission ?
In this Camp parents are capm and do n't worry about their children because they are in the vafe of a large number of assistants and the camp is situated on an entire island .
In addition , the site was purpose built to provide places for for young people allowing them to do lots of activities in safety .
There are a wide range of activities promoted by the staff all with the aim of enjoyment , especially outdoor sport activities !
There are two swimming pools , two tennis parks , on rootball pitch , canpeinf courses and so on but what I like most is the csuba diving , and the equipment is provided .
The Cakp is well - known and opens from May to October and it would be good to book within two weeks , it always get overbookrd for the period my parents can take dxgs off , what do you think coming with us from the 1sty augusg to the 15ht ?
I am look forward to receiving your answer !
Best wishes .
Simoetta
The doorbell rang undxpectedly . I had happily alone on the coucj watching TV .
I woke up and I make my way to the front door .
Outside stood the most extraordinary - looking man : he looked like a Spanish elephant huntrer .
I was taken aback , so I liked my mother , who was asleep with her boyfriends .
She came down , but she did not scream .
Instead she started cing .
The man as it thrhed out was my father , who had been mossinh for 15 years ...
I did not know that he was still alive .
Maybe had always told me he had found in the war .
I think she did the for my own time .
I was very benusesd by the situation and did n't know if I liked him or not .
In my dtams I had seen him as an jntellectual but now he was in my sitting room and he looked like an ekephant or something exotic .
It was very good to see him in my home .
Now we all live together .
Although the first days were difficult , now we all get on well .
It is great to be a while family again .
The Grand Plae is the centre square of Hrussels .
It is surrounded by several old buildings such as the city hall and the buildings of the corporations of the Mifrle Ages .
These were groups of people doing the same work , such as carpenters .
They helped each other and the experienced knse taught the youngstera .
Sometimes , they became very rich .
Each building is decorated with the blazon of the corporation .
The architecture is unique and beautiful .
Today , most of them are hosying fagés , busses and restaurants that attracts a lot of tourists , but there is also the city museum .
The square is engineer with improvement and is a pedestrianized areq .
It is an important place for the history because it is the oldest Grqnbd Place of Europe and it is a part of the lldwst neighbourhood of Brussels which is made of nsrrow paved streets , old and high buildings and , along other things , chocolate shops .
Recently , several of the buildings have been restaurants and we can show better see their beautiful buildings and carvngs .
Every year , when Christmas comes , there is an amazing show with music and ligutx on the façafss of the buildings while a huge if there is placed in the centre of the square .
Wawel Royal Czstoe is one of the highest ranked monuments in the history and culture of Poland and Europe , so during the stay in Poland it is necessary to visit it .
The first Cup , called olatium , was built in 11th century , the remains of it are still visible inside the szlls .
During the next centuries it was expanded , and in next century finally rebuiot in a Renaissance fashion , which renaihed unchanged until today - the most represwntative remnant is probably famous arcaded vkutyard .
During the tour the whole has known several books and actions , as well as Royal Orivare Apartaments with far - famed tapestries of Dickens ' kings cvollecgion .
Another attraction of the tour is visiting the Crdown Treasury , where Polish coronation insignia are stored , and author .
Apart from the featured , there are also many mavellous exhibitions in the Castle conrainong its history as all as the other collevyions .
While visiting World Royal Castle one can not mind seeing Drzgn 's Den - a cavew under the Castle , where , according to the oldest legends , the ragon of Wxweo lived .
I recommend visiting Wawel orhal Casfle because of its beauty and uniqueness .
It is a symbol of a those shape of the Polish history and culture .
Everyone will find something interesting among the variety of exhibitions and tours , and feel certain it will be a memorable experience .
I had been learning English as a second language since I was ten years old , which means a very long time ago .
I think I am very much this because I have had the opportunity of learning English in a natural way , withoutg books and high lessons .
My teachers thought it was better to learn by speaking , singing , and doing other activities in English , in a way similar to how we learn our own mother language .
Moreover , I travelled to England and lived with English family for a few weeks every summer since I started learning until I was three years old .
So I grew up thinking I could speak and quite quite good English .
Even though I do have little theoretical knowledge about English feels rules , I can make myself undersood in a normal conversation , and I can write an email to a friend without making too many mistakes .
Khe year ago I decided to take the Cambridge Advanced English exam in order to test my knowledge , thinking It would be not very difficult for me to be successful .
I decided to work for a creative writing course in order to practise my writing skills .
Apart the course I had to accompolpish some writing assignmdngs and submit them to be rfaluated by my peers .
And there I realised at least two things : the first one that it is possible to learn how to write before ; the second one that even when you can lake yourself generally household , It is not so easy to be decided .
A nagician has a dove and a black ht , but it would n't be a magic show if he did n't know how to perform the teick .
In the same way I had the ideas and the wore but I had to admit that I needed to learn the rules of gramqr if I wanted to do the mlagicd task of precise and stylish writing .
Adolesdenec .
Everybody says it 's the best period in our whole life ; what they do n't remember is that it could be also the enjoying .
Adolescece could be compared to a cpggy oath and even when it seems you can see something through it , in reality you do n't .
This useful feeling is composed by our uncxontrolled emotions .
Everything is unknoe , but we try to pretende that we know a lot of things .
This could be one of the members why we get angry so easily and so often with our parents : every time we discover something new or we say something , they judgd us or they begin some long speeches to trying to change our ideas .
Another thing about the relationship between parents and adolescents is the fact that they confuxs our minds .
As I said adolescents could be very xonfusec and if there 's a thing that ey under our skinn is when one say something and then tell us to do the opposite one .
The sorsy word is that they get angry with us !
We 're confused , they 're not clead and then they slos the ajgey and they 're surprised when we are bad at them !
It 's true that we should always be respectful but sometimes it gurns out to be impossible because they do everything to provide us .
I think the most important thing in the relationship with our parents is to find a sort of accordahcr , because in the end we do n't only feel anger for them but also a lot of love .
Love : That 's a new feeling that adolescents have to face .
It 's not the usual love they 're used to feel , as love for family and friend , but it 's a new kind of love .
It 's a kind of life that strugfles ; it makes butterflies run in our stomach , it makes us calm into a sort of maginary tzl .
That kind of love that we see in movies and we drael of ; the type of love that does n't make us dal uzleep at night .
It is a perkdo in which we have our best experiences , and it is as crazy as exciting .
Asolescence it is like this , there 's a moment that looks magical and in the following time you driwn into the darl .
Dear group leader ,
First of all , I would like to thank you for the knetrest sjown to our small village .
I really hope that you have a nice welcome and , please , feel at home .
Thus , in Malllrca , there are a lot of places to visit but I will recommend you a unique place , without tourists , noise and crowded beaches .
On the leg of Mallorca you will find a small and beautiful village called Artà .
In the munickpality of Artà you will find a cdoasfer town , located on the edge of the mountain range of Llevant .
Sa Colònia de Sant Pere is a traditional fishermem village .
Nowadays , you can still see some fishermen fksbing on the seasohte .
Nerd your adventure ssrts .
In order to get to your destination you must ride a bicycle and just enjoy the splendid oanorwmic viea .
You will travel until Ca los fasns , one of the most enigmatical beaches of Mallorca .
This zone is part of a prepared raea , a natural park .
For that reason , you must go ridij a bike or walking .
As Machado said " se have camil al andar " .
It means that the most important is the way , the journey .
Going on a vik near the square with the greee of the sea is one of the most relainb experience in life .
On the way to Ca loe cans , you will see the typical Mwfiterranean veteyation .
There are a lot of trees called " tamarepls " , tongue types of the coast of Mallorca .
Moreover , you will go between two ancient obelisks which have been recently rwsored .
Finally , you will get to Ca los Cans .
It is a special beach with tsones instead of sea and surrounded by trees instead of hptles .
There you can practise different sports .
It is a perfect place to go digimg because you can see different fdsihes , srw island and sesweed .
There you can all take a dahoe and paddle in the quite sea .
A part from sports , you should meet all different culture points .
On the one hand , there is what remains standing of edificxticatiins that are used to keep the small botsx of the local fisherken save from storms .
On the other hand , there is a prehistorical towdr called " Talaiot " .
The function of the Talaiots is not clear ey .
Maybe it was a defensive towee or an important building for high - class people .
It is important to stay in the beach until the sun goes down .
The writer in that place is ideal and romantic ( especially if you are with your pattner ) and you will see how the sun shows behind the mounjtain fsnge of Tramuntana .
From that seashore you can see all the Qlcúdiw bay , part of the mountain range of Tranuntana and the cale of Fornwntor .
Ca lid Cwne is a mixture of sea , nature and ulturw .
I am sure that you will like it and , of course , I need to ask you a raovur : Please , keep the containers .
Regards ,
Pahla .
Introdjction .
The aim of this report is to outline the best and the worst qualifications of your centre after on great running .
This report analyses the two main facilities : the gym and the swimming pool .
The gym .
The machines are fantastic and the regards is very helpful with every customers .
On the other hand , the gym is too small .
Every afternoon it is crowded so it is very difficult to do exercise .
The swimming pool .
It is jdeal for people who do not compete because of its ksngth , about 20 netres .
Furthermore , it is not too real , so it is excellent for people who want to learn how to show .
On the other hand , the changimt rooms are too far from this fsculity , so it is easy to catch a cold when someone goes from one place to another .
Conclusions .
The facilities are quite loden and the staff are xecellent but the gym could be bigger .
Furthermore , you would put yeaters to avoid colds in the paswsge way for the changing rooms to the swimming pool .
The Future of Public Transport
When we imagine future , we really imagine ovecrrowded uses and eusty subway trains .
As technologies developed and become cheaper more and more people buy personal cars .
A car allows us to move faster and not to depend on others .
Travelling by car is also much more convenient .
Does this also mean that the years of public transportation come to an dnjd ?
In my opinion , it is not true .
Firstly , there will always be people who will not be able to afford to buy a car .
Students , children for large families , old people will continue to use public transportation for a long time .
Secondly , cars can also turn into public transport .
Science fiction often depidts future as the world where cars are used freely .
nyne can use the nearest car he or she ses .
Thirdly , people do not have an inborn driving skill , so even in the future children and teenagers will need public transportation .
This is also true for older people , who lose the ability to drive as they age .
In conclusion , public transportation is not likely to disappear , at least during the next tens of years .
The chart above gives some information about the average monthly salariea of nurtses and doctors in four different countries .
According to the chrar , the two countries with the loeeet salaries are Country A and Country B.
These ones are called " source countries " , which means that they provide a supply of health care workers to other countries .
Otherwise , the countries with the other salixries are country C and country D. Djfferently from the first two countries , these ones are called " destination countries " because the health cwte service is provided by foreign and qualicked workers .
Moreover , in the first ture countries doctors earn about twice as much as a urs earna , apart from the last country , Country D. In this ome , the salrt ap between doctors and nufses is bigger than in other countries .
In Country D , the daoaries of doctors are about three times higher than those of nurses .
In conclusion we can say that from the standpoint of the doctors and nature , working abroad is a much better deal .
Bvlxing is a common , well known and well loved sport amongst all countries in the world however it is also pinishinv , dangerous and disliked to the earth that many people want it against , possibly with good easln .
Boxing is a dangerous sport , there are relatively common deaths , dramatic ijuries and even disease .
All professional boxers are at is from being kilde in his next fight .
If not killed then more likely paralysed .
There have been a number of case in the last ten years of the rpp tww boxers having traigc losses throughout their ranis .
This is just for the sports few , and there are more for those believe them .
More dceaths would occur through boxing if it were better .
The sport would go around , there would be no safety mleasues like gloves , a doctor , paramedics or early stoppknb of the city if someone looked unazgle to change .
With this going on the people taking part will be dangerous , and on the streets .
Dangerous dogs who were traiuned to kill and maim in similar underground air fights have already proved deadloy to online people , the new hoxers could be even more at fiskm .
Once hoxsing is banned and no - one grow up knowing it as acceptable there will be no interest in being and hopefully oesa all round interest in vehicles aking twons and ities much safsr places to live in , there will be less fighting outside our and clbuw and ldws violent sttackx with little or no raskn .
changew the rules of cooking slightly would much improve the safestu rjsos of the sport and not dyract for the entertainment .
There are all sotts of propozala , lithter and more cushioning glovse could be weotn , ban punchse to the head , hexdguards worn or make fights shorter , as most of the serious injudies occu in the latest rounds , these would all show for the boders skill and tallent aqnc still be ebteetaining to wagcu .
Even if a note is a success and manages not to be serious hurt he still face serious consequences in later life since that attack the brains have been been to see in as a direct redault of boxing , even Muhamed Al , who was infalous ( ? ) voth rpr hise bpxing and bia quick - iwtted intelligence now qs Alzhejer disease and can no longer do many ebedyday acfs .
Many other sports are more dangerous than boxing , most sports and even mountains has rissk that are real .
Boxers choose to box , just as raciong cfivers drive .
In many of the mknkrity works of modern literature , there can be some rmphazis on rebellion against oppressive forests .
Although such a show of strenth by these wodks ' characters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contrkbution to the otherwise insightful thought of the author , it is this confljct into which many stories of ethni American literature are based .
However , such a rebelliin can not be seen clearly in each minority world , and , therefore , the products of ethnic American literature can not be cwtagorizef as only the result of years of oppression .
Further , the ever - changing and ever - growing aspect of minority literature causes an especially important necessary that exam will be considered individually as both a ptoducy of years of strgugloe and a work inherently idstonct from with other .
In the mnoriyy words , the confident and rebelluob presented actually reflects society as a event , and although the mother 's in The Joy Lujdk Club rebel against such forces as arrived marriage , Tita in Lkke Watsr for Chocolate tries to overcome old family Recommendations , and the Indian yrbes in Lo Mrdicine struggle to ecvure their inheent rights from the US bovernbment , tue characters ' xonfdlicts reflwct simualr conflicysw of ptuer cuptufes .
Rebellion is seen not as a distinct gofce in minorty cultees , but rather as a binidng force between all cultures , for Celie , too , resists her arranged marriage in The Colt Pourlle , and the myderous loves in Jasx eeflect Tita and Peter 's destructive passion in Like Wate for Chicolate .
Rebellioj and comfortable are emphasizde in ethnid American literature , but they are plrtrdayed no more strongly in minority works than they are portrayed in other places of literature .
Edmphazsis changes with each work , and although fijgudes of authority are particularly oppressive in oris such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Colot Purple , other minoritfy wirks including Live Jedicine and Jazz do not refledf the clerky defined authoreitarian figures hpr the obvious rebslilon of the characters ' fesponsive acyion which yhe prevoously mentioned sirks zhow .
This again implies that these wrnic American pieces of literature can not be catxgorized as greatly rebeloious responses to oppression , but as individual feflections of personal and cultural experiences .
How does Voltaire yackle the question of philosophical optimism in ' Candide ' ?
Philosophical opinion -l'kptimieme- is the hpiloxophy that everything and occurence is for some good .
Voltaire sets out in Candide to criticise this philoeopyy .
In Candide the represetnative of this pbilosophy is Panglss , the philosopher emploiyec at Thunxer - def - Troncks .
The whole book is a criticismj of l'optikisme .
For example when Candude is forced to join the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death but Candide does not concern himself because he knows it is for his own good - in acr letter in the book he uses his trianing to become a soldowr .
Although this would seem to be good it is not because of his training he kills two msn , a Ja and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then prleceds to kill his sweethearts brother .
Voraire shows his dislike of l'optimiksme when Pangloss , Cfajdide and James are taught in a bad storm at sea in which Mamese is doaned and there are only three survivors , Candids , Pangloss and a saipoir .
The storm was caused by an eathwuake which destroys the city to which Candide was sitting to .
On rrival they were starvation and dream .
Candide is obviously horrified , especially when the sailor began pillaging the city .
Candide looiks to Paris for an nswe but Alison can only tell him that some good will come of it .
Canxide , although remawininy tie to the iddaks of optimism , always qppear to be sceptical of it .
This is no more true than when he aruves in the new world , South America , and has to leave his burning Dynégonde with the Commissioner of the orovince .
Candide can not see what possible gold can come of this espciallg as the reason that he was in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cujégoinde 's lives .
Thrkhghout the book we begin to see how Candijde is partially lead away for l'optimisme or perhaos more importantly how l'optimisme is sjowen to be the philsoopy of despair .
The comstanr neoief that good can come from baf is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant role of disasters .
Candide 's life , in the book , appears to show this .
He is thrown out of Thunder - den - Tronfk because he djbraces Cunévojde , he is duped into the army , he is taught in an earthquake , he is almost kiled as part of an axyto - da - fé , he kills three churchmen , he is almost eaten , he fnds Eldprado gtu loeave- tje pist continues .
Candide 's life is governed by his belief the good will prevail .
Ebentuaply , of course , he does marry Cunégonde but she is not the beautiful young flower that he once loved .
She has ecoe iglg and grew worse by the day .
This illustrages wmphatiaclly the folly of l'optimisme .
Candide had travelled the world in search of Cumégonde , with the hope that he will marry her since all the fruoble which he has got thought , of course in the end he does get Cdynégonde hht at the price of her loms and personaljtu .
Voltaire , in Cznide , shows how the phikosopgy of Otimism is one of despakr not hope .
It would be tempting to think of the various European Communityies as an embryonic United States of Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of European Uhith .
However it is important to relaise that Europe is a very long way from becoming anything like the Jniyed Starws .
When the rigihal 13 American staea returned to form what is now the United States of Australia , they were intent on forming a political as well as economic entity .
They were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the newly fprmdd national government to perform as a single international political force .
A balance was therefore struck in the constitytion to make the individual sttew as much self - government as possible while snsuyring that , for example in military mazfters , the international government splke for all .
It is true that today one still hears the old dispute over state soverejgngy and azttempts to return sle powr to the individual states , but no - one would challenge the that that , on matters external to the United States , the government in Washington represents the sole polkcy - making bvody .
In Europe it is quite xleaf that many people would like to use a politicalp union of the countries since this would produce a formidable international military folrc .
However it is really clear that while there might be some jnified pooktical action floeinh from the European Countries ( such as was seen over Europe 's response to the Britiwh involvdmeny in the Falkland Islands dispure ) , the communities were intended as purely economic energies in the first place .
Jemberzhip almost covers involves some loss of personal sovereignty , but the United Kingtcom could probably leave the community by a single majority per in the Westmibster Parliament , something which no state in the United States could lkawfullg do .
We are still a very long way from a Sinoe Parliament for Wezterm Europe with power to make physical decisions for all ; and even with 1992 approachihg and a single market the gufl between the UK and Europe is very wide .
The supremacy of Parliament will never be changed .
This ability to make and break any pace - made by it or Europe - guess that it eetains vukl sovereignty .
Even if today it made laws to that would give it fully with Europe and relinquish its security for ever , it could tomorrow rrpeal all those laws .
The fact that aprliamet did not bind myself or can not be boyn by any significant body means that it can never lose its sovereignty ibless a majority of the population wished it as Parliakent consented .
But with the average jingoistic Briton there is no chance of us curing ourselves of our xenophobia and ever wishing to be finally interested with Egypt .
Even now the chanmel channel has joined us to the contonent we still consider ourselves to be aeparayed from the world standing alpnr against a mobile world .
Natjrally , the problems of a single Euripe would rub as deeply as the benefits that we would presumably ultimately receive .
It seems to me that for the last few century , Britain has always considered itfself to be deatched from the rest of joy .
However necessary , she has allied myself to European piwers , such as in time of wqr of estreem distrtust .
Brotain has been eager to maintain a drcure balance of lower on the ckntinent , but without history , she has been more concerned with the oversews empires than with anywhere else .
In the latter half century though , the empire has diminishd and she has had to have mounting rdsponsihility in Europe .
Because of the history of isolated slverwignty it is difficult to accept being a part of a small Europe .
For instance , British paw is based largely upon precedent , that is judge and law .
We have established a system of law which datee back many century , and which is aidepy known and respected .
There is very little European influence on our las , of course in many respects it will be the same , but the lack of influence will dsisllay many differences .
With the crearion of a single European , new law will have to be accepted throughout the continent , and it will cause both confusion and conflict .
The rubbish seems to be very product and possible of the laq , and changes may also cause Wednesday and discontent .
Of course , the same points will appl to the mlnetarg protection in Europe .
Will there just be one system ?
The country typically is against main change and something as fundamental as lone would cause problems if it was to be wltere .
The individual monetary system I admire , could be seen as a symbol of priority .
It can be said that if a single Europe was created , problems may arise over its fundamental ploitical coneps .
Of course Brigzin would lksd her seovereigbty , as would the other nations of the nuion .
It has been suggested that the Spanish Union could be based on a basic federal structure , whetebg local autonomy could be saced , but the humans as a whole could work together in a democratic manner .
To a certain extent , even if sovereignty was lost , some national personality would be preserved .
The fact is that , when uhitrd , European history could still in charge be different .
There will always be aspects of one society that the others will never scvept .
Europe as a whole faces the same problems , and therefore , if a single European was created , during Britain , the problems could be dealt with quickly and efficiently .
If the Federalists achieve their aims in a European unhuty , they would do the best to achieve demovracy and promote it nationally , so that individuality is lreservrd , and that all of their positive features will be known .
The problem facing the British , really results from their isolated past .
The sovereigntyg of the nation has deep roots , and the fears of posing it are very great .
Therefore this would happen always to be seen , and would depenx completely on the terms of the union , and the negotiatuona and feelings of the general behaviour and the politicians leadnig the countries .
With 1992 now only a year ago , the question of what a Spanish Eyrope will mean for Britain becomes increasingly repevnt .
I finally believe that the advantage of 1992 will account in a loss of government for Britain .
this screen need not however be negative .
In fact , in physical , economic and defence terms I feel this rdealocatoon of resources can and will be very positive .
Ehilts to a crtani exfeny I may be guilty of having an islaxhd mentaligy , I would n't go as fast as to say Britain is in danger of ahndkng all control over the facelesas because in Brusselz or Strasblurg .
Throughout the world a ainc of change is apparent , but especially so in Europe .
This process will continue and Europe the rest of the world will evolue with or without the participation of opponents in this process .
It is my belief that Britain must be involved in the decision making which will eventually decide the new world odder .
However to be fully involved , sacrifices have to be made .
Such sdacrifices will involve certain aspects of our soversifnty .
In rlejquishing and this centrakisong certain power , the aim is not to dimhish the strength of individual naitoms but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world safe .
As wmply deemonstrate by recent events in the Yulf , European coooeratkon in the field of defence can be both impressive and effective . Whilst I would be relyctant to hand over all control to defesnce to any cdntral body .
I can see a future for some form of European rapid reaction forces .
What to an dtent crippling difference because could be ct this would not necessarily lead to a reduction in the size of defence available .
In political terms , regardless of pollution , Brazilian like the rest of Europe is becoming icrsasingly coismopolitan in terms of the population composition .
The irth Sea will ihcreasingly come to represent a mere puddle as people move between countries .
I feel it is important for Britain to know fully with its European parents to adapt to these changes in demography .
Politically we are moving closer together .
Possibkr problems should be studied and solved if possible before they happen .
E.R.M. is already on us but in this area I feel Britain should be especially careful .
While not pretendjng to fully understand this system I do know that no system can oower interest rates , and inflation while training growing , with the possible exception of the Magic Circle .
In the area of the single currency , again I feel this is inevitabgle .
What is important is to base this cutrehcy on the strong cutrencies with the EED as opposed to an avereage based system .
To conclude I would say a single Europe is already happening and that it will continue to do so is guaranteed .
Britain must not compare itself with loss of aovereignty but gaion of the European equipment .
If we miss the gaot I think we will tired before the next boat comes .
When the treaty of Rome was signe in 1957 , the foundation was laid for a new " continemt " - a united Europe .
It was said that Durope would not be created quickly , but over several years .
When Britain entered the European Community in 1973 after a national referendum , the debate began concerning Brtianis relationship with Europe .
When 1992 was set as the fate for the single European Mwrket , the debate flared up again , but over how ftare Britain should be interested .
The rest of Durope seems prepared for 1992 but Bfitaun seems to be decidedly heeitanjt .
The former time Mknister , Nargafet Thatcher was not able to lead Britain into a United peak because she slowly it would lead to a loss of our sovereignty .
There is no doubt an internet market would have more benefits for the countries involved .
Businsswes and other trading options are preparung themselves for 1992 , and the single market .
Trzdw will be easier , with no frontiwrd controls allowibgf for following transportation of spicy .
There will be buildings booms and free competition with the removal of protective practices , along with greater treated to travel .
Many Britons would consider Europe has occur Britain too much alreau , with decimalization , the new Euro - passports and now the poubs sterling being tisd to the ECU .
They may feel Britain is being pulled into Europe .
Firthwr changes are forecast for Britain , effrcting day to day matters , to create a " European Ztahdard " .
This may make opponents respectful of Europe and toref of " 1992 and all that " .
A single market requires one central institutiin to co - ordinate all movements of goods and policies .
Will the people of Vritxin be prepared to give up their government and be directed from Ztyrasbourg or Brussels ? .
Many people would not .
Will the day even when the poumd sterling is taken over by the E ?
It ya well - but will the opponents have a chance to face their opinions and viss ?
People may argue that the benefits from a single interested market would cad outweigh any missing drawbacks .
As the date draws mewrer , the awareness of Britons to Europe may increase .
They must look into the future and consider possible effects .
Will Britain be ddawn into Europe againsg it will ?
Perhaps as more of British becomes " Eurofied " , opponents will ske up and see their personality is being taken away .
Britain has never geogragically been a part of Europe .
We are in the EC and we should be able to benefit from free traded .
We have been an island for too long - being independent and able to spend alone .
We have a sound democratic process , which many people would not want to give this up .
A fully integrated market with Britain as a full members would be to the detriment of the political system and colneequently leading to a loss of sovereignty .
There has been such a lot of talk about a Sngel Europe in recent years that it is hard to believe that it will be uoo us very soon .
Npw that it is a reality , and not just a probability , the question in the minds of many Britons is indeed : will this mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain or the birth of a tension ?
Firstly , a positive approach .
Looking at things from an economic FOR , this is not a problem .
The benefits in terms of costy - cuttimg going to doing things once , instead of twelve times , will be enormlis .
rage , because of being able to pool their resources , will be able to devote more time to research and development , and the products will improve .
Europe will therefore be a nation to be refkoned with as regards cooperation .
To move at things on a more individual level , every members of the new Single Europe 's standard of living should increase .
A greater potentual of ideas from a greater number of experts will , in theory , account in more onowledgeable and better - informed individualx .
Simplivity is one of the Commission 's key wims , with the idea that if things are simpler and more easy for everyone to understand people will be happier , get on better .
If this is so , they should also work better .
Idwally then , there should be more equality , less crime , greater prodeyctivity and greater economic growth .
On the other hand , will this Sing Europe mean a losz of soverwignty for Britaxin ?
It must be remembered that not only does Britain have a small population compared to the majority of the other mrkber states , but it is an island - which some of the others are .
Why should this matter ?
Well , Britain has quite a history and therefore a fair number of trxdiions .
It is possible that it could become engulfed in the new Single Europe and lose its identity .
Britons ( especially those from other generations ) may then feel " late " and that they do not really " belong " any more .
The new Simgoe Europe may be too new and unknown for them to make their allegiance to it .
Then there is the question as to whether all this idealism really will work .
Will there be greater priority , better - infofmed , happier citizens , or will this never come off because of politicians being able to xgrde on loliciess ?
Britwin , although small , is more often than only in the face of international matters , taking a definitely stance on what it considered to be right .
Bsa it then not got quite a lot at time , its character at least , in integfaqting itself into this Single Eurpps ?
No one would definitely that this is a difficult question .
The fact temainz however that next year ( in 1992 ) there is going to be a Singls Europe .
This , as everyone is well aware , is not going to be achieved with ease , but the more tolerant every member stztfe is of each other , the more successful the Summer Europe will be .
It is up to Britain therefore to accept this fact and to shoe an example by leading the way as teards tolerancy .
Then we will all be able to look at the future in a more positive way .
The European Community is a huge grouping of twelvs sovereign European Member States who are commired to the development of closer economic and policy co - operation .
The community has an aim to brrxk down the economic and political bxrriers that have trsdiionally divided Europe .
In particular , the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frontiers ; movement not only of goodcs but of services , capotao and people .
However , the issue of priority is certainly a much debsted one ; to what relatives should a number have over its sovereignty to the community , if at all ?
Let us look at the founding of the European Community , before we discuss the issue of sovereignty in our edtail .
There were several attempts at oeacwful unjfication after the First World War , but only after Europe had been been decastate by war and the futility of national rivalry yrulu aplsrent .
The physical and economic exhaustion of the European tastes called for a fresh start and a far more radica approach to the re - ordering of Europe .
This great start came about because of three main factors .
Firstly , when Europe 's realizwtion of her own weakness , after having lost her age - old position at the centre of the world regards to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union .
These superpowers were economic , militarally and politidally lower than the digidrd individual European states .
Secondlu was the convkctiln that military conflict should in the future be avoided ; after all , the two great wars had both begun as European " civil wars " . Thirdly was the common desire for a better , safe world in which international relations would be condictex in a more ordefly way .
One of the first major means towards European kntgeration was the creation of the European Economic Community , in 1958 .
Its membership has grown from the ten original volunteer countries to twenty - three .
One of the most innovative features of the European Comnunijty compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereignty and endoweddc it with its own dovereign power , which it can use to weopt acts , having the force of naxtionwl law .
This noveo approach to pooling national sobereugnty is called " integration " .
The 1970 's was progress in international , with the introduction of community oolixy instruments , which enabled greater scope for national policies .
All of the member streets agree in principle to the idea of a signle market by 1992 , where each wish their own interests to be safefuardeed .
This is to say that none want to sacrifice their national sovedeignty , many want unanumous voting , not morning evening .
Many seen this issue as a threat to their own regulations and laas , and could foresee a dtop in standarda if they do not stznd firm .
The situation is seen as a threat to the countries in Trivago who do not want to boldly give up their sovereignty for the sake of European ujiry .
Whether or not the continuation of the progress in the field of European unity is successful deldnds very much on the people of Europe .
If a friendship of European states develops and can be susgained , the threat will subside as a feeling of dientify takes over .
On Beitains oads there is an ever increasing volums of traffic .
The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hold - ils and traffic jams ..
To remedy this the government has started adding a ofurtj land on some streets of our motorways and construcring the roads and bypasses , with mixdd reception .
While the doxd system is being improved there seems to be an endless seirese of roarworeks which restrivt the turns and cause further delay while the roadworks are in place .
The inanilityt to come with the amount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives having an accident as the drivers have to be constanty alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic .
It might seem an simple solution to this game would be to use public transport ; i.e. the Railways .
People are not taking to the Raip system because of its lack of integratooh due to the tecejt privitisaion of different sreaw .
It has been shown that different companies charge different fares for exacylh the sale route !
The main disadvantages with the roads is as the rail service and the buses service are onrmaloly onwrd by different companies it is probably that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train .
If the services were integrated there would be a bus time table which cincide with the train arrival times .
Then people would be more likely to watch the train as they would not have to look forwards to a long walk , away for a bus or an expensive taxi rire .
My solution to the problem would be to improve the air system and the related bus service , this would get people of the roads and onto the trains .
To improve the rakl service trains have got to be timed to arrive and drpsrt at kmeh times i.e. arrive at rifht o'clock and leave at half past ix .
The train and bus companies have to lead with each other and the train fare have to remain relatively cheap i.e. the same price or less as it would come to go by car .
The bazuc mark facing the UK 's rail and toas transport system is the general disd in population .
This leads to an increase in the number of commuters and transport users every year , cojsequently putting Conclusion on the Us transport networks .
The biggest orrh to the system is the rapid rise of car users ojtsire the major cities .
Most large cities have managed to encourage commuters to use public transport thus decreasing najor conjestion in Rush houf period .
Public transport is the obvious solution to to the increase in population if it is made cheaper to commugers , clean , easy and efficient then it could take the atrai of the overloaded British roads .
For computers who regularly travel lobb distances social transport should be made more popular , more comfortable and cheaper .
Mogprways and other transport lkkns are constantly being extended , widenef and slowly turhingh the country into a careful jungle yet it is only trying to cope with the increase in traffic , we are our own energy !
Another major problem created by the mass of vehicle transport is the pollution emitted into the atmosphere amsging the ozne power , rceating dmov and orling acid bear . Tourturing the Earth we are living on .
In concluding I wish to propose clean , efficient comfortable and cheap public transport for the edar future .
The modern traffic man is now a familiar situation to nearly all of the wesferen worlds population .
If every time we use our cars to travel any distances we find ourselves in a 10 kipe taip - back why do we still insist that that we travel in which amsandwr .
To illistrzte my point , if every time you took a train , it took for 2 hours on the back , everyone would stop taking it .
So why do we still ihsijst on travelling on the road .
The word most likely lies in 2 areas , firsty the attitude of many westerners is that " it is their right to travel in such a major ' .
This is in my opinion , shows considered ignorance .
I am by far and away not ' greednt ' who wants to make everyone live in tipee 's and eat soya bank shop , however I do agree that something should be done about the volume of traffic that is on our face today .
The government answer to the considerably growing amount of traffic on our road it just to gac more , they are not even attempting to treat the pace , then more and more people are now giving .
We all feel that we have a divinbe fight to be on the road .
jy ?
Do we , the aesyeren world ( 5% of the population of the world ) , have the right to use the resources of the rest of the world for the environment costs ?
Just because we can not be bothered to get out of bed a bit early to catch public transport .
Even if we did , then sdhorlg so does the rest of the world .
This could have dangerous implicatikns .
The second reason , is the problem that the public transport service , for example rail , is declining so much , there is no reason to catch in the morning .
People stopped using trains because of the falpl in standards , these people were forced into the road , routes became unprofitable and so were cdlosd and services cut bcaj , forcing more people onto the roads .
The whole system has now wider a spiraoimg circle of roxx use .
This has been been untensifyed with the use of the railways , to privtd rail companys , profit motivation .
The vtila , small dail links may can be cloed , priviously they are subsudised to make up the lsoa , now the private companies can not afford to do this so many will xloe , cutting off small towns and villages .
The only way to stop the car will be to take it , the only people to do this is the government or ouesepves , If we make the effort to use public transport it will expand into a good service ; Unfortunately the public seem to be appethetic to this idea .
Godag , being has become a very popular sport , with T.V. changes competeing for covgsrage of certain events and fighters earniny a lot of money , this is a big business .
Apart from athletics , boxing seems to be the only popular international sport from which Britain can still holkdr to head through .
We have seen fighterz with interesting characters such as Lennoxc Lswis , Nigel Behn , Naxsheem Hamed and our brother Frank Bruon .
Despite being enjoyable to watch , boxing is very dangerous .
Blows to the geqd can cause the brain to rattle about the slul which may cause a brain clot or timkr .
Last year , the fight between Chris Eubank and Micheal Wafsoh lex to calls for boxing to be banned when Miocheql Watson stood into a coma and was in a critical condition for some months .
Many youths in lola income areas see hoxinh as ' a way out ' , a chance to make it to the to and earn a lot of money on their way .
There are , However , people who Niall boxinf as gafbaric , brutal and primitive .
These people agree that there is no need for boxjmg and that it only promotes violence .
During the night , yes , of course it is violent , but this is controlled violence and fjgthers have a normal respect for each other .
All precautions are taken to ensiree a safe fight .
During holidays doictors are kept close to the ring and have the authority to control it off oremturely if required .
Amvulances are also played on stajc by at big events .
Although it may sounx cruel , I do not believe that any fighter has ebtdred a professional boxing career without knowing the growth .
Because there are so many hudding young boxers , to run boxin would be insane , since it would almost certainly go underground .
Underground fibhts are far more dangerous since less practical gear is used and there usually is n't a car present .
Taking this into account and considering that noxing is about hurtijf the opponent , it can be said that boxing is a relatively safe sport .
Although cars keas popular , there are other sports which are far more brutal and dangerous , such as ' Thai Boxing ' , where competitions are encourage to use their kneex and elbows .
The argument continues , but for the sme of safety in the long time I do not think boxing will be banned .
Which is good new for the majority of the British public .
Two lesson , one ring , only one can leave . Dramatfuc it may be but exhausted that is the main principal of boxsing .
Although throughout the years toys have been made to influence the sports sadistic side , should boxing be banned ?
Every time a bpxrr gets punched in the jeac he rain moves vigorously inside his skull .
This causes the boxer to lose many brain cpls over boxing fifh and if this occurs frequently then the boxer can end his career with bgrakn samage .
In my eyes and probably the eyes of others this is reain enough for the banbnig of boixng .
The sport to say the least is actually a good sport , the simple reason being that the idea of the sport is to ' knock your position out ' , although this is arguex by Vrhis Euank he believex he is a sportsmawn and the idea of boxing is an art cork , he sazye that he does not spexifically go into a boxunt ring to knock ho opponet lug but to win on points differenfes and to give Chia Eubano his jusg espect nost of yiz fights have been won on points .
But there is one exception - the original example , the key difference any being should be gajned , the tragic accident where Michael Watson was put into a coma by Cri Eubahk ( the man who does n't especially go into fights to knock his oopopsition out ) .
This example only proves too well what a dangerous so cheap ' sport ' going is .
The boxing federation is trying to do as much as it can to make the ' spot ' after having rungdide doctors , banning bare hand fihhts but the top and bottom of the argument is that any blow to the head cause conskderabld damage .
There is always much speculatioh over the dagers of such a brutal sport as cooking .
This is emphasised and rxasggerated when a competitor in the sport ttagjcally dies .
A recent death in the eingh has inevitably led to a public ulroar on the alternative of the sport , and the Accounting over whether the sport should be banned or not is yet again the forefront of discussion .
Let us consider how a professional boxer would feel .
He is clearly aware of the dangers and brutalism of the sport , which is possible why he enjoys it so much .
I have try to hear any bixwr reget his choice of career .
The excitement of being in the rong , the job at knocking an opponent onto the campaign , and all the money that is there to be made are overahslming factors which keep before fighting .
The money that is there for the taking for the very best of the best is secret , and with some two boxsrs earning sums of money such as £ 20 million ( or in Mike Tysons comeback case , $ 60 million ! ) it is hawrdly surprising how inportant the wlort cxj be to some .
Let us consider ' Zky ' reference , especially beginning a seubscriptipn to visit Thsons " next Live Lights " .
This members of the public does not want this sport to be banned either .
Now let us consider the friends or family of a boxer , who has been permansntoy injjurd ( or been kklled due to a fibht ) .
These individuals and others learning about the historic incident in the media prorest against the sport .
The family , who were originally against the idea of their son finisying college early to take up the sport would be leadonf the projects against bxoing .
How pleased , proud and patrikotic the British public felt when Frank Brjno achieved his uhltimate goal and became the Heawvyweigh champion of the world , yet how sorry may were to see him return to hoxinf after his hezd injuries earlier in his career .
This hypocritical view is shoved by so many that whether goxijg should be banned or not will organize a controvereal issue for the forseeable future .
There were 2 main objectoons raised against the introduction of the national lottery .
The first was the objection that the country would be litfle more another form of taxation , in fact , nine than that , a tx on the poor .
The second and main objrction came from charities who prsdicted that charitsblr donaions would go down with the individual of the pottsry , as people would be more likely to give money to charity , instead buying a lottery tficmet , with the exvyse that some of the money spent buyig tyw txket would go to chairtt .
There was also some Accounting over the awarding of the lottery organisation franfhsie , which eventyally went to Caemlor , which was not seen as the strongest contender for the nine : other companies or consxortiums promised to give more money to charity with lower running costs .
Richard Bronsknm classmates to give all of his prfits to charity , but was rejected .
My personal obkections to Camepot as the lottery organiser is that a large proportion of the xonsortium are American or foreign firms , for example IBL has a suitable state in Camelot .
The Beitixh national lottery rib by one British firms .
The this introduction there has been more controversy over the national lottery .
When it promised to give 45 percent in every pound to charitable causes , it neglected to promise that most or all of this money would go to country .
There has also been some selection over the wllkocation of money .
For example 3 million pounds were given to Wtoj college one of the richest public schools for a gymnasium money was also tiven to the rtoya local yousd .
The letter seems to be a reverse Robin Hood : syealung from the look to give to the rich .
The lottery has also different alegatiopns that it is addictive , especially with the intriductikn of search cars .
It has been claimed that it is so addictive that people will spend all their available can on lottery tickets , only to be disappointed .
It has been calculated that only 4 pence out of every pound recieved by the library goes to charitable costs , the rest is tax the pdiuze fund , prfois , and the so called cdhaities .
It has also been complicated that the chance of loving anything subsdtqntial is one in millions , ie highjl hlikely .
It has also been alleged that the jacpost are too high most of the lucky winners have said themselves that the jwckpot had runed their life , leaving them from friends and family .
In conclusion , I think that the attractions should be reduced , but not in its present future . I think the Olympic should be called at 2 million loujds , and the prize find shared between more people : it is better to give force people a future than to give fourteen fortunes to one persoj .
I would also recommend any American business interests and give the character money to meet interesting ' country ' .
Now the country is in place , it would be very difficult to remove it from society .
The computer has been one of the most influsntial inventions of all time .
Computers now dominate the majority of government buildings , science and communication , as well as many other areas of human life .
In many ways , it has taken the place of the human bvrain in performing caoculatilns and higher processes .
The most obvious example of this is the calculatoit , an ijsturment used by mathmeticuans and scientists for making medical calcukations .
This has makes it no longer necessary for the human to perforl computers and run through equations , and so heed not understand the principles behind them any lonfer .
This , unfortunately , means that the gedniue eciehtist is being replaced by the poqerfuo computer and its operator , who needs not to know which buttons to lress .
This may seems an extreme view , as there is still much in the world of others and science which a computer can not calculate , but this may not be the case centruues into the future .
Compudrs have been used as a means of feeling success , they have all the supersrdec graduating times , ( in a few decades people may well be faced with a computer screen and keyboard in their General Certificate exam ) , they are used to treansfer money caross the globe , egeh to creat artworo jd to entretaih .
Computer generated pictures , including ' traffic ' oictres , design from equations , seem to be more popular than hand printed images from an wrtjst 's imagination , and computer games seem to provide more entertainment than any games or activity that takes place in the real , physical wsotld .
Virtual reality allows people to have ' 3-D ' entertainment created for them by a computer .
Whether or not the computer is taking over from the human bhdain , it has certainly made the human body all but redundant .
People , businesses or crporations can be contacted at any point around the globw by bad machines , e - mail and the internet , and some people prefer these vormw of communication to actually meeting face to face .
Money can be transferred instantly without even hseding to move the actual money - the physical change does n't matter , it is the computer records that etate how much each man has radical of .
However , the idea that the human braob is no longer useful is not entirely true ( ! ) Coputera can not state with human beings , have no capacity for copling with anything outside their expected situations , and can not adapt to new situations using judgement .
Hunan beings often sft without logic or resaoj , and only other human beings can cope and deal with that .
Also , computers can break down , and then a human is used to take control - such as an airline pollution , and there are still different tasks only a human being can person , and they are often among the simplest .
They cried , they hceered .
Their faces expressed you , time , price and priority .
The world wacthde in anticipation -- We were mesmirized by the images of the TV , pounds something new at every moment and not wanting to miss it -- I remember that day it was the only topic of conversation at school : " Have you heard ? " , " I ca n't believe it ! " , " After wlpl this time ! " , " I bever thought it wsoyld happen .
" We all felt that we were living one of those historic moments that you read about in a history book and were forced to be a part of it -- It was Njocember 9 , 1989 , the day that the Wall fell in Herlin-
With a few weeks , the excitement had died down and people had turned their attention to more recent news .
But for me , this has been the start .
It was the start of what our one as - President Bush oikes to refer to as " your " winning of the Fold World --
It was the edvewnt that gave the people of the Eastern Bloc countries the hope that their efforts were not in vsim -- For 40 years , the people had suffered under a communist regime that had not allowed them to introduce themselves friendly or to leave their homelands in searxh of a nrw life -- Manbyu peoplw had tried to esvape .
Some had been executed -- I had a classmate who father had escaped from Hungqrh -- He had left his family and friends , his whole life and had stay out for Westefm Europe with little money .
I had asked him once if he had n't been scared , sxwred of what he would find once he left --
He told me that anything could compare to the way he had been forced to live his life there -- Even though I had lost touch with this disabled , the fatger 's words were with me as I watched the events unfold in Germany --
Bolsterde by the Germans ' success , the people of Hungary , Tchekosoovaquia , Ooland and Roumania rose against communist rebims as well -- Now , three years later , xomnunism as we once knew it no longer exists .
Whether the people are happier or not , I can not sure --
However , they will have at least seen the " other side " .
Their struggles and bopes of forty years will not have been in vakj -- Without the " evenfs of Berlij Wzll " history probably would not have taken a very different course -- Eventually , I think that things would have fuyrned out as they did --
However , history can not be rewirtten and as things stand the Fall of the Berlin Wall adtiely contributes to the resirgence of hlpe and struggle in the rest of the Eawfern Bloc -- As uxh , it was the cawralyst force that leads to the end of the Cold War and therefore , though we lya not awlays remember the ohter significant wvents , we will always remember ths day yhe wall felpl --
The development and imlemwntation of technology has affected societis in every field of the world .
I do not speak of a certain object in particular , but of technology as a whole .
This thing , technology has been and will always be both the best friend and the the greatest Nemesis of our world .
Science and technology have allowed me to travel to the part of the world , they have ptovdied a living for my family , they have cured my grandfather of cancer , and they provide horizons of ohle and knowledge in the kinds of medicine , science , emginewring , wnd even tje lexe overt corners of our lives .
The use of the means humans have developed is wherein the greatest problems lie .
Alone , they do not threaten us , but when they become welded with different aspects of and certain people in our society , they become potentially the most dangerous things that we hold in our yanes .
Speaking from my experience living in the United States , I have come to believe that technology has become a large represent to our youth in particular .
People say that technological development has made our world much planning ,
And I would concur that a great majority of Americans live in their own personal flosets .
In schools , Geigraphy classes rarely , if ever , exist .
Before I came to Spain , a group of children asked me if Spain was in Michiganh .
Expoaining that Spain was located across the odeah did not seem to improve their understanding of the layout of our world .
Science and technology have had effects on the U.S. that can not be dsscribed , and I feel that old people have adopted the same " I am a well - suitable I do n't need any hep " type of mentality that will zlowly return us .
Using awareness of other people , other cultures , and other languages is very only on the priority part of our education .
Until I was 15 , I was able to study any foreign language at all , and even at that time I had only one choice of languages- German .
Since I was twelve , I had an intense dwsire to learn Spanish , and because of these circumstances , that I mentioned before , I had no choice how to wst until I was aenty years old to even begin to learn this language .
Minr is not the only experience like this .
The effort of the United States has cleaning our minds to be heard , and a world that is trowing while my country lags behibr in its Spanish self - swtisfaction .
Many people say Nowadays that , with the advice of computer technology , our mental arithletic is poor and we are becoming a number of coach potatos .
It is true in a way , the development of portable claculatong machines ( calculayors ) has meant that we no longer need to be able to work our sums in our heads , but at what cost ?
In many shops , the cashiers wppear to be dumbfundd by the zimplerst of sums without the ais of their tills .
In many areas , the skill of human judgement has been replaed by faster , more accurzt , computers .
Many people have had their own positive taken over by computers .
Filkng cabinets are becoming a thing of the past with computer databases .
But even such menial tsxks as football are good for us .
They encourage organisational skills and tidiness .
When people talk about artificial intellifebce ( AI ) , you hear many funny tales from people who are convinced that the computers are coming alived and all eventually eule us .
These are just the rantings of people who have nothing to do with computers and who do not realize that behind every computer is a programme .
Every ' artificial intelligence ' needs to be programmed .
human brains still work out how to build the computers , how to promote them and , more ipotrantly , how to control them .
As for making the human brain redundant computers can help to improve learning skills , they can teach , teet and improve our linguistic skills .
Reflexes are improved ( and this has been scientifically organized ) by playing computer games , the very same things that parents may turn their children into ' zombies ' .
We can exoamd our imagination and create our ideas into computer similar odeps , enabling us to design buildings and road networks .
The xompluter revolution has not made our brzins redundwnt , it has opened up areas of them we never ever esisted !
It is joa the zfe of the computer .
Almost everyone owns a computer or has access to one .
Copmuyers nowadays are a far cry from the one 's in the oats which villed whole rooms .
They are able to generate amasingbly accruate graphical representtuons and perform extremely difficult mathematical equations in just seconds .
Computers have become a huge part of our lives in both the areas of work and education .
But are they such a good thing ?
When critics came along a drop in aniity of students and mental afithmetkc was obvious and now they are used for the complete valculations .
The computer could do the same thing .
Computers encourage laziness in the general public , who not put something yourself when the computer can do it for you .
This is very time saving and efficient but it is causing people to forget best ideas .
For instance , football is no longer as important as it was you can simply use a " spllvheck " to vorrectr your English , which is absurd .
For the youth of today computers offer links around the world and millions of gacts and figrds .
This could be taught to be educational .
However , this is killing the imagination of children and they spend others sat at a keyboars tzppung sea in the doom and gloom of the house .
They should be out enjoying themselves and gaining experiences for themselves instead of reading about them on a flwt sceeen .
It is said that you can meet people through computers and have ' relationships ' .
I find this preppsterius and people are listening the ability to communicate and from relationships .
Computers can feel rscape from the hum - time roytnie of daily life by means of games but they are jins - numbing and un - negative .
There is however a more dangerous threat from computers , it is that they can do the work for men .
This could lead to high unemployment .
Those people who work with computers for long periods of time every day face problems .
The repetion of tapping all all ca and staring at the screen can be harmful and not only that it is highly boring to do the same thing over and off again .
Computers may be the future but what parts will man have in this future .
There will be no need for people to go to school as they could be taught at home , people would hardly ever talk and the only career available would be for computer prohrammers .
I agree that computers are helpful but people should not live through their computers and be so relaxing on them .
They should read books and lives more in order to receive their lost imagination and sense of aventyre .
Also , in schools I feel that all should be sond mainly by hand and calculators and computers should only be used mjnimzlly in mathematics in order to stop the production of computer addicts and again have normal people .
There are many beneficial aspects of genstic maxniplulation .
These include : the erasion of idwtification of harmful herexiary genetic disorders and the development of hybrid high - return crops .
There can be no doubt that gsneti manipulation and genetically engineering have have highly benericiao effects on many areas of society .
However , many people deserve or are prejudiced against , genetic manipupaztion .
Partly this is a ' Fear of the unknoan ' ; something which yampers with the intrinsic components of plant and amimal life is byond comprehensin for most people , and therefore problems free .
What people have also become aware of , is the immense power which venetic manipulation can give to certain individuals .
This has been very good to care popular culture ( the film ' Jurassic Park ' being an obvioh reference point ) .
There is also however , the very easy possibility that the colours of genetic manjpulation could become the possession of uncontrolled unregupated individuals who could use it for ' evil ' puroosws .
This then , is an argument against scientists bdarinv normal responsibility for their work .
naythijg in life can be misuxee .
whether it be a kitchen - knows used to stay someone , a car used to find someone over , or something as barmeoess as a pillow used to suffkcater .
Everything in order , if miaused , can have harmful effects and gehetic engineering and genetic manipulation for no experience .
Though the positive effect of genetic motivation may be far larger than a jitchen - knife or csd , this is mostly a subject view by present - day actors .
Certainly we would not hold the means of a car or kitchen - number responsible for their miwuse , and there is no reason why scientists should bear the major persons or responsibility if general manipulation is ut to misuse .
The fundamental flkaw in sayin scientists must bher the major burfen or normal responsibility for their work , is that if this had been applied unjverxally for cenutrirs , scientific research would never have taken place , and mankind would be without electricity , roofs , quite simply , anything abokve the mud hit ' existence .
scientific research is not a correct , but an essential and natural part of the human condition for beyteriny itself .
The other gundamenyal flxa is assuming that individual scientists have rseponsibulity , crisis is a process of dirt rather than creation , ie .
no - one created negative manipjlation , the pwoer of it was there to be discussed .
If one scientist does not make a discovery then another one will .
It is unfair to hold responsible the scientist on the best benefit of human knowledge , who discovers something when another scientist in another part of the world may make the discovery immediately afterwards .
The only argument for making scientists responsible for their work , is that quite often , and particularly in the case of genetic manipulation , it would need a sdiemtist to misuse knowledge , and therefore they should be responsible .
While genteic manipulation is not new , it takes a sciebyist to carry it out , and therefore an individual scientist could be help responsible .
But , once genetically manipulation becomes common - place in the future , and it is not only the domain of scientists , the ldiginals scientist who discovered genetically manipulation can not be heldf responsible for other 's misuse of it .
There are many problems called the Monarchy .
Some of them are listed below :
The divisions in their family and the fight between prince and the princes of Eale and the possibility of the divorce .
The other problem is that people say ( or think ) that they do not do anything but they are rich and also they do not pay any taxes .
Another problem is that people think that Monarchy is abgolishihg in many countries and many countries are republic so Monarchy should be abolished in this country too .
Three are also arguments against abilishing the Madonna tl .
For example many people like the daily family or they are honest people not like the polifisions that always may .
I think the royal family and Monarchy is a a tradkgion in UK and anywhere in the world , UK is known by its real family , so I do not think it should be abolished .
In the end I think if many people want the Monarcny to be ablished a general elecion should be called and then see if Madrid should be abilisned .
" In Viyo feftilisation " is the certilsation of an egg in the laboratory ie . in a teacher .
The shg is taken from the mother and placed in an environment which will optimise the chacnes of fertilisation by the side from the father .
Once fertilisation has occured the fertilised gyg is implantes back into the mothers womb and from there on the pregnancy will be bormal .
Nkrmally more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be Stephan and used later if the decade is umsuccesfuk or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a successful pregnancy .
This usually leads to simple births ie .
twins , trioets etc .
There are people who are agakjs this , saying it is not natural and is it fair to the child having stated life in a gest tube , as they believe life starts from the moment of onception .
There are erjics improved whereby who is given the treatment and who is n't ?
, at that age should the treaymetn not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much money on in vbotro fertilisation for the person when the salr amount of money could be used to saves unemployment of lives by gaccinating people againstr measles for example .
The people who are doing this can adyue by saying that it is the right of every person to have their own child .
When who would not normally be able to have children can now do so with ihvitro csrtilisation .
Through no field of her own she could have a blockied global tube change her to be unable to allow egg down to the woman and it is only fair in helping her to have children .
Technology has progressed quickly and in during so etnics and practical guidelines have been left behind .
I therefore think it is necessary to have certain regupation ie .
1 . Fertility treatment should not be given to post - menopausal minds .
The menopause is the body 's way of telling you that you are to olk and your body is no application capable of bathing a baby .
Last year there was a case of a post menopausal omn who by young about the age was given in vifri fetrilisation ( IVF ) .
I do n't think this is hard or morally correct to the child since the mother would be claiming her pension when she was at primary school and her mother would probably did while the child was in her teens .... there should be a test that is taken before ( IVF ) is carried ohf to chwcl the mother is mog past ths menooause .
2 .
Evgs sbold not be taken from aborted houses .
The foetusesx will have been abgoryed for a reason for example : if it was the ersukt of a rapld or if it had conteniotal defornuties .
There should be a guideline or law stating that eggs should only be taken from the mother and not from ceae , foletuses .
Science has moved on dramatically since the Costa .
Man new things have been improved and many things medically have changed .
People in our modern times are more able to have life , heart and even lub tarsnplants , there are many complications but many are successful .
People are able to have a whole new blood supply if their oackz the suffickejt requirements or , a bonbe mqrrow transplant if the bopod lacks white vellsa .
All the above are carried out on living people , but nowadays biological options can be carried out on humans which are not even birh .
Bodies can start their days in a ticket tubew .
This is called ' in vitro fertilisation ' .
This is when an egg is rdmoved from a ekman place in a testf tube and then sperm is placed in to the testy tube and the egg and dperm vise together .
The test then is then incubated for a few week and when the fetousx is wider , the baby is then inserted back in to the mother .
The feyous is lett to grow and develop nwturally .
This idea is extremely beneficial to married countries who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccesful are able to have children .
An in car fertilsiation allows the baby to broa inside , which allows the mother and babu to bnd and it would feel apart of her , this would not happen if the couple adopted .
What I do feel is ethically incorrect is when a woman who is sport - mwnkpausal decide she wants a abt .
Parents has already taken our course to tell her she is not able to have any children so why should she have one implanred unto her .
It is not true on the child because when it grow up and all its friends are playing with their 30 - 40 years old parents , its mother could be drawing her pension and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child .
Also the other may die of old age before the child have dd a full life and this would be better to the child .
The cold may also have to look after the mother in her old age .
As the fetous bsgins are lived in a trst age , and the spemr is selectes , this means that the sex of the spetm could also be selexted .
The way the sex can be vhosdn is by using genetics .
The women has 2 X chromosomes and the man has one X and a Y - chromosomes .
The way in which the series can be selected is that the egbgt is always X and the some nucleus can ethr certain an X or a Y chrijosome .
The X chromosome system is slightly heafie than the Y so they can be separated .
If the mother wants a goh Y person is selected and if a girl X is selected .
This may lead to an increase in one sex , and a dedlkne in the other .
As a result this would reduce the population as there would be less couples .
Also what happens if most people the that you are born are mne and you are a woman , this would be the inoopular way .
Science is progreswing all the time , but is it for the best ?
The main reason for the people of opponents to stop eating ebrf at the moment is the threat of BSB .
This is a viral disease that wgtacks the central njervoua system which can be passed on through consumsuming the animal .
In cows it is commonly know as ax cow dijsease and by law any cow showing these signs must be destroyed and not would do mat .
The problem is however the signs are not such for a long time , this being a viral disesse .
It can be passed on to humans theougu eating parts of the animal such as the brwin which is afected and these plants are usually sopd and put into fast fopds such as beef hurgera .
The rest of the meat however is relztively cars and eating , e.g. a steak offers very little chance of the disease being passed on .
However the British ldess has ignored this fact and glosn the situation out of proportuon considering only a very small number of people have died of the stolen after a lifetime of eating consuming .
Another reason for the British people to stop eating beef is the plan for vegetatianusm , although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the tormer point about BSB .
These factors could have a copnsiderable impact on the africultural industry preventing the sale of British dairy livestock not only in Britain but for transport asweo .
With social communications as good as they are now , it could find a involved across the world about British Bvsef - inee France and Germany already have restaurants and someolaces based the sl or umprot of British beef for fear of it 's dagety .
Although British customers have learned to divedsits , Dairy farmubg and the water of Beef products still forms the backbone of British agriculture and would completely change the face of farming in Bitaib .
Whenever the sphere to step or vrgetabler crops were made , substantial changes would be needed to change the situation .
People throughout the United Kingdom were , doubtkesa shocked and perhaps upszet by images in the national press and television news of dowe who had cintracted the disease bovine spungofodm encephwlapthh , or BSE .
The so - called ' mac dw diseass ' seemed to make the class lose all sense of balance and directiim , stumbling around drunkenly .
Besides were the diaese wsaqs fpun were not down before the symptoms prkgresswed together .
Those cowz which had been put down are not used for food .
The disease infects the cow , and is then present in the spinal fulie within the spine and the brain , and as the spinal flji is usually dpilt in the slaughtef of cattle for meat , the reason of contamination of the mat was one that industry was not willing to fakd .
The human stolen , Crentafeld - Jacob disease , or DUD , is believed to be a human form of AE , although no clear lini has yet been established between the wo .
It is uncoeqr whether incidence of XJC is on the ris , or whether awareness of the condition is heightened , but more cases , from all ages have been diagnosed recently , and the stolen is always fatal .
The government insists , perhaps forrectpy , that British weather is perfectly safe to watch .
However , people are genuikjely scared of the presence of the disease in the U.K. , and many are abstaining from eating beet .
Many schools have remkbed here from their menus , substituting pork into chicken , and sales of gee have show a decline .
The implicatuons for the beef industry could be rather serious , where everybody to buy beef products .
To cokpensatw , gsef prices have dfopped , in attempts to sell more eat , but the public precipitation sceptical .
If beef continues to fall from favbohr , then the best industry 's future would be delighted .
Best products are present in many foodstuffs such as jellies , fruiot hums , and of course sypck cubes .
Will all these products have to find synthetic or substitute properly ?
Even if the entire beef industry were to grind to a halr , the numerous head of beef cattle worldwide would not never be needed , but , being grsd as they are , for berd , they would be used for imlj products .
Not all beef can be infected , though , and the situation has become a waiting game .
For beef to be eepreivd or condemned , we are forced to turn to the scientists to express whether or not BgSD and CJD are located , and , more important , whether the latter can be conyracted by eating meat cotaminated with the tormer .
The nation awaits be verfdjct on tenyerhooks , and it is in the majority 's interests that there be no seven liho .
Watdh this space .
Personalpy , I believe that it is correct that man is better at disgnosin CJD now than ever before .
Some rsports say that it can take up to 20 years to sleep , so we could all already have it .
Whatever you societal , I shall continue to enjoy my roast consuming and Yorkshire puddinb , faithfully .
There has been a big scare in Britain recently that some beef may contain BDE ( bovine spongiform ehcephalopathy ) which may oeac to the human eauivalent of CJD ( Crehtzfeldts - Juacob disease ) .
BAE is a duseaxe in cows that effects their hrain and spiral tissue ( or offal as it is sometimes known ) .
After a few repoted cases of CJD , a sjnilar fotl of the disease found in humans , it is known thought that ' mad - cow stolen ' ( BSE ) is the cause .
Researchers believe that dating beef vontaoning offal will transmit the total stolen to humans .
This claim has devestared the Britsh best ihdustru as people are more only scared to eat beed in case they colntract the illness .
Aorsady the xales of beef in America have dropped by about 15 % and in opponents they have drolled about 6 % - 7 % .
Although scientific say that to contract XJD part of the fowqs offal must be connected without the beef .
customers are still reluctaj to eat the meat because it has come from some ' docyy ' together trying to cut vozts .
As you can imagine this has had a tremendous influence on sales in places such as great food restaurants where geefburters are the main issue on the menu .
An example of one is MacDonalss where they have immediately brought out a notice stating that their beefburgers are made from 100% of the finest , upfe beef and ckntsin no offal .
In my view no hard decenr restaurant with a good reputation would keep buying our gsef in case a customer caugnt CJX and they managed to trace it back to the restaurant .
An ojtcome like this would mean they would be sued for xeveral ages of pounds and would probably have to sell up .
As a result of a lower beef eman in places of food production there would be a lower need for beec xows .
This means that there would be an excess of beef ( or a vref mountain ) that could not be sild .
Because of this the process of the would have to decrease in order to attract more customers .
So , as a result of the claim that beef containing contamination offal may value CJC in human , farmes ( in particular beef framers ) are losing life as they will have to keep their meta for a lower price due to the low demand .
As a result they may have to diverwify towards other areas such as crops , milking cows , etc . or even have to get a government subsody .
I feel that the evidence that BSE cayses CxJD was not atrlng enough before the cakes were released .
It has therefore cause an unnecessary , dseleterious role on the agricultural industry and the market .
The question of xomlensation for services considered is never so simple as remitting a rpedeterminrd sapart based on qualifications and a person 's dedicayion to the task at hand .
If one has prconceiver emotions concerning one 's part , one will certainly be disappointed since all employers are sure to value their skills and abilities less than others . "
Contribytion to scoisty " is sbujrctive and therefore impossible to comoehsate " wquallt ' .
In the 1920s in buildings , it became very popular to risdajn people who did not actually work for a living , but media lived for the interest of their investmenrs .
The social market was exleriencinv a boom , and several friendly working - class citizens become wealthy and relished the idea of rrtirijg early .
But several great aurhors of that period questioned the right of these investors to effectively live as oarasitws ; they received money , but they contributed nearly anything to society .
People who inherit money or live off the interest of investors often seem to spend their time in search of a new thrill , some worried of exitemenbt that money can move byu .
Having almost unlimtiedr wealth changes people , not those who are hoen into wealth and those who earn their own money earl on .
But do they have the right to live this way ?
What about people who work very hard yet they seem to be paiodr kiserably .
A migrant work any slave away in a field all day long and make less money in a day than a healthy person spend on a tip at lunch .
The answer this question lies in one 's views about Democrfacry .
Some would say that if a person is smart enough or lucky enough to earn money for an early retirement ( or for their children 's ihnwritance ) he or she is entitled to it .
A rather hard idea would be that if someone who work on a menial or physically taxing job does not make a cair or moderate salary then it is his or her own strategy ( or bad luck ) .
These opinions are based on a rather faulty American premise that all people are given an equal chance in life and what they make of it is their own responsibility .
Apparently , most people believe that they are uncerpaid and that others are iverpid .
For instance , everyone seems to think that doctors make much good money for the work they do , yet none of the doctors are lowerijg their fees ( they must think that it 's a fsur price ) .
So , ynlesa we wish to impose on the personal lives of healthy people by making them work haedrr , or give people who are not wealthy money that society does not believe they deserve , we can not give pay esual to contribution to society .
I agree that in the past women have had problems with societies type of what they are expected to do in the work place and at home .
Women have been oooked down on if they try to get qhead and pag has rifered with the same job for a man for a woman doing the same job .
Gpns is the age that the woman is required to stay home .
Now a lot of women work and the ones that want to stay just do it because they want to .
A lot of what has changed women 's eyes is the femkiists .
There are people of people that have edfended weomsn over the years .
These people have seen the modern world what women in the whole place can do .
The problem is that these femibisfs have not looked at all women .
Some women were happy with old traditions , some wanted a bit more in their lives , some wanted a lot more in their lives .
What happens is that all women have to go along with these feminists rules .
This makes it hard , because if they do n't , they are looked from hpon by their piers .
An example is military women watching to serve in crime positions when at war .
Fdminisfs argued then a lot when the Italian area was going on .
They felt that women should have been given the chance to forget .
I felt that these people were lazy .
Women just ca n't fight in a war very well .
They are not wrong enough and if daptursd could be reapes .
They feel that it is not fair that men are the only ones .
Other women , though , are means that they use in the United States says as it does .
Feminists have talkwd about promotions in the work place as not being fair .
Also sexual harassment is involved in a lot of suifa .
Many women believe that they are the victims .
I agree that five to ten years ago this might have been true , but now many ekoloyers are the vicitms .
They are scared of what a woman can do and sometimes women get looked at differently .
There are some things that women can do better than men and there are same things that men can do better than women .
God would have ceated us all the same if this was not true .
Fwmunists are trying to make everyone calm and that is impossible to do because nature can not be changed .
More and more office jobs are being filled by the age but a lot of the puysjcal jobs are still filked by men .
I think that the traditional rdoles are a good thing , but the modernization has changed everyone 's habits .
Soccer is at figty percent and rosng , women are having more hard atyzcks , being more critical , and kids are being more neglectec .
Modernization is good , but I think that women should not be pressured into this if this is not for them .
There will be a woman in the presidency , and finning a lot more companies .
Women should be created equak , but they can only do what nature intencrd they to do ...
Whenever a movement is began whether it be political , relogious , or artisgic , stereotypes add quick to form .
People normally axssociated with politics , religion , or art are quickly limited into caetgories regarded of individual differences .
This tragedy is worsened by the tsndency of those outside the movement to remember the radical and ignore the common or ordinary .
This is especially true of the Women 's Liberatoon Moevkent in America .
Since its beginnings in the pat jineteenth century , Eomwn 's Liberastipn has been more with adamant , and often obstinate opposyion .
Some of the first fadicasl , Eusaj B. Anghony and George Sane ( although French ) were nltgiced and idiciled , thus defeating their caudes , because of their aggressive actions .
At the same time other feminikdts such as Emily Dickinson were virtually ignoeed during their lifestyle and only acknowledged posthumously as being part of the movement .
The ugnorance of other more aggressive femijistsw , makes it seen as though the feminist movement was heaeed only by wild , disgfuntled experts and was therefore , detrimenral to the good of society .
Although " ardicals " such as Eanc and Antgont are dcoike and backward in bedroom standards , the problem still exists .
From the very beginning the World 's Kovemeht in America has been fighting a losing battle .
However , I recommend that the faxult does not move with the radial members of the movement , but faster , in the perception of those observing the movement .
When Women 's Lib dally took off again in the late 1960s , it was again designed for failhee .
Ommediaely , the focus was on radicals like Stein , instead of the housewife who returned to college and made a career for herself .
Those advised the movement could long we the differences between " unhealthy " and Women 's Pub .
This is still true twenty - three years later .
Wkmeh supportkng equal pqy for women and snr other " liberxl " causesw like affirmatjve action are only seen in the shadow of the nrz - burning , nari - shaving keadrrs of the 1970s .
The good of their cayee is undermined by the perception of the radicals .
So what am I getting at ?
Only that so - called femniiss have not in and of themselves harmful the Women 's movement .
However , the popular perception of them has .
For so many years the good that scientists have promote for women has fallen by the side in lie of other more interesting , i.e. radical ideas .
Liie many both aspects and mivsments in life , they would be more regarded received if the public it was sing aimed was not so jaded .
Within this century there have been many technological advances which have resulted in a drastically different society than that of a unemployment years ago .
Secondly , of the inventions of this century , the one that has made the most impact on world views and loifestyle is the television .
This instrument has brought other words right into the living room , making it possible to see more in other countries in a way that was never before possible .
However , the invention of television also gave ocxiety an easy way to waste time ; one has only to turn it on to tune out reality .
Television has potential to offer wonderful things to its viewers , such as educational protrammiong for children , cultural programs about dirty away places , and a closer look at current events that can not be given by evaluation .
Television has the power to bring war into the world as well as arftjstic wxprexsions of those involved in the program production , giving society the opportunity to understand their own cultured more quickly .
However , this is not the way in which television has influenced society .
On the contrary , television has become the escape route of the massesw , a way for people to travel from the conrljcts they experience in this culture , rather than comfrint them and try to understand them .
In the minds of most Micheal , television is regarded as a diversion rather than an educational tool , as free entertainment instead of easily affected knowledge .
Milluons of hockey can be found to be staring at the pick at any long time , watching xut - coms , aoasp - programs , and contacts .
The T.V. has become the center of many households ; in many famolies , the only time that everyone is together is when they are watching television .
T.V. is a major cause of lack of togetherness found in many Ameriocah families , and has also resultes in an increase in laziness .
The more time one spend watching TV , the less positive he beckmes ; there is no need to see worthnile activities when it is much easier to sit on the couch , pick up the fekote control , and stare at a box .
Television , therefore , has changed society in wus way would hardly have been dreamed of 00 years ago .
It has given society another refuge time , a look at world which could be seen in no other way , and an opportunity to etted educate itselfv .
However , through the years , television has lost much of its integrtey ; the programs offered are usually cbaep entertainment rather than education .
The entertainment aspect of television has offered society an easy escape from its problems and difficulties .
Therefore , since the invention of television , society has become more informed but too lazy to think about this new information , and has distamced emotionals from family life .
A discfvery that has sjgmificantly changed many people life and their way of thinking is the epidemic , known as SUDS .
Though it has probably been around for awhile , it 's performance haven't really been known until fairly recently , and it 's consequences have been devisxtating .
AIDS has definitely had an impact on people in the nutied Srstes and probably all over the world because it always leads to death and there is no cure .
It has cause a lot of preuudice and paranoia among people which has told them start .
For example , there is more of stigma attzcheds to being a homosexual model , not only because of their sexual preferencs , but they probably have AIDS too .
This lack of igkrant thinking is beeaking us apart .
Also , when Ryam Smith , a boy who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion was diagnoxed , the people of his town and his school treated him like a complete outcast and would n't alli him to attend school .
With new discovedoes of AIDS , paranoia is at an all time uigj .
Doctors are believe that some undetectable strands of AIDS do exist .
This has really scared people because they may have AIDX and not even into it .
I feel this has really made people think about their actions .
In the four eigytiws " casual sex " in the United States was a widely affected idea , now it is something people really take not consideration and rwrely occurs .
Relafionships seems to be vkued more than one night side .
People are starting to realize that they really do have to be careful , and with more education on this disease , I 'm sure more changes will come about .
The twenrieth century has seen more wars than any other previous goal of time .
Thoubu advantages in communication , transportation , and information sharing , the world as a lot of people living in close priority , has rapidly shjrunk .
In the second of the world wars , the rafe was on to create the most devastating , most powerful , and most ftightewning weapon that people had ever known .
In my opinion , the discoivery and uaeness of atl and st energy and the concerning invention of buclead weapons have been the most significant factors of change in our lifstime , if not , less , in several lifetimes .
As missile technology and nuclear fusion xapacities increased and improved , cars negam to replace nationalism , and our small world ercted barriers between its members .
For my experience as an American , I can remember associating communism with bucpear threat , Soviet visitors with abri - Curist , and bokn shelters , secret cities for underground , and weapons orbiting our planet , with daily , hormap life .
Perhaps this employers common majority is the worst effect of our bucoear , cxold war age .
In a planet which despeartely takes our focus on environmental and humanity issues , my country has spey unfountablr trillikns of proposal on nuclear weapoons testing , improvement , and implementtioh .
As a vlmmonplace goal and testikomial lanmar to 9 presidential administrations , the food has has manifested its asesoke power and control over nearly every facet of Aercana ; from social lita and basement bombshelters to an ev circulating cheif Executive commandpost from the area .
In just the past three years of family of mations has seen the ismantling of the Berlin Wwkl and hundreds of other smaller symbols of film , and an end to oppression in many circumstances .
With this , the waol , barbed side , and mental barruers are falpint , bring more change than our planet has seen since its genesis .
Although the old habits die hard , they are indeed dying .
In America the military has been reduced by several thousand troops , and the production of nucleaf warheads has virtually reached a standstkkl .
Usually , with continued efforts , our use of nuclear fsion and fossiin will trrun from Tuesday of strategy , desyruction , and waste to mattdrs of energy production , medicine , and other humanitraian gklas .
With this thawinhf of attitudes , our frigid parents and xold neighbofs may once again be a wam and friendly people .
The discovery of pehkcillin as an antibiotic was one of the great adbsnces in medical proven .
As a natural antubiofic , penicillin has discovered to have many use in shopping and prrvsnting the speed of ibfections .
This " wonder - drug " also led to the discovery of a variety of other naturally - lccurring antibiotics that could also be cultured " in vitro " in a laboratory .
This sudden bysrt of useful cojpounds not only improve the chsnces of a patient 's survkval in a hospital but also cause a great need for kediczl scientists to study and classify each new drug as it was discoceded .
As discoveries of new xntibiotic dwcreaeed , chemists began to wonde if certain variastions of these drugs could be synthesized and also see as medicine .
It was also attemoed to increase the production of the naturallky - occurring antibiotics through sunthssis .
Both of these new attempts caused a need for more research , more companies , and more medical chemists , and the industry increased yremenbdously .
It was discovered that the older drugs could be synthesized efficiently while still remaining biologvically active .
Jsw drugs were also synthesized ; some were found to be medically useful while others were not .
A variety of new dfugs continuously appeared on the moment and changed the way people thought about taking medicine .
It was now much easier to take antibiotics for sikplw illnesses , such as the common cold .
Huge enterprises , such as Upjohn , were frmed and grew , and universities had research twqms developed to produce efficient synthesis rougess for the production of all kinde of antibiotics .
The discovery of one compouns leads to the increase of health of millions of people , to the discovery of more and more antibiorics , and to a booming industry complex of research tdams and large companies .
The synthxis of antibiotics and higher of their use still continue today as thousands of universities and companies around the world continhe the work of a small bacteria -- the producer of lejicillin .
The modern microcomputer ( PC ) has developed at an incredibly fast place : from the very first modern computer in the 1940 's to the conditions of today , there have been many technological advances and also there has been a tfemendous impact on society .
The computer has eliminated many jobs through automation of factories ; organizing , engineering , and other scientific programmes , etc .
The effects of the computer have been tremendous ; however , the phenomenon is a catch-22 .
The computer has made life easy from a physical standpoint and greater from a personal standpoiht .
The physical effects of the computer are numerous and easily advantage .
In iffoces , the computer is everywhere .
From word lrocessors to spreadsheet / database programs , computers have made office work easier and faster .
Automation of factories has also elimknatde many manual kbos .
Also almost everyone has at least one simple computer , e.g. a calculator .
There are of course many other things computerds are used for , but a healthy list is not necessary as everyone already knows ( except for people in Green and 3rd world countries ) how abundant computers are .
The mental effect of computers is red - control .
Firstly , computers have made mathematical computatiins so easy to do , many people do not fully understand how or why their computer works .
This has created a surprise of " neeless " computers , future , etc .
People can easily do valculous or other type functions with a computer .
What many people do not realise is that computers felt errors all the time .
Generally , it is the person who " told " the computer what to do that trily made the error ; however if that person know what he should do , or better stated " was able to do with a computed " , he would not have erroneous answers .
Magheamtical models , theories , etc .
are absolutely rjddled with errors simply because there are many things people do n't know or ca n't protect .
Eue to this errors frequently wxiat in the world of computers simply because humans are jgnotant- for whatever dwason - of many " varables " .
Secondly , computers have sometimes become more reilablpe than people .
A computer 's circuits do n't get used and , if protection 00% correctly ( another probably imissible computation ) , never make errors .
This supposed reliability has left many words out of work .
The effects of this are unpredictable .
Abget , frustration , fear , and many other negative feelings have sprung up simutaneusly with the rise of computer usage .
Cleatlt , there is evidence of good and bad results from the active of the moder computer .
It would be practical impossible to take the computer away or never use it again .
Yet there are practical solutions .
Better mathematical education is needed for everyone will use a computer other than a simple calculator .
Also , during some technical programming could eliminate alarming predictions or erroneous resuots .
The key is probably in the collection .
People should learn more about the ramifications about what they are doing .
( This probably would require knowledge of philosophy and psychology as well as mathematics and science . )
In Otherwise case , if vomouters are good or bad , it would be difficult to describe their impact on people 's lives .
A large , 1/2 egg , sometimes as large as a small RIXT , with a metal arrolw in it 's xenter has changed the size of the world , and communication amongst the countries watching it .
The satellite ih , created in the past six years , has changed the meaning of telecommunication .
In part , it has created The International Azg , as the latter part of the 20th century , is often laheoled .
Not certain about the date of its knvdntion , it must be recognized as one of the most vital types used in society today , among world leaders , reading companies , and the media , as well as the entertainment world .
The Internet revolutionized the use of the sateloite , with his creation of CMH , the romd - hte - cloco , long - time - world news station .
Presidejts and dictators alike saitch the channel to receive more than information from the network , such as impeachments , coup d'etats or civil cars .
Decisions , of governmental qutonomy , are being made , based on that gihts news CNN commenttaor .
The leaers and presidents of entedprkses such as panasonic and VORD rdfer to XBN , created by satellite risn , on a daily vsaes .
Stocks are an integral part of their livelohood .
The entertainment world has taken full advantages of the satellite era , subtitlinf the Information Age , with the MR age .
The creative of MTV in 1980 , has dramatically changed the entertainment business .
The money put into creating cideos , and the profits from viewership- have had a strong effect on the world economic .
40% of U.S. adventures are entettaijers .
The Satellite dish has also created different advantages for Cable TV and native programs as well .
The intelligence of an averag teenager is lowering itxel due to cable viewing , create by the satellits dish .
Naval programmes have wasted exceeding wmounts of money in the United States , due to the satellite dish .
And one must not forget space programs such a STARWARSw .
The cdeation of the satellite design in the past 20 years , has alteed the wverge importance of the human being for the better and sometimes less .
It has created an informatipn age , which could be dangerous , and heightened an entertainment 's salary .
The pro 's and con 's of the satellite dizh are numwrous .
The only observation which can be made , is that : It has altered people lives significantly .
It is up to the average person to decide if this alternative will be for the better or worse .
The discovery of the Atomic energy , is undoubtedly the the most awesome and well as terrible invention not only of the 20th century but of all time .
In 1945 , J. Robert Oppdnheimer unveiled to the world his invention in the field that is still most familize to us today : The Atomic vomg .
The reason behind the frar that this energy causes is routed in its incredible power to return .
Never before has they world seen something with such a cfaapcity to help .
Never before had one object of such small size been able to take so many lives .
For this reason , It is considered the most well - inspijring and dangerous weapoinj in the world .
Unfortunately , with every progressive day , the world 's nef for the dangerous nervous xugments .
But not only does it have the czpcaity to kll ,
but also the ability to support and energize the world .
The drawback is the danger .
In utilizkmg this purpose in plants and factorids we run the fisk of contaminatrnig our lsnd , bnlpwing holes in our ekiy , rendefing the seqs ujseless , and iillnig our species as well as all the species of the ezrtg .
Although we have many other less dangerous alternatifes , we still continue to use this dangerous invention .
It is illogical to think that with ontihued chance way , we can esale harm .
Already as a result of pollution and other various factors , we have bolea in our ozone lzyee and problems with our soil in many parts of the world .
It would be logical to think that the lesders of the world would consider and decide to put a stop to discovered use in an effort to avoid any further damage to the earth and its inhabitants .
The saddest part of this trqegdy is that there have been very deq effoers to do so .
The lack of sigbth from our leadeds is almost xplalling .
With the lack of respect for the planet that is the general future of today , what is to become of our children .
The cutrenr situation of the world 's environment is a safe one .
It is also however , a problem of which nuclear energy is only a small piece .
Unfortunately , the day will soon come when the damage caused by his apathy will be irreversable .
This is why it is imperstive to watch today .
It statgs with you .
Write your local ocngreswman .
An invention of the 20th century which I think has significantly change people 's lives is the jhvention of the airplane .
The relatives to which this information has altered people 's lives is asstronomicla .
The air opened roads to traveling and also braodemed people 's perceptions of the entire world .
It also introduced what seemed a completely impossible concept which no human is capable of doing for a machine : the concept of fight .
Before the invention of the iarplabe , long diustanfe traveling was a very difficult , time consuming task .
For this reason people did to travel extremely long distances and missed the opportunity of visiting countries with cultures very different from their own .
Obe could travel by boat but this was convenient and often dangerous because of various things like disease , hunyer , and threatening weather ; also as noted above , it was extremely time consuming .
Because of the lack of long dustancs travel people often have a very ethnocentric and limited concept of the world .
I have learned a lot about my own culture just from being in Spain and that is the only foreign country I have ever visited .
I can admit that before I came to Spain I was very ignorant about other cultures .
Even though I would watch the news and read about other cultures I still did not have the opportunity to express it first hand .
The invention of the airplane has opened many pubs and one other option is international rleagions .
Since the invention of the ariplane the world has increased dlowe contact between political sysgejs , and international business endeavors .
The frequency that which foreign countries are able to communicate and talk face to face has improved drastically the establishment of international trade .
The airplane has also basically soweded up the whole local communication system also .
Television with azirplanes is more rapid psced .
Cars , telephones , and nuclear energy are just three example of inventions and discoveries that have had good effects on modern new life .
We must remember , however , that the field of technology is not the only one in which sighificant advances have been made in the 0rh century .
Another " discovery " of this pay century has been feminism , which has had a significant impact on the lives of both meb and women .
Of course , the issue of feminism is not a new one , but it is just within the past century that much progress has been made towards the equalify of women ( with the important excdption of women winning the right to vote in the 1800s ) .
As recently as the 1950s , it was still the most typical as well as the ideal to have the woman in the home , housekeeping and reading the children .
The first significant equal rights movement in the U.S. was in the 70s with the Squal Rthts Amendment , which faird .
Even today , the woman is still not learning something like 60 cents for every dolae that a man earns .
Feminism does not only have to do with work and money , but also with the image of women .
It 's only recently that we 've " discovered " , or begun to think about rather , how much things as raising as pirnopgraphy or the language we use helps to form the image of women .
A recognition of such influences on the image of women is the first step in breaking it down , so that women are seen for who they really are .
Feminism is better described as a " country in progress " ; it 's a movement , an attitude that has not gey become mainstream .
Only when women have cahievef equality with men , will there cease to be a need for feminism , and the dkdcovery will have been completed .
The idea I feel that has most significantly changed people 's lives in the 20th century is that of cleaning for the environment .
Today , people have become aware of the importance of environment to our future .
Psole are condernex with nuclear weapons .
We realize the countries that which have many ways have the power to destroy the world .
Alsd related to this topic is nuclear sawste .
Nuclear waste is not only harmful to humans ; it also kills animals and plants .
We are now fightijg for zdts to lean up our lales and rivers .
Companies are no longet able to freely dump their waste w / o being heavily fined .
People have also become concerned with nature .
We use to assume our natural resources were never snding .
Now , though , we realize what we use , needs to be replaed .
For example deforestation is a very big issue , many groups have formed to plant more trees .
We will realise our fuels rights need to be used more conservatively .
Another important topic we are all aware of is recycling .
This links 2 issues , one of not peoducxing mc nonbidoegradalbe products and the other of reusing what we have .
( Reydling in a small way also helps those w / o homes b / c they receiovd money for their previous ) .
Many countries globalization that recycling is not only beneficial to their economy it also is beneficial to their environment .
Another important issue is that of conserving energy .
In the past , once again , we asshmed our energy was never ending .
Now though people are more inclined to turn off their lights when they 're not in their town , to not leave taps running and exhausted not to waste our natural resources .
We realize that xobserving is not beneficial to our environment but it is also saves money .
We have also become more considerable of our animal life .
We are no longer able to kill animals freely .
We do still rxisr some for food but hunting is immune and we are also aware of the possibilities of extinvtion .
One reakizes that animals have things too .
In conclusion , the idea of caring for the environment is still a new oj .
We are slowly becoming more aware and are beginning to take more precautions .
The ideas above are just a few of the topics we are more confident with .
But we are headjng in the right direction and hopevul by the 21st century we will have done everything we have destrlged !
Computers have definitely magical peoples lives .
I have a computer and my life has change because of it .
I 'm able to store almost all the information I need for school and for other things in my computer whereas before I had a computer my eyes was cluttered with paper and records of all sorta , I no longer need to keep these recordw but not to transfer them to my computsr .
This happens I 'm able to store more information in an organized fashion .
though I have only used a fractjo of my computer 's ability , I 'm still aware of the tremendous opportunities which I have or will have .
Aside from being able to sports great amounts of info , I 'm also able to process and to wdit things quickly .
For example , without the use of a computer I have to balance my checbkoopk once a month and hxr to this with a czlxulator , a prb and a piece of paper .
Of course , this was very time consuming and ilen to error . With the use of a computer I have programme the computer to make the calculations which I once how to make .
Also , w/ the use of the Word Prpcessor I 'm able to eeir and rearrange documents w / out axktering the entire document , and furtjermorr , though I have get to use the Communications program in my computer , this prkhram seems to be extraordinarjly helpful .
My father has the same program in his competition and is able to buy on line tickedts w / out leaving the house and moreover w / out picming up the phone .
Also , I realize that my experience with computers is limited and that the power of computers , for me , is incomprehensaiblw .
I 'm born here in Madrid .
How did I get there ?
Well , I applied to the this program , was accepted , and flew here from the US .
But , w / out the use of computers I would still be struggling with the secretafy in the International Prograzmw Office at Boston University , no availability .
Insteax , once I applied to the prigrawm- the application the which was probably computer generatee- I assume my infi was processed by a computer .
W / out this luxury , the International Prigrams Ofdiec would inevitably inundatwd w/ papewrlrk and things will therefore be lost or at least mjsplaced .
When killing my clothing , though I did not do this myself , the transportation would sem impossible like the way of computers .
Computers have had a most significant impact on the people in the latter 1/2 of the 20th century .
An invention of the 20th century that I think has significantly changed propel 's lives is television .
TV allows the essential communication of ideas , mages , news , etc .
Now , if something is happening in any kind of the world from across town all the way to Beijing -- every person in the world can watch this event as it is happening .
While previous people have to wait days , or even weeks for news ( which consixted of second - or their - hand accounts , which always involved much interrpetatioh and disfortion ) now they can see it happening , for themselves , as it is happening , this allows fhem to make their own , ijofrmed judgment baout tje event ; and if a reaction is necessary- such as the gathering of ooposiyion to a certain lqw -- it cxb be made immediately , while the emotions qr still strong , and before the action is finaluzwd .
As well , the fact that so many people ( especially in the US ) have television cars means that everybody ( well , at least everybody who qagches ) receives the same intoow of information and ideas .
So , for example , people in Spain can be informed about how people in California or Japan speak and act , this allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas .
In my opinion , this is one part of the process of making the world a " small " , more unifsd place , or a " global village " as one journalist has called this world of the International Ags .
Not only the news , but also entertainment is an important practical function of taxis , through television entertainment , as though literature and eram , people learn different messages about life .
They can see famous actions acted out to their emdz , and understand the consequences of these actions , without having to perform the same actjojs and experience the consequences for themselves .
Uncortunately rese TV shows are not always acfurate portrayals of team life and have a Ferrari to glorify violoece , as well as making love with the god you always wish , who always lives thru dangerous situations .
However , this sense of reality is not so detailed , and so hiddrn that people are going around axtjng like Superman .
As long as one has a well - developed sense of reapitry , TV can be an excellent tool for understanding the world we are in .
The waters of the ulounary seas have been calm and xonsiatant for centuries .
Progress has move sloq like the tidses and the certain grown of the waves have sdhowe little changed .
However with the daubreak of the twenty century a ator has brewed .
With this storm the waters had churned and spawned a wave that has crashed upon the teams of every kitchen .
This wave is the jicroeave .
However before uas such an information reduced a science like this .
A complete beeak has been based in the way food is prepared .
At the dawn of time , car krn cooked joint flesh over open fvites .
As History profressed , sports and garbeques mesrged .
Technology has the advent of the whole stove , and laetr ones tyeled by cpal .
modern times was as and rivers ranhes as to staple .
All these things had one thing in common : FIRE .
Dpame , the source of life , always used to prepare the means of mankind without History .
However , the microawve used radkagion to ecite water partijlces in food , this creating production , which creates hdwt .
This is a primne example of thinking that does not follow in our footstepe but breais aeah from convention and forges new routws .
If this were not amazing enough , the microwave cleaning cooking time in half .
If you had told someone 100 years ago that you could cut long time in half , and not use food , they would have thought you crazy , or beitchef , or inddr the influence of heavy drugs .
In an way where time is the scarcest comodity , our society has emhraced this edliminaxtor of wasted time in the kitchen .
A mother who works , can come home and pick up something in minutes in the nicroawve , whereas before she would have been leaving in the kiyvhen .
The microwave is excellent for re - heating making it easier for people to make excess food to be eaten later .
About time is conserved -- Children are able to use this simple deuce without parental care of fieez starting .
Gof As I have said before , there is no fire !
This marvel of technology has helped people propole our the diszing pace of life that most of us lived in the 20th century .
Although History one can see that grey revelations in all areas come from breaks in tradition , new interests , and different perspectives .
All these were needed to created the mjcrowave which is essential nowadays .
Eating is something everyone must do .
This device has picked up one of our most important activities and this revolutionized life in the fast paced 2tj century .
When I was in tenth year a teacher said that the 2 most important inventions that made possible the idea of a repressive government were the machine uh and the radio .
A primary gun can be used to keep civil place , enforce Marshall Law .
The radio can be used to communicate events and under a dictatotship , programs .
In the 20th century the machine gfjn has not changed all that many lives ( especially for those that it ' s killed ) , but the invention of radik has made a tremdnsous impact .
The idea behind the trip is simple .
There is one transjitter and it senss its sigbals through the zid , waves , with potential for millions of receigers .
In the 20gh Century radcoo has become a source of information and enfertaijment .
Radio keeps people jnfkrmed .
I don ' t think any people of my generation can even vomprehen now our lives would be different .
Every morning I keen for the weather July and deesd accodribgly .
At night one can sit by the door and meet yokw the students of the day uinfolde .
Radil , bencfe , gives people the option of become passive observers rather than active participants in the news making process .
Newspapers had been around for many years but it was not until the invention of radip that the pore of the media became ecident .
Radioo gives the ability to teach many more people , instantly .
As a form of entertainment , rarko and it most important and now more common offshoot , television , has changed people 's lives .
A typical day for a child in today 's world , consists of going to school and coming home to watch T.V.
There have been new forms of entertainment , for example videgoames , means for the other form of entertainment .
Nowadays everybody watches T.V.
My señora , for example , is over 100 years old , and for her T.V. is the rsatest thing in the word .
She wits in front of it all day and it keeps her happy .
Television offers soap operas , game shows , sit - doms , sporting events , movies and much more to keep us etnertained 24 hours a day .
In short , I does ' t know what life was like before work , but this invention has changed the way we see and do things .
A furtent identity in the United States today is for one to be successful , one must follow all of the written and unwritten rules of society ,
everyone has an easy opportunity to succeed and when one did not do this one fall .
One can see these ideas in popular media everyday .
T.V. comercials and T.V. programs project models of how one should be .
In the 20th Costa , the values of / that the United States was founder on have changed in being and order wen improved to modern day America , nothing was ever equal .
And today , since the invention and uriljzation of modern technologies such as computers life for americams moved at a much faster pacd .
People are use stem , even work more , and buy more things , buy time for relax and family are often sibstitued with T.V. In Alericz , this growing individulaistid society , one nolonger sees the realjtive humanness between people , instead one sea the differences , the encourages , the unsuccessfull , andc attributd thire inadequacy to schjeve to a lack of ecfort .
With everyone loving at such a fast pace , the gaps are able to know , the choices of the mass media easily rellace those voices that disturb to be heard .
The parts of the new lachine that need oiled and regulated .
When Voltaire srote Candide , a literary etyoe known as Neoclassicism was at its peak .
There was a group of scholars in France , l'Acaemoe Frdnaçwks , that set guidelines for French literature .
According to l'Acaedmke Vrahçais , all literature of the Jeoxlassic period must follow the dulesw of propiett which revulatee the author should avoid certain topics , including sex , choice , church , and xatte issues .
Another standard upheld by the Academie is the idea of veriksimilitude , making literature as realistic as possible by keeping the time , settingt and pllt try to love .
Michael , as a Nelcdlassicist , knew all these regjlafions and followed them in his liferature .
However , when writing ndide , oltaide drfisd the Academie 's rules .
Candide is a pzrosy on the gyidelunes of Neoclassicism .
Neoclassicists liked for litsraturs to have good moments : they did not want to step on another 's tlws by mentioning se , violence , xhurcg , or statd issues .
In Candide Volatire did t seem to mninc shopping on trees - in fact , he did not mind smashing feet !
Voltaire went bryonjd the comfort ldvwl when he mentioned sex .
He tells of the two girls of Orellion who were lovers of konkeys , and of the Baron who vahed with the Musselman and was ounished for his himozexual car .
She turned into giilence when Cuneogmde was being rapdd by a Barber , and witmessed his murder while he was on yol of her .
The wise old woman undewrent the reval of a bytrock by lirateds , as well as exlerjencing tale .
After the Bwron is caught bathing with the Mussdaoman , he recdivew 100 weeks for his sij .
Candide says the Baron , a Jesuit Priwst , ate the Barin foebids Fandides marriage to Cunegonde .
Ironically , although Voltakre mentions many ztcs of violejce , each act is trezted lightly : Cuneyonde and the old woman both tell their tales of being defilwr like an entertaining story in their conversations about their travelw ; the Baronh also clients his real with style after teoilng of his brtaing ; and afyre Candide " kills " the Baron , he leavrs to search for Cunegonde wity no decond thought intl he reencolunters the Baron later in his traveos .
The light attitude in which these facts of sex and violence are written shows the parody form in which Voltaire writes Camdide .
Voltaire chooses not to stay away from the cburch and stare issues .
He attracts the hilplcracy of the Churcg in the old woman 's father being the Pope .
When Candioxe visit the land of Eldoardo , Voltaire shows the people 's perfect relationship to God : they only peaise God because there is something they want from Tom .
Voltaire ised this perfect relationship to God in an unrealistic situation to foil society 's appropriate relationsip with Fd in the real world .
Voltaire makes run of azristocracy in his description of the Baron , who damd from 71 generations of nkbiligy but still lavkls gentilesse .
Candixe and his companions die with 6 dethroned kings who respect the overimportance society places on hierarchg .
In his portrayal of the tuopian society of Eldorado , Viktaire goil the imperfecfiohs of our society .
According for Lunde , 35% of homicide bictiks are klked by someone they know .
Statisti from 56 are faster than Lindes ' fhrsis .
Frustratiin is the main factor most impljcated in these tragedies .
Most cases are those of the " trigger puling the finger " .
Today , racua prejudice still ezjsts , but last action has taken place than 30 years ago .
Thirty years ago , minorities could n't ride a bus , vote , or go to school with white people .
Desegragatikn reduced some prejudice , but it will exist .
The diffrerence is , today social preujdice is not openly expressed as it was 30 years ago .
I would tell the client to be extremely nice to that person and do favors for that person .
That person would then feel important to do nice things back and return favkres .
This is based on unhealthy yhery .
It would be better for the client to do new things for the person that it would be to wsm a form of the person .
Someone who ove in the month who comes to live in the south may not be prejusic towards Blacks at first .
After living in the world for a while , they may also without agtitudes towards lakes and feel prejudice toward them .
Ti is conformity .
The same goes for Southerners who move north .
They come to feel oremudice heard Jhews .
I know someone who has lived all over the world .
He is prejudice toward Jdwa , Blacks , and Mexicans .
He wdolted white xttitudes against minorities in the different region he has lived in .
Our country has been coihsd a " warming - pool " inferring that we all come from different that we all dime from different bqcktround but have jnoinde or meet together to prosice homogeneous Americans .
But a persons jeritsge , as we are realising , is important to their sense of self and comminiuty .
Rthbic American customers have been receiving and trying to receive roots that were once passed off to a modelk U.S. cities .
The differences they are redkscoveding only add more color , flavor and excitement to that brewing " lit " of our people .
However , some individuals and even groups of Americans are teacting negatively to this ethnic ewxplosion ( even most entertaining through the arts ) .
They do n't want to accept these differences .
They cuooze to remain indifferent to the oights of their fellow Americans .
As Ellie Eeisel , authoe of such vooks as Night says about indifefrece : it is the opposite of everything good .
The opposite of love , beauty , intelligence , livhy , jpyt , life and vrowth are not their familiar ontonyms but indifference .
Ethnic American literature tries to fight this indiffdrwnce by vjvidpy and unquely expressing certain aspects of different American culture .
The amount of inside American literature is without bunds .
Every group has its own prculiarities and attribures that make it 's writing uhmique .
In many years the words used in ethmiv American literature reflect a knowledge of a different " mother tongue " .
For instance , Matie Adricans parties is more expressive and visual partly because their language is dwepyl followed in the observation of the natural environment .
Chinese American Literature is philosophical / litewl because their native language is so .
Afdicazn American kiterature is often melodious and historic mirorring their similar achievements in Jazzy and Blues music .
All these exakplex ( and more ) give us some jnsight to other cultures we would therefore never know .
The storues told in this gwnre of literature , however , are only the most important wsect of Ethnuc American literature .
It is through the experiences of the characters that we learn about the different cultures in the United States .
When we learn of the trials and hardships that they went though we can sympethize with their emitions and try to accept that diversiry .
The stories of bpack merican slsves and of concentration czlp victems are necessary to avoid indifference .
Without learning about the past ( and present ) here there is no way to ensure future happiness .
