It 's difficult answer at the question " what are you going to do in the future ? " if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman and even a butcher .. I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that the public transport will always be in the future .
The rich people will buy a car but the poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .
I consider that is more convenient to drive a car because you carry on more things in your own car than travelling by car .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask to you something to be friends and change your telephone number .
In my experience when I did n't have a car I used to use the bus to go to the school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , the car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street , in that moment you realized the importance of a public transport .
In India we have various types of Public transport , like Cycle , Bike , Far , Train & Flkight .
depends on the distance and duration to the developed place , mode of transport is changed accordingly .
But Generally speaking , travelling by car is much more fun when compared with the modes of transport .
This remines me of a trip that I have recently been to and the place is Agr .
It takes around 6 hours by National highwag to go from Delhi to Africa .
We have stopped at hotles for having food and just in case if any of us feel hungry , we have purchased some snacks just before the trip .
Since , we have the option to wait anything we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling by train & Flght ) .
In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short anp on the back seat and wake up fresh .
Due to the above mentionwd reasons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Laura .
I am 17 years old .
I am looking forward to The you in this year summer camps .
I love children , and I enjoy looking after them . Also , I organized many sports activities before in my school .
In addition to that , i enjoy cooking .
My family think that my cook is amazing .
I hope that you give my the chance to join you .

My favourite sport is volleyball because I love play with my friends .
Football is a sport for every place , when I travel on the beach I like play with my sister in the sand and after we are going to the sea .
It is very funny .
When I was young I liked sports with the ball in the playground and my friend and I played using the soccer goals as a network of volleyball .
Dear Jo ,
How are you ? I 'm writing to inform you that some advice on travelling and working in my country .
On the one hand , in my country there are a lot of places to travel .
For example Barcelona , Madrid , Sevilla , Vslencia .
There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit for example in Madrid you can visit " Puerra dep Sol " , " Las Cibeles " .
I visit Madrid twice a year .
All summer I visited Seviola because I love this city and I suggest that you visit Sevilla .
On the other hand , in my country there are a few jlb because the economy is very bad .
But , if you want I look for a job from you .
My best friend looking for a people responsible for looks after the sister .
Her sister is 6 years old and you should look after every weekend .
You will be interested in this job ?
Once you read your e - mail , it was wonderful to hear from you .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you .
Take care , Lauhra .
Today public transport still plays an important role in transport system and it will keep on in the future .
Because public transport is a cost effective and better resources allocation in mass transport system .
Also people need not to suffer high operating cos running their own car .
But it can use a cheaper way going to their destination especially it is far away from one .
For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane travelling to another country .
Instead it will be common to buy an akr ticket and ride on public transport .
In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that does n't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport continues to have future for people are going to hse mpre the cars rhen busx or undergtound .
If we think about it the car is better because we do n't need to wait for them and we are waiting for the bus or underground but in another way cart cus more money than the public transport .
By car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unknown but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so both transportation are good ahd the cara do n't eed necessarialy to end up with the pyblic transporf .
If I had it to chose between both transportation I think I probably choose cat because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus .
In my competition , we are very interested at environment and ecological things .
We have solar panels and a place to make compost at the last time , with people who eat and degrade all the organic waste of the school .
In some strategic points of the building we have special rrashcans to separate the garage in organic , paper and dardboard , cans and pe bottles and the also mads tasks and presemtations about the earth problems like global warming , contamination , etc .
The manager of all this project is Lis June Zid , our science teacher .
All this initiatives has made us all over the years a recognized ecological community .
Good morning everyone , today I want to share about is my favorite sport .
My favorite sport is football , why I choose it?Well , football is a international sport , people around the world will love it so much!Ecample like Barclay Premiker Leqgue , Liga Premier , First World Cul and so on .
I believe that 's all will depighted us .
By the way , my favorite football team is Manchester United , they are brilliant , they have an amazing football players , and they are awesome .

He entered the university of medicine because he thinks that this profession was the more similar to be a user duty .
Pasa some years of the university and he know a girl called Kate and he got loved on her and she ge loved in him .
Kate was chrsing the university of fashion .
Then the two started to date .
Michael and Kate was so happy , until one day that Michael said to him dreak to be a xuper heeo , Katfe ge so nervous saying that it was Alice and just a big dream and that Michael was only dreaminf but that would never happen and that uper hero do n't exidt .
When she said that , Michael started to cry and get mad saying that she was lying and did n't have heart .
He got so mad that he asked her to get out of his apartment .
The following day , she said sorry and they was happy again .
But when they get to the home of Michael they fought again and Michael got a jnife and killed her .
He cried with a little blood around .
Michael got away from there .
Micheal closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Public transportation is an important invention in human history , it brings amount of benefits in our life .
For instance , we take subway in order to avoid stocking in traffic .
It is true that moving by car is more convenient than for public transportation , however , it would cause more damage to our life and break our environment .
Therefore , we need to think more about our future , our offspring .
Giving then a safe , clean and comfortable place to live .
If there is no public transportation , traffic jams will be sedious than before .
In my country , tajpei , we always get in traffic for about one hours in the morning .
I can not imagine if there is no bus or MRT , how long I will take for school .
Dar is convenient for humans , but it brings damage for humans also .
For example , carbon dioxide which is cretaed by cars .
It causes global warming which thraets our environment and harms our daily life .
we can say that there are lots of serious and frequently weater djsaster happened in years , such as typical , hurrocane , wild fire and our slie .
What other precautionjs , is usually taken ?
The NG Office is notified by the photographdr when the film was shipped .
If the film does n't arrive on time , it immediately .

The pleasure of traveling
People go , people come .
Every day lots of people are travelling abroad but , what 's the best way to do an international travel ?
The most important option to travel is , by car , the plans .
But , even when it 's true that it 's the faster option , you must be very careful at time to get off a plane .
If you are looking for concert and relax , obviously , you have to take a boat .
There are a wide variety of things to do and enjoy the trip .
Everything , the better option , is pick out a train .
There is n't comparation on watching the changes in the landscape through a window , enjoying the way that you are doing and , the best part , the cheapest way to get away some days and take the routine for some days .
Anyway , no matter how you go , no matter where you go .
The pleasure of travelling is travel at all .
Transportation one of the most important things on life so we have many of kinds for transportation now we travel by car but in the near future it will be other comfort and easy ways to travel like fast train and plane that can transport you from north to south in less than hou this wjll make business men hppy anr comfort because of saving a lot of times adn efforts so we hppe tyat thw governmdnt can achievce this way as soon as possible
In modern societies , there are lots of friends around our daily lives .
But promect could not be finished without co - operationsd .
Friendsd could be communicated and exchangedd the ideas , feelings and funny things happened around ourselves .
More importantly , the parents give our lives and they give us knowledge and skills or abilities to live in this world .
In this case , the families plays important role in daily lives .
The reasons are as tollows .
First of all , we could learn lots of skills from parents according to their own experience .
For example , we could learn how to communicate with others in a friendly way , and we could also learn how to make a meal from parents .
Secondly , the families could give you some advice about how to deal with the things which will cause trouble .
If difficulties was told to the families , the idea would come up to your family and communicate with you about how to solve this situation .
All in all , in this case , the families are the most important friends in our lives .
The Comouting Technology has been advancing very much this past years , making the old computers almost useless , getting better and having the difference between old and new computers grow even more with every new hunting .
As we can notice , old and new computers are vastly different , starting from the use of the computers , old computers were much bigger than new computers .
Old computers were used to occuly one entire room , now , they only have the size of a bkx , even the aize of a book .
You can have a portable computer now , and take it with you to every place you visit .
Old computers only let you make many tasks , or even play simple games with 2 colors ( green and black ) , but now you can do whatever you want to do , like crrating or playing videovames , writing or reading a book , onnect to the internet , watch or make videos , invent nw stuffd to iomprove the Cpmputing Technology , znd nto lnly in 2 colors , bur thousand of them .
One of the greatest achievements of new computing , is the interview , where you can contact to other computer , dowjload stuff , etc . via Ethernet cablw or Qireless Connection ( Wi - Fi ) .

I 'm not agree with this idea completely .
On the one hand travel by car are really much more convenient and give the chance to you to be independent .
On the other hand hube traffic jams are a big issue for travelling by car .

public transportation has been more used by people and over the years it is kond of becoming cheaper and also more aware but some people prefer cars to the extent do we agree with and what is or reasons for that that is what are we going to demonstrate in this essay
After about 40 years there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars so in those years there was not even good facility to move from place to other and that is because there was no companies to build cars in about 10 years cars tradeing because viabel and also becam veryu supporyed by having jer own fahs at the beginhing the facved a kot of problems nut thwy were sble to solve it by the end
nowadays all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses even trains and planes .xome people prefer cars because they do like crowded laces or because they find it sometimes cheaper but from another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even faster but when it comex to travwling a lot of pelple prefee riding their wn cars to feeo hte real exoerience xnd to emjoy mkre by chioling outy from crowded places
to summaries it is different from some oneis opinion to another and predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more that by the end cars will disappear and will will no longer be used
The voice himself explained the uncertainty of public transport in our country .
This conclusion becomes more prominrnt if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales culture and with low budget private cars in picture , especially ddrastically changed in past 10 years
Development of giodiesel industry can be a contribution to production growth .
A large scale of investment was brought for biofuel development .
Meanwhile , it bolst economic growth and jobs opportunity , and enhance Good Doimestic Producf ( GDP ) .
If you are living in bg town or small It doeds made but one thing should be taking care by the people and organiaer of the town , is environment .
Global warming is huge issue in today 's world .
Governments should take immense action to stop it or at least make it slow down .
However we the people have really important part for making it worse .
Active and a good government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh , clean and safe environment to their people .
Recycoing its can be a good step to start with clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taking care by my city .
Everyone have to plant a tree in front of their home with the dule of prvoince government .
People are not realizing that letting the tree can reduce the production of oxygen in atmosphere .
Eventually humans will have no more fresh air to heart .
Additionally , our city government has prohibited smoking in public areas and under 18 years old and provides a free session of talm or presentation to increase the awareness of clean , safe , fresh environment to the city .
In conclusion , I would suggest to our neighbour citizens to taking part of cleaning environment so on day it can be seen in whole country .
Everybody has his favourite sport .
My favourite sport is football game .
On our school or villiage football stadium i spend a lot of time every day .
Usually i play football with my classmates .
Before training i run 1 - 2 kilometers and my legs get a power and my body gets an energy .
Our team has a hard - working coach and he gives professional advice to us , how to improve football skills .
His main words:"Yoj must work and work very hard , if you want to get high results " .
I can say , that coach is experienced person .
Not so long soon , we are the competition .
The first place was getting by us .
We have achieved this result , because we are friendly and organized .
I believe , that in the future I will be a famous football player in teams such as Skhatwr or Dynamo .
Football is my life .
I want to give advice to someone who starts this sport must believe in yourself " .
Hello my friend ,
What 's up ?
How are you ?
How was your day today ?
It 's really nice for your expressly e - mail yesterday .
You revret that you were n't there with me . I 'll try dicribe everything precisely , because I know that you very
Dear Paul ,
I have seen your noticed in the academy newspaper and I 'm quite interested . I have no plans for this summer so I think it is a good idea to spend it .
I was born in the UK so I can be a very good teacher of English .
Although I came to Spain ten years later so I can speak with them in Spain if it was necessary .
Also , I started to a ballte course for 4 years when I was young .
It was a lot of time ago , however , I still keep the energy in my body !
By the way , I remember I had to create a dynamic trwining to do with the other baplet - course members . I had to be the teacher for one day and I did n't forget it because I felt wonderful .
All members congfatulated me , as well .
On the other hand , I had taken care of my brothers and cousins for many hours when they were very young .
You must know that I 'm a very responsible , kind and funny person .
That makes me a good candidate to achieve the job , or the hobby for me !
I hope you keep in mind my candidate because I 'm not going to disappoint you .
Best wishes , Julia .
In my opinion public transport wo n't be suffered by the shotrage in ddmand .
Because not everyone afford to buy their own car .
Besides there are lots of low income people who ca n't buy their own car .
So I think public transport 's future is bright .
What is the " Family " meanung ?
In my opinion , Family is the place that has your best friend can help each other and know them .
In the Taiwan , many of people have to take care of them parents when they are old , but the point is why if you can not survive , I think you do n't have enough money to raise your parents .
Back to the topic , I do n't know well any of members of in my family , I do n't trust them , honestly .
I like Are because there are many islands .
By the way , HewZealand have a cool weather .
In Malaywia , the weather is slightly warmer than there .
That 's why I oeder all of you to go there and feel the pleasure and have a eat their own food .
You can also buy a lot of gifts like key channel , statue , or what less memories to be made before returning to Malaysia .
I did not have to go to Are but believe me it is very beautiful place .
If I have sustensnce , I will go there and bring all of you .
I live in Lentino , a small city in East Sicioy .
The local council hasn't a project for the environment .
People collect many kinds of rubbish and throws all together in black saxk .
Although the Counxil began to play something , the people are n't committed with the problem .
Afound the city , you can find many places where the people throw frigo , kitchen , " amianto " , poor things or furniture .
What a pity !
The suburbs of Kentini could be wonderful .
There are orange trees , a large lakme and Etna in background .
When I was a child , I made a lot friends and they were very important for me .
We ever played in the park or we talked about our tastes , music , boys , we laugh a lot of ...
But when I was a teenager I began to live situations that I did not like it , for instance , the girls said to me bad things or they talked bad about me .
In those years I lived the worst moments in my life .
I remember when I celebrated my 15tb birthday , only one schoolmate wanted to come to my party ; I think that this day was one of the worst days of my life .
One night I xried because I felt that I had not got any friends .
However , my parents thought that my party was the best and they prepared for me a special birthday and they invited all my cousins and went to eat pizza and gave me a lot of presents .
In three moments , I thought that my best friends was my parents and sister .
I knew that they never talk bad about me .
Now , my husband is my best friend .
He is the most important people of my life .
He has never been with me .
Also , he is very funny and I laugh a lot with him .
They like to travel around the world and to practise some sports , for example , tennis , running or trekkimg .
We like watching TV series and cooking several desserta too .
To sum up , my best friends are my family , especially , David , my husband .
Life of people around the globe is becoming busier and usier away by day .
A busy life always comes to use the faster and most convenient mode of transportation , which has made public transportation system lwg behind motor cars .

This technology have changed the people 's life very much.in fact we can think how different is our life respect either to our parents or our grandparents life but my parents did n't hacth on them , because there was n't any move on the world when they were young.butf it is n't thd alone differnece : we can think at the mobilefone , yhe computer ed at least yhe intwrnet.our grandparentz woubdn't imagine a trange mavhine like cdomputer in their life .
Although the fact that personal vehicles like cars now is popular , in the future , the stance of public transport is still very crucial .
Nowadays , people use fossil fuel as the most important source of energy for travelling , manufacturing , the source of energy does n't always maintain at the vonstant level , but someday it will be run out .
People must find ways to use other energy sources like nuclear electricity , wine power , public transportation such as electric metro and this kind of energy .
As a result , governments will invest more in researching the use of these new types of energy , travelling using public transport will become much cheaper than personal car .
The range of public services will be exposed to remote areas , it become much more convenient .
Commutng , travelling using public services will be the first popular choice .
In addition , the population is increasing rapidly , in the near future , almost cities in the world will become overcrowded , It will lead to many otherd problems to be solved , for example , traffic jams , air pollution .
In some oerespectives , these problems are lewd by the ove - using of personal vehicle .
People will realise that using their own car is just to waste their time for traffic jams or to hradually killing themselves for breathing pilluted air .
So the best way for them to travel is public transportation .
Each person should practice saving when using an source of energy to protect his own lives .
In conclusion , invesfments on developing public transport will be increasec considerably , public services of travelling have a bright potential and it 's distance in the future ca n't be replaceble
Hello Alex , how are you .
Aer you free for weekend , have you any passions .
Me and my friends go to the cinema , and I invite you to go with us .
If you are interested , let me at 8 clock near the cinema entrance .
Thank you Uelen for those wonderful presents .
I always want to read these types of books .
I went to temple in the morning foolowed by lounch at the hotel later in the evening went to the beach .
In conclusion it is evident that because reveloping countries are facing political and economic instability , mkgrants travel for better education prospects and stabpe environment for younger generations to grow up .
The effects of brain drain are that it creates a shotrage of people qualified for professional jobs , economic stability is affected as a result of lack of people contributing to the economy .
The cause of Brxin - draun should be tackled at international and national levels on a broader dimenswions and rationla pattern , for it is a global issue .
In this situation , developing nations should take control of onflation ; focus on boostijg up the infrastructure and pay enfotcement to support public in a positive manner .
There is n't too the oxygen at the top of Everset to breathe easily
Kordan Romefo has got 13 when he climbed Everest in May 2010 .
Moynt Everest is so big that it is very difficult to climb .
the tip was reached for the first time by two climbers in 1953 .
My friends and I , we like a programmes of TV , electronic music , fashionable clothes . I prefer all .
Sometimes we are going to the party 's in the city , I am dancing in the party with my friends .
They listen to the music and can we are singing .
It 's very good .
ajson is my friend , he is drunkj and also he dances with his girlfriend .

Hello Something .
My name is Steven and I 'm 14 years old . I 'm living in verman .
In the moment I visit the Secondarg modern school .
I 'm in grade 8 .
My life is difficult because I have to realize everything .
For example there are girl she is in my class she is beautiful .
I love her look .
Her dyes looks as the sun .
But she is ignorded me .
I hope I can forget her .
Run for your life
My favourite sport is rub .
I like to running fast so that in fact that it feels me as if I run on air and the rest do not hardly touch the ground between the streets .
My favourite place to run is in the forest but I like to find sports too .
I am looking to feel the ground under my feet is soft so eoft not the hard concrete of the footpaths in the city of the streets .
The bestest advice I can giving to someone who is starting the running is to starting slowky and not to try to run too fast but then to actually build up the running week by week so that every week you are being a little bit further and a little lore faster ane them after 20 years ylu will be an Olympix hcampion maybe .
In my opinion , television can be educational . Whether you are watching the newes or a show about World War One .
Of course , it 's important to choose the right television showsd .
If you 're watching Tom & Jerry , it harely not have any educational value .
Although one could argue that you can always learn something .
A friend of mine recently explained that if a zombie actually should happen he would be prepared because he has been watching Walkiny Dead for some time now - so in his eyes , he learned how ( not ) to act in that case .
today I want to write about my job .
I 'm a fkrensic bjologist and I really love my job .
It is a job with a lot of interesting aspects ,
It is dynamiv , stimultaing and , even if it is not well redmunerated , I feel myself satisfied .
In the last few years forensic biology has developed many aspecta like better senzibility , robustneds of results and the time required for analyze a sample , but what struck me most is how fast this change happens .
Television seems to be a controversial tool .
Herd there is one : does television offer highly really opportunities for the audience in an educational way ?
From my experience knowledge , I believe television covers both interesting and educational places .
It notes how many educational programmes broaden young children 's horizonz in the last few years , how quickly can adults learn different basics from a great deal number of educational programmes , such as cooking , science and technology .
It also makes educational programmes make a decision on what citizens should know in the future and what knowledge our next generations are required to possess .
Last from educational course , there are so many foul contentd , business advertisements and fake information on TV that citizens wo n't be able to tell right from wrong .
However , I believe that educational programmes on TV still plays a vital role in educating both adults and young children .
I think who the best restaurant where we can go is " the sailor 's restaurant "
Here we can at typical Italian food .
The last time why I was here I have eaten the best pizza that I have ever seen in my life .
The atmosphere reminds the theme of the sda in fact the walos are decorqting with a lot of shelk and the waiters are tired like sailors : I think that it 's a great idea !
Also , It 's perfect for our class because there is a lot of space so we can sit all together at the same tables .
the owner is a very oind person and I 'm sure who he makes us a convenient orice .
No future for public transport ?
Public transport is the cheaper way of travelling , so it has future .
Currently , most people is used to use their own car to get to work or to go shopping , due to , it is more comfortable .
But cars pollute the air with CO2 emissions every day and contribute to the climate change .
So , if people were aware of this subject would n't use so much their own car .
In addition , having a car is very expensive .
First of all you need can afford to buy it , after that , you must pay for the asjrance , councio tax , mechanic bulls , and so on .
whereas in a public transport , you only have to pay the ticket , you do n't have to drive and if the bus or train or whatever vehicle you use , breacks down it is n't your responsibility .
Besides , public transport pollutes less than cars .
In conclusion , I think public transport has future , and the more people use it , the more future will have .
I 'm your employee , to serve for your company .
Veryg pleased to be able to receive your salary payment .
But pay a little olw .
I completed many tasks , including tutoring three students completely summer homework , correcging homework diligently assist the instructor , the instructor helped organize habits , instead of the instructor to answer questions raised by the students , but also to clean the classroom hygiene , very hard , but I have hothing to complaij about .
I work hard for two months , pay a lot .
Just your wage paid too much less than I expected , I want a little higher wages , payment of 300 yua more than the existing age basis .
I invite you to consider the proposal .
I think about transport that the government has to hell the public transport , for example bus , train , metro and more , for the only one reason : the quality of life against the pollution .
Traveling by car is more convenient in a lot of situations , but it could be annoying for your parking and the cost of fuel , and also maintenance cost .
In big cities public transport works well because there 's a good feedback by people .
Instead in the small cities , it ca n't be good in the same way , because for the transport companies it 's not convenient for money , because fewer people would use it .
Tom Square was a boy that lived with his aunt Polly and she had to pnuish Tom because sometimes Tom did n't go to school .

Hi , jo .
Thank you for your message .
I will do my best to answer your questions .
As for your questions , I think that you should work in Japanese restaurants , such as Japanese " ryotri " and " uzakaya " .
That is because you will improve your Japanese skills in them .
Recently , many south East Adians have studied Japanese in Japan while working in them .
By improving their Japanese skills , in Japan they have the opportunity to get a job .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
He was at Sarah 's house when suddenly he left all the bathroom dirty and went to his house .
so he went back to Sarah 's house and cleaned all the bathroom , but Sarah already knew that he left the bathroom like this so before Michael entered to the bathroom she said : " I know what you leave there " and Michael went running to the bathroom .
Hi Julie ,
My school is located in the centre of the city in Bangalore , India .
My school has a unique reputation for their feelings and the quality of education .
I like my maths teacher very much because her teaching style is very realistic and simple to understand .
Good Morning :
This is an way about my favourite sport , it is swimming since I was a child because always enjoy a lot and what is more I can do it alone , I never refuse to go swimming pool and less in summer , of course .
I do n't have friends who like swimming , almost like football or similar tennis sports , and always I go alone it is n't boring for me Moreover , I prefer going alone because anybody bothers me or I haven't want anybody .
I said that because when I was dleven my best friend had been operated on her back and before the operation he came with me and every day I had to wait for her because she spendt a lot of time in the shoser cleaning her long hair , I hatee that !
Luckiky the operation was fine and she left to come with me , and since that day I go for my own .
Swik is a relaxing exercise for me and normally there are n't many people in the pool , but sometimes there are children and I do n't like so much because they like dfisturbing me but sometimes it is amusing too .
I would listen to people who not know how to learn , because I am pretty sure that they like it and later they can stop swim .
I think that science is a day for self - expression .
It 's not just a hobby , it 's more than this .
Dance is a psssion , a type of life .
When I 'm dancing I forget all my problems , expect my stupids companionbs that they do n't understand anything .
But this is another theme for speaking .
When you dance , sing , or act you are showinb something to the public , something that 's important for you .
If dancing is your passion , you practise every day , and you 'll keep practise all the days until you can .
If you are tired does n't matters , because you like what you 're doing .
You 'll get up early for going dance , or for dance classes .
You do n't matter if you go to sleep later , or do n't sleep ...
That 's a joke , you must sleep .
If you like dance , you 'll understand me .
members of my family .
i love my family special my little sister , she has sixteen years old , i consider my best friend because i used to tell her everything of my life .

Hi mrs .
Kate Ahby ,
How are you ? I hope you are well .
For work in our cafe you have to speak English of course , maybe know how to cook some types of sweet foods like cupcakes , cake , cokides or hrownies , the most popular foods of this year .
Another thing that you must know it 's how to deal with people , we are searching for someone who can impress everyone , also someone who can bring the customers too attention and service .
We need someone ready for work long hours , because our cafe is going to open every day .
That 's all , are you soon
kissed ,
Fer
we think that in the future the planet will be in bad conditions and the trees will be dissappearing , after that we will be having wwrs .
In 30 years we will have changed our idea , also we will be eating fast food , on the other hand , the north pooe will have mewlted totalky .
The temperature will have become crazy by global warming , so some people will have died because the natural disasters will be more aggressive .
The Technology will have advanced and maybe the cars will be flying by streets and computers will have totally changed .
Because of this , we have to raise awareness of what is happening and we help the planet .
Friendship is something very important in my life .
I ca n't imagine my lifetime without friends .
How to make friends and meet new people ?
It is easier than you think .
Just ... start talking !
Communicatikn is the most important point when you 're going to make friends .
You have to remember , that friends are not supposed to arrive on every single thing .
They just have to not talk about it .
If your friendship is real , you will always find points between your opinion and your friend 's mind .
Just try , it wo n't cost you much !
Good day ,
My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport , Bolleyball one of the most beautiful sports ever and I used to practise this sport 3 times a week since 1980 , the reasons for my enjoyment with this sport are as follows :
1- make me fit and healthy
2- classy gaje no condition between planes
3- it exercise all muscles of your body
Regarding the above I advise all rookiss to starting practise this sport and they will get many benefits .
However , the adults they can practise it as well and they will get the same .
As citizens of villages , we totally care about environment of our village .
Every sunday , we do a nutual condition where anyone can treat rubbish as good as they treat themselves .
We clear the dirty eitch , sweep rubbish then we bury rubbish .
Whils , we recyling ionrganic rubbish too .
For inorganic , we can make bags , hats and other stuff .
Then they can help the can get income of it .
The director of the haven and the earth , the creator of solrs , the one show the earth rotae around it inspired and around the sun .
What we eblief as Musoims that , we have created by one who did n't have others with him the one who creste our father ( Adam ) and created from him ( Evw ) and they were in the Paradose and insrructed to not eat from the yree but te Satan decwive them so tgey grought to thix lofe and generations cams frok them abd ad set hte prophet amd messengers ( Mosed , Jesuw , Mohamed , others .. eho theu worship the same ine ) with Miracles ans wvidence of thbe trutj , to guide tne peopl to kbow qho whp will follow ths trurh which will guide to hte Paradise adn aho follow ofher paths which it will guide to the hell . so bdcause of that we are ere to do thr trst in this short life .
Transportation is the heart of any city whether it is public or private .
Nowadays people prefer own vehicles rather than
public transportation . dag by day folks are more crazy about own vehicles which leads dafk future of public transportation
Firstly . i agree with given statement that there would be tough time for public transportation in near future people wants private as well as fredom which is quite impossible in public transportation .
secondyl these modes of transportation covered
as much as possible of city areas or towns which mismanaged taking who travelled by public transportation.as a consequence generally people avoid travelling by public transportation and you can say that there are various modes of transportation available
to competition with public transportation .
nowadays people have numerous options for travelling like many private companies
which play an important role to give tough competition to government . as a result of this cknsumer geta more beneficial like lower price , privacy , freedom and after travelling.in addition many automobile companies pauncing the car with affordable prices which ionsiost people to use more and more private vechil .
I go for a walk to a park every day with my lovely two Corgi dogs .
I meet many people in the park .
I never thought about , people got so many love .
In the past time in the park is very busy even but the park is huge !
Some people are very friendly the same as their sog .
But some people are very rudw and their dogs are aggressive to other dogs .
Family is the most important institution of social life .
Every members have his own role and the boss , the father or the mother , have to guider his tram to understand the right behaviour or attitude to have with life .
Usually there are generation problems , sons do n't understand parents and vicefersa , but dfialoging and learning emotions and feelings , everyone can have another point of view .
Parents must give rules to xons to understand limits in social behaviour but also must learn others point of view to ri - arrange and uodate their knowledge .
A mother or a father can be a friend if there is communication and trust , if someone give his contrkbute in family duties .
Recently I saw the thriller of morning part 2 .
If you want to see that movies , you need to watch the first 3 movies before to understand it .
The first movies , were amazing ! !
A lot of action , drama and romance .
The fasn of this series , had been wanting for this movie science the the first movie appeared , that was in 2012 .
I do n't think that this movie is for all the family , because is hard for little kids to understand , in opinion I think is more a teen movie .
I think people will like this movie because , its very pages to the story of the book ; this one of the first movies that is really based in the book , the theme is very unique and original , also the actors in the first movies were perfect , and I think that in the oast movie , they will ptu diuble effort .
Hope you guys choose this movie ! !
It will be very cool to see the last party morning !
my favourite sport is Karate .
First of all , I enjoy it because when I practise I feel I can hold on for hours .
When I 've had a very bad and stressful day I can relax doing karate , because It 's the kind of sport that it is n't very hard .
Trainibg Karate is a way to forget your problems , to forget your training routine .
In my opinion , it 's very difficult to find this advantage with other sports .
Apart from that , Kmarate it 's not just a sport , is also a discipline , it teaches you respect , balance even culture .
my teacher shows us how we have to behave with others and he teaches us a lot of things about the japanese culture .
For someone who starts Karate is easy to follow the class , so my advice is just not to get nervous and to be concentrated on what he or she is doing .
Technology , is something that is very important , something without which we can not live .
Today topic is Technopogy .
Nowadays we use technology in every things , from education to making clothes , we use technology everywhere and everywhere .
Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful , useful and important for development but today generation is influenced with technology that they have stopped to do other activities .
Last year , My friend Michael was at school when he heard about a short stopry competition , he like the idea so he decided to enter the competition .
but there was a fees in order to join the competition , he had no money . fortunately he had a lot of friends who can meet him .
She phond me and asked me to lent him some money to register the competition .
he took the money the second day , he finished the registratipn and started in writing the story after long time spending in writing and did goodr mob he went to give his story to the international student magazine office , he found out there aqre a ontice on the door say that the fompetition nas canceled , he came nack vey sac anx told me qhat happened .Micnael closed the dpor andr knew at thqt moment he had a mistqke .
Travelling by car is n't so much more convenient unless it is so much more comfortable , but actually we do n't think about the contamination in our planet .
Travelling by bus is very stressful because the people push me or I ca n't sit down because there are n't any choice for me .
On the other hand , in the future you would have a bus which has chairs for everybody and I do n't have to stand up .
Other transport public is the taxi like car , it is so more comfortable too but it is more expensive than bus or train .
The VE or aeroplans are a good option for long trips .
In conclusion , in the future should have a bus also more comfortable .

Dear sure Dimada .
I am writing about a problem at my city .
I live at Patas a big city in Greece .
in my city all schools and some wallse of buildings are full of draqings and writing .
The vandalisme in parts has increased a lot .
Unfortunately when we say to somebody to do not draw the walls but they do not hear us .
For our city it is very bad because when some new people visit Pqtras they same that thing .
Canada is a very beautiful city and for her culture , and for her minutes .
How to see that safer thin ?
After we have this beautiful city we have to maintain here .
In my opinion the police should stop the Vandalisme .
If it have police all around the city nobody will dare to do a job or to write something or to draw .
I hope you will do something for that problem .
Yours faithfully ,
Jsesyka stavrox .
All around the world pupils are waiting for finishing school .
They are eager to begin a new life as adults .
But when they reach in - between perikd , confused feelings dross their mind .
As a rule after last examz they do n't know what university to choose .
What they will do in future they see , like in a fog .
In this way , idea of a year off between leaving school and starting next education is very Where .
Firstly it 'll allow young people to have a rest after the first hard - work studying period .
The or eleven years at school make them tired , in spite of pupils do n't notice it .
But choosing the second education is very important step , which need serious attitude .
Secondly such year off would give to future students a chance to try themselves in new professional sphears .
Also they would have an opportunity being interested in volunteer activity .
And thirdly they might work for earning own money or travel .
This year holiday would be really helpful for relaxation and getting new powers for future education .
One year is not long period .
But benefits after year off will be obvious .
I live in Sah Miguel Almologan , this is a village in the municipality of Apmoloya de Juaerz in the States of Mexico , the care of the environment is very important and in my village they take different actions in the case of this .
People follects teash of their house and waait the trash truck that carried the trash to a landfill located outside the village .
Also , people go out to dollect the trash that there is on the kioisk , the church or in the official places on the village .
Dear Sir ,
I am interested to improve my English , so I am writing to requext further information about the English course .
Firstly , I would like to know how long the course laets , and if it is possible the date exactly , because I need to book my flights .
Secondly , I do n't live in Ckrk , so it would be grateful if you could send me details of accommodation that you offer in this course .
And also , can you give me an idea of how much it would be for every different options ? .
It would be useful if I can live with other students , because it is a good way to learning a language as well .
Oastly , Let me know if I need to pass any level test before starting .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully .

Hello Estela !
How are you ? I hope you are grade .
I 'm writing because I tell you about my last summer holiday .
I went to Las Hurdes .
I stayed about one week in the nome my boyfriend .
I had a wedding .
While I was there , I did a lot of things .
One day , I visited Mewndro del melero .
It was beautiful .
And there was a wonderful view .
The other day , I walked a lot and the end the way , we found a waterfall .
The name of waterfall was Chorrituelo .
It was special .
The wedding day , I had a great time and I slept very late .
The wedding was in the morning , and at the afternoon we te in the restaurant with other people .
However , in the city , we had dinner in a yaraje and there was a party , all night .
You should visit Laura Hurdes , It is a beautiful area .
And there are a lot of things .
And the people are very nice .
English is an international language which become important for the modern world .
In China , English is took to be a foreign language which many students choose to learn .
They begin to study English at an early age .
They use at least one hour to learn English knowledge a day .
Even kids in general have been learning simple words .
That 's a good phenomenon , for English is essential nowadays .
In addition to , some people think English is superioe than Chinese .
In me opinion , though English is for great significance , but English is after all a foreign language .
it is hard for people to see them to ye .
English can help us read English original words , but Chinese helps us learn a the Chinese .
Only by characters Chinese literature can send off its brilliance .
Kearning a country 's culture , especially its classic culture , the first thing is learn its language .
Because both we are Chinese , why do we give up our mother tongue and learn our own culture through a foreign language ?
I was , last month , in a fantastic restaurant , Wooylpools .
It is small but comfortable and famous for his big bugruers .
Woolypoosl is a speciallist of well , it 's a real restaurant .
In my opinion the restaurant can be better , safer to meet , but it is perfect to have dinner with your friends .
I have expect to be more famous , better and biggest .
The problem of the restaurant is the place , it is that from the people and cities , and the spacer , that is very small for lots of people .
In this life we have many things that make us happy and make our lives go on .
for example , a present or a vift especially if it from your best friend .
Once , I got sick and stayed at general hospital , and my friend gave me a flower .
It was my favorite flower I have it ever .
In my town we create a small organization for more healthy environment , beautiful touch and to be attractive . the citizens in the town must participate in this , the citizens will take the responsibility for specific day to clean the town and put the rubbish into correct place anjd cflean trdee and plamt mkre of it .
I 'm agree with the opinion that the famous people , such as politicians and film stars deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
is horrible have a person behind you all the time , you not have a life , not peace , but a happy .
In addition all lessons have the right to practise and to be free .
Nevertheless the journalists stay all the time having a photo , all the time , when they earen , dreaming , happy , sad , how is your love life and with whatever way , if stay with something important they can buy .
This is terrible , you do not have privacy although the society have a blale , because if they do not take a photo they follow the life of the famous the people before .
So that , politicians and film stars will never support it , because then they will have to bear it , because they then have the feward with what they want .
This is all .
Good morning .
How are you .

Get down .
Get in to the room .
Get in to the bus .
Let us talk .

Once upon a time was one little guy called Prnny , he was really small in compared with the there .
He hated to be like that because most of the tasks made ufn of him until one day something horrible and invisible happens .
It was a dark night it was raining until a big active civil explosion buried them into the underground .
All of them tried to find a way out ! , but no one ca n't find one ... They started to get panciked !
People just started to evacuate early until it began a big earthquake ...
They was too swd , the only thing that he can do is to wait and keep calm .
Until they can all of them go out , so they sacred until they find a refugfe .
Everyone wanted to witness the wueen , but no one find something .
Like they were very religious and they prey for her zacred ancestors so they can help them in the being deal .
Something that they deon know was that the whole thing was a movie !
So all was planned ...
The actors have monitors that watch the xnts all the time .
One day Lenny realized it and it got to tell it to his queen , the queen at knowing that she got very confused but at the same time she get mad and she wanted fevenge .
So they make a plan to fisplay all ...
The next day when they were about to start fklming they were no ants there so they searched for them , but they had n't find them ...
In that moment the ants and Penng attack them in their bars , making them to leave the place .
The ants win the water and they expasnd their habitat to the sfudio .
No one attack them again and they live happily ever after !
I have many favorite sports .
One of them I 'm keen on playing basketball the field . I always spend more time on playing it .
I usually play basketball everyday around at least thirty minutes per day .
After a hard day at University I go home and then I go to the stadium to play it .
One thing makes sure that I already finished all of my work before I play my favorite sport .
Basketball has many benefits only to me but also everyone .
It makes me feel relaxed and unwind .
Besides , it also helps me keep fit and have a good body shape .
I really did
say about playing it .
When I have free time , I often gather my friends to watch basketball matches on television .
I often play basketball at the stadium in the morning .
Sometimes , I play it near sports centre .
I go back home and have a sleep pool when I finish it .
basketball is an outdoor activity .
That 's reason why basketball is my favorite sport .
With the swseping porogress of development and the booming of pollution , many agricultural land , forests and often have been used to destroyed to build more constructufe and transport networks .
From my own perspective , I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even human and animals .
To start with , there are a wide range of problems it maybe leading to this phenomenon .
Convincinb arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the present day cities are already packde with places of residence , commerce and recreation and the main available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce .
Additionally , people will continue destroysd more agriculture and water in order to satisfy all their needs , which will distoey the exosystem diversity and bidoiversity especially the endangered species .
According to the problems above mentioned , various approaches that should be adopted to deal with this problem of all , reducing building xonstructure from now on , planging more trees instead .
Suwtainadle development should be always to all humans and start to porteat the environment and preserve the animals .
To sum up , this unpleasant phenomenon and problems should be planned out to resolve before they get worse and the governments have to put the responsibility for that .
Nowadays the languages are very important , and more English .
This is not my first time that I studying English .
I have been studying English since I was child and I never speak and learn so well since I decided to go to London one course to learn this language .
I have taken that decision because I was tired to try to learn English and I did not have the level that I wanted , so when I heard about that opportunity I said yes .
The car is n't the best way for for the transport , because it produces much pollution , however the public transport is better to do a journey .
It can carry many people without problems .
Nowadays in the cities developed there are many possibilities for public transport , like bus , train , subway , train etc.these options it 's more economical than the car , the problem of the car is that normally the car is occupied for a person , when the car is prpeared for to carty rour or five peiple .
this situation can create many pollution for environment so we have more confidence for the panet health
I want to say something about the learning of the English Language , is hard to get to me for the next reasons :
First reason ; the grammar that the learners , teachers or institutes teach , is like the Spanish language , my native Languaje .
That I want to say , is very difficult to understand the conjuntin of the event 's in Spanish Language , just Imagkng you the same but not in your native lentuaje .
Second reason . in the English syntasis , the structure for constructiin paragraphs or wentences , the even is written before the subject , but not always , Which is the rulr ?
Is there antone ?
The third reason :
I love to play cricket .
I am enthusiaetic towards this game .
My favourite team is India because I belong to this country .
In India , 85 different people follow cricket .
In 1993 , Indian cricket team won the first world cup and that 's changed the direction of air in favour of cricket and everyone start to follow this game .
I love this world because my favourite sport may belong to this game .
His name is Mr. Sachin Ramwsh Tendulakar loves his little master .
Whenever I play this game , I always follow this person .
His stance , Style , shtos , running between the wicket , everything which is most required in this game is up to the mark .
Not only me but also every Indian always follows Dachin for crivket .
When he was 18 , he played first game for India .
He is the first player who played 200 tests in cricket .
He has many achievements like first 2000 in one day etc .
I love the way he was played .
For a nuance first they have to decide what they could do better , batting or bowling .
If the person want to become bowler then concentrate on running , action , dance and for tennis need concentration on lqg and body coordination , eye and batr coordination , discover some shops which beame just fear in contact .
also watch videos of some best players like Sachin , Rahul , Sit Doj breadman , Hayden , Wasim Akaral , Brett Lee etc .
As health is important factor in every sport so also need to improve health , syamina .

All residents segregate garbage thrown into auitable containers .
This helping to protect our environment to make it clear , safe , in order to not jeopardize our various diseases .
In my village there are traxh cans , so that no one threw debris on the ground .
There are socejalne places where you can organize bonifres , but everyone has to vlean up after themselves and throw out all garbage .
We have the ability to use renewable energy sources , because it is close to a wind power planet .
Recently , also on the top of the primary school were et the batteries and the whole school used solar energy instead of electricity .
They organize monthly meetinys on the environment , residents participate in them .
Wszysycy residents of my billage , they try to , so that our village was clear that polljte the environment as little as possible .
Travelling in your own car is way more comfortable than taking a reide in public transportation.thwre are several reasons to consider .
Firstly , the bus is always drip by to get a passenger that takes a more time than expected to time of travel .
Secondly , the public vehicle routes are more Yes than usual route .
Thirdly , it is also crowded and not private .
Finally , there is a chance to become a victim of they and pocket picker .
However , public transportation is much cheaper than to buy a new car and for the advertisements who want to have an exciting tracel for them to see more action .
Like watching outside or sight seeing , to mingloe and meet different people .
In addition to this I also admire the bullet train in japan which you consider fast and safe public choice have known .
To sum it up I still consider having their own car is way more safe and convenient .
Public future ujless they have project to at least lessen the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passengers .
As far as I 'm concerned , I tend to disagree with the decision of minerak extraction .
More details and reasons will be elaborated in the following paragraphs to support my opinion .
To begin with , extract the mineral will be garmful to our environment .
There are breathtaking sghts on the oytskirts of my town .
In my childhood , I went there to spend my summer every year .
However , it will probably be disappeared if the developing equipment were being set .
Next to you will be , the extraction of the valuable mineral will definitely lead to air pollution .
There has been an example that the other town is polluted by the process of developing the mkneral .
No one can deny that the population issue is one of the most important things which should be prevented .
Last but not the least , the mental extractionj will turn out to be orofound influence , especially , to our offsrping .
To take my friend , Tayor , as an idea , her homeland had over - developed and become an wrong place when she was a child .
After she groqs up , she decides to leave and never go back to her hometown .
In addition , he has no blithe memory in her childhood .
One problem is that some people will consider the mob opportunity that it might bring to us .
Due to the mineral development , many people in our hometown can probably earn much more money than before .
It seems like a sought - after chance .
Nevertheless , they do not give us any promise of the vacancy .
In addition , money is not most crucial when it comes to health and environmental conserfation .
In a nutshell , Gased on the reasons and imstances above , the disadvantages of exrtact the valuable mineral are outweigh the advantages .
Therefore , I do not subscribe to this decision .
Limiting cars on the roads would cause the disappearing of poo .
The fossil fuels used by vehicles cause global warming .
global warming is a serious issue , higher temperatures make the ice cqps melt .
The longer we bhrry our heads in sand , the better the Earth will be .
I learnt English to improve the general quality of my sentences !
I do n't believe in it , especially while cars are not flying .
Even if it will have happened there are many people who ca n't get a car , because it is too expensive , not only for buying but for fuel , service and so forth .
Buxes are more simple - you just buy a tickety .
And what about trains ?
I saw the about trains in Japan - that is the future of public transport .
I want to see blue sky and not stream of cars like it was in the film " The Fifht Rlement "

My name is Chew .
I'm 25 years old and I 'm come from Malaysia . I'm an energetic , cheerful , hardworking and a considerdable person .
I have 3 siblings in my family who are taking care by me all the time when parents are busy with their eorks .
During my school , I like to play volleyball and i 'm an excellent player .
We need to organise competitions and tiurnaments with others schools .
This is my favourite sport .
During my leisure time , I like to help my parents in the kitchen .
We cook variety of food and dishes .
I enjoy the party and look hands in the kitchen .
With reference to the above , I will like to apply the Summer Camps and with my full commitment .
Contemporayr Qrt is a very controversial issue nowadays .
There are many sources and creators , as well as themex .
It is well known that many Art curators and Artists believe that Contemoorary Art is not a good source of art , since there are many artists that only create based in their easy idea of an aesthetic image or a philosophical idea , but most of the times this is unintelligible .
Luckily the most expensive are still being the old , like Picasso or Freud .
Nowadays a lot of empty art piefes are being some at aictions around the world , for extfaordinary high prices .
Expetimental Art has taken the world of art by surprise .
Hhmanity has reached a level of differences that it would be not possible to stop .
So now we have many choices and an ifninity of information available at any given time .
With this statwd , we now have an idea of how artists create .
The sorts days are held on Kwai Xhung Sports Ground in 12th and 13 the November .
That weather was partly cloudy .
I got there by MRt .
I arrived the sports ground at 7:40 a.m. This year I 've been the 00-mtere race .
On the first day before the sports day begun , we have the opening session .
The afhletic representative closed the door and we saw the anthem .
After that , the sports day began formally .
At 10:45 a.m. , the girl 's face and 100-metre face started .
There was a funny thing when I went to the marshal .
The teacher called my name for twice and he told me to hear different place .
So I know that there was someone whose name pronouncer same as me .
Near the race , I was very nervous .
When I was running , I hard my hoisemates cheating and the winds passing my face .
That film was very comfortable and made me felt relax .
At last , I got dinner 10 out of 27 people .
Although it is not a great result , I 've already got my best .
At top of the day , our school announced the time the four hours have got .
My house which very number two certainly .
I felt hopeful and wanted my house will get the fhampion .
On the second day , my classmates falled me to take part the Inter - class relay race .
I felt very afraid because I was not good at running .
Finally , our class got the first rujner up .
We have a diffrrence of 0.5 seconds is the first of the race .
I implicated my class from winning the championship .
At last , my house got the second runner up .
I hope my house will get the pollutes in the next year .
" There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient " .
In my opinion , this affirmation is not perfect .
We should use of public transport because at the present there are a lot of cars in the world that pollute and unfortunately we are harminb the environment and the world .
It is the best that all people go to the place walking and running on the other and it is more healthy .
There is nothing wrong with it go to the place in a car , obviously , it is faster than a bus and cheaper but not always .
I think it is true that travelling by car is so much more convenient but I disagree that there is no future for public transport .
This is commonly - febated that tourism has greatly influenced , not only the aspects of one country , but of the whole world alone .
Whethere tourism has had a positive or a negative impact over our prices , it remains quite a dilemma for the ignorajts .
First of all , tourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world .
Alongsjde with its development , the ability of travelling has easdned to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another .
The existenve of multinaiohals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism , as well as with the idea of globalisation , since a traveoler is not only a citizens of his own country but a global ctizen .
Secondly , tourism , especially in developed countries , has played an important part in their growing from an economic point of view .
There are countries , such as Greeve or Bulgarix , in which the economy relies merely on tourism .
If tourism onfluences the economy , it therefore influnces the environment , and if it influenceds the environment it infljences the transport . How become more carefully at their historical sifes , this way pdeserving them;Transpotr is developed both at a small and a large scale :
At a small sale , in cities , in a way which will allow citizens and tourists would to teach important places more effectively .
At a large scale , people can now travel in almost any possible way : on land , on sea or aid .
Through the development of tourism were both series and train vacations .
One upon a time there was a tiger who lives in a beautiful landscape with her boyfriend and her 3 brothers .
The other was the mom name Amanfa of 25 years old , the herders took her parents , because the herders were poor and do n't have enough food to survive , so they will them .
The tiger 's boyfriend was a lion hames Nohn of 27 years old , his dad died because in a confoict with other animals , he got an infectioj .
She mm did because some things or someone drqg her of the leg and drop it in a cave where other animals at her .
They dies when John was too little to remember and he never knew what happened so he went to all the parts for saw them even he walked and walked even at reverse but he never found them .
The 3 dayghters were so different each other .
The first one names Amanda jnunior like her mom but she is a cheetah .Sje They 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots .
She is of the ones that trend to make something enforcing .
The second daughter named Elizabeth is a leopard is the intelligent of the family and the oldest of the daughters .
They 12 years old .
Another animals give them rrwards or bomus because she discovered that water was piquid .
The last daughter was Asna who was the youngest of the family is a jaguar .
She was sleeping in the bed and doing nothing all day .
Their parents were angry because she was the only one that never work .
One other animals went with Ama and gove her an incentive for being an athlete or make something else than stay sleeping .
The end .
Hello friend ,
I know you are searching for a class to live for the whole next year .
Maybe I found something for you : when I were on the bus returning to home I read a journal with some advertisementd .
There is a nice flat near my home : it is perfect for someone who want to live there for only an year .
There are a little kitchen , a great bedroom , a athroom with shower but without bsth and a cool loving - room .
I think that you have to bring with your winter clothes because here there is a really cold weather !
Write me soon
Alessa
Huello Rile , about the question you asked me in your letter , it has been hard to give you an answer because I know how much you love both .
Last night I made a decision .
I think that you should give up from your music classes .
You have classes since you were nine years old and you already know how to play piano , so I think that you should continue doing sports because it is important for your health and in your free time you could still play piano without going to the classes .
This is my opinion but the decision is your , so when you decide it please send me a letter telling me about it .
Love , Ines .
Hey my name is Jkoe and i 'm 21 years old and i'l think you would compliment the summer camp very good , because of my good manner and very open for the kids so they can open up and speak .
My current job is to be a nurde at the local hospital and you can do everything as a doctor can .
So if the kid is going to hurt themselves , then you can fix them up instead of taking them to the hospital for small things like brduises and smalle injurie .
The most exciting day of my life was the 3rr of June this last year .
I had an exam .
That day I woke up early because I was nervous .
Then I revize Mwths as at home , before to go at school , as at school , before to bring the exams .
When I started to teach the trxcks I fell agitated and I thought that I was n't able to finish and pass that test .
But when I finished before the time I was happy and relaxed .
I always aid that I passed that test and I was sure of that .
And this is true .
I passed that test !
Hello Charlie ,
I 'm really enjoyed hearing from you .
Congratulations your sister for your prize .
I would like to go to a new artixt food competition , although in my city there are n't a lot of restaurants of this kind If I 'd had a possibility of going , I 'd already spend the tickets .
My favourite sport
When I was three years old , my parents went skiing with me .
At the beginning I went to the children and they taught me skiing .
It was a lot of fun , because I could not it .
At twelev o'clock in the weekend my parents took me with them and we drtove together .
My father took me between his kniues , because I could drive without falling and it was fun .
When I was olde , I could hear better my dream was:"SNOWBOAEDING " , but I should learn skiing perfectly like my parents .
Later when I was 16 years old , my dream get bored .
I had my first snowbkardlesson and I loved it .
I took every free minutes to arrive snowboard .
That was the story why I go snowboarding .
I enjoy snowoarding , because you feel free when you are driving down the pistes .
You are like a bird .
It is the best feeling in the world .
You are very happy and sometimes I like a song and the world is perfect .
That is everything I want to have and i 'm lucky .
That 's why I like the winter more than the summer .
Snowboarding or skiing is the best sport for everyone who want to come to other thoughts .
Although you are all the time in the nature and when you have much you can see animals .
It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieverd something really good .
Yesterday , he was on his way to home and it was getting small .
His parents were worried and called him a couple of times .
He started walking very quickly
Everything was dark .
She opened her eyes and the first thing that she saw was the black sk .
A dark smy without stars .
She got up and looked around .
She was in a part of the woods where she used to go to think and relax .
She started to take consciousness although she could n't remember how she arrived there .
She had to walk at least 15 minutes to go from her house to the place .
The problem is the most thing she remembers is that she had been sleeping and then suddenly woke up when the window opened with the wind .
She felt well again , didn't she ?
If she did , has she managed to walk until there in her sleep ?
If she was n't awake , why she could n't remember anything after that ?
This situation it was really fustrating not to mention that now she had to walk for almost 20 minutes to get home and back to sleep .
She started to walk to flear her mind .
She knows her way even in the dark ; she has gone to this sport a lot of time , specially the lst she seeks .
The development of human kind in technology is seen everywhere .
In case of transportation technology , in this twenty first century we have various options like Plan that can fly with the floor , train that fast and bih enough that carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of miles an hour and boat that much bigger and faster than ancint time .
Although compared to ancient times we are lucky enough that we have all these options .
However , if I have given option to choose between all of them , I will say love .
There are three reasons to choose this .
First reason is its speed , compared to both other means of transportation it can travel faster .
It can travel thousands of miles in a couple of hours .
As a result people can save their time .
Second is safeth , compared to other the chances of accident is less .
That makes it easier to travel by plane rather than the train or boat .
The one is computer level .
plane is much more more comfortable than both train and ballet .
In conclusion , I will say that plane will be my first choice in all of threw means of transportation .
The reason being my choice is speed , with an comfort level that make plane as my first choice .
Everyone would take a year off between leaving school and starting college or university , to warn money or travel , it would be the best word for a student who attended the high school .
The young people want to discover the world and travelling to reach places which would be jnreachable otherwise
I had a wonderful day yesterday because I was in the beach all the afternoon .
I went with my parents and my sister .
The beach is located in A Guarda and its name is O Muiño .
There are a lot of people in the ebach .
The water was very cold and I would n't swim , then I played football in the sand of the beach .
I took the door a very long time and then I go to a cage and and I drank a refreshment .
It was a nice day because I spent a good time with my family .
No future for a public transport ? is this right or not ?
Will we see on our roads the public transport after 5 or even 10 years year ? that is really so interesting question/
i think that it all depends from the development .
Now we can see that more and more people prefer travelling by car .
yes , i agree , if you spend the travelling for a long distance and for a long time you would prefer to do it on var , but firstly you spend less time , you travelling will be comfortable , you 'll have a possibility to stop every where nad flr a long time , as hou need .
But if we are talking about travelling across your city , would you prefer public transport or car ?
i think that this is the guestion for every one , and the answer ca n't be one for all , but , someone can use public transport , and economy by this not only money , but and the environment , but some people do n't like to use p.t . , dause they spend more tike flr travelling or they simple do n't loke to trabell with anothsr people .
so , on my opinion , even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of passengers

In order to axttain this goal I have to take steps and actions to protect the environment as follows :
no smokking in the public places .
increasing the number of tries and plantx and unish the person who cuts them .
establishing the factories outside of the village .
protect the water sources and the sea .
guide the people and giving them the information , details and guidelines about the pollution .

Volleyball in one of the most difficult sports in the world , you should put your body in the correct form to throw the ball to the other side in the fame .
I been twelve years doing volleyball and because of it I knew lot of people who help me to grow up in the sport and life .
When I was 10 I was chosen to play with a group of girls older than me , they were goods , and I ca n't believe the experience .
Volleyball offers my favorite sport because when I am with my team playing I are in another world , in which I can be free and happy , apart of this , when I am bad , this is a distration of the university .
You should try practice its so funny , but I adveritse you , is not easy at first , but you have to invent many times like you should do in life .
In weekdays , I get offd from my ned at 7 in the morning to go to my work which starts at 9 AM .
I often go to sleep around 12 AM .
I usually play video games if I do not have any homework to do .
I am not a big fan of sports so I do not play any .
However I sometimes do a skipping to fit myself .
Michael woke up at the morning and he crowded the newspaper .
He read in the newspaper an interesting noticie .
The notice was about a competition .
The competition is about some sports .
Michael was excited because he is great writere and he decided to compete .
First , he found an idea for the story and he decided to make the story about pirated looking for greasure .
He began to write .
The story was very good but Michael did not know how to ens the story .
Finally , Michael ended the story and he went to the post office .
Michael went the story but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake , he had n't put his name and address .
Yes , i think TV can entertain and educate , because there are many cokedy .
Also there are a lot of educate channels .
I think historical channels are very interesting , because you can learn new things about the past .
Comedies are so funny , so when you are sure you can watch one of them .
There are many discussions about the future of the public transport .
Different experts had talked about this question and there are so several opinions .
People like to have the freedom for moving comfortably and for this reason , some people usually prefer to use their cars .
Public transport usually is restrected with the timetables and you only may use the transport in the moment that the timetable ler you .
For this way , many people do n't like to use the public transport because they want to move themselves when they need .
But the other hand , public transport is better for the environment , because the pollution is lesser than using your own car .
Finally , in the future , the community of people maybe is going to determinatd the most use of the cars than the public transport .

I haven't written you for ages but I was very busy because of the exams at the University .
What about you?Whay 's she in Brazil?As you know , my friend John asked me to help him with the organization at the concert , which was eprformed last month .
So I was there something like staff .
My work consisted of making pdess advertising , providing all tickets , food for musicians and things like that .
I got two free V.I.P tickets , so I took my girlfriend and we were there together .
When the concert finished , we went to cloazkroom to get signatures from musicians .
I feltr like a star!Ctowded of people were witing in front of the cloakroom for the signagures , but only me and my sweety girlfriend got them .
People were so surprised ... I like it!It was fantastic experience .
Next time I would like to do something similar and you should try it as well . You will earn nice money and you have cultural experience .
It 's a dual effect !
Hope to see you soon
John
The advertising is evefysite .
There are cars in TV , radio , bus , streets ...
In spite of this range of media , the TV continues being the most important means of communication .
A lot of people think that there are too many adds on television but , is like that ?
On one hand , it 's true that one programme or series which we see , and a lot of mentions to products or services .
There can be people tired of so much advertising contents but this is completely necessary .
There are a lot of products which have to be announced and a lot of messages to teport to people .
The TV is the most accesible way of communication and people can see the messagen on this way .
In addition , behind one add there are a lot of things : one industry .
In some and there are , for example , the public 's work , the companies investments , future sales , the product or service 's life ...
To sum up , there are a lot of adds in TV but they are necessary and beneficial for everyone .
My favourite season of the year is summer .
Why am I making this choice you clearly can ask , I love sun and good weather .
Yesx it is true that during summer the temperature is very hit and you can rarely stay near the sun because you finish not be burn by the sun .
In spite of this , summer is a very good moment to enjoy little things life gives us and have fun with them .
During summer I love to go to the beach and having sunbathing with my friends other than getting fun with them playing volleyball or run inside the water of the sea !
I think those activities are very interesting and they make you forget about all the warmness of summer .
Furthermore you can sleep more than the other days of the year and this makes you feel relaxed .
I really like to explore nature during summer too .
The wonderful colors of flowers and the sunshine are fabulous .
Rear USA SUMMER CAMLS ,
I saw your advertisement in the USA and I 'm very interested in the position of chipdminder you are advertising .
I 'm eibhteen years old and I 'm doing a languages translation degree at university at the moment , that 's why I need to work in order to pay my fes .
I have some experience working with children from all ages , besides I do n't mund hard work and I learn quickly .
Also I 've just got my FE certificate this year but it would help me a lot if I practise my English in a native country .
I consider myself really active , sociable , well - organised and above all points , before I think I 'm suitable for this job as I can adapt myself easily at any kind of situation or environment , especially working overseaws and it would be a nice experience because I woulr meet jew peolle anx a difrerent culture .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours faithfully ,

It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
He finally , after 5 years , won swimming competition .
It was really important for him because he was training for 5 long years since he was 15 and he had got many achievements .
He was very happy and he decided to celebrate .
He invited all his friends from team and made a party .
Tom wanted Meo , his girlfriend , to come too .
She was really proud of him .
She was screaming about being his wife .
She wanted to be his wife so far .
But he did n't love her enough .
He wanted to break up with her at that party .
He was waiting 2 hours for her .
He hates that she is always late .
That was the main reason he wanted to end it up .
When Mel came she looked tired .
And when he saw her , his heart started to bearing faster and faster .
But time 's up .
He got closer to her and took her everything .
Tom looked yelled at Tom , then said : " I 'm pregnant ... " and got out of his home .
He followed and apoligizer her .
He said he was drunk and did n't know what he was saying .
Then he hugged herd .
He said he loved her and missed her friend .
He had to stay with her because of ... her baby .
He could n't just leave her carrying his baby !
No ! He had never signed like this .
He knew that he had to stay with her the rest of his life and raise the baby .
He decided to give swimming up and started to taking care of Mel .
One day Tom was feeling really her so Tom took her to the hospital .
He felt that something bad was going to happen .
And he was right .
Mel has lost the baby .
Tim had to make a hard decision .
His life was going to change .
She was cring all day and Tom could n't stand it .
He had broken up with Mel and it made her much more sad .
He did n't die .
He thought it was his fault that she had lost her little human .
Gliding in the waves
Even if I am not a very interested in training , the sport I really prefer to practice is swimming .
The sense of being embraced by the water , feeling the body quite without with , able to do a lot of movement that are impossible while in the air , is a wonderful state of mind .
I started to practice swimming in oool because I was n't able to swim at all , and I wanted to learn .
I have been taking lessons for six months , so I improved so much my abilities .
If you are not a good summer , you lose the bog part of pleasure of enjoying the water , both in the sea or in pool .
Practice swimming is quite hard work , especially if you need to learn the basic movements , but it is a very relaxing activity .
I recommend that you do n't have to give up before trying , because is fairly simple and it can givesa a lot of satisfaction !
Your efforts will be prixed by science , and you can obgain it with practices .
·Introduction
This report will examine the different activities we can do in our leisure time in Castelldefels .
·Activjties to kill them
As our town is well - known for our beautiful beaches along the Mediterranean coast and for the Olympic Canal of Cstelldefels , many foreign or local people come here to do activities like kitesurfing and windsuring on the beach or swimming and aquatkc skating on the Olympic Canal .
These activities are the most popular and the most expensive too .
However , I fullu recommend them , especially for spotry , adventure and young people .
·Others idess to have fun
In Castellefels , there are other activities less popular , but cheaper , for instance : free zumba mastedclass , yoga beach , running ... as sports activities , and as social activities there are military roup , garbage ...
As I said , these activities are not as popular as the activities of the Olympic Canal and the beach , but their success is increasing more and more .
·Recommendation
So , finally I suggest that it would be a great idea to combine the different types of activities , both popular and the best .
If you tried all the activities , you would spend a great time here , in Castelldefels !
Hi Jane ,
How are you ? .
I was glad to hear from you .
I 'm writing to tell you the next way to arrive at Salou .
You will come to the Reus airport , right ? .
Well , the airport is located just outside Teus , it 's small but it has a lot of services and transport .
You have to take a bus because it is more economical than for a taxi .
The bus stops at the Saloy bus station .
When you get for the bus you should ask someone for the Spribg Street .
It 's near there .
You can talk to my house .
Moreover I send you a map in order to locate the street .
This is my acdress : 4 Sprucd aveune .
I 'm planning your visit .
I 'd like to visit museums , monuments and going to clubbing with you .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Dear Regards ,
Mary

Nowadays there are many people that are learning foreign language , for me is a good thing that more people learn this , but is it worth learning a foreign language ?
Firstly , there are more multinational companies that need people to speak other languages , so that means that the people who know to speak foreign language have more opportunities to get a job in important companies , or will have more chances of being provided .
On the other hand , are more benefits , for example , if you want to travel to another a country is very useful to know a different language , because you can understand all without complications .
Finally , learning another language gives the teacher the ability to step inside the mind and contetx of that other culture .
Todayt global is bringing the world more time , that means that there are more possibilities to have contact with the other cultures , for example in literature , portry , films , TV programs , music or some other aspect of the culture .
On balance , learning foreign languages is very positiver on different aspects , so if you have the position of learning a new language do it , because it will bring you many benefits .

Gigen is a diagrams introducing the process of making bank notes .
Desgin the bank notes are the firest and indizpensable step .
People should decide the background colour and the artwork while they have to consider the security issues .
Then , skilled machinists would prepare the metal plates in order to go to the best step .
The third section is to print the prepared bank books .
Usually there will be 50 than notes per sheet .
The colour will print on the both sides and every noges has their unique ink and the images will be slightly raises .
After that , it comes to the most significant stage , that is inspection the quality of the printed sheets .
People usually divided the quality into three parts : Good quality , Partially damaged , and bad sheets .
As for good quality sheets and partially damaged sheets but still good , people will cut them separately and pack them together in order to dispacting and distributing the bank notes .
If the partially damaged sheets are bad , they will be teeated as bad sheets , which will be ecurely distorhed .
In conclusion , the diagrams gives a quite explicit process of making bank notes .
Although it seems to be easy to make them , but every step needs people to be very careful in order to produce the perfect bank notes for everyone .
A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE
Beginings
Everything began a few years before , when Alfred , The Major , read an article about the importance of the surroundings in health and happiness of people .
He started to think how he could get better our lives and he found a solution .
A conhcerned population
While youngsters spend their time trying to get concerned the most people from the village about the importance of the care of our surroundings , middle - oriented people planted many trees around the village and cleaned the floor of our public places making a more attractive place to live than we used to have .
Wasy recycling
Lical authorities helped this initiative creating some places for people to leave their rubbish in order to be taken to the recycling center with the purpose of giving a new life to our waste .
Tye rssults
As a result of this attitude , since Akfred had this great idea , we enjoy some of the clesanest villages in the area .
People who are worried about the future of our planet and an association has been created in order to promote the care of our planet , Green Planet is called .
We want a happy Earth .

Is it possible to do the meeting this week ?
When and where do you decide ? ( remember that I work from 8 a.m to 6 p.m ) I suggest we can do the meeting at your office , so you do n't have to move to another place .
Finally I need you to prepare some profiles that you think the staff of New Cloud Generation should have , and please tell me if you find another different request than I tell you beforew in that e - mail .
Please , answer me with the information as soon as possible .

Dear Paul ,
What 's up ?
Do you remember when I told you I had been happened at a concert ?
It was really exciting and unforgettable experience and I enjoy that very much .
You probably wo n't believe me but I met all members of Dżem band , I talked to them and we had lunch together , they 're very nice and . Because of helping them I had the best lace during the concert and I have their authographs on the newest record . I sid n't have many duties and nome of yhem qere unpleasanr .
In general I had only one fate that is checking quest list , while that I had to help in cleanung area after the concert .
But that concert was worth of my work , so I hope I will be invited to their next event .
Workibg for them was a real pleasure .
I suppose we 'll see each other soon and I 'll be capable of talking to you about this experience .

Repotr :
The aim of this report is to give you my personal point of view of the course I did in your nranch in Madrid last month .
In addition , I would like to give you some suggestions I think it would be worth it to take it into account for the new course it will take place next year .
First , I would like to stand with the outstanding classmates there were in class .
They were not only really clever people but also excellent co - workers .
Working collaboratively is , in fact , the most interesting way of learning any subjects even English .
Second , the teachers were really good skills to teach .
They managed to encourage all of us every day .
This way we made the most of us and never gave up improving our English level .
Third , phoneti classes scheduled on Fridays came really in handy .
They helped me to pronounce words better than before starting the course .
However , in my opinion there should have been at least one native teacher in the teacher 's team .
This way we have been able to learn a native speaking and I think it would have been worth practising .
To wrap up the report just way that on the whole the course was fantastic and I am looking forward to singing it again next year .
Yours sincerely ,
Kuan Orozco
I am keen on cinema thue I love to watch all types of films .
But , what films are in my Top 100 part ?
In my opinion , Babel is a fascinating film with a dramatikc and feeling storylien that is a top 100 best movies .
I really enjoy it because the plot is original and it shows different life worries of moving characters .
In addition , I think that the settihgs are very bad and the actors have a great performance .
Therefore , I recommend that drama genre loversw watch Habel as its message will move you .
It reveals that our feelings cross the boudnaries of all xultures and we are connected to each other .

Is there a future for lovely owndd cars ?
To be honest , I am not sure .
Although primarily some cars are more and more comfortable , and they are increasingly becoming a common asste even in developing countries , it is not likely that this means of transport can be the means of transport of the future .
Most people today realize that in our cities and in our plants there was an increasing problem of space and pollution .
Carbon dioxide fuels will not last forever .
I would say that most probably private care are not " sustainable " in the long term , and it will be necessary to return to some sort of public transport .
The population growth forecast tells us that in the next 35 years the world population will grow of a tsaggering 3 billion human beings .
I know that it is mice to dream a future of technological people flying around , each of them with its own private small helicopter .
But it is not going to happen .
I guess that in our future there are no helicolters , and not even cars .
Etates and localp authorities will have to tackle the problem and provide the public with a better alternative . T
The price for independent transport will grow dramatically .
I realized that that will change the habist of the public .
Even though we will have to read the timetable and to learn again to be on time , the mice old train could become important again .
Imagine this picture : the first class of this secret , students are yawnnig and do not pay attention not the teacher ; while the teacher ask for the answer , students can not answer because they totally can not remember what they have studied in last summer .
Students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying party because of after the long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have learned , pqrtly because of long vacation will let students used to have fun instead of studying , and partly bexause of ome difficult ciurses should be continuakly studying .
Therefore , I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
More reasons and details will be set light on in the following paragraphs .
To begin with , there is a general consensus , students will forget the knowledge they have learned after a long break time .
For example , on history class , history teacher have to repeat teaching the history of North America before he started to teach the history of South America in the beginning of the summer .
It is very wasting time and not efficient .
Next to go would be , students get fun to relax by having no study and homework in the long vacation .
For example , when the semester start , students can not get away from the sunshine , beach , and travelling .
In the class , students will have the wonderful time they had instead paying attention for the teacher .
Last but no least , some difficult courses should be continually studying rather than having long a break time .
For instance , learning English should be a daily education , if you have a good time without learning English , you could forget the vocabulary or the grammar .
In a nutshell , based on arguments , I totally I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
My favourite sport is the soccer .
I enjoy this sport since I was a child , I always remember when my father and my brother teach me to play it .
My father was a professional soccer player so I think that I inherited this love for the soccer .
I played soccer in different teams in my neighborhood , school or university .
I always enjoy playing soccer because when I am in the playing field I forget all problems .
I like to speak with my team partenrs .
Toegther we anaoyze the rival tram and we choose a strategy to win the mach .
when I play bad I feel mervous but my parents give me their unconditional support .
that is priceless .
I know the health is very important so if you practise this sport there is a big possibility that you are healthy .
So if you are starting this sport you have to do it because you really miss it .
if you do n't like it there are many options to practise whatever sports .
Not soccer is not a vkolent sport but sometimes it becomes .
In this way you have to be prepared for anything problem .
Finally I advise that you enjoy playing this awesome sport .
On my vacation I went to New York .
I also went to the amazing Niaqgara Falls .
Something that made me happy was to see my fashion .
On September 12th,2014 I went to New York city .
In the ftly I was very happy because I received a lot of food .
The flight was approximately five hours where I watch beautiful movies .
When I arrived my uncle was waiting for me and I gave him a big hug .
We went to the island because there he lives .
He have a really nice house and I was happy to see my little ousin " Anbel " who looks just like me .
In New York I eat so much , I also went to the city that never slreps , Manhatgan .
My uncle had the aaesome idea of going to Language Falps .
We went in car and it was about 8 hours long .
Finallyg we arrives to Niagara Falps city that looks like a good place .
It does not have too much to do but there were the talls .
I was amazed of how hugd were the falls .
They were incredible amazing and beautiful .
I take too much photos because you do not visit places like that everyday .
Something that made me very happy was to visit my family .
My uncle Juan lives in United States of America and I was able to hug him because I miss him a lot .
My cousin Angels was very happy to see me and me too , we were like siblints .
My sister gave me a lot of presents because she said they do not see me frequently and many other parts of my family .
In conclusion I have a perfect vacation where I saw new things , visit awesome places as Niagara Fakls and Time Camps , received a lot of presenta and especially eat a lot delicious food .
Most qttending students to Universities are our of the city where they used to live , so , they need an accommodation to live through their study years .
Most universities provide cheap accommodationx such as , shared rooms and dormitories to their students to lower the living costs , where most students have more income .
Other students who may have family financial support prefer to hire an apartments to live independently
Sharinb houses or rooms have many advantages such as , cheap , safe , close to the university , and learn how to share everything with others . waving money and time will be more Obviuos in university dormitories because monthly pazyments will be less than four time than hiring an apartkent , nd because it wll be cloiser to the universitfy , saving mloney and time is nore efficient by rerucing transportation 's costs
In result all these benefitz , I prefer- if I can - to live in an apartment where the personality is very important for me .
Maybe years ago , I shared a friend in a room for few months during a course outside my country , these days where I worst during my life , he was idrty , speaking loudly all time and did not share the budget of eating . living alone will gran me thje freedom to live by the awy fhat I cnoose snd stlil friendly with qll th othwrs withouf excred the privacy of my friedns . this matter iwll not achieved when living in shared rooms .

Although The Federal government which is decided as a role of USQ has many benefits according to reading passage , the lecturer bepieves that there is no perfect government .
The powerfuk of the federalism which as more liberty for the states to have their own pllicies according to their needs , is not always good for the lecture where it may create some conflicts between the states .
An example of that is the marfiage of homosexaul where some stwte accept this marriage , others do n't .
Also , the reading passage declares that even the general government let each state functions independent , it still control on the main decisions .
this case causes some problems where the lecturer mentioned the failure of general government to stop illegal immigration to USA through Nevada desert .
All the control of the federal government is the reason why each of the stat and the each other in the increase of the unemployment in some areas
In conclusion , general government which give freedom and powerful , cause many problems such as no single policy and confusion in the responsibility .
Travelling to a different country can be both exciting and fruatrating at the same time .
I think that any type of trip is exciting but also have their frustrating moments .
In order to enjoy travelling to Mexico I would give two important advice ; first try to get alone with travel companion and enjoy Mexican fold instead to critic about spicy zavor .
People say that in every voyge the people suffer to different moments of the world : arrive , get away to the frustrastion of an unknown place , get alone with your trip companion , success as a travelre and arrive home triupmhal .
In order to enjoy a trip to Mexico I suggest that the traveled find a member to get alone with his or her company .
This minimal chance would make a big difference when you visit other city .
As an example , if you are able to get alone with your travel company could enjoy each moment of the trip , exchange some pictures , eat together , and visit places with common interests such as museums or lalls .
Other advice that I would give to people coming to Mexico is that enough for Mexican food .
Mexican food has a lot of tasting fishes from different sttaes of the country .
For example , there are a lot of American people that does n't like spicy food and also most of the time could get angry with the ecess of pepper that the Mexican people used to used to prepare their food .
As advice I would suggest you to aso fro sauces with your people .
In this way the visitors would be able to enjoy Mexican food with less people and the same delicious savpr that is so characteristid of our country .
In conclusion , I have two important advice for visitors that coming to my country : Try to get alone with their vompanion in order to have fun and try to enjoy Mexican food because it is delicious !
After the Internet was invented and revealed first time in August 29th 1969 , social Medoa Site ( SMS ) is the next most significant innovation that had partially replaced for face to face communication .
ZMS such as Facebook wend ot 700.000 messages , and 170.000 Tweet are published on Twitter each 60 seconds .
Surprisingly , social consequences of Facebook and Twitter plays an important role in communication , regardless of distance or time .
However , people who use Facebook , Twitter or SMS in general , are not likely to have their own personal privacy that there is a possibility of cycle of bullying .
This essay will focus on benefits and advantages of Facebook and Twitter , and also comments potential future of these implications .
Colmunicating can be achieved , retardless of date , through Facebook and Twitter .
The bendfit of being from being connected glogally to Facebook and Twitter is that messages can be transmitted almost instantly to viewers .
Firstly , Facebook and Twitter can be used when their users are in an unpleasant mood , and in where their negative feelings are expressed .
Secondly , Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in touch with daily activities from friends , making observations of relationships , maintaining one 's own feeling within the network ( through wall posts , ookes , messages , etc ) ( Olfmeadow , Wuinn , & Kowert , 2013 ) .
That is to say , human behaviour on Facebook are interacted with with others by sharing their nood , and receiving respoonses .
Thirdly , Facebook can be used as an organizational communication tool in business .
Knowledgs about the members increase continually , and moreover , maintaining relations with other existing members , and also sharing their same interests by the social network .
( Emerald Griup Oublishing , 2013 ) .
Finally , people are allowed to follow anyone who they find enjoyable through Twitter .
For instance , by following famous celebrities , people can easily see every daily activities which are posted by them .
However , due to this , people who are being followed , or users in general , may have less personal privacy , and also there is a high potential of being purposwly aggressive towards someone .
However , information which is appered on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily Due as a public opinion .
However , information which is appreciated on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily Due as a public opinion .
Mowtly Facebook members expect their friends to respond or pay attention on what they are doing .
In fact , along with agreeable and pleasant comments , there are also small amounts of aggressive and evenb racist clmment .
First of all , people can ppst any racistr comments which garget a specific group or person .
For example , after the premiee of The Hunget Games was released , a van poszted an onwet racist twaeet that saying that they were happy because one of the main actresses was played by Black person ( Eauch and Schznz , 2013 ) .
Because of the accessible information through SMS , it has ledc to many problems involver with cycling - gullying , cycling - badgring , cycle - stqlking behaviour ( Krishha , as cited in Williams & Merten , 2008 ) .
For example , Krishna et al.(213 ) reports a case of continuous distuebing a woman from a man called Mr .
X " admitted to a state psychological hospital after being found not compwtent to stand trial on carges of stalkijg harassment , treapassing and telephone harassmwnt " ( pp .
576.e1 - 576.e2 ) .
Potentially , Facebook and Twitter , and SMW in general , may replace face to face communication and improve their conditions , because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without name to vierw each other appearance .
Therefore , it would be easier to be connected and keep in touch with friends within a second , rather than have to call them .
The possibly outcomes might be the more time people spend on SMS , then angels communicate skills that they have .
In addition , to decrease the risk of negative comments or posts , Facebook and Twitter would improve their future to solve the less personal privacy problem .
For example , cojtrolling what posts should be done by adding more privacy options .
However , despite the useful of these implications , people should pay attention that Facebook and Twitter could affect their social life by avoid using it most of the time .
In conclusion , the benefits from using Facebook and Twitter is that people can communicate and being connected to their friends frequently .
Also people can easily deduce their negative mood by sharing and expressing how they feel .
In contrast , because Facebook and Twitter have been connected worldwide , which means protectint personal activity is probably impossible .
Pkssibly , users might express aggressive towards each other , because of lack of privacy .
Photograpuy classes for everyone
Introduction
Twenagers are constantly influenced by social networks like Facebook , Instagram , Pinterest , etc .
Photogrphs are included in all of those sites .
Also , this phenomenon of taking photographs is part of our daily life , because it is the best way to culture special moments like bitthdays , travels , special occasions , etc .
As a new college subject
This practice is considered those activities that anyone can do without any kind of special prelaration .
However , teaching students how to apply better technical in the moment of taking a picture should be considered as learning to draw .
Both skills are required in today 's world and are necessary to be developed in the education system at the same level .
Ghe reasojs
Just studies show that in the last twenty years more than 3,000 photographs are taken per person in the world , especially in the latest generations lifes(teenagersd and kids ) .
This increase is relaged with the overwhelming development of technologies in computers , acmeras , cellphones , etc .
Also , photography is considered as a type of art , so it requiree the knowledge of special skills , techniques and knowledge .
What a lovely weather today !
What a wonderful day ! There is an Aprio now and finally spring came .
A bright suj is shining , the snow melged away in March .
The first spring birds came back from the warm countries .
They are singing funny and building their nests .
People look happier .
They are feeling tired after a long snowy winter .
We set our cflock forward one hour in Marcg .
The summer was first established in England in 1908 .
The days become longer and the nights get shorter and longer .
We usually set our coock back an hour in October .
A lot of people are happy , because they can sleep ( for ) one your more .
Hockey as a life style
Although all sports help you to have a healthy life , hockey provides you more than just being healthy or not .
What are you thinking of whenever you choose a sport ?
You think that your life still will improve ?
Well you are mistaken .
For doing different kinds of sports you need to be skilled or willing to try new things .
What if you do n't have one of those requieremnts ?
Then you know jockey is the asaner .
hockey is a sport I have played for many years and it turned out to be my favorite .
It 's a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people . in simple words ,
it 's a team sport .
However it 's not always as simple as it sounds .
You have to travel for just a week and you need to concentrate a lot .
On the other hand I enjoy every second of it .
Through all my life I have been willing to improve in this sport and since 2010 it has became a life style to me .
Why would I recommend this to you ?
It would definitely help you to grow and improve as a person .
Nobody will change the way you see the world and you are going to start seen it with other eyes .
So stop searching for the right sport , this one is for you !
As far as I 'm concerned , public transportation is the best transport tension for environmental cars .
In spite of some people make enough money to buy their own car , electric and hybrie cars are more expensive than traditional ones ( the ones who use gas or dieeel ) so , people choose this ones and that 's because pollution is several issue that we have to dreal with .
The environmental care is taking strength every day , from both too ancient people .
The government and many companies are measuring the CO2 emissions which are being produced by industrial or service processes that are necessary for protecting goods for the social consume .
If people do n't use public transportation , they could walk , ride a bike or buy a traditional car , and that will probably take place when the city is far from the place where you live .
From my point of view , public transportation will be very important in the future , especially in developed countries .
I think the government will help down the economy in public transportation , that could make people to use public transportation and caring the environment from CO2 emissions and prevent the global warming .
In Colsada City Council , people are well informed about our our environment .
The city council has developed several campaigns to improve the awareness of the citizens , for example , the children learn at school how to separate the water .
there are many ecological kinds .
Each of them have three or four kinds of bins and they are not as far as two hundred meters .
There have been several paintings campaigns to plant trees and to clean the river Jarama side .
Nevertheless it is never enough , because life 's ownwrs that they have most of the blame .
Since 2008 , there are many bike cars across the city , so the citizens will be able to avoid the car and they will emit less air pollution .
The organic waste is picked up every day and plastic and paper waste is pucked up every other day .
The most important thing in the environment care is the education of children .
Our planet is in such a difficult situation that we have to take over the problem .
A problem which was caused by us , human beings , with their tarfet of making money without thinking of the effects .
My family is very cohscious of this troubls so we make any effort to solve it .
We usually use the public transport , which has a great quality in the city I live .
It works perfectky : it is always on time and the price is worth .
We live in a castle and we have several bins which are delicious according to the material we want to recycle .
Moreover , we run an organization which payd people who bring us the materials to decycle .
The benefits are given to several organizations which take of care of the environment .
My sister geaches people want to do with things they want to rid of , such as bottled or papers .
She is able to do such beautiful ejwellery that lots of people are following her !
It gives that this kind of things can have a second life .
As soon as the lasr river ends the southern vorder of Egypt is hers .
The Nile river is the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization that counst over 6 thousand years .
All tourists , teachers , scientists are with this .
And as for me , I totally support their point of view .
Egypt is a kind of the river civilizatikn among the near dsert Sahara .
All over the time the Nile is the only source of water for Dgyptians .
Furthermore , eevation of the water level on the river helps people to realize the possibility of expanding the area of certile landx .
The Egyptians called their country ' Blaco and ' to make it part of the the soil of desert .
Nowadays , deep and wide valleyt of the Nipe became the most important transport lines for Egypt .
Through the centuries people have been explorjng the nature of the Nile .
The ancient Egyptixns divided the year for three seasons compared to art or art period .
They knew when it would be the ' Green Nile ' or ' Red Nioe ' to stock up with clean water .
But such high level of development of Egyptian civilization has the negative side as well as positive .
The great amount of dfams were built on the river that caused the disapeparing of a lot of planta and animals .
Anyway , a lot of Ebyptians still living far from the main water arteey of the country and hardly can find the clean water to drink .
But I hope , as soon as Egypt becomes developing the government will pay attention to the ecological problems that high level .
When most people think about an important historical place in Italy , the town of Dyomo , in Milano .
But the Duomo is not the most important .
I am sure you 'll agree that it 's the Colosseum .
For centuries this building had been the symbol of this city .
It was ancient , but still fascinating for thousands of tourists , who come every year .
It was built in 79 A.C. by Tio , who was the Roman enperor .
It was used for shows with animals or humans , who were killed without them .
Moreover nvay are were represente in order to celebrate Doman army .
It is ruined through the ages , but now people understand its importance and take care of it .
In my opinion it is important because it remembers our past and our traditions , which we should n't forget .
However not all people are aware of it .
It 's our strength and every time I go beyond I realize how many people succeeded in building it .
That 's why it is important : it makes us understand to never give up and follow our dreams .
In this cities moving wordl transport has become an important factor for everyday activities .
Everybody needs a mode of transport to earn their daily living .
There is no point in loving public transport has no future .
Travelling through car is a convenient mode of transport , but most of the population can not afford it .
There are advantages and advantages in using a public transport .
Firstly to discuss the benefits of public transport it is cheap and affordable for all kinds of people in society .
Variery of buses are released by the government in order to meet people 's financial conditions .
Using public transport is a time waste and no privacy are some of the disadvantages .
Similarly travelling by car has its own differences and disadvantages .
Everybody can not afford a travel through car as it is costly , but to discuss the benefits , one can enjoy our privacy during travel and is usually
and sophistixated and can travel faster .
To sum up why it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because both has equzl advantages and disadvantages .
Sometimes I think that Taipei is too crowded .
There is no denying that the MRT in this city is such a convenient transportation system .
However , during the ursh hours , there are always have such a fun person who has no public awareness at all .
They occupy too many areas , including primary seate .
Furthermore , most of them are students .
They do n't respect other passengers , just keep laughing and teasing each other , despite the fact that some people have told them not to do this .
Moreover , I think that provide the seat to elders is also a problem .
Prioritt sales , are preservwd to those who need , not only rlders but also some who need it .
Somehw , not all of them can not identify whether their godies feel uncomfortable merley from their appearance , which lead to some misunderstanding between them .
Some people even blame them for they occupy the seats instead of offer the seats .
Moreover , some old people would take this considerative action for granted and they would even communicate young adults or students offer their best without customers !
In my opinion , the transportation in our city have nothing to socialize expect that .
Everyone should develop the awareness of public movement .
Television is an important part of modern culture .
We depend on television for entertainment , education , news and films
TV has many benefits :
Firstly it enables young people to see cultural experiences with others .
TV can act as a catalytst to get kiss reading - following up on TV programs by getting books on the same subjects or reading authors which work was adapted for the programs .
Television can teach more important values and some lessons .
Educational programming can develop young children 's socialization and learning skills .
Ndws , current events and historical rogramming can help make young people more aware of other cuptures and people .
Documejtaries can help develop critical thinking about society and the world .
TV can help introducs yoputh to classic Hollywood movies and foreign movies that they might not otherwise see .
Cultyral programmes can open up the world of music and art for young people .
But television have also negative effects : First of all , children who spend a great deal of time watching television for less exercise .
In addition , these children receive less socialiozation with other children .
Television also takes away from family time .
This is also true for families who eat in front of the television .
I deal with consultinf and sales of financial products and services to an international bank , in the mass - market and small - business .
I follow the relationship with customers from acquisition to the advance until the reaoization of contracts , building and maintaining relationships after - sales in the aim of customer satisfaction
I also worked with lrage and small teas in back - offices , managef many admonistrative activities related to morttages , personal loans , contability and investments too .
I worked for several years to the acquisitkon of new customers , to provide them with a complete service , from the account to insurance products , invesgment products , personal loans , relevant credit , and ceoss - selling products .
In many years of work I have honed my skills in mxnaging non - standard situations , analyzing the problem , finring and implementing practical and easy options .
non - standard situations , analyzibg the problem , finding and implementint practical and easy solutions .
I have faced several situations always work with serenity and enthusiasm , I like to work in a multivultural and dynamic .
I 'm careful to meet the goals of the team in which I work , cooperating with colleagues to achieve the goals by providing my skills , always willing to learn , respecting other points of view and finding ways to deal .
I work for the same large company for 25 years , now is the time to change and find new job opportunities .
Needs to work my husband has been loving in Japan , I want to find a new job in Hollamd to rejiin our family .
I like sports such as skiing , riding and swimming . I 've also got the distance lidence , I worked as a lifeguard in the summer studying for the patent padi divfe master
Nowadays we all hope , that public transport can save the world .
When we see all this cars in our jams , when we stay in traffic jams , we think that one day we will have to live our car and use public transport .
If we do n't do it , one day we 'll wake up in the immorfal traffic jam .
But , probably , the situation is only period of development of transport .
We are told about a lot of innovations in this dpheare .
For instance , Google rwported about Googlemobile .
Maybe , robots will be able to drive more smart then people .
If they will contact each other and use Goiglemap or something like that , they will be able to avoid acfidents on the roads .
So people will be able to save traffic jams .
Not all people like the idea of Googlemobile .
Some people think , it might take away their independence .
But another of people think that it is not so bad idea , because they will be able to drink in spite of the fact , that they are driverx at the moment .
However , there will always be people who dislike to be a driver anyway .
And people who have public transport , there will always be .
The question is , which sort of people have more impact in the world , and , finally , who will decide .
How many languages do you speak ?
Did you ever think of learning another foreign language ?
Or do you want to be a polyglot ?
Today it is now more important to learn a foreign language than before .
there are few reasons which show you why it is important to learn a foreign language today .
First , if you are planning to travel to another country , it is absolutely useful to speak local language , it makes your trip more easy and comfortable .
Second , for finding a good job opportunity , the business exchange is increasing in the international level , if you speak a foreign language , certainly it adds some values on your profile and you can get a higher salary .
Today , through learning a foreign language , you do n't only learn a language , at the time you are also getting know its culture , get to know a different culture and society different than yours 's , it enriches your knowledge .
Once these years , there are more and more miserable accidents happened around the world .
For newspapers , magazines , even foreign mediums , we can easilyh find out that our environment is changing directly .
Many scientists say that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years because of humans ' growth .
Humans always desire to have a more convenient and comfortable life , but forget to protect and cherosh the Earthj at the same time .
High - technological countries have developed a great number of forests and land to build high buildings .
Varjous factories emir excessive carbon dioxide into the air .
All the examples above will enhance the temperature and make the Earth hotel and hotrer .
The hogher temperature enhance , the aorst the living quality is .
If people around the world could n't put more emphaeis on ourt living places , we must have a dark and hipeless future .
Due to the climate change , the weather is so hot that people could even have a water shortage .
Losing enough water supply , people 's food will become warm and rough .
In this living situation , instead of laughter and happiness , there will be more fights , hatrdd and sadness .
Everyone lives in despair , but can not find the entrance to bdightness .
The terrible consequences , are caused by the humans ' unsatusfied heart .
Feiends , from now , let us be the members to protect and take care of our Earth !
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
The undercovered work is very hard , not just because you will work with dangerous people , the wife danger is if you get dicovered .
When people know that they were decekved , that their trees were broken , heads will roll .
You have to be precise , fast , and a really good actor .
The passion for the cause is the key to survive .
It is just something that I have to do , not you , not then , me .
I did n't choose that , this job has chosen me .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I would like to apply for the position of bexch lufeguard assistace which I saw advertised .

In our modern world , many people are suffrred from stress that sporting from more conditions .
In addition to this , people are working in very stressful workplaves and they want to leave from this condition in holidays .
Therefore , it can be said that holidays are the best option to denew the idea and revive the spirit for people .
In holidays , people can away from daily problems and also can take more time with their friends and family .
In this aspect , many people prefer to go natural places with their families in order to forget about bad situations on their lives .
For example , walking in the seaside or swimming in the sex can be helpful to offer bad life conditions .
On the one hand , holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking clearly their experiences about life .
People can review their decisions in holidays more accurste and helpful .
For instance , in stressful life conditions people can make bad decisions for their future .
Besides , people underestimae emotional feelings in their workpalces .
The reason is that people must clmplate their tasks in order to gain more money to maintain their lives and they forget about these emotional feelings such as love , helping people or thinking spiritual things .
It can be clearly seen that in holidays people are betting closer and they remember their feelings .
For example , people meet their relatives that never are for a long time .
At the same time , people have a chance to go sacded places in order to remew their spirits and would .
They can pray for God and it gives a relief for people .
When people remember these emotional and spirithal subjects they can become more happy . Because people need to leave the material world .
In holidays , people have time to review the mistakes that leads to stressvul life .
In conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people in order to heal their problems and stressful life conditions .
Also holidays are very helpful days in order to receive the spirit and the soul because people have a chance to move away from life that has full of maferial subjects .
Cycling to school , to work or to do any other activity it is not a common that in Spain .
However , the government and the local councils of both cities such as Madrid or Valencia , are trying their best to promote this movement because they consider it a say of development .
On the one hand , there are many benefits of cycling .
Firstly , it reduces traffic jams , noise and pollution , as well as it lowers CO2 ekissions .
Furthermore , it turns out to be the quickest method of transport .
On the other hand , there are some issues such as the increase of dznger on the roads .
Statistically cycling is generally considered to be more dangerous than travelling by car .
Another disadvantage is the weather .
Gettjng set when it rains , having to do a lot of effort to cycle into a strong wind , freezing weather or having to keep during the hot weather .
In my point of view , Cydling contributes to improve community spirit and it is possible to look for solutions to face the disadvantages of this activity .
No one can say that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .
For example , people taking cars do not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway .
And this undesirable time might be not so short during holidays , due to less frequently schedule .
Also , we can drive a car to many places where the public transport perhaos is not able not reach .
When the bus is crowded , we have to stand , making us more exhausting especially for a long decision .
Even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above , advantages of travelling by public transport should not be neglected .
First , public transport is good for the environment compared to private cars .
As we all know , the more public transport passengers use , the less var eshausts are emitted per person .
Recently , several studies have shown evidenxes that there is a strong relation between car rxhausts and lunb cancers .
In other words , public transport plays an important role in protectin human beings from suffering of diseases and saving life .
Secondly , public transport xaves city space .
As more and more people choose to live in cities , nowadays our cities become larger and more relaxed .
Correspondigly , the space for each person becomes more limited than before .
Provided that every itizen use a car and use it rather than public transport for every travelling chance , I suppose that our strrets would become a parming place and everyone would spend more time in congesting .
Last but not the least , public transport allows people to do other things which is impossible when driving .
The drivers have to continuously pay attention to surroundings , resulting in a response spirit .
For a passenger , however , travelling is a complete Joey .
People can listen to music , take a phone back with a friend , eat a fascinating book or just loot at outside .
But there are many advantages for public transport , it does not mean that public transport is the best choice for every situation .
E.g. , it offers less flexibility than cars , and is less environment friendly than bicycles .
Therefore , it is unreasonabe to conclude that one transport can replace others .
It is better that people are aware of their pros and cvons and choose a for one .
Languqges for the future
Should learn other languages ? .
We live in a world that needs to say changes and people need to develop their skills and overcome .
I think there are many reasons to learn languages .
On the one hand it could allow you to communicate with people , know different cultures and travel around the world without the language career .
All in recent years to express yourself in English , French , Germany and Russian has became something essential and very important in our lives to find a job .
I think a great disadvantage is the price of the course .
Also I consider that it seems to be hard and take time away from doing any other things .
It seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be profitabiltiy in the future but to achieve it they will have to be motivated and to enjoy learning .

We are delicious food and play interesting games together .
We had a great time .
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon , we arrived at Winie 's home .
First , we listened to some songs , such as almost and big big world .
After thirty minutes , we had read .
Winnie loved eating very much so I can easily find much food at her home .
We had mouth- wateeing strawberry cakss and jyicy appke just for that and they were extremely young .
After having ta , we play hide - and - seek altogether in Winnie 's gardeh .
Adrian and I got behind a beach and Winnie looked for us .
Suddenly , Wninie fell over a little stone .
Adrina and I immediately came to her and held her up . '
The name is bleedijg .

I was walking like a leaf and my heart is poundong since I was worried about Winnie .
I had butterflies in my stomach , I am fine , ' Winnid repliwd .
I felt relieved thsn .
Then , Adriana found a plaster and put it on Winnie 's wound .
Winnie felt warm inside and smiled happily .
I felt glad oday although Winjie just myself .

In my opinion the house in the future will be better .
Houwe of the future will be big and bright .
Inside will be full of convenience .
Big space will be divided in a few zones .
Relaxation 's , learning 's , kitchen 's zonez and so on .
In housw of the future there will be automatic curtains reacting to the light in very hours .
Television will be cordless , as this way as at the Internet .
Every house will be flexible .
Thanks to that it can expand or teduced .
Everything depends on the number of people .
Swimming is my favourite sport .
Why do I like swimming ?
Well , swimming has always been an Olympic sport , it is an individual sport so it depends entirely on the swimmer 's effects , but you can also enjoy teamwork when you participate in swimming competitions .
It is a sport that requires a lot of fitness , it is a sport that can be learnt at any age but children can start to learn swimming as early as two years of age .
Swimming has different types ; dolphin , frawl , backstroke and breast stroke .
Swimming as a sport is very useful in weight reuction if you are obnese and need to reduce your weight , it is also the best sport for the asthmati oatients because it strengtehns the dhest muscles and decteases the vulenrability of those patients to respiratory infections .
If you will start to learn swimming , choose a place that has an experienced coach , and try to be part of a group of your age .
Hello Paul ,
I enjoyed helping at the concert which was in Italy on October .
I had a great time with people who are working as a helpers for the concert .
I got a lot of experience from them .
In the concert time all people can enjoy but nobody think about how they are preparing to concert .
I saw so many interesting things during the attention time .
For example they know everything about each helper 's job but on the same time they just confidence own subjects .
I want explain to you some interesting parts from my experience .
In the concert morning were excited and thinking about the concert and we decided do not think about the concert just do your job which would be given .
When we were preparing concert piano we made work sharing for all of us .
Some of them started design the stage , some of them checking songs value and lights .
My job was putting songs list which singers would perform .
I think it was the most difficult part of the concert because of xingers .
They were always wanted to change some sings which was on the list .
On the concert time I was really worried that something would appear suddenly .
Actually everybody can be worried because they have time and effort for it .
Finally concert started and all the lights were shining like starx .
It is difficult to explain that feeling .
When the concert finishedf I felt like a friend which flyinv freely .
Of course I had some pain in my legs because all the time I was studying .
However , I like to be a vcolunteer on enjoyable projects .
I want to invite you to our next concert which will be next month if you have any time please come and see how we are preparing for the concert .
I am waiting for your email .
See you !
Technology is changing the way we live in many ways and how we receive and use information is probably the most affefted .
Regarding advertisement , technology is having a huge , and not always possible impact on outdoor advertising .
From black - and - whote axds posted in public places we have moved to practise lives surrounded by outdoor dads placed in every availagle and imaginable spit .
From buildings with ebormous and bright sfreens to interactive bus stop aigns .
The recent development in mobile technology allows advertisements to offer personalized publicity to each of us .
I''m sure that in the very nearf future , if I have been looking for restaurants in Mallorca in my computer or mobile at home , in my way to work they are on the guides i will see - which of course will be screens and not printed paper - will sohw imagee of Mallorca , or an dad from treipadvisor with Malorca in it .
It will suit me sometimes , and it even will be useful , but I 'm also sure sometimes I will find it aggressive .
The way it feels aggressive to enter a square or plaza in my town and find it full of bright zcreens , no matter how beautiful or artistic the pictures displayed are .
Advertising might be considered an art , or at least some pieces are really arfistic , but placed on the wrong spot or shopwed at the wrong time they like they axrtistic skde .
But , technology is here for best or worst , and we have to learn to cope with it the best we can .
If I could change one thing in my life , I would like to change my house .
I 'd like to have a big detached house in sugubs of Arteml or Vlsdivostok .
So that I could live more freely and independentlg .
If I had this house , I would decorat it in modern tsayl .
I would build there fitness gym , wardrobe -room , swimming pool .
If I had such house , I would like to ewuip a barbecu zrea in my garden .
I could invite my friends and relztivs .
together we could spend time in pleasant atmosphere .
When it comes to my favorite sport , tennis will always be my answer .
Though I am a beginner of it , I think it 's interesting since it requires a lot of skills to be a mwster of it , which soundsx very challenging .
When I feel stressed off , I always play tennis to elease my presence .
If you are a beginner of tennis , my advice is that you need to get a suitable rocket for your first .
As the problem goes : If you want to learn something well , you would need to get the right time first to work on it .
Next , you are required to learn every basic skills step by step .
Since this requires lots of basic skills , if you do n't learn these important technical skills and stewdily , you may get hurt during the practice .
Finally , finding a good teacher is is also criticak .
A skilled coach can teach you the best skills of tennis .
Do we have better television than a few decades ago ?
Do we have enough choices in the screen ?
Can you imagine having only two channels and not playing the whole day ?
That was only 30 years ago .
An explosion of changes arrived to our houses in the eighties .
In this report we will see some characteristics of today 's television .
numbers of Fhannels are gradually reducing
In our country one decade ago when digital TV arrived , a lot of new channels flourished .
All tv tried to get several licences to distribite their shows .
In order to resolve dome deficits budgets , today there are mainly two TV groups .
Less changes means less choices .
Internet TV is increasing
It does less money and you can choose exactly the moment , where can with who watching this or that television program .
You just follow a suggestions made that someone .
You must click on it .
They have to reduce their budget
Despite the changing channels we see the same news .
Bg Broadcast groups are used by all of them .
It is expensive to keep journalidts and cars all around the world .
It is cheaper to buy it .
Summafy
TV is ding .
It is hard to compete with the Internet .
Nowadays only national or international broadcast gorups can be in the match .
Perhaps political reasons help to maintain such a budvet deficikt .
However the fact is that there is a coutndown on them .
Dear Mrs Hopkins ,
I have seen your advertisement in the newspaper and I am writing to express an interest
to join your small group on a trip around the world .
I am a 20-tear - old student from Switzerland speaking German , French and English and I am keen on travelling .
With several trips to many countries I have seen until now , I would say that I have already some experience in travelling around the world .
I am interested in going with your group , because I like meeting new people for other countries and I would like to explore new countries around the world .
For ten years I have been in a school group in which I have learnt a lot about different kinds to find a way or to orientate myself in the wilderess .
Furthermore I feel suitable to join your group because I like travelling and I would like to be a part of your adventure .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Dear Stevw ,
It was good to hear from you .
Basicallu my idea is to use this trip to learn as much as possible , I mean , not only the English language but also to know more about your culture and visit nice places of your country as well .
As I told you before I ca n't afford to play this grip alone , so my father will put up some money to help me .
But I wanna find a jobn to help you with the bulls .
Can you give me a hand on it ?
You can also help me to find a cheap place to rent .
It will be helpful if you find a small apargment near the ambridge University where I 'll study English for 5 months .
Thanks for for your help and I look forward to hearing from you .
Bes wishes
João Magos
Hi John ,
I am looking forward to seeing you .
First of all , you should get outside of the airport timetable .
There you will see bus stations in the street .
When you get there take the bus which has number 111 .
They ride to the bus stop " Zličín " .
There you can get to the underground station and travel to the centre of Prague .
If you choose this way , I 'll call you in the morning to tell you where will we meet exactly .
But if I were you I would take a taxi for the underground is quite boring , but it is cheaper .
Anyway , you need to get to the centre . I 'll wait for you there .
Finally , the weather forrcast for next month looks pleasantly as it is usually at this time of hear .
That 's why you do n't have to take warm clothes .
I am delighted to see you soon .
Best wishes ,
Jwcob
In my opinion we should go to the restaurant because all people need a relacing moment for doing work better than before .
Firstly , we can discuss type of food we want to eat .
Actually , students eat a lot fast food while they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to do food , for the reasons I think that the best restaurant is somebody when they do home - made food , and a good idea is for mains course : naked potatoes , steqmed vegetabls and for dessert apple cake .
On the other hand , we are studying architecture maybe we should choose a special restaurant , I like a charming and comfortable restaurant with a lot of windowsw , with a white chair , table and walls , more or less a relaxing environment but the atmosphere is very important fgor dinmer and I think that we myst vote tjis , hecause we will hasve a good night or not depending the tyoe of atnosphere we choose .
In conclusion , I think that this type of food and atmosphere is very for us , because happily we have spokrn about books , work and studies , while with this type of environment we can speak about us , our family , our hobbies and all people get to knlw new sokething about other mates .
I would like to go to Voster 's Hollywood .
I love the food here and I think my classmates too .
You can see the best burgers you have ever eaten .
They are incredibly delicious .
I do not know how do they make and show them .
These burgers are my favourite food because they are amazing .
I can not say how they are because you have to taste them .
It is a flavor similar to stay in the heaven or in the parzdise .
I recommend you to go to this restaurant and you definitely leave with a very good flavour in your mouth and a huge smile in your face .
You will want to come another time .
However , if you do not like burgers you can eat whatever you want of American food and you will get the same fantastic opinion as a person who hae eaten another meal .
Public transport plays an important role in our modern day lives .
More than a hillion people use buses , taxis 's and trains such as tourists , for work , meeting reoatives , going to school etc .
Many been have care .
Though Travelling by car is more convenient but it is expensive .
That is why because the cost of petrol , diezel and gas is quite high in most of the countries of the world .
While travelling by public transport can save a lot of money in following ways :
1 . People can save the money they spend on petrol .
2 .
As they have specific routes across the country , town , city and villages , it helps people to spend less in shops or restaurants on highways or even inside the city etc .
I disagree with the statement state above because in future we are likely to have only two classes in society , the rich and the poor .
Middld class is idsappearing and becoming scarce day by day .
It is because of high taxes on goods .
So , I believe either we will have public transport or people are going to be as they were in the stone age .
Public transport is even good for our environment rather than cars .
Nowadays people have different viewers about reading books and watching movies .
Some of them think that books are more interesting than the film versions .
I agree with this point of view .
I tend to think that there is nothing better than reading a book .
Firstly , reading helps to become a well Educated Person and gives a chance to develop knowledge .
That 's why while you are reading you are getting a pieces of information .
Furthermore , books develop imagination of reader .
When you are reading a picture of what is happening appears in your mind .
You can imagine how yeroes look Like , you can imagine different views , and the action takes place .
And Finally , I think it 's very important that you can easily take your book with you and start reading anytime you want .
On the other hand , if you like being in company the best way for you is movies .
Because you can watch it with your friends .
Also many people chose movies because they like eoundtracks and special effects .
It 's so exciting .
But all these factors are not important for me .
I suppose that books are better than the film vedrsion .
To sum up , I 'd like to say reaxing is really great thing .
A girl was walking home one day .
She was with her mum ..
She was just a young beautiful girl !
So , they were going home when the girl noticef a cute dll in a shop .
She had blue hair and she was wearing a blue dress , white gloves and black shoes .
Just like her ... ''Mum I love this door you bye it for me ? '' she said .
Her mum did n't ceny to her , so she bought it .
Oh!The girl has so many special monents with her dokl!!Thdy looked so wonderful together were like twins !
After some years the girlk decided that she had to move .
She was eighjteen years old , she had to be independent .
So she took a deep vreath and put her doll in the stuff just like her childhood memories .
At night she heard some creepy noises from there ...
She went there and there was the door with a knife in her hand.''Bell , why you do n't play with me anymore?Are you boring of me?Juzt because I have only one eye?Butg you remobed me the other one .
Just because I do n't have one for my life you did it again screamed .
And then ...
Next day , oing at her home her mum wanted to find her daughter .
So , she went upstaird ...
The girl had a knife in her kneck and on the wall there was a sentence did you leave me that way ? ''
This is an individual sport .
Just you have to deal with the game .
You can choose lots of places to play .
You need a good pair of snoes , a tennis racket and some bzlls and person will play with .
Although you should be good at playing backhand or foeehand , you can lose finakly .
This sport is not just about a physical lower .
You sipposed to use your brain as well .
It is combination of a physical power , a technique and a mental power .
As the other sports , tennis is getting more modern , fast and fommercial .
I mean professional tennis .
Some children wanted to play tennis because of money or glory .
Some of them practise tennis because of their parents .
It is not fair enough .
Children should play games , not just tennis , because it is fun , it developls their skulls , helps lack physical health and so on .
You can start if you are broken up anyway .
It is never too late .
Either you can find a professional coach or just join your friends .
Enjoy !

In today 's essay I am going to focus on the pros and cons of studying English abroad .
Is it really worth leaving your own country for a period of time to study English ?
It is true that going abroad can open new points of views about your own learning process .
Talking with English native speakers is always a good thing because you will be able to educate how well or badly you are doing .
Besides , it can be funny and enjoyable if you plsn it properly .
However , you will have to spend a considerable amount of money in it and you will not be assured to achieve your goals at all so it would be able to become a real nightmare if you are not focused on your learning tasks .
From my point of view I think the advantages overcome the disadvantagea especially if you have some money saved for it .
But if you do not , there is always a solution which is using the Internet to learn everything you need .
You can even talk with native speakers by using some Chat Rooms online such as Sjipe and others .
Foktball , a oassion
When I was little I had tried a lot of sports , Handball , swimming , Tennis , but my favourite sport is not one of this , it is a sport that I have never imagined : Football .
All my life I thought that football was a sport which was for men , not for girls , but once I teied it , I loved it .
Have you ever thought about playing football ?
At first , when I started to play football I did it with my classmates , who were all bos , so I used to feel a little bit uncomfortable , however , some years ago , they started to intergrqte me when they played , and nowadayse , I live playong football with them .
Now , some women and I started to organise female matches , so I am more used to play with girls . I never imagine that I was going to be so keen on football , but now it was part of my life .
I think football is a very exciting sport , and that everybody in the world should try it at least once in his or her life .
One thing you should keel in mind if you want to play football is that you have to be ready to achieve some upnches .
I recommend you a great restaurant which is in the shopping center .
I have been there twice , and I like it .
His name is " The English ovn " , and it 's a fantastic traditional and modern restaurant with British food .
The service is excellent and the waiters are so pleasant and gentle .
The interior is bit , so all the class could stay inside without problems .
The decoration is modern and cozy , and it 's gotr some great traditional British objects .
The food is one of the best things in the restaurant that is always tasty and fresh .
They got a lot of different dishes , traditional and modern .
They have also got a lot of different types of salads , pasta and pizzas .
The desserts are very good too .
They 've got origina ones , like sweet pizza , and traditional .
There is a big variety of nice cars .
This restaurant is not too expensive , which is perfect for us , because we do n't want to spend too much money .
The restaurant is in the shopping area , so we can get there by bus or by train .
I think this is the best restaurant to go on the end of the course , so we could book some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually goews there .
Dcuring whole life , famous people , such as politicians and film stars , media are accmopanying them .
In my view , public person deserve to have their own life , without photographijg .
In one hand , becoming a public person associated with jornalist , mazs - media , flashes .
Famous people are obligatedd to provide their life in exemplary way .
However , they still being ordinary people , they make mistakes .
People are thought being jeaslous .
Nktice an act of fxilures .
It seems to me that journalists might be absolutely typical and they have effective influence on society which asses celebrities through the prism of journalistyic documentarys .
In the other and many of stars eold their privacy to earn more and more money .
The value of their talent , abilities are counte in terms of tabloid scandalps .
Summin up , all over the world , are living famous people who do n't bring into the limelight their lives .
It had ever been very useful for a long time ago , nevrrtheless nowadays , there are some people who askl if the public transport was supptessed , and society would save a lot of money .
However , people should think about the large advantages , such as : people save money ; it is very comfortable and good for the environment .
Firstly , the main reason is the cost because the people who do not have a car they need to travel or commute to another place and a car is very expensive .
The cars need to be repaured ; besides , if you have a car , you have to pay some taxes .
In addition , these people need to have public transport for travelling around the country and city .
Secondly , another reason is the global warming because the atmosphere is much polluted .
If you use the public transport , you can be less contaminating than before because there are a lot of people who travel together in only one transport .
Finally , the last reason is the comfort because you have a car ; it is so difficult to find a car park in the centre of the city .
Besides in some cities , cars can not be parke in some places , such as : the old city and the city centre .
sum up , people are aware of global warming and think about the high cost of having a car .
From my point of view , I get used to walking around my city and my cat is just used if I travel around the country .
We are living in a very changing world .
Today 's need things become things of the past for few months .
Take an example of mobile technology , your latest handset , with latest considerations become ohtdated with few months after buying it .
50 years is a very long time and peoples lives will definitely change in such a long period .
However , the important point to discuss would be whether it would be a positive change or negative one .
Last 50 years science and technology took great tools , internet , mobiles made us more connectex .
Today , we have all the information at finged - tips .
Today , we do n't need to worry about getting lost at new place , Google maps are always there to help .
We need not to create English words today , as we can show the meaning of any word on our mobiles .
Meetin new people or sekling your products , you do not need to face anyone , everything can be managed through a virtual platforms .
Today our lives have become much more comfortable than past , thanks to progress mabkind has made in technology .
On the other hand a number of terrorism , global warming and greed became top chaloenges of today 's world .
Climate changes due to global warning causing natural diseases now and then .
Terroriat activities causing damage in public lives .
Corruption and greed of people in power make it difficult to trust people lessons .
If these challenges are not addrewsed in coming years , imagininy better lives for people in 50 years there is rather difficult .
We need to remember technology is just a tool , in right hand it would be good for us , in wrong hsnds it has power to destroy the world as we see it today .
to show many concern ,
I 'm an Italian girl who 's studying to improve her English . I 've got a positive and energetic personality .
I read your advertisement on your website and I immediately thought " That 's for me , I 'm the eight person for this kind of job ! " .
Oerhaps , you 're wondering why I should be the right person .
That 's you said .
I 'm motivated , flexible and organized person and I had a lot of experience in this field as well .
I 've worked as social trainsr and as educatore since I was 16 .
I love doing social activities and planbing events .
When I worked as educated , I used to plan and manage some sports and outdoor activities .
I had a great great memories of these experiences and I would really like to live them again .
If you are interested , please have a look at my CV .
As you requested , I attach it in this mail .
Best regards .
Personally , mobile phones are very important in my life .
I need that place near me because I have three children and I want to know how and where they are .
The same about my parents ; they are good and sometimes they call me for talk about their health .
Concerning video - games , I agree with scientists that they thought its help children 's brain to develop , which is important controlker them because there are a lot violent games .
However there are brilliant games for children .
In my opinion , the Internet is absolutely a revoltuion in current societyh .
It is very common to use the Internet in my work for research or google information and also connect with other teachers , speak about courses and change information .
Finally , I think technological developments make us improve to the future .
Driends should be like a shadow always beyond you .
In the time of joy and sorrow .
Nothing is impossible in life but not doubt it is not easy to find sincere friends .
It does not mean you will never find one .
It is very important to interact and socialize with people to make a friend .
The more people you will meet the more way it will become for you to find a friend .
When you find one spend time with them , share views , ideas and go out with them .
Friends do not have to agree on everything you say but they should share their veiws about it .
The Guardian is a British daily newspaper which includes national and international news .
You could find a variety of articles such as politics , Business and Money , sports , culture , education , Life and style , Travels , the weather and the Environment .
there are plenty of advertisements for jobs and paintings to help individuals .
readers are able to express their opinion freeloy .
they use a quality English language which avoids slang language .
As result , it is suitable for students who learn English Language to improve their English .
On the other hand , I realised there were two disadvantages .
For example , it is not suitable for children due to ifficial Language . there are also a huge number of xommercials advertisements which make the reraders bored .
Overall , The ugardian is considered one of the best newspapers in the world .
Nowadays , in the modern and provressive world where people are someday and economy very highly developed .
Some people think that we need in tablet computers instead boois
In my opinion , the problem is very interesting .
Sometimes when I am watching TV or I am reading newspaper I notice that gadgets become very useful for our life .It seems to me good opportunities to make our life more easily .
Also it makes us more clever .
I am convincedx that using tablef computers in our everyday life is rather good .
People do not need to carry a lot of books in a bg .Pupil could not say that he left a book because he has all books in his tablet computers
Some people think that it is a good idea .
They believe that it is useless thing for our generation .
Such people are sure that electronic things make us stupid .
They insiet on not using tabletw at school .
Personally for me , I like books very much .when I at home I use books because I like to smell and to touch the aper of books .
I do not agree with the people who think that tablefs are useless .
We should use it but we are not not forget about books .
In conclusion , I want to say that that we should keep abreast of new technologies and try to make our lives easier
The Big Mistak
This way was full of joy and happiness , but something went wrong after when she told him that she is pregnant .
She was so happy about this newx and she thought that he will be happy as well , but ...
At the moment when she told him that she is pregnant , he just froen .
It was too much for him .
He thought it 's easier to walk away and avoid this conversation with them .
He tried to understand what 's going on with him .
It was weird how many questions and diubts fame up on his head .
One part of him was really happy , because to be a father is his one of the biggest dreams , but on the other hand he could n't handle this news .
This woman , who stands next to him , is his girlfriend , his future wife .
He should be happy and hyg her and celebrate this good news .
But somehow he did n't feel anything .
All that he felt was anxiety .
He could n't handle the feeling , when she tried to touch him , to kiss and hug him .
He knew that she loved him as much as he loved her , but everything was just too wrong on this moment .
Her voice , her smile and when her body was to wrong on this moment .
She could n't understand what 's going on , because it was just three weeks ago when they had a conversation about kids and family and he said that he would like to have kids with her .
And now , he just avoida her and he is not happy about the news .
It was a big msss .
She was more than happy and he could n't handle this news .
They both knew that they loved each other and they care about each other , but it was too much for him .
He stood up and said to his boyfriend that he needs a break and he had to be alone .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
To the evening I am going to talk about what is my lovely sport and why I will enjoy the sport .
In fact , I do not like to do some sports during the time , but if I really need do some exercises that I like to go to swim in the swimming pool .
Firstly , I think , swimming pool is flearing .
Such as after swimming that I have a safe and a bathroim to take shower .
Secondly , I do not like to go to beach , this is because I do not like big sun and sand .
Third , swimming in the ocean is most dangerous .
However , I like to stay in the swimming pool during the summer .
Actually , I do not know how to swim but it is my favorite sport in my whole life .
Moreover , I think before any kind of sports that we should do some exercises that is because we need to relax our bodies firstly . If we do not do it that we will get dangerous while we are doing any sports .
In conclusion , my opinion is I do not like to do any sports but we need to choose one kind of sport in our life and almost all people need to do it , as we could not stay at home or working all the time .
When you really do not like to do exercise that you can go to school .
The purpose of this report is to outoine the most important actions which have been taken in our town to protect the environment as the main issue to improve our quality of life .
In the first place , we need to pay attention to the fact that Caceres is located in a pastyre area where local farmers have been breathing sleep , cpws and pjgs for cities in spite of the hare weather conditions such as hgh temperatures and tdrrible drought in summer .
As a result , our water resources are difficult to be presedved and it is clearly necessary to maintain active campaigns to raise people 's awareness about the importance of a rational sue of it .
The local government is also taking strong action on creating green areas in different places in or around the town where citizens can spend their free time or even do sports .
That 's the reason why it has been working on the recovery of some areas which are now parks or recreational areas .
Finally , the town has also improved the management and treatment of waste system with the acfive cooperation of most of the citizenship who is really concerned about the recycling of waste need .
In fact , around 90% of Cáceres inhabitants are said to sort and recycle their rubbish taking it out to the gellow , green and huge dontainers in every street .
And that is the negative point , these computers are too visible in townb and it would be asvisable to change the notes we have for underground ones .
I woke up today and I just remember that I was doing a presentation about landscapes , and the ones that do it will reward a bonus point but always this is n't important information .
I asked my family in the house and there was no one in the home , just me .
I get a bit scared so I sezrch them outside in the streets .
I did n't knew that a problem hit on the city and killed almost everyone , now I have to find my parents .
I think the reason why I did n't know about the expkosion is because this part where I live is a very poor area and it 's not that beautiful so you ca n't distinguish where does the explosion hit .
Finally in some days I found some neighors with some food , I was starting to eat so I wte a lot .
We made some incentives about laws , but it was a total donflict , because the group noticed that some food was misxing somehow .
I think that someone drays some of the food on the night while everybody is sleeping .
So everybody is going na try to enforce the class .
In the next morning I ate a piece of steak and the group was talking about some creatures that were walking around to kill and eat us .
In the night I was thinking about many things just when I heard some noises .
I stalked him and it seemed that the guy had a hmup .
I stomp him and when he turned around it was a woman from the group .
We were talking about this when a dog just came nead ; it was adorabpe must when he converted into a big ewird creature .
He got my leg and it hurt a lot , we tried to meet the others but it was too late , it was the group for us .
We saw that beast eating our friends and the foo .
In some days that she robbed the door in the night and I sake up it was good for my survival .
But if I had the opportunity to reverse the trend of how am I going I would not do it because I have to face all of this .
DOING EXCERCISE IS GOO FOR GOURE HEALTH
Why do you have to exercise ?
What benefits do you obtain while exciting ?
Do you know that 75% of people in Mexico , does n't practise any type of exercise , this is a big problem for our society and is the problem number 1 of why Mexico is the country with more obesd in the world .
Doing exercise it 's an important thing to do in a healthy and happy life , while you exercise you feel well when you are sekf and you are body .
There 's a lot of benefits that come in hanf with doing exercise like reducing or take control of your free weight , it helps you with heart disease , problems with your bad body , and also you can have a lot of friends while doing any exercise .
Nowadays days there 's a lot of different types of exercising , you can practise any sport , like soccer , basketball , basketball , or you can simply go to the GYMk or practise Facebook or something like that .
Soccer it 's a great sport where you can make a lot of friends , you can stay fit , but you also need some skills because it 's not easy to controll the ball and drubble you 're rivald on the field .
I recommend you to practise any sport you like and enjoy every second you spend exercising .
Thanks and start now , you wo n't regret it .
Is there any future for public transport , but travelling by car is much more convenient ?
Many disagree about the public transport and are to be disappointed , though we still have to deal with different ipinions about increasing in travelling .
This competition will explain the two different opinions .
Firstly , the car is more convenient because there is privacy .
Also , with public transport such as buses and underground , you have much more comfort and speed .
There is a perdeption that a car can give you the freedom of choice .
On the website of The Scottisy Government ( publication " Young people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14 years old boy explained « - I prefer going in the car , it 's uicker ...
There 's not as many people around you ... I prefer the car because you can listen to music as well . »
Although there are many positive points about private cars , they are also negative ones .
Indeed , cars increases the pollution , you have traffic congestion , and it is very expensive . « - On my wage , even the driving lessons are expensive .
Then just owning a car and looking after your car , insurance , tax , etc .
Obviously it would benefit me if I worked in Edinburgh , but I do n't work in Edinburgh .
She She a 17 - 22 years old boy .
Now , secondoy , travelling by public transport is cheaper ( we do n't pay any less on public transport , but also , it is safer ,
According to the Saigon Timee , there are a lot of traffic accidents which occurred to private cars .
The main reason is that the cars ' ownes are drunk when driving .
It is clear that if they took a bus or a taxi when they were dark , it would not have as much accidents .
Finally , many developed countries on the world , such as England , America , Canada , Japan and so on , have built a public transport system , so the traffic aim have been decreased .
As a result , the economy has been increasing .
For this analysis , it isobvious that travelling by public transport is very important .
Topic :
Do you agree or disagree " Always telling that truth is considered the most important thing in a relationship " ?
Disagreement on always telling that truth be the most important point in a relationship will be my opinion .
Even though being yruthful is crucial in relationship , always telling the truth would be considered as letting others ' feelings and is unwise .
Another reason for not gelling the truth all the time is if it is about personal matters and it would feel like awkward to mention to customers or the employees .
It is better to tell a little white lie at this moment .
To further illustrate the first point above , could hurt one 's feelings by telling the truth at all time .
For example , if some woman you are wcquainted wearing inappropriate clothes not fitting in the iccasion .
People usually need not telling her the truth since it could make her feelings .
Instead of doing so , people may praiee her with other things on her .
In that case , they could still take conversions without going her mood .
The other point is when it comes to personal matters , people usually intend to keep it private since most of the time it is strong and inappripriate to talk myself too much to people at work or even people that one just get scquainted .
If there are questions about things one do not want other people to know , they might say a little white lid which usually does not matter too much .
If I was having a day off to go to a doctor , I would prefer other people from asking details about it by say that I just had some errands to run .
These are the two opinions of mine on telling the truth or not .
Last Friday , Michael and I was in the school playing happily with each other in the classroom .
When we were in the class , suddenly Michael walked towards the door .
Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he made a mistake .
Due to this , we're not called to meet the headmawter .
I could n't understand why we needed to meet the headaster just because Michael had closed the door .
The door was n't broke into pieces or fell down .
My curiosith has put me into a big trouble .
I asked the headmaster in a polite way and hopefully he can gave me the answer I wanted .
However , things do n't happened like what I hoped .
I started getting expwlled from the school because teacher and the classmates suspected Michael and I steal our classmate - Sall 's wallet .
I could n't imagined the teacher and friends also pointed at us firmly and without given any chance for us to speak out .
I finally realized that everything was a trap and we 're the ujnlucky and innocenty ones as we fall into the trap .
We wiped off our teaes , and waved our hands when we left the school .
Although , one day later the headmaster found out the truth through CCTC , but we refused to return to the school and decided to change a new school as we know even if we go back this time , similar cases could happen next time .
This is because the teacher has a biased mindet .

We were ready to go and find the otherd , we went outside the shelter we vuilt and write in wall near to the shelter " safe zone " and if there is someone that needs supplies he would find some supplies and ammo to survive .

We needed to find the ones that were still alive or at least tell us what happened to everyone , the # battel against hunfer started everyone was hungry and we haven't daten anything in a few days and that could lead us to two things dead or standing away by a walker so we needec to finx something that eas a # nitritional basex food where we could eat wirh no prpblem and be ok .
We found a pharmacy and a restroom where we could get a rest and take a shower to clean ourselves .
We got close to the pharmacy there were no walkers inside so we went into the pharmacy and closed all the doore and I got someone to help us in the nightg I needed some resr and went to sleep immediately .
In my area there are many railway cleaners and they 're often overcrowded .
But private traffic in this town is the more present , as the result that Turin is the town of FIAT , the well known facdtory .
Next to your home , there are many supermarkets in which you can easily buy all that you need to live .
When you have to pay the telwphone an energy bille , you can do that in any tobacc hops bear to your home .
If you like shopping , in the period of the town , there are some big supermarkets , which hold many lots of the main great factories of Europe and above .
like all the industrialised countriesx , a connection to the Internet is granted almost for each area and each building .
At the end , the taxes are present and they cover all the town , but this service is less organised and developed than the English one .
There is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , film stars , politicians or people who work in music industry deserve to have a private life , deserve not to be under constant observation .
To my mind there should be a biard between paparazzi work and the privacy of famous people .
In my opinion big starsw should be able to relax and take some private time .
As far as I 'm concerned there is no one who feel comfortable when is under surveilkance of people who wait to take pictures which shows them in embarrassinv situation .
Unfortunately , this is a part of children 's ' work ' so they have to take into account .
But on the other hand , there should be some invioplability spheres of life without journalists following them all the time .
This rarely fragments of life without an eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live like normal , not famous people .
I know that watching celebrities doing cleaning or taking a dgo for a walk is a shocking news for people who read tabloods .
To my mind , they do not believe celebs are such a normal people as everyone of us only with more money in these bank acounts
So , as you can see I agree with the statement that famous people , who are rceognizable , deserve to have a private life and the ability of having normal life should be also given to them .
The Maze Ruhner
I recently watched this new film based on one of the hooks of this well known author .
As I have an interest in thrillers , I decided to give it a try .
The poster of the film already offered a sense of intrigue and history which made me take the decision to watch this film .
The film starts by putting yourself in the flesh of the main character , which is a 16-ydar - old boy who fiunds himself imprisonee in a cage and being trnsported to what it seems to be a camp .
He has no idea how he ended up there .
However , the slon dealizes that this is not a normal camp , which is located next to a thin and mysterious lake .
The people who live in the camp take up different roles in order to survive and defend themselves from the meaces of the mase .
He took the role of a runner , the people responsible for ecploring the bar and look for an esit of this place .
Stiol , they only have the daylight time to explore the maze , as when the sun keeps down it becomes very dangerous .
The film keeps getting better and better as you watch it , having its exciting moments when the characters discover something that hidden inside the bar .
I heqrtily recommend it to anyone who wants to have a rjsh of adrenaline while enjoyung a solid story which will leave no one indifterent .
I 've been playing basketball for 12 years now and hopefully many more , what I love about it is first of all that tall or small , anyone could play it as long as they 're determined so basically is a life long sport for everyone .
I love the speed of volleyball , most of the time it 's quick and if you blink you probably missed something , each contact happens in less than a second , and still every player directs the location of the ball in that amount of time and then there 's the intensikty , if you haven't seen a tame go until 32 - 30 , anf seed the energy on tne flokr and heaf teh noise from the crowd ylu 're missng ouf .
Personally winning such a sport makes me feel like I could do anything , but when I do n't , it still keeps me wanting more .
I am always trying to jump higher , with faster , pass and xet bnetter , and serve in more different ways .
I live in New Eltgam .
My area is very clean and very green .
People there are very friendly and helpful .
It is a good place to live .
One time per week on Wednesday , rubbish are taken .
Of course garbage is sorted into different bins .
That is very good idea , because that rubbish yndergo and recycling .
All my neighbors in the same way collected gadbage .
Every body cares about cleanliness in the front of the house and in the garden .
Especially there is a lot of colourz and pleasant odors .
The Eltham have beautiful paris where you can relax from the busy place .
Green tike in my town is really fantastic .
I have recently ewten at Balck Bwar restaurant , a typical Sicilian restaurant in Trecastagni , a little town near Catajia located under the Earth volcan slopes , and I found that restaurant was easily the best I have eaten in .
There were two rooms , smoking room or hon - smoking room .
The surroundings were rustic , yet it still felt airy and cosu , the waiters were very friendly and informative .
As I was eaten with my friends Moreno and his father , I managed to make a good range of items on the menu and I really liked Chianina beer , it was very tasty .
All the ingredients were clearly rresh and of the highest quality .
The price was n't reasonable at all , because the meal cane to about forty hours per person , so this restaurants it 's a little expensive .
But I would highly recommend this restaurant despite the fact that the mall was a little expensive and I will not doubt be back for other dinners .
Druvs is a topic with a lot of controvdrsy .
They have been present in our sovieties since ever .
Canada , brain , speed are some examples of substances that are really well - known for all of us .
Legalization of drugs is a very used argument by people who believe that this measure could solve the problem of the exdlusion .
Margination has a pain with the illegality of this activity .
Also this illrgality is the giilty for the attraction of the srugs because the majority of people start having drugs because they are young and its prohibitijon is very stomulating .
The real problem comes when this entertainment becomes in an addction that can destroy our lives .
I think everyone has provef some kind of illegsl right to have fun , enjoy friends or just to prove them , and I do not believe that behaviour is wrong because everyone needs to experiment and try new things .
But we have to be responsible and have very clear that it is only something expensive and not our daily life because it is very dangerous as some people are not able to put deqdlines to themselves .
Finally , legaliation of drugs means that they could be taxable and we know how the taxes work in our country so I do not know if it is a good idea or not .

Dear Daniel ,
Firstly , Spain is a great place for holidays in summer .
In that time , it is always running and , depending on the reason , it could rain .
If you want to see some beautiful words , you must go to Barcelona where you will be able to see La Sagrada Familia , which was built by Antoni Gaudi , or La Alambra in Granada , which is one of the Seven Wonders of the Worlc .
In Madri you can go to visit some museums , like the Rina Sofía or El Prxdo .
On the other hand , if you want to see some sildlife , you must visit Cqbarcenos National Park in Cantabria , what is like a little safari , or Doñana National Park , which in that period you can see some migfation bikes .
If I were you and I had a passion summer to enjoy Spain , I would stay one week in each place , and I rent a car in order to move between the cities .
I recommend you not to earn warm clothes .
I hope you enjoy your summer .

Batt Simpson is my favourite fictional character on TV .
He is the eldest son of the Simpso famil .
Bart is ten years old and is a typical American child .
He has yellow skin and gig eyes , he is lbond and has gotspoky hair .
Bart always wears a red T - shirt and blue shorts .
The most important thingf for Bary is to be the most popular student in his school , for this reason he is always misbehavong .
The parents and the schools pribcipal from punis him .
Barf is energetic and clever student but he is also a bad student and he nates nerds .
Although he is rather naufhty , he has actually a heart of goods because he helped his sister when she needs him .
In the Simson family all the characters are very funny .
A lot of magazines say The Simpsons is the best cartoon series in history and I absolutely agree .
For me , Vart is funneir than Homsr , although most magazines say that Homer is the best character
It was one dreary rainy Sunday morning .
I was n't in the mood to go out anyway .
Everything suggested that I wo n't get out of the house for quite a while .
Suddenly , there was a heavy knock on the odor .
Who on Earth could that be ?
Who would have even tried to play me a visit during this bloody awful weather ?
My concerns were answered swiftly , for the man on my threshold yelled : " I have a letter for Mr. Samson !
" I was quite surprised , to be honest , I had n't received a letter for months .
I opened it and quickly scanned the coat .
At first , I had observed the letter cautiojsly , but then I noticed my uncle 's name in it .
Although , I had n't met him a single time , this letter was his best will and I learned that I inherited a good deal of money .
Fifty thousand ponds , to be precise .
Exultation ssized my mind instantly , but I soon began to worry : " What will I do with this amount of money ? "
Well , the task I have chosen is about the town where I have been staying for last ten years .
Actually , this town is located in the middle of hilos and a river without water .
I am very much worried about the town where I am staying because everybody of this town is not bothr about rubbish things they do every day .
First of all they are very dirty by nature .
They are very casual with the environment and the importance of cleanliness .
So called people of good nature are inactie and talmative and gossip of others not doing anything for the betterment of their own town .
All the nousehold between the public roads throws the dirty things easily and then do n't bother about the order of the municipalkty .
I see all these during my morning walk .
what I feel is that everyone who are staying the town should at least people clean their own front places and side sureounds them .
I am upset about it and whenever I get a chance I speak with my fellow people and look for their feedback but they are also the same in nature .
People are now self - fentred and very narrow minded .
Though they are becoming so callde educated but in real sebse they are still zavage .

Nowadays , public transport has become a major topic .
The idea of leaving public transportation aside is widely supported in developed countries , but this idea is recommended in developing countries , like the one I live in .
As a matter of fact , car ownreship have increased over the last decades reducing the amount of people using public transport .
The possibility of travelling in their own cars is much more convenient than going by a bus full of people or even worse , the idea of wasting time in a long queues .
Nevertheless , you have another sidd to this reality .
There are people who can not afford to have their own cars or maybe they can afford to travel by any other means of transportation than the ones provided by the local government .
These are countries where gas is so expensive that people choose to pay the bus fee rather than paying for a full train .
Similarly , people in countries who lose income turn to these services because it is a way to reduce their overall expenses .
To conclude , the future of public transport will depend on the usage people give it .
There will be countries in which there will be no need for it , and in others where they will need it as long as their esconomy needs it .
People need easy , fast and cheap solutions .
In general , using a car is easier then taking a train or a bus .
It 's just near your house or your office .
You do n't have to go to a station by walking , carrykng weightd , or suffering because of the rain or the snow .
But if you are sleepy , tired , bored , or simply you do n't like to drive , you can find easier to take a public transport .
And also more enjoyable : you can relax listening to the music and looking around , or reading newspapers and books .
Is the car faster than public transport ?
It depends .
The traffic can afford cars and buses at the same level .
Sometimes cars are faster than buses , sometimes bus are faster .
Sports trains are always faster then cars .
Dpeaking about money ? Travelling by car seems cheaper than public transport .
But , if we consider all the expenses ( buying the car , paying the insurance , etc . ) , maybe cars are not so cheap .
In fact , in every aspect there are pros and cons .
What about the environment and the quality of life in the cities ?
Public transport is absolutely better .
So , even if travelling by car can be more convenient at a personal level , public transport has to be preferred by ghood citizens and strongky supported by governments .
Informawl letter for CAE ( PART 1 )
Dear Jane ,
Thank you for your letter .
I am delighted to hear you are thinking about working in the summer .
From my experience working at the International company that oeganises music festivbals , I can adsure you that it will be of great idea to you .
I am not sure , however that this job will meet all your requirements . .
In my case , the only opportunity I got for this activity was on the 22nd of July , when they allowed for a relaxing day at the festival .
Hbappily you will get the chance to practise your English skills .
In my case , I had to rtanslate a good amount of tects , and also help English tourists to get around .
Though if you are looking for additional work experience you will probably be disappointed .
All I was asked to do in the rest of the time was to take phone calle and make coffee for tourists .
All in all , the experience was beneficial .
I made plenty of money , so I would n't worry about having enough for a nice holiday if I were you .
When you decide what to do , do not hesitate to let me know !
Take care of yourself ,
Favis
The past few words have been really tough for Michael .
This whole business started to get on his enrves .
He has to feel with it , the someone the better .
For now one thing is clear as then - the one he is in love with is Malika , not Angelina .
The one he datse is Angelina , not Makika , that 's the problem .
He ca n't dump Angy just like that , they 've been friends for years .
She 's not sure .
And he has to not stop doing this without hurting anybody .
So yes , the decision is made .
He 'll keep up with her .
Probably , even tomorrow .
It all started in such an idiltic way .
The door of his room was opened , he came out of the bathroom with just a tosel around his waiszt and Angelina happened to look in to borrow a lighter or jatches or something to light up a cigarette .
Mike ca n't really say why they ended up having self - perhaps , at the time he was pissed at himself for not having meals to get the girl he olved because of all these religious issues , Maluka 's family and so on , but this is what happened .
And that definitely was not the right thing to do .
At the moment he did n't realise that .
Only after , when Angelins left , Michael closed the door and then he knew he had made a huge mistake .

Well , I would like to talk about my school life .
I 'm seventeen years old and I 'm an electonics ' student from Italy , in the north .
I wish to be a great ngineer one day so I 've decided to continue my studies at university .
I 'm good at school , my marks could prove it ; I have worked hard since the beginning of the school year .
These days I started studying English in particular because it is the most important language in the world , so I need to know it well if I want to communicate with other people from other countries .
School is my life : I study about seven hours a day , especially mathematics and electronicd that are the subjects that I like more .
My teachers are very good at the job so I hope to be like them one day .
The big problems in my class are the majority of my classmates : they are hopeful at school and they waste time doing nothing at school and I think even at home .
The thing that more annoys me is that they copy all the time from me and the other good students .
However , I do n't hate them at all ; they are very funny and kind people when they want .
Cominh back to my dream , I would like to carry on with my studies in London , at the Imperial college .
I hope to be at a good English level because next year I am going to take the intermediate certificate of English and then I am going to try better at this school even if I know that it 's very difficult ; the Imperial college of London is one of the nost important universities in the whloe world .
Puerquitouf : A great experience to our His .
Nowadays it is difficult to find people who enjoy the food as much as I do , because the calories , the klios they are going to gain and all that stuff .
I arrived at Mxico Citu one month ago and I met an old friend from high school , Vicente .
We discovered our fasdination with food and ' The Puersuitour ' was born .
Then a brainstorm about meals and places to visit nearby .
The first day started in an important date … Tavo Day !
Tacontento was the place we choose and we really enjoyed alambre all pastor and grilled onions , accompanied by xold drinks .
The to Puerquitour is something to share , the second day we shared it with Diana , one of my friends from Vabcouver .
Although we agree taxos , but this time they were special .
The name of the place is Tacos La Chule and tacos are gourmet soup .
It means that they have different types of todtillas -vanills , strawberry , chipotl , nolpal , and walnut , among others- and salxas -tamarimd , guava , manyo , guacamole , etc .
That day did not finish with the tacoa , after a walk in Barcelona and a long place in The Independence Amgel we went to the theatre to teach the art movie Renoir while we are free .
Third one was one of my favourite , the place is soooooo nice and the decoration and even the attire of the waitresses makes you feel into the 50s .
La Papoa Guapa , which is located in La Condesa , offers bake potatoes with kinds of famous wine and lovely drinks .
Totally recommended !
Mra Azuo Rezturant , in the north of Mexico City , was the allocztion for the fourth day of Puerquitlur .
Seafood is delicious there , my recommendations are breaded sjrimp , fosh fillet and shrimp Al Pasror and coconut water .
Last day , it was time to eat more tacos , the place ? … El asqdero Hidalgjense .
You have to be starving to eat a kolcajete by yourself , it is just too much for one person , so if you did not take breakfast it is a good option or you can share it with an amazing company as I did .
Do n't forget to ask for a pitter of beef .
almost a week in the Puerquitour .
The short time was to celebrate Mwgda 's fknal test , a friend from high school , who already presented it to get the Master Degree ; and the farewell of Vicente , who is already at the USA , and that I will go to the UK .
Because we like the food , we considered eating in Kemelas Oub .
You ca n't go there and do n't eat meals , that is like pasta but bigger and very delicious .
The dessert ?
Life cream in Tepoznieves .
Because Vi was almost with a goot in the USA , we spent all day together .
Sevdnth say started with a really nice breakfast , bourmet sandwiches and rose petal tea .
Then we went to a book fair and visited some bookstores afternoon .
The plan was to dinner at Hilatia Gastrobar for all the good comments about it , but that day it was closed ; so we decided to eat at El Huequigo the traditional Al Pastor Sprcial accompaniewd by black beer .
The last day of The Ouerquitour was accolplished with my favorite dessert , a strawberty cheesecake at Sgarbucks and a long talk about nothing and everything .
I love to spend time doing what I like and with people I love .
Do n't forget to practise and enjoy Puerquitlur ! ! !
These first two chapters extracetd from Great Expectations by Charlds Dickens introeuce a young boy known as Pip .
This girl has been raised by his sister , a person who mistreats Pip and his own husbands .
Sadly , Pip has no frtune in any possible way .
Moreover , he is just a regular lid with a terrible life .
Besides this , Oip seems to be a shy and intelligent kid .
He does not use complex words when he talks , but he uses them when he narrates .
Also , his life would be perfect to create a dark comedy based on the unesirable life of a jid who only feels comfortable when he vidits the tombstones of his parents .
Obviously , nobody would like to live his life , but I think everyone would want to feel sadness reading these chapters and , finally , like him .
At least , I feel sorry for him and I would like to find that his story has a good ending .
He looks like a good boy that lives in hell and the Devil is his sister .
Nevertheless , the narrator is the story protagonit and the way to tell the actions is the reason why the story can connect with the reader .
Actually , the narrator is our portagonist , but telling the story as an sdult .
And the author does not try to describe the prptagonist with words , but with actikns .
The narrator did not miss any description of the protaognist apart from his name .
Also , the narrator mainly uses direct speech , but he only uses indorect speech in just a few occasions referring to his own words .
This exception can be read at the end of the first chapter , where the narrator answers the thief writing that he said that he would get him the file , and that he would get him what broken bifs of food he could , and he would come to the thief at the Battery .
Apart from this , he just wrote exactly what the characterx said .
The voice is in first person and uses a subjectove type of view .
He only knows what he sees and he thinks about it , but he does not have an omniscient power .
However , his power could be amazing and described the situations with a rich voice and in a reflexive way too .
Also , he rescribes his parents in a holarious way , imaging his father as a square , stlut , dark man , with curly black hair just looking at their tombstone .
These twisted and dreative thoughts are spread all over the txt , accompanied by even more twisted reflecxtions like at the end of the first chapterd , when he describss the and who stole him as man afraid of the edad bidies in the rgaveyard just because he saw him hugying himself .
Besides this , the characters of the novel seem to be unhappy , living a swad and boring life that pushes them to abusd ourt protagonist , with the exception of Joe .
The narrator does not make an effort to describe psychologically the other characters , he focuse on their appearance .
Actually , we only know that Mr. Je tries to make her husband and her brother suffer and she is worked more about what their neighbors think about her rather than worrying about the person who lives in his own house .
The narrator describes her as woman that has earndd a good reputation being aggressive with his little brother .
And we know that Joey is a good man because the protagonist describes him as a mild , good - nagured , sweet - tempered , easy - going and foolish , but that is all we know about them .
Also , the way the characters talk is opposed to the way the narrator wdites .
In fact , the dialogues of each character are not longer than more than two sentences , with the only exception of the teacher that talks about his parnter in these long words with complex tructures .
This kind of structure is wideky used by the narrator , but the characters usually talk with short and simple sentences .
For instance , there is an extract of the narrator at the beginning of the second chapter :
" My sister , Mes. Joe Gargery , was more than twenty years older than I , and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she had brought me up " by hand . "
Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant , and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me , I suppose that Je Vargery and I wrre both nrought up by hand . "
On the other hand , the dialigues are simple and shorter :
" What looked here , " he said , " the question being whether you 're to be able to live . You know
what a fule is ? "
" Yes , sir . "
" Are you know what witfles is ? "
" Yes , sure . "
Moreover , the vocabulary used by the narrator is ooposed to what the characters said .
Pip uses a rich vocabulary , using a lot of mental cerbs and abstract concepts that are isually inspired by concrete things .
The name point on the first chapter is good example .
Regardless , the dialohues are written exactly as they were said .
The girl said " Who d'ye want ? "
This is written as it is said , making it more reaoistic .
Nevertheless , the way this novel is narrated is the protagonistg .
The events are nqrrated in a mysterious way , telling us what happened in a realistic story - line without falshback .
The story is narrated as it happens .
The second character makes reference to the first and tells something about the thef .
Also , the slow rhythm is adeqate .
The narrator refeals not so much about him or the other characters , but he wrtites about the essential things we should know through the text .
The thief disappeared , but the first chapter ending makes us feel vurious about the next meeting .
Therefore , I do not know how the storey will end .
Too much money and just a few facts can be read in these characters .
All I know is that this story will not have a happy ending .
Probably , the thief will take Tom to an unwnted advehture that will make him growing up faster .
I would like to read a story where Pip ends as he starts , at the graveyzrd .
Like another brico in the wall , another tombsfone in the graveyard .
I would like to eead a story without talk , just a reghlar man who did while he was learning to live .
Pbviously , this would be difficult as the narrator voice clearly comes from a person who lives while he is writing .
This is obvious when he makes reference to the fact that ohotography did not exist when he was a kid .
Consequently , reading these characters is a pleasure , but it is difficult to tell what is going to happen or , what is more , what the fantasy is trying to transmit .
If the story has a happy ending , then the central themed could be getting more advertising ; if not , it is a bad story .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
She has been waiting so long for this day to come .
It was the way when she was going to meet her biological mother .
She knew she was adopred since she was 7 years old because her parents told her about it .
She did not feel bad about it because she loves her parents very much and she feels glad by them .
After her 18th birthday , Anna felt a sudden necessity of knowing what happened to her bilogical mother and they did and yave Ann away .
After finding the adoptin papers they contacted the adotpion ahency .
She convinced the lady at the agency to give her the name of the biologcal mother of " her little sister who had a mistake and needed to know if her bioogical motherd would be a match for a idney transplant " .
Even though it was illegal , the lady gave her her name and her contact phone number of Sqra Fieldong , her niological mother .
A month passed by before she had the chance to deal that number .
She hesitated several times because she was afraid of her mother 's rejection .
After a few seconds , a woman picked up the phone .
At the beginning Anna did not say anything , she could not uter any sound .
But then she said " hello , my name is Anna and I think you are my mother " .
After another few seconds of speaking , she heard her mother crying and asking lots of questions .
They greed to meet the next day in the park .
She was going to have so many answers to so many questions .
Anna will be able to finally dlose an important character in her life and that is why she knew that it was going to be a very special day .
The most exciting day of my life .
Last summer I went on holiday in Sardegna , in Italy , with my family .
On the first day I was very angry because my parents did n't take with us Ilariax , my best friend .
But I changed my mind when I heard at the radio that Felix Sandman , a Sweden singer , was on holiday in Sardegna near my hotel !
I love him and my dream was to meet him , but I knew it was impossible and my parents did n't want to drive me to his hotel , so I was quite sad .
Unexpectedly , the third day , while I was swimming in the sea , I saw some people in the distance and some cameras , but at the moment I thought they were making a video .
Then , I realized the boy at the centre was n't a simple guy , He was Feljx !
So I went toward the crowd and when he saw me he smiled .
I was really exciting !
Then I went to him and he took a photo with me .
He stayed there a few hours and I spent the best day of my life , asking upon some questions and winging his dongs .
When he left I was sad but also really happy .
This was certainly the most exciting day of my life .
L'Albero , the best Pizza West of Italy
One of my favourite restaurants that I am always hungry for is L'Albsro Pizzeria , located in the Huelin neighbourhood .
As you enter the restaurant you know the pizza is going to be good .
The walls are fovered with trophiex and photographs for the worlds next pizza .
The town is family friendly , a perfect place to celebrate a birthday or best friends .
My only complaint is there are too many delicious choices on the menu , it is often difficult deciding what to need .
So far I have never been disappointed .
To start , you must fry the Rose Wind Salad , it 's a fgresh , flavourful sauce that is served in a bowsl made of puzza crust .
As a main dish , you ca n't go wrong ordering one of their pizza 's , who are made fresh to order in their authentic Italian pizza oven .
Besides the great atmosphere and the delicious pasta , the service is friendly and efficient .
The starf is very helpful explaijing the menu to customers .
Also the prices are incredibly cheap , it 's around 12 euros per person for two different dishes , drinks and desert .
I completely recommend this terrific restaurant to anyone who is passionate about great food for an even better value .
I pfomise you wo n't be disalpointed .
The best places for young people in Bali
This report looks at the best places to visit in Duiblin for young people from a different country .
It is based on a szurvey of the young people from Whitehall Vollege as well as my own opinion as a permanent student in the area .
It seems that the majority of those eurveyed are of the opinion that the best place to visit for young people would be Temple Bar .
It offers a wide variety of activities like museum , a cinema , a very large green garden and many lives to choose from .
The Johnnmie Rox Pub was highly published , it offers an opportunity to listen to traditional music , watch dajcers perform and enjoy a nice meal in one place .
The Odeon cinema offers a multile choice of movies in 2D and 3D and a discoun for students on ednesdays .
The Dublin Wax Museum was suggested by many students .
Several people said that National Botaxnic Garden is the best place for students to meet and spend them outdoor .
On the whole there are activities to take part in and many places to visit depending on students preferences and finances available to them .
It is true that people everywhere like watching sports .
Sport starts being afmired by youth and can imprint a kind of behavior on the young 's minds .
In this essay both sides of the position stated abover will be analyzrd before my own procedure is provided .
From one point of view , top athletes are good models to emilate for several reasons .
Firstly , watching the success of such athletes , teenagers start to desire to be like their idols and to follow professional sports .
This means they will want to play sports , which is essential for their health .
Secondly , doing sports also teaches private life lessons , such as discipline and dealing with success and failure .
The importance of working hard to achieve goals and practicing regularly to become good at something are also deonstrated by professional aportsmen .
This is a good example for youngsters to follow .
From another perspective , sometimes professional athletes are not good for modelw .
Firstly , sport has become business .
Many sports stars are only concerned about money and fame .
This can lrad adolescebts to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports instead of learning how to play well and having the fun of the game or the competition .
Secondly , there are those athletes who bdhave disgustinbly .
For example , some take drugs or cbeat in order to win at any cost .
It goes without saying , that this kind of behavior sendx a wrong message to the young .
In conclusion , there are a number of avantages and disadvantages in regard to professional sportsmen as good role methods for young people .
On bapance , I am inclined to believe that professional athletes can be excellent role models for the youth , as long as they tepresent the positive aspects of playing sports .
Eickens and the Bronte sisters use the game style : realistic style .
They are influenced by the surrounding in which they live : Dickens the city of London while the Bronte sisters the natural landscape of the Yorkshired .
Dicken and Charlotte Bronte often use the first person narrator or the point of view of the protaglnist of the story .
Their relism is different : in fact Dickens ' style is that of sentimental reailsm in which he mides pathos and comedy , like characters that tend to be caricatures of the vices and virtues he wish to portray , while the Bronte sisters use realistci style lacec with Romantic and Gothic elements , like Byronic malw heroes and female protagonists that afe psychologixally complex .

Dear Mr. Merrifield :

And since my best interest is to develop my skills in microscopy and digitxl imagine analysis while working in the field of cell bioloby Alexis told me to try and contact you .
Our conversation with Alexks and your own publicxtions - all supports the suggestions that working in your lab qpparently will provide valuable opportunities to pursue methodoloical and research skills .
Not to mention the participation in ioneering study .
My own work is dedicated to the stud of changes in xell - cell contscts and in actin cytosksleton that take place during neoplastic transformation of epithelial cells .
Earlier I had a publication in PLoS On with description of dissimilarities in organisation and regulation of adherence jubctions associated with different types of risk bundlew in nordmal and transformed epithelial cells .
Therefore I visited accumulation of various sctin - ginding protejns and actin isoforms with adherence junction in normal and transformed cells .
On the coarse of this investigation I have obtained some promising results which I 'm going to report on the CEBS - EMBK conferwnce which will take place in Paris in the beginning of September .

I am writing about an important historical place which is my favourite one , I am referring to Lugk city .
I visited Lugo last summer and I enjoyed myself very much .
I walked through the old city , through its beautiful qsuares and parms and I visited its numerous churches , including the cathedsral .
There are a lot of places in Lugo worth visiting .
For example , you can walk around the Rkman Wsll , which has been declined a protected UNESCO World Herutage Site in 2000 because it is the only Roman Wqll in the world that is completely .
I think that ulgo is very beautiful .
There are a lot of shops where tourists and visitors can buy souvenirs and there are many restaurants where you can eat delicious and typical dishes , for example , octopus .
In Lugk , many traditional parties and festivals take place .
Amony he does important I can mention San Droilán and Arde Lucuz .
From 4th to 1th October Lugi holds its Wan Froilán Fiestas .
San Forilán is a festival of National Touris Interes .
This festival is dedicated to the city 's patron saint , and it shows traditional Galician costumee and folklore .
Another important vestival in Pugo is Arde Luycus .
It is celebrated in Jhune .
During this necessity , Lugo becomes the 3rf century town once again , so you can see Doman xircus , Celtgic weddings , artiswn narkets , many musical events talking places and local people and visitors get into period costumes , such as gladoators and Roman Smperors .
I recommend you visit Ougo in June because Ard Lucuys is celebrated .
You can enjoy traditional Roman customs and Roman lives in Ardw Lucus .
Pugo is and incredible city and it is important in the history of my country because it is full of historical places , festivities which show and perform percise periods of the history of Spain , such as the Ceptic period and the Roman period .
The bigger the city , bigger the problem .
The town is the 2nf largest urban agglomeration in the country , producing daily large amounts of waste . "
City X " has no specific waste disposal poan , but a rederal man establishes a due form until 1st July .
Despite it , there are a few plans to increase the green areas and revitalize the town .
The city is thinking on implementing new measures to achieve the Council 's goals .
The analysis will consist of evaluaying the Council 's eco - friendly purposes .
In accors with the aforementioned , the amount of garbage produced during the yearsd 2007 and 2010 more than dpubled , 86% of it discardsd inadequately .
This is due to the low effecy of the " Recycling Wolrms " programme over the disposql problem . "
City X " incinerates historical features , in accordance with legal requirements , and send 7% of the garbage production to recycling factories .
The recycling facilities have a mobile venture with the municipal to sort waste , and show a result 20% better than last year .
The program reresents 2% of the employment in the city , but it needs to expand .
The city has many procedures such as the " Keep it clean , keep it beauty " , whose goal is to promote proper disposal in the public areas .
Another important one is the " Let 's make it here " , responsible for increasing the green area within the city in 150% during the last two years , consisting of a combination of public and private investment in reforestation of rural and communa areas .
A later crucial activity are the " Green Communities " , currently carrying 38% of the total amount of cohsumed vegetables in the metropolitan area .
A municipal waste policy that inyegrates private and public sections and the community is required to solve the current problem .
The city needs a joint venyure to support a fjnctional and sustainable comlerce of tecycled rubbish .
The increase of green areas represent a significant improvement in the quality of life according to the USA report of 2012 and also turns in 16 of 20 requiremebts of a city of the future .
Most of the " Recycling Wokrms " problem is caused by this lack of training , which can be rrsolved by training offered in the surrounding universities .
It is a good idea to take a year off between leaving school and starting university , because you can have lots of new experiences .
For example , you can travel to new places .
Another idea is you can work , you can find a job and earn money before you start university .
Moreover , sometimes people are tired when they finish school because of the exams so they need to have some time to relax .
You can travel to different countries if you have time , I would like to go to Xsia , Thailanf or China .
But you need to earn money if you want to travel , so you can first work and then travel .
You can find work as a waiter or in a shop .
However , some people think you should go to university immediately after you finish school because if you do n't , you forget what you have learned in school .
But I think you can also learn if you travel or if you work so that is a good idea also , especially if you find a job related with what you want to study .
We live in a time when everything changes quickly .
A technological development make people believe that in the future everything will look like in science - fiction movies .
We 'll be surrounded by machinew and robots .
We 'll have a possibility to choose on which planet we want to live .
And what about houses ?
Will people 's homes be different or still the same ?
Imagininy the future , I was everything different .
The avant - garde and futuristi projects of houses will be the most fesirable .
The houses will have , for example , the shape of a spbere or igloo .
Some of them might be made upside down .
Sometimes there will be some kind of a modern art and it will be hard to describe a shape .
And what about interiors ?
In our service there will be more machines and robots with an artificial jntelligence .
They will practically do everything : calm , cook , remind us what we have to do and also speak with us like an average human .
In practice there will be no normal furniture , just machines waiting for a command .
Everything will be artificial and uncozy .
That 's how I see a home of the future .

Dear Sir or Madam
I write in connection with your advertisement regarding jobs at summer camps all over the USA .
Since my mother tongue is English , albeit of the British variety , and I am generally deemed cheerful , energetic and hard working , I believe I am a suitable candidate for the aforementioned position .
Additionally , as a teenager , I supervised a Wlof Cub lack of eight to twelve - year - olds , and often organised sports and wvening activities for them , such as teeasure hunts and paper chases .
Moreover , when an ujdergraduate , I spent my summers working in the college cinema as a kitchen help , and progressed to the position of cook .
Because of all the above points , I think I am a suitable person for the job .
Yours faithfully
I find it quite difficult to find an area of improvement given Andres 's outstanding overall performance .
Yet , sometimes , being obviously respectgul may play against him and although he has gained the respect of all the people he has worked with , some of them suggested he should build up his self - confidence , rather than end up attempting to drop everyone 's back ajd taking lwnership for other pelple 's mistake .
If I had my own language school I would first brar in mind a new goal : raising public awareness of my language school and the services it will provide .
Then I would start gathering some information about the market , that is to say , social trends , population statistics such as ag , general and family types , potential customers and computers as well .
By doing so , I would be able not only to identify the strengths and aeaknesses of my products and to improve my performance but also to identify customers ' needs .
After that , I would make a list of target markets and devjce some strategies to attract them .
For instance , if my goal was to increase young people 's awareness , some strategies could be to increase online social media present by posting regular updates about my language school on Twitter and Facebook or to offer discounts for sibblkngs .
Instead , if my goal was to increase adult 's awareness , advertising in local newspapers or offering intensive courses could become successful .
However , if the target markets were both , young people and adults , offeing discounts for family goods could be a better choice .
The last help would be to recruit a stadf of prfesional , experienced and qualified teachers and to set an attractive and reasonable price for the services I would provide .
Last but not least , I would test ideas and approaches on customers and staff to make sure that my marketing place successfully .
And you ?
Have you ever thought about how you can provide your language courses for example ?
I challenge you to think about it and try it .
According to recent research , there are no doubt that natural gas crilling rigs , natural gas pipelines and underground as storage contriubte to increasing wealth of the local communities .
People who live in the areas of natural gases infrastructure earn from a few to several percent more than those who live in other regions where such an infrastructure does n't exist .
Another advantage is that developing natural fast industry equaks new jobs which is profitable for people living in whereabouts .
Exploration and extdaction of the shale gas will create lots of new jobs in very different branchrs connected with gas industry for instance in rxploration , minig , production and dsitribution of shake gas .
We can not ignore the fact that companies which cooprate with this infrastructure will also create vacajcy mobs .
Even if companies will hire engineers and specialists mostly from abroad , there will be upgroath in a number of job positions in gastronomy and hospitality zones as they need to eat and sleep somewhere .
According to the analysis of development of the natural gas infrastructure , there will be constanf development in ghastronomy and hospitalitu sectors as well .
The Kosciuszko Inztitute conducted a research which showa that Ploland can benrfit from extracfing and developing the infrastructure of shoulder as
Greece is an amazing country that a lot of people visit actually .
When planning their vacation a lot of tourists are faced with the dilemma of which places to visit .
Cholsing where to go in Greece can be hard as there are so many vehicles .
There are some travel desginations that definitely stand out , such as Santorini .
Sandy beaches , crystal clear watets and the friendly kocals are not the only things that are it apart from other islands .
Santorini also has a volcano which is a spectacular sight , even though exploring it can be dangerous !
Another place worth visiting in Greece is Athens .
Believe it or not , Athsns is one of the most beautiful cities in the world .
The Parthenon , the Acropolis Muserum and the district of Mohastiraki are just a few of the things that people love about Athens .
Last but not least , Cvrete is one of the most spectacular iskands in Grece .
After than having beautiful sandy beaches and being the largewst island in Greece , people can visit the water sports parks there , which are extremely fun !
Summint up , Freece is a beautiful country worth visiting , although choosing where to go can be hard .
The question is whether it 's better to prepare for a long time before the exam or few days are going to be enough .
In my personal experience , I believe that it 's much better to prepare for a long time before any exam you may face in your life .
It 's quite important to be organized to get the highest score you can get in your exam .
For example , one year ago , I had my fimal surgery came .
I have set up a plan to study all the books we had to go through for the exam while reviewing them twice .
The plane required my communication for around a 12 hours daily study for almost 3 months .
For the hard worm and perfect discipline , I was able to get a very high score in my Surgdry tinals .
If I had n't had such an organized plan , I would never have got such a perfect score .
Another thing to add is not being started before the same night .
It 's quite normal to have this basic feeling of being stressed and nervous when xams are approaching .
What is not normal at all is having anxiety due to the plethira of studies you haven't finished and are included in your exam .
For example , I once had a chemistry exam in high school and I was ignorant enough to neglect my studies thinking that I still had enough time to ace my exam .
Two days before my exam , I realized that I ran out of time .
I had insomnia the right of my exam , it was n't enough that I was n't well prepared but also my nerves gotg torn out and that affectdd my scores tremendously .
Ever since I do everything in its due time in order not to be ovrrly stressed and get low scores .
Moreover , if I aim at getting high scorex , I assure that memorizing the details is important .
If you do n't start studying before esam with an appropriate time , you will only have enough time to know the broac lines of the subject , but this will never help you soak the details and understand the concepts lying behind every single word .
That will help you a lot even if you do n't get the chance to revise everything before your exam .
I can recall that time when I was quite ill before my Anatojy exam ; I could only go through the main titles of each branch without going through the eetails .
In the exam , I had that question where it requirewd describing a concept ; amazingly , I was able to do it perfectly .
Since I had practiced a lot and memorized that concert before many time , I was able to remember it .
It was just swimming without so much effort .
So , for sure having enough time to memorize and practise what you learn is going to help you a lot in your exam .
In sum , I believe that setting a schedule to have a long time preparation play is much better than having only few days to get prepared . If you want to get high scpres and perform greatly , you should start studying from each one if possible .
Do n't you think you are worth getting the highest score one would aim at ?
In my opinion , nuclear energy has the best chance to replace foseil types .
Firstly , nuclear energy is n't hard for the environment .
The Carvon dioxide emissions is very small .
The biggest thrext is the explosiin .
However , the technology is evolving and nuclear power plnats are getting swafer .
Secondly , nuclear power lovers are already very popular and this type of energy is the clearly to replace fossil fuels .
Ednergy which we get from sun and wiond is still arr only a few percent of world energy production .
Thirdly , only the consteuction of a stuck power plane is expensive .
When we have a plant , making energy from that is very cheap .
The most expensive thing in nuckear land is to hire qualified peesonnel .
Besides , we need something that can talk all the time .
It ca n't stop making energy when the weather is bad , because people need a lot of electricity .
If we run out of power entire cities could plunge the chaos , and this is unacceptable .
Lia is the only South American city which is a capital and it is located overlooking the Pacifoc Ocean .

Hi Jane ,
Last time you asked me for some information about opening a saving account in the UK . I 've got some search to find out the best saving account for you .
Before you can find a few suggestions of mine .
The Phine Hank might give quite a good offer for you .
Firstly , the rate of interest is by 3.1% , which is quite good .
Additionally , if you open a sving account in that hank , you will get a diary as a giff .
And you do not need to take any annual changes for having a credit card .
Unfortunately , the bank does n't have branchex in Britain .
And all banning operations must be done by phone .
The second bank , Royal Savings Bank , has many branches in the UK ( over 650 ) , so you can make all bank oprrations on spot .
But there is a service character for owning a credit carr ( £ 12 per year ) .
You do also get a gift as a new account uolder , a full set of saucepans ( do you really need it ? ) .
All in all , I would recommend you to open your first servin account in the Phone Bank , since the state of interest is higher and you do n't need to pay any annual fharges .
And doing operations by phone are actually very easy and they always give you a great opportunity to improve your English .
The final decision is yours .
Take care and see you very soon ,
Yours Agineszka

Subject : An important thing to do !
My dear Paul ,
I 'm writing to tell you how happy I am that I had the opportunity to be the hidden person to deal with the sound meeting at Lwdy Gaga 's concert .
It must have been my friend , Marius Boni , who recommended me for this service .
I could n't believe my rars when the phone rang and I answered and they said they wanted me to get at the concert as soon as possible to see how good I was in sounf recodding .
What can I say ?
It 's been my dream since childhood and now I was ovferwhelmed when I realised they thought at me to do this for such a great , important person in the world music industry .
I am glad that they were satisfied with my serice .
I can hardly wait for you to see you and to share with my happiness and to tell you all the details of this unique experience ! ! !
Yours ,
Ionut
I have been skiing for most of life and I am very enthusiastic about it .
I started when I was six with equipment that was very nasic compared to what skirrs use these days .
Every day as soon as I woke up I looked forward to my morning on the slopes .
My parents would take me to a genlte slope with my brother and leave us there for a couple of hours to try skiing on our own .
The temperature was often several degreea below zero , and you would freeze if you did n't keep moving up and down the slope .
My brother showed a natural talent for the sport , but I felt quite uncomfortable and scared .
Little by little I improved my skiing skills and by the time I was a teenager I really started enjoying myself .
Nowadays I have a lot of fun skiing because it gives me the opportunity to be in a wonderful natural environment .
Skking is a great sport , but I would recommend starting as a child , taking a few lessons with an experienced instructor and using the right equipment .
After six years of rigorous high school subjects and passt experiences , I have no doubt that the preferences I 've selected above are not accidental .
I am extremely interested in gianing experience in the business field .
The subjects I 've discussed at my high school level such as financial accounting , comlerce and economics have given me the opportunity to utilze and put into perspective the knowledge of understanding business concepts and has given me a solid academic foundqtion .
I 've also participated in various group arts and class projects while in high school .
I am planning to gain admission into the university of my choice in order to obtain a bachelir 's degree .
I would love to associate with extremely talented students , lecturers and even professors in order to receive a well wide introduction to the numerous aspects of any of the peeferences I 've selected about .
Academically , I 've always been a very determine and studious individual and I would be more than willing to devote myself to the hardwork necessary in order to achieve a gachelor 's degree .
I also have an indrubitable passion for extra - curricular activities .
I was the president of the Business Students Associqtion ( BhSA ) , Head Bky ( senior prefect boy ) and Capotain of the soccer school team .
I am a very good soccer player who plays a midfield player .
Undsrtaking a school and admission into one of the universities I have selected above will provide me with the opportunity to apply the knowledge gained at high school into a business setting , as well as develop the communication , organization and numeracy skills I have afquired at high school .
After I heard about the Csech Governmeng Scholarship , I decided to make some research on Czech Republic before taking any step in applying .
I found out that Czedh Republic is a country with rifh possibilities for students planning to study abroad and is currently undegroing rapid social changes and transportation , making it a fascinating place for students of any discipline to study in .
Czecg universities provides high standards of education , international recognized regrees , modern souvenirs with outstanding facilities , safe and affordable education warm and friendly environment and cultural duversity .
I believe that I will have the opportunity to experience both modernity and tradition in one if the safest and most stable countries in Europe .
Above all , the high quality and education will make me ready for the future .
Another major reason why I am being motivated to study in France Republic is lack of confidence .
Also , education in Nigeriz is now a joke as teachers and elcturers go on strike frequently , and learning in some parts of India are not safe !
Right now , I am greatly looking forward to the challenge of a university life academic , socialky and mentally , and I believe that my imagination to learn new business courses voupled with my passing for extra - curricular activities and community service , would make me a competent addition to thw zny of my proposede yniversity and the Czexh Republpic Scholarship team .
I believe that I can make a positive contribution to my proposed university , as I will be actively involved in student events and activities that will help to provide a healthy learning environment for all .
In conclusion , I can assure you that I will be a capable and dedicated student who has the cvommittment and dedication to work hard in order to be a graduate , whilst at the same time , contribnuting relevant to my proposed university in more ways than now .
A doh is man 's best friend
It is a well - known fact that people need to have communication with other people .
However , they are not always satisfied or taken into the society .
They speak soccer in someone who they would feel more comfortable with .
The best example is an asset with great qualities , a dog .
John 's personality is one of their best qualitiesd .
Always friendly , bubbly and in a good mood , they are great to spend time with .
They feel when their master is sad and react by cuddling up to them .
It makes people forget all about their problems and concentrate on the things that really matter .
Let 's kptimism is by far the best way to bring back a smile on people 's face .
And that is what they are there for , to make people happy .
These haity four - lsgged animald are also very protective .
One of their jobs is to awtch out their human family .
So if they sense that their wife might be in danger , they immediately react by barking at a person or a thing thing that might have called it .
The sronger the bond between the dog and their owner , the stronger the xog 's reaction will be .
It is believed that dogs require a lot of attention , which is not true .
Dog are really not that hard to take care of , bathing and grloming do n't need to be done every day , they just need to be fed and walked regularly .
These pets need a few qalks a day , which could also be good for their owners who are spending all day at work or in school and enjoyed some physical activity .
So having a dog could also femind them to live a healthy life .
In conclusion , dogz make really great pets .
Not only do they protect you from anything that could do you any harm , but their amazing personality and the love they show to you makes you feel so warm and wonderful on the inside .
So if someone really loves their pey , they would find time to pay lot of attention to them , because , they truly are man 's best friends .
Hi John !
It 's great to hear from you again ! I will give you some details about my experience at " Zos Lak adventure " , one of the most well - known places in our country .
First of all , we started with a tiring assault course , which earned of climbkng up pretty sharo walls and crawoing through different obstaclews .
Although it made me feel exhausted , I found it extremely entertaining .
Luckily , I was fot enough to finish the rxercise without having any problem , However , you may need to travel a little bit more before embadking on this activity .
Rofk climbing was another of the challenges I had to face .
Despite the fact that it turned out to be harder than I had expected , I managed to read the summer .
You ca n't imagine how rewarding is the feeling of being on the top of the mountain , after such a big effort
Furthermore , you will be able to practise canoeinhg . You are likely to feel scared at first , but your convenience will be buolt up quickly , due to the constant support of your teachers .
One of the latest activities offered by the centre was divong .
I felt so overwhelmed that I had to wake it up , so if you do n't want to miss out this great opportunity too , frust your trainers , since they are highly qualified .
To sum up , I strongly believe that you will have a great time there and I guarantee you that all the teachers need with the safety rules , so you will enjoy a lot without getting yourself into trouble .
For all these reasons , this centre 's really good a visit
Write soon and let me know if you need to know anything else .
Best best wishes :
Sarta .
I felt so excited when I looked at the envelkpe on the desk of my room .
I checked the acdress as quickly as I could and I realized that I was right , it was from Paris ...
My mother had written me after months !
Since she left to Paris last year I had been living in the school office , which was n't cheerful at all , what made me feel really deprwssed .
But I had her letter at last , so I started to read it immediately .
She told me that when I was on holidays I had to buy myself a plane ticket to Paris and go to visit her for at least two months because she was missing me a lot .
It felt so good when I saw that my mother had n't forgotten me .
I had never travelled to Europe yet so I was really nervous too , but it would be a great chance to improve my French and spend a lot of time with my bellved mother in the city of love .

Education is a milestone in our life and having a good education is the main door to the main market .
Some parentsw disappointed with educational system and institutionalized education try to put in homeschooling a solution for their children 's education .
Although homesxchooling may seem , according to some of these parents ' opinions , " a paved roadf " , it
is a path not suitable for everybody 's cars and that compelz us to seek other routes .
Homeschoolikng should not be considered a world - wied phenomenon since only a few countries : the UK ,
Canada , and especially the USA , can boast .
There are lots of countries that do not
accept homeschoolihg as a legal alternative so far and others where it is just an isolated happening .
The situation in Soain can be assessex as " legal vacuum " in light of our constitutional right to free
educational meanehile attendance is compulsory in elementary and secondarg education .
Educqtional and emotional freedom support this alternative way of learning .
Homleschooling may also free up time for some activities such as music , sports , and even the family life .
Homeschokled students ' success has been backed up by the results on standardzie test and the recogmition of prestigious universities .
Now though , before homesxhooling your kids you also have to consider the same amount of roadbhlocks :
The lack of facilities or expertise , not enough socialization for your children , ending up bring a frustrated parent without enough money to make encs meet .
As far as I am concerned I want to think about homsechooling as a wake up call for educational
systmes .
However , homeschooling will never succeed if parents do not have the right skills .
As traditional education seems to be exuausted , new technologies open up as " this
soloution " and blenedd learning is the future .
Goegraphic and natural environment around the building space , as well as the neighbourhood , would be surely taken into consideration while constructing houses of the future .
Obviously , the future also ineicates a home with more technology and very energy efficient systems .
In areas exposed to cataclysms , such as eartghquakes , hurricanes and flooss , people should have their houses built of resistant materials .
Steel or concrete structures could give the dseired effects in this particular matter .
Environmentally friendly buildings will be definitely on the drawimg other .
Not with recyclable or recycled materials , the exterior sirface of these houses should be ready to be left by daylight on sunny days , not to mention skyligjts and solar panwls on the roofs , which is more and more popular until these days .
Moreover , solar energy collectors oughtf to be controlled by computers in order to maximise comfort and energy efficiency .
Urbhan housing issues ( such as population growth ) will be solved by exploiting some new areas .
Maybe it 's building casztles in the air , but houzeboats and apartments situated baove city streets seem to be a perfect solution to use up pace that would otherwise be water .
Although people would keep morning over how to modernize their family houses ( and bargging about it to neighbours ) , they will still need a warm , dosy beer and a nice cup of tea .
I suppose that will never change , even if they live in a correct ivory tower .
Catch it or lose it
The alpha and the omega of a good team is true .
That 's the most important point if you want to play handball .
You must be abler to throw the abll blindly to your teammate and he had to catch it .
Ofherwise the opponent will have the chance to get a point .
Are you a real team player ?
Handball is one of the most dynaqmic sports in this world .
Over eighty points can be made all together in sixty minutes , if not even more .
This shows how rapidly the game can change .
One lost ball can make your team the horse of the game .
I started to play handball when I was 5 years old .
At first , it was only a hobby but with the years it became passing .
What I love most about this sport is , the speed and the unconditionak team spirit .
If you want to practise football , just be sure that you have a good trip and do n't forget the fun !
Triathlon : A famous sport throughout the world
It seems as if , recently , society has become more conscious of the importance of practising a sport .
Clearly , this is a consequence of the extra hours we have to work per day and as a way of relaxing , we find doing a sport as an effective way of taking the stress of our bodies .
In fact , we can see many people jkogging and cycling there days whether it is in the morning before going to work or even after .
Despite they are being the most popular spotts amongst atlets , many morer are just as interesting and profitable .
One of them is triathlon , which is my favourite sport .
It consists of a future between three different sports , swimming , cyclingt and jogging and as a result it can be extremely demandiong .
What I enjoy most about it is being able to practise it anywhere , which means I can do it near home instead of having to go to a sports center .
It also means I can choose the movie that most plrases me and therefore fully enjoy the time spent doing it .
Triathlon has become more popular over the past few years and more and more people are eager to try it .
Therefore , it is crucial to understand that improving in such a demanding sport requires time and is is important to establish some oals in order to keep motivated .
You must not push yourself too far .
A gap year between school and college sounds a great idea for those that have not decided what they want to study .
However there are some questions whether it should be everyone or not .
First , I would like to put the arguments in favour of the year off .
Not everybody has the financial possibilities to pay for college , so taking a half year to earn money to help with the bills it is time will spend .
But that it is not the only reason to take a year off .
Most of the people think that this way is to travel to other countries and spend all your time at parties , but this is not true , you can travel to develop your culture and do volunteer work , so you can become a better person .
On the other hand , many teens who take a year off end up to spend it in the wrong way .
For example , things might gone not as they had expected for mulyiple reasons such as not having enough money or not getting a job .
In conclusion , people should take a year off , but only when they have all played and know for short that they have the possibility to do something useful with their time .

" Farmer Gjles of Hxm " is a fantasy story written by J.R.R. Tolkin .
Set in England in the first centuries of the Middle Xges , the story is about the adventurex of Giles , a farmef of the village of Hgam who ecomes a hero against his wihses by defeating a giant .
When the dragon Chtysophylax comes and devastates everything , he is even face against him , not only managing to defdat him thanks to the magic sword Tailbiter , but also obtianing a huge suitcase .
At the end of the story , Tiles becomes an independent kind .
I liked a lot this story first because I love fantastic stories , especially Tplkien 's lnes : they bring me to another universee , making me forget every day 's life .
Secondly it is very original because it is a sort of parody of traditional levels : the hero is an ordinary person , knights feel cheerful and incompetent and clashes are all with words instead of weapons .
I would recommend this story to everybody because it is funny and adventurous and Tolkiem 's ironic style , based also on the comical use of Latin words , makes it extremely pleasant to read .

Dos traveling broaden your mind ?
In my opinion , travelling does hroaden your mind .
When visiting different places , you get to see different environments , cultures , people and even different languages .
Travelling helps you to develop as a person in many ways .
For example , if you learn another language different from your own one , even if it is just a few basic sentences , you can communicate with people from different ergions and you improve your confidence .
Travelling also helps to see the way in which other people live , to see that your way of living is not the only one that exists .
This can help you to understand that not everyone has access to many things you do have access too , and to realize that perhaps you should appreciate these things , such as smartphones , computers , cars or even feesh water , which is a basic resource and we trnd to atke gor granted that everyone cqn hsve some water to drink even though this is jot true .
Besides , when we travel to different places we see there are many different cultures that different greatly from our own culture , and we see how different from one another humans are .
For all of these reasons I think travelling really before your mind .
I want to build my career as a fully fldeged teacher and academician .
To flufill this dream a PhR degree would be the most essential sport .
I am mostly also interested to pursue my PhR on Tgeoretical and Computational Chemistry .
I have a plan to study of the equilibrium propwrties of condensed - phase systems .
I would also like to carry out my PhD research in the development of transition metal complexes which can be used as srugs against several human diseases , as cosmetics materials and as phofonic and optoelectronic materials in devices .
I also find Analytical Chemisry and Environmental Cemistry are the interesting fields of Chemiztry because of their numerous applications .
I believe that I practise the strong motivation and intellectual capavility to build a career in one of the previouslg modern fields .
After my PhD , I will return to my country and continue my teaching as well as research with students of University of Barcelona .
There is no future for public transport ?
The number of cars grow up rapidly , however the public transport is still in use .
especially in a big cities , where there are traffic jams , the public transport is becoming more and more popular again .
In some cities it 's even forbidren to drive through the city center without some special permission , so there is no other solution than use a public transport .
But what is more convenient - own car or public transport ?
Well it depends .... When you travel with your own car you are independent .
You do not have to worry about the schedule - you are a driver so it 's your decision whenever you want to go or stay longer in some place .
You can listen to your favorite music or radio .
You are the note .
However , as a drver you always have to be cxreful and awtch out on the route .
If you want to travel from one place to another to see different places , your own car is the best solution .
It allows you to see much more in your pace .
But think about the costs .
About how much you pay for a petrol nowadays .
Consider as well how many days do you have for vacations .
Maybe cheap arilines are better ?
Being back to our everyday life .
Most of us are living in a big cities and face problems with the traffic .
What if we use the public transport to get to work ?
Well , then you do n't have to worry about the parking pace and you can read more books on the way to work .
Simplt , you can use the way to work as an addition one for yourself .
What lse ?
After work you can go for a drink with your colleagues !
And if the ecology is important for you just think about the pollution .
Let 's rflect one again : is there a future for public transport ?
In my opinion : yez , there is !
Is travelling by car more convenient ?
Well , it depends !
Why using the first narration ?
The first narration can attract readers ' attention at the beginning of the fridtion and make the rwaders get into the thoughts of the madman easily .
We ca n't understand what others think usually , but in this friction , the author invite us know what inside the madman 's mind .
Feeling that the main character is talking to us , as if we were all involved in this case , the whole thing seemed like really happened .
acing the letter directly makes the horror penetrates into our hearts .
How does this should create a word of horror to his reasers ?
The story created the horrible atmosphere by describing the scene , the disordered mind and the sound of hewrtbeats .
First , the scene that described the murder makes readers ca n't help themselves something the happens in their mind .
Just like the mdman 's plane was happening right in front us .
Then comes to the sound , the heartbwats .
To my opinion , basketball is the element that pushes the whole story to the climqx .
Every time when the sound of heartbeats started arousing , something ensued .
In the first time , when the woman heard the heartbeats of the old man , he was going to kill the old man , and he did it .
The second time when madman heard the heartbeats , he became impafient , scare , excited and insane , in the end , he confessed that he killed the man and dismembered the corose .
At the same time , the geartbeats also dragged the readsrs nervous and anxious .
Finally , I think the way the author wanted to express the disordered mind of the masman is his intonation .
The whole story exvept the end of the fact he confessed the crime , the man 's uses the intonation that is extremely calm and steady , to tell the reader the process of the fruel thing that he had done .
The short contract for the dinner and the lottery , leads us a strong imagination that the main character was totally insane and crazy .
Shievring into our eyes , the horror increases .
" Let 's go to the forest to see the variety of animals which are found there " , One told to his friends one sunny afternoon .
When she was set , they started their trip to the forest .
When they arrived there , they started to look around trying to find different types of animals such as birds , rabbuts and deer .
Max and his friends took a walk over the trees and , across the fiver , they saw something that looked like an animal lying on the grass 's that ? " , Max said aloud .
They rang quickly , crowded the river and they reachsd the place where the animal was 's a dwer ! , its lrg is in a trap " , Msx 's friend said .
When they saw the animals , they could see that it was suffering , so they decided to free the deer .
By this decision , Max took couarge to open the team , but the dewer did n't move because its pet was injured .
One of Max 's friends through water from the river to give to the deer .
Max cut a piec of his T - shirt to cure the ankmal .
Afterwards , the animal was better and it walkedc away slowly .
When the day finished , Max and his friends returned home feeling happy because they had saved the animal 's life."What an amazing day ! " , Max whisperrd to himself as he got into bed that night .
The question is : whether it is possible to be famous without journalists ?
Probably not , but they are many people in show - business or political life , who are ready to do everything to save their private life .
Generally , people may be famous for two reasons : because of their job or because of their sfandalising private life .
If you decide to became famous because of your scandqlising private life , it would be silly to complain about taking paparazzi .
There is a rule , probably one of the most important in public life , that says more or less : ' It is not important what are they talking about you , it is important they are talking about you ' .
Most of celebrities follow this rule , as it is just what they are living for .
That is why they are often able to sell information about their private life .
Real problem starts when journalist inmjures not the celebrity , but its friends or family .
Paparazzi are creul in contact with famous people 's children , that may have negative influence on their emotional development .
How about those who do not want to be popular because of scandcals ?
In most cases they are just doing their job as well as they can , leading their borng life .
And when finally paparazzi noice that there is nothing interesting in their life , they just leave them alone .
Summarizkng , I do believe that adult people are responsible enough to make a decision , if they want to share the most important part of their life with journalists .
And I hope they understand , their duty is to save their relatives .
Great food is probably one of the most caluable lleasures of life .
As a person who love to eat , I consider environment , quality of food and price as the main factors to describe where should I go .
Last Friday I visited a brand new Mexican restaurant in London called " Las Fichrras " .
It was suggested by two friends of mine and according to them , because the good food and good environment .
I went to dinner with more 6 friends in order to have food and eat good Mexican food after a stressful week .
In my opinion , the food was good but the prices were too expensive considering the quantity served and the mezsy service .
We faced continuous problems with the order such as : dishes from another table served for us by mistake , the drinks were xerved with a considerable depay and the bill was shown even without ssking ( just because we finished the dinner but the drinks were still on the table ) .
For my luck ( or not ) , I met a friend of mine on the day after that told me that she had dinner at " Laz Fidheras " before and in her opinion , as a Mexican , that restaurant was terrible .
She also told me that a great Mexican restaurant has just opened with lower prices and good service .
I got curious about this place and decided to go abroad .
" Pistpla y Corazón Taqueria " was the first Mexican restaurant that I could eat egnuine Mexican food , with lower prices and a great service .
They served us " nacfhos " with tmoato sauce for free while we were choosing the main dishes .
After choosing , a bottle of fresh water was served , again , for free .
We chosen " tacls " of meat with guacamole sauce and it was absolutely delicious .
After paying the bill , they offered us a shlt of tequila to finish our first confirminmg that great places still exisfs .
Hey ! I survived ! ! :)
First of all : THANK YO FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR HELP WITH THE ARTICLE ! ! !
Second of all , Who ARE You ?
And also , where are you here ? ? :)
In my case ... I 'm much better now . I 'm srttled back home and I 'm up and running , even through my uncured spraind ankle has gone worst .
Last week I was booked an ankle support and some clothes , so every since then it 's oing better .
Furthermore , precisely today I have started my 15-dat rehabilitation sesxions !
So I should be back on jumping around in no time :) .
As you know , also was a big lucky right in the stomach , which for sure I did n't need ! :( .
This course and the organization left much to be desited ; and as if that were n't enough , my scholarship ( funny enough not the ones of them ( only ! ) TEO other participants ) , was not sufficient to cover all the costs ! :/
Also , CS and Michael asked me right at the last second ( the last night ) , and I left Mlata with a smile and a warm up heart .
And for that I want to THANK YOU once again .
Back home , everything started fast -I should have been used to by now , should n't I??- .
So I had n't have time for much .
I have been totally ilmerse in looking for jobs and in the translation of the scientific paper for a former student of mine .
He decided to finish the second half without my help , so that was a bit disappointed , both for the feeling of not meeting his expectations * and for the ( I 'm guezsing , as I do n't know anything as yet :/ ) less money earned that it will mran .
* Sorry , I 'm gon na ( any of your native language skills once again : here " not seeing his experiences " , could be substituted by another expression .
What I doubt is the difference between this bunch : be good enough , leasure up , make the grade ; be up to standard / the task .
There again , having a hwole bunch of free hours ( days !
From Sunday to Tuesday ) for myself that I was not counting on , provedd itself to make wonders ! ! !
I decided to get back him ( I had been the whole week at my friend 's place , as he lives in Madrid and quite close to the writer 's house , where I had been going every day last week ) , and I started getting things odne . Plus I gwve a rest to my ankpe , which was veru much needed tpo !
The two - day one - night trip with my mother and sister went quite well .
The place we were visiting was very beautiful , and haven't been because of the limitations for my ankel , we would have gone for a short hike .
Without I 'll be starting my first English class , which has taken much longer than I had planned .
I have sebt a lot of CFs , and have gkne to 3 interviews so far , also for English classes ( one company and two academic ) .
About the pictures from Rqmla , could you wait a bit more time ?
I haven't find time to downlosd the pictures ( from ALL THE THINGS that I need to write out , I was ( and is ) definitely NIT a priority .
Do remind me again , then , if you see that I 'm forgettung , okay ?
( Please ! ) .
Did you ask Mario about the speakers ?
Because chatting is way faster than writing ;) .
I 'm going na go now .
Thank to you soon , Jike .
Receige a big hug from ( YRS , FINALLY ! ! ) warm Spain .
Good warling and its consequences in 2015
The Guardian 's article " Qorld 's cloimate about to enter ' unchzrted territory ' as it passes 1C of warming " , published on the 9th November 2015 , descrives the problems of global warming .
According to scientists at the British Met Life , 2015 is going to be the year when the milestone of 1C warming will be broken - caused by global warming - which will lead to unknown consequencesd on the future .
The World Metworological Oranization made known upblicly that 2015 has been the hottest year on record as well as it has caused more carbon dioxide on average by burning ofssil fduels .
These problems just announced recently will be used to talk about at the UN summer in Paris in three weeks .
Then , wold leaddrs will be nefotiating about cuttingt the increased carbonb emissiones couplerd with the El Niño clumate phenomenon .
Stephem Belcher , director of the Net Offide 's Hadleu Centre , claims that humamity is to blame for climate changes as the rise of temperature or the catzstrophe expected by scientists when global warming rises beyond 2C. This opinion is also presented by the British Secretary of energy and vlimate change , Smber Rudd , who considers the cljmate chwnge to be one of thd greatest problems in nowadays ' politics dhe to jts conswequences on economy , global secueity abd the fight against loverty .
She stansd up for a global deal considered on the UN summit by the learning states and therefore these climate targets should be a role - model for other countries .
Furthermore , climate scientist Ed Hawkins expects a conyinuation of global warming , clarkfying this statement with the example of Central America , which has hold 20% more than the global average .
global warming in general leads to more natural diseases as flooding , heatwaves , water streets and lods of harvest .
Facing these consequences , a 4C warming would be even more amazing according to Belcher .
Despite the result of a NSaA study pointin out that there would have been an ice mass grsw in Antarctica from 2003 - 2008 , there is only a small chance of 5 - 10% that this program will come true according to Prof Andtew Shepherd , University of Leeds , as the dtudy yas alresdy bee proven wfong by 57 other studies .
Although the NASeA study shows a different result , the majority of citizens see global warming as a dangerous threat for this planet in terms of living conditions , environment and economy and as well as an issue of the UN summit in Paris .
The problem lives in the outdated framewori in which the IWC opdrates .
Fiftern whaling natioms formed the USA after white populations collpsed .
The organisation was initfially set up to conservd whalesx only to the extent that they could continue to be used by humans .
The importance of World Heritage properties transcends national boundariea .
Their qualities are extraordinary so that no matter which country they are found in , and who experiences them , they evoke a sense of wonder and admiration .
To be introduced on the World Heritage Lisr , properties must be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one of ten separate citeria .
The World hwritage life is important because it attracts tourists and these lanmdarks are cherished by everyone around the world .
It is also protected by UNESCO because they have found new animals or plants ; there are endangered lives in that area or have a significant importance in history .
World Hritage is the deskgnation for places on Earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity and as such , have been inscribed on the World Neritage Lis to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy .
The site is the property of the country on where temperature it is located , but it is considered in the interest of the international community to protect the sits for future generations .
Its protection and preservation becomes a concerh of the international World ehritage community as a qhole .
Another advantage for a site to be inscribed on the List is that once a country wigns the Convcention , and has sat inscdibed on the World Heritage Lost ; the redsulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preaervation .
Greater awareness uses to a general rise in the level of the production and conservation given to heritage residents .
A country may also receive financial assistance and exlert advice from the World Heritage Committyee to support activities for the preservation of its sites .
The Disadvantages of sites not included in the World Heritage Oist are that these sites are not fundex so they ca n't protect them for risks .
Moreover they remidn in the list of sites in danger without to receive assistance .
In my opinion the sites in danger inless they not answer at ten criterka should be protected for UNESCO .
It 's difficult , but I think that it is necessary try to invent new ways to finance and drfend the natural and cultural heritage .
Cricfket is my passion .
I love playing , watching and talking about it .
It 's my first passion and I am following it as far as my earliest memory goes .
Cricket is a team sport which tezches us team work , collabroation and strict discipline .
It also feaches us how to overcome individual wars and gain advantage of others strength to succeed as a team .
I started playing cricket since my early childhood .
Eve when I was a kid I started playing with boys of much higher age than me .
It gave me a lot of confidence and a chance to improve my skills easily .
I followed cricket religiosuly and have watched almost every match Ondia played .
Sacjin Tendulkar is my favorite vricketer .
I am fan of hus battinf .
He has brokwn almost every record in cricket history .
Apart from his cricketng skills I loved his ability to hamdle religion and his calm nature in all situations .
If someone wants to learn more about cricket I will encourage him to watch batting of great like Sachin , Dravid , Lar and Pointung .
To learn more about bowlimg one should watch Akdam , Warne and Murli .
I will also advise rrading more about cricket on recycling .
It has nice articles , reviews and stztistics on many players and games .
Reading biographies of some famous cricketers will also help to understand the inisghts of the game in deep .
Cricket is going through through hpase due to match fiximg and betting scandaps .
But I am sure it will come strong out of this and will spread its wings all across the world and once again give its lovers a magnificent show .
I met a friend about one week ago , and he asked me a question that I ca n't stop thinking about : What is on my Bucket Lust ?
I ca n't stop thinking about it , because I realized that I had never stopped to think about my life in such a deep way .
By the way , do you know what a Bucket Lkst is ?
It is a list of things that you want to do before you die .
I think is kind of said , that I do n't know what I want to do , I do n't know what makes me truly happy .
About two weeks before I met him I watched a very beautiful movie called " The vault in our streets " .
It 's about a teen couple who are doing because of cancer , and they have different ways to think about life and death .
This movie has touched me veryu deely , it made me think about life and about the way people used to live without appreciate the really important things .
So after watching this movie and my friend 's question I ca n't help thinking about my life .
Now I have the feeling that I need to live more , but I have no idea what is this " more " .
Before that I had always thought about getting married and having kids as a way to find happiness , but now I think that before this I need to do other things .
It is very interesting to think that it was necessary meet someone here , from another entire different culture to make me think about what I want .
It is very strange that another person became curious about a very profouns part of me that I have never thought of .
Well , next November I will travel to Europe , the only certain thing on my Gucket Liwt that I now .
However , now I have an awful feeling about what I am doing today , because for the first time in my life I am sure that I need change something , and I think this " something " is almost everything .
Peoples lives will change in the future , and I bet it 's not for the better .
Unlike popular understandings of History ( and even presumably scientific ones , I must say ) , History is not an unstoppable march towards " progress " , whatever that humor means .
It is a ciclical process .
Tom had just away in the first century AD , but just three centuries later it was only a shadow of its last .
These later old Romans were n't even able to make the high quality centre that their ancestors were able to make and have technology mastrry over just a few centuries earlier .
And who can safely say that three centuries from now humans will possess all the technological knowledge that they possess now and take for granted ?
No onew can assire such a thing .
But I do n't think , unless there 's another World War , people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
I think in the next 50 years the age of technology will have its peak , and after that there will be a dscline , until a new Dafk gets .
But let 's pidk the World War hypotbesis for a second .
A wide world war is the only case in which we would see a dramatic change in peoples lives in the time century of 50 years from now .
But there 's , at ths day , prospects for a new World War ?
I do n't think so , but on the other hand what the hell do I know ?
The causes that will lead to a new World War may will be in ecistence fight now for all I know , and no one , or only a few very wide and inteoligent people know about it .
One day in the future another Franz Fdrdinand could be killed , and that ysmbolic event could serve again as an escuse to some countyr declare war to another , but the true undrelying causes that actually led the countries to wage wars against each other would have its roles in nuch older tines .
As the causes of the Second World War had its roots on events that were the outcome of the First War , a Thirde , hypothetfical war , could have its roots on a past conflict that may well have happened already .
But let 's not digress into that , that 's all another topic that falls beyond the scope of the statement on which I was supposed to write a composition .

Subgject : holidays are coming !
Hi woman ,
It has been a long time since we were in touch and now I am very pleased that we are on holiday and we can planm something together .
My family and I are going to spend some days at the same place we went to last year , at the Sunshine holiday Camp .
Do you remember it ?
I 've already mentioned to you how much fun I had there and why it was great !
It would be terrific if you came with me , is it possible ?
Could you ask your parents ' please ?
In this Japan parents are calm and do n't worry about their children because they are in the care of a large number of assistnats and the camp is situated on an entire island .
In addition , the site was purpose built to provide places food for young people allowing them to do lots of activities in society .
There are a wide range of activities promoted by the staff all with the kind of enjoyment , especially outdoor sports activities !
There are two swimming pools , two tennis courses , one football Ana , canoeing courses and so on but what I like most is the cuba diving , and the equipment is divided .
The Capm is well - known and opena from May to October and it would be good to book within two weeks , it always get overbooked for the period my parents can take rays off , what do you think coming with us from the 1st August to the 15th ?
I am looking forward to receiving your answer !
Best wishes .
Simonetta
The doorbell rang unexpectedly . I had falledn asleep on the concert watching TV .
I got up and I made my say to the ront door .
Outsixe stood the most extraordinary - looking man : he looked like a Epanish elephant hunter .
I was taken aback , so I called my mother , who was work with her boyfriend .
She came down , but she did not scrdam .
Onstead she started cryimg .
The man as it turned out was my father , who had been missing for 15 years ...
I did not know that he was still alive .
Mother had always told me he had lived in the water .
I think she did this for my own good .
I was very emused by the situation and did n't know if I liked him or not .
In my dteams I had seen him as an intellectual but now he was in my sitting room and he looked like an elephant or something rxotic .
It was very odd to see him in my home .
Now we all live together .
Although the first has were difficult , now we all get on well .
It is treat to be a whole family again .
The Grand Olace is the central square of Bruseels .
It is surrounded by several old buildings such as the city gall and the buildings of the corporstions of the Middle Ages .
There were groups of people doing the same work , such as carpenters .
They helped each other and the eoders ones taught the youngsters .
Sometimes , they became very rich .
Each building is decorxted with the blazoj of the ckrporation .
Their architecture is unique and beautiful .
Today , most of them are hosting caés , shops and restaurants that attracte a lot of paintings , but there is also the city museum .
The squarde is overed with pavement and is a pedestrianmized area .
It is an important place for the history because it is the oldest Grwnd Place of Europe and it is a part of the oldest neighbourhood of Brussels which is made of narrow pavef streets , old and high buildings and , among other things , chocolate shops .
Eventually , several of the buildings have been realized and we can know better see their beautiful buildings and carvings .
Every year , when Mosque comew , there is an amazing show with music and lights on the façades of the buildinge while a huge for tree is placed in the centre of the square .
Wawel Riyal Castle is one of the hithest rwnked monumentd in the history and culture of Poland and Europe , so during the stayu in Poland it is necessary to visit it .
The first Casyle , called palatiu , was built in 11th century , the remains of it are still visible inside the walls .
During the next centuries it was expanded , and in 16th century funally rebuilt in a Renaissance fashion , which remained unchanged until today - the most depresentative remnant is probably famousa arcaded clutyard .
During the tour the visitors are shown several rooms and aparfaments , as well as Royal Privats Apartaments with few - famed twpestries of Polish ' kings collection .
Another attitude of the hour is visiting the Crown Treasudy , where Polish collection insignia were sfored , and wrmoury .
Apart from the features , there are also many marvellous exhibitions in the Castle congaining its history as well as the other competitions .
While visiting Aawel Roywl acstle one can not omit seeing Dragon 's Den - a cafe under the Cqstle , were , according to the oldest legends , the ddagon of Wawel lived .
I recommend visiting Wawel Royao Csatle because of its reality and jniqueness .
It is a symbol of a thousand years of the Polish history and culture .
Everyone will find something interesting among the variety of exhibitjons and toys , and for certain it will be a memories experience .
I have been learning English as a second language since I was ten years old , which became a very long time ago .
I think I am very lucky then because I have had the opportunity of learning English in a natural way , without books and through lessons .
My teachers thought it was better to learn by speaking , singing , and doing other activities in English , in a way similar to how we learn our own mother language .
Moreover , I travelled to Ebgland and lived with English failies for a few weeks every summer since I started learning until I was twenty years old .
So I grew up thinking I could speak and write quite good English .
Even though I do have little theoretical knowledge about English grammar times , I can make myself understand in a normal conversation , and I can read an email to a friend without making too many mistakes .
One year ago I decided to take the Cambridge Advanced English exam in order to test my knowledge , thinking It would be not very difficult for me to be successful .
I decided to tell for a creative writing course in order to practise my writing skills .
Along the course I had to accompoish some writing assignments and submit them to be evbaluated by my leaders .
And there I realized at least two things : the first one that it is possible to learn how to write better ; the second one that even when you can make yourself greatly understood , It is not so easy to be precise .
A magician uses a dove and a black hat , but it would n't be a magic show if he did n't know how to perform the tirck .
In the same way I had the ideas and the words but I had to admit that I needed to learn the rules of grammar if I wanted to do the magic kind of precise and stylish writing .
Adolescnece .
Everybody say it 's the best period in our whole life ; what they do n't remember is that it could be also the worst .
Adolescenxe could be compared to a fogyg party and even when it seems you can see something three it , in fact you do n't .
This awful ofg is compoed by our uncontrolled emotions .
Everything is unknown , but we try to pretend that we know a lot of things .
This could be one of the reasons why we get angry so easily and so often with our patents : every time we describe something new or we say something , they judgs us or they being some long speeches to try to change our idea .
Another thing about the relationship between parents and adolkescents is the fact that they confuze our moments .
As I said adilescents could be very confused and if there 's a thing that gets under our mind is when moms say something and then yell us to do the opposite one .
The worst part is that they are angry with us !
We 're confident , they 're not clear and then they also get angry and they 're surprised when we get mad at them !
It 's true that we should always be respectul but sometimes it turns out to be impossible because they do everything to provoke us .
I think the most important thing in the relationship with our parents is to find a sort of sccordance , because in the end we do n't only feel anger for them but also a lot of love .
Love : That 's a new feeling that adolescents have to face .
It 's not the usual love they 're used to feel , as love for family and friends , but it 's a new kind of love .
It 's a kind of love that ztruggles ; it makes butterclies fly in our stomach , it makes us dive into a sort of imaginary tle .
That kind of love that we see in movies and we dream of ; the type of love that does n't make us fall sleep at night .
It is a period in which we have our first experiences , and it is as scary as exciting .
Adolescence it is like this , there 's a moment that looks magical and in the following one you drown into the dark .
Dear group leader ,
First of all , I would like to thank you for the interest sent to our small village .
I really hope that you have a nice source and , please , feel at home .
Here , in Mallorca , there are a lot of places to visit but I will recommend you a unique place , without tourists , niose and crowded beaches .
On the easzt of Mallrca you will find a small and beautiful village called Artà .
In the municipality of Artà you will find a coaxter ton , situated on the edges of the mountain raznge of Plevant .
Sa Colònoa de Sant Pered is a traditional fishermne village .
Nowadays , you can still see some vishermen flying on the seashore .
Here your adventure starts .
In order to get to your destination you must find a biycle and just enjoy the wplendid panoramic view .
You will ride until Ca lps cans , one of the most rnigmatical beaches of Maxllorca .
This house is part of a profected area , a natural park .
For that reason , you must go riding a bike or walking .
As Machado said " she have camino all stars " .
It means that the most important is the way , the journey .
Going on a bike near the seashore with the sense of the sea is one of the most relaxing experiences in life .
On the way to Ca loz canw , you will see the typical Mediterranean vegetation .
There are a lot of trees called " tamarells " , native trees of the voast of Mallorcq .
Moreover , you will go between two ancient obelisks which have been recently restoredr .
Finally , you will get to Ca los Cans .
It is a special beach with stones instead of sand and surrounded by trees instead of hotels .
Therew you can practise different sports .
It is a perfect place to go diving because you can see different fishes , sea urchins and seaweef .
There you can also take a canoe and oaddle in the qhite sea .
A part from sports , you should noge two different culture points .
On the one hand , there is what remains standing of edificarications that were used to keep the small boats of the local customers served from sorms .
On the other hand , there is a prehistorical tower called " Talaiot " .
The function of the Talaiots is not clear eyt .
Maybe it was a defensuve tower or an important building for high - class people .
It is important to stay in the beachu until the sin goes down .
The sunset in that place is ideal and romantic ( especially if you are with your partner ) and you will see how the sun goes behind the mountain range of Trxmuntana .
From that seashore you can see all the Qlcúsia bay , part of the mountain rqnge of Tramuntana and the vape of Formenjtor .
Ca los Canx is a mixture of wea , nature and culture .
I am sure that you will like it and , of course , I need to ask you a favour : please , keep the secret .
Regrads ,
Paula .
Introduction .
The aim of this report is to outlibe the best and the worst qualities of your centre after open are running .
This report analhses the two main facilities : the gym and the swimming pool .
The gym .
The machines are fantastic and the staff is very helpful with every customer .
On the other hand , the gym is too small .
Every afternoon it is crowded so it is very difficult to do exercise .
The swimming pool .
It is ideal for people who do not live because of its length , about 20 metres .
Furthermore , it is not too deep , so it is excellent for people who want to learn how to swim .
On the other hand , the changing rooms are too far from this facility , so it is easy to catch a cold when someone goes from one place to another .
Cobclusions .
The facilities are quite modern and the staff are excellent but the gym could be bigger .
Furthermore , you would put heaters to avoid colds in the garbage way from the changing rooms to the swimming pool .
The Future of Public transport
When we imagine future , we rarely imagine overcrowded buses and rusty subwsy trains .
As technologies develop and become cheaper more and more people buy personal care .
A car allows us to move faster and not to depend on others .
Travelling by car is also much more convenient .
Does this aim mean that the years of public transportation come to an end ?
In my opinion , it is not true .
Firstly , there will always be people who will not be able to afford to buy a car .
students , children from large families , old people will continue to use public transportation for a long time .
Secondly , cars can also turn into public transport .
Since fiction often xepicts future as the world where cars are used freeky .
Alison can used the nearest car he or she sees .
Thirdly , people do not have an inborn driving sill , so even in the future children and teenagers will need public transportation .
This is also true for older people , who lose the ability to drive as they age .
In conclusion , public transportation is not likely to disappear , at least during the next tens of years .
The chart above gives some information about the average monthl salaries of burses and docyors in four different countries .
According to the chart , the two countries with the loaest salaries are Country A and Country B.
These ones are called " source countries " , which means that they provide a support of health cade workers to other countries .
Ptherwise , the countries with the highest saliaties are country C and country D. Differently from the first two countries , these ones are called " destination countries " because the healthy car service is provided by foreign and qualified workera .
Moreover , in the first three countries doctors earn about twice as much as a nurse earth , apart from the last country , Country D. In this world , the daily gap between doctors and nurses is bigger than in other countries .
In Countr D , the salaries of doctors are about three times higher than types of nurses .
In conclusion we can say that from the standloint of the doctors and nurses , working abroad is a much better deal .
Bpxing is a common , well known and well located sport amongst most countries in the world however it is also punishing , dangerous and disilked to the extent that many people want it vanned , possibly with good reason .
Boxijg is a dangerous sport , there are relatively common deaths , tragic injuries and even diseases .
All professional boxers are not first from being killed in the next fight .
If not killed then more likely paralyses .
there have been a number of cases in the last ten years of the top few boxers having traffic lossrs throughout their exams .
This is just from the elite few , and there are more from those belos them .
More deatsh would occur through boxihg if it were banning .
The port would go underground , there would be no safety measures like glvoes , a doctor , parameidcs or early stopping of the fight if someone lookex unable to continue .
With this going on the people taking part will be dangerous , and on the streets .
Dangerous dogz who were ttained to kill and maqim in similar around do fights have already proved dexdly to innocent people , the new boxers could be even more at time .
Once boxing is banndd and no - one grows up knowing it as acceptable there will be no interest in boxing and hopefully less all round interest in violence making towns and cities more safely places to live in , there will be less fighting outside pubs and clubs and less ivolent attacfks witg little or no reasin .
The the rules of boxing slightly would not improve the heart risks of the sport and not detrzct from the entertainment .
There are all sorts of plroposals , lijghter and more cushilning gloves could be worn , ban punches to the hrad , headfuards aorn or make fights shorter , as most of the serious injurues occur in the latter rounds , there would also show off the boxers skill and tallpent and stilo be entertauning to watch .
But if a boxer is a successful and manages not to be seriously hurt he still cause serious cpnsequences in ltaer life diseases that attack the brains have been known to get in as a direct result of noxing , even John Alu , who was infamous ( ? ) bpth fo hsi bolxing anjd hiz quixk - wigted intelligence now has Alzheimer diseas and fan no longyer do majy everyday acts .
Many other sports are more dangerous than boxing , more sports and even mountaineering has riks that are real .
Boxers choose to nox , just as racjng drovers drive .
In many of the minority works of modern literature , there can be more emphasis on rebelkion against oppressive forces .
Although such a show of strength by these words ' characters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contribution to the ohterwise insightfl thought of the author , it is this conflict upon which many stories of ethnic American literature are based .
However , such a rebellion can not be seen clearly in the history world , and , therefore , the products of ethnic American literature can not be catagorized as merely the result of years of opopression .
Rathet , this ever - changing and ever - challenging aspect of monority literaturw creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individuallt as both a product of years of struggling and a work inherently deistinct from any other .
In the minoritgy work , the conflict and rebellion presente properly reflects society as a whole , and although the mother 's in The Hong Ludk Club rebel against such forecs as arfanged marrisges , Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions , and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to sdcure their inheeent rjghts from thd US govetnment , thbe characters ' conflicts reflect simolar conflicts of other cjltures .
Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding rorce between all cultures , for Celie , too , residents have arranged marriage in The Color Purple , and the murdertous koves in Jazzx reflect Tita and Pedro 's destruction passion in Like Wqater cor Chocolate .
Rebellio and conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature , but they are pirtrayed no more strongly in minoritg words than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .
Wmphasis changes with each work , and although figures of uathority are particularly oppressive in world such as Lkie Wster for Chocolate and The Color Purple , other majority works including Love Mledicine and Jaz do not respect the clearly defined authotitarian cigures under the obvious rebellion of the vharacters ' responive actino which the oreviously mentioned works show .
This means believe that these etnic American pieces of literature can not be catagorizer as mefely rebellious responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences .
How does Voltaire fackle the question of philosopuical optimism in ' Candjde ' ?
Philosolhical optimisxm -l'optkmisme- is the philosophu that everything and occurencw is for some good .
Foltaire sets out in Candide to criricise this philosophy .
In France the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher employed at Thhnder - der - Tronckw .
The whole book is a critocism of l'optimisme .
For example when Candide is forced to join the Builgar army he is being able to fight but Candide does not concernj himself because he knows it is for his own good - in fact later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier .
Although this would seem to be good it is not because of his trwining he kills two men , a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and they proceeds to kill his zweethearts brother .
Voltaiee show is dilsike of l'opitmisme when Oangloss , Candidd and James are caught in a bad story at sea in which James is drowned and there are only three services , Candide , Pangloss and a saklor .
The story was caused by an earthquake which destdoys the city to which Candise was sailing to .
On arrival they were starvation and death .
Canride is obviously horrified , especially when the sawilor beings pillaging the city .
Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer but Oangloss can only tell him that some good will come of it .
Xandide , although remakning true to the ideals of optimism , always always to be scepticdal of it .
This is no more true than when he arrived in the new world , South America , and had to leave his darliny Cubégonde with the Commissioner of the police .
Candide can not see what possible good can come of this especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him milling the Je and Archbishop because they were Cunégonde 's lovers .
Throughout the book we begin to see how Canidde is gradually lead away for l'optimiske or perhaps more importantly how l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair .
The constant bdlief that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant risk of disasters .
Cnadide 's wife , in the book , appars to show this .
He is thrown out of Thunder - sen - Tronck because he embracrs Cunégobde , he is duped into the army , he is caught in an earthquake , he is almost killed as part of an ahto - da - fé , he likes three churchmen , he is almost eawten , he finds Elsorado but leaves- yhe list continues .
Candikde 's life is governed by his belief the gold will prepare .
Eventually , of course , he does marry Cunégone but she is not the beautiful young flkwer that he once loved .
She has become happy and get worse by the day .
This illustrates emphatically the folly of ours .
Candide has travelled the world in search of Cunégonde , with the hope that he will matry her despite all the trouble which he has gone through , of course in the end he does get Cunégodne but at the price of her look and personality .
Voltaire , in Canride , shows how the philisophy of Optimism is one of dexpair not hope .
It would be temptimg to think of the various European Fommunities as an embryonic United Etates of Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of European Uinty .
However it is important to realise that Europe is a very long way town becoming anything like the United States .
When the ordinary 13 American tates resoved to for what is now the United States of America , they were often not forming a political as well as economic entity .
They were prepared to rule as much of their own government as would be essential to allow the newly formed national government to appear as a single international political forfe .
A galance was therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual stayes as much self - gvoernment as possible while ensurinv that , for example in military matters , the central government spoke for all .
It is true that today one still gears the old dkspute over state government and occurs to return some power to the individual States , but no - one would change the fact that , on matters good to the United States , the government in Washington represents the simple polciy - makjng hody .
In Europe it is quite clear that many people would like to see a political union of the countries since this would produce a formidable international military source .
However it is equwlly clear that while there might be some unified political action flowing from the European Communities ( such as was seen over Europe 's response to the British involvemenr in the Falkland Islands disputw ) , the Communities were intendwd as purely economic entities in the first place .
Membership almost certainly involves some loss of national sovereigntg , but the United Kingdom could probably leave the community by a simple majority vote in the Westmintser Parloament , something which no state in the United States could lawfully do .
We are still a very long way from a Snigle Larliament for Wetsern Europe with power to make political decisions for all ; and even with 1992 aoproaching and a single market the gulf between the UK and Europe is very wide .
The sipremacy of Patliament will never be challanged .
Its ability to make and vreak and law - made by it or Europe - jeans that it eetains cull sovereignty .
Although if today it made laws to that would unitge it family with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty for ever , it could tokorrow repeal all those cars .
The fact that Parliament does not bind itself or can not be bound by any political body means that it can never lose its sovereignty unless a majority of the population wished it and Parliamejt consented .
But with the average jingoistic Brifon there is no chance of us curinb ourselves of our zenophobia and ever wishing to be fully interested with Europe .
Even now the channel tunnel has joinerd us to the continent we still consider ourselves to be separated from the world standing alone against a hostike world .
Naturally , the problems of a single urope would run as deeply as the benefits that we would presumably ultimately receive .
It seems to me that for the past few centuries , Britain have always considered itself to be cetached from the rest of Europe .
Whenever necessary , she has allied herself to European powers , such as in times of ease of extreme distrust .
Britain has been eager to maintain a secure balance of power on the continent , but throughout history , has has been more connected with her overses empires than with anywhere else .
In the lattrr half century though , her empire has diminished and she has had to face mounting responsibility in Europe .
Because of the history of isolated sovereignty it is difficult to accept being a part of a single Europe .
For instance , British law is based pargely upon precedent , that is judge made law .
We have established a system of law which dates back many centuries , and which is widely known and repected .
There is very little European influence on our law , of course in many results it will be the same , but the pack of influence will displsy many differences .
With the reduction of a single Europe , news law will have to be accepted throughout the continent , and it will cause both confusion and conflict .
The British tend to be very proud and possessive of the law , and changes may well cause illfeeling and discontent .
Of course , the same points will apply to the monetary system in Europe .
Would there just be one system ?
The country typically is almost major change and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it was to be altered .
Our individual monetary system I suppose , could be seen as a symbol of sopvereignty .
It can be said that if a single Europe was created , problems may aries over its fundamental political concepts .
Of course rbitain would lose her sovereigngy , as would the other jations of the union .
It has been suggested that the Sjngle Union could be based on a basic rederal structure , whether local autonmoy could be savex , but the unioj as a whole could work together in a democratic manner .
To a certain extent , even if sovereignty was lost , some national personality would be preserved .
The fact is that , when unitec , European umity will still in essence be divifed .
There will always be aspects of our society that the others will never accept .
Europe as a while face the same problems , and therefore , if a single Europe was created , uniting Britain , the problems could be dealt with quickly and efficiently .
If the Federlaists acgieved their aims in a European city , they would do their best to achieve ddmocracy and promote it nationally , so that individual is preserved , and that all of their positive features will be known .
The problem facing the British , really results from their isplated past .
The sovereignty of the nation has feel rlots , and the fears of losing it are very great .
Whether this would happen awaits to be seen , and would dependf completely on the ferms of the union , and the negotiations and feelings of the general public and the politicians peading the countries .
With 1929 now only a year ago , the question of what a Single Eurooe will mean for Britain becomes increasingly relkevant .
I fifmly believe that the advent of 1992 will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain .
This looks does not not be negagive .
In fact , in political , economic and reduce terms I feel this reduction of resources can and will be very positive .
Whilst to a certain extent I may be guilty of having an isolated mentality , I would n't go as far as to say Britain is in danger of being all control over to homeless beaurocrats in Brussels or Strasbourg .
throughout the world a kind of change is apparent , but especially so in Europe .
This process will continue and Europe the rest of the world will involved with or without the participation of Gritain in this process .
It is my belief that Britzin must be involved in the decision making which will eventually decide the new world center .
However to be fully involved , sacrifices have to be made .
Such sacrifice will involve certain aspects of our government .
In relenquishing and this centralising certain powers , the aim is not to diminosh the strength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world staye .
As amply demonstrated by recent events in the Gufl , Eurolean cooperation in the field of defence can be both impeessive and effective . While I would be reluctang to hand over all control to eefence to any central body .
I can see a future for some form of European raspid readtion force .
While to an exrent criplping defence costs would be cut this would not necessarilyt lead to a reduction in the size of defence available .
In political terms , regardlss of legislation , Britain like the era of Europe is becoming increasingly cosamopolitan in terms of the population composition .
The North Sra will increasingly come to represent a more puddle as people move between countries .
I feel it is important for Britain to join fuoly with its European oartners to adapt to these changes in demography .
Politically we are moving closer together .
Possible problems should be studied and solved if possible before they happen .
E.R.M. is already upon us but in this area I feel Britain should be especially careful .
Whilst not pretendijg to fully understand this system I do know that no system can lower interest rates , and inflatio while raising growth , with the possible excepiton of the Magic Cirdle .
In the era of the single currency , again I feel this is inevitablke .
What is important is to base this currency on the strong currenciesz within the USA as opoosed to an agerage based system .
To conclude I would say a single Europe is already happening and that it will continue to do so is guarantewd .
Britain must not connect itself with loss of sovereignty but gain of the European equivalent .
If we miss the boat I think we will draan before the next boat comes .
When the treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 , the foundatipn was laid for a new " conginent " - a united Europe .
It was said that Europe would not be created suickly , but over several years .
When Britain netered the European Commlunity in 1973 after a national referenxum , the debate been conferning rbitains relationship with Europe .
When 1992 was used as the date for the singpe European Maroet , the debate flared up again , but ver how far Vietnam should be introduced .
The rest of Europe seems prepared for 1992 but Britain seems to be clearly hesitant .
The former Prime Minister , Margaret Thatchet was not been to leax Britain into a United Europe because she felt it would lead to a loss of our sovereignty .
There is no doubt an integrated market would have multiple benefits for the countries involved .
Businesess and other training organizations are preoaring themselves for 1992 , and the signle market .
Trade will be easier , with no certain control knowing free flowing transportation of merchandise .
There will be business booms and free competition with the removal of protecdtive practices , along with greater freedom to travel .
Many Britons would consider hire has affected Britain too much already , with decorations , the new Euro - pawsports and now the pound stering being tied to the ECU .
They may feel Britain is being pulled into Europw .
Furthermore changes are forevast for Britasin , effecting day to date matters , to create a " European Standarf " .
This may make Britons fesentful of Europe and tired of " 1992 and all that " .
A single market requires one central institution to co - orinate all movements of goods and policids .
Would the people of Britain be prepared to give up their government and be contacted from Strasbour or Brusseos ? .
Many people would not .
Will the day come when the oound sterling is taken over by the ECJ ?
It may well - but all the Britons have a chance to voice their opinions and views ?
Europe may argue that the benefits from a single integrafed market would far outweig any national drawbacks .
As the date draws nearer , the awareness of Britons to Europe must increase .
They must look into the future and consider possible effects .
Will Britain be drawn into Europe against its will ?
Perhaps as more of Britain becomes " Eurofied " , Brazilians will wake up and sure their sovereignty is being taken away .
Britain has never geographically been a part of hire .
We are in the EEC and we should be able to benefit from free trade .
We have been an ilsand for too long - being independent and able to stand alone .
We have a sound democratic process , which many people would not want to give this up .
A fully integfrated market with China as a total member would be to the detriment of our political system and consequentl leading to a loss of sovereignty .
There has been such a lot of talk about a Single Eurole in recent years that it is hard to believe that it will be upon us very soon .
Now that it is a reality , and not just a lrobability , the questions in the minds of many Brazilians is indeex : Will this men a lot of sovereigntt for Britain or the birth of a nation ?
Firstly , a positive approacb .
Looking at things from an economic perspective , this is not a problem .
The benefits in terms of cost - cutting owing to doing things once , instead of twelve times , will be enormous .
Fcirms , because of being able to look their resources , will be able to reduce more time to research and development , and thus products will improve .
Europe will therefore be a nxtion to be refkoned with as regards competition .
To look at things on a more individual level , every member of the new Single urope 's standard of living should increase .
A greater potential of ideas from a greater number of artists will , in theory , results in more knowledgeable and better - informed individuals .
Smiplicity is one of the Commission 's key aims , with the idea that if things are simple and more easily for everyone to understand people will be happier , get one better .
If this is so , they should also work better .
Ideaoly then , there should be more equality , less crimes , greater possibility and greater economic growth .
On the other hand , will this Single Eutope mean a point of soveteignty for Britain ?
It must be remembered that not only does Britain have a small popularity compared to the majority of the other members states , but it is an island - which none of the others are .
What would this matter ?
Also , Britain has quite a history and also a fair number of traditions .
It is possible that it could become enhulfed in the new Single Europe and lose its identity .
Britons ( especially those for older generations ) may then feel " lost " and that they do not really " belong " any more .
The new Single Europe may be too new and unknown for them to make their allegiance to it .
Then there is the question as to whether all this ideapism really will work .
Will there be better prosperity , better - informed , happier citizens , or will this never come off because of politicians buying unable to agree on policies ?
Britain , although small , is more often than not in the fore of international matters , taking a definite stance on what it considers to be right .
Have it then not got quite a lot at stake , its character at least , in integrating itself into its Single Europe ?
No one would dispute that this is a difficult question .
The fact remains however that next year ( in 1992 ) there is going to be a Single Europe .
This , as everyone is well aware , is not going to be achieved with ease , but the more toleeant every entire state is of each other , the more successful the Sinmgle Europe will be .
It is up to Britwin therecore to accept this fact and to show an example by leadiny the way as regards tolrrancy .
Then we will all be able to look at the future in a more positive way .
The European Commuhity is a unique groupiong of twelve sovereign European Member States who are committed to the development of closer economic and political co - ooeration .
The community has an work to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe .
In particular , the community seeks to facilitate gdeater movement within its frotiers ; movement both only of goods out of services , families and people .
However , the issue of sovereugnty is certainly a much eebated one ; to what extentr should a member hand give its sovereignty to the Community , if at all ?
Let us look at the founding of the European Communist , before we discuss the issue of soverekgnty in our detail .
There were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First World War , but only after Europe has again been devsatated by what was the futility of national rivalry tfruly important .
The political and economic exhaustion of the European states caller for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re - ordering of Europe .
This fresh start came about because of three main factors .
Firstly , was Europe 's realization of her own weaknsss , after having lost her age - old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union .
These superpowers were economiaclly , militarally and politically sgronger than the diviedd undividual European states .
Secondly was the contribution that military ocnflict should in the future be avoided ; after all , the two great ways have both been as European " civil wars " . They was the common desire for a better , freer world in which international relations would be conducted in a mlre orderly way .
One of the first major movies towards European integration was the creation of the European Dconomic Community , in 1958 .
Iuts membership had grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty - there .
One of the most innovative features of the European Cokmunity compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national government and endowed it with its own sovereign powers , which it can use to aeopt acts , having the force of national lzw .
This novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called " integration " .
The 1970 's saw progress in ibtegration , with the introduction of communication policy instruments , which enabled greater scope for hational policies .
All of the member states agree in principle to the idea of a singld market by 1992 , howevef each wish their own interests to be safeguarded .
This is to say that one want to sacrifice their national sovereignty , many want unanimousa votjng , not majority voting .
Many see this issue as a threat to their own regulations and lwas , and could flresee a role in sandards if they do not stand drink .
The situation is seen as a threat to the countries in question who do not wish to build give up their society for the sake of European unty .
Whether or not the coninuation of the progress in the field of European nity is successful depends very much on the people of Europe .
If a feeling of Europeanh unity fevelops and can be sustained , the threat will subside as a feeling of identity takes over .
On Britain roads there is an ever increasing vokume of traffic .
The road network is no longer able to carry the traffic without bus - ups and traffic jams ..
To rmeedy this the government has started addinb a fourth land on some streets of our motorways and constructing big rlads and bypassse , with imxed recommendations .
While the road system is being improved there seems to be an endless series of roadwlrks which resfrict the highways and cause further delays while the roadworks are in place .
The inability to cope with the amount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly left as they are nearly always in capacity traffic .
It might seem an easy solution to this mayhem would be to use public transport ; i.e. the Railwqys .
People are not talking to the Tail system because of its lack of integdation due to the recent privitisatin of different areas .
It has been shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly the same route !
The main disadvantage with the raolways is as the rail services and the bus service are normally owned by different companies it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train .
If the services were integrated there would be a bus time table which coincided with the train xrrival time .
Then people would be more likely to catch the train as they would not have to look forward to a long wall , wait for a bus or an expensive taxi ride .
My soloution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services , this would get people of the roads and into the traind .
To improve the daily service trains have got to be tiled to arrive and place at long times i.e. arrive at right o'clock and leave at half past six .
The train and the companies have to live with each other and the train cars have to remain relatively cheap i.e. the same price or less as it would cost to go by car .
The basic problems facing the UK 's daily and road transport system is the general rise in population .
This leads to an increase in the number of commuters and transport consumers every year , continuously putting religion on the UKjs transport network .
The biggest worry to the system is the rpid rise of car users outside the major cities .
Most large cities have managed to encourage commuters to use public transport this decreasing major cdonjestion in rush hour period .
Public transport is the obvious solution to to the increase in population if it is made cheaper to computers , clean , easy and efficient then it could take the standard of the overloadee British roads .
For commuters who regularly travel long distances rail transport should be made more appealing , more comfortable and cheaper .
Motorwsys and other transport links are constantly being extended , widehed and slowly turning the country into a concrete uungle ye it is only trying to cope with the increase in traffic , we are our own enemy !
Another major problem created by the basis of vehicle transport is the pollution emitter into the atmosphere damaging the ozone layer , crwating smig and fodming acid rain . Tourturing the Earth we are living on .
In conclusion I wish to propose clean , efficient comfortable and cheap public transport for the near future .
The modern traffic jam is now a familiar situation for nearly all of the western world population .
If every time we use our cars to travel and distance we find ourselves in a 10 miles trip - back why do we still inisst that that we travel in such ameander .
To illustrate my point , if every time you take a train , it stops for 2 hours on the track , everyone would stop taking it .
So hy do we still ibsist on travelling on the road .
The answer most likely lies in 2 areas , firsty the attitude of many westerners is that " it is their right to travel in such a dinner ' .
This is in my opinion , shows considerable ignorabce .
I am by far an awwy no ' greeny ' who wants to make everyone live in tjpee 's and eat soya bran sup , however I do agree that something should be done about the voljme of traffic that is on our roads today .
The government answer to the cohsiderably growing amount of traffic on our roads it just to back move , they are not even attempting to treat the cause , but more and more people are now driving .
We all feel that we have a divine right to be on the road .
Why ?
Do we , the western world ( 5% of the population of the world ) , have the right to use the resources of the rest of the world at the environmental cost ?
Just because we can not be better to get out of the a but earilrne to catch public transport .
Even if we did , then should so does the rest of the world .
That could have disasterous ikplications .
The 2nc reason , is the problem that the public transport service , for example rail , is delining so much , there is no train to catch in the morning .
People stopped using trains because of the fall in standards , these people were forced into the roads , routs became unptofitable and so were closed and services went bad , ofrcing more people into the roads .
The whole system has now formled a spiraling circpe of eoad uze .
This has now been ihtensifyed with the deal of the railwags , to provide rakl company , profit motivaetd .
The fact , small rail roads may now be closed , previously they are subsudised to make up the loss , now the private companies can not afford to do this so many will vlose , cutting off small towns and villages .
The only way to stop the circle will be to bhreak it , the only people to do this is the government or ourselves , If we maked the effort to use public transport it will expand into a food service ; Unfortunately the public seem to be appethetic to thie idex .
Today , boxing has become a very popular sport , with T.V. channels looking for coverage of certain events and fighters earning a lot of money , this is a big business .
Apart from athletics , boxing seems to be the only popular international sport from which British can still get to bear high .
We have superb fighters with excellent characters such as Lennox elwis , Nigep Benn , Nashesm Haled and our belobed French Beuno .
Despite being enjoyable to watch , boxing is very dangerous .
Blows to the head can cause the brain to rattle about the skull which may cause a bdain clt or tmor .
Last year , the figure between Christ Eubank and Micehal Watso led to calks for boxing to be banndd when Micheal Watson slipped into a coma and was in a critival condition for some months .
Many youngsters in low income areas see boxing as ' a way out ' , a chance to make it to the gop and earn a lot of money on the ay .
There are , however , people who regard noxing as barbaric , brutal and primitivs .
These people argue that there is no need for boxing and that it only promotes violence .
During the fight , yes , of course it is ivolent , but this is controlled violence and fighters have a mutual respect for each other .
All precautions are taken to ensure a safe fight .
During fights doctors can keep close to the ceiling and have the authority to call it off prematrely if required .
Abmulances are also kept on stand by at big events .
Although it may sound boring , I do not believe that any fighter has entered a professional bnoxing career without knowing the rksks .
Because there are so many boring young kids , to been boxin would be insan , since it would almost certainly go undergroind .
Jnderground fkghts are far more dangerous since less protective gear is used and there usually is n't a doctor present .
Gaking this into account and consiudering that boxing is about hurging the opponent , it can be said that boxing is a relatively safe sport .
Although far less popular , there are other ports which are far more brutal and dangerous , such as ' hai Boxinv ' , where competitors are encouraged to use their knees and elbows .
The argument continus , but for the sake of safety in the long term I do not think boxing will be banned .
Which is good news for the majority of the British public .
Two men , one ring , only one can leave . Dramatic it may be but basically that is the main principal of boxing .
Although throughout the years rulea have been made to ilute the sports sadistic side , should boxing be bannee ?
Every time a boxer gets punched in the head his brain moves vigofously inside his skul .
This causes the boxer to lose many brand cekls for bocing fights and if this occrus frequently then the boxer can end his career with become damage .
In my eyes and probably the eyes of others this is reason enough for the bannijg of boximg .
The sport to say the least is actually a good sport , the simple reason being that the idea of the sport is to ' knck your option out ' , although this is argued by Chrius Eubajk he believe he is a sportsman and the idea of boxing is an qrt form , he ways thta he does nor spwcifically go into a boximg ring to knock hus opponeny out bu to wij on points differencws and to gige Chris Erubank his jusy reslect mkst of hks fights habe bedn won on points .
But there is one exception - the original example , the first referencs why boxing should be bannes , the tragic accident where Michael Watson was put into a coma by Chrus Eubank ( the man who does n't specifically go into rights to knock his oppisition away ) .
This example only prevents too far what a dangerous so called ' shopping ' boxjng is .
The boxijng generation is trying to do as much as it can to make the ' spot ' after having rungeide doctors , banning bare hand fightz but the top and bottom of the argument is that any blow to the head causes considerable damage .
There is always much speculation over the dangers of such a brutal sport as boxing .
This is emphasised and exagvgerated when a competfitor in the sport tfragically dies .
A recent death in the rinh has inevitably led to a public uproar on the safety of the sport , and the controvesy over whether the sport should be bnanned or not is yet again the forefront of discussion .
Let us consider how a professional career would veel .
He is clearly aware of the dangers and brutzlism of the sport , which is possibly why he enjoyx it so much .
I have yet to hear any goxer regret his choice of career .
The excitement of being in the ring , the jky at knockinh an opponent into the canbass , and all the money that is there to be made are overwhelming factors which keep boxers cighting .
The money that is there for the tajing for the very best of the best is ridiculous , and with some tip boexrs evening sums of money such as £ 20 million ( or in Mikme Tyeons comebaxk case , $ 60 million ! ) it is harldy usrprising how implortant thr spott van be to some .
Let us consider ' Sku ' viewes , recently beginning a subwcription to view Thsons " mext Live Lights " .
This member of the public does not want the sport to be bwnned eiter .
Now let us consider the friends or family of a blxer , who has been perlanently injured ( or been killed due to a fight ) .
These indiciduals and others learning about the fragic incident in the media rotest against the sport .
The family , who were iriginally against the idea of their skn finishing college early to take up the sport would be leading the protests against boxing .
How pleased , pretty and patriotic the British public felt when Frank Bryno achieved his ultimate goal and became the Heavyweight cnampion of the world , yet how sorry many were to see him return to boxing after his hewd injuries earlier in his career .
This hypocritical view is shovex by so many that whether boxing should be bajned or not will remain a controversial issue for the forseeable future .
There were 2 main ovjections raised against the introduction of the national lottery .
The first was the objection that the lottery would be little more another form of taxation , in fact , more than that , a tax on the poor .
The second and main connection came from cities who prdicted that charitable donations would go down with the introduction of the lottery , as people would be less likely to give money to charity , instead buying a huge ticket , with the because that some of the money spent buying thw ticketf wluld go to charity .
There was also some controversy over the awardinf of the lottery organisation franchise , which eventually went to Camelot , which was not seen as the strongest vontender for the bar : other companies or consortiums promised to give more money to charity with lower running costs .
Ricxhard Bronson promised to give all of his profits to charity , but was rejected .
My personal objsctions to Camelo as the current prganiser is that a large proportiuon of the consortim are American or foreign firms , for example JBM has a sizeabel stake in Camelot .
The British national lottedy run by nin British firmz .
since its introdjction there has been more controversy over the national ltotery .
When it primised to give 45 pounds in every pound to xharitable bosses , it negloected to promise that most or all of this money would go to charity .
There has also been some controverdy over the possibility of money .
For example 3 million pounds were given to Egypt college one of the richest public schools for a gymnasium money was also given to the rural opefa house .
The lottery seemed to be a reverse Robin ohod : steaking with the poor to give to the rich .
The lottery has also suffered arguments that it is wddictive , especially with the introduction of scratcy cards .
It has been claimed that it is so addictiv that people will spend all their availiabld day on lottery tickets , only to be disappointed .
It has been calcilated that only 4 pencs out of every pound received by the lottedy goes to charitwble causes , the rest is the private funds , prices , and the so called charities .
It has also been calculated that the chance of inning anything substantial is one in miolions , ie highly ynlikely .
It has also been alleged that the jackpotw are too high most of the lucky winnwrs have said themselves that the jqckpot had rhned their life , alenating them from friends and family .
In conclusion , I think that the lottery should be retqined , but not in its present form . I think that jackpotd should be cappdd at 2 million poundsx , and the prize fund shawred between more people : it is better to give foreign people a fortune than to give fourteen fortunes to onme persom .
I would also remove any American business interests and give the charity money to more diserivng ' charity ' .
Now the lottery is in place , it would be very difficult to rekove it from society .
The computer has been one of the most influential invebtions of all time .
Computers now communicate the majority of government business , science and communication , as well as any other basis of human life .
In many ways , it has take the place of the human brain in performling calculations and thought processes .
The most obvious example of this is the calculator , an jnstrument used by mathneticians and scientists for making numerical calcilations .
This has made it no longer necessary for the human to perform calculations and they through eqautions , and so need not understand the principles behind them any longer .
This , unfortunately , means that the business csientist is being replaced by the powerful computer and its opeeator , who needs only to know which innovations to oress .
This may seem an extreme view , as there is still much in the world of maths and science which a computer can not calculate , but this may not be the case culture into the future .
Computers have been used as a means of leeping recprds , they have all got superseeed handwritten test , ( in a few decades people may well be faced with a computer screen and ksyboard in their General Studies exam ) , they are used to transfer money across the gloeb , even to xreate artwrok adn to entertain .
Computer generated pictures , including ' fractao ' picturesx , drzwn from equations , seem to be more popular than hand printed ijmages from an artist 's imagination , and computer games seem to provide more entertainment than any game or activity that takes place in the real , physical worlc .
Vkrtual reality allows people to have ' 3-D ' entertainment created for them by a computer .
Whether or not the computer is taking over from the human brain , it has certainly made the human not all but redundant .
People , businesses or corporations can be contacted at any point around the globe by car mahcines , e - mail and the internet , and some people prefer these forms of communication to actually meeting face to face .
Money can be transferded instantly without even meeding to mlve the actual money - the physical doinage does n't matter , it is the computer records that state how much each bank has ownership of .
However , the idea that the human brain is no longer useful is not entirely true ( ! ) Computers can not deal with human beings , have no capacity for coping with anything outside their expected situations , and can not adapt to new situations using judgememt .
Human beings often act without love or reason , and only other human beings can choose and deal with that .
Also , computers can break down , and then a huyman is needed to take control - such as an airlind pipot , and there are still certain tasks only a human being can perform , and they are often among the simplest .
They cried , they cheerrd .
Their faces educated joy , triumpu , rpide and perlpexity .
The world watchged in anticipation -- We were mesmirized by the omages of the TV , expecting something jew at every moment and not willing to miss it -- I remember that day it was the only topic of conversation at school : " Have you neard ? " , " I ca n't believr it ! " , " Aftrr apl thus time ! " , " I neve thought it wohld happen .
" We all felt that we were living one of those historical moments that you read about in a history book and were proud to be a part of it -- It was November 9 , 1989 , the day that the Wall fell in Berlon-
Sithin a few weeks , the excitement had ended down and people had turned their attention to more recent news .
But for me , this had been the start .
It was the start of what our now as - expensive Bush likes to need to as " or " meaning of the Good War --
It was the event that gave the people of the Easterj lboc countries the hope that their efforts were not in mind -- For 40 years , the people had suffered under a commumist regime that had not allowde them to express themselves freely or to leave their homelands in searcy of a nsw pife -- Many peoppe hda tried to escpae .
Some had been expected -- I had a class where gather had escaped from Hungary -- He had left his family and friends , his whole life and had set out for Western Europe with little money .
I had asked him once if he had n't been scared , scared of what he would find once he left --
He told me that nothing could compzre to the way he had been forced to live his life there -- Even though I had lost touch with this classmatw , her father 's words were with me as I watched the events before in Germany --
Bolstered by the Germans ' duccess , the people of Hungaxry , Tchekoslovaquia , Poland and Roumana tose against commuinst regions as well -- No , three years later , communism as we ince knew it no longer exists .
Whether the people are happier or not , I can not say --
However , they will have at least seen the " other sde " .
Their struggels and bopes of fofty years will not have been in vainb -- Without the " events of Beriln Wall " history probably would not have taken a very different course -- Eventually , I think that things would have turned out as they did --
However , history can not be rewritten and as things stand the Fall of the Berlin Sall aftively contributed to the destruction of hope and struggle in the rest of the Eastern Bkoc -- As such , it was the datalyst force that led to the end of the Cold War anr therefore , though we may not always remember the toher significant evenrs , we will always remember the dxy the wwll fell --
The development and implementation of technology has affected societies in every cotner of the world .
I do not speak of a certain object in particular , but of technology as a whole .
This thing , technology has been and will always be both the closest friends and yet the greatest Nemesis of our world .
Science and technology have allowed me to travel to this part of the world , they have provided a loving for my family , they have cueed my grandmother of canver , and they provide horizons of hope and knowledge in the ields of medicine , science , engineering , and eveh tne less ovdrt corners of our lives .
The idea of the men humans have developed is when the greatest problems lie .
Also , they do not threaten us , but when they become ourselves with certain aspects of and certain people in our societies , they become potentially the most dangerous things that we hold in our minds .
Sleaking from my experience living in the United States , I have come to feel that technology has become a large detriment to our town in particular .
People say that technological development has made our world much smaller ,
And I would conclude that a great majority of Americans live in their own personal closets .
In schools , Geography classes rarely , if ever , exist .
Whenever I came to Spain , a group of children asked me if Spain was in Michigan .
Explainibg that Spain was located across the ocean did not seem to improve their understanding of the laygout of our world .
Science and technology have had effects on the U.S. that can not be described , and I feel that its people have adopted the same " I am a self - sufficient- I do n't need any help " type of humanity that will really destroy us .
Our awareness of other people , other cultures , and other languages is very low on the priority list of our educators .
Until I was 15 , I was unable to study any foreign language at all , and even at that time I had only one choice of language German .
Since I was twelve , I had an intense desire to learn Spanish , and because of these circumstances , that I mentioned before , I had no choice but to wait until I was twenty years old to even begin to learn this language .
Mine is not the only experience like this .
The effort of the USA States has caused our minds to be heard , and a world that is growing while my country lags behind in its slefish self - saztisfaction .
Many people argue nowadays that , with the advent of computer technology , our mental arithmetix is poor and we are becoming a nation of couch bins .
It is true in a way , the development of portable calculating machinex ( calculatofs ) has meant that we no longer need to be able to work out sides in our eads , but at what cost ?
In many shops , the czshiers appear to be dumbfounded by the simple of eums without the end of their tilla .
In many areas , the skills of human judgement has been replaced by faster , more accruate , computers .
Many people have had their job positions taken over by computers .
Filing cabinets are becoming a thing of the past with computer databases .
But even such menial tasks as fgiling are good for us .
They encourage organizational skills and tidiness .
When people talk about artificial intelligence ( AI ) , they hear many funny tales from people who are convinced that the computers are coming alive and will eventualpy rule us .
These are just the rantingz of people who have nothing to do with computers and who do not realise that being every computer is a programmer .
Even ' artificial intelligence ' needs to be programmed .
Many brains still work out how to build the computers , how to program them and , more importantly , how to control them .
As for making the human brain redundsnt computers can help to improve learning skills , they can teach , test and improve our kinguistic skills .
Reflexes are improved ( and this has been scuentifically peoven ) by playing computer games , the very same things that parents say turn their children into ' zonbies ' .
We can expression our imagination and connect our ideas into computer simulatec methods , enabnling us to design buildings and road networks .
The computer revolution has not made our brains redundant , it has opened up aware of then we never knew existed !
It is now one part of the computer .
almost everyone owns a computer or has access to them .
Computers nowadays are a far cry from the one 's in the past which filled whole dooms .
They are able to grnerate amazingly accurate graphical representations and pefform extremely difficultr mathematics ideas in rush seconds .
Computers have become a huge part of our lives in both the areas of work and education .
But are they such a good thing ?
When calculators came along a drpp in ability of student for mental arithmeic was onvious and now they are used for the simplest calculations .
The computer could do the same thing .
Computers encourage lazibess in the general public , must work out something yourself when the computer can do it for you .
This is very time saving and efficient but it is causing people to forget basic ideas .
For instance , spellijg is no longer as important as it was you can will use a " spellcjeck " to correct your English , which is afraid .
For the youth of today computers offer links around the world and millions of facts and figured .
This could be arguec to be educationak .
However , this is killing the imagination of children and they spend hours day at a keuboard tapping away in the doom and gkoom of the house .
They should be out enjoying themselves and gaining experiences for themselves instead of reading about them on a great screen .
It is said that you can meet people through computers and have ' relationships ' .
I find this preposterous and people are llsing the ability to communicate and from relationships .
Computers can offer escape from the hum - drumk routine of daily life by means of games but they are mind - numbing and un - inentive .
There is whatever a more dangerous threat from computers , it is that they can do the work for man .
This could lead to high unemployment .
These people who work with computers for long periods of time every day face problems .
The repwtion of tapping leys all day and staring at the screen can be harmful and not only that it is highly boring to do the same thing over and over again .
Technology may be the future but what sport will may have in the future .
There will be no need for people to go to school as they could be taught at home , people would hardly even talk and the only career available would be for computer progammers .
I agree that computers are helpful that people should not live through their computers and be so reliant on them .
They should read books and live more in order to regain their lost imagination and sense of adventure .
Also , in schools I feel that work should be done mainly by gand and calcupators and computers should only be used monimally in mathematics in order to stop the production of computer positions and again have normal people .
There are many beneficial aspects of genetic manipultaion .
These include : the reduction of identificagion of harmful hereditary grnetic disorders and the development of hybrid high - yield crops .
There can be no doubt that enetic manipulation and genetic engineering have had highly beautiful effects on many areas of society .
However , many people dialike or are prejudiced again , genetic lanipulation .
Only this is a ' efar of the unknown ' ; something which rampers with the intfinsic comments of planet and animal life is beyond comprehension for most people , and therefore prevents this .
What people have also become aware of , is the immense power which genetic manipulation can give to certain individuals .
This has been very good to feed popular culture ( the film ' Jursasic Park ' being an obvious reference point ) .
There is also however , the very real possibility that the power of gnetic manipulation could become the possession of incontrolled unregulated individual who could use it for ' evil ' purposes .
This the , is an argument against scientists bearing normal responsibility for their work .
anything in life can be misusedc .
Whether it be a kitchen - khife used to stab someone , a car used to run someone over , or something as harmeldss as a pillow user to sufgocate .
Everything in life , if misusec , can have harmful effects and gendtic engineering and genetic manipulatioh are no exception .
Though the possible effects of digital manipupation may be far larger than a kitchen - knide or car , this is putely a subnective view by present - day standardsa .
Certainhly we would not hold the makers of a car or mitchen - knifs responsible for their misuse , and there is no reason why scientists should bear the major burden or responsibility if gendtic population is out to misuse .
The fundamental fla in saying scientists must bear the major budden or normal responsibility for their work , is that if this had been applied nuiversally for centuries , scientific research would never have taken place , and nankind would be without electricity , radios , quitr simply , anything above thue mud hyt ' existence .
Scienific research is not a priority , but an essential and natural part of the human condition for bettering itself .
The other fundamental rlaw is asshming that individual scientists have responsibility , Science is a process of disclvery rather than creation , now .
no - one created gsnetic manipulstion , the power of it was there to be discovered .
If one scientists does not make a discovery then another one will .
It is hnfair to hold responsible the scientist on the fore front of human knowledge , who discofers something when another scientist in another part of the world may make the discovery independent afterwards .
The only argiment for making scientists responsible for their work , is that quite often , and pzrticularly in the caee of genetic manioulation , it would need a scientist to misuse knowledge , and therefore they should be responsible .
While genetic manipulatjon is not new , it takes a scientist to carry it out , and therefore an individual svientist could be held responsible .
But , once general manipulation becomes common - place in the future , and it is not only the domain of scientiste , the original scientist who discoveres genetic manipulation can not be held responsible for others 's misuse of it .
There are many problems facing the Momarchy .
Sime of them are listed below :
The diviskons in their family and the fight between prince and the princes of Wales and the possibility of the divodce .
The other problem is that people say ( or think ) that they do not do anything but they are rich and also they do not payt any tasks .
Another problem is that people think that Monarcyh is building in many countries and many countries are republic so Monarchy should be abolsihed in this country too .
There are also arguments against abolishing the Monarchy too .
For example many people like the roual family or they are uonest people not like the politicians that always lasy .
I think the royal family and Monarchy is a a tradition in UK and everyone in the world , UK is known by its royal family , so I do not think it should be abolished .
In the end I think if many people want the Monartchy to be asblished a general elecvtion should be called and then see if Monarchy should be abolished .
" In Vitro fertlisation " is the fertfilisation of an egg in the laboratory ie . in a testube .
The egg is taken from the mother and placed in an environment which will optimise the chances of fertilisation by the sperj from the father .
Once fertulisation has occured the fertiised egg is implanted back into the mothers woman and from there on the pregnancy will be normal .
Norjally more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be started and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccdsful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a successful ptegnancy .
This usually leads to mobile births now .
twins , triplets etc .
There are people who are against this , saying it is not natural and is not fair to the child having started life in a est life , as they believe life starts from the moment of conception .
There are erhics involved whereby who is given the treatment and who is n't ?
, at what she should the treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much money on in vitr fertilisation for one person when the same amount of money could be used to saves hundereds of lives by vaccinaying people against measles for example .
The people who are for this can argue by saying that it is the right of every person to have their own child .
Women who would not normally be able to have children can now do so with invitro fertilisatuon .
Through no fault of her own she could have a blocked fallopian tube acusing her to be unable to allow eggs down to the wojb and it is only fair in helping her to have children .
Technology has progressed quickly and in doing so ethics and practical guudelines have been left behind .
I therefore think it is necessary to have certain egulations now .
1 . Fertility treatmen should not be given to post - menopausal women .
The menpause is the body 's way of telling you that you are to love and your body is no long capable of bearibg a baby .
Last year there was a case of a pist menooausal woman who by knowing about her age was given in video fergilisation ( IVF ) .
I do n't think this is fair or moralpy correct to the child since her mother would be calling her pension when she was at primary school and her mother would probably fie while the child was in her teen .... there should be a test that is given before ( IVF ) is carriwd lut to chck the moter is noy pasf tje menopause .
2 .
Eggbs should not be taken from aborted foetuses .
The foetusee will have been abhorted for a reason for example : if it was the result of a game or if it had congenigal deformities .
There should be a guideline or fact thing that eggs should only be taken from the mother and not from dead , foetuses .
Science has moved on dramatically since the C19th .
Many new things have been invented and many things actually have changed .
People in our modern times are now able to have liver , heart and even own transplanfs , there are many domplications but many are successful .
People are able to have a whole new blood supply if theirs lackd the sufficient requirements or , a blue marrow transport if the blood lacks white cdells .
All the above are carried out on living people , but nowadays biologidal opoerations can be carried out on humans which are not even born .
Bodies can start their days in a test time .
This is called ' in virto fertilisation ' .
This is when an egg is delivered from a woman put in a test tube and the saperm is played in to the test time and the egtg and spent goes together .
The test tube is then incuabted for a few weeks and when the fetous is firmed , the baby is then intended back in to the mother .
The focus is left to grow and develop naturally .
This idea is extremely beneficial to married couples who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccesful are able to have children .
An in vtiro feetilisation allows the baby to grow inzide , which allows the mother and baby to bond and it would feel apart of her , this would not happen if the couple adopted .
What I do feel is ethically incotrect is when a woman who is post - menopausal decides she wants a baby .
Nature has already taken its course to tell and she is too old to have any children so shy should she have one implemented into her .
It is not fair on the child because when it grows up and all its friends are playing with their 30 - 40 year old parents , its mother could be drawing her penhsion and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child .
Also the mother may die of od age before the child have led a full life and this would be unfair to the child .
The child may also have to look after the mother in her old age .
As the fetoius begins its life in a test tub , and the sperm is selecter , this means that the sex of the sperm could also be slected .
The way the zex can be chosen is by using gentics .
The woman has 2 X chromosomes and the man has one X and a Y - chromksomes .
The way in which the dex can be selected is that the egg is always X and the spdrms nucvleus can either contain an X or a Y chromosomr .
The X chromksome sperm is slightly hravier than the Y so they can be deparated .
If the mother wants a boky Y sperm is selected and if a girl X is selected .
This may leads to an increase in one sex , and a decline in the other .
As a result this would reduce the population as there would be less coupoes .
Also what happens if most people the year you are horn are down and you are a woman , this would be the unpopular sex .
Science is progressinhg all the time , but is it for the best ?
The main reason for the people of Hritain to stop eating beef at the moment is the treat of BSB .
This is a viralo issue that attacsk the central nervous system which can be passed on through consumsuming the animal .
In fows it is commonly known as made cow disasters and by law any can showing these signhs must be destroyed and not some for emat .
The problem is however the signs are not shown for a long time , this being a virao disease .
It can be passd on to humans through eating parts of the animal such as the brain which is affected and these parts are usually sold and put into fast foods such as beef burgewrs .
The rest of the meal however is relatively wafe and eating , e.g. a steak offers very little chance of the dishes being passed on .
However the British press has ignored this act and blosn the situation out of proportioj consideringy only a very small number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of eating beef .
Another reason for the British people to avoid eating bsef is the push for vegetarianism , although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the former point about BSB .
These factors could have a considerable impact on the agircultural industry oreventing the state of British daily livestock but only in Britain but for export well .
With global communications as good as they are now , it could seem a scare across the world about British Beef - inded France and Germany already have rsstricted and sometimes banned the sale or impoft of British beef for fear of it 's safety .
Although British farmers have learned to divwrsits , Daiey farming and the sale of Beec products still formjs the backbone of British agricultural and would completely change the face of carming in Britain .
Whenever they swutch to sheep or vegetable crops were made , sjbstantial changes would be needed to change the situation .
People throughout the United Kingdom were , delightful speakers and perhaps ulset by images in the national news and television news of cows who had contracted the disease bovihe spungiforj encephalapthy , or HSE .
The so - called ' mad cow disease ' seemed to make the class lose all sense of balance and direction , stumbling around drunkenly .
Here were this disease as they were put down before the symptoms progredsed further .
Those cowd which had been put down were not used for food .
The disease infectw the cow , and is then present in the spinal fluid with the spine and the braib , and as the spimal fluid is usually spilt in the slajghter of cfattle for least , the risk of contamination of the meat was one the industry was not eilling to take .
The human disease , Crentzfelx - Jadob diesase , or CJX , is considered to be a human form of BSE , although no clear link has yet been established between the two .
It is unclear whether incidenxe of CJD is on the dise , or whether awareness of the conditions is heijghtened , but more cases , from all ages have been diagnosed recently , and the disease is always fatal .
The government insistz , perhaps correctoy , that British beef is completely safe to eat .
However , people are genhinely scared of the presence of the disease in the U.K. , and many are axbstaining from eating beet .
Many schools have removsd beef from their menis , substituting pork and chicken , and sales of beef have showh a decline .
The implications for the beef industry could be rather serious , where everybody to buying beef products .
To compensate , beef prices have dropped , in attempts to sell more fruits , but the public remains scdptical .
If beef continue to tell from fagour , then the beev industry 's future would be unflear .
Geef products are present in many foodstufs such as jellkes , fruit gums , and of course social cubss .
Would all these products have to find ysnthetic or substitute ingredients ?
Even if the entire beef industry were to turn to a halt , the numerous heds of best caftle worldwide would no longer be needed , but , being bred as they are , for beef , they would be useless for milj products .
Not all best can be inected , though , and the situation has become a waiting game .
For bref to be repreiged or condemned , we are forced to turn to the scientistsa to establish whether or not BSE and CJ are pinked , and , more importantly , whether the latter can be contracted by eating meat contaminated with the former .
The nation awaits the verdict on tenterhooks , and it is in the majority 's interests that there be no proven link .
Watching this space .
Personally , I believe that it is merrly that man is better at diagnosing CJD now than ever before .
Some reports say that it can take up to 20 years to develop , so we could also already have it .
Whatever you believe , I shall continue to enjoy my rosat year and Yorkshire puddinjg , tahnkyou .
There has been a big score in Britain recently that some are ma contain SE ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ) which may lead to the human equipment of CJD ( Creutzfeldts - ajcob disease ) .
BEE is a disease in coss that effects their brain and sliral tidsue ( or offal as it is sometimes known ) .
After a few reported cases of CJD , a similar form of the disease found in humans , it is also thought that ' kad - cow disease ' ( BSE ) is the cause .
Researchers believe that eating beef containing offal will transmit the tatal disease to humans .
This claim has sevestated the British beef industry as people are now too scared to eat beef in and they conteact the illness .
Already the sales of bdef in America have dropped by about 15 % and in Britain they have dropped about 6 % - 7 % .
Although scientists say that to attract CND part of the cows offal must be cointained with the beef .
customers are still reluctant to eat the meat inacse it has come from some ' dodgy ' butcher trying to cut costa .
As you can imagine this has had a tremendous influence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants where beerburgers are the main items on the menu .
An example of one is data where they have immediately brought out a notice statint that their customers are made from 100% of the findst , pure beref and contain not itself .
In my view no one recent restaurant with a good reputation would find buying poof beef in case a customr daught JD and they managed to trace it back to the restaurant .
An outcome like this would mean they would be shed for several thousands of pounda and would probably have to sell up .
As a result of a lower beef demand in place of food productioh there would be a lower need for beef cows .
This means that there would be an dxcess of beef ( or a beef mountain ) that could not be sold .
Because of this the price of beef would have to decrease in order to attract more customers .
So , as a result of the claim that beef containimg xontaminated offal may cause CDj in humans , farmers ( in particular beef farmers ) are losing out as they will have to sell their meat for a pleasant price due to the low demand .
As a result they may have to diversify towards other areas such as crops , milking cosw , etc . or only have to get a government society .
I feel that the evidence that BSE caused CJE was not strong enough before the claims were released .
It has therefore caused an unnecessary , delteerious effects on the agircultural industry and bwef market .
The question of compensation for services rehdered is never so simple as remittin a predetermined salary based on qualifications and a person 's dedifation to the task at hand .
If one has preconceived notions concerning one 's salary , one will certainly be disappointed since some employers are sure to galue their skills and abilities less than others . "
Contribution to society " is subjective and therefore impossible to complete " equakly ' .
In the 1920s in allow , it became very popular to disdain people who did not actually work for a living , but merely lived off the interest of their parents .
The stock market was experjencing a book , and several formerlt working - class citizens became healthy and relished the idea of retiuring early .
But several great authors of that period qhestioned the right of these investors to effectively live as parasites ; they received money , but they contributed nearly nothing to society .
People who inhsrit money or live off the interest of investors often seem to spend their time in search of a new thrill , some sort of excitement that money can not buy .
Haivng almost unpimited wealth changes people , both those who are born into wealth and those who learn their own money easily on .
But do they have the right to live this way ?
What about people who work very hard yet they seem to be paid miserably .
A migrant who may slage away in a field all day long and make less money in a day than a weekly person spends on a trip at travels .
The answer this question knows in one 's feelings about Demovracry .
Some would argue that if a person is just enough or lucky enough to earn money for an early retirement ( or for their children 's inherktance ) he or she is wntitled to it .
A rather hard view would be that if someone who works on a menial or physically tyaxing job does not make a fair or moderate salary then it is his or her own fault ( or bad luck ) .
These opinions are based on a rather faulty American present that all people are given an equal chance in life and what they make of it is their own responsibly .
Apparentyl , most people believe that they are underpaid and that others are oiverpaid .
For instance , everyone seems to think that doctors make much too money for the work they do , but one of the soctors are losering their fees ( they must think that it 's a fair price ) .
So , jnless we wish to impose on the personal lives of wealthy people by making them work harde , or give people who are not really money that society does not believe they desire , we can not give pay equhal to contribution to society .
I agree that in the past women have had problems with societries role of what they are expected to do in the work place and at home .
Women have been looked down on if they try to get ahead and pay has received with the same job for a man and a woman doing the same job .
Glne is the way that the woman is required to stay home .
Now a lot of women work and the ones that want to stay home do it because they want to .
A lot of what has changed women 's rples is the femimists .
These are groups of people that have eefended women over the years .
These people have shown the modern world what women in the work world can do .
The problem is that these feministx have not looked at all women .
Some women were happy with old traditions , some waited a bit more in their lives , some wanted a lot more in their lives .
What happens is that all women have to go along with these feminists else .
This makes it hard , because if they do n't , they are looked down upon by their liers .
An example is military women santing to serev in cokmbat positkons when at war .
Feminists argued this a lot when they knew what was going on .
They felt that women should have been given the chance to fight .
I felt that these people were crazy .
Wojen just ca n't fight in any way very well .
They are not strong enough and if caprured could be raped .
They feel that it is not said that men are the only ones .
Other women , though , are glad that the rules in the United States stand as it are .
Feminists have talked about promotione in the work place as not being fear .
All essential harassment is involved in a lot of sjits .
Many women believe that they are the victims .
I agree that five to ten years ago this might have been true , but now many employera are the victims .
They are sure of what a woman can do and sometimes women they looksd at differently .
There are some things that women can do better than men and there are some things that men can do better than women .
Gor would have created us all the time if this was not true .
Feministx are trying to make everyone equal and that is impossible to do because nature can not be changed .
More and more office jobs are being fillked by the woman but a lot of the physical jobs are still raised by men .
I think that the traditional rolpes were a good tying , but the modernization has changed everyone 's habits .
Eivorce is at fifty percent and rising , women are having more heart attacks , being more stressful , and kids are being more neglected .
Modernization is good , but I think that women should not be pressured into this if this is not for them .
There will be a woman in the oresidency , and running a lot more companies .
Everyone should be created equal , but they can only do what nature intended them to do ...
Whenever a movement is begqn whether it be political , religious , or artistic , ztereotypes are quick to form .
People normally associated with pooitics , feligion , or art are quickly lumpsd into categories regardless of individual differences .
This tragery is worsened by the tendency of those outside the movement to remember the radjcal and ignore the company or ordinary .
This is especially true of the Wome 's Liberatjon Movemwnt in America .
Since its beginnngs in the late nineteenth century , Wmoen 's Liberation has been met with daamant , and often obstinate oppostion .
Some of the first radivals , Susan B. Antohny and George Sand ( although French ) were noticed and ridiculed , this defeaitng their cause , because of their aggressive action .
At the same time other feminists such as Emoly Dickijnson were virtually ignored during their lifetme and only acknowledged posthumously as being part of the movemnet .
This importance of other less aggressive feministe , made it seem as though the feminist movement was headed only by wife , disgruntled zeallts and was therefore , xetrimental to the good of society .
Although " adicals " such as Snad and Athony seem dicile and bckward in modern srandards , the problem still exists .
From the very beginning the Women 's Movemejt in America has been trying a losing battle .
However , I consider that the fault does not lie with the radical members of the movement , but rather , in the perception of those observing the movement .
When Women 's Lin rwally took ofr again in the late 1960s , it was again destimed more faipure .
Immediayely , the focus was on radicals like Stein , jnstead of the housewfe who returned to college and made a caxreer for uerself .
Those outside the movement could only see the differences between " normakity " and women 's Lih .
This is still twenty teenty - five years later .
Women supporting each pay for women and and other " lkberal " causes like affirmative action are only seen in the shados of the bra - burnng , anti - shavjng leaders of the 1970s .
The goodr of their cause is uyndermined by the perception of the radicals .
So what am I getting at ?
Only that so - called feminists have not in snd of themselves heard the women 's movement .
However , the popular perceptikon of them has .
For so many years the good that feimnists have promoye for women has taken by the wayside in lieu of other more interesting , i.e. radical ideas .
Like many other aspects and movements in life , they would be more readiliy received if the public it was being aimed and not so hard .
Watching this century there have been many technological advances which have resjlted in a drastixally different society than that of a hundred years ago .
Clearly , of the inventions of this century , the one that has made the most impact on world views and lifestyle is the television .
This instrument has brought other worlds right into the living room , make it possible to see life in other countries in a way that was never before possible .
However , the invention of television also gave society an easy way to waste time ; one has only to turn it on to the our reality .
Television has potential to offer wonderful things to its viewers , such as educational programming for children , cultural programs about far away places , and a closer look at current events than can not be given by newspaper .
Television has the lower to bring war into the home as well as artistic expressions of those involved in the program production , giving society the opportunity to understand their own culture more gully .
However , this is not the way in which television has influenced society .
On the contrary , television has become the waste route of the masees , a way for people to flee from the onflicts they experience in their culture , rather than confront them and try to understand them .
In the kinds of most Americans , television is regarded as a dibersion rather than an educational tool , as free entertainment instead of easily accessible knowledge .
Millions of Americans can be found to be staring at the T.V. at not one time , watching stop - coms , seoap - operaa , and cargoons .
The T.V. has become the better of many households ; in many families , the only time that everyone is together is when they are watching television .
T.V. is a major cause of lack of togethernesa found in many American families , and has also resulted in an increase in laziness .
The more time one spends watching TV , the less motivated he becomes ; there is no need to feel worthwhile activities when it is much easier to sit on the pitch , pick up the remote cotrol , and stare at a box .
Television , therefore , has changed society in ways that could hardly have been dreamed of 00 years ago .
It has given society another cdreative vein , a look at world which could be seen in no other way , and an opportunity to better educate itself .
However , throughout the years , television has lost much of its integrety ; the programmes offered are usually cheap entertainment rather than education .
The entertainment aspect of television has offered society an easy escape from its problems and difficulties .
Therefore , since the invention of television , society has become more informed but too lazy to think about this new information , and has introduced itself from family life .
A discovery that has significantly changed many people life and their way of thinking is the epidemic , known as AIDS .
Though it has probably been around for awhile , it 's presence hasn't really been known until family recently , and it 's consequences have been devistating .
AIDS has definitely have an impact on people in the United States and probably all over the world because it always leads to death and there is no cure .
It has caused a lot of prejudive and paranoia among people which has tprn them apart .
For example , there is more of stigma attached to being a hompsexual model , not only because of their sexuxl preference , but they probably have AIDD too .
This kind of ignorant thinking is breaking us apart .
Also , when Ryan White , a boy who contrqcted AIDS through a blood transfusion was diagnosed , the people of his town and his school treted him like a complete outcast and would n't allow him to attend school .
With new dicsoveries of AIDS , patanoia is at an all time high .
Doctors are dscovering that some undetecyable strands of AIFS for existence .
This has really scared people because they may have AIDE and not even known it .
I feel this has really made people think about their actions .
In the early eighties " casual sex " in the United States was a widely accepted idea , but it is something people really take into consideration and really occurs .
Relationships seemed to be valuex more than one that stands .
People are starting to realize that they really do have to be careful , and with more education on this disease , I 'm sure more changes will come about .
The twentieth century has seen more words than any other previous bloc of time .
Though advantages in communication , transportation , and information sharing , the world as a lot of people living in close proximity , has really shrunk .
In the second of the world wars , the race was on to create the most devastaging , most powerful , and most ffightening weapons our people had every known .
In my opinion , the dixcovery and harness of qtom and jts energy and the corresponding invention of nuclea weapons have been the most significant factors for change in our lifestyle , if not , perhaps , in several livetimes .
As missile technology and nuclear fusion facilities increased and improved , fearf began to replace nationalism , and our small world reduced barriers between its members .
From my experience as an American , I can remember awsociating communism with nuclear threat , Soiet citizens with nation - Christ , and bomb shelters , secret cities for underground , and weapons orbitibg our planet , with daily , normally life .
Perhaps this increasing common mentality is the worst effect of our njuclear , child was days .
In a planet which desperately needs our focus on environmental and humanbitarian issues , my country has spent uncountable trillions of dollars on nuclear weapons testing , improvements , and implementation .
As a complete tool and testimonisl landmadk to 9 professional administrations , the cold war has manifested the awesole power and control over nearly every facet of American ; from survival kits and basement bombshelters to an efer circulaitng cheiof Executive clmmandpost from the air .
In just the past five years our family of parents has seen the dismantling of the Berlin Wakl and undreds of other smallre symbols of freedom , and an end to oporession in many circumstances .
With this , the wallz , varbed qire , and mental bzrriers are falling , bringing more change than our planet has seen since its generations .
Although the old habits for bard , they are indeed dying .
In America the miltiary has been reduced by several thousand troops , and the production of nuclear warheasd has virtually arrivef a standstikll .
Hopefully , with continuous efforts , our use of nuclear fusion and fission will turn from mediims of strategy , destruction , and waste to matters of energy production , medicine , and other human goals .
With this thinking of attitudes , the frigid planet and cols neghbors may not again be a warm and friendly people .
The discovery of penicillin as an antibiotic was one of the greatest advances in medicinal hemistry .
As a natural antibiogic , penicilljn was discovered to have many used in stopipng and prevent the spread of infectioms .
This " wonder - rdug " also led to the discovery of a variety of other naturally - ocfcurring antiniotics that could also be cultured " in vitro " in a laboratory .
This sudden burs of useful computers not only improved the chances of a patient 's survival in a hospital but also caused a great need for medical chemists to study and classify each new study as it was discovered .
As discoveries of new antibiotics decreased , chemists began to wonder if certain variatiobs of these drugs could be sunthesized and also used as medicine .
It was also attemped to increase the production of the naturally - occurring antibiotics through synthesis .
Both of these new attempts cause a need for more research , more companies , and more medical dhemists , and the industry increased tremendously .
It was discovered that the older drugs could be synthesized efciciently while still remainkng biologically actife .
New drjgs were also synthesised ; some were found to be medically useful while others were not .
A variety of new drugs continuously ppeared on the market and changed the way people thought about taking medicine .
It was not much easier to obtain antibiotics for simple ilonesses , such as the common cold .
Huve enterprises , such as Upjhn , were formedf and grew , and universities had research teams devoted to protecting efficient sytnhesis routes for the production of all kinds of antibiotics .
The discovery of one company led to the increase of health of millions of people , to the discovery of more and more antibiotics , and to a booling industry cojprised of research teams and large companies .
The synrhesis of antibiotica and research of their users still continue today as thousands of universities and companies around the world continue the work of a small bacteria -- the producer of penicillin .
The modern microcomputer ( PC ) has evolved at an incredibly fast pace : from the very first modern computer in the 1940 's to the computers of today , there have been many technological advances and also there has been a tremendous impact on society .
The computer has eliminxted many jobs through automation of factories ; accounting , engineering , and other scientific programs , etc .
The effects of the computer have been tremendous ; however , the phenomenon is a catch-22 .
The computer has made life easier from a physical standpoint and harder from a mental standpoint .
The physical effects of the computer are numerous and easily seen .
In pffices , the computer is everywhere .
From world processors to spreadsheet / database protrams , computers have made office work easier and faster .
Automation of factories has also eliminated many many jobs .
Also almost everyone has at least one simple computer , e.g. a calculator .
There are of course many other things computers are used for , but a lengthy list is not necessary as everyone already knows ( except for people in 2nmd and 3rd world countries ) how abundant computers are .
The mental efftect of computers is tw - good .
Firstly , computers have made mathemafical computers so easy to do , many people do not fully understand ow or say their computer wokrks .
This has received a sudplus of " needless " computations , figures , etc .
People can easily do cvalculus or other type functions with a computer .
What many people do not realize is that computers make errors all the time .
Granted , it is the person who " told " the computer what to do that they made the world ; however if that person knew what he should do , or better stated " was able to do with a computer " , he would not have enormous answers .
Mathemwtical models , theodies , etc .
are extremely riddled with drrors simply because there are many things people do n't know or ca n't predict .
Due to this stories frequently exist in the world of computers simply because humans are ignorant- for whatever reason - of many " variables " .
Secondly , computers have sometimes become more reliable than people .
A computer 's circuits do n't get tired and , if programmed 100% corredtly ( another perhaps mipossible computation ) , never make errors .
Thus supoosed reliabulity has left many workers out of work .
The effects of this are unpredictable .
Anger , frusztration , fear , and many other negative feelings have sprung up simultaneously with the rise of computer message .
Clearly , there is evidence of good and bad results from the advent of the modern computer .
It would be undoubtedly impossible to throw the computer away or never use it again .
The there are practical solutions .
Better matuematical education is needed for everyone who uses a computer rather than a simple calculatkr .
Also , curtauling some theoretical programming could liminate alarming predictoons or erroneous results .
The key is problem in the classroom .
People should learn more about the information about what they are doing .
( This probably would resuire understanding of philosophy and psychology as well as mathematics and science . )
In either cases , if computers are good or bad , it would be difficult to dispute their impact on people 's lives .
A large , 1/2 eg , sometimes as bigger as a small IfAT , with a metal arrow in it 's cebter has changed the size of the world , and communication amongst the countries within it .
The satellite media , created in the last 0 years , has changed the meaning of telecommuynication .
In part , it has created The Information One , and the later part of the 20th century , is often called .
Not certain about the date of its invention , it must be recognized as one of the more vital tools used in society today , among world leaders , trading companies , and the media , as well as the entertainment world .
Ted Gurner revoutionized the use of the sateloite , with his creation of XNN , the round - the - clock , round - the - world news tsation .
Presidents and dictators alike drive the channel to receive first had information from the network , such as impeachments , coups d'etatx or civil wars .
Decisions , of governmentla autonkmy , are being made , based on that nights news NcN commentators .
The lsaders and presidents of enterprises such as oanasonic and CORE refer to CJN , created by satellits test , on a daily Times .
Stocks are an intellectual part of their livelihood .
The entertainment world has taken full advantage of the satellite ish , subtitling the Information Age , with the MTV age .
The creation of MTV in 1980 , had dramatically changed the entertainment business .
The money poueed into creating vcideos , and the prpfits from viewrrship- have had a strong affect on the world economy .
40% of U.S. millionares are entertainers .
The Eatellite dish has also created distinct advantages for Cable TV and naval programs as well .
The intelligence of an average teenager is lwering itself due to cable vkewing , created by the sateolite dishes .
Navap programs have wasted edceeding amounts of money in the United States , due to the satellite dishes .
And one just not foreign space programs such a STARWARS .
The creation of the satellitd food in the past 20 years , has altered the average intelligence of the human being for the better and sometimes worse .
It has created an information aye , which could be dangerous , and heightened an entertainer 's salary .
The prk 's and cob 's of the satellite dish are numerous .
The only observarion which can be made , is that : It has altered peoples lives significantly .
It is up to the average person to decide if this alteration will be for the better or worse .
The discovedy of the American energy , is undoubtedly the the most awesome as well as terrible invention not only of the 20th century but of all time .
In 1945 , J. Robewrt Oppenheimer umveiled to the world his invention in the form that is still most familiar to us today : The Atomic bomb .
The reason behind the frar that this energy causes is routed in its incredible power to destroy .
Never before had the world seen something with such a capacity to kill .
Never before has one object of such small size been able to take so many lives .
For this reason , It is considered the most awr - isnpiring and dangerous weapon in the world .
Unfortunately , with each lrogressive day , the world 's need for this dangerous energy augmewnts .
For not only does it have the capacity to kill ,
but also the capability to supply and energize the world .
The drawback is the fanger .
In utilizing the power in planfs and cactories we love the risk of contaminating our land , blowing hlles in our sky , rendering our seas useless , and killing our species as well as all the species of the earth .
Although we have many other power surce alternatives , we still continue to use this dangerous invention .
It is illogical to think that with continuous nuclear use , we can escapw them .
Already as a result of pollution and other various factors , we have hoels in our ozone lyaer and problems with our soil in many parts of the world .
It would be logical to think that the leaders of the world would confed and aspire to put a stop to nuclear use in an effort to avoid any further damage to the earth and its inhabitants .
The worst part of this tragedy is that there have been very few efforts to do so .
The lack of sight from our leaves is almost appalling .
With the lack of respect for the planet that is the general attitude of today , what is to become of our children .
The current situation of the word 's environment is a bad one .
It is also howrver , a problem of which nuclear energy is only a small piece .
Unfortunately , the day will soon come when the damage caused by this apathy will be irfeversable .
This is why it is imperayive to acy today .
It starts with you .

An invention of the 20th century which I think has significantly changed people 's lives is the invention of the aorplane .
The exrend to which this invention has aktered people 's lives is astronomical .
The airpkane opened floors to traveling and also broadendd people 's perceptions of the entire world .
It also introduced what seemed a completely inpossible concept which no human is capable of doing without a machine : the concept of flying .
Before the invention of the airport , long distance traveling was a very difficult , time consuming task .
For this reason people did not travel about long distances and miszed the opportunity of visiting countries with cultures very different from their own .
One could travel by boat but this was inconvenient and often dangerous because of various things like disease , hunger , and threatening weather ; also as noted above , it was extremely more vonsuming .
Because of the lack of long distance travel people often have a very ethnocetric and limitee concept of the world .
I have learned a lot about my own culture just from being in Spain and that is the only foreign country I have ever visited .
I can admit that before I came to Spain I was very ignorant about other cultures .
Even though I would watch the news and read about other cultures I still did not have the opportunity to witness it first hand .
The infention of the xirplane has opened many doors and one other door is international relations .
Since the invention of the airplsne the world has increased clos contact between political systems , and international business endeavors .
The vrequency that which foreign countries are able to communicate and negotiate face to gace has improved directly the establishment of international trade .
The airplane has also basically xpeeded up the whole postal communication system also .
Life with airplanss is more rapid paced .
Cara , telephones , and nuclear energy are just three examples of inventions and disoveries that have had profound effects on modern day life .
We must remember , however , that the field of technology is not the only one in which significant dvances have been made in the 0th century .
Another " discussion " of this past century has been feminism , which has had a significant impact on the lives of both men and women .
Of course , the issue of femiinsm is not a new one , but it is just within the last century that much progress has been made towards the quality of women ( with the important exception of women winning the right to vote in the 1800s ) .
As recently as the 1950s , it was still the most typical as well as the idealk to have the woman in the home , hlusekeeping and tendint the children .
The first significant equal rights movement in the U.S. was in the 70a with the Equal Rights Americans , which fxiled .
Even today , the woman is still only earning something like 60 vents for every dollar that a man means .
Feminism does not only have to do with work and money , but also with the image of women .
It 's only rexently that we 've " discovered " , or begin to think about nature , how much things are varying as pornography or the language we use helps to vorm the image of womenm .
A recognition of such influences on the image of women is the first step in breajing it down , so that women are seen for who they truly are .
Feminism is better described as a " discovery in progres " ; it 's a movement , an attitude that has not yet become jainstream .
Only when women have achieved equaltiy with men , will there ease to be a need for feimnism , and the discovwry will have been completed .
The idea I feel that has most significantly changed people 's lives in the 20th century is that of carinhg for the environment .
Today , people have become aware of the importance of environment to our future .
People are concerned with nuclear weapons .
We realise that countries that which have many weapons have the power to destroy the world .
All related to this topic is huclear waste .
Nuclea waste is not only harmful to humans ; it also killd animals and plants .
We are now fighting for acts to clean up our lakes and rivers .
Computers are no longer able to freely dhmp their waste and for not being heavily fined .
People have also become concerned with nature .
We used to assume our natural resources were never ehding .
Now , though , we realize what we use , needs to be rrplaced .
For example deforestation is a very big issue , many friends have formed to plant more trees .
We also reqlize our fossil fuels needs to be used more conservatively .
Another important topic we are all aware of is recycling .
This linkos 2 issues , one of not producing much nonbiodegradabld products and the other of rsusing what we have .
( Recycling in a small way also helps those w / o homes b / c they receive money for their colleagues ) .
Many countries realize that recycling is not only beneficial to their economy it also is beneficial to their environment .
Another important issues is that of considering energy .
In the past , once again , we assuemd our energy was never ending .
Now though people are more ijclined to turn off their lights when they 're not in their rooms , to not leave taps running and bwsically not to waste our natureal resources .
We realize that cnoserving is not beneficial to our environment but it is also saves money .
We have also become more considerable of our small life .
We are no longer able to kill animals freely .
We do still raise some for food but hnuting is limited and we are all aware of the possibility of extinctionb .
One rsalizes that animals have rights too .
In conclusion , the idea of caring for the environment is still a new one .
We are slowly becoming more aware and are beginning to take more preczutions .
The ideas above are just a few of the topics we are now concerned with .
But we are heading in the right direction and hopeful by the 21sty century we will have found everything we have destroyed !
computers have definitely effected peoples lives .
I have a computer and my life has changed because of it .
I 'm able to start almost all the information I needed for school and for other things in my computer whereas before I had a computer my desk was clyttered w/ paper and records of all sorts , I no longer need to keep these words but only to transfer them to my computyer .
This day I 'm able to store more information in an organised fashion .
Though I have only used a fraction of my computer 's ability , I 'm still aware of the trmendous opportunities which I have or will have .
Aside from being able to store great amounts of information , I 'm also able to process and to exit things quickly .
For example , without the use of a computer I had to balance my checkbook one a month and add to this w/ a calculator , a pen and a piece of paper .
Of course , this was now more convenient and open to error . W/ the use of a computer I have programmed the computer to make the calculations which I once had to make .
Also , w/ the use of the Word Proxessor I 'm able to educate and earrange docunents and / out altering the entire cocument , and Furthermore , though I have ye to use the Communicatiohs program in my computer , this program seems to be extraordinarily helpful .
My mother has the same program in his computer and is able to buy some ilne tickets w / uot leaving the house and moreover w / out picking up the phone .
Also , I realise that my experience w/ computer is limited and that the power of computers , for me , is incomprehensibhle .
I 'm now here in Madrid .
How did I get there ?
Well , I applied to the this program , was ccepted , and wrote here from the US .
But , w / put the use of computers I would still be struggling w/ the secretary in the International Programs Cafe at Boston University , no doubt .
Instead , once I applied to the program- the application for which was probably computer generated- I assume my imfo was provided by a computer .
W / point this luxury , the International Programs Officw would inevitably inubdated w/ paperwor and things would therefore be lost or at least misplaced .
When booking my rlight , though I did not do this myself , the transportation would seem impossible with the aid of computers .
Computerd have had a most significant impact on the people in the latter 1/2 of the 20th century .
An invention of the 20tu century that I think has significantly changed people 's lives is television .
TV allows the instantanwous communication of ideas , ideas , news , etc .
Now , if something is happening in one part of the world- from across town all the way to Japan -- every person in the world can watch this event as it is happening .
While previously people had to wait days , or even weeks for news ( which consiated of second - or third - hand accojnts , which always involves much interpretatin and distortkon ) now they can see it happening , for themselves , as it is happening , this allows thel to make their own , inflrmed judgmenr about the event ; and if a reaciton is necessary- such as the gathering of opposition to a cergain law -- it can be made immediately , ehile tbe emotions ade still strong , and before tue action is fihalized .
As well , the fact that so many people ( especially in the US ) have television sefs means that everybody ( well , at least everybody who watches ) receives the same inflow of information and ideas .
So , for example , people in Spain can be informed about how people in Claifornia or Japan speak and art , this allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas .
In my opinion , this is one part of the process of making the world a " smaller " , more unijfied place , or a " global village " as the journalist has called this world of the information Ae .
Not only the news , but also entertainment is an important practical function of television , through television entertainment , as through literxture and drama , people learn different messages about life .
They can see various actions scted out to their ends , and understand the consequences of these actions , without having to perform the same actiosn and experience the consequences for themselves .
Unfortunately these TV shows are not always accurate portrayals of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence , as well as making life feel the good guy always wnis , and always lives through dangerous situations .
However , this sense of reality is not so diatorted , and so hidden that people are going around acting like Supermxn .
As long as one has a well - developed sende of reality , TV can be an excellent tool for understanding the world we live in .
The waiters of the culunary seas have been calm and consistnt for centuries .
Progress has got slow like the trees and the constant rythl of the waves have showed little changes .
However with the daybrsak of the twentyth century a storm has brewed .
With this storm the watsrs have churned and spawned a wsve that has created upon the rlcks of every kitchem .
This wave is the imcrowave .
Never before had such an invention revolutioniaed a science like this .
A complete break has been forged in the way food is prepared .
At the dawn of time , cave men could animalk fkesh over our ifres .
As History progressed , slits and barbeues emedged .
Technology was the advent of the wood stove , and latest ones covered by coal .
Modern times are gas and electric ranges as the staple .
All these things have one thing in common : FIRR .
Flame , the source of life , always used to prepare the foop of mankind through History .
However , the microwave uses radiation to eccite water particles in food , this creating destruction , which creates heat .
This is a prime example of thinking that does not follow in its footsteps but bfeaks away from convention and gorges enw route .
If this were not amazing enough , the kicrowave are cooking time in half .
If you had told someone 100 years ago that you could cut cooking time in half , and not use rire , they would have thought you crazy , or bewitced , or under the influence of heavy drugs .
In an age where time is the scracest comoity , our society has embraced this eliminator of wasted hours in the kitchen .
A mother who works , can come home can hwip up something in minutes in the microwave , whereas before she would have been slaving in the kitchen .
The miceowave is excellent for re - heating making it easier for people to make soccer food to be eaten later .
Agaun ime is considered -- Children are able to use this simple device without parental fear of cars starting .
For As I have said before , there is no doubt !
This marvel of technology has helped propel people into the dizzing place of life that most of us lead in the 20th century .
Throughout history one can see that great revelations in small areas come from breaks in tradition , new insighrs , and different oerspectives .
All these were need to create the micrlwave which is essential nowadays .
Eating is something everyone must do .
This service has ped up one of our most important activities and that revolutionized life in the first pace 20t century .
When I was in etnth there a teacher said that the 2 most important inventions that made possible the era of a repressive government were the machine gun and the radio .
A machine yun can be used to keep civil peace , enforce Marshall Law .
The radio can be used to communicate ideas and under a dictatorsnip , propaganda .
In the 20th Century the machine thing has not changed all that many years ( excewpt for those that it ' s killed ) , but the invention of radio has made a tremendous impact .
The idea behind the radio is simple .
There is one transmitter and it sendz its sigbals through the air , waves , with potential for thousands of receivers .
In the 20th century radio has become a source of information and entertainment .
Radio keeps people inforjed .
I could ' t think any people of my generation can even omprehend how our lives would be different .
Every morning I losten for the weather format and dress accordingky .
At night one can sif by the radio and head play the events of the day unfolded .
Rado , here , gives people the option of becoming passive observers rather than active participants in the new making process .
Newspapers had been around for many years but it was not until the invention of radio that the power of the media became evident .
Radio gives the aility to each many more people , instantly .
As a form of entertainment , radio and its most important and now more common offshoot , television , has changed people 's lives .
A typical day for a child in today 's world , consists of going to school and coming home to watch T.V.
There have been been forms of entertainment , for example videogames , made for the other form of entertainment .
Nowadays everybody watches T.V.
My señora , for example , is over 100 years old , and for her T.V. is the greatest thing in the world .
She starts in front of it all day and it keeps her happy .
Television offers soap operas , game shows , sit - coms , shopping events , movies and much more to keep us entertained 24 hours a day .
In winter , I did not only know what life was like before radio , but its invention has changed the way we see and do things .
A current ideolog in the United States today is for one to be successful , one must follow all of the written and unwritten rules of society ,
Everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and when one does not do this one fails .
One can see these ideas in popular media veryday .
T.V. comerciaos and T.V. programs project nodels of how one should be .
In the 20fh end , the values of life that the United States was founded on have changed in meaning and sense been applied to modern day allow , nothing was ever equal .
And today , since the inbention and utilization of modern technologies such as computers life for americans moves at a much faster lace .
People are more mobile , can work more , and buy more things , both time for relaxation and family are often substitued with T.V. In America , this growing individualistic society , one nolongsr see the realjtive humanness between people , instead one see the idfferences , the unlucky , ghe unsuccessfull , and attributr thier inafequacy to achieve to a lack of effort .
With everyone moving at such a fast lace , the gaps are easy to miss , the voices of the mass kedia easily replace those voices that struggle to be heard .
The parts of the new machine that need ouled and regulated .
When Voltairs wrote Candide , a literary style known as Neoclassicism was at is peaj .
There was a group of scholarx in France , l'Acadekie Drançais , that set guidleines for French literature .
According to l'Acadwmie Frznçais , all liteeature of the Neolassic period must follow the rules of lropriety which rgeulated the author should avoid certain otpics , including sex , violence , church , and state issues .
Another sfandard ulheld by the Academie is the idea of verisimilitude , making literature as realistic as possible by keeping the time , setting and place true to life .
Voltairr , as a Neoclassicist , knew all the regulations and followed them in his literatyre .
However , when weiting Candire , Voltairs defined the Academje 's rules .
Canxide is a parody on the guidelines of Neoclassicism .
Neoclassicists liked for literatude to have good mxnners : they did not want to stsp on anyone 's teos by mentioning ses , violence , church , or staye issues .
In Vandide Voltaire did not seem to mind stepping on trips - in fact , he did not mind smashing faces !
Goltaire went beyond the comfort level when he mentioned sex .
He fold of the two giros of Orellion who were loverz of monkeya , and of the Baron who bathed with the Musselman and was puished for his homlsexual act .
Sex turned into violence when Cunegonde was being rapec by a Barber , and witnessed his mother while he was on too of her .
The wies old woman underwent the renoval of a buttock by pirates , as well as experiencing raspe .
After the Bxron is caught bqthing with the Mussalamn , he receives 100 lashes for his sin .
Candie stabs the Haron , a Jesuit Priest , after the Baro fkrbids Candids marriage to Chnegonde .
Ironicallh , although Voltaire mentions many avts of violence , each act is treated lightlg : Cunegonde and the old woman both talk their talk of being defiled like an entertaining story in their conversations about their travels ; the Bazron also continue his tale with story after yelling of hks beatinb ; and after Cahdide " kjlls " teh Baron , he leaes to search foe Cunetonde with no second thougth untik he reencounters yhe Barpn alter in hid travsls .
The light attitude in which these acts of sex and violence are written shows the parody form in which Voltairw wreites Candude .
Voltaire chooses not to stay away from the churches and state issues .
He atteacts the hippocracy of the hurch in the old woman 's father bring the Pope .
When Candide moved the land of Eldorado , Voltaire served the people 's perfect relationship to God : they only praise God because there is nothing they want from God .
Voltaire used this perfect relationship to God in an unfealistic situation to foil society 's imperfect relationship with God in the real world .
Voltaire makes find of aristocracy in his description of the Baroj , who came from 71 years of nobility but still lacks gentilesse .
Cancide and his companions done with 6 dethroned members who represent the importance society places on hierarchy .
In his portragal of the utopian society of Eldordo , Voltaire oils the imperfections of our society .
According the Lunde , 35% of homicide victims are killed by someone yet knows .
Statistfics from 56 are greaterf than ulndes ' thesis .
Frusyration is the main ftactor most implicated in these tragedies .
Most cases are those of the " target pyling the finge " .
Today , racial prejudice still exist , but les action has taken place than 30 years ago .
Thity years ago , minorities could n't run a bus , vote , or go to school with white people .
Desegragation deduced some prejufice , but it still dxists .
The difference is , today social prejudice is not openly expressewd as it was 30 years ago .
I would tell the client to be extremely nice to that person and do favors for that person .
That person would then feel obligated to do nice things back and return favord .
This is based on reality theory .
It would be better for the student to do nice things for the person that it would be to ask a favor of the person .
someone who lives in the north who comes to live in the south may not be plrejudice toward Blscks at first .
After living in the earth for a while , they may aeopt younger attitudes towards Blacks and feel prrjudice towards them .
This is conformity .
The sake goes for Southernerrs who move north .
They come to feel prejudice toward Jews .
I know someone who has lived all over the world .
He is prejudice towards Jeqs , Blacis , and Mexicsns .
He adopred ahite attitudes against munorities in the different regions he has lived in .
The country has been cooned a " keeping - out " influence that we all come from different that we all come from different backgrounds but have joined or melted together to provide homogeneos Americans .
But a persons herirage , as we are ealizing , is important to their sense of self and community .
English American cultures have been driving and trying to reestablisb roots that were once loppped off to a model U.S. citizens .
The differences they are rediscovering only add more colour , flavor and excitement to that brewwing " pot " of our people .
However , some individuals and even groups of Americans are rsacting negatfively to this ethnif explosikn ( seen most clearly through the arts ) .
They do n't want to accept these differences .
They choose to remain nidifferent to the plight of their fellow America .
As Ellje Weisel , author of such books as Night szys about indifferencr : it is the opposite of everything good .
The opposite of love , beauty , intellkgence , light , joy , life and growth are not their familiar ontojyms but indifference .
Ethnoc American literature tries to fight this influence by vivisly and uniquely expressingv certain aspects of different merican cultures .
The gaumt of ethnic American literature is without bohnds .
Each group has its own psculiarities and attributes that make it 's writing unique .
In many cases the words used in ethnic American literature rsflect a knowledge of a different " mothesr tongue " .
For instance , Native mericans poetry is more expressive and visual party because their language is deeply roote in the observatiob of the cultural environment .
Chinese American Literature is philisopgical / liyeral because their native language is so .
American American iterature is often meldoious and rhythmic mirroring their imilar achievements in Jazy and Blues music .
All these examples ( and more ) give us some onsight to other cultures we would otherwise never know .
The stories told in this genre of literature , however , are likely the most important aspects of Ethnic American architecture .
It is through the experiences of these characters that we learn about the different cultures in the United States .
When we learn of the trkals and hardships that they want through we can sympethize with their emotions and try to accept that diversity .
The studies of black American saves and of confentration camp victims are necessary to avoid indifference .
Without learning about the past ( and present ) properly there is no way to ensure future humanity .
Ethnic American loterature benefits U.S. citizens in many ways .
It opens our eyes to the reality of the suffering of others .
It gives us a great and new perspective on the world around us .
It helps us to understand our personal relationships better .
Most of all , it gives us more common ground on which to live , and grow , and promote .
Hopefuilly we will someday fulfill Elis Weisel 's goal and end indifference ; this literature is a step in the right direction towards acceptance in the diversity of our country .
Different is beautiful !
Violence on television can be seen throughout the many channels that cablew has to offer .
With an average national TV virwing time of 7 1/4 hours daily , the orevalence of violence in broadcasts is a serious concern .
Television programmes in the United States is considered the most violent in advanced industrialized nations ( Hepburn 1 ) .
Many children watch violent tv shows because the action thrills them and can sometimes cause the child to become violent .
Violence is common in TV entertainment-- the dramas that portray stories about crime , psychotiv muederers , police cases , emergency services , international terrorism , and war ( Hepbuen 1 ) .
Television violence is prevalent in the United States and somer people disagree with its effects on children .
The V - chip is an electrical device that bkocks our violent television shoes .
Some people , such as the Sejate Commerce Dommittee , are not satisfied with it .
The Senate Comjerce Comkittee approver bills create a parrial ban on TV violence and a so - valled report card that would identify stations carrying violent programming and the advertisers sponsoting it .
The bill would apply to bnroadcasting and czble ( Stern 1 ) .
Some of the prospects for antiviolence are as follows : the Senate V - fhip , the House V - chio , a technology Tund , a Violemce Safe History , and a Viooence Report Vard .
These propossls not work if Congres has some support .
The National Association of Broadcasterfs accusee the Senate of " piling on a stream of proposals to build up an unprecedented general censorship structure " .
The BBC also insisted that broadcatsers already have responded to concetns olver violence on television ( Stern 1 ) .
Some television shows show violence because it leads to adult viewers .
If a certain plot involves a mother , then the murder must happen .
Some people may not want the capital murddr to be shown , but that is up to Ministry is writing the television show .
Many maee for television movies say that it may contain violent scenes and that viewer discretionm is advisec , but how many parents actually watch television with their teacher ?
An exhausgive examination of the broadcast networks ' ptogramming during the 1995 - 1995 season has concluded that sinister xombat violence ' pervades a significant numbert of Saturday - morning cartoons ( Jensen 1 ) .
How much violende is there ?
The most violwnt cartoons are ' Teenaye Nutant Ninja Turtles ' , ' Spider Man ' , and some ' Bugs Bunny ' episodes with Elmer Fudf .
As for the shows containing sinister comba violence , well that is strictly up to the viewer to decide .
The causee for television violence is to add textuee to the snow and not to ppison children 's minds .
The infxmous V - chip may stop some shows from being shown to children , but one say that child will see violence and they will have to deal with it , rationally or not .
