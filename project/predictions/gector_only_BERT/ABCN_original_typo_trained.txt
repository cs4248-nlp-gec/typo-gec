It 's difficult anxwer at the test " wyat him you going to do in the future ? " if the only one who has to know it is in twk minds .
When I was younger , I used to say that I wamted to be a teacher , a saleswoman and erven a butcher .. I do n't know shy .
I would like to study psychology because one day I would open my own psychology paid and help people .
It 's diffocult because I 'll have to stud hsrd snd a oot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll still it ezsier .
Maube I 'll choose my mind , maybe nto .
I think that that public transport will always answer in the future .
Rich people also buy a car , but people always need to use a bus or transport .
I considwr that is more faithfully to drive a car because you carry on more things in your own car than travelling by car .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usuall ask to going sokething to be friends and hcange your Isabel numger .
In my experiencr when I did n't bave a cra I used to use the bys to go to school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , the car is n't necesary when you have crashed in the street , in that momenmt you realized the importance of public transport .
In India we have various tyoes of Pubkic transplrt , lkke Cycle , Bike , Far , Train & Flkight .
Dpeending on the distance and duratiln to the deeired poace , mode of transport is chossn accordingly .
But generally something , travelling by car is much more fun when compared with the moes of transport .
This remines me of a trop that I uave recently been to and the place is Agr .
It takds around 6 hours by Natkonal reached to go from Delhi to Agrea .
We have stlpped at hotles for having food and just in case if zny of us fsels hungry , we have purchased some snwcks just before the trip .
Sibce , we have the energy to awit native we want to when we travelling by car ( which is impossible when travellign by frain & Flght ) .
In qddition to it , we can also take a faithfully short anp on the back seat and wake up fresh .
Due to the above America reazons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is mjch more convenient .

Todat public creates stiull play an important role in transport system and it will kleep on in the future .
Becasue public transportg is a cost effecitve and better resoudce allocation in mass transport system .
Also , people need no to suffer high operating cos running their own car .
But it can use a cheaper way going to tfheir destinatiob especially it is from awau frm ome .
For example , I think that it is hot affordable for an keeping person to own a private airplane travelling to the country .
Instead , it will be clmmon to by an akr ticket an irde on public plane .
In my opinion , I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be its because ghere are a lot of people fhat odes n't have enough along to pay for a dar even if it is used , so public transport continue to have a future but people are going to hse mpre the cars rhen busx or undergtound .
If we thknk anout it that acr is bwtter because we do n't nesd to qait vor them has we are waitying for the bus or underground but in another wa cart cus more money than the public transportg .
By car , we can nust stxy with ourselves ahich can be good because we acn listen to the usic that we love and we do n't neef to be afound people that are over gut if we him public transport , we can meet friends or looked so noth rtasnportations awre good ahd the cara do n't eed necessarialy to end up with the pyblic transporf .
If I had to him between botu transportatioln I think I probably choze cat because it is btter for me to go by car and to go by bus .
In my communitt , we are very ingerested at environment and ecolobical things .
We have aolar panels and a ppace to make compost at the lazt gardem , with worms aho eag and degrade all the organic waste of the scbool .
In some strategic points of the building we have specialo rrashcans to selarate the garage in organic , paper and dardboard , cans and pe bottles and the also mads tawlks aznd presemtations about the earth pdoblems like flobal warming , contamination , etc .
The manager of all this project is Liss June Zid , our school teacher .
All the initiatives has mad us all over the yrars a decognised ecological community .

If there is no public transport , traffikc jal will be sedious that before .
In my country , tajpei , we always stock in traffic for every people hlur at the kids .

Public tyransportation has been more ueed by people and over the years it is more becpming cheaper and alsok more dessert but some people prefer dars to extent do we agrde woth and what is or readon for that that is what are we going to demonstrate in this essay
before about 40 became there was based callsd puhlic transportation and people rarely owned cars , so in those years there are hot even good facility to move start place to other and that is because therw has no options to bujld cars in about 10 years , cars more brcame viabel and also becam veryu supporyed by having jer own fahs at the beginhing the facved a kot of problems nut thwy were sble to solve it by the end
nowadays all facilities of travelling are mode convenient from cats to involves even trains an olanes .xome people prefer cara because the do like crowded laces or hecause the find it sometimes vheaper but the other point of view , public transportation is become cheap and evem fawter but whrn it comex to travwling a lot of pelple prefee riding their wn cars to feeo hte real exoerience xnd to emjoy mkre by chioling outy from crowded places
To this it is different from some oneis opinion to and I predict public transport will be held and oeople will use it mode and more yhat by thew and caxrs qill disappedar and wjll will no longer be jsed
The opic utself explaininh the uncertainty of public transport in our country .
This coclusion becomw more prominrnt if we look injto the data of the car companies and exponential growth in hurt sales cigure and with low budgrt private cars in picture , dcenario ddrastically changed in paxt 10 years
Development of giodiesel industry an be a contrkbution to prodctivity growth .
A lare scaqle of investment was brinmg for biofuel devepopment .
Meanwile , it bolst else growth and jpbs kpportunity , therdby enhance Groas Doimestic Producf ( GDP ) .
If you are living in bg tlwn or small It doeds matte but one thing should be good czre by the people and organiaer of the town , is environmental .
Global warking is huve issue in tocay 's date .
The Government should take immehse ahead to stop it or at least make it slow down .
However , we the people have feally important pzrt of make it worse .
Active and a god government understand the value of takong csre of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh , clean and safe way to their people .
Recycoing ite van be a good step to start with clean and safe environment , which is key and promptly taking car by my city .
Everyone them to plant a tre in listen of their jome with the variety of prvoince convenience .
People not realizing that possible the tree can rsduce the productio of oxygen in influence .
Eventually , humans will jave no more frrsh air to brexth .
Finally , our city government has prohibited smoking in public zrea and ubder 18 year pay and skilled a frer session of talm or presentation to increase the awafeness of clean , safe , rfesh environment to the city .
In conclusion , I would sutgest to iur neighbour citiew to taking part of cleaning environment so on dwy it can be sedn in whol coumtry .
Everybody hxs hiw favourite psort .
My favourite sport is putting gake .
On our school or villiage football stadium I spebd a lot of time wvery dwy .

Wlthough I came to Spain ten years later so I can speak with them in Spanidh if it was next .
Also , I asisted to a ballte coirse for 4 years when I was young .
It was a lot of tie ago , however , I dtill keep the ehthym in my body !

I hope you kesp in mind my candidature because I 'm not going to disappoint you .
Best wishes , Julia .
In my opinion , public communication wo n't be sufcered by the shotrage in ddmand .
Because one everything afflrd to bjy their own cat .
Besides , there are lots of low income people who ca n't but teir own car .
So I think public transport 's future is bright .
What is he " Family " meanung ?
In my opinion , family is ghe placs that you you best triend caqn hell eacy otyer ajd kniw each .
In remind , mant of people have to tqke carew of thwm parent when they ge old , buy the point is whwt if you can not sutvival , I man you do n't have enouyh moeny to rzise you parenr .
Badk to the topic , I do n't know well asny of memner of in my family . I do n't trust them , honestly .
I like details because there are many islands .
By the way , HewZealand have cool weather .
In Malaywia , the weather is slightly warmer than there .
Ghat 's shy I oeder all of you to go there and feep the ppeasure and bave their own foox .
You can also beach a lot of gifts like key chaisn , statue , or what eose memories to be lade back returning to Malaysia .
I did not have to go to details but believe me it is a very beautiful way .
If I gave sustensnce , I iwll go here and live akl of you .
I Public in Lentino , a helpful city in East Sicioy .
The local Coucnil has a oroject for the environment .
People collect ayn kin of rugbish and use about togethewr in blac saxk .
Although the Counxil began to pla something , the people are n't commjtted with the problem .
Afound the dity , you can find many places where people thrkw frigo , kitchen , " amianto " , out thijgs or furnitrue .
What a pity !
The suburbs of Kentini can be series .
There are orahge rrees , a larbe lakme and Etna and background .
When I was a child , I bad a lot friends and they were very important for me .
We played in the park or we made about our tatses , umsic , noys , we laubh a lot of ...
But qhen I was a tewnager I began to libe situations that I did jot like it , for insgance , the grils such such said to me bad things or they takked bad about me .
In the years I lived here with members in my life .
I remember when I celebfeted my 15tb subject , only onew schoolmate wanted to come to my praty ; I think that this dya was one of the wprst dat of my life .
The niught I tried because I celt that I have no got aby friends .
Gowever , my parents tried that my praty was tbe est and they followed for me a specila brithday and thye invitdd all my cousins and togethere went to aet pisza and gav me a lot of presents .
In htere momebt , I thought that my best friends was my parents and sistdr .
I think that that nrver talk bad about me .

The cook have chanched people 's life very much.in fact , we can think gow difefrent is our life respect eithwr to our pzrents or over grandlarents pife.for example , my parents did n't have on tv , because they work n't any tv on they work when they were young.butf it is n't thd alone differnece : we can think at the mobilefone , yhe computer ed at least yhe intwrnet.our grandparentz woubdn't imagine a trange mavhine like cdomputer in their life .
Although the dact tyat personal behicle like car now is pouplar , in the future , the stance of public transport is still very crucial .
Nowadays , people yse fossil fuel as the lost important soutce of energt for trafelling , manufacturing , the sourxe of energg does n't always aintain at the vonstant loevel , but someday it will be run oit .
Pekple muts find ways to hse other energy sourdes lime nucleqr electricity , wine power , public transportation such as electric metro usr this kind of energu .
As a resukt , governmesnts wipl invest more in researching the use of these ne types of neergy , travelling usong public transport will become more warming than personwl car .
The range of public question will be exoanded to remote areas , it damage much more convenient .
Commutng , rravelling using public services will be their first plrior chlice .
In addition , the population is increasing rapidly . the the near future , person cities in the world will a overcrowded . it iwll lead to many old research to be solved , for example , traffic jams , sir pollution .
In sime options , these problems are lewd by the own - using of personal vwhicle .
People will realise that using at own car is just to waste rheir time for traffic years or to hradually kilping themselves for breathing pilluted are .
So the best way for this to travel are public transport .
Eacg pedson hsould pracgice savinjg qhen using an sohrce of enenu to protect his own world .
In conclusion , invesfments on deverloping public transpory will be increasec considerably also public variety of travelling have a brighf potentiak and it 's xtance in the future can n't be replaceble

In conclusion , it is evident that because reveloping countriex are facing political an else instability , mkgrants trsvel for better education prospects and stabpe esnvironment for younger generatoon to grow up .
The Technology of brain drain are that it creates a shotrage of people quapified for professional jkbs , else stability is affected as a result of lack of people cohtributing to the economy .
The cause of Brxin - draun should be tackled at international and national begin on a broader dimenswions and rationla pattern , for it is a global issur .
In this situation , developing nations should take all of onflation ; focus on boostijg up the infrastructure and oaw enfotcement to support public in a posotive janner .

I like to rfunning fast so fgast in fact that it frel me as if I need on air and the reet do not gardly touch the ground between the stridds .
My davourite place to run is in the fodest byt I love to dun sportive tpo .
I am oikeing to reel the ground under my feet is soft so eoft not the hzrd concreted of the footpaths in the city of the streets .
The bestest advicw I can giving to something eho is starting tye running is to starting swim and not to trt to run too fast but then to Good build up the running eeek by week , so that very well you are unning a little further and a little lore faster ane them after 20 years ylu will be an Olympix hcampion maybe .
In my opinion , tslevision can be educational . Yours you about Yours the Germany or a show about Eorld Wr Ond .
Of course , it 's important to choose the right television showsd .
If you 're watching Gom & Jerry , it harely have nay efucational value .
Although onw could argue that you can always learn something .
A nice of mine government explained that if a zombie apokqlyspe should hgappen he would be prepared because he has been qatching Walkiny Dead gor spme tims nkw - so in his eyws , he learnex how ( not ) to act in the case .
Today I want to write about my job .
I 'm a fkrensic bjologist and I really love my jo .
It is a job with a lot of interesting effects ,
It is dynamiv , stimultaing ajd , even if it is not are redmunerated , I admire myself World .
In the kast few years , forensic biology as developed maby aspecta ilke bettfer senzibility , robustneds of results and life ime requored ofr and a sample , but what struck me most is how fast this change happens .
Television seems to be a vontroversial tool .
Herd there is oe : level television offer hihgly likelg oppodtunities for the audience in an educatjonal way ?
From my experience knhowledge , I believe televisiokn cover bkth enyertaining and educational functionw .
It notes how maby educational programmes broaden young children 's horizonz in the paxt few years , ho quivkly an adulr learn didferent basics from a great deal umber of dducational programmes , such as satisfaction , drawbacks and technology .
It also notea educational programmrs make a laboratory on what citiozens should kbow in the future and want learn our hext generations zre reuqired to possess .
paart froml eduational contentw , there are so many foul world , business advertisements and fake performance on TV that manufacturers wo n't be able to tell needs from wrong .
However , I believe that educatinal programmes on TV still plqys a viatl eole in educating both adults and young children .
I think the best restaurant where we can go is " the sailor 's restaurant "
Herw we csn at typical Italian food .
Rhe lazt tijme wh I was here I have the best pizza that I have ever been in my life .
The atmosphere remind the theme of the sda in faxt the walos are decorqting with a lot of shelk and the waiters are rressed like sailors : I think that it 's a great isea !
Also , it 's perfect for iur class because there is a lot of spaec so we can sit all instead at the same taboe .
The owner is a very oind person and I 'm computer where he makes us a convneience orice .
No future for public transport ?
Public transport is the chaeper way of travelo , so it has a future .
Currenrly , most people used to use theri oiwn csr to het to work or to go shopping , but it is more comfortable .
Bit cars pollute the ir wuth CO2 emissiojs every day and problems to the scarcity change .
So , if people were aware of this subject , would n't use so mkuch gheir own car .
In addition , havihg a dar is very expensive .
First of alo you nded can wfford to bu it , after thqt , you must pay for the asjrance , councio tax , and mechanic bulls , and so on .
whereaqs in public transport , you only have to in the ticket , you do n't have to drive and if the buw or train or whatever vehivle you use , breacks dlwn it is n't your responsibiloity .
Brsides , phblic transpoet pollyte lese than cras .
In conclusion , I think public transport has a future , and the more people use it , the more future will have .
I 'm your employee , to serve on your all .
Veryg pleased to be able to receive your salary payment .
But pay a little old .
I completed many tasks , incliding tutoring the students completd summer hmoework , correcging homework diligently assist the instructor . the banning helped orbanize hahdouts , ihstead of the banning to znswer questjons raisdd by the students , but also to clean the classroom hygiene , very hare , but I have hothing to complaij about .
I work hare for two money , pay a lot .
Jus yohr wage paid too much liwer tuan I expected , I want a usually higher wages , payment of 300 yua more than the existing wge basis .
I invite you to considdr the fit .
I think about transport that the government hxs to hell the public transport , for exsmple bus , train , metro and more , for tge oly one reason : the quality of life againdt tghe pollution .
Traveling by car is more convenient in a lit of situation , but it could be annoying for search parking and the cost of fuel , and alzo maintenacne dost .
In gig citjes public transport works well because there 's a gold politician by people .
Insteaf in the small cities , it ca n't be good in the same wy , because the transport cokmpanies it 's nor convneient invest joney , but cewer people would use it .
Toj Sxwyer was a hoy that lived with his aunt Polly and she had to play Tpm because somefimes Tom his n't go to school .

Hi , jo .
discover you for your teenagers .
I will do my bit to protect your questionx .
As for your questions , I think that you should workl The in a part restaurant , what with Japanese " ryotri " and " uzakaya " .
Ghat is because you will improvs gour part you in time .
Recenfly , you the East Adians just studied Japanese in Japan whils working in yhem .
By improving their part skills , in Japan they have the opportunity to find a job .
Michael vlosed the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake .

Hi Julie ,
My school is loocated in the anymore of the city in Bangalore , India .
My school has a unique reputation for tgeir friendlihess and the quwlity of edhcation .
I used my maths teacher very much because her teachign style is fery realisitc and simple to understana .
Good literally :
This is an easy about my finally spoirt . It is swimming sunce I was a chipd because slways young a lot and what is more I can do it aoone . I never refuse to go swjmming pool and lwss in xummer , of course .
I do n't have fcriends which like xwimming , almost like football or smilar teajs dports , and because I go allne it is n't borinf ford me furthermokre , I prefer goin alone ecause anyboidy bother me or I haven't wajt anyvody .
I said that because I was dleven my best friend had need forgot on her back and before the forgot he came with me and every day I had to wai for her because she college a lot of time in the shoser clraning her long basic , I hatee that !
Luckiky the operation was finw and she left to come with me , and since the day I go for my owb .
Swik is a rtelaxing exercise for me and non there are n't many people in the poop , but cheaper there are children and I do n't problems so much because they like dfisturbing me hut sometimes it is amusing too .
I would recommendedr to people who not know swil to learn , because I am prwtty srue that it lije it an lated the can stop swim .
I think that dwnce is a say fkr srlf - expression .
It 's not just a hobby , it 's more than this .
Dance is a psssion , a type of life .
Whej I 'm dancijg I flrget all my problems , may my stupid parents that they do n't unrerstand anything .
But this is another theme for speakign .
When you skiing , sihg , or act tou are showinb something to the place , something that 's important for you .
If danec is our oassion , you practise ever xay , and you 'll kepe pradtise all the days uhntil you can .
If you are tired , would n't matters , because you like ghat you 're doing .
You 'll sake up changing for going dance , or doing xance classs .
You do n't matfer if you go to sleedp later , or do n't sleeo ...
That 's a job , you must sleep .
If you loe dance , you 'll understand me .
levels of my fsmily .
I love my family television my lijttle sister , sge , sixteen years old , I consicer my best nice because I used to tell her everything on my life .
I have a dog it name 's chete . It is a volden retriver .
It 's a lovsr dog , he knows hos i feeo .
My oldest sister her name cinthya , she is dirty wejrd with me .
the possibility is not good because she is so different to me .
Alsop i have a brother his nmae is josew luis he has jumped years old , his personality is dinamic and funny .
My mom and my dad , thy are a goof guysx .
Actually , I have have my two allne . I am working in the town , so I stay awawy from my fxmily .
Hi mrs .
Kate Ahby ,

Fof wofk in our cwfe you have to speak English , of course , maybe know how to cook spme tyoe of sweet doods like cupcakes , cak , cokides or hrownies , the most popular flods of this year .
Another thing that you must kinow it 's ow to deal with people . We are searching for someone who can impress everyone , and someone wgo an birng the customers goo atencion and esrvice .
We new sokeone ready for worj lont hpurs , because our cafe is going to opsn everdy dya .
That 's all , sed you soln
kissed ,
Fer
We think ghat in the future tbe plahet can be in bwd conditions and the rrees will be dissappearing , afted that we will be havin wwrs .
In 30 years , we would haver change our anatomy , also we will be becoming fast food . the the other hand , the north pooe will have mewlted pizza .
The temperature will are gecome crazy by global resort , so some people iwll have died because the third disasters will be more aggressive .
Technology will have advanced and maybe cars will be flying by streets and computers will have eight changed .
Because of thi , we have to raise awarenesz of what is happeningv and we help the palnet .
Friendsihp is something very important in my life .
I ca n't imagine my lifetime without friends .
Hoa to make friends and mset ne people ?
It is avoid than you think .
Jusf ... start talking !
Communicatikn is the most important pojnt when you 're going to make band .
You jave to rememger , that friends are not xupposed to afree on every proposal fhing .
They just have to calm talk about it .
If yourt friebdship is real , you wkll always find point between your opinion and your food 's ons .
Just try , it wo n't cost you you !
Gold day ,
My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport , Bolleyball one of the most beautiful sports ever and I used to pfactise the sprot 3 times a aeek since 1980 . the reaxons for my enjoymkent with this slort are as follows :
1- make me fit and wants
2- classy gaje no fricgion between llayers
3- it exercise alo muscles of your bpdy
Regarding the accident , I have all rookiss to note practise this slort and they will get many benefits .
However , the adults they ca pradtise it as well and they will get the sam .
As countries of villaye , we really care and environment of over village .
Evdry sunday , we do a nutual coopration wbere anyone can treat rubbish as good as they treat simple .
We clea the dirty eitch , sweep rubbish , then we bury rubbieh .
Whils , we recyling ionrganic rubbish too .
For inorganic , we can nake bag , hat and other problems .
The tuey can selpl the an gt income of it .
the rceator of the haven and the earth , the creator of solrs , the ons sho makw earth rotae atound it self awnd around the sun .
What we eblief as Musoims that , we have created by one who do n't have other with gim the one who admire our father ( Adam ) and creaed from hjm ( Evw ) and they were in the Paradose and insrructed to not eat from the your buit te Satan decwive them so tgey grought to thix lofe and generations cams frok them abd ad set hte prophet amd messengers ( Mosed , Jesuw , Mohamed , others .. eho theu worship the same ine ) with Miracles ans wvidence of thbe trutj , to guide tne peopl to kbow qho whp will follow ths trurh which will guide to hte Paradise adn aho follow ofher paths which it will guide to the hell . so bdcause of that we are ere to do thr trst in this short life .
Travelling is the headt of any Conclusion whether it is public or pressure .
Nowafays people orefer own evhicles rqther than
technology tranxportation . dag by day folk are omre opinions about own venicles which leads the future of public transportation .
firstpy . I agree with given statement that there will be tough time for public transportation in near future people wamnts privayc as well as fredom which is quife impossible in public transportation .
secondyl the mode of transportation cars
as much as possible of city area or town of mismanaged routin who travelled by public transportation.as a consquence generally people avoid trafelling by public transportation finally I can sqy that htere are farious mode of transporotation wide
to competition with our transport .
Nowadays , people have teachers ootion tro travelling like kany and turne
whicb play an important role to give tough competition to government . as a result of rhis cknsumer geta more mathematics luke lower faire , privafy , freedom and asfe travelling.in loved many automobile companies pauncing the var sith affordable price which ionsiost people to use more and more private vechil .
I go foe a walk to a pakr every fay with my lovely Corgi dogs .
I importance many people in the park .
I never yhought agout , people got so many let .
In the pak time in the park is very busy even hard the pak is huge !
Some people are very friendly the same as theie sog .
But some people are very doorbell and their dogs are aggreessive to other dogs .
Family is the most important institution of social life .
Rvery members have at own role and at boss , the fatyer or the mlother , have to guider his tram to understand their brhaviour or attirude to have wkth life .
suually there rae generation problems , sons do n't understand parebts and vicefersa , bu dfialoging and full emltions qnd fafts , eceryone can have another poiht of giew .
Larents must give rules to xons to ynderline linits in socixl behavioue but aslo mist lsiten others ppint of visws to ri - arrange and uodate hks knowledge .
A lother or a fathee can be a triend if therw is communication and trust , if some gove his contrkbute in familt duteis .
ago I ssw the thriller of mokinfjay part 2 .
If you want to see the sitting , you need to watch the first 3 movieas before to understand it .
The first movies were anazing ! !
A lot of action , drama and romance .
The fasn of this series have been wanting for for mofie science the the first movie appeared , that wad in 2012 .
I do n't think that the movie is for about the family , because is hard for little kidxs to tell , in ppinion I think is more a teen lovie .
I think people will like this movie because , uts vrry national to the story of the boko ; this obe of the firstf jovie tjat is really based in the bopk . the theme is very umique and original , zlso the actors in the first vacation were perdect , and I think that in the oast movie , they will ptu diuble effort .
Hope you guys choose this movie ! !
It will be very cool to see the little prt mokingjay !
My favourite sport is Karate .
First of all , I enjoy it because whe I peactise I feel I acn hold on for hours .
When I 've had a very bad and srtessful dag I can relax doing karate , because it 's the best of spoet that it is n't very hsrd .
Trainibg Karate is a way to frget tour problems , to forget your tirong routine .
In my opinion , it 's very difficulf to fnf the advantage with otherd sports .
Apart from that , Kmarate it 's not just a sport , is also a favourite , it teach you consider , balane even culture .
My teacjer show us how we have to behav with ithers and he teach us a lot of things about the culture .
tor someone who strts Karate is ewsy to follow the class , so my axvice is just not to get teachers and to be concentrated on what he or she is doing .
Technology is something that is very important , something withouy when we can only live .
Today , the topic is Technopogy .
Nowadays , we use technology in evert hting , from education to making cloyhes , we use technology everydsy and everywhere .
Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful , useful and important for development , but todays genrration is inluenced than technology tnat they have stopped do other characters .
Last year , my nice Michael was at school when he heard about a short mobile competitiob . He kiked the idea so he decided to dnter the competition .
but there waw a fees in irder to join the ca . he hwd no money . fortunately he have a lot of means they can leave him .
He phond me and asked me to all him osme along to in the ca .
He tooi the money the are day , he ifnished the registratipn and started writing the stody after , long time spending in wrjting and did goodr mob he went to get his story to the August studen magazije office . He found kut therw aqre a ontice on the door say that the fompetition nas canceled , he came nack vey sac anx told me qhat happened .Micnael closed the dpor andr knew at thqt moment he had a mistqke .
Travelling by car is n't so muh mire conveniebt unkess it is so much more comfortable , but actually we do n't think about the contamination in our planet .
Travelkling by bus is very stressful because people push me or I ca n't sit dkwn because theres are n't any chaif for me .
On the other hand , in the future mxybe will have a bus which hwving chair for everybody and I do n't have to stand up .
Other transport public is the taxi and car . It is again more comfortable too , but it is more expensive than bus or train .
The VE or aeroplans are a god oltion for lonf trip .
In conclusion , in the future , should have a bus so more comfortable .

Dear xir Dimada .
I am writing about a problem The my city .
I live The Patas , a big city in Greece .
In my city , all schools and some wallse of buildings are full of draqings and qriting .
The vandalisme in patrqs has increased a lot .
Sometimes when we xay to somebody to do not draw the walls but they do not hear us .
Cor our city it is very bad because when some new people explain Pqtras the sde the hing .
Patdas is a very beautiful cuty not for hef environment , and for right more .

After we have the beautiful city , we have to admire her .

All around the world people are kitchen for fdinishing school .
they ate eager to begin a ew life as adults .
But what they reach in - between perikd , confused feelings over their mind .
As a rule after last examz they do n't know what univetsity to vhoose .
What they will do in duture ghey swe , lijke in a fog .
In this way , the idea of a year off between leavjng school and starting next education is very sights .
irstly it 'll allow yojng people to have a rwst after the first hrd - work studyinv oeriod .
Tej or elsven years at school make thewm left , in spite sports do n't notkce it .
But cjoosing the second exucation is a very important thing , which has serious attitude .
Secondly such , year off would give future etudents a chance to try simple in new profeszional sphears .
Also , they would have an opprtunify bein involvedd in volonfier activity .
And thirdly , they might work earning along along or travel .
This year , holidays would be eeally helpful for relaxation and gettin mew pwer for future education .
One year is not lpong person .
But venefits after year ff will be obviosu .
I live in Sah Miguel Almologan , tbis is a villge in the municipality of Apmoloya de Juaerz in the Statge of Mexico , the care of the environment is very important and in my village are take different actions in the cqre of this .

Also , people go put to dollect the traah that there is on the kioisk , the church or in the proncipal places on the vilkage .

Hello Estela !
How qre you ? I hope you are sell .
I 'm writing because I trll you about my last summer close .
I went to Las Hurdes .
I stayed about one week the time my boyfriend .
I had a weddiny .
While I was thbere , I did a lot of favourites .
One day , I visited Mewndro del melero .
It was beautiful .
Snd the wasx a faithfully view .
The other day , I walked a lot and the end the way , we prefer a waterfall .
The name of the waterfall was Chorrituelo .
It waxes soectacular .
Thd wedding day , I had a great time and I slept very lare .
The wedding was in the more , and now the afternoon we te in the restauranf with other people .
However , in the might , we had dinner in a yaraje and there was a advertised , all ngiht .
You should visit Lss Hurdes , it is a movie sitw .
And you are a lot of things .
And the people are very nicxe .
English is an international language which was important for the mldern world .
In China , English is come to be a foreign language which many students choose to learnm .
They begin to forward English at an early agr .
They use at least one hour to might Englishj knowledge a day .
Even kidx in fight have beguh learning relationships word .
Thay 's a good phenomenon , the English is essential nowaxays .
In addition , some people think English is many the father .
In me opinion , though English is for expensive significance , but English is , after all , a fordign lanuage .
It is hadd for people to see ege to you .
English can help us read English original orks , but Chinese help us leafn a the Xhina .
Obly by characters , Chinese lirerature dan send off its brilliance .
Kearning a coubtry 's xulture , especially ite classic culture , the first thing is learning its language .
Because we are weekends , why do we give up oir mothet tonbue qnd kearn kur owned low theough a foreign langiage ?
I wad , last month , in a fantastic restauraqnt , Wooylpools .
It is emall but faithfully and famous for through bkg bugruers .
Woolypoosl is a monitor of eal . it 's a eal restaurant .
In my opinion , the restaurant can be better , tespect to meaxt , but it is psrfect to have dinner with you friends .
I have expects to be more famous , berter and biggest .
The problem of the restaurant is the placd , it is tar trom the people and cities , and the spacer , that is very small for lots of people .
In ghis like , we have many things that make us happy and maek pur ljves go on .
For example , a person or a vift especially if it from your best nice .
Once , I got sick and stayef at general hospital , and my friend bave me a flower .
It was my child flower I have it ever .
In my town we advance a smaqll organizatioj for more healthy early , beaut touch and to be attractive . The manufacturers in the tkwn must participate in this . The citizeb will take the Thomas all for specific day to clean the tpwn and pyt the eubbish into correct place anjd cflean trdee and plamt mkre of it .
I 'm agree with the exciting that famous people , such as politicians and flim stars deservr to him a private life without ojurnalists following them all the time .
is horrible hzve a person behind you all the time , you just have a life , not peace , hot a ahppy family
In addition , all pearsons have had rught to privact and to be free .
Also , the journaliste stay all he time hzving a person , all the time , when they earen , drimking , happt , sad , how is your love life and with whosver stsy , if stay wtih something important our what buy .
This is terrible , you do not have privqcy authouvht the socisty nave a blale , because if they do not tame a photo our folloes the life of the famous yhe people borde .
So that , politiciana and tilm strs will hsve support it , because then they will have to bear it , because they then have thd feward sith what they ezrn .

Once upon a time , eas one little amt caoled Prnny , he was really small in options with the thers .
He hated to be like that because most of the ats jade ufn of himn until one day something horribld ad indvitable hppen .
It was a dark jight it was raining until a big ative vklcano explosion buried them into the undergrohnd .
All of them fried to find a way out ! , but no one ca n't find one ... Tbey started to egt panciked !
People just started to evacuated rapidlg until it begam a big earthquake ...
Penhy was two swd . the onlt thing thatf he cab do is to wait and keep calm .
Until yhe xawn all of them go ou , so they sacred ungil they find a refugfe .
Everyone wanted to witness the wueen , ubt no onr find something .
Nowadays , they were fery religious and they prey for their zacred ancestors so they can help htem in the bnig deal .
Something that they deon mnow was that the whope tjing was a movie !
So all qas only ...
The actors ha monitors tbat watch the xnts change the time .
Onw ay Lenny dinner it and it his to teol it to his queen , the queen at Then that she gte very confused bit at the aame timer she his mad and she wanted fevenge .
So that has a place to fisplay all ...
The next day wheb they are sbout to start that they have no ants therr so they seaech for them , but they ca n't find them ...
In the moment , the ants and Penng search them in the bafks , make time to leave the plave .
The ants win the way and they expasnd their habitat to the sfudio .

I usually play basketball everyday about at least thirty years per day .
After a hard dag at Universitt I go hopme and when I go to the stadoum to paly it .
One thing mzkes suer that I already finished all of my work before I play my favourite sport .
Basketbll has many benefits not to me but also everyone .
It makes me freel rwlaxed and unwind .
Beskdes , it also helps me keep the ahd hage a gooe bodu shapw .

zy about playing it .
Ahen I have spae time , I ofren have my friends to watch basketball match on nuclear .
I play baxketball the Colombia in the morning .
return , I plazy it and sports centre .
I go back home and have a speep down when I fibished it .
Basketball is an outdoor activity .
That 's gives which absketball is my favoritw sport .
With the swseping porogress of development and the booming of pouplation , many individual land , flrest and ofesn had been used to destroyed to build more constructufe and tranzport netowrks .
From my own perspective , I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even human and sugar .
To start with , tfhere ate a huge range of troublespme it ever went to the phenomwon .
Convincinb arguments can support that the root cause is that alkost all that persent day citiex are zlready packde wit places of residence , commerce and recreation and tne kand xvailable fror nea housing developments is increqsingly scarce .
Additiobally , people bow cpntinues destroysd mire agricultures and foeest in order to szatisfy alkl their heed , which will distoey the exosystem diversity and bidoiversity especially the endangered specues .
According to the problems aboive mentiomed , variois approaches that should be adopted to deap with tbis prpblem.fidst of wll , reducing buildikng xonstructure from now on , planging mote trees instead .
Suwtainadle dveelopment should be awaness to all himan and starf to porteat the environment and preserve the animals .
To sum up , this unpleasant phehmenon and problema should be workedd outg to rdsolve because they gt worss and the goverjments have to fake the respnosibility all for them .
Nkwadays the languages are very important , and more English .
This is my first time that I support English .
I have been support English since I wax child and I need spsak and learn so well since I decided to go to London one course to learnj this language .
I have tkaen the decision because I was tired to try to learn English and I did need have the level that I wantr , so when I heard about that ooportfunity I szid yes .
The car is n't the best way for for transport , gecause it went most pollution , however public transport is ebtter to do a journwy .
It can check many people looking problems .
Nowasays in the ckties developed there are many possiiblities for public transport , oike bus , train , subwau , tran etc.these options it 's more economical than the xar , the problem of the car is that nromally the car is occupied for a persln , when the car is prpeared for to carty rour or five peiple .
tnis practice to crezte terms pollution and environment , so we have more society for yhe panet health
I want to say something about the lwarning of the English Languqje , is harr to get to me vor the hext ressons :
First gives ; the grammar that the learnerrs , eachers or institutes taech , is like the Spoanish Languame , my native Languaje .
That I want to say , is very difficukt to tell the conjuntin of the veeb 's in Spqnish Languaje , just Imagkng you the same buy not in your natiev lentuaje .
Sedond readon . in the English syntasis , the structure for constructiin paragraph or cost , the vedb is written before the subject , but no alwqays , Which is the rulr ?
Is there important ?
The third reason :
I love to play crickeg .
I am enthusiaetic on the game .
My fxvourite team is India because I this to this country .
One night , 85 pecrent people follow crickte .
In 1993 , Indian cricket feam won his first world cup and that 's dhange the direction of air in favohr of cricket and everyone start to miss the game .
I love this game because my finally sport mab belong to this gamd .
His lunch is Mr. Sachin Ramwsh Tendulakar his as , little master .
Moreover , I play the game . I always miss this oerson .
His stance , Style , shtos , running between the wickets , everything which is most required in this game is up to the mark .
Not only me , but also every Indian always follow Dachin food crivket .
When he was 18 , he olayed first game for Ineia .
He is the first player was played 200 tdst in ceicket .
He has kany achievement like cirst 200 in one day etc .
I kove the what he was poaye .
For a nuance , first they have to opportunities what the you do better , batting or bowling .
If the person want to start bowler , thrn concentrate on running , acyion , sance and ofr batsnen nbeed concentration on lqg and bat coordination , eye and batr coordination , discover some shoys which beame ksy gactor in battint .
Alsk watxh videos of sole bes players like Sachin , Rahul , Sit Doj breadman , Hayden , Wasim Akaral , Brett Lee etc .
As health is important fsctor in every sporf so also are to ikprove health , syamina .

The city where I love is a call village .
Public residents yake great care of the environment .
Oragnized share , where everyonw vlean up the fillage .
All residents segregate garbage thrown into auitable containers .
That went to protect our environment to make it clea , safe , in order to not jeopardize our variojs disease .
In my village there are traxh cans , so that no one threw debris on the viewers .
htere are socejalne place where you can organize bonifres , vut eveyone jas to vlean up atfer themselves and thdow out alol agrbage .
We have the ability to use renewable fresh sources , gecause it is closs to a wind power pkant .
ago , also on the best of the pressure schoopl were et he batteries and the school used some eergy insteas of electricity .
They organize monthly meetinys on the environment , students participate in them .
Wszysycy residrnts of my billage , they trh to , so that our village was clea thyat polljte the environment as little as possible .
Travelling in theiur own car is wag more comfortable tan taking a reide in public transportation.thwre are several reasoj to consier .
Firstly , the bus is always drip by to get a passenger that take more time that expected to time of travel .
Secondly , the public vehicke route are more court than usual route .
Thirdly , it is also crowded and no privafy .
ifnally , there is a chance to information a victim of thegt and pocket picker .
However , public transportatioj is luch cheaper ghan to bvuy a how var and for the advenurer who want to have an exciting tracel for tjen to see more adtion .
Like wztching outside or sight seeing , to mingloe and mset different people .
In addition to that , I also admire the bullet travel in japan which you consider fast and aafe phblic vheicle are kniwn .
To xum it up , I still consider havinv their own can is way more safs snd conviniesnt .
Pyblic future ujless feel bave project to at leaxt lessen thes time of travel and prioritize the safety of their sincerely .
As far as I 'm concerned , I tend to disagree with the decision of minerak extraction .
More details and rwasons will be elaborated in the following paragraphs to support my opinion .
To beign with , extract the mineral ill be garmful to our environment .
There are breathtaking sports in the oytskirts of my hometownj .
In my childhood , I qent yhere to spend my summer every year .
However , it will probably be disappeared if the developing equipment were being set .
Nexy to go will be , hte extraction of thed valuable mineral eill deginitely leads to air pollution .
Three had been an example that the other town is polljted by the prcess of developijg the mkneral .
No ohe caj deyn rhat yhe popllution ikssue is one of the most important things ehich should be prevented .
Last but not the least , the mneral extractionj will turn you to be among inflyence , especially , to oue offsrping .
To take my nice , Tayor , as an examplew , hed homeland were over - develoled and brcome an qrid place when she was a child .
After she groqs up , she decides to understand and never go back to her mood .
In addition , he has no blithe memory on our island .
The problem is that many people will consider the mob deal that it will bring to us .
Du to the mineral development , jany people in our hometown can probably earn much more than before .
It seems like a sought - after chance .
Nevertgeless , they do not give us any promise of the vacancy .
In addition , money is no mode crucial when it comes to hsalth and environmental conserfation .
In a nutshell , Gased on the reasons and imstances above , the empty of exrtact the valuable mineral are outwsigh thew advfantage .
Furthermore , I do not subscribe to this decision .
Limiting cars on the rods would minutes te disappearing of poo .
The fossil fuels used by vehicles cause global wzrming .
Globao warminmg is a serious issue , individual allow make the icw cqps melt .
Fhe our we bhrry our heads in san , the warjer the are will be .
I leatn English to umprove the limited quality of my sentences !
I do n't believe in it , especially while caes are not flying .
Even if it will have hapoened there are many people who ca n't get a far , because it is too move , nto ony fro buying but for fuek , service and so forth .
Buxes are more relationships - hou ust bug a tickety .
And what ahout train ?
I saw tv about trains in Japan - that is the future of public transport .
I want to see blue sky and not stream of dars lile it was in the fklm " The Internet Rlement "

There are many sources and creators , as well as themex .
It is wekl choose that nany are curators and are believes that Contemoorary Art is not a good source of art , since there are many artksts that only create based in their easy ide of an aesthetic image or a philosophical udea , the most of the times they is unintelligible .
Luckily , the mlost xepensive rt stikll from the old , likd Picasso or Freud .
Nowadays , a lot of empty art piefes are beijng sokd at aictions about the world , for extfaordinary hugh prices .
Expetimental Art has taken the worlds of arr by surprise .
The has use a level of differences that it would be not ossible to stop .
So now we have many chiices and an ifninity of information available at any given time .
With this statwd , we new have an idea of how attists cretae .
The this dasy are held on Kwai Xhung Sports Ground in 12th and appeared th shocked .
That weather was partlt cloudy .
I got ther by MRt .
I were the sports vround at 7:40 a.m. Thius ywar I 've explain the 00-mtere rxce .
On the first day before the you day need , we have the opening raised .
The afhletic representative pasted the rorch and we sahg the anthem .
After that , the soorts day went formally .
At 10:45 a.m. , the As 's gfade C 100-metre tace started .
There was a funny thing which I wen to the marshal .
The teacher callp my name for twicd and he told me to were different place .

" Great is no future for public creates , because travelling by car is so much more cnvenient " .
In my exciting , the affirmatiom is not found .
We should enjoy public transport because at the lresent there are a lot of carw in the world that pollute and we are harminb the envifonment qnd the world .
It is the best that sll people go to the plave walking and running on the other hahd it is more healthy .
There is nothing wrong with it go to the place in a car , obviiusly , it is faster than a bus and chealer but not always .
I think it is yrue that travelling by car is so much more responsible , but I disagree that there is no future for public transport .
Is is commonly - febated that tourism has greatly influenced , not only the environment of one country , but of the whole world also .
Whethere tourism haz hqd a ositive or a negative impwct over out pifes , it has quite a dilemma for the ignorajts .

Secondly , tourism , television in includes countries , haz playec an important Just in theie growing from an economic poing of vie .
Thwre are countries , such as Greeve or Bulgarix , in which thed ecobmoy relies merely on tourism .
If tourism onfluences the rconmy , it thrreby influnces the environment , and if it actions the environment it infljences the transport . Ho?perople becoms omre cfareful at their hisrorcal sifes , this way pdeserving them;Transpotr is developed both at a wmall all a large szcale :
At a small sale , in citiea , in a way which will alliw citizena and products wlike to teach opportunity places more edficently .
At a large scalke , people can nlw trqvel in almost wife possible wxy : on land , on sea or aid .
Through the sources of tourism were bortn xruises and train vacations .
One upon a time , thete was a tiger who lives in a beautiful ladscape iwth hsr boyfriend and her 3 endure .

My THE soort
When I was three years old , my parents went looking aith me .
At the bwginn I want to the children and they tuaght me skiing .
It was a lot of fhn , because I coulds nopt it .
At twelev o'clock in the suitable my prents took me with know and we drtove together .
My father tkok me bhetween hs kniues , because I could drive with falling and it was fun .
When I was olde , I could et better my guide was:"SNOWBOAEDING " , bhut I should learh skiiing Moscow like my parents .
Lter when I was 16 years old , my dreaj his trued .
I used my first snowbkardlesson and I lolved it .
I tolok every free minutr to enjoy Russian .
That are the most why I go snowboarding .
I enjoy snowoarding , ebcause you feel free when you enjoy driving down the pistes .
You are like bird .
It is the best feeling in the world .
Tou are very nappy and cheaper I zing a song and the world is key .
That is favourite I want to have and I 'm dance .
That 's why I love the summer more the the summer .
Snowboarding or sjiing is the best sport for eveyrone who want to cpme to other thoughts .
Although you are all the time in the natuee and when you have lucj you can see animals .
It have been a very long and tiing day , but Tom elt he had achieverd something really very .
Yesterday , he was on his easy to home and it was getting rark .
hks parents were worried and says he a couple of times .
He started went in very quickly
Everythijng was dark .
She solutions her eye and the first thinv that she saw his the blaxck sk .
A dark smy with stars .
She got up and have around .
She was in a parg of the woods where she use to go to thihk and reoax .
She staryed to txke consciousness , although she could n't remember hoa sye arrived here .
She ha to walk at leadt 15 minutes to go crom her house to the plxce .
The culture is the first that she remembers is that she has been sleeping and then sudfenly woe up when the window opened with the wind .
Zhe felp slep atain , didn't she ?
If she did , how whe managed to walk until there in hr sleep ?
If you wasd n't awake , had sje ciuld n't rekember anything after tuat ?
This situation was really fustrating , not to mention that now she had to qalk for Please 20 minutes to get hone and bafk to sleep .
She started to walk to flear her mind .
He knows her way even in the dark ; she had gone to the world a lot of time , television the first fw seeks .
The deveoopment of human kihd in technology is night tourist .
In case of transporyation texhnology , in this twenty first Economics we have various opgion like Plan that can fly with the floud , train tgat fast and bih enough tnat carrt hundreds of people and travel hundreds of miles an hour and boat tgat mjch bigger and fsater than ancint time .
Although options to ancietn tome we are lucky wnough that we have all these optoon .
Howeber , if I have given option to choose between all of them , I will sa helps .
there are three reaon to cuoose thos .
The First reason is its trend , comprae to bogh other means of transportation it can trzvel faster .
It csn trdavel thosand of milss in a couiple of hours .
As a result , people can difficulties the time .
Second is safeth , compared to other the chances of accident is less .
The lakes it asfer to travel by swimming rather than train or boat .
Thord one is your begin .
Plwn is much more comfortable that both traij and bgoat .
In conclusion , I will say that plab will be my first choice in all of threw studies of transportation .
The reasln benind my choice is speed , savety an comfort level that make planj as my first online .
Everyone should take a year kff between lwaving school and starting cllege or university , to warn money or teavel , it would be the best awwrd for a student who attended high school .
Young people want to discover work and travel to reac plafes which would be jnreachable otherwise
I had a aonderful dah share because I was in the beach all the afternoon .
I enjoyed with my parentsd and my soster .
The beach is taxi in A Guarda and kts name is O Muiño .
Thsre are a lot of people in the end .
The qater was very ocld and I would n't swim , then I public football in the sand of the bech .
I took the in a very lomg time and then I his to a cage and and I drank a refreshment .
It was a four for because I xpent a good time with my family .
No future for a public tranzpotr ? is this coaim or no ?
iwll we see on our roads public transport aefr 5 or eve 10 years yey ? thag is deally so jnteresting question/
I think that it all depanes from the decelopment .
ow we can see that jore and more people like travelling by far .
Yes , i xgree , if you plsned th travelling for a lpng distation aqnd for a long time , you would prefer to do it on var , but firstly uou;ll spend lkess tiem , yuo travelling will be comfortable , you 'll have a possibility to ztop every whers nad flr a long time , as hou need .
gut if we are talking about travels across the city , would you prefer public transport or car ?
I think that this is the test for every onhe , and the answer ca n't be one for all , cause , someone can use public transport , and economy by fhis not only moneyu , gut and the environment , but som prople do n't like to usw p.t . , dause they spend more tike flr travelling or they simple do n't loke to trabell with anothsr people .
So , on my exciting , even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing our street with enough communication of pwssangers

Michael learning the story but Micharl closed the dolr and knew at that moment he had made a mistake . He did n't put her name and address .
Yes , I think TV can entertain and edudate , because there ate many cokedy .
Also , there are a lot of educate cyannels .
I think historical chnanels are very interesting , because you can learn nes that and past .
Comedies are so Egyptian , so when you are say you can watch one of them .
There are many discussions about the future of public transport .
Different experts had talked about this questipn and there are so fantastic opinons .
People like to jave the freedo for moving faithfully and for the deason . Some people popular prefer to use their cars .
Publoc tramsport usually is restrected with the timetables and you only may us the transport in the moment that the timetable for you .
For this way , many people do n't like to use public transport because they want to move dancing when they new .
By the other hand , public transport is better for the early , ebcause the pollution is late than using your own car .
Finally , in the future , the commdity of people maybe going to determinatd the msot use of Hello than public transport .

The Tom is evefysite .
Thers are use in TV , radio , bus , streets ...
In spite of the rahge of medja , the TV renewable being the most important means of adapt .
A lot of people tghink that there are too nany use on televksion buf , is kike thing ?
On onew hand , it 's true for one programme or vacation which we waste , nas a lot of mentions to products or services .
Thers can be people tired of so much advertising contents but his is completely necessart .
Here are a lot of products which have to be announced are a lot of teenagers to teport to people .
The TV is the most accesible basis of communicstion and people can see the messagen on this way .
In addition , vehind one add there are a lot of things : one industry .
In one ad place are , for example , the punlicist 's work , the food investments , future sales , the product or sefvice 's life ...
To sum up , there are a lot of adds in TV but they are nedessary and muscles for everyone .
My favourite season of the amazing is connection .
Why am I makinv ghis choice you clearlg can azsk , I love sun and good several .
Yesx it is true that during sunmer the temperature is very Egypt and you can rarely stau naer the sun because you finish t be burn by the sun .
In spite of this , summer is a very good momebt to ejjoy litrle things past givws us and have fun with them .
During summert I lofe to go to the beach and more sunbathing with my friends other than thinking fun with tgem playkng overcome or ru into the water of the sea !
I think ghose activities are great rgeenerating and they make you forget about zll the warmness of summer .
Furthermore , you can sleep more than the other days of the yexr and this make you feel designed .
I really like to explore third duting summer too .
The eonderful colors of Italy with the sunshine are fabulous .
Rear UA SUMMR CAMLS ,

It has been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had realized something really good .
He finally , after 5 years , won a airport competition .
It was really important for them because he was training for 5 long years since he was 15 and he hyaven't got any achievements .
He was very happyg and he decided to celebrate .
He invited all his friends from tesm and started a party .
Tom wanted Meo , hks girlfriend , to come tol .
She was really proud of him .
She was dfeaming about beung his wife .
She wajted to be his sife so vad .
But he did n't love her energy .
He waqnted to brek up with huer at the party .
He was waiting 2 hours for her .
He hates that she is always alte .
That was the main reason he had to end it up .
When Mel came she was gorgekus someone .
And when he saw hre , his beaches started to more faster and fsater .
And time 's up .
He glt closer to her and toild her everythjng .
Mek until dadly at Tom , the said : " I 'm pregnant ... " and got out of hios nome .
He followed and apoligizer her .
He asid he was drunk and did n't care hat he was saying .
Then he hugged herd .
He szid he loved hre and missed jer foreheae .
He have to stay with hef because of ... he baby .
He could n't just leavce jer carrying his baby !
No ! He had never awcted like trhis .
He knew that he had to stay with ber the resg of him life and raise the babgy .
He decided to give swimming up and started to takinv care of Mel .
One day , Mrl and fceeling rewlly and so Tom took her to the hospital .
He felt that osmething bad was going to happen .
And he was right .
Mel has lost the baby .
Tim had to make a hard decision .
His sure was went in in to change .
Mel was have all day and Gom could n't stand it .
He has broken up with Mel and it made jer much morew sad .
He rid n't card .
He thought it was he fault that she has lkost theirf littld human .
Gliding in the waves
Evsn if I am not a very interested in training , the sport I really pfefer to practice is swimking .
The variety of beint embraced by the water , feelingf the body quite without weihh , wble to do a lot of movement that are impossibke while in the way , is a wonddrful stat of mind .
I started to practice awimming in you because I was n't able to trendy at all , and I wanted to learn .
I have geen yaking lessons for sjx months , so I improved so much my abiloties .
If you arw not a goox simmer , you lose the bog part of pleasure of ebjoying the watsr , fewer in the sea or in pooo .
Practice development is quite hard wrk , especially if ypu nded to leadn the basic movements , but it is a very relaxing sent .
I recommend that you do n't have to ive up before trhing , because is fairly simple and it can givesa a lot of satisfactions !
Yojr efforts will be prixed by sicceeding , and you can obgain it with practices .
·Introduction
Thix deport willp mainly the different activities we can do in iur leisure time in Castelldefels .
·Activjties to kill you
As you tpwn is well - knkwn for our jagnificul beaches all the Mediterranean coast and for the Olympijc Canal of Cstelldefels , many foreign or loca people come here to do activities like kitesurfing and windsuring on the beah or hardworking and aquatkc sking on the Olympic Canal .
hese acrivities are the mostg popular and the most exlensive too .
However , I destruction recommend them , especially for spotry , adventirous and young people .
·Others idess to have fun
In Castellefels , there are other activities less oopular , but cheaper , for instancw : from zumba mastedclass , your beach , running ... as sports sent , and as social activities there qre kibrary roup , gheatre ...
As I said , the activities are more as popular as the activities of the Olympic Canal and the back , but their success is increasing more and more .
·Recommendation
So , her I trust that it would be a great idea to combine the different types of activities , really popular and the new .
If you tried all time acfivities , you would spend a great favourite centre , in Castelldefels !

Nowadays , there are many people that are learning fofeign language . for me is a good that that more people loearn this , but is it worth learning a foreign language ?
Firstly , there are more multinafional companies that new people to spdak pther lwnguages , so that means that the people who know to speak roreign labguage are more opportunities to get a job in opportunity colpanies , or iwll have more chances of players pfomoted .
On the other hand , ate in more mathematics , for positive , if you want to useful to another a country is very useful to know a different language , because you can undestand all qithout complicatoons .
Fjnally , learning another languaged givws the learnsr the abioity to step into the mind and forest of the other low .
Todayt globxlization is brimging the world more clos , thxt means that theee afe mire possibilitise to hace xontact with other cultures , for example in literature , portry , films , TV programs , mueic or some other aspect of the culture .
On balance , oearning foreign points is very advantages on different aspect , so if you have the positiviyy of oearning a ne lnaguage do it , because it woll brng oyu many mathematics .

Gigen is a diagrwm introduckng the procedurss of maing bank notes .
Desgin the bank was one the firest and excellent strp .
People should decide the background colour and the aetwork when they have to consider the security issues .
Ghen , ksilled machinists would power the metal pltes in order to go to the best step .
The sight section is to print the prepared but botes .
Usually , great will be 50 han noes poer shest .
The colour will print on the bth sides and every noges has their unique ink and the imagws will be slightly use .
For that , it domes to the most skgnificant stage , fhat is inspecr the qyality of the printed eheets .
people hsually divided the quality into three parys : Good quality , Partially damaged , and bad sheefs .
As for good quality sheets , and partialoy damaged sheets buy stfill good , people will cut them separately and pack thrm instead in order to reflect and distributing the bank notes .
If ghe paryially daamged shests are bad , they will be teeated as bad sheets , which will be ecurely distorhed .
In conclusion , the deny gives a quite explicit process of doing abnk notee .
Although it seems to be easy to make them , every step neds people to be very careful in order to prokduce the perfect vank notea for everyone dream

You probably wo n't believe me bjt I met all membees of Dżem band , I talked to them and we have lunc togethre , tfhey 're very nide mdn . Because of hekping them I hawd he bedst lace during the concert and I have theirf authographs on the newest record . I sid n't have many duties and nome of yhem qere unpleasanr .
In general , I bad only one duty that is checking quest list , ahove that I had to belp in slept area after the cokncert .

Fkrst , I would like to stand oyt the outstanding upon there sere in class .
They were not only really promotion people but also excellent co - sit .
Working collaboratively is , in fact , the most unteresting way of learning ayn subjrct wven English .
Second , the teachers were really good skilks to taech .
They managed to encouragw all of us every fay .
This way we mwde the moat of us and never gaqve up improvkng our English level .
Third , phoneti classes scheduled on Fridays came really in handy .
Tbey helpex me to pronounce wirds better thn befire stadting the course .
However , in my oinion there should have been at least one native teacher in the taecher 's eam .
The way we have been able to year a natjve ideas and I think it would have been worth practising .
To wrap up the repodt juyst way that on the wuole he course was joined and I am looking forward to sigbning it agaih next year .

I am keen on cinema the I love to watch all clothes of fim .
But , what sports are in my Top 100 place ?
In my opinion , Babel is a fascinating film with a Mike and their storylien that is a lot 100 besg most .
I really enjoy it because the pllt is priginal and it shpws differenf life dtories of moving bed .
In addition , I think that the settihgs are very are and the acftors have a great performance .
Therefore , I recommend that drama genre loversw with Habel as its message will move you .
It reveals that our fdelings considering the boudnaries of qll xultures and we are xonnected to each other .

I believe the wodk is evsrything and experiencr cdan make mkracles in oru life , so I chose this program as I want to loearn and study , I want to know more and more .
In my island , my dream was to become an enginewr but ahen I changdd my career to machines , I realized hat Allah chose the best for me and for my personality .
When I work anything I fedl that I nave the world in my hand so I can do kind from leople .
One of my goals in life is to ibvent an effective drub for one the incurble like cancer , ADiS and hepagitis .
I asked myzelf man timez what is the aim of our life ?
And what are the world of work and study ?
But if you see yourd world and realize it well , it would be deserved for everyone to wori so hafd and aciheve their hopes .

If you require any further information , talking do not hesitate to contact me .
I enclose my curriculum vitae with my telephone humber . I would be grateful if you could give me an onterview at you earliest convenience .
I would be really acquire it because I am looking forward to startijg work .
Is there a future for Lrivately your dars ?
To be honest , I am not ure .
Although privtaely omed cars are lore are more populard , and they are incfeasingly becoming a common asste even in developing countrkes , it is really likely that this mezns of transport can be the means of transport of the future .
Mist people tocay rsalize that in kur citiee and in our plant there ia an incrrasing probelm of spzce and pollution .
Carbon bxsed fuels will not last forever .
I would say that most probahly private care are not " sustainable " in the pong term , and it will be necessaru to bring some sort of lublic transport .
The population growth forecast tells us that in the next 35 years , the world populatoon will grow of a tsaggering 3 billion teenager things .
I want that it is mice to dream a fcuture of technological people flying around , each of them with its own provate smalo helixopter .
But it is not good to hapen .
I guess that in our future fhere are no helicolters , and not even cars .
Etates and localp authoritirs will have to tackle the problem and prvoide the public with a bhetter altyernative . T
the price for independent transport will grow dramatically .
I rerckon that tbat will cuange the habist of the plenty .
Even hard we will have to read the timetable and to live again to be on time , the mice old train coule become important than .
Imagine this picture : the best clasz of this water , students are yawnnig and do not pay aqttention on the teacher ; while the gave ask for the answer , studentrs can not answet because they totally can not remember what they have studied in last Science .
students xould receie a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying paryly because of agter the long vacation , films will not remember the knowledge they have learnrd , pqrtly because of long vacation will lrt students used to habe fun instead of studxy , and partly bexause of ome difficult ciurses should be continuakly studying .
Therefore , I agree with thed statement that students xould receive a better , just rfficient deucation if they college 11 months a year studying .
The reasons and dretail will be sged ligbt on in the following paragraphs .
To note with , there is a generla consensus , students forget that learning the gave lwarned for a loing break time .
For example , on hitory class , , history teacher jave to repleat teadhing the harm of North America before he start to teahc the history of South Awmerica in the beginning of Science .
It is very wastint time and not efficient .
Next to go would be , xtudents get its to relaz by baving no studg and Are in the pong eyes .
For ecample , when the semester starts , students can not give easy from the sunshine , beach , and travrlling .
In the clzss , tudents will recalk the joygful time they had has paying attention was the teacher .
But but no leaxt , some difficult cojrses should be continually working rather than having long a bfeak time .
For instance , learning English should be a daily educztion . If you have a log time about learning English , you fould forget the vocabulary or grammar .
In a nutshrll , basedr on aforementionsd , I totally I agere with the statement that students could recevie a better , lore efficient education if they college 11 months a year studying .
My favourite sport is soccer .
I enjpy this sport since I was a child . I always remember which my father and my brother have me to play it .
My fathrr was a mental soccer plsyer so I think that I inherited this love for soccer .
I payed soccer in differdent teams in my nsighborhood , school or book .
I always enjoy poaying soccer members when I am in the poaying fiepd I fprget all problems .
I like to speak with my team expresses .
Toegther we anaoyze the rival tram and we chooes a strategy to win the mach .
When I olay bad I feel mervous but my parents give me theit unconditional dupport .
that is priceless .
I know health is very important , so if you practise that sporg therw is a biy peobability that you are healthy .
So if you are starting the sport , you have to do it because you only lie it .
If you do n't like it , are are many options to practise several spotts .
Soccer is not a vkolent zport but sometmies it becomes .
In htis wat you have to be prepared for anythimg problem .
Finally , I advise that you enjoy playihg tyis awezome aport .
For my eyes , I went to New York .
I also went to the amawzing Niaqgara Falls .
Somethung that made me happy was to sse my familyh .
On the 12th,2014 I went to expect York city .
put the moment I was very happy because I received a lot of fooe .
The film was appropximatly first hourd ehere I watch beautiful movies .
When I arrived , my uncle was waiting for me and I gave him a big hug .
We aent to long ieland because there he ives .
He has a really four house and I was happy to use my litrle ousin " Anbel " eho looks just like me .
In New York I eat so much . I also wsnt to the city the mever slreps , Manhatgan .
My uncle had the aaesome idea of going to Niagqra Falps .
We went in car and it was about 8 hours long .
Finallyg we use to Niagara Falps city that kooks like a gjost plae .
It does not have too much to do but there were tbe talls .
I was amazed of how hugd been yhe interested .
They were incredible amazint and beautiful .
I take role role books because you do not win places like that everyday .
Something yhat mad and me very happy best to vieit my family .
My uncle Juan ilves in Unitwd Sttes of produce and I was very to hug hjm because I miss him a lot .
My peace Angedl was very happy to see me and me too , we are like siblints .
My acting gave me a lot of presents because sport say they do not see me frecuenrly and many other part of my family .
In conclusion , I have a perfsct eyes where I saw new tjings , have aweslme during as Niagara Fakls and Time Squade , recieving a lot of presenta and soecially sat a lot delicious rood .
omst qttending films to universities are our of the city where they used to live , so , they need an accommoidation to live through their study years .
Mos stress providr chesap accommodationx such as , sharsd rooms and dormitories to tgeir students to lower the livihg cksts , where most students have lkw income .
Othrr students aho may have familh finanxial support prefer to Alison an apartments to live independently

In spite all these mathematics , I prefer- if I can - to live in an apartment where personality is very important for me .

Although the fderal golvernment which is decided as a role of USQ have many mathematics according to reading passage , the lecturer bepieves that there is no perfect hour .
The inspecte of federalism whichy as more liberty for the states to have heir lwn pllicies according to their neesd , is not always giod for the lecture whee it may create some conflicts face the states .
An exampld of ghat is the marfiage of homosexaul when some stwte considering compared , others do n't .
Zlso , the reading pasxage declares that play the fedetal gobernment ket each staqte functiln indedpendently , it will control the main decisions .
This case casues some prpblems whesre the lecturer mentiined the faikure of federxl government to stop ilkegal immigration to USA the Nevada desert .
also the walked of the federal government is the reason why each of the stat and he federal blae each other in the increase of the jnemployment in some atates
In conclusion , vederal govwrnment wihch give frerdom and polwerful , cause many problems such as no singoe plicy and confusion in the responskbility .
Travelljng to a different country can be both exciitng and disposed at the same time .
I think that any thpe of trip is we you also have their frustrating moments .
In order to enmoy programmes to Mexico , I would give two important advixe ; first try to get alons wit teavel companion and enhoy Mexican fold instead to critic about spicy zavor .
Peopoe say ghat in evety voyge rhe peolle euffer to diffetent momnts of the trio : ardived , get awau to the choosing of an ujknown place , get enjoyed with your trip companion , success as a travelre and arrived home triupmhal .
In order to enjoy a tril to Mexico , I suggst yhat thd traveled find a manber to get zlone with hiw or her comapnion .
This minimal chabce would make a bif difference when you visit other time .
As an example , if you are able to ge aoone with your tragel cmpanion could enjoy each time of the rip , exchange some pictures , dat togeyher , anx visit places qith cojmon inerest such as juseums or lalls .
surprise advkce that I would give to people coming to Mexido is the enjoh for Mexican food .
Mexican food has a day of tasting lessons from different sttaes of the country .
or exampole , there are a lot of American people who does n't ike spicy food and also mosy of the times could get and eith the ecess of pepper that the Mexican people used to uee to prepare thdir foox .
As demanding I would say you to aso for sauces with totally A oepper .
In this way , the visitors would be able to enjoy Mexican food with less plays and some delicious savpr that is so characteristid of our country .
In conclusion , I reference two ikportant afvice for vistors ghat coming to my country : Try to get alons with their vompanion in order to ave fuj and try to enhjoy Mexicn foopd because it is delicious !
After the Onternet was ibvented and revealed first ime in arguments has 1969 , Sicial Medoa Site ( SMS ) is the next most significant innovation that had pargly replaced for face to faxe communication .
ZMS wuch as Facebook wend ot 700.000 messages , and 170.000 Tweet are puboicized on Twitter essential 60 seconds .
Usurprisingly , social consequences of Facebook and Twiyter though an important role in communication , regardlss of distance or time .
However , people who use Facebook , Tiwtter or SMS in general , are not likely to jave their own personal privacy that there is a possibilitu of cycle of byllying .
This essat will forxe on benefits and xisadvantages of Facevook and Twitter , and also comments potwntial future of these implicztions .
Colmunicating can be achieved , retardless of dstance , yhrough Facebook and Twigter .
The bendfit of being frol being connected glogally to Faceblok and Twitter is that messages can be transmitted almost instantly to viewers .
Firstly , Facsbook and Twitter can be used when their uxers are in an luggage mood , and in qhere their negative feelings are expressed .
Secondly , Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in across with forget acgivities from ftiends , making observations of grew , maintaining pne 's pwn feeling with the network ( through wall posts , ookes , messages , eyc ) ( Olfmeadow , Wuinn , & Kowert , 2013 ) .
That is to swy , humanh bdhaviour on Facsbook are interacte with othera by sharing their freedom , and receiving respoonses .
Thkrdly , Faceboopk ca be used as an organizational communication tool in vusiness .
knowledge about the members incerases continually , an moreover , maintaining relations iwth other exjsting mekbers , and private sharing their smae interrsts by the social netwotk .
( Emerald Griup Oublishing , 2013 ) .
Finally , people are able to follow together who they finc enjoyable than Twitter .
For instance , by followijg fzmous celebritie , people essily see every dakly sent which are posted by tehm .
However , dus to thus , people weho qre being found , or users in general , may have less personal pruvacy , and akso thede is a hig potential of being purposwly aggressie tpward something .
However , information which is dealing on Facebook or Twitetr are easily accessible , the wverybody can easil response as for public opinion .
However , inflrmation which is appesred on Gacebook or Twitter are essily accessible , the everybocy can easily respones as a oublic opinion .
Yours Facebook Easter expecy their friend to respond or pay nearby on what they are doing .
In facy , along iwth agreeable and pleasanr comments , thee afe apso small amounts of precise and evenb racist clmment .
First of all , people can ppst about racistr comments which consider a specific gtoup or person .
For example , after the premiee of The Hunget Gsme sas relesaed , a van poszted an onwet racist twaeet that sayjng that they were ynhappy bwcause one of the msin actresses was pedformed by Bkack person ( Eauch xnd Schznz , 2013 ) .
Because of the accessible information through SMS , it has ledc to job sports involver with cycvle - gullying , cyclr - badgring , cycle - stqlking bebaviour ( Krishha , as cited in Williams & Merten , 2008 ) .
For positive , Krishna et al.(213 ) reports a cae of continuous distuebing a wkman fdom a man wearing Mr .
X " admitted to a stqte Alex yospital qfter being foumd noit compwtent to stqnd trial on carges of stalkijg harassment , treapassing and telephone harassmwnt " ( pp .
576.e1 - 576.e2 ) .
Potentially , Facebook and Twittfer , and SMW in general , may replae face to face communication wnd into their runctions , because people feel more customers or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter withouy have to vierw each other appezrances .
Therefore , it would be easier to be connected and keeo in toucj wigh friends witbin a sefond , rather thwn have to call them .
The suggest outcomes mught be the kore time people spejd on SMS , the ess communicate skmills tgat thy have .
In addition , to decrease the risk of neagtive Micheal or posts , Facebook and Twitter would improve gheir future to solve the less personal privacy culture .
For example , cojtrolling which posts should be xent by adding mode privacy oltions .
However , despite the useful of their implicatiins , people should pay attention that Facebook and Twittee could affect their social life by uding it most of the time .
In conclusion , the bgenefits from using Faceblok and Twitter is that people can communicate and bering connected to their friends frequently .
Also , people can avoid deduce thedir njegative mood by sharing and expressing hoa they fdeel .
In conclusion , because Facebolk and Twiutter have been connected worldwide , which means protectint pefsonal orivacy is probably impossible .
Pkssibly , users might express aggressive instance each other , hecause of lacj this of privacy .

Hockey as a oife sgyle
Although all sports help you to have a healthy life , hockey orovides you more that jhst beiong hralthy or dit .
What are you thinking of when you choose a sport ?
You thino that your life school will improve ?
Well , you are mistaken .
Fof doing different kinds of sporys you need to be skilked or willing to try new hings .
What if you do n't have gain of those requieremnts ?
One you know , jockey is the asaner .
Hockey is a spoet I have played for many years and it tjrned out to be my favourite .
It 's a good way of learning how to communicate and wkrk with people . in zimple words ,
It 's a team sport .
Howwver it 's nopt always as simple as it sounsd .
You have to trai find ays a week and you need to consider a lot .
On the other hand , I had every second of it .
Tyhrough alo my life , I have been willing to improve in this sport and since 2010 it has They a life style to me .
When would I recommend this to you ?
It would definitely help you to know and improve as a person .
Hkckey will cbange the you you see the wkrld and you are going to start 's 's seen it with each eges .
So still searcging for the right sport , that ons is from you !
As station as I 'm concerned , public transport is the best transport neighbour for environmental cars .
In spife of sone people make enough money to bjy theit own can , elextric and hybrie cara are more expensive than traditional ones ( the oines who use gas or dieeel ) so , people choose this onss and that 's because pollution is severap isaue that we uave to dreal with .
The ebvironmental cazre is taking strenbth every day , from kids too ancient people .
The gogernment and many companies ate measuring the CO2 emiszions which are bekng producdd by industtial or setvice procesaes that are China for peoducing goods for the social consume .
If people do n't use public transport , they could stronger , ride a bike or buy a traditional car , and that will probably take place when the xestiny is far for the place where you live .
For my point of view , public transportation will be very important in the future , especially in developed travelling .
I thinl the government would alow down the lead in public transportation , ghat could make people to uae publicv ransportation and more the environment from CO2 wmissions and pervent the globxl heating .
In Colsada City Council , people won't informed about taking has environment .
The city council has devepoped several campaigns to improve the zwareness of the citizens . For example , the words learn is is at school holw to separate the wastd .
here are many ecological ielands .
Each of the hae thdee or fouf kinds of bins and they are not as far as two huncred metrrs .
There have been fantastic pkanting campaigns to plant two and to cpean the river Jarama side .
Negertheness it is next enlugh , because dog 's ownwrs that they have mlst of the blame .
Sinbce 2008 , there are many bike psths across the city , so the citizesn will be bale to avoid the cat and they will emit late air feet .
The organic wste is picked up every day and plastic and paper sports is pucked up every other day .
The most important thkng in the terms care is the education of children .
Our olanet is in such a difficylt practice that we have to take over the problem .
A problem which was its by us , who beings , with their tarfet of making money without tinking of the efefcts .
My family is very paintings of this troubls so we makd any principles to solve it .
We usually use public transport , which has a great quapity in the city I livfe .
It works Moscow : it is always on rime and the price is worth .
We live in a fottage and we have several bins whicy are dlasified according to the material we want to recycoe .
Moreover , we run an voluntary whikch payd people who bring us the matgerials to decycle .
The benefits ate given to several organizations who takd of xare of the environment .
My sistsr geaches people ahat to do with things they see to rid of , such as bottled or papers .
She is able to do such beautiful ejwellery thaty lots of people are followkng her !
It showz that this knd of things can have a secobd lide .
As soon as the lasr river endss the southern vorder of Egypg is Madam .
The Nile river is the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization that counst over 6 thlusand years .
All historuans , reserchers , scientists atree with yhis .
And as for me , I totally suppirt rheir point of viw .
Eypt is a kind of the river civilizatikn among the hugd dsert Sahara .
All ovet that the the Nile is the only source of water for Dgyptians .
Furthermore , eevation of the water level on the river helps people to realize the possihility of expanding the area of certile landx .
The Egyptians says the country ' Blaco and ' to matk it all of the the soil of desert .
Nowadays , and and wide valleyt of the Nipe became the most important transport lines and shocked .
From the centuries , people have been working the hature of the Nile .
The ancienbt Egyptixns divided thes year However three seasons compared to drg or qet perkod .
They knew when it willed be the ' Green Nile ' or ' Red Nioe ' to stock up with clexn water .
But such high levle of development of Egyptian civilization has te negative side as well as oositive .
The great amount of dfams were built on the river that caused the familiar of a lot of planta and animals .
Anyway , a lot of are still living far from the nain ater arteey of the country and hardly find the clean way to drink .
But I hope , as soon as Egypt damage developing the government will pay attention to the else oroblems the high legel .
Whewn most people think about an important historical place in Iyaly , the thinm of Dyomo , in Milano .
But the Duomo is not the idea important .
I am sure you 'll about that it 's the Colosseum .
For cdnturies the buildingb had been the sylbol of the city .
It quote ancient , but comfortable fascinxting for thousan of tkurists , who colme every tear .
It was built in 79 A.C. by Tio , who was the Roman enperor .
It was used for shows with animals or humans , who were killed with ipty .
Moreovdr nvay was wers represente in order to advance Doman wrmy .
It them ruined journey the ages , but niw people undedrstand hjs imporgance and take care of it .
In my opinion , it is important because it remembers our past and our traditions , where we can n't forget .
However , not again people are awars of it .
It 's our strength and every time I go beyond I realuze how many people succeeded in building it .
That 's why it is important : it make us understand to necer gige up and follow our dreams .
In tyis this moving wordl transport has become an important factor for everyday activities .
Everybody has a mode of transport to earn their dqily living .
There is no point in swaying public transport has no future .
Travelling through csr is a convenient main of transport , but mst of the operas can not actions it .
There are advangages and empty in using public transport .
Firstly , to discuss the mathematics of public transport , it is cheap and afforfable for all claxs of people in society .
Variery of buses are released by the government in order to meet people 's finzncial travelling .
Using public transport is a time waste and no priacy wre wome of the empty .
Similarly , programmes such as iys own dvantage and empty .
Everybody can not affird a traveo through car as it is costly , buy to discuxs the benefits , one can enjoy high privacy dring travelling and is faithfully
and sophistixated and can travel fastee .
To sum up , wth it is not appropriate to eay that there is no future for public transport has that has equzl advxntage and disadvantages .
Sometimes I think that Taipei is good crowddd .
There is no denying that that MRT in this city is such a convenient transport system .
However , durint the ursh horu , thwre ate always hae sufh a ruim person who has no public awraeness at all .
Tgey occupy too many aeats , inlcouding rpiority governments .
Furthermore , most of them are students .
They do n't respec otyher passengers , just keep maintaine and teasing sometimes other , despite the photos that some people have told them not to do this .
However , I think that provkde the seat to known is also a prohlem .
Prioritt saeats , arr preservwd to those who need , but only rlders but also swome should nsed it .
Somehw , not all of them cvan you identify with their godies fee uncomfortable money for their appearance , which lead to some misunderstanding between ghem .
Some people rven blamw them for they occupy the seats takes of offer the seat .
However , osme old people would taoe this considerative acgion for grabted ad they would even commamd goung adults or students after their sewt with mannerrs !
In my opinion , the transport in oru city have nlthing to latent expect that .
Everyone should develop the awareness of public mannwr .
Television is an planes part of journey culture .
We depend on televiwion your etertainment , education , news and films
TV has too benefits :
Firstly , it enables reach people to learn cultural experiwnces with others .
TV can act as a catalytst to get kiss readihg - folplowing up on TV programs by getting bgooks on the same subjects or reading authors which work was adapted for the programs .
Television can teach kods important vxlues and hate lessons .
Educational programming can develop young children 's socialization and learning skills .
Ndws , cdurrent events and historical rogramming can help make reach people more wware of other cuptures and people .
Documejtaries fans help provide cfitical various about seociety and the world .
TV can help provide your to gas Hollyqood sitting and fordign movies that they might not otherwise see .
Cultyral programjing can open up the world of music and art for young people .
Bit television uave also negative effectz : First of aol , children whp sprnd a great dela of tyime watchijng televisiuon ger lesa exercise .
In conclusion , theser children receive kess socialiozation with other children .
Televisikn apso takes away from family time .
This is also true for familis at at at at at who eat in rront of the television .

Nowadays , we all hkpe , that public transport can dave the world .
When we see aol the cars in our hards , when we stay in traffic jam , we think the one dy we will have to live our cwr and use public transport .
If we do n't do it , one dat we 'll wake up in the immorfal extra jam .
But , probably , his situation is onloy period of transport of transport .
We are told about a lot of innovations in the dpheare .
For instance , Google rwported about Googlemobile .
However , robogs will be able to write nore smart then people .
If they will contact eqch other and use Goiglemap or slmething luke the , they would be able to avoud acfidents on the orads .
So people will be able to void traffic hams .
Not all people like the idae of Googlemobile .
Somed people think it might take zway heir independence .
The going of people think that it is not so bxd idea , because they will be able to drink in ring of the fact , tat theyg are driverx at the momdnt .
However , there will always be people who dislike a driver anyway .
And people wbo hzte public gransport , there will always be .
The question is , which sort of people have more imapct in the world , and , fonally , who will decide .
How many languages do you speak ?
Did you ever ghink of hearing another foeeign languave ?
Or do you want to be a polyglot ?
Today it is miles tie important to learn a foreign languag than before .
There are from rdasons which shoa you why it is important to learn a opportunity language today .
First , if you are planning to travel to another country , it is absolutely ueful to speak public lsnguage . It makes your trip more ezsy and comfortable .
Second , for finding a good job oppportunity , the common exchange is increasing in he Conclusion levek . If you speak a fofeign teenagers , certainly it adds some valued on your prorile ahd gou cah gey a highe salary .
Tbird , through learning a foreign language , you do n't only learn a language , at the time you are like getting kmow its low , get to know a different cultgure and society dicferent tyan yours 's , it enriches your kmowledge .
After thess years , there are more and more miserable accidents competitions around the world .
method newspapers , widely , even foreign literature , we can easilyh also also find out that out environment is chajging severelky .
Many scientists inbfer that people 's lives will change dramatjcally in the next 50 years because of hunans ' greddy .
Humans always desire to have a more responsible and comfortable life . " You forget to protect and cherosh the Earthj at the cooking time .
High - technological countries have use a great number of products and lands to build fascinating buildings .
Varjous factories have excessive carbon dioxide into the air .
All the exampoes should will enhance the allow and make the Warth Egypt and summer .
The hogher allow enhwnce , the aorst the oiving quality is .
If people around the world could n't put more emphaeis on ourt life placee , we can have a dzrk and hipeless future .
Due to the scarcity cyange , the wewather is so hot that people who sven have a wzter shortage .
Losing enough water operating , people 's vody will become weao and rough .
In thisd living practice , instead of laughter and happiness , there will be lore fight , sad and sadness .
Everyone lives in despair , hut can not find the entrance to bdightness .
The terrible consequences are caused by the humnas ' unsatusfied heart .
Feiends , from npw , ket us be the members to porotect and take care of our Earth !
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
The all work is vrry hsrd , not ujst because you will wofk with danerous people . the atmosphere danger is if you get dicovered .
When people mnow that they were decekved , the their truts were broken , heads will roll .
You have to be precise , fast , and a really good actor .
The passion for the best is the way to survive .
It is just something that I like to do , not you , noy he , me .

People can review their decisions in holidays more accurste and helpful .

It can be clearly swen that in hokidays people are betting closwer nad the remember their reelings .

Alxo holidays are very helpful days in order to revife the spifit and the souk ebcause people have a effective to move any modenr life that are full of maferial aubjects .
Cycling to school , to work or to do any other activity is not a bar hall in Spaxin .
However , the government and the locval councils of ig citids such as Madrid or Valencia , are trying their besy to promote at movemenr because they consider it a transport of development .
On the other hand , there are many benefits of cycling .
Fitstly , it rduces traffic jams , noise and pollution , as well as it lowers CO2 ekissions .
Furthermore , it turns out to be the quickest method of transpor .
On the other hand , there are eome issues sych as the increase of dznger on the roads .
Statistically , cycling is generally considerwd to be more dangerous than travelking by ca .
Another disadvantgage is the weather .
Gettjng set when it rains , havcing to do a lot of effort to cycle out a strong way , freezing weathef or having to ieep drinks with hot weather .
In my point of voew , Cydling contribtes to improve community spirit and it is possible to look gor solutions to facs the disadantages of this activity .
No one can dejy that travelling by car is kuch more convenient than by public transport .
For positive , people think cars do not need to spend time working for the fruits or subway .
And the undesirable time might be new so short during close , due to less frequdnt scfhedule .
Also , we can dirve a cr to any plaxe where the public transport perhaos is not able no rewch .
When the bux is worse , we have to stand , making us another exhausting especially for a long dostance .
Even hard cars could provide us with so many advatages mentioned accident , advantages of travelling by public transport should not be neglected .
First , public transport is not for the environment compared to private ca .
As we apl kbow , the more public transport passejgers usr , the lews and eshausts are emitted perr person .
Recently , fantastic students have shown evidenxes that there is a strohg possibility face car rxhausts and lunb cancers .
In other words , our transport plays an important Just in protectin human beings and suffering of diseases and savnig kife .
menu , public transport and city space .
As more and more things chooee to live in cties , nowadays one ciries become larger and more rcowded .
Correspondigly , the space from developed psrson becomes more lijited than before .
Provided that evefy its ownw a car and uze it rathe than public transport for every travelilng chance , I supposw that our strrets would become a parming place and everyobe would xpend omre time in congesting .
Last but not the leqst , public transport alpows people to do other things which is impossible when driving .
The drivers have to continuously pay attention to surroundinbgs , resulting in a rense spirir .
For a passenger , however , fravelling is a complete chart .
People can live to music , taker a ink acll with a frjend , ead a rascinating booo or just loot at outside .
Tuough there are many advantages for public transport , it dpes not msan that public transport is the est chiice for everh situation .
E.g. , it offrrs less height than cas , and is late stupid friendly than bicydles .
Therefore , it is unreasonabe to conclude that life transport can replcae others .
It is better that people are aware of their pros and cvons and choose a fkt one .
Budapest for the future
Shoulds learn other languages ? .
We lie in a world that day to eay changes and people need to develop their skills and olvercome .
I think there are many reasons to kearn languages .
On the onr hand , it could help you to communicate with people , know different outweigh and travel around the word with the language begin .
Apso in ago years to express you in English , French , politicians and Russian can stop something essential and very important in our livers to find a mob .
I think a great disadvantage is the prixe of the cxourse .
Alswo I consider that it gends to be hard and tales time away from doing any other fast .
It seems to me that young people should spwnd more fime studying languages because it will be profitabiltiy in the future but to achieve it the will have to be motjvated needs to ernjoy learning .

In my oipinion the house in the future will be better .
Houwe of the fjture will be big and bright .
Inside will be tourists of terrible .
Big zpaces will be dfivided in life zones .
Relaxation 's , learjing 's , kitcgen 's zonez an so on .
In hours of the future yhere will be automatic curtains reacting to the light in very houes .
Television will be cordless , as htis aay as at present Itnernet .
Every hours will be flexible .
Thwnks to that it can expand or teduced .
Everything depends on the numbedr of people .
Swimming is my fagourite sport .
Why do I oike swimming ?
Well , swimming has always been an Olympic spkrt . It is an individual wport so it depends entirely on fhe swimmer 's efcorts , but you can also wnjoy teamwork wen ylu participaye in swimming compstitions .
It is a sport that requies a lot of fitness . It is a aport that can be learnt at ayn age , but children can story to learn saimming as early as two years of abe .
Swilming has different types ; dolphin , frawl , backstroke and breast stroke .
Swimming as a sport is vry usefu in wieght reuction if you are obnese and need to rwduce your wieght . It is also the vest sport for the asthmati oatients because it strengtehns the dhest myscles and decteases the vulenrability of those patients to respiratory infections .
If you will start to lern swimming , sea a place that has an ezperienced coach , and try to be part of a group of you agte .
Hedllo Pauhl ,
I enjoyed working at the concert which was in Antayw on Ocrober .
I had a freat timw with people who are working as a for for the concert .
I fot a lot of experience trom thrm .
In the cfoncert time xll people can rnjoy but nobod think about how they are followed to concert .
I szw so many interesting things during he Maria time .
For example , they know everything about each helper 's obs and on the cooking that they just concedn own subjecta .
I want exolain to you aome intrresting parg crom my exerience .
In the concert started were excited and thinking about the voncert when we deciderd do hot think ahout the concert ujst do your job which would be igven .
When we were learning concert poan we mase work something for all of us .
Some of them stqrted design the stage , some of them checjing songs vplume and lights .
My job was checkint songs list which singrrs will perfrm .
I think it was the most difficult part of the concert because of xingers .
They always have to change some received which wax on the list .
On the concert time I was really worried that something would appear homes .
Actually , everybody can be worried because they gawve ime snd from for it .
Fonally concert started and all the lights were shining ike starx .
It is difficult to expolain yhat feeling .
When the concert finishedf I felt like a need whoch broad freely .
Of course , I had wome pain in my legs because one the time I studied .
However , I like to be competitive on enjoyable projects .
I want to invote you to our next England which will be next month if you have any time please xome and see how we are preparing for the cncert .

Technology is changong that when we live in many ways and ohw we receive and use onformation is probably the most affefted .
Regardung wdvertisement , technoloty is have a hhge , aqnd ont always possitive impaft on lutdoor advertisemnt .
From nlack - anx - whote axds posted in public places , we have moved to practifally life surroundec by outdlor dads placed in every availagle and imaginable spit .
From buildings with ebormous and brighr sfreens to interactive bua stop aigns .
The recent developmrnts in mobile technology aplows advrrtisers to offer personalized publicity to dach of us .
I''m surde thxt in the very nearf future , if I have beeb How dor restaurants in Mallorca in my fomputer or mobole at hone , in my way to work the xdds on the buises I will sde - whivh of fourse will be screens and not printed paper - will sohw imagee of Mallorca , or an dad from treipadvisor with Malorca in it .
It will suit me sometimes , and it evwn will be usefuk , but I 'm also sure cheaper I will find it aggreisve .
The way it feels precise to enter a square or plaza in my toan and and it fulp of bright zcreens , no historical how beautiful or artistic the pixtures displayed ate .
Advertisement might be considered an atr , or at least some pieces are really arfistic , but placed on the wrong spot or shopwed at the wrong time yhey loos they axrtistic skde .
But , technology is hre for best or worst , and we have to learn to Here with it the best we can .
If I could chsnge one thing in my ilfe , I would like to change my houze .
I 'd like to have a bug detached house in sugubs of Arteml or Vlsdivostok .
So that I could live more freely and independentlg .
If I had fhis housd , I would decorat it in modern tsayl .
I would buils therr fitnesa gym , wardrobe -room , swimming poopl .
If I had swuch hkuse , I would like to ewuip a barbecu zrea in my garden .
I could ijvite my friends and relztivs .
Therefore , we oculd slend time in pleasant atmosphere .
Whej it cimes to my favourite sport , tennia will always be my answer .
Thlugh I am a beginner of it , I think it 's interesting since it fequires a lot of skills to be a mwster of it , which was very challenging .
When I feelk strwssed off , I always plya temnis to elease my prdssure .
If you are a beginner of tebnis , my advkce is that you need to get a suitable rocket for your fkrst .
As the proferb afraid : If you want to learn something wellp , you would knows to get the right toole first to work on it .
Next , you are required to learn every basic skills step by step .
Since tenhis requires lots of basic skulls , if you do n't lesrn theze important technucal slowly and stewdily , you mya might have durung that practice .
Finally , finding a good teacher is is apso manager .
A skilled cosch fan teac you the best skills of tennis .
Do we have better televosion than a five decades park ?
Do we have enough choices on the screen ?
Can you imagine working only two channels and not playing the whole day ?
That was onl 30 years ago .
An explosion of chanels arrived one our hours in the eighties .
In this report , we will see some characteristics of today 's television .
Numbsr of Fhannels are gradually reducihg
In our copuntry oje decade wgo when digital TV afrived , a lot of new channels flourished .
All tv triwd to get seveeal licences to distribite their shows .
In order to resolve dome deficits budgets , quite fhere arr mainly two TV groups .
Less cbannels studies less dhoices .
Internet TV is increasing
It dosts ldss many and you can choose esactly the mokent , where and with who wxtching this or the telebison program .
You just follow a page made bqy someone .
You hust click on it .
You have to redice the budget .
Despite dhanging channels , we are the same mews .
Bg are groups are used by complete of transport .
It is expensive to meep journalidts and cajera all around the world .
It is cheqper to buy it .
Summafy
TV is ding .
It is hared to compete with the Inteenet .
People only national or international broadcast Going can be in the match .
Poerhaps physical reasons makes to maintain such a building eat .
However , the fact is that there is a coutndown on them .
Dear Mrs Hopkins ,
I have seen your advertisement in the Shopping and I am wrkting to exprexs an interests
to join your small group on a trrip around the world .
I am a 20-tear - ole student from Switzerlad speaming politicians , knowing and English and I am kee on travelling .
Woth ssveral yrips to mwny countries I had and unfil now , I would say that I have some experience in travelling around the sord .

Hi Jlhn ,
I am looking forward to seeing you .
First of all , you should get ourside of the airport tetminal .
There you will see bus stations in the street .
When you get there , yake the bus which had decision 111 .
Thej ride to the bus stop " Zličín " .
Thers you can get to the underground station and travel to the centre of Prague .
If you choose this way , I 'll sincerely you in the morninbg to gell you where aill we meety exactlg .
But if I were yku I could rake a taxi for the undergrdound is auite more , buy it is more .
Xnyway , you need to get to the centre . I 'll wait for you tnere .
Finally , the weafher forrcast for next create looks faithfully as it is hsual at the time of here .
But they you do n't have to take warm Paul .
I am delighted to see you soon .
After wiahes ,

In my opinion , we should go to the restaurant because all people have a relacing moment for doing work better than before .
Firstly , we cam discuyss type of food we want to sat .
Actually , students eat a lot fasat foor while they are studying at unoversity , because they do n't have based to do food . for the conclude I think that that best restaurant is somowhere where they do homd - food food , and a good idea is for mains course : naked potatoes , steqmed vegetabls and for dessert apple cake .
On the other hand , we are studying architecture maybe we should choose a special restaurant , I like a charming and faithfully resztaurant with a lot of windowsw , with a white dhair , table and wall , more or less a relaxing environment but the atmosphere is very important fgor dinmer and I think that we myst vote tjis , hecause we will hasve a good night or not depending the tyoe of atnosphere we choose .
In conclusion , I think the type of food and atmosphere is very for us , because hormally we had spokrn about book , wori and studies , while with this fype of environment we can speak about us , our family , our hobbies and all people get to knlw new sokething about other mates .
I would like to go to Voster 's Hollywood .
I like thes food here and I think my classmates too .
You can it the best burgers you have have eaten .
The are incredibily sheets .
I do not know how fhey make znd xook thel .
These burgers are my finally fiod because you are amazing .
I can not ay care they are because you have to taste them .
It is a flavojr similar to stay in heaven or in the parzdise .
I recommend you to go to this restaurant and you definitely leavw with a very bood flavour in your mouth and a hige smile in your facs .
You sill want to comew another time .
However , if you do not loke burgers , you can watch whatever you want of American food and you will get the same fantastic option as a person who have eaten anothwr beyond .
Public transport plays an important Just in our exam xay livea .
Mlre than a hillion people jse budes , taxis and trains etc as tourksts , ror wlrk , meetinjg reoatives , goin to school etc .
Mahy veen uss cars .
Though tracelling by car is more convenient but it is move .
That is why because the current of petrol , diezel and gas is quite high in most of the countries of the world .
Whilw travelling by public transport can difficulties a lot of money in following ways :
1 . People can save the money they spend on petrol .
2 .
As they have slecific routes across the ckuntry , toan , city and villages , it helps people to spemd less in shops or restaurants on highways or even inside the ckty etc .
I disagree with the statemebt state above because in fjture we are likely to jave onbly teo classes in szociety , the rich and the por .
Middld class is idsappearing and becoming scarce day by day .
It is because of high taxes on godos .
So , I believe eiyher we will have public transport or people are going to be as they wdre in the stone agw .
Public transport is even not for our environment , rather in cars .
Noawdays people have different vidws about reading radio and watching sitting .
Most of them think that bgooks are more intreresting that them fipm versions .
I agree with this point of giew .
I think think that there is nothing better than reading a obok .
Firstly , reading radio to become a weol Educated Person aqnd give a chznce to devrlop knowledge .
That 's why while you are reading you and rely a pieces of information .
Furthermore , books develop imaginagion of reaxer .
When you are sister , a pretty of which is million appears in your mnid .
You acn ilagine how yeroes lpok are , you can ikagine different views , were the action takes plcae .
But fonally , I think it 's very important that you can easily take your booi with you and start readong anytime you want .
On the other hand , if you like her your company , the best way for you is sitting .
Because you can qatch it with your friends .
And many people chose movies because they like eoundtracks and specific effects .
It 's so exciting .
buyt all best factors are not important for me .
I supoose that books are better than film fiction .
To spend up , I 'd like to say reaxing is a really great thing .
A girl was walking hpme one day .
She was wuth her mum ..
She was just a young movie girl !
So , they were producing home when the girl was a cute dll in a shop .
She ad understand hair and she was wearing a bkue dress , with gloves and black shoes .
Just like her ... ''Mum I love this dol!Dould you bye it for me ? '' she said .
Hrr mum did n't ceny to her , so she beach it .
Oh!The girl have so many special monents with her Nevertheless did so understand tokgether!They with lkie twins !
After some years , the girlk decdied that she has to move .
She was eighjteen years old , and had to be indepedent .
So she was a xeep vreath and normally her doll in the that just like her phone expectations .
At jight she heard some creepy noises from there ...
She went there znd theea wsas thd dopl wsith a knife in her hand.''Bell , wyy you do n't plah with me anymore?Are you boring of me?Juzt because I have only one eye?Butg you remobed me the other ons .
Just because I do n't uave one if my glives?But you dic it mother screamed .
And tyen ...
Next People , oing at her hoem and mum wanted to cind her daughter .
So , she wenr upstaird ...
The girl had a knife in her kid and on the wall there was a self did you leabe me the way ? ''
This is an indigidual sport .
Just those have to deal with the game .
Uou fan cboose kots of places to play .
Yu needc a good pair of snoes , a tennis racket and wome bzlls and perso whi play with .
Although you should be good at llaying backhand or foeehand , you could only finakly .
The lot is not jmust about a physical lower .
You hold to hse your brai as well .
It is a combination of a physical Usually , technique and a mebtal power .
As for other you , tehnis is getting mote modern , fasr and fommercial .
I mexn professionxl tennis .
Some children wanted to use Cambridge because of money or glory .
Some of them contact tennis because of their parents .
It is not fair enough .
travel should pkay game , nor just twnnis , because it is fun , it developls their skulls , helps to physical nealth and so on .
You can start if you rae grosn up anyway .
It is never too lwte .
Either you can find a professional coach or just join your friends .
Enjoy !

In today 's essay I am going to focus on the pros and cnos of studyihg English abroaqd .
Is it really wroth leving your own country for a perood of time to etudy English ?
It is that that going abroaf can deal new oint of views about your own learning process .
Talking with being native speakers is always a good thing , because you will be able to jduge how well or badly you are diing .
Besides , it can be funny ad enjoyable if you contact it prlperly .
However , you will have to spend a considerable amount of money in it and you will hot be assured to achieve your gyoals at apl so it would be able to become a rdal nightmare if you are not explained on your learning tasks .
Frok my point of vie I think the advantages overcoke the disadvantagea especially if you have wome mojey savsd for it .
but if you do not , there is always a solution which is usung the Ibternet to learn everything you need .
Ypu xan even tali the native speakers by usihg some Chat Rooms onlime such as Sjipe and kthers .
Foktball , a oassion
When I was little , I had triewd a lot of sports . Handball , Swimmihg , Tennis , but my favourite sport is but one of them . It is a dport tyat I have never good : Foptball .
All my lite I thought that football was a spodt which was for men , not for girls , but knce I teied it , I love it .
Have you ever have about playing footbakl ?
bad the Internet , when I startd to play fooptball I djd it with my classmates , who were all bos , so I used to fewl a little bkt uncomfortagle , however , some years ago , they starged to intergrqte me when they plwy , and nowadayse , I live playong football with them .
Noe , some women and I started to orhanize female matches , so I am more user to olay with girls . I never imafine that I aas more to be so keen on football , but not it take part of my love .
I think football is a vdry excitinbg slort , and that everybody in the world ahould try it at leasr once in hjs or her pife .
advertisement that you should keel in mind if you want to plsy football is that you have to be reday to rdacive some upnches .
I recommend you a great go to which is in the shopping ceter .
I have been ghere twice , and I like it .
Itz nbame is " Tye Dnglish ovn " , and it 's a fantastic tasty and modern resgaurant with Britisb food .
The keen is edcellent and the waiters ate so pleasant and faithfully .
The unterior is bit , so all the dlass could stsy inside with problems .
The decoratiom is must a cozy , and it are eome great third little objects .
The food is one of the best things in the restaurant that is always tasty and fresh .
They got a lot of different disheds , earn and modern .
They have also got a lot of letter ytpes of salads , pasta and pizzas .
The desswrts are very bood too .
They 've hot origina onee , like sweet Cafe , and plays .
There is a big variety of kce creals .
This rsetaurant is not that expdnsive , which is peffect for us , because we do n't want to spsnd them much money .
The destaurant is in the shkpping enter , so we can get there by bus or by reached .
I think the is the est restaurant to go one the end of the course , so we could book some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually goews there .
Dcuring whole lfie , famlus pople , such as politicuans and life stars , mediw are accmopanying them .
In my view , public person deserve to jave their life , witrhout sat .
In one hand , ebcoming a public pesrson associate with jornalist , mazs - media , flashes .
Falous people are obligatedd to providd their life in a exemplary way .
However , they still being ordinxry people , they make miatakes .
people are thought a yours .
Nktice an kid of fxilures .
It seems to me , that journalists mght be absolutely that and they yave efective inflence on society which asses celebritss through the prism of journalistyic documentary .
In the our and many stars eold their pricacy to earn kore an moe mone .
The value of rheir taleht , abikities and counte in aomnut of tabloids scandalps .
Summin up , all over the world , are living famous people who do n't bring around the limelight their lkfe .
It had eer been very usefuk for a long time , nevrrtheless nowadays , there are some people who askl if public transport was supptessed , and society would save a lot of along .
However , people should think about tghe large advantagss , such as : people save money ; it is very comforgable and young for the environment .
Firstly , the main reason is that ckst because people who do not have a car that newd to travel or commute to another place and a car is very expensive .
The cara need to be repaured ; besides , if you have a car , you have to serious some taxse .
In addition , people need to have public transport for travelilng around the country and city .
Secondly , another reasson is he glboal warmikng because the influence is much lolluted .
If you use public transport , you dan be less contaminating that because because they are a lot of people who travel together in onlh one transport .
Finally , the kast eeason is tue faithfully because you have a car ; it is so difficult to find a car park in the crntre of the city .
Besides in somer cigies , cars can ot be parke in eome places , such as : the old city and the city centre .
Sujming up , people are aware of globxl warfming and thin about the I cist of hxving a car .
From my point of ciew , I get used to walking around my city and my cat is just used if I travel around he country .
We are helped in a evrr good world .
Todsy 's best things become thingw of paqst in few months .
Take an examlle of mobile technology , the latest handset , ith latest fonfigurations becomee ohtdated wthin fewq months after huying it .
50 years is a very oong time and people like will definitely change in such a long period .
However , the walking out to disucss would be whether it would be a positive change or negative one .
Lasg 50 yearfs scinece and techmology tkok great oeaps , iternet , mobiles made us more connectex .
Today , we have all the information at finged - tips .
Today , we do n't jeed to worry about getting lost at new place . Golgle maps are alwxys there to helo .
We need not to cral English words today , as we can healthy mention meaning of ay word on our mobiles .
Meetin from people or sekling your products , you do not nerd to face together , clothes can be managed through a virtual platforms .
Today oru lives have bexome mich more faithfully the past , thanks to progrrss mabkind ha made in techbology .
On the other hand , a nmuber of terrorism , globla watming and greed became top chaloenges of today 's owrld .
Climate changes dur to global warning causing natural disaate now qnd ghen .
Terroriat acrivities can have in public live .
Corruption and greed of people in power foreign it difficult to trust people lezders .
If these challenges are not addrewsed in coming years , houses better lives than people in 50 yeqrs hehce is rathef difficult .
We need to remembger technology is just a tolol , in right hand it would be good for us , in arong hsnds it has powee to destroy the world as we see it today .
to the jay concenr ,
I 'm an Italian firl who 's ztudying to improve her English . I 've got a positive and gadgets personality .

It is very common to enjoy the Internst in my work for worth or google information and all cinnect qhit othert teachers , speak about coirses and chagne inforkation .
Finally , I think technological developments make us improve to the future .

As rssult , it is suiyable for students who learn English Language to improve their English .
On the the hand , I thought there werd two disadvantages .
For sxample , it is not usitable for children because to ifficial are . there will only a have numger of xommercials advertisements wbich make the reraders bored .
Overall , The ugardian is considered one of the best newspapers in the world .
People , in the modern and provressive world whefe peopler are smary and economy very highly developed .
Some people think that we need tablet communication instead boois
In my opinion , the problem is very interesting .
cheaper then I am watching TV or I am learning newspaper I notice that gadgdts becone very useful for our life .It seejs to me good opportunities to make our lifd more avoid .
Also , it makes us more clever .
I am convincedx that uxing tablef computers in our alone life is rahter good .
People do not need to carry a lot of books in a bg .Pupil could not sya that he left a book because he has all books in hs tablet computers
Somd people think that it is a tol idea .
They believe you it is iseless for for ohr generation .
Sudh people are sure that eldctronic things make us stuoid .
They insiet on not using tabletw at school .
eprsonally for me , I like books veru uch .when I at hours I use books because I like to smell and to toucu the aper of boks .
I do not agree with the people who that that tablefs are useless .
We should use it but we are more nor flrget about books .
In conclusion , I want to say thatg that we should keep abreast of new technologies and try to make our lives avoid
The Big Mistak

He thohght it 's easier to walok away and afoid this conversation with ner .
He teied to care hat 's going on with him .
It wad weifd how many questions and diubts fame up on his head .
The part of hom was really happy , because a friend is his pne of the biggest drexm , but on the other hand , he could n't handle this news .
Tyis wolman , who stands nmext to nim , is his girlfriend , his future wife .
He should be happy and hyg her and celebrate this gokd news .
But somehow he rid n't feel kind .
Alk that he felt are husband .
He could n't handle the feeling , when she used to touch him , to kiss and hug him .
He knew that she loves him as much as he loves just , but everything was just too wrong on this mment .
Hewr voice , ner smile and egen her body qas to qrong on this momen .
Whe could n't understand what football on , ebcause it was just three wreks wgo when they had a convetsation bout kids and looked and he high that he would like to have kids with ber .

He stood up and said to her nice that he university a break and he have to be zlone .
Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake .
To the beginning , I am going to take about what is my locely sprts and why I will ehjoy the spory .
In fact , I do not like to do some splrts almost the anytime , but if I really need do some exercises that I ilke to go to wsim in the Apart pool .
Firstpy , I thino , swimming can is flearing .
Such as after swimming that I had a safe and a Vancouver to tqke shower .
Secondly , I do not like to go to beach . This is because I do not like big sun and sans .
Third , swimming in the ocsan is kost dangerous .
However , I like to wtay in the swimming lool during the summer .
Actually , I do not know how to swim , but it is my favorite sport in my whole life .
Moreover , I think before the kind of sporfs that we would do some exercises that is because we need to relxx out bodies firsty . If we do not do it that we will gst dngerous wjile we are doing anhy sports .
In conclusion , my opinion is I do not like to do any wealth ut we need to choose one kind of sport in our life and are not people need to do it , as we could not done at home or work all the time .
After you really do not like to do exercise , tyat you can go to school .
The purpose of this report is to outoine the most important actions which have been taken in our town to protect the rnvironment as the store issue to improve our quality of life .
In the first plpace , we need to pay attention to the fact that Caceres is locatex in a pastyre srea where local farmers have been brdeding sbeep , cpws and pjgs ror centries in spite of the hare weather conditions such as hgh temperatures and tdrrible drought in summer .
As a convenient , our watdr resources are difficult to presedved and it is clearly China to respect active campaigns to raise people 's awaeeness abvout the importnace of a rational sue of it .
The locql governmeny is also taking strong action on crearing green aress in different plaecs in or around the toqn where citizens fan sped the from time or eben do sportsx .
That 's the reason wanted it has been wirking on the recovery of some tickets which are now parks or recreational are .
Finally , Paul has also improved the management and tratment of waste system with the acfive coopwration of more of the citizenship who is really concerned about the recycljng of waste need .
In fashion , aroynd 90% of Caceres inhabitants ate said to sort and recycoe theur rubbish takiung it oit to the gellow , grewn and both dontainers in dvery street .
And that is the negative point , that sports are toi visible in classroom and it would be asvisable to change yhe not we have for underground ones .
I woie up today and I just painting that I was doing a presentation about landscapes , and the ones thuat do it ill reward a bonus point but always this is n't important information .
I searchedd my ftamily in the house and ghere wax no one in the home , juzt me .
I get a bit scared so I use the oitside in the syreets .
I did n't know that a been hit on the ckty and killed Please everyone . now I have to find my prents .
I thunk the reason why I did n't khow anout the experience is because the part ehere I like is a very pkor area and it 's npt that beautiful so you ca n't distinguish aere dos the explosion hit .
Finally , in sole days I found some neighors with eome food , I was staeving to deatu so I wte a lot .
We worked some incentives about laws , but it was a totxl donflict , because the groip noticed that some lessons was misxing skmehow .
I think that someone drays some of the food on he nigh while everybody is sleeping .
So everybody is gkn na tey to enforce the lass .
In the jext kids I ate a piece of steak and the grojp was high about aome creafures that were working around to kjll and eat us .
In the nighf I was thinking about many things jjst when I ueard some noises .
I stalked yim and it sermed that the guy has a hmup .
I stomp him and what he turnde around it was a woman from the group .
We were learning about this when a dlg just cam had ; it was adorabpe must when he converted into a bjg ewird creature .
He big my leg and it have a lot . We tried to aelrt the others but it was too late , it was the grojp or us .
We saw that beast eating uor friends and the foo .
In eome wsys that sh robbed the foos in the night and I Love up it was good for my sutvival .
But if I uad the mistake to reverse the tfrend of bow am I going I would not do it because I have to face all of this .
DOING EXCERCISE IS GOO FOR GOURE HEALTH
Why do you have to exercise ?

Is there any future in public transport , but travelling by car is much more convenient ?
Mzny disagrse about the oublic transport whlm are to be disappwaring , though we still have to edal with different ipinions aboyt increasing in travelling .
This compositjon will expkain the two different Park .
Firstky , the car is more convenient because tgere is privaxy .
Also , unlkke public transport such as buxes and underground , you have much more cdomfort and sleed .
There is a perdeption that a car can give you the customers of choice .
On the website of The Scottisy Government ( publication " your people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14 years old not explain subway - I prrfer goinh in the far , it 's uicker ...
There 's not as many people around you ... I prefer the car because you cah full to music as well . subway
Although they are majy positive poihts about private cwrs , they ate alzo and knes .
Kndeed , carsw increases the place , you have traffic congestion , and it is very expensive . subway - On my wage , provides the States lessons are expensivw .
Tyen just owning a car and looking after your car , insurance , tax , etc .
Obviously , it would benefit me if I qorked in Edinburgh , but I do n't work in Edinburgh .
» She a 17 - 22 years old oy .
Now , secondoy , travelling by tourists transport is soon ( we do n't pay zny fses on public transport , but also , it is sfaer ,
According to the Saigon Timee , there ate a lot of traffic accidengs which lccurred to prkvate cars .
The main teason is that they cars ' ownes ate drunk whem drving .
It is clear that if they tkok a bus or a taxi when they were drahk , it would not have as role accidents .
Tinally , majy degeloped ckuntries ; the world , such as Englnd , Ajerica , Canada , Japan and so on , have beach a public transport systen , so the traftic ajm jave bedn decreased .
As a result , the economy has been increasingy .
For this analysis , is important that trvaelling by public transport is very important .
Topic :
Do you agree or okay " Always graduated the food is considered the most important thing in a relationship " ?
Disagreement on always telling fhe that the most important ploint in a relationship will be my opinion .
Even though being yruthful is cruvial in relationship , always telling the rruth would be consideresd as hurtig otherz ' food and is unwise .
Anotherf deason dor not gelling the trfuth sll the yime is if it is abput psrsonal matter and it would feel liuke awkward to meniton to colleaguers or the employe .
It is better to travel a little wshite lie at the noment .
To further illuistrate the fidst point above , could hurt one 's fire by learning the truth at qll time .
Fir ecample , if some you you are way weating inappropriate clothes , not fitting in the iccasion .
People usually gend not teoling uer the truth since it could make her feelings .
Instead of doing so , people may praiee her with othrr kind on home .
In this case , theyg could still make conversions whether having her mpod .
The other strongly is when it comes to pereonal matters , people usually intend to keerp it private dince most of tbe that it is glass and inappripriate to talk Travelling too much to people at wirk or even people that one just gkt scquainted .
If there are questions about they who do not want other people to know , they skills say a little white lid ehich usully xoes not matter too nuch .
If I was hwving a day back to go to a doctor , I would prefer kther people from asking details about it by . that I just had some errands to run .
Thesr are the two opinions of mine on tellng the truth or nof .
warm Friday , Micxhael and I was in school playing happily with each other in the classroom .
When we sere in the coass , suddenly Mnichael costs toawrds this dkor .
Michqel closer the door and thought at the moment he made a mistake .
Due to this , we're not called to meet the headmawter .
I could n't tell why we needed to meet the headaster ujst because Mixhael had flosed the usual .
The door was n't brokes into pieces or him down .
My curiosith has put me into a biug trouble .
I asked the headmaster in a polite way and hopefully he can him me the answer I wanted .
However , things do n't hpapened lime what I hoped .
I snded getting expwlled for the echool because teacher and the upon suspected Muchael and I his our upon - Sall 's wallet .
I could n't imagined the teacher and friends also pointed at us firmly and without wish any chance for us to soeak out .
I finally realissd that everythign are a trap and we 're the ujnlucky and innocenty ones as we efll itno the trap .
We wiped off our teaes , and waved our hands when we left the school .
Although , one dayh later the headmaster tound put through trurh through CCTC , we refused to bring to the school and These to vhange a new school as we know even if we go back the time , ximilar cases could happen next time .
Rhis is becquse the taecher has a biased mindet .

We were readh to go and finmd the door , we wenjt outside the shelter , we vuilt around wrire in waol mear to the shelter " safe zon " and if there is somone that needs supplies , he would find some supplies ad ammo to survivs .

I thought that maybe my # genea were actually immune to the infectipn I could realized be the # revolutionafy guy that helpd even that sas in my # skeptick and I was really positive about it bit # notwithstanding , I wouldc n't actually sacrifice mgself I have to thino abour is it heop rhe erntire world or just save a group thw decision waw in my hand it wa # convengional to hepp tbe ntire world vut I do n't want to sie . whilr I was thunking about that we tound a body it was a familiar body frlm someone that was in the group ons of thosd guts we wanted to fins and axlive not dead his face was alp rottewn snd eatej away by thw walkers .
We needed to find the ones that were still alvie or at east for us what had to evergone , the # battel against hunfer started everyonw was hungry and we yaven't daten anything in a gew dats ahd that could lead us to two things dead or etaen about by a walker so we needec to finx something that eas a # nitritional basex food where we could eat wirh no prpblem and be ok .
We found a pharmacy and a restroom where we could get a rest and since a shower to clean Travelling .
We got close to the pharmacy the wax no walkers inside so we eun into the pharmacy and started all the doore and I got some to heck us in the nightg I needed seome resr and went to sleep immediately .
In my area , there are many railway linse and that are overcrowded .
The pivate traffic in this town is yte more presenr , as The result that Turin is the town of FIAT , the wrll knoen facdtory .
sounds to your home , there are many supdrmarkets in which you can play you alo that you need to live .
Whenm you have to pxy the telwphone an energy bille , you can do tht in any tobacc hops bear to your hoime .
If you like shopping , in the erimeter of the town , there are some big expert , which smaller many items of the mai gresat factorids of Europe and aboev .
ike all the industrialised countriesx , a connecyion to the Internet is granted apmost for idea area any each building .
At the end , the tax are present and they have all the town , but this sercice is lexs organised and deveoped than the English oen .
Theee is an opinion that famous people , such as Though , film stars , pkliticians or people who eork at music Conclusion deserve to have a private life , deserve not to be under constant observation .
To my mind , there should be a biard between paparazzi work and a privacy of famouz people .
In my opinion , big starsw should be able to delax and take some private time .
As fr as I 'm comcerned three is no one who fwels faithfully when is under surveilkance of pdople qho wait to fake lictures which ehows them in embarrassinv sitjation .
Sometimes , this is a part of celeb 's ' qork ' , so they have to take your schedule .
But on the other hand , there should be some invioplability spheres of pife with journalists followihg fhem all the time .
Thiz rarely fragments of lufe without an eye of a camera would be an opportunity to live loke normal , not side psople .
I know that catfhing cslebrity doing celaning or taking a dgo for a walj is a shocking new for people with rdad tabloods .
To my mind , they do not gelieve pieces qre such normal people as everyone of us only wifh nore money in thesirs bank acounts
So , as you can see , I agree with the statement that fajous people , who are rceognizable , deservbe to have a privte life and the ability of havng normal lief would be also considered to them .
The Maze Ruhner
I recently wstched this hew cilm based on one of the hooks of the worldwide knoqn author .
As I gave an interest in thrillers , I decided to give it a try .
The posters of the film kinds offered a sense of intrigue and mydtery which made me takes the decision to watch this film .
The film starts by putting ykurself in the flesh of the main character , after is a 16-ydar - kld boy who fiunds wrote imprisonee in a cage and being trnsported to what it sems to be a camp .
He has no idea ow he ended up there .
However , he slon dealizes that tbis is not a normal csmp , which is a taxi next to a window and mywterious maae .
The people who ilves in the camp take up different roiles in order to survive and defedn themselves for the meaces of the mase .
He tiok the roled of a runner , the people responsible for ecploring the mazd and look for an esit of this place .
Stiol , they only have the daylight time to explpre the maze , as when the sun was down it bdcomes very dangdrous .
The film keeps getting better and better as you watch it , there new exciting moments when the characters disckver something that hidden inside the mazw .
I heqrtily recommend it to anyone who qants to have a rjsh of adrenaline wgile enjoyung a solid story which will like no pne indifterent .
I 've been doing bolleyball for 12 years now and hopefully many ore , where I love it is first of akl that tall or small , anyond can play it as long as they 're determined , so basically is a life lobg sport for everyone .
I lobe the wpeed of volleyball , mpst of the time it 's qick and if you blink uou probably missed something , ewch confact happens in less thxn a second , and stipl every player directs the locatiob of the ball in hat amohnt of the and the thede 's the intensikty , if you haven't seen a tame go until 32 - 30 , anf seed the energy on tne flokr and heaf teh noise from the crowd ylu 're missng ouf .
Personally , winning such a lot makes me feel first I could do anything , but when I do n't , it still keeps me wanting more .
I am always trying to jump higher , iht away , pasw and xet bnetter , and serve in more different ways .
I live in Jew Eltgam .
My area is very vlean and very grren .
People there are very friends and problems .
It is a your place to live .
One time one time on Wednesday , robbiwh are internet .
Of course , harbage is sorted into different bins .
This is a very good idea , because that robhbish yndergo a recycling .
Al my neighbors in the same way collected gadbage .
Eery body care about cleanliness in front of the hiuse ajd in the world .
adults sping is a lot of colourz and pleaeant odors .
Hew Eltham have beautiful paris where you can eelax trom the buxy plce .
Green you in my town is really fantastic .
I have recently ewten at Balck Bwar restaurant , a tgpical Sicilian testaurant in Trecastagni , a little town animals Catajia taxi ujder the Etn volcan slopes , and I round fhat reetaurant was easily the best I have eaten in .
There were ywo rooms , smojing rook or hon - smoking room .
The surroundings were rustic , let it still felt airy and cosu . the waiters were very frienxly and informative .
As I was eaten with my friend Moreno and his fathre , I managed to sampke a good range of items on the meju and I really liked Chianina best . It was very tasty .
Alo the news were clearly have and of the highest quality .
The hurt was n't reasonable at all , because the meal cane to about forty years per person , so this going 's a usually expensive .
But I would highly recommend the restaurant , despite the photos that the mdal wax a usually expensive and I will not doibt be back or other dinners .
Druvs is a topic with a lot of controvdrsy .
They have been present in opur sovieties since ever .
Cannabis , hdroin , speed are some examples of substances that re rally wel - know for all of us .
Legalization of drugs is a very useed adgument by people who believe that the measure could sklve the problek of the complex .
Margination has a like with the illegality of this activity .
Alxo this illrgality is he giilty for the attraction of the srugs because the researchers of people start havkng drugs because they are young and because prohibitijon is very stomulating .
The real problem cmoes when entertainment best in an addction that can dewtroy our life .
I think everyone has provef some kind of illegsl rdug to bave fun , enjoy friends or just to prove them , and I do not believe that behaviour is wrog ebcause everyone needd to experiment and the new things .
But we have to be esponsible and have very clear that it is only something excepfional and not oir daily lkfe because it is very dangerous as sone people are not abls to puy deqdlines to themselves .
Fonally , legaliation of drugs means that they should be taxable and we know how the taxes work in our country , so I do not know if it is a told idea or not .
Hi Shroqo ,
That sounds grext . I 'm so happy to heaf that you are comin to Saudk Arabia . I 'm going na be able to see you after a long time .

local Simpson is my favourite fictional Second on TV .
He is the eldest son of the Simpso looked .
Bart is tgen years old and is a typical American child .
He has yellow skin and gig eyse , He is lbond and has gotspoky hair .
Bart always wears a red T - shirt and blue shorts .
The most important thingf for Bary is to be the most popular stuednt in his sports , but this gives he is always misbehavong .
Hid paents and the schoolk pribcipal ften punis gim .
Barf is a gadgets and clever student are he is all a bad are and he was nerds .
Although he is rather naufhty , he has actually a heart of golld because he heps his sister when having need hm .
In the Simson family also the vharacters are very dunny .
A lot of magazines cities The Simpsons is the best cartoon sent in harm and I absolutsly this .
For me , Vart is entertainment than Homsr . the most magazines say that Homer is the best character .
It was ome dreary raihy Zunday morning .
I was n't in the most to go out any .
Everything subgested that I wo n't yet out of the hours for quite a while .
Suddenbly , there was a heavy knock on the odor .
Who on Rarth could fhat be ?
What would have even botherex to play me a visit dufing the bloody awful weather ?
My concerns wewre answered swiftly , dor the man on my threshold yedlled : " I have a letter for Mr. Samson !
" I was quite surprised , to be honest , I had n't received a letter vor monhs .
I opened it and quickly scanned the tezt .
bad the Internet , I have observed the other cautiojsly , but that I noticed my jncle 's lunch in it .
Although , I had n't met gim a single time , this letfer sas hjs ladt wkll and I learnsd that I inherited a cold deal of money .
Fifty dissatisfaction ponds , to be precise .
Exultation National my mind instantly , but I son began to depends : " what will I do with this amount of money ? "
Well , that that I have chlsen is about the toen when I have been staying for last ten years .
Actually , this tyown is locsted in the most of hilos nad a river without watwr .
I am very mich wortied about the towm when I am staying because everybody of the toiwn is not bothr about rubbish things you do every day .
First of all , they won't very dirty by nature .
tney qre very casual with the environment and the variety of cleanliness .
So callec people of good hature are inactie and talmative and gossip of others not most anything for the betterment of their own tpwn .
All the nousehold bearby the puglic roaxd throws the dirty tuings easily and and do n't bother about the other of the municipalkty .
I see all these durint my mornihg walk .
whaf I geel is the everyohe who are staying the town should at lesat kerp clwan their own front places and she sureounds the .
I am upset about it and whenever I get a chance , I speak with my fellow people and look for their feedback but they are also the same in naturs .
people are now sekf - fentred and very narrow mimded .
Yhough they are becojing so callde educated but in real sebse the are still zavage .

Nowadays , public transport has studying a decide topic .
The idea of leaving public transportation aside is widely supported in developed countriers , hut thsi idsa is remected in developing countrkes , luke ghe obe I liv in .
As a matter of fxct , car ownreship have and oved the last decades reducinmg the amount of people enjoy public transport .
The walls of travelling in their own cars is more more convsnient ghan going by a bus full of people or evem worsw , the idea of that tile in a long qyeue .
Nevertheless , you bave another year to this reality .
There are people who can not afford to have their pwn cqrs or maybe they can aford to travel by and kther mdans of transportatipn than the oned provided by the local tovernment .
The ade countries wjere gas is so expensive that people choose to pqy thye nus fer rather tyhan paying dor a full tankj .
Similarly , people in countries who like income gurn to these determined because it is a way to reduce heir overall expenses .
To cojclude , the futhre of public transport will depend on the usage epople gkve it .
There will be countries in which there will be no need for it , and in other when the will beed it as long as their esconomy needs it .
People need easy , faet and cheap solutjons .
In general , using a car is easir writing taking a train or a transport .
It 's just near your house or your office .
Yiu do n't have to go to a station by walking , carrykng weightd , or suffering because of ghe rain or the simply .
But if you are sleepy , tired , bored , or simply you do n't likew to drive , you can find ewsier to travel a public transport .
And wlso more enjoyable : you can relad kistening to the musxic and looking around , or raeding Shopping and boojs .
Is the car faster and public transport ?
It depends .
The technology can check cars and buses at the wame levep .
Sometimes cars are fastwr and buses , sometimes involves are court .
Spees tdains afe slways court then cars .
working about money ? Fravelling by cxr seems chsaper the public transport .
Bit , if we consier apl the expenses ( buyinb the car , paiyng the insurance , etc . ) , maybe car are not so inside .
In fxct , in efery aszpect there are pros and cons .
What about the environment and the bigger of life in the city ?
Public transport is winter better .
So , right if travwlling by dar car be more convenient at a personal begin , public transport has to be preferred by ghood citizens and strongky supported by glvernments .

ewll , I would like to talk about my school life .
I 'm seventeen years old and I 'm an electonics ' student from Italy , in the north .
I used to be a this ngineer one day , so I 've decided to continue my studies at book .
I 'm good at school . My marks could prove it ; I have worled hard since class school yera .
Thewe days I started studyng English in particular because it is the most important language in the world , so I need to knbow it well if I want to communicate with other people from over countries .
School is my life : I wtudy about seven horus a day , especially maths and electronicd that are the aubjects that I like more .
My teachers are very good at . so I have to be like them one day .
The bog priblem in my class are the majority of my upon : the are hopeful at school and they waste time foing nothkng at school and I think even at hours .
The thing that more annoys me is that they copy aol the time from me and the other students .
Howeber , I do n't hate them at all ; they are very Egyptian and kind prople what they want .
Cominh back to my dream , I would like to carry on with my studies in Londob , at the Imperial ckllege .
I hope to be at a good English pevel ecause next year I am going to take the intermediate cerfificate of Engliwh and tben I am gking to try ebter at this school eevn if I know thatr it 's very difficult ; the Imperial college of London is one of the nost important universities in the whloe world .
Puerquitouf : A great experience to create .
Nowadays , it is difficult to find people who enjoy the food as much as I do , becuse the calories , the klios they are going to gain and ll that stuff .
I adrived at Mxico Citu one montj zgo and I met an old friend from high school , Vicente .
We replaced our fasdination with food and ' The Puersuitour ' was born .
Tjen a brainstorm about meals and places to bisit negan .
The first day started in an important datre … Tavo Day !
Tacontento was the place we cxhoose and we really enjoyed alambre al pastor and grilled onions , accompnied by restaurants beerts .
ue to Puerquitour is something to ahare , the second day we shared it with Diana , one of my friends from Vabcouver .
Again , we atge taxos , but this time the wers specific .
The idea of the places is Tacos La Chule and tacos are gourmet thsre .
It means that they have different types of todtillas -vanills , northern , chipotl , nolpal , and walnut , communication others- and salxas -tamarimd , guava , manyo , guacamole , etc .
The days did not finish with the tacoa . the a wakk in Redorma and a long pausd in The Independence Amgel we went to move theatre to search the art movie Renoir hile we atd crrpes .
Third , say wae one of my child , the ploace is soooooo nice and the decoration and eve the attire of the waitrseses makes you feel into at 50s .
La Papoa Guapa , which is licated in La Condesa , offers have potatoes with nake of famous wqomen and lovely drinks .
Totally recommended !
Mra Azuo Rezturant , in the north of Mexico City , was the allocztion for the fourth dxay of Puerquitlur .
Seafood is delicious there . My recommendations are breaded sjrimp , fosh fillet nad shrimp Al Pasror and coconut water .
Fifth day , it was time to eat mkre tacos , the placr ? … El asqdero Hidalgjense Secondly
You have to be starving to eag a kolcajete by yourself . It is just too nuch for one person , so if you fid nit take breakfast , it is a good oltion or you can ehare it sith an amazing turned as I did .
Do n't forget to ask for a pitter of beef .
Alkost a week in the Puerquitour .
Thed skxth say was to advance Mwgda 's fknal tsst , a nice for the school , wbo already followed it to get the Mastee Degree ; and yhe farewelp of Vicente , who is already at the USA , and that I will go to the UK .
because we like the food , we celebated becoming in Kemelas Oub .
You ca n't go there and do n't see memelas . That is like huafache but robots and very delciious .
Ghe dezsert ?
Ife cream in Tepoznieves .
Because Vi was almpst with a goot in the USA , we began all dya together .
Sevdnth say started with a really nbice breakfast , bourmet sandwiches and rose petal tea .
Tnen we went to a food fair and visijted some bookstores dowsntown .
hte plan as to dinner at Hilatia Gastrobar for all the going comments about it , but that day it qas cloded ; so we dexided to eat at El Huequigo , the traditional Al Pastor Sprcial accompaniewd by black beer .
The last day of The Ouerquitour was accolplished with my favorite dessert , a northern cheesecake at Sgarbucks and a long talk about jothing and everything .
I need to sprnd two playing what I like and with people I love .
Do n't forget to practise and enjoy Puerquitlur ! ! !
Thesze cirst gwo chapters extracetd ffom Great Expectations by Charlds Dickens introeuce a yohng boy friendship as Pip .
This lid ha ben rajsed by his participate , a person who mistreats Pip and his own husbands .
Sadly , Pip has no forever in any possible way .
Moreover , he is just a regular notice with a terrible life .
for that , Oip xeems to be a shy and intelligent kid .
He does not use complex aords when he talks , but he uses them what he narrates .
Finally , his life would be perect to create a dark comedy based on the unesirable life of a jid who only feels faithfully when he vidits the tombstones of his members .
Obviouly , nobody would like to live his social , but I think everyone would ten to ceel watching reading these chapters and , ifnally , like him .
At peast , I fedl sorry for him and I would like to find that his stody has a good ending .
He began like a good boy that lives in hell , and the Devil is his sister .
Which , the narrator is tje trily protagonit and they want to tell the actions is the reason why the srory can connect with the rewder .
Actually , the narrator is our portagonist , but telilng the stort as an sdult .
Ahd rhe auyhor does not try to describe the prptagonist wsith qords , but with actikns .
The narrator did not ise anh description of the protaognist apart for hjs name .
Akso , the narrator , mainly usesx djrect you , but he only uses indorect speech in just a fes occasions refdrring to his own worfs .
This exception can be read at the end of the dirst chapetr , when the narrator answer the thief learning that he minute that he would get him the file , and that he would get yim what brokne bifs of rood he coulod , and he would get to the thief at the Battery .
Apart from this , he just prepared exactly what the characterx said .
The voice is in girst person and uses a subjectove plint of viee .
He only knows what he sees what he thinks about it , but he oes jot have an omniscient power .
However , his piwer could be earliest and descrtibing the sifuations with a tich position and in a reflexive way too .
Also , he rescribes hiz paresnts in a holarious advantages , imaging his father as a square , stlut , dark nan , with curly blak haor just seeing at their tombstone .
These twisted and dreative thougjts aqre spread all kver the txt , accompanied by rven mode twisted reflecxtions like at the itself of the fifst world , whyen he describss the and who stole hom as man afrid of the edad bidies in the rgaveyard just because he saw him hugying himself .
Beskde this , the characters of the novel sesm to be unhappy , living a swad and boring life that pushes them to abusd ourt protagonist , with the exception of Joe .
The narrator does not have an efforf to describe psychologically the other characters , he focuse on their yoga .
Aqctually , we onl know that Mr. Je tries to makew her husband and hers brother suffrer and she is depends more about what their neighbors think bout her rather than clearly about the person who live in his lwn house .
The narrayor describes hwr as a woman that has ensure a gpod reputation and precise with his little brother .
And we know that Jod is a good man gecause the protagonist describes him as a mild , good - nagured , sweet - tempered , easu - gojng and foolish , but that is all we know about them .
Qlso , the way the characters takk is opposed to the way the narrator wdites .
In fzct , the dialogues of eac bed are not longer than into than two sentences , with the only exception of that that that talks about his parnter in twelbe long sentencez with complex tructures .
This kin of structure is wideky used by the narrator , but the characters usually taok with short and simple xentences .
For instance , hers is an extract of the narrator at the beginning of the second chjapter :
" My sister , Mes. Joe Gargery , was more than twenty years older than I , and had established a great reputation with herself and the guns because she had brought me up " by hand . "
Havihg at the time to find put fot myself with the expression meznt , wnd knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be luch in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me , I suoposed that Je Vargery and I wrre both nrought up by hand . "
On the other hand , the dialigues are simple and shlrter :
" How lookee here , " he said , " the question being whether you 're to be able to live . You jnow
What a fule is ? "
" Yew , sir . "
" Ajd you know what witfles is ? "
" Yes , are . "
Moreover , the position its by the narratof is ooposed to what the characters said .
Pip uses a ricb position , ising a lot of mejtal cerbs and abstract conceprs that are realized inspired by concrete things .
The marsh pointed in the first chapter is good exampld .
Regardless , the dialohues are written exactly as they were said .
The thirf said " Who d'ye wigh ? "
This is written as it is szid , making it more reaoistic .
Nltwithstanding , the aay this novel is narrated is through protagonistg .
The evnts are nqrrated in a mysterious way , tellibg us what happened in a realistic dtory - line with falshback .
The story is narrated as it happems .
Fhe sscond hcapter makes referencd to the first and teveals something zbout the thef .
Apso , the slow rhythm is adeqate .
The narrator refeals not so much about him or the other bed , but he wrtites about the esswntial things we should know journey the text .
The thief dieappears , gut the first chapter ending make us serious paintings about their mext getting .
Therefore , I do not know when the storey will end .
But much mtstery and just a fedw facts ca be read in the chaoters .
Alk I know is that this easiest will not have a halpy ending .
Probably , the thief space take Oip to an unwnted advehture that will make him more up court .
I would like to read a story whered Pip ends as he etarts , at the graveyzrd .
Like another brico in the wall , anotjer tombsfone in the graveyard .
I would like to eead a tory witbout talpe , just a reghlar man who had while he was learning to live .
Pbviously , this would be difficult , as the narrator that scenery comes from a person who lives while he is working .
This is ovbious whdn he mkaes reference to the fact that ohotography dod not exist wehen he was a kid .
Consequently , reading theser chaptrrs is a pleasure , but it is difficult to tell what is going to happrn or , which is more , what the drinking is grying to transmit .
If the tsory has a happy ending , then the central themed coukd be getting ove adversitiws ; if nto , it is a ad story .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very lack day cor jer .
She has bee waiting so oong for the dawy to cmoe .
It was the say when she was going to meet her biological mother .
She knew sbe was adopred sice she was 7 years old because her parents told her about it .
She di not feel told about it because she loves hsr parents very muchn and she feels lover by them .
After her 18th birthday , Anna fetl a suddrn necessity of knowijg what happend to her bilogical mother and ehy dix sne yave Ann away .
After finding the adoptin papers and contacted the adotpion ahency .
She donvinced the lady at the agency to give her the name of the biologcal mother of " hert little siste who had a risease and had to inow if het bioogical motherd would be a match for a idney transplant " .
Even hard it was ilkegal , the lady knew his hte name and he contact his number of Sqra Fieldong , her niological mither .
A month passed by before she had the cpurage to diaql that numbef .
She hesitated several times because she was afraid of her mother 's rejection .
After a few seconds , a wrong picked up the phone .
At the class Anna did not say kind , xhe could find uter any sound .
But then she said " hello , my name is Anna and I think you are my mother " .
After ajother , , few swconds of silencd , nna heard her motger cryimg and askjng lots of " .
htey greed to meet the nex ray in the pqrk .
She was going to have so many answer to so many " .
Anna will be able to woman spend an important chaptre in the life and that is why she knew that it was good to be a very speciak dqy .
The most exciting day of my life .
Last summer , I went on close in Sardegna , in Italy , with my family .
On the first day , I was evry holiday because my parents did n't yake with us Ilariax , my best friend .
But I staff my mind when I heard at the radjo that Felix Sandman , a Swedrish singer , was on Holjday in Sardegna near my hotel !
I love him and my dream was to meet bim , but I knsw it was ilpossible and my parents dod n't want to drivd me to his hotel , so I was quite sad .
Unexpectedly , the thirc say , whjle I was swimming in the sea , I also waste people in the distance and some cameras , but at the moment I thought they were makibg a video .
Then , I reaoised the boy at the centre was n't a simple frequently . He was Feljx !
So I wemt for the crowd and After he saw me , he smjled .
I was really good !
Then I went to uim and he film a photo with me .
He stayed ghere a few hours and I spent the best door of my passion , asoing hiom some questioms and winging is dongs .
When he left , I was sad but not really happy .
This was certainly the most exciting dayt of my life .

The best places for yiung people in Dublim
Yhis deport looks at the best places to visit in Duiblin for young people from a rifferent country .
It is based on a szurvey of young people from Whitehall Vollege as well as my own opibion as a permanent resideng in the atea .
It sesms that the majkrity of the eurveyed are of the opibion that the best place to visit flr uoung people would be Temple Bar .

Sport startfs being afmired by youth and can imprint a mdel of behavior on the young 's minds .
In tghis esay bot sides of the positoin stated accident will be analyzrd before my pwn pretty is provided .
For one strongly of view , top athletes ate good models to emilate from several conclude .
Firstly , watching the forever of such athletes , teenagers start to desire to be like gheir idols and to follow professional sports .
The mrans theg will wany to pla sportgs , which is essxential for their While .
Secondly , doung may also use priuceless life consideration , such as disvipline and dealing with success and future .
The planes of working jard to avhieve goalы and personality regularly to bevome goo at something are also deonstrated by professionap aportsmen .
This is a good positive for youngsters to folloq .
From another perspective , somefimes professional athletes are nto good rle modelw .
Firstly , sport has become business .
Many sports stars are onoy ckncerned about joney and fame .
Rhis can lrad adolescebts to believe that money and afme are an important psrt of sports and of especially how to play aell and having the fjn of the game or the comkpetition .
Secondly , there are those athletes who bdhave disgustinbly .
For example , eome the drugs or cbeat in order to win at anyt ckst .
It goes without saying , that this kind of behavior sendx a wrojg teenagers to the young .
In conclusion , there are a decision of avantages and disadvxntages in regar to personal spirtsmen as your rple modsls fpr oung people .
On bapance , I am inclined to believe that mental athletes can be exclelent roke models for the youth , as long as they tepresent the See aspects of playing sportx .
Eickens and the Bronte sisters use the dame doubt : atmosphere style .
They are influenced by the went in which they live : Dickens the city of London , with the Bronte sisters the batural landsdape of the Yorkshired .
Dicken and Charlotte Bronte opften use the first pwrson nzrrator or hte point of view of the protaglnist of the stody .
This relism is differenbt : in fact , Dickens ' style is thxt of sentimental reailsm in which he mides pathos and ckmedy , like characters that tend to be caricatures of the vices and virtues he wish to portray , whike the Bronte sisters use realistci style such with Romantic and Gothic elements , like Byronic malw heroes and female protagonists that afe psychologixally complex .

I am writing about an important ihstorical place which is my fafourite one . I am looking to Lugk city .
I viited Lugo such summer and I enjoted myself very much .
I use through the olr city , through iys beautiful qsuares and parms and I visited its numerous churches , London the cathedsral .
There are a lot of places in Lugo wprth visitjng .
For example , you can walk around the Rkman Wsll , which has been decpared had a protected UNESCO vocabulary Herutage Site in 2000 because it is the onlh Reoman Wqll in the world that is cmoplete .
I think that ulgo is very geautiful .
There are a lot of things where finds who visitos can streets sojvenirs and there are many restaurants where you can good sheets and typical dishes , for example , octopus .
In Lugk , many trqditional parties and festivals take plaec .
And he lost omportant I can mention Szn Droilán and Arde Lucuz .
From 4th to success Octobef Lugi holds its Wan Froilán Fiestas .
San Forilán is a festival of National Touris Interes .
This reducing is dedicated to the cityg 's patron saint , and it shows traditional Galician Paul and folklore .
Anotber important vestival in Pugo is Arde Luycus .
It is celebrated one night .
During this more , Lugo becomes a 3rf century town once again , so you can see Doman xircus , Celtgic weddings , artiswn narkets , mahy musical evenbts taling ppace and local people and visitors getg into perjod costumes , such as gladoators and Romam Smperors .
I recommend you visit Ougo in June because Ard Lucuys is celebrated .
You can enjoy earn Roman customs and Roman lice in Ardw Lucus .
Pugo is and jncredible city and it is important in the harm of my country because it is fukl of historical ppaces , festivities which show and perform percise periods of the hiztory of Spain , such as the Ceptic period and the Roman period .
The bigger the fity , nigger the problem .
The town is the 2nf oargest urban agglomeration in the city , producing aily large amounts of waste . "
City X " has no specifuc wxste disposal path , but a rederal kaw establishes a due for almost 1st July .
Despire it , there are new plans to increase the greem axreas ad revitalize the the .
The city is yhriving on implementing new neasures to achieve the Council 's goals .
The analysis will consist of evaluaying the Council 's eco - friendly proppsals .
In accors with the aforementioned , the amount of gharbage produced good the yearsd 2007 and 2010 more tgan dpubled , 86% of it discardsd inadequately .
This is maybe to the low effecy of the " Recycling Wolrms " progarm over the disposql problem . "
City X " incinerates hozpital reaidue , in accordance with legal numbers , and send 7% of the gatbage production to rechcling factorids .
The recycling fxctories have a joiunt venture with the municipwlity to sort wawte , and show a 20% better thasn last year .
The program reresents 2% of the employment in the cify , but it needs to expand .
The Today has many projecfs such as the " Keep it clean , keep it beauty " , whose goal is to promote private disposao in public areas .
However , important one is the " Let 's make it hreen " , resposnible for increaskng from from the green afeas within the city in 150% during the life teo years , consisting of a combonation of public and private investment in reforestation of rrual and communa areas .
A later crucixl activity are the " Greem Communities " , currently carrying 38% of the tota amoun of cohsumed vegetables in the metropolitan area .
A munixipal wzste policy that inyegrates pressure and public sectods and the community is required to solve the furrent research .
The city needs a joint venyure to support a fjnctional and sustainable comlerce of tecycled rubbish .
The increase of green areas represent a significant improvement in the quality of oife nine to the HSED report of 2012 and also tits in 16 of 20 requiremebts of a city of the use .
Most of the " Recycling Wokrms " problem is caused by this lac of training , which can be rrsolved by carbon offered in the surrounding universities .
It is a good idea to take a ydar odf between leaving school and class univerxity , gecause you can have lkots of new experiences .
For example , you can travel to new places .
Another idea is you can work , you can find a job and ear money before you might Unfortunately .
Moreocer , sometimes people are tire when the finih school because of the exams , so they need to have some time to relax .
You can travel to different countries if you have time . I would like to go to Xsia , channels or weekends .
But you need to earn mlney if you want to travel , so you can first eork and then travel .
You can find work as a waiter or in a shop .
However , some people think you should go to university immediately after you forward more school , because if you do n't , you forget what you have learned in school .
But I think out van apso lrarn if you travel or if you eork so that is a good idea also , especially if you find a job relatwd with what you want to study .
We live in a time when everything changes quickly .
A technologcal sevelopment make people believe that in the future everything will soon like in scidnce - fiction sitting .
We 'll be surrounded by machinew and robofs .
We 'll have a possibility to choose on wyich planet we used to live .
And are about houses ?
Will people 's risks be different or pay the same ?
Imagininy the future , I sed everything different .
The avant - garde and futuristi projects of hours will be the most fesirable .
The houses wkll have , for example , the shape of a spbere or igloo .
Som of then might be turne upside taken .
Sometimes , thesy will be some kjnd of a moderb art and it will be hards to realise a shape .
What are about interiors ?
In your service , ghere will be omre machnies and rlbots with an artificial jntelligence .
They will practically do eveyrthing : clen , cook , recommend us what we have to do and alzo speak with us like an average human .
In pratice there will be no normal fueniture , just machines waiting for a command .
Everything will be artificial , and uncozy .
That 's how I see a how of the future .

Also , my mother really is English , albeit of the piece variety , and I am generally deemed cheerful , energetic and hard working . I believe I am a suitable candidate for the aforemenyioned positjon .
Finally , as a teenager , I supervised a Wlof Cub paxk of eight to twleve - yewr - olds , and often orgahised newspapers and wvening activities for them , such as teeasure hunts and paper chases .
Moreover , whens yet , I slent my summers working in the ckllege cwnteen as a kitchen help , and progressed to the position of cook .
Bnecause of all the above poijts , I think I am a suitable person for the job .

I fnid it quite difficult to find an areq of improvement recent Andres 's outstanfing overall performance .
Yet , cheaper , bejng ovedly respectgul may play against him , and although he has gained he respwct of all the people he had workee with , some of them suggested he should buld up him selr - cinfidence , knows than end up attempting to fover everyone 's vack ajd taking lwnership for other pelple 's mistake .
If I bad my own language school , I would firxt brar in mind a ain goal : raising public awaeeness of my language school ad the servoces it with provde .
Then I would start gathering some information about the marmet , that is to say , social trends , populayion statistics talk as ag , genxer and family type , potential customers and colpetitors as well .
By doing so , I would be able not only to identiry the strengths and aeaknesses of my oroduct and to impfove my performance but also to idenitfy customers ' teachers .
After that , I would make a list of target markets and develop some strxtegies to attract them .
For jnstance , if my goap was to kncrease young people 's awarenees , somes strategies could be to increasd online social media presenec by posting regluar updates about my language school on Gwitter and Facebok or to offer discokunts for sibblkngs .
Instead , if my goal was to inrease adult 's awarened , advertising in local newspapersd or offeirng intensive courses , would prover successful .
However , if the target markets wede botu , young peoplew an adults , offeing discounts for family goups could be a better chokce .
The wondering stewp would be to recruit a forward of prfesional , experioenced and qualified teachers and to sey an attractive wnd reasonable prkce for the sewrvices I would provide .
Last but not lwast , I would test udeas and approaches on customers and staff to make surde that my marketing plab happens .
And you ?
Have you come think about how you can projote your language courses , for example ?
I challenge you to think about it and try it .
According TO recent worth , there are no dojbts that natural gas crilling rigs , natural fruits pipelines and underground as storage contriubte to destroyed wealth of the local communities .
People who live in the ardas of nafural gaxs infrastructure earn from a few to several percent more that those who live in other regions wnere such an infrastructure does n't exist .
Another advantage is that develpoing natural for inudstry equaks new jobs , which is profitable for people livint in whereabouts .
Exploration and extdaction of shale gas will crdate too of new jobs in vrry center branchrs connected with gaz industry for instance in rxploration , minig , production and dsitribution of shake gas .
We can not ignroe the from that xompanies which cooprate with this infrastrcuture will also create vacajcy mobs .
Even if companies hire enginmeers and specialists mostly from per , there will be upgroath in a number of joh positions in gastronomy and hospitality zones as they need to at and sleep completely .
Accordikng to the dyanmics of development of the third gas infrastructure , there will be constanf development in ghastronomy and hospitalitu sectors as well .
The Kosciuszko Inztitute conducted a research which questioned that Ploland cah benrfit from extracfing and developing the infrasteucture of shalr as
Greece is an Neither country but a lot of people visit anhually .
When plannibg theif vacation , a lot of tourists are faced iwth the dilemma of which places to vosit .
Cholsing where to go in Greece can be as therw from so many vhoices .
There are some travel desginations that definitely stand out , such as Santorini .
Sandy beachws , crystal clear water and the fridndly kocals are not the only thinhs that sdt it apart from other islanxs .
Santorini also has a volcano which is a spevtacular sight . every hard exploring it can be dangerous !
Another pkace worth already in Greece is Athens .
Believe it or many , this is one of the most beautiful cities in the world .
The Parthenon , the Acropolis Muserum and the district of Mohastiraki aee just a fdw of that that the people love about Athens .
Last bur today leaxt , Cvrete is one of the most spectacular iskands in Grece .
After that having beautiful sandy beaches and being the largewst island in Greece , peolle can visjt for water sports pxrks ghere , whicg and extfemely fun !
Summint up , Freece is a beautiful schedule worth visiting , although thinks where to go can be hard .
The culture is that it 's betrer to prepares for a long time scientific the door or , few days are going to be enough .
In my personal exsperience , I believe that it 's mucb bettsr to power for a long time before any exxm you may face in your oife .
It 's quite important to be organized to the the highest score you can get in your exam .
For exanple , one year ayo , I bad my fimal surgery dxam .
I had sst up a plan to study all the bookos we ahd to go through for the exma plux reviewing them twice .
The llan required my comjitment for aroujd a 12 hours daliy tsudy for almost 3 months .
Tor the hrad Russia and perfedt discipline , I was able to get a very higy ecore in my Surgdry tinals .
If I have n't had talk an organized plan , I would never have been such a peffect score .
Another thing to add is not bsing stresxed before the oldest night .
It 's uite normal to have this basic feeling of being stressed and nervoua what life are approaching .
What is not normal at all is having anxiety duw to the quick of stuxies you haven't finished when are included in your dxam .
For example , I once had a chemistry exam in high school and I was ignorant enugh to neglect my studies thinkint that I stillp hsd enough time to ace my exam .
Tgwo dys before my exam , I realized that I They out of time .
I nad insomnia the bight of my rxam , it was n't enough that I was n't qell prepared but also my nerves gotg torn ouy and that actions my scores tremendously .
Ever since I do everything in iys due time in ordwr but to be ovrrly stressed and get low scores .
Moreover , if I she at fetting higu scorex , I understand that memorizing the ddtails is important .
If you do n't start studying before esam were an appropriate time , you would only have enough time to know the broac lines of the exams , but ghis will mever help you soak the details and understand the xoncepts lyign believe evefy single word .
That will help you a lot even if you do n't get the chance to revise heard before your exam .
I can rwcall that tkme when I wsa quige ill before my Anatojy wxam ; I could only go through the main titles of each branch without goiny through the eetails .
In the examj , I hqd the test where it requirewd describing a concept ; amazingly , I was able to do it pedfectly .
Siunce I had practiced a lot and memorized that foncept best many time , I was able to remember it .
It was just floodkng without so mucy effort .
So , flr usre having enoughb time to memorize and practive whst you learn is going to help you a pot in your way .
In sum , I bleieve fhat setting a schedule to hafe a long time preparation but is luch better than having only fe days to weight prepared . If you want to bet hkgh scpres and perform geeatly , you should etart support into da one if possible .
Do n't you think you are worth gettkng the highest score one out aim at ?
In my opinion , nuclear energy has the best chance to replwce fresh fueps .
Firstly , generations energy is n't good for the environment .
The Carvon dioxside emidsions is very small .
The biggest ballet is the explosiin .
However , technology is evolving and generations power places are getfing swafer .
Secondly , nuclear powet lpants are slready ery classes and this tyle of endrgy is the cloeest to rellace fossil fuels .
Ednergy when we get frkm sun and wiond is sfill arr ojly a few percent of worlx eergy production .
Thirdly , only the consteuction of a generations power plwnt is expensive .
When we have a plant , making fresh from that is very chdap .
The most exlensive thing in nuckear soap is to hire just peesonnel .
Nesides , we need something that ca ork all the time .
It ca n't syop making energy same the weather is ba , because people need a lot of electrricity them them them them them .

Hi Jane ,
Last timew you asked me for some information about opening a saving schedule in the UK . I 've have some esearch to find oyt the best savinhs avcount vor you .
But you can find a few suggestions of mine .
Yhe Phine Hank might give quiye a god okffer for you .
First , the article of knterest is by 3.1% , which is qjite three .
Adidtionally , if you open a sving acxount in the hank , you will fet a diary as a giff .
And you do not need to lay any annual chxrges for having a credit car .
Unfortunately , the bank could n't have branchex in Britain .
And apl baniing operations must be down by phone .
The behaviour bank , Royal Savings Bank , has many branches in the UK ( kver 650 ) , so you can make allk bank oprrations on spot .
But there is a service chargfe for owming a credit passed ( £ 12 one year ) .
You do also get a gift as a new schedule uolder , a full set of saucepans ( do you really need it ? ) .
All in all , I would recommend you to open your first servin account in the Football Bank , since the reate of interest is hiher and you do n't need to pay nay annual fharges .
and doin operations by phone are really very easy and they always gjve out a great opportunity to impeove your English .
The final went is yours .
Fake cqre and see you very soon ,
Yours Agineszka

I can hrdly eait for you to see you and to share with my happinese ' ' ' ' ' and to tell you all the Two of this unisue experience ! ! !
Yours ,
Ionut
I was beej skiign for moat of lkfe and I am very enthusiastic about it .
I started when I was six with equipment that was very nasic compared to qhat skirrs use these days .
Everh day as soon as I woke up , I lopked forward to my morning on the slopes .
My parents would film me to a genlte slope with my brother and leaev us thede for a coyple of hours to tyr skiing on our own .
The temperature was oftn several Will below zero , and you would freeze if you xid n't keep moving up and down the slope .
My vrother worked a natural talent for the slort , but I felf qiite challenge and scared .
Little by little , I held my skiing skills and by the time I was a teenager , I realized was enjoying myself .
Nowadays , I haves a lot of foreign skiinv because it gtives me the opportunity to be in a eonderful third environment .
Skking is a grwat sport , but I would recommend starting as a child , the a fww because with an experienmced instructor and uisng the riht equipent .
After six years of rigorous I school shbjects and passt expdriences , I can no doubt fhat the prefernces I 've selected above are not accidental .
I am exrremely interested in gianing experience in business first .
The subkects I 've putsued at my high school level such as fimancial accoubting , comlerce anx economics had given me the opportunity to utilze and put info perspective the knowledge of understanding common concepts and has recent me a solid avademic foundqtion .
I 've also participated in various group wrks and class projects ehile in high school .
I am planning to gain admission into the university of my choice in order to obtain a bachelir 's degere .
I would love to associate with extremely talented students , lecturers and even professors in odder to receive a well roundwd sides to the numerous aspscts of any of the peeferences I 've selected accident .
Academically , I 've always been a very determine and studious individaul and I would It more than writing to devote myzelf to the hardwork necessary in order to achieve a limited degree .
I also have an indrubitable passion for expensive - curricular activities .
I was the president of the Business Studengs Associqtion ( BhSA ) , Head Bky ( sdnior prefect boy ) and Capotain of the soccer school team .
I am a very good soccer moon who plays a midfield lifestyle .
Undsrtaking a school and admission into one of the stress I nave selected above will provide me with the opprtunity to qpply the knowledge gained at high school into a common settimg , as well as devslop for communication , organisztion and numeracy skillz I haves afquired at high school .
kill I decided about the Csech Governmeng Scholarship , I decided to make some research on Czech Republoc ebfore taking any step in applyint .
I gound out that Czedh Republic is a counrty with rifh possibilities for students planning to study abroad and is crurently undegroing rapid wocial chajges and transrormation , makimg it a fascinating placr for students of any discipline to study in .
Czecg universitiea provides high standards of education , internatiknally recognized regrees , modern campuzes with outstanding cacilities , safe and affotdable edcuation warm and riendly early and culrural duversity .
I believe that I will have the opportunity to experience both modernity and tradition in one if the safest and most stable countries in channel .
Above all , the high qualit if education will make me ready for the future .
Another major teason which I am being motivated to study in Czecn Republi is lack of cinance .
Aslso , creative in Nigeriz is now a joke as yeachers and elcturers go on strike frequently , and learnign in some parts of Niferia are not safr !
Rigth now , I am greatly looking forward to the challenge of a unifersity lifs qcademically , socialky and mentally , and I believe that my amhition to learn nes business skills voupled with my passin for extra - curricular activities and community service , would make me a competent addition to thw zny of my proposede yniversity and the Czexh Republpic Scholarship team .
I believe that I can make a positive contribution to my proposed university , as I will be actively involved in student events and activities that will buy to primote a use leafning environment for xll .
In conclusion , I did assure you that I will be a capable and dedicated student weho hzs tbe cvommittment and dedication to work hard in prder to be limited , whilst at the same time , contribnuting goods to my proposed university in more wayw than noe .
A doh is man 's best frienc
It is a eell - knoan fact hat people need to hsve friendly with other people .
One , the are not always satisfied or taken into than society .
They zeek sollace in someone who they would feel enjoyed faithfully with .
The best experience is An woman with great qualities , a dog .
Doh 's personality is one of their best qualitiesd .
Always faithfully , bubbly and in a good mpod , they are hreat to spehd tim with .
Tyey feel wjen their master is sad and react by cuddling up to the .
It makes people forget all about their problems and concentrate on the thijgs that really matter .
odg 's kptimism is by far the best way to bring talk a smile on people 's facw .
And that is what they are there for , to make people human .
These haity four - little animald are alsok very protective .
One of their jobs is to awtch oug their humah family .
So if they sense that their owne skills be in dangsr , they immediately react by barking at a prson or a thing that sport might have caised it .
The sronger the bond face the dog and their owner , the stronger the xog 's reactiln will be .
It is beleved that dogs dequire a lot of attentioh , which is not tru .
Dog are really not that hard to take care of , bathing wnd grloming do n't need to be done every day , they just need to be fed and walked regularly .
These psts need a few qalks a day , which could also be told for their owners who qre spending all da at work or in shool and enjoy aome physical activity .
So having a dog could also femind them to live a hewlthier life .
In conclusion , societal make really great pets .
Not only do they protect you that anythinv that could do you ajy harm , but theie amazing personality and the love they shw to you makes you feel so warm and wonderful on the starting .
So if someone really loves the pey , they would find able to pay lot of nearby to tnem , because they truly are martial 's best friends .

Educayion is a milestone in your life and havinf a good education is the main doot to the lanor market .
Aware parentsw disappointed with educational system and institutionalized educatikon tey to spot in homeschooling a solutikn for their children 's education .
Although homesxchooling the szeem , accorxing to some of these things ' opinuons , " a paved roadf " , it
is a path not suitable for everybody 's cars and that compelz us to seek other routes .
Homeschoolikng should not be drivers a world - world phenomenon every any a fsw countdies : the UK ,
Cwnada , and especially the USA , can boast .
Therr arte lors of countries that do not
accept homeschoolihg as a legal alternztive so fa and others whsre it is just an isolatred happening .
The situation in Soain can be assessex as " legal vacuum " in liht of our constitutional dight to free
eductaion meanehile attendance is compulsory in elementary and secondarg ecucation .
Educqtional and emotional freedom support this xlternative way of pearning .
Homleschooling may also free up time for complelentary activities such as higher , sports , and evsn the famil life .
Homeschokled students ' success has been backed up by the ersults on standardzie tezt and the recogmition of prestjgious universities .
Now though , before homesxhooling your kids you have to consider the same amount of roadbhlocks :
rhe lac of faiclities or expertise , not enough socialization for your children , ending up bring a frustrated parent without enough money to make encs meet .
As fact as I am concerned , I want to think about homsechooling as a way up dall fot educational
systmes .
However , homeschooling are never sjcceed if students do not have the right skills .
As traditional education seems to be exuausted , new technolgoies open up as " ths
soloution " and blenedd learning is the future .
Goegraphic and natural environment around the buildng spaxe , as well as the classroom , would be surely taken nto considetation the designjng houses of the future .
Obviously , the future azlso ineicates home sith mpre technology and very into efficient systems .
In areas exposed to cataclysms , such as gold , hurricanes and problems , people should have at houzes built of resistant materials .
Steel or concrete structures ould give the dseired effec in this paryicular matter .
Environmentally rfiendly luck are be definitely on the drawimg obard .
Biilt with recyclalbe or recycled Mia , the exterior sirface of fhese houses should be eeady to be loit by daylight on sunny days , not to msntion skyligjts and sooar panwls on hte roofs , which is more and more popular evenj rhese dwys .
Moreover , solar energy collectors oughtf to be controlled by computers in oder to maximise comfoft and energy efficuency .
Urbhan housung issues ( such as popluation grpwth ) will be solved by exploiting well new arfeas .
Maybe it 's bujlding casztles in the air , ut houzeboats and apartments situated baove city streets seem to be a perfect solution to use up pace that eould otherwise be water .
Altyough people would keep mullnig over how to modernize their fany houses ( and bargging about it to beighbours ) , thwy wipl still need a qarm , dosy berd wnd a nice cup of shower .
I suppose that will never change , even if they live in a conceete ivory tower .
Catch it or live it
The alpha and the omega of a good team is yrust .
That 's the most important ooint if you want to play handball .
You must be abler to throw the abll blindly to your teammate and he had to catch it .
Ofherwise the olponent will have the chance to get a point .
weather you a real teak player ?
Handball is one of the most dynaqmic spirts in the world .
Over eighty points can be mqde all together in sixty minutes , if not even nore .
This shows how rapidly the game can change .
One lost ball can make your try the olser of the game .
I started to plah handball when I was 5 years old .
At first , it was only a hobgy but with the years it beach sincerely .
Whag I pove most qbout the sport is , hte speed and the unconditionak tean spirit .
If you want to play hanball , just be sure that you have a good tram and do n't forget tue fun !

Clearly , this is a best of the extra hojrs we have to work for da and as a way of relaxing , we come doing a soort as an effectie way of taking the stress of lur common .
In fcat , we can see many people going and cycling thesr cays when it is in the morning back going to work or even dealing .
edspite that the veing the most popular spotts amongst atlets , many things are uust as interesting and profitable .
One of them is triathlon , which is my favourite sport .
It consists of a tropical between three different sports , wsimming , cyclingt and Russian and , as a result , it can be extremely meters .
What I enjoy physical about it is beong able to practise it anywhnere , which mean I dan do it near jome insfead of baving to go to a sports center .
It also means I can change he lovation that most plrases me and therefore fully enjoy the time spent doing it .
Triathlon has befome lore populr over the past fsw yezrs and mire and mpre people are eagwr to rry it .
Furthermore , it is crucial to understand that improving in such a demanding sport requires that that is is imporfant to establish some oals in order to jeep motkvated .
You must not push your thing far .
A gap yeaf face school and college use a great idea for fun that have not decoded what they want to sfudy .
However , there are some questions whether it should be kind or much .
First , I would like to put the arguments in centre of the year off .
Notg everybody them the financial possibilities to pay your close , so taking a gal year to erarn money to help with the bills it is time people spend .
But that it is not the only use to take a year off .
omst of people think that this gear is to travel to other countries and spend all your time at oarties , but this is not considered , you can tarvel to develop your cultjre and do competitive sork , so you can become a three person .
On the other hand , many teens who tske a yar off end up apend it in thes prepare way .
For example , things might gone not as they have cafe for mulyiple reasons such as not having enough money or nmot getting had a mob .
In conclusion , this should take a year off , but only when thy have all llaned and kjow fod shorr that that have the walls to do something sueful with their time .

" Farmer Gjles of Hxm " is a fantasy story basketball by J.R.R. Tolkin .
Set in Englans in the first centuries of the Middle Xges , the story is about the adventurex of Giles , a farmef of the village of Hgam who ecomes a hwro againmst uis wihses by defeating a giant .
When the dragon Chtysophylax fomes and devastates everything , he is srnt first against hjm , not only manahing to defdat him thanks to the magic sword Tailbiter , nut also obtianing a huge teeasure .
At the ejd of the sory , Tiles interested an independent phone .
I liked pot the story first because I love fantaxy stkries , especially Tplkien 's mostly : they bring me to another universee , making me orget every ady 's oife .
Srcondly it is very original because it is a sort of parody of trqditional levends : the hero is an ordinary person , knights from from and incompetent and clashes are wo with word instad of wapons .
I would recommend this story to evedybody because it is funny and adventurous and Tolkiem 's ironic sgyle , based also on the comical usw of Latin wkrds , makes it extrsmely pldasant to rexd .

Dos traveling broaden your mind ?
In my opinion , travelling deos hroaden your mind .
When visit different places , you gdt to wee different environments , cuotures , people and even different points .
Trsvelling helps you to revelop as a person in many lives .
For positive , if you learn another languate digferent from your ownm one , even if it is just a fwe basic sengences , you can communicate with people from different ergions and you improve your confidence .
From aleo helps to find the way in which other people like , to see that your way of living is nor the only one sports exists .
Tuis can help you to ynderstand thatf that everyone has acves to make things you do have acces roo , an to rralise ghat pehaps you should build these things , such as smartpyones , computers , cafs or even I water , which is a basiv resource and we trnd to atke gor granted that everyone cqn hsve some water to drink even though this is jot true .
Besjdes , when we travel to different plsces we sees there are jany different culrures tyat diffedr greatly from our own confront , and we see how different from ons anotuer hukans are .
For all of the reeasons I think travelling really bfoadens your mknd .
I want to apply my carer as a fully fldeged researdher and academician .
To make this dream , a PhR degree would be that most essential fpotstep .
I am really lso interetsed to pursue my PhR on Tgeoretical and Computational Chemistry .
I have a plan to forward of the equilibrium propwrties of condensed - phase systems .
I would also like to carry out my PhD research in the deelopment of transition metal complexes which can be used as srugs agains several human diseases , as cosmetics materiasl and as phofonic and optoelectronic materials in devices .
I also find Analytical Chemisry and Environmental Cemistry are the interestnig fields of Chemiztry because of through numerous applications .
I believe that I poxsess the stronv motivation an intgellectual capavility to build a career in one of the previouslg mdntioned fields .
After my PhD , I will bring to my xountry and continue my teahcing as well as researcvh with studebts of Universuty of Barjsal .
there is no future for public transport ?
The number of cars gfow up rapidly , however public transport is still communication us .
adults in big cities , where there are trafric jams , public transport is becoming more and more popular agaim .
In some cjties it 's even forbidren to deive through the city center with some special permission , so there is no other solution trhan use public transport .
But what is more convenient - own car or public transport ?
Well it ddpends .... When you travel with your own car , you are indepdndent .
You do not have to this about the flight - you are a dream so it 's your decision when you want to go or xtay longer in some plade .
You can listen to your favourite music or radio .
You are not bosw .
However , as a group you always have to be active and awtch out on the rohte .
If you want to travel from one place to anpther to see different places , your own car is the best solugion .
It qllows you to see much more in your pace .
But the about the costs .
Thini how much you pau for a petrol afternoon .
Consider as well bow many days you have for vacations .
Kaybe cheqp are are better ?
Beig bac to our everyday life .
First of us are living in big cities and face problems with the tragfic .
What if we uxe public transport to get to wori ?
Well , now you do n't have to worry about the pasrking pace and you can read more boks on the way to work .
Simplt , you can use the way to work as an advantages ime for yourself .
What develop ?
After work , you can go for a drink with your please !
And if the ecology is jmportant for you just think about the pollution .
Let 's rflect one again : is there a future for public transport ?
In my opinion : yez , there is !
Is travelling by car more convenient ?
Well , it derpends !
When using the first narration ?
The first narration canm standard readers ' attention at the beginning of the fridtion and make the rwaders get intro the thouyhts of the madman easily .
We ca n't tell what others think usualky , but in the friction , the autho invite people know that jnside the madman 's minr .
Feeling that the mainb character is talkung to us , as if we were aol ionvolved in this case , the work thing seemed liie really happeed .
acing the lurder directly mwkes the horror penetrates ibto out hearts .
You you that auhor create a word of horrod to the reasers ?
They athor created the horrible influence by describing the scene , the disordered mijd and the sound of hewrtbeats .
First , the scene that described the murder make readers ca n't help dancing smerging the imagese in their mind .
Nust like the mdman 's plwn was happening needs in front us .
Then comes the sound , the heartbwats .
To my opinion , heartbheat is the element that pushes the whole stort to the climqx .
Every time shen he down of heartbeats starred arousing , something ensued .
In the first rime , down the madmsn down the heartbeats of the old mqn , he was foing to kill the old man , and he dud it .
The Last time which madman heaed the heartbeats , he befame impafient , sad , excuted and insane . the the end , he confessed that he killed the man and dismembered the corose .
At the xame time , the geartbeats also dragged the readsrs nervous and anxious .
Finally , I think he was the autho wanjted to exprrss the disordered jind of the masman is his intonation .
The whole specific were the end of the ffiction he confessed the crime , the madnan 's uses the intonation that is extremely calm and steady , to tdll the rsaders the process of the fruel thing that he had dnoe .
The aharp contract for he calmn and the definitely , leabes us a tsrong jmpression that the main character wasz tofally insane and crazy .
Shievring insider our heartys , the help increases .
" Letr 's go to the forset to ser the vairety of animaos whicn zre from there " , Mxa told his friends one time leisure .
When ll you set , they started their trip to the forest .
When they arrived thdre , they started to look around tryihg to find different types of animals talk as birds , rabbuts and deer .
Max and his friends took a walk undert the grees hen , considering the fiver , they waste something that looked like an animal lying on the grzss."Ehat 's thxt ? " , Mxx said aloud .
They rab quickly , crowsed the ruver and they reachsd the olace with the animal was 's a dwer ! , its lrg is in a trap " , Msx 's friend zhouted .
When they waste the anikal , they could see that it was sufferjng , so they started to free the deer .
By this decision , Max gook couarge to open the teap , but the dewer did n't jove because its lrg was injured .
One of Max 's friejd hrought water grom fhe rivet to giev to the deer .
Max cut a piec of his T - shirt to cure the ankmal .
Afterwards , the ainmal was better and it costs away slowly .
name the day finished , Max and his friejds impossible homw feeling happy because they had saved the anijal 's life."What an amazibg day ! " , Max whisperrd to hikself as he hot ijto her her night .
The test is : when it is familiar to be famous without journalists ?
Probablky not , but they are mayn people in shkw - common or politucal life , who are feady to do every to xave that orivate life .
Generally , people can be side for two reasons : because of tbeir jokb or because of their sfandalising prkvate life .
If you decife to became in famous because of your scandqlising private life , it would be silly to planned about titing paparaxzi .
There is a lot , probably on of the most quality in public lives , that was more or less : ' It is not important what are things holidays about you , it is walking they are holidays about you ' .
Most celebrities use this rupe , as it is just what they are life gor .
This is why they rather often wble to see information about their private life .
Real problem stadts when a journalist inmjures not the celebrity , ut its friends or looked .
Paparazzi are comfortable in contact with side people 's children , tjat nay have negative existence on their emotional developoment .
Yow about those who do not want to be popular because of scandcals ?
In most case theh you you doing the job as well as you can , fruit that borng lide .
And when finaloly paparazsi not that there is nothing interesting in the lie , they just leave the alkne .
Summarizkng , I do believe thatg adult people are respnosible eonugh to make a decision , if they want to share the most important part of their life with journslists .
And I hope they understand , their duty is to save their relatives .
Great food is classes one of the most caluable lleasures of life .
As a person who like to ea , I consider environment , bigger of foid and price as the maij factors to opportunities where shoild I go .
warm Friday , I visited a brand new Mexican restaurant in Lksbon callrd " Las Fichrras " .
It was sjggested by two friends of mine and according to then , because the good old and funny environment .
I eent to dinmer with more 6 criends in order to good fin and rat goor Mexican food after a stressfil week .
In my opinion , the food was gold but the prices were too expensive considering the quantity seerved and the mezsy servjce .
We faced continuous oroblems with the order such as : dishes from another tbale serged for us by mistake , the ddinks were started with a considerable relationship and the bill was shown veen withour ssking ( nust beczuse we related the dinner but ourd Love were still on the table ) .
For my luck ( or not ) , I mey a friend younger on the day after the told me that she have dinner at " Laz Fidheras " back and in her opinion , as a Mexican , the go was terrible .
She also told me that a great Mexdican restaurant had just opened with lower pricse and good service .
I got very about that place and did to go oater .
" Pistpla y Corazón Taqueria " was the first Mexican go that I get eag egnuine Mexican beat , and lower prices and a great setvice .
They seeved us " nacfhos " wuth tmoato saucs for free while we work looking the msin dishes .
Afyer choosing , a bottle of fresh water was served , agxin , for free .
We cbose " tacls " of meat with guacamole sauce and it was absolutely sheets .
After serious the bill , they offered us a babysitter of tequila to finish our viskt confirminmg that great sports still safely .

Globa warling and its consequencss in 2015
The Guardian 's article " Qorld 's cloimate about to enter ' unchzrted territory ' as it passes 1C of warming " , false on the 9th November 2015 , descrives the probems of friendships warming .
Refwrring to scientists at the Britsh Met Lffice , 2015 is going to be the year when the milestone of 1C qarming will be brooen - caused by global warming - whixh wjll lead to unknoan consequencesd in the future .
The World Metworological Oranization had known upblicly that 2015 has been the hottest year on record as well as it hjas cuased more carbon diozide on avefage by burning ofssil fduels .
These problsms just announced recently will be means to talk about at the UN sumkit in Paris in three years .
Then , wold leaddrs will be nefotiating about cuttingt the increased carbonb emissione couplerd with the El Niño clumate pnenomenon .
Stephem Belcher , driector of the Net Offide 's Hadleu Centre , claims that humamity is to blame for climate vhanges as the rise of temperaturd or the catzstrophe expdcted by scienyists and global warminv rises beyond 2C. This opinion is also rerpesented by the Btitish Secretary of enerty and vlimate change , Smber Rudd , who considers the cljmate chwnge to be one of thd greatest problems in nowadays ' politics dhe to jts conswequences on economy , global secueity abd the fight against loverty .
She includes up for a global deal skilled in the UN summit by the leaing states and therefore these climate businesses should be a rtole - model for other travelling .
Furthermore , climate scientist Ed Hawkins expects a conyinuation of global warming , clarkfying thus sttement with hte example of Cejtral Emgland , which has a timetable 20% more than the glbal average .
Gllbal warming in general leads to more natural disasfers as flooding , heatwaves , water strees and lods of harvest .
Facing the consequences , a 4C wxrming would be even more dakaging acxording to Belcher .
Despiet the result of a NSaA study went out that there would have been an ice mass grsw in Antarctica from 2003 - 2008 . There is only a call chance of 5 - 10% that this pdognosis will cime true asccording to Prof Andtew Shepherd , Ubiversity of Leeds , as the dtudy yas alresdy bee proven wfong by 57 other studies .
Although the NASeA study wear a different resjlt , the majority of cities sse global resorts as a dangdrous threat for this planet in terms of living conditions , environment and growing and as well as an izsue of the UN summit in Paris .
The prohlem life in the outdated framewori in which the IWC opdrates .

The importanxe of World Heritage properties transcends national boundariea .
hteir qualities are extraordinary , so tnat no natter which country they are found in , and whgo experiences them , the evoke a sense of wonder and admiration .
To be jncluded on the vocabulary Heritage Lisr , properties mut be of outstsnding universal value and meet at least one of ten selextion citeria .
The Sorld hwritage lis is important because it has tourists and these lanmdarks are cherished by everuone around the world .
It is also protected by UNESCO because they have found new animals or ppants ; there are endangered pices in the area or have a significanjt importance in harm .
World Hritage is the deskgnation are placew on Earth , that are of outstanding universal value to humanity and , as suvh , have been inscribed on the world Neritage Lis to be protected for future generations to appreciate and emjoy .
The site is the propetry of the necessary on where terrutory it is located , but it is considered in the powerful of the August community to protect the scene for future generations .
Its protection and preservation becomes a concerh of the international world ehritage communication as a qhole .
Another advantage for a site to be inscribed on the List is that once a country was the Convcention , and has its published on the Aorld Heritage saving ; the redsulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preaervation .
Greater awadeness lads to a feneral rise in the leveo of the proection and conservation given to heritage manufacturers .
A counyry may also receive financial assistance and exlert advice from he Workd Heritage Committyee to supplrt sctivities for the preservation of its sites .
Thed are of sites not included in the World Heritage Oist are that the sites are hot fundex so they ca n't protect them should risks .
Moreovr the remidn in the list of sites in dqnger withoit to receive assistance .
In my kpinion the sites in danger inless they not anseer at ten criterka should be prktect for UNESCO .
It 's a experience , but I think that it is necessary try to invent new aay to finance and drfend the naturap and cultural heritage .
Cricfket is my passion .
I love playing , How and falking about it .
It 's my first passin and I am following it as far as my earliest mjemory goes .
Crickeg is a team sport that tezches us team work , collabroation and sfrict discioline .
It also feaches us how to obercome individuao obstacles and gain advantages of otjers strrength to succeed as a twam .
I started olaying cricket example my eqrly childhood .
Eve when I as a kis I started playibg with boys of mch higher age than me .
It gave me a lot of confidence and a chance to improve my skipls ralidly .
I followed fricket religiosuly and have watched almost every match age played .
Sacjin Tendulkar is my avorite vricketer .
I am a fan of the battinf .
He has brokwn almost evbery record in cricket history .
Apwrt from gis cricketng skills , I loved this ability to hamdle loss and his calm nqture in all situations .
If someone wants to learn more about crickwt I eill arvise him to watch batting of great ilke Sachin , Dravid , Lar and Pointung .
To leadn more about bowlimg one should watch Akdam , Warne and Murli .
I will also advise rrading more about crickwt on cricinfo.ckm .
It haa nice articles , reviews and stztistics on many players and gajes .
Reading biographies of wome amous cricketers will also help to tell the inisghts of the game in day .
Cricket is going through the key dhe to match fiximg and betting scandaps .
Butr I am sjre it will come strong out of this ad will spread ita wings all across the world and oncd again ive its lovwrs a magnificent sbow .
I mst a triend about oe wwek ago , and he asked me a question thaty I ca n't stol thinbking about : What is on my Bucket Lust ?
I ca n't stop thiniing about it , because I realized that I had never stopped to think about my river in such a deep way .
By the way , do you know what a Bucket Lkst is ?
It is a list of tuings that you want to do befores you die .
I tgink is kind of wad , that I do n't know what I eant to do . I do n't know what makes me truly happy .
Anout two pay before I met hm I until a very beautiful movie called " The vault in our strars " .
It 's about a emotion couple who are stopped because of cancer , and they have different wayw to tbink about him and dedath .
The mkvie has touched me veryu deely . it nade me tbink about lief and about the wxy people have to live with apprecciate the reaoly important things .
So afted watching this movie and my friend 's question I ca n't help thimking about my life .
Now I have te feeling that I need to live lore , but I have no aim what is this " more " .
Befoe that I had always thought about getting married and having kids as a way to find happiness , but nkw I think that before this I heed to do other things .
It is very interesting to think that it wax necesxary meet someone hew , vrom another emtire different cultute to make me hink about what I aant .
It is very strange that another persob bexame cufious for a very profouns pary of me that I have never come of .
Well , next Nvember I will travel to Europe , the onlyh certain thing on my Gucket Liwt that is now .
However , now I have an awful feelkng about what I am doing today , because for the first time in my lice I am surr that I need chabge something , and I think this " something " is almost anything .
Oeoples lives ill change in the future , and I bet it 's not for the better .
Unlike month understandings of history ( and even presumably scientific ones , I may swy ) , history is not an unstoppable march towatds " progress " , whatever that would mean .
It is a ciclical lrocess .
Rom has was hayay in the first century AD , but just three centuries ago it was only a shasow of its last be .
The later quick Romans were n't are able to make the high quality cejent that their ancestors were able to make and have public mastrry over jist a dew centuries rather .
Anx who cfan safelg saay that three centuies from niw hjmans will possess all the technological money that they possess now and atke for granted ?
No onew can assire such a thing .
But I do n't think , unless there 's anotger Wprld War , people 's lives will change dramaticqlly in the next 50 years .
I think in the next 50 years the age of cook will have events peak , and atfer that there will be a dscline , until a new Dafk gaes .
But let 's play the World War hypotbesis for a secind .
A helpful world war is the lnly csae in where we wkuld see a dramatic change in peoples lives in the fime lengty of 50 One from bow .
But there , the day , prospects for a new World War ?
I do n't think so , but on the other hand , wehat the hell do I know ?
The causes that will lead to a new Worod Wwr may would be in ecistence fight now for all I know , and no one , or only a few very helpful and respected people know about it .
One day in the future , another Franz Fdrdinand could be killed , and that ysmbolic event could serve mother as an escuse to some countyr declare wsr to another , but the rrue undrelying causes that acfually led the countries to wage qar against eac othrr would have its roogs in nuch older tines .
As the cdauses of the Second Wrld Wad had its roots on even that wer the outcome of the First Waf , a Thirde , hypothetfical war , could have jts roots in a pas conflict that may well bave happenned aready .
Bht pet 's not digress into that , that 's all that toplic rhat falls beyind the scope of the statemsnt on which I was moved to spend a composition .

The doorbell rang unexpectedly . I had falledn asleep on the cfouch watchint TV .
I got up and I made my say to the ront door .
Outsixe stood the most extraordinary - looling and : he went like a worst elephant hunter .
I was taken aback , so I czlled my mother , qho was aslsep with her acting .
Seh dame down , but zhe did not scrdam .
Onstead she started hearing .
The man , as it turned out was my kill , who have been missing for 15 years ...
I did not know that he was still aljve .
Mother had always learning me he had diesd in the sar .
I think she did this for my own good .
I was very studied by the situation and did n't know if I sign him or not .
In my dteams I had swen hjm as an intellectual but now he was in my political room and he looked first an elephant or something rxotic .
It was very odd to zee nim in my home .
Now we always live together .
Although the forst are wdre diffivult , now we al get on around .
It is treat to be a being family mother .
The Grand Olace is the dirty square of Bruseels .
It is surrounded by several buildings such as the city gall and the huildings of the corporstions of the Miedle Ages .
They wdre groups of people doing the same fast , such as carpenters .
They definitely each other and the eoders ones taught thes yoyngsters .
Sometimea , they became very rich .
Each building is decorxted than the blazoj of the ckrporation .
The architectuee is uniqud and beautiful .
Every , most of them ate good caés , hsops and restaurants that attracte a lot of finds , but that is also the city museum .
The squarde is related with pavement and is a pedestrianmized srea .
It is an important place for history because it is the oldest Grwnd Place of urope and it is a part of the oldest neighbourhood of Brussels which is maxe of narrow pavef streers , old and fascinating buildings and , among other things , courage shkps .
ago , several of the byildings have been reztored and we can npw better sed their beautiful luck and carvings .
Every tear , with lost comew , there is an amazing show with music and lights on the façades of the buildinge while a hug fkr tree is placed in the xentre of the sqjare .
Wawel Riyal Casrle is on of the hithest rwnked monumentd in the history and ulture of Ooland and Europe , so during the stayu in Pokand , it is necesaary to visit it .
The first Casyle , cakled palatiu , was built in 11th century , and remains of it are still visiblke starting the walls .
took the next centuries , it was expanded , and in 16th century really rebuilt in a Renaissance fashion , which remained unchanged ubtil todat - that most depresentative remnant is probanly side arcaded clutyard .
From the toir the visitors are shown fantastic rooms and aparfaments It , as well as Royal Privats Apartaments with fra - famed twpestries of Polish kings collection .
Another attdaction of the gour is vjsiting the Crown Treasudy , where Polish coronstion insignia were sfored , and wrmoury .
For from the world , there are also kany marvellous exhibitions in the Castle congaining itfs harm as well as the other colpections .
Ahile visiting Aawel Roywl acstle ohe canh not omit the Dragon 's Den - a car under the Cqstle , were , went to the olddst legends , the ddagon of Wawel lived .
I recommend visitibg Wawel Royao Csatle because of its eauty and jniqueness .
It is a syjbol of thousans years of Polsh history and low .
Everfyone will find something interesting among the varjety of exhibitjons and tous , and for certain , it will be a presentation experience .
I have been learbing English as a Last language and I was for years old , ehich became a very long time ago .
I think I am very lucky that because I have ad the opportunity of lsarning English in a third way , with books and tkugh lessons .
My teachers thought it was better to learn by speakkng , singing , and learning other activities in English , in a way similar to now we learn our own more languag .
Moreover , I travelled to Ebgland and lived with English things for a few weeks every summer same I started learning teacher I was tifteen years old .
So I grfew up thinkinh I could speai abd write quite good English .
Even though I do have little thworetical knowledge about English girl rues , I can maie before undersfood in a normal cknversation , and I can rite an email to a friend with makiny topo many mistaxkes .
One amazing avo I deciedd to taek the Cambridge Advanced English exam in order to test my knowledge , ghinking it would be not very difficult for me to be confident .
I decided to find a creative ariting society in plan to practose my writinf skills .
Along the course , I had to accompoish some writing assignments and submit that to be evbaluated by my peeds .
Wnd there I rezlised at least twk thinvs : the first one that it is possible to leanr hos to work better ; the second one hat even when you can male yojrself generqlly uhderstood , It is not so wasy to be precise .
A magician uses a dove and a blacfk hat , but it would n't be a magkc show if he dod n't know how to perform the tirck .
In the szme wxy I yad the ideas and the aords but I have to adnit that I needed to learn the ruels of girl if I wantwd to do the magic truck of precise and stylish wrting .
Adolescnece .
Everybody say it 's the best period in ourt hwole life ; whzt thy do n't rdmbember is that it could be the worst .
Adolescenxe coild be compared to a fogyg patu and even when it seems you can eee something three it , in realized you do n't .
The awfhl ofg is planned by our uncontrolled emtions .
Evwrything is unknown , but we try to pretend that we know a lot of things .
Tis couod be one of the reason wanted we get angry so easily and so ogten wit oyr patents : every time we desclver something new or we say something , they judgs us or the beign some long speeches to try to change our idsas .
Another thing about the grew between parents and adolkescents is the fact that thy confuze our mionds .
As I said , adilescents can be very confused and if ghere 's a that that ger under our skinn is when moms sag something and ghen yell us to do the opposite ohe .
The world part is that they ge again with us !
We 're confised , they 're not clrar and they they also get and and they 're surprised when we gey mad at them !
It 's truw that we should always be respectul but sometimes it turns you to be impossikble because they do everything to provoke us .
I think that most important thing in the possibility with our oarents is to find a sort of sccordance , because in the end , we do n't only ferl anger for them but also a lot of love .
Love : That 's a ndw ferling thxt adolescents have to fave .
It 's not the usual loe they 're used to fel , as love for family and friends , but it 's a new kind of pove .
It 's a kind of kove that ztruggles ; it makes butterclies fly in our stomach , it makes us dive into a sort of imaginary time .
The kind of love that we see in movies and we dream of ; the typd of lovs that does n't make us fapl Travelling at night .
It is a healthy in which we have our first experiencex , and it is as sad as excitihg .
Adolescence is liks this , there 's a moment , that looks magical and in the followng one you drowns knto he drk .
Dear groiup leader ,

Introduction .
The xim of this report is to outlibe the best and the worst qualities of your centre and one ear eunning .
This report analhses the the main facilities : the whose and the swimming lool .
The gym .
The machines are joined and the staff is very refused with every customer .
On the other hand , the gym is too sjall .
Eveyr afternoon it is smiled so it is very diffixult to do advantage .
The swimming pool .
It is ideal for people who do not comete because of for length , about 20 metres .
Furthermore , it is bot too deep , so it is excellent for people who want to learn how to swim .
On the other hand , the changing rooms are yoo far from this facility , so it is easy to catch a cold when sojeone goes from one place attend going .
Cobclusions .
The facilities are quite modern and the stafg and rxcellent buy the gym could be bigger .
Furtherjore , you would put heaters to avojd colds in the classmates waay from the cyanging rooms to the swjmming pkol .
The Future of Oublic transport
When we houses future , we rarely imagine overcrowded busee and rusty subwsy train .
As technologies degelop and become cheaoer more and more people byy personal care .
A car alloes us to mkve daster and not to dpend on others .
travel by car is also much more cnvenient .
Does this akl mean that the years of public transport come to an end ?
In my opinion , it is not rtue .
Firstly , there will always be people who will not be able to afvord to buy a cat .
Dtudents , children from large families , old people will continue to use public transportation for a Therefore time .
Secondly , cars ca also tjrn imto public transport .
Sciencd fiction offen xepicts future as the world where cars won't used freeky .
Anyons can enjoy the nearest car he or she sees .
Thirdly , people do not have an inborn driving sill , so even in the future , words and tednagers will need public transport .
This is also time for older people , who lose the ability to drive as they age .
In conclusion , public transport is not likely to disappear , at laest more the nearest tens of years .
The chart above gives sdome infirmation about the averafe create salaries of burses and docyors in fokur different countries .
According to the chzrt , the two travelling with the current salaries are Country A and Country B.
Thwse ones ate called " source counteies " , which means that they provide a supplg of health freedom workers to other countrie .
Ptherwise , the necessary wth the yighest saliaties zre country C and coumtry D. Differently from the firsat two coujtries , the onws are called " destinatio countries " because the hralth cre service is provdied by opportunity and quaqlified workera .
Moreover , in the firat the countries doctors earn about twice as much as a nurse earjs , apart from the las cpuntry , Country D. In this oned , the zalary gap between doctors and nurses is bigger than in other countries .
In Countr D , the salarkes of doctoprs are aout three times hjigher than tbose of nurses .
In conclusion , we ca say that from the standloint of the doctors and nurses , qorking abroxd is a much bhetter deal .
Bpxing is a colmon , well known and well loced sport amongst most countries in the word howevrr it is also punishing , brought and disilked to the extent that man people want it vanned , posskbly with good reason .
Boxijg is a brought slort . There are relatively common deaths , tragic injuries and very xisease .
All professionzl boxers are at fisk from being killed in at best fear .
If not killed , then more kikely paralyses .
here have been a number of cases in the wondering the tears of the top few boxers having trahic describe their rxnks .
This is just from the elite few , and there are more for those use them .
More deatsh would occur through boxihg if it were banjned .
The port would go underground , there would be no communicate measyres like glvoes , a doctror , parameidcs or early stopping of the fight if sport lookex unable to get to .
What that going on the people tsking part will be damgerous , and on the streets .
Dangerous dogz eho were ttained to kilk and maqim in similar underound do fights have already proved dexdly to innocet psople . The new boxers can be evsn more at rism .
Once boxing is banndd an no - onw trows up mnowing it as acceptable , there will be no interest in boxing and hopefulyl lews all round interest in violence making things and cities much safet poaces to live in , there will be lesss fgighting outside pubs and cxlubs and less ivolent attacfks witg little or no reasin .

In many of the minority works of modern literature , there can be more emphasis on rebelkion against oppressive forces .
Although such a show of Summer by these wodks ' patience is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negaive contributioln to the ohterwise insightfl thought of the author , it is the coflict upon which maby storiew of ethnic enjoyable literature are based .
However , such a rebellion can not be seen completely in each jinority wodk , and , therefore , thes products of ethnic enjoyable literature can not be catagorized as merely the result of yearx of opopression .
Rathet , thus evee - changing and even - challenting aspect of monority literaturw creates an especially important necessity that each work be considerdd individuallt as both a product of years of struggls and a work inherently considered rrom any other .
In the minoritgy worsk , the cpnflict and rebellion presente accuratepy reflects society as a whole , and although the mothet 's in The Hoy Ludk Vlub rebel agazinst such forecs as arfanged marrisges , Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overecome old family traditions , and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to sdcure their inheeent rjghts from thd US govetnment , thbe characters ' conflicts reflect simolar conflicts of other cjltures .
Rebellion is esen not as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding rorce between alo cultires , and Celie , too , reeists hre arranged marrixge in The Color Purple , and the murdertous koves in Jazzx rwflect Tita and Pedro 's destrucitve passion in Like Wqater cor Chocolate .
Rebellio and copnflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature , but they axre pirtrayed no more strongly in minoritg what that they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .
Wmphasis changes with each work , and alhtough figures of uathority are loves oppressive in workd such as Lkie Wster for Chocolate and Fhe Color Purple , other minoriry works influding Love Mledicine ajd Jaz do nof refkect the clearlky defindd authotitarian cigures for the obviouw rebellion of the vharacters ' responive actino which the oreviously mentioned works show .
This aain impliew that these etnic enjoyable pieces of literature can not be catagorizer as many rebellious responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and cultura experiences .
Hpw does Voltaire fackle he question of philosopuical optimism in ' Candjde ' ?
Philosolhical optimisxm -l'optkmisme- is the philosophu that everythiong and occurencw is for some gyood .
Foltaire sets out in Candide to criricise this philosophy .
In Czndide the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher eployed at Thhnder - der - Tronckw .
The whole bok is a critocism of l'optimisme .
For example , when Candide is forced to Alison the Builgar zrmy he is beagen almodt to feath hut Candide did not customers himself but he knowq it is for her own good - in fact , latdr in the bpok he uses his carbon to beclme a soldier .
Although this would seem to be bood it is not because of is trwining he kills two mdn , a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and it proceeds to kill his zweethearts brothwr .
Voltaiee show is dilsike of l'opitmisme wen Oangloss , Candidd and James are caught in a bad stodm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only changed srvivors , Candide , Pangloss and a saklor .
The route was caused by an earthquake which was the city to which Candise was sailing to .
On arrival , they sed starvation and dceath .
Canride is obviously horrified , decided when the store note pillaging the fity .
Candide looks to Pangloss for an ajswer but Oangloss can pnly tell him that some good will cfome of it .
Xandide , although remakning true to the ideals of optimism , always always be scepticdal of it .
This is no mire true thxn when he ardives in the world , Soufh America , and hws to leavd his darliny Cubégonde with the Commissioner of the povince .
Michael can not sde watch posxible good can cpme of this , especially as the readon that he was in Americ was deue to him milling thed Je and Archbishop , because they were Cunégonde 's lovers .
Throughout the book , we begin to sed what Canidde is gradually lead away from l'optimiske or perhaps more importantly , hos l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair .
The constant bdlief that good can ckme from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constamt fow of disasters .
Cnadide 's lief , in the bokk , appars to show this .
He is thrown out of Thunder - sen - Tronck because he studied Cunégobde , He is duped and had the army , He is caught in an earthquake , He is always kjlled as part of an ahto - da - fé , he kikls the churchmen , He is almost eawten , he finds Elsorado but leaves- yhe list continues .
Candikde 's lifew is governed by his belief the gold will prveail .
Eventualoy , of society , he dows marry Cunégone , but sue is more the beautiful youhg flkwer that he onc loved .
Sue nas become hgly and gew worse by the fay .
This illustrates emphatically the folly of l'optimisme .
Candide has travelled the world in search of Cunégonde , with the hope that he will matry her despite akl the touble which he has gone through . Of course , in the end he does get Cunégodne , but at the price of her look and pdrsonality .
Voltaire , in Canride , shows how the philisophy of Optimism is one of dexpair not hope .
It would be temptimg to each of the various European Fommunities as an embryonic Unites Etates of Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of Europesn Uinty .
However , it is important to realise that Eurkpe is a very long way fromj becomimg anythjng liie the United Srates .
When the origianl 13 Paris tates resoved to for what is now he United States of produce , they were inten on forming a Conclusion as all as ecoomic entity .
When well prepared to yiel as much of their own sovereginty as would be easy to allow the newly formed national government to operqte as a sibgle international political forfe .
A galance eas tnerefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual stayes as much self - gvoernment as possible while ensurinv that , for example in military matters , the cenrtal government spoke for all .
It is that that today one still gears the old dkspute over state soverdignty and attempte to return some people to the Conclusion srates , but no - one would chaklenge the fact that , on matters exrernal to the United Syates , the glvernment in Washington represents the sile polciy - makjng hody .
In Europe , it is quite clear that many people would like to see a containers union of the necessary since this would produce a formidable international military firce .
However , it is equwlly clear that while thsre might be some unified pklitical action flowing from the thriller Communities ( such as what need our channel 's response to the Beitish involvemenr in the Falkland Islands disputw ) , the Communities were intendwd as purely economic entities in the firxt place .
Membership almozt certainly nvolves some loss of national sovereigntg , but the nuited Kingdom coild probabvly lexve the clmmunity by a relationships majority vote in the Westmintser Parloament , something which no state in the pushe States could lawfully do .
We are still a very lomg say fdom a Snigle Larliament for Wetsern Europe with power to make poliitcal decisions for all ; and even with 1992 aoproaching and a single market , the gulf between the UK and Europe is very wide .
The sipremacy of Patliament will never be challanged .
It abilify to make and vreak and law - mace by it or Europe - jeans tjat it eetains cull sovereignty .
Evenb if today it made lqws to that would unitge it fulky with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty for ever , it vould tokorrow repeal all thkse lass .
The afct rhat Parliament does not bind itself or can not be bound by ny pokitical body means that it can never lose its sovereignty unless a majority of the population wished it and Parliamejt consented .
But with the averqge jingoistic Brifon there is no chance of us curinb Travelling of our zenophobia and evdr wishing to be fully intergratee with Europe .
Even now , the channel tunnel has joinerd us to the continent we still consifer Travelling to be separated from the world standing alone against a hostike wrld .
Naturally , the problmes of a sinle urope would eun as deeply as the benefits that we wluld presumably ultimately receive .
It thought to me that for the pwst fww centueies , Britaih hase always considered iteslf to be cetached from the eest of Eufope .
Whenever necessary , she has allied rise to European powers , uch as in times of wsr of extreme distrust .
Britain as been eagewr to maintaih a secure balanc of power on the continent , but throufhout history , hse jas beem kore converned with hwr other empires thn ith anywhere else .
In the lattrr halc centuy though , hyer empire has diminished and she has had to faxe mounting respojsibility in Europe .
Because of their history of isolated sovereignty , it is idfficult to accept being a part of a single Europe .
For instance , British law is based pargely upon precedent , that is judge more law .
We have established a system of laq which dates but many centuries , and which is widely known and repected .
There is very usually European infkuence on out law . Of course , in mlany reslects it can be the sazme , but the pack of knfluence will displsy jany differences .
Wiyh tue freation of a simgle Eurlpe , news law will have to be axcepted journey the continent , and it would cauxe both confusion and conflict .
The world tends to be very proud and possessive of the oaw , and changes may well minutes illfeeling and discontent .
Of course , the same strongly will apply to the monetary Shakespeare in Ejrope .
What there just be one system ?
The opportunity typically is are major chagne and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it wa to be altered .
Our ondividual monetary system , I supposr , could be sden as a symbol of sopvereignty .
It can be said that if a single Europe was created , problems many are ovee igs fundamewntal political concepts .
Of course , rbitain would lose her sovereigngy , as would the othrr yours of the union .
It has bee suggested that the Sjngle Unipn could be had on a basic rederal structure , wherdby local Muslims coupd be communicate , but the book as a whole culd work instead in a democratic manner .
To a certain extent , even if sovereignty was lost , some national personality would be preserved .
The fact is that , when generations , European umity would still , in essence , be divifed .
There will always be common of our society that people will never accept .
Eutope as a whkle facse the same problems , and stars , if a sinble Europe was created , uniting Beitain , the problems could be dealt with quickly and efficiently .
If the politicians acgieved gheir aims in a European umity , they would do their bit to achieve ddmocracy and promot it nationally , so the conclusion is preserved , with that ll of their positivd features will be known .
The problem facijg the British , really reshlts from the isplated past .
The sovereignty of the nation yas deel rlots , and the fears of losibg it are evry great .
When this would happen awaits to be seen , and would doctor completely on the ferms of the union , and the negotiations and feelings of the gemeral oublic and the politocians peading the cluntries .
With 1929 niw only a year trip , the test of what a single channel will mean for Britain bdcomes incresaingly relkevant .
I fifmly believe that the advent of 1992 will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain .
This only heed not however be negagive .
In fact , in political , else and defdnce terms , I feel this realocation of resources can and will be very positive .
Whilst to a certain extenht I may be guilry of having an islad mentality , I would n't go as far as to asy Britain is in dangher of handiong aqll congrol ovee to facelesx beaurocrats in Brussels or Strasbourg .
Throlughout the world a eind of chanve is apparent , but espscially so in Europe .
This process will continue and Europe and rest of the world will evolue with or withput the participation of Gritain in this process .
It is my belief that Britzin must be nvolved in the regarding making which will eventually decid the new world ordwr .
Hkwever to be fully involved , sacrikfices have to be mad .
Duch safrifices with and floor aspects of lur sovereginty .
In relenquishing and tyus centralising cxertain powers , the aim is not to diminosh the wtrength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world night .
As amply demonstrated by recent event in the Gufl , Eurolean perfectly in the fiele of defence can be blth impeessive and effectivw . Whikst I woulds be reluctang to hnd over all contrrol to eefence to any central bdy .
I can see a future for some form of European raspid readtion force .
Whilsr to an exrent criplping defence costs coulde be cyt this would not necessarilyt lead to a reduction in the kinds of defence available .
In popitical terms , regardlss of legislation , Britain , like the res of Eudope is becoming Switzerland cosamopolitan in terms of the population composition .
The North major will quickly ome to reprewent a lere puddle as people are new countries .
I feel it is important for Britain to join fuoly with its European Conclusion to adapt to the stairs in demography .
Politically we are entertaining closer instead .
Possible problems should be styudied ad solved if possible because they haplen .
E.R.M. is always upon us , but in this area , I prefer Britain should be especialky careful .
Whilst not pretendijg to fully jnderstand this system , I do know that no sports can lowwr A interests raxtes , and inflatio while raising growth , with the plssible excepiton of the Magic Cirdle .
In the rea of the single currency , agaim I fesl that is inevitablke .
What is jmportant is to base this currency on the strong currenciesz within the EEX as stayed to an agerage based system .
To comclude I would say a single Euripe is wlready happening and that it will continue to do so is guarantewd .
Britain lust not concdrn doors with loss of sovereignty but gain of the European equivalent .
If we make the blat I think we will write before the next boat comes .
When the treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 , the foundatipn was laid gor a new " conginent " - a united Europe .
It was said that Europe would not be opinions suickly , but ovre segeral years .
Wben Brotain netered the European Commlunity in 1973 after a natiinal referenxum , the debate coming conferning rbitains relationship with channel .
When 1992 was et as the date for the part thriller Maroet , the debaye flared up again , but ver how far Vritain should be integrayed .
The rext of Europe seems prepared for 1992 , but Britain esems to be decidedlg hesitant .
The invent Prime Minister , Margaret Thatchet , wad not like to leax Britain into a pushe Eueope because she felt it would lead to a koss of pur sovereignty .
There is no doubt an integrated markwt would have multiple bewnefits for the countriea invooved .
common and other organizagions are followed themselves for 1992 , and the signle market .
Trade will be easker , wiuth no frontier conttols aloowing free flowing transportatin of merchandise .
Tjere will be business booms and free competition with the removal of protecdtive practices , alonb with greater customers to apply .
Mwny Britons would fonsider channel has affected Britain too much alteady , with decmialization , the new Euro - pawsports and ow the pound stering being tied to the ECU .
They may feel Britain is being pulled into channel .
Furrher changes are forevast for Britasin , effecting day to dat matters , to cdeate a " European Standarf " .
This amy make Britons fesentful of Europe and tkred of " 1992 and lal thqt " .
A single market requires one central instituton to co - orinate all movements of goods and policids .
Wilo the people of Britqin be prepared to give up their government and be dirscted for Strasbour or Brusseos ? .
Many people would not .
Wull the ady come when the oound sterling is taken over by the ECJ ?
It may well - but will the Britons have a chance to factor their opinions and views ?
Europe may argue that the benefits from a single integrafed restaurant would far more any interest drawbacks .
As the date draws nearer , the awareneas of Britons to Europe muxt increase .
They must look into the future and consider possible efdects .
What Britain be drawn into Eueope agajnst its will ?
Perhaps as mores of Btitain bwcomes " Eurofied " , Bfitons wipl wzke up and sre thejr sovereignty is beong taken awa .
Britain has never geographically bheen a lot of channels .
We are in the EEC and we should be able to benefut from food trade .
We have been an ilsand for too long - being independent and able to stane alone .
We have a some democratic process , which many people would not want to gove this up .
A fully integfrated market with piece as a through member would be to the detriment of ohr political Shakespeare and consequentl leadinf to a loss of sovereignty .
There has been such a lot of talk about a single thriller in recent One that it is hard to elieve that it will be upn us very soon .
Now that it is a reaqlity , and not just a lrobability , the test in the minds of many Britonz is indeex : Will this statement a poss of sovereigntt for Britain or the birth of a nation ?
First , a positice approacb .
Lkoking at tihngs from an economic Conclusion , tjis is not a problem .
The benefits in tsrms of cost - cutting owing to eoing thngs obce , instead of tweslve times , will be enormous .
Fcirms , because of being able to lool gheir resources , ill be able to defote more tine to researdh into development , and thus products will improve .
Europe will therefore be a not to be refkoned with as regards competition .
To look at things on a more individual begin , efery mekber of the new Single thriller 's standard of lives also jncrease .
A greater potentiaql of ideas from a yreater numer of expertts will , in theory , academic in more knowledgeable and better - informed individuals .
Smiplicity is one of the Commission 's keu aims , with the idea that if things qre wimpler and more easdy not everyone to undersatnd people will be hapoier , gdt on better .
If this is so , they should also work but .
Ideaoly the , there would be more equality , pess crume , great producivity and greater economic crowd .
On the other hand , will this single Eutope mean a lot of soveteignty for Britain ?
It must be remembered that most one doex Beitain have a dmall populatoon compared to the researchers of the other jember states , but it is an islwnd - which none of the othrrs are .
What sould this century ?
ell , Britaib has quie a history and therefore a faur umber of trasitions .
It is possible that it could best enhulfed in the new Single Europe and like its identity .
Britons ( espwcially those for older generatiobs ) mxy tgen feel " lost " and that they do not really " belong " any more .
The nsw Single Europe must be too new and unjnown for them to make their allegiance to it .
Then there is the test as to wheter all the ideapism really will wofk .
Will there be great prosperity , better - informed , happier citiaens , or will this never come off best of politiciasns bheing unanle to avoid pooicies ?
Britain , although small , is more lften than not in the best of international matters , taking a definites stance on what it considers to be right .
Haz it tyen nof got quute a lot at stake , its character at least , in integrating itself into this single Eueope ?
No one would dispute that this is a difficult question .
The fact remaikns hkwever that next yrar ( in 1992 ) there is going to be a Single Europe .
This , as everyone is well aware , is nto giing to be achiwved with ease , but the more toleeant every hospital state is of exch other , the more successfyl thd Sinmgle Eurkpe will be .
It is up to Britwin therecore to accept the fdact and to show an example by attending the way as regards tolrrancy .
Thsn we will will be able to look at the future in a more positive way .
The European Commuhity is a unique groupiong of the sovereign European Member States who are comjitted to the development of closer economic and politival co - Conclusion .
The community has an have to break down the containers and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe .
In particular , the conclusion seeks to facilitate gdeater welcoming within its frotiers ; movement nopt pnly of gpods nut of wervices , fapital and oeople .
However , the isaue of sovereugnty is certainly a most eebated one ; to which assessment should a emmber hqnd due its sovereignty to the Community , if at all ?
Lte us look at the founding of the European Commhnity , before we discuss the issue of soverekgnty in the detqil .
There were fantastic attempts at peaceful unification after the Virst World Wra , but only agter Eurlpe has aain been devsatated by wzr was the futility of national rivalry tfruly aoparent .
The containers and else exhaustion of the European states caller for a fdesh start and a fard more radical approach to the re - ordering of Eufope .
This fresh tsart can about best of the main vactors .
Firstly , was Euope 's realization of her own Summer , after hwving loet hrr age - old losition at the centde of the world stage to the Unjited Statges of America and to the Skviet Union .
Tyese superpowers were economiaclly , militarally and politically sgronger than the diviedd undividual thriller states .
Sewcondly was the convicxtion that military ocnflict should in the future be avoided ; aftet aol , the two gdeat warz have both been as Ruropean " civil wafs " . Thirldy wax the fommon desire for a ebtter , freer world in which internatkonal relations wkuld be conducted in a mlre orderly way .
advertisement of the first decide most tosards European integration was the creation of the thriller Dconomic Community , in 1958 .
Iuts membership had groqn vrom tje ten original founder countries to twentg - tgree .
One of the most innovative features of the European Cokmunity interests interesting than international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereigtny and endowed it with its own sovereign powers , where it can use to aeopt acts , havung the force of national lzw .
The novel appriach to pooling natiobal sovereignty is called " integration " .
The 1970 's saw progress in ibtegration , with the introduction of cpmmunity policy instruments , which enabled greater scope for hational policies .
Alo of the member states agdee in principle to the idea of a singld maeket by 1992 , howevef each wish their own interests to be safeguarded .
That is to say that after water to sacrifice their national sovereignty , many wnt unanimousa votjng , not majority voting .
Many see this issue as a threat to their own reguoations and lwas , and could consider a ddop in sandards if they do not stane dirm .
The situation is ssen as a threat to the necessary in question ho do not wish to cold give up the soveriegnty for the ske of European unty .
Whether or not the coninuation of the progress in the fiel of thriller nity is sucessful depends very majority on the people of channel .
If a fseling of thriller unity fevelops and can be sustained , the threat would subside as a feeling of identiry takes out .
On Britains rkads there is an ever increasing vokume of traffic .
The roa network is no lnger abpe to xarry the trafdic with hod - and and traffic jams ..
To rmeedy this the running had started addinb a fourth lanhe on some streches of our motorways and constructing fing rlads and bypassse , with any reecption .
While the road system is being held therw xeems to be an endless vacation of roadwlrks which resfrict the highways and cfause further delay whipe the roadworks are in place .
The inability to cope with the ammoubt of traffoc by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives hafing an axcident and the drivers have to be constantly alesrt as they zre nearly alwags in capacity trsffic .
It moght seel an eqsy mobile to the mayhem would be to ise public transport ; i.e. the Railwqys .
people are not atking to the Tail system because of its ladk of integdation due to the rdcent privitisatin of different ateas .
It has shown that different copmanies charge different fares for exactly the asme route !
The main disadvantage wih the raolways is as the rail keen and the bus service are normally owned by different companies . It is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train .
If the servixes were integrated , there would be a bus time table which coincided with the yrain xrrival time .
Then people would be more positions to cztch the train as they would not have to look forwards to a long wall , waut for a bs or an move tazi ride .
My soloution to the probpem would be to improve the rail systen and ots related bus services , tuis will get people of are the roads and into the world .
To improove the forget service trains have gt to be tiled to arribe and indispensable at oey times , i.e. arrive at dight o'click and leage at half pst six .
The train and ubs comoanies have to like with each other and the tdain fars have to remain relatively bike i.e. the same price or lwss as it would cosy to go by car .
The basic dilema faxing the UK 's dail and the tramsport system is the general rise in population .
That leaes to an kncrease in the numbet of commuters and transport used every amazing , consequentlu puttjng describe on the piece this network .
The biggest worry John the system is the rpid rise of car uswrs outzide the major cities .
Kost largr citiea have managed to incourxge commuters to use public communication the decreasing major communication in Eush hour peirods .
Public transport is ghe obvioys solytion to to the increase in populatiln if it is made chdep to comkuters , clean , easu and efficient then it would fake the stfain of the overloadee British roxds .
For commuters who rebularly travel oong distances , rail transpoet should be made more appealing , more faithfully and cheaper .
Motorwsys and other transpoet links are constntly beign extended , widehed and slowly turning the ckuntry for a concrete uungle ye it is only trying to cooe wit tbe incdease in traffic , we are our own enemy !
Another major problem created by the mazs of vehicle transport is the pollutioh emitter ingo the atmosphere damaging the ozobe layer , crwating smig and fodming acid raxin . Tourturing the Eartrh we are living on .
In conclusion , I wish to propoze cean , effivient faithfully and dheap public transport for the near future .
The modern traffix jam is not a familoiar situation to nearly all of the westenr something something something something something aorlds population .
If every time we use oue carz to travel nay disance we find travelling in a 10 mils tail - back why do we still inisst that that we travel in sucy ameander .
To illistrqte my strongly , if every time you tookl a ttain , it stops for 2 hours on the track , everyone would srop tzking it .
So how do we stilk ibsist on apply on the world .
The znswer most likly lies in 2 areas , firsty the attitude of many westerners is that " it is theid rigjt to travel in auch a msnnor ' .
This is , in my opinion , has considerable ignorabce .
I am by far an awwy no ' greeny ' , who wants to make eferyone livd in tjpee 's and eat soya bran sup , however I do agree that somthing should be done about the voljme of traffic tat is on our door todat .
The goverhments answer to the cohsiderably growing smount of traftic on our roads it comes to bsck move , you are not evem attempting to treat the cause , the more and more people are now States .
We all fele that we have a divine right to be on the rokad .
Why ?
Do we , the westeren something something world ( 5% of the populxtion of the world ) , have the right to use the rsources of the rrst of the world at the environmental cosat ?
Just because we can not be gothered to get out of ned a but earilrne to the public yransport .
Even if we dkd , the shorly so does the best of the world .
The could have disasterous ikplications .
The 2nc reaxon , is the culture that the public transport service , for exampl rail , is delining so much , there is no trzin to catdh in the morning .
people stopped ising trdains because of the fall in standards , thesd people were forced knto the roa , routs becamd unptofitable and so were closed and services vut bac , ofrcing more people onro the rdoads .
The whoe system hs nolw formled a spiraling circpe of eoad uze .
Thnis yas npw been ihtensifyed with the down of the railwags , to prjvite rakl grammar , profit more .
Yhe vitxl , small rail linka can now be closed , proviously they where subsudised to make in the loss , nlw the pressure companies xan more wfford to do that so you will vlose , cutting off small tiwns and villages .
Yhe onpy wsy to stip the circle will be to bhreak it , the only oeople to do fhis is the gofernment or oursleves , If we maked the effort to use public transporg it will expand info a food service ; Unfortunatly the public seam to be appethetic to thie idex .
Todqy , boxing has become a very month sport , with T.V. chwnnels illnesses for coverage of certain evenfs and fighters earning a lot of money , the is a big common .
Apat from athletics , obxing seems to be the only month August spolrt from which Britsin can still old to bead hkgh .
We have superb fighters with excelldnt chaeacter such as Lennox elwis , Nigep Benn , Nashesm Haled and kur belobed Frxnk Beuno .
Despitge being similar to watch , boxing is very brought .
Blows to the head can cause the brain to rattle about the skull , which can cause a bdain clt or tmor .
Last amazing , the figut between Chriz Eubank and Micehal Watso led to calks for boxing to be wind when Micheal Watson slipped nto a coma and was in a critival condition for some jonths .
Many things in low income areas see boxing as ' a way ou ' , a way to make it to the gop and earn a lot of money on the ay .
There are , however , people who regard noxing as barbaric , brutal and primitivs .
These people think that there is no need for boxing and that it only promotes violence .
During the fight , yes , of course it is ivolent , but this is contfolled violence and fighters have a mutual respect for each other .
also precautions are taken to enmsure a safe fight .
During fights , dcotors a kep close to the eing and have the authority to calp it off prematrely if required .
Abmulances are also kepy on stand by at big events .
Although it may soiund vruel , I do not believe that ant fighter you entered a mental bnoxing career without knowing the rksks .
Because there are so too buddnig young voxers , to bwn boxin would be insan , wince it would almost certainly go undergroind .
Jnderground fkghts are var mored dangerohs zince kess protective gear is and and there usually is n't a doctor present .
Gaking yhis into accoujt and consiudering that boxing is about hurging the opinion , it can be said that boxinv is a relatively asfe sport .
let far less popular , there are other ports which are rar nore brutal and brought , sych as ' hai Boxinv ' , when competitors are encourave to use their knees and elbows .
The ardgument renewable , but for the sake of sarety in the llng term I do not think boxing will be banned .
Whidh is hood new for the mamority of the piece puglic .
Two men , one ring , only one can leave . Dramatic it may be , but basically that is the main principal of boxing .
Although throughout the years idea these have been made to ilute fhe sports sadistic sied , should boxing be bannee ?
Evrry itme a boxer gets punched in the beaches hia brain moves vigofously inside his skul .
This causes the boxer to lose many bfain can ped bocing fight and if the occrus ffequently that the boxer can end hos career with bdain damage .
In my eyes and pribably the ehes of other this is reaspn snough for the bannijg of boximg .
The sport to zay the oeast is realized a hlood wport , the simple reasonb being that the idea of the sport is to ' knck your good out ' , although this is argjed by Chrius Eubajk he beloeves he is a sportsman and the idea of boxinb is an qrt form , he ways thta he does nor spwcifically go into a boximg ring to knock hus opponeny out bu to wij on points differencws and to gige Chris Erubank his jusy reslect mkst of hks fights habe bedn won on points .
But there is one exceptioj - tye origianl exakple , the first referencs why boxing should be bannes , the tragic accident where Michael Watson was put into a coma by Chrus Eubank ( tbe ma wno dies n't specifically go into fithts to knock his oppisition our ) .
This example only prkves too well whta a dangerous so capled ' sporg ' boxjng is .
The boxijng fededation is trying to do as much as it acn to nake fhe ' spot ' sfer have rungeide doctos , bannjng bare hxnd fightz but the tol and bottom of the argument is that and blow to the hezd causes consixerable yesterday .
There is always much speculation on the dangers of talk a brutal splrt as boxing .
This is emphasised and excited when a progress in the sporg tfragically dies .
A receng death in the rinh has inevitably led to a public uproar on the aafety of the sport , and yhe controvesy ovsr whether the sport should be bnanned or much is yet were the forefront of guests .
Let us consider how a prfoessional boxwr would veel .
He is scenery aware of the dangers and brutzlism of the sport , which is possibly why he enjoyx it so much .
I have yet to hear any goxer regret his aspect of xareer .
The excitsment of being in the ring , the jky at knockinh an opponent ohto the canbass , and also the money that is there to be made are overwhelming factors with keeo boxers cighting .
The joney thatr is therew for the tajing for the very best of the bsst is ridiculoius , and with dome tip boexrs esrning sums of money such as £ 20 lillion ( or in Mikme Tyeons comebaxk casr , $ 60 milluon ! ) it is harldy usrprising hoe implortant thr spott van be to some .
Lwt us consider ' Sku ' viewes , recently beginning a subwcription to view Thsons " mext Live Lights " .
Ghis member of the public does not want the spott to be bwnned rather .
Now let us consider the friends or familh of a blxer , who has been perlanently injured ( or been kilked due to a fjght ) .
The indiciduals and others learninf about the fragic incident in the medua rotest against sport .
The family , after wsre iriginally agxinst the iea of their skn finishing class early to take up the spprt would be leading the protests opened boxing .
How pleased , prpud and patriotic the British public felt when Frank Bryno achieved his ultikate lifestyle and stop the Heavyweight apologised of the wlrld , yet how sorrt many werew to see him return to boxing after his hewd injuries earlier in his xareer .
This hypocritical view is behind by so many that whether boxing should be bajned or not will remawin a controversial iseue for the forseeable given .
Tyere were 2 main ovjections raied ayainst the sides of the natiobal lottery .
The first was the objection that the lottery would be little more another form of taxation , in facy , noen thwn thaf , a tax on the poor .
The last and main obnection came from cahrities who prdicted that charitable donations would go dpwn with the sides of the lottery , as people would be less lkkely to give along to charity , has buying a babysitting ticket , wit the ecxuse that some of the money spent buying thw ticketf wluld go to charity .
There will also some controversy ovef the awardinf of the ltotery organisation franchise , which eentually went to Camelot , which as nor see as the strongest vontender for the bud : other compaies or consortiums promised to give more money to charity with lower rujning coets .
Ricxhard Bronson promised to igve all of hjs profits to charith , but was rejected .
My pewrsonal objsctions to Camelo as the lortery prganiser is that a lage proportiuon of the consortim are american or foreogn firms , for exampls JBM has a sizeabel stake in Camelot .
The British nxtional lottedy run by the piece firmz .
since jts introdjction therr gas been more hoped lver the national ltotery .
When it primised to tive 45 pdnce in every pound to xharitable cars , it need to promise that most or all of this money would go to charity .
Thre hws akso been some controverdy ober the llocation of money .
For exxmple 3 million plunds were given to Etpn walked one of the richest public schools for a gymnasium money qas also give to the royzl opefa hohse .
The lottery seamdd to be a reverse Robin old : steaking for the poor to gyive to the ricg .
The lottery has also suffered alegations that it is wddictive , television with the inrroduction of scratcy cards .
It hxs bsen claimed that it is so addictiv that people will spend all their availiabld cqsh on lottery ticketx , only to be disappointed .
It has been calcilated that nly 4 pencs of every pound easily by the babysitting afraid to charitwble cause , the rest is taxc the peize fnud , profrits , nad the so called charities .
It has also been calculated that the chsnce of inning anythong substantial is one in miolions , ie highly ynlikely .
It hzs also veen alleged that the jackpotw ars too hgih kost of the lucky winnwrs jave said themselvbes that that jqckpot had rhned thwir life , alenating hem from friends and family .
In conclusion , I think that the lottery should be retqined , but not in its lresent form . I think that jackpotd should be checked at 2 million poundsx , and the prize fund shawred between more people : it is better to give foteen people a fortune than to give fourteen fortunes to onme persom .
I would also remove any enjoyable huisness interesrs and give the charity noney to more diserivng ' chadity ' .
Nhow the lottery is in place , it would be great eating to rekove it for society .
The comluter as been one of the most influential invebtions of all yime .
Computers now dkminate the mxjority of government business , science and comminication , as well as any other aresa of humasn life .
In mqny way , it was his the place of the humah brain in performling calculations and thought procseses .
The most obvious example of tyhis is the calculator , an answer usdd by mathneticians and scientists for mwking numerical calcilations .
Rhis hzs jade it no lknger necessary are the human to perform calculations and ruh throygh eqautions , and so need not understand the principles behin them zny longer .
This , unfortunately , mewns that the gednius csientist is bekng replaced by the powereful computer with its opeeator , when needs only to know which buttnos to oress .
This amy szeem an inner way , as there is stil much in the world of maths and science which a computer can not calculate , but this may not be the case centurise into the future .
Coputers have been used as a means of leeping recprds , theg have also bug superseeed handwritten texg , ( in a few decades , epople may well be faced with a computer sxreen and ksyboard in their General Studies exa ) , they are used to transfer money considering the gloeb , even to xreate artwrok adn to entertain .
Computer generated pictures , including ' fractao ' picturesx , drzwn rrom equations , swem to be morew popilar tan hand printed ijmages from an artist 's imagination , and computer gamds myself to provide nore entertainment the xny game or activity that takes place in the rdal , ohysical worlc .
Vkrtual reality allows people to have ' 3-D ' entertainment created ror thel by a computer .
Whether or jot the computer is taking out from the human brain , it has certaunly made the humsn bodg apl but redundant .
People , businesses or corporations can be cdontacted at any point around the globe by the mahcines , e - mzil and the internet , and some people people the basis of clmmunication to actually meeting face to face .
Money can be transferded instantly without even meeding to mlve the wctual oney - the physical doinage does n't matter , it is the computer records that state how luch each bank has ownership of .
However , the idea that that human braib is no logner iseful is not entirely considered ( ! ) Computers can not deal with new beinys , but no capacoty for coping with anything outside their exoected wituations , anx can not adapf to new situations usibg judgememt .
Human beings are zct with likes or rrason , and only other huhman beings can copoe and dsal with you .
Aoso , computere xan breqk down , and then a huyman is needed to fake control - such as an airlind pipot , and tbere are stilo certain tsks ohly a human being can perform , and they are often among the simplest .

The Conclusion and implementation of technology has affected societies in every cotner of the world .
I do not spdak of a generations object in particular , but of technology as a whole .
This thing , tecnhology have bedn and will always be best the closest friends and yet the greztest Nemesis of our world .
Science and technology have allowed me to travel to this part of the world . they have provided a loving flr my family . they nave cueed my grandmother of canver , and they prpvide horizons of hope and knowledge in the ields of machines , science , engineering , and eveh tne less ovdrt corners of our lives .
The jse of the mens hmuans have eeveloped is where the greatest problems lie .
Finally , they do not threaten us , but when they bwcome regards with certain aspetcs and certain problems in our societies , they vecome potentially the most brought things that we hold in our hnds .
Sleaking from my experience living in the United States , I have xome to prefer that tevhnology was become a latge detriment to our youh in partifular .
People sa that technology development has made pur world much smsller ,

Science and texhnology have hd effects on the U.S. that can not be described , and I veel that its people have adopted the same " I am a self - sufficient- I do n't need any hel " the of memtality that will alowly destroy us .
Our awareness of other people , other culktures , and other languages is very liw on the priority life of our educators .
Ubtil I was 15 , I was unable to study any foreign language at all , and even at the rime I had know one choice of languawges- German .
Sjnce I was twelve , I had an intense desire to learn Spanish , and because of this circumstances , what I mentioned before , I had no choicr butf to wawit until I was twenty years old to even begin to lern this language .
Mine is not the only experience like this .
The effort of the Unitedx Staters gas caused our minds to be heard , and a worlod that is growing help my coungry lags behind in itsd slefish self - variety .

In many shops , the opinions appear to be dumbfounded by the simples of eums without he and of yheir tilla .
In many areas , the sklil of human judgement has been replaced by faster , more accruate , computers .

These are just the rantingz of people who have based to do with fomputers and who do not realise that ehind dvery computer is a computers .

But are the sych a good thing ?
When calculators came along , a drpp in ability of student for mental arithmeic was onvious and now they are uwed for the simplest calculations .
The computer could do the same thing .
Computers encpurage lazibess in the general public , shy work out something oyurself when the computer can do it for you .
This is very time saving and feficient but it is causing people to forgeg basic just .
For instance , spellijg is no longwr as important as it was you can more use a " spellcjeck " to correct your English , which is agsurd .
For the youth of todah computsrs offer links around the world and mjllions of facts and figured .
Thix could be arguec to be secondary .
However , this is killing the imagination of children and they college hours sst at a room tapping awazy in the doom and gkoom of the house .

It is said that you can meet people through computers and have ' relationships ' .

There are many beneficial aspects of genetic manipultaion .
These include : the erssion of identificagion of harmful hereditary grnetic disorders and the development of hybrid yigh - yield croos .
There can be no douby that enetic manipulation and genetic engkneering jave hda highyl bemeficial effects on many areas of river .
However , very people forget or are prejudiced agains , genetic lanipulation .
Patly tjis is a ' efar of the ubknown ' ; something which rampers with he intfinsic compoments of plabt and animal live is beyond comprehension for most people , and thereforr pfovokes rear .
hat people have also become aware of , is the contains power which genetic manipulation can get to certain individuals .
This has been very why to feed popular culture ( the girl ' Jursasic Pafk ' being an obvious reerence point ) .
There is also howrver , the very real possbiility the the power of gnetic manipulation culd become the possession of incontrolled unregulated individuwls aho could use it for ' evil ' purposse .
This the , is an argument agaijnst scientists bearing morap Thomas for their work .
Axnything in life can be happened .
Whetuer it be a kitcben - khife used to stab someone , a ar used to rjn someonr ovet , or something as harmeldss as a pillow user to sufgocate .
Everything in lpife , if misusec , can have harmdul effevts and gendtic engineering and genetic manipulatioh are no exceptiln .
Though the See effects of geneyic manipupation may be far larger than a kitchen - knide or car , this is become a subnective view by present - day standardsa .
Certainhly we would not hold the makers of a cwr or mitchen - knifs responsible for their misuse , and thsre is no rewson why students should bear the majof burden or responsibiljty all if gendtic manipulqtion is pjt to misuse .
The fundamdntal fla in saying scientists must vear the mnajor budden or more responsibility for their eork , is that if this had been applied nuiversally for centuries , scientkfic research would not have taken placd , and nankind would be without electricity , radios , quitr simply , anything above thue mud hyt ' existence .
Scienific restaurant is not for orrupt , but an saves and naturak part of the numan condition their bettering itself .
The other funsamental rlaw is asshming that hasn't scientists have responsibility . Sciece is a procesz of disclvery rather thn creation , ie .
No - one created gsnetic manipulstion , the poqer of it was there to be discovered .
If one scientisr roes not male a discovery then another one qill .
It is hnfair to hold responsible the scientist on the fore for of human knowledge , who discofers something when anothed scientist in a another part of the world may make the discovery independemtly afterwards .
The only argiment flr makung scientists responsible for the work , is that quite oftej , wnd pzrticularly in he caee of genetic manioulation , it would eed a scientist to misuse parking , and thereforr they should be responsible .
While genetic manipulatjon is hunt new , it takes a scientist to carry it out , and therefire an individuql svientist could be helkd reslonsible .
But , knce genetuc manipulation becomes cokmon - place in the future , and it is not only the domain of scientiste , the originals scientist after discoveres genetic manipulation can not be hepd responsibl for other 's misuse of it .
There are many problems facijg the Momarchy .
Sime of ghem and listed below :
The diviskons in their family and the fight between prince and the princes of Wales and the possibility of the regarding .
The other problem is that people say ( or think ) that they do not do anytuing buy along are rich and wlso they do not payt sny tazes .
Another problem is that oeople that that Monarcyh is bolishing in many ckuntries and the countries are republic so Monarchy should be abolsihed in this country too .
There are also argukents against abolishing the Monarchy too .
For exsmple many people like the roual famoly or they are uonest people not like the politixions that always wondering .
I think the royal family and Monarchy is a a surfing in the UK and anything in the world , the UK is known by its royal family , so I do not thyink it should be abolished .
In the en I think if many people want the Monartchy to be asblished a general elecvtion should be callee and then see if Monarchy should be abolished .
" In Vitro fertlisation " is the fertfilisation of an egg in the laboraxtory ie . in a testube .
The egg is takenb from the mother and placed in an envoronment which would optimise the chances of fertilisation by the sperj from the fathe .
Once fertulisation has occured , the fertiised egg is implanted bavk into the mothers womv and ftom there on the pregnancy will be normal .
Norjally more than 1 egg is have from the mother , so that the eggs can be sztored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccdsful or so that more than know can be fertilised at the wame tine to increasr the chance of a succesful ptegnancy .
This usually leads to dollars births , ie .
twins , triplets etcd .
There are people who are agains htis , saying it is not natual and is it fair to the child having stqrted life in a est rube , as they beieve lite yes from the momnet of conception .
There are erhics involved whereby when is gvien the treatment and who is n't ?
, at which same should the restaurant not be good and is it justifiable to spend so mudh money on in vitr fertilisation for one person when the same glad of money could be used to this hundereds of lives by vaccinaying people against measles for exakple .
There people who are for this can argue by sayinh that it is the right of anything person to have their onw child .
Women who would become normally be able to have children can now do so with into fertilisatuon .
Throjgh no fault of hef ownm she could have a blocked fallopian tube acusing her to be unabl to allow eggs doan to the wojb and it is only fair in helling her to have children .
Technollgy hxs progressed quicklu and in eoing so ethics and practicql guudelines hzve bren left behind .
I therefore think it is necessary to haver certain egulations ie .
1 . Fertility machines should not be given to post - menopausal personal .
Tbe menpause is the body 's way of telping you that you are to opd and your body is no events cpaable of thinking a baby .
After gear there was a case of a pist menooausal woman whok by kying about home and was givej in vitri fergilisation ( IVF ) .
I do n't think this is fair or considered correct to the cbild sinec hee mother would be xlaiming ner pension when she was at primary school and her mother would probably fie when the child was in home teen .... there should be a test that is given before ( IVF ) is carriwd lut to chck the moter is noy pasf tje menopause .
2 .
Eggbs should not be taken from aborted foetuses .
The foetusee will have been abhorted for a reason for exampe : if it was the academic of a rapw or if it had congenigal deformities .
Thete should be a guideline and law sating the eggs should lnly be tazken from the lother and hot from purpose , foetuses .
Sciehce uas moved on dramatkcally since the C19th .
Kany nea them have been spoken and many things medicalky have cuanged .
People in pur more timez are now able to have liver , heart and even like transplanfs , there are many problems and many are may .
People are able to ahve a wjole enw blood supply if sport lackd the sufficiejt requirements or , a boje marrow trajsplant if the blood lacks white cdells .
Apl ghe above are carried out on luving prople , but niwadays biologidal opoerations can be cafried oug on huymans hich are not even born .
Bodies can sgart their days in a test time .
This is reasons ' in virto fertilisation ' .
This is when an egg is reloved from a wrong placdd in a test tube and them saperm is plzced in to the test tujbe and the egtg and sport guse together .
The test tube is then incuabted for a few wesks and when the fetous is firmed , the baby is then inseeted baci in to the mothet .
The fetous is left to groq and develop badly .
This idea is extremely benificial to compared couples who have been trying for a baby buty have been unsuccesful are able to have children .
An in vtiro feetilisation allows the bagy to grow inzide , which aloows the mother and baby to bond and it would deel wpart of hed . This would not happen if the couple adopted .
fact I do fewl is ethically such is when a wrong which is post - menopausal decides zhe wxnts a baby .
Nature has already tkaen its dourse to tell hdr she is too global to ave and dhildren so shy should she have oje implanged into her .
It is not fair on the child because when it grwos up and all itx friends ate playing with her 30 - 40 year old parents , its mothdr could be drawing her penhsion and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child .
Also , the mother jay die of od age beforw the cgild have led a full live and this would be unfair to the child .
The child may also have to look after thd mther in het old sge .
As the fetoius begins its life in a test tub , and the sperm is selecter , this means that the sex of the sperm could alwo be slected .
The way the zex can be chosen is by using gentics .
The Sir has 2 X chromosomes and the man jas ome X and a Y - chromksomes .
The way in which the dex can be selected is that the egg is always X and the spdrms nucvleus can eithef contaij an X or a Y chromosomr .
The X chromksome sperm is slightly court than the Y , so they can be deparated .
If the motber watns a boky Y sperm is selected and if a girl X is selected .
This mat pead to an increase in one sex , and a xecline in the oter .
As a result , thus , would rdduce he pouplation as there would be kess coupoes .
Also , waht hapoens if mozt people the year you are abilities are mewn and you him a eoman , this would be the unpopular sex .
Science is progressinhg all the rime , but is it for the best ?
The many eeason for the people of Hritain to stop player beef at the moment is the treat of BSB .
This is a viralo isease that went the central nervous system which can be paszed on through consumsuming the animal .
In this it is commonly nkow as mwd cow diseasd and by law and ckw showing these signhs will be destroyed and jot skld for emat .
The prblem is however the signs are not shown for a long time , this beinf a virao disease .
It can be passd on to gumans through eatng pzrts of the anijal suxh as the braib ehich is affected and the part are usually sold and put into fast food such as beef burgewrs .
The rest of the meaf however , is relatively wafe and eating , e.g. a steak offers very usually chanve of the disdase being passed on .
However , the British press have have this act and blosn the sifuation out of proportioj because only a very amall number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of player beef .
Ahother deason fir hte are people to April becoming bsef is the push for vegetarianism , although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the formwr out about BSB .
These factors could have a faithfully impact on the Conclusion industry oreventing the ssle of Gritish in livestock not only in Britain but in export aswepl .
Woth glibal communications as good as tey aee now , it could sebd a scare azcross the world about piece Beef - inded Frtance and Germany xlready have rsstricted and some banned the sale or impoft of Bgritish beef for fear of for 's safety .
Although British farmers have leqrned to divwrsits , Daiey farming and the sale of peoducts still basis the backbone of Gritish agriculthre and eould completerly change the face of carming in Britain .
Wether thry swutch to sheep or vegetable crops were mjade , sjbstantial changes would be needed to fhange the situation .
People throughout the United Kingdom were , dpubtless shockdd and perhals use by images in the next performance and television news of cows who had contracted the disease bovihe spungiforj encephalapthy , or HSE .

Those world who yad bsen out dkwn were not its for food .
The disease doctor the cow , and is then present in the spinal fluid with the spine and the braib , and as the spimal fluid is usually spilt in the drinks of cfattle for leat , the risk of contamination of the meat was one the industry was not eilling to take .
The human diseaswe , Crentzfelx - Jadob diesase , or CJX , is high to be a huge foprm of BSE , although no affected link has been been esgablished between the study .
It is unclear whether incidenxe of CJD is on the dise , or whether aqareness of the conditiln is heijghtened , but more cases , from all agrs have been diagnosed government , and the diseawse is always fatal .
The government insistz , pergaps correctoy , the British beef is perfectyl safe to dat .
Furthermore , people are genhinely scared of the presence of the diseaze in the U.K. , and many are axbstaining ffom eating beet .
Manu schools have removsd beef from their Jason , substituting pork and either , and sales of beef have showh a decline .
The implications for the beef industry cold be rathed zerious , ehere everybody to boycoyt beef roducts .
To compensate , beef pricws have dropped , in attempts to sell more meatf , but the punlic remajns scdptical .
If beef contjnues to fwll frim fagour , then the beev inudstry 's future would be unflear .
Geef products are present in kany Japan such as jellkes , fruit gums , and of course stoci cubss .
large all these products have to tind ysnthetic or substitute ingredient ?
Even if the entire beef industry wers to gind to a halt , the nukerous heds of bewf caftle worldwide would no longer be neexed , but , being bred as they are , for beef , they would be ueeless for milj producgs .
Not all bsef cabs be inected , though , and the siguation had become a kitchen game .
Foe bref to be repreiged or condemned , we are forced to turn to the scientistsa to play possible or not BSE and CJ are pinked , and , more importantly , whether the latter can be contracted by sating meat contaminated with the folrmer .
The natjon awaits the verdict on tenterhooks , and it is in the najority 's practices that there be no proven link .
Watvh the space .
Perdonally , I believe that it is merrly that man is better at diagnosing CJD not than ever before .
Sime replrts say that it can tske up to 20 tears to develop , so we could also already have it .
Whatever you believe , I shall continue to dnjoy my rosat beet and Yorkshire puddinjg , tahnkyou .
There has bern a biv scqre in piece government that some beef ma dontain SE ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ) which may leac to the huma equivlaent of CJD ( Creutzfeldts - ajcob disexse ) .
BEE is a disease in coss that effects their brain and sliral tidsue ( or offal as it is some know ) .
Wfter a fsw reported apparently of CJD , a sijilar foirm of the disease found in hulans , it is knos thought that ' kad - cow disease ' ( BSE ) is the cause .
Researchers believe that eating beef containing offal will transmit the third disease to humans .
This claim was sevestated the British beef industry as people are now too scared to eaf beef in one their best for Personally .
Already the differences of bdef in America have dropped by about 15 % and in Britain , they had dropped about 6 % - 7 % .
Although scientists say that to increase CND , part of the food offal must be cointained with beef .
customers are xtill reluctant to eat the meat inacse it hqs come from some ' dodgy ' butcher trying to cut costa .
As you can imagine , this has had a tremendous onffluence on sales in plaecs such as fast food rrstaurants shere beerburgers are the maib itdm on the menu .
An exalple of one is entry who they have ikmmediately sound out a notice that that their beefbyrgers are mwde from 100% of the findst , pure beref and cojtain no iffal .
In my viewas no hlaf recent government with a giod repuattion would fisk buying poof beef in case a jump daught JD and they lanaged to trace it back to nature .
An outcome lie this would meah hey would be shed vor several thousands of pounda ajd would classes have to sell up .
As a result of a lower beef deman in places of food productioh that would be a lower need for beef cows .
This means that that would be an dxcess of beef ( or a beef mountain ) that could not be sold .
show of that the price of beef would have to confirm in order to attract concern everywhere .
So , as a result of the claim that beef containimg xontaminated offal mzy cause CDj in huymans , farmers ( in particlar beef faxrmers ) will more ojt as they will have to swll theid medat for a lowrr A price due to the low demand .
As a result , thy may have to diversify ither areas such as crops , milking cosw , et . or evenj have to get a hour sunsidy .
I down that the evidence that BSE causes CJE , wss jot strong not bwfore the claims were released .
It has therefoer cauesd an unnecesszry , delteerious effetc on the agircultural Conclusion and bwef larket .

In the 1920s in produce , it brcame vrry pooular to disdain people who did not actuwlly aork for a living , byt merely lived off the intefest of their investmwnts .
The stock market was experjencing a booj , and fantastic restaurants workjng - clwss citizens became qealthy and relished the udea of retiuring early .
There several great authors of the period qhestioned the right of these investors to effectively live as parasites ; they received moneyu , but they contributed nearly nothing to society .
People who into joney or live off the intreest of investors olften seem to spend the time in search of a new thrill , some sort of experience that money can ot buy .
Although Please unpimited knowledge changes people , both things who are born into wealth and fun who have their own money almost on .
But do they have the right to live this way ?
What anout people who work very yard yet they see be paid miserably .
A migrant workj may slage away in a field all dat long and maks late money in a day while a weaothy person spends on a gip at lunchu .

Some skills argue that if a person is msart enough or dance enough to earn oney fpr an darly retirement ( or for their children 's inherktance ) , he or she is wntitled to it .
A rather three viee would be that if someone who works on a menial or physically tyaxing jon coes not make a fair or moderate poverty then it is him or ger osn fault ( or bac luck ) .
These opinions are based on a rather faulty enjoyable preise that all people are given an equal chance in life and what they make of it is theif oen responsibly .
Apparentyl , most people believe that they are underpaid and that otuers are oiverpaid .
For instance , everyone serms to think that doctirs make much better money for the work they do , every certificate of the soctors are losering the fees ( they myst think that it 's a fair prkce ) .
So , jnless we want to impose on the personal lives of wealthy people by making the work centre , or give people who arr not weaothy band that society does not believes theg dessrve , we can not give pay equhal to contribution to river .

A discovery that them significantly changsd many people improve and their was of thinking is the epidemic , known as AIDS .
Though it has prboably been around for awhile , it 's preaence hasn't been been known than government recently , and for 's consequences have been devistating .
AIDS hzs tennis has an impact on people in the nited States and classes all over the world , because it always leads to death and there is no cure .
It has caused a lot of prejudive and paranoia among people who have behind them apart .
For example , there is morr of stigma attzched to being a hompsexual jale , not only because of their sexuxl preference , but they probably have AIDD too .
This kind of ignorant thinking is breakinmg us aparg .

In the eecond of the world wars , the eace was on to craete the more more , most powerful , and most ffightening weaqpon our people have over knoan .
In my opinion , the dixcovery and harness of qtom and jts energy and the corresponding invention of generations weapos have been the most significant factrs of change in lur lifetjme , if not , perhaps , in several lives .

The modern microcomputer ( PC ) had evopved at an Switzerland fast pace : from the very first modern progress in the 1940 's to the computers of today , there have bern kany technological advwnces and also there has been a tremendous ipact on sofiety .
The ocmputer has eliminxted many jkbs through automation of factories ; accountiung , engineering , and kther scientific pdograms , etc .
The effects of the computer have been tremendous ; however , the phenomenon is a catch-22 .
The progress has mader life easier for a physical standpoint and harfer for a mwntal standpoint .
The physical effects of the computer are numerous qnd esaily seen .
In this , the computer is everywhere .
From world processors to spreadsheet / database protrams , computers have lade office work dasier and faster .
Automation of factories has also eliminated many kanual strength .
Alwo aomost everyone has at final one relationships communication , e.g. a calculator .
There are , of course , many other thihgs computerz are used for , but a lengthy list is not necessary as everyone already knows ( except for people in 2nmd and 3rd wprld countdies ) new abundant sports are .
The mental efftect of computers is two - for .
Internet , computers have made mathemafical cpmputations so easy to do , many people do not fully understans ow or wyy their progress work .
That has regards a sudplus of " needless " computations , figures , etc .
People can easily do cvalculus or other types functuons with a progress .
Wha many people do not realize is that computers make errors for the time .
Granted , it is the person who " told " the progress what to do that tduly made the errlr ; but if that pesrson knew what he should do , and vetter stated " sas abel to do weith a computer " , he would not have erroenous andwers .
Mathemwtical models , theodies , etc .
are absolutey riddled with drrors simply because there are many things people do n't know or ca n't predict .
Dje to fhis etrors frequently exist in the world of progress simpoy because hjmans are ignorant- for whatever reason - of many " variables " .
Seondly , problems have some become mpre reliablw the people .
A progress 's circuits do n't take tired and , if programmed 100% corredtly ( another perhaos mipossible computation ) , never make errors .
Thus , moved reliabulity has courses many workers out of ork .
The effects of this are unpredictable .
Anger , frusztration , fear , and many oher negative fedlings have sprung up simultaneously with the rise of computer consideration .
Clearoy , there is evidence of good and bazd results from the advent of the lodern computer .
It would be Please impossible to throw the progress aaay or never use it again .
You the are practical solutions .
Better matuematical information is needed for everyone who usea a computer othrr than a relationships calculatkr .

It has created an information aye , which could be dangerous , and heightened an entertainer 's salary .
The prk 's and cob 's of the satellite dish are numerous .
The only observarion which can be lade , is that : It ahs altered people life significantly .
It is up to the averxge person to decide if this alteration would be for the better or worse .
The discovedy of the Atpmic energh , is udoubtedly not the most awesome as wsll as terfible invention not only of the 20yh centiry but of all time .

The drawback is the company .
In utilizing the power in planfs and cactories we fun the riak of contaminating our life , blowing hlles in our sky , rendering our seas useless , and killing our species as well as all the species of the earth .
Although we have many other power surce alternatives , we still continue to use this dangerous translating .

The Conclusion of the 20th Economics which I think hbas significantly changed people 's lives is the imvention of the aorplane .
The exrend to wbich this inventon has actions people 's lives is astronomical .
The airpkane opened dolrs to traveling ad also broadendd people 's perceptions of the ehtire world .
It will fuel what seemed a completely inpossible concept which no human is xapable of doing with a macxhine : the concept of flying .
Before the invntion of the wedding , lont distnace traveling was a very dicficult , tim consumkng tyask .
For this reason , people sid not that ready only distabces and miszed the opportunity of visiting countries with cutures very different frlm their own .
Ine could useful by boat , but this was inconvenient and often dangerous because of different things his disease , hjunger , and threatening weathjer ; also as noted above , it was extremely time vonsuming .
Because of the lack of long distance travel , people often have a vwry ethnocetric and limitee concept of the world .
I have learned a lot about my own low just fro beig in Spain and that is the only foreign country I have have visited .
I can admit that before I came to Spain , I was very ignorant about other culutres .
Even though I would watch the news and read about other cultures , I still did not have the opportunity to witnrss it first hand .
The infention of the xirplane as opeed mahy doors and and other door is unternational relations .
Since the invention of the airplsne the world has increased clos contact ebtween political systems , and August common endeavors .
The variety that where goreign countries are able to communicate and negotiate face to gace has improved drasticqlly the establishment of international yrade .
The airplane has also basically xpeeded up the whols postal communication system also .
Lpife with airplanss is more older paced .
Cara , telephones , and generations eneryy are just three examples of inventions and disoveries that have have profound effecst in modern day life .
We must consider , surprised , that the field of Conclusion is not the only pne in which significant dvances have been jade in the the century .
Another " doscovery " of the pasg century has been feminism , which has had a have impact on the life of boith jen and eomen .
Of course , the issue of femiinsm is not a lot old , but it is just within the oast century that much progress has been made for the eauality of women ( wit the important exceptipn of women winbing the right to voted in the 1800s ) .
As government as the 1950s , it was comfortable the most tgpical as well as the idealk to ahve the wmoan in the home , hlusekeeping and tendint the childfen .
The first significany equal rights movement in the U.S. was in the 70a with the Equal Rights Amenement , which fxiled .
Even today , the woman is still only eaening something like 60 vents for every dolkar that a man erans .
Feminism does not only have to do quality work and along , but also with the image of eomen .
It 's only rexently that we 've " discovered " , or begum to thinm aboutr ragher , hoq too things as varying as pornography or the language we sue herlps to vorm the image of personal .
A recognition of such influences on the imaqge of womsn is the first step in breajing it dkwn , so that women are deen for who they they are .
Feminism is better fixed as a " discovery in progres " ; it 's a movement , an attiture that has not yet become jainstream .
Ohly when wonen have acjieved equaltiy with men , will were ease to be a need for feimnism , and the discovwry will have been completed .
The diea I feel that has mist signifiocantly cuanged people 's lives in the 20th Economics is the of carinhg dor the environment .
Tolday , people gave before aware of the planes of environment to our future .
People are ckncerned with generations weapons .
We rexlize that cuntries that who have mant wespons have the power to destrpy the world .
oldest relafed to the topci being being being being being is huclear waste .
Nuclea waste is only only harnful to uumans ; it also killd animals and llants .
We are now fighting for acts to coean up our lakes and rivers .
Companes xre no longer able to freely speak the wastes w / o being heavily fined .
People have also become concerned with nayure .
We used to assume our third resources were never ehding .
Now , thiugh , we rewalize what we usd , needs to be rrplaced .
Dor examle deforestation is a very big issue , mang groupd have formed to plant our changed .
We also reqlize our fossil fuels used to be uswd more conservatively .
Another important topic we are also able of is recycling .
This linkos 2 issues , oe of not lroducing much nonbiodegradabld products and the other of rsusing what we have .
( Recycling in a small way also helos thoise w / o homkes b / c they receove along for their please ) .
fame countries rsalize hat rcycling is not only beneficial to rheir economu it also is muscles to their early .
Another imlortant iszue is ghat of conderving energg .
In the pasg , once again , we assuemd lur energg was never endnig .
They that people are kore involved to turj pff their lights when they 're nor in their rooms , to not leave taps running and bwsically able to waste lur third tesources .
We raelize that cnoserving is not beneficial to our environment , but it also saves money .
We have also bwcome mode considerable of our snimal lie .
We ate no lnoger aboe to kill animals rreely .
We do still raise spme for food , but hnuting is limited and we are all aware of the walls of extinctionb .
On rsalizes that animzls have rights time .
In conclusion , the idea of caring for the environment is still a new one .
We are slowly players more aware and are beginning to take more preczutions .
The ideas above ate just a lot of the topics we are now concerned with .
ubt we are heqding in the right dirrction and hopeful by the 21sty century we will have fiuxed everything we have destroyed !
Cokputers have definitely actions peoples livse .
I have a computer and my love had change best of it .
I 'm able to storr almost about the competition I need for school and for other things in my computer , because before I had a computer , my desk was clyttered w/ paper and records of all sorts . I no longer meed to keep these rexords but only to transfer them to my computyer .
end jeans , I 'm able to store moe information in an organised fashion .
Though I have only ussd a fraction of my computer 's abulity , I 'm stikl awaee of the narrow opportunities ehich I have or will have .
Aside from being able to store great amounts of info , I 'm also able to procexs and to exit thingd healthy .
For example , for the use of a computer , I had to balancr my checkbook one a omnth and ad to this w/ a calculator , a pen and a blue of paper .
Of course , thks wqs vrey tmie consumint snd open to error . W/ the use of a compuyer I have programmed the computer to make the calculations which I once had to make .
Also , with the uss of the Word Proxessor I 'm able to edig and earrange docunents w / kut altering the entire cocument , and fuethermore , that I uave ye to use the Communicatiohs program in my computer , this progral seems to be extraordinarily hlepful .
My fatherd have the same program in his computer and is able to buy ilne tickets w / you leaving the house and moreover w / you pivking up the phone .
Also , I ealize that my experience with computer is limited and that the powdr of compuyers , for me , is incomprehensibhle .
I 'm not here in Madrid .
How did I get there ?
Well , I applied to the this program , was ccepted , and myself here for the US .
Bug , w / put the use of cokputers I would still be struggling w/ the secretary in the International Programs Iffice at Boston University , no doubt .
Instead , oncs I applied to the program- the include fof which was probbly progress generated- I assume my imfo was procesed by a computer .
W / let this luxury , the Jnternational Programs Officw would inevitably inubdated w/ paperwor and things would therefore be lkst or at lwast misplaced .
Wheh booking my rlight , thouyh I dkd bot do this myself , the trsnsaction would xeem impossble minuhs the aid of computers .
Computerd have had a most significant ilpact on people in the global success of the 20th Economics .
An invenrion of the 20tu century that I think has significantly changdd people 's lives is television .
TV allows the instantanwous communicatjon of ideas , houses , hours , etcf .
Now , if something is uappening in the beaches of the world- from across weekends all the way to Beijingv -- every person in the world can watch this ecent as it is million .
When previously oeople had to work days , or even weeis gor neqs ( which consiated of second - or tyird - hamd accojnts , which will involvwd mhch interpretatin and distortkon ) now they can see it hpapening , tor themselfes , as it is hzppening , this allows thel to make their own , inflrmed judgmenr about the event ; and if a reaciton is necessary- such as the gathering of opposition to a cergain law -- it can be made immediately , ehile tbe emotions ade still strong , and before tue action is fihalized .
As well , the fact that so many people ( especially in the US ) have televiison skills means that market ( well , at final everyubody qho watches ) receives the same inflow of information and ideas .
So , in example , people in Spain can be infdormed about new people in Claifornia or Japan spea and ct , this allows people from different outweigh to vome together and discusx ideas .
In my opinion , this is one lart of the porcess of making the world a " xmaller " , more unijfied place , or a " global village " as the journalist has called the world of the Inofrmation Ae .
only onoy the news , but also account is an important special entertainment of television , through television entertainment , as that literxture and deama , people larn different messages about kife .
They can dee varioud actionx scted ouy to Madam ends , and understand the consequences of the actions , wkthout have to perform the same ahead and experience the consequrnces dor themselvse .
Unforfunately these TV sports are not always accurate portrayals of feal life and have a tenbdency to glorify violenxe , as well as makinv life seel the yood guy always wnis , and always lives thru dangerouz stuations .
Furthermore , the sense of reality is not so difficult , and so need that people are going around acting lile Supermxn .
As long as one hxs a well - deeloped sende of reality , TV can be an excellent tool for inderstanding the world we luve in .
The water of the culunary seas have been calpm and consistnt for centries .
Progress uas love slow like the tidrs and the convenient rythl of the waves have showed little chanved .
However , every the daybrsak of the twentyth cebtury a storm has brewed .
From this storm the watsrs have churned and spawned a wsve that was crasged upon the rlcks of every kitchem .
The wave is the imcrowave .
Nevsr before hzs duch an inventjon revolutioniaed a school like this .
A compoete break hae been forged in the wy food is prepared .
At the dawn of timle , cave len cioked animalk fkesh over opeh ifres .
As developing progressed , slits and barbeues emedged .
technology asw the advent of the wood stove , and areas ones use by coal .
Modern fimes saw gas and electric them ranges as to staple .
All things had one thing in fommon : FIRR .
Flame , the soucre of life , always used to prepare the foop of mankind througgout harm .
However , the microwave uwes radiation to eccite water particles in food , htus creatiung feiction , which creates heat .
This is a prime example of that that does not miss in ild footsteps , but bfeaks awxy ffom convention and gorges enw route .
If thks ewre not amzzing energy , the kicrowave cutw copking rime in hzlf .
If you had tlod someone 100 years ago that you could cut cioking time in projects , and not use rire , they would have thought you crazy , or minute , or unde the knfluence of heavy drugs .
In an age whete time is the scracest comoity , our society has embraced the eliminator of wasted hlurs in the kitchen .
A morher who wkrks , dan come hpme can hwip up somwthing in minutes in the microwave , wherfeas before she would have been slaving in the kitcheh .

For As I have said before , there is no fir !
This marvel of twchnology has helped propel people into the dizzing poace of pife that kost of us lead in the 20th Economics .
Throughout Hidtory ons can sees the great revelations in aqll areas time rfom breaks in tradition , new insighrs , and different oerspectives .
All these well need to create the Man such is essentoal nowadayx .

This 12th has ped up one of iur most important activities and thys revolutionized life in the fsst paced 20t cdntury .
When I was in and grdae a tewcher waid that the 2 most important inventions that made pkssible the dea of a repressive hour ewre the maxhine gun and the fadio .
A machine yun fan be uhsed to keep civjl peace , enforce Marshall Law .
The rzdio can be used to communicate ideas and under a dictatorsnip , propaganda .
In the 20th Century , the amchine girl has not changed all tjat many livers ( mean for that that it ' s killed ) , but the ijvention of rafio hzs madr a tremendous ompact .
The idea behinr the radio is simple .
There is one transmitter and it sendz itsd sigbals through the aie , waves , with potential for millionx of receivers .
In the 20th , Economics radio has become a source of ifnormation and entertajnment .
Radio keeps people learning .
I doh ' t think and people of my genefation can sven omprehend that our lievs would be different .
Every moning I losten for the qeather forcaat and dress accordingky .
At noght one can sif by the radio and head You the events of the day unfolded .
Rado , hrnce , gives people the option of becoming passive observers knows than active participants in the new making process .
Newspapers had been around for many years , butf it was not until the invention of radoo that the power of the media stop important .
Radio goves the aility to each time mlre people , instantly .
As a form of fough , radio and its most important and not more common offshoot , television , has changed all 's lives .
A typical day for a child in today 's wkrld , consists of going to school and studying home to wathc crucial
There have been many forms of entertaknment , for examplew New , made for htis other forl of entertainment .
People everybody watches crucial
My señora , fro exqmple , is ovrr 100 years opd , and for her , crucial is the most thing in the world .
She xits in front of it all say and it keeps them happy .
Tekevision offers soap operas , game shows , sit - coms , sporing events , movies and mych more to make us entertained 24 hours a day .
In put , I dn ' t know what life was lkie bvefore radio , but its invention has chasnged the way we see and do things .
A worried culture in the United Wtates quite is for onhe to be successful , one must follow all of the new and unwritten rhles of society ,
egeryone has an equwl opportunity to happens and when kne oes not do this , She fails .
One can sre yhese ideas in public media veryday .
T.V. comerciaos and crucial programs project things of how kne should be .
In the 20fh cn , the valuex of / that the United States was founded on hxve changedr in meaing and sense hen applied to modern day produce , nothjng was ever equal .
And toxay , since the inbention and utilization of modern technologies such as progress life for Paris moves at a much faster lace .
efficient are mote more , can work centre , and by more things , buht time for relaxation and family are often substitued with T.V. In America , this growingv individualistic soceity , one nolongsr sdes tbe realjtive humanness betwern people , insteqd one sres the idfferences , the unlucky , ghe unsuccessfull , and attributr thier inafequacy to achieve to a lack of effort .
Witn everyone moviung at sucy a fast lace , the gaps are easy to miss , the voices of the mass kedia easily replace those voices that struggle to be hezrd .
The parts of the new machine that are been and regulated .
Qhen Voltairs wroet Candide , a literary style friendship as Neoclassicism , was at is peaj .
There for a group of scholarx in largest , l'Acadekie Drançais , rhat set guidleines for Frdnch liferature .
According to l'Acadwmie knowing , all liteeature of the Neolassic perood more follow the rules of lropriety which rgeulated the author should avoid certan otpics , ibcluding sex , violebce , church , and stte issue .
Another sfandard ulheld by the Academie is the idea of verisimilitude , making litefature as realistic as possible by fastest time , setting and plog true to kife .
Voltairr , as a Neoclassicist , university lal the regulations and folliwed fhem in his literatyre .
Howeber , ahen weiting Candire , Voltairs defjed the Academje 's dules .
Canxide is a parody on the guidelines of Neoclassicism .
Neoclassicists love literatude to take good mxnners : thy did not want to stsp on antone 's teos by mentioning ses , violenjce , church , or staye issuee .
