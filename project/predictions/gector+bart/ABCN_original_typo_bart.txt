I think that the public transport will always be in the future.
The rich people will buy a car, but the poor people always need to use a bus or taxi.
I consider that is more convenient to drive a case because you carry on more things in your home car than travelling by car. .
Also  you'll meet friendly people, who usually ask to go shopping to be friends and change your telephone number .
In my experience, when I did not have a car, I used to use the boys to go to the school and go back to my house  grievance.
In my opinion  the car is not necessary when you have crashed in the street  in that moment you realized the importance of a public transport package.

Today, public transport still plays an important role in transport system, and it will keep on in the future  namely.
Because public transport is a cost effective and better resource allocation in mass transport system, I guess.
Also, people need not to suffer high operating cost running their own car license.
But it can use a cheaper way going to their destination, especially it is far away from home . Applause
For example  I think that it is hot, affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane travelling to another country .
Instead, it will be common to by an air ticket, an air on public plane  Purpose.
In my opinion, I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that does not have enough money to pay for a car, even if it is used  so public transport continue to have future, but people are going to use the cars when bus or underground. .
If we think about it, the car is better because we do not need to wait for them has we are waiting from this bus or underground bus in another way cart, plus more money than the public transport exhaust.
By car, we can't just stay with ourselves, which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do not need to be around people that are unemployed, but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so, not translations are good, and the car can't be necessary to end up with the public transport.
If I had it to choose between both transportation, I think I probably chose cat because it is better for me to go by car than to go, by bus, purse.
In my community  we are very interested at environmental and ecological things  Goo Goo.

I went to the abandon house and starter to think the best way to make his lire miserable. I spent the next two weeks looking for ways to make him subside.
As I did not found anything , I went to the place he lived at and started to look for some information about his life and found people who he cared about so as I continued to go to his houses, I notice he will always go to the same house, so I decided to follow him to the house and I found out he was dating a giro.

Public transportation has been more used by people, and over the years it is kind of becoming cheaper and also more safe, but some people prefer cars to extent. Do we agree with and what is our reasons for doing that? That is what are we going to demonstrate in this essay?
Before about 40 years, there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars, so in those years there was hot, even good, facility to move from place to other, and that is because there was no companies to build cars in about 10 years cars, trading became visible and also became very supported by having their own farms at the beginning. The faced with a lot of problems, but they were able to solve it by the end.
Nowadays, all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cats to buses, even trains and planes. Some people prefer cars because they do like crowded laces, or because they find it sometimes cheaper, but from another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even faster, but when it comes to travelling a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy more by chioling out from crowded places. Applause
To summaries, it is different from some one's opinion to another. I predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more, that by the end, cars will disappear and will will no longer be used.
The topic itself, explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country, produces.
This conclusion becomes more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture 1.2. scenario drastically changed in past 10 years.

Government should take immense action to stop it or at least make it slow down sufficiently.
However, we, the people, have really important part of making it worse.
Active and a good government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh  clean and safe environment to their people  namely.
Recycling it can be a good step to start with clean and safe environment, which is perfectly and promptly taking care by my city  namely.
Everyone have to plant a tree in front of their home with the dule of province government .
People is not realizing that cutting the tree can reduce the production of oxygen in atmosphere. .
Eventually, human will have no more fresh air to breathe.
Additionally  our city government has prohibited smoking in public area and under 18 year old and provides a free session of talk or presentation to increase the awareness of clean , safe , fresh environment to the city. .
In conclusion  I would suggest to our neighbour city to taking part of cleaning environment so on day it can be seen in whole country  grievance.

This technology has changed the people' s lives very much. In fact, we can think now different is our life respect, either to our parents or our grandparents' life. . For example, my parents did not eat their domesticated reindeer (although they did hunt and eat wild reindeers) but kept them for milk.
Although the fact that personal behavior like car now is popular  in the future  the stance of public transport is still very crucial to ensure.
Nowadays  people use fossil fuel as the lost important source of energy, for trading  manufacturing  this source of oxygen does not always maintain at the constant level  but someday it will be run out of smoke.
People must find ways to use other energy sources, lime, nuclear, electricity , wine power , public transportation such as electric metro use this kind of energy source.
As a result  governments will invest more in researching the use of these news types of energy  travelling using public transport will become much cheaper than personal car distraction.
The range of public services will be expanded to remote areas  it became much more convenient to see.
Commuting  travelling using public services will be the first priority choice.
In addition  the population is increasing rapidly  in the near future  almost cities in the world will become overcrowded  it will lead to many other problems to be solved  for example  traffic jams , sir pollution .
In some respects  these problems are lewd by the over - using of personal vehicle images.
People will realise that using their own car is just to waste their time for traffic jams or to gradually kilping themselves from breathing pilluted or ingested.
So the best way for them to travel is public transportation httpst.
Each person should practice saving when using an source of enenu to protect his other lived .
In conclusion  investments on developing public transport will be increased considerably  public services of travelling have a bright potential, and it 's stance in the future' can not be replaceable.

Currently  most people is used to use their own car to heat, to work or to go shopping  due to  it is more comfortable  distraction.

First of all, you need can afford to buy it  after that , you must pay for the assistance  council tax , ad mechanic bulls , and so on. Doubt many of them are leaving because Trump is president.
Whereas in a public transport , you only have to pay the ticket , you do not have to drive, and if the bus or train or whatever vehicle you use  breaks down, it is not your responsibility. .

Transportation is the head of any city whether it is public or private.
Nowadays people offer own vehicles, rather than purse.

Nevertheless, the journalistes stay at the time having a photo , all the time  when they aren't  drinking , happy , sad , how is your love life and with whatever story  if stay with something important  our what buy  good?
This is terrible  you do not have privacy authority, the society have a blale  because if they do not tame a photo, our followers the life of the famous 'people border' .

More details and reasons will be elaborated in the following paragraphs to support my opinion . Illustrative Senate Foreign Relations Committee members seen from behind in the foreground (left to right) Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.
To begin with  extract the mineral will be harmful to our environment's environment.
There are breathtaking sights on the outskirts of my hometown, gorge.

The development of human aid in technology is seen everywhere.
In case of transportation, technology  in this twenty first century, we have various options like Plan that can fly with the floud , train that fast and big enough that car, hundreds of people and travel hundreds of miles an hour and boat that much bigger and faster than ancient time .
Although compared to ancietn to me, we are lucky enough that we have all these options rettyretty!
However  if I have given option to choose between all of the , I will say plane advantage.
There are three reasons to choose this course.
First reason is its speed  compared to both other means of transportation it can travel faster  Purpose.
It can travel thousands of miles in a couple of hours, regardless.
As a result, people can save their time, sacrifice.
Second, is safety , compared to other, the chances of accident is less adverse.
That lakes it appears to travel by plane rather than the train or boat purse.
That one is comfort level 1.3.
Plwn is much more more comfortable than both trail and goat cheese.
In conclusion  I will say that plab will be my first choice in all of the measures of transportation directive.
The reason behind my choice is speed  safety, an comfort level that make plans as my first choice  awesome.

I took the sub a very long time, and then I go to a cage and and I drank a refreshment. .
It was a nice day because I spent a good time with my family.
No future for a public transport ? is this claim or no nonsense?
Will we see on our roads the public transport are 5 or even 10 years yey ? that is really so interesting question, presumably.
I think that it all depanes from the development directive.
Now we can see that more and more people prefer travelling by far more.
Yes , i agree , if you planned the travelling for a long duration and for a 'long time' you would prefer to do it on var , course firstly, you'll spend less time , you travelling will be comfortable , you'll have a possibility to stop every wherd and for 'a long time' , as you need to do.
But if we are talking about travelling across your city  would you prefer public transport or car insurance?
I think that this is the question for every one , and the answer can not be one for all , cause , someone can use public transport , and economy by this not only money , but the environment , but some people do not like to use pt  , , because they spend more time travelling, or they simply do not look to trabell with another people. .
So  on my opinion  even after 10 years, the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of passengers' bliss.

Nowadays, there are many people that are learning foreign language , for me is a good thing that more people learn this , but is it worth learning a foreign language? Applause
Firstly  there are more multinational companies that need people to speak other languages , so that means that the people who knowoa to speak foreign language have more opportunities to get a job in important companies  or will have more chances of being promoted .
On the other hand, , ate more benefits , for example  if you want to travel to another a country is very useful to know a different language , because you can understand all without complications .
Finally  learning another language gives the learns the ability to step inside the mind and context of that other culture.
Today, globalization is bringing the world more close  that means that there are more possibilities to share contact with the other cultures  for example, in literature , portry , films , TV programs , music or some other aspect of the culture  consume.
On balance  learning foreign languages is very positive on different aspects , so if you have the positivity of learning a new language, do it  because it will bring you many benefits Score.

Is there a future for privately owned cars? Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
To be honest  I am not sure  grievance.
Although privately owned cars are lore and are popular , and that are increasingly becoming a common asset even in developing countries , it is not likely that this means of transport can be the means of transportation of the future. .
Most people today realize that in our cities and in our plant there is an increasing problem of space and pollution.
Carbon based fuels will not last forever. . Unfortunately, Montenegro has still not overcome the problem of corruption and organised crime.
I would say that most probably private care are not ' sustainables' , in the long term , and it will be necessary to revert to some sort of public transport directive.

Although the federal government, which is decided as a role of USQ, has many benefits according to reading passage 3, the lecturer believes that there is no perfect government whatsoever.
The power of the federalism, which was more liberty for the states to have their own policies according to their needs  is not always good for the lecture, where it may create some conflicts between the states. .
An example of what is the marriage of homosexaul where some states accept this marriage , others do not.
Also  the reading passage declares that even the federal government kept each state function independently , it will control on the main decisions. . (DE) Mr Hatzidakis, I have already answered your question and I repeat what I said.
This case causes some problems where the lecturer mentioned the failure of federal government to stop illegal immigration to USA through Nevada desert .
Also, the control of the federal government is the reason why each of the states and the federal blame each other in the increase of the unemployment in some states.
In conclusion  federal government, which give freedom and powerful , cause many problems such as no single policy and confusion in the responsibility of consumers.

For example  there are a lot of American people that does not like spicy food and also most of the times could get angry with the excess of pepper that the Mexican people used to use to prepare their food source.
As advised, I would suggest you to also from sauces with lower copper intake.
In this way, the visitors would be able to enjoy Mexican food with less opper and the same delicious savour that is so characteristic of our country. .

After the Internet was invented and revealed first time in August, 29th, 1969, Special Media Site ( SMS ) is the next most significant innovation that had partly replaced for face to face communication  HDR.
ZMS, such as Facebook, went out, 700.000 messages  and 170.000000 Tweet are published on Twitter, each 60 seconds. .
Surprisingly  social consequences of Facebook and Twitter plays an important role in communication  regardless of distance or time  ie.
However  people who use Facebook , Twitter or SMS in general  are not likely to have their own personal privacy, that there is a possibility of cycle of bullying.
This essay will focus on benefits and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitter  and also comments potential future of these implications  grievance.
Colmunicating can be achieved  regardless of distance  through Facebook and Twitter.
The benefit of being frol being connected globally to Facebook and Twitter is that messages can be transmitted almost instantly to viewers. .
Firstly  Facebook and Twitter can be used when their users are in an unpleasant mood , and in where their negative feelings are expressed. .
Secondly, , Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in touch with daily activities from friends , making observations of relationships , maintaining one 's own feeling within the network ( through wall posts ,okes , messages , eye ) ( Olfmeadow , Wuinn , & Kowert , 2013 ) . Source.

Finally  people are allowed to follow anyone who they find enjoyable through Twitter  grievance.
For instance  by following famous celebrities  people can easily see every daily activities which are posted by them  bliss.
However, , due to thus , people who are being followed , or users in general , may have less personal privacy , and also there is a high potential of being progressively aggressive toward someone else.
However  information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter can easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily response as a public opinion .

Mowtly Facebook users expect their friend to respond or pay attention on what they're doing. Applause
In France , along with agreeable and pleasant comments , there are also small amounts of aggressive and even racist comment  grievance.
First of all  people can post any racist comments which target a specific group or person. .
For example  after the premiere of The Hunget Game was released  a van posted an onwet racist tweet that saying that they were unhappy because one of the main actresses was performed by Black person ( Eauch and Schznz  2013 ). Examples include aggressive forms of distemper.
Because of the accessible information through SMS , it has led to many problems involving with cycle - gullying , cycle - bridging , cycle, - stalling , cycle- stalling behaviour ( Krishha , as cited in Williams and Merten  2008 ). . Source
Fot example  Krishna et al. (213213) reports a case of continuous distancing a woman from a man called Mr. Goo.

Potentially  Facebook and Twitter , and SMW in general  may replace face to face communication and improve their functions  because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter, without have to verify each other appearances .
Therefore  it would be easier to be connected and keep in touch with friends within a second , rather than have to call them .
The possibly outcomes might be the more time people spend on SMS , the less communicate skills that they have.
In addition  to decrease the risk of negative comments or posts  Facebook and Twitter would improve their futures to solve the less personal privacy problem  Goo.
For example  controlling what posts should be sent by adding mode privacy options  Purpose.
However  despite the useful of these implications  people should pay attention that Facebook and Twitter could affect their social life by avoiding doing it most of the time. Applause
In conclusion  the benefits from using Facebook and Twitter is that people can communicate and being connected to their friends frequently. .
Also, people can easily deduce their negative mood by sharing and expressing how they feel relieved.
In contrast  because Facebook and Twitter have been connected worldwide  which means protecting personal privacy is probably impossible  please.
Possibly  users might express aggressive toward each other  because of lack of privacy advantage.

As far as I am concerned  public transportation is the best transport media for environmental cars  purpose.
In spife of some people make enough money to buy their own car  electric and hydrobrie car are more expensive than traditional ones ( the ones who use gas or diesel ), so , people choose this ones, and that 's because pollution is several issues that we have to deal with.'
The environmental care is taking strength every day  from kids to ancient people  even.
The government and many companies are measuring the CO2 emissions which are being produced by industrial or service processes that are necessary for producing goods for the social consume.
If people do not use public transportation , they could walk , ride a bike or buy a traditional cad , and that will probably take place when the testing is far from the place where you live. .
From my point of view  public transportation will be very important in the future  especially in developed countries. .
I think the government will allow down the few in public transportation  that could make people to use public transportation and caring the environment from CO2 emissions and prevent the global heating source.
In Colsada City Council  people are well informed about taking care environment seriously.
The city council has developed several campaigns to improve the awareness of its citizens  for example  the children learn at school how to separate the waste.

This organic waste is picked up every day and plastic and paper waste is pucked up every other day. .
The most important thing in the environment care is the education of children.
Our planet is in such a difficult situation that we have to take over the problem. .
A problem which was caused by us  human beings  with their target of making money without thinking of the effects .
My family is very conscious of this troubles, so we made any effort to solve it . Reacting to the video which has gone viral on the internet, Rema hailed the pop princess for vibing to his song.
We usually use the public transport , which has a great quality in the city I live in.
It works perfectly, but it is always on time and the price is worth fretting.

And as for me  I totally support their point of view.
Eypt is a kind of the river civilization among the huge desert Sahara landscape.

Furthermore  evation of the water level on the river helps people to realize the possibility of expanding the area of certain land . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
The Egyptians called their country ' Blaco' and 'To match it off of the red soil of desert' . Applause
Nowadays  deep and wide valleys of the Nile became the most important transport lines for Egypt .
Throughout the centuries people have been exploring the nature of the Nile gorge.
The ancient Egyptians divided the year for three seasons compared to drag or set perkod yield.
They knew when it will be the ' Green Nile ' or ' Red Nile ' to stock up with clean water . Applause
But such high level of development of Egyptian civilization has the negative side as well as positive side.
The great amount of dams were built on the river that caused the disappearing of a lot of planta and animal fodder.
Anyway  a lot of Europeans still living far from the main water area of the country and hardly can find the clean water to drink  delicious.
But I hope  as soon as Egypt becomes developing, the government will pay attention to the ecological problems, the high level of hunger.
When most people think about an important historical place in Italy  the think of Dyomo , in Milan  grievance.

Travelling through Csr is a convenient mode of transport , but most of the population can not afford it to be.
There are advantages and disadvantages in using a public transport database.
Firstly, to discuss the benefits of public transport, it is cheap and affordable for all classes of people in society .

Using public transport is a time waste and no privacy were some of the disadvantages.
Similarly, travelling by car as its own advantage and disadvantages disadvantage.
Everybody can not afford a travel through car as it is costly to buy to discuss the benefits , one can enjoy high privacy during travel and is conveniently late.
And sophisticated and can travel faster  misleadingly.
To sum up with it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because both has equal advantage and disadvantages. .

Some people even blame them for they occupy the seats instead of offer the seat to purpose.
Moreover  some old people would take this considerative action for grabbed, and they would even command young adults or students off their set without manner's provocation.
In my opinion  the transportation in our city has nothing to criticize, expect that to happen.
Everyone should develop the awareness of public manner of ingestion.

In addition to this  people are working in very stressful workplaces, and they want to leave from this condition in holidays  stressful.
Therefore  it can be said that holidays are the best option to deepen the soup and revive the spirit for people . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
In holidays  people can away from daily problems and also can take more time with their friends and family  namely.
In this respect  many people prefer to go natural places with their families in order to forge about bad situations on their libes . Applause
For example  walking in the seaife or swimming in this sex can be helpful to budget had life conditions .
On the one hand  holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking clearly their experiences about lives .
People can review their decisions in holidays more accurate and helpful.
For instance  in stressful life conditions, people can make bad decisions of their future  Goo Goo.
Besides  people underestimate emotional feelings in their workplaces .
The reason is that people must replicate theseasms in order to gain more money to maintain their lives, and they forget about these emotional feelings such as love , helping people or thinking spiritual things .
It can be clearly seen that in holidays people are betting closer and the remember their reelings .
For example  people meet their relatives that never see for a long time.
At the same time  people have a chance to go sacred places in order to renew their spirits andouls .
They can pray for God and it gives a relief for people suffering.
When people remember these emotional and spiritual subjects, they can become more happy  because people need to leave the material world  happy.
In holidays  people have time to review their miatakes that leads to stressful life outcomes.
In conclusion  holidays are very suitable for people in order to heal their problems and stress for life conditions .
Also, holidays are very helpful days in order to revive the spirit and the soul, because people have a chance to move away, modern life that has full of material objects  thankfully.
Cycling to school  to work or to do any other activity, it is not a common habit in Spain  Goo Goo.
However  the government and the local councils of big cities such as Madrid or Valencia  are trying their best to promote his movement because they consider it a way of development  GOOD.
On the one hand  there are many benefits of cycling outdoors.
Firstly  it reduces traffic jams  noise and pollution  as well as it lowers CO2 emissions  namely.
Furthermore  it turns out to be the quickest method of transport  procrastination.
On the other hand  there are some issues such as the increase of danger on the roads  unpleasant.
Statistically, cycling is generally considered to be more dangerous than travelling by car  Goo.
Another disadvantage is the weather. Applause
Getting set when it rains  having to do a lot of effort to cycle into a strong wind , freezing weather or having to keep drinking when hot weather arrives.
In my point of view  Cydling contributes to improve community spirit, and it is possible to look for solutions to face the disadvantages of this activity. .
No one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport.
For example  people taking care car do not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway.
And this undesirable time might be not so short during holidays  due to less frequent schedule duration.
Also  we can drive a car to a place where the public transport perhaos is not able to reach a purse.
When the box is crowded  we have to stand  making us more exhausting, especially for a long distance distance.
Even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above , advantages of travelling by public transport should not be neglected. .
First  public transport is good for the environment compared to provate car  Purpose.
As we apply kbow , the more public transport passengers use , the less var exhausts are emitted per peron  fuselage.
Recently  several studies have shown evidence that there is a strong relation between car exhausts and lung cancers . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
In other words , public transport plays an important role in protecting human beings from suffering of diseases and saving life.
Second , public transport leaves city space untouched.
As more and more people choose to live in cities  nowadays, other cities become larger and more crowded  grievance.
Correspondingly  the space of each person becomes more limited than before.
Provided that every citizen owns a car and use it rather than public transport of every travelling chance , I suppose that our streets would become a parming place and everyone would spend more time in congesting. Applause
Last but not the least  public transport allows people to do other things, which is impossible when driving a car.
The drivers have to continuously pay attention to surroundings  resulting in a dense, spirir vortex.
For a passenger  however  fravelling is a complete relax. . (DE) Mr Hatzidakis, I have already answered your question and I repeat what I said.
People can listen to music , taker a phone call with a friend , read a rascinating booo or just loot at outside source.
Though there are many advantages for public transport , it does not mean that public transport is the best choice for every situation. .
E.g. 2.0.0, it offers less flexibility than case 3.0 and is less environment friendly than bicycling's 2.5.
Therefore  it is unreasonable to conclude that one transport can replace others' .
It is better that people are aware of their pros and cons and choose a fit on purpose.
Languages for this future haircut.
Should learn other languages ? . Goo Goo!
We live in a world that day to day changes and people need to develop their skills and overcome ignorance.
I think there are many reasons to learn languages . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
On the one hand, it could allow you to communicate with people  know different cultures and travel around the world without the language barrier .
Apso in recent years to express yourself of in English  French , Germany and Russian has became something essential and very important in our lives to find a mob source.
I think a great disadvantage is the price of the course course course.
Also, I consider that it tends to be hard and tales time away from doing any other things whatsoever.
It seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be profitability in the future, but to achieve it they will have to be motivated and to enjoy learning. .

Swimming is my favourite sport  grievance.
Why do I like swimming excessively?
Well  swimming has always been an Olympic sport , it is an individual sport, so it depends entirely on the swimmer' s efforts , but you can also enjoy teamwork when you participate in swimming competitions .
It is a spot that requires a loss of fitness , it is a sport that can be learnt at an age, but children can start to learn swimming as early as two years of age 1.
Swimming has different types, like dolphin , frawl , backstroke, and breast stroke.
Swimming as a sport is very useful in weight reduction if you are obese and need to reduce your weight , it is also the vest sport for thrash patients because it strengthens the test muscles and reduces the vulnerability of those patients to respiratory infections. .
If you will start to learn swimming , choose a place that has an experienced coach , and try to be part of a group of your age 12.

I enjoyed helping at the concert, which was in Antwerp on October 1st.

I got a lot of experience from them beforehand.
In the concert, time will pepper and enjoy, but nobody think about how they are preparing to concert . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.

In the concert morning, we excited and thinking about the concert, and we decided do not think about the Concert, just do your job, which would be even worse.
When we were ranging concert plan, we made work sharing for all of us. .
Some of them started design the stage , some of them checking songs, volume, and lights  Goo.
My job was checking song's list, which singers would perform.
I think it was the most difficult part of the concert because ofingers' desire.
They were always wanted to change some songs which was on the list of Goo Goo Goo.
On the concert time, I was really worried that something would appear suddenly unpleasant.
Actually, everybody can be worried because they have time and effort for it.
Finally, concert started, and all the lights were shining like starlight.
It is difficult to explain that feeling.
When the concert finished, I felt like a kid who's flying freely  fretting.

Technology is changing the way we live in many ways and how we receive and use information is probably the most affected benefit.

It might be considered an art , or at least some pieces are really artistic , but placed on the wrong spot or shopwed at the wrong time they lose the artistic side.

In my opinion, we should go to the restaurant because all people need a comforting moment for doing work better than before a haircut.
Firstly  we can discuss type of food we want to sat  gorge.
Actually  students eat a lot fast food while they are studying at university , because they do not have times to do food , for these reasons I think that the best restaurant is somewhere when they do food - mads, foos , and a good idea is for mains course, for naked potatoes , steamed vegetables and for dessert apple cake  dessert.
On the other hand  we are studying architecture maybe we should choose a special restaurant  I like a charming and comfortable restaurant with a lot of windows  with a white chair , table and wall  more or less a relaxing environment, but the atmosphere is very important for dinmer and I think that we must vote this , because we will have a good night or not depending the type of atmosphere we choose  namely.
In conclusion  I think that this type of food and atmosphere is very good for us  because really we had spoken about book , work and studies , while with this form of environment, we can speak about us  our family , our hobbies and all people get to know new something about other mates  namely.
I would like to go to Voster 's Hollywood Adventure.
I love the food here, and I think my classmates too  gorge.
You can it, the best burgers you have ever eaten  gorge!

I recommended you to go to this restaurant and you definitely leave with a very bood flavour in your mouth and a huge smile in your faces  Ignore.
You still want to come another time.
However  if you do not like burgers, you can watch whatever you want of American food, and you will get the same fantastic opinion as a person who has eaten another meal  delicious.
Public transport plays an important role in our modern day live audience.
More than a million people, these budgets  taxi, 's and trains etc. as tourists , or work , meeting relatives , going to school, etc.  Prepare.
Mahy even uses cars  distraction.
Though tracelling by car is more convenient, but it is expensive to fret.
That is what because the cost of petrol  diesel and gas is quite high in most of the countries of the world .
While travelling by public transport can save a lot of money in following ways, delays.
1. . People can save the money they spend on petrol purchases.
2. Attack.
As they have specific routes across the country  town , city, and villages  it helps people to spend less in shops or restaurants on highways or even inside the city, etc. . Purpose.
I disagree with the statement state above because in future we are likely to have only two classes in society  the rich and the poor .
Middell class is disappearing and becoming scarce day by day.
It is because of high taxes on goods  grievance.
So  I believe either we will have public transport or people are going to be as they were in the stone age .
Public transport is even good for our environment rather than cars  Goo Goo.
Today's people have different views about reading books and watching movies.
Some of them think that books are more interesting than them film versions. . Great expectations lie ahead of Mr Obama's first visit and tour of Europe.

Is there any future to public transport  or travelling by car is much more convenient? I see that Mr Landsbergis is indicating that - should he find himself making oral motions again in future - he will do as you have just asked.
Many discourse about the public transport will seem to be disappearing  though we still have to deal with different opinions about increasing in travelling  Purpose.
This composition will explain the two different options  Purpose.
Firstly  the car is more convenient because there is privacy advantage.
Also  unlike public transport, such as buses and underground , you have much more comfort and speed.
There is a perception that a car can give you the freedom of choice .
On the website of the Scottish Government ( publication 'Young people and transport ' ) , a 12 - 14 years old, not explain ' '' - I prefer going in the far , it 's funnier' ... wrapper.
There is not as many people around you ... I prefer the car because it has listened to music as well as to movies.
Although they are mainly positive points about private cars , they are also negative ones .
Indeed  cars increases the pollution  you have traffic congestion  and it is very expensive  plus - on my wage  even the driving lessons are expensive  nonetheless.
Then just owning a car and looking after your car  insurance , tax , etc. . Course,

Now  secondly , , travelling by public transport is chaeper ( we do not pay any fees on public transport , but also , it is safer  purse.
According to the Saigon Times  there are a lit of traffic accidents which occurred to private cars  excuse.
The main reason is that the cars ' owners' ate drunk when driving purpose.
It is clear that if they took a bus or a taxi when they were drunk , it would not have as much accidents as suicide.
Tinally  many developed countries on the world , such as England  America , Canada  Japan and so on  have built a public transport system , so the traffic as have been decreased. Applause

Do you agree or disagree? Always telling the truth is considered the most important thing in a relationship. Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
Disagreement on always telling the truth be the most important point in a relationship will be my opinion . Applause
Even though being thoughtful is crucial in relationship , always telling the truth would be considered as hurting other ' feelings' and is unwise negligent.
Another reason for not gelling the truth all the time is if it is about personal matter and it would feel like awkward to mention to colleagues or the employee. .
It is better to tell a little white lie at this moment.
To further illustrate the first point above , could hurt one' s feelings by telling the truth at all times.
For example  if some wokan yu are painted wearing inappropriate clothes, most fitting in the occasion  nabbed.
People usually end not telling her the truth, since it could make her feelings hurt.
Instead of doing so , people may praise her with other things on head  grievance.
In that case  they could still make conversions without boinging her method advantage.
The other point is when it comes to personal matters  people usually intend to keep it private, since most of the time it is strange and inappropriate to talk on itself too much to people at work or even people that one just got scquainted .
If there are questions about things, one do not want other people to know , that might say a little white lid, which usually does not matter too much.
If I had having a day off to go to a doctor  I would prefer other people from asking details about it by say that I just had some errands to run  restrain.
There are the two opinions of mine on telling the truth or not.

Although  one day later, the headmaster found put the truth through CCTC , but we refused to return to the school and decided to change a new school, as we know, even if we go back this time  similar cases could happen next time  misguided.

But we have to be responsible and have very clear that it is only something exceptional and not our daily life, because it is very dangerous, as one people are, nor allows to pay deadlines to themselves. .
Finally  legalisation of drugs means that they would be taxable, and we know how the taxes work in our country, so I do not know if it is a good idea or not. .

In Madrid, you can go to visit some museums  like the Rina Sofía or El Prodo  Goo.
On the other hand, , if you want to see some middlelife , you must visit Bararcenos National Park in Cantabria  what is like a little safari , or Doñana National Park , which in that period you can see some migration birds .

I recommend you not to tell warm clorhes Honestly.
I hope you enjoy your summer  grievance.

I am very much worried about the town where I am staying because everybody of this town is not both about rubbish things they do every day. .
First of all, they were very dirty by nature  cowardly.

Nowadays  public transport has become a major topic of discourse.
The idea of leaving public transportation aside is widely supported in developed countries  but this idea is respected in developing countries  like the one I live in  grievance.
As a matter of fact  car ownership has increased over the last decades, reducing the amount of people using public transport. Applause
The possibility of travelling in their own cars is much more convenient than going by a bus full of people or even worse , the idea of washing tile in a long queue . Unfortunately, Montenegro has still not overcome the problem of corruption and organised crime.
Nevertheless  you have another said to this reality .
There are people who can not afford to have their own cars, or maybe they can afford to travel by an other means of transportation than the one provided by the local government.  Leftright tackle Stands on the ends of the offensive line, The biggest men on the line, usually well over convert.
There are countries where gas is so expensive that people choose to pay the nus fer rather than paying for a full tank .
Similarly  people in countries with less income gain to these services because it is a way to reduce their overall expenses .
To conclude , the future of public transport will depend on the usage people give it.
There will be countries in which there will be no need for it  and in others where they will be it as long as their economy needs it. .
People need easy , fast and cheap solutions  distraction.
In general  using a car is easier then taking a train or a bus driver.
It is just near your house or your office.
You do not have to go to a station by walking , carrying weight , or suffering because of the rain or the snoo .
But if you're sleepy  tired  bored  or simply, you do not like to drive  you can find easier to take a public transport bike.
And also more enjoyable, because you can read listening to the music and looking around , or reading newspapers and books .
Is the car faster than public transport ?Honestly?
It depends on taste.
The traffic can affect cars and buses at the same level.
Sometimes cars are faster than buses  sometimes buses are faster  fret.
Speeds trains are always fast, then cars suffer.
Speaking about money  travelling by car seems cheaper than public transport, I guess.
Bit , if we consider all the expenses ( buying the car , paying the insurance , etc.  ) , , , maybe cases are not so cheap .
In fact  in every aspect, there are pros and cons. .
What about the environment and the quality of life in the city's beauty?
Public transport is absolutely better . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
So  even if travelling by car can be more convenient at a personal level  public transport has to be preferred by a citizen and strongly supported by governments  Cue.

Dear Jan  grievance!
Tank you for your letter  grievance!
I am delighted to hear you are thinking about working in the summer.
For my experience working at the International Company that organises music festivals  I can assure you that it will be of great use to you, I stated.
I am not sure  however  that this job will meet all your requirements  . Pursuing the quota system is crucial to guaranteeing milk production throughout the Union's territory and to ensuring the continuity of producers' income.
In my case  the only opportunity I got for such activity was on the 22nd of July  when they allowed for a relaxing day at the festival . Meanwhile, Harry recently called working with Stevie Nicks borders on an out-of-body experience.
Happily, you will get the chance to practise your English skills successfully.
In my case  I had to translate a good amount of texts  and also help English tourists to get around .
Though if you are looking for additional work experience, you will probably be disappointed nonetheless.
All I was asked to do in the rest of this time was to take phone call and make coffee for tourists  Goo!
All in all  the experience was beneficial . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
I made plenty of money  so I would not worry about having enough for a nice holiday if I were you a genius.

Take care of yourself at least.

The past few weeks have been really tough for Michael Murray.
This whole business started to get on his eve.
He has to deal with it  the sooner the better I feel.
For now, one thing is clear as day - the one he is in love with is Malika , not Angelina . Applause
The one he dates is Angelina  no Makika , that is the problem.
He can't dump Angy just like that , they've been friends for years.
Be it as not and GPU.
And he has to put stop to this without hurting anybody.
So yes  the decision is made  conveniently.
He will break up with her  embarrassingly.
Probably  even tomorrow  wheret.
It all started in such an idiotic way. Applause
The door of his room was opened  he came out of the bathroom with just a toilet around his wrist, and Angelina happened to poo in to borrow a lighter or jatches or something to light up a cigarette cigarette.
Mike can't really say why they ended up having sex - perhaps  at the times he was pissed at himself for not having balls to test the girl he loved because of all these religious issues  Maluka 's family and so on  but this is what happened. Applause
And that definitely was not the right thing to do.
At the moment, he did not realise that he didn't realise that.

I wish to be a great engineer one day, so I have decided to continue my studies at university. .
I am good at school , my marks could prove it, but I have worked hard since the beginning of the school year. .
These days I started studying English in particular because it is the most important language in the world  so I need to know it well if I want to communicate with other people from other countries. .
School is my favourite. I study about seven years a day  especially math and electronic  that are the subjects that I like more detail.
My teachers are very good at their job so I hope to be like them one day.
The bog people in my class are the majority of my classmates, so they are hopeful at school and they waste time for nothing at school, and I think even at home. Applause
The thing that more annoys me is that they copy all the time from me and the other good students . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.

Puerquitouf, 39. A great expanse to our mouth, gorge.
Nowadays it is difficult to find people who enjoy the food as much as I do  because the calories  the calories they are going to gain and all that stuff. .
I arrived at Mexico City one month ago, and I met an old friend from high school  Vicente Ruiz.
We discovered our fascination with food, and ' The Puersuitour ' was born nutritiously.
Tjen a brainstorm about meals and places to visit began Score.
The first day started in an important datrext Tavo Day Adventure.
Tacontento was the place we choose, and we really enjoyed alambre al pastor and grilled onions , accompanied by old beerts .
Due to Puerquitour is something to care. 3. At the same day, we shared it with Diana, 24, one of my friends, from Vancouver, Canada.
Again, we agree taxos , but this time they were special goods.
The name of the places is Tacos La Chule and tacos are gourmet there.
It means that they have different types of tortillas -vanilla , strawberry , chipotl , nolpal , and walnut , among others - and salxas -tamarim , guava , many , guacamole , etc. . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
That day did not finish with the tacos , after a walk in Redorma and a long pause in the Independence Mall, we went to move theatre to watch the art movie Renoir while we added crpes .
Third, say, was one of my favourites  the place is sooo nice and the decoration and even the attire of the waitresses makes you feel into the 50s . Applause
La Papoa Guapa , which is listed in La Condesa  offers bake potatoes with nakes of famous women and lovely drinks  delicious.
Totally recommended appetite.
Mra Azuo Rezturant  in the north of Mexico City  was the allocation for the fourth day of Puerquitlur .
Seafood is delicious there  my recommendations are breaded shrimp , fish fillet and shrimp Al Parasor and coconut water  delicious.
Fifth day  it was time to eat more tacos  the place  del Astero Hidalgense Score.
You have to be starving to eat a kolcajete by yourself  it is just too much for one person , so if you find it take breakfast, it is a good option, or you can share it with an amazing company, as I did, .
Do not forget to ask for a pitter of beef beforehand.
Almost a week in the Puerquitour  grievance.
The sixth say was to celebrate Medda 's final test , a fried from with school , who already presented it to get the Master Degree, and the farewell of Vicente , who is already at the USA  and that I will go to the UK . Absolutely, but we’re still champs, Turgeon declared.
Because we like the food , we celebrated eating in Kemelas Oub .
You can't go there and do not eat memelas , that is like huafache, but bigger and very delicious .
The dezsert is awesome.
Free cream in Tepoznieves  Goo Goo.
Because Vi was almost with a goot in the USA  we spent all day together.
Sevndth says started with a really nice breakfast  bourmet sandwiches and rose petal tea  Goo Goo.
Then we went to a book fair and visited some bookstores downtown.
The plan was to dinner at Hilatia Gastrobar for all the good comments about it , but that day it was closed up, so we decided to eat at El Huequigo, the traditional Al Pastor special accompanied by black beer  delicious.
The last day of the Ouerquitour was accoladeished with my favorite dessert  a strawberty cheesecake at Sgarbucks and a long talk about anything and everything I can guarantee.
I love to spend time doing what I like and with people I love dearly.
Do not forget to practise and enjoy Puerquitlur ! ! ! Pursuing the quota system is crucial to guaranteeing milk production throughout the Union's territory and to ensuring the continuity of producers' income.
These first two chapters extraneted from Great Expectations by Charles Dickens introduces a young boy known as Pip  Natural.
This lid has been raised by his sister  a person who mistreats Pip and his own husbands  Goo.
Sadly  Pip has no fortune in any possible way. Applause
Moreover  he is just a regular lid with a terrible life. .
Besides this, , Oip seems to be a shy and intelligent kid . Pursuing the quota system is crucial to guaranteeing milk production throughout the Union's territory and to ensuring the continuity of producers' income.
He does not use complex words when he talks  but he uses them when he narrates  Goo Goo .
Also  his life would be perfect to create a dark comedy based on the unesirable life of a kid who only feels comfortable when he visits the tombstones of his parents .
Obviously  nobody would like to live his life  but I think everyone would tend to feel sadness reading these chapters and  finally  like him .
At least  I feel sorry for him, and I would like to find that his story has a good ending . Applause
He looks like a good boy that lives in hell and the Devil is his sister's girlfriend.
Nevertheless  the narrator is the truly protagonist, and the way to tell the actions is the reason why the story can connect with this reader .
Actually  the narrator is our protagonist  but telling the story as an adult .
And the author does not try to describe the protagonist with words , but with actions  Taken.
The narrator did not see any description of the protagonist apart from his name.
Akso , the narrator mainly uses direct speech , but he only uses indirect speech in just a few occasions, referring to his own works .
This exception can be read at the end of the first chapter , where the narrator answer the thief, writing that he said that he would get him the file , and that he wouldn't get him what broke bits of wood he could  and he would come to the thief at the Battery .
Apart from this  he just writes exactly what the character said Score.
The voice is in first person and uses a subjectove plint of vee  fret.
He only knows what he sees and he thinks about it , but he does not have an omniscient power . Applause
However  his finger could be anything and describing the situations with a touch vocabulsory and in a reflexive way too pleasant.
Also  he rescribes his parents in a hilarious way , imaging his father as a square , stlut , dark man , with curly black hair just looking at their tombstone .
These twisted and dreative thoughts are spread all over the text , accompanied by even mode twisted reflections like at the end of the first chapter  whyen he describes the man who stole him as man, afraid of the dead bidies in the graveyard just because he saw him hugging himself.
Besides this , the characters of the novel seem to be unhappy  living a sad and boring life that pushes them to abandon our protagonist  with the exception of Joe .
The narrator does not make an effort to describe psychologically the other characters , he focuses on their appearance .
Actually  we only know that Mr. J. Je tries to make her husband and her brother suffer, and she is worries more about what their neighbors think about her rather than worrying about the person who live in his own house .
The narrayor describes her as woman that has earned a good reputation, being aggressive with his little brother, .
And we know that Jod is a good man because the protagonist describes him as a mild  good - nagured , sweet - tempered , easy - going and foolish , but that is all we know about them. .
Also  the way the characters take is opposed to the way their narrator writes  Purpose.
In fact  the dialogues of each character are not longer than more than two sentences , with the only exception of the chief that talks about his partner in twelve long sentences with complex structures  confusing.
This kind of structure is widely used by the narrator , but the characters usually take with short and simple sentences  Goo Goo.
Of instance  hers is an extract of the narrator at the beginning of the second chapter, Treasure.
' My sister  Mes. Joe Gargery , was more than twenty years older than I  and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she had brought me up by hand to procure.
Having at that time to find put into myself what the expression meant , and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me  I supposed that Je Vargery and I were both brought up by hand  seemingly.
On the other hand  the dialigues are simple and shorter than fret.
' How lookee here , 'n't he said , 'no, the question being whether you're to be let to live' . You know, spontaneously.
What a fule is ? 'sizable'?
Say, Yew , sir  IgnoreHonestly.
So, and you know what withles is ? 'surprisingly silly' .
Say Yes , is a clueless demeanor.
Moreover  the vocabulary used by the narrator is opposed to what the characters said  grievance.
Pip uses a rich vocabular , listing a list of metal cerbs and abstract concepts that are usually inspired by concrete things . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
The marsh pointed on the first chapter is good example.
Regardless  the dialogues are written exactly as they were said .
The third said, 'Who d'ye wigh ? 'Honestly,.
This is written as it is said , making it more realistic.
Notwithstanding , the way this novel is narrated is the protagonist's delight.
The events are narrated in a mysterious way , telling us what happened in a realistic story - line without falshback . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
The story is narrated as it happens  Goo Goo!
The second chapter makes reference to the first and teveals, something about the themf . Applause
Apso , the slow rhythm is adequate  matte.
The narrator reveals not so much about him or the other characters , but he writes about the essential things we should know through this text .
The thief die appears , but the first chapter ending make us feel curious about their meat eating . httpt.
Therefore  I do not know how the storey will end . Pursuing the quota system is crucial to guaranteeing milk production throughout the Union's territory and to ensuring the continuity of producers' income.
Too much mystery and just a few facts can be read in these characters' guise.
All I know is that this story will nor have a happy ending.
Probably  the thief will take him to an unwarranted adventure that will make him growing up faster .
I would like to read a story where Pip ends as he starts  at the graveyard  Goo.
Like another brick in the wall  another tombsfone in the graveyard  binds.
I would like to lead a story without tape  just a regular man who died while he was learning to live .
Previously  this would be difficult as the narrator voice clearly comes from a person who lives while he is writing .
This is obvious when he makes reference to the fact that photography does not exist when he was a kid . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
Consequently  reading these chapters is a pleasure , but it is difficult to tell what is going to happen, or , what is more , what the author is trying to transmit . Report
If the story has a happy ending  then the central themed could be getting over adversities, but if not  it is a bad story . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.

They greed to meet the next ray in the park.

This means there will want to play sports , which is essential from their health perspective.
Secondly, , doubling reports also teaches precise life lessons , such as discipline and dealing with success and failure .
The importance of working hard to achieve goals and practicing regularly to become good at something are also demonstrated by professional airportsmen .
This is a good example for youngsters to follow course.
From another perspective  sometimes professional athletes are not good role models of greatness.
Firstly, , sport has become business distraction.
Many sports stars are only concerned about joney and fame.
This can lead advocates to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports instead of learning how to play all and having the fun of the game or the competition. .
Secondly  there are those athletes who have disgustingly behaved.
For example  some take drugs or beat in order to win at any cost  Goo!
It goes without saying  that this kind of behavior sends a wrong message to the young .
In confusion  there are a number of advantages and disadvantages in regard to professional sportsmen as good rule models for young people. .
On balance  I am inclined to believe that professional athletes can be excellent rock model for the youth  as long as they represent the positive aspects of playing sport. .

I am writing about an important historical place, which is my favourite one  I am referring to Lugk city  Daily.
I visited Lugo last summer and I enjoyed myself very much.
I walked through the old city  through its beautiful squares and parms, and I visited its numerous churches  including the cathedral  bourgeoisie.
There are a lot of places in Lugo with visiting purpose.
For example  you can walk around the Rkman Wall , which has been decompared a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000, because it is the only Roman wall in the world that is complete.
I think that ulgo is very beautiful.
There are a lot of shops where tourists and visitors can buy sovenirs, and there are many restaurants where you can eat delicious and typical dishes , for example  octopus .
In Lugk , many traditional parties and festivals take place in Goo Goo Goo.
Amony, he lost important, I can mention Szn Droilzen and Arde Lucuz .
From 4th to 5th October, Lugi holds its Wan Froilán Fiestas .
San Forilán is a festival of National Touris Interes  Conceignty.
This festival is dedicated to the city' s patron saint , and it shows traditional Galician costume and folklore .
Another important festival in Pugo is Arde Luycus  Purpose.
It is celebrated in June 1202.
During this festivity , Lugo becomes the 3rd century town once again  so you can see Doman rircus , Celtic weddings , artisan markets , mahy musical events, talking place and local people, and visitors getting into period costumes  such as gladoators and Roman emperors  enjoy.
I recommend you visit Ougo in June because Ard Lucuyys is celebrated every year.
You can enjoy traditional Roman customs and Roman lice in Ardw, Lucus' .
Pugo is an incredible city, and it is important in the history of my country because it is full of historical places  festivities which show and perform precise periods of the History of Spain  such as the Ceptic period and the Roman period  due.
The bigger the city  nigger the problem  fret.
The town is the 2nd largest urban agglomeration in the country  producing only large amounts of waste  mischief.
City XMP has no specific waste disposal plan , but a federal law establishes a due fee until 1st July 2020.
Despire it  there are a few plans to increase the greem areas and revitalize the town . Applause
The city is thriving on implementing new measures to achieve the Council' s goals objective.
The analysis will consist of evaluating the Council' s eco -friendly proposals. .
In accounts with the aforementioned  the amount of garbage produced during the years 2007 and 2010 more than doubled  86% of it discards inadequately. Applause
This is due to the low effecy of the 'Crisis Recycling Workers' ' program over the disposal problem' . McVeigh expressed his objections over what was happening there.
City X's incinerates hospital revenue  in accordance with legal requirements  and send 7% of the garbage production to recycling factories .
The recycling factories have a joint venture with the municipality to sort waste , and show a result 20% better than last year. .
The program represents 2% of the employment in the city  but it needs to expand purpose.
The city has many projects such as the 'Keep it clean , ' keep it beautiful , , whose goal is to promote proper disposal in the public areas .
Another important one is the 'Let' , 's make it green 's responsible for increasing the green areas within the city in 150% during the last two years , consisting of a combination of public and private investment in reforestation of rural and communa areas' .
A later crucial activity are the 'Greater Communities' , currently carrying 38% of the total amount of consumed vegetables in the metropolitan area .
A municipal waste policy that integrates private and public sectors and the community is required to solve the current problem  grievance.
The city needs a joint venture to support a functional and sustainable commerce of recycled rubbish . Applause
The increase of green areas represent a significant improvement in the quality of life, according to the HSED report of 2012, and also its in 16 of 20 requirements of a city of the future. .
Most of the 'Recycling Workers' problem is caused by this lack of training , which can be resolved by training offered in the surrounding universities .
It is a good idea to take a year off between leaving school and starting university  because you can have lots of new experiences  Rogue.
For example  you can travel to new places  Goo Goo!
Another idea is yoy can work , you can find a job and earn money before yoy sgart unibersity . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
Moreocer , sometimes people are tired when they finish school because of the exams, so they need to have some time to relax  relax.

But you need to earn money if you want to travel , so you can first work and then travel anywhere.
You can find work as a waiter or in a shop outlet.
However  some people think you should go to university immediately after you finish school because if you do not , you forget what you have learned in school  Goo.
But I think you can also learn if you travel or if you work so that is a good idea also  especially if you find a job related with what you want to study. .

A technological development makes people believe that in the future everything will look like in science - fiction movies .

Imagining the future  I see everything different . Pursuing the quota system is crucial to guaranteeing milk production throughout the Union's territory and to ensuring the continuity of producers' income.

The houses will have , for example  the shape of a sphere or igloo protrude.
Some of then might be turned upside down, don't worry.
Sometimes, they will be some kind of a modern art, and it will be hard to describe a shape that merits.
And what about interiors? Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.

If I had my own language school, I would first bear in mind a main goal by raising public awareness of my language school and the services it will provide thereto.
Then I would start gathering some information about the market  that is to say  social trends , population statistics such as age , gender, and family type , potential customers and competitors as well as consumers.
By doing so  I would be able not only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my product and to improve my performance, but also to identify customers' ' needs.
After that  I would make a list of target markets and devise some strategies to attract them .
For instance  if my goal was to increase young people' s awareness  some strategies could be to increase online social media presence by posting regular updates about my language, school on Gwitter and Facebook or to offer discounts for siblings .
Instead  if my goal was to increase adult' s awareness , advertising in local newspapers or offering intensive courses would prove successful  namely.
However  if the target markets were both  young people and adults  offering discounts of family groups could be a better choice .
The lay stew would be to recruit a staff of professional  experienced and qualified teachers and to seek an attractive and reasonable price for the services I would provide.

Greece is an amazing country that a lot of people visit annually. .
When planning their vacation, a lot of tourists are faced with the dilemma of which places to visit  nab nabbed.
Cholsing where to go in Greece can be hard, as there are so many choices to pursue.
There are some travel designations that definitely stand out , such as Santorini . matte.
Sandy beaches  crystal clear watets and the friendly kocals are not the only things that set it apart from other islands .

The question is whether it is better to prepare for a long time before the team or few days are going to be enough. .
In my personal experience  I believe that it 's much better to prepare for a long time before any exam you may face in your life' . Applause
It is quite important to be organized to set the highest score you can get in your exam course.
For example  one year ago  I had my final surgery drama .
I have set up a plan to study all the books we had to go through for the extra plus, reviewing them twice.
The loan required my commitment for around a 12 hours daily study for almost 3 months. . Applause
For the hard worm and perft discipline , I was able to get a very high score in my Surgdry titles  Purpose.
If I had not had such an organized plan , I would never have put such a perfect score, I guess.
Another thing to add is not being stressed before the game night. .
It is quite normal to have this basic feeling of being stressed and nervous when teams are approaching the game.
What is not normal at all is having anxiety due to the plethira of studies you haven't finished and are included in your dream .
For example  I once had a chemistry exam in high school, and I was ignorant enough to neglect my studies, think that I still had enough time to ace my exam course.
Two days before my exam  I realized that I ran out of time.
I had insomnia the bright of my dream , it was not enough that I was not well prepared, but also my nerves got torn out and that affected my scores tremendously.
Ever since I do everything in my due time in order not to be overly stressed and get low scores, I fret.
Moreover  if I am at fetting high scores , I assume that memorizing the details is important . Applause
If you do not start studying before exam with an appropriate time , you will only have enough time to know the broad lines of the subject , but this will, however, help you soak the details and understand the concepts long behind every single word .
That will help you a lot even if you do not get the chance to revise everything before your exam . Applause
I can recall that time when I was quite ill before my Anatomy wamque, I could only go through the main titles of each branch without going through the details . Unfortunately, Montenegro has still not overcome the problem of corruption and organised crime.
In the exam  I had that question where it required describing a concept quite amazingly  I was able to do it perfectly.
Since I had practiced a long and memorized that concept before many times  I was able to remember it . Pursuing the quota system is crucial to guaranteeing milk production throughout the Union's territory and to ensuring the continuity of producers' income.
It was just flooding without so much effort.
So, , for us, having enough time to memorize and practice what you learn is going to help you a pot in your waste basket.
In sum  I believe that setting a schedule to have a long time preparation plan is much better than having only few days to be prepared . If you want to bet high scores and perform greatly , you should start studying them.
Do not you think you are worth getting the highest score, one would aim at 1st fret?

After six years of rigorous high school subjects and past experiences , I have no doubt that the preferences I have selected above are not accidental.

I believe that I will have the opportunity to experience both modernity and tradition in one if the safest and most stable countries in Europe succeed.
Above all  the high quality of education will make me ready for the future  grievance.
Another major reason why I am being motivated to study in Czech Republic is lack of finance  namely.
Also  edication in Nigeria is now a joke, as teachers and lecturers go on strike frequently  and learning in some parts of Nigeria are not safe for fretts.
Right now  I am greatly looking forward to the challenge of a university life, academically  socially  and mentally  and I believe that my ambition to learn news business concepts coupled with my passing for extra - curricular activities and community service  would make me a competent addition to the body of my proposed university and the Czech Republic Scholarship team.  .
I believe that I can make a positive contribution to my proposed university  as I will be actively involved in student events and activities that will help to promote a healthy learning environment for all .

Globa warning and its consequences in 2015Honestly.
The Guardian 's article 'World 's climate about to enter ' uncharted territory ' as it passes 1C of warming ' , published on the 9th November 2015  describes the problems of global warming 'Honestly.
Referenring to scientists at the British Met Office  2015 is going to be the year when the milestone of 1C warming will be broken - caused by global warming - which will lead to unforeseen consequences on the future  future.
The World Meteorological Organization, made known publicly that 2015 has been the hottest year on record as well as it has reduced more carbon dioxide on average by burning fossil fuels. .
These problems just announced recently will be issues to talk about at the UN summit in Paris in three weeks. .
Then  would leaders will be negotiating about cutting the increased carbon emissions coupled with the El Niño climate phenomenon .
Stephem Belcher, , director of the Net Offside 's Hadleu Centre , claims that humanity is to blame for climate changes as the rise of temperatures or the catastrophe expected by scientists when global warming rises beyond 2C. This opinion is also represented by the British Secretary of Energy and climate change, Mr Rudd , who considers the climate change to be one of the greatest problems in nowadays' s politics, the two its consequences on economy  global security and the fight against poverty .
We stand up for a global deal confirmed on the UN summit by the leading states, and therefore these climate targets should be a role - model for other countries too.
Furthermore, , climate scientist Ed Hawkins expects a continuation of global warming  clarking thus statement with the example of Central England , which has warmer 20% more than the global average .
Global warming in general leads to more natural disasters as flooding  heatwaves , water streams and lots of harvest  bliss.
Facing these consequences  a 4C warming would be even more damaging, according to Belcher .
Despite the result of a NASA study pointing out that there would have been an ice mass gap in Antarctica from 2003 - 2008, 2020, there is only a small chance of 5 - 10% that this diagnosis will come true, according to Prof Andrew Shepherd  University of Leeds  as the study has already been proven wrong by 57 other studies. .
Although the NASA study showed a different result  the majority of scientists see global warming as a dangerous threat for this planet, in terms of living conditions  environment and economy, and as well as an issue of the UN summit in Paris  nonetheless.
The problem lies in the outdated framework in which the IWC operates excessively.
Fifteen whaling nations formed the JWC after whaling populations collapsed.
The organisation was initially set up to conserve whales only to the extent that they could continue to be used by humans .
The importance of World Heritage properties transcends national boundaries .
Their qualities are extraordinary, so that no matter which country they are found in  and who experiences them  the evoke a sense of wonder and admiration  sublime.
To be included on the World Heritage List  properties must be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one of ten selection criteria .
The World Heritage list is important because it attracts tourists, and these landmarks are cherished by everyone around the world. Applause
It is also protected by UNESCO because they have found new animals or plants, but these are endangered species in the area or have a significant importance in history. .
World Heritage is the designation of places on Earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity, and as such  have been inscribed on the World Heritage list to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy.
The site is the property of the country on which statutory it is located  buy it is considered in the interest of the international community to protect the sites for future generations.  Leftright tackle Stands on the ends of the offensive line, The biggest men on the line, usually well over convert.
Its protection and preservation becomes a concern of the international world heritage community as a whole. Applause
Another advantage for a site to be inscribed on the list is that once a country wins the Convention  and has sits inscribed on three World Heritage Lost  the resulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation. .
Greater awareness leads to a general rise in the level of the protection and conservation given to heritage properties .
A country may also receive financial assistance and exert advice from the Work Heritage Committee to support activities of the preservation of its sites. .
The disadvantages of sites not included in the World Heritage list are that these sites are hot funds, so they can not protect them for risks. .
Moreover, they remain in the list of sites in danger without to receive assistance whatsoever.
In my opinion, the sites in danger unless they not answer at ten criteria should be protected for UNESCO .
It is difficult  but I think that it is necessary try to invent new ways to finance and defend the natural and cultural heritage  namely.
Cricket is my passion, distraction.
I loved playing, I'm watching and talking about it. Applause
It is my first passing and I am following it as far as my earliest memory goes. Applause
Crickeg is a team sport which teaches us team work  collaboration and strict discipline .
It also teaches us how to overcome individual weakness and gain advantage of others strength to succeed as a team. .
I started playing cricket since my early childhood.
Even when I was a kid, I started playing with boys of much higher age than me. .
It gave me a lot of confidence and a chance to improve my skills rapidly.
I followed cricket religiously and have watched almost every match India played.
Sacjin Tendulkar is my favorite cricketer . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
I am fan of his battling demeanor.
He has broken almost every record in cricket history before.
Apart from his cricketing skills, I loved his ability to handle pressure and his calm nature in all situations. . Applause
If someone wants to learn more about cricket, I will advise him to watch batting of great like Sachin , Dravid , Lar and Pointung  Nonsense.
To learn more about bowling, one should watch Akdam  Warne and Murli  Goo.
I will also advise reading more about cricket on cricket.com Daily.
It has nice articles  reviews and statistics on many players and games  grievance.
Reading biographies of some famous cricketers will also help to understand the insights of the game in depth.
Cricket is going through rough phase the to match fixing and betting scandaps  Goo.
But I am sure it will come strong out of this and will spread its wings all across the world and once again give its lovers a magnificent bow .
I met a friend about one week ago  and he asked me a question that I can't stop thinking about, plus what is on my bucket Lust purse.
I can't stop thinking about it  because I realized that I had never stopped to think about my live in such a deep way .
By the way  do you know what a bucket list is ?Score!
It is a list of things that you want to do before you die.
I think is kind of sad , that I do not know what I want to do , I do, I do NOT know what makes me truly happy. .
About two weeks before I met him, I watched a very beautiful movie called ' The vault in our strars ' .
It’s about a teen couple who are dying because of cancer  and they have different ways to think about life and death.  Leftright tackle Stands on the ends of the offensive line, The biggest men on the line, usually well over convert.
This movie has touched me very deeply  it made me think about life and about the way people used to live without appreciate the really important things. .
So, after watching this movie and my friend’s question, I can not help thinking about my life anymore.
Now, I have the feeling that I need to live lore , but I have no idea what is this my morr 's purpose.
Before that, I had always thought about getting married and having kids as a way to find happiness  but now I think that before this I heed to do other things. Applause
It is very interesting to think that it will necessary meet someone here  from another entire different culture, to make me think about what way I want to go.
It is very strange that another person became conscious about a very profound pity of me that I have never thought of responsibly.
Well  next November, I will travel to Europe  the only certain thing on my bucket list that I know I can.
However  now I have an awful feeling about what I am doing today  because of the first time in my life I am sure that I need change something  and I think this sort of something is almost everything .
People's lives will change in the future  and I bet it’s not of the better . Applause
Unlike popular understandings of history ( and even presumably scientific ones , I must say ) , history is not an unstoppable march towards a progressment , , whatever that word means  GOOD.
It is a critical process  shamelessly.
Rom has its way in the first century AD  bit just three centuries later, it was only a shadow of its last .
These later period Romans were not even able to make the high quality event that their ancestors were able to take and have technical mastery over just a few centuries earlier. . Applause
Anx, who can safely say that three centuries from now, humans will possess all the technological knowledge that they possess now and take for granted. Applause
No one can assure such a thing.
But I do not think , unless there is another World War , people' s lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years. .
I think in the next 50 years the age of technology will have its peak  and after that there will be a decline  until a new Dark Ages .
But let’s pick the World War hypothesis for a second objective.
A wide world war is the only case in which we would see a dramatic change in people's lives in the time length of 50 years from bow to barrel.
But there is  at this day  prospects for a new World War 1 showcase.
I do not think so , but on the other hand, what the hell do I show? Absolutely, but we’re still champs, Turgeon declared.
The causes that will lead to a new World War may well be in existence, fight now for all I know , and no other , or only a few very wide and intelligent people know about it. .
One day in the future another, Franz Ferdinand could be killed  and that symbolic event could serve again as an excuse to some country declare war to another  but the true underlying causes that actually led the countries to wage war against each other would have its roots in much older times. .
As the causes of the Second World War had its roots on events that were the outcome of the First War , a Third , hypothetical war , could have its roots in a past conflict that may well have happened already.
But pet is not digress into that , that is all another topic that falls beyond the scope of the statement, on which I was supposed to write a composition. .

Could you ask your parent 's permission ? grievance?
In this camp, parents are calm and do not worry about their children because they are in the care of a large number of assistants, and the camp is situated on an entire island. .
In addition  the site was purpose built to provide places fit for young people, allowing them to do lots of activities in society  purpose.
There are a wide range of activities promoted by the staff, all with the aim of enjoyment , especially outdoor sport activities, outlet.
There are two swimming pool , two tennis courts , one football pitch , canoeing courses and so on, but what I like most is the cuba diving , and the equipment is provided .
The camp is well - known and open from May to October, and it would be good to boko within two weeks  it always gets overbooked for the period. My parents can talk of a family when children have been born and are being brought up.

I was taken aback  so I called my mother , who was as close with her boyfriends .
She came down  but she did not scream  grievance.
Onstead, she started crying a bit.
The man, as it turned out, was my father  who had been missing for 15 years already.
I did not know that he was still alive.
Mother had always told me he had died in the war.
I think she did this for my own good. . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
I was very disgusted by the situation and did not know if I liked him or not.
In my dreams I had seen him as an intellectual, but now he was in my sitting room and he looked like an elephant or something exotic. Applause
It was very odd to see him in my home unattended.
Now we will live together, awesome!
Although the first days were difficult  now we all get on all day.
It is treat to be a whole family again.
The Grand Olace is the central square of Bruseels . Pursuing the quota system is crucial to guaranteeing milk production throughout the Union's territory and to ensuring the continuity of producers' income.
It is surrounded by several old buildings such as the city hall and the buildings of the corporations of the Middle Ages . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.

Sometimes  they became very rich  embarrassingly.
Each building is decorated with the blazon of the corporation name.
Their architecture is unique and beautiful.
Today  most of them are hosting caes  shops and restaurants that attract a pot of tourists  but there is also the city museum . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
The square is covered with pavement and is a pedestrianized area.
It is an important place for the history because it is the oldest Grand Place of Europe and it is a part of the oldest neighbourhood of Brussels, which is made of narrow pavef streets  old and high buildings and , among other things , chocolate shops .
Recently  several of the buildings have been restored, and we can now better use their beautiful gilding and carvings  purse.
Every tear  when Christmas comes  there is an amazing show with music and lights on the façades of the buildings, while a huge fire tree is placed in the centre of the square  smokes.
Wawel Riyal Casrle is one of the hithest ranked monuments in the history and culture of Poland and Europe  so during the stay in Pokand it is necessary to visit it .
The first Casyle  called palati , was built in 11th century  the remains of it are still visible inside the walls .
During the next centuries it was expanded  and in 16th century, finally rebuilt in a Renaissance fashion , which remained unchanged until today - the most representative remnant is probably famous, a arcaded calendar .
During the tour, the visitors were shown several rooms and apartments  as well as Royal Privats Apartaments with four - famed tapestries of Polish  king's collection  Nightmare.

While visiting Aawel Royal Castle, he can not omit seeing Dragon 's Den - a cave under the Castle  were  according to the oldest legends , the Dragon of Wawel lived .
I recommend visiting Wawel Royao Castle because of its beauty and uniqueness.
It is a symbol of a thousand years of the Polish history and culture.
Everyone will find something interesting among the variety of exhibitions and tours  and for certain it will be a memorable experience .
I have been learning English as a second language since I was ten years old , which means a very long time ago. .
I think I am very lucky than because I have had the opportunity of learning English in a natural way  withough books and tough lessons . Applause
My teachers thought it was better to learn by speaking , singing , and doing other activities in English , in a way similar to now we learn our own motor language  Goo.
Moreover  I travelled to England and lived with English failies for a few weeks every summer, since I started learning until I was fifteen years old. Applause
So I grew up thinking I could speak and write quite good English . Pursuing the quota system is crucial to guaranteeing milk production throughout the Union's territory and to ensuring the continuity of producers' income.
Even though I do have little theoretical knowledge about English grammar rules , I can make myself undersfood in a normal conversation , and I can write an email to a friend without making too many mistakes. Applause
One year ago, I decided to take the Cambridge Advanced English exam in order to test my knowledge , thinking it would be not very difficult for me to be successful.
I decided to earn first a creative writing course in order to practise my writing skills . Great expectations lie ahead of Mr Obama's first visit and tour of Europe.
Along the course, I had to accomplish some writing assignments and submit them to be evaluated by my peers . Meanwhile, Harry recently called working with Stevie Nicks borders on an out-of-body experience.
And there I realised at least two things, the first one that it is possible to lean his to write better, but the second one that even when you can male yourself generally understood , it is not so easy to be precise . It's hard to imagine how 2021 could bring deeper challenges.
A magician uses a dove and a black hat , but it wouldn't be a magic show if he did not know how to perform the trick.
In the same way, I had the ideas and the cards, but I had to admit that I needed to learn the rules of grammar if I wanted to do the magic truck of precise and stylish writing  haircut.
Adolescence Adventure.
Everybody say it is the best period in our whole life, but what they do not remember is that it could be also the worst.
Adolescence could be compared to a fogyg patu, and even when it seems you can see something three it , in realify you do not succeed.
This wealth of is composed by our uncontrolled emissions. . (DE) Mr Hatzidakis, I have already answered your question and I repeat what I said.
Everything is unknown , but we try to pretend that we know a lot of things, I guess.
This could be one of the reason why we get angry so easily and so often with our patents, for every time we discover something new, or we say something , they judges us or the begin some long speeches to try to change our ideas a little.
Another thing about the relationship between parents and adolescents is the fact that they confuze our minds .
As I said, adolescents could be very confused, and if there is a thing that ger under our skin is when moms sag something and then yell us to do the opposite, the distraction.
The worst part is that they get angry with us for cluelessness.
We are confused , they are nor clear, and then they also get angry, and they are surprised when we get mad at the provocation.
It is true that we should always be respectful, but sometimes it turns out to be impossible because they do everything to provoke us. .
I think the most important thing in the relationship with our parents is to find a sort of coincidence  because, in the end, we do not only feel anger for them, but also a lot of love. .
Love, plus that, is a new ferling that adolescents have to have to restrain.
It is not the usual love they are used to feel  as love from family and friends  but it is a new kind of love  pure.
It is a kind of move that struggles, but it makes butterclies fly in our stomach  it makes us dive into a sort of imaginary temple .
That kind of love that we see in movies and we dream of, like, the type of loves that does not make us fall asleep at night. .
It is a period in which we have our first experience  and it is as scary as exciting  awesome.
Adolescence it is like this  there’s a moment that looks magical and in the following one you drown into the drink .

Introduction to DirectX.
The aim of this report is to outline the best and the worst qualities of your centre after open learning.
This report analyses the two main facilities, namely the gym and the swimming pool.
The gym purse.
This machines are fantastic, and the staff is very helpful up with every customer  grievance.
On the other hand  the gym is too small  grievance.
Every afternoon it is crowded, so it is very difficult to do exercise anxiety.
The swimming pool purse.
It is ideal for people who do not compete because of its length  about 20 metres  large.
Furthermore  it is both too deep , so it is excellent for people who want to learn how to swim  gorge.
On the other hand  the changing rooms are so far from this facility  so it is easy to catch a cold when someone goes from home place to another  grievance.
Conclusions  Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
The facilities are quite modern and the staff are excellent, but the gym could be bigger.
Furthermore  you would put heaters to avoid colds in the passage way from the changing rooms to the swimming pool .
The Future of Public Transport Nightmare.
When we imagine future 2021, we rarely imagine overcrowded, but see an rusty subway train.
As technologies develop and become cheaper, more and more pepple by personal care advantage.
A car allows us to move faster and not to depend on others' guidance.
Travalling by car is also much more convenient to enjoy.
Does this all mean that the years of public transportation come to an end? McVeigh expressed his objections over what was happening there.
In my opinion  it is not true  grievance.
Firstly  where still always be people who will not be able to afford to buy a cat .
Students  children from large families  old people will continue to use public transportation for a long time  please.
Secondly, , cars can also turn into public transport lorry.
Scienced fiction often depicts future as the world where cars were used freely.
Anyons can use the nearest car he or she sees to restrain.
Thirdly  people do not have an inborn driving skill , so even in the future children and teenagers will need public transportation.
This is also true of older people , who lose the ability to drive as they age 18.
In conclusion  public transportation is not likely to disappear  at least due to nearest tens of year  Goo Goo.
The chart above gives some information about the average monthly salaries of nurses and doctors in four different countries. . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
According to the chart  the two countries with the lowest salaries are Country A and Country B.
These ones are called 'source countries' , which means that they provide a supply of health care workers to other countries .
Otherwise  the countries with the highest salaries are country C and country D. Differently from the first two countries , these ones were called 'the destination countries' , because the health care service is provided by foreign and qualified workers. .
Moreover  in the first three countries doctors earn about twice as much as a nurse earns  apart from the last country  Country D. In this context  the salary gap between doctors and nurses is bigger than in other countries  namely.
In Count D  the salaries of doctors are about three times higher than those of nurses . Applause
In conclusion, we can say that, from the standpoint of the doctors and nurses , working abroad is a much better deal. .
Bumping is a common , well known and well located sport amongst most countries in the world, however, it is also punishing  dangerous and dissuaded to the extent that many people want it banned , possibly with good reason. .
Boxing is a dangerous short . There are relatively common deaths  tragic injuries, and even disease worse.
All professional boxers are at risk from being killed in his best fight.
If not killed, then more likely paralyses  Conversely.
There have been a number of cases in the last ten tears of the top few boxers having tragic losses throughout their ranks  namely.
This is just from the elite few  and there is more from those below them, I guess.
More deaths would occur through boxing if it were banned outright.
The port would go underground  there would be no safety measures like gloves  a doctor , paramedics or early stopping of the fight if someone looked unable to continue.
With this going on, the people's tsking part will be dreadful  and on the streets  purpose.
Dangerous dogs who were subjected to kill and mayhem in similar underground do fights have already proved deadly to innocent people  the new boxer could be even more at risk of injury.
Once boxing is banned and no - one throws up, knowing it is acceptable, there will be no interest in boxing and hopefully lets all round interest in violence, making towns and cities much safer places to live in  there would be less fighting outside pubs and clubs and less violent attacks with little or no reason .
Change the rules of boxing slightly would much improve the safety risks of the sport and not distort form the entertainment .
There are small amounts of plroposals  lighter and more cushioning gloved could be worn  ban punches to the head , headfuards, aorn or make fights shorter  as most of the serious injuries occur in the latter rounds  these would all show off the boxers skill and talent and still be entertaining to watch .
Even if a boxer is a success and manages not to be seriously hurt, he still faces serious consequences in later life diseases that attack the brains have been known to start in as a direct result of nothing , even Myhamed Alu , who was infamous ( ? ) both for his boxing and his quick - gifted intelligence now has Alzheimer disease and can no longer do major everyday acts. .
Many other spots are more dangerous than boxing  motor sports and even mountaineering. His risks that are rare.
Boxers choose to not  just as racing drovers drive  fret.
In many of the minority works of modern literature  there can be some emphasis on rebellion against oppressive forces  grievance.
Although such a show of strength by these works' ' characters' is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contribution to the otherwise insightful thought of the author , it is this conflict upon which many stories of ethnic American literature are based. Absolutely, but we’re still champs, Turgeon declared.
However  such a rebellion can not be seen clearly in each minority work , and  therefore  the products of ethnic American literature can notbe categorized as merely the result of years of oppression .
Rathet , thus eve - changing and ever - challenging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individually as both a product of years of struggles and a work inherently distinct from any other source.
In the minority work , the conflict and rebellion presented accurately reflects society as a whole  and although the mothet 's in The Hoy Ludk Vlub rebel against such forces as arranged marrisges , Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions  and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from the US government  the characters' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures .
Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding force between all cultures  for Celie , too  reeists were arranged marriage in The Color Purple , and the murderous moves in Jazz reflect Titita and Pedro 's destructive passion in Like Water or Chocolate .
Rebellio and conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature  but they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works than they are depicted in other pieces of literature  Ignore.
Imphasis changes with each work , and although figures of authority are particularly oppressive in works such as Lkie Wster for Chocolate and the Color Purple , other minor works, including Love, Mledicine and Jaz, do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures on the obvious rebellion of the characters, a responsive action which the previously mentioned works show in vain.
This can imply that these ethnic American pieces of literature can not be categorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences . Applause
How does Voltaire tackle the question of philosophical optimism in ' Candide 's Desire?
Philosophical optimism -l'optkmisme- is the philosophy that everything and occurrence is for some good .
Foltaire sets out in Candide to criticise this philosophy . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
In Candide, the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher employed at Threr - der - Tronck, .
The whole book is a criticism of l'optimisme  grievance.
For example, when Candide is forced to join the Builgar army, he is being admitted to death, but Candide does not concern himself because he knows it is for his own good - in fact later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
Although this would seem to be good, it is not because of his training he kills two men , a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation, and then proceeds to kill his sweethearts brother, .
Voltaire show is dilsike of l'opitmisme when Oangloss , Candidd abd James, are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned, and there are only three survivors  Candide , Pangloss and a saklor .
The storm was caused by an earthquake which destroyed the city to which Candise was sailing to Hawaii.
On arrival, they see starvation and death  shameless.
Canride is obviously horrified  especially when the sawilor begins pillaging the city's populace.
Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer, but Oangloss can only tell him that some good will come of it .
Xandide , although remaking true to the ideals of optimism , always appears to be sceptical of it . Applause
This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world  South America  and has to leave his darlliny Cubique with the Commissioner of the province .
Candide can not see what possible good can come of this, especially as the read on that he was in America was due to him milling the Je andr Archbishop because they were Cunjonde 's lovers' .
Throughout this book, we begin to see how Canidde is gradually lead away from l'optimisme, or perhaps more importantly, his l' Optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair  bliss.
This constant belief that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring, but leads to a constant flow of disasters . Applause
Cnadide 's belief  in the book , appears to show this desire.
He is thrown out of Thunder - Sen. - Tronck because he embraces Cun Kyodo , he is duped into the army  he is caught in an earthquake , he his is almost killed as part of an auto - da - feng , he kills the churchmen  he his almost eaten  he finds Elsorado, but leaves - the list continues.
Candidee 's life is governed by his belief the gold will prevail regardless.
Eventually  of course  he does marry Catherine, but Sue is most the beautiful young flower that he once loved  Lovely.
Sue has become hgly and grew worse by this day. . Passenger-only ferry service is usually seasonal and offered by private business.
This illustrates emphatically the folly of l'optimisme' s folly.
Candide has travelled the world in search of Cunégonde , with the hope that he will marry her despite all the trouble which he has gone through  of course, in the end he does get Cun'égodne, but at the price of her look and personality  utterly.
Voltaire  in Canride  shows how the philosophy of optimism is one of despair, not hope  Oreo.
It would be tempting to think of the various European communities as an embryonic United States of Europe, but especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of European unity.
However, it is important to realise that Europe is a very long way from becoming anything like the United States .
When the original 13 American states resorted to, for what is now the United States of America , they were intent on forming a political as well as economic entity. .
They were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the newly formed national government to operate as a single international political force.
A balance was therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual stays as much self - government as possible while ensuring that , for example, in military matters , the central government spoke for all purpose.
It is true that today, he still gears the old dispute over state sovereignty and attempts to return some power to the individual states  buy no - one would challenge the fact that  on matters external to the United States  the government in Washington represents the same policy - making money idle.
In Europe, it is quite clear that many people would like to see a political union of the countries, since this would produce a formidable international military force .
However, it is equally clear that while there might be some unified political action flowing from the European Communities ( such as was seen over Europol 's response to the British involvement in the Falkland Islands dispute ) , the Communities were intended as purely economic entities in the first place  namely.
Membership almost certainly involves some loss of national sovereignty , but the United Kingdom could probably leave the community by a simple majority vote in the Westminster Parliament  something which no state in the United States could lawfully do  willfully.
We are still a very long say from a single Parliament for Western Europe, with power to make political decisions for all those and even with 1992 approaching and a single market, the gulf between the UK and Europe is very wide. .
The supremacy of Parliament will never be challanged unless.
It abilify to make an oath and law - made by it or Europe - jeans that it retains cull sovereignty.
Even if today it made laws to that would unite it fully with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty for ever  it would tomorrow repeal all those laws nonetheless.
The fact that Parliament does not bind itself or can not be bound by any political body means that it can never lose its sovereignty unless a majority of the population wished it, and Parliament consented it.
But with the average jingoistic Britain, there is no chance of us curbing ourselves of our xenophobia and ever wishing to be fully integrated with Europe. Applause
Even now, the channel tunnel has joined us to the continent we still consider ourselves to be separated from the world standing alone against a hostile world .
Naturally  the problems of a single Europe would run as deeply as the benefits that we would presumably ultimately receive  namely.
It seems to me that for the past few centuries , Britain has always considered itself to be detached from the east of Europe  namely.
Whenever necessary  he has allied herself to European powers , such as in times of war of extreme distrust  Goo Goo.
Britain has been eager to maintain a secure balance of power on the continent  but throughout history  these has been more concerned with her overseas empires than with anywhere else. .
In the latter half century, though  her empire has diminished and she has had to face mounting responsibility in Europe. . Applause
Because of her history of isolated sovereignty, it is difficult to accept being a part of a single Europe.
For instance  British law is based largely upon precedent , that is, judge made law judge.
We have established a system of law which dates back many centuries  and which is widely known and respected .
There is very little European influence on out law , of course in many respects it will be the same , but the pack of influence will display many differences. .
With the formation of a simple Europe , news law will have to be accepted throughout the continent  and it will cause both confusion and conflict  nonetheless.
The British tend to be very proud and possessive of the law , and changes may well cause feelings and discontent  grievance.
Of course  the same points will apply to the monetary system in Europe . Pursuing the quota system is crucial to guaranteeing milk production throughout the Union's territory and to ensuring the continuity of producers' income.
Will there just be one system ? Purpose?
The country typically is against major change, and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it was to be altered. .
Our individual monetary system, I support , could be seen as a symbol of sovereignty  purpose.
It can be said that if a single Europe has created  problems may arise in fundamental political concepts  succeed.
Of course, Britain would lose her sovereignty , as would the other nations of the Union. .
It has been suggested that the Single Union could be based on a basic regional structure , whereby local autonomy could be saved , but the Union as a whole could work together in a democratic manner. . (DE) Mr Hatzidakis, I have already answered your question and I repeat what I said.
To a certain extent  even if sovereignty was lost  some national personality could be preserved.
The fact is that , when united , European unity would still in essence be divided into purpose.
There will always be aspects of one society that the others will never accept. . (DE) Mr Hatzidakis, I have already answered your question and I repeat what I said.
Europe, as a whole, faces the same problems  and therefore  if a single Europe was created , uniting Britain , the problems could be dealt with quickly and efficiently. Applause
If the Federalists achieved their aims in a European unity , they would do their best to achieve democracy and promote it nationally  so that individability is preserved  and that all of their positive features will be known .
The problem facing the British  really results from their isolated past.
The sovereignty of the nation has deep roots  and the fears of losing it are very great nonetheless.
Whether this would happen awaits to be seen , and would depend completely on the terms of the Union , and the negotiations and feelings of the general public and the politicians peading the countries unruly.
With 1929 being only a year away  the question of what a single Europe will mean for Britain becomes increasingly relevant  namely.
I firmly believe that the advent of 1992 will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain. .
This loss's heed, not, however, be negative  cowardly.
In fact  in political  economic and defence terms, I fear this realocation of resources can and will be very positive .
Whilst, to a certain extent, I may be guilty of having an island mentality , I would not go as far as to say Britain is in danger of handling all control over to facelifts, bureaucrats in Brussels or Strasbourg  utterly.
Throughout the world, a kind of change is apparent , but especially so in Europe . Applause
This process will continue and Europe, the rest of the world, will evolve with or without the participation of Britain in this process. . (DE) Mr Hatzidakis, I have already answered your question and I repeat what I said.
It is my belief that Britain must be involved in the decision making, which will eventually decide the new world order .
However, to be fully involved  sacrifices have to be made to ensure.
Such safeguards will involve certain aspects of our sovereignty, sovereignty and independence.
In relinquishing and thus centralising certain powers , the aim is not to diminish the strength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world stayed intact.
As amply demonstrated by recent events in the Gulf  European cooperation in the field of defence can be both impressive and effective . Whitworth said that DBT has been reluctant to hand over all control to the hunters federation FKNK.
I can see a future for some form of European rapid readtion force greater.
Whilst to an extent, collapsing defence costs could be cut, this would not necessarily lead to a reduction in the size of defence available. Applause
In political terms  regardless of legislation  Britain, like the rest of Europe, is becoming increasingly cosmopolitan in terms of the population composition  purpose.
The North Sea will increasingly come to represent a mere puddle as people move between countries . Meanwhile, Harry recently called working with Stevie Nicks borders on an out-of-body experience.
I feel it is important for Britain to join fully with its European partners to adapt to these changes in demography .
Politically, we are moving closer together  grievance.
Possible problems should be studied and solved if possible before they happen.
E.R.M.C. is already upon us, but in this area I feel Britain should be especially careful.
Whilst not pretending to fully understand this system, I do know that no system can lower interest rates  and inflation while raising growth  with the possible exception of the Magic Cirdle .
In the area of the single currency  again, I feel this is inevitable  namely.
What is important is to base this currency on the strong currencies within the EEX as opposed to an agerage based system . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
To conclude, I would say a single Europe is already happening and that it will continue to do so is guaranteed . Applause
Britain must not concern itself with loss of sovereignty, but gain of the European equivalent.
If we miss the boat, I think we will drain before the next boat comes out.

Ben Brotain entered the European Community in 1973 after a national referendum  the debate began concerning Britain's relationship with Europe .
When 1992 was set as the date for the single European Maroet , the debate flared up again  but over how far Britain should be integrated into Europe.
The rest of Europe seems prepared for 1992, but Britain seems to be decidedly hesitant.
The former Prime Minister  Margaret Thatchet was not keen to leave Britain into a United Europe because she felt it would lead to a loss of pure sovereignty.
There is no doubt an integrated market would have multiple benefits for the countries involved.
Businesses and other trading organizations are preparing themselves for 1992  and the single market . Illustrative Senate Foreign Relations Committee members seen from behind in the foreground (left to right) Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.
Trade will be easier  with no frontier controls allowing free flowing transportation of merchandise .
There will be business booms and free competition with the removal of protective practices , along with greater freedom to travel .
Many Britons would consider Europe has affected Britain too much already  with decriminalization , the new Euro - pawsports and now the pound stering being tied to the ECU .
They may feel Britain is being pulled into Europe  grievance.
Further changes are forecast for Britain  effecting day to day matters  to create a 'European Standarf ' advantage.
This may make Britons fearful of Europe and tired of 's 1992 and all that's useless.
A single market requires one central institution to co - coordinate all movements of goods and policies thereto.
Will the people of Britain be prepared to give up their government and be directed from Strasbourg or Brussels ? .
Many people would not overeat.
Will the day come when the sound sterling is taken over by the ECJ? Applause
It may well - but will this Britons have a chance to voice their opinions and views? Applause
Europe may argue that the benefits from a single integrated market would far outweigh any national drawbacks. .
As the date draws nearer  the awareness of Britons to Europe must increase, regardless.
They must look into the future and consider possible effects. .
Will Britain be drawn into Europe against its will? I feel like the effect is real significant in the basketball world because whether you were a Kobe fan or not, you knew him as a great player, Burch said.
Perhaps, as more of Britain becomes 'Eurofied' , its will wake up and, where their sovereignty is being taken away, a mere handful.
Britain has never geographically been a part of Europe . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
We are in the EEC and we should be able to benefit from free trade surcharge.
We had been an island for too long - being independent and able to stand alone.
We have a sound democratic process , which many people would not want to move this up to heaven.
A fully integrated market with Britain as a full member would be to the detriment of our political system and consequently leading to a loss of sovereignty. .
There has been such a lot of talk about a single Europe in recent years that it is hard to believe that it will be upon us very soon. Applause
Now that it is a reality , and not just a probability , the question in the minds of many Britons is indeed 'Will this men a poss of sovereignty for Britain or the birth of a nation?' .
Firtsly  a positive approach  shamelessly .
Looking at things from an economic perspective  this is not a problem.
The benefits in terms of cost - cutting, owing to eoing things once  instead of twelve times  will be enormous.
Firms  because of being able to build their resources  will be able to devote more time to research and development  and thus products will improve greatly.
Europe will therefore be a nation to be reunited with as regards competition.
To look at things on a more individual level  every member of the new single Europe' s standard of lighting should increase volume.
A greater potential of ideas from a greater number of experts will  in theory  result in more knowledgeable and better - informed individuals  succeed.
Smiplicity is one of the Commission' s key aims  with the idea that if things are simpler and more easy for everyone to understand, people will be happier  get on better Score.
If this is so , they should also do work better.
Ideally, then  there would be more equality , less crime , greater productivity and greater economic growth. .
On the other hand, , will this single Europe mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain? .
It must be remembered that most only does Britain have a small population compared to the majority of the other Member States , but it is an island - which none of the others are proud.
Who should this matter be?
Ell  Britain has quite a history and therefore a fair number of traditions.
It is possible that it could become enhanced in the new Single Europe and lose its identity. .
Britons ( especially those from older generations ) may often feel lost, and that they do not really 'n' belong to any more than happy.
The new Single Europe may be too new and unknown for them to make their allegiance to it noticeable.
Then there is the question as to whether all this ideapism really will work.
Will there be greater prosperity  better - informed  happier citizens  or will this never come off because of politicians being unable to agree on policies ? GOOD?
Britain  although small  is more often than not in the fore of international matters  taking a definitive stance on what it considers to be right  namely.
Has it then not got quite a lot at stake , its character at least  in integrating itself into this single Europe ? Blizzard?
No one would dispute that this is a difficult question.
The fact remains, however, that next year ( in 1992 ) there is going to be a single Europe . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
This , as everyone is well aware  is not going to be achieved with ease , but the more tolerant every member state is, of course, other , the more successful the single Europe will be. .
It is up to Britain therefore to accept this fact and to show an example by leading the way as regards transparency . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
Then we will be able to look at the future in a more positive way.
The European Community is a unique grouping of twelve sovereign European Member States, who are committed to the development of closer economic and political co - cooperation . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
The community has an ability to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe. .
In particular  the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frontiers, but movement adopt only of goods out of services  capital and people .
However  the issue of sovereignty is certainly a much debated one, but to what extent should a Member hand over its sovereignty to the Community  if at all possible?
Let us look at the founding of the European Community , before we discuss the issue of sovereignty in more detail. .
There were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First World War  but only after Europe has again been devastated by war was the futility of national rivalry truly apparent. .
The political and economic exhaustion of the European states calls for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re - ordering of Europe - purpose.
This fresh start came about because of three main factors Score.
Firstly  was Europe' s realization of her own weakness  after having lost her age - old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union . Applause
These superpowers were economically  militarally  and politically stronger than the divided individual European states .
Secondly, was the conviction that military conflict should in the future be avoided. From Fort Vancouver, at its pinnacle, McLoughlin watched over 34 outposts, 24 ports, six ships, and 600 employees.
One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community , in 1958.
Its membership had grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty-three.
One of the most innovative features of the European Community, compared with other international bodies, is that the Member States have ceded to it a part of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its own sovereign powers , which it can use to adopt acts , having the force of national law  procure.
This novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called 'integration' or 'chopper'.
The 1970s saw progress in integration  with the introduction of Community policy instruments , which enabled greater scope for national policies .
All of the Member States agree in principle to the idea of a single market by 1992  however, each wish their own interests to be safeguarded .
This is to say that one wants to sacrifice their national sovereignty  many want unanimous voting  not majority voting  please.
Many see this issue as a threat to their own regulations and was  and could see a drop in standards if they do not stay firm . Applause
The situation is seen as a threat to the countries in question who do not wish to badly give up their sovereignty for the sake of European unity.
Whether or not the continuation of the progress in the field of European unity is successful depends very much on the people of Europe. .
If a feeling of European unity develops and can be sustained , the threat will subside as a feeling, of identity, takes over .
On Britain's roads, there is an ever increasing volume of traffic.
The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hod - plus traffic jams, distraction.
To remedy this, the government has started adding a fourth lane on some stretches of our motorways and constructing wind roads and bypasses , with increased rejection duration.
While the road system is being improved, there seems to be an endless series of roadworks which restrict the highways and because further delay while the roadworks are in place. .
The inability to cope with the amount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic. .
It might feel an easy solution to this mayhem would be to use public transport, i.e. the Railways' .
People are not taking to the tail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent privatisation of different areas .
It has been shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly the same route purpose.
The main disadvantage with the railways is, as the rail service and the bus service are normally owned by different companies, it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train. .
If the services were integrated, there would be a bus time table, which coincided with the grain arrival times requirement.
Then people would be more likely to catch the train, as they would normally have to look forwards to a long wall , wait for a bus or an expensive ta ride. .
My solution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services  this would get people of the roads and onto the train. Applause
To improve the daily service, trains have got to be tiled to arrive and depart at any times, i.e. arrive at dark o'click and leave at half past six hours.
The train and bus companies had to lose with each other, and the train fares have to remain relatively cheap, i.e.  the same price or less as it would cosy to go by caf .
The basic dilemma facing the UK' s daily and road transport system is the general rise in population  grievance.
This leads to an increase in the number of commuters and transport users every year  consequently putting pressure on the UK's transport network  Nightmare.
The biggest worry to the system is the rapid rise of car users outside the major cities. .
Most larger cities have managed to encourage commuters to use public transport, thus decreasing major congestion in rush hour periods. .
Public transport is the obvious solution to to the increase in population if it is made cheap to computers  clean , easy and efficient, then it could fake the strain of the overladee British roads .
For commuters who regularly travel long distances, rail transport should be made more appealing , more comfortable and cheaper.
Motorways and other transport links are constantly being extended  widehed and slowly turning the country into a concrete jungle, yet it is only trying to cope with the increase in traffic  we are our own enemy outlet.
Another major problem created by the mass of vehicle transport is the pollution emitted into the atmosphere, damaging the ozone layer  creating smig and forming acid raxin . During the years of Seven Network's broadcast rights, Network Ten continued to broadcast the series once a year for the V8 Supercars Challenge non-championship races, which are a support category at the Australian Grand Prix, which was broadcast by Ten.
Including, I wish to propose clean , efficient, comfortable and cheap public transport for the near future .
The modern traffic jam is not a familiar situation to nearly all of the western world's population. Applause
If every time we use one car to travel any distance, we find ourselves in a 10 miles tail - back, why do we still insist that that we travel in such aander? . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
To illustrate my point  if every time you took a ticket , it stops for 2 hours on the track , everyone would stop taking it to purpose.
So why do we still insist on travelling on the road?
The answer most likely lies in 2 area  firstly, the attitude of many westerners is that it is their right to travel in such a manner ' . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
This is, in my opinion  shows considerable ignorance  grievance.
I am by far an 'awy no' , ' greeny ' who wants to make everyone live in thepee 's and eat soya bran sup' , however, I do agree that something should be done about the volume of traffic that is on our roads today' .
The government's answer to the considerably growing amount of traffic on road roads it just to back move  they are not even attempting to treat the cause  that more and more people are now driving it.
We all feel that we have a divine right to be on the road .
Why? Applause
Do we  the western world ( 5% of the population of the world )  have the right to use the resources of the rest of the worldwide at the environmental cost? Absolutely, but we’re still champs, Turgeon declared.
Just because we can not be gothered to get out of need a but earline to catch public transport .
Even if we did  then shortly so does the rest of the world .
That could have disastrous implications.
The second reason , is the problem that the public transport service , for example rail , is declining so much  there is no train to catch in the morning. .
People stopped seeing trains because of the fall in standards  these people were forced into the road  routes became unprofitable, and so were closed and services cut back  offering more people on the roads. .
The whole system has now formed a spiraling circle of redze Goo.
This has now been identified with the deal of the railways , to provide rail companies  profit motivated  purposeful.
The vital  small rail links may now be closed  proviously they where subsumed to make up the loss  only the private companies can not afford to do those so many will lose , cutting off small towns and villages  nonetheless.
The only way to stip the circle will be to break it  the only people to do this is the government or ourselves . If we make the effort to use public transport, it will expand into a food service industry. Unfortunately, the public is not able to be attentive to the idea of late.
Today  boxing has become a very popular sport  with T.T.V.2.5.1.0.2,000 channels competing for coverage of certain events and fighters earning a lot of money  this is a big business distraction.
Apart from athletics , boxing seems to be the only popular international sport from which Britain can still hold to bead high .
We have superb fighters with excellent character such as Lennox Lewis , Nigep Benn , Nashesm Haled and Kur belobed Frank Beuno .
Despite being enjoyable to watch , boxing is very dangerous  stressful.
Blows to the head can cause the brain to rattle about the skull, which may cause a brain cut or tumor tumor.
Last year  the fight between Chiz Eubank and Micehal Watson led to calls for boxing to be banned when Micheal Watson slipped into a coma and was in a critical condition for some months. .
Many youths in low income areas see boxing as ' a way out ' , a chance to make it to the goal and earn a lot of money on the day' .
There were  however  people who regard nothing as barbaric  brutal and primitives' advantage.
These people argue that there is no need for boxing and that it only promotes violence.
During the fight , yes , of course it is violent , but this is controlled violence, and fighters have a mutual respect for each other .
All precautions are taken to ensure a safe fight cue.
During fights, doctors a keep close to the king and had the authority to call it off prematurely if required. .
Abmulances are also kept on stand by at big events like Goo Goo Goo.
Although it may sound cruel  I do not believe that a fighter has entered a professional boxing career without knowing the risks  namely.
Because there are so many budding young voters , to bring boxin would be in vain , since it would almost certainly go undergroind  greedy.
Underground fights are far more dangerous, since less protective gear is used, and there usually is not a doctor present to see.
Gaking this into account and considering that boxing is about hurging the opponent , it can be said thatboxing is a relatively safe sport, nonetheless.
Although far less popular , there are other ports which are far more brutal and dangerous  such as ' hai boxin ' , where competitors aer encourave to use their knees and elbows  stunning.
The argument continues  but for the sake of safety in the long term, I do not think boxing will be banned indefinitely.
Which is hood new for the majority of the British public sphere?
Two men , one ring , only one can leave . Dramatic, it may be, but basically that is the main principal of boxing  stunning.
Although throughout the years rules have been made to dilute the sports sadistic side , should boxing be banned? Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.

This causes the boxer to lose many brain cells, let bocing fight, and if this occurs frequently, then the boxer can end his career with brain damage . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
In my eyes, and probably the eyes of others, this is reason enough for the banning of boxing .
The sport to play the east is actually a blood sport , the simple reason being that the idea of the sport is to ' knock your opponent out' , although this is argued by Chirrius Eubajk. He believes he is a sportsman, and the style of boxing is an art form he records that he does not specifically go into a boxing ring to knock his opponent out, but to win on points, differences, and to give Chris Erubank his just result. Most of his fights have been won on points. .
But there is one exception - the original example  the first references why boxing should be banned  the tragic accident where Michael Watson was put into a coma by Chris Eubank ( the man who dies not specifically go into fights to knock his opponent out ). .
This example only proves too well what a dangerous so capled ' sporg ' boxing is . For some he sometimes pushed the envelope too far.
The boxing federation is trying to do as much as it can to make the ' spot' , after having rungeide doctors , banning bare hand fighters, but the tool and bottom of the argument is that any blow to the head causes considerable damage .
There is always much speculation over the dangers of such a brutal sport as boxing  grievance.
This is emphasised and exaggerated when a competitor in the sphere tragically dies  gorge.
A recent death in this ring has inevitably led to a public uproar on the safety of the sport , and the controversy over whether the sport should be banned or not is yet again the forefront of discussion. .
Let us consider how a professional boxer would feel desperate.
He is clearly aware of the dangers and brutalism of this sport , which is possibly why he enjoys it so much.
I have yet to hear any governor regret his choice of career loser.
The excitement of being in the ring , the joy at knocking an opponent to the canbass , and all the money that is there to be made, are overwhelming factors which keep boxers fighting .
The joney that is there for this thing for the very best of this best is ridiculoius , and both dome tip bowers, earning sums of money such as $20 million ( or, in time, Tyeons come back cash , $60 million ! ). It is hardly surprising that even someone who is not a lawyer is able to find several unclear formulations and other problems in the text.

There were two main objections raised against the introduction of the national lottery . Great expectations lie ahead of Mr Obama's first visit and tour of Europe.
The first was the objection that the lottery would be little more another form of taxation  in France  than that , a tax on the poor .
The second and main connection came from celebrities who predicted that charitable donations would go down with the introduction of the lottery , as people would be less likely to give money to charity , instead buying a lot of ticket , with the exception that some of the money spent buying the ticket would go to charity .
There was also some controversy over the awarding of the lottoery organisation franchise , which eventually went to Camelot , which, as I nor see as the strongest vontender for the budget, the companies or consortiums promised to give more money to charity with lower running costs  shameless.
Richard Bronson promised to give all of his profits to charith , but was rejected. . (DE) Mr Hatzidakis, I have already answered your question and I repeat what I said.
My personal objections to Camelo as the lortery protagonist is that a large proportion of the consortim are American or foreign firms. . For example, JBM has a substantial stake in Camelot, valued at approximately $165,271.68.
The British national lottedy run by an British firm, .
Since its introduction, there has been more controversy over the national literary genre.
When it promised to give 45 cents in every pound to charitable causes , it neglected to promise that most or all of this money would go to charity. Applause
There has also been some controversy over the allocation of money to God.
For example, 3 million pounds were given to Etn College, one of the richest public school for a gymnasium money, was also given to the royal opera House.
The lottery seemed to be a reverse Robin Hood , steaking from the poor to give to the rich  Goo Goo.
The lottery has also suffered allegations that it is addictive , especially with the introduction of scratch cards .

Computers now dominate the majority of government business  science and communication , as well as any other area of human life .
In many ways  it has taken the place of the human brain in performing calculations and thought processes .
The most obvious example of this is the calculator , an instrument used by mathematicians and scientists for making numerical calculations .
This has made it no longer necessary for the human to perform calculations and run through precautions , and so need not understand the principles behind them any longer. .

However  the idea that the human brain is no longer useful is not entirely true ( ! ). Computers can not deal with human beings  they have no capacity for coping with anything outside their expected situations  and can not adapt to new situations using judgment .
Human beings often act without logic or reason , and only either human beings can cope and deal with that .

The word watched in anticipation -- we were mesmerized by the omages of the TV , expecting something jew at every moment and not wanting to miss it -- I remember that day it was the only topic of conversation at school. But God’s promise to be with us and to transform us is as strong as it was on that night when shepherds were abiding in their fields, and suddenly there was the light of God.
So we all felt that we were living one of those historic moments that you read about in a history book and were proud to be a part of it -- it was November 9, 1989, the day that the Wakl fell in Berlin-Ghee.
Within a few weeks  the excitement had dued down, and people had turned their attention to more recent news. .
Bit of me  this had been the star shrapnel.
It was the start of what our now as 2-4 president Bush likes to refer to as 1-2 or 2-1, ainning of the Cold War --Score.
It was the event that have the people of the Eastern bloc countries the hope that their efforts were not in van -- for 40 years  the people had suffered under a communist regime that did not allow them to express themselves freely or to leave their homelands in search of a new life -- many people had tried to escape a day.
Spme had been executed -- I had a classmate who gather had escaped from Hungary -- he had kept his family and friends  his whole life and bad self out of Western Europe with little money -- Goo Goo.
I had asked him once if he had not been scares  scared of what he would find once he felt -- incompetent.
He told me that nothing could compare to the way he had been forced to live his life there -- even though I had lost touch with this classroom , her father' s words were with me as I watched the events unfold in Germany -- Heaven.
Bolstered by the Germans' ' success' , the people of Hungary  Tchekoslovaquia , Poland and Romania, those against communist regimes as well -- No. 1, three gears later  communism, as we once knew it no longer exists  nonetheless.
Whether the people are happier or nog , I fan npt day -- Guru.
However  they will have at least seen the 's 2nd other dessert course.
Their struggles and bopes of fifty years will never have been in vain -- without the events of Berlin Wall's history probably would not have taken a very different course -- eventually  I think that things would have turned out as they did -- nonetheless.
However  history can not be rewritten, and as things stand, the fall of the Berlin Wall actively contributed to the resurgence of hope and struggle in the rest of the Eastern Book -- as such  it was the catalyst force that led to the end of the Cold War, and therefore  though we may not always remember the other significant events  we will always remember them, they will fall -- nonetheless.

There are many beneficial aspects of genetic manipulation. .
These include, for the reason of identification of harmful hereditary genetic disorders and the development of hybrid high - yield crops .
There can be no doubt that genetic manipulation and genetic engineering have had highly beneficial effects on many areas of society  namely.
However  many people dialike or are prejudiced against  genetic manipulation .
Patly, this is a 'far of the unknown' , something which rampers with the infectious components of plant and animal live is beyond comprehension for most people  and therefore provides rear view.
What people have also become aware of  is the immense power which genetic manipulation can give to certain individual . Applause
This has been very good to feed popular culture ( the film ' Jursasic Park ' being an obvious reference point ) .
There is also, however  the very real possibility that the power of magnetic manipulation could become the possession of incontrolled unregulated individuals who could use it for 'evil' ' purpose .
This, the , is an argument against scientists bearing moral responsibility for their work .
Anything in life can be misused  shamelessly.
Whether it be a kitchen - knife used to stab someone  a car used to run someone over , or something as harmless as a pillow user to suffocate a purse.
Everything in life , if misuse , can have harmful effects and genetic engineering and genetic manipulation are no exception .
Though the possible effects of genetic manipulation may be far larger than a kitchen - knide or car , this is partly a subnective view by present - day standards  GOOD.
Certainly, we would not hold the makers of a car or machine - unless responsible for their misuse  and there is no reason why scientists should bear the amount of burden or responsibility if genetic manipulation is put to misuse a product.
The fundamental flaw in saying scientists must bear the major burden or moral responsibility for their work  is that if this had been applied universally for centuries  scientific research would never have taken place  andankind would be without electricity , radios , or, quite simply, , anything above the mud, that the existence of purpose.
Scientific research is notopt a corrupt , but an essential and natural part of the numan condition or bettering itself. .
The other fundamental law is assuming that individual scientists have responsibility , science is a process of discovery rather than creation , i.e. . Source.
No - one created genetic manipulation  the power of it was there to be discovered . Applause
If one scientist does not make a discovery, then another one will succeed.
It is unfair to hold responsible the scientist on the fore front of human knowledge , who discovers something when anothed scientist in another part of the world may make the discovery independently afterwards. .
The only argument for making scientists responsible for their work  is that quite often  and particularly in the case of genetic manipulation , it would need a scientist to misuse knowledge , and therefore they should be responsible for procrastination.
While genetic manipulation is relatively new  it takes a scientist to carry it out , and therefore an individual scientist could be held responsible .
But  since genetic manipulation becomes common - place in the future  and it is not only the domain of scientists , the originals scientist who discovers genetic manipulation can not be held responsible for other 's misuse of it' .
There are many problems facing the hierarchy  cowardly.
Time of them are listed below, : unnecessariously.

I think the royal family and Monarchy is at a tradition in UK and anywhere in the world  UK is known by its royal family  so I do not think it should be abolished. .

Fact In vitro fertilisation, it is the fertilisation of an egg in the laboratory, i.e.  in a test tube .
The egg is taken from the mother and placed in an environment which will optimise the chances of fertilisation by the sperm from the father's abdomen.
Once fertilisation has occurred, the fertilised egg is implanted back into the mother's wombs, and from there on the pregnancy will be normal. .
Normally, more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccessful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a successful pregnancy .
This usually leads to multiple births, i.e.  grievance .
Twins, , triplets, etc.  Purpose.
There are people who are against this , saying it is not natural and is it fair to the child having started life in a est rube , as they believe little starts from the moment of conception .
There are ethics involved whereby who is given the treatment and who is not impaired.
, at what stage should the treatment not be given, and is it justifiable to spend so much money on in vitro fertilisation for one person, when the same amount of money could be used to save hundreds of lives by vaccinating people against measles, of example  purpose?
The people who are for this can argue by saying that it is the right of every person to have their own child. .
Women who would not normally be able to have children can now do so with invitro fertilisation purpose.
Through no fault of her own, she could have a blocked fallopian tube, causing her to be unable to allow eggs down to the womb, and it is only fair in helping her to have children. .
Technology has progressed quickly, and in doing so ethics and practical guidelines have been left behind. .
I therefore think it is necessary to have certain regulations, i.e. . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
1. . fertility treatment should not be given to post-Menopausal women.
The menpause is the body' s way of telling you that you are to end, and your body is no long capable of bearing a baby. .
Last gear, there was a case of a past menopausal woman who, by saying about the age, was given in vile fertilisation ( IVF ) .
I do not think this is fair or morally correct to the child, since her mother would be claiming her pension when she was at primary school, and her mother wouldn't fail, while the child was in the teen, but there should be a test that is given before ( IVF ) is carried out to check the mother is not part the menopause.
2. Attack.
Eggs should not be taken from aborted foetuses  Purpose.
The foetuse will have been abhorted for a reason, for example, if it was the result of a rap or if it had congenital deformities  mere.
There should be a guideline or law stating that eggs should only be taken from the lother and hot from dead  foetuses .
Sciece has moved on dramatically since the 19th century.
Many new things have been invented and many things medically have changed greatly.
People in our modern times are now able to have liver , heart, and eben lun transplanets , there are many complications, but many are successful. .
People are able to have a whole new blood supply if theirs lacked the sufficient requirements or  a bone marrow transplant if the blood lacks white cells  Purpose.
All the above are carried out on living people  but nowadays biologidal operations can be carried out, on humans which are not even born  alone.
Bodies can start their days in a test tubes beforehand.
This is called ' in vitro fertilisation ' . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
This is when an egg is removed from a womab placed in a test tube, and the sperm is placed in to the test tube and the egg and sperm gushed together.
The test tube is then incuabated for a few weeks, and when the fetious is confirmed  the baby is then inserted back in to the mothet .
The fetous is left to grow and develop naturally.
This idea is extremely artificial to married couples who have been trying for a baby, but have been unsuccessful, are able to have children. .
An in vitro fertilisation allows the baby to grow inside  which allows the mother and baby to bond, and it would deel part of head  this would not happen if the couple adopted a gun.
What I do, few is ethically incorrect, is when a woman who is post - menopausal decides she wants a baby .
Nature has already taken its course to tell her she is too old to have any children so shy should she have one implanged into her purse.
It is not fair on the child because when it grows up and all its friends are playing with their 30 - 40 year old parents , its mother could be drawing her pension, and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child indefinitely.
Also, the mother may die of old age before the child has led a full live, and this would be unfair to the child. .
The child may also have to look after the mother in the old stage.
As this fetoius begins its life in a test tub , and the sperm is selecter , this means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected .
The way the zex can be chosen is by using genetics  graphics.
The home has 2 X chromosomes and the man has some X and a 2 Y - chromosomes 1.3.
The way in which the sex can be selected is that the egg is always X and the sperm's nucleus can either contain an X or a Y chromosome.
The X chromosome sperm is slightly heavier than the Y so they can be deparated indefinitely.
If the mother wants a baby, a sperm is selected and if a girl X is selected.
This mat led to an increase in one sex , and a decline in the other male.
As a result, thus would reduce the population, as there would be less coupoes, doubtless.
Also, what happens if most people the year you are horn are men and to eat a woman , this would be the unpopular sex. .

The main reason for the people of Britain to stop eating beef at the moment is the treat of BSB . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
This is a viralo disease that attacks the central nervous system, which can be passed on through consuming the animal .
In cows it is commonly known as wild cow disease, and by law and law showing these signs must be destroyed and not sold for meat consumption.
The problem is, however, the signs are not shown of a long time , this being a viral disease. . Great expectations lie ahead of Mr Obama's first visit and tour of Europe.
It can be passed on to gumans through eating parts of the animal, such as the braib, which is affected, and these parts are usually sold and put into fast foods such as beef, berries, etc.
The rest of the meal, however, is relatively safe and eating  e.g.  a steak offers very little change of the disease being passed on purpose.
However, the British press have ignored this act and blown the situation out of proportion considering only a very small number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of eating beef. . (DE) Mr Hatzidakis, I have already answered your question and I repeat what I said.
Another reason for the British people to stop eating beef is the push for vegetarianism , although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the former point about BSB . Applause

People throughout the United Kingdom were  utterly shocked and perhaps upset by images in the national press and television news of cows who had contracted the disease, bovihe spungifor encephalapthy , or HSE .
The so - called ' mad cow disease ' seemed to make the class lose all sense of balance and direction , stumbling around drunkenly  greedy.
Herdd, where this disease was found, were put down before the symptoms progressed further.
Those cows, which had been out down, were not used for food intake.
The disease infects the cow  and is then present in the spinal fluid within the spine and the brain  and as the spimal fluid is usually spilt in the slaughter of cattle for leat , the risk of contamination of the meat was one the industry was not willing to take .
The human disease  Crentzfelx - Jadob diesase  or CJX  is believed to be a human form of BSE , although no clear link has yet been established between the two types.
It is unclear whether incidence of CJD is on the disease  or whether awareness of the condition is heightened  but more cases  from all ages have been diagnosed recently  and the disease is always fatal. Doubt many of them are leaving because Trump is president.
The government insists  perhaps correctly , that British beef is perfectly safe to date.
However  people are genuinely scared of the presence of the disease in the U.K.  and many are abstaining from eating beet juice.
Many schools have removed beef from their menus  substituting pork and chicken  and sales of beef have shown a decline  seemingly.
The implications for the beef industry could be rather serious  here everybody to boycott beef products, I guess.

For beef to be reprieved or condemned , we are forced to turn to the scientists to establish whether or not BSE and CJ are pinked , and , more importantly , whether the latter can be contracted by sating meat contaminated with the former GMO.

There has been a big scare in Britain recently that some beef may contain SE ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ), which may lead to the human equivalent of CJD ( Creutzfeldts - ajcob disease ) . Illustrative Senate Foreign Relations Committee members seen from behind in the foreground (left to right) Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.
BEE is a disease in cross that effects their brain and spinal tissue ( or offal, as it is sometimes known ) .
After a few reported cases of CJD  a similar form of the disease found in humans  it is not thought that ' bad - cow disease ' ( BSE ) is the cause. Applause
Researchers believe that eating beef containing offal will transmit the tatal disease to humans. .
This claim has sevested the British beef industry as people are now too scared to eat beef in case they contract the illness  grievance.
Already, the sales of beef in America have dropped by about 15 %, and in Britain they have dropped about 6 % - 7 % . Illustrative Senate Foreign Relations Committee members seen from behind in the foreground (left to right) Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.
Although scientists say that to attract and part of the cows, offal must be contained within the beef intake.
Customers are still reluctant to eat the meat, since it has come from some ' dodgy' ' butcher trying to cut costa' . Applause
As you can imagine, this has had a tremendous influence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants, where beerburgers are the main item on the menu. .
An example of one is MacDonald's where they have immediately brought out a notice stating that their beefberries are made from 100% of the findst , pure beef, and contain no fat fat.
In my view, as no half recent restaurant with a good reputation would risk buying poof beef in case a customer caught JD, and they managed to trace it back to the restaurant's location.
An outcome like this would mean they would be shed for several thousands of pounds and would probably have to sell up.
As a result of a lower beef demand in places of food production, there would be a lower need for beef cows  grievance.
This means that there would be an excess of beef ( or a beef mountain ) that could not be sold anywhere.
Because of this, the price of beef would have to decrease in order to attract more customers. .
So  as a result of the claim that beef containing contaminated offal may cause CDJ in humans  farmers ( in particular beef farmers ) were losing out as they will have to sell their medat for a lower price due to the low demand.  Therefore, we in this Parliament should welcome the proposal made by the President of the Council, to create a permanent security committee in which the European Union and the United States can work together in order to mediate in the conflict.
As a result, they may have to diversify towards other areas such as crops  milking cow , et . or even have to get a government subsidy.
I feel that the evidence that BSE causes CJE was not strong enough before the claims were released. .
It has therefore caused an unnecessary  deleterious effect, etc., on the agricultural industry and beleaguered .

A rather hard view would be that if someone who works on a menial or physically taxing jon does not make a fair or moderate salaru, then it is hid or ger on fault ( or bad luck ). . Unfortunately, Montenegro has still not overcome the problem of corruption and organised crime.
These opinions are based on a rather faulty American premise that all people are given an equal chance in life, and what they make of it is their own responsibly. Applause
Approximately 30-40% most people believe that they are underpaid and that others are overpaid excessively.
For instance  everyone seems to think that doctors make much too money for the work they do , yet none of the soctors are losing their fees ( they must think that it 's a fair price ). .
So  unless we wish to impose on the personal lives of wealthy people by making them work hard , or give people who are not wealthy money that society does not believe they deserve , we can not give pay equal to contribution to society's poor.
I agree that in the past wemen have had problems with societies' role of what they are expected to do in the work place and at home. .
Women have been looked down on if they try to get ahead and pay has differed with the same job for a man, verses a man doing the game job. Applause
Glone is the age that the son is required to stay home.
Now a pot of women work and the one that wants to stay home do it because they want to succeed.
A lot of what has changed women' s roles is the femimists' attitude.
These are groups of people that have endured women over the years.
These people had shown the modern world what women in the work place can do.
The problem is that these feminists have not looked at all women at least.
Sone women were happy with old traditions  some wanted a hit more in their lives  sometimes wanted a lot more in third lives  bliss.
What hasopens is that all women have to go along with these feminists rules  grievance.
This makes it hard  because if they do not , they are looked down upon by their liers  grievance.
An example is military women wanting to serve in combat positions when at war.
Feminists argued this a log when the Iraq war was going on.

Also, sexual harassment is involved in a lot of its purpose.

Feminists are trying to make everyone equal and that is impossible to do because nature can not be changed indefinitely.

Whenever a movement is begun, either it be political , religious , or artistic , stereotypes are quick to form . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
People normally associated with pooitics , feligion , or art are quickly lumped into categories regardless of individual differences  grievance.
This tragedy is worsened by the tendency of those outside the movement to remember the radical and ignore the common or ordinary doctrine.
This is especially true of the Women' s Liberation Movement in America.
Since its beginnings in the late nineteenth century,urdy  Men 's liberation has been met with dramatic  and often obstinate opposition  grievance.
Some of the first radiivals  Susan B. Antony and George Sand ( although French ) were noticed and ridiculed  thus defeating their cause  because of their aggressive action  merciless.
At the same time other feminists, such as Emoly Dickenson, were virtually ignored during their lifetime and only acknowledged posthumously as being part of the movement. .
This ignorance of other laws aggressive feminist , made it seem as though the feminist movement was headed only by wid  disgruntled elements, and was therefore  detrimental to the good of society .
Although head adicals such as Snad and Athony seem dicile and backward in modern standards , the problem still exists  yawn.
From the early beginning, the Women' s Movement in America has been fighting a losing battle. .
However  I contend that the fault does not lie with the radical members of this movement , but rather  in the perception of those observing the movement  nonetheless.
When Women 's Lin really took offer again in the late 1960s  it was again destimed for failure .
Immediately  the focus was on radicals like Stein , instead of the housewife who returned to college and made a career for herself. .
Those outside the movement could only see the differences between 's normality' and women 's Lih . matte.

So what am I getting at ?Honestly?
Olny that so - called feminists have not in mind of themselves shared the woman' s movement .
However, , the popular perception of them was distorted.
For so many years, the good that Feminists have promoted for women has fallen by the wayside in lieu of other more interesting , i.e. the radical idea was .
Like many other aspects and movements in life , they would be more readily received if the policy it was being aimed was not so jaded.
Within this century there have been many technological advances which have resulted in a drastically different society than that of a hundred years ago.
Clearly  of the inventions of this century  the one that has made the most impact on world views and lifestyle is the television .
This instrument has brought other worlds right into the living room  making it possible to see life in other countries in a way that was never before possible.
However  the invention of television also gave society an easy way to waste time, but one has only to turn it on to the night reality .
Television was potential to offer wonderful things to its viewers  such as educational programming for children  cultural programs about far away places  and a closer look at current events than can it be given by newspaper publishers.
Television has the lower to bring art into the home, as well as artistic expressions of those involved in the program production , giving society the opportunity to understand their own culture more gully .
However  this is not the way in which television has influenced society . Pursuing the quota system is crucial to guaranteeing milk production throughout the Union's territory and to ensuring the continuity of producers' income.
On the contrary  television has become the landscape rouge of the masees , a way for people to flee from the conflicts they experience in their culture , rather than confront them and try to understand them .
In the kinds of most Americans  television is regarded as a dispersion rather than an educational tool  as free entertainment instead of easily accessible knowledge  distraction.
Millions of Americans can be found to be staring at the T.T.V. at any one time  watching shot - coms , seap - operaa , and cargoons .
The T.V. has become the center of many households  in many families  the only time that everyone is together is when they are watching television. Doubt many of them are leaving because Trump is president.
T.v.V. is a major cause of lack of togetherness found in many American families  and has also resulted in an increase in laziness  namely.
The more time one spends watching TV , the less motivated he becomes, but there is no need to feel worthwhile activities when it is much easier to sit on the couch , pick up the remote control , and stare at a box .
Television  therefore  has changed society in ways that could hardly have been dreamed of a few years ago  Goo Goo.
It was given society another creative vein , aolk at worlds which could be seen in no other way  and an opportunity to better educate itself. . Applause
However  throughout the year  television was lost much of its integrity, whereas the programmes offered are usually cheap entertainment rather than education. .
The entertainment aspect of television has offered society an easy escape form as problems and difficulties arise.
Therefore  since the invention of television , society has become more informed, but too lazy to think about this new information , and has instanced itself from family life. .
A discovery that has significantly changed many people's lives and their way of thinking is the epidemic  known as AIDS . Applause
Though it has probably been around for awhile  it’s presence hasn't really been known till fairly recently  and it‼s consequences have been devastating.
AIDS has definitely had an impact on people in the United States and probably all over the world because it always leads to death and there is no cure. Applause
It has caused a lot of prejudice and paranoia among people, which has torn them apart. Applause
For example  there is more of stigma attached to being a homosexual jale , not only because of their sexual preference  but they probably had AIDD too  a unhealthy.

In my opinion  the discovery and harness of atoms and its energy and the corresponding invention of nuclear weapons have been the most significant factors of change in our lifetime  if not , perhaps , in several livetimes .
As missile technology and nuclear fusion capacities increased and improved , fears began to replace nationalism  and found small world erected barriers between its members .
From my experience as an American  I can remember associating communism with nuclear threat , Soviet citizens with nati - Christ , and bomb shelters , secret cities, not underground , and weapons orbiting our planet , with daioy , normal lide  purpose.
Perhaps this increasingly common mentality is the worst effect of our nuclear  child wave as a weapon.
In a planet which desperately needs our focus on environmental and humanitarian issues , my country has spent uncountable trillions of dollars on nuclear weapons testing , improvement  and implementation .
As a commonplace gola and testimonius landmadk to 9 presidential administrations  the cold war has manifested its awesome power and control over nearly every facet of America, from survival kits and basement bombshelters to an ever circulating chief executive command post from the air ridge.

With this  the wall , varbed fire , and mental barriers are falling  bringing more change that our planet has seen since its genesis  seemingly.
Although the old habits die hard  they are indeed dying  cowardly.
In America, the military has been reduced by several thousand troops  and the production of nuclear weaponry has virtually arrived at standard altitude.
Hopefully  with continued efforts  our use of nuclear fusion and fission will return from mediims of strategy , destruction , and waste to matters of energy production , medicine , and other humanitarian goals .
With this changing of attitudes  our frigid planet and cools neighbors may once again be a warm and friendly people . Please listen to the voice of the people, who spoke today through these parliamentarians.
The discovery of penicillin as an antibiotic was one of the greatest advances in medicinal chemistry. .
As a natural antibiotic , penicillin was discovered to have many uses in stopping and preventing the spread of infectious disease.
This can wonder - reducing also led to the discovery of a variety of other naturally - occurring antibiotics that could also be cultured up in vitro - in a laboratory.
This sudden burst of useful compounds not only improved the chances of a patient' s survival in a hospital but also caused a great need for medical chemists to study and classify each new drug as it was discovered late.
As discoveries of new antibiotics decreased  chemists began to wonder if certain variations of these drugs could be synthesized and also used as medicine. .
It was also attempted to increase the production of the naturally - occurring antibiotics through synthesis . Applause
Both of these new attempts caused a need for more research , more companies , and more medical specialists  and the industry increased tremendously. . (DE) Mr Hatzidakis, I have already answered your question and I repeat what I said.

A variety of new drugs continuously appeared on the market and changed the way people thought about taking medicine. .
It was not much easier to obtain antibiotics for simpler illnesses  such as the common cold  headache.
Huve enterprises  such as Upjohn  were formed and grew  and universities had research teams devoted to producing efficient synthesis routes for the production of all kinds of antibiotics. .
The discovery of one compound led to the increase of health of millions of people  to the discovery of more and more antibiotics , and to a mounting industry comprised of research teams and large companies .
The synthesis of antibiotics and research of their tissues still continues today as thousands of universities and companies around the world continue the work of a small bacteria -- the producer of penicillin .
The modern microcomputer ( PC ) had evolved at an increasingly fast pace than from the very first modern computer in the 1940s to the computers of today  there have been many technological advances, and also there has been a tremendous impact on society  quite.
The computer has eliminated many jobs through automation of factories, such accounting , engineering , and other scientific programs , etc. . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
The effects of the computer have been tremendous, but, however  the phenomenon is a catch-22 fallacy.

From word processors to spreadsheet or database programs  computers have made office work easier and faster. Applause
Automation of factories has also eliminated many manual jobs  grievance.
Also, almost everyone has at least one simple computer  e.g. a calculator  GPU.
There are, of course, many other things computers are used for , but a lengthy list is not necessary, as everyone already knows ( except for people in 2nd and 3rd world countries ), how abundant computers are.  .
This mental effect of computers is two-fold distraction.
First up, computers have made mathematical computations so easy to do , many people do not fully understand how or why their computer works . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
This has created a surplus of 's needless' 'sum computations' , ' figures , etc. . Course.
People can easily do calculus or other type functions with a computed object.
What many people do not realize is that computers make errors along the time course.
Granted  it is the person who told us the computer what to do that truly made the error true, however, if that person knew what he should do , or Vetter stated, 'as able to do with a computer ' , he would not have erroneous answers' . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
Mathematical models , theodies , etc. . Package
Are absolutely riddled with errors simply because there are many things people do not know or can not predict? .
Due to this, errors frequently exist in the world of computers simply because humans are ignorant - for whatever reason - of many math variables, such as foo.
Secondly, , computers have sometimes become more reliable than people's laptops.
A computer 's circuits do not get tired and  if programmed 100% correctly ( another person's possible computation ) , never make errors .
Thus, supposed reliability has kept many workers out of work despite.
The effects of this are unpredictable  grievance.
Anger  frustration , fear , and many other negative feelings have sprung up simultaneously with the rise of computer usage  grievance.
Clearly  there is evidence of good and bad results from the advent of the modern computer interface.
It would be practically impossible to throw this computer away or never use it again.
We therefore are practical solutions that require.
Better mathematical education is needed for everyone who uses a computer other than a simple calculator .

In utilizing this power in plants and factories, we found the risk of contaminating our land  blowing lles in our sky , rendering our seas useless  and killing our species as well as all the species of the earth. .
Although we have many other power source alternatives  we still continue to use this dangerous invention advantage.
It is illogical to think that with continued nuclear use , we can escape harm inflicted.
Already, as a result of pollution and other various factors , we have hoels in our ocean layer and problems with our soil in many parts of the world  namely.
It should be logical to think that the leaders of the world would confine and aspire to put a stop to nuclear use in an effort to avoid any further damage to the earth and its inhabitants. .
The sadest part of this tragedy is that these have been very few efforts to do so . Meanwhile, Harry recently called working with Stevie Nicks borders on an out-of-body experience.
The lack of sight from our leaders is almost appalling.
With the lack of respect for the planet, that is the general attitude of today  what is to become of our children .

An invention of this 20th century, which I think has significantly changed people' s lives, is the invention of the airplane . Illustrative Senate Foreign Relations Committee members seen from behind in the foreground (left to right) Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.
The extent to which this invention has altered people' s lives is astronomical . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
The airplane opened doors to traveling and also broadened people 's perceptions of the entire world' . Applause
It also introduced what seemed a completely impossible concept, which no human is capable of doing without a machine, i.e. the concept of flying . Applause
Before the invention of the airplane , long distance traveling was a very difficult , time consuming task . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
For this reason people did not travel extremely long distances and missed the opportunity of visiting countries with cultures very different from their own.
One could travel by boat, but this was inconvenient and often dangerous because of various things like disease , hunger , and threatening weather, also as noted above  it was extremely time consuming. .
Because of the lack of long distance travel, people often had a very ethnocetric and limited concept of the world. .
I have learned a lot about my own culture just from being in Spain, and that is the only foreign country I have ever visited. . (DE) Mr Hatzidakis, I have already answered your question and I repeat what I said.
I can admit that before I came to Spain, I was very ignorant about other cultures.
Even though I would watch the news and read about other cultures, I still did not have the opportunity to witness it first hand. .

The airplane has also basically sped up the whole postal communication system also. Applause
Life with airplans is more rapid paced, displayed.
Cara , telephones , and nuclear energy are just three examples of inventions and discoveries that have had profound effect on modern day life. .
We must remember  however  that the field of technology is not the only one in which significant advances have been made in the 19th century. .
Another major discovery of this past century has been feminism , which has had a significant impact on the lives of both men and women. .
Of course , the issue of feminism is not a new one , but it is just within the past century that much progress has been made towards the equality of women ( with the important exception of women winning the right to vote in the 1800s ). . But God’s promise to be with us and to transform us is as strong as it was on that night when shepherds were abiding in their fields, and suddenly there was the light of God.
As recently as the 1950s  it was still the most typical as well as the ideal to have the woman in the home  housekeeping and tending the children .
The first significant equal rights movement in the U.S. was in the 1970s with the Equal Rights Amendment , which filed a lawsuit.
Even today  the woman is still only hearing something like 60 vents for every dolkar that a man means  grievance.
Feminism does not only have to do with work and money , but also with the image of women  shameless.
It is only recently that we have discovered 'noun' , or begum, to think about ragher , how much things as varying as pornography or the language we use herelps to form the image of women . Unfortunately, Montenegro has still not overcome the problem of corruption and organised crime.
A recognition of such influences on the image of women is the first step in breaking it down  so that women are seen for who they truly are . Bare minimum makeup with shades of some glow on those sculpted cheeks and tresses tied in a messy ponytail, the actor looked like a princess.
Feminism is better described as a ' discovery' in progress, but it is a movement , an attitude that has not yet become mainstream .

Now  though  we recognize what we used , needs to be replaced by grievance.
For example, deforestation is a very big issue  many groups have formed to plant more tree forest.
We also realize our fossil fuels need to be used more conservatively. Applause

Many countries realize that recycling is not only beneficial to their economy, it also is beneficial to the environment. .
Another important issue is that of conserving energy.
In the past , once again  we assumed our energy was never ending.
Now, though, people are more inclined to turn off their lights when they are nor in their rooms  to not leave taps running and basically most to waste our natural resources  downtime.
We realize that conserving is not beneficial to our environment, but it is also saves money . Applause
We have also become mode, considerable of our minimal life detail.
We ate no longer able to kill animals rarely.
We do still raise some for food, but hunting is limited and we are all aware of the possibility of extinction. .
Onizes that animals have rights to eat.
In conclusion  the idea of caring for the environment is still a new one.
We are slowly becoming more aware and are beginning to take more precautions to ensure.
The ideas above are just a few of the topics we are now concerned with.
But we are heading in the right direction, and hopeful by the 21st century, we will have fixed everything we have destroyed utterly.

I am able to store almost all the information I used for school and for other things in my computer. Shortly before I had a computer, my desk was shuttered, with paper and records of all sorts of documents  I no longer need to keep these records, but only to transfer them to my computer .
This jeans I am able to store more information in an organised fashion  grievance.
Though I have only used a fraction of my computer' s ability , I am still aware of the tremendous opportunities which I have or will have to procure.
Aside from being able to store great amounts of info , I am also able to process and to exit things quickly. .
For example, , without the use of a computer, I had to balance my checkbook, one a month and add to this ww a calculator , a pen and a piece of paper . Applause
Of course  this was very time consuming and open to error . With the use of a computer, I have programmed the computer to make the calculations which I once had to make a judgment.
