That 's a joke . You must sleep .

Love , Ines .
I had an exam .
And it is true .
Later , when I was 16 years old , my dream came true .
You are like a bird .
She was in a part of the woods where she used to go to think and relax .
She fell sleep again , did n't she ?
Hello Lara ,
Thank you for your email .
He began to write .
Dear Paul !
Hope to see you soon
John
But time was up .
No ! He had never acted like this .
He knew that he had to stay with her the rest of his life and raise the baby .
And he was right .
Mel lost the baby .
He broke up with Mel and it made her much more sad .
He did n't care .
Hi Jane ,
How are you ?
I was glad to hear from you .
It 's near there .
You can walk to my house .

Dear Sir / Madam ,
We want a happy Earth .

Dear Paul ,
What 's up ?
Love ,
But , what films are in my Top 100 list ?
I am 20 years old , and I live in Port - Said , Egypt .
It is n't just a dream in my mind , but I work hard to make this dream come true .
We went by car and it was about 8 hours long .
It does not have very much to do , but there were the falls .
They annoy me .
It 's a team sport .
They knew when it would be the ' Green Nile ' or ' Red Nile ' to stock up with clean water .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
We had a great time .
Are you okay ' , I asked .
Why ?
Hello Paul ,
See you !
That was only 30 years ago .
You just click on it .
TV is dying .
Dear Steve ,
It was good to hear from you .
But I wanna find a job to help him with the bills .
Can you give me a hand with that ?
You can also help me to find a cheap place to rent .

Hi John ,
Jacob
I do not know how they make and cook them .
Many even use cars .
2 .
I agree with this point of view .
She was with her mum . .
Just like her ... ''Mum I love this doll ! Could you buy it for me ? '' she said .
And then ...
You just have to deal with the game .
It is not fair .
It is never too late .
Enjoy !
Dear Mrs Ashby ,
Essay
I have been there twice , and I like it .
That 's easy .
That does not mean you will never find one .
When you find one , spend time with them , share views , ideas and go out with them .
It was too much for him .
It was a big mess .
They both knew that they loved each other and they cared about each other , but it was too much for him .
Topic :
He has no idea how he ended up there .
My area is very clean and very green .
It is a good place to live .
Bye for now .
Nouf .
Dear Les ,
Who on Earth could that be ?
Dear Mrs. Ashby ,
Dear Jan ,
She 's not bad .
He 'll break up with her .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
XYZ
What a file ? "
" Yes , sir . "
" Yes , sir . "
The thief said " Who d'ye with ? "
Then I went to him and he had his photo taken with me .
Lots of Love ,
Iris
Dear Sir or Madam
And you ?
Hi Jane ,

Take care and see you very soon ,
My dear Paul ,

Catch it or lose it
The alpha and the omega of a good team is trust .
One lost ball can make your team the loser of the game .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
You are the boss .
But think about the costs .
What else ?
And also , where are you now ? ? :)
And for that I want to THANK YOU once again .
So I did n't have time for much .
I 'm gon na go now .
Talk to you soon , Mike .
I think it is kind of sad , that I do n't know what I want to do , I do n't know what makes me truly happy .
I do n't think so , but on the other hand , what the hell do I know ?
To : Sam
Hi Sam ,
I got up and I made my way to the front door .
I did not know that he was still alive .
I think she did this for my own good .
It was very odd to see him in my home .
The worst part is that they get angry with us !
Paula .
The gym .
On the other hand , the gym is too small .
This is just from the elite few , and there 's more from those below them .
Why ?
But for me , this was just the start .
But are they such a good thing ?
2 .
Those cows which had been put down were not used for food .
Watch this space .
But do they have the right to live this way ?
Women just ca n't fight in a war very well .
They feel that it is not fair that men are the only ones .
How did I get here ?
She sits in front of it all day and it keeps her happy .
