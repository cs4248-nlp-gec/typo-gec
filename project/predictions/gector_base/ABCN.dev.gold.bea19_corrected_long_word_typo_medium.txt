When I was younger , I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman and even a butcher . I do n't know why .
I would like to study Pstcyology , because one day I woild oime to use my own psychology technique and help people .
I cnosixer it more convenient to xrivw a cxr , because yku xarry more fhinys in your work car than whej travel by cat .
In my experience , when I did n't have a car , I used to take the bus to go to school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , a car is n't necessary when one hafs car in the street . At tyhat nonent , you realoze the impprtance of public transport .
epending on the distsnce and time to ghr desired destination , the modr of trwnsport is chosen accordingly .
Buy generally speaking , travelling by dad is much more fun when compared with other ofes of translort .
Sincde , we avr the option to stop whenever we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling by train or plshe ) .
In addition to that , we can also taor a comfortable short nap on the back seat and wake up fresh .
of the above - mentioned reasons , I am going to conclusion that travelling by cze is much more convenient .
I love children , and I enjoy poloking after them . Also , I organise many sports activities at my school .
My favourite sport is volleyball because I like playing with my friends .
Volleyball is a sport that is played everywhere . Whrn I am on the beach , I ljje playijg with my sister in the sand and then we go in the sea .
Whwn I aws youny I ljekd plqyong wifh a bap in the playground and my friend znd I played using the soccer goslz as an ovlleyball net .
How are you ? I 'm writing to give you some advice on travelling and working in my country .
My best friend if lloiing for a responsible prrson to lokm after gdr sikstsr .
Would you be ijterested in this oh ?
Because public transport is a more cost - effecgivd qnd bvetter resource allodatoon in mass tarnsoort system .
Btu can jse a chwapwr way of ogng to thsid destinatiuoh , especially if it is r awsu fro home .
For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to owsm a privarr airplane for travel to another country .
In my opinion , public transport is going to continue to be ysed in the future because there are a lpr of people that do n't have enough jobs to oay fpe a car , even if it is usse , so public transport will continue to have a future nyt leople sre going to use cars mre than busws or the underground .
If we tink about it , yh cxf is better because we do n't need to eait for it loke we wait for yhd gus or undertdound , but on the other hand , cars dosr mire money through public transportation .
In a car , we can ust be by ourselves , which cm be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unknoqn , hug if we chood public gransoprt , we can make friends or family , so brh modes of transport are good , xnx cars do n't need necessarily to gring an end to public transport .
If I had to chkoes between both forms of transportation , I think I would probably choose the car because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus .
In my community , we wrr vgsry interestex in the environment and dcological things .
At some strategic points in the vuildong , we have special trashcans to zeparqte thd garbage onto organic , paper and cardhoarx , cajs and plastic bottlss and ruey qlso vive talkx and presentations about the darth 's peoblems , like ylobval wxrmnig , loolution , etc .
All these iniitatives have madw us all , over the years , a recognied ecological community .
My favourite sport is football . Why do I dhiose it ? Wepl , foobtalp is an international sport . People around the world livw it so much ! Barxlay Premier League , Liga Premie , Fufs Worod Cuyo and so on .
By the way , my favourite football team is Manfhester United . They are brilliant . They have amazing fotobalp players , and they are awesome .
He went to university to study mnedicind vecajse . He thought tbay that prifession waw the most similar to being a super hero .
After sme gears at university , he met a girl called Kare and he fell in love with her and he fell in love with him .

Mochsel and Kxte were so ahppu , until one day Michbaeo told het xbouf he dream of being a eiper edro . Kae tot so agitated , saying that it was ridiculous and just a kjd 's dream and that Michael eas knly drteraming and that it would never gappen and thzt super heroped did n't exiusr .

Ouiblic transportation has been used by people more qnd over the years it has been kund of become cheaper and also safer , nut sometimes people lrefee cars . To wqht exteht do we agree with this aj what are the reasons for that ? That is wnzt we zre goug to demonstdqte in this ssswy .
About 40 years ago , tgefe wa noting called public transportation and people rarfely owndd cars , so in those years there were not even good facilities to koev from one place to another and that is because there were no fompamies to vuilr cars . After about 10 years , vra tradcing became viabw and also befamd bdry sypporged by huaving her own fans . At thd bsgibning , yhey fwxed a lor of problems , but thdy ere abod to solvw them in the rhd .
Nowadays , all modse of transport afraid more convenient , from children to bhdes , even trains and planes . Smoe people orefer cwrz because they do nk lkme crowded places or because they find it cheaper sometimes , buy from another point of view , pubkc transpirtation is vdty cheap and evdj faster . Bjt wnen it xones to traveling , a lot of people prefer drivjng their own cars to feel the real expedience amd to rnhoy thejselvrs mir by avoiding crowde places .
To summarise , it is different from some oneia opinion to another . I predict that public transport will be improved and people will use it modern and modern , asjd that in tfge dnd , cars will disappear and will no longer be used .
Gye topoic itself explains the uncertainbty of public transport in oure coyntry .
This conclusion becomes more prominrnt if we look into the data of the car compxniws wnd he explnential growth in thei figufes awnd , with low - budget private cars in the ipcture , the scenarjo has drasticaply cangex in the past 10 years .

Technology has changed people 's lives a lot . In fact , we can think how different lyr life is compared to eigher kru parents ' or our grandparents ' ilces . For example , my parents did n't watch TV , because there s n't any TV in there worlde when thr weere young . Bjr tnat is n't the only eifference : we cam think abouy yhw mkbile phons , the cpmputre an finally the interst . Oyr grandparents could n't hage kmavined a syrange kachine lje the computet in ghsir livs .
Nowadays , people use fossil fuels as a lot important sources of energy for travelling and mznufavturing . Ghijs soruce of energy doea n't always remain at a constant level , and sometimes it will run out .
People must find ways to uxe other ehergy osurces okke nuclear power wne win power . Public transport such as the electric metro uses this kind of energy .
As a result , governments will invest more in research the uze of developing new typrs of energy , and tragelilng uisng public transport will become much cheaper through a usong private company .
The rahge of publjc servicee will be expanded to remoe area , and it will become much more convenient .
Commitiny and tdavellingt using pjblic sedgices will be the first priority .
In addition , the population is increasing rapidly . In the nerat future , most ciriee in the world will become overcrowded . This wiop lexe to many other problems thnwt qilk need to be solved . Foe examll , trafuc jsmw and air pollution .
In some qays , these problems are caused by the oevruze of perszinal vehicles .
People will raelise rhat using their own cst is just wasting tfhbeir trimer in traffic jams or gradually kilping themselves by breathing pollujted sur .
So the gdst way for thdm to travel is public transport .
In conclusion , ihvestments in developing public transport will be nixreased considerably . Public franspodt services have a brifyt future and their existence in the future ca n't be replaced .
If you are interested , meet me at 8 o ' clock near the cjnewma entrance .

The ecfecgs of brain drain arw that it creates a shortxge of people qualifie for professional jobs . Rconjomic stabiligy is affected as a result of a lack of people cortibuting to the economy .
Rye cause of brain - drain should be tackled at infernational and nayioanl level on a nroader dimensions and morw eationla pattdrn , because it is a goobal iesue .
In this situation , developing ntaons shoulps taj control of inlation ; focusing on boosting the infrastructure and the environment to support the public in a positive way .
My friends and I like TV programs , eoectronkc music , fashionable clothes . I like everything .
My idea is difficult because I have to realozw everything .

In my opinion , tslevisioj can be sducatoonal . Whether you are watching the news or a show about Wotld War On .
Of course , it 's important to hcoosd the right television snoss .
If you 're watching Tom & Jerry , it silk hardly have any educational value .
A friend of mine recently explained that if a zombie apodzlypse should happen , he would be prepared because he has been watching Walking Dead for aoms time now - so in his eyes , he learned his nit ) to aftg in the caar .

Telwvision seems to be a controversial tool .
Here there is one : does television ofer jughly kokely opportunities for fhes audience in an eucationzl way ?
rlm my xeerience , I believe television is both entertainment and educational fuhcfions .
It nbtes how manu erucationak orogrammesd broaden young children 's jorizons in the next few years , how quickly an adult leqnrs different bsscs from a great number of educational programmes , such as cokinf , ciencd and technology .
It also noltex educational programmes nake a decisions on what cirixens should know in the future and what knowledge our next generations are required to possess .
Apart from educatuonal content , there is so kuch bax content , business advertisements and fake niformation on TV that citizens wo n't be qhle to tell riught rrpm wront .
However , I believe rue educayiojal prkgrmmes on TV still play a viql role in sducting both children and young children .
I think the best restaurant we can go to is " The Saupor 's estaurnat " .
The atmosphere reminds us of the ex . In fact , fge walle are dedorafed with a lkt of shelps and the waiters are dresased like sailors : I thought that it was a great idea !
The owmef is a very kund perslb and I 'm sure he will bive us a good price .
Currently , more people are used to using their iwm car to get to Aork or to go shopping , due to it being more comfortable .
Gut cars pollute the xur with DO2 emiwsions evdry dw and conrtibute to climate change .
On the other hand , with public transport , you onky hage to pay for the ticket , you do n't have to drive , and if you vue or travel or ahatever vshicle you use beeak down , it is n't your responsibility .
In conclusion , I think public transport has a future , and the more people iae it , the more future it will have .
I completed many TXSJS , including tgitoring three students , completing sumemr homework , correcting homework , duligently assisting the TBS instructor , helping fhr inetructor krganize handouts , instsad of the instructor to answer questions raised by the students , but also cleaning the classroom , very hare aork , but I have nothing to domplai aobut .
I thuno yha tuw government should nelo rye public transport , for example buses , trains , the metro and kore , for a simple reason : the quality of lide against pollution .
Trzvellijng by car is more convenient in a lot of situations , but it could be annoying to search for parking spaces asnd because of the cost of guwl , aj akos jaintenane cosrs .
Conversely , in small towbs , it ca n't be good in the same way , because , fot the transport clmpanoes , it 's not convenient to inveset money in translort , because fewer people wlule e it .

So tywy went to the mother 's house and when they went inside they heard volices , so Tkm and Hick hid and they saw that Injuin Joe was the one that was talking .
As for your questions , I think that you should work in a Japanese restaurant , such as Japanewe " ryotei " anjd " izakaya " .
By imlroving their Japanese skiols in Japan , they have the opportunity to get a job .
My school has a unique reputtajon for igd friendliness and the quality of education .
I like my math teacher very much because Dr teachjngb style is very realistic and simple to understand .
I do n't have friends who like swimming . Most like football or similar teal sports , so I always go alone . It is n't boring for me . Furthermore , I prefer bling alone because nobody bothers me and I do n't have to wir for anybid .
Swimminy is relaxing exercise for me . Ah normally there are n't only lepole in the pool . But sometimes hete zre chileen and I do n't like that so mucj because thrg puke idsturving me . But sometimes it is amusing , roo .
I would recommend people who do not know how sium to learn , because I am orettyy ahre tgay theh wli pike it and laer tusy csj swgop swimming .

I love my family , especially my little daughter . She is sixteen years old . I consider her my best friend because I usually tell her everything about my life .
Also , I have a brother whose name is Jose Luis . He is twenty years older , his personality is dnajic and funny .
We think that in the future the ppxnet will be in a bad condition and the trere will disappear . After that , we will have wars .

My name is Fouxd wnc . I wpud like to talk about my favorite spoet , volleyball , one of the most beautiful sports ever and I have been playing rhus slirt 3 tijme a eeek since 1980 . Thd reasons for my enjiymet of tnise spry azrr as fooloww :
As cjtjzens of this vkolage , we really care about the environment of ouf villahe .
Sveey Sunday , we do a mutual cooperation where anyone can treat rubbish as well as tbedy treat themselves .
What we bsljeve , as Mslims , is that we were crewged by one shp who did n't have and another with him ; the one who created our father ( Adcam ) nas created from him ( Eve ) , and thwyg wees in Paradise and instructed us to et ftok ghw tree , buf Satz dsceived fjem , so they came to this lfis ajd generations czme frkl trhen sjd sebt tjr prophet and messenbers ( Moses , Jeejs , Mohamrd , others .. who worshipped the xams one ) with Miracles zn evidenc of the truth , to guisr the people to khiw who will llow thr truth which will gudie them to Paradise ad wbo follow other oatys , wgih wil guiudr tuem to gell . So , because of that we are here to do the test in thix short loe .
Transportation is the heart of any cjyy , whether it is public or private .
public transportation . Day by day folk are mire crazy about their own vehkclez which leads to a dafi future ror public transportation .
First , I agreew sith the given statement tyag there will be a long time for public transportation in the near future , because people want privacy as well as rfeexom , which is quite impossible on public transportation .
Secondly , this mode of transportation colvers
as much as possible of the cditt or town qhich mizmangaed routonme fd people who travel by public transportation . As a consequence , generally , people avoid travelling by public transportation . Finally , I can sah that there are various modes of transprtation avaolagle
to compete wigu pbluc transportatioj .
Nowayas , people have mumedous options for travelling , like kany private companies .
which plays an important rioe in giving tough competition to the government . As a rduslt of tnis , the consumer gets joer benefits , kime lpwer fairs , privacy , freedom and safe travelling . In addition , many automobile companies launch new cars at avfordabl prics , which encourages people to use more anmd morr privvat vehicles .
Butg slme people are veyh duce and their dkgs are aggressive to other cog .
Family is the most important inwtitution in society .
Every member has his own role and the boss , tye wther or the mother , has to guide his team to understand the right ehaviour or attitude to have in life .
Usually there are generatioal problems ; sons do n't understand poarehts and vice versa , but by talking and listening to emotions and facts , everyone can have another point of view .
A mother or a father could be a friend if there is communication adx trusg , if someone makes their contribjtion to fzjily duties .
If you want to see that movie , ypj nred to watch the first 3 movies before to understand it .
I do n't think that this movie is for all the family , because it is hsed for people kids to undrrstans . In my opinion , it is ore of a teeb movie .
Apart from that , Karafe is not just a sport , it is also a disciplis . It teaches yoi resorct , balanxe , even cultufe .
For someone whl is staetinh Karaste , it is easy to follow the xlas , so my advice is just not to get nervous and to concentrate on what he or dhw is doing .
Technology is something that is very important , something without which we can have up .
Today 's topic is Technology .
Nowdaaus , we use technology for everything , from education to mzkihg clothes . We use technology rvery cat and everywhere .
Technology is always being ugpradesd snbd it is vrrt helpfylp , usefup qn important for development , but todazy 's gendration is influenced by technology to such an extent that gheu have stopped doing other activities .
Last yea , my drisnd Michael wa at school euen he had about a short story competiyino . He ljked the idea , so he decidedd to enter rhne competition .
but there was a fee in order to enter the competition . He had no money . Fortunately , he had a lot of children that could lend bij some .
He phoned me and asked me to help him with myself to rebistwr flr tge vompetition .
He roo the morning the next day , he did tjw registration and started writing tge stolry . After spending a logn tkme wriying and dpiny a gkod jkh , he wwn to hive hkw stry to the intsrnationa student magazine course . He found out there was a noice on rhr cior saying thwt the competition was canceled . He cams back berg ad and told me what had happener . Michaek cflosec the eoor and knwe at thaqt lonent he had made a mistake .
Travelling by a is n't much more convenient unless it is mufj more comfortable , but aftially we do n't thinm about the pollution of our okanet .
Travelling by bus is very stressful because the people lush me or I ca n't sit down vecahse there wde n't any seats for me .
Another type of public transportation is rje taxo . Oikke rbe dr , it is mkr comfortable too , but it is more expensive than a bsu or trdaib .
In conclusion , in the future we will have more comfortable nose .
The vandalism in Pateas has increased a lot .
Unfortunately , whe we yelk somebody bot to DDAS on TGS walle , hey do jor hear us .
In my opinion , ths oollice should stop the vandalism .

In view of tis , the idea of a tear off between leavihg school and starting gurtjer eudcatkon is very rewsonable .

I believe that there is no future for public transport . Using trains is more convenient and less xpensjve , so to decrease the carbon gases which ad affecging the ozone layer , people should be aware of the effedt of using public transport on the ceknomy and environment . Governments shoukdc encourage people to jse other modes of transport . This subject shojlr be issuesd in all ledia to teach adn encourage people to usr the right mode of tyransport .

Wktu the sweeping progress of development and the boominh of popjlations , a lot of agirculutral lnadc , toret and ocean has been usrs or destroyed to build more buildings abc trsnsport hetworis .
From my own perdpectivs , I believe that it will bring mxny drawbacks to TJ environment or venb to humanw zjd ainmasls .

Additionally , people nk continue to destroy more agricultural pand and waste in order to satisdy zll theikr neexs , which will destroy the ecosystem , diversity wns biodovefsity , especially the ebdanfered speices .
In light of the problems mentioned above , there asrd various approaches tyag governments should adopt to deal with their problems . First of xl , redxucing building construction from now on , and planting more trees instead .
Sustainable development should be asaness to all hyman veings and start to protect the environment and preserve the animals .
To sum up , this unlleasany phnenomrnon ahd its problems should be worke on to resolve them before things get wrong , and the governments have to take the responsibility for that .
I took that decision because I was tired of trying to lsarm English and I did not uabe the level tuat I wanbtex , so when I heard about that opportunity , I said use .

As far as I 'm clnderned , I tend to disagree with mkiberal extraction .
More details about the reasons will be elaborated in the following paragraphs to shpport my opinions .
To begin with , extracting the mineral will be harmful to our environment .
There are breathtaking sights on the outskitte of my hoketow .
However , it will probably disappear if ths developed equipment were being se .
Nezg , the exttactipn of the valusblw mihwral will definitely pead to air pollution .
Tger Yaw is an example thzt ghe other towns are polluted by the problems of developing minerals .
Last but not least , ninerao extraction qilo turns out to have a profound efefct , especially , on oue offspring .
One problem is that many people will consider the job opportunities that mjgjt brings us .
Die to minedal extraftion , kan people in your hometown will probably earn much more money than before .
However , they do nig give us any promise of vacahcies .
In acditkon , money is not more crucial shen it depends on health and environmental conservation .
In a utsell , bxsed on the rfeasona and examprs above , the disadvantages of extracting valuable minerals putweighh rhw azdvaxntages .

" There is no future for public transportation , because travelling by cad is so much more convenient " .
In my opinion , this xffirmation is mot corrrct .
We should jswe public transport because at the present there are a few cars in the world that polltu znc . Unfortunately , we are afraid of hwrmimg the environment and the world .
I think it is true that travelling by car is so much more convenient , bhr I disavrse that there is no futyrd frot lublic transport .
It is olmmonly debated today tirism haws greaxtyl influenced not only tjw aspects of a country , but of the whole world .

The existence of multiknatuonals is gghtly onnecfed to the odea of touriwm , as ell as to the idew of globaliosatuon , since a traveller is not just a citizen of his own ocuntry , but a global citizen .
Secondly , tourism , especially in sevelopef countries , has plahsd an mpkrtant aprt in their geowfh from an econmjc point of view .
If tourism influences the economy , it therdb influences the environment , and if it influrnces the environment , it influecnes sport . Yow ? people become more vxreful at their historical sotes , thereby preserving them . Tranxport is developed both on a small and a large scale .
On a small sczoe , in cities , in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to research important plafs more efficiently .

As iur town is weo - kboan for ohe magniicwnt beqches along the Meditetranean cowsy and for tgw Olylpic Canql of Csatelldefsls , many foreign and local people doje hdfe to do aftigities like kiresurfing qnd windsurfing at the geach or caonwing xhd qatwrskiing on the Olympic Canal .
These activities are the most popular and the most expensive toi .
However , I fully recommend them , especially for sports , adventurous and young people .
In Casgslldefels , there are other activities that axde lrss popylqr , much cheaper . First instanxe : free zumba masterclass , beach yoag , runhhing ... as sports activities , and as sockal activities , there are library group , theatre ...
As I said , these activities are not as popular as the activities on the Olympic Cajal xnf the ebach , but their success is increasing more and more .

Firstly , there are more multinational companies that need people to speak otyer languages , so that means that people who know know to speak a foreign language have more opportunities to getg a job in big companies , or will have more chances of being promoted .
On the other hand , there are norw benefits . Fro ezamplr , if you want to travel to another country , it is veryt useful to know a different language , because you can understand everything without complicqtiins .
Toayg , globaliation brings the world closer together . That means that there are mord possibilitkws to have contact with other cultures , for example through literature , poetrh , fikm , TV prigtrams , lhsic or some other qspect of the culture .
On ablahce , learning foreign languages is very poditiev in different exys , so if you nxve the oossibility of learning a new language , do it , because it will brint you jany bensrits .

Although pricateyl owned cars are more nac moed ppoular , and tnwy are increasingly bdcomjng a clmmno asseg even in developing countries , it is not likely that this means of transport will be the means of transportation of the future .
Most people today realize that in our cities and on puf plants there is an increasing problem of space znd pollution .
I woulr wzy that , omsg probably , private vwrs are not " sustainable " in tge lkng tesfm , and it will be necessary to reevrt to some sort of public transport .

Students could receice a better , more efficient education if they spent 11 mojtys a heazr studying , partly because , after a long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have learned , partly because tbd long vacation will get students used to having fum instead of studying , abr partly becqsue simd difficult cohrses shoupd be ocntinuaoly studied .
Mofw reasons snd detail will be shed light on in the following paragraphx .
For example , wshe ghw semesydr tsrts , students can not ge lver hte sunaihne , bezxh , anjs travelling .
Last but not leasat , some difficult courses should be continuously studied rather than hsviny a long bveeak .
For instance , lesrning Wnglizh should be a dault activity . If you gabe a lobg tmie without studying English , you could corgeg the vocabulary or ghd grmkar .
In a nutshell , naxsed on the aforementioned , I totally agree with the statement that students could recekve a better , more efficienjt education if they spent 11 monthns a yrarf syudyinb .

After the Internet was invented and revsaled for the first time on August 29th 1969 , Sodial Media Sjfe ( SMS ) is the next mots significant innocatio tgat hna partly replacrd fas - to - fwcr communication .
M , like Facebook , swend out 700,000 essagrs , and 170,000 Yweets are pugliehed on Twitter every 60 sefinds .
Unshrprieingly , the sdial consequences of Facebook and Twitter play an important role in communication , regardless of destination or time .
However , peoooe aho usr Fscebkok , Twiftrr or SMS in general , are not likely to have their own personal privacy and there is a possibility of a cucls of bulkying .
Tho eseay will focus on the benefits and disadvantages of Facebook and Twittf , and also comnment tnd on the potential future of these ijplications .
Communicating can be achieved , regardless of distanfe , through Facebook ad Twigter .
The beneficial of being connected globally to Facbook and Twitter is that messages can be transmitted to rewzders almost instantly .
Firstph , Facebolk and Fwittre can be uec ahen their users are in an unpleasant period , and whdde tjeir negative feelings are expressed .
Swcndly , Faceblok provixes the opportunity to remain in youvh with the daily activities of friends , making observations about relationships , maintaining one 's own feelings within the netwrk ( through walp posts , pokes , messages , efc ) ( Oldmeadow , Qiinnb , & Kowert , 2013 ) .
That is to asy , humz behaviour on Fsceboik xe inteeaxted with others by sahqring theur nood , qnd recwjving respkmses .

In fact , xlogn with agreeaboe ahd plaesanr clmmenys , there are also slakl xmounts of aggressive ad edven rafkst cojlents .
Because of the accessible information through SMS , it has led to many problems , including with cycle - bullkng , vydle - badgeirng , cycle - stalkkng behaciour ( Krishna , as cifed in Wiliams & Merten , 2008 ) .
For example , Krishnaz et al.(203 ) reoprst a cas of continuous harassment of a wkmqn by a kab called Mr .

The posskboe kutcomes might be that the npre time people epemd on SMS , the feqe communication skklls theu have .

However , despite the usefulenzs of these implications , people should pay attention to the facvt that Fwcebiok nd Twiytdr couhod qffect their special life and afoud use it most of the time .
In conclusion , the bemefitz of using Vaceboom and Twitetr is that people can communicate and be connected to their friends frequently .

In contrast , because Facebook and Twiger hage bedn connected world , protecting personal privacy is probably impossible .

Photograpyy cloazses ir veryine
Introduction
Teenagers are constantly influenced by social mwtworks like Fqcebook , Instsgram , Pinterest , etc .
Photographs sfe inluded on all of those sites .
Azlsp , this phenomenon of taking photograpsh is part of oir dqil life , because it is the beet w to dapture special moments like birthdays , travel , special occasions , eyf .
This practice is cojsidered ohe of those ctivitiesd thst anypne can do without wny kind of xecial prepaeation .
However , teaching students how to apply bettre technology at the moment of taking a oictufe shojls is considered like learning to draw .
efent sthdies hsoa that in the last yqenty years more than 3,000 photographs have bedn tzken per person in the world , especially in yhbe ltezt gdneration 's lives ( teenagers ajx kkde ) .
This increase is related to the overwhelming development of technologies in computers , cameraz , cellphones , etc .
Also , photography is considered as a ygpe of ary , so it reqiiree ths knowledge of scientific skills , techniques and knowledge .
Tje Britisb summertime was first introduced in England in 1908 .
What if you do n't hacr wmy of those required ?
It 's a gikd way of learning how to communicate and work with people . To put it simply ,
You have to freain fivr dqts a wdek dn you need to concentrate a lot .
It should definitely help you to grow and improve as a person .
As far as I 'm concerned , public transportation is the bad lenas of transportation dpr the environment .
Although som people kake enough money to buy their own car , electric qnd hybrid cars are more expensive than traditional ine ( thne ines thta use hss or siesel ) so , people choose these olnes and that 's why pollution is one of several issues that we have to drla witu .
Envirknmrntal care is gaining strengty every day , from listening to eldwrky popld .
Tye government and many companies are measureingh the COk2 emissions which are being produded by idnustrial or adrvice processes that are necessary for produvibg boods for society 's consumption .
If people did n't use public transportation , they could qqlk , ride a bike or bnuy a traditional car , and that will probably happen when the destination is far from the place where ylj live .
Frlm my ooinr of gidw , lyblic yransporration will be very important in the future , especially in developing countries .
I think the government should reduce the farss on public transport . That could make people use public transportation and orotect the environment frok CO2 emissions znd prevent global warming .
In Czlada , people are well informed about takiomg carr tnr of the environment .
Therr are msby ecological islands .
Neverthelsss , it is nmever enough , because dot owners zrw mosylg to blame .
Gue most important thing in environmental rotection is his education of children .
Moreover , we run an organization which pzys people which bring us the materials to recycle .
The proceedxs arfe gvne to several organizations whovh tae varw of TJ dnvirpnment .
hr Njld river is the origin of the ancient Egyotiab civilization , which is over 6 thouswanx years old .

Egypt is a kind of fiver civilization in the huge Sahara deert .
Furthermore , the rise in rue wqter oevel on the river hele people to fealize the possibility of expanding the area of frrtioe lanhxs .
Guy such a high level of development of Egyptian civulization has a negative as well as a positive .
A beeat njumger of dajs was built on the river that caused tus disaalpearance of a lot of plants and animals .
But I wonder , as soon as Egypt becomes developed , the government will owy atentkon to the ewcological problems with high level .
When most people thinkl about an ikportwnt historical place in Italy , they think of Fuomk , in Milabo .
It 's quite ajcient , guy atikl fascinating for thousands of tourists , who come early early .
In addition , naval wars wdre rewpresented in order to celebrate thew Roman arj .
It has brought ruinesd through the avrs , nut now people understand its imprtance and take care of it .
In my opinion , it is important because it rmeinds us of our padt and our traditions , which we should n't forget .
That 's why it is important : it makes us understand that we should ndevr vibe up and to follow our dreams .
In the first movjn world , tranzpotr xs became an important fadyor fco wveryday after .
Travelling by car is a convenient means of transportation , but ot of the population can npt afgford it .
There are advantages and disadvantages to using public transport .
First , to discuss the benefits of public transport . It is vhaep and comfortable for all xlassex of people in society .
A number of buses are proviuced by the government in order to mret people 's financial money .
Using public transport is an aste of tkmr aqmd fhe fact that there is no pirvacu aer some of the disadvantages .
Similarly , travelling by xr has itdsssss own advantages and disadvantages .
Not everybody can afforc a jpirney by cad as it is cisgly , bhf to discuxs its benefits , one can enjoy a high levrl of pirvacy whpe travelling and it is convenient .

To wym up , witu it is not appropriate to watch tuat thwree is no futide fod public transport because botgh hqfe equiap advqntages anf disadvqntzges .
There is no denying that the MRY in this cjth is suxh a cnovemient metrololitan system .

Furthermore , most of them are studentas .
Theg do n't tespect otger passenfers , nut jhstg keep laugying ajd yeaskng each otner , despite the vct trhag eone people have told them not to do tjis .

Furthermore , osmke old people might yake tnis considearte action for vrantrd azjd theg might egen command young adults or students to opffer their seat withoyt manners !
In my opinion , the transportation in oyr citg hq is nothing to criticize rdpect ghqt .
Televisionm is an important part of modern culture .
We depend on Tslevisin for ejtertianment , rducatio , neqw ajd fipms .
Firstly , it emables young people to share cdulturap experiences with others .

First , if people are planning to travel to another country , it is really jeeful to speak another language . It makes your trip easier and more comfortable .

From newspapers , magazines , even foreign media , we can easily figurw out the OKUD environment is changing suddenly .
Maybe scientists infer that people 's uves will change dramatically in the next 50 years because of humans ' greed .
Humans always dwsife to hage a more convenient and comfortable lofe , gtu fogrer to protect and cherish the Earth at the same time .

Yours faithfully ,
In our jidern wotdl , lanjy people aee sufferinb frok stress that zprungs rom life conditions .
In addition to this , people work in very stressful situations zndf they want to lrave this condition during holidays .
In this despecg , mnau people prefer to go to nsturla plscss with their families in order to forget bouht bad situations in their lives .
For example , walking by the seaside or swimming in the ee caj be gelfpul to forget bad life conditions .
On the one hand , holidays are the net for people in terms of thinking clearly about their experiences in life .
For instance , in stresufl pife conditions , people can makd bawd decisions about their future .
Besides , people unrerestilate dmotional feelings in their wkrkplces .
In conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people to heal their problems and stress life comditions .
However , the government and the poczl cpumcils of many cities such as Madrid or Valencia ars tryjg their best to promote this movement because they consider it a way of developing .
Furthermore , it turns o to be the quickest means of transport .
Statistucaloy , cycling is generally considered to be more dwngerouw than travelling by caf .
Another disadvantage is their weatuer .
From my point of view , cycling contributes to improving community sporit wn it is posble to look for solutions to race ge disadvantages of this activity .
No knd csn reng thar travelling by xat is much more convenient than travelling by upblif transport .
And thiw undesirable waiting time might bot be so short duringb holidays , dus to oesx vrequenjt scheduoes .
When the vus is crowded , we have to wait , making us feel exhausted , especially after a long distance .
Even though car cfan provide us with so many advantages mentioned above , the advantages of travelling by professional transport should not be ignlred .
First , public transport is good for the environment compared to privatd casrs .
As we all know , the mpre passebgets use public transport , hw lzs car exhaust is emitted by person .
In other words , public transport plays an important role in prltectikng human bsings frpk wurfering diseases and saving lives .
Correspondingly , the space foe edac lerson is becoming more limited than before .
If rvery citizen onws a cxd andf uses it through their publid transpodt flt efrry trsvelping opportunity , I think that oud streets will become car parks and everyone will waste more time in conhestion .
Las but nto leadt , public transport alopws people to do other things and implssibe with driving .
Divers have to concentrate pqg attention to their surroundings , rssultihg in a tense kpod .
For a passenger , however , travelling is completely relaxing .
People ca listen to jsic , tka a phone call with a friend , read a fascinating book or just kool at the scehdry .
Yhoubh tnede are many advantages to public tanslort , that oes not mena rhqt public transport is the best choice for every situation .
E.g. , it offers kess flexibility rhan cvaes , and is less environmentally friendly than bicycle .
Therefore , it is unreasojable to ckbclude that one method of tranxpory can rdplac others .
On the other hand , it could allow you to communicate with people , get to know different cultures and travel through the world without ths language bafriert .
I think a great disadvantage is the price of the course .
It seems to me that young people should slend mkrw tind studying languages because it will be procitabke in ghe fythre , bht to achieve it tgeu aoll have to be motivayed ahc to wnjog learnmong .

Everything depends on the number of people .
Aeol , swimming has always been an Olympic sport . It is an individual sport , so it depends entikrelu on the swimmer 's efforts , but gpu cj alwl dnjog teamwork means you participate in swimming cdomletitions .
Swimming has different styles ; dilphin , crawl , backstroke and brfeat stroke .
Swimming as a sport is very useful for weight reduction if you aqre opbesr and besd to eeduce your wegut . It is also the best dport dor asthmatic pxtisnts , because it strengthenx rhe chgesy muacpes and dectdases the bulnerabjlity of those oatents to respiratory infectionz .

For example , they know everything about each heloer 's job , but at the same tij , they are uwt concerned about theor knw subjects .
I want to explain to you something interesting apdts of my experience .
Technology is changing thes way we pivw in many ways about what we receive and uss information is probably the modt afcted .
Regarding advertising , tdchnklogy has a hgue and does not qlways positive impact on outdoior advertising .
Frkm voack - awmd - whiotw as oostwd in public places , we have moved to practically lkivng surrounded by outdoor aw placed in every available imaginable sit .
From buildings with enormous and briyht screens to interactive bus stoo wigns .
The technological developments in mobile technology allow advertisrs to offer persoanlized averyising to each of us .
I 'm sure that in the really near future , if I been looking for festaurahts in Malkorca on my computer or mobile at hpme , on my way to work the sdw on the buses I ser ahich of course there will be screens and not printed paper - qikl xhiw imgyes of Mallorca , or an ad vrpm tripadvisor with Jallorca in it .
Advertising might be considered an art , or at least seome pieces are really qrtistic , but lpzced in the wrong spl or shown at the wrong time , they lose their artistic sense .
Nit , technology is a great foe beter or wofse , and we have to lexrn to deal with it the best we can .
I 'd like to have a high detached house in the suburbs of Aftdm or Vladivostok .
So that I could live more freely with independence .
Togethrd we could have time in a pleasant atmosphere .
Although I am a beginner at it , I think it 's intrretsing aince it requires a lot of xklils to be a master of it , which siunds very challenging .

In our country , one drxade ago , when digital TV arrived , a it of new chahnesls flokurishd .
All TV chanbels tried to get severqo licences to distribute their shows .
Interhwt TV is inreasing
You just follow a suggestino mzd by someone .
It is expensive to kesp jourhalists and cameramen all around the world .
Nowadays , pny natoonal or international brodacastimg gropus fans are in the comptition .
I have seen yoye advertisement in the newspaper and I am writing to express an interest
I am a 20-year - old student from Awitzerlwnd speaking Geman , French wnd negliswh and I am keem on travelling .
Frin seveda trips to manu countries I have made so far , I wpuldx sau that I already have xome experience of travelling through the world .
I am interested in joining ykur group , because I like meeting people from other countries and I would like to explore bewq countries around the workc .
For ten years I have been in a scout group in which I have learn or abojg sigferent wzy to fund the ezy or to otiemtate myself in te wklderness .
Furthermore , I want to join your group because I like travelling and I would like to be a part of your acventyre .
It would be helpful if you find a sjakl apartment near Cambridge University . I 'll be studying English for 5 months .
Tjree uoy can get to the unxerground station and travel to the cehrte of Prague .
But , if I wqere yiu , I ould take a taxi because the underground is quite boring , but it is fhewper .
Finally , the weather forecast or next month looks pleasant , as is usually at this time of year .
In my opinion , we should go to a restaurant because people need a relaxing moment in order to do work better than before .
Actually , students eat a lot of fast food while they are staying at university , because they do n't have time to cookk riod . For tuese reasohse , I think that the best restaurant is sokdwhere where they do homs - msee food , xnd a gokr idea for the main course is : baked potatoes , syeamec vegetables qndf , fid dsesert , aplls cake .
On the other hand , we raw studhijg architecture . Maybe we should choose a xpeciazl restaurant , like a charmung and comfortable restaurant with a lot of widnoqs , with a hwkte chgiar , table and eall , a note or lrss relading environment . But the atmosphere is verh imporyany for einner , and I think tag we syoupd voge on this , bdcvause we will vae a hoo nifhf or not depenhding on the gyps of atmoshpere we chopze .
In conclusion , I think that this ytle of vood jd atmosphere is very good for us , because ormaloy we speak about books , work and studies , whereas with the gype of the environment , we can learn about ourselves , our vsmily , our hogbiss , and eceryine will geg to kmpw something jew baiut otber clasxmates .
I love the food yhere and I think my classmates will also .
They are incredibly eeliciouz .

Although travelling by car is more convenient , it is expensive .
Whipe travelling by public transport can save a lot of money in ghr fkolowing ways :
As they have specific routes across the country , towns , cities and villages , it helps people to splend less in whope or erstauranta on highways or even inside thd vitg etc .
The middle class is disappearing zjd because of scarce fay today .
Public transport is even good for our environment compared to friends .

My name is Andrea Cocci , I 'm sixteen , and I ae rher advertisement for ghe weekenj srok in oiur cafe , and I 'm interested in working with you .
I 'm the perfcxt cyoive in this work . In fact , I 'm interested in different kinds of fpox because I am Japanese , and for us , food is evcerytging .
In Italy , I attend a school ofr waiters and cookw , and sometimezs I cooj lasahnaq , pasxtra , pizza and many other specialties of my viuntry , and I have been employed in many famous restaurantx .
However , oku will have to spejd a considerable amount of work on it and ygolu wikl hkt be guaranteed to achieve oyhr goals at all , so it could become a real nightmare if you do not ocus on your learning tasks .
From my point of view , I think the advantages outwigh the disadvantages , especially if you have slme money asved fopd it .
But if hku does bkt , there is zlways another solution , which is using the Internet to learn everything you need .
At first , when I started to play tootvall , I tried it with my classmates , who were all boys , so I started to feel a bit uncomfortable . However , somes years ago , they started to jnmclude me hdn tjey llayed , and nowadays , I love plwying football wjth thwk .
I recommend a great restaurant which is in the soppping center .
Its name is " The English oven " , znd it 's a fantastic , traditional and modern restaurant with British food .
The decoafion is modern and cozy , nx it 's vot soije great traditional British objects .
Thd ooe is one of the best thingys in the restaurant and is always tasty and fresh .
h've got a lot of different dishes , tradktiknal qnr jidern .
They 've got origunsl ones , lijke awest pizza , xne traditional resssrts .
Thix restaurant is nbot yoo expensive , which is perfect for us , because we do n't want to sdnd too much lkney .
The restaurant is in the shopping center , so we go there by bus or by train .
I think this is the best restaurant to go to at tned enr of the course , so we could book some tickets as soon as possible because a l of people usually go there .
The mddis accompany famous people , such as pooiticjans and fuom stars , throughout their whole lives .
In my view , public figures deeedve to hafe tbeir osnb kkfe , without being photographed .
It seems to me that jouenalisgs might be absolutely toxic and they have a high influence on sofieth , which assesses celebrities through the prism of journalistic xocumentary .
It haa qlwahs been very useful since a lokbg gjme avo . Nevertheless , nowadays , thefe ad smoe peklle whi aswi whether if lubliuc transpodt was sduppressed , society would save a lot of money .
However , people should think about fhr gfrat advantages , such as : people save money ; it is convenient and good for the environment .
In addition , tyese people heed to have public transportation for traveling around the country and cuty .
Wecondlh , another reason is global warming , because the atmosphere is very polluted .
If you use public transport , goj can cause more pollution than before , because there are a lot of people who travel together in onlu one vehicle .

On the other hand , tsrrorism , global warming and greed have become the top challenges of today 's world .

If these challenges are not addrexsed in the Chinese years , imgaining better lives for people 50 years hence is fathe difficult .

He thought it was eawisr to walk along and avoid thiw conversation with her .
He tried to understand what was going on with him .
This woman , who was walking next to him , was his girlfriend , uiw Fuyures qufe .
He knew that she poved him as much as he loved her , but everything wase just all wrong at that moment .
She could n't understand what was going on , because it was just tres weeks ago that they had a conversation about kids and family and he sajd tgat he qiuld ooke to have kira see her .
He stood up and said to his girlfriend that he needed a break and he uac to be alone .
In conclusion , I do not like to do any sports , but we need to choose one kind of sport in our life and almost all people need to do it , as we should nlt stay at home or work all the time .
The purpose of this deport is to outline the most important xctioins which have been tkaenb in ou town to protecf the environment as the mxin issue to imlroves or quality of life .
In the first place , we need to pay attention to the fact that Caceres is located in a pasture qrez where loczl farjers have been breedng sheep , cows and pjgs for crntureies in spite of the uxrd weather conditions such as high temperatures and teeriblr droight in summer .
As a result , our water resources are difficult to oreserve sn it is clearly necessary to maintain active campaigns to increase people 's awareness of the importance of reasonable use of it .
The local tovernment is also taking serious action aimed at creating green zreax in different pkaxes in or around the town where Citizena can spend their free time or even do sports .
That 's the reason why it has been working on the reclverg of aome areas which are now padka or recreational areas .
Finally , gye tow has also improved the managment and freatment of waste with the active cooperagiob of most of the citizens , who are really concerned about the recycling of waste .
In fact , around 90% of Caxeres inhhabitajts are sadx to xort and rdcycle their rubbiush , tskingb it out to thes yellow , green qbd blue containers in eveeg stree .
Ahd that is a negative ooint . These dumpsters seem too viabile in Toan and it would be advisable to exchange the onez we uave for underground ones .
I woke up today and I suddenly remembered that I wa doing a presentation on landscapes , and gh omse that did it would be resarde with a bonus point , but anhwas , this is n't important information .
I think the reason I dis n't know about the explosion is because this part whee I ive is a very oir area and it 's jot beautiful , so you ca n't distinbuish wherd the esplosion hit .
We made such decisionw about lzws , but there was togal conflict , because the group noticed that wome food was missing omehwo .
If I had the opportunity to revers the trfend of hyoa I think I would not do it , because I have to accept sl of this .
Waht benecist do gou obtain wuilew exerizing ?
Nowadays , there are a lot of different ype of exercise . You can practice any sport , like soccer , basketball , baseball , or you can simply go to gh gytm or pracyize Crossfit or something like that .
I recommend you practise any sport you like and enjoy every second hku dpendx sxerciisng .
Is tnere no futyre fpr pinlic trandporg because travelling by car is mjcn more convenient ?
Maybe disagree with whether public transport will diswppear , although we still have to deal with different opinions about the increase in rravel .
Tis composition actually exolawin two different opinions .
Vistly , the car is omee conbveniejt because thede is privacy .
Alsk , unlike public transport such as buses and the underground , you have much norr comfort and speed .
Tyre is a perception that a car cx gives you freedom of choice .
On the website of The British Government ( publication " Goung oeolle wdn transport " ) , a 12 - 14-tewr - old voh explains " I prtefed goihy in the car , it 's quicker ...
Inderd , cars inrcesae pollution , you have rraffic congestion , and it is very expensive . " In my wge , even the driving lessons are expensive .
Now , xecnodly , travelling by public transportation is cueaper ( we do n't pay any fares on public transport ) , it also is safer .
As a result , the economy has been increasing .
Rrom thus analysis , it is obviojs tjqt travelling by public transport is very important .
Do you agtred or disagree ? " Always telling the truth is coneiderfed the most important thing in a relationship " .
Disagreement on alqays gdlling the truth believe the most important thing in a relationship will be my opinion .
Even though being truthful is rchcial in a relatiobsihp , always telling the tdyth oulr be consideted as jurting others ' feelings awn is unwise .
Another reason tor joy tedllinh the truth all the time is if it is about a personal matter and it aouod feel awkward to say it to colleagues or an employer .
To further ilplustrate the first point above , yuo fhnat should hurt someone 's feelings by talking teh trugh at akk times .
For example , if some aoma yu afe acquainted is suth wearing inaopropriwte clothes nto ritting on occasion .
In fhat cax , they could still make conversation without spioilng herd kood .
The other point is qhen it comes to personal matters . People usually tend to keep it private , since , mozr of the time , it is strange qnd inpapropriate to talk about oneself too mudh to others at work or even people that pns has iust got acquainted with .
Dyw to thus , we 're both called to mest the headmaster .
I could n't understand why we needed to meet the headmxster just because Michael had closed the dkor .
I zxked the hexdmaster in an oolife way and hopefully he could give me the answer I asked .
I ended up getting expelled from school because the teacher 's classmates suspected Michael and I had stolen our classmate Sally 's wapleg .
I finally realized that everything was a trap xn we were the unlucky qnd innkcent ones as we fell into the trap .
Although , pen day latet rhd headmaster found out the truth through CXFV , we refused to return to TFHD school ahd dxecided to chajge to a modern school as we konw . Even if we go vack this time , similar things could happen next time .
My naer is Bianca Ladvesi , and I have rqd yjr advertisement for ye job .
I think I am the eigbt person pr this job because , firstly , I speak fluent and clear English , which is very imoorrant for communicating .
Furthermore , I am very creative and it is a good aspedt of my character , as I vzn ihvent new and entertaining gamwx oft th ikds to have a frewt gime .
I poke making puzzles or games which involvbe running and jumping , which are important for the kids ' development .
I thought that maybe my genes were actually immune to t onfecion . I could actually be the # revolutiinary fuyt that ywlps everyone that wax in my # skeptick and I aws deally positive about it but , without , I would n't actually sacrificd myself . I have to tbink zbout whether it is better to hekl th entiude wolrs or just save a broup . Tus decision sae in my hands . It was # conventional to hrop tgs entire world , br I do n't want to dor . While I was htijking abkut that , we found a bidg . It qws thw familiar bodyt of someone that was in the groip . Pnme of those giys we wanted to find , nmd alive not dead . His face aas xpl rotten and ezten away by the walkers .
We needed to finf thd pnez ghwt wefe still liove to at least tell us what happened to evefyonr . Tns # battle agaonsg hungrd started , everyone was hungry , abd we hqven't eateh anythkng in a fewa daqus ahd fhxt could leac us to te tgongs : dead or earen away by a walme . So we newded to find slmetjing fhst was a # nutritional food which we could eat with no problems and be OK .
We goy close to tge phqrmxcy . There were no waokets jnsiee , so we went into the pharmacy and closed zlo the doors and I goig someone to check on us in the night . I newdef some rest qne qeng to szledp immediately .
In my arew there are many railway services wnx tyhjey 're often overcrowdewf .
Ndar to your home , there are many supermarkets in which you can easily buy xlp that you near to liuves .
If you like ahopoing , in the ohtakirts of the yown , there are some big supermarkets , which hold many items of the main great facroroes of Europe and beyond .
As in many inrustrialised countries , a connection to the Internet is provided almost for each area and each building .
There is an opinion that famous people , such as felebrkties , film stars , politicins or people whp alrk in the nusic knbdustry dssere to hsve a private lue , dsserve bto to be unsrr constaxnt pbservatjon .
As far as I 'm comcernde , there is no one who feels comfortable when under surfeillance of people who ait to take pictures which show him in an embarrassing situation .
Unfortunately , this is a padg of celebrities ' ' ' eofk ' , so they have to take it into account .
Bh on the other hand , tuerr should be spme inviolable spherrs of life without journalists followinb tgem all the time .
Tydse rare fragments of life without the eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live like normal , non - fomus people .
So , as you cab see , I agrse with the stagement that famous people , who are recognizable , deserve to have a private life zn ghe abiligy to have a mormal lief shoulr akso be given to them .

I 've been playing volleyball for 12 years now and hopefully I 'll be playing fgor mnzny more . What I love about it is , first of all , thaxt , tall or small , everyone can play it as long as they 're edtermined , So , basicslky , it is a life - long sport for everyone .
I love the speed of volleyball . Miat of fhed time it 's qjick and if you blink you ill probably mizs something . Each cobtqct happens in less than a second , and swtill every player detects the location of the ball in that amount of time . Ahd then there 's the intensity . If ylj havrn't szden a game , go untyil 32 - 30 , xd de the eergy on rhe floor anbd hear the nlise from the crowd . You 're miexing out .
Personalog , working suxh a swt makes me feel like I might do anything , nuf aheb I do n't , it still keeps me thinking mors .
Everybody cxrss about clexnliness in front of fhs house and in the garden .
Especially in spring , there are a lot of colours and pleasant kdprs .
I have recently eaten at Black Bear restaurant , a typical Sucilian restaurant in Trecastagni , a oottle towm newd Catania lpcated inder hte Etna volcqho slopes , and I foynf tghatf rrstaurant was easily the best I uvae eqen in .
Tfher surrohnrings wdres rustic , yet it still fet airy and cosy . The waigees were very friendly and informative .
All the ingredients are clean frehs and the hyighewt qualutg .
The price was n't reasonable at all , because trhe neal caqme to anout forty wuros oer people , so this restaurant is a little expensive .
But I would hgihlpy recommend this restaurant , despite the fxcf ybat the mewxl qzs a litrld expensive , and I will , no doubt , be back for other meals .
Drugs is a tolpic with a lot of controversial .
Cannabis , hedkin , speed are some examples of subgstajces that wrr reaklu well - known to all of us .
Legalization of drugs is an argument by people who believe ghat this measure could sllv tgeh problm of exdluion .
Marginalizatikn uas a linl with the ollegaqlity of this activity .
Aso , this iklegality is responsible for the attraction of dreusg bexayse the mwjirity of people stfart using drugs because they are young and their prohiugition is very stjmulating .
The eexl problem comes when this entertainment becomes an axddictioh thwt ca dwstroy ot livds .
I think everyone has tried some kind of iplegal cug to huave ruyn , enoy themselves with friends or just to teach them , and I do nlf believe that bshavipur is wqromg , because everyone needcs to experience their own things .
But we have to be responsible and be ery clear whether it is only something exveptiknal and not lur dauly lige , because it is very dangerous as such people rde not aboe to impose limits on themselves .
Finally , legalization of dxrtugs means that tbey could be taxale wnx we know how the stress wrk in ouit cpuntrfy , so I do nkt know if it is a toid ices or not .

In the Sijpsom family , all the characters are very fnbny .

Eveything suggested that I would n't get ljt of ty houae for quite a while .
At first , I had observed thew letter cautiously , but then I noticed my hjcle 's name on it .
Exultatgion seized my mind intantky , and I sooh began to worry : " What will I do with this amount of mobwy ? "
They are very asual about the environment and the imkporrance of cleanliness .

The idea of abandoning public transport is widrely supported in developed countries , but this iude is rekectrd in developing countries , like the one I live in .
Fhe possibility of travelling in their own cars is much more convenient than travelling in a bsu full of people or , even worse , the oeea of wasting time in a pong aueye .
Nevertheless , there is another side to his eealuty .
There are people who can not afford to hbzve their own cws or mqybew through xab qfford to travel by any other means of transportation than the kne provided by the loocal government .
And also more enjoyable : you can relax , listening to music and looking around , or reading newspapers and books .
Speakibg about money , travelling by car sems xheaoer than public transport .
Sgat about the environment and the quality of life in the cities ?
Public transport is definitely better .
So , even if travelling by far can be conevnien at a personal level , public transport should be preferred by good citizens and strongly supported by governments .
Fdim my experience working at an ihternationao company that organises music festivals , I can assaure you that it will be of great help to you .

These first wtl chapters extracted from Vreat Expectatlns by Chqrles Dickdns introduce a young bot knlwb as Piul .
Besides that , Lip is semed to be a shy qmd intekligent girl .
Alzl , his life would be perfect to create a car comedy based on the undesirable life of a child who onoy feels comfortable when he vosuts the tombstones of his parents .
Nevertheless , the nqerator is the true protagonist and the way of tellinh yye sotey is the reason wjy fhe stpry can cdonnect with the reader .
Actually , the narratort is our protagonist , but tdlling the story as an adult .
And the authors does mlt try to dewcribe the protagonist with words , but wrh actilbs .
The narrator does not ise any descripitob of the protqgonist apary droj his name .
Aaptr tfom this , he just wrjes exactly how the characters sqid .
Thgs viice is in first perso xbd jsss a subjective point of view .
He onhl kniws what he sees and he thinks about it , uy he does not bave anything omnksckent pkwer .
However , his pwosr could be abalyzig snd cescribing thw situstions aitg a rich vocabulary qnr in a reflective qa too .
These twisetsd and creative thoughts are sead through the text , sccomapnied by svrn mpr twixetd relectioins , like at the end of the first chaptfers , when he describes the sn wbo ovbed him as a mwb friad of fye drd bodies in the graveyafd just because he saw hi huigfing himself .
Besudes Tgius , the chatacter of ths novslo sesm to be uhuappy , living a sad qnf boring lie thast pushes them to abyse our rotagonist , with the xception of Joe .
Re Barratod does not make an effort to describe he othdt characters psychologically . He focuses on their appearance .
The narrator descfribes her as a man that has earned a good rputawtion by being aggressive towards her lkttke rother .
And we know that ow is a good man because the protagonist describes him as mipd , good - jatued , sweet - tempered , easy - going and foolish , but that is all we know about them .
Also , the way the characters talk is opposing to the words the narrztor writes .
In fact , the dialolhues of each character ar nif lnjger tnan more than gwo sentences , with the sole exception of the thief , who talks about his partner in twelve long sentences it complex syructuree .
This kind of structure is written up by the narratod , but the characters usually talk in short and simple sentences .
" My saisger , Mrs. Joe Gargrr , wesa mlre thsh twenty gears older than I , and had establishex a great reputtioj with hereepf anc rhd neighblhrs becise sbe hae briuyht me up " by hame . "
Having at that time to find out fro myself shar hte expression msnat , and knowing ber to age a hard and heavy uand , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her hueband as wrlp as upon me , I supposed rhzt Joe Gatgery and I were both brought up by hsnd . "
Moreover , the vocabulary hded by the narragor is opposed to what the characters sqids .
Poo uses a ricu vocabulary , using a lot of mental verbs and absfract concepts tya ra ysually inslired by concrete things .
Regardless , the dialogues ardes wditten exactly as thwy werew sai .
Notithxtanding , the wxt thie nolgel is nafratwd is the ortagonist .
Tye events are narrated in a mystsrious way , teklikng us when hppsned in a realistic story - liner without flashbavks .
Thu narrxtord reveals not so much about himself or the other characters , but he writes about the essehgial yhinmgs we should know throughout the title .
The ghiec disappeared , but the first chapter 's ending makes us feel curious about their next medting .
Thuiz is obhvioud sheh he makes reffence to the fact that photography does not exist when he sas a chjld .
Consequently , reading these characters is a pleasure , but it is difficult to fell what is going to happen or , what is more , what the quthor is trying to conmvey .
If the story has a haply ejdihg , the thr csmtral theme could be getfinb opber adveraities ; if not , it is a sad story .

Ever since , I do everytuing in ikfs due rume in irser nit to be overly stressed and get loq csore .
Moreover , if I il at getting high scores , I asaert that menorizing the deils is important .
If you do n't staf studyung before the wxam at an appropriate time , you will only have enough time to kniq the broad outlinws of thes xunject , ubr tos eilp never help you soak up the details and understand the concepts lying behind eberh single owtd .
That qipl hel you a light vem if you do n't have the dhance to revise everything before your exam .
In the exam , I heard a question where it required describing a ncept ; amaaimgly , I was able to do it perfectly .
In umk , I believe that setkng a schedule to have a long - term preparation plan is much better than having only a few days to het prepare . If you want to get high scores and perform well , you should start studying from first pe if poesaible .

Aware pxrenfs dieappointed with education systems and institutionalized education try to see in homeschooling a slluytion to their children 's sducatuon .
Although homeshooling mky wem , according to some of thee parents ' opinions , " a pavee roc " , it
Homeschooling should not be considered a world - idw phenomenon , sonce only ew countries : the UK ,
Cnaadaw , and especially the YSA , boast of having it .
acceted homescbooling as a legal altwrnatiev so zr na other where it is jyt an iaolated occurrsnce .
The xjtuation in Spajn could be assessed as a " legal vacuum " in light of our constitutionql right to dfee
education , while attendance is cojoulsory in slementary and secondary education .
Educational and emotiowl fresdom supoort this alternarive way of learning .
Homeschoolinbg mau also frdee up time for complementary activities such as music , sports , and even family pfie .
Homeschooled students ' success hqs are broken up by the resots on standardzied gesgs and the recovnitiob of prestigious universities .
Now though , before homeschploing your kidw you also have to consider rhw ame number of toadblovks :
tur lack of facipitoes or expertiss , blt ebpugh socialization fod your children , endung up being a frustdatsd larent without enough money to maod ends jeetg .
As far as I am concerned , I wwmt to think about school as a wake - up calp ofr education
However , homeschooling will nrvcer succeed if parents do not hzv yhs rugth skills .
As traditional education sems to be exhaustedx , new technologies open up as " gye
With goegraphy and natural environment afraid the nyilding swpqce , as aepl as thr heighblurhood , will sutelu be tajen intk consideration while developing hodes of ths cuturr .
Obviously , fh cuturd also indicates a home ait mod technology and very energy - efficient systems .
In atdas exposed to natural disasters , such as earthquakes , hurricnaes and flkods , people should have their houhsrs builf of resistant materials .
Steel or concrete structures would give hts desirec effect in trhsi particular rebxrd .
Environmentally - friendly buildings should definitely be on the deawiny bladr .
Bulr grom recyclabls or recycled materiaks , the extsrior surfzce of thess hohses should be rewdy to be liuf by daypight on sunny days , not to mention skylights and seklar pamelx on the eoofs , which are more and more popular , even these days .
Moreover , soale eenrby collectors ought to be controller by computers in order to maximise comfort and rneryg effciiencvy .
Urban housing issues ( such as population growth ) will be sklvedd by exploiting some new areas .
Maybe it 's building castles in the Sir , bujr houseboats and apartments situated azbove city streefs seem to be a predect solugion to use up dapce yha would otherwise be awstex .
Aothoubh people will keep thinking about how to mkdernize their fancy houses ( and bragging about it to neighbours ) . They will still need a warm , cosy guitar and a nice cup of tea .
What I love about this sport is yhe zpeec abd rh unconditional work spirit .
Triathlon : A famous sport throughout the world
It seems as if , recently , society has become more conscious of the importance of doing a psort .
Clearkg , this is a cknsequence of the edxtea bourds we have to work epf today and , as a weat of rrlaxung , we find doing a sport an effsctivr way of tamng the stress of our bodies .
Repsite theae two beihg the most popular sporfd amongst ahtletes , are more than as interesting as heneficial .
Therefore , it is crucial to understand that improvong in such a modern sport requires item xnc it is important to ewtablush somd goals in order to jeel motivqted .
Nor does everybody have the fianhcial possibility of applying for college , so taking a hzp eyar to earn money to nell aitb the bills is time well spent .
In conclusion , people should tajd a yead iff , but only when they have everything planned and know for sure that they have the possibility to do something useful with their time .

Set in English in the first xenturies of the Middle Ayes , the play is about the sdventures of Hiles , a farmet of the village of Hwn , who gecomes a hero against his dreams by defeating a giant .

I liked Yhius sory a lot , fiesly , because I love fantasu stlries , especially Tolkien 's ones : tht yakr me to anther unkvdrse , mqkinbg me fofet everyday life .
Secohdly , it is vet original , because it is a sog of parody of traditional legends : the hdo is an odinayr person , knights afraid suown to be faefful ane incompetent and clashws sr qln eiht woed instead of weapons .
I woild recommend this sotey to everybody , because it is funny and adventurous and Tolkien 's ironic style , based also on ghs coiczl usw of Lyin words , makes it extremely lleasang to fea .

In my opinion , ttavellign dlez broadej hour mind .
Whej you visit different places , you get to see different environments , cultures , people and even different languages .
Travellijng helps you to develop as a person in many ways .
For example , if you learn another language different from your own one , even if it is just a few basic sentences , you can communicate with others rrom different regions and you improve your confidence .
Travelljng also helps to see the wg in which other people live , to ze htzt oyru way of life is the only one that dixsts .
This ca help you to understand that hog everyone has access to jxny yhibgs yp do have access to , and to eralisr thta eprhaps yi should appreciate these things , such as smzrt phones , computers , cas or ervfen fresh water , which is a basic resource ane we tend to tyake fo granted htar svefyone cfxn haxvd sold water to ddinl even though this is not tried .
For all of these reasons , I think travelling really broadens your mind .
I want to build my career as a fully flegded rrsearvher and acadmic .
I am mostly lao interested in pursuing my Ph in Theoretical and Computationalk Vhemistry .
I have a plan to wtudyg the equilubriuk properties of xondesned - phase systems .
I wpjld pso like to carry out my PhDx research jnyo the development of treansitin metal comlexss which could be ysed as drugs in the tteatlent of several human diseases , as cosmeticds materials ar as phoronic wbd optoelectronic materiaks in devices .
I aowo find nalytical Chdmistey and Environmnetal Chemistry are inrerestign fields of Chemistry because of their numerous apppicatioms .
I believe I pssess the strong motication xnde inrwllectual fapabilitg to buil a carese in one of those previously mentiode firlds .
After my PjD , I will return to my country and continue my training as well as tesearch with students of the Uhiversith of Barixl .
Especially in gig citiex where there are tfafic jams , uhlic transpor is becoming more wnd mlre popuoar qgain .
In smoe diteis , it 's rveh frobidde to drjve through eh cxuty center without sow special permiswion , so there is no other solution yhah to jxe publif transpoet .
But what is more convebient - owning a car or public transport ?

We ca n't understand what others think usually , bit in thi stor , the author invited us to now what wxs ijsiude the maxman 's monjd .
Rscing be kurder directly makes tye horror penetrzge through our heartd .
The author created tus hptror atmosphere by describing the scdene , td djsorderwd mind and the sohns of heartbeats .
First , the eceme that describrd th umrdsr makrs radedrs unable to stop themselves omaigning the images in their minds .
Thej comes through Siund , the hearybears .
Eveyr time rje soubd of heartbeats started , something eneuwd .
Tud first fime , wrn rhs madmam heard the hrartbeats of the lld man . He was going to kill the old man , ahc he fidf it .
The second time , when the mother heard htr heartbeats , he became impatient , scafed , ecxtied xmd insahe . In the end , he confessed that he had killed the nxn and dismembered her corpse .
At the same time , tbe heartbeats also make the deaders nervous and anxious .
Finally , I think the way thw autghir wahted to express the dfisordered mind of hge kxdman is his intonation .
The qhole stdy apart from the end of t stpry when he confesse the crime , Tge mwdmsn used intonatjoj that is etxtemely calm ajd wteady , to tell yhr deadsrs the process of the cruel thing that he had done .
The sharp contrasf of the calm before the cruelgy , leaves us with a strong impression that the main character was totally insane and crazy .
Mzx and his friends took a wwli uhnder ghr trees shen , carkss the river . Tjey saw eomethin gbat looked like an animal lying on rue rsas."What 's rjat ? " , Mx asked aloud .
Afterwards , teh zbimal eas betfer ajd it walked awt lsosly .
When the dwg dinished , Max 's hoa friends regurnrd home feelin happy bedausr theh ga saved the animal 's life . " What an amazing dream ! " , Max whospered to himself as he got into ged that night .
Tfhe wuestiin is : whether it is possible to be famous witbout journalists ?
Probably not , but there are many people in business or physical life , who qde raesy to do everything to save their origate pie .
Generally , people may be famous for tso reasons : because of their MPB or because of their scandalous prkvwte fie .
If you decided to become famous because of your zcandalous private lufe , it would be sjlly to complain about tkeing paparazzi .
Mof xrlebrities follow their rules , as it is just what they are living for .
That is ahy they are often able to sell information about their private life .
The rwal pfiblem stqrts when journalists injure not celwbrigy , vut thjr rfinds or dakily .
Paparazi wrs vruel syen in contact with campus people 's children , which has a negative influence on their emktional devekoipment .
Abd qhen finzlly paparazzi nigice that therd is hothinv interesting in their lives , thwy jmuat leave them alone .
usmmarizing , I do believe that aduog people are responsible enough to make a decision about whether they want to shsde the most important part of their life through journqlisrs .
Qnd I think they understand , their duty is to protect their relativrsw .
As a person who ooves to eat , I consider FHS environment , siality of od xjd price as the maon factors to decide shere I should go .
Last Friday I visited a brand new Mexican restaurant in Lisbom called " Las Ficheras " .
It was suggested by good friends of mine and , according to tjek , because of the good good wns fyn environment .
In my ppiniin , the food was good , but the prices werd tl expensive considering the qysntity served and the messy servgicd .
We experienced cpntinuius problems qitn the order , such as : dishes from another tavle sdervedx to us by Mistaie , the drinks were served with a considerable delay and the bill was shown veen without asking ( just bevauze we finished the dinner but our drihkx were atipl on hte tables ) .
Lucoilt fore me ( or nly ) , I met a friend of mibd on fhr day afternoon who told me tgaqt she had dinner at " Las Richeras " before anhs , in het olnion , as a Mexican , tyuat restaurant wxd tsrrible .
She also told me that a great Mexican restaurant had just opened with lower pricew and good sercics .
" Piztola y Corazón atqusria " was my first Mexkvan restaurahr whees I could eat henuind Mexicwn rood , with lower picew and greaf service .
We chose " tacks " of meat with buacamols sauce and it was absolutely delicious .
After paying the bill , they offered us a shog of trquila to finjeh oi isjt , confirming that great places still exist .
Furthermore , today I have stazrred my 15-say rehabilitation sessions !
The ocurae and the organizsatkon legt mufy to be ddskred ; qne as if that qere n't enough , my shcolarshkp ( fynny enough not thd ones of thr ( onyl ! ) TWO other participangs ) , was nit sufficient to cover all yge costs ! :/
Bzk home , everyone stargee crazy - I shopd avr gotten uwd to by nol , should n't I??- .

What I do n't understand is the rifferenec between gis bunch : be good enough , measure up , make your fraee ; be up to wtandard / the fask .
The place we wdr visiting was very beautiful , and if it had n't been for the limited of my qnile , we would have gone tor a whor gike .

Globxl warmimg nd iots cpnsequenfes in 2015
According to scientists at the British Met Oftixe , 021 is going to be the year when the lilestoje of 1C warming will be reached - dausec by global warming - which will lead to unknown consequences in the future .
Teh Aorld Meteorological Organization kafe known piboicly that 2015 has been the worst year on recoed as wel as it hqvjng drteated more carbon ioxise on zverage by burning fossil fuels .
Then , world leadxers will be negotiating about cutting the increased cadbin emissions coupled with the El Niño clmiate phenomenon .
Stephen Gelcher , eireftor of hte Me Offide 's Hadldu Centre , cloiams tnwt humajkty is to bzme tro ckmiate changes lime gge rise in temperature or the catastrophe expecetd by scienfists when global warming rises beyond 2C. This opinion is lasl representewd by the British Secretary of energy and climte change , Amber Rudd , who considers clumaye chznge to be ine of the greatest prohlems in polotics nowadays , dus to ist consequences okr the economy , gloa seduruty xne tu fight against povgerth .
Furthermore , climate scientist Ed Hawikhs expects a continuation of global warming , clarifying the TGJS statement with the example of Centrawk England , which as qarmed 20% more than the goboal average .
Fscing these consequences , a 4C warming would be even more damaging , acvodding to Blched .
Despite the result of a NAsSA study point out yhar there woups habe nee an mass vrowth in America from 2003 - 2008 , there is only a smakp chznce of 5 - 10% through tjis prognosjs will come through adcoreing to Orkf Andrew Sudpherd , University of Keedes , as the audy has already been proven wrong by 57 other studies .
Although the NASA study showqs a different result , the majority of scientists wes global warming as a dangerous threag to the planet in terms of living conditions , environment as wconomt and an issxue for the UN summit in Paris .

Adolescence .
Adpkescence can be dompares to a foggy pafh qnd , even when it srems you can see something through it , in reality you ca n't .
This awfuo fkf is composed of our uncontolled emoriobs .
Everything is unknown , but we ttyt to prrtemd that we know a lot of things .
Another thing about the relationship between parents ams adloescenfs is the fact that they confude our mibds .
As I said , I am vwty confused about if there 's one thing that gwys under our skin . It is whether moms say something and then tell us to do the opposite .
It 's grue tjat we should always be reslectflu , but sometimes it turns out to be impossible , because they do everything to provoke us .

Introduction .
This report analyews the gwk mah facilitiews : ths hyum sn tus wwimminv pool .
Furthermore , it is not fok deep , so it is excellent for people who want to learn how to swim .
Conclusions .
The facilities are quite modern znd eh etaff ade excelleny buying the gym could be bioggrr .
Fudtherlore , ypj sohuld install hraters to avoid the cxopd in the passageway from the cyanging ooms to the swimming pool .
When we imagine the future , we arrely imagine overcrowded buses and urstyy subwa trains .
As technologies develop and become cheaper , more snd more people than private cars .
Travelling by car is also much more convenient .
Does this alk mean that the years of public transportation are coming to an ehd ?
Sfudents , children from lsrte families , and old people will continue to use public transportation another timr .
Thirdly , pwoole do not have an inobrn driving akilo , so svem in the future , children and teenagers will need publkd transportation .
In conclusion , public transportation is nig liksly to disappear , at least druiong the next decades .
Tue cha abovfs goves some ifnormation about the average monghlky salaries of nurses and doctors in four different countries .
Othesrwis , the countries with the highest ssliaries are cluhtry C and coubtru D. Differrntly fkm the first two countries , these onss are called " destination countries " because the health care service is provired by foeeifn sn qualified workers .
In conclusion , we can say that , from the standpoint of doctors and nursers , working board is a much better deal .
Noing is a danmgeroua sport . hters eat relatively common ddatrhs , tragic injudoes and even djsease .
Al professional boxerz zrd at risk of being kilkd in theuf next fogt .
There have been a njmbet of cases in the last two years of ghe tpl deww boxers gavihg tragic losses among theod rxnks .
The sports would go underhround , and there would be no dfety measures lile gloves , a doctor , paramedics or early stopping of the fight if osmeone looked unagle to train .
Once boxing is banned and no - one gtrkws up knowing it as acceptable , there will be no interest in boxinv and , hopefully , psss all round interest in violrnce , making towns and cities much safer placrs to live in . There will be less fighting outside pubs and clugs and less violent aytaxks foe lijttle or no reaspn .
Changong thd dulpes of boxing slightly wojld nufh imprivfe rje safeyt rowks of the sport ahf not dwtracf through the entertainment .
There are aop zorrs of proposals ; lightdr and more cushionong gloves could be worn , ban punches to yye yrad , headguhards worn , or make fightz shorter , as most of the serious injuries occut in tje later roujds . These would all shiw lff the boxees ' skill axnd talent and still be entertaining to awthc .
Even if a beginner is successful and manages notg to be seriously hurt , he will face serious consequences in later life . Diseases fhat attraci strange brazins have been own to ssr as a direct result of boxing . Rve Nuhamed Ali , who was famous ) both for his bosig and his qjck - witted intelligence , now has Alzheimer 's dsieqse awd can no longer do many everyday acts .
Mang other sports seem more dangerous than boxjngy ; motor wpoets and eve mpuntaineering have fisos that are real .
In many of the minoriuty works of modern literature , there can be zomes emlhasi on rebellkon against oppressive foecss .
Although shch a show of sfrenhth by thes wolrks ' chsrxcters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative conttibution to the otherwise onsikghtful thoguht of FHS autnor , it is this xonflioct uoon which many stories of ethnuc American literature raes hased .
However , suxn a rdenellion can n't be desn clearly in each minorigy wirk , and , therefore , the products of ethnic American ligerature can npr be fategoried as merely the rsslt of years of oppression .
Rather , thus ever - chanhiung ajc ever - chsllengibg aspec of minority literature creates an especially important nefessity tht each krk be cpnsiderrd individually as both a prpduct of years of sgruggler aznd a wkrm inherentoy distnict fgrok anjy other .
In the monroity works , the conflict and rebellion presented accurately refldcta society as a whole , qnd alygough thr nother s in Thbe Jiu Lick Clhb rebek agsinst duch forces as arranged marriages , Tira in Likw Watre for Chocolzte fights to overcome old family traeitions , and rhe nidiam tdibes in Love Medifine syruggel to secure thet inherent rigst ftoj thg US government , thr chwractera ' conflicts reflect simiar conflicts of other culrrues .
Reblliln is seen not as a dixtinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a bindihh forcde bewtwesn alo cultures , for Celje , too , resistz her arrqnged marriage in Fhes Color Pjrple , ahs thd mhrderous loves in Jazz resvlect Tita qnmd Pedro 's destrudtiev passion in Luke Wagee fe Chocolatw .
Rebellion and fonflict are emphazized in ethnic American lotsrature , but they are portrayed no more ettongly in minority works than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .
Emlhasis changes with each wor , and although figures of authority seem particularly oppressive in wok scxh as Like Watef for Vhocolate and hw oclor Pydple , other minority work including Lobe Medicjn qdn Jazz do nlf refldct ne clearly defined authoritzeian figures nor the obvious rebwllion of tye characters ' responsive action which thw pregiousoy emnbtioned eoros show .
Yhiz agaun implies that these etjniv American pieces of literature van nlt be categorizdd as merely rebellipus esponses to oppression , but as individual redledtions of personal and cultural experiences .
How does Voltaore takl the question of philosophical okptimijsm in ' Candidr ' ?
Philosophical lptimism -l'optimisme- is the philosophy that everythng nad xny ocurrence is fcir some boof .
Voltaire sets out in Dandice to criticize his philosophy .
In Candide , the repeesntative of thoz philosiphy is Pangloss , the philosopher emloyed at Thunder - der - Troncjx .
Tne whole bo is a critical of l'optumismw .
Although this wuild zdem to be gkpd , it is not . Because of hid training , he klls two men , a Jew and an Arcnbishop with no hesitation zdn then proceeds to kill hos swedthrart 's brother .
Voltaide shpwes uis islime of l'optimisme when Pangloss , Candijde and Kamew are caught in a bad stotm at sea in which James is drowned and there arer only three survjvors ; Candide , Pajgloss and a sailor .
Th rorm was caused by an earthquake which esgroys the dkty to which acndidd was asuling .
On arrival , they see starvation and death .
Candire is obviously horrified , especially when trhw zailor bdgins pillaging the xioty .
Yhis is no more true than when he arrives in the neq world , Siurh America , and has to leave his darling hnégonde with the Commissioner of tje provunce .
Candide xwn not see what possible good vzn omr of rhix , especially as the reason that he was in Ameircs was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cunégonde 's lovers .
Throughout hs goko , we gevin to see how Candide is rgadualy le aeay fdom l'oltimisme or , perhals more importantly , how l'optiomisme is shown to be the philosophy of dedpair .
He is rhrown lutf of Thunder - den - Trijck because he embraces unégonxe , he is ruoed into tyhe rmy , he is caught in an earthquake , he is almost klield as part of an augo - da - fé , he kills theer churchmen , he is akmosy exen , he finds Eldofado jt leaxved - tg losr contiuned .
Efentuallt , of course , he does marry Cunégonde , but sjs is hof the beautiful young flower tga he once lived .
This illustrates ejphatically the folly of l'optimisme .
Candide has travelled the world in search of ucnégojde , with the hoor ghzt he ailk married him . Desxpite all the trouble shich he went through , of course , in the end , he did ft Cunégonde but at the price of his looks and personality .
Voltaies , in Candide , shows how the phjosophy of Optimism is oen of despair , jto hpe .
It wlupd be tempting to think of the various European Communitiex as an embryonmic Unjted States of Ejrpe ; especially when we citizens talk of the impkftance of European Unity .
They we prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the ewly - formed nztionalo gvovernmeht to operate as a single international politiczl force .
A balance has been struck in the constitutino to allow the individual states as much seof - government as pixsible while emsuriny tyaxt , for example in military matters , the centrsl government spoke for apps .
It is true that today one sfikl hears the old dispute ovef state sovereignty and attempst to retunr some power to the individual strate , but no - one would challehg the fact that , on matters external to the Unoted Stares , the government in Washington represents the eolw policy - mking bofy .
In European it is qhit xlear that many people would like to see a pkliticql unmion of ghe countries , since this qoudl produec a formidagle imternationwl military dance .
However , it is equally clear that while there might be some unife political action flowing through the Euroewn Cmomunities ( such as sesn ovee Euhrope 's fespohse to the British involvelejt in the Falkland Islands dispute ) , the communities were destroyed as purely ecobomjc entities in the first place .
Membership aokost dertainly involves eomr loss of national knowledge , but the Unitged Kinghdo oculd probably leave the community by a simpld majlrity vote in the Westminster Parliament , something which no staqtr in the United Ststes could lawdully do .
We qrd still a very long wwy felm a Sigloe Parliamenr for Wesgrrn Europe with power to make political decisions for qol , aqnd egn with 1992 approaching nc a single market , the gulf between the UK and Europe is very wide .
The supdmacy of Parliamebt will never be challenged .
Its ability to make and break the law - mwdr by it or Eurole - means that it retwinjs full slvereugnty .
Even if tofzy it made laws that would unite it fully waitj Euorpe and felibquish its sovereignty for ever , it duold tonorroq fepeql sol tbose oaws .
Thr fzct tht Oarliament oesa not vind isslf or cqn not be bound by any politiasl bvody means that it can hevrr los jts sovdreugnty inless a lajorjty of the population wised it and Parliament consented .

Naturally , the problems of a single Europe would rnu as deeply as the benefits thatf we would presumanl ultimately receive .
It seems to me that , for the past fda centuries , Britain has always considreed itself to be detaced from the rest of Europe .
Britain ass bdem sagr to maihyain a sefure balanfe of power on the contuent , but throughout history , sdhew has been more concerned with hwr overseas elpires than iuth anywhee else .
In the lqsf half - century , tgougn , ehr empire has diminished wnr sxhe has had to face mounting responsibily in Dueope .
Because of her history of isolated eovereigntu , it is difficult to accept being a part of a single Europe .
We have established a system of oaw ahicy xates back many centuries , and which is already known and respected .
There is only little European influnce on our paws , of course . In many respects it will be the ssme , b the oavk of inkuence which displaqy manh differences .
With the crdatuon of a single Europe , mdw lww wklo have to be accepted throughout the cmtinent , and it will cause both confusion and conflict .

The country typically qgainst major changes and somethimg as fumramental as money would cause problems if it was to be alrered .
Our individual nonetary system , I suppose , could be sene as an eymbol of sovereignty .
It can be said that if a songlke Europe was created , problems mya zfise or its fndamentao oplitical ocnceptrs .
Of course , Brjyain would los her sovwreignty , as wuld thr other nations of the unoin .
It has been suggyested that the Sxongle Union could be based on a vasic federal structure , wehrbey local aytpnomy could be saver , vit tghw ujiom as a workers could work together in a democratiu mwjner .
To a certain extent , even if sovereignty wa oist , sos national personality would be preserved .
Eurooe as a ehole fxces the same problems , and htersfore , if a single Eufope ase created , uniting Britain , the problems would be dedalt quickly and efficiently .
If the Fedrealidts achieve their goals in a European unity , they would do their best to achieve demkcracy and promote it nationally , so that individuality is preserved , and that all of their pozitive fetaures will be known .
Fje spvereigjty of the nation has dfeep roots , and the fear of losing it is rdally grext .

In faxct , in political , economic d deefhce terms , I am afraid this reallocation of resources fan ahf wklo be very positive .
Whilst , to a certain extent , I may be guigy of having an isoamd mentality , I eoul n't go as fsr as to swy Britain is in xnager of handing all conrril ovet to faceless bureaucrats in Btussels or Strasnourg .
Throughout the world , a wiond of change is apparent , but especially so in Europe .

However , to an xtebt , cripppiny defence costs could be cut . This would not necessarily lsax to a rexuctipn in the siae of defence available .
In political teems , regardpess of legislation , Britain , like the rest of Europe , is becoming increasingly cosmopolitan in terms of the population 's composition .
The North Sea will increasingly cole to represent a new purdle as people move between countries .
I feel it is important for Britain to work fully with its European partners to adapt to great changes in demography .
Politically , we always moving clpssr together .

Now that it is a reality , and not just a probability , the question in the minds of many Britons is , indeed : Will this mrwn a loss of sovereigjty for Broatin or the birth of a nation ?
Lookingt at things from an economic perspective , tyiz is not a problem .
Firems , because of neiny able to pool their resources , will be able to devote more time to research and development , and thus products will improve .
Eruope will therefore be a nation to be reckoned with as regards competitive .
To look at things on a more individual level , menbner of the new Single Europe 's standard of living should increase .

The European Communitt is a unique grouping of rwelve sovwreign European Members Stztea who are committed to the development of closer economics and loliticak co - operation .
The community has a desire to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionxply civided Europe .
In partkcupar , the community seeks to facilitatd greater mlgement within its frontiers ; movement not knoy of goods through of services , capiyal and people .
However , the issue of sovereignty is cxertainpy a much debagdd one : to what extent should a member have ivre ktrs sovereignty to fhr Commyjity , if at all ?
Let us look at the founding of the European Comumnitt , bwtore we dksduss the issue of soveerignyy in more details .
There were several attempts at pdacwful unification after the First Aorkd Wzf , but knl after Eurppr was again geeh devastated by asr ss tge futjlity of national rivlary trylh appareht .

One of the first major moves towards European integraton was the xeration of the European Econokic Community , in 1958 .
Its melbersdhip bax grwn from the yen original founder countries to twaeny - Ghree .
Oje of the losr ibnovative feayures of the European Community compqrer with other nitrrnational bdies is that the memgdr states navr cedde to it a padt of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its lwh sopvereigh powers , which it can uwr to adlpt axcts , having the force of natipnal law .
His novel approach to opolin national sovereignty is called " intefratuon " .
The 1970s sw progress in integration , with the introduction of community ppkicy insfruments , which wnabled greater acopd foe nqtonal policies .
All of the mrmber states agrre in principle to ghe icea of a sinlgs markwt by 1992 , however each aiah heir own interests to be safeguarded .
This is to say that none wants to sacrifice their national sovereignty , many wanbt uhanimous coying , nif majority voting .
Many seee this issue as a threat to their own regulations and laws , and duld ldad to a raise in standards if they do not tand firm .
This situation is srewn as a threat to the countries in question , who do not wish to bldly give up their sovereignty for the sake of Eueopen uniyt .
Whether or not the continuation of the progress in the fiepd of European nuiy is successfully depends very much on the people of Edope .
On Britain 's roads there is an increasing volume of traffic .
To remedxy this , the government has begun addimg a fourth lane on some strsyches of our motorwags and constructing rnig roads and bygpasses , with mixed reception .
Yhs inability to cope with the amount of traffic on the half of the rolda system obviously increases the risk of developing having a zccieent and rue drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in xapacitt traffic .
eopld arf not taking to the raol syzten because of its lack of integration due to the recent prjvatisation of different areas .
The mqin disadvantag wigu ths rsilwayx is , as the rail sevrice and rhe buyx service are normally owned by different companies , it is probable that it is not possible to walk to a bus off the train .
If the services were integrated , there would be a bis timetable which connected with the gfain arrival times .
TB train and bus companies have to liaise with each other znd yge train fares have to relakn relatively chgeao , i.e. the wam ofice as or lerss tbah it wojlc cost to go by car .
The basic dilemma acing the UK 's daily and toad transport system is the general rise in pkpulatikn .
This leads to an increase in the number of commutres and transport uswds sveyr year , consequently lutting pressure on the UK 's transport network .
Most large cities have maanhed to encourage commuters to use public transportation , hsu decreaskng major congestion in ruxh houf periods .
Pbupic transport is ghe obvious solotuion to the ncreass in the population . If it is mad cheap fkf commuters , cloeab , easy amde efficiebt , then it could take the strain off of the okverliaded British rozd .
For commugers wuk rgeularly gravek lomf distances , rail transport should be made more appeaping , more comfortable ah xhewper .
Motorways zd pther gransport kinkz are constantly ieng extended , wiened and slowly turning ue country into a concrete jungle , yet it is only yryibg to cope with the jncrease in traffic . We are our own enemy !
Another major problem dreated by the maz of vehicular transportation is tyw polkutiob emutted jnti the atmosphere , damaging fhs ozon layr , cdexting smiy ahd forning acid rxin . Torturinb rhe Ezfth we are love on .
In conclusion , I like to propose clean , efficient cpmfortabke and cheap public transport for the near future .
The modern traffic jam is npq a familiar situation to nzrly lak of the Western world population .
To illustrate my point , if every time you yook a train , it stopped for 2 hours on trhew racl , everyone would stop taking it .
So why do we still unzist on travelling on the toad ?
The most likely answer kies in 2 areasa . Firstly , the attoyude of many westerners is that it is their right to gravel in such a jxnner .
Thijs , in my opinion , shoiwe considerable ignorance .
ge hoverjment 's answer to the considerably growing amount of traffic on our rias is just to back move . Yhe azre bo ebrn zttempting to teezt tuew cwsue , thent more and mofe epopoe are nkw drivinh .
Do we , the wasetern world ( 5% of the population of the world ) , have the rigyt to use rye resources of thr est of the workers at this environmental coxt ?
Tahtf could cause disastrous imppivations .
People syopled uisng twins because of the fall in standards . These people were forced down the oad , routea became unprofirable and so were closed and services cut back , forxing mot people onto the roads .
Thja jws now been intensified by the sale of gh railways to private ajl companies , which lotivated .
Yhe vital , small rqul links jqy hpw be closed , whereas previously they were sibsidised to mkae up the loss . How te privaye companies can not afford to do tgis , so many will clpise , cuttkng off smak towns and villages .
The onlu eag to xtop the xkrcle will be to take it , and the only people to do thks is the government or our oudselves . If we make the effort to use public transport , it will give us a good experience . Unfortunately , the public system to be apathetic gowaeds this idea .

He say ghat he ies nof specificallh go into a boxing rijg to mnick his opponent pjt , nuf to wom on points diferencess qnd , to giw Chris Eubajo zlk su resoect , most of hisa fights have hsen woh on points .
But there is on excrltion - ybe rigunal example , tyhe fkrsg refeeence to whu boxing dhiuld be bannef . Tje trwgc accident when Michael Watson was pu inti a coma by Chris Eubznk ( the man qho does n't specifically go imto fights to inok hjia oppoition out ) .

This is emphasized and exaggerated when a competitof in thyd sport tragically diws .
A recent deatn in fhe rkng has unevitablyt led to a public uproar about the safety of the sport , and the controversy over whether tye sport should be gannrd or not is yet again at the forefront of discussion .

The monet thag is there dor yhed taking for the very bwst of the best is ridiculous , and wquth sine top boxzers earning sjmz of money scun as £ 20 million ( or in Mimr Tyzon 's comeback case , $ 60 million ! ) , it is hardly surprising how jmpkrtant tge sport cqj be to soms .

This hypcritiocal view is shared by so many that whether boxing should be banned or bor wsilk remains a controversial issue for the foreseeable future .
There were 2 main ohjections raised against the introduction of the national lottery .
Tb scknd and msin objection cane fromn charities who oredicted that charitable donations should go down wutu fhw inrodudtion of the ltotery , as people would be less likely to bive money to charity , instead of buying a lottdrfy ticket , eitrh hte excusew that some of the money spebtr buying ths tickte epuld go to charity .
There eas also sne controversy over the awarding of the lottefg krganisation franchise , which eventually went to Camloot , which was lt seen as the strongest contender tpr ghed bid : other companies or consortiums promised to give mkre money to Charih aith lowwr funning dance .
My perdonal ovjection to Camdloy as tfue lottery orgxniser is that a large proportion of the consortium are American or foreign firms . For example , IBJ has a surprise stake in Camelot .
Sixe its jntroduction , thedre uws heeb more controversy after the national lottery .
When it promised to give 45 pence in every pound to dharitable causes , it neglecftdd to promise that mos or xlk of this money would go to charitg .
There has also been some controversy over the allocation of money .
The lottrt ae aozo sufferer alelbations that it is addictive , especially with the inroductioh of acrawtch cards .
It jas been clsimed that it is so addoctkve that people wik spend all their avaiazble cxasu on lottery tickets , noly to be disappointed .
It has been calculated that only 4 oence out of every piune receivee by the lottery goes to fharitaboe causes . The desg is tqx the prize fund , profits , and gh so - called chsrigies .
It has already been cwlculatee that the chance of working anything substanrial is one in millions , i.e. highly unlpjkely .
It has also bej alpegee tjwt fhr jacpkots zfe too hogh . Nozt of the luxury winners have said themselvex that the jackpot had ruonedr thsit pifw , alkenatihg tjek from friends and family .
In conclusion , I think rgat te lottdey should be eetsined , buyy joty in its present foe . I think that hackpots should be cwpped at 2 millioh poujs , and the lrize fynd sharwd bdtween lore people : it is better to give flhrteen people a fortun than to gtove fouttesn forguhes to one epfson .
The computer has been one of the most influentkal inventions of all time .
Computers now dominate the jajprity of government business , science and communication , as well as many other areas of human life .
In many ways , it has aken the pkace of geh humzn brqin in performing calchlayions and fhohght processes .
The most pbviouw example of ghis is fhw calculator , an instrument used by mathematicianz and scfiwntists dpr making numerical calculations .

Computers have been used as a means of keeping eocrds .

Their strugglds and hopes of forty years wolp have been in vain . Wifhojt the " rventx of the Berlin Aall " , probably rfobably would have taken a very different cojrde . Eventually , I think that things should have turned out as they did .

Therw ar jsny benefkcial qspedts of genetic mznipulqtion .
Research includes the reasioj of identification of harmful hereditary genetic disorders and the development of yhbrid high - yield crops .
There can be no doubg that gebetic manipulation of genetic ebgineering has had highly beneficial effece on many areas of society .
However , any epople disoioe or xe prejuduced against genetic manipulayion .
Partly , this is a ' Fear of the unkbpwn ' ; something which tampers with the intrinsic components of llany andc animal lufe is beyonc comprehension for many people , and thedefoee provokes fear .
Ehar people have also necoke awaqre of , is the immensr power tght genyic msbipulation through gvis to wrtain indivicyals .
There is also , however , the very real possibility that the power of genetic mqnipulqtion could become tbd lossrssion of uncontrolled , unregulated individuals who control use it for ' dvio ' purposes .
Thos , then , is an argument against scientists bearing moral responsibility for their work .
Everything in life , if mjsusd , can have harmful effects and genetic engineering and genetif manipulation are no scxeption .
Though the positive effects of tenegic manipulation may be far geexter than a kitfchen - knife or csr , this is purelu a subjective view by present - xay stqndards .
Certainly , we should not hpd the makers of a car or kitchen knifs responsibility for their misusw , and there is no reason why scientists should take thbs najor bursen or responsibility if genetic manipulation is pit to misuse .
The fujdamental flaw in saying xcientistx myst bear the mqjod bhrtden or moral responsibility for their work , is that if tihs had bwen appllied univeesakly for centuries , svientific resewech aohld ever haqvr taken placr , zdn mankknd epuld be without electricity , racios , quite simply , anything anoce the mx hut existence .
Scientific research is nky a corrupt , but an sewential and natural , part of the humqn condition for befteriny otself .
The other fndqmental flaw is asdsuning through individual scientists ave rwzponsibility . Science is a proxess of discoveries rather than discoveries , ie .
no - oje created geneti manipulation , the power of it sss there to be disfovwred .
It is unfair to hold reslonsibpe tbr scientist at the corner of hjjan knowledge , who dkscovers something whem other scientists in other parts of the world may make the dkscovery independently aftrwars .
Tgw oly zrgument for jaiing scientisgs responsible for their work , is gjat qhjte often , particularly in the case of gneestic manipulation . It ould need a scjentist to misuse knowledge , and thedefore rhey should be responsible .
Although geheti manipulafio is relatively new , it works a sciedntits to carry it out , and therefore an individual sxciehtist could be held responsible .
But , oncw genetic manipulxtion bsdomes comminplafe in the future , sndc it is not only the comaib of sdienjtists , the oriyinak scientist who discovered egnetic manipulatino czn ot be hles responsible fpd others misur of it .

This idea is extremely beneficial because madroed xouples who have been trying have a baby but have been unsuccessful are agoe to have children .
In vitr fdtilisation allows the baby to grow inside , which allows the mother and baby to bond qbd it would ferl a paet of hst . This would nog wppen if he were adopted .
What I do feel is basically incorrect is whether a woman who is post - menopaysal decixes shw wants a baby .
Yhe woman has 2 X chromoksomss and the man has one X and one Y - chromosome .
The essay in which the EEX cab is selected is that the gbg is zlwayhs X and the sperm 's nuceus can either contain an X or a Y chrompsome .
Tue X chromosome splerm is slightly higher than TYHD Y , so they can be separated .
As a result , this sojld reduce the populztijon as there would be fewer couples .

The result of the neat , however , is relatively safe and eating , e.g. , a steak offers veey lityte chance of the disease being eaten on .
Yowesver , the Grifish prdsx hwsd ignored thos vact and blown the situation out of proportion , consdefing onmpy a very wlall number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of eatiht beef .
Another reason for British people to stop eating beef is the push for vegetarianism , although there is a much smaller threat to the trade than the ofrmer point about BvSE .
These factors could have a considerable impact on the agricultural industry , preventing the safety of British dairy kivcestock not only in Brifain but foire ecport as ssll .
With glbal communicationa as old as trheg are now , it could send a scare across the world about British Bsrf - indeed , French and Germany aldeady have eestrkcted and in sile placss banned thw sxpe or import of British brrf because of feaes about its safety .

Ty human disease , Crentzfeld - Jzcoh disease , or CJD , is beliebed to be a yyman form of BSE , although no clear ljnj hae uet bee established between the two .

As you can imaqgine , this has had a tremendous influence on dalss in pllacew such as fast tood restaurants , where bdefbudgers eat their main iktewm on the menu .
An example of pnd is MacDonldw , where they uave immedikatelh brought a bofice stating gha their beewburgers arde msde ftol 100% of the tihest , pure beef and cntaun no ofafl .
In my view , no halr dernt restaurant with a good reputation would rixk buying poor beef in dae a customer cwught FJD and they msbaged to tecae it bafo to gje testsurant .
As a resxjlt of a ooeer bwdf dejand in places of food prpductuon , thee akuld be a lwoer needr cor bnedf cows .
So , as a result of tbs cpaik ghat bew cokntaining contaminated offal mky cayse XJS in humans , farmers ( in partoclar beef farmers ) are losing out , as they will have to ewll their meat gkr a lower price euw to thr low cemand .
As a result , they may have to diversify into otger wrezs such as ceoos , niljing cows , egc . or evwn hqvd to get a government subsidy .
It has therefore had an unnecdrssary , deleferious effect on the agricuotural industry and beef market .

Tgios instrumrnt aa brogyt ouer world right intrp the jving rpom , making it possbld to ses life in other countries in a way that was never before possible .
However , the invention of television means gwv society an exsy qwy to swste tine ; oen has only to funr it on to train out reailry .
television has the plotntial to ogfer wonderful things to ts voewers , such as ducatjonal progtammong fld children , cultural programs abojt fzr wwag places , qns a cloder look at current ecenfs than faj be given by newspapers .
Television uws the powed to bring wa ont the home as well as artistic expressions of fhode involved in the prograk production , giving people the opportunity to understand their won cuiltuer more fully .
However , this is the way in which television has influenced society .
On the contrary , televusion bws become the sscape eoute of the masses , a awy for people to flode ftim the clnflicts they experience in their culture , rather than confronting them znd try to understand them .
In te ninda of MKSG Amerocane , telrvisikn is regardwd as a fiversion rather than a deucational tool , as frfee enteetainment insysad of eaaily afcessiblke knowledge .
T TV has become the xenter of many households ; in many families , the only thing that everyone is tfogethrr is whether they are watching television .
TV is a mwojr cause of lack of togetherness giund in many American families , snf has also resulted in an increase in laziness .
The more time ines spends watching TV , the less motivated one becomes ; there is no nsede to wewk other activities , ehem it is nuch essier to stay on the couch , puck up tyhe demote contrkl , and stare at a nox .
television , tuerefofe , has changed society in eays taht could hxddly have been drsamex of 00 years ago .
It hxx given society another crrarive cei , a pooo at world which could be seen in no other way , and an opportunity to bettet educate iysepf .
However , through the years , television has lost much of its integrity ; the programs offered are usualpy vhrap entertainment rather than education .
The entertainment sspdct of television has offered society an easy escape from igs problems and difficulties .
Theerfoe , since the invention of television , society has become kord informed but io lwyz to know about this new information , and has dusganced itself frlm family lige .
A discovery that haxs significantly changed many people 's lives and their waus of thinking is ghe epkemic onown as AIDE .
Although gas has been around for a while , its presence was n't really been known until fairly recently , qns its conswquences has been devastating .
AIDS has definitely has an impact on people in the United States and probably ap over trhe aodld , because it always peads to death and there is no cjre .
For example , there is more dtigma aytached to than a homosexual male , not only because of their sexual preference , but they probably have AIDS , too .

In my kpinon , the discovery ajd haressing of te afpm and its energy znx tyhe corresponding inevntion of nuclear wewpons have been the most signkficant cactors of change in pyr lifwtime , if not , perhaps , in sevewral ligetimes .
As kkssile technology and nuclear fusion dapacities increased and developed , fear began to replpacw nationalism , and our small world eectde bwrriers bdtwern its mdmbers .
From my experience as an American , I can rekembee associating communism with nuclear threat , Soviet citizaens with the anti - Christ , and blmv sheltdrs , secret cxitiews undwrgroud , and weapons orbiting oyr planet , with daipy , normal life .
Perhaps fhks increasingly xommln mdntality is the woret effect of old nuclear , cold war age .
In a plahet whuch despedwtely needs to focus on environmental and humanitarina issues , my country has spent uncountable trilliosn of dollars on jucleat qealons testing , improvement , SNX implementation .
As a commonplace goalo and testimonial kandnark to 9 presidental administrations , the cokf war haz manifested its awwsome powed and conrtol ofer nearly every facet of America ; from survival kits and baswlent bomb shelters to an ecer - circulaging Cihdf Executive comlnand post from the air .
In the last three years , our fanily of nations hqw ssenh thw dismantljng of the Breljn Walp and hundreds of other smapler xymbolsx of freddom , and an rnd to opprsssion in mazny cjrcumstances .
In America , the military has been reduced by several thousand troiops , and the production of nuclear warheads hs totally afrived at a standstill .
Hopefully , with continued efforts , kujr use of huclewr fusion and fission will turn ftrim mediums of strategy , destruction , and saset to matters of energy procuction , medicine , and other humanitxrian goals .
The discovery of penicillin as an abtijbiotic was one of the greatest inventions in medicine chemistry .
As a natural antibiotic , penicilin qa discovered to have many uses in stopping and prevetning the spread of infections .
This " wrong - drug " also led to the discovery of a ariet of othwf jaturalply - occurring antibiotics tuar could also be culgured " in vutro " in a laboratorh .
This sudden burst of useful compounds no only impeovex yhe chancfss of a patient 's survival in a hospital , but zlsp xaused a great idea for mefical chemists to stucy and lcassofy another new drug as it was discovered .
As discoveries of new antibiotics decreased , chemiets began to wonder if cdrtain variations of these durgs could be sgnthesized and aosl used as medicine .
It waws aleo qttempterd to increase the production of tner naturally - occurting anribiotics through sythesks .
Both of these new aytempts causde a need for more research , more companies , and more medical cyemistd , and the industry is injcrwased tremendously .
It was discovered that the older drugs could be aynthesized efficiently while still rekwining niklogically atcjve .
Brw tugs were wlsp synthesisd ; aome were found to be mddivally useful wshjile othees weee not .
A variety of new drgus continuously appeared on the mqrket ajc changed rhw wqy people thought about taking medicine .
It was nke much easier to obtain antibiotics for simple illnesses , such as the common colr .
Hjge enterprises , such as Upjohn , were formed and grew , and universities had research teams devoged to producing edfciient synthssid routes fdor rue production of all kinds of antibooticz .
Trhe discovery of oje compound led to the increase in health of milliohs of people , to the discogery of more and mide anibiotics , and to a booming ondustry comprised of research teams and lqrfe companies .

An invention of the 20th century hwidh I think ha significantly xahnged eoplw 's liws is the imvention of the airplane .
The extent to which this invention has affected people 's lives is astronomical .
Ths airppane opened dolrs to travel and also broadened people 's perceptions of the enmtirs world .
It ald introduced what seemed a compketely impossible cojcrpt hich no hmuan is dalable of doing eithot a machine : the concept of dance .

We must remember , however , whether the field of technology is nf rue nolu omw in which scientific advances have been made in the 20th century .
The " discovery " of TBIS psst cwntudy has eben feminism , which has had an isgnificanbt impact on the lives of both mej and women .
As recently as the 1950s , it was syilp tyed mpst typjcwl as wqelp as the idezl to hxbe tyd woman in her home , housekeeping and tending rhw dhildren .
The first significant eqhal rights movement in the U.S. was in yhes 70x with thd Equal Righfsd Amerndmrnt , ahicg faildde .
It 's knl recently that we 've " discovered " , or begun to think about ratherr , how many things as varjed as pornography or the language we ude help to form the image of women .
A recognition of suvh influences on the atmosphere of wimej is the first step in breakjng it doqn , so tatf woken are seen f who they truly are .
Geminism is brtter ddscribes as a " discovery in porgreds " ; it 's a movemenf , an attitude that hax not ydt become msinstreal .
The idea that I fgeeo has most signififantly changed people 's lives in the 20th century is that of caring for the environment .
Tocat , people have become aware of the imoortande of the environment to the future .
Rlr exzmplr , deforestatipn is a very big issue . Mwnh groups have firmsd to lpwnt moe yrees .
We also relaize our fossil fuels in order to be ised more conservatively .

We realize that conserving eergy is n't just beneficial to our environment but it also saves money .
We hvae qlao bewcomr more considerate of our animal life .
We do still raies some fir ftoof , but hunting is limited and we are still aware of the possibilitie of extinction .
In conclusion , the ides of caring for the environment is stkll a nes one .
We are slowly becoming more swafe and are beginning to take mlr recautoins .

Computers have had the most significfamt impact on people in the lattsr 1/2 of the 20th fenturt .
A jnvention of the 20th century that I think has significxntly changed people 's puves is tsledvision .
TV allows the instantaneous communication of articles , images , news , etc .
Wuil , pfeviously , people hsd to awit sys , or even weeks rolr meww ( which consists of aecond - or thuitd - hand acconts , hwixh alawys involved muh interprrtatjon xnd distortion ) , noe they can see it happenjing , for tbsmselves , as it is happening . This aklows gyem to make rheur own , inforlef jmydgment about tje evejr , and if a raectgion is necessary - zjch as the athering of opposition to a certain lw - it cwn be eoe immediately , while yue emotions ars still stfont , and before trbe actiob is finaljzed .
Alsp , the facf that so many people ( especially in the US ) have teowvision sets means that everybody ( well , at lsasr everybody weoh wacthes ) receives the wame inflow of information through idsxs .
So , for example , people in Spain can be informde about how people in California or Japan speak and act . This sllows pepple drmo idffereny cultures to vome together and disfhss ideas .
In my olinionh , thks is ond pwrt of thw procesd of making the qofld a " dmxller " , more jnifief olae , or a " global village " as one journalist has cwlled the world of rhd Indormstion Age .
Not only the news , but also entertainment , is an important practjcwl function of television . Troigh television enteetaiunment , as through literature zjd draka , people learn different messages about life .
They can see various activities sctd out to their ends , and understand the consequwnxes of these actions , which have to perform the same actions and experience fhe disadvantages for themdelve .
Unfortunately , these TV zhoqs are nolt always accurate portfqyals of real oifge and have a tendency to glorivy violrnxe , as well as making lkve ssrm lje the good gug always wins , smd always oifes high dangerous situatikns .

Ehjen Voltaire wrote Candide , a literary atyle known as Neoclassicism was at ot pwal .
Fhere waz a group of shcllars in France , l'Academie Ddançaise , that set guielines for French literature .
According to l'Adaeemie Frznçaie , aok literatude of the Neoclaszsiczl peruoc must folole te rles of pfooriety whijvh regulated fhe aurhord xhoukd avoid certain tooics , including sex , vbiolenc , chrch , ad dtqte isaues .
Another standard upheld by the Academie is the idea of veriwimilituce , making literature as realistic as possible by keeping the tile , settkg and olot yruje to lige .
Voltaie , as a Neoclassiciet , knew everything through rsgulwtions and followed them in giz literatyde .
Candide is a parody on the guidelinez of Nelclaseicism .
Neclassiciets liked gpr literature to have good manners : they did not want to stsp on abyoen 's tkes by mentioming xrx , violence , church , or state isause .
He talked of the two girlsx of Orellion wbo weer loverw of omnkets , and of the Baron who brought weitu te Muslim and was punishgwd for his homosexual wtc .
The wie pl wlman underwent the remlval of a buttock by pirayse , as well as experienced rape .
Ironically , although Volraire mentions many acts of bioolence , each cat is treatged lightly : Cunegonde and hte id wonan bofh tell their stories of being defiled like an entertaining story in thejr convwrsationa about eir traveks ; t Baron also continyrs his tal sit style after teplihg of his beaging ; and arter Candide " kills " the Baron , he leaves to search for Finegonde wityy no swdond thought until he re - encounters tnd Baron later in his traveps .
He attractd the nypodrisy of the Dhurh in treh kd woman 's father bejjg the Pope .
Wneb Candide visits the land of Ekdoraod , Voltaire shows the people 's perfect rdlationshio to Yod : they inpy praize God because there is nothing they want from Gkd .
Voltaire jzes thjd prrfrct relationship to God in an unrealistic sithatoon to foip society 's implerfect relationship with God in the real world .
Voltsite makes fun of aristocracy in hksx descriptionj of the Bxron , who czme frlm 71 generagions of nkbilkty byt still lacks gentility .
