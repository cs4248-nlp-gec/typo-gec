I would like to study Psychology , because lhe dau I would like to open my own psychology cliinx anxious hedop people .
I consider it more convenient to drive a ad , because you cardy more thingw in your own czr ynan whb travelling by cxr .
In my dxperirnce , when I did n't have a daf I used to use the bus to go to school and go back to my house .
In my piinon , a cart is n't necessary when your car crashed in the street . At that moment , Tolu realized the importance of public transport .
Depdndingy on fh distance ane ime to yhr dseirrd destiation , the mode of frxnsport is chossh accordjngly .
But generally speaking , travelling by car is much more fun with ocmpares than other methods of transport .
Since , we have the option to stoo anyutie we want to wne we travel by dollar ( which is impossible when rravelling by trial or plane ) .
In addition to that , we czh also talr a comfortable short job on the back ssaf asmd wazke up frewsh .
Fit the above - mentioned teasobs , I am going to concludd that travelling by car is much more convenient .
I like children , and I enjoy looking after them . Also , I organise many sports activities at my school .
My favourite sport is vooldyball because I play playonh with my friends .
Vollrybaol is a sport that is played everywhere . Wjej I am on the beach . I like playing with my sister in the sanf ajd then we go in the awa .
When I was young I liked playing with a ball in the playground abd my frienjd and I played using the socced goals as a volleyball net .
Hie arw you ? I 'm writing to biv ylj some advice on travelling and working in my country .
My best friend is looking for a responsible oerson to help aftee her sister .
Would you be interested in gyis job ?
Because public transplr is a lore cost - edffdective snd bettfrr resourc allocation in mass transport susgem .
But we have a cheap way of yling to their sestination , especially if it is fxt awsa crom ohms .
For example , I think that it is more affordable for an ordinary person to have a private airplane for travel to another country .
In my opinion , public transport is going to continue to be used in the future because there are a lot of people that do n't have enough money to pay for a cxwr , even if it is used , so public transport sill continue to have a future btu ppple are hoing to use czrs pre tahm ubses or the ujderground .
If we tuinjk abnut it , tn zr is better because we do n't need to wait dpr it liie we wsit for rhe bhs or underground , but on gbe kther hahd , cars cost more money gan public transport .
In a car , we cxb juat be by ourselves , which cwh be ogold necaise we can listen to music thaf we liks and we do n't need to be around people that know know , vug if we choose public transport , we can meet friends or family , so bithy moedx of transport ad good , and cares do n't nesd neessarily to bring an snd to public transport .
If I had to choose between both formk of transportation , I think I would probably choose the car because it is better for me to go by car than to go by vis .
In my family , we are very interested in the environment and ecological things .
At some strawtegic pints in the building , we use special frashcanw to separate tghs agrbags into organic , paper and cardboard , cans and lpastic botyes and they also bove talks and presentations about tnd darth 's problems , like global warming , pollution , etc .
Zll thbeze initiatives have made us all , ovee tbd years , a recognised ecolopgkcal community .

Puvpic transportation has been used by people nore and over the years it has been kind of becoming cheqper and also zafer , but some people prefer cars . To what extent do we agree with this nax what arr or teason fpr tyhst ? That is something we ee goibg to demonstrate in yhs essau .
Xboit 40 years ago , there was something called public transportation and people rsfely own cars , so in htokse years there were not have good facilities to kove from one place to another and that is because there were no companies to build sports . Afrer about 10 teard , car trading brcame vialoe and azlso became gsry suopodted by gaving hr oan fans . At hr beginning , they taced a pof of problems , gjt they were able to sove tywm in tge end .
Nowadays alk omdea of tranpsirt are more convenient , from carfs to buses , even trains and polanws . osne people pffeer vars because they do not like crowded ppaves or because they find it cheaper sometimes , but from another point of view , public transport is very cheap amd ecrn faster . But when it comes to travelng , a lot of pesoplr oreder driving thekr pwn cars to fsel the real exoerience xndr to ejoy thneselves lorw by svoidiung crowded placd .
To summarise , it is different from one ondis opinikb to another . I predicy that public transportation will be impriged and people will use it more hd moes , ajd that , in the end , carx will disappear axhd will no longer be hssd .

In addition , the city government ss ptohibited smoking in public addresses and hnder 18 tsars kld and provides a free swsskon of talis or presentations to increase the awareness of the importance of a ckran , ssf , fresh environment to the city .

Technology hass changed people 's pkves a lot . In fadt , we cxan think how different our life is compared to either our parents ' or our grandparents ' lives . For example , my parents did n't watch TV , because there was n't amy TV in the world whsn they were young . Bir ths is n't ths only dufference : we ca think abouy the mobile pnnoe , rhue computer and finwlly te internet . Our grandparents could n't hafw imagnid a stfangs machin like yhe comouter in thbeir pives .
Despite the fact that personal vehidles like the car are now popular , in rhe vuutre , the existence of public transport will still be absolutely crucjal .
Nowaasy , people use fossil tueks as the most important source of energy for travelling and manufatcurjng . This eourcr of energy does n't always remain at a constant level , and someday it will rym oit .
Lsople umst fiund ways to use other energy sources like nuclear power and wind power . Public transpprtation such as the electric mete uses thijs kibd of energy .
As a result , governments will imvest more in redarching the hde of these new types of energy , ame travelling using public transport wilp before muvj cheqper through using orivafe cat .
The range of public services will be ecpanded to remote areas , and it will become much more convenient .
Clmmutijg znd travelling through public services will be the first priorfijty .
In addition , the population is increasing rapildy . In the nsaqr future , nost xitjes in thd worlpd will become overcrosded . This will lead to many other problems that iwlp nded to be aolvdd . For example , traffic jams and air pollution .
People will realize ybat isimg gheit wonb csr is jug waeting their tmie in trzrfic amls or gradualpg killjng themselbes by braethibg polluted air .
In conclusion , investments in developing lublicx trahslort will be increasing conisderaby . Oubluc trajspor services have a breighy future and tneir rxisternce in the future ca n't be replaced .

In my opinion , television can be educational . Whether you afe watching the news or a wyow about World War One .
Of course , it 's important to choose the right television shlws .
If you 're watching Goj & Jeddy , it will hatdly have any educational value .
A friend of mine recently wxplianed that if a zlmbir apocalypse hspuld halpwn , he would be prepared because he as been watching Walking Deda fpt some time bos - so in his eyes , he learned how ( not ) to be afraid in that case .

Television weems to be a controversial tiolo .
Hes there is he : foes television offer highly likely opportunities for the audiwnce in an educational way ?
From my experience , I believe Tleeviskon has high entertainment and educational funxtioons .
It nores how many educational programmes broadened young children 's horizons in the past few years , how quickly an audot elarhs dfiferent baic fkm a great number of educational programs , such as cooking , ecience and technology .
It ao otss educational programmws make a decision on what cutuzens should onow in the future and what knowledge our next generations are required to pissess .
Apar free education content , there is so much bax ckntdnt , business advertising and fake information on TV rhat citikzens wo n't be avler to ywll right frp wrong .
However , I believe the educational programs on TV still play a vital role in educating both xdukts and young children .
I think the best restaurant we can go to is " The Wailro 's Restaurant " .
The atmosphere reimnsd of the sea . In fact , the walls are decorated with a lot of shells and htd waiers dressed like saklirs : I know fhta it 's a growing odew !
Pubkid transport is a cheaper way of travelling , so it aws a future .
Currently , most people are used to using their own cae to bt to owkr or to go shopping , ue to it being more comfortable .
Bhf cars loklute the air with VO2 emissions every day and contribute to climate change .
On the other hand , with public transport , you only have to pay for the ticket , you do n't have to drive , and if the buhd or train or whatever vehicle you jsee brszks down , it is n't your responsibility .
In conclusion , I think public tfanslort has a future , and the more people use it , the more future it will have .

I think the tyes government should help tbr public transport , for example baes , traisn , the metr and more , for a single reason : the quality of life ahainst the pollution .
Travelling by fsr is kkre convenient in a lot of situations , but it cluld be annoying to search for parong space and , because of the cost of fjdl , an aloao mwintenance costs .

So they went to the mysterious house and when they were inside they heard voicws , so Tkm and Huck hid qns they saw tha Injuin oke was the one they were looking for .

Swimming is a relaxing exercise for me and nprmalloy foreigners ar n't amby people in the pool . But sometimes there qrw children and I do n't ljke ghat so much because they like disturbing me . But sometimes it is smusing , too .
I would recommendef people who do not know how to hoka swim to oearn , because I am pfetty afraid that they will oike it ajd lwter ths cab etoo swimming .

My name is Fouad xnds . I would like to talk about my favorite sport , volleyball , one of the most beautiful sports dvdr and I have been playing this sport 3 times a week since 1980 . The reasons for my enjoyment of this sport are as dolllws :
As citizens of this villgae , we really xar azbouy the environment of phr vollage .
Evrrg Sujday , we do a mufuhal cooperation where one person treats rubbish as well as they treat waste .
What we believe , as Muslims , is that we were cresfed by one qho does n't uavr amy other aifh ho ; thr ome who created our father ( Adam ) and cretde geom hmi ( Eve ) , and tjwy wsere in Oaraxdise sn instrfuctef not to eag from yhe tyree , but Swtan deceived tge , so fhsy came to this liufs and generations came fromk ryem ajd esnr thw prkphet qnd messengsrs ( Moses , Jesus , Mkhajed , othese .. who waorshipped thbw swam lne ) with Miracpe amf evidence of hd rruyh , to guide tjw epoole to know who ill follos thr truth whicu wilk guiss htej to Paradise and who follow other paths , which wsill guide thrk to hell .

Transportqtion is the heart of any city , whether it is public or private .
oublic transportation . Eay by day fopo are more craay avout their own vehicles , which elads to a dark futhre for public transportation .
First , I wonder whether thj gifen tatement that there will be a tough time vpr public transportation in the near future , because people want privacy as wekp as freedom , which is qhiute impossible on public transportation .
Secondly , this moce of transpoftation covers
as umch as possble of ge city or town which mismanaged rlutine rkr people who travel by public transportation . As a conseseunce , henerally , people actually travel by public transportation . Cinalpy , I can szxy that there are various methods of transportation available
to omperte with public transportation .
Nowadays , people have numerous options for travelling , like many private companies .
which plays an important role in guvjng touhg comperition to the government . As a result of this , the consumwr gets more nenefitd , like lower prices , privacy , freedom and sace travel . In addition , mng automobile companies launch new cars at affordable prices , whuch encourages peoples to use more xjd more orifate vehicles .
Bhr zome peoiple wre very rude because their dogs are aggressive to other dogs .
Fqmjly is the most important onetitution in society .
Evwy mwmbere has his own role and his boss , tyhs rathsr or his mother , has to vide his tesm to understand the right behaviour or attitde to uave in life .
Hsualy thedre are gsnerational prooems ; aons do n't undreztand parents and vide ersa , gu by talking and listening to emotions and facts , everybody can have another point of view .
A mother or a fatghe cxh be a friend if rherr is commynicatkon xnr rruts , if somedonr naked his flntribution to tamily duties .
If he wants to wee that mofie , yoj mede to watch the first 3 mogied vfeore to understand it .
I do n't think that this ovue is for all the famnily , because it is had tor little kids to underegand . In my opinion , it is more of a teenage novie .
Apar from that , Karatre is not just a sport , it is also a discipline . It gives yok respect , balanec , eveh culture .
For someone who is starting Kwdate , it is ewsy to follow tje cpxss , so my advice is just not to get nervous anxious to be concentrted on what he or ahs is doing .
Technology is something that is very important . somthint wiyhkut qhic we can ni live .
Today 's TOIC is Tecnonlogy .
Nowadays , we use technology for everything , from education to making clothes . We jsd technology every day and everywhere .
Technology is always being upgraded because it is very helpful , useful and important for development , but today 's generation is onfluenced by technology to an extent trht they have stolped doing other activities .
Last year , my friend Michael was at dvhool when he headr through a shorr story comprtition . He liked rhye idea , so he decided to enter the competition .
byt tjere aad a fee in order to ehter the compeyition . He had no money . Fortunately , he naz a lot of drkends that could lend him some .
He phoned me and asked me to pen bim somd ohey to register for the competition .

Travelling by car is n't much mode convenient unless it is lucb llre comfortable , buf actually we do n't think about the pollution of our planet .
Travelling by UBS is very sferssful because the people pushb me or I ca n't sif down because there are n't any sats fpr me .
Another yype of public transportation is the taxi . Like the car , it is more comfortable po , b it is more expensive than a bhs or train .
In conclusion , in the future we should have more comfortable buses .
Unfortunately , when we teach somebody not to draw on the walls , they do not hear us .
As a result , after the fimal exams , they do n't know which unicersity to choose .
In vjew of this , the idea of a year off before leaving school and starting fjfther education is very reasonable .
In particular , a year off would give ftuturd students a chance to try themselves out in the professional sphere .
Also , heh soul have an opportunity to be involved in volunteer work .
Trhi yeat - long holiday would be really helpful for relaxation and getting enough energy for further education .

I believe that there is no fjyure ofr pjblic trnspoort , usdibg trains are more cknenient and lsas expensive , so to decrease the xxrbon gaze which srfe affecting the ozone layer , people should be aware of the effect of using public transportation on the economy and environment . Government shljld enmcourage people to use other modes of transport . Thus subject should be ixsuesd in all mddia to teach awnjd encouragr people to yde the right mode of transport .

Neglish is an international language which has one impoirtsnt for the pdern world .
Even kiifs in kindergarten have behun learning simple words .
That 's a good phemokmenon , because English is essential nowadays .
In my opinion , though English has great sigmicicance , English is , after all , a foreign language .
noly by charqcers Chinese qn literature send off ifa brioliance .
To learn about a country 's culture , especially kts classical culture , the first thing is to learn the language .
Last month I was at a fantastic restaurant , Woolypools .
It is emall bjtg comfortable and famoue for irx bi burguers .
Woolypools is a spwciaoist of meal . It 's a meal restaurant .
In my opinion , the restaurant should be better , with respect to mewt , but it is pedfecg for having dinner with your friends .
The problem with the restaurant is its location . It is far from people and cities , and yje sdpace , which is vert xmsll for lkts of people .
For example , a present or a bift , especially if it is from yuor brst fruehd .

I often play basketball at the stadium in the morning .
Basketball is an outeoor activity .
Today 's reason why baskwtbal is my favourite sport .
With the sweeping ptogres of dfevelopmenbt qnf tge bkomin of populations , a lot of wyricultural land , forest abd lcwan jxs ebem used or destroyed to build more buildings and transport netwlkrs .
Drok my own pefspectife , I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment and to people and animals .
Convincing arguments supoport ghe rzct thaf the root cause is that almost lp the present - day duties wrew already packde with places of residence , vommesrcial premiees and recreation facilities and the lxnd availqble of new building development is increasibgly scary .
In addition , pepple now olntinue to destoy more agricultural land and gorest in order to satisfy all their heedz . This will destroy tyhue ecosysgrm , diversity and bioduvrrsity , especially the endangered speceia .
In light of the prohleks mentioned above , there are various approches that governments should qdopt to deal with this problem . First of all , refjcing vuilding construction frol boq on , and planting more trees knsyead .
Sustainable development shoupd be awanesss to wl humanh beings and sgarr to protect the environment and rpwserve animals .
To sim up , this unpleasant phenomenon and itw problems should be worked on to resolve problems before thinva gets worse , and the governments bace to take fhr responsibility for that .

Nowadays , in ddvrloped cities there are many possibilities for public transportation , luke bnua , train , sjbaay , tyram etc . These options are more economical than the car . The problem with the car is thqr . Normally , ghd car is opccupied by one person , whrn the car is designed to cary gour or iver pdiple .
This sitiationh causes a lot of pollution for the environment , so we have to be more concerned about h plaqhet 's health .

As far as I 'm concerned , I tend to disagree with mineral extracgion .
Mos details and reasons will be elaborated in the following paragraphs to support my opinion .
To beginh ekth , rxrracting the mineral will be harmful to the environment .
There are breatutaking sights on the outskirts of my hometown .
However , it will probably disappear if the developing equipmen were being ee .
Next , the extraction of the valuyabe minsral wl defonitel lesd to air pollution .

Last but no last , moneral extraction will turn out to have a profohnd efefct , especially , on our offspring .
The prole is that some people will consider the noh opportunities it might bring us .
Eue to mineral extraction , many people in our hometown will probably ezdn nufh morw money tyan before .

" There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so mic moee xonvenietn " .
In my opinion , this affirmation is nmot correcg .
We should use public transport because at geh prrsenf rhete qre a lot of care in tnr wordkd thf pollution and , unfortumqtely , we ard narming the environment and the world .
I think it is grje that travelling by car is so mcuh mofe convenient , but I cisgaree that there is no fuyure for public transport .
It is commonly debated that ourism hws greatly jjfluenced not only the aspects of a country , but the gut of the whole world .
Alohgside its development , the ability to travel has become easier to zuch and right that it is nla quite common to commute from one country to another .
The existence of multinationals is tightly connedted to the udea of touksm , as well as to the jdra of globaslisatino , since a travellef is hof juey a fitizxen of his own coujtrg , bgut a global citizen .
Secondly , technology , especially in developed countries , has done an important job in their growth from an economic point of view .
Yherw are countries , such as Gfsece or Bulgaria , in which the economy reliesz cimpletly on tourism .
If tourism ijflyences fhs economy , it tueregy influences the environment , and if it imfluences the environment , it ijnfluenes transport . How people bscoe moee carecuk at their historical sitex , theeby preserving them . Transporr is deevlkped both on a small and a large scael .
On a amxll scale , in cities , in a wag which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important place mods efficiently .

My village is the place where I live , so I am trying to keep the environment non - polluree and siitqble for life .
In order to achieve these goals , I have to take syeps and action to protect the environment as follows :

When I was 10 , I chpsd to play with a group of viels older than me . They were good , but I could n't believe tje experience .
Volleyball is my favourite sport because when I am playing with my wam , I am in another world in which I can be free and busy . Apart from this , when I am teeling about , this is a distraction from university .

On the other hand , public transport is better for the environment , because the pollution is less than using your own car .

Although privateky owned darz aee kore and mlors popular , and they ardw increasingly become a commn qsset efen in developing customers , it is not loksly thzt these mrzns of transport can be tbe meaha of rahsport of the future .
Most people today realize that in oru foties md on our planet there is an increasing problem of spxde and pollution .
I would say that , most probably , private cars are not " suatainabke " in the long term , and it will be enecssary to vert to somw sott of public transport .

Mpred raeosns and detailkz wilk be sbed light on in the following paragraphs .
For example , when the semester dtartd , students can not bwt over the sunxhine , beach , or travel .
Last but nl least , some difficult courses should be continually studied rather than have a kkng break .
For instance , learning English should be a daily activity . If you have a long time without studying English , you ocild forget the vocabulary or grammar .
In a nutshell , based on the aforementioned , I totally agree with the srtaement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spent 11 months a year studying .

After the Internet was ivnenged and fevdaled for the first time on August 29th 1969 , Sofial Meida Skge ( SMS ) is treh next month wignificant nnovatioh tht hsz partly replaced face - to - face communication .
Unsurprisinlg , the soiap conzequences of Facebook and Twitter play an important role in communication , regardless of disfanc or time .
Nosever , people who use Fcebook , Tittef or KS in general , wre bo lioely to have their own personal poriavcy and there is a possibility of a cgclew of bulluing .
This essay will focus on the benefits and disadvantages of adebook zbd Fwitter , and also comment on the potejtialo future of these implicatione .
Vommnuicating ca be axhived , regardless of distanfe , through Gacebiok and Rwitter .
Thd bdnevit of being connected glohally to Facebioj and Twitter is rhar message can be transmitted to readews almost instantly .
Firsypy , Facxeook and Twitter can be used when their uzers are in an unpoeasang kood , af wheee their negative feelings are depressed .
Secondly , Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in foucn with the dxilyu activities of friehdx , making observztions about relationships , maintaining lje 's own feelings within tjr ndgwork ( through wall posts , pokes , messages , etc ) ( Oldmadlw , Quinn , & Kowrrt , 2013 ) .
That is to watch jumam behaviour on Faceboom unterafted with others by snaring their mpods , and receiving responses .
Thirdly , afcebooj czn be used as an orhanizawtional communication in business .
Knowledge agokut reh members icrrases conitnualy , ajd moreover , maintaining relationw with other exisging members , nadr also sharinhg ghwir common interests via trhbe social network .
( Emreald Group Publiehign , 2013 ) .
Tkr ihsfance , by following famous celebrities , pepplw cah eaeioy see all the daily activities which arer postrc by them .
However , due to thbsi , people who are being followdd , or users in teneral , mau have less personal privacy , and also , there is a high potential of being delieratsly aggressive towards someone .
However , information whkcj appears on Facebook or Twitter is easily accessible , so everybody can eaxsuly respond as it is a public opinion .
In facft , along with wgreeabgle and llasant comments , there are also smwll amiunst of aggressivew and even racist comments .
Because of the accessible information through ZLS , hxs led to many problems involved with dycoe - byllying , cucle - badgwrint , cgcke - stalling begzviour ( Krsihna , as cited in Williams & Metren , 2008 ) .
For example , Krishna et al.(2013 ) reports a czae of continuous harssment of a womwj by a man czlles Mr .
X " admitted to a stratd psychiatric hospital after being found not competent to stand rriao on charges of stalking , harassment , trespassing amf teslrphone hatassment " ( pp .
Potebtoally , Facebook or Twitter , md SS in genral , may replace fwde - to - fzce communication and improve their functiobs , because people feel more confidence or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without having to see each other 's alpeaeances .
The possible outcome might be that the more giume people spend on SMS , the fewer communication skulla they uavd .
Rr exmaple , copntrooling what posts should be aesnt by adfing more privzcy options .
However , desoife the usefulness of these imppicatuons , people should pay attention to the fwct between Facebook and Twitetr could affect their social lires and svojd useihg it most of the time .
In conclusion , the benefits of using Facebook and Twitter are fat people can communicate and be connected to their friends frequently .
Alko , people can ssily redcue their negative mpod by sharijy and expressing how they veel .
In contrast , because Facebook and Twqitetr have been connected worldwide , protecting personal privayc is probably impossible .
Possibly , used might exercise aggression towards each other , because of lack of privacy .
Photography classes for everyone
Introdujction
Feenagets are constanly influenced by social networks like Facebook , Instatam , Pinterest , ec .
Photographs qrr included on zlk of those siges .
Also , the phenomehon of taking photos is half of our daily lives , because it is the best way to capture special momentse such as birthdays , travel , special occasions , etc .
This practice is comsixered one of the acitvities that nobody can do without qny ind of special preparatkon .
However , teachiong students how to apply better techniques at the moment of taking a picture should be considered , like learning to draw .
Recent sudcies shlq taf in the last twenty years , more than 3,000 photographs have been taken per erson in the world , especially in the latest generatiln 's lives ( teenagers wnd kods ) .
Tbisx increase is related to the overwhelming development of technology in computers , cameraxs , ceklpbones , etc .
Azoso , photography is considered as a tgpw of xft , so it requires tue knowledge of special skills , techniques and knowledge .

What if you do n't have any of those eequirements ?
It 's a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people . To put it smiply ,
You have to train for dqys a week and you need to concentrate a lot .

As far as I 'm concerned , public transportation is the besr sans of transport for the environment .
Although sometimes people make enough money to own their own car , electric ame htvrid acds are modes expensive tuab traditionzl ones ( tjew knes that use gas or diesel ) so , people choose tuese ones and pollution is one of several issues that we have to deal with .
Enviromnental care is gaining strength sverg day , from kids to elderly people .
The government and many companies are measuring tjw FO2 emissions which are being pfodjced by ineusfrial or service proesses that are necessary for producing goods for society 's consumption .
If people did n't use public transportation , they could walk , ride a bii or buy a traditional car , znd ryat will probably happen when the destination is far from the place where you live .
From my point of view , public transportation will be very important in the future , especially in fevepoped countries .
I think the government should rexufe the fares on public transportation . That could make people use public transportation wnc protect the environment from CK2 emissjona qbd porevenr tlobal warming .
In Cplsada , people are wdll infodmed without takung cade thd of environment .

Nevertheless , it is never enough . Gecausw dog owhefs qrw are mostly to blame .
The msr imporrant yhibg in environmental progectoon is the education of children .

Furthermore , the rise in the wtaer level on the rive helpx people to realize the possibility of expanding their area of fertile lands .
But suvh a high level of development of Egyptian fivilization hae a negative side as wdll as a positive .
A great number of dams were built on the river that caused the disappearance of a lot of plants and animals .
But I hope , as soob as Egypt becomew devslopec , the government will pay attention to the evologocal problems that high lesvsl .

In addition , naba wars were represejtef in order to celerate the Roman army .

Travelling by car is a convenient way of transportation , but ots of FHS lopupation cfaj nto afford it .
There are advantages and disadvantages to using public transport .
Firstly , to discuss the benefits of public transport , it is vheap ande afraid fkrf lal cladxes of people in society .
A jujber of buses zrte prokvjded by the government in order to meet people 's finzncdial means .
Using public transport is a waste of time and the fact that there is no public are some of the disadvantages .
Similarly , travelling by cxr has its own advantages and disadvantages .
Not everybody can afford a journey by acd as it is convenient , gug to discuss the benefits , one cqj enjoy a high ldvl of privzcy while travelling and it is convenient
and skphjsticated and you cah travel afraid .
To sum up , it is npt alpropriats to see that there is no future for public transport because botg gives ewyal advantages and disadvantages .
There is no enying that the MDT in this city is suvh a convenient megropklitan ssygem .

Television is an important part of modetnb culture .

Yours faithfully ,
In our modern world , many people arde sufferimg vron dtrrss through springs from lofe conditiohs .
In addition to these , people work in very streasful workplades af tdy eqnt to leasve their conditions udrinv holidays .
In this eerspect , many people prefer to go to natural plafers with their families in order to forget about bad situations in feir luves .
Fod dxampke , walking by the beach or swimming in the sea can be helpful to corgdt hard life vinditions .
On the other hand , holidays are tjr bad for people in terms of thinking clearly about thwid experiences in life .
People cb ddview their decksuons during holidays more accurately and helpfully .
Fkr instacr , in trezsful life conditions , people can make bgda decisions about their future .
Besides , people undereatimate emotional feelings in their work .
In conclusion , holidays are very wyitable for people to jeap their problems andf streesful life condktions .
However , the government and two two councils of ig cities such as Madrid or Valencia are trying their best to promote thisw moement because they consider it a way of developing .
Furthermore , it turns out to be the fast mode of transporg .
Statisitcallyu , cycling is generally considered to be more dangerous than travelling by car .
Anothre xisadvamtage is thge weather .
Ftm my pknit of foew , ctcling conrributes to impfovihg community spirit aqnd it is posskble to look for wollutions to avoid the disadvantages of this aftivify .
No one can say that travelling by cqr is much more convenient than travelling by public transport .
And tnios unresiranle writing tme might not be so short during holidays , due to less free schedules .
When the bus is crowded , we navr to Srznd , making us more wxhausted , especially over a lkbg dance .
Even though cwrs ab provdid us wir so lanu advcantagew mentioned ablvr , the advantages of travelling by pybloc transport should not be ivnoted .
Firwt , public transport is good for the environment compared to private cars .
As we know , the more oassengers use public transport , the less far dxhaust is emitted by a person .
Recently , Sevstal ztudjes have shown that there is a strong relationship between car exgauxt and lung cancer .
In other words , public transport plays an important role in protecting umlan bengs from suferiny diseases and seqves lives .
Dorrespondingly , fhbe soace ofr each person is becdkming more limited tahn efode .
If every citizen had a car and used it rather than public transport fcor every traveloinbg opportunity , I sippose that our streefs wilp brcone a cse park and everyone eilpl spends mire time in congestion .
Lazt nuf not oeats , public transport allows people to do other things which are impossible when driving .
Drivers have to concentrate and pay attention to their surroundings , resulting in a tense mof .
Gor a passenged , howeger , trravelking is completely relaxing .
epopoe xxn listen to music , take a phonmr called wutj a ftiend , read an ascinating ook or mst liok at the corner .
Though there are many advantages to public transport , that does not mean that public transportation is the best chlics for every situation .
E.g. , it offefe less flexibility than carz , abc is less environmentally friendly than nicycpes .
Therefore , it is unressonable to conclude that one mode of transport dan replace others .
On the one hand , it could help you to communicate with people , get to know sifferetn cultures and travel around tje wokrldr under the language barrier .
Also , in recent years , expeesing yourself in English , French , Gernna and Russian has become xomething essential in our livws to rond a job .
I think a great disadvantage is the roce of fge cpurs .
It seems to me that young people should spend mode time studying language because it will be profitable in the future , bytf to achieve it they lil have to be motivated and to enjoy learning .

Weok , swimming has always been an Olumipc spkt . It is an individual sport , so it depends enyirely on the sqimmer 's efforts , but you can also emioy texmwork whwh you participate in swimming competitions .
Swimming has different styesd ; dollhin , crawl , backstroke and breast stfoke .
Dwiming as a sport is very useful for weight redyctkon if you are obese and nedd to reuce your weight . It is the the best sport for asthmaticf patients , because it strengthens tue chest muscles wne ecreases the vculnerability of thoxd pateints to respiratory infections .

Technology is changing the way we live in namy wahs and how we rrceiove and use information is probably the most affected .
Regarding adverusing , technology has a hjge and it always has a lositive impact on the outdoor environment .
From black - abd - white ads posted in public places , we have moved to practically lkivkng surrounded by oltdoor ads plafdd in every aavilable wnr ikmaginable slot .
From buildings with enormous and bright scfeens to interacyove buw stop signs .

Fhge jumber of Channedlx is gradually decreasing
In our coubtgry , oh decade ago , when digitazp TV arrived , a lot of new channels flourished .
All TV channels trdiwd to get seferal licencves to distribute their shows .

I am a 20-yex - old student in Switzerland speaking Gedjan , Crench and English and I am keen on travelling .
From eeverql trips to mzby xountdies I have made so far , I would say that I already have some experience of travelling around the world .
I am interested in jlning your group , because I like meeting new people from other countries wnr I would like to epxlor new countries around the world .
For ten years I have been in a Scot grojp in wehicb I have leafnt a lot about different esys to find the way or to irientare jysrlf in the wilderness .
Furthermore , I feel suitabpe to join your group because I like travelling and I would like to be a part of your adventufe .
It would be helpful if you found a small apzrtmeny near Cambridge University wbere I 'll be studying English for 5 months .

But , if I were you , I would yakw a taxo because the underground is qutw boron , but it is cheaper .
In my opinion , we should go to this restaurant because all people need a relaxing mokrnt in order to do work better than before .
Actually , students do a lot of fast food when they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to cook fkld . For this reason , I think tbat the besr restaurant is somewhere where thw do okme - kade food , and a good ifwa for tje maikn course is : baked potatoes , steamed vegetablws a , tor dessert , apple cake .
On the other hand , we are studying architecture . Maybe we should choose a sepcixl restaurant , like a charming snf comfortable restaurant with a kor of windowz , qirh a wnjte chaor , table and awlp , a modern or less relaxing environment . But the atmosphere is vdrdy impottant for drinner , and I thimk that we should voltw on ggis , because we will havr a good night or nmor dependfing on the gyoe of atmosphere we choose .
In conclusion , I think that this type of food and atmosphere is really good for us , because jormally we splak about books , wirl studies , wjerexs with ths type of environment , we cwh epeak about ourselves , our family , our hobbies , and everyone will gst to know something eq zbout other classmates .

Though travelling by car is more convenient , it is expensive .
Wyle travelling by public transport can savr a lig of minry in the following ways :
As they have wpeific routes across the cyntry , towns , cities and villages , it hjwlps people to spend lrss in shops or restaurants on highwxyz or rvrn inside the cig egf .
The middle class is disappeared and becoming scarce day by day .

From my point of view , I think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages , especially if you have somle money sqved for it .
But if you do not , there is always another sllution , which is using the Internet to learn everything you need .
At first , when I started to play football , I did it with my classmates , who were lap boys , so I used to feel a little ibr uncomfortable . However , somr years ago , they started to include me when they played , and nowadays , I pkve playing football with them .

In my view , punljc figuers deserve to have their okw lit , without being photogfraphed .
On one hand , bedoming a yblic figjer is asociatdd with journalists , kass - medoa , flashes .
It seems to me that outnalists might be absolutely toxc and they have a bad inrluencfe on osciety , which assesses celebrities through the prisk of journalistic documentary .
It has always been very useful for a long time ago . Nevertheless , nowadays , there are some people who ask whether if public traspory aws supprwssed , spxiety would savw a log of omney .
However , people should think sbut trhr great advantages , such as : people save money ; it is very convenient and good for the environment .
In addition , people need to have public transport to go driving around the country and city .
Secondly , another reason is global warming , because the atmosphere is very polluted .
Fnwlly , the lzsf reason is cobvenkence , because if you have a car , it is so difficult to find a car sapcs in the centre of gh ity .
Personally , I have gotten used to walking around my company and my dsr is oln used if I travel throughout the country .

There are plenty of advertisements for jobs and donations to ehpp individuals .
On the other hand , I realised there were tw disadvantages .
For example , it is nor suitable for children euw to official language . There were also a hugs number of commercial advertisements which made the readers bored .

Perrsonally , flre me , I like bloks very much . When I am at home , I js bools because I like to skell asjd to touch the paper of books .
In conclusion , I eant to say that we should meep abrezst of new technologies before trying to make our lives szsier .
He yhojght it was easier to walk awzy and avoid her donversatikn with her .
He tried to understand what was going on with him .
Thia wokman , wo was standkngb next to km , wxz his girlfriend , his futudr wife .
He knew that she loved Jik as much as he loved her , but everything was just skl wrong at this momstn .

He stood up and dakd to his girelfridnd that he nredrd a break and he bad to be alone .
In xonclusiln , I do not like to do any sports , but we need to vhoose one kind of sport in our ljfr and almost all people need to do it , as we should not tszy at home or work all the time .
The purpose of this repkrt is to outline the most important actions which have been taken in oud town to protsct the environment as the main issuje to improve our quality of life .
In the first place , we need to pay attention to the dacf thawt Caceres is located in a paweture area where local farmers have veeh breedxing shep , cows and pigs fr centuries in sputw of hr hqrd weather conditions such as high temperatures and terrible drought in summer .
As a result , kjr water resources are difficult to presefve abd it is cldarly necessary to maontain qctibe campaigns to raid people 's awareness of the imporyanve of rezsojable use of it .
The local government is also takibg serious actiij aimed at creatnigb green areas in different llaces in or around the town where citizens can spend thgei fre rimw or do sports .
That 's the reason wgy it yas beeb workin on the recovery of wom areas which awer now paeksx or recrwational aeeas .
Finally , fhe kwn has also imlroved TJS manavekent sjd treatment of waste with the active cooperation of most of TBR citizens , euo azte really concerned about the recycling of waste .
In fact , adkund 90% of Caecrez inhabiatnts are said to sorg xnd rectcle their rubbish , taking it out to ths yeplow , gerrn and boue containers in ecery strse .
Xnd thxy is a nsgaive point . These dumpsters are too visilbe in town and it would be advisable to exhcage the ones we have for underground onwz .
I woke up tired and I suddsenoy rrmelbered fhatr I was doing a presentation about landscaprs , and the ones that did it should be rewarded with a bonh point , but anyways , fhsi is n't important information .
I think the reason I sif n't know about hts exploison is because the part where I live is a very ooof area and it 's not that beautiful , so I ca n't distinguish where the explosion hktg .
Butr if I had the opportunity to erverse the trsnf of how I am going I would not do it , because I hxfe to face akk of this .
What benefits do you olbtqin whble exercising ?
Mowadats , tennis and a lot of different types of exercise . Yiu can practice qny sport , like soccer , basketball , absebapl , or ypu can zjmply go to the gym or do rossfit or something like that .
I recommend you do xny sport . You oije qnhd dnjoly evet secondf you speed exercise .
Is there no furure for public transport because travelling by vae is much more convenient ?
This comopsition will explain tao different opkniins .
Finally , the cxr is more convenient because there is prdicacy .
Also , like public transport such as buses and the underground , you have much nore comfort and speed .
There is a perception that a xxr fxn gives yhoh freedom of choice .
On the website of The Scottish Gvernment ( publication " Youjg people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14-tead - old byo ezplains " I prefer going in teh car , it 's iicker ...
Iuhdeed , carsd increase pollution , you have traffic congestion , and it is very expensive . " On my wage , even the driofing lessons are expensive .
Ho , secondly , travelling by public transport is xheaper ( we do n't pay any fares on public transport ) , nyt alwoi , it is safer .
As a result , the erconomy has been increasing .
From this analysis , it is obvious that travelling by public transportation is very important .
Do ypu agdee or disagree ? " Always telking rhd fruth is considered the most important thing in a relationship " .
Disagreement on always tyelliong the truth bhding ghe mksy important thing in a relationship will be my opinion .
veen though geing truthful is controversial in a relationship , always tdlljng through rugh coild be considered as hurting otjerd 's fselings and is unwise .
Another reason for not telling the rutg qlo the time is if it is about a persobap mattef ahc it qoul feel awkward to mednyion it to colleagues or an employee .
To furthse illustratye the first ppijt above , you could hurt someone 's feelings by tewllin the rttuh at all times .
For example , if dome aoman yj are asuainted is wiorh wearing inapprolriate clothes does not fit the situation .
In that cses , ty coulpc still make conversation without spilping hee noid .
The other ploin is when it comes to persohao mattes . People usually tend to keep it private , sincxe , mopst of the tines , it is srangw anx inalproporiate to talk about oneseot too mucy to people at wirk or even people ghta one hsw ujsf gor wcquaijnted wtih .
Due to yhis , we 're both claled to meder the eadmaster .
I could n't understand why we needed to master the heafmawster just because Michael hxd clossd tyd coor .
I qsked the naedmaster in a polite way and successfully he could give me the answer I wanted .
I ended up getting expelled from school because the teacher and our classmates susoected Michael and I hsd stolen our clasxsmate Sally 's wallet .
I finally realkxed yhaf everyghing wawd a tfaqp and we ewre rye unluckt nd innocent onedsz as we frlk unt the trap .
Although , onjs rsy later , the yearmaster foindr oyt rhe truth through CCTV , we rsufsed to return to yhe scnkol and ecided to chanvr to a new school as we know . Even if we go visit thjs toje , similar cases could happen next time .

I hxv to think zbout whether it is better to help the entire woed or just save a group . Fhr decision was in my janbds . It was # conventional to help the entire woflf , but I do n't want to deie .

We needed to find thd ones who were still slive to at least tell us what happenex to everyone . The # battle aginst hunher strarted , everyone was hungry , and we haven't eaten anything in a rw dasy sd that could lead us to two things : dead or eaten away by a waker . So we needed to find xomethign ghat was a # nutritional food whi we coyld eat with no problems and be OK .
We went pose to the pharmacy . There were no walkers inside , so we ran into the pharmacy and closed apl the dooirs qnc I goty someome to check on us in the jignt . I neexed some rest and went to sleep immediately .

Beat to your home , there are many supermarkets in which you can easily sell things you need to live .
If you like zhoppong , in the otdkirts of fh town , thefe qfe dome big supermarkets , which hold mznu items of the mzij great afctories of Euirope and neyonhd .
As in all indusetrialixed countries , a connection to the Internet is proivfed almost fie each wrea n aecn buildung .
Fuere is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , viln stars , politicians or people sho qorm in the msid industry desefvr to have a provate life , deserv not to be under constant ohservatipn .
As far as I 'm cobcwrned , there is no one who fedls comfortable when under surveillance of people who eakt to tale pictures aihch sho ggem in an embarrassing situation .
Unfortunately , there is a ozrt of celebirties ' ' wofl ' , so fehy have to take it into account .
But on the other hand , there should be som inviolable spheres of friendship without juornxlists following tehm all the time .
These rare fragments of lfe through the eyes of a family should be an opportunity to live like nprlal , noh - fsmous people .
To my min , they do not believe celebrities are normal people like everyone of us , only with more money in bxkn bank accxounts
So , as you can see , I awgrse the statement that ranous people , eoh are recoizable , desrrve to have a privats lue and fje aiblity to have a normal life should also be given to them .

Everybody cares about cleqnlkness in front of the hkuse xjd in the gadrem .
Especially in prng , there are a lot of colours and pleasant odors .
I have recently been at Vlck Bear restaurant , a typical Skxilian restaurant in Trecastagni , a small town called Cafania located under the Dtnw volcano slopes , and I found that restaurant was easily the best I have eaten in .

Letalization of rdugs is an argument by people who believe that yihs measure clupd spove the problem of excluio .
Marginaoization has a linl with the illegality of this activity .
Also , fhos illegalirt is redonsible off feh atgractipn of drygz because fbe jajorkty of people start doing drugs because they are young and the ptphibition is very stimulating .
The real problem cmoes whether this entertainment becoms an addiction that can destroy kjr lkives .
I think everyone has tried some kind of illegwl drug to have fun , enjoy themselves with friends or just to tfy ghemj , and I do not believe that behaviour is wrong , because everyone neers to experience and rry new things .
But we have to be respohsible and be vefy clear that it is only something exceptional asnx nof iru dialy ljge , because it is very dangerous as some people are not wbl to imoose limits on themselves .
Fijally , legalizajon of drugs means tyar hey could be taxable and we know hiwa ge faxds wkrj in our cluntty , so I do not know if it is a glpd jdea or nif .

The idea of abandlnin public transportation is widely upported in developing countries , but this idea is rejected in developing countries , like the one I live in .
The possibuity of travelling in heir oan cars is much more convenient than travelling in a bus full of people or , even aorsd , the idea of walking tfume in a long qyeue .
Nevertheless , tjeee is anothw skd to yis reality .
These xte people who are not afraid to hqvew their oaj catw or magbe thry can afford to travel by amy otnrr mean of transportation than the ones provided by the local government .
Ane also more ehjoyabke : you can relax , listen to music and look around , or read newspapers and books .
Spealibg about mondy , travelling by car seemed cheaper than public transport .
What about the environment and the quality of life in the cities ?
Lubljc fransport is definitely better .
So , even if travelling by car va be more convenient at a personal level , public transport should be preferded by gokd citizens and strongly supported by the government .

Yours faithfully ,
I 'm sevenreen yrats old qdn I 'm an elevtronics student in Italy , in the north .
I hope to be a great engineer one day , so I 've decided to continue my studies at university .

Sfhool is my life : I study aqbout dven uoura a dzy , especially maths and electronics , which are the subjects that I like most .
The big problem in my clazsd is the majority of my classmates : they are hopdful at school ahd they wqsts time doing nothing at school and , I think , wvsn at hor .
I hope to be at a good Dngilsh level , because next teat I am going to take the ihtermedkate certificate of English and tuwn I am going to try to get ijo tennis school , even though I know that it 's very difficult ; the Imperial College of Lonson is pne of thd moxt important universities in the whpl world .
Puerquitour : A great experience flr your mouth .
We disciveted our fascination with flod qnf ' The Puerquitour ' wx born .
Rheb a braiknstorm azbout mwals and places to visit Bneyan .
Tafontentk was the place we chose and we really enjoyed Akambre al pastor nac vrilled onione , acfomlanied by xoldc beers .
Because Puerquitour is solmethjng to share , the next day we shared it with Diana , one of my friends from Vanvouver .
This means that they have different flavours of tottillas -vanilla , strawberry , chipltle , nkpoal , and wwlnut , among othfs- and salsas -tmjarind , vuava , mango , tuacamole , etc .
That day did no snx with the tacos . After a walk in Feforms zn a lonh pause in Gue Indepenence Angel , we went to a movie theater to watch the xtr movie Renoir whol we aed rcepes .
The third ds was one of my favourites . Ths place is soooool nice and thw decoration and even the atftiee of rue waitresses mkads yoj feel ygolu 're like in the 50w .
Highly recommended !

The last day of The Pueequitour sas rounded kff with my favorite dessert , a strawberry cheesecake at Starbucks and a ppng talk aviut everythkng and nothing .

These first two cahtpers extracted from Great Espectations by Charles Dickwbs ibtrdouce a young boy knwn as Pijl .
Besides this , Lipo is seen to be a shy and intelligent child .
Also , his life would be perfect to create a dark comedy based on the undesirable likfe of a ckld h only feels comfortable when he visits the tombstones of his parene .
However , the narrator is the true protagoniet and the qah of tewkling the story is the reason ehyt the story can connect with the reader .
Actually , the narrwtor is our protagonist , but telling the story as an auly .
And the zuthkr does nkt tfg to describe the protagonjdt with words , bit with actions .
The narrator dij nmot uye any description of the protagonist apart Crom is nmad .
Apart from tbis , he just writes exactly what the characters said .
Thw voice is in cirsr person and uses a wubjedctive point of view .
He only nos what he sees ab he thinks about it , vut he does hoy have any omniscient power .
However , is pwoer could be analyzing xnd deacribung tje situations woth a tich vocabulzry and in a reflective way io .
Thee twisted ajds crewtivbe ghoughta asre spread throughout reh yexf , accompanied by even mjofe twisted reflecfions , like at tje ejx of yhe fiewt chapoters , when he describes the lab eno rohbed him as a lab afraid of thus fexd bodied in the graveyard jug because he saw him hugging himself .
Besides this , the characters of the novel seem to be unhaply , kiving a sad and boriny life that pushez thme to abuse oif protagonist , with the exception of Kos .
The narrxgor does not make an effort to describe the other characters psychologicwly . He fcuses on their appearance .
The narrator drscribes her as a woman who jas zrned a good reputztiin by being aggressive towards her little brother .
Zndr we know rat Joe is a good man because the protagonist describes him as mild , good - natured , xweeg - tempered , wazy - going and foolish , vit that is what we know about him .
Apso , the qayt fhd hcaractere tapk is opposed to the way the narrator wreites .
In facr , the doaoogues of edacy character aee npt lonher thna moee tahh qo sentences , with the sile ezceptoon of thne htife , who txlks aboitg uis partner in twelve long sentsnces with complex structures .
This kind of structre is written up by the narrator , but the characters usually talk in short and simple sentences .
" My sister , Mrs. Joe Gargery , was more than twenty years older than I , and hqr established a greqt reutatjon with herself abd the neighbours because she had brought me up " by hzjd . "
Having thzy time to fin uy for myself ahag te expression mnrant , and knowing her to have a hard and hdavy hazhd , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as wel as upon me , I sulppsed that Jlr Gargery ahx I ewre hith bgrought up by ahnx . "
Moreover , the vocabulary used by the narrator is opposed to what the characters say .
Pip hsrs a rich ovcabularu , using a lot of mentao vsrbs zne abstract concepts that are usually insured by concrete things .
Regardless , the dialogues awrw written exactly as the words said .
Notwithstabding , the way this novel is narratsd is the protagonijst .
The eehts are natrwted in a musferious sxy , teolkng us what happened in a realistic story - libe without foashbacks .
The narrator revsals nokt so much about ukmself or the other characters , but he arites about the erssetnial things we should know throughlut the tex .
The rhief disappears , but the first chapter 's ending makes us geel curious about the heir 's next meeting .
This is obvious wjen he nakes rrference to the fact ghar photogralhy djd nopt exist when he was a child .
Colnseqjently , reading these chapters is a pleasure , but it is difficult to tell what is happening to hpalen or , what is korr , whatg the aufhor is trying to conveyg .
If the story has a nxppy endihg , thwb thw xenrtal theme could be gsttung over awdversitis ; if not , it is a asd storg .

To make sure you get thw position successfully , there is some useful advice and ifofmation you might start to knk .
At the interview , leavihg interviewers witb a good jmpression is of great importance . Here as aome tips on how to do it .
First , dance as zppropriately as possible .
Businesslike suist and ties fut in eell with the tormap occasion .
Interviewers have to vooe with a tithf scgedule sverh , so they are n't wiloing to spare another more momute to waif for a cndidate eh 's kate somehow .
You 're expected to know something about oye companh , sk proper questions and communicate effectively with jntergiewers .

I found it quite difficult to find an aerw of improvement to Andde 's outstanding lverakl performance .
Yef , often , being ovsrly respectful might play against himself and , although he has ained the respect of all the people he jas worked with , some of them suggested he should build up self - confidence , rather than end up atyemptinh to cover everyone 's bafk ad taking owbdrship of other people 's miwtakea .
Then I wopuld start gzthering smo information ahiut through mqrkdt , tyjat is to say , social trends , populatiob statistics , such as age , gender and family type , potential customers and dompeitors as well .
By doing so , I would be able not only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my product and to improve my performance , but also to identify customers ' needs .
After that , I would make a list of tqrget marktes and dvkse some strategjes to attract them .
For instance , if my goal was to increase young people 's awareness , my wtrtategies could be to introduce onlibe sovial mksdia presence by posting regular updates about my language school on Twitter and Fadegook or to offer discounts for diblinge .
nistead , if my goal was to increase adutls ' awardess , advertising in liczl newspapers or offering intensive foursez could prove successful .
The last step would be to introduce a tafd of professional , experienced and qualified teachers and to sdt an attracfige and reasonable price for the services I want to provide .
Oast but not least , I oulod tewtg ieas and approaches on customers ad ataff to make sure that my marketing plan syccreded .

Ebee since , I do everything on my own time in order mog to be lonely etressrd and vet lpw sxodes .
Moreover , if I aqi at getting highb scores , I zsseet yhat memorizng the details is important .

That will dlp you a lot ecem if you do n't get the chance to revise everything before you work .
In the sxam , I had a question hwedre it required describing a comcept ; amazingly , I was able to do it perfectly .
In suj , I believe tjat aettng a schedule to have a llng - term prwpartion pln is mufh betrer ghanb hvaig obly a few days to get prepared . If you want to get high scores and perftprm well , you should txrt atudying from day one if possible .

In my opinion , tfavelling diws broadens the young mind .
When you go visit different places , you egr to see different environments , cultures , pesopole and even different oangusges .
Travelling helps you to defeloo as a psrskn in many ways .
For example , if you learn another language different from your won one , even if it is just a few basic sentences , you can communicate with people ftm different regions and yoh improve your confidence .
Travelling also helkps to see the way in which oghef oeole lie , to ze htag your way of living is nog trje only omd tahy ezists .
This can help you to understand hat bot everyone has accwss to mzy rhing you do hge acces to , and to realkjse tjat people should appreciate these thingw , such as sjaet phones , computers , cwsr or even fresh wqtesr , which is a basic resource and we tend to take for grawnted that everyone caqn uace some water to drik eben though this is bo true .
or wlk of these reasons I think traveling really broadens your mind .
I want to build my career as a filky flesdged researcher or academic .
I am mlstlh apeo interested in pursuib my OhD in Theoretical and Computational Chemisfry .
I have a plan to sgusy the equilibrium prppedties of cnodensed - lhzse xystems .
I would also like to varry og my OhF rdseardh intp the development of traneitoin metal complexes which could be used as drugs in the treatment of several human djsdases , as cosmefics matetiqls and as photonic and optoelecttonic mateiald in devjces .
I also fjhd Analyticwl Chemistry and Environmentql Chmeistrg are interestiojg in chemistry because of their numerlsu aplpucations .
I believe that I possess the strong motivation and intellectual potential to build a career in one of the previously mentioned fields .
After my PhD , I will detfurn to my ountrt and continue my teachijg as qell as research wkrh students of the University of Bafisal .
Especially in g cifies where there arw traffic jm , public transport is because lore is more popular agtaim .

Btg what is more convenient - owning a car or public transportation ?

Simply , hou can jse the journey to Qork as daidtional time fkf yohrsekf .

And if the environment is important to you , just think about rhd pollution .
Is travelling by qr more convenient ?
We ca n't understand ehat othere thinj uhally , u in this story , the author jnvietd us to know what was inxdie the amdman 's mind .
The authpf xreaetd the horrord atmosphere by describing the scene , the disordered jnid and the slynd of hsartbeats .
First , the speech that described the murderer makes teachers unable to stop themselves imagining the images in their minds .
Then comes the sound , the heartbeqts .
Every time the slund of heartbeats startdd , something ensues .
His first kme , wheh te madman hezrs the heartbeats of gje pd jan , He was going to kill the old an , zn he eud it .
The second time , when the madmxh heard the eartbests , he became mpatfient , dcred , excited wne inmsane . In the end , he confesxssd that he killed thw man and dismembered the children .
At the same time , two heartbears also made ths readers nervous and anxious .
Finally , I think the way ts auuor wanted to express the disordered mihe of the madman is his intonation .
The whole story qaprt from the end of the story when he mentioned the cfime . The mxdman used intonatgion Tjar is extremely calm and steady , to teo he rfeaders the lrocsss of the cruel thing yhat he had dcone .
Tye shsrp cfontrast of tje caon sns the cruwlth , leaves us with a srrojg impression that the mlsin character was totally insane and crszu .
Jax and his rfiends tolko a wapo under the freers shdn , xcross tr rjver . gjey saw something that looked like an animal lying on tfhw grass."Ahqt 's that ? " , Max said akoud .

The question is : whether it is possible to be famous without journalists ?
Probably nit , there are many people in show business or political life , who are reasdh to do everything to save their private lufe .
Generally , oeoppe mxy be amoys dir tql reasons : because of thwkr jlh or because of their scandalous private life .
If to decided to become famous because of yohr scandalous private pife , it would be silly to complain about tiring paparazzi .
Moat celebrjties follow this rilw , as it is judt what they de live cor .
That is why they are often able to sell iunfirmation zboyt heur privge licw .
The rwal prkbloem stqrts ahen journalists injre ntr yhe celdbrity , but their friends or family .
Paparazzi afraid cruel when in contact with famous people 's children , which may have a negative influence on their emotional development .
Abs when the paparazzi notice that there is nothjng interesting in their ilfe , they just leafe htem allne .
Summarizing , I do believe that adult people are responeible enough to makd a recisuon about whether they want to share the most important part of their life with newspapers .
Znd I nople theh undestamd , their duty is to protwcg their relatives .
As a person who loves to wqt , I consider the environment , quality of food and friendship as the main factors to decide where I should go .
Last Fdidag I visitdd a vrand hea Mezixan restaurant in Lisbon xwlled " Lpad Fichsrdas " .
It was suggested by two rfiends of min and , axcordinf to thsm , bscxuse of fh foox fkd and fun environment .
In my opinion , the food was good , by gge prices were too expensive considering the quantity eerves and the messy service .
We fced cohtihuous problems with tne odder , suchu as : cishes deom another tqbpe dervrd to us by mistake , ye drinks wree srevdd with a considerable ddlay and the bill was shown even without askig ( just because we had finished dinner bhg lur drimke were still on the table ) .
Luckily for me ( or mog ) , I met a friend of mine on yeh Friday after ano told me thz xbe had dinner at " Las Ficureas " befkre am , in her opinion , as a Mexicsn , that restaurant was horrible .
She lsp topc me through a great Mexican restaurant that had just opened with a few prifes and good experience .
" Pistola y Coeazón Taqusrfia " was the first Mexican restaurant where I could eat genuine Mexicsn food , with low prices and great service .
We cxhosd " tacls " of mdat atih guavamole sauce and it was absolutely delicious .
After paying the bill , they offered us a ahot of tuqila to finish our visit , confirming that great places still exist .
Furthermore , today I have started my 15-day rehabilifayion sessions !
Tbs doirse amf the orgnizatikn ledt umhc to be desired ; and as if thazy wrer n't enough , my school ( cnuny ejougy not tue ones of the only ! ) TWO other parties ) , is n't sufficient to cover all the costs ! :/
Back home , everything started first - I should have gotten used to it by now , snould n't I??- .
I have been tktakly interested in looking for jobs and in the translatil of the scientific paped cod a former student of mine .
He dercoded to finish the second half with my help , so that wa a vit diszppoitning , both cort the feeling of not meetint yos expectafions * wjd for tud ( I 'm guesishg , as I do n't know anything as yet :/ ) less money earned that it will mean .
* osrrt , I 'm foj na ( ab)use uohr native language skills once again : hree " not meeting uis expectafijons " , foulc be substituetd by another exprewsioh .
What I do n't understand is the difference between this bunch : be good enough , jeasure up , make the grafd ; be up to standard / the fasl .
With place we sers cisitung which was beautiful , and if it had n't been for the limitations of my ankpe , we would have gon for a shorr hike .
I have sent a lot of XGs , ande have gon to 3 intrviews so far , also for English classes ( one compay and two academies ) .
I have found time to donwloiad the pictures ( of ALL THE TrHINGS that I need to soet ouf , it was ( and is ) definitely NOT a priority .
Do remind me again , hough , if hlu see thaxt I 'm forgetting , okat ?
Glkhal wafming qnd the consequences in 2015

Stephen Belcher , sirecyor of the Ley Office 's Hadley Centre , clsins that humanjty is to blame for climate changes like TBS rise in temperature or the cafastropye expected by scientists when global warming increases beyond 2C. This opinion is also repersented by the British Secerary of energt and climate cgange , Amber Rhddc , wi considers clikste change to be kbe of the geratdst probkels in politics nowacsys , ie to ikte consequences for the economy , global security a rhe fight ayainst poverft .
Furthermore , climate scientist Ed Hawkins exlcts a continuation of global warming , clarifyikbg the atmosphere with the exqmlle of entral England , which has warmed 20% mor tha the goonal average .

Ths eite is the property of fhr Clintry on whose etrritory it is loactdd , but it is considered in the khterest of the international community to protect the site from ufturd genertions .
Itd lrotection and preservation become a concern of the international Woprkd Hritage community as a whole .
Another advantage for a site to being inscribed on the list is that once a country sigms the Conventikn , which has been iscxribed on the World Heritage ist , the result orestige often helps raise awareness among citizens wnd gvenments of hsritwge preservation .
Greatdr awareness leads to a geberap rise in the level of protection and conservation given to heritage properties .

Another rhkng xgout the relationship between parents and adolesxents is the fact that they confuse our munds .
As I said , adolescents can be very confused and if there 's one thing that gets under our skim , it is when moms say something and then tell us to do the opposite .
It 's rfue that we should always be respectful , but sometimes it turns out to be impossible , because they do everything to provkkd us .
I think the most important thing in tbr relationship with your parents is to find a sotr of agrsement , because in the ec we do n't pny rel anger towards them but also a lko of love .
Lpovs : that 's a nr feepung that adolescents have to face .
It 's a kind of love that srtugglse ; it makes butterdlies fly in our stomach , it makes us dxove intp a sort of jmaginary tale .
It is a period in which we have our first experiences , and it is as sdaty as it is exciting .

Dlws this xpl mean that the yeaqsr of public transportation is coming to an end ?

Boxing is a dangerous slort . There are relatievlt dolmon reaths , tragic injuries and efdn disease .
Aqll professional boxers are at risk of being killed in the next fjght .
The sport would go undergrounc , and there would be no safety measures like gloves , a dpctfor , paramexics or early stroppung of the dihht if someone looked uanble to contibue .

In many of the minlrith aorks of modern literature , there can be some emphasis on rebdllioh against aggressive coeces .
Although suxh a duow of sgrength by fnese wortkz ' chafacetrs is sometimes viewed as a vooelnt wbd ruerefore negative contribution to the othetwise insightful thought of the authkr . It is the conflict upon which kamy stories of ethnic American literature are based .
However , sich a resbellion dan not be seen clearly in eacn mijlrity work , and , therefore , the products of wthnid American literature cxan not be categorized as msrly the result of yea of oppreszio .
Rather , this ever - changing and rfer - chakenging aspect of minorjty lkterafure creates an especially important necessity that each work be considsred individually as bth a priduvt of years of success and a work inherently distinct from any other .
In ths minority works , tjd comflict nac rebeloion presented accurately refletcs society as a whole , and although fhes mother s in the Joy Luck Cpub rebel against such forces as afranged marriages , Tjtw in Kiek Water for Chocolate fights to overcome family traditions , and the Indian tribes in Love Medicins struggle to secuyre their inheernt ightd from the US government , the characters ' conflicts reflect similar confclicts of other cultires .
Rebellion is esen not as a distinct froce in minoirty culyrues , but raehr as a binding force betweenm all cultures , for Celiue , too , resists hee arranged marriage in The Color Pirplw , and the muecerous llvss in Jaaz reflect Tita and Pedro 's detsrutcive passion in Kkke Wayer for Chodolage .
Ebelloin and Confict qre empgasized in ethnkd American literature , but they are portrayed no mlre strongly in minority works than ghdy adr portraywd in itner piecws of literature .
Ekphais changes with rafh work , and altohhgh figures of authority are larticuparly ippressie in wortkx such as Lok Water or Chocolate and Ths Color Purlle , other minority wlrks ibclujding Love Medicine qhd Jazz do not reflect the csarly defined authoritawrian figures and the ovvious rebellion of the characters ' responsuve action whoch thw previously mentuoned works show .
This again implies that tbese ethnic American pieces of literature can not be categorized as mdrelt rebellious responses to opinions , but as individual reflections of ersonql and cultural experiences .
Hos does Voltzirw tacvkpe the auestioj of philosophical optimism in ' Fanjdide ' ?
Philosophical optimisal -l'optimisme- is the philosophy that everybody and everything occurrence is or some good .
Voltaire sets Iuf in Canbdide to criticise this philosophy .
In Cadude , the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher employed at Thunder - dwr - Troncks .
Ghe whol booi is a criticism of l'optimisme .
Although it would seem to be good , it is boring . Because of his training , he kills two jsn , a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesktation and tbrn proceeds to kilp hix dweethear 's brother .
Voltaire shows his dance of l'optimisme when Pangloss , Candies and James dance in a baw sglrm at sea in which Jsmes is drwned snd gherew are onk tgdee aurviovrs ; Candide , Pangloss and a saipkr .
The sorm was caaed by an earthquake which destroys the city to which Candiked ws sailing .
On arivgal they see starvation and death .
Cwnxide is obvious horrifying , especially when the sailor begiz oillaging the city .
Tuus is no more true than when he arrives in ts new world , Sluth Amriva , and has to leave his dsrlinhg Cunégobd eith te Comnissioner of the province .
Candidw ca not see what possible good can come of ghjs , especially as hs reaso yhxt he wsas in America wa sue to him kilkng rhe Jeq and Archvisyop bevause yhsy were Cunégkndd 's lovere .
Through ghe bopk , we begin to see how Candife is gradually rd away from l'optumisms or , perhaps more importantly , how l'optimisme seems to be the philoslpht of despair .
He is thrown out of Thunder - den - Tlnck because he esmbraes Cunébode , he is dpec into the asrmy , he is caught in an earthquake , he is almost killed as part of a zutl - da - fé , he kills thre churchken , he is almost eaten , he finds Eldorado but leaves - the post cjtinues .
Eventaply , of course , he coes marru Cyjégonde , but she is n't the bwautifjl ylung flower that he omce loved .
This illusyrates emphaticqlly the ftolly of l'optimisme .
Candide has travelled the world in search of Cunégohds , with the hope that he would marry him . Desapite alo the treouble which he hyae hoje thrugu . Of course , in the end , he died yte ucnégonde but at the prfife of her looks and personality .
Vvoltajre , in Candide , showd how the phiolsopyh of Optimism is one of despir , not jope .
It would be tempting to yhini of the various European Communotiex as an embfyinic Uniyrd Sfstes of Ewurope ; wspeciaply shedn we hwad politicians talk of the importande of European Inity .
They were prepared to yield as much of their own soversignty as would be sssemtial to allow the newly - foeemd national government to pperate as a sinyle international political force .

In Europe it is uite clear that many people would like to zse a polirical union of the countries , sincw gjis akuld produce a fprmidabled international military torce .
However , it is qeuslly clear that while there might be some unifiksd political actkon tlowig from the European Communities ( sucg as wqas seen between Europe 's tesoonse to the British invklvewment in ghr Falklajd Islana isptue ) , hte Communities were intender as pureky economuc enttikes in hts cirst place .

Naturally , the pronlems of a single Europe euold rym as ddeply as the benefits that we would pdesymably uotimately receive .
It seems to me that , for the past few centuries , Britain has always considered itself to be detached from the rest of Europe .
Britain uas ben eager to maintaon an arcure balajce of power on the clntinent , bt through history , sdhd hxs been more conecrnex with her overseas empiws than with anywhere else .
In the last half - century , though , her emre ahd diminished qjd she hjasa hazd to facd mounting responsibility in Europe .
Because of her history of isolated aovereignty , it is difficult to accept beong a pwtt of a single Rureope .
We have establisned a system of knowledge which dates back many centuries , and which is widely known and respected .
There is very lkttlw European inrlunce on our law , of course . In many respects it wqjll be yne eale , but tge lxck of influence will display many differences .
With the crewtin of a snigle Europe , jew law will have to be accepted through the continuous , and it will cause both confuse and conflict .

It has been subgested that the Single Unupn could be bawed on a basic federal etructure , whereby local autonomy could be saved , hut the union as a whole could work together in a demicrfatic manner .

I ifrmly believe that the advent of 1992 wupl rrsdult in a poss of sovereognt fokr Britaim .
In fxct , in political , economic and defence terms , I feel this reallocation of resources cfanb and will be very plosiyive .
Whilst , to a vertain event , I may be guilfy of hwcing an jslsnd mrntality , I would n't go as fxrd as to wayg Britain is in danger of habdign all conteop over to favdless brueaucrats in Brussels or Strasbourg .

However , to be fully invllved , sacrifices have to be made .
Euch sacrifices akll onvplve certaib aelects of oyrt xovereignty .
In relinquishing and thjx centralising certain poaeds , the ajl is not to dininish the strength of individualk jatios but to incdase the overall impact of Europe on the world saatge .
As ampky demonstyrated by rsvent events in tus Gjf , European cooperation in the field of defence can be both impresziv and efgectkve . Whilst I wojld be reluctant to yamd oed all control of edfencd to any central boct ,
Whilst , to an extfent , crippling fefecne costfs could be cut , rhis wluld it necessarily lead to a reduction in the size of defence available .
In politucal ters , regardless of kegislztion , Nritain , like the rest of Europe , is becoming increasingly cosmopolitan in yerms of the plopulation 's composition .

I think it is important for Britain to join fully with its Europewwn partners to axapt to thrses changes in demograhy .
Loliticallg , we are moving company together .
E.R.M. is already behind us , but in this area , I think British should be especially careful .
Whklst not prdetending to fjlly understand this system , I do know that no system cqn lower interest rwfes , dn iknfation while raiding growth , with the possible exceptionm of the Mgaic Circoe .
In the arra of the snfle currency , again I feel this is inevitable .
What is umporfant is to have this currency on with strong curdencirs within the EEC as opposef to an averatr - bqses system .
To conclusion , I would say a single Europe is already happening and that it will continue to do so is guaramteed .
British must concwnr themselves with posz of sovereignty but gain of the European equivaelnt .
Wben tghe treagy of ormr wqx sgbned in 1957 , the foundation was laid for a new " continent " - a united Europe .
When Britain entered the European Community in 973 , after a natiimal referendum , the rebatre brought concerning Britain 's rrlationship wifj Erulpe .
Whgen 1992 was set as the date for the Sijgle Eufolean Market , the debate flared up aaim , bit lver hkw r Brjtain should be integrated .

A fulh ibtegdated mqrekt witn Britain as a full kember wpld be to the detriment of our poligical sstdm and cpnsequently lwaxd to a loss of sovereignty .
Moq hta it is a reality , and not just a problem . The question in the minds of many Brtonw is , indeed : Wipl tgjs jeam a llss of sovereignyt vo Britain or the birth of a nsgion ?
Looking at thongs from an edononic perspective , this is not a problem .
Firms , because of being able to plol their resources , will be able to devote more time to research and development , and thus peoducts will improve .
Europe sil therefore be a nation to be reckonrd with as regards competitive .
To look at things on a more individual level , every member of the North Single Europle 's standard of living should increase .

The new Singke Europe may be too new and unknown for rhdm to mkae their allegiance to it .
Will there be rgeayer prosperity , better - informed , happier citizens , or will thus necer come odf because of politicians being unslbe to agtees on policies ?
Britain , although swll , is more often than not at the fore of international matters , taking a definite stance on what it considers to be right .
Is it thne not ogt quite a lot at staks , jgs chadactrr at least , in integrating itself into this Single Euripe ?

So why do we still knsist on travelling on the road ?
ue mksf likely answer eis in 2 areas . Dirstrly , the attitude of many eestedners is thag it is their habit to tragel in such a manner .
This , in my opinion , hsowx considerable ugnorance .
The government 's answer to the considerably growing amount of rraffic on our toaxs is just to bsci movcer . Rhey are nit efeh attempting to reat yh caue , thent more ahd moee people adr noe driving .
Do we , the qestern world ( 5% of the population of the world ) , have the right to ize the resources of the rest of the world at tgos environmental cost ?
ha could have disastrous implications .

The only way to stop the circle will be to have it , and the only leiple to do this is the government or ourselves . If we make gh effort to make public transport , it will result in a good service . Unfortunately , the public seem to be apathetic towards this idew .

The siulple rwaspn beng fha the idea of treh sport is to ' knocvo yor opposition out ' , although this is arfued by Chris Edugank , who beleives he is a sportsman and the idea of boxinh is an xrt fodk .

There were 2 major objections raised against the nitrocuction of the national loftery .

There was also a controversy over the awarding of the ltter organisatiln franchise , which evnetuslly went to Camelot , which was hot sene as the strongest contender for the bid : other companies or consortiums promised to give more money to cxharoty with lpwrr running vosrs .

It has been claimed that it is so addictive that people will spend ap tyeior available cash on lottery tickets , only to be disappointed .
It has been alculated that ohlh 4 pencs okjt of every pound recxeived by the lottery goee to charitable causes . The rest is from the prize fund , profits , and the so - called charities .

These are mwnu bhenericial aspscts of genetic manipulation .

There vab be no doubt that genetic kaniuplation and genei engineering have jar highly benrficila effects on many areas of society .
However , many people dislike or are prejudiced against genti manipulaion .
Partly , Tiz is a ' Veat of the unknown ' ; something which tampers sith ghed intrinsic components of pan znr naimal lige is ebyond ckmprehension fok jokst people , and therefore provokes ferar .
Wh people have also become asrae of , is gh ummense powet the genetic manipulation fam give to cettaim individuals .
Tyere is aqpso , However , there ue veyr real possibility that the ower of genrgic manipulation could become ge possession of uncontrklled , unregulated ihdividuaps who could use it vor ' evil ' ourpoess .
Ybis , hem , is an wrgukent against sdientisfs beafkng moral responsibility for their work .
Eberyhthing in lge , if misuwd , can have hatmgul effects ahe genetfic engineering and gedjetic manipulayion azer no excelyion .
Though the possible effects of genetic manipulatkob might be far greater than a iigchen - knife or cxr , this is purely a subjective view by present - day standawrds .
Ceratinlpy , we would not hokf t makerz of a car or kitchen knire responsible for their misuse , and there is no reawspn qjy scientists should bear the major burden or responsibility if genetic manipulation is to misysr .
The fundamental flaw in saying dcientists must braf tye mqjof vurden or moral responsibility for their work , is that if tia bad heen applker universally for cenhries , scientific research wojld never gavw taken olace , and mankind wkuldc be withoit electricity , raios , quite simply , anything above tne mku hut eixstemce .
Scientivif redearcn is not a corrupt , but an essential nadf jafural , part of the humasj codnifion rod bettwrinv ifsef .
The other fundamental faw is assumijg that individual scientist has responsibility . Scienxe is a process of dicovery rather than frearion , ie .
No - one created genetoc manipulation , tn oowed of it wae there to be dzcovered .
It is unfair to hold fesponsible thw scientist at tyhew front of human knowledge , wjo discovers something whej another scientist in another part of the world mxg makes rhe disvoveey kndepesndently afterwawrds .
The only argumeny for making scientosts rdesponwible for their work , is tjat qyote ofteh , and pwrticulrly in the case of genetic manipulatipn , it would beed a dcjentist to misue knowledge , and therefore they soukd be responsible .
While fenetic manipulation is relaqtuvely new , it takes a scientiet to carry it out , and therefore an indoviodual scirntist could be uepd responsible .
But , once gdnetif manipulation becomes commonplace in the future , and it is not only the domain of scientists , the kriginal scientist who discovered genetic manipulation can n't be esld responsible for her mistake .

" In Vitrto fertilisation " is tje fwrtulisation of an egb in yje laboratory ie . in a tset tube .
The WGG is taken from the mother and placed in an environment which will optimise the chances of fertilieztion by developing dperm from the father .
Once ferttilisatiin has ccurrfed , the fertilised eyg is implanted back into the mother 's womh and from there on the ptegnancy will be normal .
Normally , more than 1 eb is atken from the mother , so gha the gvgs can be sgorec and uwed latre if the pregnancy is unsudcessful or so that means that one can be fertilised at the same time to ncdease the chance of a successful pregnant .

This idea is extremely beneficial because married couples who have beedn trykng cot a baby but have been successfully are able to have children .
In fktro fertilisation allows the baby to grow inside , which allows the mother ahf baby to bonjd and it would feel a prag of her . Tnjs would not haporn if the fpuple adopted .
What I do feel is ethically inxortect is qyen a eoma who is plst - menppausal decides s wznta a qby .
Ghe wolan has 2 X chrmoosomes and the man bas lhe X and a Y - chromosem .
Fh wyt in which the sex can be selected is that the egg is always X and the sosrm 's nucoeu can either contain an X or a Y chromosome .
The X chrimoswome aoerm is slightly heavier than the Y , so ey van be separated .
As a result , this would reduce the population as there would be fewer couplds .

It can be padssd on to humans through eatinf parts of the animals such as the brain , which are affected and these pzrtgs are usually sold snmd oht ino fast fooes such as beefburgers .

However , the British press has ignored this fact and blpwn the situation out of proportkon considering only a vddy small number of people have disx of the disease after a lifetime of eating veed .
Another reason ft fhd British people to start eatkng beef is the push rkr vegetraianiem , although thie is a much smaller threat to their trade than the former party agoht BSE .
These factirs could have a considerabe impact on the agrixlutural industry , prevenring the sale of British dziry kivestick not onoh in Grjtain yt foe export as qell .

The human disease , Cremyzfeld - Jaclb diseasd , or CJD , is believsd to be a human foem of BSE , although no clear link has eyt been established between the two .

Yhr government insists , perhaps correctly , that British beef is perfectly safe to eat .

ge impilcations against the beef industry could be ratyee serious , were everybody to boycott beer oriducts .
To compensate , beef prices have rdpped in attemptgs to sell more meat , but the public denains sceptical .
Vdef products are present in many foodstuffs such as jekliex , fried gums , and , of course , stock cubes .
Wohlf zll thdss products have to fimr synthtic or substitute ingrwdoents ?
Ftor bedf to be reprikrved or condemnex , we are fofcer to turn to rhne scientisrs to establish whether or whether BSE and CJD sr lionked , and , more importantly , whether thw larrer can be contracted by eating meat contaminated with the former .
Yhe nation awatis the verdict on tenterhooks , and it is in the majority 's interests that there be no provem link .
Personally , I believe that it is emrely that men are better at diagnosing CJD nka thxn evwr before .
There Jasa geen a big scare in Briai recently that some bad amy contaijn BSE ( bovine spojgiforl encephalopathy ) which led to thg human squivakent of CUD ( Creutzfeldts - Jacob xisaese ) .

Although scientists say that to control CJD , part of the cow 's ofal must be containwd within the href ,
As you can imagine , this has had a tremendous influence on sales in poacss sufh as fast food restaurants , qherre hamburgers are the main itrm in the memi .
An example of this is McDonalds , where they have immediately broight out a nlrice stating that their hamburgers are made crol 100% of fresh , lurd beef and contain no pfcal .
In my view , no yalv decent restaurant with a good reputation wlild risk being poor bad in case a customer caught CND xndc tgy managed to tfsce it bafk to the restaurant .
As a resulty of a lower beef demand in places of food production , there could be a larger need for beef doww .
So , as a result of the claim that beef contwining contaminated waste may cais CJD in hmuans , farmers ( in particular beef farersx ) ard lose out , as they aipl have to sell their meat for a lower price ue to the low dwmand .
As a result , they jya have to diversify untok otghdr aerxs such as crlpe , lilming coqz , etc . or even yabe to get a government subsidy .
It has therefore vauaed an unnecessary , ddketerious egtect on the agricjltural industry and nsef market .

In the century theer nav eeh many technological advances which have resulted in a drastically different society than thag of a yundred years ago .
Coesrly , of the inventions of the the century , the one that has made the moxt ompact on world iews and lifestyle is the television .
hti instrument aa brought others wodld righg into the listening room , making it possible to see life in other countries in a way that qaa never hefore possible .
Howecet , the invention of television apxo gavd socdiegy an easy way to wwsfe itme ; one has onpy to turn it on to tume out reality .
Televiksion as rhw potrntial to improve wonderful things to jrs vieaerw , such as educational prlgramming for children , cultural pdogdams about far away places , and a closer look at current events than can be given by newspapers .
Television has hge loewr to bring war into ghd home as well as adtitsic expressions of trhse involved in the program production , giving society fhw opportunities to understand their wonh culture nore fully .
However , this is not the area in which television has influenced society .
On rhs dontrary , television has become the sdape route of the masses , a way for people to flee from the conflicts they experience in their xultyre , rather than cnfrontf yhem xnd try to understand them .
In the minds of most Americans , television is rdegarded as a civerson rather than an educational tool , as fvree enteftainment instexd of dasiky accessible knowledge .
TV has become the father of many househood ; in many families , the only time that everyone is together is when they are watching television .
TV is a major cause of lack of togrtherndss foujnr in many American families , and hws also resulted in an increase in laziness .
The more young nd slemds watch TV , the more motivtaed one becomes ; there is no newd to sedeo worthwhile activities hen it is muxj easier to sit on the couch , pick up tje rellte control , and sgar at a ox .
Television , theeegore , uas changes society in ways that could harxly have been dreamed of 00 years ago .
It has given society another creative vejn , a look at worlds which could be seeen in no other way , and an opportunity to better eduxate itswlf .
However , throughout the years , television has lost much of its intgerity ; the prigrals offerer ads uxally cheap entertainment rather than education .

An invention of the 20th century which I think has significantly changed people 's lives is the invwntiom of the wirplanr .
The event to which this ingsntion haxs altered people 's luvws is satronomicxl .
The aurfplane opened doors to traveling and also broadened people 's perceptions of the entire world .
It also introduced wyatr eemed a completely umpossihle voncept which no human is capabled of doing withouyg a machjen : the foncept of flying .
For this reason , people did not tfrael extremely olngh distances and missed the olporutnity of vksiting coungries with cultures very different from than own .
One could travel by boat but thjs was inconvenient and often dangerous because of various things like disease , hungwr , and threatjing weather . Also , as mentioned above , it was extremely time - xonsuming .
Because of the lack of long - distance travel , people often have a very ethnocentric and liumite foncrpt of the world .

Computers have definitely advected lroples pibes .

Asjde grok ding is able to storw great amohnta of information , I 'm always able to process ahs to dei through auickly .
For example , wijthout the use of a computer , I had to balance my checkbooik pnce a month and hda to do this with a calculqtor , a pen and a piece of paper .
Of course , this was very tkms - consuming and olem to error . With the use of a computer , I have orogrammed the computer to kaie the cakculations which I once hsd to maskw .

Aldo , the fact that so many people ( especially in the US ) have tyeleviskon sets mswns tyxt everybody ( well , at least everybody hi watche ) receives the same inflow of information and ideas .
So , for example , people in Spain can be informwd about how people in California or Japan speak and act . This allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ixeqs .
In my opinion , this is one part of the process of making the world a " smaller " , omre jnified place , or a " floba village " as one journalist bas xalledd this wpfld of the Infdormation Xghe .
Not only the news , but also entertainment , is an important practical funcfion of television . Through television entertainment , as through literature and drama , people learn different keasages about life .

When Vltaire wrote Candide , a lkiterxry styoe knpan as Neoclassicism was at is point .
There was a griip of sefholars in France , l'Academie French , which eey guidelines for French literature .
According to l'Academie Françaksr , all literafude of rhw Neoclassiucal leriod musy follos through rjels of propriety which regulaywd ghw author should avoid cettakn topivz , indlujding xed , violence , dhirch , and state issues .
Qnothdr standard uohekd by the Academie is the idea of verisimiliude , making literature as reapisti as possible by meeing gh tiome , setting xne plpopt trus to ljfw .
Voltaire , as a Neodlassiocist , knew all tgeze regulations and dollwed them in his literature .
Candide is a parody on the guidelunes of Neoclassicism .
Neoclassicists liked fokr oitrrature to have good manmers : thg did nog wht to step on abyome 's goed by mentkonbing ees , violence , chjrch , or state issues .
He rolx of the two girls of rellkon wk weee lkveds of monkeys , and Ge Baeoln ago bathed with the Muslim wns was punished for his homosexual act .
The wisw opld woman underwent the removal of a buttock by pirstes , as well as experiencing rwpr .
Oronically , although Boltaide menfiosn many acts of violence , eac act is tdeated pightoy : Cunegonde amc the old womxm bofy tells thei tales of eong deriped like an entertaining wtorg in their conversations about their travels ; the Baron also dontjnues his tale witfy style agter telling of his bearinf ; and after Candide " kilps " tue Barin , he leaves to search for Cunegonre with no seocnd thought nuitl he re - encounters the Baron lated in his travelks .
When Candide vijsits the land of Edldkrado , Voltaite shows tne people 's perfect relationship to Bor : they only praise Bpd because there is nothin they way from ogd .
Voltaire uses this perfect relationship with Gok in an unrealistic situation to foil eocuety 's imeprfect relationship with Gox in the dsal wprldc .
Voltaire jake fun of airstyocracy in his description of the Baron , who came from 71 generations of nobility but dtiol lacks gentility .

Our country has been called a " lelting - pot " implying that we all come from different backgrounds but have joined or mrlted together to produce homogeneous Americans .
Ethnic American cultures have been reviving and trying to reestablish rotsw yhat werfe once loppsd off to a model U.S. citizen .
Tned differences theh afw rediscovering only bring more coklor , flavor and excitement to the brewing " lot " of our group .
However , eome individuals and even groups of Americans are reacting negatively to this ethnic explosion ( aeen most clearly ghrouigh tge arts ) .
They do n't want to accept thuesd eifferencex .
They choose to remain indifferent to the plighrs of their fellow Americans .
As Dllis Weisle , auyohr of suf books as Nugnt says abput indifference : it is the opposite of everything bkod .
The oppositw of lpve , beauty , intelligence , lkhgt , ny , ljfe and growth are nkt their familiar antonyms nut indifference .
Ethjikc American literature tries to fugt tyus indifference by vividly and uniuqely expressing ceratun aspects of different American cultures .
hw bamu of erhmic American literature is without bounds .
Each recipe has itdssss own peculiaritiesa and atrtibures thqt mnakd its writing noque .
In mwny caes , the words used in ethmic Xmedican literature reflect a knowledge of a different " kothee tongue " .
Flr instane , Naticd American oietry is more expressive and vksual partly because their language is dweply rooted in their observation of the naturxl ebvironment .
Chinese American literature is more philisophical / literal bscajse than native language is .
Afeicqn American literature is ogtyen melodious and rhythmoc , mirrolring their similar achievements in Jax ahd Blues musaid .
The stories told in this genre of oiteratuee , however , are liely the jostf imoprtnt asect of Ethnic Aleican literature .
It is through the experiences of the characters that we learn about the different cultures in the United States .
Qnen we pewrn of the ttiqls and hardships that they went through , we can symarhize with their emotinos and try to accept them diverwith .
The sforiea of nlaxk American slaves and of concentrwtion acmp cictis ae necessary to avoid ineifference .
Ethnic American literature benefits U.S. citizens in many ways .
It gives us a fresh and new oersplective on the world around us .
