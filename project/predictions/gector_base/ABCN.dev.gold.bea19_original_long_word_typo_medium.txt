I consider ghat is more convenient to dive a czt because you vrry on mirs things in your olwn csd than travelling by car .
In my experience , when I did n't have a car , I used to use the bus to go to school and go afk to my house .
In my opinion , thes cdad is n't necessary when you ave cdzshed in tne srewt . At that moment you realize the importajce of a public tanslort .
Fependkng on the diswtanfe smd duration to fhs deiref place , mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
Gut Geneeakly speakumg , travelling by car is much lore fun even compared with other modsed of transport .
Since , we have the option to wait anytime we want to watch we travel by csr ( which is impossible wheb travelling by train & Ftlight ) .
In addition to that , we can also take a comfortable short nap on the back seat and wake up fresh .
Die to trhd anvoe mkentiined reasons , I am going to conckuxe that travelling by car is much more convenient .
I love children , and I enjoy looking aftwe tgem . wlwo , I organized many sports activities vefroe in my school .
My favourite sport is volleyball because I love playing with my friends .
Vklldyball is a sport played every place . wsn I travel on the beach , I like playing with my eister on the eznd and after we wre go to the aez .

Fro exzmlle , I think that it is hpt affordable for an ordinary lrson to own a private airplaje travel to another country .
I think that public transport in France is going to continue to be used because there are a kor of people fhaf do n't have enough money to pay for a cwr svrn if it is used , so public transport vontinue to have a future , but people are going to use moer the cfarx yyen bus or undergronf .
If we think about it , the caf is bfter because we do n't mred to wait for them has we wait for the bus or underground nht in other sa fad csut more than fham than public transport .
With xqr we can just stay with ourselves wgich vah be good because we cam pistn to thw ueic fhqt we like and we do n't need to be around prople that ade ynkwomed bjr if we cholse blic transport we can medt firebds or damipy so both trasnportatjone xrfe good amd the cars do n't need necessarozly to wnd up with the public transport .
If I had to choose between both trsnsportatijon I think I probably chosee fzr because it is better for me to go by car than to go by nus .
In my community , we are very interested in the environment and economics .

TJ technology yave cfhznched oeoplr 's lives very much.in fact , we na tyinl hiq different oyf life resect either to our parents or our grandparents ' lives . example , my parents did n't watch TV , because there sas n't amy tv in the world wurn they were yoyng.but it is n't tghd alone difference : we acn think at thes lobilefone , the computer ed at least te interneg.our gfandparehts wsouhdn't miafine a strwnge machin lijoe computer in their lkfe .
Nowadays , people use fosdil tuel as the most important source of energy for travelling , manufacturing . hks souhrde of energy does n't always jaintain at fhd constanf lervfel , but someday it will be runh out .
People must fihe wqaysz to ye oyhrr energy sources , like nuclear electricity , winx power , electric transportation such as electric jetro use this kjd of energ .
As a result , governments will invrdt more in researching the usage of these new methods of energy . Travelling using public transport will bcole much xheaper than pesrsonal cf .
Ghe raxngw of lublic servkces will be expandde to remote areas , it becomr mich korw fonvenuent .
Commuting , travelling using public services will be the first prtipr choice .
In addition , the population is increasing rapidly . In the near future , almost every cjtie in the world will become overcrowded . It will lead to many ktjer problems to be sokvrd , for example , traffic jssm , air pollution .
In woms perespectives , these problems are led by ghw oivrr - use of personal vehicles .
People will realise that using their own xzr is just to wasts their tkme rot traffic jams or to gradually kioking themselves fod breathing polluted air .
So the best way for them to travel is through public transportation .
In conclusion , investments in developing public transport ailpl be increased considerably , public serfvicex of travelling have a bright potential and its sztance in the rutyre ca n't be replaveble

In conclusion , it is evident that because developing countries are facing political and economic instability , migrnats travel for better educational porspects and stfaboe environment for younger beneration to riw up .
The effects of brain dewin are that it creates a shortage of people qualified for professional jobs , economic stability is affected as a result of lack of people contributing to the environment .
The cause of Brai - dain shkupd be tacolped at international and national level on a broader dimensions and rationw pattern , for it is a global issue .
In this situation , developing nations should take control of ibflation ; focus on boosting the infrastrucude and the environment to improve puyblic in a positive mabner .

In my opinion , television da be edsucztional . Whetrr oy at watchuny the ndws or a sylw aboit Wirld Wzf en .
Of course , it 's important to choose the right television sohas .
If you 're watching Rkm & Jerru , it hardly has any educational value .
A friend of mine recently explained that if a zombied apokalyspe houl happen he eoulr be prepared because he bas bden watchohg Wakijg ea for some time - so in his eyes , he learned how ( not ) to act in fhwt fade .

In the past few years , vorehsic biology has developed nany aslects kije better sensiiblity , rohustnesd of resuots and less kme fequored for analysis of a sample , but what struck me most is how fast trhiz dgange happens .
Relevision seems to be a controversial golo .
Hre there is one : does television offer highly likely opportunities for the audience in an edufational way ?
of my experience knowledge , I believe television covers both entertaining and educaztkonal functions .
It hites how mabu educational programmes broaden young children 's horizons in the pwt feq years , how quicly an wdult lafn different asicx from a great deal number of educational programs , such as cooking , science and echnoloyg .
It also notes eductionql programmes jake a decjison on how cotizenw should know in the fuutfe and what knowledge our next geherations xrr requite to possess .
Apart from sduational contents , there are so many fiul contefs , business advertisements and fake information on TV that citizens wo n't be able to control fight from work .
However , I believe the educational programs on TV still play a vital role in educating boprh sdhlts and young children .

Xurrentky , most people are used to using their own car to getr to work or to go shopping , due to , it is more comfortable .
But cars pllute ths zif with CO2 emissiins every dsyu and contribjte to the kimate vhznge .
Whereas in a public traneoort , you ojlyh have to pay for the ticket , you do n't have to drive aznd if td bus or train or whatever ehicle you use , breacks xoan it is n't your responsibility .
In conclusion , I think public transport jas future , and the more people yse it , the more future we will have .

I think aboiy transport that the government has to help the public transport , for example , buses , trains , metro and mrfe , for the ly oje reasonm : the quality of lfis against pollution .
Travelling by dqr is more convenient in a lot of situations , but it could be annoying for seasrcg arking qne fot xoat of thel , and also maintenance costs .

Swim is a relaxing exercise for me qnd normally there are n't many people in the pool . But sometimes people are chiodfen and I do n't like it so much because they like disturbing me , but sometimes it is an amazing thing .

My name is Fouad nae I 'd like to talk about my favorite sport . Volleyball is one of the most beautiful sports . md . I have used to practise this zpprt 3 times a week since 1980 . The reasons for my enjoyment of the eporet are as follows :
As citizens of a village , we totllu care about the environment of our village .
Every Sunday , we do a mutual cooporation wheer anyoje dam treats tubbiah as good as they treat themselves .
Wat we believe as Muslimw tah , we hacw cvfeated by one qjo do n't hzev other with him the ond hw ceate oluf father ( Adam ) and created frkm him ( Eve ) and they were in Paradise and instructed to not rqt ftom the trtee vut the Staj edceijve tel so they brought to this life ax generations damle from trhrm and had srn yne prophet sbd keasengers ( Mosea , Jesus , Mohamed , others .. wno they worship the swme kned ) wifh Miracles abs evidnce of the grutj , to guke the people to kbw who wbl wiklk fllpow rhd tdut which will guide to thj araeise and who vollow lther paghs whicu it wlil guide to the hell . so becase of that we are here to do the test in fhis snory life .
Transporetatuon is the hyear of any city , whether it is public or private .

sefomdly tjede mode of transportation covers
As much as possible of city area or gon which mismanaged routine whgo travelling by public transport a consquenfe generally , people avoid travelling by public transportation fibzlly I vam swy that there are various modes of transportation available .
to competition with public transportation .
Nowadays , people have numerous options to travel with a private company .
which is an important reason to giv tglugh comoetiyion to the government . As a result of this , customers get joire benefit from lower faife , privacy , freedom and wxfe travelling.in addition , many automobile companies launcing nr cze wkrh affordable prices which insiost pepple to se moe ajd more privqts vechuler .
Maybe some people are very rude and their dogs are aggressive to other dogs .
Fsmilu is the most important instituti of sockal life .

Usually there arr eneratyion progleme , spns do n't understand parents zne vicefersa , but dialoging about listening to emoyoons and tscts , rveryone dzn hzfe another point of view .
A nother or a father can be a friend if there is communication and grust , if someone gives him contributer in family dutes .
If you want to see that mkvue , you have to watch ghd friet 3 movies bedote to understand it .
I do n't think that this movie is fot wlo the novels , because it is hard for little kids to understand , in my opinion , I think it is more a TDSN novie .
Apart from that , Larate 's not just a sport , it is zlsi a disciloine . It teaches you respect , balance even cultures .
for someone wno sgatrs Kardage is rays to follow the class , so my advice is yst not to hetg nervous and to be confused about what he or he is doing .
Technology is something that is very important , something aitohut which we can not live .
Tdayu topic is technology .
Nowadays , we use technology in every yhinb , from education to nakinv clothes . We use technology every and everywhere .
Technology is always upradihg and it is very heloful , useful and important for development , but today 's generation is influrnced by technology that they have stopped doing other activities .
Lasg uewr , My friend Kicgael was at school when he heard about a shlft story fompetfition . He liked the iceas so he decided to enter the competition .
but there was a fee in order to enter the competition . He had no money . Fortunately , he had a lot of friends who could lend support .
He phoned me and asked me to leny ym somd noney to register for the competition .
He took the money yne secons day , he found the registfraton and sfqrted in writing rhe siry aftr long time spebding in writing and did goe npb he went to give his setory to the international studeng magazine offive . He found pht there was a notice on he door sg that tge competition has cahceled , he cae back ey sad and rokd me what hapehed .Muchal closed the ood and knew at that momeht he had a miztaek .
Ttavellkng by vard is n't so mor convenient unless it is so much more comfortable , but actually we do n't think about the fontaminatiob on our planet .
ravellong by bus is very etressufl because the pelplw plush me or I ca n't sit down because there are n't abg chxid for me .
Another transport public is tye taxi like dsr . It is so much more comfortable , but it is lore expensive than HUS or tfrain .
In conclusion , in the future we should have a bus so we comfortable .
The vandalisme in pagras hyqs increased a lot .

Woolypools is a speciapkist of meals . It 's a mwl restaurant .
In my opinion , this restaurant can be befter , tdspect to meat , but it is perfect for having dinner with houir friends .
Ge problemj of the restaurant is Tyhye pkaxce . It is fvar from the pewope and cities , nds the soace , that is very smalk with lots of people .

Accordijg to the problems above mentioned , various paproaches tuat governmentshould be adopted to deal with this probvlsm.dirts of qol , reeducing buildings cvknstructure from now on , planting noire greee inbsteqd .

It is commonly - debated that tourism has greatly influenced , no olh the aspects of one country , but of the whole world apohg .
Alongside with iw development , the zbilty of travalling haa saened to suxh a scale yhaf it is niw quite comln to conmute frk ne coingry to anthsr .
The existence of multknaiinals is tightly connected to the kea of tourism , as wekl as with the idea of globalisation , since a traellerd is mkt lnky a citizen of his own country through a global citizen .
Secondly , trojrism , esleciallg in developled countries , played an important part in gheit growing from an economic point of view .
If tourism nifluences ghe dconmu , it threny affects the environment , and if it influences the environment it onfluejces yhe transport . People become more craeufl at their hixtordal sitr , yhsi way preserfiong yhel;Tfansplrt is ddveloled bof at a smxkl and a large scawpe :

The first reason is it speesd , compared to both other means of transportation , it can travel faster .

In conclusion , I would say this plan will be my first choice in all of three means of transporration .

There are many discussions about the fuude of public transport .
People like to have the freedom to move comfortably and for this reason , simd people usually lrefre to use tgeit carx .
Oublikc yrqnsport usually restrected with the timetables and you only mwyg use the transport at the moment fhat the timetable lets you .
Because For this reason , many people do n't like to use public transport because they want to move themselves when they need .
On the other hand , public support is good for the environment , because fje pollution is less than uismg our own cwr .
Finally , in the future , the commodity of people 's msye is going to determinate the nostf use of ghe cars than public transport .

In addition there are , for example , the publicist 's work , the companies ' investments , future szlesx , products or ssrvicd 's oif ...
To sum up , there are a lot of adds in TV but they are necessary and beneficial for everyone .

After thd Jnterndt was invented znd reveaped first tkme on Qugus 2th 1969 , Social Media Sajte ( SMD ) is the next mody significant inbovaiton that hbas partp replaced FK fav to face communication .
SMS sucb as Facebook sen ohr 700.000 messages , and 170.000 Tweetz are published on Twitter every 60 seconds .
Unsurprisinlgy , the social consdqyences of Facebook and Fwitter plays an imlorrant role in communication , regardless of distance or time .
However , people who use Fafenook , Twitter or SJX in venerla , xre not likeoy to have their own personal privacy that therd is a possobilityh of cgcle of bullying .
Tbis wseay will force on benrfikts and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitter , and also comments potwntail future of thewse implications .
Communicating cab be achieved , regardless of distqnce , through Facedboik and Twitter .
The benefits of being from being connected globally to Taecbook and Twitfer is rhxt messages can be transnktted almost isntantlpy to the Internet .
Firstly , Facebook and Twitgtsr can be used wh tneir users rae in an unpleasant moipd , and in wheee tbejr negative feelings are expressxed .
Secondly , Facdbooi privide the opportunity to remain in toich eoth daily activities from friends , maoig observations of relationships , maibtainong ine 's own feelings within the work ( through eall posts , ppkes , mdsdages , fc ) ( Pldmeadow , Quinn , & Kowert , 2013 ) .
That is to say , hujan behaviour on Facebook is imtdracted we wyh othres by xharing their mood , and receiving responses .
Thifdly , Fsdebook could be used as an organiztaional communication toolo in business .

However , due to tbis , people who are being followed , or users in genedxl , may have less personal privacy , qnd laso there is a ihgh potsntual of being purposely aggressive towards someone .
However , information which appears on acebook or Twitter is dasipy adcessiboe , therefore everybody can easily rewponee as a pubkix opinion .
However , information which appears on Facebook or Twitter is easy cacessibld , therefore everybody can easily respond to public opinion .
In DSCT , along with agreeable and pleasant cfomlents , there are also small numbers of aggressive and even racist commenf .
Gecauee of thr access information through WMS , has lef to maqn problems involved with cycle - bullying , ccyle - badgering , chcoe - stalking behaviour ( Krishna , as citd in Williams & erten , 2008 ) .
For example , Kriehna et al.(2013 ) reports an awe of continuous disturbing a qiman frol a man cwlled Mr .
X " amdittex to a state psychiatric hospital after being found not competent to stznd tfal on chaqrges of stalking harqssmetn , trespsssing nd teoephone harzssment " ( pp .
Potentially , Facebook wne Tiwter , and SMS in general , might replace face - to face communication and improve their functions , because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without having to view each other wppearacnes .
The positive putcomes might be the more time people spend on SeJS , the lsws clmmunicatw skills that they have .
For example , conrolilng what poktss should be xemt by addibg more privscy optkons .
However , despite the useful of yhesd imploications , people shojlc pay attention to Facbook and Fwitfer could atfrct their society oie by avoiding using it moxt of the ime .
In conclusion , the benefits from using Fcebolk and Twitter is that people can communicate and be connected to their friends frequently .
Also , people can easily reduce their newhative miid by sharing wnx sxpressiny how they feel .
In contrast , befaude Facebook zjd Twitted hvd bwe connected worlaide , which means protecting personal privacy is probably impossible .
Possibly , usdrs might expreds aggressive toward each other , because of lack of privscy .

As far as I 'm concerned , public transport is the best transport means for environmental care .
In pite of dkme pdolle makje enough money to buy their own car , electric wnx hgbtid cars are more expensive than traditional ohes ( the ines always use gaws or diesel ) so , ooeple choose thia ones and that 's bedauss poolution is sesvewral iesud thna we uve to deal with .
The environmental czrw is takiing strength every day , from kids going to ancient people .
Rje government and many companies rar measuring the CL emissions which are being produced by industrial or service processes which are necessary for produhcing goods for the social cause .
If people do n't use public transportation , they could walk , rked a bicycle or buy a traditional acr , md that will probably take place when the destiny is frar from the place where oyu live .
From my piunt of vkdw , public transport is very important in yhe ruturr , especially in developing countries .
I thunk gbe government wjlp skpw doan tje fee in public transportation , tyhgat cuole make people to use public transport and care about the environment feok CO2 emissions and pfevenr the global heating .
In Cpdlada Cigt Council , people are selk informed about making the environment .

Nevertheless , it is never wrong , because Dob 's owners that they have most of the nlmae .
The mosy important thing in the environment is the education of children .
Moreover , we run an organization which pays people who bring us the equipment to decycke .

But sivh high level of development of Sygptian civilization hzs the jegxtive side as weop as positive .

Yours faithfully ,
In the modern world , many people suffer from stress that spring feok lofe conditions .
In addition to this , people work in very stfesful workplaces and they want to lewve fro their conditions in holidaus .
In this respect , many people preged to go to natural places with their fwmilies in order to forgef wbout bd xituations on their loves .
For example , walking in the seaside or swimming in the Rye sea can help to forget ahrd life vonditions .
On the one hand , hpljdays wfe the best fkd people in terms of thinking clearly about their experiences without lfi .
For instance , in a stressful life cojditions people cq make bad decisions ford their future .
Besides , people underestimate wmotionaxl fewlings in thei workplxcesx .
In conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people in order to heal their proglrms and streesful lifs condritinos .
However , the government snd the locak cuncils of bj cktiews such as Madrid or Valencia , are trying their best to promote tbis movement because they consider it a means of development .
Furthermore , it tjrna ur to be the quickest method of yranspodt .
Statistically , cycling is genefaoly considrred to be more dangerous than travelling by car .
Another disadvantage is the weather .
From my point of view , Cycliny contributes to improving commumoty spirg amf it is possible to look fcod sllutiopns to fade the disadvantages of hia activity .
No one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .
And tjis undesirwble time might be nit so short during holidays , sue to lex frequent schedule .
When the bus is corwded , we have to stand , making us morew exhausted , especially for a lon dfjstance .
Evcen tyough cars could prvoide us with so many advantages jenfioned above , the advantages of travelling by public transport should nt be neylecfed .
First , public transport is good for the environment compared to private cars .
As we ll mmow , fhd more public transport lasseners use , less car exyausts are emitted per person .
In other words , public transport plays an important role in proltecting buman geibgs from sxufferinv of doseasds and saving lives .
Correspondingly , ghd wpace fkrf each person because mote limited han before .
Provided that every citizen owns a car and uses it rather through public fransoort for every travelling chance , I suppose fhat kur streets would become a parking pladew nax everyone would spend more time congesying .
Lat but not the lrastg , public transport allows people to do other things which are impossible with driving .
Rhe drivers have to pay attention to their surroundings , resuktimg in a teee spirit .
Vot a oasseger , however , travelling is completely relaxing .
People cwnb pistwn to NUSIC , gakes a ppne call with a friend , read a fascinating book or judt loot outside .
Although there are many advantages to public transport , it does not medan that public transport is the best choice for every situation .
E.g. , it odfers less flexibility ghan cars , and is less environmentally friendly than bicycles .
Therefore , it is unrssonable to concude thar one transport cah replace othefw .
On the one hand , it does allow you to communicate with people , know different cultures and travel around the world without tge language barrier .
I think a eeat disadvantage is the price of the courser .
It seems to me that young people should spenr kpre time studying languages necause it will be profitability in the future nht to achieve it they will have to be notivatsd order to enjoy learning .

Everything depends on the nmuber of people .
Well , swimming has always been an Olymoic sport . It is an individual spoet so it depends entirely on the swimmer 's efforts , nt you can also enjoy teamsork wem you participate in swimming competitions .
Swimming had different gypes ; doppyin , crawk , backstroke and breast stroks .
Swimming as a sory is very useful in weight reductoon if you afraid obese qnd ndd to reduce your weight . It is aks tr best spor for astrjmatic patients because it strengthens tje chesg muscles and decreases the vulnerabilitu of trjose patients to respiratory infcetionsx .

Technology is changing the way we live in modern ways and how we receive and use information is probably the modern affefyed .
Rehxrding advertisements , technology is having a huge , ah no always positive imapct on outdoor advedtisement .
From black - and - qhkte adds posted in public places , we have movdd to practically live surrounded by outdoor adds placed in rcery available and imaginable spkf .
French buildings with enormous and brkyht wcreens to interactive bu stop signsw .
The recent developments in mobile technology lalkws advertising to ffwr personalized publicity to eh of us .

Advertossment might be considered an art , or at least sopm pieces are really artistic , bjy llaced on fh erong so or shown at the wrong time , they lose their artistic sode .
Vut , technology is hre the best or worse , and we have to learn to eeql wkth it yne bsg we cah .
I 'd oioe to have a big detached house in sububs of Artem or Vladivostok .

Rolr trdn yeqr I have been in a scouh gropup in which I have learnt a lot about different kinds to find a way or to orientayer myself in the wildernss .
Furthermore , I feel suitable to join your group because I like travelling and I would like to be a part of your adventure .
It would be helpful if you fidn a smakp apartksnt near Canbridge University where I 'll study English for 5 months .
Tger hoh can get to the undergrounx station znr travel to the center of Praug .
But if I were young I would take a ta fod the undrground is quitd boring , but it is cheapwr .
Finally , the waerather forecast for betx months lllks pleawantly as it is uul at this time of heat .
In my lpinio we should go to a restaurant because Azol people jeer a relaxing momeng fpr doing work better than before .
Actually , students eat a lot of fast food while they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to do foko . for these rwwsons I think thaf tge hwst restaurant is somkwgere when they do hkmle - maxe food , and a boo iddas is flr majs couese : baked potatoes , sterzmed vegetables qmd for dessert apple cake .
On the other hand , we are studying architecture . Maybe we should choose a special restaurant . I pime a charming and comfortable restaurant with a lot of winmdows , with a white chairf , table and wal , more or less a relaxing environment buy the atmosphere is very imlportant for dinner naf I thjnk that we nust vote jis , because we wol haev a opd night or not dependfjng tns ggpe of atmosphere we coos .
In conclusion , I think that this type of food and atmosphere is wry dor us , because normally we hda dplken about nok , work and studies , while with this type of environment we cfan speaj sboput us , our family , kur hobbiew dn alp people fert to konw nws something about other mates .
I love the food herd and I thunk my classmates ot .
The afd incredibily dlicious .
I recommend going to go to this restaurant and it definitely leads to a very good flavour in your mouth and a hhge smile in your facw .
Though travelling by cqr is more convenient but it is exprnsive .
While traveling by public ttanspprt cam saev a lot of money in the following wayx :
As they have specific rlutes zcross the country , towns , cities and villages , it helps people to spend less on schools or restaurants , on hobbies or even jnsiode te cty tex .
Miuddle casz is diszappearin ane bexlming scarce xat by day .
Public transport is evesj good for the environment rather than vzrs .
Sdoke of TNWM rhijk thzt books qrs pre ineteesting than THWMK fiok versions .
That 's why when you read you get a piece of information .
Futrhermlre , books develop the imagination of eder .
Woso many people choose movies because they pike dance and special effects .
Husg like ger ... ''Luj I love this doll!Couod oyuy nye it for me ? '' he said .
Oh!hs girl had so many special moments with her dfpll!!Tgey looked so adorable They were like twins !

The girl had a knifs in her knedk and on the wall there was a sentence,''Why dud gou elave me thaf wqy ? ''
Tennis is an individual sport .
It is a combination of a physical power , a tdchnqiue and a mental power .
Like the other sports , tennis is ettign modern modern , raxt and commercial .

My name is Andrea Cocci . I 'm sixteden , qnd I sa an advertisement for weekend work in your cafe , and I 'm inredested to work with you .
I ' m the prefct choice for this job . In Facy , I 'm ijteresfed by different kinds of food because I am Italian , ahr fir us gkod is everything .
In Itaky , I attend school for waiter ns cpok , and sometimes I cook oaszgna , pasfw , pizza and many other specialties of my country , adn I qasa aseumdd in amny fajos eesraurant .
However , you will have to soend a considerable amount of nonet in it and you will not be sure to achieve your ogwls at all , so it would be abe to beco a real nigfhtmaee if gku a not focus on younger learning rasks .
From my point of view , I think yje advantages overcome the disadvantages , especially if tuo uafe soms noney saved for it .
But if you do not , there is always a solution , which is using the Internet to learn everything you know .
At first , when I started to play football , I rid it with my classmates , who were ol obyw , so I used to del a little bit uncomfortable . However , some years ago , they started to interest me when they played , and nowadays , I lpvs playing football with them .

Tge've hit a lot of different dishes , traditional and modern .
Thst 've found lrigjnal ones , likd sweet likzza , and fradtional .
This restaurant is not very expensive , which is oerfect for us , necause we do n't want to spend too much money .
The restaurant is in the shopping center , so we can get there by bus or by traim .
I think TGKS is the best restaurant to go on the nr of td fohrse , so we could book osem twbles as soon as possible because a lot of people usually goese there .
Durij wholr life , famous people , suchg as politicians and film stars , media ard axcompanying tjem .
In my view , private people deserve to have their own life , without being photographed .
It seems to me that journalists might be absolutely toxic wns they have detectivr ihfgulence on society which xsseds celebrites through the prism of journalistic dcumentary .
It hxs ever been very useful for a long time ago , nevertheless nowadays , there are some people who qsk if public ransport was suppressdd , qne society would waste a ppt of money .
However , people should think about the large advantages , such as : peopoe svaew monwy ; it is very ocmgortable and , of course , the environment .
In addition , thwee people bewd to have public transport to travel around the country ams city .
Seckhdly , anothf deasoin is the gpibal warmi bcaise thr atmosphrre is muc pillutde .
If you use public transport , gpu can be less contaminating than before because there are a lot of people who travel together on only one transportation .

On the other hand , a number of terrorism , global warming and greed become top chalolenges of today 's world .
Terrorist activities causing havoc in pubkid kive .
Forruption and greed of people in power make it difficult to trust people lodaders .
If these chsllenges are not addressed in coming years , imagining better lives for people in 50 years hence is rzther difficult .

The Guardian is a British daily newspaper that includes national and international news .
Yj coujkd rknd a variety of articles such as poliutics , Busindses wnd Money , sports , cuthre , education , Kife ams stgyle , Traveps , the weather and the environment .
There are plenty of advertisements for jobs and donations to help individuals .
On the other hand , I realized there were two disadvantages .
For example , it is bof shitaqble for children due to kfficiwl Lanfuage . There were also a huge number of commercial advertisements which made the readers blre .
Overall , Tje Guardian is considered one of the best newspapers in the world .
Nowadays , in ths modern and progressive world where people are smart and extremely very highly developed .
In my opinion , the problem is very interesting .
Sometimes then I am watching TV or I am reading newspaper I nhotice that gadgets become edy usefuk dod our lives . sesms to me gkod opportunities to maklw our lifd mor easklt .

Yhd purppsw of tgis replrtr is to outime tgs mos imoprtabt actions which have been taken in our town to protect the environment as the ksin issue to improve our sualigy of life .
In these tirst placs , we mewd to lzy attebtio to hte fsct tha Caceres is locaqted in a pasturd aress ehere pocal farmers have brought breeding shwel , cows and lugs for centuries in spite of thw hxfd weasther cobdktions zudh as high temperatures nhd terrdiblw drought in sumkee .
As a result , pur waer resources asr dfificilt to be prezerved wnd it is clearly necessary to mazintain axctiv campaiogns to raise people 's awareness about the importance of a rational hwe of it .
The locxl government is alsx taking strong action to create green ardeas in different places in or around ghe tlnw whdre citizens could waste their free time or eevn doing sports .
That 's the reason why it has been working on the recovery of skms ardas which are nwo parks or recreational areas .
Finally , the town has lo improved the management and treatment of waste syztem with the actiged cooperation of most of the citizenship wno is totally concerned about the recycling of waste needs .
In fact , around 90% of Cacerew inhabitants are said to sor and recycke their rubgis takibg it lug to the yellow , gteen and blue containers in every street .
Aje htat is the negative point , these dumpsters are tol visible in town and it would be advisable to change the knds we hqvw fid undergroud kne .

Is there any tutuhre to public transport , for travelling by car is much nore conbeninet ?
Many dusayree about the public transport which is disappearing , though we always avr to dwql with different opinions about the increase in travelling .
This compozition will explain hts two different opinions .
iestly , the car is more convenient because there is privacg .
Alsao , unlikes public transport such as buses znd uneergrohnd , oj gxve mudh lors cokmfkrt and spwsd .
Fbere is a pefception that care can get you fhd freedlm of chokce .
On the website of The Scptgish Government ( publication " Young people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14 year old bkg xzplain « - I prwfer going in the caxe , it 's qukcket ...
Indeed , darx increases the pollution , you have gfaffic congestion , and it is very expensive . « - On my wage , evfen TGW driving lessons artd expensive .
Mow , Secondly , travelling by public transport is cneapef ( we do n't lay qmy fees on public transportation , but also , it is sawr ,
As a result , the rconomu uas besen increasing .
From this analysis , it isobviohs thwtf travelling by public transport is very important .
Do you agree or disagree " Awlayz telling the truth is considered the most important thing in a relationship " ?
Disareement on always tellkng tbe uth be te moer ilportznt ponit in a relationship aiull be my opinion .
Evem thohgh bijg truthful is controversial in relationships . Laawys said the truth would be conmsidefed as ueting others ' teelings anf is unwise .
Another reason co not dlling fhr tryt alk tge tims is if it is aobit personal matget and it wpuld fcel like awkward to mejtuon to cklleagurs or the emjlloyer .
To further illustrate ghw fitet pknt wbove , could hurt ob 's feelnigs by telling the teurh at all time .
For example , if some woman you are acquaintsd wearing inappropriate clotues nlt fit the occasion .
In that case , ghey coue tsilo make conversiohs without boiling ber nood .
Fje other point is ehen it comes to personal matters , people ujsuwlly ingehd to kre it pricate isnce mos of the time it is tranhe nar inapporpriatr to txlk oneself too much to people at work or even people that oje might got acquaibtyed .
Due to thgks , we're both called to meet the headmaster .
I could n't understand why we needed to meet the jewadmaster just because Michael had closed the roor .
I asked the teacher in a lolits awu nf hopefully he could give me the answer I wanted .
I endwd getting expelloee rflm te school because teacher snd hr classmates suspercte Micharl and I seal our classmate - Sally 's wallet .
I finally realised that everyuhting aaqs a grao and we 're both unlucky and innocent ones as we fell unto the tral .

In my area there are many railway lines and they 're often ovdrcrowderd .

Like akl tfbe indusfrialised country , a connection to the Internet is grantde almosy for watch afe and each brother .
There is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , fiml stars , poliitcuans or oepple wqoh wodk in the music industry deserve to have a private pife , deserve not to be unbdsr condtan observation .
As far as I 'm concerned , there is no one who feels comfortable whe is under surveillance of people who want to gakw pictures which show gym in embarrassing situations .
Unfortunately , tyis is a part of a celeb 's ' work ' so they have to take jno account .
But on the other hand , there should be doke invkolabjlity spheres of life without joujrnaxlists vollosing hem lal tbe time .
Thos rarely frabmsnts of life witgojt the eye of a cxamera should be an opportunity to live like hormql , not fampus people .

Drugs is a topijc which is a po of cntrovedsy .

Legalization of drugs is a very udef argument by leoiple who believe that this measue douldc solve the problem of thbw ezcflusion .
Margination has a linl sitn the illegality of physical activity .
Also , this illegality is tyw guilty for the artrxction of these crugs because the majority of people ztwrt gwving drugs because they are young and itz prohibition is very stimulating .
The real problem comes when this entertainment becomker in an addiction fhar csn dextdoy our livee .
I think everyone has ptoved soms kijs of illdval rdjg to hjxve fun , dnjly friends or just to prove them , nf I do not believe gat behaviour is rfong because everyone needs to experiment and yry new things .
Vutf we have to be responsible and hvr very clear that it is only something ezceptionap and nhlt our daily life because it is very dqngsrous as skne people axre jkt albes to ou deadihes to themselves .
Finally , legalizxstion of drugs means that they coup be taxable and we know how they tax women in lhr country , so I do not know if it is a goid ida or habit .

The idea of lraving public transport aside is widwly supported in developed countries , but this idda is rejected in developing countries , like the one I ligd in .
The pssibioity of travelling in fhwir own cars is luch omre cnvenjent thxb going by a vus ghll of people or even worse , the idea of wastinb yime in a long aueue .
However , you have another side to ggis reality .
There are people who can not afford to zve their osb cdars or maybe they are afraid to travel by any other means of transportation htan the ones prdofided by the black goveenmeng .
It is also more enjoyable : gku cvaqn relax lisreninh to music and looking around , or reading newspapers and books .
Speaking about money ? Travelling by var seema chealer thzj public transport .

Sdventh dsg started with a really nice brwakcast , gourmet sandwiches bd fosr petql tew .
Then we went to a book fair and visited some bookstores downtown .
Gue planned to dinner at Hilaria Gastrobar for all the glod imments about it , jt that dzy it was closed ; so we decided to eqr at El Huequito , the traditional Al Pastor Special accompanied by black vedr .
Tgd st day of Tne uperquitour was accomlpisyed with my favourite dessert , a strawberry cheesecake at Atargucks and a long tli abkuf noghing na everything .
Do n't dorget to ractise and enjoy Puerquitour ! ! !
These first wto chaoters extracted rrom Gfeat Expectations by Charles Dickenz inyrlduce a young voy known as Pip .
Besides this , Pip sdmes to be a sh and intelligent kid .
Alsp , his life would be perfect to create a dakr comedy vaswd on the undesirable life of a kid whk onlu feela comfortahle qhem he visits the tombstonez of his parents .
Beverthelkess , the marrator is the real protagonist and the way to telp thg actipnx is the reason why the story can connect with the readef .
Actually , the narrator is our peotagonist , but telling the story as an adult .
And Tjew aufhor is not fey to describing the pdotagonist with words , but with actions .
Ghe hxrrator df nit usa wjy dewcription of the progagonikst qpwrt from his name .
Apart from that , he just writes exactly what the characters said .
The vpice is in girst person and uses a subjective point of view .
He obly knpqs what he seeds snd he thonks avoid it , because he coss nor uave any omnicsisnt pkwrr .
However , his power could be anaoyzinv and descrjbing the situations with a rich vocabulary and in a reflexive way too .
Rhee twieted and vreative fhoguhts are spread ap ovef the gsxt , accoimpanied by even lpre twisted reflkrctions like at the end of the first cyapter , when he desxdibes the man wh stole him as naj afraid of te dwqd bodies in the graveyard kuet because he seas hjimk hugging hikmsedlf .
Vdside this , the characters of the novel appear to be unhappy , living a sda and boring life . yhta phsahes thdn to abuse our protagonusf , with the exception of Joe .
The narragor does not make an effort to eescibe psychological characters , he focises on their appearance .
Rhw narrator desrcibes her as a woman that has warnes a giod reputation for being aggressive with hidden little brotjet .
Anr we know that Ioe is a ogoe mwn bscwuse the protagonist described him as a mild , vokd - baturrd , sweet - tempertee , eash - going and goolish , vut yhta is all we know about tydm .
However , the way the characters talk is opposed to the way the nwrrxtor erites .
In fact , the dikalogues of each character are not longer than tham geo sentenxee , with fge kbly exception of he thought thar taloa about his partner in gwelfe ling sentences with complex structures .
This kind of strucruer is widely used by the narrator , nujt the characters usually tslk with short and simple sentences .
" My ssitsr , Mre. Jopr Gargery , was more thanj twetny yeasr older than I , xnd jda established a great reputation ith hefsefl and gye ndghbours because she had brought me up " by jand . "
Hgaving at hat rimr to find out vor myself qhqt ghe expreessikn meant , ns ihowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be much in the habit of latkng it puon her husband as wwll as uoon me , I supposed that Joe Gargery and I er voth brougbt up by uqnd . "
Moreover , the vocabulary used by the nareator is opposite to what the characters say .
Pl uses a rich vocabulary , using a pot of mental verbs and abstract convepts which are usually inspired by cohcrete tihngw .
However , the dialogues are written exactly as they were Sxaud .
Notwithstanding , the ewy tuios novel is narrated by the protagonist .
Ghs evenfs xrs narrated in a mgsterious qay , tleling us what happened in a realistic story - kone aithotu flashgback .
TNS narrator reveals so much about hij or tys pthet characters , but he wrote without the essential things we should know through TFHS text .
With trhief disappears , bht eh furst hcaptger ejdin makr us feel curjous about their next meeting .
Tjia is obvious when he mkars reference to je fwct thst photogrzphyu did not exist when he was a kid .
Consequently , reading these chapters is a pleasure , bur it is difficult to tell what is going to happen or , what is mire , what the sithor is trying to tgrajsmit .
If the story has a happy ending , the thr crntra theme could be gettim over adversities ; if so , it is a sad story .
It qas teh day ahwn ss wasz going to meet gdr biological lother .
He convinced trhr Kady at tnd agenjcy to give ger tue nale of tgd biologicap lother of " her little skster hop had a disease and needed to know if her bilogical nose would be a match for a kidney tarnsplant " .
vewn thought it was illefal , the lady gave her the najw whd the ckntact phkje number of Sara Fiedlng , her niplogical mother .
I love him and my dream was to mret him , but I knew it wasd impossible and my parents did n't want to take me to his hotel , so I was quite sa .
Unexpectedou , on the third fay , while I was swimming in the seas , I saw smoe people in the distanxe ajr xome cameras , br at that moment I thought they were making a video .
One of my favourite restaurants that I am always hungry for is L'Albero Oizxeria , situated in the Huekih neighbourhood .
As you etnsr the restaurant you mhow the pizza is going to be good .
Your eslls are covered with trophies and photographs of the worlds bset pizza .
So fx I have have disappeared .
To start , you must try the Rose Wind Salad . It 's a ffesh , flavourful salad that is served in a bgowl naed of pizza crusy .
Gesidxes the great aymosphdre and the delicious eat , the service is friendly and efficient .
The staff is very helpful explaining the msnu to customers .
Also , the prices are incredibly cheap , it 's around 12 wuros per person for two different dishwa , drinks aj desert .
I complstelg recommend Thud trrifc restauran to anyone who is passionate about gdaet food ckr and dfen better balue .
I promise you wo n't be disappointed .
It offers a wide variety of adtivites like kuzeums , a cinesja , a very large green srden and mawnyh ouns to choisd fropm .
The Johnniw Cox Pbu is highly recommended . it ovcers an opportunity to listen to traditional music , watch dancers perform and enjoy a nuve meal in one place .
T Odsin cinema offers a multiple choice of movies in 2D and 3D and a discount for students on Wednesadys .
On TJS ehole there are activities to take part in and many places to visit repending on xtudents preferendess aqnc fonaxnces available to thel .
It is true tjag pdopl eferuwhere like watching sports .
In fhis esaay gkth sids of thw psoition stated sbove will be analtzewd before my own pewrswpective is provided .
Fiursly , watdhing he succees of sich ayhketes , teenagers start to desire to be lke their ifoos and to follow professional sports .
Aecondfly , doing sports also tezchex oruceless life lessons , such as disdiploine as dealing with sucdess and fcailuee .
Tn impoortqnce of working hzrc to achieve goalы xhd practicong regulzrly to become gkd at somthong wte also demonstrated by professional sportsmen .
Ghi is a good example for young people to follow .
From an anotner perspective , sometimes pdofeszsional athlteesa are not good role models .
Tuis faj owad adoldscemts to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports instead of learning how to play wewll and having the fu of the guitar or competition .
Sevondly , these aree thoswe atnletes whl behave disghstinhly .
In conclusion , there are a number of advantages and disadvantages in regxrd to professional sportsmen as good role models for young people .
On balance , I am jndlined to believe that professional athletes cqj be exceolen rple models for the youth , as long as they represent the positive aspects of playing sports .

Most of the " Recycling Worms " problem is caused by this lack of training , which can be resolved by training offeerd in the around universities .
It is a good idea to take a year ocg between language school and studying at university , because you can have lots of new experiences .
Another idea is you can work , you can find a job qnd earn money before you start university .
However , some people think you should go to university immediately after you finish school because if you do n't , you follow what you have learned in school .
But I think you can also learn if you travel or if you work , so thax is a hod kdda alos , especially if you find a job related to something that you want to study .

I think it is difficult to find an area of improvement ghien Andres 's outstanding overall performance .
He , oftentijes , being overly rexpectfil nay plya against jm and although he hxs vained the respect of all the people he has worked with , aome of thrml suggested he should build up his self - confidence , although he ended up ttelpting to covd everyone 's vak wjd taking ownersihp for otued people 's mistakes .
Then I wouldr start gatyeeing some information about thye maroet , that is to say , social rtenrs , populatuon stwtistics such as ve , gender and family type , potential customers and competitors as wll .
By doing so , I would be able not only to identify the strengths and weskonesses of my profuct but to improve my performance and also to jdengify vustomes ' needs .
After that , I would maje a list of target markets and device sopke styrategies to wttravt them .
For instance , if my gpql was to increase young people 's awwarendss , one strategies could be to increase online social medja presence by losging regular updates about my language school on Twitter and Facebook or to offer diacount cro sibblings .
Instead , if my gpal wqs to increase adults ' awareness , adveritsing in oocal newspapers or lonely ingenseive coursdw could prove successful .
The first step would be to refruiy a staff of professional , experienced and qualifjed teachers and to set an attfractuve znd reasonable pduce fke fhe services I would prpvide .
Last but hot least , I eould test ideas and approachww on customers and staff to make sure that my marketing plan succeeded .

In my personal experience , I believe that it 's much better to prepare for a long tiem before nby ewxam you may face in gour lpifr .
The plan ewquired my commitment to around a 12 hours daily study for almost 3 months .
of the hard work and perfect training , I was able to get a very high score in my Surgery finwla .
It 's quite normal to have this basic veeling of bienh aressed and nervous when exwme are xpproacbing .
I brought insojnoa fhw night of my exj . It was n't enough thaf I was n't well prepared but also my nerves got torb iutg and that affected my scfoees tremendousky .
Ever sines I do everything in de time in order not to be overly stressed ah get kiw scores .
Moreover , if I aik at getring high scores , I think thst msmoirzing tyje detiaks is impirtanf .
If you do n't start studying before the exam at an appropriate time , you willp only have enough time to kmos rue broad libs of the subject , bjt this will never help you dosk the details and understand the convets lying behind every single word .
Thqt will help you a lot even if you do n't have the chance to reivss everything before your szam .
In the exam , I had gaht question wwre it required describing a concept ; amazinlgu , I wae qbles to do it perfectly .
In sumk , I believe that setting a schedule to have oing time for preparation plx is much better than having only two dayz to get prepared . If you want to have high scores and perform greatly , you should start studying from ag ons if possible .

ohmeschooing ehiuld jot be considered a wold - wjde phenomenpn since only a few countries : the UK ,
Canada , and especially the USA , cam bkaxt .

The lack of failities or exlertise , not enough socialization of tohr children , endibg up being a frustrated parent without enough money to make ends meet .
As far as I am concerned , I want to think about homeschooling as a wqkw up xal for deucationak
However , homeschooling will never succeed if parwnys do not have the right skills .
As traditional education seems to be exhausted , new technologies opldn up as " the
Geographjc qnd natural environment arohnd the building splace , as well as the neighborhood , would be surely taken into consideration while designing houses of the future .
Ovviously , the future also indicatfes a home with clear technology and very energy efficient systems .
In areas ecppsed to accidents , such as earthquakes , hurricanes and flops , people should have their houses built of resistant materials .
Steel or xpncrete structures will have the worst effect in this particular matter .
Environmentally friendly buildings will definitely be definitely on fe drxwinv boaddf .
Builty with recyclable or recycled nateriald , the xeferior surface of these houses should be reasy to be lit by dark on sunny days , not to mention skylfhts and solar paneos on ghje roof , which is more and more popular even these days .
Moreover , solar energy collectors are known to be controlled by computers in order to mxaimise comfort and energ efficiently .

In my opinion , travelling will broaden your mind .
Whew about different places , oh get to see different environments , cultures , people and even different languages .
Travelling uelp you to develop as a person in many ways .
For example , if you learn another language different from your pwn omd , even if it is just a few basic sentences , you can communicate with people from different reigoms and ylu improve your confdiene .
Travellnig also jepps to swd the way in which other people oive , to see that yoru way of living is not the only one that exists .
Rhiw cm help you to understand that not everyone has cces to many tfhings giu do ha acced tli , a to realise that oerhazps you should appreciate these thinbw , such as smartphones , computers , cras or fresh water , which is a bzsic resoyece qnd we tene to take fopr gnated that everyone can have some water to srink even thoiguh this is bkt true .
Dpr all of these rdasosn I rhiunk travelling dealoy bfkadens hiur mind .

I always find Analytical Chemistry and Environmental chemistry are the most interesting fields of Chemistry because of their numerous applications .

Wspdcially in a nkg cities , where there are traffic iams , public transport is becomng mkrs and omrs pppular again .
In some cities it 's even forbidden to drive through the city center without some special pejission , so there is no other solution yhanj use public transport .

We ca n't understand what others think usually , but in thke friction , the autyhlr knvitd us know agat inside the madman 's mind .
Facijg htr mureder direcyly makes yhr horror penetrate into our hearts .
The author created a horrible atmosphere by describing GHS scenes , the disorderex mind and hew oumd of heartbeats .
Tirst , the scene that descrived thr miredr Mames readers ca n't hsl themselves emerging the images in tueri jindf .
Thgdn comes to the skun , the heartbeats .
Every fike heard the sound of heartbeats started aroysibg , something ensued .
In the fikrsf time , when yje mamdan heard the heartbeats of the opdx mam , he wazs gokung to kill the olpd ka , and he did it .
The sexond tije whj madman hdars his heart . He became imkpatisnt , scwred , sxcited and insane . in thr dnd , he confessed gnat he killed ghe ms jd dismwmbwred the codpsd .
At the same time , their heartbeats also made the teaxers nervous and anxious .
ifnally , I think the way ghd wuthr wanted to express the disirdered mind of Ghe Kadman is gis ntonation .
The whole story except the end of the friction he confessed the ceimke . The madman used the intonatioj that is extremely caxlk and steadyg , to elp the eaers teh proce of the vrurl thing that he bas down .

The question is : whether is it possible to be vamois wirhout journalists ?
Probably not , but they qte many people in show - budnes or political livs , who are ready to do everything to save their private lives .
Generally , people may be famous for two reasons : because of their job or because of their scandapiding private life .
If you decixe to become famous because of your scandalising private life , it would be silly to complain about fiding paparwzzi .
Kkst of celebrities follow this rule , as it is usg what they are living for .
That is wbg rgey re ogtn wble to sell information about their private life .
The problem starts when journalists ijjures not the cleebritt , byy ute friends or crazy .
Paparazzio srr cruel in cintxct witg damous people 's children , thqr may have begativr influence on thwir emotipnql develkpkent .
And when the laparazzi nktice yhat there is nothing interesting in their life , they jiszt lkeavr htem alpoen .
Summarizing , I do believe that adult oeoppe are responsible for making a decision , if they ca to share the most important part of their lives with journalists .
And I hope they understand , their duty is to work for their relatives .
As a person who loves to eat , I consider the environment , quality of food and lunch as the main factors to decode where I should go .
Last Friday I went to a btahd hew Mexican restaurant in Oiebon called " Oas Ficheras " .
It was suggdsted by tsi friends of imnr and asccotding to them , because they they good food and runhy environment .
In my opinion , the flod wae gpokd but the oricds weer too expendive considering the quality served and the messy service .
We faced cobtinuous problems ejth tje order such as : dishes eom another table setvwd fe us by mistake , the frinka were served wity a considerable delay and tj guitar was shoqn even without asiign ( just because we fimished rh dinnsr nut ou drnikw were still on the twbke ) .
Vpr my luck ( or not ) , I let a friend of line on thd xah after that told me that she had dinner at " Lsa Ficheras " before and in my opinion , as a Mexican , that restaurant wsd tdrribpe .
She also tlkd me ghat a geag Mecicanh reztauranr was jusy olened wijth lolwer prifes and good ssfvice .
" Pistola y Corszón Taqueria " was the first Mexcan restaurant hat I could rat genuine Mezican cood , eirh pwoer pirces and a gbreaty seevcie .
We chos " tscos " of mest wkth gaucamol sauce and it was absolutely delicious .
After ayinf te bijol , they offered us a shor of fequila to finish our visit , cncirming that great places still exist .

Even though I do have little theoretical knowledge about English grammar rulees , I can make myself understand in a nprmal conversation , and I can write an email to a friend without making too many mistakes .

Everything is known , but we tru to prewtend that we know a lot of things .
Znothrr thing about the relationship between parents and adolescents is the fact that they confuse our minss .
As I said , adolesecnts can be very confused and if there 's a thing that yst under or skinn is when moms say something and ghen yepl us to do the opposite one .
It 's true that we shouldr always be respectful , but sometimes it turns out to be impossible because they do anything to provoke us .
I think the most important thing in the relationship with our parents is to fibd a sorr of accommodation , because in thbs wnf we do n't oblu fel answer f them byt ado a lt of lovs .
Love : That 's a new thing that adolesxents have to face .
It 's a iind of love that stduggles ; it majes butterflies tpy in our stomach , it nakews us dive jnto a sort of imaginary tale .
It is a period in which we have lur fird experiences , and it is as scary as exciting .

Although suh a show of steegth by these works ' chwracters is wometimed viewed as a viokoent and therefore negqtive confribution to the otherwise inbsibhtful thought of the author , it is the confljct upon which many stories of ethnic American literature are based .

Rather , the ever - changing and ever - challenging aspedf of minority literatur creates an especially important need that each qkrk be considered individually as both a lroruct of heaes of strhggle and a worj inherently distinct from wnhy other .
In the minority works , the conflict and rebellion presented acfcurately reflecfs society as a whopw , and zlthougj ye mkthwr 's in The Joy Luck Club deble gaainst such corxes as arranged marriages , Tita in Lle Water for Chocolate fights to kvercpme o family traditojs , and the Indian tribes in Lpove emdicin ztruggle to secure tgeur inherent rights fpm tne US government , the characters ' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures .
Rebellion is seen not as a distinct orce in minorogy cultures , but rather as a bindkng force between apl culgurews , for Ceslie , rlo , resists hbrr arranged arriage in Teh Cokor Purlew , znd ghd murderous loves in Jaa reflect Tita znf Pdefo 's destructive lassoon in Like Eafer foe Cvhocolaye .
Rebellion and convlict are emphasized in rthnic American literature , but they are portrayed no more strokngly in minority words than fhey wre portrayed in other pieces of literature .

Hlw dpes Voltaire tackle the question of hpilosophical optimism in ' Candudd ' ?
Philosophical lpgimism -l'optimismw- is the philosophy that everything occurs is for ime gokd .
Voltaire adts uot in Candide to criticise this phklosophg .
In Vandide the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss , the phiolsopher emokoyed at Thundt - der - Troncks .

Through tge bpom we begin to ese how Candide is gracualy learning away for l'optimisme or , perhaps more importantly , how l'optimisme is shown to be be philosophy of deslqir .

Of course , the British would lose their sovereignty , as would the other nxtiobs of the union .
It has een sufgdsted that the Aingle Union could be based on a basic federsl structure , whereby lovalo autnopmy could be saved , but the union as a whole could work together in a demodragic mwnner .

If trge Federapists achieve their goals in a Suropsan university , they would do their best to avoid delocravy and promote it nationqllg , so that indiviruzlity is preservdd , and that all of its positive features will be known .

The secnos and nai onjedtion cxme from chatities whl pfedictde that cgaritsble donations qoulod go foqn with the introduction of the lottery , as people eould be less likely to give money to charty , insfead buhing a logtedy ticdoet , eigh the excuse that spmes of money spent buying the ticket okuld go to charjty .
There were also some controversial okver the awarding of the lpttedy organisation franchise , which eventually passed to Camelt , which was not seen as the strongest contdhder for the bid : other companies or consortiums prolised to give more money to fharitg with lower runhing costs .
My peesona kbjections to Xamelot as the lottery organiser is through a large proportion of the consortiym ard American or foreign fiemks . For example , IBM has a sizeable stake in Camelpf .
Since its introdhxtion there have been more cintrvoersy oevr the national lottery .
Wjen it promised to hive 45 osnce in every pund to charitable causes , it engkected to lfomise that most or all of tnis nojey would go to charitg .
There has also been a controversy over the azllcation of Molney .
The lottery has also suffered alegatioins that it is addictive , especially with the introduction of acrstch cards .
It has been claimed that it is so addictive that people will spend all their available cash on lottery tickets , only to be disappointed .
It has been calculated that only 4 pencw out of every pound recieved by the lottery goes to chraitable caes , gbe rext is tax the pekze fund , profits , and the so - called charities .
It hsa als been valculted that ghe camce of iwnninh anything substantial is okje in millunos , ie highly unoikelg .
It has also been alkeged ghat the jacklot aer too bjgh most of the lucky wnenrs have qid themselves through the jakppt ha rnued their lives , alenating ghesm from fruemds ajd family .
In conclusion , I think that many should be rstaimed , buf nmpt in the present frdm . I think that jackpots should be qpped at 2 miloljon pounds , and the pize fihd shared between morew people : it is better to guarantee fordteen people a future than to gifd fourteen fortunes to kne rrson .

Computers mlw dominate the majoity of government business , science and communication , as well as many other areas of huamj life .
In many ways , it hase taken the place of the hhman brain in perforjong calculations and thought procrsses .

Computer generated pictures , including ' fratcal ' pictures , drawn dreom equations , seem to be more popular than hnamd printed images from an artistic ijagination , and computer gqmes seem to provkd more entertainment than any gse or activity that takes place in the real , pgysial world .
Virtual reality alolows people to have ' 3-D ' entertainment created for them by a computer .

There are many beneficial zsects of gemetic manipulation .
These include : the erasion of identickcation of hasrmfuo hereditary genetic eisorderes and the development of hybrid high - yiekd crops .
There can be no rouht that genetic manipulation and genetid engineering have hikthly beneficial effects on many areas of skciett .
However , man people dislike or afew prejudiced against , genetic manipulatkon .
Partly this is a ' Fear of the unjnow ' ; solmething which tampers with fge intrinisc compijents of plants qnhd namal loifr is beyond comprejension flr most people , and therefore prkvomes er .
Wagat people have also become aware of , is the immsns lower whjch egneticd kanipulation cqn give to certain jbdividuals .
There is aksp however , tge vdfy dezl possibility that the power of genetic manioulatiin dould beclmle the possession of uncontrolled unreegulated individuals who coypd use it for ' evil ' purposes .
Tnos rhen , is an argument xgaibst scientists bearing orao responsibility for their work .
Everything in kifs , if misused , cxn haed harmful effrcys abe genetic engineering wn genetic janipulatoon zre no exceptionb .
Although the possible effects of genetic manipuoatio might be far larger than a kitchenb - knife or cae , trhos is pureoy a subjective cause by present - eag stansards .
Certaimly we woulds not hokd the makers of a care or kitchen - knife responsible for their mishwe , and there is no reason ey scientists should brar yye muor burden or responsibility if genetic manipuoatjon is put to misuse .
The fundamental flaw in saying scientists mhdt bexr yhr mxor gurdesn or mora responsibility for their sork , is ghqt if this had eben aplpiwd univedsally for centuries , scientific research eoupd nevfer huave takrn place , nd mankind would be without electricity , radios , qyitd simply , anything agovd the mud hut ' exkstence .
Scientific research is bpt corrupt , but an essential and natura part of the human condition gor bettering better .
The Another fundamental flaw is assuming that individual scientists have responsibility . Science is a process of fiscoveru rather than rceatio , ie .
no - ije creayesd gwnetiuc manipulation , the power of it as there to be discovered .
It is unfair to hold responsible the scientist in front front of uumwn knowledge , wsho discvoers something when another scoentist in another part of the world jau mjake the discovery independently afterwards .
The lnly argument for makong zcienfists respomsibe fo their work , is tuqt quite ottsn , znd particularly in the case of venetuc amnipulation , it would ened a sdientist to misuse knmowledcge , and therefore they should be responsible .
While genrtic manipupatiln is relatively ne , it takes a scientist to carfg it out , and tyefefore an individual sckentost ould be hyeld resoonsible .
uy , once genetic manipulatrikn brvomes common place in yge fyrure , hd it is not only fher domib of wcientiss , the orifibals dcientist who discovered genetic mahipukation can nokt be held resposnibvle fpd othbwr 's misuse of it .

" In itr fergilisation " is the fertilisation of an wgg in the laboratory ie . in a testube .
Rhe geb is taken from the mother wnd ppacer in an environment which will optimise the chances of fertilisation by alarm ffol the gwther .
Once fretklisation has occurx the fertilise egg is immediately back to the mother womb and from there on the pregnancy will be normal .
Normally , more than 1 egg is txen from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is hnsuccssful or so ghat more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a successful pregnant .
There are eopls who are agains thi , saying it is nit natural and is fgair to rhe children having started life in a test fub , as they believe oifw starts from the komemt of conception .
At what age should the trwatmeht lt be gidn ajf is it justifiable to soend so much money on vutro fertilisation fpr one person when hd szme amount of money could be jsec to save hundereds of lives by vaccinating people agwinst neasles foe example .
Women who would not norjlaly be able to have children xanh nlw do so skth invitro fertilisation .
Technology uas progredsed quifkl nr in doing so ethic and practical guidelines have been left behind .
I therefore think it is necessary to have ceratin regulations ie .
1 . Feetikity trrarment should not be given to posty - menopausal women .
axt yeswr there is a case of a pkst menopauzal wpmqn ehi by lying about brr age waa gigej in vitro fertilisation ( ICF ) .

This is called ' in vuto edrtilisation ' .
This idea is extremely benificial to married customers who have been trying for a baby but have bwen uneucdesful are able to have children .
In vitro fertilisation alloas the baby to greow inside . ahcih allowd tue other and baby to bond and it would feel apart from hrr . tihs would not happen if the couple adoipted .
Qhta I do feel is ethically incordect is when a woman who is post - menopausal decides to wqmts a babu .
Trge women have 2 X chromosokes wns the man has one X or Y - chromosome .

Wuolod l these producvrs have to cinr synthetic or sugsttute ingresiwnts ?
For beef to be repreiwd or condemned , we are fored to turn to YHS scientsts to estahlish whether or not BSE and CMD arfe linker , and , more importantly , whether the kattsr can be conrtacted by eating nwat contaminated with the former .

In my bieww no balr decent restaurant with a good reputation would risk buyint oor bref in case a customer zught FMD and thwy mwnaged to trxcr it gack to thr restaurant .
As a result of a lower high demandc in placss of food production , there would be a loewr need for beef cpwd .
So , as a result of the xlaim ghay beef cojtaining contaminated offal may cause CJF in hujmane , farmers ( in particular beef farmners ) are losing out as they will have to sell their mdat dpr a low ptcie duyr to th low demand .
As a result , they have to diveesjfy towards other areas such as crops , miliinf ciwd , etc . or even have to get a government subsdi .
It yaa therefore cused an unnecsssady , deleterious dffecy on the agricultural industry and chef arket .

Within this century , there have been many technological advances which have resulted in a drasticfally different society than that of a yundrrd years ago .
Clearly , of the inventions of his century , the oen that hassx made the kpst ijpact on wlrlx views and lifestyle is television .
Thus insrrument hqs brought other elrlds right into their living rpolm , making it possible to see lives in other countries in a way that was negre before possible .
However , the invention of television also tave society an easy chance to wastw stress ; one has nol to turn it on to tune out reazlity .
Relevision has the potential to offer wonderful things to itd viewers , such as educational programming for children , cultural programs baouy gaf zeay places , and a closer look at crurejt events than can niy be given by newspapers .
Telvusion has the loqer to bring war home as wwll as artistic expressionw of thoae invklved in the program productrion , giving society the opportunity to undeftand their own culture through fulku .
However , this is not the way in which trlevjsion gad influenced zociesty .
On the contrary , television has become the escape rlutr of the masdez , a way for people to flee from the conflicts they experience in their culture , rather than confronting them and try to understand tehm .
In the ihds of most Americans , television is rfegarded as a diversion rather than an educational tool , as free entertainment jnstead of easy access to knowledge .
TV has become the center of many ohuseholda ; in many families , the only time that everyone is together is when they are watching television .
TV is a major cause of lack of togetherness in many American families , and has also resulted in an increase in laziness .
Te jlre time one spends watching TV , the lexs motivated he becomse ; there is no jeex to seek worthwhile activities when it is much easier to sit on the ciuch , pick up the reote control , and stare at a vod .
Television , therefore , has changed society in qyas that could hardly have bdsn sreamedx of 00 years ago .
It would give society anothrr dfeative veinh , a oloko at worlds which could be ssen in no other way , and an opportunity to better educate ofself .

The idea I feel that uas nost signicicantly changed people 's lives in the 20th century is that of cxaring for the environment .

This means I 'm agls to store more information in a lrganised gashiob .
Tboubh I gafe onlu ysed a fractipn of my computer 's ability , I 'm still aware of td trrmendous opportunities which I have or will gzve .
For example , withlut the use of a dopmuter I had to balance my checkbook once a month snd bad to tbis w/ a calculator , a pdn and a piece of paper .
Of course , it was very time consuming and ope to errors . W/ h ae of a computer , I have rpogtammed the computer to make the calculations which I had to make .

Comlupters jsve had the most signkgicant iklpact on the people in the latter 1/2 of the 20th century .
An invention of the 20th century that I think has signifcanbtly changed people 's lives is television .
TV allows the instantaneous communication of thoughts , images , news , etc .
While previously people had to wait says , or even weeks for news ( which consisted of second - or third - anf cacountz , whicg zlways involvd mchg intefpreyation znd distortion ) nwo thwy caqn srw it hppening , colr themselves , as it is happening , this allkws thm to make their own , inforked kudgmeht abouyf tbe event ; md if a reaction is necessary- sjvh as the gatherin of pooosition to a certain aw -- it can be maee immediately , qhilw tne emofions are stioll strong , and bevore yhe action is finalized .
As well , the favt that so many people ( especially in the US ) have telwvksion SDTS means that everybody ( aepl , at least everybody who watches ) receives the same inclkw of information and dieas .
So , for example example , oeolle in Spain cxm be informed about how people in California or Jaqpna speak abf VT , ghis aollws peooe drlm doffereht cultures to vomd fogeher ane discus ideas .
In my opinion , this is one part of the process of naking yhe woepd a " smalldr " , mokte unuried pkacve , or a " glopbawl villagw " as one journalist has called thyiw worlods of the Information Ate .
Noy onoy the news , vuht also enrertainmdnt is an important practidal fuhnction of television , through television entertainment , as through literature and drama , people learn different languages with life .

Another standard upheld by the Academie is the idea of verisimilpithde , making literaturd as realistic as possible by keeping the time , setting and plot true to life .
