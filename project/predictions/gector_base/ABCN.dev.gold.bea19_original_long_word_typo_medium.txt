I would like to study Psychology because one au I would open my own lsychollgy office and help people .
I think that it is more convenient to drive a car because you cfadry on morw things in your own car when travelling by car .
In my experience when I did n't have a car , I used to use the ub to go to the dchoop and go back to my house .
In my opinion , the cat is n't ndcsssary when you have crashed in the street , in tyaf momeh you realize the necessity of public transport .
Depending on the distance and duration to the desired place , the mode of transpirt is chosen accordingly .
But Generallg soeaming , tavelling by cast is nch more fun when compared with other modes of ttansoort .
Zonce , we have the option to ewit anyrike we want to whether we tfabel by XA ( which is implssible wne travelling by traqn & Flight ) .
In daditioj to it , we can also take a comfortable short bxp on rhe gavk xear ac wakd up fresh .
Due For the above mentinoed reasons , I am going to clnclyde that travelling by cxra is mufb mprr convenient .
I love children , and I enjoy looking afwr them . all I rogznized mayn zpoets activities beoee in my school .

Because public transport is a cosxg effedctiev an better eeskurce allocatino in mass transoprt system .
Bjt it czn use a cheape wau going to tehri destinatijon especialloy it is far away from everyone .
For example , I think that it is affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane travelling to another country .
I think fuat public transport in fugure is going to continhe to be used because there are a lot of people who eoew n't have enough money to psy gord a car even if it is yesd , so public transport will continue to ave future gut people are goijng to use mire the car thwj gue or uyndergound .
If we think about it the it is better because we do n't nedd to wait fpr thne ya we ats wait for ghe nus or underground buht in another way , car cust more moljey than public transport .
By dsr we can jyat stay with ourselves , which can be okay because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around peppld that are unknown , but if we use public transportation we cwn mewt friends or family , so both trasnportations are goold anbd the cars do n't nrewd necessarialpy to end up with ghe pubvlic transooft .
If I hjqd it to choose between bgh transplrtatiin I think I probably choose cr bevause it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus .
In my community , we are very interested in the environment and ecological things .

Public transportation is an important invention in human history . It vrimgs amount of benefits in our lives .

Public transportation has bedh morr yse by people and osr the gwars It is kind of becomig cheaper qne axlsk more safe but wome people pfefrr carsx to rtent do we agdee withb and ehazt is our reason for that . That is what are we going to demonstraye in this easy
Before 40 years ago , there was notning caloes publc transeportqtion and people rarely oeend arz so in ghosw trars there was not eevn good facility to mopbe from place to othrr and that is because there were no companies to build cqrs in about 10 years , car trading bwcane vuable zn also gceame vedry supported by hagkng ge iw fajs at yhd neginning rhw faced a lpot of provlejs bh rhye were ablw to solve it by the end
jowadayw all facilities of travellinh ared more convenient , from cars to buses , evenj trais and planes . Some people prefer cars because they like crowded olacee or because fge fjnd it sonetimjes cheaper , but frdom aniher point of view publi transportatiin is very cheap ame eveb faxter but wjen it comes to traveling a loy of peopel prefer ridibg their owm cars to feel thus sal experience and to enhoy more by cbilling out frkm crowded places
To summarirs it is different from some opneis opinion to another . I predict tgat lubljc transportatoin will be ijptoved and people will use it more wnjd more that by yhe md catw will disappear znd wiklo will no longer uwsd
The topic itself explains the uncertainty of public transport in oyf coutnry .

Nowadayu , people uze fossil ruel as the most important source of energy for travelling , manufacturijg . thiz source of energy does n't always amintain at yeh cinstamt level , but simdday it will be r out .
People must find ways to use other energy sources like nuclear electricity , qid pser , public transportation such as elrctrci metro us this komd of energy .
As a result , governments wulo invest money in researching the usdabe of two new types of energy . Travelling using public transport will neckme luch cyeaper yhan pesonal car .
The ranb of public sdrvicew will be expanded to remote areas , it will become much more convenient .
Commutign , travskling with public xervices wklk be the first prior choice .
In addition , the population is increasing rapidly . In the near future , almost all cities in the area will become overcrowded . It will laec to manh oghner problems to be solved , for example , traftic jwsm , zir pollution .
In some perespectives , thrse pdobles arr led by t over - sing of personal vehucle .
People will ealis that using their own cae is just to waste their time in traffic jams or to yraduall kilpijg themselges for breathing pollutge .
So the best way for them to travel is through public transport .
In conclusion , investments in developing public transport will be increased xonsidesrably , public service of travelling has a bright potential and it 's tance in the future ca n't be replacbele

Hree tehre is ohe : do tepevisdion offef high ljkelg opportunities for the zudiece in an educational way ?
From my experience knowledge , I believe television covers bothg entertaining and educational functions .
It notes how many education programmes broadened uokung dhildrem 's horizons in the past few years , ohq quicklh an assult learn different basicd from a grwaf eak number of educational fogrammes , such as cpokijg , sciejcw and technology .
It leo nores educational programmes make a decision on what citizens should jnlw in the future axnf whyat knowledge oye next geenrations ars rquited to possess .
Apart from educational cohrents , there are so many foul content , business advertisements and famous information on TV that citizens wo n't be aboe to fell rufht ffpm worng .
Yowevet , I believe tghe educational prpbrammes on TV still plays a vital role in educating boiyh adults and young children .

Whereas on public transport , you onky hywve to zy the ticket , you do n't have to drive and if the bus or train or whatever vehicle you use , breacksx down it is n't your responsibility .
In conclusion , I think pyblkc transport has fyture , and the more people use it , the better future will be javs .

My name is Vouad and I would like to talk about my favourite sports . Volleyball is one of the most beautiful sports ever and I used to przctisd tjis spt 3 yikes a seek since 1980 . The reasons for my enjoyment of this sport are as follows :
As citizens of a village , we totally cre zbout environment of our village .
Evrfy Sunday , we do a mufual cooporation where anyone can treat rubbish as well as they treat themselves .
Ehnat we bdilef as Musloms thay , we hgave crwated by lne wbol do n't give oths witn him fhe one who cdeate ohe father ( Adam ) and created from him ( Dce ) snd thbet wsre in the Paradise and instructed to nkt erawt from the tfed but rh Satan defeivd them so they brouyht to this lirw and generations famw fcfom tbem snd hqd sent te prophet and messengersz ( Joses , Jesus , Mohamsd , ltherw .. who they woeship fhe samr one ) with Mkrzcles and evcence of hte ttufh , to guide the people to know who wgk wiolk follow the trjth whikch ailk guide to the Paradioxe and whl follow other paths which it will guide to yhe gell . so bhecause of taht we ard here to do thne test in this short life .
Transportation is the heart of qny , whether it is pyblkc or private .
public transport . day by folk afe ore ctazay abpug own vehicles ehicn lsadx dxrk future of public transport
First . I agree with Givrh ststemebt that tbere would be touth of rpr public transportation in nsawr furure.because people want privacy as like as freedok which is quite impossible in public transportation .
secpndlg thede mode of transprotation civer
as much as possile of city area or toab whch mismanaged routine hwo teavellrd by public transportation a consquence general people avoid travelling by public transportation finallt i zay that there are farious modes of transporotation avqliable
to comlestition with oubic transporatioh .
Nowadays , people have numerous opltjon frl travelling lik many peivatw companies .
which plays an important orld to give fouvh vompetition to the government . As a fesupt of thgks cknsumer ysts jlre benefits like lower faire , privacy , free and safe travelling.in addition , many qutojobile companies are launcing new fqr with affordabel prices which insiost people to uszr more zhd more lrviate vechile .
Bug soke people are very fude and their dogs are aggressive to oghed dogs .
family is the most important institution of social licer .
Every member hace his kwn role and fhw obse , the fathet or the mother , have to guidd gus te to understand the right hehafiour or attitudr to have aith life .
Usually there are gemeration problems , sons do n't understand parents and vicecersa , bntu dialoging and listening emotions and afcts , everyone cx have nothed point of viww .
A mother or a father can be a friend if there is communciation and trust , if someone gives bi contribute in fajjly dhtiea .
If you want to see that movie , you newr to watch the first 3 movies before to understand it .
I do n't think thwt this movie is ofr all the damily , vecahse is hard for littles kkdd to understand . In my opinion , I think it is more a tedn molvei .
Apart from that , Karate 's not just a spott , it is also a discilline , it teafh yi respect , balance even failure .
For people who startsz Karate is easy to follow the class , so my advice is just not to vdt nervous and to be clncerntrated on wbat he or sur is doibg .
Technology is something that is very important , something sithout which we ca mlt ove .
The topic is technology .
Nowadays , we use technology in every thim , from education to making clothes . We have technology every every everywhere .
Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful , useful and important for development , but today generation is influencc by technology that they have atoppede to do other activities .
Last year , my friend Micnal was at echokl when he heard about a huort soccer competition . He liked the idea , so he decided to enter through competition .
but there was a fdess in order to join the competition . He had no money . Fortunately he had a kit of friends they could lend him .
He pjoned me and asked me to lenf hol some money to register tn competition .
He took yhed money trhe sefonf cah . He viniahed the registration and started in weitinbg tje stort after lohy fime psening in writibg and doing a good job . He wanted to give hiose story to the international srhdent magaiznw oddice . He found out there was a nogive on ghe door say rhat tje competition hae canceled , he cam back veyu ads asmd tolx me what happened .Michxel closed the dcoor an knes at that mpmenmt he had a mistake .
Tarfelling by fsr is n't so much more convenient yless it is so much more comfortable , bi actaulky we do n't think about the pollution of our planet .
Travelling by buw is veru sfressful because the people push me or I ca n't sit rown because there are n't any chairs for me .
Kther transport oublif is a taxi like a car . It is so much more comfortable to but it is more expensive than vua or train .
In conclusion , in the future we should have a bus so we comfortable .
The vandalisme in Latras has increased a pof .

·Introduction
This research will dxamije the different activities we can do in or leieure ims in Castelldefels .
·Acrivities to kjlk time
As our town is wsl - inown roe lur magnificul beaches zlpng hw Mediterranean ckast and for thw Olympi Cxnaxl of Cqsyelldefels , menu foreigners or local people come hedr to do activities , like kitesurfing and windsurging on fhr veaj or canienin and aquagic skiuing on the Olympic Fanal .
Theee activities are the most popoulaf and ye mjosf xpesnive too .
Howrvee , I fulopy recommend thr , especially fcot sloirty , advebturous and young people .
In Castelldefels , there are other activities less popular , bgut cheapdr , kr instajce : frew zmba masterclass , yoba beacu , running ... as sports activities , abd as wocial activities theee are lubrary frojp , thestrd ...
As I xaid , ghese activities are not as popular as the activities of the Olympic Cabzl and the beazch , but their success is increasing more and more .
·Recommendation
So , finkly I suggest that it would be a great ieda to colbnine ue different types of accessories , both popular and the latest .
If you tried Aol rue activitjes , you would spend a great time wre in Casteklddfels !

I really appreciate your tilw and consideration .
It will be a pleasure to discvuses perobally why I am qualified for this position .
Fitstyl , there are more multiantional companies that need people to speak through kanguage , so that means that people who know to speak a foreign language have more opportunities to get a job in an important company , or will have more chances of being proloted .
On the other hand , there are many benefits . For example , if you want to travel to another country , it is very useful to know a different language , because you can understand it without complications .
Todau globalization is making the world more closed . tnwt means that there are mor opportunities to have contact with other cultures , for example in piterature , portry , films , TV programs , music or some other part of the culture .
On bxlance , learning foreign languages is very pksitive on difgerebt aspwvt , so if you have the positivkty of learning a new language do it , because it will brin gu amny hebefits .

Although the federal government which has decided the role of USA hqx nahy benbrfits acfcordihg to rsadkng passage , the lecturer believes that there is no perfect government .
The powerful of yye federalism , which has mod libedrty for the states to have their own policss according to their news , is not aoaays vood for the lectur where it may creeate sme comfortable betwwen the states .
An example of that is the mxrfiage of homosexuals where some syate aemit this marriage , others do n't .
Also , the frading passage declares twt rvej thew fedearl government let wacb state fynction independence , it still controls the main decisiobs .
Tuis dasr caused some problems when the lecturer menfjoned the failure of the federal government to stip illegl immigration to the USA through Jevada desert .
Also , the control of the federal government is the deason wyg eaqch of thr etae and the federal blame each other for the increase of the unemplooyment in swomd states .
In conclusion , the federal government , which yove freedom and opwerful , causes jant problems such as no sihge policy and confusion in the responsibility .
Travelling to a different country can be both exciting and frustrating at the same time .

After the Internet was ibvented and rvraled first fime on August 29tj 1969 , Social Mrdia Site ( SMS ) is the next mnot siginficanf innovarion that you parly reolacee doe face - to - face communication .
SJS suxh as Facebook sdns lit 700.000 messages , and 170.00 Tgweets are publicized on Titter every 60 secondse .
Unsurprisingly , socjal consequences of Dacebok xn Gwittee play an important role in communication , regardless of destination or time .
However , people who use Facebook , Twitter or SwMW in general , are not lkkepy to have their own personal privacy thaf there is a possibiity of cycle of bullyong .
Tgis essa will force on the benefits and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitter , and also commentsa potential future of these inplications .
Communicating can be achieved , regardless of distancs , throyh Facebokk qhd Ywktter .
One benefit of being connected lobalpy to Facegook and Taitter is that messages can be tarnsmited almots instajtly to biewers .
Firstly , Fwcdbook abe Twqiyter can be sed when thdie uaere are in an unoleasaht mood , and where their negative feelings are wxprdessed .
Secondly , Fcaebook provjdew the opportunity to remain in touch with daily activities through friends , makijy observztkons of relationships , maintaining one 's lqn fwelikng witnih the work ( through wall lotss , pikes , messages , wtv ) ( Oldmeadow , Quinn , & Kowert , 2013 ) .
That is to say , huma behaviour on Facebook are interacted with tohers by zharihg their mopd , and receiving responses .
Thirdly , Facebook can be used as an organizational communication goal in business .
Knowledge about t members increases continually , qjd moreover , maintaining erlagions with other existing mejners , xmd also share their smr interests by the socioak netwprk .
( Emerald Group Publiwhiny , 2013 ) .
For instance , by following famous celebrities , people can easily see the daily activities which have been posted by them .
However , xue to tghis , people sho ze beong fcollowed , or jsers in gensrao , may yage leds personal pirvavy , and also there is a jivh potenfiak of being oueposely aggressive toward women .
However , information which appears on Facebook or Twitter is easily accessible , therefore wverybory can easily respond as a publkd opinion .
However , information which appears on Facevook or Twirter asre easjy acvesskble , yherefors everyone can easily respomse as a pyblic olinion .
In fact , along with the agreeape and pleasant comments , there are also a number of aggressive and even racist comments .
ebfause of accessubpe information through SMS , it has led to many problems , ivnolce with cycle - bullying , cycle - badgering , cycle - stalking behaviour ( Krishna , as cited in Williams & Msrtren , 2008 ) .
For example , Krishna et al.(2013 ) replrts a cqee of continuous disturbing a woman from a mqn called Mr .
X " admitted to a state psychiafric nosiptal after nein fpuns not competent to sgand yrial on chxrgyes of sgqlking harassment , trespassing and telephone harassment " ( pp .
Potenyially , Facebook and Twitted , anxious SMS in general , nay reolace face - to - face communication and improve their fumcyions , because people fdle mlre freedom or enjoh using Gacebook or Ywiter withotu hsve to vieq eacn toher appearances .
The positive outcomes might be the more time people spend on MSA , the lews communiocate zkills that thru have .
Fe example , controkling what posts should be seng by adding more privacy options .
However , sespitr tbe useful of Chinese implications , people should pay attention to Facebook and Twkttre could affect their social life by avoiding using it molstg of trne tome .
In conclusion , the benefits of usjng Gacebook ahf wtitter is that people can ocmmunocate and be connected to their friends frequently .
Also , people can easily resucer their hegaitve liod by shairn and sxpressing how they follow .
In contrast , because Fqceboik and Twitter have bedej connected worldwide , which means ptotectjng personal privady is probably impossible .
Possibly , users might express aggressive towards each other , because of lack of privacy .
Photography classes cpr everyone
Introductiob
Teenagers are consatngly introduced by social networks like Fadbeook , Instagram , Pinterdst , etc .
Photographs are ibcluced in all of those sutex .
Also , this phenomenon of taking photgraohs is part of our daily life , because it is the best way to capture special moments , lonely brthdays , yragels , special occasions , etc .
This practice is considered ghkse activities tbag anypne can do without any kind of sepdial lrepqration .
However , teaching students how to apply better techniques in the momny of making a picture should be considered as learning to draw .
Recent studies show that in the last rwenty years kore tnaj 3,000 photographs wr takd ler pedeon in the worod , especially in the latezt generations oifds(teenagedrz and iidw ) .
Ghjs increase is related to the overwhelming development of technology in computers , cameras , cellphones , etc .
Also , technology is cosidrred as a fye of atr , so it rwuires the knowledge of esecial skills , techniques knowledge .
Thw summertime wasx first ijroduced in Ejglxnd in 1908 .
What if you do n't have any of those required ?
It 's a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people . in simple words ,
You have to trauj five dqys a week and you need to cpncentrae a lot .

As far as I 'm concerned , public transport is tne bessf trandport mdeia gpr environmental cxrd .
In xlite of some people make enough money to guu their own xar , elevttic and hybrid children are more expensive than traditional onew ( the ones wbl use gas or eisel ) so , people choose these oens aqnde yhat 's because there are several issues that we have to ddal qith .

The pvernment wnd many comlaniws are measuring fne C2o emissions which are being produced by industrial or aervoce processes that are necessary for producing goods for the social xonsums .
If people do n't have public transportation , they could walk , ride a bicycle or buy a traditional car , and that will probably take place when their destiny is far rrom thd ppwce where they love .
From my point of view , public transport should be very imloftant in the future , especially in developed countries .
I think the government will sokw down the fee for public transportation . That could make people to uhse public transportation wnd caring about the environment vom CO2 emiesione ahc prevent gpibal heating .
In Cosalda City Council , people wr well ihforme abpur tsking clean environment .
There are many ecological islands .
Nevertheless , it is not enough , because dog owners have most of the blame .

Traveling by car is a convenient mode of transportation , ut mozg of the lopupation can npt wffodd it .
Rhere xrd zdvamtages anjx disadvantages in using public transport .
First to duscuds the benefits of public transport . It is cheap and affordagle for all classes of oeopld in society .
The buses are released by the government in order to meet people 's ifnancial condiruons .
Using public transport is a ije waste and no lribacy are some of the disadvantages .
Simjlafly travelling by cat has its own advantages and disadvantages .
Everybody can nog affkrs travelling by car as it is costly . vit to discuss the benefits , one can enjoy high procacy during travel and it is convenient .
and sophizticated and can drive faster .
To sum up , it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because it has eual advantages and disadvantages .
There is no debyign tgat the MRT in this city is suvj a convenient metrkpolitan system .
They occupy tpl mayn seats , inclouding priority seats .
Furthermore , most of them are students .
They do n't redspext other passengers , they just keep laughing and teasing each other , deapitd ths faft tuqt some people haven't tpld them nor to do this .
Somehow , njkt apl of yhdm can identiry whether their bodies feel uncomfortable merely because of their appearance , which leads to some misunderswtanding betseeh thbek .
Jorwover , some old pelole owulde take this considerative action for granted and they woulc even commanbd young adults or students offer their seway without mannerdsx !
In my opinion , the transportation in our fiyy hav nothing to criticize expect that .
Tskevision is an important part of modern culture .
We depend on yeleviswion flr entertainment , education , music and films
First , it enabpea young people to share cultural experiences with others .
Televjsioj dab tdach kids important values and life lessons .
Educational programming vaj develoo young children 's sockaoization and learning skills .
Nee , convenient evdnfs and historical progtanming can help mak hlung people more aare of other cultures and people .
Documerntarirs csn help develop critical thinking zboyt society and the world .
Cultural programming can open up the world of music and art for young people .
But television also has negative effects : First of all , children always spend a great deal of time watching television get less exercise .
In asdiution , htewe children receive oews sociapiztion with other children .
Tepefision also takes away fdlm family timw .

From newspapers , newspapers , even foreign media , we can easily figure out how our environment is changing sincerely .

Humans always desire to have a more convenient and comfortable life , hu fottet to protect and cherish the Earth at the same time .

Yours faithfully ,
In our modern world , many people see suffered from stress that psring from life xonditiona .
In addition to this , people work in very stressful workplaces and they want to leave deom this condition in holidays .
In this rspect , many people prefe to go natural pllxces with their families in order to clrget about bad situations in their lives .
For example , walking in the countryside or swimming in the sea can be uelpfjl to forget hard lid xonditions .
On fhw one half , holidays are tbe bedsg foe people in gerks of thinming clearly their experiences of life .
Flf instane , in stressful conditions , people cab make da decisions for their future .
Besides , people undrestimats emotional feelings in their workplaces .
In conclusion , holiadys are befy sjitble for people in order to heal their problems and stressful life consitjons .
However , the government qnd thw local coyncils of hit cities such as Madrid or Valencia , xr tryijg thueir hesg to promiye this movement because they consider it a way of development .
Furthermore , it turns out to be the quicdst kehtod of transport .
Statisticallpu cycping is rarely vonsdered to be molre dagnefous tban teavelljng by car .
Another disadvantage is the weird .
In my opinion , cycling contribtez to improve community spirit and it is possible to look for solutions to tace the disadvantages of this activity .
No one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .
Shd this undesirable yime might not be so ahort during holidays , due to less frequent schedule .
When the vus is crowded , we have to stand , making us mote eshusting especially coe a long distance .
Even though cwrse could rogide us with so many advantages mentioned above , the advantages of travelling by public transport should not be neglectee .
First , public transport is good for the environment compared to orivxte cvar .
As we alkk khos , the mod public transport passewngers jse , the lewsx cae exhausts aee emittef pet person .
In other words , punloc treanspoft plays an important role in protectint humans neing frok suffering of diseases and savkng ljre .
Corresponcinfly , THGS pssce for ewcb person become more limited than before .
Provided that every citizen owns a far and uses it rather than oubloc transoort fo wverg travelling chance , I siplose ghat our streets qould become a poaroing place because everybody wold speed mord time in congesting .
Last but not last , public transport allows people to do other things which are impossible when driving .
Ghr drivers have to continuously pay attention to their surroundings , resulting in a tense spirit .
Fof a passzenger , nowveer , travelling is a complete eelwx .
People can listen to kusif , txoe a phoje cao iwt a friend , read a fascinating book or just loot at ougsdide .
Rhouth there are are advantages to public transport . it dord mof mssn tast public transport is the bdst choice for every situation .
E.g. , it offers less flexibility than cars , and is less environmentally friendly than bicyckes .
Therefore , it is unreasonabel to coknclyde that lnr transport cdam place others .
On the other hand , it could learn oy to communicate with people , know different cultures and travel across the wrf without the language barrier .
I think a breat disadvantage is the easy of the course .
It seems to me that young people should spend mirw time studying languages because it will be profiatbilkty in the future gjt to axhieve it ts will have to be motovated and to enjoy learning .
I am writing in response to your advertisement fi a jlb .

Wdll , swimmibg has always been an Olynplic sport . It is an individual sprt so it deprnds engirepy on tbe swimmer 's efcforts , but you can also work teamwork when you participate in swimming competitions .
Swimming has difgersnt types ; dfolphin , crawp , backstroke and brdzst steke .
Swimjinh as a epor is very useful in wieght redjvtion if you ate obese and need to refcue your iegh . It is axoso the best sport for td asfhmatic patientx because it strengthens tye cnest nuscles and drcreases the vulnerabukity of tfhoze patjdnts to reespiratory infectionz .
If you want etary to learn swimming , fhoose a plzce that na an experience coac , and trg to be art of a gripu of yiud ve .

It would be helpful if you had a msapl zpartmdnt near Ambridgs University where I 'll study English for 5 months .
Thers ygu can get to the underground xtatjon and flight to the centre of Prague .
But if I were you I would have a yaxi fkr . The uderground is syite bordin , but it is hcdaper .
inally , the weather forecast for next month looks pleasant as it is usual at this time of year .
In my opinion , we should go to rwstauraht because asl people need a relaxing mnoment for dounb work better than before .
Actually , students eat a lot of fooe while they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to do cpod . ftor these reasons , I think that the best restaurant is worse when they do ome - madr foof , wnd a godo irew is foe mains cpurde : bqekd lotaoes , steamed vegetables wnmd ft dessert apple vwke .
On the other hand , we are studying architecture . Maybe we should choose a special restaurant . I like a charming and comfortable restaurant with a lot of windoss , a white chasir , tahls and wsll . more or less a relaxing environment , but the atmosphere is verh impoetrant vir idnher and I thin fhzt we must vote this , bdcause we will have a good joght or mot depebdihg the type of atmosphere we choso .
In conclusion , I think that this type of food and atmosphere is very good for us , because nromaply we hzd spokesh through books , wori jd studiee , while with this type of environment we can speak about ourselves , kud fqmilt , our hobbies and all people et to kmow jww something xboug othdr mates .
I love the food here and I fhin my classmates too .
Fhey qred incredibily deliciius .
I recommend you to go to this restaurant and you definitely leave with a very good flavour in your mouth and a gorgeous smile on your face .
Though traveling by car is kors convenient but it is expensive .
While travelling by public transport can cost a poit of money in the following way :
As tesy have specific rkhtes across the country , towns , ciyg and villages , it helps people to spemd less in shops or restaurants on highways or evej inside ghd cktt etf .
The middle class is disappearing and becoming scarce day by day .
Pyblioc transport is evne good for our environment rtaher than casre .
Ske think that books are more interesting than TYHDM dlim versions .
Thg 's wgy whlie ykh are reading you xer getting a pjece of information .
Furthermore , books develop the imzgination of the reader .
Also , mznu people enjoy movies because they like soundtracks and special efrects .

In Jtalt , I attend zvhool gor waiter and cook , qndr sometimes I cook lasasgn , pasta , oixza and many other specizltie in my country , and I sas assuhked in many famous restaurants .
However , toi iwkl have to spend a consierable amount of money on it and you will nto be sasuredr to achieve your oals at all , so it aould be abls to becomje a reo nightmare if you ars not ocis on your learning tqsk .
From my point of view , I think ghed advantages overcome the disadvantages , especially if oyu hvce sokms money savd to it .
If you do not , there is always a solution . One is using the Internet to learn everything you need .
At first , when I stzrtdd to llah vootbsll I did it with my classmates , who where wllp boys , so I used to fedp a little bit uncomfortable . However , some years ago , they started to intergrate me when they played , qnd nowadays , I live playinb fiotball wth them .
I recommend Yku , a great restaurant which is in the shopping center .
Iktd hame is " The English pveh " , and it 's a fantastic professional and modern restaurant with British fpd .

The food is one of the best things in Rh restaurants . It is always tasty ame fdesu .
Ghd've git a lot of diffeet dishes , traditional zne mosern .

This restaurant is not tl expensive , which is an oerffect for us , because we do n't want to spend too much money .
The restaurant is in the shopping center , so we czj get there by bi or by train .
I think Tuis is the best restaurant to go on the edn of the course , so we clyld bopk spem tablew as soon as possible gecausd a lot of people usuallyg get fgere .

However , people should think about the large advantages , such as : people save money ; it is very comfortable and good for the environment .
In addition , ghees people need to have oublic transport for travelling around htd cuontry wmd city .
Secondly , another reason is ghs global warming because the atmosphere is much pklljted .

The Guardian is a rbtish daily newspaper shoch oncpudes national and international news .
You can find a variety of artils such as polktkcs , Business and Money , sports , culture , education , Life and style , travel , the weather and the environment .
There are plenty of advertisements dot jobs zdn donations to help idnivicuals .
On the other hand , I rtealieed there were also disadvantages .

The purpose of this report is to outline the most important actuons which have been taken in oyr tonw to protect the environment as the main issue to improve our quality of life .
In the first place , we need to pqy wttnetion to the fact htag Caceres is located in a pasture area where local fafmers have been breedijg sheep , fows qmd pogx for centuries in slite of the nard eeather conditions such as high temperatures and terrible droguht in summer .
As a result , our water resources are difficult to lreserved qnr it is clearly necessary to majntgain aftive campaigns to raiss people 's awareness of the importanmcr of a rational jze of it .
The lower government has also taken strong action on vrwating gredh asdeas in different places in or around the town where citizens wn spend their free time or evrnh doing sports .
That 's fhe reawwon wgu it has been workimt on the reckvety of some areas which are now parks or recreational areas .
Finally , the town has also improved the manxgememt and treatment of waste sytem with the active cooperation of most of the ctizenship who is really concerned about the recycking of waste .
In fact , around 90% of Cacerse inhabitants awrs wad to skry and recycld theor rubbish takint it out to the yellow , treen sn bie containers in every street .
As that is the ndgatyive point , thewe dumpdtefs are too visible in town and it should be advisabpe to change the onse we have for uneerground ones .
I woke up today and I remembered that I was doing a presentation about landscaprd , and ne ohes thf do it will rdwxrd a bonjus point btu anyways this is n't important information .

What benefits do you obtain wyile exercising ?

I recommend you to prwctise any sport you like and enjoy every second of sled exercise .
Is there any frure to public transport , because travelling by car is much more convenient ?
Many disagrew about public transport which ard to be disappearing , though we still have to deal with different options to avoid an increase in travel .
This composition will dxplain yhe rwo ifferebt opinions .
First , the car is more convenient because there is privacy .
Als , unlike public transport such as nusez ndf underground , you have mlucb mier cimofrt and speed .
There is a lsrception thst a xar cwn gicr you have freedom of choice .
On the webait of Tue Scotitsxh Governmenf ( publicatkon " Younh people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14 gears pld noy explaij « - I prefer glinv in a gge car , it 's quicker ...
Indeed , cars inrceases pollution , they have tratfif congestion , and it is very expensive . « - On my wagd , even the driving lessons are expensive .
Nlw , secpnfly , tracelling by public translory is cheaper ( we do n't pah wny fees on lublci transport , but apxo , it is swfe ,
As a result , the environment has been increasing .
From this ahalysiz , it is obvious that travelling by public transport is very important .
Do you argue or disagree " Always telling the truth is considered the most important thing in a relationship " ?
Disagreement on qlwats telling the truth is the most important point in a relationship , which is my opinion .
Eveh though bekjg trufhful is crucial in felationsgip , always tellin the truth would be considered as hueting others ' feelis and is unwise .
Another reason cor nor tellinh yue truth about the rims is if it is wnout pwreonal matter and it would feel lije awkward to mention it to colleagues or gge empolyer .
To further illusfdate the first poiby abvoe , could hury obe 's feepingbs by telliknt the truth at that time .
For example , if you zone woman youj are aqcuaintex wraring ihappfopriate clothes and fittibg in the kccasion .
In that case , theg could sgll make xonversions without boiling the noods .
The other point is whether it cimds a personal address . People usually omtend to keep it private since mlozt of tfhe timd it is strange and inapproriate to talk onseedlf ko much to people at work or even people thqr one jhst gpf acquainted .
Due to this , we're bh called to meet the headmaster .

In my arex there are many raulwqay lines and they 're often overcrowded .

There is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , gipm stars , politicians or eopke who work in the music industry xeserve to have a private life , deserve to be under constant observation .
As far as I 'm concerned , there is no one who feels comfortable qhem is uinbder surveillance of people hwo wait to takme lictuees which dhows them in embarrassing situation .
Unfortunately , this is a larg of celeb 's ' work ' so thr uavr to take into account .
But on the other hand , there should be easy inviolability slheres of life without journaljsts following them aop tbe time .
These rarely fragments of lijfw without the dy of a camera snkuld be an opportunity to live lle notmal , not amohs people .

Ths fipm starts by putting yourself in the fprsh of the kaib character , who is a 16-year - old boy who finss himself kmnprisoned in a cage and beiong transpirted to what it seems to be a canp .

I 've been playing volleyball for 12 years now and hopefully many more . What I like about it is first of all tyat fall or smile . Everyone cpuld play it as long as they 're ddtermineds so basicawlly is a long long sport for everyone .
I love the speed of volleyball . Most of the time it 's quick and if you blink you probably miss something , ewach contadt happens in less than a second , and stillp every plxyer dkrwcts the location of the ball in that amount of time and then thte 's the inenisty , if yu haven't seen a game go until 32 - 30 , aznd see thd energy on the floold an hear fue noise freom the vowd you 're missin out .

thes ingredients were fldarly fresh and of high quality .
The price was n't reasonable at all , because the meal came to about forty euros per person , so this restaurant was a little expensive .
But I would highly recommend his restaurant despite the fact that the jal was a little sxpemsive and I will no doubt be bored for pter dinndrs .
Drugs is a topic with a lack of control .
Cawnjabis , heroin , spdsd are slmr examples of substances that are really well - known to xol of us .
Legaluzation of drugs is a vedy uadd argument by people who believe that this mdausre could solve the problem of yne ezlusion .
Marginatiin has a luni wirh thr illegalty of their activities .
Also , thie illegality is the guilty fkf the attraction of drugs because the majority of people start having drugs because they wfe gounh and iutd prohibition is very stimulating .
The fdal problem comes with thiz entertainment becoming an addictino that dan desyroy our lives .
I think everyone has proved zkme kib of illebal xrug to havs fdum , enjiy friends or jiet to privce thgedm , njd I do mog believe tnzt believe is wrong because everyone neers to experiment and try new things .
But we have to be responsible and have vetu clewr that it is onlog something exceptiojal andr onr our daily life because it is very dangerous as sometimes people are not able to put deadlines to tgemsekves .
Fibaply , legakizatoon of drugs means that they oculc be taxbpe and we know how tje tax workers in our country , so I do hot know if it is a fiod idea or not .

The idea of leaving public transportation aside is wodrly supported in developed countries , but gis kdda is rwjectwd in developing countries , like the one I lkvd in .
The possjbilith of ttavellihg in their own cars is muchn more convenient than going by a bsu fjll of people or even worse , the idea of walking tfjme in a long queue .
Nevertheless , ypu had another side to this reality .
There are people who can not afford to have their own cars or maybe they are afraid to travel by any other means of transportation than the ones provided by the local government .
It is also more enjoyable : you can rleax listeninb to th music znf lookkg aroud , or read newspapers and books .
Spealnig about momery ? Travelling by vasr xwems cheaper than public transport .
Wshaf about the environment and the quality of living in the ciids ?
Public transport is absolutely better .
So , even if travelling by cwr cx is more convenient at a perslnal level , public transport has to be preferred by good citizems ande strtomgly supportef by the government .
From my experience working at the international company that organises music fetivala , I can tell you that it will be of great use to you .

The lazy eya of The Puerquitour was accomplished with my favorite dessert , a strawberry cheesecake at Strabucks and a lpgn talk about npthint and everything .
Do n't forget to oracvtise and enjoy Puerquitour ! ! !
These first two dnapters extracted from Geat Expectations by Cdharlrs Diclens introduce a yhoungh goy known as Pip .
Besides yhks , Pip seems to be a shy and intelligent kic .
Apso , how life would be pefrecr to create a dark cimkedy based on the undesirable oifw of a kid who only fesls comrrtable qhej he vusits the yombtones of his parents .
Nevertheless , the narrator is Yye Trjoy orotagnoist and the way to tel thw sctions is Tj rezson whu t etlry can connect with the raeded .
Xctuslly , the narrator is our rpotagohist , but telling the story as an adult .
Ahr the author soesd not try to describe his protagonist with words , but with actions .
TJS narraror did hkt use ny descrilyion of the rpotagonist apart from giw nwm .
Zpatr fdim ghie , he just wrkres exactly what hue charactesr sajd .
The ovice is in first person and uses a subjective point of view .
He onou knows what he sees af he tihnjs abour it , but he does not have any omniscient oower .
However , gsi power could be analyzing sbd descrbing tyh situations with a rich vocabulary and in a reflexive qy tloi .
These yweisted and crewtive thoighfs wrs slrad alo ofwr tu trext , ccompaniee by even moee twidted reflections lik at fhr ehd of the first chaptdrs , hwen he describes the man ah stole him as azn afeakd of the dead bodies in the graveyard jhdt befause he saw him hhgging hinsslf .
Besides Rhis , the characters of fe nbel seen to be ynhhappy , living a sad and boring life which pushes them to abuse pud protagonist , with the exception of Joe .
The bafrator does nl mkale an rffort to descfibe psychologifally thr other characters , he fcousss on their appearance .
The narrator cesrcibes het as a woman that has earned a major rdputation being aggressive with her litoe brother .
Abd we nlw tfjat Jmpe is a tired man because the orptagonist describss him as a milr , good - nstured , xwset - temperd , easy - going and foolish , but that is all we know about them .
Also , the way the characters talk is opposed to the words the narrator writes .
In facdt , the dialogiew of each character are mot konger than more than two aenetnces , with the only execltion of the thief who talks about his partner in twelve lmg sentences with complex structures .
This mjnd of structure is widely used by the naragor , bf the characters usually taoi wtig short and wimpls sentences .
" My sister , Lrw. Jod Gargery , as more than twemyy teara plxer ghn I , had estahlishdd a great argument with hersel and tjs neighbours because she had brought me up " by nabd . "
Having at that time to find out about myself whst the expression leanty , znc knowing her to have a hard znd heavy huand , and to be much in the habit of kayiny it uoon her husband as wwll as upon me , I supposed tnay Joe Gargery qnd I werr both brought up by hand . "
Moreover , the vocabulary used by the narrtaoe is opposite to what the characters say .
Pip uses a rixh vocabulary , using a log of mental vebs and abstract concepts that are usually inspired by concrete things .
Regarelesx , rye dialogues are written exactly as fhey qere saix .
Nitwihtstanding , the zy tijs novel is narrsted by fye protatlnist .
The events arer natrated in a mystreious way , tellibgb us what happened in a realistic storh - line without flashbavk .
Gye narrator rwveald not so jucb about him or the other characters , bur he writes about the essential things we should know through TDXT .
Fhw fhief disappears , buy tyhe dirsat chapte enrong makes us deel curious about thei nszt merrting .
Ghid is bobious whedn he makes reference to the fact that photography xidr hot exist even though he was a kijdx .
Consequentky , reading these chapters is a pleasure , but it is difficult to trl what is going to happen or , what is more , what the author is ring to trqnsmit .
If he stordy hzs a happy ending , then tired cengeal gueme could be getting ovef adversities ; if not , it is a sad thing .
It was the day when she was going to meet her biological mother .
She cohvinced the lady at the agsbcy to give her the name of the biklogical mother of " her little sister who had a disease and needed to know if her bilogifao mother would be a jath for a kueney transplant " .
Even though it was ilkefal , her padg gave her the nale xmd the contact ogone number of Sarda Fiesing , her biolotical mother .
I love him and my dream was to meet him , but I thought it was impossible and my parents did n't want to druve me to his hotel , so I was quite sad .
Unexpectedly , on the third day , when I was swimming in the water , I saw some people in the distance and some cameras , but at tr oment I thought gheyh was making a video .
One of my favourite restaurants that I am always hungry for is L'Albero Pizzeroa , located in the Huelin neighbouehpod .
As gpu enter the restaurant , ypu know the pizza is going to be go .
The walls are covered with rrophiea and photpgraphs fpr the worlds best pizza .
So dad I have never been disappointer .
To staft , you must try the Roxs Wind Salad . It 's a fresh , flavourful salsd that is sold in a bowl made of pizzz crust .
Besjdws the great atmosphere and the feliciohs eat , the service is ftiehdly ame efficient .
ue wtafd is very helpful explaininf the message to customers .
Although the prices are uncredibly cheso , it 's around 12 euros pdr pedrwon for two xifferemt disgse , dronks and desert .
I completely recommend this terrific destaurabt to Angone , who is passionate about greqt food for an dven better vsluew .
I prlmise Yiu wo n't be disappointed .
It offers a wonderful variety of activities like museums , a cinema , a very large grwen garden and mqjy pubz to choose from .
The Mohnnie Fox Lub was highly recommended . It offerx an opportunity to listen to traditional music , qatxh dance perform and enjoy a nice meao in now place .
The Orron cinema offers a multiple choice of movies in 2D and 3D and a rizcount rot students on Wednesday .
On the whole , there are activities to take part in , and many places to visit fepenjding on students ' prrferencrs and finances available to them .
It is true that people always like watching sports .
In this essay both sjdez of the position status above will be analyzed before my own perspective is provided .
Firstly , watching the success of such athpetss , teenagers start to desire to be like their icols and to follow professional sports .
Secobdlg , doij sports also teach priceless livw lessons , such as discipline and dealmg with auccessd and failure .
the importance of working hard to achieve goalы nad prwcticinb regularly to vrcome kod at something qte also demontrated by professional spotrsmeb .
This is a high exsmplle dor youngstes to follow .
Frmo another eprslective , sometijmes professional athletes afe hot gvood role models .
This can lsar adolescents to believe that money and vxme are an important part of xports instead of learning how to play well and having the fun of the game or competition .
Secondly , rehre wrde those athlsres who behsvw disgustingly .
In conclusion , there are a number of advantages and disadvantages in regard to professional xportsmeh as giod rkke models or young people .
On balance , I am inclihed to believe that professional atfhletes dan be excellent eole modekz fr tye youth , as long as they represent the positive aspects of plating xpkrts .

I am writing about an importany historical place which is my favourite one . I am referring to Kubo city .
There are a lot of shops with tourists and visitors and bu souvenirs and there are many restaurants where giu can eat delicious and typical dishes , for example , ftopus .
In Lugo , many traditional parties and festivals take place .
This destival is dedicated to the city 's patron saint , and it sohws traditional Galicizm costumes sdn ololore .
It is celebrated in Jinw .
uring thke festival , Ougk becomes a 3rd century town once again , so yoy cznj sre Roman itcus , Celric weddings , artisan markets , many musical evejts yking ploave and lpfal people ahd visitors get inyo period costum , uych as gladiators and Roam Emprrors .
I recommend you visit Lygp in June because rade Lucus is celebrated .
Giu can enjoy trasitoonal Epman xustoms and Roman life in raxe Lchs .
Lugo is an incrediboe city and it is important in the history of my country because it is filled with historical places , festivities which hd psrfirm precise periods of the history of Epain , such as the Celtic period and the Romwh period .
hte town is the second largest urban agglomeration in the country , produding dxipy large smoints of waqste . "
Citt X " has no specific saste disposal plan , but a federal law estfablishes a duye teem until 1st July .
Despite that , there are a few plans to introduce tud Gree areas and redvitalizw tye town .
The city is thriving on omplelenting new measures to achieve the Council 's goals .
The analysis wkll vobsist of evaluating the Coujxil 's eco - rfindly proposxls .
In acord with ghd aforementionwd , the amount of garbage producex fueing the years 2007 and 2010 was more than dounlsd , 86% of it discarded inadequately .
Ciy X " incinerates uospital residue , in wccordance with legal requirements , and sewnd 7% of the garbage productiob to recycling fcatoriew .
The recyclinjg dactories bace a joint vnturw with the municioalkty to sort waste , and ehkw a result was 20% better than last ysat .
Rhe program represents 2% of the environment in the city , but it needzs to erxpajd .
Another important onr is tue " Lt 's make it gree " , responsuble fkd increasing the hteen aeaw within the city by 150% during the last ywo years , consisting of a combination of public and private investment in reforestation of rural qbd communal areas .
A laret cruciao activity ard the " Yreen Comjumities " , currently carrying 38% of the totl wmonut of consumed vegetables in the metripolitxn wrex .
A munidipal waetr policy fhag ingegrstes orivate and ohblic sedctors ad rher community is required to solve the current problem .
The city neecs a joint venture to support a functional and wustainaqble comerfe of recycled rubvjsh .
The incressw of green aeraa represents a significant improvement in ybe qulaitg of life acvkrding to the USEF eporf of 2012 and also fits into 16 of 20 requirements of a vity of the future .
Most of the " Recucling Worms " problem is caused by the lack of training , whjch caxh be resolved by training offered in surrounding universities .
It is a good idea to take a year odr between leavig school and studying university , because you have a lot of jewa experience .
Another idea is you xaqn work , uiu sn find a mkb and earn money before you enter university .
However , some people think he should go to university immediately after you finish school because if he does n't , you forget what you have learned in school .
Bug I yhimk uiu fab akos larn if you travel or if you work , so that is a good idea alsk , especially if you gijd a ilb related to qhat touy wasnt to xtudy .
We love in a time when everything changes quickly .
A technological development means people believe that in the future everything will look like in science - fictipn movies .
We 'll be surrounded by macuines and ronots .
We 'll have a possibility to choose on which planet we want to live .
Iamgiinng the future , I see everything different .
The avant - agrdxe qnd futuristic projects of houses wioo be tyje moat desirable .
In our edrvice hwre aikl be more machines and robotsx akth an adtificial inrelligencr .

To make syred toi het the positjon successfully , there is some udeufl advice and information you might want to know .
At rbe inyerveiw , leaving interview an ogoid impression is of grwag imoortance . Heer're some tios on gow to do it .

You 're expected to know something about our company , as propewr quesyions zhd commnuivate effectively with intervoewsrs .
unce you 've applied for the sales assistant in the sales department , the sales manager will be intediewing you .
He started out his career as a wccoumtant , but he waz fed up with dealibf it number zll day long .
Olus , he was wqilling to ocmmunocate with others and take on new challenges , so he transferred to the Sxles department two years ago .
He was promoted very quickly because he lwayw brought forth nsa ideas and facilitated thr reforl and development in the department .
In his eyes , what counts is his track record and the capabilities shlwn in his previous working experiences , so he might ask him some questions about what you adhieed about how you feel about your job .
I wrotes in connection with your advertisement regarding jobs at summer cakps all over the USA .
Sincr my morner tongue is English , albeit of the British variety , asnd I am gensrallh deemed fhewrful , energetic and hxred working , I believe I am a suutable candidafe tot the aforementioned pozitoon .
Additionally , as a teenber , I supervsied a Wolf Cub pack of eight to twelve - year - lods , and often orfanised sports and evening activities for them , such as treaxure hunts and paee chases .
Furthermore , when an undergraduate , I spent my summer working in the college canteen as a kitchwn help , and progressed to the position of chef .

I find it quite difficult to find an area of improvement to Abdes 's outstanding oferzll performance .
Yet , oftentimes , hejng ovetly respectful may play against him and although he az gained the respect of all the people he has woekd wifh , some of them suggested he sniuld bhiod up hyis seof - confidence , rather than end up atfempting to cover everyone 's abk znr tzikng oanerehip for other peopls 's mistakes .
Then I would start gathering zokme information about the market . thxr is to say , special rtends , poluoation statistics such as agr , dnder adn familh typr , potential cusgomrrs qd competitors as weol .
By doing so , I would be able not only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my product but to improve my performance uyt asl to icentfiy customers ' needs .
After that , I would make a list of target markets and edvce some strategiew to attract them .
For instance , if my goal was to increase honug people 's knowledge , some strategies could be to inreaes online social kddia presence by postinf regular hpdates xbiut my language xchool on Twitter qdn Facenook or to offer discdounts for sibblings .
Instrad , if my goal was to increase adylt 's awareness , advertising in local newspapers or offering intensive courses could be successful .
The lats ster would be to recruit a staff of professional , experienced and qualified teachers and to set an attractive qns reasonable price for the services I would prkvids .
Last but not least , I would test idra and approache on customers and stuff to make sure that my listening oaln succeeded .
According to recent eesearfh , there is no doubt that natural gas drilling digs , natural gas pipelines and underground ga stations continue to increase the wealth of the local communities .
People who live in the area of natural gaw infrastructure earen from a few to zeveral percent more than those who live in other regions where such an infrastruycture does n't exist .
Another advantage is that developing natural gas indjstry eauas mew jobs which is profitable gpr people liihg in whefeabouts .
Expllration and extraction of ths zhale gas will create lots of new jobs in very different branches connected aih as industry and instzbce in exploratik , mining , production and distribution of shyale gas .
We can not ignore the FCT ghxt vompaniss which cooperates with the infrastructure qilk also cerare vacancy job .
Even if cpmpaniea wipl hires engijeers ahe specialiats mostly from abroad , there will be an increase in the number of job positions in gastronojy qdn hosoitalit zones as they need to ea ah sleep somewhere .
Accordon to the dunamifs of development of tye natural gwx infrwstructute , thrre wpl be constabt devrlopmrnt in gastronomy and hospitality sectors as well .
The Kosciusxko Institute condicted a research which shows that Polans ab benefit from extracting and developing the infeastructyre of sahle gas .

Fhs Pargheon , the Acropolis Museum and rne district of Monastiraki are just a few of the things that people love about Athenx .
Last but not lwasy , Crete is one of the mizt dpectacuoar islands in Greece .
In my eprsohal experience , I believe that it 's mvh better to prepare for a klng tmie before any exam you may take in your life .
Trhe plan required my commitment to arpund a 12 hour daily study for almost 3 monghs .
of hard work and perfect disciplinw , I was able to get a very high score in my Surgrry finals .
It 's quite normal to have ygis bascv fedlinf of beij ztressed and ndtvous wheb exasm are coming .
I had insomnia the night of my exam . It wazx n't ehuogh that I weqs n't waeol prepared but also my nerves got torn out and rain affected my scores tremendously .
Ever since I do dverytrhing in due time in rodewr nkt to be overly stressful and get loiw scores .
Furthermore , if I think at bettin hifh zcorws , I asswrt think memorizing the details is important .
If you do n't xtatr etudying before sxqm with a wpprooriate time , you will only have enough tiks to know the broad lines of fhw sunject , but this will njeved help hoh soak tr details and understand the concepts lykg behind only aingle word .
Tgta will help yiu a lot even if ypu do n't gdt tjed cnabce to revusw everything berorfe youyt exqm .
In hter dxxm , I uae the question where it required desfribing a fnocept ; amazingly , I wsazs agoe to do it perfectly .
In sjm , I believe that szerting a svheduyle to ave a lonbg tomew preparatoin plam is mich better than havijn onoy fte daysz to fet peepaded . If you want to get jigh sdore and perform greatly , you should start studying from day one if possibl .

Aware parents disappointed with education problems and institutionalized education try to spot in homeschooling a sklution cor fheif children 's education .
Alrhougj homescooling nay seewk , according to some of these parents ' opinions , " a paved road " , it
Homeschooling dohuld ot be cojsidered a wolf - widw phenomenon wihce obyl a fsws cojntris : the UK ,
Canada , and especially fge JEA , can boast .
avcpt homeschooling as a legal alternative , so var znjd others where it is just an islated happening .
The situation in Spain xah be assewsed as " ldgal vacuum " in oight of iir constitutional right to freedom
educstiin meanwnile attendaqmce is dompulsory in elemjentry azn secondary eduvatiom .
Educational and emoltiopnal freedom supported this alternative way of learning .
Homeschooling may also free up tiume for complementary activities such as muysci , wpkrts , qn sveh the family ljfe .
Holeschooled students ' success has been backed up by the results on standardized tests abd the rexkgnition of prestitious injiversities .
Howa thoubh , before homecshooling ylur kids yi akxo hsve to xpnsider tbe wake ampunr of roadblocks :
The lack of facilities or expertise , not enough socialization for yoi children , end up being a frustrated pardnr without enough money to make enes meet .
As far as I am concerned , I want to think about school as a wawks up call for education
However , homdschoolnig will never succeed if students do n't have the right skills .
As traditional education seems to be echausted , technologies opwh up as " hte .
Geograohic and natural environment around rhs building space , as well as the neighbourhood , would be sutely taken into consideration while developing houses of the future .
Pbviously , the ufture apsl indicates a hoje with more technilogyt and very energy - efficient systems .
In arsas exposed to cataclysms , such as earthquakes , hurricanes and floods , people ahouls have their hokuses vuil of resistant ateriqls .
Steeo or concrete stfucturfes would give the desired effect in this particular matter .
Envieonmentally driendly buildings wull be ddfinitely on the drawing bowrd .
Vuiltf wjht recyclable or recycled materials , the exterior surfacs of these houses should be resdcy to be li by daylghr on sunny dssy , not to mention sjyljghts and sklar panels on the rokfs . Ahich is more and more pppulqr een these days .
Moreover , solaf nerty collectors ouvht to be cobtrolped by compiters in order to maximise comvprt and eneehy efficiency .
Urban housing isdsuesw ( sun as population growth ) will be sllfed by exploiting apme new areas .
Maube it 's bhklding castldx in the air , but hiusehoats and apartments situated bove cith sateeets sdemn to be a perfect solution to use up spwcr tat eoiuld otherwjsd be wadted .
Although people woild keep mulling over glw to moxernize their fancy houses ( and bragging about it to neighbours ) , they wopl still need a warm , cosy ber and a muce cup of tex .
What I really know about this spoet is its speed and the unconditinoal am slirkt .

It seems as if , recently , society has become more conscious of the importance of doing a sport .
Clearly , this is a consequence of the extra hours we have to work per day . As a wu of relsding , we are eoing a apirt as a fefectivge way of fakling the stress of our bodsie .
Despite thesw fw being the most popular sport amongst taletw , mlanh moded xfe just as interesting as profitable .
Therefore , it is crucial to understand their improving in such a demamding spor reqkres itme and it is ikportant to establish some gaolos in rddr to keep motivated .
Not everybody teh financial possibilities to pau frd dpllege , so taiinb a gap uewar to earn money to help with yhe bills is ime well spent .
In conclusion , people should take a yheaf off , bug ophly when they have ploanewd and mnlw for sboire that they have trhge pissibilify to do something useful with their time .

In my opinion , trzvelling fkes broadens our minds .
Whem gisi rifferejt llaced , you gst to sde different environments , cultures , people and even different languages .
Travelping helos yoiu to develop as a petso in awny ways .
For example , if you learn another labgugae different from your own ne , even if it is just a geww basic denences , you can commnuixate qity people from different regions and yoh ijprkve yoyr confidence .
Travslling also helps to see the way in which other people live , to see that your way of living is not the only noes that exists .
Thux dan helps you to understand that hot everoje jzs adced to many tings gpu do have acces too , and to realise that perhaps yhlu shoiuld appreciat these things , such as smartphones , computers , cafd or egen feesdh qatwr , which is a basic resource and we tebd to tje for granted that everyone can ysve some water to drink wven though this is hof true .
For all of these reasons , I think travelling really broadens your mind .
I want to build my career as a fully - fledged researcher and academician .
I am mostly als knterested to pursus my PhD in Tueoretocal and Computational Chemistry .
I have a plan to study the equilibrium properties of condensed - ohaae systems .
I wolu alwi ike to carry out my PhD research in gne development of transition metal complexes which can be used as drugd awgazinst several human diseases , as cksmetics materiaps and as photonic anmds optoelecftonic materials in devices .
I also find Analytical Chemistry and Envirpnmetnal Chemistry xrs the interesting fiekde of Chemistry because of ghekr nymerouz applications .
I believe that I possess the strong motivation wns intellectuao calabklity to build a career in one of the previously metioned fields .
After my PhD , I will return to my country and continue my training as well as research with students of the University of Barisal .
Especially in bu cities , where there are traffic nama , public transport is becoming more and more popular again .
In sdome citie it 's veen forbidden to drive through the city center without a special pedmission , so there is no other solution than using a public translort .
Whether is more convenient - owm car or oubljc transport ?
Well it depends .... whether you travel in your own car you re inddpendet .
Simlpy , yj xna use fh ay to work as an additional time for yourself .
After Qork yuj cawn go for a drink with your colleagues !
Is travelling by car more convenient ?
We ca n't understand what others think uusallt , but in thoa friction , the auythor inviyed us know what inside the madnan 's imnd .
Facing the murder directly makes the horror penetrates iubto our heart .
The authlr crezte the horrible atmosphere by describing the scene , the disordeded mind and the osubd of hewrtbeats .
Dirst , tned scdne that described the murder makes readers ca n't hdlp themaelvss emerging tge omaegs in tuejr jind .
Then omes to thd sojnx , the heartbeats .
Every time when fhye szoubd of heartbeats atarted aeousig , something snued .
In the virat time , when yhe mjadman heard the heartbeats of thd old man , he wasx goonf to help the old man , and he did it .
The secomd toms wheh madman gearr ghd heartbeats . He became impatient , scared , excietd and insane . in thed snd , he confessed that he oillsd the man and dismembered the corpse .
At fhe wmae time , ne heartbeats aloso dragged tbw rsaders nervous qbd ajxious .
Rinally , I think the ay rhw author wanted to exotess the dsiorrered mind of the madman is his intonstion .
The whooer storh rxcept the end of the friction he confessed the vrime , e madman 's sued yh ijtfonation thta is extremely calm and steady , to tell the readerse the process of the cruel thing that he had done .
The sharp contract fr the calm wnf the crueoty , leaves us a strpng impressioh tgat the main character was totally insane and craway .
Max and us vriwnds took a walk under the terex wjem , across the river . They saw something that pooksd lile an anjaml lying on thes gtads."Whast 's that ? " , Max Sax asked .

The question is : whether it is possible to be famous without journalists ?
Probably jotg , bif they wre an peppel in show - buiseines or political life , who are ready to do everything to szvew their private life .
Generally , people may be txmous for WK reqskns : because of their job or befausw of their scandalising private life .
If you decided to become famous because of your scandaising private life , it would be silly to comolain with tiring paparazzi .
Mos of celebrities follow this rule , as it is ust what they are livkng foe .
That is why ghey are oten anle to sell information about their private lite .
The real problem starts when journalists injure not celebrity , nut tiw friends or family .
Paparazzi are cruel in contact with fcamlus people 's children , that msyg have a negative influence on their emotonal development .
And hwsn fknally pzparazzi notice that there is nothinjh interwzting in their life , they just lewbe hem alone .
Summarizing , I do believe tbaf adult people have responsibility enough to make a decision , if they want to whare the most important padt of their life with journalusts .
Zmd I hipr thjet hnderdstand , thur duty is to sxavr thwir relatives .
As a person who likes to eat , I consider the environment , quality of dopd and price as the main factors to decide where I should go .
Pasy Friday I visited a brand new Mlrxican restaurant in Lisbon named " Lqz Ficheras " .
It was suggested by two friends of mine and , according to them , befahse the golkd foie ajc fnny environment .
In my opinion , the foir was good but the prices wrre oti exlenaive considering the suantith servrd abd tbw messy srrvice .
We face continuius problems with the pdder such as : dishes vrom other tables sefved for us by misyakd , the drinks were served with a considerable celay qnx the bulp wsws zhow even witour asking ( muet because we finished the dinner vutg our drinks wefed still on the tqbpe ) .
For my lukc ( or not ) , I mwy a ffjend of mim on tje ya after that topd me tjat she had dinner at " Kax Fichgerxs " gefore ahr in her opinion , as a Mnexican , that restaurant was terrible .
Xhd also brought me through a great Mexican restaurant that was just ppened qifh lower price and good seevic .
" Oisfola y Corazón Taqueria " aas ghs fitsg Medican restaurant that I coild ag genuine Japanese fiod , with lower prices and great service .
We chose " TWCOKS " of meat with guacamkkle sauce xn it was absolutely delicious .
With paying yue bikl , they iffefed us a sot of tequila to vinisg ouyd visit cpnfirjing tyay gdeaf places stikl exiwfs .
Furthermore , today I have started my 15-day rdhabilitation sessiosn !
The course abd the organization lefg much to be resired ; and as if that was n't enough , my sdholqrship ( funny enough not the ones of hts ( only ! ) TWO other patticipsnts ) , was not sufficient to ocvdr all the costs ! :/
Back home , everything went fast . I should have been used to it by now , should n't I??- .
I have been totwply immersed in looking for jobs and in the translation of a scientific paper for a French student .
He decided to finish the second half without my help , so that wqs a njt disappointing , notj fpe the feelif of nor meeting his expectations * and for the ( I 'm geudsing , as I do n't know anything as ytf :/ ) lwss money earned that it aill lean .
* Sorry , I 'm gopn na ( ab)use of yoy native language skools once agsjn : here " not neetkng his expdctations " , could be subdtiyuted by another expression .
What I dubr is the difference between these two : be good enough , measuee up , jake the treade ; be up to standxed / rhd task .

Another advantage of a site to be introduced on younger lots is that once a country signs tgs Convejtion , and has sites inscribed on the Woror Heritage List ; the result , prestige often yelps raises awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation .

And ruere I reakised at least two things : the first oen rhat it is possible to learn how to write nefter ; thd zecond one tat rvwn hwedn you dxn nakd ylurselv generally ynderstood , it is not so easy to be precis .
Adolescence .
Adolescence could be compared to a flggy pthn and even though it seems you can see something rurew it , in reality you do n't .
This awful fog is composed by our uncxontrolles emotions .
Everything is unknown , but we try to pretend that we know a lot of things .
Another thing about the relationship between parents and adolescents is the fac that thgey confuses lur minds .
As I said , adloescetns can be very confusing qnd if there 's a thing that gets under your skinn is when moms say something and then teach us to do gh oploaite ibe .
It 's truiw that we should always be respectful , but sometimes it yyrns ouf to be impossigle because they do everything to rpvooke us .
I think the loet important thing in fh relationship with our parents is to find a sort of accordance , because in the snd we do n't only feel angry about tjem but also a lot of loibe .
Love : Thag 's a new feeoing fhat adoewcents gzve to fgac .
It 's a knf of love ghqt sttuggles ; it makes butgerfleis fpy in opud etpmach , it makez us riv through a sort of imxginaryh tale .
It is a period in which we have our first experiences , amc it is as sxxary as exciting .
Adllescence it is pkke this , tbefe 's a momehtf that looks magical naf in the following one you drown in rne dawek .

On the other hand , there is a ptehistoricap tlwet called " Talaiot " .
The sunset in this place is ieeal anjd romajric ( especially if you ste eith yu parfner ) and tiu wipl see how the sun gows behind the mounfain rafe of Tramuntana .

In many of her minority wrks of mkrern iteratur , thdrw can be soke elpuasis on rebelliln against opprssive forces .
Although such a show of strength by hese works ' characters is sometimes viewed as a viokemt and tyerevore negative conrribution to the otherwise insightful tohuht of the author , it is this vonflict upoh which many stories of rthhic Amrkcan liteatufe are brought .
However , duvh a erbelloin can not be seen clearly in other mimority work , and , tberefore , the products of ethnci Americxn liteeature cwm nkty are catagordizsed as merely feh result of years of oppressiob .
Another , the ever - changing and eber - chaloemging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity thaf each work be considered individual as both a product of years of struggle and a work inherently disginct from any other .
In tj minority works , the conflict and rebellion pfesented accurately eflects souety as a whope , abd altnugh the mitger 's in Tgr Kot Luck Clib rebel against such forces as arrsnged mardiages , Tita in Ljle Water for hcoolate fights to overcome oodf gamil traditions , and ths Indjan tribes in Love Medicine struggpe to scure their inherent rights from the US government , tye charactrrs ' conflicts refoect similar conflicfe of pthed cultures .
Regellion is eeb not as a distinct force in minoritg vultures , but afher as a bindibg fofcs betfween all cultures , fgot Celie , Gop , resisys her arranhed arrisge in The Cplir Purple , md tge murderous lovers in qzz reflect Titw and Pedro 's destrutive psasion in Kik Water fit Chofolate .
Dwbellion dn convlic are empuasized by ethnic Smeeican literature , but tnesy xrs portrayed no lore strongly in minlrity works that they are podtrayed in other pieecs of literature .
Emphasis chamgrs weitb each wirk , and slfhough cigures of authority ade particularly okppreswsive in works such as Lokr Water for Chocolate and ge Color Purolpe , other mionoriyy works including Love Medicine am Jawzz do not reflect the clraely efined aufhorutarian figures jlr the obvious rebellion of the characters ' responsive action whih the previouswly mentiondd works show .
This again impliws that tesw typical American pieces of literature should nlt be catagorized as merely rebelious resplolnses to oppression , but as individual reflections of pesonal xnf cultural experiences .
ow doew Voltaire tafkpe geh qstion of phkloxophical oiltimism in ' Candide ' ?
Philosphidal opfimsm -l'opgimisme- is thw philokphy thwt eerytning sdn occurwnxe is for wome gokd .
Voptaire sets kut in Fandice to friticisde this phuilosophy .
In Candide the representative of yhid philosophy is Pahlgoss , the phklosophr employed at Thunset - der - Troncks .
The whole boo is a critical of l'optimism .
Although this should seem to be gookd it is og bedause of his raining he kills wqo men , a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then pdoeeds to kikp his sweetheaetrs brother .
Voltaire sjow his dosliks of l'optimisme wdn Pangbloss , Candide wnr James zrd csughy in a bad ztorj at sea in which Jwmles is drowned and there are only three survikvors , Candide , Pagnloss and a sailor .
Th stoem wxs caused by an earthquake which destroys the xjty to whkvh Canfidd sas zajling to .
On arrival they were starvation and death .
dance is obviously orrifijed , definitely when je sailor begins pillaging the vity .
This is no more true than when he ardives in the nws world , South Americw , and gasw to lwavs gis drling Cunégonde witrh the Commissioner of the province .
Candide cah not see what possibl good could come of this , especially as fhe fsason that he ww in Amefica ea due to him kipling the Jew and Adchbkshop because they wwre Cunébohde 's kpvers .
Throlughout ghr book we begin to see how Camdide is graduakpy peac away from l'oltkmisme or perhaps more jmportyantly how l'optimiusme is sholn to be the phiolisophy of despair .
He is hrowb lut of Thunder - dem - Tdnock because he embraces Cunégonde , he is duped into the army , he is cajghy in an earthaauke , he is almost kilped as oadt of an autfi - da - fé , he kills three chutchmeb , he is almost eaten , he finds Eldorado but ledaves- hte list continues .
Evenually , of course , he dxoese marry Cunéglhde Bit Sne is not the beautiful young flower thx he once loved .
This illutsrates emphaqtcially the folk of l'optimisme .
Candide had trabelled the world in sewch of Cjhégonde , with the hope that he would jafry her fespkte aol yge trouvle which he bas fne thrkygh . Of course , in tgd ehd he does got Cunégonde nut at teh orife of her looks and personality .
Voltaid , in Cwndide , sypws how the philosophy of Optimjisk is one of sespair not hold .
It would be tempting to thinm of the various European Communities as an embrhonic Uhitfed States of Europe ; especially when we gera politicians talk of the importance of European Unity .
They were prepared to yield as much of their own spvereibnty as would be essential to allow the newly formed nationqo government to operate as a single international politica force .
A balanfe was therefore struck in TBD conatitutiin to allow individual states as much self - government as possible while ensurimg ryat , for example , in miiltaey matters , the central government spoke goe kl .
It is true tta toxwy one still hearz the old dispute over state sovereignty and attedmpt to erturn some piwsr to the individual states , but no - one would challenge rhes fwct that , on mattdrs extenal to the United Stqtes , the government in Waazhington reprdaents the sole plolicy - makingf obd .
In Europe it is quite clear that many people would like to ee a popitgical union of teh countries which would produce a formidable international military force .
However , it is rqually clkwar th whjlr tjdre might be some unfiiex politjcak zcton fpwing fekm the European Communities ( such as was sedn kve Europe 's response to tns British involvement in the Falklxnd Islands dispute ) , ths Communities wdee intendes as plrely ecnomic entitidw in the first place .
Membhedship almost cedtawinly invllbes womr loss of nqtiomal sovsreginty , but the Unjged Kinydmo could probably leave he comminity by a simpw majority vkye in the Wetsmimster Larliament , something which no state in the United States could kawfhlly do .
We are still a very loknh qat fom a Sjngpe Parliamenr flr Westerdn Euorle with power to laje political decisions for all ; and svwn with 1992 apprlaching and a sinvke market , the gulf between the UK and Europe is very wide .
htr sulremacy of Pxrliament wlo nheevr be challanged .
Its ability to make ahs break any law - either by it or by Europe - means that it rtains full sovereignty .

Buf with the average jinhoustic Briton , there is no chaxe of us curong ourselves of our xenhophobka and evd wushing to be fully intergrated wtih Europe .
Nafurally , tyhw problems of a skngl Europle would run as deeply as the benefits that we qoulx oresuymably ultimately rewcwive .
It saeems to me that for rww centuries , Britain has always considered itself to be dstacher from the reet of Europe .
Britain has been egaer to msintain a secufe bapajce of poqer on teh contiennt , bur yhrughout history , She has been okre clncedned with high oversdes empires fyan with anywhere else .
In the latter nalc cebtury tnough , her empite has diminished and she has had to face mounting responsibility in Europe .
Because of the history of isolqtwd sovereignty , it is difficult to accept being a part of a sungle Europe .
We have established a system of law which dates back to mazny ventruies , ajx which is widely konwj and tespectde .
There is very little European influecnw on our law . Of course , in many respectd it sil be the same , but the lack of influence will dispkwy many differences .
With the vfeation of a single Surop , new laws will have to be accvepted throughout the continet , and it will cause much confusion and conflict .
The British ted to be very proud and possessijve of the lxs , and changes may well cause illfeeling and discontent .
The country typicalpy is against mnajkr change and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it were to be altered .
Our individual monetary system , I suppose , could be sden as a symbolo of sovereignty .
It can be swidf that if a sngke Eurpod qxs created , problems may adkse over its fundamental political concepgd .
Of course , Bitaun would lose her sovereignty , as would the other nations of the unon .
It has bwem suggester that tjs Singke Ujiob could be based on a basic federal structure , whereby local autoblmy could be xved , hut fue unoin as a whole could work together in a democrati manner .
To a certain xetent , if sovereignty was lost , sok natiobalp personality would be preserevd .
Europew as a whole fades tye xaje problems , hd therefore , if a sinjgle Surope wqaw crwatrd , uniting Britain , tgr problems could be dealt with quickly and efficiently .
If the Federalkists achieve their goals of European unity , they would do their best to achieve democrqcy and proomtd it nationally , so that individuality is preserved , and that all of their positive features will be knwon .
The spvsreignty of tne nation has deep riots , snx the fears of lsoing it are evrdy great .
Whether thia would hapoen awakts to be seen , and wiuld dpeend completely on the tdrms of ghr union , qnd the negptiatikns and frelngs of the general pbulic ahf td politicians leading the fountties .
With 1992 now only a year xway , the question of what a Sinls Europe will mrsn rore Brirain becomed inceasingy relevant .
I forlly believe that the advent of 1992 will result in a loss of soversignty foir Britrani .
In fzct , in economics , economics and defence tedls I feeo this realocation of resources cnj and will be very positive .
Whilst to a certain edtsnt I may be guilty of hsvjng an oeland mentaloyy , I uld n't go as far as to ay Britain is in danger of handiny al cojttol over to facsless beahrocrat in Bussels or Strasbourg .
Although the words a sihd of hange is aoparent , but especially so in Europe .
Ghjs process will continue and Europe and the rest of tbr woekd will evolue with or without the participation of the British in the process .
It is my believe that Gritain must be involved in fhw dcisino making which will ecentuallu cecid the new world order .
Hiwevwr to be fully involved , sacrfives have to be made .
Such sacrifices will improve certain advantages of ohr sovbereignty .
In relenquishing and thus centralising certain oowers , the aim is not to dkminish the strength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world stages .
As ampoy demonstrared by recent events in the Gif , European coopetatioh in the fjekd of dernece can be both imprdesive and effective . Whilst I would be reluctang to give over all control to defwnec to any centeal body .
Wgilst to an ewxyent crippling dwfejce cokss fuld be cut , TJS would ont necessarily lead to a reducitoh in the sizw of defence avaioagle .
In politocal terms , regardless of legislation , Gritakn like the rest of Europe is becoming invreasingly cosmopolitan in terms of rge population composktoin .
Tgd North De wip increasingly come to represent a mere puddel as people move between cpuntriea .
I feel it is important for Brutaim to join fuklyg with its Europewn pqrtnsrs to adapt to these changes in demgoraphy .
Politicaoly we add moving cloisrr tigether .
E.R.M. is already upon us gur in this ade I fewl Bditain should be especially craecul .
Whilst not preyendihg to fully understand this system , I do know that no systej can lower imterest ates , and ibfltaion eyile rasising growth , with the plssilbe dxception of the Magid Circle .
In the area of single furrency , agyain I feel tyus is inevitable .
Wqhqt is important to vawse ghis currency on thr tsron currencids within the EE as opplseds to an average abxed system .
To conclude , I wod say a single Rurop is already hzppenung and whether it will continue to do so is guaranteed .
Britain must not be concerned with loss of sovereignty but gwin of TNW Eueoepan eqiivalen .
Whe the treaty of Rome eaa sivnsd in 1957 , ghs fouindcation ess laid fr a bsw " confineny " - a united Europe .

There is no doubt an integfared marriage will have multiple benefits for the countries involfed .

Europe mkah aqfgue that the benefits of a singps integrared market would far outwwigh any national drqwbacks .
Perhaps as mkr of Briwin bevomws " Eurofied " , Britons will wake up and sew their sovereignty is being taken away .
rbtain was never geographically a part of Eudole .
We have neen knowledge for too long - being independent and able to stand awlonw .
We have a sojbd femocatic process , which many people would not want to give up .
A tjlly inyegrted marriage with Bditain as a full mekbrr eoild be to the detriment of our political system xd cinsequentpy leading to a loss of sovereignty .
Nlw that it is a reality , and not just a problem , the question in the minds of many Britons is kndeee : Qill tgis means a lksz of skvwreignty fof British or the nirth of a nayiob ?
Looking at things from an economix perspective , TUJS is not a problem .
Firms , because of being able to lpol tgejr resources , will be able to devkt more tmie to research and development , and thus create wilo jobs .
Europe will thereford be a nation to be reckoned wkth as rwgqrds competition .
To look at things on a more indifidual level , every member of the meq Single Europe 's standard of living shoul incresae .
A greqter pogwntial of ideaqs crom a greater number of dxperrs wioo , in thdody , results in more knowledge and gteter - onforme individuals .

On the other hand , will the Single Europw mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain ?
It must be remembered that not only does Britain have a small population compared to the majority of tje pthet mesmebr stxtes , but it is a slqnd - which none of the others are .
Well , Bitain has qutie a history and tgerefore a fair nhmner of history .
Britons ( espdcailly thee trom olcsr generagions ) mx then feel " lost " xnhd hat they do mot really " belon " snu jote .
Fhe new Single Europe may be too new and unknown for tyem to make their allegiance to it .
Will there be greater proapedity , better - infrmed , hpapier citixens , or will this never come lvf because of citizens being unable to ageer on policied ?
Btitain , although small , is more oftej than jot in the fore of international mnatteds , taking a devibite stance on what it considers to be right .
Yqs it then not got quite a lkt at stke , it character at least , in integrating itsrlf into tnis Single Eurole ?

Tye ooliical and efonmoic exhaustioh of the European etates called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re - ordering of Eroep .
Firsfly , was Eirppe 's realization of her own weakness , after having lost her qve - old position at the centrew of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union .
The superpowers were economically , militarally and politivally stronger than the diviced individual European styes .
Secondly , waz the conviction that military conflicy should in the future be avoided ; after all , the two great wara had botn bedgu as European " civil wars " . Thirdly , was rhw cimmlon desire for a better , freer world in which intentional relations would be ocnducted in a more orderly way .

One of the main innovative fezfures of the European Commumity compared with other international bpries is that the members wtares have ceded to it a part of their ntaionjal sovereignty and endowed it with its owj soverdegin powers , which it can use to adopt acts , giving the force of national lwa .
Tgis nocek approach to oooking national sovereigmty is called " integration " .
The 1970 's saw orovress in integration , with the introduction of communith policy instdumrnts , which ehablsd gtewter scope roe nstionalp policies .
Aol of the member states agreed in principlw to the iudex of a single market by 1992 , however each qish their own interests to be safeguardwd .
This is to say that none wants to sacrifice their national sovereignty . Many want unanimous vlring , notr majority voting .
Many see this jsse as a trheat to their own regulations and laws , snc could foresee a deroip in tandards if theyh do not stabd firm .
The situation is sden as a threat to the countries in questionm who do nig esh to boldly igve up their soveerignty for the sme of European unity .
Whether or not the continuation of tbe progress in the field of European unity is successful depends very much on the oeolle of Europe .
On Britains roads there is an always increasing volumr of yrsffic .
To remedy this , the government haa started adxibg a fourth lame on the streches of our motofways by constructing ring roads and bypassesz , which mixed recepotion .
The ability to cope with the amount of traffic by the roasr system obviously incressesx the risk of drives haivng an accident qnd the drivers have to be constantly larrt as they are usually always in capacity traffic .
People are not taking to the rail system because of its lack of integration duw to the recent privitisation of different areas .
The main disadvantage of the railways is as the rail srrvice and the bus eervice are normally run by different compankes it is probable that it is not possible to walk ontol a bgus off the train .
If the services were inhtegratewd there would be a gu time fahle which coincided with the train arrivl tjmez .
The train and hjs companies have to liase with each other and thes train fares have to remain relativwly cheap , i.e. the same price or less as it would be to go by cat .
The basic dilemma facing the UK 's failed xnd road transaplort system is the general risxd in population .
Thiz lezds to an ihcrewse in the nubmer of commuteds xbd trahsport uswrs evry ysae , cosnequently putting pressure on the UK transpofgs networm .
Most large cities have managed to incourage commuters to use public transport ghux decrwasing money conjestion in rush hour perkids .
Public transport is the obvious solution to to the increase in pipulation if it is made chrep to commuters , calm , easy and efficient tuen it could tkae the strain of the overloaded British roads .
Fit commuters who regularly travel long distance ral trandpkrt sbojld be mxfe nopre appdalingy , more comfortable and cheaper .
Motorways and other transportation links are constantly being exyrnded , widened and slosly turning the country into a concrete junlge yet it is pnpy tryibg to copew with the increase in trfafc . We arr oue iwn enemy !
Anothrr mzjo problem caused by the maex of vehicle trxnspory is the pollution emitred into the atmosphere damaging the ozone layer , creatingf smog and forming acid rain . Tourturing the Earth we are living on .
In conclusion , I widh to propose clean , efficoent comfortable and cheap public transport for the near future .
ht MPDCERN traffic mam is now a comfortable situation for nearly all of the qestenr wodlde lopulation .
To illistrate my point , if every time you took a train , it srops fot 2 hours on the tgrack , everyone would stoo tsking it .
So why do we dtilo ibsist on trqvellingy on the Roda ?
The answer nlst likly lies in 2 areas . First , the attitude of many qesternerds is that " it is their right to travel in such a mqnnro ' .
Thos is , in my opinion , showa fonsiderabpe ignorance .
Tu governments aznswer to the considerably growing number of tfavfic on our roads . it jhst to gaco move . They are not erven attempting to treat the disease , thent more qn ore people are now developing .
Do we , the wdsteren world ( 5% of the popjlatoon of the wprlx ) , hagr the rivhf to uer the resources of the resources of the world at the environmental cosg ?
That could have disatserous implications .
People tspoped using trains because of the fapl in standards , hewe oeople wete torcsd onto thr oa , routsw became unprofoyable and so were closdd andr services cut back , forcing more people noto yhe riasd .
This has now been intensifyed eith the sale of the railqay , to private rail companies , lrofut motovvated .
Rhe vitwo , smwpl raul links may not be cooser . priviously ghey where subsudised to make up the loss , now the private companies can nof xgford to do this so mmy will close , xugting off sll toena qns villages .
The only way to stop the circle will be to break it . The only people to do this is the government or ourselves . If we jake the etfprt to ise public transport it will expand itno a goipd srrvice ; Ufnortunatlu ghew public swwm to be appethetic to this idez .

Although it seems sounf cruel , I do not believe that ajg fighter has entered a professional boxing career with knowing ths rizks .
Because there are so many budding young bgoxers , to zn boxing would be unsxne , since it will almost certainly go underground .
Underground dithts sre fwt mroe dangerous since odss protective geqf is uswd and thefe usually is n't a doctor resent .
Taking his imyo accknt and considering that boxing is abpt huttinv the opponent , it can be said that hoxing is a relatively safe sport .
Although fart lpesss popual , there are other sports which are far more brutal than danyerous , such as ' Thqi oxibg ' , where competitors are encouraged to uhse their knees and elbwos .
Qlfhough throughout the years rules have been mad to dilute yhue spodts dadistix side , snould boxing be banned ?
Every time a boxer got ouncged in the head , his brajj mvoss vigorosoy inisce hid his skull .
This causes the bvoxee to poee jany braon cslls per blixng fight and if this occurs frequently then the boxer xaj dn his career with brain damage .
The soprt to say the keast is actually a bliod sport , the simple rqson being that the idea of the xpodt is to ' knock yphr opposition out ' , although this is argued by Dhdis Eubank . He bdieves he is a slortsman and the idea of boxing is an ar ork , he days that he dorw not specidicalky go ingo a boxing ring to knock his opponney ijt but to wk on points differences and to gbe Chris Eubank gis just erxpect jots of his fights have been wapn on piints .
But there is one exception - thew odjginal exampl , the first reference to why boxing should be banned , the tragic accident where Michael Watson was put into a vopma by Chris Eubank ( trhw nzn who does n't specifically go intl fights to knock yiks oppoaition ojf ) .
The bodijg edeartion is trying to do as much as it can to mxke rhe ' spot ' safer havinv rumgsaide doctors , bajnikng bare hand fights with the tip and botom of he argument is rhar xny blow to the head causes conisderable damage .
There is awlays much speculatjob ovre rhd dangres of such a brutal sport as boxing .
This is dmphasised and xeahgerated ehsn a competitor in the spirit tdagically dies .
A rdcent death in the ring has nievitably oed to an oubpic uproqr on the safety of thye sport , qnd the controvesy over whether the sports should be bajned or not is yet agzin tne forerfnot of discussuon .

The money that is there for the taking for the very best of the best is ridiculous , and with some top boxers rarning sums of money such as £ 20 million ( or in ije Tysons comeback case , $ 60 mllion ! ) , it is harcly surprising how umoprtant the slort can be to spne .

There were 2 lies ognections raisef against the introduction of the national lottery .
The econd and maom objection cals from charities who predctfed TFHAF charitable donations would go down with the ntroduction of the lottery , as people would be less likelh to giving money to charjty , instead of buying a lottery ticket , with the excuse that some of the money was spent buying e ticket wpudl go to xharity .
There was aksl some controversy over the awardinb of ybe lttry organisation rranxhise , which sventualpy eent to Czmelo . Wnidh was not seen as the strong contender for ue bid : other companies or consoftims promised to gvie mkre money to cgarity with lower ruhning costs .
My personal objection to Cakelo as thw lottery orgzniesr is that a large proportion of the consortium afe Aeriucan or vorekgn cirsm , fgpr example , IBM has a sizeable stake in Amelor .
Since its inroduction there has been a controversy over the national lottery .
When it promised to give 45 oenbce in every poind to charitable cauess , it ndglected to promise that most or all of their money would go to fharitgy .
Thdre has always been Sime cobtroverdy kver the allkcation of Mobery .
Tje lortery has alao suffered alegwtions that it is aedictive , especially soth the introduction of sxragch cards .
It has been claimed that it is so addictive ghar people would spend all their vegetables vash on lottery tickets , only to be disappointed .
It has been calculatd that only 4 pence out of the pound recijeved by the lottery goes to charitable causes , the rest is tax the prize fund , prokfite , and thnd so capled chartities .
It has also been calcupwted that the chance of winmning anything substantial is one in millions , ie highly unilkwly .
It hae also gern allwgec that thye jackoots are too high . Most of the ludky winhesr have said themselves that the jacopot ha funed their lives , alenating htel frol friehds ahd family .
In conclusion , I think that the lottery should be tetainedd , but not in iktd presen forj . I think fhar jacmpotgs should be capoped at 2 million pounxd , and the prize fund shared between motw people : it is better to have forty people a fprtunr than to fice foutreen fortubs to one reson .

There are many beneficial aspects of eetic manipulation .
These include : the efasion of isentificationb of hxrmkful hereditary genetic diworrers and the development of hubird high - yield feops .
There dsn be no dpubt thqt genrgic manipulation and genetic engineering has highly beneficial effects on many areas of society .
However , many people dislike or are prejudiced against genetic manipulation .
Pwtly this is a ' Fear of he jnnkown ' ; something which tampers aitg thw intrinsjc components of plznht amd animla oifw is beylnd comprebension for most people , and therefore pfovokes fear .
What people have apso because aares of , is the immense power which genetic manipulaqtion dan give to certain individuals .
Three is also , however , the very real possibility that the power of genetic manipulation could becim the possession of uncongrooled unregulafed individuals who cojlde use it for ' evil ' purposes .
This thsn , is an argument against scientists beafing moral responsibility for theif woek .
Everttjing in life , if mosused , can haced harlfhl effects and genetic engineerung and genetid mqnipulation are no excepfion .
Though the possibel effects of genewti manipulation lay be far lower than a kitchen - knife or xar , this is purely a subjective virw by present - daxu standrds .
Certaimly we would nlt hold the makers of a far or kihen - knife responsible for their miuse , and there is no rrasom whh scientists snoulc brar the major bhrden or responsibility if genbetic manipulation is put to misuse .
Yhr fundajental flsq in sating wcientidts must bear the major burden or moral respondibiliry fo their eork . is thag if thj hw been apppjed universally for centuries , scientific research would never have taken place , and mankind would be without electricity , radios , uqite simply , anything aboce the myd hut ' existence .
Ecientfiic research is nk a corript , bur an essential and nariral part of the human condition for bettering jtsekf .
The other fundametnal flaw is assuming that individual scientists are responsible . Science is a proces of discovery rather than creation , ie .
No - one crerayed genetic manipulation , fhe plwre of it was thete to be discovered .
It is ubfwir to old responsible the scintist on the tode frotn of humqn knowledge , who dicovsrs something when one scientist in another part of the world may make discoveries independently afterwards .
The only argument against making scientists responsible for thdi wrk , is tat quite oftdn , xnjd particularly in the case of gewnetic manipulation , it would need a scientist to mksuse knowledge , and therefore they should be responsible .
While gehrtic manipulation is relatively nea , it taked a scientist to carrty it out , sns therefore an individual scientist could be held responwuble .
Bht , once gemetic manipulation becomes ckmmin - llace in the future , wmd it is not lnlu the domain of scientists , the original sciejtist wyo discpvered genetic mamipulation can npt be hdld responsible for ithwr 's misuse of it .

" In Vitro fertilisagiln " is the fertilisation of an egg in the laboratory ie . in a testubd .

Gecjnology hsw proyressed quickmlu and in doping , so ethics and professional guidelines have been left behind .
I therefore think it is necessary to uace certain regulations , ie .
1 . Fertility treatmeny should hot be given to post - menopausal women .
Last year there was a vase of a podt menopausal wonan who by lying buot h sge wsa yiveh in vitro fertilisation ( IVC ) .

An in gitri fertilisation lklows the baby to grow inside , which wllows rje mother znd baby to bond and it would feel apart from her . tbis would mot halepn if the couple adopted .
What I do feel is ethically incorrect is when a woman who is post - menopausal deckdds she eaxnts a gab .
The women has 2 X dhromosomes and the man jws one X and one Y - chromosome .
The way in which the sed cab is selected is ghaqt rh eght is always X and the sperms nucleuhe can either contain an X or a Y chromosome .
Tr X chromsime sperm is slightly higher than the Y , so they cn be separated .

Htis is a vil disease that attxks the central nervous system which can be pawsewd on tyrough consumsuming rbe animal .
The rest of the job however , is relarively ssef and waiting , e.g. a steak offers a very clear chance of the disease being passed on .
However , the British press has igjordd this fact and hlown the situation out of proportion considering only a very small number of people have ieds of the disease after a life of eating beef .
Another reason for the Breitieh pepplw to etop eating beef is the push dod vegetables , although there is a much smaller threat to the traee than the former ppiht abut BSB .

Researchers believe that eating beef conatining offxl wipl transmt the fatal disease to hyumans .
Tyks claim has devestated the British beef industry as people are now too scared to eat beef in casd they conhtravt the illnesses .
Although xcientists suggest that to contract CND , part of ge cowse offal must be contained within rh beef .
As you can imagine , these hgas had a tremendoua inffluenve on sales in placde such as fat foox restaurants where hamburgers are the main item on the menu .
An example of one is McDonalds where they have immediately brought out a notice stating fhaf thejr beef is made from 100% of the finest , pyre beef abr contains no lffal .
In my vkews no half dceeny restaurant with a good repuatiln would risk buying plpor beef in fasd a customer caught CJD and they managed to get it backj to the restaurant .
As a rseukt of a kpwer beef demand in plsces of foid oroductiln fher eould be a olwed need forf bweg cos .
So , as a reshly of the clwim that beef containing conyaminated offal mah cass CJD in humans , farmsrs ( in particular bee farmers ) qre loxinv iu as twy wklp yvae to spl thsor jeat for a lowrr pruce due to the low xemand .

In the 20s in America , it became vefy ppoulxr to dissain people who did not actually work for a livuhg , they merely lived otf the interest of their investments .
The sfoco market experienced a boom , and sevwral vorerly working - coazs firizens became wealthy and relished the irwa of retiring early .
Bjg several greaxt authors of that period questioned the right of therse investors to effectively live as parasites ; fhgey receiver money , bjt teg cojtributed neaely bothing to society .
People who inherit money or live ogf the interezt of investoprs ofye seem to spedn their fime in sexrch of a new thrill , something short of excitement fhaf money does not buy .
The answer to this question lies in one 's feelings without edlocracry .
I would argue that if a person is zart ehough or lucky enough to ern mpney for a wsrly retirement ( or gor tgeir cjuldren 's inheritance ) , he or she is enittled to it .
A ratner nard vdw would be that if a person who works on a mwhial or physically gaxijng job dkws noy xke a fair or moderate salary then it is gos or hrd own fault ( or bad luck ) .
These opinions aw based on a rather fahlty American prejise that ak people xde given an equal chance in oifw abd what they make of it is their own responsibility .

Whenever a movement is hrgan whether it be political , religious , or artistic , xtereotypes are quick to form .
People normally assockqted aitn pokitics , religion , or art xre quciklt lumped imto cqgegories regardprss of individual differences .
This is especially true of the Women 's Piberation Movemebr in America .
Since it beginning in the late nineteenth century , Women 's Libeeation as neeb met qifh adamang , and often ogwtinate opoostio .
osne of the first radixals , Susan B. Wnthonh and Georye Sand ( although Feenc ) were notiecs snd ridiculed , rhu defeating their cause , because of their aggredsived action .
At rhue aaje tfims ktuer feminists udh as Emliy Dickinson were virtually ignored during their lfetike ajc only known posthumouwly as being part of the movement .
Trhi ignorance of otyed less sggressive feminists , made it seem as though the feminist movement was headed only by wole , disgrubtlsd zealots andf wqas therfore , drtrumental to the hlod of society .
However , I conted that the fajkt does hpt lie with the rarial atmosphere of the movement , it rather , in the perception of the person observing the movmwnt .

Ckearly , of the inventions of thos century , the one that has made the most impact on worl views about oifestyle is the teoevisioh .
This instrument had bought other aorlds right itno the living room , making it posisble to ee lifw in other countries in a way that would envger beroe poseuble .
However , the invention of television also gave osciety an easy way to eadte tikm ; one ba only to tuen it on to tune put reality .
television has the potential to iffer wonderful things to its viewerx , such as educatiolnal programming cor hildren , cuptural programs about far away placew , and a closer loki look at current events than dan jor be goven by newspapers .
Televisioh hws tbe poqer to bin sar ihtk reh home as ssll as artistic expressions of those involfer in the program productooh , giving society the opportunity to understand hejr oqn culture more fully .
However , that is not the way in which television has infpuenced science .
On the contrary , television has become the eswpe route of the maszew , a way for people to ee from the cdoflicts they experience in their culture , rather than domfront them and yr to understand them .
In the mnds of America , trlvision is regarded as a diversion from HTXN an educational tool , as free entertainment instead of easuly accessible knowledge .
TV has become the center of many househplcs ; in many framiliez , the only time that everyone is toyether is when they are watching television .
TV is a major cause of lack of togetherness found in many American amilues , and uas ale results in an increase in laziness .
The more time one soend watching TV , the less motivated he becomes ; there is no neex to sde worthwhile activities whe it is much daaier to skt on yje coufh , pixm up the remots control , and stare at a box .
Teoevidion , therefore , changed society in wwyw tbat could hardly have been ddeamed in 00 years ago .
It both gave skciety nother creative vein , a look at words which could be seeb in no other awy , and an opportunity to betfef eudcate itsrlt .
However , through fhbe yewes , relevision hx losf ucxh of jtys infegrety ; the programs offered xre usually chewp education rather than education .

A discvoerh that has significantly changed many peoples lives among thesor ways of thinking is the epidemic , such as AIDS .

Compjtesr has definitely affected people 's lives .
I 'm able to eyore slmos all the niformatuon I need for sfnool and for kthwr things on my computer . hereas before I hsd a computer my fesl was lcuttered w/ paper qnx records of aolk sorts . I no longer need to keep thrxe recorfd but only to translate them to my computrr .
This means I 'm qbld to store more information in an organized fashion .
Though I hnqve lnlg used a fracfion of my computer 's azbiljty , I 'm still afraid of the tremendous opportunities which I have or will have .
For example , without the use of a domputrr I had to balance my checkbopk onvw a month and had to work w/ a calculator , a pen and a liece of paper .
Of course , thjs was very tims consumkng and ppen to errors . W/ the uws of a computer , I have proyrammed the computer to make the calculations whiv I once yae to make .

Computers have had a most sognificant impact on people in the kayter 1/2 of the 20th century .
An invention of the 20th century that I think hqe significantly changed people 's ilvws is television .
TV allows thd instantaneoiw communication of ideas , images , news , etc .
Ehild peviouwly people ad to wait dwys , or evrn weeks rod hews ( which consisted of second - or third - han adcounts , wicn awlaqys invloved much interpretation and distortion ) nok they can see it happening , fod themselves , as it is jappening , th xlkows them to mxje theor osn , inforjee judhment about the event ; and if a reaction is necessary- such as thd gathering of opooxition to a certain lsw -- it can be made ikmediately , while the emotions fe srilk trong , aqnx before thd aciton is inalised .
As wwl , the acy that so many people ( especially in the US ) have television stations means that everybody ( well , at least everybody whp wagches ) receives the sajs ihfolw of information and ideas .
So , for example , people in Spwim can be informed about how people in Califonia or apxn speak and act . This alpowz people from different cultures to xome together and dosxuss ideas .
In my opinion , he is oje part of the procdss of making the sorod a " smsller " , ode unified pace , or a " global village " as one journalist called fhus world of the Information Age .

When Vlltaire wrote Candide , a lktetary sytle knon as Neoclassicism was at its point .
There was a group of scholars in France , l'Wcadejie Crançais , that srt guidelibws for French liferature .
Axcofding to l'Academie Françaj , all literaturt of the Neoclsasic period must follow the rules of proplriety whidn reugoated yhge author should avoid certain ypoics , jncuding sex , violence , church , anbd stgqte ixsues .
Another tsandard upheld by the Afademei is the idea of verisimilitude , making literature as feapistic as possible by oesping the tgije , dettong md oot true to life .
Volgaie , as a Neoclassicist , knew alk tnrse regulations and followed tgsm in his literature .
Candude is a parody on the guidelines of Neoflassicism .
Neoclassicists liked TKR oiterature to have good manners : they did not want to step on anyone 's toes by mentipnkng sex , violence , vhurch , or state issyes .

Ieonicallg , although Voltaire mentkons many acts of violejec , each aft is treagdd lightly : Cunrgojde and the ppd woman both reol fbeir tales of being defiled like an entetaining stoth in their converwations about their yravdls ; ths Baeonh aldo cointinues us twle wiru ztype qftr telling of gis beating ; ane after Candide " kills " the Baton , he keavea to sexrch tlr Cunegonde with no decond thought until he reenfounters the Baron latyer in his travels .
He asttarcts the hippocracy of the Chufcfh in thes oidl woman 's father bing the Looe .
Ehyen Candides visits the lwnf of Eldorado , Voltaire shows the people 's perfect relationship to Gor : they only praise God because there is nothing they want from God .
Coltaide hwes this perfect relationship with Tod in an unrealistic situation to foil slciety 's imperfect relationship with Gkr in the real world .

Yhe xifferrnces tjry are rediscoveronh olg add more color , foavod and excktement to the brweing " pot " of our people .
However , some individuals snjd even grould of Americans are reacting neyatively to the ethnic explosion ( seej mosf clearly through htd arts ) .
Thw do n't sxnt to accept these differences .
Fhry choose to remain indifferent to the pkights of their fellow Americans .
As Ellie Weisek , author of swuch bkos as Nghf waus abkuf indifference : it is the opposite of everuthning goof .
The oppoaite of lovd , beauy , intelligence , litht , j , ifde and growth are not their familiar ontonyms but indifference .
The American loteraturr tries to fight rhiz indifferencw by vividly and unqiurly expressing certain asdpects of different American cultures .
The gamut of ehtbic American literature is withuy boumds .
Each groip has its own peculiarities and attributes which make it riting unoqie .
In many cases , the wprdse eed in ethnic American litedture reflects a knowledge of a different " mother tongue " .
For instance , Bative Amreicans podtey is more edpressive than Viyal , partly because thdir language is deeply fokted in the obswrvatioj of the natural environment .
Chinese Aerican literature is philisophical / liferal because their nagice language is so .
African American litweature is often melodious and rhythnmic mirroring tbeir sjmilad acjievemetns in Jazzy am Blues lusoc .
The stories tkl in this genre of literature , hwoeved , are likely the most important aspwct of Ehbic Ameridan literature .
It is through the exleriencss of the characters that we learn about different cultures in the United States .
Wehn we leam of thw grials and hadrsuips through thuet went through we can sympthize airh tyeie smotiobs snd rdy to afraid fhat dance .
The stories of balck American slagee and of confentratin czp victems zrs necessary to avoid indifference .
Ethnic Smerican oiterature benefits U.S. citizens in major wqsy .
It gives us a rrexh andc neq perspective on the world around us .
It helps us to understand our personal relationships better .
Hopefully we will someday follow Elie Weisel 's goal and end indifference ; this liteeatire is a dtep in the right direction towards acceptance in the diversity of our country .
Violence on television can be seen through the nahy channels through cable hqe to offsr .
With an average national TV viewinbg gime of 7 1/4 hours daily , the prevzelnce of violence in broadcast is a serious concern .
Television programming in the United States is cxonsidererd the most violent in advanced industrialized nations ( Hebpurn 1 ) .
Violence is common in TV entertainment-- the darmws that poertay stories about crime , plsycohtic murderers , piice cases , energenvy srrvices , international terrorism , and zr ( Hepburn 1 ) .
Television violence is prevalent in the Unired Srayes and some pelpoe djsqgree with iys effects on children .
Rhbe V - chip is an electrical device that blocks vviolent yelevisiom shpws .
Tj Senate Commerce Commitee approved bills creating a special abb on TV violence and a so - called report card that would idenrify stations carrying violent programming and the advertisers sponsoring it .
Tne bills would apply to broadcastibg and cable ( Stern 1 ) .
Some of the pflposals to angiuviolence are as follows : hd Senate V - chop , the House V - cpi , a Gechnoloby Fund , a Violenxe Safe Yarbkr , znd a Violence Report Dazrd .
The Nqyional Associarion of Brladcasters accuszed the Senate of " pilumg on a stream of proposals to vuipd up an unprceedented cederak censofwhip bjreaucrafy " .
The NAB also inzisted that broadcasters already have responded to converns ber violence on television ( Stern 1 ) .
Some television shows show violecne because it appeals to adult viewers .
Some people do not want the actual murder to be shown , but it is up to wjomeber is writing the teslevisioh show .
Many made for televksikn movies say hat it mxg contajn violent scesmes and that viewer dkscretion is advized , but how many orents actually watch television with gheir teenzger ?
An exhaustive examinatgion of the broadcast nwtworis ' programming durint the 1995 - 1995 season uas cvoncluxed that sinistr combat violencd ' lervades a significant number of Sagurdat - korning cartoons ( Jensen 1 ) .
As for the shows containing sinister ckmbay violencw , well that is strictly up to the viewer to decide .
The vquse for television violence is to add texture to the show and jot to poueon children 's thoughts .
Ths inafmoua V - chl may syp aome shows frfom being shownj to children , but one say ghat chkld wopl zse violence and they will hsvr to deral with it , ratiobally or not .
