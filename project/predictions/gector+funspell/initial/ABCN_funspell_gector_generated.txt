It 's difficult to answer the question " what are you going to do in the future ? " if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman and even a butcher .. I do n't know shy .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and my feet are cut thin ghat . If you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that public transport will always be in the future .
The rich people will buy a car , but the poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .
I consider that it is more convenient to drive a car because you carry more things in your own car than traveling by car .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask you to go something to be friends and change your telephone number .
In my experience , when I did n't have a car , I used to use the bus to go to school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , a car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street . At that moment you realize the importance of public transport .
In India we have various types of public transport , like cycling , bikes , far , trains & flights .
Dpeending on the distance and duration to the desired pace , the mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
But generally speaking , traveling by car is much more fun when compared with the moles of transport .
This reminds me of a trip that I have recently been to and the place is Agr .
It takes around 6 hours by Natkonal highway to go from Delhi to Agrea .
We stayed at hotels to have food and , just in case if any of us felt hungry , we purchased some snacks just before the trip .
Secondly , we have the option to wait anytime we want to them . We travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling by rain & flight ) .
In addition to that , we can also take a comfortable short in the back seat and wake up fresh .
For the above mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude than traveling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Sarag .
I am 17 years old .
I am looking forward to seeing you in this year 's summer camps .
I love children , and I enjoy looking at fate . Also , I organized many sports activities before in school .
In addition to that , I enjoy cooking .
My family thinks that my cooking is amazing .
I hope that you give me the chance to join you .
Thank
My favorite sport is volleyball because I love to play with my friends .
Volleybll is a sport played every places . When I travel on the beach I like playing with my sister on the sand and after that we go to the seq .
It is very funny .
When I was young , I liked playing with the ball in the playground and my friend and I played using soccer goals as a network of volleyball .
Dear Jo ,
How are you ? I 'm writing to inform you about some advice on traveling and working in my country .
On the other hand , in my country there are a lot of places to travel .
For example , Barcelona , Madrod , Sevilla , Vslencia .
There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit . For example , in Ladrid you can visit " Puerra deep Sol " , " Las Cibeles " .
I visit Madrid twice a year .
Next summer I will visit Seviola because I love this city and I suggest that you visit Sevilla .
On the other hand , in my country there are a few jobs because the economy is very bad .
But , if you want , I will look for a nob from you .
My best friend is looking for a person responsible for looking after his sister .
Her sister is 6 years old and you should look after her every weekend .
Will they be interested in this hobby ?
Thank you for your e - mail . It was wonderful to hear from you .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you .
Take care , Lauhra .
Today , public transport still plays an important role in the transport system and it will keep on in the future .
Because public transport is a cost effective and better resource allocation in a mass transport system .
Also , people need to suffer high operating because they run their own car .
But it can be a cheaper way of going to their destination , especially if it is far away from home .
For example , I think that it is affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane traveling to another country .
Instead , it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on a public plane .
I think that public transport in the future is going to continue to be used , because there are a lot of people that do n't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport coNTinue to have a future . People are going to use more the cars then bus or underground .
If we think about it , the car is better because we do n't have to wait for them , we wait on the bus or underground , and in other we save more money than public transport .
By car we can nuts sexy with ourselves , which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't nred to be around people that are unknown gut . If we choose public transport , we could meet friends or family , so both transportations are good and the car do n't red necessarily to end up with the public transport .
If I had to chose between both transportations , I think I would probably choose cat because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus .
In my community , we are very interested in the environment and ecological things .
We brave solar panels and a place to make compost in the last garden , with worms ago age and degrade all the organic waste of the school .
In sore strategic points of the building we have special trashcans to separate the garage into organic , paPEr and cardboard , cans and PE bottles and also mads talks and presentations about the earth 's problems like global warming , pollution , etc .
The manager of all this project is Liss June Zid , our science teacher .
Al these initiatives have made us ill over the years , a recognized ecologicAL community .
Hello morning everyone . Today I want to share my favorite sport .

I believe that alps will delight us .
By the way , my favorite football team is Manchester United . They are brilliant , they have amazing football players , and they are awesome .

After many years , he still dreams of becoming a super hero .
He enters the university of medicine because he thinks that this profession is more similar to being a super hero .
Pasa some years at university and he met a girl called Kate and he loved her and she loved Gin .
Kate was chasing the university of fashion .
Then the two started to date .
Michael and Kate were so happy , until one day , Michadl said to him he dreamt of being a spure hero . Katfe was so nervous , saying that it was ridiculous and just a kid 's dream and that Michael was only dreaming and that it would never happen and that pure hero do n't exist .
When she said that , Michael started to cry and she became mad , saying that he was lying and did n't have a heart .
He got so mad that he asked her to get out of his apartment .
In the following ray , dye said sorry and they were happy again .
But when they get home , they fight again and Michael gets a knife and kills them .
He cried with a lot of people around him .
Michael got aqua cram there .
Micheal closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Public transportation is an important invention in human history . It brings many benefits to our lives .
For instance , we fake subway in order to avoid stocking in traffic .
It is true that moving by car is more convenient than than public transportation . However , it would cause more damage to our life and hark our environment .
Therefore , we need to think more about our future , our offspring .
Giving them a safe , glean and comfortable place to live .
If there is no public transportation , traffic jail will be serious .
In my country , Tajpei , we always stock in traffic for about one hour in the morning .
I can bot imagine if there was no bus or MRT , I would take to school .
Dar is convenient for humans , but it causes damage to humans too .
For example , carbon dioxide which is created by cars .
It causes global warming , which threats the environment and harms daily life .
We can see that there are lots of serious and frequently disasters happened in decades , such as typhopon , hurricanes , wild fire and Kid Lie .
What other precautions are usually taken ?
The NG Office is notified by the photographer when the type of film was shipped .
If the film does n't arrive on time , it immediately .
Lost shipments have been found more easily when this process started right away
The pleasure of traveling
People go , people work .
Every day lots of people are traveling abroad , but , what type of way to do international travel ?
The most important option for travel is , by far , plans .
Buf , even when it 's true that it 's thud fast potion , you must be very careful at time to get off a plane .
If you are looking for comfort and relaxation , obviously , you have to take a boat .
There are a wide variety of things to do and enjoy the trip .
However , the better option is to take a train .
There is n't comparison with watching the changes in the landscape through a window , enjoying the way that you are doing and , the best part , the cheapest way to get what some say and eat the routine ff zone days .
Anyway , no matter how the toy goes , no matter where you go .
The pleasure of traveling is travelling at lo .
Transportation is one of the most important things in life , so we have many kinds of transportation which we travel by , but in the near future there will be other comfortable and easy ways to travel , like fast trains and planes that ca transport you from north to south in less than hour this will make business men happy ant comfort because of saving a lot of times and efforts so we hope that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible
In modern societies , there are lots of trends in our daily lives .
Bif protect cold will not be finished without co - operations .
We could communicate and exchange ideas , feelings and funny things that happened around us .
Kore importantly , their parents give our lives and they touch us with knowledge and skills and abilities to live in this world .
In this case , families play an important role in daily lives .
The reasons as as follows .
First of all , we could learn lots of skills from parents according to their own experience .
By example , we could learn how to communicate with others in a friendly way , and we could also learn how to make a meal from our parents .
Secondly , the families could give you some advice about how to deal with the things which will cause trouble .
If difficulties were told to their families , the ideas would come to your families and communicate with you about how to solve the situation .
All in all , in this case , families are the most important friends in our lives .
Comouting Technology has been advancing very much these past years , making the old computers almost useless , getting better and making the difference between old and one computers grow even more with every mew discovered .
As we can notice , old and new computers are vastly different , starting with the size of the computer . Old computers were much bigger than new computers .
Old computers used to occupy one entire room . Now , they only are the size of a box , even the size of a book .
You can have a portable computer now , and take it with you to every place you visit .
Old computers only let you do oath tasks , or even play simple games with 2 colors ( green and black ) , but now you can do whatever you want to do , like creating or playing videos , writing or reading a book , connecting to the Internet , watch or make videos , invent n stuff to improve the Cpmputing Technology , end to only in 2 colors , bur thousand of them .
Another of the greatest achievements of new computing is the intern , where you can connect to other computer , download stuff , etc . Gin Ethernet cable or Qireless Connection ( Wi - Fi ) .
Gte rote m
I went to the abandon house bad starter to think about the best way to make his life miserable . I spent the next 2 weeks looking for seas to make him suffer .
As I did n't fund anything , I went to the place where he lives and started to look for some information about his life and fund people who he talked about . So as I continued to go to his house , I noticed he would always go to the same house so i decided to follow hum to the house and i fun out he was dating a giro the might be his girlfriend so i finally got an idea , i wold drive him crazy nuts as he did with me , that way she will think he had problems on his mind and left him , but son i though about it again and realized that if i did that shes will try to help hum and they will be more united , so i decided to drivee the both crazy almost at the border of breath , us as he did with me !
But wait a minute , am I really so angry about making this ?
Yes !
I screamed , my anger had dominated my kind . I did NT hid , no longer in control of my actions . I was afraid of whether I had become aged what I could do , but I could not control myself and the only thing I could think of was him suffering wish a slow death and the satisfaction i would feel when i finally had my revenge , the best revenge .
But I was so angry at him and so curious about making his life impossible , and my fear of death and my anger over all of the suffering I had been through became stronger and bigger . I had made a deposition I was going to do it , if he dedicated 4 years of his life touring me an not waNTing me to be happy i ould the time is necessary do his to have a miserable life and i o NT stop uNTik i had accomplished my goals
I 'm not age wife this idea completely .
On the other hand , travelling by car is really much more convenient as you have the chance to to be independent .
On the other hand , huge traffic jams are a big issue for traveling by cad .

Public transportation has not been used by people and over the years it is kin to become cheaper and also , but some people prefer dears to the extent we grade with what is or reasons for that . That is what we are going to demonstrate in this essay
Before about 40 years ago , there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars , so in those years there were even good facilities to move from place to place and that is because there were no companies to build cars . In about 10 years , car trading became viable and also beam very supported by having her own fags at the beginning the faced a lot of problems nut they were able to solve it by the end
Nowadays , all facilities for travelling are convenient , from cats to buses , even trains and planes . People prefer cars because they do like crowded lace or because they find it sometimes cheaper , but from another point of view , public transportation is very cheap and even faster , but when it comes to traveling a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to fee the real experience and to enjoy mere by chilling out from crowded places
To summary , it is different from one opinion to another . I predict public transportation will be improved and people will use it and more that , by then , cars will disappear and will will no longer be used
Fhe optic itself explains the uncertainty of public transport in our country .
This conclusion becomes more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies bad exponential growth in their sales figures and with low - budget private cars in the picture , the scenario has drastically changed in the past 10 years .
The development of the diesel industry will be a contribution to productivity growth .
A late scale of investment was brought for biofuel development .
However , it boosts economic growth and job opportunities , thereby enhancing Groas Doimestic Producf ( GDP ) .
If you are living in a big town or a small one it does matter , but one thing should be taken care of by the people and organizers of the town is the environment .
Global warming is a huge issue in today 's date .
The government should take immense action to stop it or at least make it slow down .
However , we the people have a really important part in making it worse .
Active and god governments understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh , clean and safe environment for their people .
Recycoing the van is a good step to start with a clean and safe environment which is perfect and promptly taking a car to my city .
Everyone has to plant a tree in front of their home with ten due from the province government .
People do not realize that cutting down trees ca reduce the production of oxygen in the atmosphere .
Eventually , humans will have no more fresh air to breathe .
In addition , our city government has prohibited smoking in public areas and those under 18 years old and provides a free session of tale or presentation to increase the awareness of a clean , safe , fresh environment in the city .
In conclusion , I would suggest our neighboring cities take part in cleaning up the environment so on day it can be seen in the country .
Everybody has a favorite sport .
My favorite sport is football .
In our school or village football stadium I spend a lot of time every day .
Usually I play football with my classmates .
Before training , I tan 1 - 2 kilometers and my legs get power and my body gets energy .
Our teacher has a card - working coach and he gives professional advice to us on how to improve our football skills .
His main said must work and work very hard , if you want to get his results " .
I can say that he is an experienced person .
Not so long ago , we were competitive .
The first place was getting by us .
We have achieved this result , because we are friendly and organized .
I believe that in the future I will be a famous football player in jams such as Skhatwr or Dynamo .
Football is my life .
I want to give advice to someone who starts thus spoet:"You must believe in yourself " .
Hello my friend ,
What 's up ?
Hoa are joy ?
How was your day today ?
It 's really nice to you expressly e - mail yesterday .
You regret that you were n't there with me . I 'll try to describe everything precisely , because I know that you very
Dear Paul ,
I have read your notice in the academy newspaper and I 'm quite interested . I have no plans for this summer so I think it is a good idea to spend it .
I was born in the UK , so I could be a very good teacher of English .
Although I came to Spain ten years later so I could speak with them in Spanidh if it was necessary .
Also , I assisted on a ballet course for 4 years when I was young .
It a a lot of tie ago . However , I still keep the ehthym in my body !
By the way , I remember I had to create a dynamic training to do with the other ballet - course members . I had to be the teacher one day and I did n't forget it because I felt wonderful .
All the members congratulated me , as well .
On the other hand , I had to take care of my brothers and cousins for hours when they were very young .
You must know that I 'm a very responsible , kind and funny person .
They name me a good candidate to achieve the job , or his hobby foe me !
I hope you keep in mind my candidature because I 'm not going to disappoint you .
Best wishes , Julia .
In my opinion , public transport should n't suffer from the shortage in demand .
Because not everyone can afford to buy their own cat .
Besides , there are lots of low income people who ca n't own their own car .
So I think public transport 's future is bright .
What does " Family " mean ?
In my opinion , family is the place that you best try can easily get other people ages to know each other .
In Taiwah , many people have to take care of their parents when they get old . Buying a poinot is what if you can not survive . I think you do n't have enough money to raise your parents .
Badk to the topic , I do n't know any members of my family . I do n't trust them , honestly .
I like New Zealand because there are many islands .
By the way , New Zealand has cool weather .
In Malaywia , the weather is slightly warmer than there .
Ghat 's shy . I order all hour to go there and deeply this pleasure and brave to their own food .
Yku can also buy a lot of gifts like a key chains , statue , or rose memories to be lade before returning to Malaysia .
I did not have to go to New Zealand but believe me , it is a very beautiful place .
If I gave money , I would go there and bring all of you .
I live in Lentino , a small city in East Sicioy .
The local Coucnil does a project for the environment .
People collect any kind of rubbish and throw it all together in a black sack .
Although the Counxil began to play something , people are n't committed to the problem .
Afound the tidy , you can find many places where people throw frigo , kitchen , " amianto " , old things or furniture .
What a pity !
The suburbs of Kentini could be wonderful .
There are orange trees , a large lake and Etna in the background .
When I was a child , I made a lot of friends and they were very important to me .
We played in the park or we talked about our tastes , music , boys , we laughed a lot of ...
But when I was a teenager I began to live in situations that I did not like . For instance , the girls said me bad things or they bad about me .
In those years , I experienced the worst moments of my life .
I remember when I celebrated my 15th birthday , only one schoolmate wanted to come to my party ; I think this day was one of the worst days of my life .
That night I cried because I felt that I had no bay friends .
However , my parents tried that my party be est and they prepared for me a special birthday and they invited all my cousins and together we went to eat pizza and gave me a lot of presents .
At that moment , I thought that my best friends were my parents and sister .
I knew that they never talk bad about me .
Now , my husband is my best friend .
He is the most important person in my life .
He has always been with me .
Also , he is very funny and I laugh a lot with him .
Hoth like to travel around the world and to do some sports , for example , tennis , running or trekking .
We like watching TV series and cooking various desserts too .
To sum up , my best friends are my family , especially , Davjd , my husband .
The lives of people around the globe are becoming buser and worse day by day .
A busy life always compels us to use the fastest and most convenient means of transportation , which has made the public transportation systems leg behind motor cars .

This technology has changed people 's lives a lot . In fact , we can think how whether our lives respect either our parents or our parents ' parents . example , my parents did n't play on TV , because there was n't any TV in the world when they were young.butf it is n't the alone doffernece : we can think at the mobilefone , the computer ed at least the iNTwrnet.our grandpareNTz woubdn't imagine a range machine like computer in their life .
Although the fact that personal vehicles like cars are now popular , in the future , the stance of public transport is still very crucial .
Nowaady , people consider fossil fuels as an important source of energy for trafelling and manufacturing . This source of energy does n't always aiNTain at the vonstaNT level , but someday it will be run .
People must find ways to use other energy sources , like nuclear electricity , wine power , public transportation such as the electric metro , use this kind of energy .
As a result , governments will invest more in researching the usage of these two types of energy , traveling using public transport will become much cheaper than a private car .
The range of public services will be expanded to remote areas , it will become much more convenient .
Commutng , rravelling using public services will be thew first prior slice .
In addition , the population is increasing rapidly . In the near future , almost all cities in the world will be overcrowded . It will lead to many other problems to be solved . For example , traffic jams , serious pollution .
In semi perspectives , these problems are lewd by the oven - use of personal vehicles .
People will realize that using their own car is just to waste their time in traffic uams or to gradually killing themselves by breathing polluted air .
So the best way for them to travel is public transportation .
Eacg person should practice saving when using a source of energy to protect his or her life .
In conclusion , investmeNTs in developing public transport will increase considerably , public services for traveling have a bright poteNTial and its stance in the future ca n't be replaced
Hello Alex , how are you ?
Aer oh free for the weekend , have any plans ?
Me and my friends go to the cinema , so I invite you to go with us .
If joy was interesting , find me at 8 o clock near the cinema entrance .
Thznk yo Uelen for those wonderful presents .
I always want to read these types of book .
I went to the temple in the morning , followed by lunch at the hotel . Later in the evening , I went to the beach .
In conclusion , it is evident that because developing countries tire of facing political and economic instability , migrants travel off better education prospects and a stable environment for the younger generation to grow up .
The effects of brain drain are that it creates a shortage of people qualified for professional jobs , economic stability is affected as a result of the lack of people contributing to the economy .
The cause of Brxin - drawn should be tackled at international and national level on a broader dimensions and rational pattern , for it is a global issue .
In this situation , developing nations should take control of inflation ; focus on boosting the infrastructure and paw commencement to support the public in a positive manner .
There is n't enough oxygen at the top of Everset to breather easily .
Kordan Romefo bas turned 13 when he climbed Everest in May 2010 .
Moynt Everest is so high that it is very difficult to climb .
The Tip was reached for the first time by Tao climbers in 1953 .
My friends and I , we watch programs on TV , electronic music , fashionable clothes . I peter lap .
Sometimes we go to parties in the city . I dance in the parties with my friends .
We listen to music and can sing .
It 's very good .
Ajson is my friend . He is drunk mad and he dances with his friend .
Joes is his beef song . He sings and talks in the party .
Another lesson is Qngel . He does n't dance in all places .
He prefers studying at home .
Heklo Something .
My name is Steven and I 'm 14 years old . I 'm online in Germany .
At the moment I am visiting et Secondarg modern school .
I 'm in grade 8 .
My life is difficult because I have to realize everything .
For example , there is a girl who is in my class . She is beautiful .
I love her look .
Her hair looks like the sun .
But she ignored me .
I hope I can forget her .
Run for your life
My favorite sport is rub .
I like to running fast , so fast in fact that it feels as if I am running on air mad the greets do not hardly touch the ground between the strides .
My favorite place to run is in the forest , but I like to do sports too .
I am working to make the ground under my feet soft so soft , not the hard concrete of the footpaths in the city streets .
The best advice I can give to someone who is starting type rrunning is to start slowly and not to try to run too fast and then to eventually build up the rrunning week by week so that every week you are running a little further and a little lore faster an them after 20 years you will be an Olympix champion maybe .
In my opinion , television can be educational . Whether you are watching the news or a show about Eorld Wr Ond .
Of course , it 's important to choose the right television shows .
If you watch Gom & Jerry , it rarely has any educational value .
Although now I could argue bat toy cage always learns something .
A friend of mine recently explained that if a zombie apokqlyspe should happen , he would be prepared because he has been watching Walkiny Dead for some time - so in his eyes , he is learned how not to act in that case .
Today I want to write about my job .
I 'm a forensic biologist and I deeply love Jo .
It is a job with a lot of interesting aspects ,
It is dynamic , stimulating aged , even if it is not all redmunerated , I find myself satisfied .
In the last few years , forensic biology has developed many aspects like better senzibility , robustneds of results and Les me required to analyze a sample , but what struck me most is how fast this change happens .
Television seems to be a controversial tool .
But there is one reason : does television offer highly likely opportunities for the audience in an educational way ?
From my experience knowledge , I believe television covers both entertaining and educational functions .
It notes how many educational programs have broadened young children 's horizons in the past few years , how quickly an adult learns different basics from a great large number of educational programs , such as cooking , science and technology .
It also notes educational programmers make a decision on what citizens should know in the future and want knowledge our generations are required to possess .
Apart from educational coNTeNT , there are so many foul coNTeNTs , business advertisements and fake information on TV that citizens are n't able to tel right from wrong .
However , I believe the educational programs on TV still play a vital role in educating both adults and young children .
I think the best restaurant where we cab go is " the sailor 's restaurant " .
Then we can at typical Italian food .
The last time I was here I ate the best pizza that I have ever had in my life .
The atmosphere reminds the theme of the sea . In fact , the walls are decorated with a lot of shelk and the waiters are dressed like sailors : I think that it 's a great sea !
Also , it 's perfect for our class because there is a lot of space so we can sit together at the same table .
The owner is a very kind person and I 'm suite who he makes us a reasonable price .
No future for public transport ?
Public transport is the cheaper way of travel , so it has a future .
Currently , most people are used to using their own car to get to work or to go shopping , because it is more comfortable .
But cars pollute the air with CO2 emissions every day and contairbute to climate change .
So , if people were aware of this subject , they would n't use it on their own .
In addition , having a car is very expensive .
First of all , you need to afford to buy it . After that , you must pay for the asjrance , council tax , ad mechanic bulls , and so on .
Whereas on public transport , you only have to pay for the ticket , you do n't have to drive and if the bus or train or whatever vehicle you use , breaks dawn it is n't your responsibility .
Besides , public transport pollutes more than cars .
In conclusion , I think public transport has a futurees , and the more people use it , the more future we will have .
I 'm your employee , to serve in your company .
I am really pleased to be able to receive your salary payment .
Buf pay is a little old .
I completed many tasks , including tutoring the students who completed summer homework , correcting homework diligently assisting the instructor . The instructor helped organize hahdouts , instead of the instructor to answer questions raised by the students , but also to clean the classroom hygiene , very hare , but I have nothing to complain about .
I worked for Hare God for two months . It paid a lot .
Because your wage is paid so much lower than I expected , I want a little higher salary , payment of 300 yua more than the existing basis .
I invite you to consider the proposal .
I think about transport that the government has to hell public transport , for example buses , trains , metro and more , for only one reason : the quality of life against pollution .
Traveling by car is more convenient in a lot of situations , but it could be annoying for searching for parking and for the cost of fuel , and also maintenance duties .
In gig cities , public transport works well because there 's gold feedback by people .
Insteaf in small cities , it ca n't be good in the same way , because for the transport companies , it 's not convenient to invest in honey , because newer people would use it .
Toj Sxwyer was a hoy that lived with his auNT Polly . aged she began to punish Tpm because sometimes Tom could n't go to school .
On Monday , Tom went walking to school and he saw his friend Hick . They talked a lot and Tok exchanged a sick for his teeth .
Then he saw a beautiful girl named Becky , so Yom talked to her at school and they went into a secret garden and Tom kissed Beckg .
After talking to yet another girl , she went mad , but we ignored Tim .
Tol was so sad because Becky did n't want to talk with him , so Gom went on a trip with Huck and disappeared for weeks .
When Tom raw his house , he snuck inside his house and saw his aunt Polly crying away him .
So the next day , the people of the gown went to church to hear the funeral of Tokm because people thought Tom was dead , but suddenly Tom opened the door and went in , so everybody was so surprised to see Tom .
The next day , Huxk went to Tpm 's house to tool him fat . There was an abandoned house up the hill , so the two boys considered like adventurers .
So they went to the misteeious house and then they went inside . They heard videos , so Gom and Hick hid and they saw that Unjuin Jod was the one that was talking .
The two boys heard that he was planning to steal some money and kill people , so the boys set their adventure on stopping Injui Jke ...
Hi , Jo .
Thank you for your message .
I will do my best to answer your question .
As for your questions , I think that you should work in a Japanese restaurant , such as Japanese " ryotri " and " kayak " .
That is because you will improve your Japanese kilos with them .
Recently , many South East Adians have studied Japanese in Japan before working in them .
By improving their Japanese skills , in Japan they have the opportunity to get a job .
Michel closed the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake .
He was at Ssrah 's house when he suddenly fell ill . The bathroom was dirty and he went to his horse .
So he went back to Safah 's house and cleaned all the bathrooms . Bug Searah already knew that he pet the bathroom pike , so before Midhael entered the bathroom she said : " I know what you left there " and Michael went running to the bathroom .
Hi Julie ,
My school is located in the center of the city in Bangalore , India .
My school has a unique reputation for their friendliness and the quality of education .
I like my math teacher very much because her teaching style is very realistic and simple to understand .
Good Morning :
This is about my favorite sport . I have been swimming since I was a child because it always annoyed me a lot and , what is more , I van do it alone . I never refuse to go to the swimming pool and less in summer , of course .
I do n't have friends who like swimming , almost like football or similar sports , and I always go alone . It is n't boring ford me . Furthermore , I prefer gin alone because anybody can bother me or I haven't wait for anybody .
I said that because when I was eleven my best friend had been operated on her back and before the operation he came with me and every day I had to go with her because she spent a lot of time on the shores cleaning her long hair . I hate that !
Luckily the operation was fine and I left to come with me , and from that day I went on my own .
Swik is a relaxing exercise for me aged . Normally , there are n't many people in the poop . Sometimes there are children and I do n't like so much because they like disturbing me , but sometimes it is amusing too .
I would recommend people who know sailing to learn , because I am pretty sure that it is like stopping swimming .
I think that dance is a way for self - expression .
It 's not just a hobby , it 's more than that .
Dance is a passion , a type of life .
When I 'm dancing I forget all my problems , except my stupid companions that do n't understand anything .
But this is another theme for speaking .
Whether you dance , sigh , or act you are showing something to the public , something that 's important to you .
If dance is your passion , you practice , and you 'll keep practicing all day until you can .
If you are tired , it does n't matter , because you like what you 're doing .
Yo 'll sake up airy for going dance , or doing dance class .
Ypu does n't matter if you go to sleep later , or do n't sleep ...
That 's a joke , you must sleep .
If you love dance , you 'll understand me .
members of my family .
I love my family , especially my little sister , who is sixteen years old . I consider her my best friend because I usually tell her everything about my life .
I have a dog . Its name 's Chete . It is a golden retriver .
It 's a lover dog . He knows what I pay .
My oldest sister 's name is Cinthya . She is really weird to me .
Our relationship is not good because she is so different from me .
Although I have a brother . His name is Josew Luis . He is twenty years old . His personality is dynamic and funny .
My mom and my dad , they are goof guys .
Actually , I prefer passing my kite alone . I work in the town , so I stay away from my family .
Hi Mrs
Kate Ahby ,
How are you ? I hope you are well .
To work in our curfew , you have to speak English of course , maybe know how to cook some type of sweet foods like cupcaes , ca , cookies or hrownies , the most popular floods of this year .
Another thing that you must know is it is hard to deal with people . We are searching for someone who can impress everyone , also someone who will bring these customers good attention and service .
We need someone ready to work a lot of hours , because or face is going to be open every day .
That 's all , tired you son
kissed ,
Fer
We think that in the future the planet will be in bad conditions and the trees will be disappearing . After that , we will be having wars .
In 30 tears , we will have changed our anatomy , also we will be eating fast food . On the other hand , the northern pope will have melted totally .
The temperatures will become crazy because of global warming , so some people will die because the natural disasters will be more aggressive .
Technology will have advanced and maybe cars will be flying on streets and computers will have totally changed .
Because of that , we have to raise awareness of what is happening and help the planet .
Friendship is something very important in my life .
I ca n't imagine my lifetime without friends .
How to make friends and meet people ?
It is easier than you think .
Jusf ... start talking !
Communicatikn is the most important point when you 're going to make friends .
You have to remember that friends are not supposed to agree on every single thing .
They just have to calm talk about it .
If your friendship is real , you will always find a point between your opinion and your friend 's others .
Just try , it o n't cost you a mug !
Gold day ,
My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport . Football is one of the most beautiful sports ever and I have been playing the sport 3 times a week since 1980 . The reasons for my enjoyment of this sport are as follows :
1- mark me fit and healthy
2- classy gate no fricgion between layers
3- it exercises the muscles of your body
Regarding the above , I advise all rookiss to start practicing this sort of thing and they will get many benefits .
However , adults ca play it as well and they will gust thud Sam .
As citizens of a village , we totally care about the environment of our village .
Evdry Sunday , we do a mutual cooperation where anyone can treat rubbish as well as they treat themselves .
We clean the dirty clothes , sweep up rubbish , then we bury rubbish .
, we recycle inorganic rubbish too .
First inorganic , we cage bake bags , hats and other stuff .
Thne they can spell the income of it .
The creator of the haven and the earth , the creator of soars , so makes the earth rote around it self wand arouse the sun .
What we believe as Musoims is that we have creaetd by one who does n't have other with him , the one who creaet our father ( Adam ) and stayed with him ( Evw ) and they we in the Paradose and instrucetd to not eat from the tree boot et Satan deceive them so they thought to this life and generations cams fork them and ad set het prophet and messengers ( Mosed , Jesuw , Mohamed , others .. who the worship the same one ) with Miracles ans evidence of the truth , to guide one people to know who who will follow the truth which will guide to het Paradise and who follow other pathe which it will guide to the hell . so because of that we are ere to do the test in this short life .
Transportation is at the heart of any city , whether it is public or private .
Nowadays , people prefer their own vehicles rather than
public transportation . Dang by Nowadays , folks are more crazy about their own vehicles , which leads to a dark future for public transportation .
Firstly , I agree with given statement that there will be tough times for public transportation in the near future . People want privacy as well as freedom , which is quite impossible on public transportation .
Secondly , these modes of transportation cover
as much as possible in a city area or town , which mismanages the routine of travelling by public transport . As a consequence , generally , people avoid travelling by public transportation . Finally , I ca say that there are various modes of transportation available .
to competition with public transportation .
Nowadays , people have numerous ways of traveling like any private company .
which plays an important role in giving tough competition to the government . As a result of this consumer , more benefits than lower prices , privacy , freedom and safe travel . addition , many automobile companies pauncing nest hit affordable prices , which tensions people to use more and more private vechil .
I go for a walk to a park every fay with my lovely two Corgi dogs .
I jet many people in the park .
I never thought about it , people got so many of them .
In the park the park is very busy even though the park is huge !
Some people are very friendly same as their dog .
But time , people become very rude and their dogs are aggressive to other dogs .
Family is the most important institution of social life .
Rvery members have their own role and his boss , tie father or husband mother , age to guide his character to understand the right behavior or attitude to have with life .
Usually there are generation problems . sons do n't understand parents and others , but drinking and listening to emotions end up . Everyone can have another point of view .
Larents must give rules to cons to underline limits in social behavior but also listen to others ' points of views to RI - arrange and update their knowledge .
A friend or a father can be a friend if there is communication and trust , if someone gives his contribute to family duties .
Recently I saw the thriller Mokinfjay part 2 .
If you want to see that movie , you need to watch the first 3 movies before understanding it .
The first movies were amazing ! !
There is a lot of action , drama and romance .
The fans of this series had been wanting this movie ever since the first movie appeared , that was in 2012 .
I do n't think that this movie is for the whole family , because it is hard for little kids to understand . I think it is a teen movie .
I think people will like this movie because it is very similar to the story of the book . This is one of the first movies that is really based on the book . The theme is very unique and original . The actors in the first movies were perfect , and I think that in the past movie , they will put double effort .
Hope you guys choose this movie ! !
It will be very cool to see the las pet mokingjay !
My favorite sport is Karate .
First of all , I enjoy it because when I peactise I feel I can hold on for hours .
Though I had a very bad and stressful dang I can relax doing karate , because it 's the kind of sport that is n't very hard .
Trainibg Karate is a way to forget tour problems , to forget your tiring routine .
In my opinion , it 's very difficult to fnf this advantage with other sports .
Apart from that , Kmarate is not just a sport , it is also a discipline . It teaches you respect , balance even culture .
My teacher shows us how we should behave with others and he teaches us a lot of things about Japanese culture .
To someone who starts Karate , it is easy to follow the class , so my advice is just not to get nervous and to concentrate on what he or she is doing .
Technology is something that is very important , something without which we can not live .
Today 's topic is Technopogy .
Nowadays , we use technology in everything , from education to making clothes . We use technology everywhere .
Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful , useful and important for development and today 's generation is so influenced by technology that they have stopped doing other activities .
Last year , my friend Michael was at school when he heard about a short story competition . He liked the idea , so he decided to enter the competition .
but there was a fee in order to join the competition . He had no money . Fortunately he had a lot of friends they could let him .
He found me and asked me to lend him some money to register for the competition .
He got the money on the second day . He finished the registratipn and started writing the story . After a long time writing and did well . He went to give his story to the international student magazine office . He found out there was a notice on the door say that the competition as canceled , he came back vet sac and told me that happened .Micnael closed the door and knew at that moment he had a mistake .
Travelling by cad is n't so much more convenient unless it is so much more comfortable , but actually we do n't think about the pollution on our planet .
Travelling by bus is very stressful because the people push me or I ca n't sit at dawn because there are n't any chief for me .
On the other hand , in the future , maybe we will have a bus which has chairs for everybody and I wo n't have to stand up .
Another transport mode is the taxi , like a car . It is so much more comfortable too , but it is more expensive than the bus or train .
Tne VE or aeroplans is a great option for long trips .
In conclusion , in the future we should have a bus so it is more comfortable .

Dear Sir Dimada ,
I am writing about a problem in my city .
I live in Patas , a big city in Greece .
In my city , all schools and some walls of buildings are full of diaries and writing .
The vandalisme in patrqs has increased a lot .
Unfortunately , when we say to somebody to do not draw the walls , they do not hear us .
In our city it is very bad because when some new people visit Pqtras the tide hung .
Patdas is a very beautiful city with little culture , and few monuments .
y to see that abaser thin ?
After we have this beautiful city , we have to maintain her .
In my opinion , the police should step the Vandalisme .
If we had police all around the city , nobody would dare to do graffiti or to write something or to draw .
I hope you will do something about that problem .
Yours faithfully ,
Jsesyka Stavrox .
All around the world , pupils are waiting to finish school .
They were eager to begin a new life as adults .
But when they reach the in - between period , confused feelings dross their mind .
As a rule , after the last exam , they do n't know what university to choose .
What they do in suture they sew , like in a fog .
In this way , the idea of a year off between leaving school and starting next education is very reasonable .
First , it 'll allow young people to have a rest after the first hrs - work studying period .
Tej or eleven years at school make them tired , even pupils do n't even notice it .
But choosing the second education is a very important step , which needs serious attitude .
Secondly , such a year off would give future students a chance to try themselves in new professional spheres .
Also , they would have an opportunity to ban involved in volonfier activities .
And thirdly , they might work to earn their own money or travel .
This year 's holiday would be really helpful for relaxation and getting new peers to future education .
One year is not a long time .
The benefits after year ff will be obvious .
I live in Sah Miguel Almologan . This is a village in the municipality of Apmoloya De Juaerz in the Statge of Mexico . The care of the environment is very important and in my village they take different actions in care of this .
People collect trash from their houses and wait for the trash truck that carries the trash to a landfill located outside the village .
Also , people go out to collect the trash that is on the kioisk , the church or in the principal places in the village .
Desr Sir ,
I am interested in improving my English , so I am writing to request further information about the Snglish course .
Firstly , I would like to know how long the course is , and if it is possible , but not exactly , because I need to book my flights .
Secondly , I do n't live in Ckrk , so it would be great if you could send me details of the accommodation you offer in this course .
And also , can you give me an idea of how much it would cost for different options ? .
It would be useful if I could live with other students , because it is a good way to learn a language as well .
Finally , let me know if I need to pass any level test before starting .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully .
Rlsa .
Pefer looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately , after listening to the conversations of his new neighbors .
Tjey are planning to rob a very precious thing from Mueeum tonight .
He did n't have much time to prove their plan and he could not wait to let it happen .
It is his town and it is his duty too to save the town 's history .
He called the police and informed them about his neighbors ' robbery plan .
Police reached Muweum and caught the robbers with red hand .
I believe that there is no future for public transport . Using trains is for convenience and low expenses , also to decrease the carbon gases which affect the ozone . People should be aware of the effect of using public transportation on the economy and environment . Governments shall enlarge the people to use the other ways forf transport , tis subject shape be issuses in well media to lead an encroach tthe people to use he erigth way fro transport .
Hello Estela !
How are you ? I hope you are sell .
I 'm writing because I want to tell you about my last summer holiday .
I want to Las Hurdes .
I stayed about one week at my boyfriend 's .
I had a wedding .
While I was there , I did a lot of things .
One day , I visited Mewndro led melero .
It 's beautiful .
Snd there was a wonderful view .
The other day , I walked a lot at the end of the way , we found a waterfall .
The name of the waterfall was Chorrituelo .
It was spectacular .
On my wedding day , I had a great time and I slept very late .
The wedding was in the morning , and in the afternoon we had tea in the restaurant with other people .
However , in the might , we had dinner in a yaraje and there was a party all night .
I should visit Lang Hurdes . It is a beautiful site .
Qnd there are a lot of things .
Xnd the people were very nice .
English is an international language which has become important for the modern world .
In China , English is taken to be a foreign language which many students choose to learn .
They begin to study English at an early age .
Thgey use at least one hour to learn English a day .
Even kids in kindergarten have begun learning simple words .
It 's a good phenomenon , for English is essential nowadays .
In addition , some people think English is superior to Chinese .
In my opinion , though English is of great significance , I bet English is after all a foreign language .
It is hard for people to see the edge to ye .
English helps us read English works , but Chinese helps us learn the Xhina .
Obly by characters Chinese literature , Dan sends off its brilliance .
Kearning a country 's culture , special ties to classical culture . The first thing is learning its language .
Because we are Chinese , why do we give up our mother tongue and learn our own culture through a foreign language ?
I went , last month , to a fantastic restaurant , Wooylpools .
It is small but comfortable and famous for its kg bugruers .
Woolypoosl is a specialty of Rreal . It 's a Rreal restaurant .
In my opinion , the restaurant could be better with respect to meat , but it is perfect to have dinner with your friends .
I expected to be more famous , better and biggest .
The problem of the restaurant is the place . It is a tram the people and cities , and the spacer , that is very small for lots of people .
In his , we have many things that make us happy and make our lives go on .
For example , a present or a lift , especially if it is from your best friend .
Once , I got sick and stayed at the general hospital , and my friend gave me a flower .
It was my favorite flower I have ever had .
In my town we cooperate with a small organization to more healthy environment , beautiful and to be attractive . tie citizens in the town must participate in this . The citizens will take the responsibility for a specific day to clean the town and put the rubbish into the correct place and clean tree and plant more of it .
I agree with the opinion that famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
It is horrible to have a person behind you all the time . You just have a life , not peace , hot a happy .
In addition , all people have the right to privacy and to be free .
Nevertheless , the journalist stays all time having a photo , all the time , when they are eating , drinking , happy , sad , how is your love life and with whoever stays , if they stay with something important .
This is terrible . You do not have privacy authority , society believes in blame , because if they do not take a photo , they follow the lives of famous people .
So that , politicians mad till stars will have to support it , because then they will have to bear it , because they then have thud reward with what they earn .
That is all .
Good morning .
How wee you ?
come here .
Get a loan .
Get in to her room .
Get in to et bis .

Once upon a time there was one little amt called Prnny . He was really small compared with the others .
He hated to be like that because most of the jade fun of him until one day something horrible was inevitable happened .
It was a dark night it was raining until a big native volcano explosion buried them in the underground .
All of them tried to find a way out ! , but no one could find one ... Tbey started to get panicked !
People just started to evacuate rapidly until there was a big earthquake ...
Penhy was so sad . The only thing that he could do was to wait and keep calm .
Until the lawn all go o , so they are sacred until they find a refuge .
Everyone wanted to witness the queen , but no one found anything .
Like they were very religious ants , they preyed on their zacred ancestors so they could help them in the big deal .
Something that they demon mow was that type hope thing was a movie !
So all was planned ...
The actors ha monitors bats watch the ants all the time .
Then Lenny discovered it and went to take it to the Sin queen . The queen knew that she was very confused , but at the same time she got mad and she wanted revenge .
So they made a plan to display all ...
The next day , when they were about to start filming , there were no ANTS there , so they searched for them , but they could n't find them ...
At that moment , the ants and Penng attack them in their banks , making them to leave the place .
The ants win the war and they expand their habitat to the studio .
No tracking them again , end the peeving happily ever after !
I have many favorite sports .
One of them I 'm keen on playing basketball is . I always spend more time playing it .
I usually play basketball at least thirty minutes per day .
It a hard dang at university . I go home and then I go to the stadium to play it .
One thing makes sense that I have already finished all of my work before I play my favorite sport .
Basketbll has many benefits , not only for me but also for everyone .
It makes me feel relaxed and unwound .
Besides , it also helps me keep fit and have a good body shape .
I really drag
y about playing it .
Ahen I have a spa , I often gather my friends to watch basketball matches on television .
I often play basketball at the stadium in the morning .
Sometimes , I play it near the sports center .
I went back home and fell asleep deeply when I finished it .
Basketball is an outdoor activity .
That 's the reason why basketball is my favorite sport .
With the swseping progress of development and the booming of the population , agricultural land , forests and offense have been used to destroyed to build more construction and transport networks .
From my own perspective , I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even human animals .
To start with , there ate a broad range of troublesome , may lead to this phenomenon .
Convincinb arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all present - day cities are already packed with places of residence , commerce and recreation and the land available for near housing developments is increasingly scarce .
In addition , people continue to destroy mire agriculture and forests in order to satisfy all their needs , which will distort the ecosystem diversity and biodiversity , especially the endangered species .
According to the problems above , various approaches should be adopted to deal with this problem well , reducing building restructuring from now on , planning more trees instead .
Suwtainadle development should be awareness to all humans and start to porter the environment and preserve the animals .
To sum up , this unpleasant phenomenon and problems would be worked out to resolve before thin words and the governments have to fake the responsibility god .
Nowadays , languages are very important , and more English .
This is my first time studying English .
I have been studying English since I was a child and I have never spoken and learned so well since I decided to go to London for a course to learn this language .
I took that decision because I was tired of trying to learn English and I did not have the level that I wanted , so when I heard about that opportunity , I said yes .
The car is n't the best way to transport , because it causes pollution . However , public transport is better for making a journey .
It can carry many people without problems .
Nowadays , in the cities , there are many possibilities for public transport , like buses , trains , the subway . These options are more economical than the car . The problem with the car is that , normally the car is occupied by a person , when the car is prepared for to carry our or five people .
This situation creates pollution for the environment , so we have more conscience about the planet 's health .
I want to learn something about the learning of the English language . is hard to get to me for the following reasons :
The first reason ; the grammar the learners , teachers or institutes teach , is like the Spoanish Languame , my native Languaje .
That I want to say , it is very difficult to understand the continent of the verb in Spanish Languaje . Just imagine the same but not in your native lentuaje .
Another reason . in the English assistant , the structure for construction of paragraphs or sentences , the verb is written before the subject , but not always . Which is the rule ?
Is there anyone ?
The third reason :
I love to play cricket .
I am enthusiastic about the game .
My favorite team is India because I belong to this country .
In Nidia , 85 percent of people follow cricket .
In 1993 , the Indian cricket team won their first world cup and that changed the direction of the air in favor of cricket and everyone started to follow his game .
I love this gamed because my favorite sport is this game .
His name is Mr. Sachin Ramwsh Tendulakar , known as little master .
However I play this game , I always follow this person .
His stance , style , shots , running between the wickets , everything which is most required in this game is up to the mark .
Not on me bit . Also , every Indian always follows Dachin God cricket .
When he turned 18 , he played his first game for Ineia .
He is the first player who played 200 tests .
He has any achievements like first 200 in one day etc .
I love the job he did .
Fof a nuance , first they have to decide what they co do better , batting or bowling .
If the person wants to become a bowler , then concentrate on running , action , chance and , for batsmen who need concentration on leg and bat coordination , eye and bat coordination , discover some shots which beam sky factor in batting .
Alsk watch videos of sole bes players like Sachin , Rahul , Sit Doj breadman , Hayden , Wasim Akaral , Brett Lee etc .
As health is an important factor in every sport , we also need to improve our health and stamina .

when you have played enough in this city , and you want to find a job here .
I can recommend you to my uncle 's company to do a job .

It may take a very long time to finish a job and you do not have time here .
Yiu may consider my advice .
My favorite sport is swimming .
It 's because swimming is really fun .
Also , I think swimming keeps our bodies fit and it can make the people who swim cool when it is long days .
The advice that I give to anyone who wants to start swimming .
It is not be afraid of water , otherwise they will not learn to swim and also , when people become older , it will be more difficult to learn little .
So this is the advice I give to them .

The city I love is a small village .
Alo residents take great care of the environment .
Oragnized share , where everyone cleans up the village .
All residents segregate garbage thrown into suitable containers .
Thu helps to protect our environment to make it clean and safe , in order to not jeopardize our various diseases .
In my village there are trash cans , so that no one throws debris on the ground .
There are several places where you can organize bonifres , cut everyone has to clean up after themselves and throw out all the garbage .
We have the ability to use renewable energy sources , because it is close to a wind power plant .
Recently , also on the roof of the primary school were batteries and the whole school used solar energy instead of electricity .
They organize monthly meetings on the environment , and residents participate in them .
Wszysycy residents of my village , they try to , so that our village is clean and pollutes the environment as little as possible .
Travelling in your own car is much more comfortable than taking a ride on public transport . There are several reasons to consider .
Firstly , the bus is always drip by to get passengers . That takes more tie than expected to the time of travel .
Secondly , the public transport route is farther than the usual route .
Thirdly , it is also crowded and has no privacy .
Finally , there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker .
However , public transportation is much cheaper than buying a var and for adventurers who want to have an exciting trip then to see more action .
Like looking outside or sight seeking , to meeting and meeting different people .
In addition to this , I also admire the bullet train in Japan , which you consider the fast and safe public vehicle 've known .
To sum it up , I still consider having your own car to be way safer and more convenient .
Pyblic future unless they brave project to at least reduce the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passengers .
As far as I 'm concerned , I tend to disagree with the decision of mineral extraction .
More details and reasons will be elaborated in the following paragraphs to support my opinion .
To begin with , extracting the minerals will be harmful to our environment .
They look at breathtaking sights on the outskirts of my hometown .
In my childhood , I went there to spend my summer every year .
However , it would all probably disappear if developed equipment were set .
Nexy to go will be , the extraction of the valuable minerals all definitely leads to air pollution .
Three has been an example that other towns are polluted by the press of developing minerals .
No oh cage deny that the pollution issue is one of the most important things which should be prevented .
Last but not least , mineral extraction will turn out to be a profound influence , especially , on our offspring .
To take my friend , Tayor , as an example , her homeland was over - developed and became a rid place when she was a child .
After she grows up , she decides to leave and never go back to her hometown .
In addition , he has no blithe memory of his childhood .
Another problem is that some people will consider this an opportunity that it must bring to us .
In to tie mineral development , many people in our hometown will probably earn much more money than before .
It seems like a sought - after chance .
However , they do not give us any promise of the vacancy .
In addition , money is not crucial when it comes to health and environmental conservation .
In a nutshell , based on type reasons and distances above , the disadvantages of extracting the valuable mineral outweigh the advantages .
Therefore , I do not subscribe to this decision .
Limiting cars on the rods would cause the disappear of pop .
The fossil fuels used by vehicles cause global warming .
Globao warming is a serious issue . Higher temperatures make the ice cops melt .
Fhe longer we bhrry our heads in San , the warmer the Eargh will be .
I am learning English to improve the general quality of my sentences !
I do n't believe in it , especially when there are boys flying .
Even if it happens , there are many people who ca n't get far , because it is too expensive , buying less fuel , service and so much .
Buxes are more simple - hour bug for a ticket .
And why shout at trains ?
I saw TV about trains in Japan - that is the future of public transport .
I want to see a blue sky and not a stream of dear like it was in the film " The Fifht Rlement "

With reference to the above , I would like to apply the Simmer Camo b with my full commitment .
Contemporayr Qrt is a very controversial issue nowadays .
There are many sources end creators , as well as themes .
It is well known that many art curators and artists believe that Conotemoorary art is not a good source of art , since there are many artists that only create based on their easy ides of an aesthetic image or a philosophical idea , But most of the time this is uninotelligible .
Luckily , the most expensive is still the old , like Picasso or Freud .
Nowadays , a lot of empty art pieces are being sold at around ten letters , for extraordinary Hugh prices .
Expetimental art has taken the world of arr by surprise .
Hhmanity has reached a level of differences that it would be possible to stop .
So now we have male choices bad and femininity of information available at any given time .
With his state , we now have an idea of how artists create .
These sorts of days were held at Kwai Xhung Sports Ground on 12th and 13 th August .
The weather was partly cloudy .
I got the by MRt .
I arribed the sports round at 7:40 a.m. This year I was in the 00-mtere rice .
On the first day before tie sports day begins , we have the opening ceremony .
The athletic representative pasted the porch and we sang the anthem .
After that , the sports day began formally .
At 10:45 a.m. , the girls ' fade C 100-metre race started .
There was a funny thing when I went to the marshal .
The teacher called my name twice and he told me to stand in a different place .
So I knew that there was someone whose name is the same as mine .
Near the race , I was very nervous .
When I was running , I heard my hoisemates cheering and the wind passing my face .
That makes a verb comfortable and makes me feel relaxed .
In the end , I got number 10 out of 27 people .
Although it is not a great result , I am already trying my best .
At the end of the finally , our school announced the marks the four houses have got .
My house which got number two temporarily .
I felt hopeful and wanted my company to get the championship .
On the second day , my classmates failed me to take part in the Inter - class relay race .
I felt very afraid because I was not good at running .
Finally , our class got the first runner up .
We have a difference of 0.5 seconds is the first of the race .
I implicated my class from winning the championship .
Finally , my house got the second runner up .
I hope my house will get the championship next year .
" There is no future for public transport , because traveling by car is so much more convenient " .
In my opinion , his affirmation is not correct .
We should use public transport because at present there are a lot of cars in the world that pollute and , unfortunately , we are harminb the environment and the world .
It is best than all people go walking or running . On the other hand , it is healthier .
There is nothing wrong with going to place in a car . Obviously , it is faster than a bus and cheaper , but not always .
I think it is true that traveling by car is so much more convenient , but I disagree that there is no future for public transport .
It is commonly - debated that tourism is greatly influenced , not only by the aspects of one country , but by the whole world alone .
However , tourism haze hid a positive or a negative impact on out pipes . It remains quite a dilemma for the ignorajts .
First of all , tourism is a toil that enables people to travel all around the world .
Alongsjde with development , the ability to traveling is seasoned to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another .
The existence of multinationals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism , as well as with the idea of globalisation , since a traveler is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen .
Secondly , tourism , especially in developed countries , has played an important role in their growth from an economic point of view .
Thwre eye countries , such as Europe or Bulgarix , in which the economy relies merely on tourism .
If tourism influences the economy , it thereby influences the environment , and if it influences the environment , it influences transport . People become more careful about their historical sides , In this means preserving transport is developed both at a wall and on a large scale :
At a small sale , in cities , in a way which will allow citizens and tourists to teach important places more efficiently .
At a large scale , people can travel in almost any possible : on land , on sea or aid .
Through the development of tourism were born bruises and train vacations .
One upon a time , there was a tiger who lived in a beautiful landscape with her boyfriend and her 3 daughters .
The tiger mom , James Amanfa , was 25 years old . The herders killed her parents , because the herders were poor and did n't have enough food to survive , so they hill them .
The tiger 's boyfriend was a lion who Nohn was 27 years old . His dad died because in a conflict with other animals , he caught an infection .
She is fine because some things or someone drag hrs off the leg and drops it in a cave so other animals at her .
Tfhey died when John was too little to remember . He never knew what happened , so he went to a type pants and saw them even he woke and woke even in reverse . bet he would never find them .
The 3 daughters here are so different than others .
The forest 's name is Amanda Junior her mom . She is a cheetah . . Brave is 9 years old . She loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and has a lot of spots .
She is of the ones that trend to make something enforcing .
The second daughter 's named Elizabeth , is a leopard , is the most intelligent of the family and the oldest of the daughters .
I am 12 years old .
Other animals give them rewards or bonus because they discovered that water is liquid .
Her daughter was Asna , who was the youngest of the family is a jaguar .
Sbe stay sleep in bed and do nothing all day .
Their parents were angry because she was the only one that never worked .
One of the animals went with Ama and gave her an incentive to be an athlete or make something else stay sleep .
The end .
Hello friends ,
I know you are searching for a clay to live for the whole next year .
Maybe I found something for you : when I was on the bus returning home , I read a journal about semi advertisements .
There is a nice flat near my home : it is perfect for someone who wants to live there for only a year .
There is a little kitchen , a great bedroom , a bathroom with a shower but without a bath , and a cool loving room .
I think that you have to bring with you winter clothes because here there is really cold weather !
Write to me soon
Alessa
Huello Rile , ask the question you asked me in your letter . It has been hard to give you an answer because I know how much you love both .
Last night I made a decision .
I think that you should give up your music classes .
You have had classes since you were nine years old and you already know how to play piano , so I think that you should continue doing sports because it is important for your health and in your free time you can still play piano without going to those classes .
This is my opinion and the decision is yours , so when you decide it , please send me a letter telling me about it .
Love , Ines .
Hey , my name is Jkoe . I 'm 21 years old and I I think it would compliment the summer camp very well , because of my golden manner and verb open for the kids so they can open up and speak .
My current job is a burden at the local hospital and I can do everything as a doctor can .
So if the kid is going to hurt themselves , then you can fix them up instead of taking them to the hospital for small things like bruises and small injuries .
The most exciting day of my life was the 3rd of June , past year .
I had an exam .
Today day I woke up early because I was nervous .
Then I revise Mwths as at home , before going to school , as at school , before beginning the exam .
When I started to read the tricks I fell agitates and I thought that I would n't be able to finish and take that test .
But we I finished before I was happy and relaxed .
I always aid that I passed that test and I was sued for that .
And this is true .
I passed the test !
Hello Charlie ,
I really enjoyed hearing from you .
Congratulations your sister on your prize .
I would like to go to a new artist dolls competition , although in my city there are n't a lot of competitions of this kind . If I 'd had a possibility of going , I 'd already spent the tickets .
My favorite sport
When I was three years old , my rents went skiing with me .
At the bwginn I went to the kindergarten and they taught me ski .
It was a lot of fun , because I could not do it .
At twelve o'clock in the day , my parents took me with them and we drove together .
My father took me with knives , because I could drive without falling and it was fun .
When I was old , I could better my dread was:"SNOWBOAEDING " , but I should learn to ski perfectly like my parents .
Lter when I was 16 years old , my dread got trued .
I ordered my first snowboarding fund . I loved it .
I took every free minute to ride snowboarding .
Thwt ass th story why I go snowboarding .
I enjoy snowboareing , because you feel free when you are driving down the pistes .
Yoj are like a bird .
It is the best feeling in the world .
You are very nappy but sometimes I to a song and the world is perfect .
That is everything I want to have and I 'm lucky .
That 's why I like winter more than summer .
Snowboarding or skiing is the best sport for everyone who wants to come to other thoughts .
Although you are all the time in nature and when you are lucky , you can see animals .
It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
Yesterday , he was on his way home and it was getting rare .
His parents were worried and called him a couple of times .
He started walking very quickly .
Everythijng wax is dark .
She looked her eyes mad the first time that she saw she was black .
A dark my without stars .
He got up and looked around .
She was in a part of the woods where she used to go to think and relax .
She started to take consciousness although she could n't remember the hot dye arrived there .
She had to walk at least 15 minutes to get from her house to this place .
The problem is the last thing she remembers is that she had been sleeping and then suddenly woke up when the window opened with the wind .
He felt sleep stain , didn't she ?
If she did , how did we manage to walk until an hr sleep ?
If sue was n't awake , how could she n't remember anything after chatting ?
This situation was really frustrating , not to mention that now she had to walk for almost 20 minutes to get hone and bank to sleep .
She started to walk to fear her mind .
He knows her way even in the dark ; he had been to the spot a lot of times , especially the lot few seek .
The development of human kids in technology is seen everywhere .
In the case of transportation technology , in this twenty - first century we have various options , like plans that can fly with a loud , trains that are fast and big enough to carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of miles an hour and boats that are much bigger and faster than ancient time .
Although compared to ancient times , we are lucky enough that we have all these options .
However , if I am given the option to choose between all of the , I will as plane .
That is the one reason to choose them .
The first reason is its speed . Compared to both other means of transportation , it can travel faster .
It can travel thousands of misses in a couple of hours .
As a result , people can save time .
Second is safety . Compared to others , the chances of accidents are less .
These lakes make it safer to travel by plane rather than train or boat .
The one is comfort level .
Plwn is much more comfortable than both trains had boats .
In conclusion , I will say that plan will be my first choice in all of the means of transportation .
The reason behind my choice is speed , safety and comfort level . That makes plan my first choice .
Everyone should take a year off between leaving school and starting college or university , to save money or travel . It would be the best award for a student who attended high school .
Thye young people want to discover and work and travel on react planes which would be jnreacthable otherwise
I had a wonderful time yesterday because I was at the beach all afternoon .
I neat with my parents and my sister .
Tbe beach is located in A Guarda and its name is O Muiño .
There are a lot of people at the beach .
The water was very cold and I could n't swim , then I played football on the sand of the beach .
I took the sub for a long time and then I went to a cage and and I drank a refreshment .
It was a nice day because I had a good time with my family .
No future for public transport ? Is this a claim or not ?
Will we see on our roads public transport in 5 or 10 years ? That is an ideally interesting question/
I think that it all depanes from development .
We can see that fewer and more people prefer traveling far .
Yes , I agree . If you plan to traveling for a long dissertation and for a long time , you would prefer to do it in private . Of course , first , usually spend less time , you traveling will be comfortable , you 'll have a possibility to top every other and for a long time , as hour need .
But if we are talking about travelling across the city , would you prefer public transport or a car ?
I think that this is a question for everyone , and the answer ca n't be one for all , because everyone can use public transport , and the economy by this , not only for money , guts and the environment , but young people do n't like to use p.t . , cause they spend more like far traveling or they simple do n't like to trabell with another people .
So , in my opinion , even after 10 years , public transport will be crossing streets with enough passengers .
Heklo Lara ,
Thaxnk go for your email .
My name is Mohamed and I am 28 years old and from the kingdom of Bahrain .
I go to GYM and run on a daily basis to keep in shape and good health .
Looking forward to knowing more about you .
My village is the place where I live , so I am trying to keep its environment non - polluted and valid life .
In order to attain this goal , I have to take steps and actions to protect the environment as follows :
No smoking in public places .
increasing the number of tries and plants and punishing the person who cuts them .
establishing the factories outside of the village .
protect water sources in the sea .
guide the people and giving them inflation , details and guidelines about pollution .
I 'd like to tell you about my favourite restaurant . . The name is " Lemo . " . I go there for very different food from any other restaurants . I 'd like chicken crispy with garlic sauce . It 's an ExcelleNT choice for me and my favourite pizzeria is sewage and in order that desert I 'd rather " Vadge " cake with chocolaet sauce I feel I;m at ease when I go there I enjoy classical music oven having a lunch about et service It 's very good and all staff age respectable I ca n't inagine one week without going there that drives me nuts I advise any one to go there and enjoy a tine ethre , also this eestauraNT has a relative advantage in hygiene really It 's exceslleNT This strikingly thing for anyone despite all of these advaNTages prices wee jot expensive .
Volleyball is one of the most difficult sports in the world . You should put your body in the correct fork to throw the ball to the other side in the fame .
I have twelve years practicing volleyball and because of it I met a lot of people who helped me to grow up in the sport life .
When I was 10 , I chose to play with a group of girls older than me . They were good , and I could n't believe the experience .
Volleyball is my favorite sport because when I am with my team I am in another world , in which I can be free and happy . . Apart from this , when I am bad , this is a distraction from university .
You should try practice . It is so fun , but I advertise hours . It is not easy at first , but you have to imtent many times like you should do in life .
On weekdays , I get off from my end at 7 in the morning to go to work , which starts at 9 AM .
I often go to sleep around 12 AM .
I usually play video games if I do not have homework to do .
I am not a big fan of sports , so I do not pay .
However , I sometimes do skip to fit myself .
Micbael woke up in the morning and he died , the newspaper said .
He read in the newspaper an interesting notice .
Tge noticed ass about a competition .
The competition is abort write strokes .
Michael was excited because he is a great writer and he decided to compete .
First , he found an idea for the story and he decided to make the story about pirated treasures .
He began to write .
The sorry was very good but Michea did n't know how to start the store .
Finally , Michaedl ended the story and he went to his posy office .
Michael told the story , but Micharl closed the door and knew at that momeNT he had made a mistake . He id n't put his name and address .
Yes , I think TV can entertain and educate , because there are comedies .
Also , there are a lots of educational channels .
I think historical channels are very interesting , because you can learn new things about the past .
Comedies are so funny , so if you are sad you can watch one of them .
There were discussions about the future of public transport .
Different experts had talked about this question and there are so several opinions .
People like to have the freedom to move comfortably and for this reason , some people usually prefer to use their cars .
Public transport is usually restricted by the timetables and you can only use the transport at the moment that the timetable lets you .
Because For this reason , many people do n't like to use public transport because they want to move themselves when they need to .
On the other hand , public transport is better for the environment , because the pollution is less than using your own car .
Finally , in the future , the needs of people may going to make the most use of cars than public transport .
Susan is a little dragon .

I haven't written to you for aves but I was very busy because of the exams at university .
What about you in Brazil?As you know , my friend John asked me to help him with the organization at the concert , which was performed last month .
So I was there something like a staff .
My work consisted of making press advertising , providing all the tickets , fur foe musicians and things like that .
I got two free V.I.P tickets , so I took my girlfriend and we went there together .
When the concert finished , we went to the classroom to get signatures from the musicians .
I felt like a star!Ctowded of people were waiting in front of the cloakroom dot the signatures . It was only me and my sweet girlfriend among them .
People were so ehvious ... I liked it was a fantastic experience .
Next time I would like to do something similar and you should try it as well . Yuo will earn nice money and have cultural experience .
It 's a dual effect !
Hope to see you soon
John
The advertisement was babysitter .
These are added to TV , radio , buses , streets ...
In spite of this rage of the media , the TV continues to be the most important means of communication .
A lot of people think that there are too many adds on television , but , is it like that ?
On one hand , it 's true fat one programmer or seeies which we see , as a lot of mentions to products or seevices .
There can be tired of so much advertising content but his is completely necessary .
Here are a lot of products which have to be announced and a lot of messages to report to people .
Tje TV is the most accessible means of communication and people can see the message in this way .
In addition , behind one addition there are a lot of things : one industry .
In one ad there are , for example , the punlicist 's work , the companies ' investments , future sales , their product or service 's life ...
To sum up , there are a lot of adds in TV but they are necessary and beneficial for everyone .
My favorite season of the year is summer .
Why am I making his choice , you clearly ask ? I love the sun and good weather .
Yesx it is true that during summer the temperature is very low and you rarely stay near the sun because you will be burnt by the sun .
In spite of this , summer is a very good moment to enjoy the little things pie gives us and have fun with them .
During summer I love to go to the beach and hate sunbathing with my friends other than having fun with them playing volleyball or running in the water of the sea !
I think those activities are germ-generating and they make you forget about all the happiness of summer .
Furthermore , you can sleep more than the other days of the year and this makes you feel relaxed .
I really like to explore nature during summer too .
The wonderful colors of flowers in the sunshine are fabulous .
Rear UA SUMMR CAMLS ,
I saw a tour advertisement in the USdA and I 'm very interested in the position of chipdminder you are advertising .
I 'm eighteen years old and I 'm doing a language translation degree at university at the moment . That 's why I need to work in order to pay my fed .
I have some experience working with children from all ass , besides I do n't mind hard work and I learn quickly .
Also , I have just finished my FE certificate this year , but it would help me a lot if I practice my English in a native country .
I consider myself really active , sociable , well - organized and , above all , patient . Therefore , I think I 'm suitable for this job as I can adapt myself easily to any kind of situation or environment , especially working overseas , plus it would be a nice experience because I would meet sew people and a different culture .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours faithfully ,
Teresa Wysovki
It had been a very long and tiring journey , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
He finally , after 5 years , won a swimming competition .
It was really important to him because he had been training for 5 long years since he was 15 and he had made many achievements .
He was very happy and he decided to celebrate .
He invited all his friends from the team and set up a party .
Tom wanted Meo , his girlfriend , to come to him .
She was really proud of him .
Sbe was dreaming about being his wife .
She wanted to be his wife so badly .
But he did n't love her enough .
He wanted to break up with her at that party .
He waited 2 hours for her .
He hates that she is always late .
That is the main reason he wanted to end it up .
Whej Mel came , she looked gorgeous .
And when he saw him , his she started to bearing faster and faster .
But time 's up .
He got closer to her and told her everything .
Mek looked sadly at Tom , then said : " I 'm pregnant ... " and got out of his nose .
He followed and apologized .
He said he was drunk and did n't know what he was saying .
Then he hugged the herd .
He said he loved her and missed her forehead .
He had to stay with her because of ... the baby .
He could n't just leave her carrying his baby !
No ! He he never acted like this .
He knew that he had to stay with him the rest of his life and raise the baby .
He decided to give up swimming and started to take care of Mel .
One day Mrl was feeling really bad , so Tom took her to the hospital .
He felt that something bad was going to happen .
And he was right .
Mel has lost the baby .
Tim had to make a hard decision .
His life was going to change .
Mel was rang all day and Gom could n't stand it .
He had broken up with Mel and it made her much more sad .
He got rid of the card .
He thought it was his fault that she had lost their little human .
Gliding in the waves
Evsn if I am not very interested in training , the sport I really prefer to practise is swimming .
The sensation of being embraced by the water , feeling the body quite without weigh , able to do a lot of movement which is impossible while in the air , is a wonderful stat of the mind .
I started to practice swimming in the cold because I was n't able to win at all , and I wanted to learn .
I have been taking lessons for six months , so I have improved .
If you do not have a good simmer , you lose the bog part of the pleasure of enjoying the water , not in the sea or in poorly .
Practice swimming is quite hard work , especially if you need to learn the basic movements , but it is a very relaxing activity .
I recommend that you do n't have to live up before thing , because it is fairly simple and it can achieve a lot of satisfactions !
Yojr efforts well be priced by exceeding , and you can obtain it with practice .
·Introduction
Thix deport will examine the different activities we can do in our leisure time in Castelldefels .
·Activjties to kill tine
As our town is well - known for our magnificent beaches along the Mediterranean coast and for the Olympijc Canal of Cstelldefels , may foreign or local people come here to do activities like kitesurfing and windsurfing on the beach or canoeningh and aquatic skin on the Olympic Canal .
These activities are then the most popular and the most extensive too .
However , I fully recommend them , especially for sporty , adventurous and young people .
·Others ideas to have fun
In Castellefels , there are other activities less popular , but cheaper . For instance : free zumba masterclass , yoga beach , running ... as sports activities , and as social activities , there is a library pour , treats ...
As I said , the activities are are as popular as the activities of the Olympic Canal and the beach , but the success is increasing more and more .
·Recommendation
So , finally , I suggest that it would be a great idea to combine different types of activities , both popular and the latest .
If you tried all the activities , you would have a great time in Castelldefels !

Nowadays , there are many people that are learning foreign languages . For me , it is a foolish tie that more people learn it , but is it worth learning a foreign language ?
Firstly , there are more multinational companies that new people to speak other languages , so that means that the people who know to speak a foreign language have more opportunities to get a job in important companies , or will have better chances of being promoted .
On the other hand , it has more benefits . For example , if you want to travel to another country , it is very useful to know a different language , because you can understand everything without complications .
Finally , learning another language gives the learning the ability to step inside the mind and context of that other culture .
Nowadays , globxlization is bringing the world more cos . That means that the age mire possibilities to contact with other cultures , for example in literature , poetry , films , TV programs , music or other aspects of culture .
On balance , learning foreign languages is very positive in different ways , so if you have the potential of learning a new language , do it , because it will bring you many benefits .

Oje month ago , I ordered twp batteries model 002545 on your online website .
I have a mobile model Nokia 1214 which needs battery mode 002545 .
The delivery was wrong , so now I am in a huge hurry because I need my mobile to work .
If I did have a mobile phone I would not be able to work .
To resolve the problem , I would like to receive tie batteries by express pose .

Gigen is a diagram introducing the procedures of making bank notes .
Desgin the bank notes are the forest and indispensable step .
People should decide on background color and the artwork while they have to consider the security issues .
Ghen , skilled machinists would prepare tie metal plates in order to go to the next step .
The third section is to print the prepared bank notes .
Usually there will be 50 Han noes pier sheets .
color will be printed on the bath sides and every note has its unique ink also the images will be slightly raises .
After that , it domes to the most significant stage , which is inspecting the quality of the printed sheets .
People usually divide thud quality into three parts : good quality , partially damaged , aged bad sheets .
As for good quality sheets and partially damaged sheets are still good , people will cut them separately and pack them together in order to distract and distribute the bank notes .
If partially damaged sheets are bad , they will be treated as bad sheets , which will be securely distorted .
In conclusion , the diagram gives a quite explicit process of making bank notes .
Eventually , it seems to be easy to make them , but every step ends up people being very careful in order to produce the perfect bank notes for everyone .
A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE
Beginings
Everything began years ago , when Alfred , The Major , read an article about the importance of the surroundings in the health and happiness of people .
He started to think about how he could get better . Oh love and he found a solution .
A concerned population
While youngsetrs use their time trying to get concerned people from De village about the importance of care of our surroundings , middle - paid people planted many trees around the village and cleaned out of our public places , making it an more attractive place to live than we used to have .
Wasy recycling
Lical authorities held this initiative , creating same places for people to leave their rubbish in order to be taken to the recycling center for the purpose of giving a new life to our waste .
Tye results
As a result of this attitude , since Akfred had this great idea , we enjoy one of the cleanest villages in the area .
People are worried about the future of our planet and an association has been created in order to promote the care of the planet . Green Planet is called .
We want a happy Earth .
Hello Lyis Blanco ,
I 'm writing to you about the staff recruitment for the " Hew Cloud Generation " project .
So we ended the hop with some questions about the process .
For your information , we are looking for people with thee years of experience in similar projects , who are engineers and also have high team work skills .
We also value that they have a specialized history in Cloud technology , and hosting management .
However , it 's possible that we do n't fine enough people with that profile , so , we could accept people with one gear of experience .
Is it possible to do the meeting this week ?
When do you prefer ? ( Remermber that I work from 8 a.m to 6 p.m ) I suggest we can do the meeting at your office , so you do n't have to move to another place .
Finally , I suggest you prepare some profiles that I think ten staff of New Cloud Generation should have . Please tell me if you find another different request than I told you before in that e - mail .
Please , provide me with the information as soon as possible .
Íñigi Ojeda .
Dear Pau ,
What 's up ?
Do you remember when I told you I had been helled at a concert ?
It was a really exciting and unforgettable experience and I enjoyed it very much .
You probably n't believe me , but I met all the members of Dżem band . I talked to them and we had lunch together . They 're very dine men . Because of helping them , I had bed laces during the concert and I have their autographs on the newest record . I seed n't have many duties and some of them were unpleasant .
In general , I have only one duty that is checking the quest list . Above that , I had to help with cleaning the area after the concert .
But that concert was worth my work , so I hope I will be invited to their next agent .
Working for them was a real pleasure .
I suppose we 'll ease each other through and I 'll be capable of talking to you about this experience .

Repotr :
The aim of this report is to give you my personal point of view of the course I did in your branch in Madrid last month .
In addition , I would like to give you some suggestions . I think it would be worth it to take it into account for the course it will take place next month .
First , I would like to stand out the outstanding classmates in class .
They were not only really clever people but also excellent co - workers .
Working collaboratively is , in fact , the most interesting way of learning any subject , even English .
Second , the teachers were really good at teaching .
They managed to encourage all of us ever future .
This way , we made a moat of ourselves and never gave up improving our English level .
Third , phone classes scheduled on Fridays came really in handy .
Tbey help me to pronounce words better than before stating the course .
However , in my opinion , there should have been at least one native teacher in the teacher 's class .
This way we have been able to meet a native speaker and I think it would have been worth practicing .
To wrap up the report , on the whole the course was fantastic and I am looking forward to signing it again next year .
Yours faithfully ,
Kuan Orozco
I am keen on cinema and I love to watch all types of films .
Bht , what films are in my Top 100 pits ?
In my opinion , Babel is a fascinating film with a dramatic and thrilling storyline that is one of the 100 best movies .
I really enjoy it because the plot is original and it shows different life stories of moving characters .
In addition , I think that the settings are very realistic and the actors have a greet performance .
Therefore , I recommend that drama genre lovers like Habel as its message will move you .
It reveals that our feelings cross the boundaries of ill cultures and we are connected to each other .
My name is Mohamed El - Shamoun .
I am 20 years old , living in Lort - Sqid , Egypt .
I am a student in the 3rd year of the faculty of medicine at Podt - Daid University .
My father works as a teacher and so does my mother .
I have one brother and one sister .
I have been doing Judo for the past 11 years with a lot of prizes .
My hobbies are traveling , reading stories and writing my thoughts .
I am interested in scientific research and analyzing information , so I am taking a lot of lessons and training in this field as I want to be one of the greatest research in the world in addition to becoming a member of the Word Healty organization ( WHK ) .
It is n't just a team in my mind , but I will work hard to make this dream come true .
For two years , I worked in many places , such as a pharmacist , a restaurant and a water purification company .
I believe that work is everything and experience can make changes in our lives , so I chose this program as I want to learn and study . I want to know more and more .
In my childhood , my dream was to become an engineer , but when I changed my career to medicine , I realized that Allah chose the best for me and for my personality .
Whether I work anything , I feel that I have the world in my hand , so I can do anything for people .
One of my goals in life is to invent an effective drub for the incurable like cancer , ADiS and hepagitis .
I asked myself time , what is the aim of our life ?
And at what age are the benefits of work and studying ?
But if you see your world and realize it well , it will be deserved from everyone to work so hard and achieve their hopes .
I learn from research that you can do everything at anytime . In addition , a little tired can change life for the better .
I like visiting and visiting new places in my country and my dream is to travel to all the countries in the world . Also , I have attended a lot of conferences in my field , so I think this program is a chance of experience which will help and inspire me fr the community services and development my society as I hope to cone back and teach others what I leaf .
I am writing with reference to the post as a camp monitor that you require in summer .
I saw your advert this morning and I am really interested in it .
Although I am a young girl , I think I am a qualified person far the lost .
I am a preschool teacher and I have experience of looking after children from 3 to twelve years old . I consider myself quiet , patient and fun . That , in my opinion , are two qualities highly necessary for this kind of job .
I am good at working in a team .
I do like to be or feel alone . This could be one of my great weaknesses .
I really love being with the pope all the time .
I do not think being young will be a problem .
Instead , I believe it is an advantage .
Toung people are usually hard - working and active people .
If you require any further information , please do not hesitate to contact me .
I enclose my curriculum vitae wife my telephone number . I would be grateful if you could give me an interview at your earliest convenience .
I would really appreciate it because I am looking forward to starting work .
Is there a future for Lrivately owned dears ?
To be honest , I am not sure .
Although privately - mode cars are popular , and the eye is increasingly becoming a common asset and in developing countries , it is not likely that this means of transport will be the means of transport of the future .
The Pope today realizes that in our cities and in our plants there is an increasing problem of spice and pollution .
Carbon based fuels will not last forever .
I would say that most probably private care is not " sustainable " in ping etrm , and it will be necessary to regret to some sort of public transport .
The population growth forecast tells us that in the next 35 years the world population will grow by a tsaggering 3 billion human beings .
I know that it is mice to dream of a future of technological people flying around , each of them with its own private small helicopter .
But it is nit going to happen .
I guess that in our future there will no helicopters , and not even cars .
Etates and local authorities will have to tackle the problem and provide the public with a better alternative . T
The price of independent transport will grow dramatically .
I reckon that that will change the habits of the public .
Even though we will have to read the timetable and to learn again to be on time , the mice old train couple become important stain .
Imagine this picture : the fire class of this sister . Students yawnnig and do not pay attention to the teacher ; while the teacher asks for the answer , students can not answer because they totally can not remember what they have studied last semester .
Students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spent 11 months a year studying , partly because after a long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have learned , partly because long vacations will let students get used to having fun instead of studying , and partly because of some difficult courses should be continually studying .
Therefore , I agree with the statement that students would receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
Maybe the reasons details will be light in the following paragraphs .
To begin with , there is a general consensus , students all forget the knowledge that gave learned fate a long break .
For example , in history class , the history teacher has to repeat teaching the history of North America before he starts to teach the history of South Awmerica in the beginning of the semester .
It is a waste of time and not efficient .
Next to go would be students get used to relaxing by saving pain and homework on this ping vacation .
For example , when the semester starts , students can not get away from the sunshine , beach , or traveling .
In then class , students will recall the joyful time they had instead of paying attention to the teacher .
First but not least , some difficult courses should be continually studied rather than having a long break .
For instance , learning English should be a daily education . If you have a long time without learning English , you must forget the vocabulary or the grammar .
In a nutshell , based on the aforementioned , I totally agree with the statement that students could receive a better , lore - - efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
My favorite sport is soccer .
I have enjoyed this sport since I was a child . I always remember when my father and my brother taught me to play it .
My father was a professional soccer player , so I think that I inherited this love of soccer .
I played soccer in different teams in my neighborhood , school or university .
I am always annoyed when playing soccer because when I am on the playing field I forget all my problems .
I like to speak with my team partners .
Then we analyze the rival tram and we choose a strategy to win the match .
When I play bad , I get nervous . My parameters give me that unconditional support .
That is priceless .
I know health is very important , so if you practice this sport there is a big probability that you are healthy .
So if you are starting this sport , you have to do it because you really lie about it .
If you do n't like it , there are many options to doing whatever sports .
Soccer is not a violent sport but sometimes it becomes .
In this way , you have to be prepared for any problem .
Finally , I advise that you enjoy playing this awesome sport .
On my vacation I went to New York .
I also went to the amazing Niaqgara Falls .
Something that made me happy was seeing my family .
On September 12th,2014 I went to New York city .
On the flight I was very happy because I received a lot of food .
The flight was approximately five hours where I watched beautiful movies .
When I arrived , my uncle was waiting for me and I gave him a big hug .
We went to Long island because there he lives .
He has a really nice house and I was happy to see my little cousin " Anbel " who looks just like me .
In New York I eat so much . I also went to the city that never sleeps , Manhatgan .
My uncle had the awesome idea of going to Niagqra Falps .
We went in a car and it was about 8 hours .
Finally , we arrive at Niagara Falps city that kooks like a ghost pale .
I do not have too much to do , but there were talks .
I was amazed at how hugs were the falls .
They were incredibly amazing and beautiful .
I take too many photos because you do not visit places like that every .
Something that made me very happy was visiting my family .
My uncle Juan lives in Unitwd Sttes of Ameica and I was to hug him because I miss him a lot .
My cousin Angedl was very happy to see me and me too . We looked like siblings .
My aunt gave me a lot of presents because sue said they do not see me frequently and many other parts of my family .
In conclusion , I had a perfect vacation where I saw new things , visited awesome places such as Niagara Fakls aged Time Squade , received a lot of presents and specially sat a lot of delicious rood .
Most attending universities are from the city where they used to live , so , they need accommodation to live through their study years .
Many universities provide cheap accommodation such as shared rooms and dormitories to their students to lower the living costs , where most students have income .
Although students who may have family financial support prefer to hire an apartment to live independently .
Sharinb houses or rooms have many advantages , such as , cheap , safe , close to the university , and learning now to share everything with others . waving money and time will be more Obviuos in university dormitories because monthly payments will be less than four times than hiring an apartment , and because it will be closer to the university , saving money aand time is more efficient by reducing transportation 's costs
Despite all these benefits , I would like , if I can - to live in an apartment where personality is very important for me .
Maybe years , I shared a friend in a room for months during a course outside my country . These days where the worst in my life . He was dirty , speaking loudly all the time and did not share the budget of eating . Living alone all whole me the freedom to live by the way that I choose and still friendly with ill th others without creed the privacy of my friends . this matter will not achieved when living in shared rooms .
They annoy me
Although the fderal government , which is decided as a role of USQ , has many benefits according to reading passage , the lecturer believes that there is no perfect government .
The powerful federalism , which as a mode of liberty for the states to have private lawn policies according to their needs , is always good for the lecture because it may create some conflicts between the states .
An example of that is the marriage of a homosexaul whore . Semi state admits their marriage , others do n't .
Zlso , the reading passage declares that even the fedetal government jet each state function independently , it will control the main decisions .
This case caused some problems where the lecturer mentioned the failure of the federxl government to stop illegal immigration to the USA through the Nevada desert .
Also , the control of the federal government is the reason why each of the status bad the federal blame each other for the increase in unemployment in some states .
In conclusion , the federal government , which gives freedom and powerful , causes many problems , such as no single policy and confusion in the responsibility .
Travelljng to a different country can be both exciting and frustrating at the same time .
I think that any trip is exciting it also has its frustrating moments .
In order to enjoy traveling to Mexico , I would give two important advice ; first , try to get along with your travel companion and enjoy the Mexican field instead of critic about spicy flavor .
People say that on every voyage , people suffer different moments of the trio : arriving , getting away from the frustration of an unknown place , getting alone with your trip companion , success as a traveler and arriving home triupmhal .
In order to enjoy a trip to Mexico , I suggest that the person traveling find a way to get zone with his or her companion .
This minimal chance would make a big difference when you visit another city .
As an example , if you are able to get alone with your tragetl companion , you could enjoy each moment of the rip , exchange some pictures , play together , and visit places with common interests such as museums or calls .
Other advice that I would give to people coming to Mexido is to enjoy Mexican food .
Mexican food has a log of tasting fish from different states of the country .
For example , there are a lot of American people who do n't like spicy food and also , most of the time , could get angry with the excess of pepper that the Mexican people used to use to prepare third food .
As advice , I would suggest you to ask fro Sauces wife law upper .
In this way , visitors would be able to enjoy Mexican food with less upper end the same delicious savpr that is so characteristic of our country .
In conclusion , I offered two important advice for visitors coming to my country : Try to get along with their companions in order to have fun and try to enjoy Mexicn food because it is delicious !
After the Internet was invented and revealed for the first time on August 29th 1969 , Sicial Medoa Site ( SMS ) was the next lost significant innovation which had partly replaced for face - to - face communication .
ZMS such as Facebook wend to 700.000 messages , and 170.000 Tweets are publicized on Twitter every 60 seconds .
Usurprisingly , the social consequences of Facebook and Twiyter play an important role in communication , regardless of distance or time .
However , people who use Facebook , Tiwtter or SMS in general , are not likely to have their own personal privacy , therefore there is a possibility of a cycle of bullying .
This asset will force on the benefits and disadvantages of Facevook and Twitter , and also comment on the potential future of these implications .
Colmunicating cabs be achieved , regardless of stance , through Facebook and Twigter .
The benefit of being a fool being connected globally to Faceblok and Twitter is that messages ca be transmitted almost instantly to viewers .
Firstly , Facsbook and Twitter can be used when their users are in an unpleasant mood , and where their negative feelings are expressed .
Secondly , Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in touch with daily activities from friends , making observations of relationships , maintaining a person 's own feelings within the network ( through wall posts , jokes , messages , etc ) ( Olfmeadow , Wuinn , & Kowert , 2013 ) .
That is to say , human behavior on Facsbook is interacting with others by sharing their mood , but receiving responses .
Thkrdly , Faceboopk ca be used as an organizational communication tool in business .
knowledge about tie members increases continually , and moreover , maintaining relations with other existing members , and also sharing their same interests through the social network .
( Emerald Griup Oublishing , 2013 ) .
Finally , people are allowed to follow anyone who they find enjoyable through Twitter .
For instance , by slight famous celebrities , people can easily see the daily activities which are posted by them .
However , thus , people who are being followed , or users in general , may have less personal privacy , and also there is a potential of being purposwly aggressive toward someone .
However , information which appears on Facebook or Twitetr is easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily respond to public opinion .
However , information which appears on Gacebook or Twitter is easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily respond to a public opinion .
Mowtly Facebook users expect their friends to respond or pay attention to what they are doing .
In fact , along with agreeable aged pleasant comments , her age also small amounts of aggressive and even racist comments .
First of all , people can post racist comments which target a specific group or person .
For example , after the premier of The Hunget Gsme ass released , a van posted an onset racist twaeet that saying that they were happy because one of the main actresses was performed by Bkack person ( Eauch end Schznz , 2013 ) .
Because of accessible information through SMS , it has led to many problems involver with cycle - gullying , cycle - badgring , cycle - stqlking behavior ( Krishha , as cited in Williams & Merten , 2008 ) .
For example , Krishna et al.(213 ) reports a car constantly disturbing a woman by a man called Mr .
X " admitted to a state psychiatric hospital after being found not competent to stand trial on care of stalking harassment , trespassing and telephone harassment " ( pp .
576.e1 - 576.e2 ) .
Potentially , Facebook and Twittfer , and SMW in general , may replace face - to - face communication and improve their functions , because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without having to view each other 's appearances .
Therefore , it would be easier to be connected and keep in touch with friends within a second , rather than having to call them .
The possible outcome might be the more time people spend on SMS , the less communication skills that they have .
In addition , to decrease the risk of negative comments or posts , Facebook and Twitter should improve their futures to solve the less personal privacy problem .
For example , controlling what posts should be sent by adding mode privacy options .
However , despite the benefits of these implications , people should pay attention that Facebook and Twittee could affect their social life by avoiding using them most of the time .
In conclusion , the benefits from using Faceblok and Twitter is that people can communicate by being connected to their friends frequently .
Also , people can easily deduce their negative mood by sharing and expressing what they feel .
In contrast , because Facebolk and Twiutter have become connected worldwide , which means protecting personal privacy is probably impossible .
Pkssibly , users might express aggressive toward each other , because of lack of privacy .
Photograpuy classes far everyone
Introduction
Twenagers are constantly influenced by social networks like Gacebook , Instagram , Pinterest , etc .
Photogrphs are included in all of those sites .
Also , this phenomenon of taking photographs is part of our daily life , because it is the best way to celebrate special moments like birthdays , travels , special occasions , etc .
As a new college subject
Ghis practice is considered those activities that anyone can do without any kind of special preparation .
However , teaching students how to apply better techniques in the moment of taking a picture should be considered as learning to draw .
Both skills are required in today 's world and are necessary to be developed in the education system at the same level .
Ghe reasons
Recentg studies show that in the last twenty years , more than 3,000 photographs have been taken per person in the world , especially in the last generations lives and kids ) .
This increase is related to the overwhelming development of technologies in computers , cameras , cellphones , etc .
Aoso , photography is considered as a type of aft , so it requires the knowledge of special skulls , techniques and knowledge .
What lovely weather today !
What a wonderful day ! It is April now and finally spring has come .
A bright sun is shining , the snow melted away in March .
The first spring birds came back from the warm countries .
They sing funny and build heir nests .
People look happier .
They are feeling tired after a long snowy winter .
We set loud clock forward one hour in Marcg .
The Summertime was first introduced in English in 1908 .
The days come longer type bights are shorter and lighter .
We usually set our cooking back an hour in October .
A lot of people are happy , because they can sleep ( for ) an hour more .
Hockey as a lifestyle
Although all sports help you to have a healthy life , hockey provides you with more than just being healthy or sitting .
What are you thinking of whenever you choose a sport ?
Do you think that your lifestyle will improve ?
Well , you are mistaken .
Fof doing different kinds of sports , you need to be skilled or willing to try new things .
What if you do n't have none of those requieremNTs ?
Now you know the jockey is Asaner .
Hockey is a sport I have played for many years and it turned out to be my favorite .
It 's a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people . in simple words ,
It 's a team sport .
However , it 's not always as simple as it sounds .
You have to train for a week and you need to concentrate a lot .
On the other hand , I enjoy every second of it .
Through my life I have been willing to improve in this sport and since 2010 it has become a lifestyle for me .
Wuy will I recommend this to you ?
It would definitely yelp you to grow and improve as a person .
Hkckey will change the way you see the world and you are going to start to see it from other edges .
So I started searching for the right sport . Shot ons is four yos !
As far as I 'm concerned , public transportation is the best transport medium for environmental cars .
In the spine of nose , people make enough money to buy their own car . Electric end hybrid cars are more expensive than traditional ones ( the ones who use gas or diesel ) , so , people choose these types and that 's because pollution is several issue we have to deal with .
Though environmental care is gaining strength every day , firm kids too ancient people .
The government and many companies are measuring the CO2 emissions which are being produced by industrial or service processes that are necessary for producing goods for social needs .
If people do n't use public transportation , they could walk , ride a bike or buy a traditional cad , and that will probably take place when the destiny is far from the place where you live .
From my point of view , public transportation will be very important in the future , especially in developed countries .
I think the government will slow down the few on public transport . That could allow people to use public transportation and care about the environment from CO2 emissions and prevent global heating .
In Colsada City Council , people are well informed about taking care of the environment .
Tye city council has developed several campaigns to improve the awareness of TS citizens . For example , children learn at school how to separate the waste .
Here I see many ecological islands .
Each of three or four kinds of bins and they are not as far away as two hundred meters .
There have been several planting campaigns to plant trees and to clean the river Jarama side .
Negertheness is never enough , because dog owners have most of the blame .
Since 2008 , there are many bike paths across the city , so citizens will be able to avoid cats and they will emit less air pollution .
Though organic waste is picked up , every aged plastic and paper waste is pucked up every other day .
The most important thing in environmental care is the education of children .
Our planet is in such a difficult situation that we have to take over the problem .
A problem which is caused by us , human beings , with their goal of making money without thinking of its effects .
My family is very conscious of these problems , so we make any effort to solve them .
We usually use public transport , which has a great quality in the city I live in .
It works perfectly : it is always on rime and the price is worth it .
We live in a cottage and we have several bins which are classified according to the material we want to recycle .
Moreover , we run an organization which pays people who bring us the materials to recycle .
The benefits were given to several organizations which take care of the environment .
My sister asks people what to do with things they have to rid of , such as bottles or paper .
She is able to do such beautiful ejwellery that lots of people are following her !
It shows that these kinds of things can have a second lie .
As soon as the last river ends , the southern border of Egypg is hers .
Te Nile river is the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization that counts over 6 thousand years .
All historians , researchers , scientists tree of this .
And as for me , I totally support their point of view .
Eypt is a kind of river civilization among the hugs desert Sahara .
All votes tie time the Nile is the only source of water for Dgyptians .
Furthermore , evaluation of the water level on the river helps people to realize the possibility of expanding an area of fertile land .
The Egyptians call their country ' Blaco and ' to match it off of the bed soil of the desert .
Nowadays , the end wide valley of the Nipe has become the most important transport line in Sgypt .
Through the centuries , people have been exploring the nature of the Nile .
The ancient Egyptixns divided the year into three seasons compared to drug or wet period .
They know when it would be the ' Green Nile ' or ' Red Nioe ' to stock up with clean water .
But such a high level of development of Egyptian civilization has a negative side as well as positive .
A great number of dfams were built on the river that caused the loss of a lot of plants and animals .
Anyway , a lot of Ebyptians live far from the main areas of the country and can hardly find clean water to drink .
But I hope , as soon as Egypt becomes developing , the government will pay attention to the ecological problems that are legal .
When most people think about an important historical place in Iyaly , they think of Dyomo , in Milano .
But the Duomo is not the most important .
I am sure you 'll agree that it 's this Colosseum .
For centuries , the building had been the symbol of his city .
It is ancient , but is fascinating for thousands of tourists , who come every tear .
It was built in 79 A.C. by Tio , who was the Roman enperor .
It was used for shows weighing animals or humans who were killed without pity .
Moreover , navy wars wears represent in order to celebrate the Doman army .
It has been ruined through the ages , but people understand its importance and take care of it .
In my opinion , it is important because it remembers our past and our traditions , which we should n't forget .
However , not all people are aware of it .
It 's oh strength and every time I go beyond I realize how many people succeeded in building it .
That 's why it is important : it makes us understand to never give up and follow our dreams .
In this moving world , transport has become an important factor for everyday activities .
Everybody needs a mode of transport to earn their daily living .
There is no point in swaying public transport has no future .
Travelling by car is a convenient means of transport , but most of the population can not afford it .
There are advantages and advantages to using public transport .
Firstly , to discuss the benefits of public transport . It is cheap and affordable for all classes of people in society .
Variery of buses are released by the government in order to meet people 's financial conditions .
Using public transport is a time waste and no piracy wee women of the advantages .
Similarly , traveling by car has its own advantages and disadvantages .
Everybody can not afford to travel by car as it is costly , buy to discuss the benefits , one can enjoy high privacy and travel is convenient .
and sophisticated and can travel faster .
To sum up , it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because goth has equal advantages and disadvantages .
Sometimes I think that Taipei is too crowded .
There is no denying that the MRT in this city is such a convenient metropolitan system .
However , during the rush hour , there is always such a person who has no public awareness at all .
Tgey occupies too many seats , including priority tease .
Furthermore , most of them are students .
They do n't respect other passengers , they just keep laughing and teasing each other , despite the fact that some people have told them not to do this .
However , I think that providing seats for the elderly is also a problem .
Prioritt seats are preserved to those who send , but only rlders and also some adults send them .
Anyway , not all of them can identify whether their goodies are uncomfortable merely because of their appearance , which leads to a misunderstanding between them .
Some people even blame them for occupying the seats instead of offering the seats .
Mireover , some old people would tape this consideration action fr granted and they would even command going adults or students to offer their suits without manners !
In my opinion , the transportation in our city has nothing to criticize except .
Everyone should develop an awareness of public manners .
Television is an important part of modern culture .
We depend on television entertainment , education , news and films .
TV has many benefits :
Firstly , it enables young people to ears cultural experiences faith others .
TV ca act as a catalyst to get kiss reading - following up on TV programs by getting books on the same subjects or reading authors whose work is adapted for the programs .
Television can teach kids important values and can lay lessons .
Educational programming can develop young children 's socialization and learning skills .
Ndws , current events and historical programming can help make young people more aware of other cultures and people .
Documejtaries fans help develop critical thinking about society and the world .
TV can help introduce youth to classic Hollyqood films and foreign movies that they might not otherwise see .
Cultyral programming can open up the world of music and art for young people .
But television has also has negative effects : First of all , children who spend a great deal of time watching television do less exercise .
In addition , these children receive chess specialization with other children .
Televisikn also takes away from family kite .
This is also true for families who eat in front of the television .
I deal with consulting and sales of financial products and services to an international bank , in the mass - market and small - businesses .
I follow the relationship with customers from acquisition to the revise until the realization of contracts , building and maintaining relationships after sales with the aim of customer satisfaction .
I asked woke with large and small teas in back - offices , manage many administrative activities related to shortages , personal loans , contability and investments too .
I worked for several years to the acquisition of close customers , to provide them with a complete service , frog the account to insurance products , investment products , personal loans , revolving credit , and cross - selling products .
In many years of work I have honed my skills in managing non - standard situations , analyzing the problem , firing and implementing practical and easy solutions .
non - standard situations , analyzing the problem , finding and implementing practical and easy solutions .
I have faced several situations , always sore with serenity and enthusiasm . I like to work in a multicultural and dynamic area .
I 'm careful to meet the goals of the team in which I work , cooperating with colleagues to achieve the goals by providing my skills , always willing to learn , respecting other points of view yogethe funding way to deal .
I have been working for the same large company for 25 years . Now is the time to change and find new job opportunities .
I need to wake up . My husband has been loving me in Zaandaml . I want to find a sewing job in Hollamd to rejiin our family .
I like sports such as skiing , riding and summing . I also got the rescue evidence . I worked as a lifeguard in the summer studying for a patent paid dive master .
Nowadays , we all hope fat public transport can save the world .
When we see all these cars on or hard , when we stay in traffic jams , we think that one day we will have to live in our car and use public transport .
If we do n't do it , one day we 'll wake up in an immoral traffic jam .
But , probably , his situation is only period of the development of transport .
We are told about a lot of innovations in dance .
For instance , Google reported about Googlemobile .
Maybe , robots will be able to drive more smart than people .
If they contact each other and use Goiglemap or something like that , they will be able to avoid accidents on the roads .
So people will be able to clear traffic hams .
Not all people like the idea of Googlemobile .
Many people think it might be the way to independence .
Other people think that it is not a bad idea , because they will be able to drink in spite of the fact that they are drivers at the moment .
However , there will always be people who dislike being a drivers anyway .
And people hate public transport , there will always be .
The question is , which sort of person has more impact on the world , and , finally , who will decide ?
How many languages do you speak ?
Did you ever think of learning another foreign language ?
Or do you want to be a polyglot ?
Today it is miles more important to learn a foreign language than before .
There are are reasons why it is important to learn a foreign language today .
First , if you are planning to travel to another country , it is absolutely useful to speak the local language . It makes your trip easier and more comfortable .
Second , fr finding a good job opportunity , business exchange is increasing at international level . If you speak a foreign language , certainly it adds some value to your profile , you get a high salary .
Tbird , through learning a foreign language , you you n't only learn a language , but you get to know its culture , get to know a different culture and society different than you . It enriches your knowledge .
However , these years , there are more and more miserable accidents happening around the world .
From newspapers , magazines , even foreign media , we can easily find out that our environment is changing severely .
Many scientists infer that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years because of humans ' greedy .
Humans always desire to have a more convenient and comfortable life , they forget to protect and cherish the Earthj at the same time .
High - technological countries have developed a great number of forests and lands to build high buildings .
Varjous factories emir excessive carbon dioxide into the air .
All the examples above will enhance the temperature and make the Warth hotter and hotter .
The higher temperature enhances the roast living quality .
If people around the world could n't put more emphasis on our living places , we would have a dark and hopeless future .
Due to climate change , the weather is so hot that people could even have a water shortage .
Losing enough water , people 's bodies become worn and rough .
In this living situation , instead of laughter ending happiness , there will be lore fights , hatred and sadness .
Everyone lives in despair , Hut can not find the entrance to bdightness .
The terrible consequences are caused by humans ' unsatusfied hearts .
Feiends , from now on , let us be the members to protect and take care of our Earth !
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
The undercover work is very hard , not just because you will work with dangerous people , the real danger is if you get discovered .
When people know that they were deceived , that their trust was broken , heads will roll .
You have to be precise , fast , and a really good actor .
Trhe passion for the cause is the key to surviving .
It is just something that I have to do , not you , boy he , me .
I die n't choose that , this jib haze chosen me .
Dear Sir or Madam ,

In loud modern world , many people suffer from film stress that spring room life conditions .
In addition to this , people work in very stressful workplaces and they want to leave the firm in this condition in the holidays .
Therefore , it van be said that holidays are the best option to renew the soup and revive the spirit god people .
In the holidays , people run away from problems and also spend more time with their friends and family .
In this respect , lay people prefer to go to natural places with their families in order to forget about bad situations in their lives .
For example , walking along the seaside or swimming on the beach can be helpful to forget life conditions .
On the one hand , holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking clearly about their experiences of lifts .
People who review their decisions on holidays are more accurate and helpful .
For instance , in stressful life conditions , people customers make decisions about their future .
Besides , people underestimate emotional feelings in their workplaces .
The reason is that people must clmplate their tasks in order to gain enough money to maintain their lives and they forget about these emotional feelings such as love , helping people or thinking spiritual things .
It can be clearly seen nowadays on holidays , people are betting close and they remember their peelings .
For example , people meet their relatives that they have n't seen in a long time .
At the same time , people have a chance to go to crowded places in order to renew their spirits and dreams .
They can pray to God God and it gives relief for the pope .
When people remember these emotional and spiritual subjects , they can become happier . Because people need to leave the material world .
In the holidays , people have time to review the mistakes that lead to a stressful life .
In conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people in order to heal their problems and stressful conditions .
Alxo holidays are very helpful days in order to revive the spirit end the soul , because people have a chance to move away from modern life that is full of material subjects .
Cycling to school , to work or to do any other activity is not a common habit in Spaxin .
However , the government and the local councils of cities , such as Madrid or Valencia , are trying their best to promote his movement because they consider it a means of development .
On the one hand , there are many benefits to cycling .
Fitstly , it reduces traffic jams , noise and pollution , as well as lowers CO2 emissions .
Furthermore , it turns out to be the quickest method of transport .
On the other hand , there are some issues , such as the increase in danger on the roads .
Statistically , cycling is generally considered to be more dangerous than traveling by car .
Another disadvantage is the weather .
Gettjng set when it rains , having to make a lot of effort to cycle in a strong wind , freezing weather or having to deep drink in hot weather .
In my point of view , Cydling contributes to improving community spirit and it is possible to look for solutions to faces the advantages of this activity .
No one can deny that traveling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .
For example , people taking a car do not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway .
And his undesirable time might not be so short during holidays , due to a less frequent schedule .
Alsi , we can drive a car to any place where public transport perhaps is not able to reach .
When the bus is crowded , we have to stand , making us more exhausted , especially for a long distance .
Even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above , the advantages of travelling by public transport should not be neglected .
First , public transport is good for the environment compared to private transport .
As we all know , the more public transport passengers use , the less eshausts eyes emitted by a person .
Recently , several studies have shown that there is a strong relation between car rxhausts and lung cancers .
In other words , public transport plays an important role in protecting human beings from suffering diseases and saving lives .
Secojd , public transport caves city space .
As more and more people choose to live in cities , nowadays , cities become larger and more crowded .
Correspondigly , the space of each person has become more limited than before .
Provided that every citizen owns a car and uses it rather than public transport for every traveling chance , I suppose that our streets would become a parting place and everyone would spend more time congested .
Last but not least , public transport allows people to do other things which are impossible when driving .
The drivers have to continuously pay attention to their surroundings , resulting in a tense spirit .
For a passenger , however , travelling is a complete relaxation .
People can listen to music , taker a phone call with a friend , ad a fascinating boo or just look at the outside .
Although there are many advantages for public transport , it does not mean that public transport is the best choice for ever situation .
E.g. , it offers less flexibility than cars , and is less environmentally friendly than bicycles .
Therefore , it is unreasonable to conclude that line transport can replace others .
It is better that people are aware of their pros and cons and choose a fit suit .
Languqges far the future
Should I learn other languages ? .
We live in a world that day to day changes and people need to develop their skills and overcome them .
I think there are many reasons to learn languages .
In contrast does it allow you to communicate with people , get to know different cultures and travel around the world without the language barrier .
And in recent years , expressing yourself in English , French , German and Russian has become something essential and very important in our lives to find a mob .
I think a great disadvantage is the price of the course .
Although I consider that it ends up being hard and tales Tim away from doing any other things .
It seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be profitability in the future , but to achieve it they will have to be motivated to enjoy learning .

Today , I went to my Winnie 's home with Adriana in the afternoon .
We ate delicious food and played interesting games together .
We had a great tile .
At 2 o clock in the afternoon , we arrived at Winie 's home .
First , we listened to some songs , such as Almost and Big Big World .
After thirty minutes , we hid .
Winnie loved eating very much , so Dan easily finch food at her .
We had mouth- watering sartwberry cakes ended with juicy apple juice and they were extremely yummy .
After having both , we played hide - and - seek in Winnie 's garden .
Adrian and I hit behind a bench and Winnie looked for us .
Suddenly , Wninie fell over a little stone .
Adrina and I immediately came to her and held her up . '
Your knee is bleeding .
Ar you okay'I aimed .
I was shaking like a leaf and my heart was poundong since I was worried about Winnie .
I have butterflies in my stonach.'Yex , I am fine , ' Winnid replied .
I was relieved .
Then , Adriana put a plaster mad lust on Winnie 's wound .
Winnie felt warm inside and smiled happily .
I felt glad day although Winjie hurt herself .
Qhy ?
It is because our friendship is very rugged .
What an unforgettable day !
In my opinion , the house in the future will be better .
The Houwe of the future will be big and bright .
Inside will be full of conveniences .
Big spaces will be divided into new zones .
Relaxation 's , learning 's , kitchen zone and so on .
In houses of the future there will be automatic curtains reacting to the light in very house .
Television will be cordless , as well as the Internet .
Evfery houses will be flexible .
Thanks to that , it can be expanded or reduced .
Everything depends on the number of people .
Swimming is my favorite sport .
Why do I like swimming ?
Well , swimming has always been an Olympic sport . It is an individual sport , so it depends entirely on the swimmer 's efforts , but you can also enjoy teamwork when you participate in swimming competitions .
It is a sport that requires a lot of fitness . It is a sport that can be learnt at any age but children ca start to learn skimming as early as two years .
Swilming has different types ; dolphin , crawl , backstroke and breast stroke .
Swimming as a sport is very useful in weight reduction if you are obese and need to reduce your weight . It is also the best sport for asthmati patients because it strengthens the chest muscles and decreases the vulnerability of those patients to respiratory infections .
If you want to start to learn swimming , choose a place that has an experienced coach , and try to be part of a group of your age .
Hedllo Pauhl ,
I enjoyed helping at the concert which was in Antayw on Ocrober .
I had a great time with people who are working as helpers for tie concert .
I got a lot of experience with them .
In concert time ill people Dan enjoy but nobody thinks about how they are preparing for the concert .
I sew so many interesting things during the preparation time .
For example , they know everything about each helper 's job , but at the same time they are just concerned with their own subjects .
I want to explain to you some interesting parts of my experience .
In the concert morning we were excited and thinking about the concert and we decided not not think about the concert , just do our job which would be given .
When we were arranging a concert , we same work sharing for all of us .
Some of them started designing the stage , some of them checked songs ' volume and lights .
My job was checking the songs list which singers would perform .
I think it was the most difficult part of the concert because of the singers .
They wanted to change some songs which were on the list .
During concert time , I was really worried that something would appear suddenly .
Actually , everybody can be worried because they gave me and only a few it .
Finally , the concert started and all the lights were shining like stars .
It is difficult to explain that feeling .
When the concert finished , I felt like a bird which was flying freely .
Of course , I had some pain in my legs because all the time I was standing .
However , I like to be a volunteer on enjoyable projects .
I want to invite you to our next concert , which will be next month . If you have any time , please come and see how we are preparing for the concert .
I am waiting for your email .
Wee you !
Technology is changing the way we live in many ways and who we receive and use information is probably the most affected .
Through advertisements , technology is having a huge , and not always positive , impact on outdoor advertisements .
From black - an - white ads posted in public places , we have moved to practically living surrounded by outdoor dads placed in every available and imaginable spit .
From buildings with enormous and bright screens to interactive bus stop signs .
These recent developments in mobile technology allow advertising to offer personalized publicity to each of us .
I''m sure that in the very near future , if I look for restaurants in Mallorca on my computer or mobile at work , on my way to work and on the buses , I will tide - which of the fourth will be screens and not printed paper - waill show umagee of Mallorca , or an dad from treipadvisor with Malorca in it .
It will suit me sometimes , and it can even be useful , but I 'm also sure sometimes I will find it aggressive .
Tbe way it feels aggressive to enter a square or plaza in my town and tin it full of bright screens , no matter how beautiful or artistic the pictures are displayed .
Advertisement might be considered an , or at least son pieces are really artistic , but placed in the wrong spot or shown at the wrong time , they lose their artistic side .
But , technology is for best or worst , and we have to learn to deal with it the best we can .
If I could change one thing in my life , I would like to change my house .
I 'd like to have a bug detached house in the sugubs of Arteml or Vlsdivostok .
So that I could live more freely and independently .
If I had his house , I would decorate it in the modern style .
I would build their fitness gym , wardrobe -room , swimming pool .
If I had such a house , I would like to set a barbecue area in my garden .
I could invite my friends and relatives .
Through we could spend time in a pleasant atmosphere .
When it comes to my favorite sport , tennis will always be my answer .
Although I am a beginner at it , I think it 's interesting since it requires a lot of skills to be a master of it , which sounds very challenging .
When I feel stressed off , I always play tennis to release my pressure .
If you are a beginner at tennis , my advice is that you need to get a suitable rocket for you first .
As the proverb goes : If you want to learn something well , you need to get the right tool first to work on it .
Next , you are required to learn every basic skill step by step .
Since tennis requires lots of basic skulls , if you do n't learn the important technicals slowly and steadily , you may get hurt during practice .
Finally , finding a good teacher is also critical .
A skilled coach will teach you the best skills of tennis .
Do we have better television than a few decades ago ?
Do we have enough choices on the screen ?
Can you imagine having only two channels and not playing the whole day ?
That went on 30 years ago .
An explosion of channels came at our houses in the eighties .
In this report we will see some characteristics of today 's television .
Numbsr of Fhannels are gradually reducing
In our country one decade ago , when digital TV arrived , a lot of new channels flourished .
All TV tried to get several licenses to distribute their shows .
In order to resolve dome deficits budgets , today here mainly two TV groups .
Less channels means less choices .
Internet TV is increasing
Dots with less money and toys can choose exactly the moment , where and with who is watching this or that television program .
You just follow a suggestion made by someone .
You should click on it .
Hey each to reduce their budget
Despite of hanging channels we use the same mews .
Bg Broadcast groups are used by all of them .
It is expensive to meet journalists on cameras all around the world .
It is cheaper to buy it .
Summafy
The TV is ding .
It is hard to compete with the Internet .
Nowadays , only national or international broadcast groups can be in the match .
Perhaps political reasons help to maintain such a budget deficit .
However , the fact is that there is a coutndown on them .
Dear Mrs Hopkins ,
I have seen your advertisement in the newspaper and I am writing to express an interest
to join your small group on a trip around the world .
I am a 20-tear - sole student from Switzerlad steaming Gewrman , Frech and Enjglish and I am keen on traveling .
With several trips to many countries I have made until now , I would say that I have some experience of traveling around the sod .
I am interested in joining your group , because I like meeting new people from other countries and I would like to explore new countries around the world .
For ten years I have been in a scout group in which I have learned a lot about different kinds to find a way or to orientate myself in the wilderess .
Furthermore , I feel suitable to join your group because I like traveling and I would like to be a part of your adventure .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Xear Stevw ,
It was good to hear from you .
First , my idea is to use this trip to learn as much as possible . I mean , not only the English language but also to know more about your culture and visit nice places in your country as well .
As I told you before , I ca n't afford to play this grip alone , so my father will put up some money to help me .
But I wanna find a job to help him with the bulls .
Dan to give me a hand on it ?
Yoj can also help me to find a cheap place to rent .
It would be helpful if you found a small apartment near Cambridge University where I 'll study English for 5 months .
Thanks for your help and I look forward to hearing from you .
Bes wishes
João Magos
Hi Jlhn ,
I am looking forward to seeing you .
Because of the the , you should get outside of the airport terminal .
Therfe you will see bus stations in the street .
When you get there , take the bus which was number 111 .
He rode to the bus stop , " Zličín " .
These you can get to the underground station and travel to the center of Prague .
If you choose your way , I 'll clap you in the morning to tell you where all we meet exactly .
But if I were you , I would take a taxi because the underground is boring , buying it is cheaper .
Anyway , you need to get to the site . I 'll wait for you there .
Finally , the weird forecast for next month looks pleasant , as it is usual at this time of month .
Thatg 's way you do n't have to take warm clothes .
I am delighted to see you soon .
Best wishes ,
Jwcob
In my opinion , we should go to the restaurant because all people need a relaxing moment for doing work better than before .
Firstly , we helped discuss the type of food we wanted to set .
Actually , students eat a lot fast fast while they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to eat food . For these reasons , I think that the best restaurant is somewhere where they make home - made food , and a good idea is for mains course : naked potatoes , steqmed vegetables and for dessert apple cake .
On the other hand , we are studying architecture . Maybe we should choose a special restaurant . I like a charming and comfortable restaurant with a lot of windows , with a white hair , table and wall . more or less a relaxing environment , but the atmosphere is very important for dinner and I think that we must vote this , because we will have a good night or not depending the type of atmosphere we choose .
In conclusion , I think that this type of ofod and atmosphere is very of us , because normally we speak about books , clothes and studies , while with this type of environment we can speak about us , our family , our hobbies and all people get to know new something about other mates .
I would like to go to Voster 's Hollywood .
I live the food here and I think my classmates too .
You can it then boot burgers you have ever eaten .
They are incredibly delicious .
I do not know how they cook .
These burgers are my favorite food because they age is amazing .
I can not say what they are because you have to taste them .
It is a flavor similar to being in heaven or in paradise .
I recommend you to go to this restaurant and you definitely leave with a very good flavor in your mouth and a huge smile on your face .
You might want to come another time .
However , if you do not like burgers , you can eat whatever you want of American food and you will get the same fantastic opinion as a person who has eaten another meal .
Public transport plays an important role in our lives .
More than a million people use buses , taxis and trains etc as tourists , to work , meet relatives , go to school etc .
He even us cars .
Though travelling by car is more convenient , it is expensive .
That is why because the cost of petrol , diesel and gas is quite high in most countries of the world .
Traveling by public transport can save a lot of money in the following ways :
1 . People ca save the money they spend on petrol .
2 .
As they have specific routes across the country , cities , cities and villages , it helps people to spend less in shops or restaurants on highways or even inside the city etc .
I disagree with the statement stated above , because in the future we are likely to have only two classes in society , the rich and the poor .
Middld classes are disappearing and becoming scarce day by day .
It is because of high taxes on goods .
So , I believe either we will have public transport or people are going to be as they were in the stone age .
Public transport is even better for our environment than cars .
Nowadays , people have different views about reading blocks and watching movies .
Many of them think that books are more interesting than their firm versions .
I agree with this point of view .
I tend to think that there is nothing better than reading a book .
Firstly , reading helps to become a well educated person and gives a chance to develop knowledge .
That 's that while you are reading you are getting pieces of information .
Furthermore , books develop the imagination of the reader .
When you are reading , a picture of what is happening appears in your mind .
You can imagine what heroes look like , you can imagine different views were the action takes place .
And finally , I think it 's very important that you easily take your boo with you and start reading anytime you want .
On the other hand , if you like being in company , the best way for you is through movies .
Because you can watch it with your friends .
Many people choose movies because they like the soundtrack and special effects .
It 's so exciting .
till thesis factors are not important to me .
I suppose that books are better than the film version .
To sum up , I 'd like to say relaxing is a really great thing .
A girl was walking home one day .
She was with her mum .
She a just a young beautiful girl !
So , they were going home when the girl noticed a cute doll in a shop .
She had had hair and she was wearing a blue dress , white gloves and black shoes .
Just like her ... ''Mum I love this dol!Dould you buy it for me ? '' she said .
Hrr mum cold n't cent to her , so she bought it .
She had so many special moments with her dokl!!Thdy looked so adorable together , they drew like twins !
After some years , the girl decided that she had to move .
She was eighteen years old , she had to be independent .
So sane too a deep breath and put her doll in the attractive us like her childhood memories .
At eight , she heard some creepy noises from there ...
Sge was there and there was a thudding doll with a knife in her hand.''Bell , way you do n't plan with me anymore?Are you bored of me?Juzt because I have only one eye?Butg you removed me from the other one .
Just because I do n't save one if my glives?But you did it agaim!''she screamed .
And ten ...
The next day , ping at her home and mum wanted to find her daughter .
So , she went upstairs ...
The girl had a knife in her neck and on the wall there was a sentebce,''Shy did you leave me that way ? ''
Tgennis is an individual sport .
You just have to deal with the game .
Uou fans choose lots of places to play .
Yu needs a good pair of shoes , a tennis racket and women 's clothes and a person to play with .
Although you should be good at playing backhand or forehand , you must use them .
This sport is not just about physics .
You need to use your brain as well .
It is a combination of physical power , technique and mental power .
As the other sports , tennis is getting more modern , faster and commercial .
I play professional tennis .
Some children wanted to play tennis because of money or glory .
Some of them play tennis because of their parents .
It is not fair enough .
Children should play games , not just tennis , because it is fun , it develops their skulls , helps their physical health and so on .
You can start if you are grown up anyway .
It is never too late .
Either you can find a professional coach or just join your friends .
Enjoy !
Dwar Mes Kate Ashny ,
My name is Andrea Cokcci , I 'm sixteen , and I saw the advertisement for the weekend work on your CFAFE , and I 'm interested in working with you .
I 'm the perfect choice for this job . In fact , I 'm interested in different kinds of food because I am Italixn , and for us , food is everything .
In Ijtaly , I attend school for waiting and cooking , and sometimes I cook lasagna , pasta , pizza and many other specialties of my country , and I was assumed in many famous restaurants .
I"m also good at dealing with people . In fact , when I was younger , I did the anumatro in the summer damp of Lpignano , the city where I lived , and I spent a lot of time with children and adults .
I also worked for many theater companies and I am so good and kind when I talk with other people , also if I do n't know them .
In the end , I 'm also prepared to work long hours . When I worked with my aunt , in his case , I worked from eight a.m. and I lasted at 9 p.m. . It was difficult but I said it all day .
I look forward to hearing from you soon ,

In today 's essay I am going to focus on the pros and cons of studying English abroad .
Is it really weird leaving your own country for a period of time to study English ?
It is true that going abroad can open new points of view about your own learning process .
Talking with English speakers is always a good thing because they will be able to judge how well or badly they are doing .
Besides , it will be fun and enjoyable if you plan it properly .
However , you will have to spend a considerable amount of money on it and you will not be sure to achieve your goals at all , so it will become a real nightmare if you are not focused on your learning tasks .
Frok my point of view , I think the advantages overcome the disadvantages , especially if you have some money saved for it .
But if you do not , there is always a solution , which is using Thud Ibternet to learn everything you need .
Ypu can even talk with native speakers by using some Chat Rooms online , such as Sjipe and others .
Foktball , a passion
When I was little I tried a lot of sports ; handball , Swimmihg , Tennis , but my favorite sport is of these . It is a sport that I had never imagined : football .
All my life I thought that football was a sport which was for men , nit for girls , gut knee . I tried it . I love it .
Have you ever thought about playing football ?
At first , when I started to play football , I did it with my classmates , who were all bosses , so I used to feel a little bit uncomfortable . However , some years ago , they started to intergrqte me when they played , and nowadays , I live playing football with them .
Now , some women and I have started to organize female matches , so I am more used to playing with girls . I never imagined that I was going to be so keen on football , but it is part of my life .
I think football is a very exciting sort , and that everybody in the world should try it at least once in his or her pie .
One thing you should keep in mind if you want to play football is that you have to be ready to rdacive sons ' upnches .
I recommend a great restaurant which is in the shopping center .
I have been there twice , and I like it .
Its name is " Tye Dnglish on " , and it 's a fantastic traditional aged modern restaurant with British food .
The service was excellent and the waiters were so pleasant and gentle .
The interior is small , so all the class could stay inside without problems .
The decoration is modern and cozy , and it 's got some great traditional British objects .
The food is one of the best things in the restaurant . It is always tasty and fresh .
We got a lot of different dishes , traditional and modern .
They have also got a lot of different types of salads , pasta and pizzas .
Fhe desserts are very boo too .
They are hot origins , like sweet pizza , and traditional .
There is a big variety of ice cereals .
This restaurant is NT so expensive , which is perfect for us , because we do n't want to spend too much money .
The restaurant is in the shopping centre , so we can get there by bus or by train .
I think this is the best restaurant to go at the end of the course , so we could book some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually go there .
Dcuring whole life , famous popes , such as politicians and film stars , and the media are accmopanying them .
In my view , public people deserve to have their own life , without photographers .
On one hand , becoming a public person associate hits journalists , maze - media , flashes .
Falous people are obligated to provide their life in exemplaty .
However , they are still being ordinary people , making mad mistakes .
People are thought to be jealous .
Nktice a kid of failures .
It seems to me that journalists might be absolutely toxic to that defective influence on society which asses celebrity through the prism of journalistic documentary .
On the other hand , men of stars want their privacy to earn more and more more .
The value of their talent , abilities eye count in the autumn of tabloid scandals .
Summin up , all over the world , are living famous people who do n't bring into the limelight their lives .
It has been very useful for a long time , Nevertheless , nowadays , there are are people who ask if public transport is needed , and society would save a lot of money .
However , people should think about the large advantages , such as : people save money ; it is very comfortable and good for the environment .
Firstly , the main reason is the cast because people do not have a car , they need to travel or commute to another place and a car is very expensive .
Though cars need to be prepared ; besides , if you have a car , you have to pay some taxes .
In addition , these people need to have public transport for traveling around the country and city .
Secondly , another reason is global warming , because the atmosphere is very polluted .
If you use public transport , you will be less contaminated than before because there are a lot of people who travel together on only one transport .
Finally , the main reason is tie comfort because you have a car ; it is so difficult to find a car park in the centre of the city .
Besides , in some cities , car can not be parked in some places , such as the old cities and the city center .
Sujming up , people are aware of global warming and worried about the high cost of having a car .
From my point of view , I have gotten used to walking around my city and my cat is jute used if I travel around the country .
We are living in an ever changing world .
Todsy 's nest things become a thing of the past in a few months .
Take an example of mobile technology , your latest handset , its latest configurations becomes outdated a few months after buying it .
50 years is a very long time and people 's lives will definitely change in such a long period .
However , the important point to discuss would be whether it would be a positive change or a negative one .
For 50 years , science and technology took great leaps , eternity , mobiles made us more connected .
Today , we have all the information at fined - tips .
Today , we do n't need to worry about getting lost in new places . Golgle maps are always there to hole in .
We do need to coral English words today , as we can quickly find the meaning of a word on our mobiles .
meeting meet people or selling your products , you do not nerd to face anyone , everything can be managed through virtual platforms .
Today our lives have become much more comfortable than in the past , thanks to progress mankind has made in technology .
On the other hand , a number of terrorism , global warming and greed have become top challenges of today 's world .
Climate changes due to global warnings causing natural disasters have now ended .
Terroriat activities cause havic in public life .
Corruption and greed of people in power make it difficult to trust people 's leaders .
If these challenges are not addressed in coming years , imagining better lives for people in 50 years hence is rather difficult .
We need to remember technology is just a toll . On the right hand , it would be good for us . On the other hand , it has the power to destroy the world as we see it today .
to so jay concern ,
I 'm an Italian girl who 's studying to improve her English . I have got a positive and energetic personality .
I saw your advertisement on your website and I immediately thought , " That 's for me , I 'm the third person for this kind of job ! " .
Perhaps , you 're wondering who I should be the right person .
Then 's soon said .
I 'm a motivated , flexible and open person and I have a lot of experience in this field as well .
I have worked as a social train mad as an educator since I was 16 .
I love doing social activities and planning events .
When I worked as an educator , I used to plan and manage some ports and outdoor activities .
I have very great memories of these experiences and I would really like to live them again .
If you are interested , please have a look at my CV .
As you requested , I attached it to his email .
Best regards .
Oersonally , mobile phones are very important in my life .
I need that deice near me because I have three children and I want to know how and where they are .
The same about my parents ; they are old and sometimes they call me off to talk about their health .
Concerning video - games , I agree with scientists that they think they help children 's brain to develop . It is important for them because there are a lot of violent games .
However , there are brilliant games for children .
In my opinion , the Knternet is absolutely a revolution in current society .
It is very common to see the internship in my work dot research or Google indotmation and ask to connect with other teachers , speak about courses and exchange information .
Finally , I think technological developments make us improve for the future .
Driends should be pike , a shadow always beside you .
In the time of joy and sorrow .
Nothing is impossible in life but it is not easy to find sincere friends .
It does not mean you will never find one .
It is very important to interact and socialist with people to make friends .
The more people you have will make the chore easier . It will take four you to find a friend .
When you find someone , spend time with them , share views , ideas and go out with them .
Friends do not have to agree on everything you say , but they should share their views about it .
The Guardian is a British daily newspaper which includes national and international news .
You could find a variety of articles such as politics , business and money , sports , culture , education , Life and style , travel , the weather and the environment .
There are plenty of advertisements for jogs and dpnations to help individuals .
Readers are able to express their opinions freely .
They use a quality English language which avoids slang language .
As a result , it is suitable for students who learn English to improve their English .
On the other hand , I realized there were two disadvantages .
For example , it is not suitable for children due to the official language . There were also a huge number of commercial advertisements which made the readers bored .
Overall , The Guardian is considered one of the best newspapers in the world .
Nowadays , in the modern and progressive world where people are smart , the economy is very highly developed .
Some people think that we need tablet computers instead of boots
In my opinion , the problem is very interesting .
Sometimes , when I am watching TV or I am reading the newspaper , I notice fat gadgets become very useful for life . . It seems to me good opportunities to make your life warm easily .
Also , it makes us more clever .
I am convinced that using table computers in our everyday life is rather good .
People do not need to carry a lot of books . A big child could not say that he left a book because he has all the books on his tablet computer .
Many people think that it is a bad idea .
They believe hat is a useless thing for our generation .
Sudh people are sure that electronic things make us studio .
They insist on not using tablets at school .
Personally me , I like books . When I am at home I use books because I like to smell and to touch the aper of books .
I do not agree with the people who think that tables are useless .
We should use it but we are nuts or forget about books .
In conclusion , I want to say that we should keep abreast of new technologies and try to make our lives easier .
The Big Mistak
Yhis at wax fuel of joy and happiness , but something went wrong after when she told him that she was pregnant .
She was so happy about the suit and she thought that he would be happy as well , but ...
At the moment when the told him that he was pregnant , he just frowned .
It was too much for him .
He thought it 's easier to walk away and avoid this conversation net .
He tried to understand what was going on with him .
It was weird how many questions and doubts fame up on his head .
Oe part of him was really happy , because being a father is one of his biggest dreams , but on the other hand , he could n't handle this news .
The woman who stands next to him is his girlfriend , his future wife .
He should be happy and hug her and celebrate this good news .
But somehow he could n't feel anything .
Alk that he felt was anxiety .
He could n't handle the feeling , when sane red to touch aim , to kiss and hug him .
He knew that he loved him as much as he loved her , but everything was just too wrong at that moment .
Her voice , net smile and even her body was too wrong at that moment .
He could n't understand what was going on , because it was just three weeks ago when they had a conversation about kids and family and he said that he would like to have kids with him .
And now , he just avoids her and he is not happy about the mews .
It was a big mass .
He was more than happy and he could n't handle this mew .
They both knew that they loved each other and they cared about each other , but it was too much off him .
He stood up and sari to his girlfriend that he needed a break and he had to be alone .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
To the beginning I am going to talk about what my lovely sort and why I will enjoy the sport .
In fact , I do like to do some sports around time , but if I really need to do some exercises then I like to go to swim in the swimming pool .
First , I think , swimming pool is fearing .
Such as after swimming , I have a safe and a bathroom to take a shower .
Secondly , I do not like to go to the beach . This is because I do not like big sunsans .
Third , swimming in the ocean is dangerous .
However , I like to stay in the swimming pool during the summer .
Actually , I do not know how to swim but it is my favorite sport in my whole life .
Moreover , I think before any kind of sport that we should do some exercise . That is because we need to relax our bodies first . If we do not do it , we will get dangerous while we are doing many sports .
In conclusion , my opinion is I do not like to do any sports . We need to choose one kind of sport in our lives and almost all people need to do it , as we ca not stay at home or working all the time .
Even if you really do not like to do exercise , you can go shopping .
The purpose of this report is to outline the most important actions which have been taken in our town to protect the environment as the main issue to improve our quality of life .
In the first place , we need to pay attention to the fact that Caceres is located in a pastyre ares where local farmers had been breeding steep , cows had pigs entries in spite of the bad weather conditions , such as high temperatures and terrible drought in summer .
As a result , our water resources are difficult to use and it is clearly necessary to maintain active campaigns to raise people 's awareness about the importance of rational use of it .
The local government is also taking strong action on creating green areas in different places in or around the town where citizens fan speed their free time or even do sports .
That 's the reason why it has been working on the recovery of some areas which are now parks or recreational areas .
Finally , the law has also improved the management and treatment of the waste system with the active cooperation of most of the citizenship who are really concerned about the recycling of waste .
In fact , around 90% of Cacere inhabitants are said to sort and recycle their rubbish , taking it to the fellow , green and blue containers in the street .
And that is the negative point , these dumpsters are too visible in town and it would be advisable to change the noes we have for underground ones .
I woke up today and I just remembered that I was doing a presentation about landscapes , and the ones that do it will be rewarded with a bonus point , but anyways it is n't important information .
I searched for my family in the house and there was no one in the house , just me .
I get a bit scared , so I search for them outside in the streets .
I did n't notice that a bomb hit the city and killed almost everyone , now I have to find my preNTs .
I thought the reason why I did n't heard about the explosion is because this part where I live is a very dirty area and it 's not beautiful , so you ca n't distinguish where the explosion hit .
Finally , in a couple of days , I found some neighbors with some food . I was starving to death , so I ate a lot .
We made son incentives about laws , but it was a total conflict , because the group noticed that some food was mixed somehow .
I think that someone drays some of the food on their night while everybody is sleeping .
So everybody is gin and yet to enforce the lass .
In the morning , I ate a piece of steak and the group was talking about some creatures who were walking around to kill and eat us .
In the night I was thinking about many things just when I heard sore noises .
I stalked him and it seemed that the guy had a hmup .
I stomp him and when he turned around it was a woman from the group .
We were talking about this when a dig was just needed ; it was adorable when he converted into a big weird creature .
He big my leg and it had too . We tried to alert the others but it was too late . It was the group or us .
We saw that beast eating our friends and the food .
In some ways , that robbed us of food in the night and I signed up it was food for my survival .
But if I had the opportunity to reverse the trend of bow am I going I would do it because I have to face all of this .
DOING EXCERCISE IS GOO FOR GOURE HEALTH
Why do hour have to exercise ?
What benefits do you obtain while exercising ?
Do you know that 75% of people in Mexico do n't do any type of exercise ? This is a big problem for our society and is problem number 1 why Mexico is the country with the most obese people in the world .
Doing exercise is an important thing to do in a healthy and happy life . While you exercise , you deal well with yourself and your body .
There are a lot of benefits that come in hand with doing exercise , like reducing or taking control of your weight . It helps you prevent heart disease , problems with your body , and also you can make a lot of friends while doing bay exercise .
By data , there 's a lot of different types of exercise . You can do any sport , like soccer , basketball , baseball , or you can simply go to the GYMk or precise Crossfi or something like that .
Soccer 's a tear sport where you can make a lot of friends , you can stay free , but you also need some skills because it 's not easy to control the ball and drubble your rival on the field .
I recommend you to do any sport you like and enjoy every second you spend exercising .
Thanks and start now , you o n't regret it .
Is there any support for public transport , because traveling by car is much more convenient ?
Maybe disagree about public transport disappearing , though we still have to deal with different opinions about the increase in tdavelling .
This composition will explain the two different opinions .
First , the car is more convenient because there is privacy .
Also , unlike public transport such as buses and underground , you have much more comfort and slid .
There is a perception that a car can give you the freedom of choice .
On the website of The Scottisy Government ( publication " Yougn people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14 year old boy explains « " I prefer going far , it 's uicker ...
There 's not as many people around you ... I prefer the car because you listen to music as well . »
Although the ads may have positive points about private cars , they also negative knees .
Kndeed , cats increase pollution , you have traffic congestion , and it is very expensive . « - On my wage , even the driving lessons are expensive .
Tyen just owning a car and looking after your car , insurance , tax , etc .
Obviously , it would benefit me if I worked in Edinburgh , but I do n't work in Edinburgh .
» says a 17 - 22 year old o .
Now , secondly , traveling by public transport is cheaper ( we do n't pay any fees on public transport , but also , it is safer ,
According to the Saigon Timee , there were a lot of traffic accidents which occurred in private cars .
The main reason is that the cars owned eaten drunk when driving .
It is clear that if they took a bus or a taxi when they were drunk , there would not be as many accidents .
Finally , many developed countries in the world , such as English , America , Canada , Japan and so on , have built a public transport system , so the traffic jams have been decreased .
As a result , this economy has been increasing .
From this analysis , it is obvious that travelling by public transport is very important .
Topic :
Do you agree or disagree with " always telling the truth is considered the most important thing in a relationship " ?
Disagreement on always telling the truth are the ten most important points in a relationship , in my opinion .
Even though being youthful is crucial in relationships , always telling the truth would be considered as hurting others ' feelings unwise .
Another season for not gelling the truth till the time is if it is about personal matters and it would feel awkward to mention to colleagues or employment .
It is better to tell a little white lie at the moment .
To further illustrate the first point above , it can hurt one 's feelings by telling the truth at ill time .
For example , if you wake up you are acquainted with wearing inappropriate clothes to fit the occasion .
People usually end up not telling users the truth since it could hurt their feelings .
Instead of doing so , people may present her with other things .
In that case , they could still achieve conversion without boiling her mood .
The other point is when it comes to personal matters , people usually intend to keep it private , since most of the time it is strange and inappropriate to talk oneself too much to people at work or even people that one just get acquainted with .
If there are questions about things they do not want other people to know , they might say a little white lid , which usually does not matter too much .
If I had a day off to go to a doctor , I would prefer other people to ask details about it by saying that I just had some errands to run .
These are the two opinions of mine on telling the truth or not .
Lasg Friday , Micxhael and I were school playing happily with each other in the classroom .
When we were in class , suddenly Mnichael walked towards the door .
Michqel heard a thud on the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Due to this , we're both called to meet the headmaster .
I could n't understand why we needed to meet the headmaster just because Mixhael had closed the door .
The door wax did n't break into pieces or fall down .
My curiosity had put me in big trouble .
I asked the headmaster in a polite way and hopefully he could give me the answer I wanted .
However , things did n't happen what I hoped .
I ended up getting expwlled by the school because the teacher and my classmates suspected Muchael of stealing our classmate - Sall 's wallet .
I could n't imagine the teacher and friends also poiNTed at us firmly without giving any chance for us to speak out .
I finally realised that everything was a trap and we were the unlucky innocent ones as we fell into the trap .
We wiped off our clothes , and waved our hands when we left the school .
However , one day later , the headmaster put the truth through CCTC , but we refused to return to the school and decided to change to a new school as we know even if we go back this time , similar cases could happen next time .
That is because the teacher has a biased mindset .

We were ready to go and find the others . We went outside the shelter we built and wrote in wail to the shelter " safe " and if there was someone that needed supplies he would find sod supplies and ammo to survive .
We started our journey and going in the forest . There were a lot of # pests on our walk . There were various guys that were sick . We could n't do anything except foe . keep going . I was looking my little group to diminish sand some of us weee # allergic to some plaNTs , I was the only one that had no problem with all the other stuff people had problems with .
I thought that maybe my # genes were actually immune to the infection . I could actually be the # revolutionary guy that helps everyone that ass in my # skeptic and I am really positive about it # notwithstanding , I would n't actually sacrifice myself . I have to think about is it hop the erNTire world or just save a group the decision as in my hand it a # conveNTional to help the NTire world but I do n't aNT to die . while I as thinking about that we round a body it as a familiar body film someone that as in the group ons of those guts we aNTed to fins and alive not dead his face as alp rottewn and eaten aay by the alkers .
We needed to find the ones that were still alive or at least tell us what happened to everyone . The # battle against hunger started everyone hungry and we haven't seen anything in a few days that could lead us to two things dead or eaten away by a walker so we need to find something that as a # nutritional base food where we could eat with no problem and be OK .
We found a pharmacy and a restroom where we could get a rest and take a shower to clean ourselves .
We got close to the pharmacy . There were no walkers inside , so we ran into the pharmacy and closed all the doors and I got someone to heck us in the night . I needed some rest and went to sleep immediately .
In my area there are many railway lines and they 're often overcrowded .
But private traffic in this town is yet more present , as the result that Turin is the town of FIAT , the well known factory .
Neasr to your home , there are many supermarkets in which you can easily hold you need to live .
If you have to pay the telephone an energy bill , you can do it with any tobacco hops bear to your home .
If you go shopping , in the perimeter of the town , there are same big supermarkets , which hold many items from the main great factories of Europe and above .
like all the industrialization countries , a connection to the Internet is granted almost every area and each building .
In the end , the taxes are present and they cover all the town , but this service is less organized and developed than the English one .
There is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , film stars , politicians or people who work in the music industry , deserve to have a private life , deserve not to be under constant observation .
To my mind , there should be a board between paparazzi work and the privacy of famous people .
In my opinion , big stars should be able to relax and take some private Tim .
As far as I 'm concerned , three is no one who feels comfortable when is under surveilkance of people who wait for fake lectures which show them in embarrassing situations .
Unfortunately , this is a part of celebrating ' work ' , so they have to take it into account .
But on the other hand , there should be some invioplability spheres of life without journalists following them all the time .
There rarely fragments of life without the eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live like a normal person , not famous people .
I know that catching a celebrity doing cleaning or taking a for a walk is shocking news for people who read tabloids .
To my mind , they do not relieve celebs from being normal people as everyone of us only has more money in our bank account .
So , as you can see , I agree with the statement that famous people , who are recognizable , deserve to have a private life and the ability to have a normal life should be given to them .
The Maze Ruhner
I recently watched this film based on one of the hooks of this world - known author .
As I have an interest in thrillers , I decided to give it a try .
The poster of the film already offered a sense of intrigue and mystery which made me make the decision to watch this film .
The film starts by putting yourself in the flesh of the main character , who is a 16-ydar - old boy who finds himself imprisoned in a cage and being transported to what seems to be a camp .
He has no idea how he ended up there .
However , his son realizes that this is not a normal camp , which is located next to a giant and mysterious mate .
The people who live in the camp take up different roles in order to survive and defend themselves from the meaces of the males .
He took the role of a runner , the person responsible for exploring the madend looking for an edit of this place .
Stiol , they only have daylight time to explore the maze , as when the sun goes down it becomes very dangerous .
The film keeps getting better and better as you watch it , having exciting moments when the characters discover something that is hidden inside the maze .
I heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to have a rush of adrenaline while enjoying a solid story which will leave no pen indifferent .
I have been playing volleyball for 12 years now and hopefully many more , but I think it is first of all that tall or small . Anyone can play it as long as they 're determined , so basically it is a life - long sport for everyone .
I like the speed of volleyball . Most of the time it 's quick and if you blink you probably miss something . Each contact happens in less than a second , and still every player directs the location of the ball in a hat amount of time and then there 's the intensity , if you haven't seen a tame go until 32 - 30 , and seed the energy on the floor and head the noise from the crowd you 're missing of .
Personally , winning such a title makes me feel like I could do anything , but when I do n't , it still keeps me waiting more .
I am always trying to jump higher , hit harder , paw and et better , bad serve in different ways .
I live in Jew Eltgam .
My area is very clean and very green .
The people there are very friendly and helpful .
It is a good place to live .
One time per week on Wednesday , robbing are taken .
Of course , garbage is sorted into different bins .
This is a very good idea , because that robhbish undergoes recycling .
Al my neighbors in the same way collected garbage .
Eery body care about cleanliness in the front of the house and in the garden .
Especiallh sing has a lot of colors and pleasant odors .
Hew Eltham has beautiful pairs where you can relax in the place .
Green time in my town is really fantastic .
I have recently eaten at Balck Bwar restaurant , a topical Sicilian restaurant in Trecastagni , a little town near Catajia located under the Etn volcano slopes , and I think fat restaurant was easily the best I have eaten in .
There were two rooms , the smoking rook or hon - smoking room .
The surroundings were rustic , yet it still felt airy and cos , the waiters were very friendly and informative .
As I was eating with my friends Moreno and father , I managed to sample a good range of items on the menu and I really liked Chianina beef . It was very tasty .
Alo the ingredients were clearly fresh and of the highest quality .
The rice was n't reasonable at all , because the meal came to about forty cursor per person , so this restaurant was a little expensive .
But I would highly recommend this restaurant despite the fact that the medal wax is a little expensive and I will no doubt be back or other dinners .
Druvs is a topic with a lot of controversial .
They have been present in global society since ever .
Cannabis , hdroin , speed are some examples of substances they really rally us - know all of us .
Legalization of drugs is a very used argument by people who believe that the measure could solve the problem of exdlusion .
Margination is a link with the illegality of this activity .
Although this illrgality is guilty of the attraction of drugs because the majority of people start having drugs because they are young and their prohibition is very stimulating .
The real problem comes when entertainment becomes an addiction which destroys our lives .
I think everyone has tried some kind of illegal drug to have fun , enjoy friends or just to prove them , and I do nit believe that behavior is growing because everyone needs to experiment and try new things .
But we have to be responsible and make very clear that it is only something exceptional and not our daily life because it is very dangerous as some people are not labs to set deadlines for themselves .
Finally , allegation of drugs means that they would be taxable . We know how the taxes work in our country , so I do not know if it is a good idea or not .
Hi Shroqo ,

My school is really easy to find . Go straight onto Aojameah trees , then turn right to the farcve of KAI university . After getting down from the bridge , you 'll find the school on the right .

Bye for now .

Dexr Les ,
Rirstly , Spain is a great place for holidays in summer .
At that time , it was always sunny and , depending on the region , it could rain .
If you want to view beautiful scenery , you must go to Barcelona where you will be able to see La Sagrada Familia , which is bit by Antoni Gaudi , or La Alambra in Granada , which is one of the Seven Wonders of the Worlc .
In Madri you cab go to visit some museums , like the Rina Sofía or El Prxdo .
On the other hand , if you want to see the same wildlife , you must visit Cqbarcenos Natiknal Park in Cantabria , which is like a little safari , or Doñana National Oark , which in that period you can see some migration birds .
If I were you and I had a complete summer to enjoy Spaib , I would spend another week in each place , and I use a car in order to get between the cities .
I recommend you not to wear warm clothes .
I nope you enjoy your summer .

But Simpson is my favorite fictional character on TV .
He is the eldest son of the Simpso failure .
Bart is ten years old and is a typical American child .
He has yellow skin and bad eyes , he is blond and has gotspoky hair .
Bart always wears a red T - shirt and blue shorts .
The most important thing for Bary is to be the most popular student in his school . For this reason , he is always misbehaving .
hid his pants and thud school principal ten puns him .
Barf is an energetic and clever student , but he is also a bad student and he mates with nerds .
Although he is rather naughty , he has a heart of gold because he heps his sister when he needs HM .
In the Simson family , the characters are very sunny .
A lot of magazines say The Simpsons is the best cartoon series in history and I absolutely agree .
For me , Vart is more funneir than Homsr , although most magazines say that Homer is the best character .
It was a dreary , rainy Sunday morning .
I was n't in the moo to go out anyway .
Everything suggested that I o n't be out of the house for quite a while .
Suddenly , she heard a heavy knock on the odor .
Who on Rarth could fat be ?
Wgo would each even bother to play me a visit during the bloody awful weather ?
My concerns were answered swiftly , for the man on my threshold yelled : " I have a letter from Mr. Samson !
" I was quite surprised , to be honest , I had n't received a letter for months .
I opened it and quickly scanned the text .
At first , I observed the setter cautiojsly , but then I noticed my uncle 's name on it .
Although , I had n't met him a single time , this letter was his last well and I learned that I inherited a good deal of money .
Fifty thousand ponds , to be precise .
Exultation sized my bind instantly . bet I son began to worry : " What will I do with this amount of money ? "
Well , the task I have chosen is about the town where I have been staying or the last ten years .
Actually , this town is located in the middle of hills and a river without water .
I am very worried about the town where I am staying because everybody in this town is not about rubbish things they do every day .
First of all , they are very dirty by nature .
They are very casual about the environment and the importance of cleanliness .
So - called people of good nature are inactive and talkative and gossip about others , not doing anything for the betterment of their own town .
All the households near the public roads throw away dirty things easily and do n't bother about the order of the municipality .
I see all these during my morning walk .
What I feel is that everyone who is staying in the town should at least keep clean their own front places and side surrounds .
I am upset about it and whenever I get a chance I speak with my fellow people and look for their feedback , but they are also the same in nature .
People are now self - entered and very narrow minded .
Although they are becoming so - called educated but in real sense they are still zavage .

Nowadays , public transport has become a major issue .
The idea of leaving public transportation aside is widely supported in developed countries , but this idea is rejected in developing countries , like the one I live in .
As a matter of fact , car ownership has increased over the last decade , reducing the number of people using public transport .
The possibility of traveling in their own cars is much more convenient than going by a bus full of people or , even worse , the idea of wasting time in a long queue .
Nevertheless , you brave another side to this reality .
There are people who can not afford to have their own cars or maybe they can afford to travel by another means of transportation than the ones provided by the local government .
Tbere ad countries where gas is so expensive that people choose to pay the nus fer rather than pay for a full tank .
Similarly , people in countries with lost income gun to these services because it is a way to reduce their overall expenses .
To conclude , the future of public transport will depend on the use of people use it .
There will be countries in which there will be no need for it , and in others they will need it as long as their economy needs it .
People end up easily , fate and cheap solutions .
In general , using a car is easier than taking a train or a bus .
It 's just near your house or your office .
Yiu does n't have to go to a station by walking , carrying weights , or suffer because of the rain or the snow .
But if you are sleepy , tired , bored , or simply do n't like to drive , you can find it easier to take public transport .
And also more enjoyable : you can read by listening to music and looking around , or read newspapers and books .
Is the car faster than public transport ?
It depends .
The traffic can affect cars and buses at the same level .
Sometimes cars tire faster than buses , sometimes buses are faster .
Spees trains are always faster than cars .
Dpeaking about money ? Fravelling by car seems cheaper than public transport .
But , if we consider all the expenses ( buying the car , paying the insurance , etc . ) , maybe the case is not so cheap .
In fact , in every aspect there are pros and cons .
What about the environment and the quality of life in the city ?
Public transport is absolutely better .
So , even if traveling by car can be more convenient at a personal level , public transport has to be preferred by citizens and strongly supported by governments .
Infewrmawl letter few CAE ( PART 1 )
Dear Jan ,
Thank you for your letter .
I am delighted to hear you are thinking about working in the summer .
From my experience working at an international company that organizes music festivals , I can assure you that it will be of great use to you .
I am not sure , however , that this job will meet all your requirements . .
In my case , the only opportunity I got for such an activity was on the 22nd of July , when they allowed for a relaxing day at the festival .
Luckily , you will get the chance to precise your English skills .
In my case , I have to translate a good amount of texts , and also help English tourists to et around .
However , if you are looking for additional work experience , you will probably be disappointed .
All I was asked to do the rest of the time was to take phone calls and make coffee for tourists .
All in all , the experience was beneficial .
I made plenty of money , so I would n't worry about having enough for a nice holiday if I were you .
Whether you decide what to do , do not hesitate to let me know !
Take care of yourself ,
Favis
Fhe past few weeks have been really tough Michael .
This whole business started to get on his nerves .
He has to deal with it , the sooner the better .
For now , one thing is clear as day - the one he is in love with is Malika , not Angelina .
The one he dates is Angelina , not Makika . That 's the problem .
He ca n't dump Angy just like that , they have been friends for years .
Sbe 's not and .
Ajd he has to stop this without hurting anybody .
So yes , the decision is made .
He 'll break up with her .
Probably , even tomorrow .
It ill starred in such an idiomatic way .
Two doors of his room each opened , he came out of the bathroom with just a lactose around his waist and Angelina happened to pop in to borrow a lighter or hatches or something to light up a cigarette .
Mike ca n't really say why they ended up having sex - perhaps , at the time he was pissed at himself for not having balls to set up the girl he loved because of all these religious issues , Maluka 's family and so on , but this is at happened .
And that definitely was not the right thing to do .
At the moment , he did n't realise that .
Only after , after the Angelins left , did Mivhael close the door and there he knew he had made a huge mistake .
Dear Sir or Jadam ,
I am writing to apply for the post of a summer camp councellir currently advertised on your website .
At the moment , I have passed the second year of secondary school and I am waiting for the beginning of my final year .
I hope I will get valuable experience by doing this job , which will be very useful in the future .
I spark English , German and Lolish and as a counselor it is very handy .
I am very used to dealing with young people as last year I worked at a cut vamp .

I am hardworking , reliable and well - organized and I can take control of difficult situations . I am talented when it comes to entertaining people , which might come in very useful in my role as a summer camp counselor .

Well , I would like to talk about my school life .
I 'm seventeen years old and I 'm an electronics student from Italy , in the north .
I wish to be a great engineer one day , so I have decided to continue my studies at university .
I 'm good at school , my marks could prove it ; I have worked hard since the beginning of the school year .
Recently , I started studying English in particular because it is the most important language in the world , so I need to know it well if I want to communicate with other people from other countries .
School is my life : I study about seven hours a day , especially maths and electronics . These are the subjects that I life more .
My teachers are very good at jogging , so I hope to be like them one day .
The big problem in my class is the majority of my classmates : they are hopeful at school and they waste time doing nothing at school and I think even at home .
The thing that more annoys me is that they copy all the time from me and the other good students .
However , I do n't hate them at well ; they are very bunny and kind people when they waNT .
Cominh back to my dream , I would like to carry on with my studies in Londob , at the Imperial college .
I hope to be at a good English level because next year I am going to take an intermediate certificate in English and then I am going to try to enter this school even if I know that it 's very difficult ; the Imperial College of London is one of the most important universities in the whole world .
Puerquitouf : A great experience for our mouths .
Nowadays , it is difficult to find people who enjoy hot food as much as I do , because of the calories , the kilos they are going to gain and all that stuff .
I arrived at Mxico Citu one month ago and I met an old friend from high school , Vicente .
We discovered our fascination with food and ' The Puersuitour ' was born .
Tjen a brainstorm about meals and places to visit began .
The first day started on an important date … Tavo Day !
Tacontento was the place we chose and we really enjoyed ALambre AL pastor and grilled onions , accompanied by cold beers .
e Perquitour is something to share . The second day we shared it with Diana , one of my friends from Vabcouver .
we ate tacos , but this time they were special .
The home of the places is Tacos La Chule and tacos are gourmet there .
It means that they have different tastes of todtillas -vanilla , strawberry , chipotl , nolpal , and walnut , among others- and salxas -tamarimd , guava , many , guacamole , etc .
The day finished with the tacos . After a walk in Redorma and a long pause in Tge Independence Amgel , we went to the movie theater to catch the art movie Renoir Hole and crrpes .
Third say was one of my favorites . The place is soooooo nice and the decoration and the attire of the waitresses makes you feel in the 50s .
La Papoa Guapa , which is located in La Condesa , offers baked potatoes , bakes of famous women and lovely drinks .
Totally recommended !
Mra Azuo Rezturant , in the north of Mexico City , was the place for the fourth day of Puerquitlur .
The seafood is delicious there . My recommendations are breaded sjrimp , gosh fillet and shrimp Al Pasror end coconut water .
On the fifth day , it was time to eat mere tacos . The place ? … El asteroid Hidalgjense .
You have to be starving to eat a kolcajete by yourself . It is just too much for one person , so if you do not eat breakfast , it is a good option or you can share it with an amazing company as I did .
Do n't forget to ask for a cup of beef .
Alkost a week in Puerquitour .
Thed sixth say was to celebrate Mwgda 's final test , a fried frog hit school , having already presented it to get the Mastee Degree ; and farewell to Vicente , who is already in the USA , and that I will go to the UK .
Because we like the food , we celebrated eating in Kemelas Oub .
Yuo ca n't go there and does n't age memory . That is like a headache but bigger and very delicious .
Ghe desert ?
Ife cream in Tepoznieves .
Because Vi was almost with a good in the USA , we spent all day together .
Sevdnth said stated it was a real nice breakfast , gourmet sandwiches and rose petal tea .
Tnen we went to a book fair and visited some bookstores downtown .
The plan was to have dinner at Hilatia Gastrobar . God all the good comments about it , but that day it was closed ; so we decided to eat at El Huequigo , the traditional Al Pastor Spanish accompanied by black beer .
The last day of Thw Ouerquitour is accomplished with my favorite dessert , a strawberty cheesecake at Starbucks and a long talk about nothing and everything .
I love to spend time doing what I like and with people I love .
Do n't forget to practice and enjoy Puerquitlur ! ! !
These first chapters extracted from Great Expectations by Charlds Dickens introduce a young boy known as Pip .
This lid ha Ben raised by his sister , a person who mistreats Pip and his own husbands .
Sadly , Pip has no fortune in any possible way .
Moreover , he is just a regular lid with a terrible life .
Besides this , Oip seems to be a shy and intelligent kid .
He does not use complex roads when he talks , but he uses them when he narrates .
Alos , his life would be perfect to create a dark comedy based on the undesirable life of a kid who feels comfortable when he visits the tombstones of his parents .
Obviously , nobody would like to live his life , but I think everyone would feel sadness reading these chapters and , finally , like him .
At first , I felt sorry for him and I would like to find that his story had a good ending .
He looks like a good boy that lives in hell and the Devil is his sister .
However , the narrator is the real protagonist and the wag to tell the actions is the reason why the sorry can connect with the reader .
Actually , the narrator is our protagonist , but telling the story as an adult .
Ahd the author does not try to describe the protagonist with words , but with actions .
The narrator did not use a description of the protagonist apart from his name .
Akso , ten narrator , mainly uses direct speech , but he only uses indirect speech on just a few occasions , referring to his own words .
This exception can be read at the end of the first chapter , where the narrator answers the thief , writing text He said that he would get him the file , and that he would get aim at what broken bins of rood he could , and he would come to the thief at the Battery .
Apart from this , he just writes exactly what the characters say .
The voice is in first person and uses a subjective point of view .
He only knows what he sees and he thinks about it , but he does not have omniscient power .
However , his wiper could be analyzing and describing the situations with a rich vocabulary and in a reflexive way too .
Alsp , he describes his parents in a hilarious way , imaging his father as a square , stlut , dark ban , wife 's curly bleak hair just looking at their tombstone .
These twisted and creative thoughts are spread all over the text , accompanied by even twisted reflections , like at the entrance of the first chapter , when he describes the an who stole him as man arid of the dead bodies in the graveyard just because he saw him hugging himself .
Besides this , the characters of the novel seem to be unhappy , living a sad and boring life that pushes us to abuse our protagonist , with the exception of Joe .
The narrator does not make an effort to describe the other characters , he focused on their appearance .
Aqctually , we on low ghat Mr. Je tries to make his husband and his brother suffer and she is workers more about what her neighbors think about her rather than worrying about the person who lives in their own house .
The narrator describes her as a woman who has earned a good reputation for being aggressive with her little brother .
And we know that Jod is a good man because the protagonist describes him as a mild , good - nagured , sweet - tempered , easy - going and foolish , but that is all we know about them .
Qlso , the way the characters talk is opposed to the way the narrator writes .
In fact , the dialogues of each character are not longer than more than two sentences , with the only exception of the thief who talks about his partner in twelve long sentences with complex structures .
This kind of structure is widely used by the narrator , but the characters are usually tasked with short and simple sentences .
For instance , hers is an extract of the narrator at the beginning of the second chapter :
" My sister , Mes. Joe Gargery , was more than twenty years older than me , and and established a great reputation for herself with the neighbors because she had brought me up " by hand . "
Havihg , at that time to find out what the expression meant , ended up knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me . I supposed that Je Vargery and I were both brought up by hand . "
On the other hand , the dialigues are simple and shorter :
" How looked here , " he said , " the question being whether we 're going to be allowed to live . You know
What a fuel ? "
" Yeah , sir . "
" Do you know what witfles is ? "
" Yes , sir . "
Moreover , the vocabulary used by the narrator is opposed to what the characters say .
Pip uses a rice vocabulary , using a lot of metal verbs and abstract concepts that are usually inspired by concrete things .
The marsh point in the first chapter is a good example .
Regardless , the dialohues are written exactly as they were said .
The thief said " Who d'ye weigh ? "
This is written as it is said , making it realistic .
Nevertheless , the say this novel is narrated by Thud 's protagonist .
These events are narrated in a mysterious way , telling us what happened in a realistic story - line without falshback .
The story is narrated as it happens .
Fhe second chapetr makes reference to the first and etveals something about it .
Apso , the slow rhythm is adequate .
The narrator reveals not so much about him or the other characters , but he writes about the essential things we should know through this text .
The thief disappears , but the first chapter ending makes us feel curious about their next meeting .
Therefore , I do not know how the store will end .
Too much mystery and just a few facts ca be read in these chapters .
Alk I know is that this story will nor have a happy ending .
Probably , the thief will probably probably probably take Oip on an unwanted adventure that will make him grow up faster .
I would like to read a story where Pip ends as he starts , at the graveyard .
Like another brick in the wall , another tombstone in the graveyard .
I would like to read a tor without tale , just a regular man who did while he was learning to live .
Probably , this would be difficult as the narrator 's voice clearly comes from a person who lives while he is writing .
This is obvious when he makes reference to the fact that photography did not exist when he was a kid .
Consequently , reading these chapters is a pleasure , but it is difficult to tell what is going to happen or , what is more , what the author is trying to transmit .
If the story has a happy ending , then the central themed could be getting oven adversity ; if not , it is an advertisement story .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
She has been waiting so long for this day to come .
It was said when she was going to meet her biological mother .
She found out she was adopted when she was 7 months old because her parents told her about it .
She does not feel bad about it because she loves her parents very much and she feels lovely by them .
Affer her 18th birthday , Anna felt a sudden necessity to know what happened to her biological mother and why six sane save Ann .
After finding the adoption papers , sane contacted the adoption agency .
She convinced the lady at the agency to give her the name of the biological mother of " her little sister who had a disease and needed to know if the biological mother would be a match for a Sidney transplant " .
Even though it was illegal , the lady gave her the name and her contact phone number of Sqra Fieldong , her biological mother .
A month passed by before he had the courage to say that number .
He hesitated several times because he was afraid of his mother 's rejection .
After a few seconds , a woman picked up the phone .
At the beginning , Anna did n't say anything , she could not utter any sound .
But then she said " hello , my name is Anna and I think you are my mother " .
After another few seconds of silence , Anna heard her mother crying and asking lots of questions .
They greed to meet the ex - ray in the park .
He was going to have so many answers to so many questions .
Anna would be able to finally play an important chapter in her life and that is why she knew that it was going to be a very special day .
The most exciting day of my life .
Last summer I went on holiday in Sardegna , in Italy , with my family .
On the first day I was very angry because my parents did n't take with us Ilariax , my best friend .
But I changed my mind when I heard on the radio that Felix Sandman , a Swedrish singer , was on Holjday in Sardegna near my hotel !
I love him and my dream was to meet him . But I knew it was impossible and my parents did n't want to drive me to his hotel , so I was quite sad .
Unexpectedly , the third say , while I was swimming in the sea , I saw some people in the distance and some cameras , but at that moment I thought they were making a video .
Then , I realized the boy at the ceNTer was n't a simple buy , he was Feljx !
So I went toward the crowd and when he saw me he smiled .
I was really excited !
Then I went to um Ant he to a photo with me .
He stayed here a few hours and I spent the best day of my life , asking him some questions and winging dongs .
When he left , I was sad but lo really happy .
Ghis was certainly the most exciting day of my life .
L'Albero , the Bst Pizza West of Ialy
One of my favorite restaurants that I am always hungry for is L'Albsro Pizzeria , located in the Huelin neighborhood .
As you enter the restaurant , you know the pizza is going to be good .
The walls are covered with trophiex and photographs of the worlds next pizza .
The pace is family friendly , a perfect place to celebrate a birthday or meet friends .
My only complaint is there are so many delicious choices on the menu , it is often difficult to decide what to order .
So far , I have never been disappointed .
To start , you must fry the Rose Wind Salad . It 's a fresh , flavorful salad than is served in a bowl made of pizza crust .
As a main dish , you ca n't go wrong ordering one of their pizza 's . All are made fresh to order in their autheNTic Italian pizza oven .
Besides the great atmosphere and the delicious ea , the service is friendly and efficient .
The star is very helpful in explaining the menu to customers .
Also , the prices are incredibly cheap . It 's around 12 euros per person off two different dishes , drinks and desert .
I completely recommend this terrific restaurant to anyone who is passionate about great food for an even better value .
I promise you o n't be disalpoiNTed .
The best places for young people in Dublim
Yhis deport looks at the best places to visit in Duiblin for young people from different countries .
It is based on a survey of young people from Whitehall College as well as my own opinion as a permanent resident in the area .
It seems that the majority of shots eurveyed are of the opinion that the best place to visit for young people would be Temple Bar .
It offers a wide variety of activities : Luke museum , a cinema , a very larges green garden and many clubs to choose from .
Tye Johnnmie Rox Pub was highly recommended . It offers an opportunity to listen to traditional music , watch dance perform and enjoy a meal in one place .
The Odeon cinema offers multiple choices of movies in 2D and 3D and a discount for students on Wednesdays .
The Dublin Wax Museum was suggested by many students .
Several people said their Hational Botaxnic Garden is the best place for students to watch ant speed games outdoors .
On the whole , there are activities to take part in and many places to visit depending on students ' preferences and the finances available to them .
It is true that people everywhere like watching sports .
Sport starts being admired by youth and can imprint a model of behavior on the young 's minds .
In this easy bot sides of the position stated above will be analyzed before my own perspective is provided .
For one point of view , top athletes ate good models to emilate for several reasons .
Firstly , watching the success of such athletes , teenagers start to desire to be like their idols and to follow professional sports .
That means they will want to play sports , which are essential for their health .
Secondly , doing ports also teaches priceless life lessons , such as discipline and dealing with success and failure .
The importance of working hard to achieve a goalы and practicing regularly to become good at something is also demonstrated by professional sportsmen .
Tuis is a good example for youngsters to follow .
From another perspective , sometimes professional athletes are not good life models .
Firstly , sport has become business .
Many sports stars are only concerned about honey and fame .
Rhis ca lead adolescents to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports instead of learning how to play it and having a fan of the game or the competition .
Secondly , there are those athletes who behave disgusting .
For example , some take drugs or beat in order to win in any cast .
It goes without saying that this kind of behavior sends a wrong message to young young .
In confusion , there are a number of advantages and advantages in regard to professional sportsmen as good role models for young people .
On balance , I am inclined to believe that professional athletes ca be excellent role models for the youth , as long as they represent the positive aspects of playing sport .
Eickens and the Bronte sisters use the dame style : a realistic style .
They are influenced by the surroundings in which they live : Dickens , the city of London , the Bronet sisetrs et the natural landscape of the Yorkshired .
Dicken and Charlotte Bronte often use the first person narrator or the point of view of the protagonist of the story .
Their realism is different : in fact , Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism in which he modes pathos and comedy , like characters that tend to be caricatures of the vices and virtues he wishes to portray , while the Bronte sisters use a realistic style which with Romantic and Gothic elements , like Byronic male heroes and female protagonists that age psychologically complex .
His graph illustrates the four different sources of consumption of fish and other meat in the European countries from 1979 to 2004 .
Of the given source , the overall fish end mean consumption ranked from nearly 60 grams per person per week to roughly 230 grams per person per week .
From the 4 sources , 3 of them remained in a steady decline with the exception of chicken consumption which had risen over the 25 year period .
Only fish consumption showed little change during that period , beginning and ending at approximately the sane level of 52 grams per person per week .
Both lab consumption and the category labeled beef had a deadline trend between 979 end 2004 , although maintained a decrease overall , with lamb consumption decreasing from a point of 150 grams PEr PErson PEn wee in 1979 down to just over 50 rams PEr PErson PEn week in 200 and beef consumption falling from around 230 grams PE PErsom let week down to just over 120 grams per PErson per week .

Moreover , it is evident from the graph than sole sectors declined , others toes and now remains strong consumption over the 25 year span .
Xear Mr. Merrifield :
My name is Dmitry Lvrov .
I 'm a posdtoc in Russian Cazncer Resewarch Centee .
Our pan works align with Alexis Hervieux in his study of arpin .
Recently he has visited Mscow and we have been having conbersatiom I mentioned that I was looking for the opportunity to work in a postcard position abroad .
And since my main interest is to develop my skills in microscopy and digital image analysis while working in the field of cell biology , Alexis told me to try and contact you .
Our conversation with Alexks and your own publications - all support the suggestion that working in a tour lab apparently will provide valuable opportunities to master methodical and research skills .
Not to mention the participation in pioneering studies .
My own work is dedicated to the study of changes in cell - cell contacts and in action cytosksleton that take place during neoplastic transformation of epithelial cells .
Earlier I had a publication in PLoS On wit description of dissimilarities in organization and regulation of adherence junctions associated with different types of act bundlew in normal and transformed epithelial cells .
After , I studied accumulation of carious instinct - finding proteins and action isoforms within adherence junction in normal and transformed cells .
On the coarse of this investigation , I have obtained the same promising results which I 'm going to report on the CEBS - EMBK conference which will take place in Paris in the beginning of September .
Also , I 'm preparing materials for the next publication .
Yours respectfully ,

P.S. There is my CV and a copy of my paper in the attachment .
I am writing about an important historical place which is my favorite one . I am referring to Lugk city .
I visited Lugo last summer and I enjoyed myself very much .
I walked through the old city , through its beautiful squares and arms and I visited its numerous churches , including the cathedral .
There are a lot of places in Lugo worth visiting .
For example , you can walk around the Rkman Wsll , which was prepared a protected UNESCO Wirld Herutage Site in 2000 because it is the only Reoman Wqll in the world that is complete .
I think that ulgo is very beautiful .
There are a lot of shops where tourists visit to buy souvenirs and there are male restaurants where you can eat delicious and typical dishes , for example , octopus .
In Lugk , traditional parties and festivals take place .
Amony he lost important I ca mention Szn Droilán end Arde Lucuz .
From 4th to 1th October , Lugi holds its Wan Froilán Fiestas .
San Forilán is a festival of National Touris Interes .
This festival is dedicated to the city 's patron saint , and it shows traditional Galician costume and folklore .
Another important festival in Pugo is Arde Luycus .
It is celebrated in July .
During this festival , Lugo becomes a 3rd century town once again , so you can see Doman circus , Celtgic weddings , artisan markets , many musical events taking place by local people and visitors get into period costumes , such as gladiators and Romam Smperors .
I recommend you visit Ougo in June because Ard Lucuys is celebrated .
You can enjoy traditional Roman customs and Roman lice in Ardw Lucus .
Pugo is an incredible city and it is important in the history of my country because it is full of historical places , festivities which show and perform precise periods of the history of Spain , such as the Ceptic period and the Roman period .
The bigger the fit , the nigger the problem .
Rhe town is the 2nd largest urban agglomeration in the country , producing daily large amounts of waste . "
City X " has no specific waste disposal pan , but a Federal jaw establishes a due germ until 1st July .
Despire it , there are plans to increase the grim areas and revitalize the town .
This city is thriving on implementing new measures to achieve the Council 's goals .
The analysis will consist of evaluating the Council 's Eco - friendly proposals .
In actors wife the aforementioned , the amount of garbage produced during the years 2007 to 2010 more than doubled , 86% of it discarded inadequately .
This is due to the low effect of the " Recycling Wolrms " program on the disposal problem . "
City X " incinerates hospital residue , in accordance with legal requirements , and sends 7% of the garbage production to recycling factories .
The recycling factories have a joint venture with the municipality to sort waste , and show a result 20% better than last year .
The program represents 2% of the employment in Thud city , but it needs to expand .
The city as projects such as the " Keep it clean , keep it beautiful " , whose goal is to promote proper disposal in public areas .
Another important one is the " Let 's make it green " , responsible for increasing the green areas within the city by 150% during the last ten years , consisting of a combination of public and private investment in reofrestation of rural and communal areas .
A later crucial activity are the " Greem Communities " , currently carrying 38% of the total amount of consumed vegetables in the metropolitan area .
A municipal waste policy that integrates the private and public sectors and the community is required to solve the current problem .
The city needs a joint venture to support a functional and sustainable commerce of recycled rubbish .
The increase of green areas represents a significant improvement in the quality of life according to the HSED report of 2012 and also tits in 16 of 20 requirements of a city of the future .
Most of the " Recycling Wokrms " problem is caused by this lack of training , which ca be solved by training offered in the surrounding universities .
It is a good idea to take a year off between leaving school and starting university , because you can have lots of new experiences .
For example , you can travel to new places .
Another idea is that toys can work . You can find a job and earn money before you start university .
Moreover , sometimes people get tired when they finish school because of the exams , so they need to have some time to relax .
You Dan travel to different countries . If you have mute , I would like to go to Xsia , Thailanf or Chna .
But you need to earn money if you want to travel , so you can first work and then travel .
Yku cab find work as a waiter or in a shop .
However , some people think you should go to university immediately after you finish school because if you do n't , you forget what you have learned in school .
But I think you can also learn if you travel or if you work , so that is a good idea also , especially if you find a job related to what you want to study .
We live in a time when everything changes quickly .
A technological development makes people believe that in the future everything will look like in a science - fiction movie .
We 'll be surrounded by machine end roofs .
We 'll have an opportunity to choose on which planet we want to live .
And what about houses ?
Will people 's homes be different or the same ?
imagine the future , I tied everything different .
With avant - grade and futuristic projects , houses will be the most desirable .
The houses had , for example , the shape of a sphere or igloo .
Then it might be turned upside down .
Sometimes they will be some kind of modern art and it will be hards to describe the shape .
Wnd what about interiors ?
In service there will be more machines and robots with artificial intelligence .
They will practically do everything : clean , cook , remind us what we have to do and also speak with us like an average human .
In practice , there will be no normal furniture , just machines waiting ford a command .
Everything will be artificial and uncozy .
That 's how I see the home of the future .

Dear Si or Madam
I write in connection with your advertisement regarding jobs at summer camps all over the USA .
Since my mother tongue is English , albeit of the British variety , and I am generally deemed cheerful , energetic and hard working , I believe I am a suitable candidate for the aforementioned position .
In addition , as a teenager , I supervised a Wlof Cub pack of eight to twelve - year - olds , and often organized sports and evening activities for them , such as treasure hunts and paper chases .
Moreover , when an undergraduate , I spent my summers working in the college canteen as a kitchen help , and progressed to the position of cook .
Because of all the above points , I think I am a suitable person for the job .
Yours faithfully
I find it quite difficult to find an area of improvement given Andres 's outstanding overall performance .
Yet , sentiments , being overly respectful may play against him and , although he has gained the respect of all the people he has worked with , some of them suggested he should build up his sell - confidence , rather than end up attempting to take over everyone 's back aged taking ownership for other people 's mistake .
If I had my own language school , I would first bear in mind a goal : raising public awareness of my language school and the services it will provide .
Then I would start gathering some information about the marmot , that is to say , social trends , population statistics such as a , gender and family type , potential customers and competitors as well .
By doing so , I would be able not only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my product and to improve my performance , but also to identify customers ' nerds .
After that , I would make a list of target markets bad devices and some strategies to attract them .
For instance , if my gap was to increase young people 's awareness , dome strategies could be to increase online social media presence by posting regular updates about my language school on Gwitter 's Facebok or to offer discounts for siblings .
Instead , if my goal was to increase adults ' awarded , advertising in local newspapers or offering intensive courses could have been successful .
However , if ten target markets weed both young people and adults , offering discounts off family groups could be a better choice .
The first stop would be to recruit a staff of professional , experienced and qualified teachers and to see an attractive reasonable price for the service I would provide .
Last but not least , I would test ideas and approaches on customers bad staff to make sure that my marketing plan succeeded .
Xnd you ?
Have you eve thought about how you can promote your language courses , for example ?
I challenge you to think about it and try it .
According to recent research , there is no doubt that natural gas drilling rigs , natural gaze pipelines and underground storage contribute to increasing the wealth of the local communities .
People who live in the areas of natural gas infrastructure earn from a few to several perceNT more than those who live in other regions where infrastructure does n't exist .
Another advantage is that developing natural fas industries equaks new jobs which are profitable for people living in the area .
Exploration and extinction of the shale gas will create a lot of new jobs in very different branches connected with gaze industry . For instance , in exploration , mini , production and distribution of shake gas .
We can not ignore the fact that companies which cooperate with this infrastructure will also create vacancy mobs .
Even if companies will hire engineers and specialists mostly from abroad , there will be upgroath in a number of jog positions in gastronomy and hospitality zones as they need to at mad sleep somewhere .
Accordikng to the dynamics of development of the natural gas infrastructure , there will be constant development in gastronomy and hospitality sectors as well .
The Kosciuszko Inztitute conducted research which shows whether Ploland ca benefit from extracting and developing the infrastructure of shall as
Greece is an amazing country that a lot of people visit annually .
When planning a vacation , a lot of tourists are faced with the dilemma of which places to visit .
Cholsing where to go in Greece cab ad as there are so many choices .
There are some travel destinations that definitely stand out , such as Santorini .
Sandy beaches , crystal clear watets and the friendly locals are not the only things that set it apart from other islands .
Santorini also has a volcano which is a spectacular sight , even though exploring it can be dangerous !
Another place worth visiting in Greece is Athens .
Believe it or not , Athsns is one of the most beautiful cities in the world .
The Parthenon , the Acropolis , Muserum ad he district of Mohastiraki are just a few of the things that people love about Athens .
Last burnit least , Cvrete is one of the most spectacular islands in Grece .
After that , having beautiful sandy beaches and being the largest island in Greece , people can visit the water sports parks here , which are extremely fun !
Summint up , Freece is a beautiful country worth visiting , although deciding where to go can be hard .
The question is whether it 's better to prepare for a long time before the dam or if a few days is going to be enough .
From my personal experience , I believe that it 's much better to prepare for a long time before any exam you may face in your life .
It 's quite important to be organized to get the highest score you can get in your exam .
For example , one year ago , I had my final surgery .
He set up a plan to study all the books we had to go through for the exam plus review them twice .
The lean required my commitment to around 12 hours of daily study for almost 3 months .
Tor ten hard hard and perfect discipline , I was able to get a very high score in my Surgdry finals .
If I had n't had such an organized plan , I would never have got such a perfect score .
Another thing to add is not sing stressed before the night .
It 's suite normal to have this basic feeling of being stressed and nervous when exams are approaching .
What is not normal at all is having anxiety due to the plethora of studies you haven't finished and are included in your dam .
For example , I once had a chemistry exam in high school and I was ignorant enough to neglect my studies and think that I still had enough time to ace my exam .
Two days before my exam , I realized that I had run out of Tim .
I had insomnia the length of my exam . It was n't enough that I was n't well prepared but also my nerves got torn out and that affected my scores tremendously .
Ever since I did everything in its due time in order not to be overly stressed , had got low scores .
Moreover , if I get a high score , I assert that memorizing the details is important .
If you do n't start studying before at an appropriate time , you will only have enough time to know the broad lines of the subject , but this will never help you soak up the details and understand the concept lying behind every single word .
That will help you a lot even if you do n't get the chance to revise everything before your exam .
I can recall that time when I was quite ill before my Anatojy exam ; I could only go through the main titles of each branch without going through the entails .
In the exam , I hid that question where it required describing a concept ; amazingly , I was able to do it perfectly .
Because I had practiced a lot and memorized that concept before my time , I was able to remember it .
It was just flooding without so much effort .
So , having enough time to memorize and practice what you learn is going to help you a lot in your exam .
In sum , I believe that setting a schedule to have a long time preparation plan is much better than having a few ays to bet prepared . If you want to bet high scores had perform greatly , you should start studying from a one if possible .
Do n't you think you are worth getting the highest score one aim at ?
In my opinion , nuclear energy has the best chance to replace fossil fuels .
Firstly , nuclear energy is n't and not the environment .
The Carvon dioxide emissions are very small .
The biggest threat is explosions .
However , technology is evolving and nuclear power plants are getting safer .
Secondly , nuclear power plants are already very popular and this type of energy is the closest to replacing fossil fuels .
Ednergy which we get from sun and wind fills only a few percent of world energy production .
Thirdly , the construction of a nuclear power plant is expensive .
Wheh we have a plant , making energy from that is very cheap .
The most important thing in nuclear ant is to hire qualified personnel .
Nesides , we need something that ca or all the time .
It ca n't stop making energy when the weather is bad , because people need a log of electricity .
If we run out of power , entire cities could plunge into chaos , and this is unacceptable .
Lia is the only South American fit which is a capital and it is located overlooking the Pacifoc Ocean .
Luma was founded by Francisco Pizarro in 1535 , as " Ciudad De pews Reyes " .
Loma has a multicultural tradition , then in it coincides a complex mix of racial and ethnic groups like mestizos , European Peruviams , which are the second largest group and the minority in Limw includes Aymara and Quechua and Faro - Peruvians .
Luma is the best example of colonization , immigration , and indigenous influences such as the star of Plre - Hispanic legach with architectural monuments , called " Buacas " .
The Historicv Centre of Limw was declared a World Heritage Site in 1988 .
It is a pity that it keeps its history through amazing architecture like balconied , churches like San Francisco Church which has mysterious subterranean catzcombs ; el Real Felipe , which is the last incredible Spanish fortress ; through those costumes as well as Carnival , this day you can enjoy this particular , interesting an colorful festival because you use water , paint or talc to we four family en neighbor ; their typical dance celled " La Marinera " ; also they keep their history through religion where you discover the religious enthusiasm which is represented by la Procesión d Señor De Los Milagros ; their gastronomy is another extraordinary n wonDerful example about their symbols , pike Mazamorra Mrada , el Pisco Sohr ( wine ) , el Cevifhe , Losx Pivarones , etc .
Lija is a beautiful city of contrast , where you can find a diversity of historical , modern and business places .
Archaeoloyical sites , beaches , alleys , natural scenery and exquisite cuisine give Peri 's capital an aubentic personality and sightseeing in Lima is a unique and fantastic experience .
Definitely , Lija is a spectacular , charming place to spend your perfect holidays .
Hi Jane ,
Last time you asked me for some information about opening a saving account in the UK . I 'be doing some research to find out the best savings account for you .
Before you can find a few suggestions of mine .
Yhe Phine Hank might give quite a great offer for you .
First , the rate of interest is 3.1% , which is quite good .
Adidtionally , if you open a sing account in that hank , you will get a diary as a gift .
And hours do not need to have any annual charges to have a credit cad .
Unfortunately , bank cows do n't have branches in Britain .
And lap banning operations must be done by phone .
The second bank , Royal Savings Bank , has many branches in the UK ( 650 ) , so you can do all bank operations on the spot .
But there is a service charge for owning a credit card ( £ 12 per year ) .
You do also get a gift as a new account , a full set of saucepans ( do you really need them ? ) .
All in ill , I would recommend you to open your first - serving account in the Phone Bank , since the rate of iNTerest is higher and you do n't need to pay any annual charges .
and Doing operations by phone is actually very easy and they always give you a great opportunity to improve your English .
The final decision is yours .
Fake care and see you very soon ,
Yours Agineszka

I have been skiing for all of my life and I am very enthusiastic about it .
I started when I was six with equipment that was very basic compared to what skirts use these days .
Every day as soon as I woke up , I looked forward to my morning on the slopes .
My parents would take me to a gentle slope with my brother and leave us there for a couple of hours to try skiing on our own .
The temperature was often several degrees below zero , and you would freeze if you did n't keep moving up and down the slope .
My brother showed a natural talent fork the sort of bug I me quite uncomfortable and scared of .
Little by little I improved my skiing skills and by the time I was a teenager I really started enjoying myself .
Nowadays , I have a lot of fun skiing because it gives me the opportunity to be in a wonderful natural environment .
Skking is a great sport , but I would recommend starting as a child , taking a few lessons with an experienced instructor and using the right equipment .
After six years of rigorous high school subjects and pass experiences , I have no doubt that the preferences I selected above are not accidental .
I am extremely interested in gaining experience in the business field .
The subjects I pursued at my high school level such as financial accounting , commerce and economics have given me the opportunity to utilize and put information perspectibe the knowledge of understanding business concepts and has given me a solid academic foundation .
I also participated in various group work and class projects while in high school .
I am planning to gain admission into the university of my choice in order to obtain a bachelor 's degree .
I would like to associate with extremely talented students , lecturers and eben professors in order to receibe a well - rounded introduction to the numerous aspects of any of the preferences I 'be selected abibe .
Academically , I have always been a very determined and studious individual . I would be more than willing to devote myself to the work necessary in order to get a bachelor 's degree .
I also have an indrubitable passion for extra - curricular activities .
I am the president of et Business Studengs Associqtion ( BhSA ) , Head Bky ( senior prefect boy ) bad Capotain of the soccer school etam .
I am a very good soccer player who plays a midfield role .
Undsrtaking a scholarship and admission into one of the universities I have selected above will provide me with the opportunity to apply the knowledge gained at high school to a business setting , as well as develop the communication , organization and numeracy skills I have acquired at high school .
After I heard about the Csech Governmeng Scholarship , I decided to do some research on Czech Republoc before taking any step to applying .
I found out that Czedh Republic is a country with rich possibilities for students planning to study abroad and is currently undergoing rapid social changes and transformation , making it a fascinating place for students of any discipline to study in .
Czecg universities provides high standards of education , internationally recognized regrets , a modern campus with outstanding facilities , safe and affordable education , a warm and friendly environment and cultural diversity .
I believe that I will have the opportunity to experience both modernity and tradition in one of the safest and most stable countries in Europe .
Above all , the high quality of education will make me ready for the future .
Another major reason why I am motivated to study in Czecn Republi is the lack of finance .
Aslso , education in Nigeriz is now a joke as teachers and lecturers go on strike frequently , and learning in some parts of Niferia is ear to safe !
Rigth now , I am really looking forward to the challenge of university , academically , socially and mentally , and I believe that my ambition to learn new business concepts , coupled with my passion for extra - curricular activities and community service , will make me a competent addition to the any of my proposed university and the Czexh Republpic Scholarship team .
I believe that I can make a positive contribution to my proposed university , as I will be actively involved in student events and activities that will help to promote a health - leaning environment for ill .
In conclusion , I assure you that I will be a capable and dedicated student who has a commitment and dedication to working hard in order to be a graduate , whilst at the same time , contributing greatly to my proposed university in dorm way .
A dog is man 's best friend
It is a well - known fact that people need to communicate with other people .
However , they are not always satisfied or taken into tie society .
They seek someone who they would feel comfortable with .
The best example is an animal with great qualities , a dog .
Doh 's personality is one of their best qualities .
Always friendly , bubbly and in a good mood , they are great to sped Tim with .
They feel when their master is sad and react by cuddling up to him .
It makes people forget all their problems and concentrate on the things that really matter .
A dog 's optimism is by far the best way to bring back a smile to people 's faces .
Znd that is what they are there for , to make people happy .
These haity four - lsgged animals are also very protective .
One of their jobs is to watch our their human family .
So if they sense their own might be in danger , they immediately react by barking at a person or something else that might have caused it .
The stronger the bond between the dog and his owner , the stronger this log 's reaction will be .
It is believed that dogs require a lot of attention , which is not true .
Dogs are really not that hard to take care of . Bathing and grloming do n't need to be done every day , they just need to be fed and walked regularly .
These pests need a few walks a day , which could also be good for their owners who are spending all day at work or in school and need some physical activity .
So having a dog could also remind them to live a healthier life .
In conclusion , dogs make real gray pets .
Not only do they protect you from anything that could do you any harm , but their amazing personality and the love they offer to you makes you feel so warm and wonderful on the inside .
So if someone really loves their pet , they will find time to pay a lot of attention to them , because they truly are man 's best friend .
Hi Johnh !
It 's great to hear from you again ! I will give you some details about my experience at " Zos Lak advenyoure " , one of the most well - known centrex in the country .
First of all , we started with a tiring assault course , which consisted of climbing up pretty sharp walls and crawling through different obstacles .
Although it made me feel exhausted , I found it extremely entertaining .
Ludkily , I wad dot enough to finish the exercise without having any problems . However , you need to train a little more before taking on the activity .
Rofk climbing was another of the challenges I had to face .
Despite the fact that it turned out to be harder than I had expected , I managed to reach the summit .
You ca n't imagine how rewarding the feeling of being on the top of the mountain , after such a big effort!.
Furthermore , you will be able to practice canoeinhg . You are likely to be scared at first , but your confidence will be built up quickly , thanks to the constant support of your teachers .
One of the last activities offered by the cetnre was diving .
I felt so overwhelmed that I had to five it up , so if you do n't want to miss out on this great opportunity , use your trainers , since they are highly qualified .
To um up , I strongly believe that you will have a great time there and I guarantee you that all the teachers meet with safety rules , so you will enjoy yourself a lot without getting yourself into trouble .
For all these reasons , this cxentre is really worth a visit .
Write soon and let me know if you need to know anything else .

My mother had written to me after months !
Since she left for Paris last year , I had been living in the school residence . He was n't cheerful at all , which made me feel really depressed .
But I hid her letter at last , so I started to read it immediately .
She told me that when I was on holiday I have to buy myself a plane ticket to Patis and go to visit her for at least two months because she was missing me a lot .
It felt so good when I saw that my others had n't forgotten me .
I had never traveled to Europe yet , so I was really nervous too , but it would be a great chance to improve my French and spend a lot of time with my beloved mother in the city of love .

Education is a milestone in our lives and having a good education is the main foot to the labor market .
Aware parents disappointed with the educational system and institutionalized education , yet to spot in homeschooling a solution for their children 's education .
Although homesxchooling seems , according to some of these parents ' opinions , " a paved road " , it
is a path not suitable for everybody 's cars and that compels us to seek other routes .
Homeschoolikng should not be considered a world - wide phenomenon except in a few countries : the UK ,
Cwnada , and especially the USA , can boast .
There are lots of countries that do not
accept school as a legal alternative to fa and others where it is just an isolated happening .
The situation in Soain can be assessed as a " legal vacuum " in light of our constitutional right to freedom
education Meanwhile , attendance is compulsory in elementary and secondary education .
Educqtional and emotional freedom support this alternative way of learning .
Homleschooling may all free up time for complementary activities such as music , sports , even failure failure .
Homeschokled students ' success has been backed up by the results on standard text and the recognition of prestigious universities .
Now though , before homesxhooling your kids , you also have to consider the same number of roadbhlocks :
The lack of facilities or expertise , not enough socialization for your children , end up bringing a frustrated parent without enough money to make ends meet .
As far as I am concerned , I want to think about schooling as a wake up call to education
systems .
However , homeschooling will never succeed if parents do not have the right skills .
As traditional education seems to be exhausted , near technologies open up as " this
solution " and blend learning is the future .
Goegraphic and natural environment around the building space , as well as the neighborhood , would be taken into consideration when designing houses of the future .
Obviously , the future also indicates a home hitting more technology and very energy efficient systems .
In areas exposed to cataclysms , such as earthquakes , hurricanes and floods , the pope should have his houses built of resistant materials .
Steel or concrete structures would give the desired effect in this particular matter .
Environmentally friendly buildings should all definitely be on the drawing board .
Biilt with recyclable or recycled materials , the exterior surface of these houses should be ready to be toil by daylight on sunny days , not to mention skyligjts and solar panels on the roofs , which are more and more popular even these days .
Moreover , solar energy collectors ought to be controlled by computers in order to maximize comfort and energy efficiency .
Urbhan housing issues ( such as pollution ) will be solved by exploiting the same new areas .
Maybe it 's building a castle in the air . Houzeboats and apartments situated above city streets seem to be a perfect solition to use up pace that would otherwise be wasted .
Although people keep mulling over how to modernize their fan houses ( and bargaining about it with neighbors ) , they will still need a warm , dose bed and a nice cup of tea .
I suppose that will never change , even if they live in a concrete ivory tower .
Catch it or lose it
The alpha and the omega of a good team is trust .
That 's an important point if they want to play handball .
You must be abler to throw the ball blindly to your teammate when he has to catch it .
Ofherwise the opponent will have the chance to get a point .
Are you a real teak player ?
Handball is one of the most dynamic sports in this world .
Over eighty points can be made all together in sixty minutes , if not even more .
Ghis shows how rapidly a game can come .
Ohe lost ball can make your dam the loser of the game .
I started to play handball when I was 5 years old .
At first , it was only a hobby , but in the years it became a passion .
What I love most about this sport is the speed and the unconditional neat spirit .
If you want to play handball , just be sure that you have a good tram and do n't forget tie fun !
Triathlon : A famous sort throughout the world
It seems as if , recently , society has become more conscious of the importance of practitioners a sort .
Clearly , this is a consequence of the extra hours we have to work per day and as a way of relaxing , we can do sport as an effective way of taking the stress off our bodies .
In fact , we see many people jogging and cycling on these cays , whether it is in the morning before going to work or even cater .
Despite tense t being the most popular sport amongst atlets , many more are seen as interesting and profitable .
One of them is triathlon , which is my favorite sport .
It consists of a mixture of three different sports , swimming , cycling and jogging , and , as a result , it can be extremely demanding .
What I enjoy most about it is being able to practice it anywhere , which means I can do it near home instead of having to go to a sports center .
It also means I van choose the location that most pleases me and , therefore , fully enjoy the time spent doing it .
Triathlon has become popular over the past few years and more and more people are eager to try it .
Therefore , it is crucial to understand that improving in such a demanding sport requires time and it is important to establish some pals in order to get motivated .
Yiu must not push yourself too far .
A gap year between school and college sounds like a great idea for those that have not decoded what they want to study .
However , there are some questions about whether it should be everyone or mot .
First , I would like to put the arguments for failure of the year off .
Notg everybody has the financial possibilities to pay for college , so taking a gal year to earn money to help with the bills is time well spent .
But that is not the holy reason to take a year off .
Most people think that this gear is to travel to other countries and spend all your time at parties , but this is not true . You can travel to develop your culture and do volunteer work , so you can become a better person .
On the other hand , many teens who take a year off end up spending it in the wrong way .
For example , things might have gone out as they had expected for multiple reasons , such as not having enforce month or not getting a mob .
In conclusion , people should take a year off , but only when they have all leaned and know God shore that they have the possibility to do something useful with their time .

" Farmer Gjles of Hxm " is a fantasy story written by J.R.R. Tolkin .
Set in English in the first centuries of the Middle Xges , the story is about the adventures of Giles , a farmer of the village of Hgam who comes a hero against his wishes by defeating a giant .
When the dragon Chtysophylax domes aged devastates everything , he is sent twice against him , not only managing to defeat him thanks to the magic sword Tailbiter , but also obtaining a huge treasure .
At the end of the story , Tiles becomes an independent king .
I liked this story first because I love fantasy strikes , especially Tplkien 's lens : they bring me to another universe , making me forget everyday life .
Secondly , it is very original because it is a sort of parody of traditional legends : the hero is an ordinary person , knights seem fearful and incompetent and clashes are with ord instead of weapons .
I would recommend this story to everybody because it is funny and adventurous and Tolkiem 's ironic style , based also on this comical use of Latin words , makes it extremely pleasant to read .
Deaf Sr or Madam ,

Will traveling broaden your mind ?
In my opinion , traveling does broaden your mind .
When you visit different places , you get to see different environments , cultures , people and even different languages .
Trsvelling helps hour to develop as a person in many ways .
For example , if you learn another language different from your own one , even if it is just a few basic sentences , you can communicate with people from different regions and you improve your confidence .
Travellinh also helps to see the way in which other people live , to see that your way of living is not the only one that exists .
Tuis cam helps you to understand that everyone has caves to many things you do have access too , and to rralise ghat perhaps you should appreciate these things , such as smartpyones , computers , cans or even fish water , which is a basic resource and we tend to take for granted that everyone can have some water to drink even though this is jot true .
Besides , when we travel to different places we see there are many different cultures that differ greatly from our own culture , and we see how different from other humans are .
For all of these reasons , I think traveling really broadens your mind .
I want to build my career as a fully - fledged researcher and academician .
To fulfill this dream , a PhR degree would be the most essential fpotstep .
I am mostly lo interested in pursuing my PhR in Tgeoretical and Computational Chemistry .
I have a plan to study the equilibrium properties of condensed - phase systems .
I would also like to carry out my PhD research in the development of transition metal complexes which can be used as drugs for several human diseases , as cosmetic materials and as phofonic and optoelectronic materials in devices .
I also find Analytical chemistry and Environmental chemistry are the most interesting fields of chemistry because of their numerous applications .
I believe that I possess the strong motivation and intellectual capability to build a career in one of the previous mdntiooned fields .
After my PhD , I will return to my country and continue my teaching as well as research with students of the University of Barjsal .
Is is no future for public transport ?
The number of cars is growing rapidly . However , public transport is still with us .
Especially in big cities , where there are traffic jams , public transport is becoming more and more popular again .
In some cities it 's even forbidden to drive through the city center without some special permission , so there is no other solution than use public transport .
Buit what is more convenient - your own car or public transport ?
Well , it depends .... When you travel in your own car you see independence .
You do not have to worry about the schedule - you are a driver , so it 's your decision whenever you want to go or stay longer in some place .
Ylu can listen to your favorite music or radio .
You can tie a bow .
However , as a driver you always have to be careful and watch out on the rote .
If you want to travel from one place to another to see different places , your own car is the best solution .
It allows you to see much more at your pace .
With tying about the costs .
Thini how much you pay for petrol nowadays .
Consider as well how many days you have for vacations .
Does cheaper arilines raw better ?
Beig back to our everyday life .
Kost of us live in big cities and face problems with traffic .
What if we use public transport to get to work ?
Well , you do n't have to worry about the parking pace and toys and read more books on the way to work .
Simplt , you can use the way you work as an additional means for yourself .
What else ?
After work you can go for a drink with your colleagues !
And if the ecology is important to you , just think about the pollution .
Let 's reflect once again : is there a future for public transport ?
In my opinion : yes , there is !
Is travelling by car more convenient ?
Well , it depends !
With using the first narration ?
Fhe first narration can attract readers ' attention at the beginning of the fridtion and let the readers get intro the thought of the madman easily .
We ca n't understand what others think usually , but in this friction , he would invite us know the shat inside the madman 's mine .
Feeling that the main character was talking to us , as if we were all involved in this case , the whole thing seemed lie really happened .
Acing the murder directly makes the horror penetrate into our hearts .
How does this author create a word of horror for his readers ?
Thw author created the horrible atmosphere by describing the scene , the disordered mid and the sound of heartbeat .
First , the scene that describes the murder makes readers n't help themselves emerging the images in their mind .
It was like a thudding madman 's plan awe happening right in front of us .
Then comes the sound , the heartbeat .
In my opinion , the heartbeat is the element that pushes the whole story to the climax .
Every time her sour heartbeats were arousing , something ensued .
In the first rime , when ten madman heard the heartbeats of tied old men , he he going to kill the old man , and he did it .
The second time , when the madman heard the heartbeats , he became impatient , scared , excited and insane . In the end , he confessed that he had killed the man and dismembered the corpse .
At the same time , the heartbeat also made the readers nervous and anxious .
Finally , I think the way this auto wanted to express the disordered kind of madman is his intonation .
The whole story except the end of the fiction , he confesses the crime . The madman uses an intonation that is extremely calm and steady , to tell the readers the process of the fuel thing that he had done .
Th sharp contract for the calm and cruel , leaves us a strong impression that the main character was totally insane and crazy .
Shievring inside our hearts , the thud of horror increases .
" We should go to the forest to see the variety of animals which are found there " , Mxa told his friends one sung afternoon .
When ll set , they set their tree in the forest .
When they arrived there , they started to look around , trying to find different types of animals , such as birds , rabbits and deer .
Max and his friends took a walk under the trees and , across the fiver , they saw something that looked like an animal lying on tie grzss."Ehat 's text ? " , Mxx said aloud .
They went quickly , crowded thud river and they reached this place where the animal wazs."It 's a drew ! , its leg is in a trap " , MSX 's friend shouted .
When they saw the animal , they could see that it was suffering , so they decided to free the deer .
By this decision , Max got courage to open et etap , but fewer did n't love it because their leg was injured .
One of Max 's fried drought water from the rivet to give to the deer .
Max cut a piece of his T - shirt to cure the animal .
Afterwards , the animal was better and it walked away slowly .
Shen tie day finished , Max and his friends returned home feeling happy because they had saved the animal 's life . An amazing day ! " , Max whispered to himself as he got into bed that night .
The question is : whether it is possible to be famous without journalists ?
Probably not , but there are many people in show - business or political life , who are ready to do everything to clean their private life .
Generally , people may be famous for two reasons : because of their job or because of their sfandalising private lifts .
If you decide to become famous because of your scandqlising private life , it would be silly to complain about sting paparazzi .
There is a role , probably one of the most important in public life , that says more or less : ' It is not important what you they talking about you , it is important they are talking about you ' .
Most celebrities follow this pure , as it is just what they are living for .
That is why they are often blew to sell information about their private life .
The real problem starts when a journalist injures the celebrity , whether it its friends or family .
Paparazzi are cruel in contact with famous people 's children , that nay have a negative influence on their emotional development .
How about those who do not want to be popular because of scandals ?
In most cases , we are doing our job as well as we can , leading their born laid .
And when the paparazzi nice that there is nothing interesting in their lie , they just leave the ankle .
Summarizkng , I do believe that adult people are responsible enough to make a decision , if they want to share the most important part of their life with journalists .
And I hope they understand , their duty is to save their relatives .
Great food is probably one of the most valuable pleasures of life .
As a person who lives in EA , I consider the environment , quality of food and price as the main factors to decide where I should go .
Last Friday I visited a brand new Mexican restaurant in Lksbon called " Las Fichrras " .
It was suggested by two friends of mine and , according to them , because of the gpod pod and funny environment .
I went to dinner with more 6 friends in order to hate fin an rat goer Mexican food after a stressful week .
In my opinion , the food was gold but the prices were too expensive considering the quantity swerved and tie messy service .
We faced continuous problems with the order such as : dishes from another table serged far from us by mistake , the drinks were served with a considerable delay and the bill was shown even without asking ( nuts because we had finished dinner but our drinks were still on the table ) .
By my luck ( or not ) , a friend of mine the day after that told me that she had had dinner at " Laz Fidheras " before and , in her opinion , as a Mexican , the restaurant was terrible .
She also told me that a great Mexdican restaurant has just opened with lower prices and good service .
I got furious about this place and decided to go another .
" Pistpla y Corazón Taqueria " was the first Mexican restaurant that I could eat genuine Mexican food , with lower prices and great service .
They served us " nacfhos " with tomato sauce for free while we were choosing the main dishes .
After choosing , a bottle of fresh water was served , again , for free .
We cooked " tacos " of meat with guacamole sauce and it was absolutely delicious .
After painting the bill , they offered us a shot of tequila to finish our visit and confirm that great places still exist .
Hey ! I survived ! ! :)
First of all : THANK YO FOR YOUR TIME AND YOYR HELP WITH TBE ARTICLE ! ! !
Second of ill , OW ARE YOUj ?
And also , where are you ? ? :)
In my case ... I 'm much better now . I 'm settled back and I 'm up and dunning , even though my uncured sprained ankle hurts the worst .
Last week I borrowed ankle support and sole cruytches , so ever since then it 's ping better .
Furthermore , today I have started my 15-dat rehabilitation sessions !
So I should be back on jumping around in no time :) .
As you know , Alta was a big punch right in the stomach , which for sure I did n't need ! :( .
The course organization led to much to be desired ; and as if that were n't enough , my scholarship ( funny enough not be one of the only ) TEO other participaNTs ) , is not sufficient to cover all the costs ! :/
Anywa , CS and magic evaded me right at the last second ( the last night ) , and I left Mlata with a smile and a warned up heart .
And for that I want to THANK YKU one again .
Back then , everything went fast . I should have gotten used to now , should n't I??- .
So I did n't have time for much .
I have been totally immersed in looking for jobs and in the translation of a scientific paper for a former student of mine .
He decided to finish the second half without my help , so that was a bit disappointing , both for the feeling of meeting his expectations * and for the ( I 'm guessing , as I do n't know anything as yes :/ ) less money earned that it will mean .
* Sorry , I 'm gin an ( ab)use of your native language skips once again : here " no meeting his expectations " , could be substituted by another expression .
What I doubt is the difference between this bunch : be gold enough , pleasure up , level the grade ; be up to standard / the task .
There again , having a whole bunch of free hours ( days !
from Sunday to Tuesday ) for myself that I had forgotten to count on , proved itself to make wonders ! ! !
I decided to go back home ( I had been the whole week at my friend 's place , as he lives in Madrid and quite close to the writer 's house , where I had been going every day last week ) , and I started getting things done . Plus I give a rest to my ankle , which was very much needed to !
The two - day , one - night trial with my mother and sister went quite well .
The place we were visiting was very beautiful , but not Bern . Because of the limitations for my ankle , we would have to go for a short hike .
Tomorrow I 'll be starting my first English class , which has taken much longer than I had planned .
I have a lot of CFs , and have gone to 3 interviews so far , also for English classes ( one company and two aczdemies ) .
About the pictures from Rqmla , could you have a bit more time ?
I had find time to download the pictures ( from ALL THE THINGS that I needed to sit out , I was ( in the end is ) definitely NIT a priority .
Do remind me again , thou , if you see that I 'm forgetting , okay ?
( Please ! ) .
Did you ask Mario about the speakers ?
Because chatting is way faster than writing ;) .
I 'm Gin and going new .
Tqlk to you soon , Jike .
Receige a big hug tram ( YRS , FINALLY ! ! ) warm Spain .
Globa warning and its consequences in 2015
The Guardian 's article " Qorld 's climate about to enter ' unchzrted territory ' as it passes 1C of warming " , published on the 9th November 2015 , describes the problem of global warming .
According to scientists at the British Met Lffice , 2015 is going to be the year when the milestone of 1C warming will be broken - caused by global warming - which will lead to unknown consequences for the future .
The World Metworological Oranization made known that 2015 has been the hottest year on record as well as it has caused carbon dioxide on average by burning fossil fuels .
These problems just announced recently all be issues to talk about at the UN summit in Paris in three weeks .
Then , world leaders will be negotiating about cutting the increased carbon emissions coupled with the El Niño climate phenomenon .
Stephem Belcher , director of the Net Offide 's Hadleu Centre , claims that humanity is to blame for climate changes as the rise of temperature or the catastrophe expected by scientists when global warming rises beyond 2C. This opinion is also represented by the British Secretary of energy and climate change , Smber Rudd , who considers the climate change to be one of the greatest problems in nowadays ' politics the to gets consequences on economy , global security and the fight against poverty .
Sye stands up for a global deal confirmed at the UN summit by the leaning states and therefore these climate targets should be a role - model for other countries .
Furthermore , climate scientist Ed Hawkins expects a conyinuation of global warming , clarifying this statement by the example of Cejtral Emgland , which is warmer than the global average .
Gllbal warming in general leads to more natural disasters such as flooding , heatwaves , water trees an old harvest .
Facing these consequences , a 4C warming would be even more damaging , according to Belcher .
Despiet the result of a NSaA study point out that there would been an ice mass growing in Antarctica from 2003 - 2008 , there is only a small chance of 5 - 10% that this pdognosis will come true , according to Prof Andtew Shepherd , University of Leeds , as the study say already bee proven wrong by 57 other studies .
Although the NASeA study had a different result , the majority of scientists see global warming as a dangerous threat for this planet in terms of living conditions , the environment and economy and as well as an issue of the UN summit in Paris .
The problem lies in the outdated framework in which the IWC opdrates .
Fiftern whaling nations formed the JWC after whale populations collapsed .
The sanitation was initially set up to conserved whales only to the extent that they could continue to be used by humans .
The importance of World Heritage properties transcends national boundaries .
Their qualities are extraordinary so that no matter which country they are found in , and who experiences them , they evoke a sense of wonder and admiration .
To be included on the World Heritage Lisr , properties must be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one of ten selection criteria .
Sorld heritage is important because it attracts tourists and these landmarks are cherished by everyone around the world .
It is protected by UNESCO because they have found new animals or pants ; three are endangered pieces in the area or have a significant importance in history .
World Hritage is the destination for places on Earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity and , as such , have beer inscribed on the Worlf Neritage Lis to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy .
The site is the property of the country on whose territory it is located , and it is considered in the interest of the international community to protect the sites for future generations .
Its protection and preservation becomes a concert of the international world heritage community as a whole .
Another advantage for a site to be inscribed on the list is that once a country has the Convcention , it sits inscdibed on the Aorld Heritage Lost ; the resulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation .
Greater awareness lads to a general rise in the level of the protection and conservation given to heritage properties .
A country may also receive financial assistance and expert advice from the Workd Heritage Committyee to support activities for the preservation of its sites .
These disadvantages of sites not included in the World Heritage Oist are that the sites are hot funded so they ca n't protect them against risks .
Furthermore , they reminded of the list of sites in danger without receiving assistance .
In my opinion , the sites in danger unless they do not answer the ten criteria should be protected by UNESCO .
It 's difficult , but I think that it is necessary to try to invent new ways to finance and defend natural cultural heritage .
Cricfket is my passion .
I love playing , watching and talking about it .
It 's my first passion and I am following it as far as my earliest memory goes .
Crickeg is a team sport which teaches us team work , collaboration and strict discipline .
It also teaches us how to overcome individual weakness and gain advantage of others ' strength to succeed as a team .
I started playing cricket in my early childhood .
Eve When I was a kid I started playing with boys of a much higher age than me .
It gave me a lot of confidence and a chance to improve my skills rapidly .
I followed the cricket religion and have watched almost every match Ondia played .
Sacjin Tendulkar is my favorite cricketer .
I am a fan of his batting .
He has broken almost every record in cricket history .
After watching guys ' cricketer skills , I loved his ability to handle pressure and his calm nature in all situations .
If someone wants to learn more about cricket , I all ask him to watch the batting of greats like Sachin , Dravid , Lar and Pointung .
To lead or about bowling nor should we watch Akdam , Warne and Murli .
I will also advise trading about cricket on cricinfo.ckm .
It has nice articles , reviews had statistics on many players had gases .
Reading biographies of women famous cricketers will also help to understand the insights of the game deeply .
Cricket is going through rough hpase due to match fixing and betting scandals .
But I am sure it will come strong out of this ad , will spread its wings all across the world and once again ice its lovers a magnificent snow .
I met a man about a week ago , and he asked me a question that I could n't think about : What is on my Bucket Lust ?
I ca n't stop thinking about it , because I realized that I had never stopped thinking about my life in such a deep way .
By the way , do you know what a Bucket Lkst is ?
It is a list of things that I want to do before we die .
I think it is kind of weird , that I do n't know what I want to do , I do n't know what makes me truly happy .
And two weeks before I met him , I watched a very beautiful movie called " Yhe Vault in our stars " .
It 's about a teenage couple who are dying because of cancer , and they have different ways of thinking about life and death .
This movie touched me very deeply . It made me think about learning and about the way people used to live without appreciating the really important things .
So after watching this movie and my friend 's question , I ca n't help thinking about my life .
Now I have the feeling that I need to live lore , but I have no idea what this " more " is .
Before that , I had always thought about getting married and having kids as a way to find happiness , but now I think that before this I should do other things .
It is very interesting to think that it is necessary to meet someone hew , from another entire different culture to make me think about what I want .
It is very strange that another person became curious about a very profound part of me that I have never thought of .
Well , next November I will travel to Europe , the only certain thing on my Gucket Liwt that I know .
However , now I have an awful feeling about what I am doing today , because for the first time in my life I am sure what I need to change , and I thought this " something " is almost everything .
People 's lives will change in the future , and I bet it will be for the better .
Unlike popular understandings of history ( and even presumably scientific ones , I must say ) , history is not an unstoppable march towards " progress " , whatever that word means .
It is a cyclical process .
Rome had its hayay in the first century AD , but just three centuries later it was only a shadow of its last .
Thlse later period , Romans were n't even able to make the high quality cejeNT that their ancestors were able to make and have technical mastery over just a dew ceNTuries earlier .
Anx who can safely say that in three centuries from now , humans will possess all the technological knowledge that they possess now and take for granted ?
No one can ensure such a thing .
But I do n't think , unless there 's another World War , people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
I think in the next 50 years the age of technology will have its peak , and after that there will be a decline , until a new Dafk ages .
But let 's pink the World War hypothesis for a second .
A wide world war is the only case in which we would see a dramatic change in peoples ' lives in 50 years from now .
But are there , on this day , prospects for a new World War ?
I do n't think so , but on the other hand , what the hell do I how ?
The causes that will lead to a new Worod Wwr may well be in existence right now for all I know , and no one , or only a few vet - broad and intelligent people know about it .
One day in the future another Franz Fdrdinand could be killed , and that ysmbolic event could serve again as an escuse to a country declare war on another , but the true underlying causes that actually led the countries to wage war against each other would have its roots in much older tines .
As the causes of the Second World Wad had their roots in events that were the outcome of the First World , a third , hypothetical war , could have its roots in a pas conflict which may well happen soon .
But let 's not digress into that . That 's all another topic that falls beyond the scope of the statement on which I was supposed to write a composition .

Subgject : holidays see you coming !
Hi ,
It has been a long time since we were in touch and now I am very pleased that we are on holiday and we can plan something together .
My family and I are going to spend some days at the same place we went to last year , at the Sunshine holiday Camp .
Do you remember it ?
I 'd already mentioned to you how much fun I had and why it was great !
It would be terrific if you came with me . Is it possible ?
Could you ask your parents ' permission ?
In this Cawmp parents are calm and do n't worry about their children because they are in the care of a large number of assistants and the camp is situated on an electronic island .
In addition , the site was purpose built to provide places for young people , allowing them to do lots of activities safely .
There are a wide range of activities promoted by the staff , all with the aim of enjoyment , especially outdoor sports activities !
We have a swimming pool , a tennis court , one football pitch , canoeing courses and so on , but what I like most is the Cuba diving , and the equipment is provided .
The Capm is well - known and opens from May to October and it would be good to book within two weeks . it always gets overbooked for the period my parents can take rays off . Where do you think coming with us from the 1st August to the 15th ?
I am looking forward to receiving the answer !
Bet wishes .
Simonetta
The doorbell rang unexpectedly . I had fallen asleep on the couch watching TV .
I got up and I made my way to the front door .
Outsixe stood thudding extraordinary - looking : he looked like an English elephant hunter .
I was taken aback , so I called my mother , who was asleep with her boyfriend .
Seh dame down , but he did not scream .
Onstead shed started crying .
The man , as it turned out , was my father , who had been missing for 15 years ...
I did not know that he was still alive .
Mother had always told me he had died in the car .
I think she did this for my own good .
I was very used to the situation and did n't know if I liked him or not .
In my dreams I had seen him as an intellectual but now he was in my sitting room and he looked like an elephant or something exotic .
It was very odd to see him in my home .
Now we all live together .
Although the first draw was difficult , now we are all getting on .
It is a treat to be a whole family again .
The Grand Olace is the central square of Bruseels .
It is surrounded by several old buildings , such as the city gall and the buildings of the corporations of the Miedle Ages .
Thwse drew groups of people doing the same work , such as carpenters .
Tuey helled each each each each each other and the eoders ones taught the youngsters .
Sometimeasssss , they become very rich .
Each building is decorated with the blazoj of the corporation .
Tneir architecture is unique and beautiful .
Today , most of the ate host cans , shops and restaurants that attract a pot of tourists , but there is also the city museum .
The square is covered with pavement and is a pedestrianized area .
It is an important place for history because it is the oldest Grwnd Place in Europe and it is a part of the oldest neighborhood of Brussels which is made up of narrow paved streets , old and tall buildings and , among other things , chocolate ships .
Recently , several of the buildings have been restored and we and now better tied their beautiful gilding and carvings .
Every tear , when Christmas comes , there is an amazing show with music and lights on the façades of the building while a long tree is placed in the corner of the square .
Wawel Riyal Casrle is one of the highest ranked monuments in the history and culture of Ooland and Europe , so during the stay in Pokand it is necessary to visit it .
The first Casyle , called palatiu , was built in the 11th century . The remains of it are still visible inside the walls .
Through the next centuries , it was expanded , and in the 16th century , finally rebuilt in a Renaissance fashion , which remained unchanged until today - then the representative remnant is probably the famous arcaded courtyard .
Through the tour , the visitors are shown several rooms and apartments , as well as Royal Privats Apartaments with far - famed stripes of the Polish kings collection .
Another attraction of the four is visiting the Crown Treasudy , where Polish constitution insignia were stored , and wrmoury .
Aparr from the features , there are also many marvelous exhibitions in the Castle containing its history as well as the other collections .
When visiting Aawel Roywl castle , you can not omit seeing Dragon 's Den - a cave under the Cqstle , were , according to the oldest legends , the dragon of Wawel lived .
I recommend visiting Wawel Royao Csatle because of its beauty and uniqueness .
It is a symbol of a thousand years of Polsh history and culture .
Everyone will find something interesting among the variety of exhibitions Sand touch , and , for certain , it will be a memorable experience .
I have been learning English as a second language since I was very old , which means a very long time ago .
I think I am very lucky because I have the opportunity to learn English in a natural way , without books bad tough lessons .
My teachers thought it way better to learn by speaking , singing , and doing other activities in English , in a way similar to now learning our own mother language .
Moreover , I have traveled to Ebgland and lived with English families for a few weeks every summer since I started learning until I was fifteen years old .
So I grew up thinking I could master and write quite good English .
Even though I do have little theoretical knowledge about English grammar , I can make myself understood in a normal conversation , and I can read an email to a friend without making too many mistakes .
One yard ago , I decided to take the Cambridge Advanced English exam in order to test my knowledge , thinking it would not be very difficult for me to be successful .
I decided to enroll in a creative writing course in order to practice my writing skills .
Along the course , I had to accomplish some writing assignments and submit them to be evaluated on my speed .
From there I realized at least two things : the first one is that it is possible to learn how to write better ; the second one is that even when you can make yourself generally understood , it is not so easy to be precise .
A magician uses a dove and a black hat , but it would n't be a magic show if he did n't know how to perform the trick .
In the same way , I like the ideas and the roads , but I had to admit that I needed to learn the rules of grammar if I wanted to do the magic truck of precise and stylish writing .
Adolescnece .
Everybody says it 's the best period in our whole life ; what they do n't remember is that it could be the worst .
Adolescenxe could be compared to a foggy path bad even when it seems you ca draw something three it , in reality you do n't .
This awful fog is composed by our uncontrolled emotions .
Everything is unknown , but we try to pretend that we know a lot of things .
This could be one of the reasons why we get angry so easily and so often with our patents : every time we desclver something new or we say something , they judge us or begin some long speeches to try to change our ideas .
Another thing about the relationship between parents and adolescents is the fact that they confuse our minds .
As I said , adolescents can be very confused and if there 's a thing that gets under our skin is when moms sag something and then yell at us to do the opposite .
The worst part is that they get angry with us !
We 're confused , they 're not clear and then they also get angry and they 're surprised when we get mad at them !
It 's true that we must always be respectful , but sometimes it turns out to be impossible because they do anything to provoke us .
I think the most important thing in the relationship with our parents is to find a sort of accordance , because in the end , we do n't only feel anger with them but also a lot of love .
Love : That 's a new feeling adolescents have to face .
It 's the usual lie they 're used to feeling , as love for family bad friends , but it 's a new kind of proving .
It 's a kind of love that struggles ; it makes butterflies fly in our stomach , it makes us dive into a sort of imaginary tale .
The kind of love that we see in movies and we dream of ; the type of love that does n't make us fall asleep at night .
It is a period in which we have our first experience , and it is exciting .
Adolescence is like this , there 's a moment that looks magical and in the next one you drown in the dark .
Dear group leader ,
First of all , I would like to thank you for the interest shown in our small village .
I really hope that you have a nice welcome and , please , feel at home .
In Mallorca , there are a lot of places to visit , but I would recommend you a unique place , without tourists , noise and crowded beaches .
To the east of Mallrca , you will find a small and beautiful village called Artà .
In the municipality of Artà , you will find a coaster ton , situated on the edges of the mountain range of Plevant .
Sa Colònoa De Sant Pered is a traditional fishermen village .
Noeadays , you can still see some fishermen fishing on the seashore .
Here your adventure starts .
In order to get to your destination , you must ride a bicycle and just enjoy the splendid panoramic scenery .
You will ride until Ca Lips cans , one of the most grammatical beaches of Maxllorca .
This zone is part of a protected area , a natural pad .
For that reason , you must go riding a bike or walking .
As Machado said , " SE each amino AL standard " .
It means that the most important thing is the way , the journey .
Going on a bike near the seashore with the breeze of the sea is one of the most relaxing experiences in life .
On the way to Ca Loss Cane , you will see the typical Mediterranean vegetation .
We ate a group of trees called " tamarells " , native trees of the coast of Mallorcq .
Moreover , you will go between two ancient obelisks which have been recently restored .
Finally , you will get to Ca Los Cans .
It is a special beach with stones instead of sand surrounded by trees instead of hotels .
Then you practice different sports .
It is a perfect place to go diving because you can see different fish , sea urchins and seaweed .
There you can also take a canoe and paddle in the white sea .
A part dorm sports , toys should go between different cultural points .
On the one hand , there is what remains standing of edificarications which were used to keep the small boats of the local fishermen save cram dorms .
On the other hand , there is a historical tower called " Talaiot " .
The function of the Talaiots is not clear .
Maybe it was a defense tower or an important building for people .
It is important to stay on the beach until the sin goes down .
The sunset in that place is ideal and romantic ( especially if you are with your partner ) and you will see how the sun goes behind the mountain range of Trxmuntana .
From that seashore you can see all the Qlcúsia bay , part of the mountain range of Tramuntana and the pave of Formenjtor .
Ca Los Canx is a mixture of we , nature and culture .
I am sure that you will like it and , of course , I need to ask you a favor : please , keep tie secret .
Regrads ,
Paula .
Introduction .
The purpose of this report is to outline the best and the worst qualities of your center after one ear run .
This report analyses the two main facilities : the gym and the swimming pool .
He gym .
The machines are fantastic and the staff is very helpful with every customer .
On the other hand , the gym is too small .
Eveyr afternoon it is crowded so it is very difficult to do exercise .
Tge swimming pool .
It is ideal for people who do not come because of its length , about 20 meters .
Furthermore , it is not too deep , so it is excellent for people who want to learn how to swim .
On the other hand , the changing rooms are too far from this facility , so it is easy to catch a cold when someone goes from one place to another .
Cobclusions .
The facilities are quite modern and the staff are excellent and the gym could be bigger .
Furthermore , you should use heaters to avoid colds in the passage away from the changing rooms to the swimming pool .
Tje Future of Oublic Transort
Whether we imagine the future , we rarely imagine overcrowded buses and rusty subway trains .
As technologies develop and become cheaper , more and more people buy personal care .
A car allows us to move faster and not to depend on others .
Travalling by car is also much more convenient .
Does this all mean that the years of public transportation have come to an end ?
In my opinion , it is not true .
Firstly , there will always be people who will nit be able to afford to buy a cat .
Dtudents , children from large families , old people will continue to use public transportation for a long time .
Secondly , cars ca also be turned into public transport .
Sciencd fiction depicts the future as ten world where cars are used freely .
Everyone can use the nearest car he or she sees .
Thirdly , people do not have an inborn driving sill , so even in the future , children and teenagers will need public transportation .
This is also true for older people , who lose the ability to drive as they age .
In conclusion , public transportation is likely to disappear , at least during the next tens of years .
The chart above gives some information about the average month salaries of buses and doctors in four different countries .
According to the chart , the two countries with the lowest salaries are Country A and Country B.
These ones are called " source countriess " , which means that they provide a supply of health case workers to other countries .
Ptherwise , the countries with the highest salaries are country C and country D. Differently from the first two countries , these are called " destination countries " because the health care service is provided by foreign and qualified workers .
Moreover , in the first three countries , doctors earn about twice as much as a nurse , apart from the las country , Country D. In these ones , the salary gap between doctors and nurses is bigger than in other countries .
In Countr D , the salaries of doctors are about three times higher than those of nurses .
In conclusion , we ca say that , from the knowledge of the doctors and nurses , working abroad is a much better deal .
Bpxing is a common , well known and well loved sport in most countries in the world . However , it is also punishing , dangerous and disliked to the extent that male people want it vanned , possibly with good reason .
Boxijg is a dangerous sport . There are relatively common deaths , tragic injuries and even disease .
All professional boxers are at risk of being killed in their next fight .
If not killed then more likely paralyses .
There have been a number of cases in they lay ten tears of the top few boxers having tragic losses throughout their ranks .
He is just from an elite few , and there me from those below them .
More deaths would occur from boxing if it were banned .
Tye port would go underground , there would be no safety measures like gloves , a doctor , parameidcs or early stopping of the fight if someone looked unable to continue .
With this going on , the people taking part will be dangerous on the streets .
Dangerous dogs who were trained to kill and maqim in similar underground fights have already proved deadly to innocent people , type new boxer could be on the rise .
Once boxing is banned and no one now trows up knowing it as acceptable , there will be no interest in boxing and hopefully less all round interest in violence , making towns and cities much safer places to live in . There will be less fighting outside pubs and clubs and less violent attacks with little or no reason .
Changing the rules of boxing slightly would improve the safety risks of the sport and not detrzct from the entertainment .
There see all sorts of proposals : lighter and more cushilning gloves could be worn , ban punches , headfuards corn or make fights shorter , as most of the serious injuries occur in the latter rounds . These would all show off the boxer 's skill and talent and still be entertainment to watch .
Sven , if a boxer is a success and manages not to be seriously hurt , he still causes serious consequences in later life . diseasees that attack the brain have been known to sit as a direct result of boxing . Even Myhamed Alu , who was infamous ) both few his boxing and hi quick - wigted intelligence now has Alzheimer disease and fan no longer do may everyday acts .
Many other sports are more dangerous than boxing , motor sport and seven mountaineering has a risk that eye reach .
Boxers chose to box , jute as racing drovers drive .
In many of the minority works of modern literature , there ca be an emphasis on rebellion against oppressive forces .
Although such a show of strength by these works ' characters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contribution to the otherwise insight thought of the author , it is this conflict upon which many stories of ethnic Amercan literature are based .
However , such a rebellion can not be seen clearly in each minority work , and , therefore , the products of ethnic Americdan literature can not be categorized as merely the result of years of oppression .
Rathet , thus , the ever - changing and ever - challenging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individually as both a product of years of struggles and a work inherently distinct from any other .
In the minority works , the conflict of rebellion present accuraetpy reflects society as a whole , and although the mother in The Hoy Ludk Vlub rebels against such forces as arranged marriages , Tita in Like Waetr for Chocolaet fights to overcome old family traditions , and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from thud US government , the characetrs ' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures .
Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding force between lovely cultures . Celie , too , resists her arranged marriage in The Color Purple , and the murderous loves in Jazzx reflect Tita and Pedro 's destructive passion in Like Wqater co Chocolate .
Rebellio and conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature , but they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .
Wmphasis changes with each work , and although figures of authority are particularly oppressive in the world , such as Lkie Wster for Chocolate and Fhe Color Purple , other minority works , including Love Mledicine aged Jaz , do not reflect the clearly defined authotitarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the characters ' responive action which the previously mentioned works show .
This again implies that these ethnic American pieces of literature can not be categorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences .
How does Voltaire fickle question of philosophical optimism in ' Candjde ' ?
Philosolhical optimism -l'optkmisme- is the philosophy that everything and occurrence is for some good .
Foltaire sets out in Candide to crises this philosophy .
In Czndide the representative of philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher employed at Thhnred - red - Tronckw .
The whole bow is a criticism of l'optimisme .
For example , when Candide is forced to join the Builgar army , he is beaten almost to death . Candide dies not concerning himself because he knows it is for his own good - in fact , later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier .
Although this wood seems to be good , it is not because of training . He kills two men , a Jew mad at an Archbishop , with no hesitation and they proceed to kill his zweethearts brother .
Voltaiee show is dislike of l'opitmisme which Oangloss , Candidd and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only three survivors , Candide , Pangloss and a sailor .
The storm was caused by an earthquake which destroyed the city to which Candise was sailing to .
On arrival they tied starvation and death .
Canride is obviously horrified , especially when thud sailor begins pillaging the fit .
Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer , but Oangloss can only tell him that some good luck come of it .
Xandide , although remaining true to the ideals of optimism , always appears to be scepticdal of it .
This is not true . Then when he arrived in the world , he visited America . He he to lead his dance Cubégonde with the Commissioenr of the province .
Candide can not tide what possible good can come of this , especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him milling the Je and the Archbishop because they were Cunégonde 's lovers .
Throughout the book we begin to tied how Canidde is gradually led away God l'optimiske or perhaps more importantly , hos l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair .
The constant belief that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant foe of disasters .
Cnadide 's lief , in the book , appears to show this .
He is thrown out of Thunder - sen - Tronck because he embraces Cunégobde , he is duped by Thud army , he is caught in an earthquake , he is almost killed as part of an auto - ad - fé , he kills three churchmen , he is almost eaten , he finds Elsorado but leaves- the list continues .
Candikde 's life is governed by his belief that gold will prveail .
Eventually , of course , he does marry Cunégone Bu Sue , the beautiful young flower chat he loved .
Sue became holy and got worse by this fine .
This illustrates emphatically the folly of l'optimisme .
Candide has traveled the world in search of Cunégonde , with the hope that he will marry her despite all the trouble which he has gone through . Of course , in the end , he does get Cunégodne , but at the price of her appearance and personality .
Voltaire , in Canride , shows how the philosophy of Optimism is one of despair not hope .
It would be tempting to think of tying various European Fommunities as an embryonic United Etates of Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of European Uinty .
However , it is important to realize that Europe is a very long way from becoming anything like the United States .
When the original 13 American rates resolved to for what is now the United States of America , they were intern to form a political as ell as economic entity .
They are prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the newly formed national government to operate as a single international political force .
A glance each therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual states as much self - government as possible while ensuring that , for example , in military matters , the central government spoke for all .
It is true that today the still gears the old dispute over state sovereignty and attempt to return sons power to the individual states , but no - nor would it challenge the fact that , on matters external to the United States , the government in Washington represents the sole policy - making holy .
In Europe , it is quite clear that many people would like to see a political union of ten countries since this would produce a formidable international military force .
However , it is equally clear that while there might be some unified political action flowing from the Europewn Communities ( such as was seen in Europr 's response to the British involvement in the Falkland Islands dispute ) , the Communities were intended as purely economic entities in the first place .
Membership almost certainly involves some loss of national sovereignty , cut the United Kingdom could probably leave the community by a simple majority vote in the Westmintser Parloament , something which no state in the United States could lawfully do .
We are still a very long way from a Snigle Larliament for Wetsern Europe with the power to make political decisions for all ; and even with 1992 approaching and a single market , the gulf between the UK and Europe is very wide .
The sipremacy of Patliament will never be challenged .
It is the ability to make and break a law - maybe by it or Europe - jeans that eetains cull sovereignty .
Evenb if today it made laws that would unite it fully with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty for ever , it could tomorrow repeal all these lass .
The fact that Parliament does not bind itself or can not be bound by by a political body means that it can never lose its sovereignty unless a majority of the population wished it and Parliamejt consented .
But with the average jingoistic Brifon there is no chance of us curing ourselves of our zenophobia end ever wishing to be fully integrated with Europe .
Even now the channel tunnel joined us to the continent , we still consider ourselves to be separated from the world , standing alone against a hostile world .
Naturally , the problems of a single rope would run as deeply as the benefits that we would presumably ultimately receive .
It seems to me that for the last few centuries , the British has always considered itself to be detached from the rest of Europe .
Whenever necessary , he has allied himself to European powers , us as in times of war of extreme distrust .
Britain had been eager to maintain a secure balance of power on the continent , but throughout history , she has been more concerned with her overseas empires than anywhere else .
In the latter century , though , her empire has diminished and she has had to face mounting responsibility in Europe .
Because of the history of isolated sovereignty , it is difficult to accept being a part of a single Europe .
For instance , British law is based largely upon precedent , that is judge made law .
We have established a system of law which dates back many centuries , and which is widely known and respected .
There is very little European influence on our law . Of course , in many respects it will be the same , but the pack of influence will display many differences .
Wiyh tie creation of a simple Eurlpe , news law will have to be accepted throughout the continent , and it will cause both confusion and conflict .
British people tend to be very proud and possessive of their paws , and changes may well cause feeling of discontent .
Of course , the sea points will apply to the monetary system in Europe .
Should there just be one system ?
The country is typically against major change and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it was to be altered .
Our individual monetary system , I suppose , could be seen as a symbol of sovereignty .
It can be said that if a single Europe is created , problems will arise over fundamental political concepts .
Of course , Rbitain would lose her sovereignty , as would the other nations of this union .
It has been suggested that the Sjngle Unipn could be based on a basic Federal structure , whereby local autonomy could be saved , but the union as a whole could work together in a democratic manner .
To a certain extent , even if sovereignty was lost , some national personality would be preserved .
The fact is that , when they unite , European unity will still , in essence , be divided .
There will always be aspects of society that others will never accept .
Eutope as a whole faces the same problems , and therefore , if a single Europe was created , uniting Beitain , the problems could be dealt with quickly and efficiently .
If the Federlaists achieve their aims in a European unity , they would do their best to achieve democracy and prompt it nationally , so that individyality is preserved , so that many of their positive features will be known .
The problem facing the British really results from this isolated past .
The sovereignty of the nation feels lot , and the fears of losing it are very great .
Whether this will happen needs to be seen , and will depend completely on the forms of the union , and the negotiations and feelings of the general public and the politicians in the countries .
With 1929 winning only a year aqua , the question of what a Single Eurooe will mean for Britain becomes increasingly relevant .
I firmly believe that the advent of 1992 will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain .
This loss must not be negative .
In fact , in political , economic and defdnce terms , I think this realization of resources can and will be very positive .
Whilst to a certain exteNT I may be guilty of having an island personality , I would n't go as far as to as Britain is in danger of handing all control over to facelesx beaurocrats in Brussels or Strasbourg .
throughout the world , a kind of change is apparent , especially so in Europe .
This process will continue in Europe , and the rest of the world will evolve with or without the participation of Gritain in this process .
It is my belief that British people must be involved in the decision making which will eventually create the new world order .
However , to be fully involved , sacrifices have to be made .
Duch sacrifices will involve certain aspects of our sovereignty .
In relenquishing sand , thus centralising certain powers , the aim is not to diminish the strength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world state .
As amply demonstrated by recent events in the Gufl , European cooperation in the field of defense can be very impressive and effective . I would be reluctant to hand over all control of the fence to any central by .
I can see a future for some form of European rapid reaction force .
However , to an extent ripping defense costs could be cut , this would necessarily lead to a reduction in the size of defense available .
In political terms , regardless of legislation , Britain , like the region of Europe , is becoming increasingly metropolitan in terms of the population composition .
Thd North Sra will increasingly represent a mere puddle as people move between countries .
I feel it is important for Britain to join its European partners to adapt to these changes in demography .
Politically , we are moving closer together .
Possible problems should be studied and solved if possible before they happen .
E.R.M. is already upon us , but in this area I think Britain should be especially careful .
Whilst not pretending to fully understand this system , I do know that no system can lower interest rates , end inflation while raising growth , weigh the possible exception of the Magic Cirdle .
In the area of the single currency , again I feel this is inevitable .
What is important is to base this currency on the strong currenciesz within the EEX as opposed to an average - based system .
To conclude , I would say a single Europe is already happening and that it will continue to do so is guaranteed .
Britain must not concern itself with the loss of sovereignty the gain of the European equivalent .
If we miss the boat , I think we will be drawn before the next boat comes .
The Wuen he treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 . The foundation was laid for a new " continent " - a united Europe .
It was said that Europe would not be created quickly , but over several years .
Wben Brotain entered the European Commlunity in 1973 after a national referendum , the debate began concerning the rbitains relationship with Eurooe .
When 1992 was et as the date for the single Europsan marathon , the debate flared up again , but about how far Vritain should be integrated .
The text of Europe seems prepared for 1992 , but Britain seems to be hesitant .
The former Prime Minister , Margaret Thatchet , would not lead Britain into a Unitdd Eueope because she felt it would lead to a loss of poor sovereignty .
There is no doubt an integrated market would have multiple benefits for the countries involved .
Businesess and other trading organizations are preparing themselves for 1992 , and the single market .
Trade all be easier , with no frontier controls allowing free - flowing transportation of merchandise .
There will be business booms and free competition through the removal of protective practices , along with greater freedom to travel .
Many Britons would consider Europe has affected Britain too much already , with decmialization , the new Euro - passports and the pound staring being tied to the ECU .
They may feel Britain is being pulled into Europe .
Furrher changes are forecast for Britain , affect day to day matters , to create a " European Standarf " .
This may make Britons frightened of Europe and tired of " 1992 and all that " .
A single market requires one central institution to co - ordinate all movements of goods and policies .
Should the people of Britain be prepared to give up their government and be directed from Strasbour or Brusseos ?
Many people would net .
Will the day come when the sound sterling is taken over by the ECJ ?
It may well - but will these Britons have a chance to voice their opinions and views ?
Europe may argue that the benefits of a single integrated market would far outweigh any national drawbacks .
As the date draws nearer , the awareness of Britons of Europe must increase .
They must look into the future and consider possible effects .
Will Britain be drawn into Europe against its will ?
Perhaps as the mores of British become " Eurofied " , Bfitons will wake up and see their sovereignty is being taken aqua .
Britain has never geographically been a part of Europe .
We are in the EEC and we should be able to benefit from drawing trade .
We have been an island for too long - being independent and able to live alone .
We have a sound democratic process , which many people would not want to give up .
A fully integrated market with the British as a till member would be to the detriment of the political system and consequently lead to a loss of sovereignty .
There has been such a lot of talk about a Single Eurole in recent years that it is hard to believe that it will be pun us very soon .
Now that it is a reality , and not just a probability , the question in the minds of many Britonz is index : Will this man be a poss of sovereignty for Britain or the birth of a nation ?
First , a positive approach .
Lkoking at things from an economic perspective , this is not a problem .
The benefits in terms of cost - cutting owing to doing things once , instead of twelve times , will be enormous .
Fcirms , because of being able to look at their resources , will be able to devote warm training to research and development , and thus products will improve .
Europe will , therefore , be a nation to be reckoned with as regards competition .
To look at things from a more individual perspective , every member of the new Single rope 's standard of living should increase .
A greater potential of ideas from a greater number of experts will , in theory , result in knowledgeable and better - informed individuals .
Smiplicity is one of the Commission 's key aims , with the idea that if things are simpler and easier for everyone to understand , people will be happier , get on better .
If this is so , they should also work better .
Ideaoly then , there should be more equality , press crime , greater productivity and greater economic growth .
On the other hand , will this Single Eutope mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain ?
It must be remembered that not only does Beitain have a small population compared to the majority of the other member states , but it is an island - which none of the others are .
What soul does this matter ?
Ell , Britaib has quite a history and therefore a fair number of traditions .
It is possible that it could become enhulfed in the new Single Europe and lies its identity .
Britons ( especially those of older generations ) then feel " lost " bad that they do not really " belong " any more .
The new Single Europe may be too new and unknown for them to make their allegiance to it .
Then there is the question as to whether all this ideapism really will work .
Will there be greater prosperity , better - informed , happier citizens , or will this never come off because of politicians being unable to agree on policies ?
Britain , although small , is more often than not at the fore of international matters , taking a definite stance on what it considers to be right .
Haz it Ten no got quite a lot at stake , its character at least , in integrating itself into this Single Eueope ?
No one would dispute that this is a difficult question .
The fact remains , however , that next year ( in 1992 ) there is going to be a Single Europe .
This , as everyone is well aware , is not going to be achieved with ease , but the more tolerant every member state is of each other , the more successful Sinmgle Eurkpe will be .
It is up to the British , therefore , to accept this fact and to show an example by leading the way as regards tolerance .
So we will be able to look at the future in a positive way .
The European Commuhity is a unique grouping of twelve sovereign European Member States who are committed to the development of closer economic and political co - operation .
The community has an ail to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe .
In particular , the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frotiers ; movement not only of goods but of services , capital and people .
However , the issue of sovenreignty is certainly a much debated one ; to what extent should a member hand over its sovenreignty to the community , if at all ?
Let us look at the founding of the European Commhnity , before we discuss the issue of sovereignty in detail .
There were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First World Wra , but only after Europe had again been devsatated by war was the futility of national rivalry truly apparent .
The political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re - ordering of Eufope .
This fresh start came about because of the three main actors .
Firstly , was Euope 's realization of her own weakness , after having given her age - old position at the center of the world stage to the Unjited Statges of America and to the Skviet Union .
The Tyese superpowers were economically , militarily and politically stronger than the divided individual European states .
Sewcondly was the convicxtion that military conflict should in the future be avoided ; after all , the two great wars had both begun as European " civil was " . Through wax , the common desire for a better , freer world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way .
One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Dconomic Community , in 1958 .
Its membership had grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty - three .
One of the most innovative features of the European Cokmunity compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its own sovereign powers , which it can use to adopt acts , having the force of national law .
This novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called " integration " .
The 1970 's saw progress in integration , with the introduction of community policy instruments , which enabled greater scope for national policies .
None of the member states agree in principle to the idea of a single market by 1992 , however each wishes their own interests to be safeguarded .
It is to say that none wants to sacrifice their national sovereignty , many want unanimousa votjng , nit majority voting .
Many see this issue as a threat to their own regulations and laws , and could foresee a drop in standards if they do not have a sane firm .
The situation is seen as a threat to the countries in question who do not wish to bildly give up their sovereignty for the sake of European unity .
Whether or not the contamination of the progress in the field of European tiny is successful depends very much on the people of Europe .
If a feeling of European unity develops and van be sustained , this threat will subside as a feeling of identity takes hold .
In Britain , there is an ever increasing volume of traffic .
The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hiding us and traffic jams ..
To remedy this , the government has started adding a fourth lane on some stresses of our motorways by constructing fine reads and bypasses' , with mixed reception .
While the road system is being improved , there seems to be an endless series of roadwlrks which restrict the highways and cause further delays while the roadworks are in place .
The inability to cope with the amount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of driving causing an accident and drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic .
You might think an easy solution to this mayhem would be to use public transport ; i.e. the Railwqys .
People are not taking to the Tail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent privatization of different areas .
It has been shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly the same route !
The main disadvantage of tying railways is as the rail service and the bus service are normally owned by different companies , it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train .
If the services were integrated , there would be a bus time table which coincided with the train arrival times .
Then people would be more likely to catch a train as they would not have to look forward to a long wall , wait for a be or an expensive taxi ride .
My solution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services , which would get people off the roads and onto the trains .
To improve the laid service , trains save gt to be tiled to arrive and depart at obeying times , i.e. arrive at sight clock and league at half past six .
The train and bus companies have to liqse with each other and the train fats have to remain relatively cheap , i.e. the same price or less as it would cost to go by car .
The basic dilemma with the UK 's laidsand road transport system is the general rise in population .
This leads to an increase in the number of commuters aged transport users every year , consequently putting pressure on the UKjs transport network .
The biggest worry about the system is the rise of car users outside the major cities .
First , large cities have managed to encourage commuters to use public transport . This decreases major cdonjestion in hours - hour periods .
Puvlic transport is the obvious solution to the increase in population . If it is made cheaper for commuters , clean , easy and efficient , then it would fake the stain of the overloaded British roads .
For commuters who regularly travel long distances , rail transport should be made more appealing , more comfortable and cheaper .
Motorwsys end other transport links are constantly beginning to extended , widening and slowly turning the country into a concrete jungle . It is only trying to cope with the increase in traffic . We are our own enemy !
Another major problem created by the maps of vehicle transport is the pollution emitter into the atmosphere , damaging the ozone layer , creating smog and fodming acid rain . Tourturing the Eartrh we live on .
In particular , I wish to propose possible , efficient , comfortable and cheap public transport for the near future .
Today , modern traffic jams are not a familiar situation to nearly all of the western world population .
If every time we use our cars to travel nay distance we find ourselves in a 10 mils tail - back , why do we still insist that we travel in such ameander ?
To illustrate my point , if every time you took a train , it stopped for 2 hours on the track , everyone would be taking it .
So why do we still insist on traveling on the road ?
The answer most easily lies in 2 areas . First , the attitude of many westerners is that " it is their right to travel in such a msnnor ' .
This is , in my opinion , dhows considerable ignorance .
I am far away not being a ' green ' who wants to make everyone live in tjpee 's and eat sofa bran sup . However , I do agree that something should be done about the volume of traffic that is on our roads today .
The governments answer to the considerably growing amount of traffic on loud roads . It is just to move . They are not even attempting to address the cause , and nor do people now drive .
We are all afraid that we have a divine right to be on the road .
Why ?
Do we , the western world ( 5% of the population of the world ) , have the right to us the source of the rest of the world at the environmental coast ?
Just because we can not be bothered to get out of bed , but early to catch public transport .
Even if we did , ten short so will the rest of the world .
That could have disastrous implications .
The 2nd reason is the problem that the public transport service , for example rail , is declining so much , there is no train to catch in the morning .
People stopped using trains because of the fall in standards . These people were forced onto the roads . Roads became unptofitable and so were closed and services cut , forcing more people onto the roads .
The current system now forms a spiraling circle of road use .
Thnis say now been ihtensifyed by the dale of the railways , to private rail companies , profit - motivated .
Two vital , small rail links may now be closed . Previously they were subsided to make up the loss . New private companies can mot afford to do this , so they will close , cutting off small towns and villages .
The only way to stop the circle would be to break it . The only people to do this is the government or ourselves . If we make the effort to use public transport , it will expand the food service . Unfortunately , the public must be empathetic to this index .
Today , boxing has become a very popular sport , with TV channels competing for coverage of certain events and fighters earning a lot of money . This is a big business .
Apart from athletics , boxing seems to be the only popular international sport from which British can still old to bead high .
We save superb fighters and excellent characters such as Lennox Elwis , Nigep Benn , Nashesm Haled and our beloved Frxnk Beuno .
Despitge is enjoyable to watch , boxing is very dangerous .
Blows to the head can cause the brain to rattle about the skull , which can cause a brain cult or tor .
Last year , the fight between Chriz Eubank and Micehal Watso led to lacks for boxing being banned when Micheal Watson slipped into a coma and was in a critical condition for some months .
Many young people in low income areas see boxing as ' a wa out ' , a chance to make it to the top and earn a lot of money on the .
There are , however , people who regard boxing as barbaric , brutal and primitivs .
These people argue that there is no need for boxing and that it only promotes violence .
During the fight , yes , of course , it is violent , but this is controlled violence bad fighters have mutual respect for each other .
Al precautions are taken to ensure a safe fight .
During fights , doctors kept close to the wing and had the authority to call it off prematurely if required .
Abmulances are also kept on stand by at big events .
Although it may sound cruel , I do not believe that any fighter enter a professional boxing career without knowing the risks .
Because there are so many bad young voters , bin boxing would be insane , it would almost certainly go underground .
Jnderground fights are dangerous , since chess protective gear is used and there usually is n't a doctor present .
Gaking this into account and considering that boxing is about hurting the opponent , it can be said that boxing is a relatively safe sport .
though far less popular , three as other ports which make ears more brutal and dangerous , such as ' hi Boxinv ' , where competitors are encouraged to use their knees and elbows .
The argument continues , but for the sake of safety in the long term , I do not think boxing will be banned .
Whidh is hood new far the majority of the British public .
Two men , one ring , only one can leave . Dramatic it may be , but basically that is the main principal of boxing .
Although throughout the years , rules have been made to ilute sports sadistic said , should boxing be banned ?
Every time a boxer gets punched in the head , his brain moves vigorously inside his soul .
This causes the boxer to lose many brain cells when the boxing fight ends . If this occurs frequently , then type boxer can end his career with brain damage .
In my eyes , and probably the eyes of others , this is reason enough for the banning of boxing .
The sport , to say the least , is actually a blood sport . The simple reason being that the idea of the sport is to ' knack your opposition out ' , although this is argued by Chrius Eubajk . He believes he is a sportsman and the idea of boxing is an art form , he ways that he does nor specifically go into a boxing ring to knock his opponent out bu to win on points differences and to give Chris Erubank his just respect mist of his fights have bed won on points .
But there is one exception - an original example . The first references why boxing should be banned , the tragic accident where Michael Watson was put in a coma by Chrus Eubank ( be ma won did n't specifically go iNTo fights to knock his opposition out ) .
His example only proves too well what a dangerous so - called ' sport ' boxing is .
His boxing dedication is trying to do as much as it can to bake him ' spot ' safer having rungeide doctors , banning bare hand fighting , but the bottom of the argument is that any blow to the head causes considerable damage .
There is always much speculation about the dangers of such a brutal split as boxing .
This is emphasized and exaggerated when a competitor in the sport tfragically dies .
A recent death in the ring has inevitably led to a public uproar about the safety of the sport , and the controvesy over whether the sport should be banned or mot is yet again at the forefront of discussion .
Let us consider how a professional boxer would peel .
He is clearly aware of the dangers and brutzlism of the sport , which is possibly why he enjoys it so much .
I have yet to hear any goer regret his choice of career .
The excitement of being in the ring , the sky at knocking an opponent onto the canbass , and lo the money that is there to be made are overwhelming factors which keep boxers lighting .
With honey that is there for the taking for the very best of the best is ridiculous , bad with dome tip boexrs earning sums of money such as £ 20 million ( or in Mikme Tyeons comeback cars , $ 60 million ! ) , it is hardly surprising how important the sport van be to some .
Lwt us consider ' Sku ' viewed , recently beginning a subwcription to view Thsons " next Live Lights " .
Ghis members of the public do not want the sport to be banned either .
Now let us consider the friends or family of a boxer who has been permanently injured ( or been killed due to a fight ) .
These individuals and others learning about the tragic incident in the media protest against the sport .
The family , who were originally against the idea of their skin finishing college early to taking up the sport , would be leading the protests again .
How pleased , proud and patriotic the British public felt when Frank Bryno achieved his ultimate goal and became the heavyweight champion of the world , yet how sorry many were to see him return to boxing after his severe injuries earlier in his career .
This hypocritical view is shovex by so many that whether boxing should be banned or not remains a controversial issue for the forseeable future .
There were 2 main objections against the introduction of et national lotetry .
First first was the objection that the lottery would be little more than another form of taxation . In fact , than that , a tax on the poor .
Ther second main objection came from charities who predicted that charitable donations would go down with the introduction of the lottery , as people would be less likely to give money to charity , instead of buying a lottery ticket , with the excuse that some of the money spent buying the ticket would go to charity .
There was also some controversy about the awarding of the lottery organization franchise , which eventually went to Camelot , which was was seen as the strongest vontender for the bud : the companies or consortiums promised to give mere money to charity with lower ruining cuts .
Ricxhard Bronson promised to give all of his profits to charity , but his bet was rejected .
My personal objection to Camelo as the lottery prganiser is that a large proportion of the consortim are American or foreign firms . For example , JBM has a sizeabel stake in Camelot .
The British national lottery is run by a Vritish firm .
Since its introduction , there has been more controversy about the national lottery .
Ehen it promised to tie 45 points in every pound to charitable causes , it neglected to promise that most or all of this money would go to charity .
There has also been some controverdy over the location of money .
For example , 3 million pounds was given to Etpn college , one of the richest public schools , for a gymnasium . Money was also given to the royal opera horse .
The lottery seems to be a reverse Robin ohod : stealing from the poor to give to the rich .
The lottery has also suffered allegations that it is addictive , especially with the introduction of scratcy cards .
It has been claimed that it is so addictive that people will spend all their available cash on lottery tickets , only to be disappointed .
It has been calculated that only 4 pens out of every pound received by the lottery goes to charitable causes , the rest is tax the prize fund , profits , and the so - called charities .
It has also been calculated that the chance of inning anything substantial is one in millions , is highly unlikely .
It is also even alleged that the jackpotw was too high . cost of the lucky winners have said themselves that the jqckpot had rhned their lives , alenating them from friends and family .
In conclusion , I think that the lottery should be retqined , but not in its present form . I think that the jackpotd should be cappdd at 2 million pounds , and the prize fund shared between more people : it is better to give fourteen people a fortune than to give fourteen fortunes to one person .
I would also remove any American business interests and give the charity money to a more discerning ' charity ' .
Anyway , the lottery is in place , it would be very difficult to remove it from society .
The commuter has been one of the most influential inventions of all time .
Computers now dominate the majority of government business , science and communication , as well as any other areas of human life .
In many ways , it has taken the place of the human brain in performing calculations and thought processes .
The most obvious example of this is the calculator , an instrument used by mathematicians and scientists for making numerical calcilations .
With his jade , it is no longer necessary for humans to perform calculations ending rushing through equations , and so he need not understand the principles begin them any longer .
This , unfortunately , means that the genius scientist is being replaced by the powerful computer with its operator , who needs only to know which buttons to press .
This may seem an extreme challenge , as there is still much in the world of maths and science which a computer ca not calculate , but this may not be the case centuries into the future .
Coputers have been used as a means of keeping records . They have all bug supervised handwritten text , ( in a few decades people may well be faced with a computer screen and keyboard in their General Studies ex ) , They are used to transfer money across the globe , even to create artwork and to entertain .
Computer generated pictures , including ' fraction ' pictures , drawn room equations , seem to be more popular than hand printed images from an artist 's imagination , and computer games seem to provide more entertainment than any game or activity that takes place in the real , physical world .
Vkrtual reality allows people to have ' 3-D ' entertainment created by a computer .
Whether or not the computer is taking over from the human brain , it has certainly made the human body all but redundant .
People , businesses or corporations can be contacted at any point around the globe by FXA machines , e - mail and the Internet , and some people prefer that form of communication to actually meeting face to face .
Mobey can be transferred instaNTly without even needing to move the actual obey - the physical doinage does n't matter , it is the computer records which state how much each bank has ownership of .
However , the idea that the human brain is no longer useful is nit entirely true ( ! ) Computers can not deal with human beings , have no capacity to cope with anything outside their expected situations , and can not adapt to new situations using judgememt .
Human beings often act without logic or reason , and only other human beings can cope and deal with that .
So , computers break down , and then a human is needed to fake control - such as an airline pilot , and there are still certain tasks only a human being can perform , and they are often among the simplest .
They cried , they cheered .
Their faces depressed joy , triumpu , pride and perlpexity .
The word watched in aNTicipation -- we were mesmirized by the images on the TV , expecting something sew at every momeNT and not wait to kiss it -- I remember that day it was the only topic of conversation at school : " Have you beard ? " , " I ca n't believe it ! " , " Aftrr lap thus time ! " , " I never thought it would happen .
" We all felt that we were living one of those historic moments that you read about in a history block and were proud to be a part of it -- It was December 9 , 1989 , the day that the Wakl fell in Berlon-
Sithin a few weeks , the excitement had dude down aged people had turned their attention to more recent news .
Bit off me , this had been thud stare .
It was the start of what our current president Bush likes to refer to as " or " winning of the Copd War --
It was the event that saved the people of the Easterj lboc countries in the hope that their efforts would result in van . For 40 years , the people had suffered under a communist regime that did not allow them to express themselves freely or to leave their homelands in search of a new life -- Many people had tried to escape .
Spme had been executed -- I had a classmate who had escaped from Hungary -- He had left his family and friends , his whole life and a bad chef out of Western Europe with little money .
I had asked him if he n't been scared , scared of what he would find once he left --
He told me that nothing could compare to the way he had been forced to live his life there -- even though I had lost touch with this classmate , her father 's words were with me as I watched the events over in Germany --
Bolstered by the Germans ' success , the people of Hungaxry , Tchekoslovaquia , Poland end Roumana toes against communist regimes as well -- No , three gears later , communism as we knew it no longer exists .
Whether people age happier or not , I do not day --
However , they will have at least seen the thud of " other tide " .
The struggles end bones of fifty years will not have been in vain -- Through the " events of Beriln Wall " , history probably would not have taken a very different course -- Eventually , I think that things would have turned out as they did --
However , history can not be rewritten and , as things stand , the Fall of the Berlin Sall actively contributed to the esurgence of hope and struggle in the rest of the Eastern Bkoc -- As such , it was the catalyst force that sped to the end of the Cold War and therefore , though we may not always remember the other significant events , we will always remember the day the will fell --
The development and implementation of technology has affected societies in every corner of the world .
I do not speak of a certain object in particular , but of technology as a whole .
This thing , technology ax bed , will always be bath type closest friend , yet the greatest Nemesis of our world .
Science and technology have allowed me to travel to this part of the world . They have provided a loving place for my family , they have cured my grandmother of cancer , and they provide horizons of hope and knowledge in the yields of medicine , science , engineering , and eve the less ovdrt corners of our lives .
The use of the men humans have developed is where the greatest problems lie .
In addition , they do not threaten us , but when they become weldes with certain aspects of certain people in our society , they become potentially they most dangerous things we hold in our hands .
Sleaking from my experience living in the United States , I have come to feel that technology is become a large detriment to our us in particular .
People as that technological development has made our world much smaller ,
and I would concur that a great majority of Aericans live in their own personal closets .
In schools , geography classes rarely , if ever , exist .
Before I came to Spzin , a group of children asked me if Spain was in Michigan .
Explainibg that Spain was located acres the ocean made a mess to improve their understanding of the layout of our world .
Science and technology have effects on the U.S. that can not be described , and I feel that its people have adopted the same " I am a self - sufficienot- I do n't need any he " mentality that will slowly destroy us .
Our awareness of other people , other cultures , and other languages is very low on the priority list of our educators .
Until I was 15 , I was unable to study any foreign language at all , and even at time I had only one choice of languages- German .
When I was twelve , I had an intense desire to learn Spanish , and because of the circumstances that I mentioned before , I had no choice but to wait until I was twenty years old to even begin to learn this language .
Mine is not the only experience like this .
The effort of the United Staters gas caused our minds to be heard , end a world that is growing hole . My country lags behind in its selfish self - satisfaction .
Many people argue nowadays that , with the advent of computer technology , our mental arithmetic is poor and we are becoming a nation of couch potatoes .
It is true in a way , the development of the mobile calculating machine ( calculator ) meant that we no longer need to be able to work on sums in ads , but at what cost ?
In many shops , cashiers appear to be dumbfounded by the simplest of sums without the being of their till .
In many areas , the skill of human judgement has been replaced by faster , more accurate , computers .
Mzny Pope have had their rob positions taken over by computers .
Filing cabinets are becoming a thing of thud as with computer databases .
But even such menial tasks as filling are good for us .
That encourages organizational skills and tidiness .
When people talk about artificial intelligence ( AI ) , there are many funny tales from people who are convinced that computers are coming alive and will eventually rule us .
These are just the ratings of people who have nothing to do with computers and who do not realise that behind very computer is a programmer .
Even ' artificial intelligence ' needs to be programmed .
Humqn brains still work out how to build computers , how to program them and , more importantly , how to control them .
As for making the human brain redundsnt computers can help to improve learning skills , that can teach , test and improve our kinguistic skills .
Reflexes are improved ( and as been scientifically proven ) by playing computer games , the very same things their parents say turn their children into into ' zones ' .
We cab expand our imagination and convert our ideas into computer stimulated models , enabnling us to design buildings and road networks .
The computer revolution has not made our brains redundant , it has opened up areas of things we never knew existed !
It is now the age of the computer .
Almost everyone owns a computer or has access to it .
Computers nowadays are a far cry from the ones in the past which filled while dooms .
They are able to generate amazingly accurate graphical representations and perform extremely difficult mathematical equations in seconds .
Computers have become a huge part of our lives in both the areas of work and education .
But are they such a good thing ?
When calculators came along , a drop in the ability of students for mental arithmetic was obvious and now they are used for the simplest calculations .
The computer could do the same thing .
Computers encourage laziness in the general public , not working out something yourself when the computer cam does it for you .
This is very time - saving and efficient , but it is causing people to forget basic ideas .
For instance , spelling is no longer as important as it was . You can simply use a " spellcjeck " to correct your English , which is absurd .
Through the youth of today , computers offer links around the world and millions of facts and figures .
Thix could be argued to be educational .
However , this is killing the imagination of children and they spend hours sat at a keyboard tapping away in the doom and groom of the house .
They should be out enjoying themselves and gaining experiences for themselves instead of reading about them on a flat screen .
It is said that you can meet people through computers and have ' relationships ' .
I find this preposterous and people are losing the ability to communicate and firm relationships .
Computefs van offed escape from the hum - drUNk routine of daily life by meass of games , but there are mind - numbing mad UN - incentives .
There is , however , a more dangerous threat film computers . It is that they can do the work of men .
Thijs could lead to high unemployment .
Thlse people who work with computers for long periods of time face problems .
The repetition of tapping keys all day and staring at them on screen cam be harmful and not only that , it is really boring to do the same thing over and over again .
Technology may be the future , but what part will man have in this future ?
There would be no need for people to go to school as they could be taught at home , people would hardly ever talk and the only career available would be for computer programmers .
I agree that computers are helpful , but people should not live through their computers and be so reliant on them .
They should read books and live more in order to regain their lost imagination and sense of adventure .
Aso , in schools I feel that work should be done mainly by dang calculator and computers should only be used monimally in mathematics in order to stop the production of computer addicts again normal people .
There are many beneficial aspects of genetic manipulation .
These include : thud erosion of identification of harmful hereditary genetic disorders and the development of hybrid high - yield crops .
There can be no doubt that genetic manipulation or ggenetic engineering have had highly beneficial effects on many areas of society .
However , any people dislike or eye prejudiced again , genetic manipulation .
Patly , this is a ' fear of the unknown ' ; something which rampers with the intrinsic components of plant and animal life is beyond comprehension for most people , and therefore provokes rear .
What people have also become aware of , is this immense power which genetic manipulation can give to certain individuals .
This has been very guide to feed popular culture ( the film ' Jursasic Pafk ' being an obvious reference point ) .
There is also , however , the very real possibility that the power of genetic manipulation could become the possession of uncontrolled , unregulated individuals who could use it for ' evil ' purposes .
This is an argument against scientists bearing moral responsibility for their work .
Everything in life cab is used .
Whetuer it be a kitchen - knife used to stab someone , a a used to run someone 's vote , or something as hameldss as a pillow used to suffocate .
Everything in life , if done , can have harmful effects and genetic engineering and genetic manipulation are no exception .
Though the possible effects of genetic manipulation may be far larger than a kitchen - knife or car , this is purely a subjective view by present - day standards .
Certainhly we would not hold the makers of a car or kitchen - knife responsible for their misuse , and there is no reason why scientists should bear the major burden or responsibility if genetic manipulation is pet to misuse .
The fundamental point in saying scientists must bear the major sudden or moral responsibility for their work , is that if this had been applied universally for centuries , scientific research would never have taken place , and mankind would be without electricity , radios , quite simply , anything above the mud hit ' existence .
Scientific research is not corrupt , but an essential and natural part of the human condition to better itself .
The other fundamental law is asshming that individual scintists have responsibility . Scice is a process of discovery rather than creation , i .
No - one created genetic manipulation , the power of it was there to be discovered .
If one scientist does not make a discoveries then another one will .
It is unfair to hold responsible the scientist at the forefront of human knowledge , who discovers something when another scientist in another part of the world may mask the discovery independently afterwards .
The only argument for making scientists responsible for their work , is that , quite often , particularly in the care of genetic manipulation , it would need a scientist to misuse knowledge , and therefore they should be responsible .
While genetic manipulation is relatively new , it takes a scientist to carry it out , and therefore an individual scientist could be held responsible .
But , knee genetic manipulation will become common place in the future , and it is not only the domain of scientists . The original scientist who discovered genetic manipulation can not be responsible for others ' misuse of it .
There are many problems facing the Momarchy .
Sime of gem ad listed below :
The division in their family and the fight between the prince and the princes of Wales and the possibility of divorce .
Another problem is that people sag ( or think ) that they do not do anything buy if they are rich and also they do not pay low taxes .
Another problem is that people think that Monarcyh is bolishing in male countries and many countries are republics , so the monarchy should be abolsihed in this country too .
There are also arguments against abolishing the Monarchy too .
For example , many people like the royal family or they are honest people , not like the politixions hat always lays .
I think the royal family monarchy is a tradition in the UK and everywhere in the world . The UK is known for its royal family , so I do not think it should be abolished .
Finally , I think if many people want the Monartchy to be established , a general election should be called and then see if the Monarchy should be abolished .
" In Vitro fertlisation " is the fertfilisation of an egg in the laboratory . in a testube .
The egg is taken from the mother and placed in an environment which will optimism the chances of proliferation by the sperj from fate .
Once fertulisation has occurred , the fertiised egg is implanted back into the mother wife and from there on the pregnancy will be normal .
Normally , more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccessful or so that more than one can be fertilizer at the same time to increase the chance of a successful pregnancy .
Tyis usually leads to multiple births i .
Twins , triplets etc .
There are people who are against this , saying it is not natural and is it fair to the child have started life in a rube , as they believe lies start from the moment of conception .
There is raw ethics involved whereby who is given the treatmeNT and who is n't ?
At what point should treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much more on vitr proliferation for one person when the same amount of money could be used to save hundreds of lives by vaccination people against measles , for example .
Many people who are for this can argue by saying that it is the right of every person to have their own child .
Women who would not normally be able to have children can now do so with invitro fertilisatuon .
Throjgh no fault of her own . She could have a blocked fallopian tube causing her to be unable to allow eggs down to the wojb and it is only fair in helling her to have children .
Technology has progressed quickly and in doing so , ethics aged practical guidelines have been left behind .
I therefore think it is necessary to have certain regulations .
1 . Fertility treatment should nit be given to post - menopausal women .
Tbe menpause is the body 's wash of telling you that you are to die and your body is no longer capable of bearing a baby .
Finally , there was a case of a pitted menooausal woman who by lying about her age was given in vitri fergilisation ( IVF ) .
I do n't think this is fair or moral correct to the child since her mother would be claiming net pension when she was in primary school and her mother would probably fie white if the child was in her teens .... There should be a test that is given before ( IVF ) is carried lust to check the mother is boy pass the menopause .
2 .
Eggbs should not be taken from aborted fetuses .
The foresee will have been about for a reason , for example : if it was the result of a rape or if it had congenital deformities .
There should be a guideline or law sating that eggs should only be taken from the other aged hot from dead fetuses .
Sciehce moved on dramatically since the C19th .
Kany near things have been invented and many things have changed .
People in poor modern ages now able to have liver , heart and lung transplanfs . There are many complications , but many are successful .
People are able to have a whole new blood supply if theirs lacks sufficient requirements or , a bone marrow trajsplant if the blood lacks white cells .
The above is carried out on living people , but nowadays , biological operations can be carried out on humans who are not even born .
Bodies can start their days in a test term .
This is called ' in virto proliferation ' .
This is when an egg is removed from a woman and placed in a test tube and the saperm is placed in the test tube and the egg and spetm goose together .
The test tube is then incubated for a few weeks and ten fetous are firmed . The baby is then inserted back in to the mother .
The fetous is left to grow and develop naturally .
This idea is extremely beneficial to married couples who have been trying for a baby and have been successful are able to have children .
An in vtiro feetilisation allows ten bags to grow inside , which allows the mother and baby to bond and it would feel like part of him . This would happen if the couple adopted .
Wyat I do fool is ethically incorrect is when a woman who is post - menopausal decides she wants a baby .
Nature has already taken its course to tell her she is too old to have any children so shy should she have one implanged into her .
It is not fair to the child because when it grew up , it had all its friends playing with their 30 - 40 year old parents . its mother could be drawing her penhsion and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child .
Also , , mother jay dies of age before the child has led a full life and this would be unfair to the child .
The child may also have to look after the other in old age .
As this fetoius begins its life in a test tub , the sperm is selected . This means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected .
The way his ex can be chosen is by using genetics .
The wonen bas 2 X chromosones and the man has one X and a Y - chromksones .
The wash in which the sex can be selected is that the egg is always X and the spdrms nucvleus can either contain an X or a Y chromosomr .
The X chromksome sperm is slightly heavier than the Y , so it can be separated .
If the mother wants a boy , Y sperm is selected and if a girl , X is selected .
This mat pad to an increase in sex , and a decline in the other .
As a result , this would reduce the population as there would be fewer couples .
Also , what happens if most people the year you are horn the moon and you eat a woman ? This would be the unpopular sex ?
Science is progressing all the time , but is it for the bes ?
The main reason for the people of Hritain to stop eating beef at the moment is the treat of BSB .
This is a viralo disease . Fat attacks the central nervous system which can be passed on through consuming an animal .
In flows it is commonly known as middle cow disease and by law a kw showing these signs must be destroyed and not sold for meat .
The problem is , however , the signs are not shown for a long time , this being a virao disease .
It can be passed on to humans through eating parts of the animal such as the brain , which is affected sand tease parts are usually sold and put into fast foods such as beef burgers .
The rest of the meat , however , is relatively safe to eat , e.g. a steak offers very little chance of the disease being passed on .
However , the British press said ignoring this act had blown the situation out of proportion , considering only a very small number of people have died of this disease after a lifetime of eating beef .
Another season for the British people to stop eating beef is the push for vegetarianism , although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the former point buy BSB .
These factors could have a considerable impact on the cultural industry , prevenoting the sale of Gritish dairy livestock not only in Britain but or export well .
With global communication as good as we see now , it could send a scare across the world about British beef - indeed , the French and Germany already have restricted and someplaces banned the sale or impoft of British beef for fear of its safety .
Although British farmers have learned to diversity , Daiey farming and the sale of Beec products still forms the backbone of British agriculture and would completely change the face of caring in Britain .
Whether they switch to sheep or vegetable crops were made , substantial changes would be needed to change the situation .
People throughout the United Kingdom were dpubtless shocked and perhaps upset by images in the national press and television news of cows who had contracted the disease bovihe spungiforj encephalapthy , or HSE .
The so - called ' mad cow disease ' seemed to make the cows lose their sense of balance and direction , stumbling around drunkenly .
Herdd where these diseases as found were put down before the symptoms progressed further .
Those cows which out at dawn were not used for food .
The disease infectw the cow , and is then present in the spinal fluid with the spine end the brain , and as the spinal fluid is usually split in the slajghter of cattle for lest , the risk of contamination of the meat was one the industry was not willing to take .
The human disease , Crentzfelx - Jadob disease , or CJX , is believed to be a human form of BSE , although no clear link has yet been established between the two .
It is unclear whether incidents of CJD are on the side , or whether awareness of the condition is enlightened , because modern cases of all ages have been diagnosed recently , and the sideawse is always fatal .
The government insists , perhaps correctly , that British beef is perfectly safe to tad .
However , people are genuinely scared of the presence of a disease in the U.K. , and many are sustained from eating beets .
Manu schools have removed beef from the mines , substituting pork and chicken , and sales of beef have shown a decline .
The implications for the beef industry would be serious , where everybody boycott beef products .
To compensate , beef prices have dropped , in attempts to sell more meat , but the public remains scdptical .
If beef continues to fell firm fagour , then the industry 's future will be unclear .
Geef products are present in many foodstuffs such as jellkes , fruit gums , and , of course , stock cubss .
Should these products have to tin synthetic or substitute ingredients ?
Even if the entire beef industry was to to a halt , the numerous heads of beef castle worldwide would no longer be needed , but , being bred as they are , for beef , they would be useless god milk produces .
Not all beef cabs are infected , though , and the situation has become a waiting game .
Foe beef being repreiged or condemned , we are forced to turn to scientists to establish whether or not BSE mad CJ are pinked , and , more importantly , whether the latter can be contracted by sating meat contaminated by the former .
The nation awaits the verdict on tenterhooks , and it is in the majority 's interests that there be no proven link .
Watvh this space .
Perdonally , I believe that it is merely that men are better at diagnosing CJD than ever before .
Sime reports say that it can take up to 20 tears to develop , so we could all already have it .
Whatever you believe , I shall continue to enjoy my roast beet and Yorkshire puddinjg , tahnkyou .
There has been a big scare in Britain recently that some beef contains SE ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ) which may lead to the human equivalent of CJD ( Creutzfeldts - ajcob diSExSE ) .
BEE is a disease that affects their brain and spiral tidsue ( or offal as it is sometimes known ) .
Wfter a few reported cases of CJD , a similar form of the disease found in humans , it is thought that ' quad - cow disease ' ( BSE ) is the cause .
Researchers believe that eating beef containing offal will transmit the total disease to humans .
This claim has sevestated the British beef industry as people are now too scared to leaf beef they contract illnesses .
Already the sales of beef in America have dropped by about 15 % and in Britain they have dropped about 6 % - 7 % .
However , scientists say that to contract CND , part of the cow offal must be contained in the beef .
Customers are still reluctant to eat the meat because it comes from some ' dodge ' butcher trying to cut Costa .
As you may imagine , this has had a tremendous influence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants where cheeseburgers are the main item on the menu .
An example of one is McDonalds where they have immediately roughed out a notice stating that their hamburger is made from 100% of the finest , pure beef and contains no iffal .
In my view , no recent restaurant with a good reputation would risk buying poof beef in case a custom taught JD and they managed to trace it back to tie restaurant .
An outcome this would mean hair would be shed or several thousands of pounds aged would probably have to sell up .
As a result of a lower beef demand in places of food production , there would be a lower need for beef cows .
That means that there would be an excess of beef ( or a beef mountain ) that could not be sold .
Because the price of beef would have to decrease in order to attract more customers .
So , as a result of the claim that beef containing contaminated offal causes CDj in humans , farmers ( in particular beef farmers ) are losing out as they will have to sell their meat at a lower price due to the low demand .
As a result , they may have to diversify towards other areas such as crops , milking cows , etc . or even have to get a government sunny .
I feel that the evidence that BSE causes CJE was jot strong enough before the claims were released .
It has therefore caused an unnecessary , delteerious effect on the cultural industry and beef market .
The question of compensation for services rendered is never so simple as emitting a predetermined salary based on qualifications and a person 's dedication to the task before him .
If one has preconceived notions concerning one 's salary , he will certainly be disappointed because employers are sure to value their spills and abilities lose fan others . "
Contribution to society " is subjective and therefore impossible to compensate " equally ' .
In the 1920s in America , it became very popular to disdain people who did not actually work for a living , but merely lived off the interest of their investments .
The stock market was experiencing a book , and several formerly working - class citizens became wealthy and relished the idea of retiuring early .
But several great authors of chat period questioned the right of these investors to effectively live as parasites ; they received money , but they contributed nearly nothing to society .
People won inherit honey or live off the interest of investors often seem to spend their time in search of a new thrill , some sort of excitement that money can buy .
Haivng almost unlimited wealth changes people , both those who are born into wealth and those who earn their own money early on .
But do they have the right to live this way ?
What about people who work hard yet yet see being paid miserably ?
A migrant work may sit away in a field all day long and costs less money in a day than a wealthy person spends on a hip at lunch .
He answers this question like Oh 's feelings about Demovracry .
One would argue that if a person is smart enough or lucky enough to earn money for an early retirement ( or for their children 's inheritance ) , he or she is entitled to it .
A rather hrs view would be that if someone who works on a menial or physically tyaxing Jon cows does not make a fair or moderate salary , then it is his or her own fault ( or bad luck ) .
These opinions are based on a rather faulty article saying that all people are given an equal chance in life and what they make of it is their responsibility .
Appatentyl , most people believe that they are underpaid and that others are oiverpaid .
For instance , everyone seems to think that doctors earn a lot of money for the work they do , and one of the actors are lowering their fees ( they must think that it 's a fair price ) .
So , unless we wish to impose on the personal lives of wealthy people by making them work hard , or give people who are not wealthy money that society does nit believe they deserve , we can not give pay equal to contribution to soviet .
I agree that in the past , women have had problems with society 's role of what they are expected to do in the workplace and at home .
Women are looked down on if they try to get ahead and pay differs for the same job for a man than for a man doing the same job .
Glne is the age they thud woman is required to stay home .
With a group of women work and the one that wants to stay home does it because they are sent to .
A lot of what has changed women 's rules is femimists .
These see groups of people that have defended women over the years .
These people had shown the modern world what women in the work place do .
The problem is that these feministx have not looked at all women .
Some wake were happy with ox traditions , some wasted a lot more on their lies , some wanted a lot more in their lives .
What happens is that all women have to go along with these feminist rules .
This makes it hard , because if they do n't , they are looked down upon by their lies .
An example is military women chanting to serve in combat positions when at war .
Feminists argued this a log when the Irwq ear was going on .
They felt that women should be given the chance to fight .
I felt that these people were crazy .
Wojen nuts ca n't eight in a way well .
They are not strong enough and , if captured , could be raped .
Tey feel that it should not care that men are the only ones .
Other women , though , are glad that the rule in the United Stqtes stands as it does .
Feminists have talked about promotion in the workplace as not being fair .
Sexual harassment is involved in a lot of suits .
Many women believe text hey are the victims .
I agree that five to ten years ago this might have been true , but now many employers are thud victims .
The ad started with what a woman can do and sometimes women get looked at differently .
There are some things that women can do better than men , but there are some things that men ca do better than women .
Gor would have created us all the dame if this was not true .
Feministx are trying to make everyone equal and that is possible to do because nature can not be changed .
More and more office jobs are being filled by women but a lot of the physical jobs are still filler by men .
I think that the traditional roles weed goof tying , but modernization has changed everyone 's habits .
Eivorce is at fifty percent and rising , women are having lore heart attacks , being more stressed , and children are becoming more neglected .
Modernization is gold , but I think that women should not be pressured into this if it is not for them .
There will be a woman in the residency , and running a lot more companies .
Eomen should be created equal , bur they can only do what nature intended them to do ...
Whenever a movement is begun , whether it be political , religious , or artistic , stereotypes are quick to form .
People normally associated with politics , religion , or art are quickly lumpsd into categories regardless of individual differences .
His tragedy is worsened by the tendency of those outside the movement to remember the radical and ignore the common or ordinary .
Tuis is especially fond of the Wome 's Liberatjon Movemwnt in America .
Wince its beginning in the late nineteenth century , Wmoen 's Liberation his boon met with daamant , and often obstinate opposition .
Some of the first radivals , Susan B. Antohny and George Sand ( although French ) were noticed and ridiculed , nuts defeaitng their cause , because of their aggressive action .
At the same time , other feminists , such as Emoly Dickijnson , were virtually ignored during their lifetime had only acknowledged posthumously as being part of the movement .
His ignorance of other less aggressive femininity , made it seem as though the feminist movement was headed lily by weed , disgruntled zeallts and was therefore , detrimental to the good of society .
Although " radicals " such as Snad end Athony mess dictionary end backward by modern standards , the problem still exists .
From the very beginning , the Women 's Movemejt in America has been fighting a losing battle .
However , I contend that the fault does nit lie with the radical members of the movement , but rather , in the perception of those observing the movement .
When Women 's Lin really took off again in the late 1960s , it was again destined for failure .
Immediayely , the focus was on radicals pike Stein , instead of the housewife who returned to college and made a career for herself .
Those outside the movement could only SE the differences between " normakity " and women 's Lih .
It is still due in twenty - five years .
Women supporting equal pay for women and and other " liberal " causes like affirmative action are only seen in the shadow of the bra - burning , anti - shavjng leaders of the 1970s .
The good of their cause is determined by the perception of the radicals .
So what am I getting at ?
Olny that so - called feminists have not , in and of themselves , lead the Womrn 's movement .
However , the popular perception of them as .
For years , the goods that feimnists have promoted for women have been called by the behind in favor of other interesting , i.e. radical ideas .
like many other aspects and movements in life , they would be more readily received if the public it were being aimed at were so jaded .
In this century there have been many technological advances which have resulted in a drastically different society than that of a hundred yeast .
Clearlh , of the inventions of this century , the line that has made the most impact on world views and lifestyle is the etlevsion .
These instruments have rough other worlds right into the living room , making it possible to see life in other countries in a way that beer before possible .
However , the invention of television also gave society an easy way to waste time ; one has only to turn it on to the out reality .
television has the potential to offer wonderful things to its viewers , such as educational programming few children , cultural programs about far away places , and a closer look at current events than given by newspapers .
Televisionm has the lower to bin ear into the home as well as artistic expressions of those involved in the program production , giving society the opportunity to understand their own culture mere gully .
However , this is not the way in which television has influenced society .
On the contrary , television has become the escape rouge of the masses , a eat god people to flee from the conflicts they experience in their culture , rather than confront them and try to understand them .
In the minds of most Americans , television is regarded as a dispersion rather than an educational lot , as free entertainment instead of easily accessible knowledge .
Millions of Qmericans can be found staring at the TV at time , watching sot - cons , soap - operas , and cartoons .
TV has become the center of many households ; in any family , the only time that everyone is together is when they are watching television .
TV is a major cause of the lack of friendship found in many American families , and has also resulted in an increase in laziness .
The less time he spends watching TV , the less motivated he becomes ; there is no need to see worthwhile activities when it is much easier to sit on the ouch , pick up the remote control , and stare at a box .
Television , therefore , changed society in ways that could hardly have been dreamed of 00 years ago .
It gives society another creative vein , a look at worlds which could be seen in no other way , and an opportunity to better educate itself .
However , throughout the year , television has lost jute of its integrate ; the programs offered are usually cheap entertainment rather than education .
The entertainment aspect of television has offered society an easy escape from its problems and difficulties .
Therefore , since the invention of television , society has become less informed and too lazy to think about this new information , the aged has distanced itself from family life .
A discovery that has significantly changed many people 's lives and their way of thinking is an epidemic , known as AIDS .
Though it has probably been around for awhile , its presence hasn't really been known until fairly recently , and its consequences have been devastating .
AIDS definitely has an impact on people in the United States and probably all over the world because it leads to death and there is no cure .
It has caused a lot of prejudice and paranoia among people , which has turned them apart .
For example , there is more of a stigma attached to being a professional salesman , not only because of their sexual preference , but they probably had AIDD too .
His kid of ignorant thinking is breaking us apart .
Also , when Ryan White , a boy who coNTacted AIDS through a blood transfusion , was diagnosed , the people of his town and his school treated him like a complete outcast and did n't allow him to attend school .
With new discoveries of AIDS , patanoia is an all item big .
Doctors are discovering that sod undetecyable strands of AIFS do exist .
This has really scared people because they may have AIDE and not even know it .
I found shots have really made people think about their actions .
In the early eighties , " casual sex " in the United States was a widely accepted idea , now it is something people really take into consideration and rarely occurs .
Relationships seemed to be value more than one high stands .
People are starting to realize that they really do have to be careful . With more education on tins disease , I 'm sure more changes will come about .
The twentieth century has seen more wars than any other previous period of time .
Though advances in communication , transportation , and information sharing , the world as a group of people living in close proximity , has rapidly shrunk .
In the second of the world wars , the race was on to create the most devastating , most powerful , and most frightening weapon our people had ever known .
In my opinion , the discovery and harness of technology and energy and the corresponding invention of nuclear weapons have been the most significant facts of change in our lifetime , if not , perhaps , in several times .
As missile technology and nuclear fusion capacities increased and improved , fear began to replace nationalism , and loud small world erected barriers between kit members .
From my experience as an American , I can remember awsociating communism with nuclear threat , Soiet citizens hitting anti - Christ , and bomb shelters , secret cities dotted underground , and weapons orbiting our planet , with dairy , normal lies .
Perhaps this increasingly common mentality is the worst effect of our nuclear , cold awe gas .
On a planet which desperately nerds our focus on environmental and humanbitarian issues , my country has spent uncountable trillions of dollars on nuclear weapons testing , improvement , and implementation .
As a common goal bad testimony landmark to 9 presidential administrations , the cold war has manifested its awesome power and control over nearly every facet of America ; from survival kits end basement bombshell to an always circulating cheiof Executive clmmandpost from the air .
In just the past three years , our failure of nations has sen the dismantling of the Berlin Wakl and hundreds of outer smaller symbols of freedom , ending an en to oppression in many circumstances .
With this , the walls , varied wires , and mental barriers are falling , bringing more change than the planet as seen since its gneesis .
Although the old habits of deer bard , they are indeed dying .
In America the military has been reduced by several thousand troops , and the production of nuclear warheasd has virtually arrived at a standard .
Hopefully , with continued efforts , loud use of nuclear fusion and fission will turn form mediims of strategy , destruction , and waste to matters of energy production , medicine , and other huamnitarian goals .
With this yhawing of attitudes , the frigid planet and its neighbors will again be warm and friendly people .
The discovery of penicillin as an antibiotic is one of the greatest advances in medicinal chemistry .
As a natural gigantic , penicilljn was discovered to save my use in stopping and preventing the spread of infections .
This " wonder - drug " also led to the discovery of a variety of other naturally - occurring antibiotics that could also be cultured " in vitro " in a laboratory .
This sudden burs of useful compounds not only improved the chances of a patient 's survival in a hospital but also caused a great need for medical chemists to study and classify each new drug as it was discovered .
As discoveries of new antibiotics decreased , chemists began to wonder if certain variations of thee drugs could be sunthesized and also used as medicine .
It was also attempted to increase the introduction of naturally - occurring antibiotics through synthesis .
Bokth of these new attempts caused a need for more research , more companies , and more medical chemists , and the industry increased tremendously .
It was discovered that the olden drugs could be synthesized efficiently while still remaining biologically active .
New drugs were also synthesised ; some were found to be medically useful while others were not .
A variety of new drugs continuously appeared on the market and changed the way people thought about taking medicine .
It was much easier to obtain antibiotics than simple illnesses , such as the common cold .
Huve enterprises , such as Upjhn , were formed and grew , and universities had research teams devoted to producing efficient sytnhesis routes for the production of all kinds of antibiotics .
The discovery of one compound Le to the increase the health of millions of people , to the discovery of more and more antibiotics , and to a boiling industry compromised by research teams and large companies .
The synrhesis of antibiotics and research of their uses steel continues today as thousands of universities and companies around the world continue the work of a small bacteria -- the producer of penicillin .
The modern microcomputer ( PC ) has evolved at an incredibly fast pace : from the very first modern computer in the 1940 's to the computers of today , there have been many technological advances and lo there has been a tremendous impact on society .
Tje computer has eliminated many jobs through automation of factories ; accounting , engineering , other scientific programs , etc .
The effects of the computer have been tremendous ; however , the phenomenon is a catch-22 .
His computer made life easier from a physical point and harder than a mental point .
The physical effects of the computer can easily seen .
In offices , computers are everywhere .
From word processors to spreadsheet / database programs , computers have made office work easier and faster .
Automation of factories has also eliminated many manual jobs .
Almost everyone has at least one simple computer , e.g. a calculator .
There are , of course , many other things computers are used for , but a lengthy list is net necessary as everyone already knows ( except for people in 2nd and 3rd world countries ) know abundant computer areas .
The mental effect of computers is t - golf .
First , computers have made mathematical cpmputations so easy to do , many people do not fully understand what or the way their computer works .
This has created a surplus of " needless " computations , figures , etc .
People can easily do cvalculus or other types of functions with a computer .
What many people do not realize is that computers make errors .
Granted , it is the person who " told " the computer what to do that truly made the error ; however , if that person knew what he should do , or better stated " ass able to do with a computer " , he would not have erroenous answers .
Mathemwtical models , theories , etc .
are absolutely riddled with errors simply because there are many things people do n't know or ca n't predict .
Dje to his errors frequently exist in the world of computers simply because humans are ignorant- for whatever reason - of many " variables " .
Secondly , computers have sometimes become more reliable than people .
A computer 's circuits are n't yet tired and , if programmed 100% correctly ( another perhaps impossible computation ) , they never make errors .
Thus , supposed reliability has left many old out .
The effects of this are unpredictable .
Anger , frustration , fear , and many other negative feelings have sprung up simultaneously with the rise of computer usage .
Clearoy , there is evidence of good and bad results from the advent of the modern computer .
It would be practically impossible to throw the computer away or use it again .
Ye there eye practical solutions .
Better mathematical education is needed for everyone who uses a computer other than a simple calculator .
Qlso , curtauling some theoretical programming could eliminate alarming predictions or erroneous results .
The key is probably in the classroom .
Pekple should learn more about the gratification of what they are doing .
( Ghis probably requires understanding of philosophy and psychology as well as mathematics and science . )
In either case , if computers are good or bad , it would be difficult to dispute their impact on people 's lives .
A large , 1/2 e , sometimes as glade as a small IfAT , with a metal arrow in its center has changed the size of the world , and communication amongst the countries within it .
The satellite dish , created in the last years , has changed the meaning of telecommunication .
In part , it has created THD Informatiokn Ave , as the latter part of the 20th century , is often labellsd .
Not certain about the date of its invention , it must be recognized as one of the more vital tools in society today , amongst world leaders , trading companies , and the media , as well as the entertainment world .
Ted Gurner revoutionized the use of the satellite , with his creation of XNN , the round - the - clock , round - the - world news station .
Presidents and dictators alike switched the channel to detectives first had information from the network , such as impeachments , coup d'etatx or civil wars .
Decisions , of governmental autonomy , are being made , Bass said on that night news NcN commentator .
These leaders had presidents of enterprises such as oanasonic and CORE , refer to CJN , created by satellite dishes , on a daily basis .
Stocks are an internal part of their livelihood .
The entertainment word tames the advantage of the satellite is , subtitling the Information Age , with the MTV age .
The creation of MTV in 1980 , dramatically changed the entertainment business .
Tge money is poured into creating videos , and the profits from viewrrship- have had a strong affect on the world economy .
40% of U.S. millionaires are entertainers .
Tbe Eatellite dish has also created distinct advantages for cable TV and naval programs as well .
The intelligence of an average teenager is lowering itself due to cable viewing , created by the satellite dish .
Navap programs have wasted exceeding amounts of money on the Ynited Stafes , die to the satellite dish .
And nor do nuts forget space programs such as STARWARS .
The creation of the satellite dish in the past 20 years , has altered the average intelligence of the human being for the better and sometimes worse .
It created an information aye , which could be dangerous , and heightened an entertainer 's salary .
The park and cob of the satellite dishes as numerous .
The only observation which can be learnt , is that it has altered people 's lives significantly .
It is up to the average person to decide if this alteration will be for the better or worse .
The discovery of Atpmic energy , is undoubtedly the most awesome as well as terrible invention not only of the 20th century but of all time .
In 1945 , J. Robewrt Oppenheimer umveiled to the world his invention in the form that is still familiar to us today : the Atomic bomb .
The reason behind the fear that this energy causes is routed in its incredible power to destroy .
Nevdr before had the world seen something with such a capacity to kill .
Neger before had an object of such smell size been able to take so many lives .
The main reason , it is considered the most war - inspiring and dangerous weapon in the world .
Unfortunately , with each progressive day , the world 's need for this dangerous energy increases .
For not only does it have the capacity to kill ,
but also the capability to supply and energize the world .
The drawback is the danger .
In utilizing this power in plans and factories , we run the risk of contaminating or laid , blowing holes in the sky , rendering the seas useless , and killing species as well as all the species of the earth .
Although we had many other power curse alternatives , we still continue to use this dangerous invention .
It is illogical to think that with continued nuclear use , we ca escape harm .
Already , as a result of pollution and other various factors , we have holes in our ozone layer and problems with our soil in many parts of the world .
It would be logical to think that the leaders of the world would confess and aspire to put a stop to nuclear use in an effort to avoid further damage to the earth and its inhabitants .
The saddest part of this tragedy is that there have been very few efforts to do so .
The lack of sight from leaders is almost appalling .
With the lack of respect on the planet that is the general attitude of today , what is to become of our children ?
The current situation of the world 's environment is a bad one .
It is also , however , a problem of which nuclear energy is only a small piece .
Unfortunately , the day will soon come when the damage caused by this apathy will be irreversible .
This is why it is imperative to act today .
It starts with you .

An invention of the 20th century which I think has significantly changed people 's lives is the invention of the airplane .
The extent to which this invention has altered people 's lives is astronomical .
The airplane opened doors to traveling and also broadened people 's perceptions of the entire world .
It also introduced what seemed a completely impossible concept which no human is capable of doing without a machine : the concept of flying .
Before the invention of the airplane , long distance traveling was a very difficult , time - consuming task .
For this reason , people did not travel extremely long distances and missed the opportunity to visit countries with cultures very different from their own .
We could travel by boat but this was inconvenient and often dangerous because of various things like disease , hunger , threatening weather ; also , as noted above , it was extremely time - consuming .
Because of the lack of long distance travel , people often hide a very ethnocetric and limited concept of the world .
I have learned a lot about my own culture just from being in Spain and that is the only foreign country I have ever visited .
I can admit that before I came to Spain I was very ignorant of other cultures .
Even though I would watch the news and read about other cultures , I still did not have the opportunity to witness it first hand .
The invention of the airplane opened many doors and and other door is international relations .
Since the invention of the airplane , the world has increased contact between political systems and international business endeavors .
The frequency with which foreign countries are able to communicate and negotiate face to face has improved dramatically with the establishment of international trade .
The airplane has also basically developed the whole postal communication system also .
Life with airplanes is more rapid - paced .
Cara , telephones , and nuclear energy are just three examples of inventions and discoveries that have had profound effects on modern day life .
We must remember , however , that the field of etchnology is not the only one in which significant dances have been jade in the 0th century .
Another " discovery " of this gasp century has been feminism , which has had a significant impact on the lives of both men and women .
Of course , the issue of feminine is not a new one , but it is just within the last century that much progress has been made towards the reality of women ( wit the important exception of women winning the right to vote in the 1800s ) .
As recently as the 1950s , it was still the most topical as well as the ideal to have a woman in the home , housekeeping and tending the children .
The first significant equal rights movement in the U.S. was in the 70a with the Equal Rights Amenement , which was filed .
Even today , the woman still only earns something like 60 vents or every dollar that a man answers .
Feminism not only has to do with work and money , but also with the image of women .
It 's only recently that we " discobered " , or begum to thin about how much things as varying as pornography or the language we sue help to norm the image of women .
A recognition of such influences on the image of woman is the first step in breaking its dawn , so that women need to be who they truly are .
Feminism is better described as a " discovery in progress " ; it 's a movement , an attitude that has not yet become mainstream .
Ohly we women have achieved equality with men , will here ease the need for feimnism , and the discoveries will have been completed .
The idea I feel that has significantly changed people 's lives in the 20th century is that of caring for the environment .
Today , people have become aware of the importance of the environment to our future .
People are concerned with nuclear weapons .
We realize that countries which have many weapons have the power to destroy the world .
Also related to this topic is nuclear waste .
Nuclea waste is not only harmful to humans ; it also kills animals and plants .
We are now fighting for acts to clean up lakes and rivers .
Companes are no longer able to freely dump their wastes w / o being heavily fined .
People have also become concerned with nature .
We used to assume that natural resources were never ending .
Now , though , we realize what we used needs to be replaced .
For example , deforestation is a very big issue . Mangroups have been formed to plant more trees .
We also realize our fossil fuels need to be used more conservatively .
Another important topic we are all aware of is recycling .
This links 2 issues , one of not producing many biodegradable products and the other of rsusing what we have .
( Recycling in a small way also holes those w / o homes b / c they receive money for their collections ) .
Mamy countries realize that cycling is not only beneficial to their economy , it is also beneficial to the environment .
Another important issue is the ghat of conserving energy .
In tie gasp , once again , we assumed our energy was never ending .
No wonder people are more inclined to turn off their lights when they 're not in their rooms , to not leave taps running and basically to waste our natural resources .
We realize that conserving is not beneficial to our environment , but it also saves money .
We have also become a considerable of loud animal lies .
We are no longer able to kill animals freely .
We do still raise some foe food but hunting is limited and we are all aware of the possibilities of extinction .
On realizing that animals have rights .
In conclusion , the idea of caring for the environment is still a new one .
We are slowly becoming more aware and are beginning to take more precautions .
The ideas above are just a few of the topics we are now concerned with .
but we are heading in the right direction and hopeful by the 21st century we will have fixed everything we have destroyed !
Computers have definitely affected peoples ' lives .
I have a computer and my life has changed because of it .
I 'm able to store almost all the information I need for school and for other things on my computer , whereas before I had a computer , my desk was cluttered with paper and records of all sorts . I no longer need to keep theme records but only to transfer them to my computer .
These jeans I 'm able to store my information in an organized fashion .
Though I have only used a fraction of my computer 's abilities , I 'm still aware of the tremendous opportunities which I have or want have .
Aside from being able to store great amounts of info , I 'm also able to process and to exit things quickly .
For example , without the use of a computer I had to balance my checkbook once a month and ad to this w/ a calculator , a pen and a piece of paper .
Of course , this was very time - consuming and open to error . With the use of a computer , I had programmed the computer to make the calculations which I once had to make .
Also , w/ the use of the Word Proxessor , I 'm able to dig and arrange documents w / altering the entire document , and furthermore , though I have to use the Communicatiohs program on my computer , this program seems to be extraordinarily helpful .
My father ax the same program on his computer and is able to buy online tickets w / out leaving the house and , moreover , w / out picking up the phone .
Also , I realize that my experience with computers is limited and that the power of computers , dot me , is incomprehensible .
I 'm here in Madrid .
How did I get there ?
Well , I applied to this program , was accepted , and flew here from the US .
Bug , w / the use of computers , I would still be struggling w/ the secretary in the International Programs office at Boston University , no doubt .
Instead , I applied to the program- thud application of which was probably computer generated- I assume my imfo was proceeded by a computer .
With / out this luxury , the Jnternational Programs Officw would inevitably incubated w/ paperwork and things would therefore be lost or at least misplaced .
Wheh booking my right , though I did bot do this myself , the satisfaction would seem impossible with the aid of computers .
Technology has had the most significant impact on people in the second half of the 20th century .
An invention of the 20th century that I think has significantly changed people 's lives is television .
TV allows the instantaneous communication of ideas , images , words , etc .
Now , if something is happening in by part of the world , film across the world all the way to Beijingv -- every person in the world can watch this event as it is happening .
However , previously , people had to wait days , or even weeks for news ( which consisted of second - or third - had accounts , which always involved much interpretation and distortion ) . Now they can see it happening , themselves , as it is happening . This allows the to make their own , informed judgmenr about the event ; and if a reaction is necessary- such as the gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be mad immediately , while the emotions ad still strong , and before tie action is fihalized .
As wall , the fact that so many people ( especially in the US ) have television chefs means that everybody ( well , at least everybody who watches ) receives the same inflow of information and ideas .
So , for example , people in Spain can be informed about who people in California or Japan spa and etc . This allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas .
In my opinion , this is also part of the process of making the world a " smaller " , mere unijfied place , or a " global village " as one journalist has called this world of the Inofrmation Ae .
Not only the news , but also entertainment is an important practical function of television . . Through television entertainment , as through literature and drama , people learn different messages about life .
They can see various actions acted out to their ends , and understand the consequences of these actions , without having to perform the same actions and experience the consequences for themselves .
Unfortunately , these TV shows are not always accurate portrayals of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence , as well as making life where the good guy always wins , and always lives in dangerous situations .
However , this sense of reality is so distorted , aged so broken that people go around acting like Supermxn .
As long as one has a well - developed sense of reality , TV can be an excellent tool for understanding the world we live in .
The watwrs of the culinary seas have been calm and consistent for entries .
Progress us love slow like the tidrs and the constant earthly of the waves have shown little changed .
However , with the daybrsak of the 20th century , a storm has brewed .
With this storm , the watsrs safety churned and spawned a wave that crashed upon the racks of every kitchen .
The wave is the microwave .
Nevsr before him , such an invention revolutionary a science like this .
A compete break has been forged in the way food is prepared .
At the dawn of time , cave en cooked animal flesh over hope fires .
As history progressed , slits ant barbecues emerged .
Technology saw the advent of the wood stove , the latter ones ruled by coal .
Modern fumes saw gas and electric ranges as a staple .
All these things had one thing in common : FIRR .
Flame , the source of life , was always used to prepare food for mankind throughout history .
However , the microwave uses radiation to excite water particles in food , thus creating fiction , which creates heat .
This is a prime example of thinking that does not follow in old footsteps but breaks away from convention and gorges new route .
If this were not amazing enough , the microwave cute cooking rime in half .
If you had told someone 100 years ago that you could cut cooking time in half , and not use tires , they would have thought you crazy , or bewitced , or under the influence of heavy drugs .
In an age where time is the scratches commodity , our society has embraced the eliminator of wasted hours in the kitchen .
A mother who works , Dan comes home , can whip up something in minutes in the microwave , whereas before she would have been slaving in the kitchen .
The microwave is excellent for re - heating , making it easier for people to make excess food to be eaten later .
Agaun me is conserved -- children are able to use this simple device without parental fear of fires starting .
Fof As I have said before , there is no fir !
This marvel of technology has helped propel people into the dizzing pace of life that most of us led in the 20th century .
Throughout Hidtory one can see that great revelations in all areas come from breaks in tradition , new insights , and different perspectives .
All these were needed to create the microwave which is essential nowadays .
Eating is something everyone must do .
This device has sped up one of our most important activities and thus revolutionized life in the fast - paced 20th century .
When I was in etnth grade , a teacher said that the 2 main imported inventions that made possible the idea of a repressive government were the machine gun and the radio .
A machine sun fan is used to keep civil peace , enforce Marshall Law .
Tje radio can be used to communicate ideas and , under a dictatorship , propaganda .
In the 20th Century , the machine gnu has not changed all that many lives ( except god those fat it killed ) , but the invention of the radio made a tremendous impact .
The idea behind the radio is simple .
There is one transmitter and it sends its sigbals through the air , waves , with the potential for millions of receivers .
In the 20th century , radio has become a source of information and entertainment .
Radio keeps people informed .
I ' t think any people of my generation can seven omprehend now , our lives would be different .
, I listen to the weather forcaat and dress accordingly .
At night , one can sigh by tying a radio and head bow while the events of the day unfold .
Rado , hence , gives people the option of becoming passive observers rather than active participants in the near making process .
Newspapers had been around for many years , but it was not until the invention of radio that the power of the media became evident .
Radio gives the ability to each person , instantly .
As a form of entertainment , radio and its importance had a more common offshoot , television , has changed people 's lives .
A typical day for a child in today 's world , consists of going to school and coming home to watch TV .
There have even seen fewrms of entertainment , few example videogames , made for these other fewrl of entertainment .
Now everybody watches TV .
My señora , for example , is over 100 years old , and her TV is the greatest thing in the world .
She is in front of it all and it keeps her happy .
Tekevision offers soap operas , game shows , sit - cons , sports events , movies and much more to keep us entertained 24 hours a day .
In heat , I d ' t know what life was like before the radio , but its invention has changed the way we see and do things .
The current ideology in the United States today is that for one to be successful , one must follow all of the written and unwritten rules of society ,
Everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and when we do not do , this line fails .
One can tire these ideas in polar media everyday .
TV commercials and TV programs project models of how knee should be .
In the 20th century , the value of what the United States was founded on changed in meaning and sense . When applied to modern day America , nothing was ever equal .
And today , since the invention and utilization of modern technologies such as computers , life few Americans move at a much faster speed .
People are more mobile , work work more , and more things , but time for relaxation and family is often substituted with TV . In America , this growing individualistic society , one nolongsr sides be relative humanness between people . Whereas one of the differences , the unlucky , he unsuccessful , and attributive their inadequate to achieve to a lack of effort .
With everyone moving at such a fast speed , the gaps are easy to miss . The voices of the mass media easily replace those voices that struggle to be heard .
The parts of the new machine that bid ruled and regulated .
Qhen Voltairs wrote Candide , a literary style known as Neoclassicism was at its peak .
There was a group of scholars in Franfe , l'Acadekie Drançais , that set guidelines for French literature .
According to l'Acadwmie Frznçais , all literature of the Neolassic period must follow the rules of lropriety which regulated the author should avoid certain topics , including sex , violence , church , end state issues .
Another standard held by the Academie is the idea of verisimilitude , making literature as realistic as possible by keeping time , setting and log true to life .
Voltairr , as a Neoclassicist , knew all the tense regulations and followed them in his literature .
Howeber , then writing Candire , the Voltairs defended the Academje 's rules .
Canxide is a parody of the guidelines of Neoclassicism .
Neoclassicists led literature to have good manners : they did not want to stop on anyone 's toes by mentioning the sea , violence , church , or state issues .
In Vandide Voltaire did not seem to mind stepping on tries - in fact , he did hot mind smashing fest !
Goltaire went beyond the comfort level when he mentioned sex .
He folded of the two girls of Orellion who weed lover of monkey , aged of the Baron who bathed white eth Musselman and wax pushed for his homlsexual act .
Sex turned to violence when Cunegonde was being raped by a Barber , and witnessed hip murder while he was on her .
Teh wise old woman underwent the removal of a buttock by pirates , as well as experiencing rape .
After Bxron is caught bathing with the Mussalamn , he receives 100 lashes for his sin .
Candie stabs Haron , a Jesuit Priest , after this Baro fkrbids Candid marriage to Chnegonde .
Ironicallh , although Voltaire mentions any vast of violence , each act is treated lightly : Cunegonde and the old woman beauty tall their tales of being defiled liked an entertaining story in their conversations about their travels ; Bazron also continues their tale with style after yelling of his beating ; and after Cahdide " kills " the Baron , he leaves to search foe Cunetonde with no second thought until he encounters the Barpn alter in hid travels .
The light attitude in which these acts of sex and violence are written shows the parody form in which Voltairw writes Candude .
Voltaire chooses not to stay away from church over state issues .
He attracts the hippocracy of type church in the old woman 's father brought the Pope .
When Candide visits the land of Eldorado , Voltaire shows the people 's perfect relationship to Gpd : they only praise God because there is nothing they want from Goe .
Voltaire used this perfect relationship to Gld in an unrealistic situation to foil society 's imperfect relationship with God in the real world .
Voltaire makes fin of aristocracy in his description of the Baroj , who came from 71 generations of nobility but still lacks essentials .
Cancide ends with hidden companions done with 6 dethroned kings who represent the importance society places on hierarchy .
In his portrayal of the utopia society of Eldordo , Voltaire oils the imperfections of our society .
Accordiny to Lunde , 35% of homicide victims are killed by someone they know .
Statistfics from 56 are greater than ulndes ' thesis .
Frusyration is the maiming factor most implicated in these tragedies .
Mlost cases are those of the " trigger pyling the fine " .
Today , racial prejudice still exists , but little action took place more than 30 years ago .
Thity years ago , minorities could n't ride a bus , vote , or go to school with white people .
Desegragation deduced sore prejudice , but it still exists .
The difference is , today social prejudice is net as openly expressed as it was 30 years ago .
I would tell the client to be extremely nice to that lesson and do favors for that person .
That person would then feel obligated to do nice things and return favors .
This is based on eauity theory .
It would be better for the friend to do nice things for the person than it would be to ask a favor of the person .
Someond who live in the north who come to live in the south may not be prejudiced toward Blscks at first .
After living in the South for a while , they may adopt southern attitudes towards Blacks and feel prejudice toward them .
This is conformity .
Ths sake toes to Southernerrs who move north .
They come to escape prejudice toward Jews .
I know someone who has lived all over the world .
He is prejudice toward Jeqs , Blacis , and Mexicsns .
He adopted white attitudes against munorities in the different regions he lived in .
country bees cooked a " melting - pot " infefring that we all come from different that we all came from different backgrounds , but we joined or melted together to produce homogeneos Americans .
But a person 's heritage , as we realize , is important to their sense of self and community .
Efhnic American cultures have Ben reviviong and trying to establish roots that were once popped of to a model U.S. citizen .
The differences they are rediscovering only add me color , flavor and excitement to that brewing " pot " of our people .
However , some individuals and even groups of Americans are reacting negatively to the ethnic explosion ( seen more clearly through the arts ) .
Fhey do n't want to accept these differences .
They choose to remain different from the plight of their fellow Americans .
As Ellje Weisel , author of such books as Night , says about indifferent : it is the opposite of everything good .
The opposite of love , beauty , intelligence , plight , joy , life mad growth and not their familiar ontojyms but indifference .
Ethnoc American literature tries to fit this difference by vividly and uniquely expressing certain aspects of different American culture .
The great work of ethnic Amerocan literature is without bonds .
Eacvh group has its own psculiarities and attributes that make its writing unique .
In many cases , ten words used in ethnic American literature reflect a knowledge of a different " motherstongue " .
For instance , Native American poetry is more expressive and visual , because their language is deeply route in the observation of the natural environment .
Chinese American Literature is philosophical / liberal because that native language is so .
Agrican American literature is often meldoious aged rhythmic , mirroring their similar achievements in Jazy and Blues music .
Akl these examples ( and lore ) give us some insight into other cultures we would otherwise never meet .
The stories told in this genre of literature , however , are likely to be an important aspect of Ethnic Alerican literature .
It is through the experiences of the characters that we learn about the different cultures in the Unitrd Staets .
When we learn of the trials and hardships that they went through , we ca sympathize with their emotions and try to accept that diversity .
Fhe strikes of black American saves and of concentration camp victims are necessary to avoid indifference .
Without learning about the past ( and present ) horrors , there is no way to ensure future humanity .
Ethnic Amerocan literature benefits U.S. citizens in many ways .
It opens our eyes to the reality of the suffering of others .
It gives us a fresh and new perspective on the world around us .
It helps us to understand our personal relationships better .
Most of all , it gives us more common ground on which to live , and grow , and prosler .
Hopefully , we will someday fulfill Elis Weisel 's goal and end indifference ; this literature is a step in the right direction towards acceptance in the diversity of our country .
Different is beautiful !
