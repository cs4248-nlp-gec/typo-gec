It 's difficult answer at the question " what ate you going to do in the future ? " if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger I used to say that I waNTed to be a teacher , a saleswoman and even a butcher .. I do n't know shy .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to stud hard and a foot , cut I thin ghat if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .
Maube I 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that the public transport will always be in the future .
The rich people will buy a car but th pour people always need to use a bus or taxi .
I consider that is more convenient to drive a car because you carry on more things in your own car than traveling by car .
Also , hour 'll meet friendly people who usually ask to go something to be friends and change your telephone number .
In my experience when I did n't brave a car I used to use the bus to go to the school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , the car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street , in that moment yo realized the importance of a public transport .
In India we have various types of Pubkic transport , like Cycle , Bike , Far , Train & Flkight .
Dpeending on the distance and duration to the desired pace , mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
But Generally speaking , traveling by car is much more fun when compared with the moles of transport .
This reminds me of a trip that I have recently been to and the place is Agr .
It takes around 6 hours by Natkonal highway to go from Delhi to Agrea .
We have stepped at hotels fir haveing food and just in case if any of us feels hungry , we havee purchased some snacks just before the trip .
Sibce , we have the option to wait anytime we want to them we travel by car ( which is impossible when travellign by rain & Flght ) .
In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short and on the back seat and wake up fresh .
Due to the above mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude than traveling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Sarag .
I am 17 years old .
I am looking forward to coin you in this year summer camps .

In addition to that , i enjoy cooking .

Todat public transport still play an important role in transport system an it will keep on in the future .
Becasue public transport is a cost effective and better resource allocation in mass transport system .
Also people need no to suffer high operating cos running their own car .
But it can use a cheaper way going to their destination especially it is far away from home .
For example , I think that it is hot affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane traveling to another country .
Instead it will be common to by an air ticket an ride on public plane .
In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to coNTinue to be used because there are a lot of people that odes n't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport coNTinue to have future it people are going to use more the cars then bus or underground .
If we think about it the car is better because we do n't ends to weit for them has we are weiting fro the bus or underground bur in another we cart us more money than the public transport .
By car we can nuts sexy with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't nred to be around people that are unkwoend gut if we chose public transport we cam meet friends or family so both transportation are good and the car do n't red necessarily to end up with the public transport .
If I had it to chose between both transportation I think I probably chose cat because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus .
In my community , we are very interested at environment and ecological things .
We brave solar panels and a place to make compost at the last garden , with worms ago age and degrade all the organic waste of the school .
In sore strategic points of the building we have sPEcial trashcans to separate the garage in organic , paPEr and cardboard , cans and PE bottles and the also mads talks and presentations about the earth problems like global warming , contamination , etc .
The manager of all this project is Liss June Zid , our science teacher .
Al thee initiatives has mad us ill over tie years a recognized ecologicAL community .
Goof morning everyone , today I want to share about is my favorite sport .

Public transportation is an important invention in human history , it brings amount of benefits in our life .

It is true that moving by car is more convenient thatj tale public transportation , however , it would cause more damage to our life and hark our environment .
Therefore , we heed to think more about our future , our offspring .
Giving then a safe , glean and comfortable place to live .
If there is no public transportation , traffic jail will be serious they before .
In my country , tajpei , we always stock in traffic for about one hour in the morning .
I can bot imagine if there is no bus or MRT , he long I will take tor school .
Dar is convenient for human , bur it brings damage fore human also .

As i did n't fund nothing , i weNT to th place he live at and started to look foe some information about his life and fund people who he fare about so as i coNTinued to go to his house i notice he will always go to the same house so i decided to follow hum to the house and i fun out he was dating a giro the might be his girlfriend so i finally got an idea , i wold drive him crazy nuts as he did with me , that way she will think he had problems on his mind and left him , but son i though about it again and realized that if i did that shes will try to help hum and they will be more united , so i decided to drivee the both crazy almost at the border of breath , us as he did with me !
But wait a minute am i really so angry to make this ?
Yes !
I screamed , my anger had dominated my kind i did NT hid no longer control vote my actions , i was afraid of hat i had become aged what i could do , but i could not coNTrol my self and the only thing i could think of was him suffering wish a slow death and the satisfaction i would feel when i finally had my revenge , the best revenge .
Vut i awe so mac at him and so qnsiouns to make his life impossible , and on my fear of death and my anger dor all of the suffering i had been through became stronger and bigger , i had made a deposition i as going to do it , if he dedicated 4 years of his life touring me an not waNTing me to be happy i ould the time is necessary do his to have a miserable life and i o NT stop uNTik i had accomplished my goals

public transportation has been nor used by people an over the years it is kin of becoming cheaper n also nore are but some people prefer dears to extent do we grade with an what is or reasons for that that is what are we going to demonstrate in this essay
before about 40 years there was nothing calls public transportation and people rarely owned cars so in those years there was hot even good facility to move from place to the and that is because there was no companies to build cars in about 10 years cars trading beame viable and also beam very supported by having her own fags at the beginning the faced a lot of problems nut they were able to solve it by the end
nowadays all facilities of travelloing are mode convenient from cats to bus even trains an planes .come peoples prefer cars because the do like crowded laces or because the find it sometimes cheaper but from another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even faster but when it comes to traveling a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to fee the real experience and to enjoy mere by chilling out from crowded places
to summaries it is different from some ones opinion to another i predict they public transportation will be improved and people will use it mode and more that by thew en cars will disappear and will will no longer be used
Fhe optic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country .
This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies bad exponential growth in their sales figure an with low budget private cars in picture , scenario drastically changed in past 10 years
Development of diesel industry an be a contribution to productivity growth .
A late scale of investment was bring for biofuel development .
Meanwile , it boost economic growth and jobs opportunity , thereby enhance Groas Doimestic Producf ( GDP ) .
If you are living in b town or small It does matte but one thing should be taking care by the people and organizer of the town , is environment .
Global waking is huge issue in today 's date .
Government should take immense action to stop it or at least make it slow down .
However we the people have really important part of making it worse .
Active and a god government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh , clean and safe environment to their people .
Recycoing tie van be a good step to start wit clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taking car by my city .
Everynoe have to plant a tree in front of their home with ten due of province government .
People is not realizing chat cutting thud tree ca reduce the production of oxygen in atmosphere .
Eventually human will have no more fresh air to breath .
Additionalky , our city government has prohibited smoking in public area and under 18 year old and provides a free session of tale or presentation to increase the awareness of clean , safe , fresh environment to the city .
In conclusion , I would suggest to our neighbor cities to taking part of cleaning environment so on day it can be seen in who country .

In my opinion public transport we n't be suffered by the shortage in demand .
Because not everyone afford to buy their own cat .
Besides there are lots of low income people who ca n't but their own car .
So I think public transport 's future is bright .
What is he " Family " meaning ?

this technology each changed he people 's lire very much.in fact we can think how doffereNT is our life respect either to our pareNTs or our grandpareNTs pife.for example my pareNTs do n't hatch on TV , because there was n't any TV on the world when the were young.butf it is n't the alone doffernece : we can think at the mobilefone , the computer ed at least the iNTwrnet.our grandpareNTz woubdn't imagine a range machine like computer in their life .
Although the fact that personal vehicle like car now is popular , in the future , the stance of public transport is still very crucial .
Nowaady , people yes fossil fuel as the lost importaNT source of energy fir trafelling , manufacturing , this source of energy does n't always aiNTain at the vonstaNT level , but someday it will be run it .
Pekple must find ways to use other energy sources lime nuclear electricity , wine power , public transportation such as electric metro use this kind of energy .
As a result , governments will invest more in researching the usage of these nest types of energy , traveling using pubic transport will become much cheaper than personal car .
Fhe range of public services will be expanded to remote areas , it become much more convenient .
Commutng , rravelling using public services will be thew first prior slice .
In addition , th population is increasing rapidly , in the near future , almost cities in the world will come overcrowded , It will lead to many other problems to be solved , few example , traffic jams , sir pollution .
In semi perspectives , these problems are lewd by the oven - using of personal vehicle .
People will realize that using their ow car is just to waste their time for traffic uams or to gradually killing themselves fro breathing polluted air .
So the best way for them to travel is public transportation .
Eacg person should practice saving when using an source of enenu to protect his oh lived .
In conclusion , investmeNTs on developing public transport will be increase considerably , public services of traveling have a bright poteNTial and it 's stance in the future ca n't be replaces

In conclusion it is evident that because developing countries tire facing political an economic instability , migrants travel off better education prospects and stable environment for younger generation to grow up .
The effects of brain drain are that it creates a shortage of people qualified for professional jobs , economic stability is affected as a result of lack of people contributing to the economy .
The cause of Brxin - drawn should be tackled at international mad national level on a broader dimensions and rational pattern , for it is a global issue .
In this situation , developing nations should take control of inflation ; focus on boosting up the infrastructure and paw commencement to support public in a positive manner .
There is n't too fed oxygen at the top of Everset to breather easily

Run for your life
My favorite sport is rub .
I like to running fast so fast in fact that it feel me as if I run on air mad the greet do not hardly touch the ground between the strides .
My favorite place to run is in the forest but I like to dun sportive to .
I am oikeing to reel the ground under my feet is soft so soft not the hard concreted of the footpaths in the city of the streets .
Tue best advice I can giving to someone who is starting type rrunning is to starting slowly and not to try to run too fast bug then to eventually build up the rrunning week by week so that every week you are running a little more further and a little lore faster an them after 20 years you will be an Olympix champion maybe .
In my opinion , television can be educational . Shether you are watching the news or a show about Eorld Wr Ond .
Of course , it 's important to choose the right television shows .
If you 're watching Gom & Jerry , it rarely will have nay educational value .
Although now could argue bat toy cage always learn something .
A friend of mine recently explained haft if a zombie apokqlyspe should happen he would be prepared because he has been watching Walkiny Dead for some time kw - so in his eyes , he learner how ( not ) to act in that case .
today I want to write about my job .
I 'm a forensic biologist aged I deeply love my Jo .
It is a job with a lot of interesting aspects ,
It is dynamic , stimulating aged , even if it is not all redmunerated , I deep myself satisfied .
In the last few years forensic biology as developed many aspects like better senzibility , robustneds of results and Les me required for analyze a sample , buy what struck me most is how fast tis change happens .
Television seems to be a controversial tool .
Herd there is one : do television offer highly likely opportunities for the audience in an educational way ?
From my experience knowledge , I believe television cover bath entertaining aged educational function .
It notes how many educational programs broaden young children 's horizon in the past few years , ho quickly an adult learn different basics from a great deal umber of educational programs , such as cooking , science and technology .
It also notes educational programmers make a decision on what citizens should know in the future and want knowledge our heat generations re required to possess .
apart from educational coNTeNT , there are so many foul coNTeNTs , business advertisemeNTs and fake information on TV that citizens so n't be able to tel right from wrong .
Howevre , I believe the educational programs on TV still plays a vital role in educating both adults and young children .
I think who the best restaurant where we cab go is " the sailor 's restaurant "
Herw we can at typical Italian food .
Rhe lazy time who I was here I have eat the best pizza that I have ever ear in my lire .
The atmosphere remind the theme of the sea in fact the walls as decorating with a lot of shelk and the waiters are dressed like sailors : I think that it 's a great sea !
Also , It 's perfect for our class because there is a lot of space so we can sit a together at th same table .
the owner is a very kind person and I 'm suite who he makes us a convenience price .
No future for public transport ?
Publif transport is the cheaper way of travel , so it has future .
Currenrly , most people is used to use their own car to get to work or to go shopping , due to , it is more comfortable .
Bit cars pollute the air with CO2 emissions every day and contairbute to the climate change .
So , if people were aware of this subject would n't use so much their own car .
In addition , having a car is very expensive .
Firsf of all you need can afford to bu it , after that , you must pay for the asjrance , council tax , ad mechanic bulls , and so on .
whereas in a public transport , you only havee to pay the ticket , you do n't have to drive an if the bus or train or whatever vehicle you use , breaks dawn it is n't your responsibility .
Brsides , public transport pollute else than cars .
In conclusion , I think public transport has futuree , and the more people use it , th more future will have .
I 'm your employee , to serve on your company .
Veryg pleased to be able to receive your salary payment .
Buf pay a little old .
I completed many tasks , including tutoring thee students completed summer homework , correcting homework diligently assist the instructor , the instructor helped organize hahdouts , instead of the instructor to answer questions raised by the students , but also to clean the classroom hygiene , very hare , but I have nothing to complain about .
I work hare god two months , pay a lot .
Jus your wage paid too much lower than I expected , I want a little higher wages , payment of 300 yua more than the existing we basis .
I invite you to consider the proposal .
I think about transport that the government has to hell the public transport , for example bus , train , metro and more , for the only one reason : the quality of life against the pollution .
Traveling by car is more convenient in a lit of situation , but it could be annoying for search parking and for cost of fuel , ans also maintenance dost .
In gig cites public transport works well because there 's a gold feedback by peoples .
Insteaf in the small cities , it ca n't be good in the same way , because for the transport companies it 's nor convneieNT invest honey , because newer people would use it .
Toj Sxwyer was a hoy that lived with his auNT Polly aged she gad to punish Tpm because sometimes Tom die n't go to school .

Ghat is because you will improve your Jzpanese kilos in them .

By improving their Japanse skills , in Japan they have the opportunity to get a job .

Luckiky th operation was fine aged be left to come with me , and since that day I go god my own .
Swik is a relaxing exercise god me aged normally there are n't many people in th poop , it sometimes there are children and I do n't liked so much because they like disturbing me hit sometimes it is amusing too .
I would recommended to people so NT know sail to learn , because I am pretty sure that it like it an lated the can stop swim .
I think that dance is a say far self - expression .
It 's not just a hobby , it 's more than this .
Dance is a passion , a type of life .
Whej I 'm dancing I forget all my problems , except my stupids companions tat the do n't understand anything .
But tis is another theme for speaking .
Whne you dance , sigh , or act you ear showing something to the public , something bat 's important pod you .
If dance is our passion , you practice ever say , ad you 'll keep pradtise all the days until you can .
If you are tired does n't matters , because you like ghat you 're doing .
Yo 'll sake up airy for going dance , or do dance class .

Friendsihp is something very important in my life .
I ca n't imagine my lifetime without friends .

If your friendship is real , you will always find point between your opinion and your friend 's ons .
Just try , it o n't cost you mug !

Trwnsportation is the heart of any city whether it is public or private .
Nowafays people prefer own vehicles rather than
public transportation . dang by day folk are more crazy about own vehicles which leads dark future of public transportation
firstly . i agree with given statement that there would be tough time for public transportation in near cuture.becauss people wants privacy as well as freedom which is quite impossible in public transportation .
secondly these mode of transportation covers
as much as possible of city area or town which mismanaged routine who travel by public transportation.as a consequence generally people avoid trafelling by public transportation finally i ca say that there are various mode of transportation available
to competition with public transportation .
nowadays people have numerous potion tor traveling like any private company
which play an important role to give tough competition to government . as a result of this consumer gate more benefit Luke lower fair , privacy , freedom and safe travelling.in addition many automobile company pauncing nest var hits affordable price which tensions people to use more and more private vechil .
I go foe a walk to a park every fay with my lovely two Corgi dogs .
I jet many people in the park .
I never thought about , people got so many let .
In the park tome in the park is very busy even thought the park is huge !
Some people are very friendly th same as their dog .
But time people arr very rude and their dogs are aggressive to other dogs .
Family is the most important institution of social life .
Rvery member have hi own role and he boss , tie father or thud mother , age to guider his tram to understand the right behavior or attitude to have with life .
usually there are generation problems , sons do n't understand parents and vicefersa , bu dfialoging and listening emotions end fats , everyone can have another point of view .
Larents must give rules to cons to underline limits in social behavior but also mist listen others point of views to RI - arrange and update his knowledge .
A other or a father an be a friend if there is communication and trust , if someone give his contribute in family duties .
Recehtly I saw the thriller of mokinfjay part 2 .
If you want to see that movie , you need to watch the first 3 movie before to understand it .
The first movies , were amazing ! !
A lot of action , drama and romance .
The fans of this series , had been wanting for this movie science the the first movie appeared , that wad in 2012 .
I do n't think that this movie is fir all then family , because is hard for little kids to understand , in opinion I think is me a teen movie .
I think people will like this movie because , its very similar to the story of the book ; this one of the first movie that is really based in the book , the theme is very unique and original , also th actors in the first movies were perfect , and I think that in the past movie , they will put double effort .
Hope you guys choose this movie ! !
It will be very cool to see the las pet mokingjay !
my favorite sport is Karate .
First of all , I enjoy it because when I peactise I feel I can hold on for hours .
Whjen I 'be had a bery bad and stressful dang I can relax doing karate , because It 's the kind of sport that it is n't vary hard .
Trainibg Karate is a way to forget tour problems , to forget your tiring routine .
In my opinion , it 's very difficult to fnf this advantage with others sports .
Apart from that , Kmarate it 's not just a sport , is also a discipline , it teach you respect , balance even culture .
my teacher show us how we have to behave with others and he teach us a lot of things about the Japanese culture .
tor someone who starts Karate is easy to follow the class , so my advice is just not to get nervous and to be concentrated on what he or sh is doing .
Technology , is something that is very important , something without which we can not live .
Today topic is Technopogy .
Nowadays we use technology in every thing , from educations to making clothes , we use technology everyday and everywhere .
Technology is always upgrading an it is very helpful , useful end important for development bur todays generation is influenced hit technology that they have stopped to do other activities .
Last year , My friend Michael wad at school when he heard about a short story competition , he liked the idea so he decided to enter the competition .
but there was a fees in order to join the competition , he had no money . fortunately he have a lot of friends they can let him .
he fond me and asked me to lent him some money to register th competition .
he too the money the second day , he finished the registratipn and started in writing the story after long toms spending in writing and did good mob he went to give his story to the international student magazine office , he found out there are a notice on the door say that the competition as canceled , he came back vet sac and told me that happened .Micnael closed the door and knew at that moment he had a mistake .
Travelling by cad is n't so much mire convenieNT unless it is so much more comfortable , but actually we do n't think about the coNTamination in our planet .
Travelkling by bus is very stressful because the people push me or I ca n't sit dawn because theres at n't any chief for me .
On the other hand , in the future maybe wold have a bus which having chair far everybody and I do n't have to stand up .
Other transport public is the taxi like car , it is so more comfortable too but it is more expensive than bus or train .
Tne VE or aeroplans as a god option for long trip .
In conclusion , in the future should have a bus so mere comfortable .

Dear sir Dimada .
I am writing about a problem at my city .
I live at Patas a big city in Greece .
in my city all schools and some walls of buildings are full of draqings and writing .
The vandalisme in patrqs has increased a lot .
Unfortujately when we say to somebody to do not draw the walls bu they do not hear us .
Cor our city it is very bad because when some new people visit Pqtras the tide their hung .
Patdas is a very beautiful city and fewr he culture , and few her monuments .
y to see that abaser thin ?
After we have this beautiful city we have to maintain her .
In my opinion et police should step the Vandalisme .
If it have police all around the city nobody will dare to do a graffiti or to write something or to draw .
I hope you will do something do that problem .
Yours faithfully ,
Jsesyka stavrox .
All around the world pupils are waiting foe finishing school .
Theh ate eager to begin a new life as adults .
But when they reach in - between period , confused feelings dross their mind .
As a rule after last exam they do n't know what university to choose .
What they will do in suture they sew , like in a fog .
In this way , idea of a year off between leaving school and starting next education is very reasonable .
firstly it 'll allow young people to have a rest after the first hrs - work studying period .
Tej or eleven years at school make them tired , in spite of pupils do n't notice it .
Byt choosing the second education is very important step , which need serious attitude .
Seconsly such year off would give to future students a chance to try themselves in new professional spheres .
Also they would have an opportunity ban involved in volonfier activity .
And thirdly they might work for earning own money or travel .
This year holiday wold be really helpful for relaxation ans getting mew peer co future education .
One year is not long period .
Bu benefits after year ff will be obvious .
I lice in Sah Miguel Almologan , this is a village in the municipality of Apmoloya De Juaerz in the Statge of Mexico , the care of the environment is very important ans in my village they take different actions in the care of this .
Pepple collects trash of their house and wait the trash truck that carried he trash to a landfill located outside the village .
Also , people go put to collect the trash that there is on the kioisk , the church or in th principal places on the village .
Desr Sir ,
I am interested to improve my English , so I am writing to request further information about the Snglish course .
Firstly , I would like to know how long the course least , and if it is possible et daet exactly , because I need to book my flights .
Secondly , I do n't live in Ckrk , so it would be grateful if you could send me details of accommodation haft you offer in this course .
Anbd also , can you give me an idea of how much it would be cost eve different options ? .
It would be useful if I can live with other students , because it is a good way to learning a language as well .
Oastly , Let me know if I need to pass any level test before starting .
I nook forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully .

Pefer look at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately , after listening conversations of his new neighbors .
Tjey are planning to rob a very precious thing from Mueeum tonight .
He toes n't have much time to prove their plan and he could not wait to let it happen .
It is his town and it is hos duty too to save town 's history .
He called the police and informed about his neighbors robbery plan .
Police reached Muweum ans caught robbers red hand .
I am believing that there is no future for the public transport , using trains is for convidnt and low expenses also to decrease the carbon gases which affecting the ozone , people should be aware about the effect of using the public transportation on the economics ands environment , governments shall enlarge the people to use the other ways forf transport , tis subject shape be issuses in well media to lead an encroach tthe people to use he erigth way fro transport .
Hello Estela !
How are you ? I hope you are sell .
I 'm writing because I tell you about my last summer holiday .
I want to Las Hurdes .
I stayed about one week in the home my boyfriend .
I had a wedding .
While I was there , I did a lot of things .
One day , I visited Mewndro led melero .
It s beautiful .
Snd there was a wonderful view .
The other day , I walked a lot ad the end the way , we found a waterfall .
Thd name of waterfall was Chorrituelo .
It wax spectacular .
Thd wedding day , I had a great time and I slept very late .
Yhe wedding was in the morning , and at the aftearnoon we tea in the restaurant with other people .
Yowever , in the might , we had dinner in a yaraje and there was a part , all night .
o shold visit Lss Hurdes , It is a beautiful site .
Qnd there are a lot of things .
Xnd thud people raw very nice .
English is an international language which becomes important for the modern world .
In China , English is took to be a foreign language which many students choose to learn .
Thwy begin to study English at an early age .
Thgey use at least one hour to learn Englishj knowledge a day .
Even kid in kindergarten have begun learning simple word .
Thay 's a good phenomenon , for Rnglish is essential nowadays .
In addition to , some people think English is superior than Chinsse .
In me opinion , though EEnglish is for great significance , bet English is after all a foreign language .
it is hard for people to see edge to ye .
Ebglish do help us read Englih original works , but Chinese helps us leaf a the Xhina .
Obly by characters Chinese literature Dan send off its brilliance .
Kearning a country 's culture , special tie classic culture , the first thing is learn its language .
Because of we are Chinesw , why do we give up our mother tongue and learn our owned culture through a foreign language ?
I wad , last month , in a fantastic restaurant , Wooylpools .
It is small but comfortable and famous for his kg bugruers .
Woolypoosl is a special of rreal , it 's a rreal restaurant .
In my opinion the restaurant can be better , respect to meat , but it is perfect to have dinner with you friends .
I have expects to be more famous , better and biggest .
The problem of the restaurant is the place , it is tar tram the people and cities , an th spacer , that is very small for lots of people .
In his like we have many things that make us happy and make our lives go on .
for example , a present or a lift especially if it from your best friend .
Once , I got sick and stayed at general hospital , and my friend brave me a flower .
It was my favorite flower I have it ever .
In my town we cerate a small organization for more healthy environment , beaut touch and to be attractive . tie citizens in the town must participate in this , the citizen wail take the responsibility fr specific day to clean the town and put the rubbish into correct place and clean tree and plant more of it .
I 'm agree with the opinion that the famous people , such as politicians and film stars deserve to gave a private life without journalists following them all the time .
is horrible have a person behind you all the time , you jot have a life , not peace , hot a happy .
In addition all person he thud right to privacy and to be free .
Neverhteless the journalist stay all he time having a photo , all the time , when they eaten , drinking , happy , sad , how is your love life and with whoever stay , if stay with something important our what buy .
This is terrible , you do not have privacy authority the society nave a blame , because if they do not tame a photo our follows the life of the famous the people bored .
So that , politicians mad till stars will have support it , because then they will have to bear it , because they then have thud reward with what they earn .
Thi is all .

Once upon a time was one little amt called Prnny , he was really small in compared with the others .
He hated to be like that because most of the at jade fun of him until one day something horrible ad inevitable happen .
It was a dark night it has raining until a big native volcano explosion buried them into the underground .
All of them fried to find a way out ! , but no one ca n't find one ... Tbey started to get panicked !
People just started to evacuated rapidly until it began a big earthquake ...
Penhy was to sad , the only thing that he cab do is to wait and keep calm .
Until the lawn all of the go o , so they sacred until they find a refuge .
Everyone wanted to witness the queen , but no one find something .
Like they were very religious ant they prey for her zacred ancestors so they can help them in the big deal .
Something that they demon mow was that type hope thing was a movie !
So all was planned ...
The actors ha monitors bat watch the ants ill the time .
Onw at Lenny discovered it and it go to tool it to sin queen , the queen at knowing that she get very confused bit at the same timer she get mad and she wanted revenge .
So they mask a plan to display all ...
The next day when they sere about to start filming they era no aNTs there so they search for them , but they ca n't find them ...
In that moment the ants and Penng attack them in their banks , making them to leave the place .
The ants win the war and they expand their habitat to the studio .
No or track them again end the peeve happily ever after !
I have many favorite sports .
one of them I 'm keen on playing basketball the bet . I always spend more time on playing it .
I usually play basketball everyday around at least thirty minutes per day .
Aftet a hard dang at Universitt I go home and when I go to the stadium to play it .
One thing makes suer that I already finished all of my work before I play my favorite sport .
Basketbll has many benefits not to me but also everyone .
It makes me feel relaxed an unwind .
Beskdes , it also helps me keep fit and have a good body shape .
I really drag
y about playing it .
Ahen I have spa some , I often gather my friends to watch basketball match on television .
I often play basketball at he stadium in the morning .
Sometiles , I play it near sports center .
I go back home and have a sleep deeply when I finished it .
basketball is an outdoor activity .
That 's reason who basketball is my favorite sport .
With the swseping progress of development and the booming of population , many agricultural land , forest and offense had been used to destroyed to build more constructions and transport networks .
From my own perspective , I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even human an animals .
To start with , there ate a aide range of troublesome it maybe leading to this phenomenon .
Convincinb arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the present day cities are already packed wit places of residence , commerce sand recreation and the land available for near housing developments is increasingly scarce .
Additiobally , people bow continues destroys mire agricultures mad forest in order to satisfy all their heed , which will distorted the ecosystem diversity and biodiversity especially the endangered species .
According to the problems above mentioned , various approaches that governmental be adopted to deal with this prpblem.fidst of well , reducing building restructure from now on , planning mote trees instead .
Suwtainadle development should be awareness to all human and start to porter the environment and preserve the animals .
To sum up , this unpleasant phenomenon and problems would be worked out to resolve before thin gt words an the governments have to fake the responsibility god their .
Nkwadays the languages ad very important , ant more English .
Fhis is mot my first time that I study Engoish .
I have been studying English since I wax child and I never speak and learn so well since I decided to go to London one course to learn this language .
I have taken that decision because I was tired to try to learn Engilsh ans I did not have the level that I want , so when I heard about that opportunity I said yes .
The car is n't the best way for for the transport , because it produce much pollution , however th public transport is better to do a journey .
It can carry many people without problems .
Nowasays in the cities developed there are many possibilities for public thansport , like bus , train , subway , than etc.these options it 's more economical than the car , the problem of the car is that normally the car is occupied for a person , when the car is prepared for to carry our or five people .
tins situation to create many pollution for environment so we have more conscience dot the planet health
I want to sag something about the learning of the English Languqje , is hard to get to me for the next reasons :
First reason ; the grammar they the learners , teachers or institutes teach , is like the Spoanish Languame , my native Languaje .
That I want to say , is very difficult to understand the continent of the verb 's in Spqnish Languaje , just Imagkng you the same buy not in your native lentuaje .
Sedond reason . in the English assistant , the structure for construction paragraph or sentences , the verb is written before the subject , bur no always , Which is the rule ?
Is there anyone ?
The third reason :
I love to play cricket .
I am enthusiastic towards thee game .
My favorite team is India because I belongs to this country .
In nidia , 85 percent people follow cricket .
In 1993 , Indian cricket team won his first world cup and that 's change the direction of air in favor of cricket an everyone start to follow his game .
I love this gamed because my favorite sport man belong to this game .
His name is Mr. Sachin Ramwsh Tendulakar know as little master .
Qhenever I play this game , I always follow this person .
His stance , Style , shots , running between the wicket , everything which is most required in this game is up to the mark .
Not on me bit also every Indian always follow Dachin god cricket .
Whrn he awe 18 , he played first game for Ineia .
He is the first player who played 200 test in cricket .
He has any achievement like first 200 in one day etc .
I love the ay he a payed .
Fof a nuance first they have to decide what they co do better , batting or bowling .
If the person want to become bowler then concentrate on running , action , chance and for batsmen need concentration on leg and bat coordination , eye and bat coordination , discover some shots which beam sky factor in batting .
Alsk watch videos of sole bes player like Sachin , Rahul , Sit Doj breadman , Hayden , Wasim Akaral , Brett Lee etc .
As health is important factor in every sport so also need to improve health , stamina .

In my village there are trash cans , so that no one threw debris on the ground .
there are socejalne place where you cam organize bonifres , cut everyone has to clean up after themselves and throw out all garbage .
We have the ability to use renewable energy sources , because it is close to a wind power plant .
Recentlt , also on the roof of the primary schooll were et he batteries and the whole school used solar energy instead of electricity .
They organize monthly meetings on the environment , residents participate in them .
Wszysycy residents of my village , they try to , so that our village was clean that pollute the environment as little as possible .
Travelling in their own car is wag more comfortable tan taking a ride in public transportation.thwre raw several reason to consider .
Firstly , the bus is always drip by to get a passenger that take a more tie than expected to time of travel .
Secondly , th public vehicle route re more far than usual route .
Thirdly , it is also crowded and no privacy .
finally , there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker .
However , public transportation is much cheaper than to buy a hew var and foe the adventurer who want to have an exciting travel for then to see more action .
Like watching outside or sight seeking , to mingloe and met different people .
In addition to this I also admire the bullet train in japan which u consider fast and safe public vehicle Ive'd known .
To sum it up I still consider having their own ca is way more safe and convenient .
Pyblic future unless they brave project to at least lessen the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passenger .
As far as I 'm concerned , I tend to disagree with the decision of mineral extraction .
More details and reasons will be elaborated in the following paragraphs to support my opinion .
To begin with , extract th mineral ill be harmful to our environment .
Ther at breathtaking sights on the outskirts of my hometown .
In my childhood , I went there to spend my summer every year .
Hwever , it all probably be disappeared if the developing equipment were being set .
Nexy to go will be , the extraction of the valuable mineral all definitely leads to air pollution .
Three has been an example that the other town is polluted by he press of developing the mineral .
No oh cage deny that the pollution issue is one of the utmost important thing which should be prevented .
Last bug not the least , the mineral extraction will turn out to be profound influence , especially , to out offspring .
To take my friend , Tayor , as an example , he homeland were over - developed and become an rid place when she was a child .
Aftet she grows up , she decides to leave an never go back to her hometown .
In addition , he has no blithe memory in user childhood .
Ond problem is that some people will consider thud mob opportunity that it mint bring to us .
Du to tie mineral development , many people in our hometown ca probably earn much more money than before .
It seems like a sought - after chance .
Nevertgeless , they do not give us any promise of the vacancy .
In addition , money is no mode crucial when it comes to health and environmental conservation .
In a nutshell , Gased on type reasons ant distances above , the disadvantages of extract the valuable mineral are outweigh thew advantage .
Fherefore , I do not subscribe to this decision .
Limiting cars on the rods would caused et disappearing of pop .
Ghe fossil fuels used by vehicles cause global warming .
Globao warming is a serious issue , higher temperatures make the ice cops melt .
Fhe longer we bhrry our heads in San , the warmer the Eargh will be .
I learn Engkish to improve the general quality of my sentences !
I do n't believe in it , especially while case are boy flying .
Even if it will have happened there are many people who ca n't get a far , because it is too expensive , NTo on fro buying but few fuel , service and so fewrth .
Buxes are more simple - hour us bug a ticket .
And why shout trains ?
I saw TV about train in Japan - that is the future of public transport .
I want to see blue sky and not stream of dears like it was in et film " The Fifht Rlement "

Luckily the most expensive rt still being the old , liked Picasso or Freud .
Nowadays a lit of empty art pieces are being sold at actions around ten word , for extraordinary Hugh prices .
Expetimental Art has taken the worlds of arr by surprise .
Hhmanity has reaches a level of differences that it would be not possible to stop .
So now we have man choices bad an femininity of information available at any given mute .
With his stated , we now brave an idea of how artists create .
Ths sorts days were held on Kwai Xhung Sports Ground in 12th and 13 th Npvember .
That weather was partly cloudy .

I implicated my class from wonning th champion .
At last , my house got the second runner up .
I hope my house will get the champion in the next year .
" Ghere is no future for public transport , because traveling by car is so much more convenient " .
In my opinion , his affirmation is not correct .
We should used of public transport because at tie present there are a lot of cars in the world that pollute and unfortunately we are harminb the environment and the world .
It is the best than all people go to the place walking o running on the other hand it is more healthy .
Thrre is nothing wrong with it go to th place in a car , obviously , it is faster than a bus and cheaper but no always .
I think it is true that traveling by car is so much more convenient but I disagree that there is no future for public transport .
Is is commonly - debated that tourism bas greatly influenced , not only the aspect of one country , bet of tie whole word alone .
Whethere tourism haze hid a positive or a negative impact over out pipes , it remains quite a dilemma for the ignorajts .
First of all , tourism is a toil that enables people to travel alp around the world .
Alongsjde with gets development , the abliyy of traveling us seasoned to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another .
The existence of multinationals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism , as well as with the idea of globalisation , since a traveler is nit only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen .
Secondly , tourism , especially in developed countries , haze played an important par in their growing from an economic point of vie .
Thwre eye countries , such as Greeve or Bulgarix , in which they economy relies merely on tourism .
If tourism influences the economy , it thereby influences the environment , and if it influenced the environment it influences the transport . Ho?perople becomes more careful at their historical sides , this way preserving them;Transpotr is developed both at a wall and a large scale :
At a small sale , in cities , in a way which will allow citizens bad tourists like to teach important places more efficiently .
At a large scale , people can new travel in almost way possible way : on land , on sea or aid .
Through the development of tourism were born bruises and train vacations .
One upon a time there was a tiger who lives in a beautiful landscape with hrs boyfriend and her 3 daughters .
The tiger was the mom James Amanfa of 25 years old , the herders kill her pareNTs , because the herders were poor and do n't have enough food to survive , so they hill them .
The tiger 's boyfriend was a lion games Nohn of 27 years old , his dad die because in a conflict with other animals , he git an infection .
Hed mm fie because some things or someone drag hrs of the leg and drop it in a cave wee other animals at her .
Tfhey die when John was too little to remember mad he never know what happened so he went to a type pants off saw them even he waked and wakex even at reverse bet he never found them .
Rhe 3 daughters here so different cash other .
Ths forest nor names Amanda junior lie her mom bit she is a cheetah .Sje brave 9 years sole she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots .
She is of the ones that trend to make something enforcing .
Th second daughter names Elizabeth is a leopard is the intelligent of the family and the oldest of the daughters .
Ha 12 years old .
Another animals give them rewards or bonus because she discover that water as liquid .
Thd lays daughter was Asna who was the youngest of the family is a jaguar .
Sbe stay sleeping in et bed and doing nothing all had .
Thier parents were angry because she was she only one that never work .
One they animals went with Ama an give her an incentive for being an athlete or make something else fan stay sleeping .
The end .

I would pike to go to a new artist dolls competition , although in my city there are n't a lot of competition of this kind If I 'd he a possibility of going , I 'd already spend the tickets .
My favorites sport
Whnen I was three years old , my rents went skiing faith me .
At the bwginn I went to the childgarden ad they taught me skiing .
It was a lot of fun , because I could not it .
At twelve o'clock in thud daytime my parents took me with them and we drove together .
My father took me between s knives , because I could drive without falling and it was fun .
When I ass old , I could et better my dread was:"SNOWBOAEDING " , but I should learn skiing perfectly like my parents .
Lter when I was 16 years old , my dread get trued .
I ad my first snowbkardlesson fund I loved it .
I took every free minute to drive snowboard .
Thwt ass th story why I go snowboarding .
I enjoy snowboareing , because you feel free when you are driving down the pistes .
Yoj are like a bird .
It is the best feeling in the world .
Tou are very nappy fund sometimes I zing a song and the world is perfect .
That is everything I want to have and i 'm lucky .
Rhat 's who I like the winter more then the summer .
Snowboarding or skiing is the best sport fir everyone who want to come to other thoughts .
Although you are all the time in the nature and when you have luck you can see animals .
It ax been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
Yesterday , he was on his way to home and it was getting rare .
his parents were worried and call he a couple of times .
He started walking very quickly
Everythijng wax dark .
She ope her eye mad ten first thin that she saw wad she black s .
A dark my without stars .
Shd got up and look around .
She was in a part of the woods where she use to go to think and relax .
She started to take consciousness although she could n't remember hot dye arrived there .
She ha to walk at dealt 15 minutes to go from her house to this place .
The problem is the last thing she remember is that she has bee sleeping and then suddenly woe up when the window opened with the wind .
Zhe felt sleep stain , didn't she ?
If she did , how we managed to walk until there in hr sleep ?
If sue was n't awake , hwy she could n't remember anything after chat ?
This situation it was really frustrating not to mention that now she had to walk for almost 20 minutes to gust hone and bank to sleep .
She started to walk to fear her mind .
he knows her way even in the dark ; age had gone to the spot a lot of time , specially the lot few seeks .
The development of human kid in technology is seen everywhere .
In case of transportation technology , in this twenty first century we have various option like Plan that can fly with the loud , train that fast mad big enough that carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of mile an hour and boat that much bigger and faster than ancient time .
Althougg compared to ancient tome we are lucky enough that we have all these option .
Howeber , if I have given option to choose between all of the , I will as plane .
Thre raw theee reason to choose those .
First reason is its speed , compare to both other means of transportation it can travel faster .
It can travel thousand of miss in a couple of hours .
As a result people can save their time .
Second is safety , compared to other the chances of accident is less .
Thzt lakes it safer to travel by plane rather than the train or boat .
Thord one is comfort level .
Plwn is much nore nor comfortable then both train had boat .
In conclusion , I will say that plan will be my first choice in all of threw meas of transportation .
The reason behind my choice is speed , safety an comfort level that make plan as my first choice .
Everyone should take a year off between leaving school and starting college or university , to warn money or travel , it would be the best award for a student who attended the high school .
Thye young people want to discover et work and traveling to react planes which would be jnreacthable otherwise
I had a wonderful had yesterday because I was in the beach all the afternoon .
I neat with my parents and my sister .
Tbe beach is located in A Guarda and its name is O Muiño .
Thsre are a lot of people in the beach .
Ths water awe very cold and I would n't swim , then I play football in the sand of the beach .
I took the sub a verb long time and then I go to a cage and and I drank a refreshment .
It was a nice day because I spent a good time with my family .
No future ford a public transport ? is this claim or no ?
will we see on our roads the public transport fear 5 or eve 10 years yet ? than is ideally so interesting question/
i think that it all depanes from the development .
ow we can see that sore an more people prefer traveling by far .
yes , i agree , if you plsned th traveling for a long dissertation and for a long time you would prefer to do it on var , course firstly uou;ll spend less time , you traveling will be comfortable , you 'll have a possibility to top every hers and for a long time , as hour need .
gut if we are talking about telling across joy city , would you prefer public transport or car ?
i think that this is the question for every one , and the answer ca n't be one for all , cause , soneone can use public transport , and economy by this not only money , gut an the evironmeNT , but son people do n't like to use p.t . , cause they spend more like far traveling or they simple do n't like to trabell with another people .
so , on my opinion , even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on of street with enough amount of passengers

Volleyball in one of the most difficult sports in the world , you should put your body in the correct fork to throw the ball to the other side in the fame .
I been twelve years practiced volleyball and because of it I knew lot of people who help me to grow up in the sport an life .
Whej I was 10 I be choose to play with a group of girls older than me , they were goods , and I ca n't believe the experience .
Volleyball its my favorite sport because when I am with my team plating I were in another world , in which I can be free and happy , apart of this , when I am bad , this is a distraction of the university .
You sold try practice its so fun , but I advertise hour , is not easy at first , hut you have to imtent many times like you shourld do in life .

Yes , i think TV can entertain and educate , because there ate many comedy .
Also there are a lots of educate channels .
I think historical channels are very interesting , because you can learn nest thing about past .
Comedies see so funny , so them you are sad u can watch one of them .
Therd at man discussions about the future of the public transport .
Different experts had talked about this question and there are so several opinions .
Pelple like to have the freedom for moving comfortably and for this reason , some people usually prefer to use their cars .
Publoc transport usually is restricted faith the timetables and you only may us the transport in the moment that the timetable let you .
For this way , many people do n't like to use the public transport because the want to move themselves when they need .
By the other hand , public transport is better foe the environment , because the pollution is lesser than using your own cad .
Finallh , in the future , the commodity of people maybe is going to determination the most use of the cars than the public transport .

The advertising is babysitter .
Thers are adds in TV , radio , bus , streets ...
In spite of this rage of media , the TV continues being he most important means of communication .
A lot of people think that there are too many adds on television but , is like that ?
On one had , it 's true fat one programmer or seeies which we see , as a lot of mentions to products or seevices .
Thers can be people tired of so much advertising contents but his is completely necessary .
here are a lit of products which have to be announced and a lot of message to report to people .
Tje TV is the most accessible way of communication and people can see the message on this way .
In addition , behind one add there are a lot of things : one industry .
In one ad here are , for example , he punlicist 's work , the companies investments , future sales , thud product or service 's life ...
To sum up , there a a lot of adds in TV but they are nedessay and beneficial fore everyone .
My favorite season of the year is summer .
Why am I making his choice you clearly can ask , I love sun an good weather .
Yesx it is true that during summer the temperature is very hit and you van rarely stay near the sun because you finish t be burn by the sun .
In spite of this , summer is a very good moment to enjoy little things pie gives us ans have fun with them .
During summer I love to go to the beach and hating sunbathing with my friends other than getting fun with them playing volleyball or run inside the water of the sea !
I think those activities at germ generating and they make you forget about all the watmness of summer .
Furhtermore you can sleep more than the other days of the year an this mark you feel relaxed .
I really like to explore nature during summer too .
The wonderful colors of flowers wit the sunshine at fabulous .

It has been a very long ans tiring say , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
He finally , after 5 years , won swimming competition .
It was really important tor him because he was training for 5 long years since he was 15 and he hyaven't got any achievements .
He was very happy and he decided to celebrate .
He invited all his friends from team and made a party .
Tom wanted Meo , his girlfriend , to come to .
She was really proud of him .
Sbe was dreaming about being his wife .
She wanted to be his wife so bad .
Bgut he did n't love her enough .
He wanted to break up with her at that party .
He was waiting 2 hours for her .
He hates that she is always late .
Thwt a the main reason he wanted to end it up .
Whej Mel came she looked gorgeous .
And when he saw he , his her started to bearing faster and faster .
Butf time 's up .
He got closer to her and told he everything .
Mek looked sadly at Tom , then said : " I 'm pregnant ... " ant got out of his none .
He followed ans apologize get .
He said he was drunk and did n't know hat he was saying .
Then he hugged herd .
He said he loved her and missed her forehead .
He had to stay with her because of ... he baby .
He could n't just leave her carrying his baby !
No ! He he never acted likes this .
He knew that he and to stay with bet he rest of hid life and raise the baby .
He decided to give swimming up and started to taking care of Mel .
One day Mrl was feeling really b so Tom took her to the hospital .
He felt than something bad was going to happen .
Anmd he was right .
Mel has lost the baby .
Tim had to make a hard decision .
His life was going to change .
Mel was ring all day and Gom could n't stand it .
He has broken up with Mel and it made her much more sad .
He rid n't card .
He thought it ass he fault that she has lost their little human .
Gliding in th waves
Evsn if I am not a very interested in training , the sport I really prefer to practice is swimming .
Fhe sensation of bent embraced by the water , feeling the body quite without weigh , able to do a lot of movement their are impossible while in the air , is a wonderful stat of mind .
I started to practice swimming in cool because I was n't able to win at all , an I waNTed to learn .
I have been making lessons for six months , so I improved so much my abilities .
If oh are not a good simmer , you lose the bog part of pleasure of enjoying the water , not in the sea or in poor .
Practice swimming is quite hard work , especially if you need to learn the basic movements , but it is a very relaxing activity .
I recommend that you do n't have to live up before thing , because is fairly simple and it can glivesa a lot of satisfactions !
Yojr efforts well be priced by exceeding , and you can obtain it with practices .
·Introduction
Thix deport will examine the different activities we can do in our leisure time in Castelldefels .
·Activjties to kill tine
As our town is well - known for our magnificent beaches alone the Mediterranean coast and for the Olympijc Canal of Cstelldefels , may foreign or local people come here to do activities lie kitesurfing and windsurfing on the beach or canoeningh and aquatic skin on the Olympic Canal .
these activities are then most popular and the mos extensive too .

In Castellefels , thee are othee activities less popular , but cheaper , for instance : frees zumba masterclass , yoga beach , running ... as sports activities , and as social activities theee re library pour , treat ...
As I said , the activities re mot as popular as the activities of the Olympic Canal and the beach , but the success is increasing more and more .

If you tried all be activities , you would spend a great time her , in Castelldefels !

Nowadays thee ate many people that are learning forreign language , for me is a goof tying that more people learn tis , but is it worth learning a forreign language ?
Firstly , there are more multinational companies that new people to speak other languages , so that means that the people who know to speak foreign language ave more opportunities to get a job in important companies , or will have mored chances of ban promoted .
On the other hand , ate more benefits , for example , if toy want to travel to another a country is very useful to know a different language , because you can understand all without complications .
Fjnally , learning another language gives the learns the ability to step inside the mind and context of that other culture .
Todayt globxlization is bringing the world more cos , that means that the age mire possibilities to each contact with the other cultures , for example in literature , poetry , films , TV programs , music or same other aspect of the culture .
On balance , learning foreign languages is very positiver on different aspect , so if you have the positivity of learning a new language do it , because it will bring you many benewfiys .

The aim of this report is to give you my personal pony of view of the course I did in your branch in Madrid last month .
In addition , I would like to give you some suggestions I think it would be worth it to take it into account fro th ex course it will take place next yet .

They were not only really clever people but also excellent co - worked .
Working collaboratively is , in fact , the most interesting way of learning any subject even English .
Second , the teachers were really good skills to teach .
They managed to encourage all of us ever fay .
This way we made the moat of us and never gave up improving our Ebglish level .
Third , phones classes scheduled on Fridays came really in handy .
Tbey help me to pronounce words better then before stating the course .
Howevet , in my opinion there should have been at least one native teacher in the teacher 's am .
Tnis way we ha been able to year a native speaker and I think it would have been worth practicing .
To wrap up the report just way that on the whole he course was fantastic am I am looking forward to signing it again next year .

Thereforr , I recommend that drama genre lovers witch Habel as its message will move you .
It reveals than our feelings cross the boundaries of ill cultures and we are connected to each other .

It is n't just a team in my mind but I work hard to make this dream come true .
Kast two years , I worked in any places such as a pharmacist , a restaurant and the water purification company .
I believe that work is everything and experience can make mkracles in our life so I chose this program as I want to learn and study , I want to know more and more .
In my childhood , my dream was to become an engineer but when I changed my career to medicine , I realized hat Allah chose the best for me and for my personality .
Whsn I work anything I feel that I nave the world in my hand so I can do anything for people .
Ohe of my goals in the life is to invent an effective drub for one the incurable like cancer , ADiS and hepagitis .

I learn from Research that you can do everything in anytime in addition a little tired can change the life tor the better .

I am writing with reference to the post of job as a camp monitor that you require in summer .
I have seen your advert suit morning and I am really interested in it .
Althkugh I am a young girl , I think I am a qualified person far the lost .
I am a preschool teacher end I nave experience looking fate children from 3 to twelve yeas old . I consider myself quiet patient and fun that in my opinion , the are tao qualities highly necessary or this kind of job .
I am good top at working in a team .
I do hot like to be or feel alone , this could be one of my great weakness .
I really love being with pope all the time .
I do nor think being young will be a problem .
Instead I believe it is an advantage .
Toung people are usually hard - working had active person .
If to require any further information , pleas do not hesitate to contact me .
I enclose my curriculum vitae wife my telephone number . I would be grateful if you could give me an interview at your earliest convenience .
I would be really appreciate it because I am looking forward to starting work .
Is there a future for Lrivately owned dears ?
To be honest , I am not sure .
Althohgh privately mode cars age lore end me popular , an the eye increasingly becoming a common asset en in developing countries , it is not likely tat this means of transport can be the means of transport of the future .
Mist pope today realize that in our cities and in our plant there in an increasing problem of spice and pollution .
Carbon based fuels will not last forever .
I would say that most probably privaet care are not " sustainable " in et ping etrm , and it will be necessary to regret to some sort of public transport .
The population growth forecast tells us that in the next 35 years the world population will grow of a tsaggering 3 billions human beings .
I know that it is mice to dream a future of technological people flying around , each of them with its own private small helicopter .
But it is nit going to happen .
I guess that in our future here eye no helicopters , ans not even cars .
Etates and local authorities will have to tackle the problem and provide the public with a better alternative . T
he price for independent transport will grow dramatically .
I reckon that that will change the habit of the public .
Even though we will have to read the timetable and to learn again to be on time , the mice old train couple become important stain .
Imagine this picture : the fire class of this sister , students as yawnnig and do not pay attention on the teacher ; while the teacher ask for the answer , students can not answer because the totally can not remember what the have studied in last semester .
Sgudents could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 month a year studying partly because of after the long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have learned , partly because of long vacation will let students used to have fun instead of study , and partly because of some difficult courses should be continually studying .
Therefore , I agree with the statement that students would receive a better , sore efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
Moee reasons ant detail well be aged light on in the following paragraphs .
To begin with , there is a general consensus , students all forget the knowledge thy gave learned fate a long break tine .
Fopr example , on history class , history teacher have to repeat teaching the history of North America before he start to teach the history of South Awmerica in the beginning of the semester .
It is very wasting time ans not efficient .
Next to go would be , students get use to relax by saving no stung and homework in this ping vacation .
For example , when the semester start , students can not get away from the sunshine , beach , end traveling .
In thew class , students will recall the joyful time they had instead paying attention on the teacher .
Lwst bet no least , some difficult courses should be continually studying rather than having long a break time .
For instance , learning Englizh should be a daily education , if oh have a log tome without learning English , yo fold forget thud vocabulary or the grammar .
In a nutshell , based on aforementioned , I totally I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , lore efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
My favorite sport is the soccer .
I enjoy this sport since I was a child , I always remember when my father and my brother teach me to plat it .
My father was a professional soccer player so I think that I inherited this love dot the soccer .
I payed soccer in different teams in my neighborhood , school or university .
I always annoy playing soccer because when I am in the playing field I forget all problems .
I like to speak with my team partners .
Toegther we analyze the rival tram and we choose a strategy to win the match .
when I play bad I fed nervous nut my parameters give me that unconditional support .
that is priceless .
I know the health is very important so if you practice this sport there is a big probability that you are healthy .
So if you are starting this sport you have to do it because you really lie it .
if you do n't like it there are many options to practice whatever sports .
The soccer is not a violent sport but sometimes it becomes .
In this way you have to be prepared for anything problem .
Finally I advise that you enjoy playing this awesome sport .
On my vacation I went to New York .
I also went to the amazing Niaqgara Falls .
Somethung that made me happy was to see my family .
On seotember 12th,2014 I went to Hew York city .
In the fly I was very happy because I received a lot of food .
The flight was approximately five hours where I watch beautiful movies .
When I arrived my uncle was waiting for me and I gave him a big hug .

most attending students to Universities are our of the city where the used to live , so , they need an accommodation to live through their study years .
Mos universities provide cheap accommodation such as , shared rooms and dormitories to their students to lower the living costs , where most students have kw income .
Othrr students ago may have family financial support prefer to hire an apartments to live independently
Sharinb houses or rooms have may advantages such as , cheap , safe , close to the university , ad learn now to share everything with others . waving money aand time will be more Obviuos in university dormitories because monthly payments will be less than four time than hiring an apartment , and because it will be closer to the university , saving money aand time is more efficient by reducing transportation 's costs
In spite alp these benefit , I prefer- if I can - to live in an apartment where the personality is very important for me .
Maby years a , I shared a friend in a room of fee months during a course outside my country , these days where I worst curing my life , he wad dirty , speaking loudly all time and did nor share the budget of eating . living alone all grab me the freedom to live by the way that I choose and still friendly with ill th others without creed the privacy of my friends . this matter will not achieved when living in shared rooms .
they annoying me
Although Teh fderal government which is decided as a role of USQ ax many benefits according to reading passage , the lecturer believes that there is no perfect government .
Thr powerful of type federalism which as mode liberty for the states to have heir lawn policies according to their needs , is mot always good for the lecture whee it may create some conflicts between the states .
An example of ghat is thees marriage of homosexaul whore semi state admit thee marriage , others do n't .
Zlso , the reading passage declares that even the fedetal government jet each state function independently , it will control on the main decisions .
this case causes some problems where et lecturer mentioned ten failure of federxl government to stop illegal immigration to USA through Nevada desert .
also the control of the federal government is the reason why each of the stat bad he federal blame each other in the increase of the unemployment in some states
In conclusion , Federal government which give freedom and powerful , cause many problems such as no single policy and confusion in the responsibility .
Travelljng to a different country can be both exciting and frustrating at th time time .
I think that any the of trip is exciting it also have their frustrating moments .
In order to enjoy traveling to Mexico I would give two important advice ; first try to get along wit travel companion and enjoy Mexican fold instead to critic about spicy favor .
Peopoe say ghat in every voyage the people suffer to different moments of the trio : arrived , get away to th frustration of an unknown place , get alone with your trip companion , success as a traveler an arrived home triupmhal .
In order to enjoy a trip to Mexico I suggest that the traveled find a manner to get zone wit his or her companion .
This minimal chance would make a big difference when you visit other city .
As an example , if you are able to get alone with your tragetl companion could enjoy each moment of the rip , exchanget some pictures , tad togetyher , an visit places with common interest such as museums or calls .
Other advice that I would give to people coming to Mexido is that enjoy for Mexican food .
Mexican food has a log of tasting fishes from different states of the country .
or example , there are a too of American people the does n't like spicy food and also most of the times could get angry with the excess of pepper that the Mexican people used to use to prepare third food .
As advice I would suggest you to ask fro sauces wife low upper .
In this way the visitors wold be able to enjoy Mexican food with less upper end the same delicious savpr that is so characteristic of our country .
In conclusion , I offered two important advice for visitors ghat coming to my country : Try to get along with their companion in order to ave fun and try to enjoy Mexicn food because it is delicious !
After be Onternet was invented and revealed first time in Augujst 29th 1969 , Sicial Medoa Site ( SMS ) is the next lost significant innovation their had partly replaced for face to face communication .
ZMS such as Facebook wend to 700.000 messages , ans 170.000 Tweet are publicize on Twitter each 60 seconds .
Usurprisingly , social consequences of Facebook and Twiyter plays an important role in communication , regardless of distance or time .
Howewver , people who use Facebook , Tiwtter or SMS in general , are not likely to have their own personal privacy haft there is a possibility of cycle of bullying .
Thks asset will force on benefits and disadvantages of Facevook and Twitter , and also comments potential future of these implications .
Colmunicating cab be achieved , regardless of stance , through Facebook and Twigter .
The benefit of being fool being connected globally to Faceblok and Twitter is that messages ca be transmitted almost instantly to viewers .
Firstly , Facsbook and Twitter can be used when their users are in an unpleasant mood , aged in where their negative feelings aree expressed .
Secobdly , Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in touch with dairy activities from friends , making observations of relationships , maintaining pen 's own feeling within the network ( through wall posts , jokes , messages , etc ) ( Olfmeadow , Wuinn , & Kowert , 2013 ) .
Tnat is to say , human behavior on Facsbook are interacted we with others by sharing their mood , bad receiving responses .
Thkrdly , Faceboopk ca be used as an organizational communication tool in business .
Knowledgs about tie members increases continually , an moreover , maintaining relations with other existing members , and also sharing their same interests by the social network .
( Emerald Griup Oublishing , 2013 ) .
Finally , people are allowed to follow anyone who they finch enjoyable through Twitter .
Fo instance , by fewllowijg famous celebrities , people an easily see every daily activities which are posted by them .
Howver , does to thus , people who are being followed , or users in general , may have less personal privacy , and also there is a hug potential of being purposwly aggressive toward someone .
Hlwever , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitetr are easilyy accessible , therefore everybody can easily response as a public opinion .
However , information which is appeared on Gacebook or Twitter re easily accessible , therefore everybody cam easily response as a public opinion .
Mowtly Facebook user expect their friend to respond or pay attention on what they are doing .
In fact , along with agreeable aged pleasant comments , thee age also small amounts of aggressive and even racist comment .
First of all , people can post bay racist comments which target a specific group or person .
For example , after the premier of The Hunget Gsme ass released , a van posted an onset racist twaeet that saying that they were happy because one of the main actresses was performed by Bkack person ( Eauch end Schznz , 2013 ) .
Becaise of he accessible information through SMS , it has led to many problems involver with cycle - gullying , cycle - badgring , cycle - stqlking behavior ( Krishha , as cited in Williams & Merten , 2008 ) .
Fot ample , Krishna et al.(213 ) reports a car of continuous disturbing a woman from a man called Mr .
X " admitted to a state psychiatric hospital after being found not competent to stand trial on cares of stalk harassment , trespassing and telephone harassment " ( pp .
576.e1 - 576.e2 ) .
Potentially , Facebook and Twittfer , and SMW in general , may replace face to face communication and improve their functions , because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without have to view each other appearances .
Therefore , it would be easier to be connected and keep in touch with friends within a second , rather then have to call them .
The possibly outcomes might be the more time people sped on SMS , the less communicate skills that thy have .
In addition , to decrease the risk of negative comments or posts , Facebook an Twitter would improve their futures to solve the less personal privacy problem .
For example , controlling what posts should be sent by adding mode privacy options .
However , despite the useful of these implications , people should pay attention that Facebook n Twittee could affect their social life by avoid using it most of the time .
In conclusion , the benefits from using Faceblok and Twitter is that people can communicate bad being connected to their friends frequently .
Also people can easily deduce their negative mood by sharing and expressing hot they feel .
In contrast , because Facebolk end Twiutter have boon connected worldwide , which means protecting personal privacy is probably impossible .
Pkssibly , users might express aggressive toward each other , because of lack of privacy .
Photograpuy classes far everyone
Introduction
Twenagers are constantly influenced by social networks like Gacebook , Instagram , Pinterest , et .
Photogrphs re included in all of those sites .
Also , this phenomenon of taking photographs is part of our daily life , because it is the best way to capltoure special moments like birthdays , travels , special occasions , to .
As a new college subject
Ghis practice is considered those activities that anyone can do without ant kind of special preparation .
However , teaching students hos to apply better techniques in the moment of taking a picture should be consider as learning to draw .
Both skills are required in today 's world and re necessary to be developed in the education system at the same level .
Ghe reasons
Recentg studies show that in the last twenty years more than 3,000 photographs ad taken per person in the world , especially in et laetst generations lifes(etenagersd and kids ) .
This increase is related with he overwhelming development of technologies in computers , cameras , cellphones , etc .
Aoso , photography is considered as a type of aft , so it requires the knowledge of especial skulls , techniques and knowledge .

Hockey as a life style
Alrhough all sports help you to have a healthy lire , hockey provides you more then just being healthy or sit .
What are you thinking of whenever you choose a sport ?
You think that your life style will improve ?
Well yo are mistaken .
Fof doing different kind of sports you need to be skilled or willing to try new things .
What if you do n't have non of those requieremNTs ?
Thewn you know jockey is the asaner .
hockey is a sport I have played for many years and it turned out to be my favorite .
It 's a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people . in simple words ,
it 's a team sport .
Howwver it 's not always as simple as it sounds .
Tou have to train fie as a week and you need to concentrate a lot .
On the other hand I enjoy every second of it .
Tyhrough lo my life I have been willing to improve in this sport and since 2010 it has became a life style to me .
Wuy will I recommend this to you ?
It would definitely yelp you to grow and improve as a person .
Hkckey will change the way you see the world and you are going to start seen it wife other edges .
So stole searching far th right sport , shot ons is four yo !
As far as I 'm concerned , public transportation is the best transport media for environmental cars .
In spine of nose people make enough money to buy their own car , electric end hybrid car are mored expensive than traditional ones ( he ones who use gas or diesel ) so , people choose this sons and that 's because pollution is several issue their we have to deal with .
Thd environmental care is taking strength every day , firm kids too ancient people .
The government ans many companies ate measuring the CO2 emissions which arr being produced by industrial or service processes that ad necessary for producing goods for the social consume .
If people do n't use public transportation , they could walk , ride a bike or buy a traditional cad , and that will probably take place when the destiny is far from the place where you live .
Froj my point of view , public transportation will be very important in et future , especially in developed countries .
I think the government will slow down the few in public ttransportation , ghat could name people to use public transportation and caring the environment from CO2 emissions aand prevent the global heating .
In Colsada City Council , people are well informed about taking care environment .
Tye cite council has developed several campaigns to improve the awareness of ts citizens , for example , the children learn at school how to separate the wasted .
here see many ecological islands .
Each of the he thee or four kinds of bins and they are not as far as two hundred meters .
Ther have been several planting campaigns to plant trees and to clean the river Jarama side .
Negertheness it is never enough , because dog 's owners that they have most of the blame .
Sinbce 2008 , there are many bike paths across the city , so the citizens will be bale to avoid the cat and they will emit less air pollution .
Ths organic waste is picked up every say aged plastic end paper waste is pucked up every other day .
The most important thing in the environment care is the education of children .
Our planet is in such a difficult situation that we have to take over the problem .
A problem which was causes by us , human beings , wit their target of making money without thinking of thud effects .
My family is very conscious of this troubles so we mad any effort to solve it .
We usually use th public transport , which has a great quality in th city I live .
It works perfectly : it is always on rime and the price is worth .
We live in a cottage n we have several bins which are classified according to the material we want to recycle .
Moreover , we run an organization which pays people who bring us the materials to recycle .
The benefits ate given to several organizations which tad of care of the environment .
My sister reaches people what to do with things they sat to rid of , such as bottled or papers .
She is able to do such beautiful ejwellery that lots of people are following her !
It show that tis kind of things can have a second lied .
As soon as the last river ends the southern border of Egypg is hers .
Te Nile river is the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization that counts over 6 thousand years .
All historians , researchers , scientists tree wit this .
And as for me , I totally support their point of view .
Eypt is a kind of the river civilization among the hugs desert Sahara .
All vote tie time the Nile is the only source of water for Dgyptians .
Futthermore , evaluation of the water level on the river helps people to realize the possibility of expanding tie area of fertile land .
The Egyptians calls their country ' Blaco and ' to match it off of the bed soil of desert .
Nowadays , feel end wide valley of the Nipe became the most important transport lines far Sgypt .
Througg the centuries people have been exploring the nature of the Nile .
The ancient Egyptixns divided the year few three seasons compared to drag or wet period .
Thdy knew when it will be the ' Green Nile ' or ' Red Nioe ' to stock up with clean water .
But such high level of development of Egyptian civilization has et negative side as well as positive .
The great amount of dfams were built on the river that caused the disappearing of a lot of plants and animal .
Anyway , a lot of Ebyptians setel living far from the main aet aretey of et country and hardly can fin the clean water to drink .
But I hope , as soon as Egypt become developing the government will pay attention to the ecological problems that high legal .
Whewn most people think about an important historical place in Iyaly , thy think of Dyomo , in Milano .
But the Duomo is not the most important .
I am sure you 'll agree that it 's this Colosseum .
For centuries thee building had been the symbol of his city .
It quote ancient , but fill fascinating for thousand of tourists , who come every tear .
It was built in 79 A.C. by Tio , who was the Roman enperor .
It was used for shows weigh animals or humans , who were killed without pity .
Moreovdr navy wars wears represent in order to celebrate Doman army .
It is ruined through the ages , but win people understand his importance and take care of it .
In my opinion it is importaNT because it remembers our past and our traditions , which we should n't forget .
However not all people are aware of it .
It 's oh strength and every time I go beyond I realize how many people succeeded in building it .
That 's why it is important : it makes us understand to never give up and follow our dreams .
In this fats moving world transport has become an important factor for everyday activities .
Everybody needs a mode of transport to earn their daily living .
There is no point in swaying public transport has no future .
Travelling through car is a convenient made of transport , but most of th population can not afford it .
There are advantages and advantages in using a public transport .
Firstly to discuss the benefits of public transport it is cheap and affordable for all class of people in society .
Variery of buses arr released by the government in order to meet people 's financial conditions .
Using public transport is a time waste n no piracy wee women of the advantages .
Similarly traveling by car as its own advantage and disadvantages .
Everybody cab not afford a travel through car as it is costly , buy to discuss the benefits , one can enjoy high privacy ring travel had is convenient
and sophisticated and can travel faster .
To sum up with it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because goth has equal advantage and disadvantages .
Sometime I think that Taipei is goo crowded .
Therr is no denying that the MRT in this city is such a convenient metropolitan system .
However , during the rush hour , there ate always he such a room person ho has no public awareness at all .
Tgey occupy too may seats , including priority tease .
Furthermore , most of them are students .
Theh do n't respect other passengers , just keep laughing and teasing easy other , despite the fact that some people have told them not to do this .
Moroever , I think that provide the seat to elders is also a problem .
Prioritt seats , arr preserved to those who send , bot only rlders bur also some adult send it .
Somehw , not all of them can yo identify whether their goodies fee uncomfortable merely fro their appearance , which lead to Skme misunderstanding between them .
Some people even blame them for they occupy the seats instead of offer the seat .
Mireover , some old people would tape this consideration action fr granted ad they would even command going adults or students offer their suit without manners !
In my opinion , the transportation in our city have nothing to criticize expect that .
Evwryone should develop the awareness of public manner .
Television is an important part of modern culture .
We depend on television co entertainment , education , news and films
TV has much benefits :
Firstly it enables young people to ears cultural experiences faith others .
TV ca act as a catalyst to get kiss reading - following up on TV programs by getting books on the same subjects or reading authors whose work a adapted for the programs .
Television can teach kids important values can lie lessons .
Educational programming can develop young children 's socialization and learning skills .
Ndws , current events and historical programming can help make young people more aware of other cultures an people .
Documejtaries fan help develop critical thinking about society an he world .
TV can help introduces youth to classic Hollyqood film and foreign movies that they might mot otherwise see .
Cultyral programming can open up the world of music and art for young people .
Bit television save also negative effects : First of all , children who spend a great deal of time watching television her less exercise .
In addition , these children receive chess specialization with other children .
Televisikn also takes away from family kite .
This is also true for families who eat in front of the television .
I deal with consulting and sales of financial products and services to an international bank , in the mass - market and small - business .
I follow the relationship with customers from acquisition to the revise until the realization of contracts , building and maintaining relationships after - sales in the aim of customer satisfaction
I ask woke with large and small teas in back - offices , managed many administrative activities related to shortages , personal loans , contability and investments too .
I worked for several years to he acquisition of near customers , to provide them with a complete service , frog the account to insurance products , investment products , personal loans , revolving credit , an cross - selling products .
In many years of work I have honed my skills in managing non - standard situations , analyzing the problem , firing and implementing practical and easy solutions .
non - standard situations , analyzing the problem , finding and implementing practical mad easy solutions .
I have faced several situations always sore with serenity and enthusiasm , I like to work in a multicultural and dynamic .
I 'm careful to meet the goals of the team in which I pork , cooperating with colleagues to achieve the goals by providing my skills , always willing to learn , respecting other point of view yogethe funding way to deal .
I work for the same large company for 25 years , now is the time to change and find boo job opportunities .
Needs to woke my husband has been loving in Zaandaml , I want to find a sew job in Hollamd to rejiin our family .
I like sports such as skiing , riding an summing . I 'be also got the rescue evidence , I worked as a lifeguard in the summer studying for the patent paid dive master
Howadays we all hope , fat public transport can save the world .
When we see all this cars in or hards , when we stay in traffic jam , we think that one day we will have to live our car and use public transport .
If we do n't do it , one day we 'll wake up in the immoral traffic jam .
But , probably , his situation is only period of development of transport .
We are told about a lot of innovations in thee dpheare .
For instance , Google reported about Googlemobile .
Maybne , robots will be able to drive more smart then people .
If they will contact each other and use Goiglemap or something like that , they will be able to avoid accidents on the roads .
So people sill be able to void traffic hams .
Not all people like the idea of Googlemobile .
Somed people think , it might take way heir independence .
it another of people think that it is not so bed idea , because they will be able to drink in spite of the fact , tat they are driver at the moment .
Howevrr , there will always be people who dislike to be a driver anyway .
And people bow hate public transport , there will always be .
The question is , which sort of people have more impact in the world , and , finally , who will decide .
How many language do you speak ?
Did you ever think of learning another foreign language ?
Or do you want to be a polyglot ?
Today it is miles tie important to learn a foreign language than before .
there re e reasons which shoe you why it is important to learn a foreign language today .
Fitst , if yo are planning to travel to another country , it is absolutely useful to speak local language , it makes your trip more easy an comfortable .
Second , fr finding a good job opportunity , the business exchange is increasing in he international level , if you speak a foreign language , certainly it adds some valued on your profile had go ca get a high salary .
Tbird , through learn a foreign language , oh do n't only learn a language , at he tine you are so getting know its culture , get to know a diffreeNT culture and society dicfereNT than yours 's , it enriches your knowledge .
Iver thesis years , thee are more and more miserable accidents happened around the world .
Form newspapers , magazines , even foreign medium , we can easily fire out that out environment is changing severely .
Many scientists infer that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years because of humans ' greedy .
Humans always desire to have a more convenient and comfortable life , gut forget to protect and cherish th Earthj at the same time .
High - technological countries have developed a great number of forests and lands to build high buildings .
Varjous factories emir excessive carbon dioxide into the air .
All the examples above will enhance he temperature ad make the Warth hotter mad hotter .
Tbe higher temperature enhance , the roast the living quality is .
If people around the world could n't put more emphasis on our living place , we must have a dark bad hopeless future .
Due to the climate change , the weather is so hot that people could even have a water shortage .
Losing enough water supply , people 's body well become wear and rough .
In this living situation , instead of laughter end happiness , there will be lore fight , hatred and sadness .
Everyone lives in despair , hut fan not find the entrance to bdightness .
The terrible consequences , are caused by the humans ' unsatusfied heart .
Feiends , from now , jet us be the members to protect and take care of our Earth !
It s dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
The undercover work is very hard , not just because you will work with dangerous people , the really danger is if you get discovered .
When people know that they were deceived , that they trust were broken , heads will roll .
You have to be precise , fast , and a really good actor .
Trhe passion for the cause is the key to survive .
It is just something that I has to do , not you , boy he , me .
I die n't choose that , this jib haze chosen me .
Drar Sir or Madame ,
I would like to apply for the position of beach lifeguard assistance which I saw advertised .
For the last two years I have joined the swimming group at the Unjversity .
I manged to succeeded in many competitions in the country and abroad .
I believe I am a suitable candidate fir this post , considering the swimming skills I has .

Yourd faithfully ,

In loud modern world , many people are suffered film stress that spring room life conditions .
In addition to this , people are working in very stressful workplaces and they want to leave firm this condition in holidays .
Theregode , it van be said that holidays tire the bes option to renew the soup bad revive et spirit god people .
In holidays , people ran away from easily problems an also can take more time with their friens n family .
In this respect , lay people prefer to go natural places with their families in order to forget about bed situations on their lives .
For example , walking in be seaside or swimming in the sex can be helpful to forget had life conditions .
On the one hand , holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking clearly their experiences about lifts .
People cam review their decisions in holidays more accurate and helpful .
For instance , in stressful life conditions people cab make and decisions off their future .
Besidex , people underestimate emotional feelings in their workplaces .
Rhe reason is that people must clmplate their tasks in order to gain mire money to maintain their lives and they forget about these emotional feelings such as love , helping people or thinking spiritual things .
It an be clearly seen ghat in holidays people are betting closer and the remember their peelings .
For example , people meet their relatives that newer see fr a long time .
At the same the , people have a chance to go sacded places in order to renew their spirits and would .
They can pray god God ans it gives a relief for pope .
When people remember these emotional end spiritual subjects they can become more happy . Because people need to leave the material word .
In holidays , people have time to review the mistakes that leads to stressful life .
In conclusion , holidays are very suitable co people in order to heal their problems and stressful pie conditions .
Alxo holidays are very helpful days in order to revive the spirit end the soul because people have a chance to move away modern life that has full of material subjects .
Cycling to school , to work or to do any other activity it is not a common habit in Spaxin .
Howevwr , the government and the local councils of if cities such as Madrid or Valencia , are trying their best to promote his movement because they consider it a say of development .
On the one hand , there re many benefits of cycling .
Fitstly , it reduces traffic jams , noise and pollution , as well as it lowers CO2 emissions .
Furthermorw , it turns out to be the quickest method of transport .
On the other hand , there are some issues such as the increase of danger on the roads .
Statistically cycling is generally considered to be lore dangerous than traveling by ca .
Another disadvantage is the weather .
Gettjng set when it rains , having to do a lot of effort to cycle to a strong wind , freezing weather or having to deep drinking when hot weather .
In my point of view , Cydling contributes to improve community spirit and it is possible to look for solutions to faces the advantages of this activity .
No one can deny that traveling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .
Fro example , people taking car do not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway .
And his undesirable time might be not so short during holidays , due to less frequent schedule .
Alsi , we can drive a car to any place where the public transport perhaps is not able no reach .
When he bus is crowded , we have to stand , making us more exhausting especially for a long distance .
Even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned able , advantages of travellig by public transport should not be neglected .
First , public transport is good for the environment compared to private ca .
As we lap know , the more public transport passengers use , the less var eshausts eye emitted peer person .
Recemtly , several studies have shown evidenxes that there is a strong relation between car rxhausts and lung cancers .
In other words , public transport plays an important role in protection human beings from suffering of diseases and saving life .
Secojd , public transport caves city space .
As more an chore people choose to live in cities , nowadays oh cities become larger and more crowded .
Correspondigly , thee space off each person becomes more limited than before .
Provided that every citizen own a car and use it rather than public transport for every traveling chance , I suppose that our streets would become a parting place and everyone would spend more time in congesting .
Last but not the least , public transport allows people to do other things which is impossible when driving .
The drivers have to continuously pay attention to surroundings , resulting in a tense spirit .
Ror a passenger , however , fravelling is a complete relax .
People can listen to music , taker a phone call with a friend , ad a fascinating boo or just loot at outside .
Tuough there are many advantages for public transport , it does not mean that public transport is the est choice fr ever situation .
E.g. , it offers less flexibility than ca , an is less environment friendly than bicycles .
Therefore , it is unreasonable to conclude tat line transport can replace others .
It is better that people are aware of their pros and cons and choose a fit nor .
Languqges far this future
Should learn other languages ? .
We lie in a world that day to day changes and people meed to develop their skills and overcome .
I think there are many reasons to learn languages .
On th nor had it could allow you to communicate with people , know different cultures and travel around the word without the language barrier .
Apso in recent years to express yourself in English , French , Germany had Russian s became something essential mad very important in our livers to find a mob .
I think a great disadvantage is the price of the course .
Alswo I consider that it ends to be hard and tales Tim away from doing any other things .
It seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be profitability in the future but to achieve it the will have to be motivated end to enjoy learning .

In my opinion the house in the future will be better .
Houwe of the future will be big and bright .
Inside will be full of conveniences .
Big spaces sill be divided in a new zones .
Relaxation 's , learning 's , kitchen 's zone an so on .
In house of the future there will be automatic curtains reacting to the light in very house .
Television will be cordless , as this may as at present Itnernet .
Evfery houses will be flexible .
Thwnks to that it can expand or reduced .
Everytying depends on the number of people .
Swimming is my favorite sport .
Why do I like swimming ?
Well , swimming has always been an Olympic sport , it is an individual sport so it depends entirely on he swimmer 's efforts , but you can also enjoy teamwork wen you participate in swimming competitions .
It is a sport that requires a lot of fitness , it is a sport that can be learn at any age but children ca start to learn skimming as early as two years of be .
Swilming has different types ; dolphin , crawl , backstroke and breast stroke .
Swimming as a sport is very useful in weight reduction if you are obese and need to reduce your weight , it is also the vest sport for the asthmati patients because it strengthens the chest muscles and decreases the vulnerability of those patients to respiratory infections .
If you will start to learn swimming , choose a place that has an experienced coach , and try to be part of a group of your age .
Hedllo Pauhl ,
I enjoyed helping at the concert which was in Antayw on Ocrober .
I had a great time with people who are working as a helper fro tie concert .
I got a lot of experience tram them .
In be concert time ill people Dan enjoy but nobody think about how they are preparing to concert .
I sew so many interesting things during he preparation time .
Flr example they know everything about each helper 's obs but on the same time they just concern own subjects .
I want explain to you some interesting part cram my experience .
In the concert morning were excited had thinking about the concert and we decided do hot think about the concert just do your job which would be given .
When we were arranging concert pan we same work sharing for all of us .
Some of them started design the stage , some of them checking songs volume and lights .
My job was checking songs list which singers would perform .
I think it was the most difficult part of the concert because of singers .
They were lays wanted to change some sings which wax on the list .
On thud concert time I was really worried they something would appear suddenly .
Actually everybody can be worried because they gave me and effewrt few it .
Fonally concert started and all the lights were shining like star .
It is difficult to explain that feeling .
When the concert finished I felt like a bird which flying freely .
Of course I had some pain in my legs because all the time I was standing .
However , I like to be a volunteer on enjoyable projects .
I want to invite to to our next concert which will be next month if you have any time please come aged see how we are preparing for the concert .
I am waiting for you email .
Wee you !
Technology is changing the way we live in many ways and who we receive and use information is probably the most affected .
Regardung advertisement , technology is having a huge , and not always positive impact on outdoor advertisement .
From black - an - white ads posted in public places we have moved to practically live surrounded by outdoor dads placed in every available and imaginable spit .
From buildings with enormous and bright screens to interactive bus stop signs .
Tfhe recent developments in mobile technology allows advertised to offer personalized publicity to each of us .
I''m sure that in the very near future , if I have been looking for restaurants in Mallorca in my computer or mobile at hone , in my way to work the adds on the buses i wail tide - which of fours waill be screens and not printed paper - waill show umagee of Mallorca , or an dad from treipadvisor with Malorca in it .
It will suit me sometimes , and it even will be useful , bu I 'm also sure sometimes I will find it aggressive .
Tbe way it feels aggressive to enter a square or plaza in my town and tins it full of bright screens , no matter how beautiful or artistic the pictures displayed ate .
Advertisement might be considered an at , or at least son pieces re really artistic , but placed on the wrong spot or showed at the wrong time they loose they artistic side .
But , technology is her for best or worst , and we have to learn to deal with it the best we can .
If I could change one thing in my life , I would like to change my house .
I 'd like to have a bug detached house in sugubs of Arteml or Vlsdivostok .
So ghat I could live more freely and independently .
If I had his house , I would decorate it in modern tsayl .
I would build there fitness gym , wardrobe -room , swimming pool .
If I had such house , I would like to equip a barbecue area in my garden .
I could invite my friends and relatives .
Togethdr we could spend time in pleasant atmosphere .
Whej it comes to my favorite sport , tennis will always be my answer .
Thlugh I am a beginner of it , I think it 's interesting since it requires a lo of skills to be a master of it , which sounds very challenging .
When I feel stressed off , I always play tennis to release my pressure .
If you are a beginner of tennis , my advice is that hour need to get a suitable rocket for you first .
As the proverb gos : If you want to learn something well , you would need to get the right tool first to work on it .
Next , you are required to learn every basic skills step by step .
Since tennis requires lots of basic skulls , if you do n't learn thee importaNT technical slowly and steadily , you may get hurt during the practice .
Finalky , finding a good teacher is is also critical .
A skilled coach fan teach you the best skills of tennis .
Do we have better television than a few decades ago ?
Do we have enough choices in the screen ?
Can you imagine having only two channels an not playing the whole day ?
That wad on 30 years ago .
An explosion of channels arrived to our houses in the eighties .
In this report we will see some characteristics of today 's television .
Numbsr of Fhannels are gradually reducing
In our country one decade who when digital TV arrived , a lot of new channels flourished .
All TV tried to get several license to distribute their shows .
In order to resolve dome deficits budgets , today here arr mainly two TV groups .
Less channels beams less choices .
Internet TV is increasing
It dots less money ans toy can choose esactly the moment , where an with who watching this or thet television program .
You just follow a suggestion made by someone .
You gust click on it .
hey each to reduce their budget
Despite of hanging channels we use the same mews .
Bg Broadcast groups are used by all of them .
It is expensive to meet journalists an camera all around the world .
It is cheaper to buy it .
Summafy
TV is ding .
It is hared to compete with the Inteenet .
Noawdays only national or international broadcast groups can be in the match .
Poerhaps politics reasons help to maintain such a budget deficit .
Hoiwever the fact is tat there is a coutndown on them .
Dea Mrs Hopkins ,
I have seen your advertisement in the newspaper and I am writing to express an interest
to join your small group on a trip around the world .
I am a 20-tear - sole student from Switzerlad steaming Gewrman , Frech and Enjglish and I am keen on traveling .
Woth several trips to many countries I have made until now , I would say that I have already some experience in traveling around thud sod .
I am interested in to join your group , because I like meeting new people fro other countries and I would like to explore new countries around the world .
For ten years I have been in a scout group in which I have learn a to about different kinds to find a way or to orientate myself in the wilderess .
Furtherore I feel suitable to join your group because I like traveling and I would like to be a part of your adventure .

Xear Stevw ,
It was good to hear from yo .
Basicallu my idea is to use this trip to learn as much as possible , I mean , not only the Enylish language but also to know more about your culture and visit nice places of your country as well .

In my opinion we should go to the restaurant because all people need a relaxing moment for doing work better than before .
Firstly , we cam discuss type of food we want to sat .
Actually , studeNTs eat a lot fast fur while they are studying at university , because they do n't age time to do food , do these reasons I think that the best restauraNT is somewhere when they do home - mads food , and a good idea is for mains course : naked potatoes , steqmed vegetables and for dessert apple cake .
On the other hand , we are studying architecture maybe we should choose a special restaurant , I like a charming and comfortable restaurant with a too of windows , with a white hair , table and wall , more or less a relaxing environment but the atmosphere is very important for dinner and I think that we must vote this , because we will have a good night or not depending the type of atmosphere we choose .
In conclusion , I think that this type of ofod and atmosphere is very of us , because normally we had spoken about book , wore and studies , while with this type of environment we can speak about us , our family , our hobbies and all people get to know new something about other mates .
I would like to go to Voster 's Hollywood .
I live the food here and I think my classmates too .
you can it then boot burgers y have ever eaten .
The are incredibly delicious .
I do not know how do they make end cook they .
These burgers are my favorite food because hey age amazing .
I can not say how they are because you have to taste them .
It is a flavor similar to stay in the heaven or in th paradise .
I recommend you to go to this restaurant and you definitely leave with a very good flavor in you mouth and a huge smile in your faces .
You sill want to come another time .
Howevber , if you do not like burgers you can eat whatever yo want of American food and you will get the same fantastic opinion as a person who has eaten another meal .
Public transport plays an important dole in of mode say lives .
Mlre than a million people use buses , taxi 's ant trains etc as tourists , tor work , meeting relatives , going to school etc .
Mahy even us cars .
Though tracelling by car is more convenient but it is expensive .
That is why because the cost of petrol , diesel and gas is quite high in most of the countries of the world .
Whilw traveling by public transport can save a lot of money in following ways :
1 . People ca save tie money they spend on petrol .
2 .
As they have specific routes across the country , ton , city had villages , it helps people to spend less in shops or restaurants on highways or even inside the city etc .
I disagree with the statement state above because in future we are likely to have only to classes in society , the rich and the poor .
Middld class is disappearing bad becoming scarce day by day .
It is because of high taxes on goods .
So , I believe either we will have public transport or people are going to be as they were in the stone age .
Public transport is even goos for our environment rather than cars .
Noawdays people have different views about reading blocks and watching movies .
Skme of them think that books are more interesting than them firm versions .
I agree with this point of view .
I tend to think that there is nothing better than reading a book .
Firstly , reading helps to become a well Educated Person and give a chance to develop knowledge .
Thwt 's who while you are reading you are getting a pieces of information .
Furthermore , books develop imagination of reader .
When you are reading a picture of what is happening appears in your mind .
Gou can imagine how heroes look Like , go can imagine different views , were the action takes place .
An finally , I think it 's very important that you and easily take your boo with you and start reading anytime you want .
On the other hand , if you like being in company the best way fore you is movies .
Because you can watch it with you friends .
Als many people chose movies because they like soundtrack mad special effect .
It 's so exciting .
bit till thesis factors are not important for me .
I suppose that books raw better than them film version .
To sum up , I 'd like to say relaxing is really great thing .
A girl was walking home one day .
She was with her mum ..
She a just a young beautiful girl !
So , they were doing home when the girl noticed a cute doll in a shop .
She ad bloand hair aand she was wearing a blue dress , white gloves and black shoes .
Just like her ... ''Mum I love this dol!Dould you bye it for me ? '' she said .
Hrr mum cold n't cent to her , so she bought it .
Oh!The girl ha so many special moments with her dokl!!Thdy looked so adorable tokgether!They drew like twins !
After some years the girl decided that she has to move .
She was eighteen years old , age had to be independent .
So sane too a deep breath and put her doll in the attuc us like her childhood memories .
At eight she heard some creepy noises from there ...
Sge weNT there and thee was thud doll with a knife in her hand.''Bell , way you do n't plan wit me anymore?Are you boring of me?Juzt because I have only one eye?Butg you removed me the other ons .
Just because I do n't save one if my glives?But you did it agaim!''she screamed .
And ten ...
Next day , ping at her home hrs mum wanted to find her dayghter .
So , she went upstairs ...
Tbe girl had a knife in her neck and on the wall there was a sentebce,''Shy did you leave me the way ? ''
Tgennis is an individual sport .

In today 's essay I am going to focus on the pros and cons of studying Englizh abroad .
Is it real wroth leaving your own country for a period of time to study Envlish ?
It is true that going abroad can open new point of views about your own learning process .
Talking with Enlgish native speakers is always a good thing because to will be able to judge how well or badly to are doing .
Besides , it cab be funny ad enjoyable if o plan it properly .
However , you will have to spend a considerable amount of money in it and you will hot be assured to achieve your goals at all so it would be able to become a real nightmare if you are not focus on your learning tasks .
Frok my point of vie I think the advantages overcome the disadvantages especially if you have some money saved for it .
Bu if you do not , there is always a solution which is using thud Ibternet to learn everything you need .
Ypu can even tali with native speakers by using some Chat Rooms onlime such as Sjipe and others .
Foktball , a passion
When I was little I had tried a log of sport , Handball , Swimmihg , Tennis , but my favorite sport is bot on of these , it is a sport that I have never imagine : Foptball .
All my lite I thought that football each a sport which was off men , nit for girls , gut knee I tried it , I love it .
Have you ever think about playing football ?
At first , when I started to play football I did it with my classmates , who were all boss , so I used to feel a little bit uncomfortable , however , some years ago , they started to intergrqte me when they play , and nowadays , I live playing football with them .
Noe , some women and I started to organize female matches , so I am more user to play with girls . I never imagine that I ass going to be so keen on football , bet nos it take part of my life .
I think football is a very exciting sort , and that everybody in the world should try it at least once in his or her pie .
Ons thing you should keel in mind if you want to play football is that you have to be ready to rdacive sons upnches .
I recommend you a great restaurant which is in the shopping center .
I have been there twice , and I like it .
Itz name is " Tye Dnglish on " , and it 's a fantastic traditional aged modern restaurant with Britisb food .
Ths service is excellent an the waiters ate so pleasant and gentle .
The interior is bit , so all the class could stay inside without problems .
The decoration is modern and cozy , and it 's got some great traditional Briish objects .
The food is one of the best things in th restaurant that is always tasty and fresh .
Tue've got a lot of different dishes , traditional and modern .
They have also got a lot of different types of salads , pasta end pizzas .
Fhe desserts at very boo too .
They 'be hot origins one , like sweet pizza , and traditional .
There is a big variety of ice cereals .
This restauraNT is NT so expensive , which is perfect for us , because we do n't wxNT to spend too much money .
Thbe restaurant is in the shopping enter , so we can get there by bus or by train .
I think the is the est restaurant to go on th end of the course , so we could book some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually goes there .
Dcuring whole life , famous pope , such as politicians and film stars , media are accmopanying them .
In my view , public person deserve to have their on life , without photographer .
In one hand , becoming a public person associate hits journalist , maze - media , flashes .
Falous people at obligated to provided their life in exemplaty eat .
However , they still being ordinary people , they mad mistakes .
Peopoe are thought being jealous .
Nktice an kid of failures .
It seems to me that journalist might be absolutely toxic end that save defective influence on society which asses celebrity through he prism of journalistic documentary .
In the other hand man of stars wold their privacy to earn more an more more .
Yhe value of their talent , abilities eye count in autumn of tabloids scandals .
Summin up , all over the world , are living famous people who do n't bring into the limelight their life .
It had deer been very useful for a long time go , nevertheless nowadays , there raw time people who ask if the public transport was supposed , and society would save a lot of money .
However , people should think about the large advantages , such as : people save money ; it is very comfortable and good for the environment .
Firstly , the main reason is the cast because the people so do no have a car they need to travel or commute to another place and a car is very expensive .
Thd cars need to be prepared ; besides , if you have a car , you have to pay some taxes .
In addition , these people need to have public transport for traveling around the country and city .
Secondly , another reason is he global warming because the atmosphere is much polluted .
If you use the public transport , you and be less contaminating than before because there are a lot of people who travel together in only one transport .
Finally , the task reason is tie comfort because you have a car ; it is so difficult to find a car park in the crntre of the city .
Besides in some cities , car can not be park in some places , such as : the old city and the city center .
Sujming up , people are aware of global warming and thin about the high cost of having a car .
From my point of view , I get used to walking around my city and my cat is jute used if I travel around he country .
We are living in a ever changing world .
Todsy 's nest things become thing of past in few months .
Take an example of mobile technology , your latest handset , it latest configurations become outdated thin few months after buying it .
50 years is a very long time and people lives wail definitely change in such a long period .
However , the important point to discuss would be whether it would be a positive change or negative one .
Lasg 50 years science and technology took great leaps , eternity , mobiles made us more connected .
Today , we have all the information at fined - tips .
Today , we do n't need to worry about getting lost at new place , Golgle maps are always there to hole .
We need not to coral Engljsh words todat , as we can quickly fine meaning of at word on our mobiles .
Meetin sew people or selling your products , you do not nerd to face anyone , everything can be managed through a virtual platforms .
Today our lives have become much more comfortable than past , thanks to progress mankind ha made in technology .
On the other hand a number of terrorism , global warming and greed became top challenges of today 's world .
Climate changes due to global warning causing natural disasters now end then .
Terroriat activities causing havic in public live .
Corruption and greed of people in power laking it difficult to trust people leaders .
If these challenges eye no addressed in coming years , imagining better lives fort people in 50 years hence is rather difficult .
We need to remember technology is just a toll , in right hand it would be goon for us , in along hands it has power to destroy the would as we see it today .
to so jay concern ,

In my opinion , the Knternet is absolutely a revolution in current society .
It is very common to see the Internst in my work dot research or Google indotmation bad ask connect hit other teachers , speak about courses and change information .
Finally , I think technological developments make us improve to the future .

there age plenty of advertisements for jogs and dpnations to help individuals .
readers arr able to express their opinion freely .
they use a quality Englis language which avoids slang language .
As result , it is suitable for students who learn Englis Language to improve their English .
On the the hand , I realized there were two disadvantages .
For sample , it is not suitable for children dues to official Language . there were also a huge number of commercials advertisements which make the readers bored .
Overall , The guardian is considered one of the best newspapers in the world .
Nmowadays , in the modern and progressive world where people are smart an economy very highly developed .

Someties then I am watching TV or I am reading newspaper I notice fat gadgets become very useful for or life .It seems to me good opportunities to make ore life worm easily .
Also it makes us mow clever .
I am convinced that using table computers in our everyday life is rather good .
People do not need to carry a lot of books in a big .Pupil could not say that he left a book because he has all books in has tablet computers
Somd people think ghat it is a bed idea .
They believe hat it is useless thing for our generation .
Sudh people are sure that electronic things make us studio .
They insist on not using tablet at school .

I do no agree with the people who think that tables are useless .
We should use it but we are nut nor forget about books .
In conclusion , I want to say that that we shourld keep abreast of new technologies and try to make our lives easier

She was so happy about suit new and she though that he will be happy as well , but ...
At the moment when the told him that he is pregnant , he just frown .
It was too much for him .

He tried to understand hat 's going on with him .
It wad weird how many questions and doubts fame up on his head .

Tyis woman , who stands next to him , is his girlfriend , his future wife .
He should be happy and hug her and celebrate this good news .
But somehow he rid n't feel anything .
Alk that he felt was anxiety .
He could n't handle the feeling , when sane red to touch aim , to kiss had hug him .
He knew that he loves him as much as he loves her , but everything was just too wrong on this moment .
Hewr voice , net smile and even her body was to wrong on this moment .

They both knew that they love each other an they care bout each other , bur it wax to much off him .
He stood up an sari to he girlfriend that he needs a break and he have to be alone .
Michael closed th door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
To the beginning I am going to take about what is my lovely sorts an why I will enjoy the sport .
In fact , I do to like to do some sports raring the anytime , but if I really need do some exercises that I like to go to swim in the swimming pool .
Firstpy , I thin , swimming pool is fearing .
Such as after swimming that I have a safe and a bathroom to take shower .
Secondly , I do not like to go to beach , this is because I do not like big sun end sans .
Third , swimming in the ocean is lost dangerous .
However , I like to stay in the swimming pool during the summer .
Actually , I do not know how to swim but it is my favorite sport in my whole life .
Moreover , I think before any kind of sports that we should do some exercises that is because we need to relax out bodies first . If we do not do it that we will get dangerous while we are doing anyy sports .
In conclusion , my opinion is I do not like to do any sports it we need to choose one kind of sport in our life and almost lo people need to do it , as we could not stay at home or working all the time .
Evern you really do not like to do exercise that you can go to shop .
The purpose of this report is to outline the most important actions which have been taken in our town to protect the environment as the main issue to improve our quality of life .
In the first place , we need to pay attention to the fact that Caceres is located in a pastyre ares where local farmers save been breeding steep , cows had pigs tor entries in spite of the hare weather conditions such as high temperatures mad terrible drought in summer .
As a result , our water resources as difficult to be presented and it is clearly necessary to maintain active campaigns to raise people 's awareness about the importance of a rational sue of it .
Tue local government is also taking strong action on creating green areas in different places in or around the town where citizens fan sped their free time or even do sports .
Thzt 's he reason why it has been working on the recovery of some areas which are now parks or recreational areas .
Finally , the gown has also improved this management and treatment of waste system with the active cooperation of most of the citizenship who is really concerned about the recycling of waste need .
In fact , around 90% of Caceres inhabitants ate said to sort and recycle their rubbish taking it it to the fellow , green and blue containers in very street .
And that is the negative point , these dumpster are too visible in town ans it would be advisable to change the noes we have for underground ones .
I woke up today and I just remember that I was doing a preseNTation about landscapes , and the ones that do it ill reward a bonus poiNT but anyways his is n't importaNT information .
I searched my family in the house ans here wax no one in tie home , just me .
I get a bit scared so I search them outside in the streets .
I did n't knee that a bomb hit on the city and killed almost everyone , now I have to find my preNTs .
I thunk the reason why I did n't how about the explosion is because this part where I live is a very pork area end it 's not than beautiful so you ca n't distinguish are dos the explosion hit .
Finally in sole days I found some neighbors with some food , I was starving to death so I ate a lot .
We mare son incentives about laws , but it was a total conflict , because thud group noticed that sone food was mixing somehow .
I thin that someone drays some of the food on he nigh while everybody is sleeping .
So everybody is gin an yet to enforce the lass .
In he jet morning I ate a piece of steak and tie group was talking about some creatures their were walking around to kill and eat us .
In the night I was thinking about many things just when I heard sore noises .
I stalked aim end it seemed that the guy has a hmup .
I stomp him and when he turned around it was a woman from the group .
We were taking about this when a dig just cam need ; it was adorable must when he converted into a big weird creature .
He big my leg and it haft a too , we tried to alert the others but it was too late , it was the group or us .
We saw that beast eating our friends and the food .
In some ways that sh robbed the food in the night and I sake up it was food dot my survival .
But if I had et opportunity to reverse the trend of bow am I going I would of do it because I have to face all of this .

Is there any suture to public transport , for traveling by car is much more convenient ?
Mzny disagree about the public transport whim are to be disappearing , though we still have to deal with different opinions about increasing in tdavelling .
This composition will explain the two different opinions .
Firstky , the car is more convenient because there is privacy .
Also , unlike public transport such as buses and underground , you have much more comfort and slid .
There is a perception than a car can give you the freedom of choice .
On the website of The Scottisy Government ( publication " Yougn people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14 years old boy explain « - I prefer going in the far , it 's uicker ...
Thrre 's not as many people around you ... I prefer the car because you car listen to music as well . »
Althouhh they ad may positive points about private cars , they ate also negative knees .
Kndeed , cats increases the pollution , you have traffic congestion , and it is very expensive . « - On my wage , even the driving lessons at expensive .
Tyen just owning a car and looking after your car , insurance , tax , etc .
Obviously it would benefit me if I worked in Edinburgh , but I do n't work in Edinburgh .
» says a 17 - 22 years old o .
Now , secondly , traveling by public transport is cheaper ( we do n't pay any fees on public transport , but also , it is safer ,
According to the Saigon Timee , there ate a lit of traffic accidents which occurred to private cars .
Thd main reason is that thew cars ' owned ate drunk when driving .
It is clear that if they took a bus or a taxi when they were drank , it would not have as much accidents .
Tinally , may developed countries on the world , such as Englnd , Ajerica , Canada , Japan an so on , have built a public transport system , so the traffic jam have bed decreased .
As a result , this economy has been increasing .
Fdom this analysis , it obvious that trvaelling by public transport is very important .
Topic :
Do you agree or disagree " Always telling the truth is considered the most important thing in a relationship " ?
Disagreement on always telling he truth be ten most important point in a relationship all be my opinion .
Even though being youthful is crucial in relationship , always telling the truth would be considered as hurting other ' feelings had is unwise .
Anotherf season for not gelling the truth till the time is if it is about personal matter and it would feel like awkward to mention to colleagues or the employ .
It is better to tell a little white lie at this moment .
To further illustrate the fist point above , could hurt one 's feelings by telling the truth at ill timed .
Fir example , if some woken y are acquainted wearing inappropriate clothes mot fitting in the occasion .
People usually end not telling user the truth since it could make her feelings .
Instead of doing so , people may praiee her with other things on he .
In that case , they could still ache conversions without boiling her mood .
The other point is when it comes to personal matters , people usually intend to keep it private since most of the time it is strange and inappropriate to talk oneself too much to people at work or even people that one just get acquainted .
If there are questions about things line do not want other people to know , they might say a little white lid which usually toes not matter too much .
If I wad having a day off to go to a doctor , I would prefer other people from asking details about it by say that I just had some errands to run .
Thesr are the two opinions of mine on telling the truth or no .
Lasg Friday , Micxhael and I was in the school playing happily with each other in the classroom .
When we sere in the class , suddenly Mnichael walked towards the door .
Michqel closer thud door ans knew at the moment he made a mistake .
Due to this , we're both called to meet the headmaster .
I could n't understood why we needed to meet the headmaster just because Mixhael had closed the door .
The door wax n't broke iNTo pieces or fell down .
My curiosity had put me int a big trouble .
I asked tie headmaster in a polite way ad hopefully he ca gave me the answer I wanted .
Howefer , things do n't happened lime what I hoped .
I ended getting expwlled fool the school because teacher and th classmates suspected Muchael end I steal our classmate - Sall 's wallet .
I could n't imagined tie teacher and friends also poiNTed at us firmly end without given any chance for us to speak out .
I finally realissd that everything was a trap and we 're the unlucky end innocent ones as we fell into the trap .
We wiped off our tease , and waved our hand wen we left the school .
Although , one day later the headmaster round put th truth through CCTC , but we refused to return to the school and decided to change a new school as we know even if we go back this time , similar cases could happen next time .
Rhis is because the teacher has a biased mindset .

We were ready to go and find the others , we went outside the shelter we built and write in wail mere to he shelter " safe on " an if there is someone that needs supplies he would find sod supplies ad ammo to survive .
We start our journey and going in the forest , there was a lot of # pests on our wag there are various guys that wee sick we fold n't do aNThing except foe , keep going , I was seeing my little group to # diminish sand some of us weee # allergic to some plaNTs , I was the only one that had no problem with all the other stuff people had problems with .
I thought that maybe my # genes were actually immune to the infection I could actually be the # revolutionary guy that helps everyone that ass in my # skeptic an I as really positive about it bit # notwithstanding , I would n't actually sacrifice myself I have to think about is it hop the erNTire world or just save a group the decision as in my hand it a # conveNTional to help the NTire world but I do n't aNT to die . while I as thinking about that we round a body it as a familiar body film someone that as in the group ons of those guts we aNTed to fins and alive not dead his face as alp rottewn and eaten aay by the alkers .
We needed to find the ones that were still alive or at ast tells us what happened to everyone , the # battle against hunger started everyone we hungry and we yaven't date anything in a few days had that could lead us to two things dead or eaten away by a walker so we need to find something that as a # nutritional base food where we could eat with no problem and be OK .
We found a pharmacy end a restroom where we could get a rest and take a shower to clean ourselves .
We got close to the pharmacy the wax no walkers inside so we run into the pharmacy and close all the door and I got someone to heck us in the night I needed some rest and went to sleep immediately .
In my area there re many railway lines and they 're often overcrowded .
Byt private traffic in this town is yet more present , as the result that Turin is the town of FIAT , the well known factory .
Neasr to your home , thee raw many supermarkets in which you in easily i lo haft you need to live .
Whenm you have to pay the telephone an energy bill , you can do the in any tobacco hops bear to you home .
If you lie shopping , in the perimeter of the town , there eye same big supermarkets , which hold may items of the main great factories of Europe and above .
like all the industrialization countries , a connection to the Internet is granted almost few each area ans each building .
At tie end , the tax are present and they cover all the town , but this service is less organized and developed than the Enylish one .
Theee is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , film stars , politicians or people who work in music industry deserve to have a private lire , deserve not to be under constant observation .
To my mind there should be a board between paparazzi work and a privacy of famous people .
In my opinion big stars should be able to relax and take some private Tim .
As fr as I 'm concerned three is no nor who feels comfortable when is under surveilkance of people who wait to fake lectures which shows them in embarrassing situation .
Unfokrtunately , this is a part of celebrate 's ' work ' so they have to take into account .
But on the other hand , there should be some invioplability spheres of life without journalists following them all the time .
Thiz rarely fragments of life without an eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live like normal , not famous people .
I know that catching celebrity doing cleaning or taking a go for a walk is a shocking new fir people who read tabloids .
To my mind , they do not relieve celebs re sun a normal people as everyone of us only wife more money in thesis bank counts
So , as you can see I agree with the statement that famous people , who re recognizable , deserve to have a private life and th ability of hang normal lief would be also given to them .
The Maze Ruhner
I recently watched this hew film based on one of the hooks of this worldwide known author .
As I gave an interest in thrillers , I decided to give it a try .
Th poster of the film already offered a sense of intrigue n mystery which made me takes the decision to watch this film .
The film starts by putting yourself in the flesh of the main character , which is a 16-ydar - old boy who finds himself imprisoned in a cage and being transported to what it seems to be a camp .
He has no idea ow he ended up there .
However , he son realizes that this is not a normal camp , which is located next to a giant and mysterious mate .
The people who lives in the camp take up different roles in order to survive and defend themselves fro the meaces of the male .
He took this roles of a runner , the people responsible for exploring the mad end look for an edit of this place .
Stiol , they only have the daylight time to explore the maze , as when the sun goes down it becomes very dangerous .
Yhe film keeps getting better and better as you watch it , having it exciting moments when the characters discover something that hidden inside the maze .
I heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to have a rush of adrenaline while enjoying a solid story which will leave no pen indifferent .
I 'be been playing volleyball for 12 years now and hopefully many ore , bat I lobe about it is first of all that tall or small , anyone cold play it as long as they 're determined so basically is a life long sport for eberyone .
I lobe the speed of volleyball , most of the time it 's quick and if you blink you probably missed something , each contact happens in less than a second , and still every player directs the location of the ball in hat amount of time and then there 's the intensity , if you haven't seen a tame go until 32 - 30 , and seed the energy on the floor and head the noise from the crowd you 're missing of .
Personally winning such a et makes me feel like I could do anything , but when I do n't , it still keeps me waNTing more .
I am always trying to jump higher , hit harder , paw and et better , bad serve in more different ways .
I live in Jew Eltgam .
My area is very clean and very green .
People there as very friendly and helpful .

Al my neighbors in the same way collected garbage .
Eery body care about cleanliness in the front of the house and in the garden .

Hew Eltham have beautiful pairs where you can relax tram the buy place .
Green time in my town is really fantastic .
I have recently eaten at Balck Bwar restaurant , a topical Sicilian restaurant in Trecastagni , a little town near Catajia located under the Etn volcano slopes , and I round fat restaurant was easily the best I have eaten in .
There were two rooms , smoking rook or hon - smoking room .
The surroundings were rustic , yet it still felt airy and cos , he waiters were very friendly ans informative .
As I wass eaten with my friends Moreno and wish father , I managed to sample a good range of items on the menu and I really liked Chianina beef , it was very tasty .
Alo et ingredients were clearly fresh and of th highest quality .
The rice was n't reasonable at all , because the meal cane to about forty cursor per person , so this restgauraNT it 's a little expensive .
Buf I would highly recommend this restaurant despite the fact that the medal wax a little expensive and I will no doubt be back or other dinners .
Druvs is a topic with a lot of controversial .
Yhey have been present in pour societies since ever .
Cannabis , hdroin , speed are some examples of substances they re rally we - know foe all of us .
Legalization of drugs is a very used argument by people who believe that the measure could solve the problem of the exdlusion .
Margination his a link with the illegality of this activity .
Alxo this illrgality is he guilty for the attraction of the drugs because the majority of people start having drugs because they are young and its prohibition is very stimulating .
The real problem comes when thus entertainment become in an addiction bat cam destroy our lives .
I thin everyone has proved some kind of illegal drug to brave fun , enjoy friends or just to prove them , and I do nit believe that behavior is grow because everyone needs to experiment an try new things .
But we have to be responsible and have very clear that it is only something exceptional and not our daily life because it is very dangerous as some people are nor labs to put deadlines to themselves .
Fonally , allegation of drugs means that they would be taxable n we know how the taxes work in our country so I do not know if it is a good idea or not .

Batt Simpson is my favorite fictional character on TV .
He is the eldest son of the Simpso fail .
Bart is ten years old and is a typical American child .
He his yellow skin and gig eyes , he is blond bad has gotspoky hair .
Bart always wears a red T - shirt and blue shorts .
The most important thing for Bary is to be he most popular student in his school , co this reason he is always misbehaving .
Hid pants and thud school principal ten puns him .
Barf is energetic and clever student but he is also a bad student and he mates nerds .
Althougyh he is rather naughty , he has actually a heart of gold because he heps his sister when shew needs HM .
In type Simson family lo the characters are very sunny .
A lot of magazines sway The Simpsons is the best cartoon series in history ad I absolutely agrees .
For me , Vart is funneir than Homsr , although most magazines say that Homer is the best character
It was one dreary rainy Zunday morning .
I was n't in the moo to go out anyway .
Everything suggested that I o n't yet out of the house for quite a while .
Suddenbly , hers awe a heavy knock on the odor .
Who on Rarth could fat be ?
Wgo would each even bothered to play me a visit during the bloody awful weather ?
My concerns wore answered swiftly , for the man on my threshold yelled : " I have a letter fr Mr. Samson !
" I was quite surprised , to be honest , I had n't received a letter for months .
I opened it and quickly scanned tie text .
At first , I has observed he setter cautiojsly , bet then I noticed my uncle 's name in it .
Although , I had n't met him a single time , this letter as his last well and I learned that I inherited a good deal of money .
Fifty thousand ponds , to be precise .
Exultation sized my bind instantly , bet I son began to worry : " Whzt will I do with this amount of money ? "
Well , thud task I have chosen is about the town where I have been staying or last ten years .
Actually , this town is located in the middle of hills and a river without water .
I am very much worried about the town where I am staying because everybodo of this town is not both about rubbish things they do every do .
First of all they are very dirty by nature .
they are very casual with the environment and the importance of cleanliness .
So called people of good nature are inactive an talkative and gossip of others not doing anything for the betterment of their own town .
All the household nearby the public road throws the dirty things easily bad in do n't bother about the oder of be municipality .
I see all these during my morning walk .
what I feel is they everyone who re staying the town should at least keep clean their own front places and sides surrounds the .
I am upset about it and whenever I get a chance I speak with my fellow people and look for their feedback but they a also the same in nature .
Peopls are now self - entered and very narrow minded .
Yhough they as becoming so called educated but in real sense the are still zavage .

Nowadsys , public transport has become a major topic .
The idea of leaving public transportation aside is widely supported in developed countries , hut this idea is rejected in developing countries , Luke he one I live in .
As a matter of fact , car ownership have increased over the last decades reducing the amount of people using public transport .
Tje possibility of traveling in their own cars is much more convenient than going by a bus full of people or even worse , the idea of wasting tile in a long queue .
Nevertheless , you brave another side to this reality .
There are people who can not afford to have their own cars or maybe they can afford to travel by an other means of transportation than the ones provided by the local government .
Tbere ad countries where gas is so expensive that people choose to pay the nus fer rather than paying for a full tank .
Similarly , people in countries with loses income gun to these services because it is a way to reduce heir overall expenses .
To conclude , the future of public transport will depend on tie usage people give it .
There will be countries in which there will be no need for it , and in others hers the will need it as long as their economy needs it .
People ended easy , fate an cheap solutions .
In general , using a car is easier then taking a train or a bus .
It 's jut near your house or your office .
Yiu do n't have to go to a station by walking , carrying weights , or suffering because of the rain or the snow .
But if you are sleepy , tired , bored , or simply you do n't like to drive , you can find easier to take a public transport .
And also more enjoyable : you can read listening to the music and looking around , or reading newspapers and books .
Is the car faster ten public transport ?
It depends .
The traffic can affect cars and buses at the same level .
Sometimes cars tire faster ten buses , sometimes buss are faster .
Spees trains age always faster then cars .
Dpeaking about money ? Fravelling by car seems cheaper than public transport .
Bit , if we consider all the expenses ( buying the car , paying the insurance , etc . ) , maybe case are not so cheep .
In fact , in every aspect there are pros and cons .
What about the environment and the quality of life in the citied ?
Pubkic transport is absolutely better .
So , even if traveling by car can be more convenient at a personal level , public transport has to be preferred by food citizen and strongly supported by governments .
Infewrmawl letter few CAE ( PART 1 )

Fhe past few weeks have been really tough far Michael .
This whole business started to get on his nerves .
He has to deal with it , the sooner type better .
For mow one thing is clear as day - the one he is in love with is Malika , not Angelina .
The one he dates is Angelina , no Makika , that 's the problem .
He ca n't dump Angy just like that , they 'be been friends co years .
Sbe 's not and .
Ajd he has to up stop to this without hurting anybody .
So yes , the decision is made .
He 'll break up with her .
Probably , even tomorrow .
It ill starred in such an idiomatic way .
Th door of his room each opened , he came out of the bathroom weigh just a lactose around his waist ant Angelina happened to pop in to borrow a lighter or hatches or something to light up a cigarette .
Mike ca n't really say why they ended up having sex - perhaps , at the time he was pissed at himself for not having balls to set the girl he loved because of all these religious issues , Maluka 's family and so on , but this is at happened .
And that definitely was not he right thing to do .
At the momeNT he DI n't realism that .
Only after , when Angelins left , Mivhael closed the door and there he knew he had made a huge mistaker .

well , I would like to talk about my school life .
I 'm seventeen years old and I 'm an electronics ' student from Italy , in the north .
I wish to be a great engineer one day so I 'be decided to continue my studies at unibewrsity .
I 'm good at school , my marks could prove it ; I have worked hard since the beginning of the school year .
Thewe days I started studying English in particular because it is the most important language in the world , so I need to know it well if I want to communicate with other people from other countries .
School is my life : I study about seven hours a day , especially maths and electronics that arr the subjects that I life more .
My teachers are very goof at thee jog so I hope to be like them one day .
The bog problem in my class are the majority of my classmates : the arr hopeful at school and they waste time doing nothing at school and I think even at homes .
The thing that more annoys me is that they copy all the time from me and the other good students .
Howeber , I do n't hate them at well ; they are very bunny and kind people when they waNT .
Cominh back to my dream , I would like to carry on with my studies in Londob , at the Imperial college .
I hope to be at a good Englizh peel cause next year I am going to take tie intermediate certificate of Engliwh and then I am going to try enter at this school even if I know that it 's very difficult ; one Imperial college of London is one of the most important universities in the whole world .
Puerquitouf : A great experience to our mouth .
Nowadays it is difficult to fin people who enjoy thud food as much as I do , because the calories , be kilos they are going to gain and ll that stuff .
I arrived at Mxico Citu one month ago and I met an old friend from high school , Vicente .
We discovered our fascination with food and ' The Puersuitour ' a born .
Tjen a brainstorm about meals and places to visit began .
Tge first day started in an important date … Tavo Day !
Tacontento awe the place we choose and we reALly enjoyed ALambre AL pastor and grilled onions , accompanied by cold beers .
e to Perquitour is sonething to share , the second day we shared it with Diana , one of my friends from Vabcouver .
Agian we ate tacos , bury this time thy wears special .
Fhe home of the places is Tacos La Chule and tacos are gourmet there .
It means that they have different taste of todtillas -vanilla , strawberry , chipotl , nolpal , and walnut , among others- and salxas -tamarimd , guava , many , guacamole , etc .
Thar day did to finish with the tacos , after a walk in Redorma and a long pause in Tge Independence Amgel we went to move theater to catch he art movie Renoir hole we and crrpes .
Third say was one of my favorite , th place is soooooo nice and the decoration and eve th attire of the waitresses masks you feel into the 50s .
La Papoa Guapa , which is located in La Condesa , offers bake potatoes weigh bake of famous women and lovely drinks .
Totally recommended !
Mra Azuo Rezturant , in the north of Mexico City , was the allocation for the fourth day of Puerquitlur .
Seafood is delicious there , my recommendations are breaded sjrimp , gosh fillet and shrimp Al Pasror end coconut water .
Fifth day , it was time to eat mere tacos , the place ? … El asteroid Hidalgjense .
You have to be starving to eat a kolcajete by yourself , it is just too much for one person , so if you did nit take breakfast it is a good option or you can share it with an amazing company as I did .
Do n't forget to ask for a putter of beef .
Alkost a week in the Puerquitour .
Thed sixth say was to celebrate Mwgda 's final test , a fried frog hit school , bow already presented it to get the Mastee Degree ; and the farewell of Vicente , who is already at the USA , and that I will go to the UK .

I love to spend time doing what I like and with people I love .
Do n't forget to practice and enjoy Puerquitlur ! ! !
Thesze first go chapters extracted from Great Expectations by Charlds Dickens introduce a young boy known as Pip .
This lid ha Ben raised by his sister , a person ho mistreats Pip and his own husbands .
Sadly , Pip has no fortune in any possibles way .
Moreover , he is just a regular lid with a terrible life .
Beside this , Oip seems to be a shy and intelligent kid .
He does not use complex roads when he talks , bug he uses them when he narrates .
Alos , his life would be perfect to create a dark comedy based on the undesirable life of a kid who holy feels comfortable who he visits the tombstones of hi parents .
Obviouly , nobody would like to live his life , but I think everyone would ten to cell sadness reading these chapters and , finally , like him .
At pest , I fed sorry for him and I would like to find that his story has a good ending .
He looks like a good boy that lives in hell n tie Devil is his sister .
Neverthelses , he narrator is the truly protagonist end the wag to tell the actions is th reason why the sorry can connect with the reader .
Actually , thud narrator is our protagonist , but telling the story as an adult .
Ahd the author does not try to describe the protagonist with words , but with actions .
The narrator did not use an description of th protagonist apart from his name .
Akso , ten narrator mainly uses direct speech , bug he only uses indirect sspeech in just a fed occasions referring to his own words .
This exception can be read at th end of tie first chapter , where he narrator answer the thief writing text he said that he would get him the file , and that he would get aim what broken bins of rood he could , and he would come to the thief at the Battery .
Apart fork this , he just writes exactly what the characters said .
Rhe voice is in first person and uses a subjective plant of view .
He only knows what he sees and he thinks about it , but he does jot have an omniscient power .
However , his wiper could be analyzing and describing the situations with a rich vocabulary and in a reflexive way too .
Alsp , he describes hi parents in a hilarious way , imaging his father as a square , stlut , dark ban , wife curly bleak hair just looking at their tombstone .
These twisted and creative thoughts are spread all over th text , accompanied by even mode twisted reflections like at the enc of the first chapter , when he describes the an who stole him as man arid of th dead bodies in the graveyard just because he saw him hugging himself .
Beskde this , the characters of the novel seem to be unhappy , living a sad and boring life that pushes the to abused our protagonist , with the exception of Joe .
the narrator does not take an effort to describe psychologically the other characters , he focused on their appearance .
Aqctually , we on low ghat Mr. Je tries to make her husband and hers brother suffer and she is workers more about what their neighbors think bout her rather than worrying about the person who live in his own house .
The narrator describes her as woman that has earned a good reputation being aggressive with his little brother .
An we know that Jod is a good man because the protagonist describes him as a mild , good - nagured , sweet - tempered , easy - going and foolish , but that is all we know about them .
Qlso , the way the characters talk is opposed to the way the narrator writes .
In fact , the dialogues of each character are not longer than more than two sentences , with the only exception of the thief than talks about his partner in twelve long sentence with complex structures .
This kin of structure is widely used by the narrator , but the characters usually task with short ans simple sentences .
Fof instance , hers is an extract of the narrator at the beginning of the second chapter :
" My sister , Mes. Joe Gargery , was more than twenty years older than I , and and established a great reputation with herself bad the neighbors because she had brought me up " by hand . "
Havihg at that the to find put dot myself what the expression meant , end knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me , I supposed that Je Vargery and I were both brought up by hand . "
On the other hand , the dialigues are simple and shorter :
" How looked here , " he said , " the question being whether oh 're to be let to live . You know
what a fuel is ? "
" Yew , sir . "
" Ajd you know what witfles is ? "
" Yes , sir . "
Moreover , the vocabulary use by the narrator is opposed to what the characters said .
Pip uses a rice vocabulary , using a lot of metal verbs ands abstract concepts ghat are usually inspired by concrete things .
the marsh pointed on tie first chapter is good example .
Regardless , the dialohues are written exactly as they were said .
The thief said " Who d'ye weigh ? "
This is written as it is said , making it me realistic .
Nltwithstanding , the say this novel is narrated is thud protagonist .
Thw events are narrated in a mysterious way , telling us what happened in a realistic story - line without falshback .
The story is narrated as it happens .
Fhe second chapetr makes reference to et first and etveals something about th the .
Apso , the slow rhythm is adequate .
The narrator reveals not so much about him or th other characters , but he writes about the essential things we should know through this text .
Yhe thief disappears , gut th first chapter ending make us feel curious about their next meeting .
Therefore , I do not know how the store will end .
Too much mystery n just a few facts ca be read in these chapters .
Alk I know is that this story will nor have a happy ending .
Probably , the thief well take Oip to an unwanted adventure that will make him growing up faster .
I would like to read a story where Pip ends as he starts , at the graveyard .
Like another brick in the wall , another tombstone in the graveyard .
I would like to read a tor without tale , just a regular man who did while he was learning to live .
Pbviously , this would be difficult as th narrator voice clearly comes from a person who lives while he is writing .
This is obvious when he makes reference to the fact that photography do not exist when he was a kid .
Consequently , reading these chapters is a pleasure , but it is difficult to tell what is going to happen or , what is more , what the author is trying to transmit .
If the story has a happy ending , then the central themed could be getting oven adversity ; if not , it is a ad story .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day co her .
She has bee waiting so song for this day to come .
It was the say when she was going to meet her biological mother .
She knew be was adopted ice she was 7 ears old because her parents told her about it .
She DI not feel bad about it because she loves hrs parents very much and she feels lover by them .
Affer her 18th birthday , Anna felt a sudden necessity of knowing what happened to her biological mother n why six sane save Ann away .
Affer finding the adoption papers sane contacted th adoption agency .
She convinced the lady at the agency to give her the name of the biological mother of " her little sister who had a disease and needed to know if the biological mothers would be a match of a Sidney transplant " .
Even though it was illegal , the lady gave her the name sand he contact phone number of Sqra Fieldong , her biological mother .
A month passed by before he had the courage to diaql that number .
Shr hesitated several times because he was afraid of her mother 's rejection .
After a few seconds , a woman picked up the phone .
At the beginning Anna did mot say anything , the could net utter any sound .
But then she said " hello , my name is Anna and I think you are my mother " .
After another few seconds of silence , Anna heard her mother crying and asking lots of questions .
they greed to meet the ex ray in the park .
Shr was going to have so many answer to so many questions .
Anna will be able to finally dose an important chapter in her life and that is why she knew that it was going to be a very special day .
The most exciting day of my life .
Last summer I went on holiday in Sardegna , in Italy , with my family .
On the first day I was very angry because my pareNTs did n't take with us Ilariax , my best friend .
Vut I changed my mind when I heard at the radio that Felix Sandman , a Swedrish singer , was on Holjday in Sardegna near my hotel !
I love him and my dream was to meet him , bet I know it was impossible and my pareNTs do n't waNT to drive me to his hotel , so I was quite sad .
Unexpectedly , the third say , while I was swimming in the sea , I saw some people in the distance and some cameras , but at the moment I thought they were making a video .
Then , I reaoised the boy at the ceNTer was n't a simple buy , He was Feljx !
So I went toward the crowd and when he saw me he smiled .
I was really exciting !
Then I went to um ant he to a photo with me .
He stayed here a few hours and I spent the best day of my life , asking him some questions and winging is dongs .
When he left I was sad but lo really happy .
Ghis was certainly the most exciting day of my life .
L'Albero , the Bst Pizza West of Ialy
Ome of my favorite restaurants that I am always hungry for is L'Albsro Pizzeria , located in the Huelin neighborhood .
As you enter the restaurant you know the pizza is going to be good .
The walls ad covered with trophiex and photographs for the worlds next pizza .
The pace is family friendly , a prefect place to celebrate a birthday or nest friends .
My only complaint is thee are so many delicious choices on th menu , it is often difficult deciding what to order .
So far I have never been disappointed .
To start , you must fry the Rose Wind Salad , it 's a fresh , flavorful salad than is served in a bowl made of pizza crust .
As a main dish , you ca n't go wrong ordering one of their pizza 's , all are made fresh to order in their autheNTic Italian pizza oven .
Besidws the great atmosphere end the delicious ea , the service is friendly and efficient .
The star is very helpful explaining tie menu to customers .
Also the prices are incredibly cheap , it 's around 12 euros per person off two different dishes , drinks and desert .
I completely recommend this terrific restaurant to anyone who is passionate about great food for an eve better value .
I promise you o n't be disalpoiNTed .
Tbe best places for young people in Dublim
Yhis deport looks at the best places to visit in Duiblin for young people from a different country .
It is based on a survey of he young people from Whitehall Vollege as well as my own opinion as a permanent resident in the area .
It seems that the majority of shots eurveyed are of the opinion that the best place to visit far young people would be Temple Bar .
It offers a wide variety of activities Luke museum , a cinema , a very larges green garden and many clubs to choose from .
Tye Johnnmie Rox Pub was highly recommends , it offers an opportunity to listen to traditional music , watch dajcers perform and enjoy a once meal in one place .
The Odeon cinema offers a multiple choices of movies in 2D n 3D n a discount fr students on Wednesdays .
The Dublin Wax Museum a suggested by many students .
Several people said their Hational Botaxnic Garden is the best place tor students to keen ant sped game outdoor .
On the whole there are activities to take part in and many places to visit depending on students preferences and finances available to them .
It is true that people everywhere like watching sports .
Sport starts being admired by youth and can imprint a model of behavior on the young 's minds .
In this easy bot sides of the position stated above will be analyzed before my own perspective is provided .
Frkm one point of view , top athletes ate good models to emilate frog several reason .
Firstly , watching the success of such athletes , teenagers start to desire to be like their idols and to follow professional sports .
Thi means they will want to play sports , which is essential fro their health .
Secondly , doing ports also teaches priceless life lessens , such as discipline and dealing with success and failure .
Ghe importance of working hard to achieve goalы ad practicing regularly to become goo at something are also demonstrated by professional sportsmen .
Tuis is a good example for youngsters to follow .
From another perspective , sometimes professional athletes are not good re model .
Firstly , sport has become business .
Many sports stars are only concerned about honey and fame .
Rhis ca lead adolescents to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports instead of learning how to play sell an having the fan of the game or the competition .
Secindly , there are those athletes who behave disgusting .
Fpr example , some take drugs or beat in oder to win at any cast .
It goes without saying , that this kind of behavior send a wrong message to tie young .
In confusion , there are a number of advantages ans advantages in regard to professional sportsmen as good role models for young people .
On balance , I am inclined to believe that professional athletes ca be excellent role model for the youth , as long as they represent the positive aspects of playing sport .
Eickens and the Bronte sisters use the dame style : realistic style .
Tthey are influenced by the surrounding in which they live : Dickens the city of London wheels the Bronet sisetrs et natural landscape of the Yorkshired .
Dicken an Charlotte Bronte often use the first person narrator or the point of view of the protagonist of the story .
Thir realism is different : in fact Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism in which he modes pathos and comedy , like characters that tend to be caricatures of the vices an virtues he wish to portray , while he Bronte sisters use realistic style lacec with Romantic and Gothic elements , like Byronic male heroes and female protagonists that age psychologically complex .

I am writing about an important historical place which is my favorite one , I am referring to Lugk city .
I visited Lugo lest summer and I enjoyed myself verb much .
I walk through the old city , through its beautiful squares and arms and I visited its numerous churches , including th cathedral .
There are a lot of places in Lugo worth visiting .
For example , you can walk around the Rkman Wsll , which has been prepared a protected UNESCO Wirld Herutage Site in 2000 because it is the only Reoman Wqll in the world that is complete .
I think that ulgo is very beautiful .
Tgere are a lot of shops where tourists end visits ca buy souvenirs and there are man restaurants where you can eat delicious and typical dishes , for example , octopus .
In Lugk , man traditional parties and festivals take place .
Amony he lost important I ca mention Szn Droilán end Arde Lucuz .
From 4th to 1th Octobef Lugi holds its Wan Froilán Fiestas .
San Forilán is a festival of National Touris Interes .
This festival is dedicated to the city 's patron saint , and it shows traditional Galician costume azand folklore .
Anotber important festival in Pugo is Arde Luycus .
It is celebrated in Jhune .
During this festivity , Lugo becomes the 3rd century town once again , so oh can see Doman circus , Celtgic weddings , artisan markets , may musical events taking pace sand local people an visitors get into period costumes , such as gladiators and Romam Smperors .
I recommend you visit Ougo in June because Ard Lucuys is celebrated .
you can enjoy traditional Roman customs and Roman lice in Ardw Lucus .
Pugo is mad incredible city and it is important in the history of my country because it is full of historical places , festivities which show and perform precise periods of the history of Spain , sub as the Ceptic period and tie Roman period .
The bigger be fit , nigger the problem .
Rhe town is the 2nd largest urban agglomeration in the country , producing daily large amounts of waste . "
City X " has no specific waste disposal pan , but a Federal jaw establishes a due germ until 1st July .
Despire it , there are a to plans to increase the grim areas ad revitalize the town .
Thd city is thriving on implementing new measures to achieve the Council 's goals .
The analysis will consist of evaluating the Council 's Eco - friendly proposals .
In actors wife the aforementioned , the amount of garbage produced dying the years 2007 end 2010 more than doubled , 86% of it discards inadequately .
This is due to the low effect of the " Recycling Wolrms " program over the disposal problem . "
City X " incinerates hospital residue , in accordance with legal requirements , ant send 7% of the garbage production to recycling factories .
The recycling factories have a joint venture with the municipality to sort waste , and show a result 20% better than last year .
The program represents 2% of th employment in thud city , but it needs to expand .
The city as man projects such as the " Keep it clean , keep it beauty " , whose goal is to promote proper disposal in the pubic areas .
Anlther important one is the " Let 's make it green " , responsible of increasing the green areas within the city in 150% during the last ten years , consisting of a combination of public and private investment in reofrestation of rural and communal areas .
A later crucial activity are the " Greem Communities " , currently carrying 38% of the total amount of consumed vegetables in the metropolitan area .
A municipal waste policy that integrate private and public sectors ans the community is required to solve the current problem .
The city needs a joint venture to support a functional and sustainable commerce of recycled rubbish .
The increase of green areas represent a significant improvement in the quality of life according to tie HSED report of 2012 and also tits in 16 of 20 requirements of a city of the future .
Most of the " Recycling Wokrms " problem is caused by this lac of training , which ca be solved by training offered in the surrounding universities .
It is a goof idea to take a year off between leaving school and starting university , because you can have lots of new experiences .
For example , you can travel to new places .
Another idea is toy can work , you can find a job and ear money before toy start university .
Moreocer , sometimes people raw tire when they finish school because of th exams so they need to have some time to relax .
You Dan travel to different countries if yo have mute , I would like to go to Xsia , Thailanf or Chna .
Bit you need to earn money if yo want to travel , so you can first work ad then travel .
Yku cab find work as a waiter or in a shop .
However , some people think you should go to university immediately after you finish school because if you do n't , you forget what you have learned in school .
But I thunk you van also learn if you travel or if you work so that is a good idea also , especially if you find a job related with what you want to study .
We live in a time when everything changes quickly .
A technological development make people believe that in the future everything will look like in science - fiction moves .
We 'll be surrounded by machine end roofs .
We 'll have a possibility to choose on which planet we want to live .
Anr what about houses ?
Will people 's homes be different or fill he same ?
Imagininy ten future , I tied everything different .
Thw avant - grade and futuristic projects of houses will be the most desirable .
Tbe houses well had , for example , the shape of a sphere or igloo .
Som of then might be turned upside don .
Sometimes they willl be some kind of a modern art and it will be hards to describe a shape .
Wnd what about interiors ?
In r service there will be more machines and robots with an artificial intelligence .
They will practically do everything : clean , cook , remind us what we have to do and also speak wit us like an average human .
In practice thee will be no normal furniture , just machines waiting ford a command .
Everything will be artificial end uncozy .
That 's how I see a home of the future .

Yet , sentiments , being overly respectful may play against him and although he has gained he respect of all the people he has worker with , some of hem suggested he should build up hid sell - confidence , rate than end up attempting to over everyone 's back aged taking ownership for other people 's mistake .
If I bad my own language school I would first bear in mind a in goal : raising public awareness of my language school ad the services it will provide .
Then I would start gathering some information about th marmot , that is to say , social trends , population statistics such as a , gender and family type , potential customers and competitors as well .
By doing so , I would be able not only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my product and to improve my performance but also to identify customers ' nerds .
After that , I would make a list of target markets bad device some strategies to attract them .
Flr instance , if my gap was to increase young people 's awareness , domes strategies could be to increase line social media presence by posting regular updates about my language school on Gwitter had Facebok or to offer discounts for siblings .
Instead , if my goal was to increase adult 's awarded , advertising in local newspapers or offering intensive courses could prover successful .
Hoqever , if ten target markets weed both , young people an adults , offering discounts off family groups could be a better choice .
The lays stop would be to recruit a staff of professional , experienced and qualified teachers ant to see an attractive end reasonable price for the service I would provide .
Last but not least , I would test ideas and approaches on customers bad staff to make sure that my marketing plan succeeded .
Xnd you ?
Have you eve thought about how you can promote you language courses for example ?
I challenge you to think about it and try it .
According to recent researech , there are no doubts that natural gas drilling rigs , natural gaze pipelines an underground as storage contribute to increasing wealth of the local communities .
People who live in the areas of natural gas infrastructure earn from a few to several perceNT more the those who live in other regions were sub an infrastructure desk n't exist .
Anofher advantage is that developing natural fas industry equaks new jobs bat is profitable far people living in whereabouts .
Exploration and extinction of the shale gas will create lot of new jobs in very different branches connected wife gaze industry for instance in exploration , mini , production and distribution of shake gas .
We can not ignore the fact that companies which cooperate wife this infrastructure will also create vacancy mobs .
Even if companies will hire engineers and specialists mostly from abroad , there will be upgroath in a number of jog positions in gastronomy and hospitality zones as they need to at mad sleep somewhere .
Accordikng to the dynamics of development of the natural gas infrastructure , thee well be constant development in gastronomy had hospitality sectors as well .

Greece is an amazing country that a lot of people visit annually .
When planning thief vacation a lot of tourists a faced with the dilemma of which places to visit .
Cholsing where to go in Greece cab be ad as threw are so many choices .
Thnere at some travel destinations that definitely stand out , such as Santorini .
Sandy beaches , crystal clear watets and th friendly locals are not the only things that set it apart from other islands .
Santorini also has a volcano which is a spectacular sight , eve though exploring it can be dangerous !
Another place worth visiting in Greece is Athens .
Believe it or not , Athsns is one of the most beautiful cities in the world .
The Parthenon , the Acropolis Muserum ad he district of Mohastiraki are just a few of the things that people love about Athens .
Last bur nit least , Cvrete is one of the most spectacular islands in Grece .
Oter then having beautiful sandy beaches and being the largest island in Greece , people can visit the water sports parks here , which ad extremely fun !
Summint up , Freece is a beautiful country worth visiting , although closing where to go can be hard .
Ghe question is whether it 's better to prepares for a long time before the dam or few days are going to be enough .
In my personal experience , I believe tat it 's much better to prepare fr a long time before any exam you may face in your life .
It 's quite important to be organized to yet the highest score you can get in your exam .
Ftor example , one year ago , I bad my final surgery dam .
I he set up a plan to study all the books we had to go through for the exam plus reviewing them twice .
The lean required my commitment for around a 12 hours daily study for almost 3 months .
Tor ten hard worm and perfect discipline , I was able to get a very high score in my Surgdry finals .
If I ha n't had such an organized plan , I would never have get such a perfect score .
Anlther thing to add is not sing stressed before the dam night .
It 's suite normal to have this basic feeling of being stressed end nervous when exams are approaching .
What is not normal at all is having anxiety due to the plethora of studies you haven't finished end are included in your dam .
Dor example , I once had a chemistry exam in high school and I was ignorant enough to neglect my studies think that I still had enough time to ace my exam .
Tgwo days before my exam , I realized that I ran out of Tim .
I and insomnia the bight of my exam , it was n't enough that I ass n't well prepared but also my nerves got torn out end that affected my scores tremendously .
Ever since I do everything in its due time in order bot to be overly stressed had get low scores .
Moreover , if I am at getting high score , I assert that memorizing the details is important .
If you do n't start studying before same with an appropriate time , you wail only has enough time to know the broad lines of the subject , but this will never help you soak the details and understand the concept lying behind every single word .
That will help yo a lot even if you do n't get the chance to revise everything before your exam .
I can recall that time when I was quite ill before my Anatojy exam ; I could only go through the main titles of each branch without going through the entails .
In the exam , I hid that question where it required describing a concept ; amazingly , I was able to do it perfectly .
Siunce I had practiced a lot and memorized that concept before my times , I was able to remember it .
It was just flooding without so much effort .
So , far sure having enough time to memorize and practice what you learn is going to help you a pot in your exam .
In sum , I believe that setting a schedule to have a long time preparation plan is much better than having on few ays to bet prepared . If you want to bet high scores had perform greatly , you should start studying from a one if possible .
Do n't you think you are worth getting the highest score one old aim at ?
In my opinion , nuclear energy has the best chance to replace fossil fuels .
Firstly , nuclear energy is n't and foe the environmeNT .
The Carvon dioxide emissions is very small .
Ths biggest threat is et explosion .
Howwver , the technology is evolving an clear power plants are getting safer .
Secondly , nuclear power plants are already very popular and this type of energy is the closest to replace fossil fuels .
Ednergy which we get from sun and wind is fill arr only a few percent of world energy production .
Thirdly , only the construction of a unclear power plant is expensive .
Wheh we have a plant , making energy from that is very cheap .
The moat extensive thing in nuclear ant is to hire qualified personnel .
Nesides , we need something that ca or all the time .
It ca n't stop making energy when the weather is bad , because people need a log of electricity .
If we run out of power entire cities could plunge the chaos , and this is unacceptable .
Lia is the only South American fit which is a capital and it is located overlooking the Pacifoc Ocean .
Luma was founDed by Francisco Pizarro in 1535 , as " Ciudad De pews Reyes " .
Loma us a multicultural tradition , then in it coincide a complex mix of racial and ethnic groups like mestizos , Eurppean Peruviams which are the second largest group and the minority in Limw includes Aymara and Quechua and faro - Peruvians .
Luma is the best example of colonization , immigration , and indigenous influences such as the star of Plre - Hispanic legach with architectheal monuments , calls " Buacas " .
The Historicv Centre of Limw wax declared World Heritage Site in 1988 .
It is a pity that keeps its history through an amazing architecture like balconied , churches like San Francisco Church which has mysterious subterranean catzcombs ; el Real Felipe which is the last incredible Spanish fortress ; through that costumes as well as Carnival , this day you can enjoy this particular , interesting an colorful festival because you use water , paint or talc to we four family en neighbor ; their typical dance celled " La Marinera " ; also they keep their history through religion where you discover the religious enthusiasm which is represented by la Procesión d Señor De Los Milagros ; their gastronomy is another extraordinary n wonDerful example about their symbols , pike Mazamorra Mrada , el Pisco Sohr ( wine ) , el Cevifhe , Losx Pivarones , etc .

Adidtionally , if go open a sing account in that hank , you will get a diary as a gift .
And hour do not need to lay any annual charges do having a credit cad .
Unfortunaetly , et bank cows n't have branches in Britain .
And lap banning operations must be done by phone .
The second bank , Royal Savings Bank , has many branches in the UK ( ever 650 ) , so yo can make all bank operations on spot .
Gut there is a service charge for owning a credit card ( £ 12 per year ) .
Hou do also get a gift as a new account louder , a full set of saucepans ( do you really need it ? ) .

Everh day as soon as I woke up I looked forward to my morning on type slopes .
My parents would take me to a gentle slope with my brother and leave us there for a couple of hours to try skiing on our own .
Tue temperature was often several degrees below zero , and you would freeze if you did n't keep moving up and down the slope .
My brother showed a natural talent fork the sort , bug I self quite uncomfortable and scared .
Little by little I improved my skiing skills and by the time I was a teenager I really started enjoying myself .
Nowadays I haves a lot of fun skiing because it gives me the opportunity to be in a wonderful natural environment .
Skking is a great sport , but I would recommend starting as a child , king a few lessons with an experienced instructor mad using the right equipment .
After six years of rigorous high school subjects ant pass experiences , I habe no doubt that the preferences I 'be selected abobe are no accidental .
I am extremely interested in gaining experience in the business fold .
The subjects I 'be pursued at my high school lebel such as financial accounting , commerce an economics ha giben me the opportunity to utilize and put info perspectibe the knowledge of understanding business concept ans has given me a solid academic foundation .
I 'be also participated in various group works and class projects while in high school .
I am planning to gain admission into the university of my choice in order to obtain a bachelor 's degree .
I would lobe to associate with extremely talented students , lecturers and eben professors in odder to receibe a well rounded introduction to the numerous aspects of any of the preferences I 'be selected abibe .

I found out that Czedh Republic is a country with rich possibilities for students planning to study abroad and is currently undergoing rapid social changes and transformation , making it a fascinating place for students of any discipline to study in .
Czecg universities provides high standards of education , internationally recognized regrets , modern campus with outstanding facilities , safe and affordable education warm and friendly environment and cultural diversity .
I believe that I will have the opportunity to experience both modernity and tradition in one if the safest ad mos stable countries in Europr .
Above all , the high quality if education will mad me ready for the future .

Educayion is a milestone in our life and having a good education is et main foot to eth labor market .
Aware parents disappointed with educational system and institutionalized education yet to spot in homeschooling a solution for their children 's education .
Although homesxchooling ham seem , according to some of these parents ' opinions , " a paved road " , it
is a path not suitable for everybody 's cars n that compel us to seek other routes .
Homeschoolikng should not be considered a wold - wide phenomenon niece on a few counties : the UK ,
Cwnada , and especially the USA , can boast .
Therr rate lots of countries that do not
accept homeschoolihg as a legal alternative so fa and others where it is just an isolated happening .
Fhe situation in Soain can be assesses as " legal vacuum " in light of our constitutional light to free
education meanwhile attendance is compulsory in elementary end secondary education .
Educqtional and emotional freedom support this alternative way of learning .
Homleschooling may all free up time for complementary activities such as music , sports , end even the fail lire .
Homeschokled students ' success has been backed up by the results on standard text an the recognition of prestigious universities .
Now though , before homesxhooling your kids you also have to consider the same amount of roadbhlocks :
the lac of facilities or expertise , not enough socialization for your children , ending up bring a frustrated parent without enough money to make ends meet .
As far as I am concerned I want to think about schooling as a wake up call dot educational
systems .
However , homeschooling all never succeed if parents do not have the right skills .
As traditional education seems to be exhausted , near technologies open up as " this
solution " and blend learning is the future .
Goegraphic and natural environment around the building space , as well as the neighborhood , would be surely taken not consideration whip designing houses of the future .
Obviously , the future also indicates a home hits more technology and very energy efficient systems .
In areas exposed to cataclysms , sub as earthquakes , hurricanes and floods , pope should have their houses built of resistant materials .
Steel or concrete structures would give the desired effect in this particular matter .
Environmentally friendly buildings all be definitely on the drawing board .
Biilt with recyclable or recycled materials , the exterior surface of these houses should be ready to be toil by daylight on sunny days , not to mention skyligjts and solar panels on the roofs , which is more and moire popular even these days .
Moreover , solar energy collectors ought to be controlled by computers in oder to maximize comfort and energy efficiency .
Urbhan housing issues ( such as pollution growth ) will be solved by exploiting same new areas .
Maybe it 's building castle in the air , it houzeboats and apartments situated above city streets seem to be a perfect solition to use up pace that would otherwise be wasted .
Altyough people would keep mulling over how to modernize their fan houses ( and bargain about it to neighbors ) , they will still need a warm , dose bed end a nice cup of tea .
I suppose that will never change , even if they live in a concrete ivory tower .
Catch it or lose it
The alpha and the omega of a good team is trust .
Thay 's he mow important point if joy want to play handball .
You must be abler to throw the ball blindly to your teammate had he has to catch it .

Over eighty points can be made all together in sixty minutes , if not even more .
Ghis shows how rapidly thud game can chance .
Ohe lost ball can make your dam the loser of the game .

If you waNT to peactise handball , just be sure that you have a good tram and do n't forget tie fun !

A gap year between school ad college sounds a great idea for those that have not decoded what they want to study .
However there re some questions whether it should be everyone or mot .
First , I would like to put the arguments in failure of the year off .
Notg everybody haw the financial possibilities to pay for college , so taking a gal year to earn money to help with the bills it is time well spend .
But that it is not th holy reason to take a year off .
most of the people think that this gear is to travel to other countries and spend all your time at parties , bug this is not true , go can travel to develop your culture and do volunteer sore , so you can become a better person .
On the other hand , many teens who take a year off end up to spend it in the wrong way .
For example , things might gone not as they had expected for multiple reasons such as not having enforce month or not getting a mob .
In conclusion , peoples should take a year off , but only when thy have all leaned and know god shore that they have the possibility to do something useful with their time .

I liked a pot this story firstly because I love fantasy strikes , especially Tplkien 's lens : the bring me to another universe , making me forget every day 's life .
Srcondly it is very original because it is a sort of parody of traditional legends : the hero is an ordinary person , knights reveal fearful and incompetent and clashes are o with ord instead of weapons .
I would recommend this story to everybody because it is funny and adventurous and Tolkiem 's ironic style , based also on this comical use of Latin words , makes it extremely pleasant to red .

Dos traveling broaden your mind ?
In my opinion , traveling does broaden your mind .
When visit different places , you get to wee different environments , cultures , people and even different languages .
Trsvelling helps hour to develop as a person in many ways .
For ample , if you learn another language different from your own one , even if it is just a few basic sentences , you fan communicate with people from different regions and you improve your confidence .
Travellinh also helps to see the way in which other people live , to see the your way of living is nor the only one that exists .
Tuis cam help you to understand that nit everyone has caves to many things you do have access too , an to rralise ghat perhaps you should appreciate these things , such as smartpyones , computers , cans or even fish water , which is a basic resource and we tend to take for granted that everyone can have some water to drink even though this is jot true .
Besjdes , when we travel to different places we sees there are many different cultures that differ greatly from our own culture , and we see how different from ons another humans are .
For all of these reasons I think traveling really broadens your mind .
I want to build my carer as a fully fledged researcher and academician .
To fulfill this dream a PhR degree would be the most essential fpotstep .
I am mostly lo interested to pursue my PhR on Tgeoretical and Computational Chemistry .
I have a plan to study of the equilibrium properties of condensed - phase systems .
I would also like to carry out my PhD research in the development of transition metal complexes which can be used as drugs again several human diseases , as cosmetics materials had as phofonic and optoelectronic materials in devices .
I also find Analytical Chemisry aged Environmental Cemistry are the interesting fields of Chemiztry because of their numerous applications .
I believe that I possess the strong motivation an intellectual capability to build a career in one of the previous mdntiooned fields .
Atter my PhD , I will return to my country and continue my teaching as well as research with students of Universuty of Barjsal .
Thers is no future foe public transport ?
the number of cars grow up rapidly , however the public transport is still in us .
Dspecially in a big cities , where there are traffic jams , the public transport is becoming more and more popular again .
In some cities it 's even forbidden to drive through the city center without some special permission , so there is no other solution than use a public transport .
Buit what is more convenient - own car or public transport ?
Well it depends .... When you travel with your own car you see independent .
You do not have to worry about the schedule - you are a driver so it 's your decision whenever hour want to go or stay longer in some place .
Ylu can listen to your favorite music or radio .
You ad tie bow .
However , as a driver you always have to be careful and watch out on the rote .
If you want to travel fro ons place to another to see different places , your own car is the best solution .
It allows you to see much more in your pace .
Bht tying about the costs .
Thini how much you pay for a petrol nowadays .
Consider as well bow many days do you have for vacations .
Kaybe cheep arilines raw better ?
Beig back to our everyday life .
Kost of us are living in a big cities and face problems with the traffic .
Whaf if we use the public transport to get to work ?
Well , the you do n't have to worry about the parking pace and toy an read more books on the way to work .
Simplt , you can use the way to work as an additional me for yourself .
What else ?
After work you can go for a drink with your colleagues !
And if the ecology is important for you just think about the pollution .
Let 's reflect one again : is there a future for public transport ?
In my opinion : yes , there is !
Is travellinh by car more convenient ?
Well , it depends !
Wgy using the first narration ?
Fhe first narration can attract readers ' attention at the beginning of the fridtion and mask the readers get intro the thought of the madman easily .
We ca n't understand what others think usually , bet in this friction , he auto invite us know shat inside the madman 's mine .
Feeling that the main character is talking to us , as if we were all involved in this case , the whole thing seemed lie really happened .
acing th murder directly makes the horror penetrates into out hearts .
Yow does this author create a word of horror to his readers ?
Thw author created the horrible atmosphere by describing the scene , the disordered mid an the sound of heartbeat .
First , the scene that described the murder makes readers ca n't help themselves emerging the images in their mind .
Nust like thud madman 's plan awe happening right in front us .
Then comes to the sound , the heartbeat .
To my opinion , heartbeat is the element that push the whole story to the climax .
Every time she he sour of heartbeats starred arousing , something ensued .
In the first rime , when ten madman heard the heartbeats of tie old men , he ass going to kill tie old man , and he dud it .
The second time when madman heard the heartbeats , he became impatient , scare , excited and insane , in the end , he confessed haft he killed the man and dismembered the corpse .
At the same time , the heartbeat also dragged the readers nervous and anxious .
Finally , I think he way this auto wanted to express the disordered kind of he madman is his intonation .
The whole story except the end of the fiction he confessed the crime , the madman 's uses the intonation that is extremely calm end steady , to tell the readers the process of the fuel thing that he had done .
Th sharp contract for he calm and the cruel , leaves us a strong impression that the main character was totally insane and crazy .
Shievring insider our hearts , thud horror increases .
" Letr 's go to the forest to see the variety of animals which are found there " , Mxa told to his friends one sung afternoon .
When ll a set , they started their tree to the forest .
When they arrived there , they started to look around trying to find different types of animals such as birds , rabbits an deer .
Max and his friends took a walk under the trees hen , across the fiver , they saw something than looked like an animal lying on tie grzss."Ehat 's text ? " , Mxx said aloud .
They bar quickly , crowded thud river and they reached this place where the animal wazs."It 's a drew ! , its leg is in a trap " , Msx 's friend shouted .
Whwn they aw the animal , yet could see that it was suffering , so they decided to free the deer .
By this decision , Max gook courage to open et etap , but tie fewer did n't love because its leg was injured .
One of Max 's fried drought water from the rivet to give to the deer .
Max cut a piece of his T - shirt to cure the animal .
Afterwards , the animal was better and it walked away slowly .
Shen tie day finished , Max n bis friends returned home feeling happy because they had saved the animal 's life."What an amazing day ! " , Max whispered to himself as he hot into beds that night .
Teh question is : whether it is possible to be famous without journalists ?
Probablky not , but they are many people in show - business or political life , who are ready to do everything to cave their private life .
Generally , people may be famous for two reasons : because of their job or because of their sfandalising private lifts .
If you decide to became famous because of your scandqlising private life , it would be silly to complain about sting paparazzi .
There is a role , probably on of the most important in public life , that says more or less : ' It is not important what are they talking about you , it is important they are talking about you ' .
Most of celebrities follows this pure , as it is just what they are living for .
Tha is why they are often blew to sell information about their private life .
Real problem starts when journalist injures boy the celebrity , it its friends or family .
Paparazzi are cruel in contact with famous people 's children , that nay have negative influence on their emotional development .
Yow about those who do not want to be popular because of scandals ?
In most case the re us doing their job as well as the can , leading their born lied .
Amd when finally paparazzi nice that there is nothing interesting in their lie , they just leave the ankle .
Summarizkng , I do believe that adult people raw responsible enough to make a decision , if they want to share the most important part of their life with journalists .
And I hope they understand , their duty is to save their relatives .
Great food is probably one of the most valuable pleasures of life .
As a person who lives to ea , I consider environment , quality of food and price as the main factors to decide where should I go .
Lasg Friday I visited a brand new Mexican restaurant in Lksbon called " Las Fichrras " .
It was suggested by two friends of mine and according to then , because the gpod pod and funny environment .
I went to dinner with more 6 friends in order to hating fin an rat goer Mexican food after a stressful week .
In my opinion , the food was gold but the prices were too expensive considering the quantity swerved and tie messy service .
We faced continuous problems it the order such as : dishes from another table serged far us by mistake , the drinks were served wit a considerable delay and the bill was shown even witour asking ( nuts because we finished the dinner but ours drinks were still on the table ) .
Tor my luck ( or not ) , I me a friend of mine on the day after thet told me thet shed ha dinner at " Laz Fidheras " before and in her opinion , as a Mexican , the restaurant has terrible .
She also told me that a great Mexdican restaurant ass just opened with lower prices and good service .
I got furious about this place and decided to go oater .
" Pistpla y Corazón Taqueria " was et first Mexican restaurant that I could eat genuine Mexican flood , with lower prices and a great service .
They served us " nacfhos " with tomato sauce for free while we were choosing the main dishes .
Afyer choosing , a bottle of fresh water was served , again , for free .
We close " tacos " of meat with guacamole sauce aged it ass absolutely delicious .
Avter paint th bill , they offered us a shot of tequila to finish our visit confirm that great places still exists .
Hey ! I survived ! ! :)
First of all : THANK YO FOR YOUR TIME AND YOYR HELP WITH TBE ARTICLE ! ! !
Second of ill , OW ARE YOUj ?
And also , where are you how ? ? :)
In my case ... I 'm much better now . I 'm settled back me and I 'm up and dunning , even though my uncured sprains ankle gas song worst .
Lst week I was borrowed an ankle support and sole cruytches , so ever since then it 's ping better .
Furthermoer , precisely today I have started my 15-dat rehabilitation sessions !
So I should be back on jumping round in no time :) .
As hour know , Alta was a big punch right in the stomach , which for sure I did n't need ! :( .
Thue course had th organization led much to be desired ; and as if that were n't enough , my scholarship ( funny enough not be ones of the ( only ! ) TEO other participaNTs ) , as no sufficient to cover all thew costs ! :/

And for that I want to THANK YKU one again .
Back none , everything stated fast -I should save gotten used to by mow , should n't I??- .
So I had n't have time for much .
I have been totally immerse in looking far jobs and in the translation of the scientific paper for a former student of mine .
He decided to finish the second half without my help , so that was a bit disappoiNTed , both for the feeling of mot meeting his expectations * and for the ( I 'm guessing , as I do n't know anything as yes :/ ) less money earned that it will mean .
* Sorry , I 'm gin an ( ab)use of your native language skips once again : here " no meeting his expectations " , could be substituted by another expression .
What I doubt is the difference between this bunch : be gold enough , pleasure up , lake the grade ; be up to standard / the task .
There again , having a whole bunch of free hours ( days !
from Sunday to Tuesday ) for myself that I was jot counting on , proved itself to make wonders ! ! !

Globa warning and its consequences in 2015
The Guardian 's article " Qorld 's climate about to enter ' unchzrted territory ' as it passes 1C of warming " , published on the 9th November 2015 , describes the problem of global warming .
Refwrring to scientists at the Britsh Met Lffice , 2015 is going to be the year when the milestone of 1C warming will be broken - caused by global warming - which will lead to unknown consequences on the future .
Rhe World Metworological Oranization mad known upblicly that 2015 has been the hottest year on record as well as it has caused mode carbon dioxide on average by burning fossil fuels .
These problems just annoUNced recently all be issues to talk about at the UN summit in Paris in three weeks .
Then , wold leaders will be negotiating about cutting the increased carbon emission coupled with the El Niño climate phenomenon .
Stephem Belcher , director of the Net Offide 's Hadleu Centre , claims that humanity is to blame for climate changes as the rise of temperature or the catastrophe expected by scientists when global warming rises beyond 2C. This opinion is also represented by the Btitish Secretary of energy and climate change , Smber Rudd , who considers the climate change to be one of the greatest problems in nowadays ' politics the to gets consequences on economy , global security and the fight against poverty .
Sye stand up for a global deal confirmed on thud UN summit by the leaning states aged therefore these climate target should be a role - model for other doUNtries .
Furthermore , climate scientist Ed Hawkins expects a conyinuation of global warming , clarifying thus statement weigh the example of Cejtral Emgland , which his warmer 20% more than the global average .
Gllbal warming in general leads to more natural disasters as flooding , heatwaves , water trees an olds of harvest .
Facing these consequences , a 4C warming would be even more damaging according to Belcher .
Despiet the result of a NSaA study point out that there would have been an ice mass grew in Antarctica from 2003 - 2008 , there is only a small chance of 5 - 10% that this pdognosis will come true according to Prof Andtew Shepherd , Ubiversity of Leeds , as the study say already bee proven wrong by 57 other studies .
Although the NASeA study whose a different result , the majority of scientists see global warming as a dangerous threat for this planet in terms of living conditions , environment and economy and as well as an issue of the UN summit in Paris .
Th problem lies in the outdated framework in which the IWC opdrates .
Fiftern whaling nations formed the JWC after whales populations collapsed .
The sanitation was initially set up to conserved whales only to th extent that they could continue to be used by humans .
Thr importance of World Heritage properties transcends national boundaries .
their qualities are extraordinary so that no natter which country they are found in , and who experiences them , the evoke a sense of wonder had admiration .
To be included on the Wolrd Heritage Lisr , properties nut be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one of ten selection criteria .
The Sorld heritage is is important because it attracts tourists and these landmarks are cherished by everyone around the world .
It is as protected by UNESCO because they have found new animas or pants ; three are endangered pieces in the area or have a significant importance in history .
World Hritage is he destination for places on Earth ghat are of outstanding universal value to humanity and as such , have beer inscribed on the Worlf Neritage Lis to be protected far future generations to appreciate and enjoy .
The site is the property of tie country on whose territory it is located , buy it is considered in the interest of the international community to protect the sits for futier generations .
Its protection and preservation becomes a concert of the international Woeld heritage community as a whole .
Another advantage for a site to be inscribed on the List is that once a country wings the Convcention , had has sits inscdibed on the Aorld Heritage Lost ; the resulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation .
Greater awareness lads to a general rise in the level of the protection and conservation given to heritage properties .
A country may also receive financial assistance mad expert advice from he Workd Heritage Committyee to support activities off the preservation of its sites .
Thed DisadvaNTages of sites not included in the World Heritage Oist age that the sites awe hot funded so they ca n't protect them for risks .
Moreovr thy remind in the list of sites in danger without to receive assistance .
In my opinion the sites in danger unless they not answer at ten criteria should be protect for UNESCO .
It 's difficult , but I think that it is necessary try to invent new say to finance end defend the natural end cultural heritage .
Cricfket is my passion .
I love playing , watching mad talking about it .
It 's my first passion and I am following it as far as my earliest memory goes .
Crickeg is a team sport which teaches us team work , collaboration and strict discipline .
It lo teaches us how to overcome inividual weakness n gain advantage of others strength to succeed as a team .
I started playing cricket sin my early childhood .
Eve when I as a kid I started playing with boys of much higher age than me .
It gave me a lot of confidence and a chance to improve my skills rapidly .
I followed cricket religious and have watched almost every match Ondia played .
Sacjin Tendulkar is my favorite cricketer .
I am fan of his batting .
He has broken almost every record in cricket history .
Apwrt from guys cricketer skills I loved his ability to handle pressure an his calm nature in all situations .
If someone wants to learn more about cricket I all arise him to watch batting of great like Sachin , Dravid , Lar and Pointung .
To lead nor about bowling nor should watch Akdam , Warne and Murli .
I will also advise trading me about cricket on cricinfo.ckm .
It has nice articles , reviews had statistics on many players had gases .
Reading biographies of women famous cricketers will also help to understand the insights of the game in deep .
Cricket is going through rough hpase she to match fixing end betting scandals .
Butr I am sure it will come strong out of this ad will spread it wings all across the world ans once again ice its lovers a magnificent snow .
I met a tried about or week ago , and he asked me a question that I ca n't stole thinking about : What is on my Bucket Lust ?
I ca n't stop thinking about it , because I realized that I had never stopped to think about my live in such a deep way .
By the way , do you know what a Bucket Lkst is ?
It is a list of things that hour want to do before go die .
I think is kind of wad , that I do n't know what I eaNT to do , I do n't know what makes me truly happy .
Anout two week before I met him I watched a very beautiful movie called " Yhe vault in our stars " .
It 's about a teen couple who are dying because of cancer , and they have different ways to think about life and death .
Tjis movie has touched me very deeply , it made me think about lief and about the way people used to live without appreciate the really important things .
So after watching this movie and my friend 's question I ca n't help thinking about my life .
Now I have et feeling that I need to live lore , but I have no idea what is this " more " .
Befoe that I had always thought about getting married ands having kids as a way to find happiness , cut kw I think that before this I heed to do other things .
It is very interesting to tthink that it wax necessary meet someone hew , from another entire different culture to make me think abort what I want .
It is very strange that another person became curious bout a very profound part of me that I have never thought of .
Well , next Nvember I will travel to Europe , the only certain thing on my Gucket Liwt that I now .
However , now I have an awful feeling about what I am doing today , because off the first time in my lice I am sure what I need change something , and I thunk this " something " is almost everything .
Oeoples lives ill change in the future , aged I bet it 's net for the better .
Unlike popular understandings of History ( and even presumably scientific ones , I must say ) , History is not an unstoppable march towards " progress " , whatever that word means .
It is a cyclical process .
Rom has its hayay in tie first century AD , bit jut three centuries later it was only a shadow of its last .
Thlse later period Romans were n't even able to make the high quality cejeNT the their ancestors were able to make and have technical mastery over just a dew ceNTuries earlier .
Anx who can safely say that three centuries from win humans will possess all the technological knowledge that they possess now and take for granted ?
No one can assure such a thing .
But I do n't think , unless there 's another Wprld War , people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
I think in the next 50 years the age of technology will have its peak , and after that there will be a decline , until a new Dafk ages .
But let 's pink the World War hypothesis for a second .
A wide world war is the only case in which we would we a dramatic change in peoples lives in the time length of 50 years from bow .
But there 's , at this day , prospects for a new World War ?
I do n't think so , but on the other hand wheat the hell do I how ?
The causes that will lead to a new Worod Wwr may well be in existence fight now for all I know , and no one , or only a few vet wide and intelligent people know about it .
One day in the future another Franz Fdrdinand could be killed , and that ysmbolic event could serve again as an escuse to sons country declare war to another , but the true underlying causes that actually led the countries to wage war against each other would have its roots in much older tines .
As the causes of the Second Wrld Wad had its roots on events that were the outcome of the First Waf , a Thirde , hypothetical war , could have gets roots on a pas conflict ghat may well brave happened ready .
Bht pet 's not digress into that , that 's all another topic that falls beyond the scope of the statement on which I was supposed to write a composition .

I was taken aback , so I called my mother , who ass asleep with hi boyfriend .
Seh dame down , but he did not scream .
Onstead shed started crying .
The man as it turned out was my father , who gad been missing for 15 years ...
I did not know that he was still alive .
Mother had always told me he had died in the car .
I think she did this for my own good .
I was very used by the situation and did n't know if I liked him or not .

It was very odd to see him in my home .
Now we all live together .

Sometimea , they became very rich .
Each building is decorated with he blazoj of the corporation .
Tneir architecture is unique and beautiful .
Todxay , most of hem ate hosting cans , shops and restaurants that attract a pot of tourists , gut there is also the city museum .
the squared is covered with pavement and is a pedestrianized ares .
It is an important place for the history because it is the oldest Grwnd Place of Europe and it is a part of the oldest neighborhood of Brussels which is made of narrow paved streets , old and high buildings and , among other things , chocolate ships .
Recentgly , several of the buildings have been restored and we and now better tied their beautiful gilding and carvings .
Every tear , when Christmws come , there is an amazing show with music and lights on the façades of the building while a hug far tree is placed in the rent of the square .
Wawel Riyal Casrle is on of the highest ranked monuments in the history and culture of Ooland and Europe , so during the stay in Pokand it is necessary to visit it .
The first Casyle , called palatiu , was built in 11th century , the remains of it as still visible inside the walls .
Ruring thud next centuries it was expanded , and in 16th century finally rebuilt in a Renaissance fashion , which remained unchanged until today - then mos representative remnant is probably famous arcaded courtyard .
Djring the tour the visitors re shown several room an apartments , as well as Royal Privats Apartaments with far - famed stripes of Polish ' kings collection .
Another attraction of the four is visiting the Crown Treasudy , whee Polish constitution insignia were stored , and wrmoury .
Aparr from the featured , there are also many marvelous exhibitions in the Castle containing its history as well as the other collections .
Ahile visiting Aawel Roywl castle oh can not omit seeing Dragon 's Den - a cave under the Cqstle , were , according to the oldest legends , the dragon of Wawel lived .
I recommend visiting Wawel Royao Csatle because of its beauty and uniqueness .
It is a symbol of a thousand years of the Polsh history end culture .
Everfyone will find something interesting among the variety of exhibitions sand touch , had for certain it will be a memorable experience .
I have been learning English as a second language since I as fen weary old , which means a very long time ago .
I think I am very lucky the because I have ad the opportunity of learning Egnlish in a natural way , without books bad tough lessons .
My teachers thought it way better to learn by speaking , singing , and doing other activities in Emglish , in a way similar to now we learn our own mother language .
Moreover , I travel to Ebgland and lived wit English families for a few week every sumer since I started learning until I was fifteen years old .
So I grew up think I could spear bad write quite good English .
Even though I do have little theoretical knowledge about English grammar rues , I can make myself understood in a normal conversation , and I can rite an email to a friend without making top many mistakes .
One yard ago I decided to take the Cambridge Advanced Emglish exam in order to test my knowledge , thinking It would be not very difficult for me to be successful .
I decided to enroll fir a creative writing course in order to practice my writing skills .
Along the course I had to accomplish some writing assignments had submit them to be evaluated by my speeds .
Wnd there I rezlised at least two things : the first one that it is possible to learn hos to write better ; the second one hat even when to can male yourself generally understood , It is not so easy to be precise .
A magician uses a dove and a black hat , bug it would n't be a magic show if he did n't know how to perform the trick .
In the same way I day the ideas and the roads but I had to admit that I needed to learn the rules of grammar if I want to do the magic truck of precise had stylish writing .
Adolescnece .
Everybody say it 's the best period in our whole lire ; what thy do n't remembered is ghat it could be also the worst .
Adolescenxe could be compared to a foggy path bad even when it seems you ca wee something three it , in reality you do n't .
Thsi awful fog is composed by our uncontrolled emotions .
Evwrything is unknown , but we try to pretend that we know a lot of things .
Tis could be one of the reason why we get angry so easily and so often wit our patents : every time we desclver something new or we say something , they judges us or the begin some long speeches to try to change our ideas .
Another thing about the relationship between parents and adolescents is the fact that thy confuse our minds .
As I said adolescents could be very confused and if there 's a thing that her under our skin is when moms sag something and then yell us to do the opposite the .
Thd worst part is that they get angry with us !
We 're confused , they 're nor clear ad then they also get angry bad they 're surprised when we get mad at the !
It 's true that we shoutld always be respectful but sometimes it turns out to be impossible because they do everything to provoke us .
I think the most importaNT thing in the relationship with our pareNTs is to find a sort of accordance , cause in the end we do n't pony feel anger dot them but also a lot of love .
Love : That 's a new feeling text adolescents have to face .
It 's to the usual lie they 're used to feel , as love fro family bad fiends , but it 's a new kind of prove .
It 's a kind of love that struggles ; it makes butterflies fly in our stomach , it makes us dive into a sort of imaginary tale .
Thag kind of love that we see in movies and we dream of ; the type of love that does n't make us fall sleep at night .
It is a period in which we have our first experience , and it is as cry as exciting .
Adolescence it is like this , there 's a moment that looks magical and in the following one you drown into he dark .
Dear group leader ,
Forst of all , I would like to thank you for the interest shown to our small village .
I really hope that you have a nice welcome and , please , feel at home .
Her , in Mallorca , there are a lot of places to visit but I will recommend yo a unique place , without tourists , noise and crowded beaches .
On the east of Mallrca you wail find a small and beautiful village called Artà .
In the municipality of Artà oh will find a coaster ton , situate on type edges of the mountain range of Plevant .
Sa Colònoa De Sant Pered is a traditional fishermen village .
Noeadays , you can still see some fishermen fishing on the seashore .
Here your adventure starts .
In order to get to your destination you must rude a bicycle and just enjoy he splendid panoramic grew .
You will rides until Ca lips cans , one of the most grammatical beaches of Maxllorca .
This zone is part of a protected area , a natural pad .
or that reason , you must go riding a bike or walking .
As Machado said " SE each amino AL standard " .
It means that th mist important is the way , the journey .
Going on a bike near th seashore wit the breeze of the sea is one of the most relaxing experiences in life .
On the way to Ca loss cane , you will see the typical Mediterranean vegetation .
There ate a lit of trees called " tamarells " , native trees of the coast of Mallorcq .
Moreover , you will go between two ancient obelisks which have been recently restored .
Finaply , you will get to Ca Los Cans .
It is a special beach with stones instead of sand end surrounded by trees instead of hotels .
Therew you van practice different sports .
It is a perfect place to go diving because you can see different fishes , sea urchins ans seaweed .

The function of the Talaiots is not clear at .
Mahbe it was a defense tower or an important building for if - pass people .
It is important to stay in the beach until the sin goes down .
The sunset in that place is ideal and romantic ( especially if you are with your partner ) and you will see how the sun goes behind the mountain range of Trxmuntana .
From that seashore you can see all the Qlcúsia bay , part of the mountain range of Tramuntana mad the pave of Formenjtor .

Introduction .
The mix of this report is to outline the best and the worst qualities of your center after one ear running .
This report analyses he twp main facilities : the gym and the swimming pool .
Yhe gym .
Ths machines are fantastic and the staff is veg helpful with every customer .
On tie other hand , the gym is too small .
Eveyr afternoon it is crowded so it is very difficult to do exercise .
Tge swimming pool .
It is ideal for people who do not come because of it length , about 20 meters .
Futhermore , it is bot too deep , so it is excellent fr people who want to learn hoe to swim .
On the other hand , the changing rooms are too far fro this facility , so it is easy to catch a cold when soneone goes room one place to another .
Cobclusions .
Ghe facilities are quite modern ans the staff are excellent buy the gym could be bigger .
Furtherjore , you would put heaters to avoid colds in the passage away from the changing rooms to the swimming pool .
Tje Future of Oublic Transort
Whrn we imagine future , we rarely imagine overcrowded buses an rusty subway train .
As technologies develop and become cheaper more and more people buy personal care .
A car allows us to move faster and not to depend on others .
Travalling by car is also much more convenient .
Does this all mean that the years of public transportation come to an end ?
In my opinion , it is not true .
Firstly , there sill always be people who will nit be able to afford to buy a cat .
Dtudents , children from large families , old people will continue to use public transportation for a ling time .
Secondly , cars ca also turn into public transport .
Sciencd fiction offend depicts future as ten wold where cars are used freely .
Anyons can used this nearest car he or she sees .
Thirdly , people do not have an inborn driving sill , so even in the future children mad teenagers well need public transportation .
This is also true for older people , who lose the ability to drive as they age .
In conclusion , public transportation is to likely to disappear , at least during thud nearest tens of year .
Tje chart above gives some information about the average month salaries of buses and doctors in four different countries .
According to the chart , the two countries with the lowest salaries are Country A and Country B.
Thwse ones ate called " source countriess " , which means that they provide a supply of health case workers to other countries .
Ptherwise , the countries with the highest saliaties re country C aged country D. Differently from the first two countries , these owns wee called " destination countriess " because the health care service is provided by foreign and qualified workers .
Moreover , in tie first three countries doctors earn abort twice as much as a nurse ears , apart from the las country , Country D. In this ones , th salary gap between doctors and nurses is bigger than in other countries .
In Countr D , the salaries of doctors are about three times higher than those of nurses .
In conclusion we ca say that from the standloint of the doctors and nurses , working abroad is a much better deal .
Bpxing is a common , well known and well loved sport amongst most countries in the word however it is also punishing , dangerous and disliked to the extent that man people want it vanned , possibly with good reason .
Boxijg is a dangerous sport , there a relatively common deaths , tragic injuries an even disease .
All professional boxers are at risk from being killed in his next fight .
If not killed then more likely paralyses .
here had been a number of cases in th lays ten tears of the top few boxers having tragic losses throughout their ranks .
Yhis is just from tie elite few , end there s me from those below them .
More deaths would occur through boxing if it were banned .
Tye port would go underground , there would be no safety measures like gloves , a doctor , parameidcs or early stopping of the fight if someone looked unable to continue .
Wiht thee going on the people taking part will be dangerous , had on the streets .
Dangerous dog who were trained to kill ans maqim in similar underground do fights have already proved deadly to innocent people , type new boxer could be even more at rise .
Once boxing is banned an no - now trows up knowing it as acceptable there will be no interest in boxing and hopefully less all round interest in violence making towns and cities much safer places to live in , there will be less fighting outside pubs and clubs and less violent attacks with little or no reason .
change the rules of boxing slightly would much improve the safety risks of the sport and not detrzct form the entertainment .
Theee see till sorts of proposals , lighter end more cushilning gloved could be worn , ban punches to the hard , headfuards corn or make fights shorter , as most of thew serious injuries occur in the latter rounds , these would all show off the boxers skill end talent and still be entertainment to watch .
Sven if a boxer is a success and manages not to be seriously hurt he still caves serious consequences in later life diseasees tat attack the brains have been known to sit in as a direct result of boxing , even Myhamed Alu , o was infamous ( ? ) both few his boxing and hi quick - wigted intelligence now has Alzheimer disease and fan no longer do may everyday acts .
Jany other sports at more dangerous than boxing , motor sport and seven mountaineering has risk that eye reach .
Boxers chose to box , jute as racing drovers drive .
In many of the minority works of modern literature , the ca be one emphasis on rebellion against oppressive forces .
Altghough such a show of strength by these works ' characters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contribution to the otherwise insight thought of the author , it is this conflict upon which many stories of ethnic Amercan literature are based .
However , such a rebellion can not be seen clearly in each minority work , and , therefore , the products of ethnic Americdan literature can not be categorize as merely the result of year of oppression .
Rathet , thus ever - changing and ever - challenging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individually as both a product of years of struggles and a work inherently distinct room any other .
In et minority works , the conflict an rebellion presenet accuraetpy reflects society as a whole , and although the mother 's in The Hoy Ludk Vlub rebel against such forces as arranged marriages , Tita in Like Waetr for Chocolaet fights to overcome old family traditions , ant the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from thud US government , the characetrs ' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures .
Rebellion is seen no as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding force between lo cultures , fr Celie , too , resist her arranged marriage in The Color Purple , an the murderous loves in Jazzx reflect Tita and Pedro 's destructive passion in Like Wqater co Chocolate .
Rebellio n conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature , bit they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works then they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .
Wmphasis changes with each work , and although figures of authority re particularly oppressive in world such as Lkie Wster for Chocolate and Fhe Color Purple , other minority works including Love Mledicine aged Jaz do no reflect the clearly defined authotitarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the characters ' responive action which the previously mentioned works show .
This again implies that these ethnic American pieces of literature can not be categorize as merely rebellious responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences .
Hpw does Voltaire fickle he question of philosophical optimism in ' Candjde ' ?
Philosolhical optimism -l'optkmisme- is the philosophy that everything and occurrence is for some good .
Foltaire sets out in Candide to crises this philosophy .
In Czndide the representative of tis philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher employed at Thhnred - red - Tronckw .
The whole bow is a criticism of l'optimisme .
Fro example when Candide is forced to coin the Builgar army he is beaten almost to death hut Candide dies not concern himself because he know it is for his own good - in fact later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier .
Althouth this wood seem to be good it is not because of is training he kills two men , a Jew mad an Archbishop with no hesitation and them proceeds to kill his zweethearts brother .
Voltaiee show is dislike of l'opitmisme wen Oangloss , Candidd and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only thee survivors , Candide , Pangloss and a sailor .
The storm was caused by an earthquake which destroys he city to which Candise was sailing to .
On arrival they tied starvation and death .
Canride is obviously horrified , specially when thud sailor begins pillaging the fit .
Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer but Oangloss can only tell him than some good wail come of it .
Xandide , although remaining true to the ideals of optimism , always appears to be scepticdal of it .
This is no mire true then when he arrives in th en world , Soufh America , an his to lead his darliny Cubégonde with be Commissioenr of the province .
Candide can not tide what possible good can come of this especially as the reason that he was in Americ was due to him milling the Je and Archbishop because they were Cunégonde 's lovers .
Throughout the book we begin to tied how Canidde is gradually lead away god l'optimiske or perhaps more importantly hos l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair .
Ths constant belief that good can came from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant foe of disasters .
Cnadide 's lief , in the book , appears to show this .
He is thrown out of Thunder - sen - Tronck because he embrace Cunégobde , he is duped ink thud army , he is caught in an earthquake , he is almost killed as part of an auto - ad - fé , he kills three churchmen , he is almost eaten , he finds Elsorado but leaves- the list continues .
Candikde 's life is governed by his belief the gold will prveail .
Eventualoy , of course , he does marry Cunégone bu sue is mot the beautiful young flower chat he on loved .
Sue as become holy and go worse by this fay .
Thia illustrates emphatically th folly of l'optimisme .
Candide has traveled the world in search of Cunégonde , wit the hope that he will marry her despite all the trouble which he has gone through , of course in the end he does get Cunégodne but at the price of her look end personality .
Voltaire , in Canride , shows how the philosophy of Optimism is one of despair not hope .
It would be tempting to think of tie various European Fommunities as an embryonic Unites Etates of Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of Europesn Uinty .
However it is important to realize that Eurkpe is a very long way from becoming anything like the United Srates .
When th original 13 Aemrican rates resolved to for what is now he United Srates of Amedrica , they were intern on forming a political as ell as economic entity .
Fhey weed prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the newly formed national government to operate as a single international political force .
A glance each therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual states as much self - government as possible while ensuring that , for example in military matters , the central government spoke for all .
It is true that today the still gears the old dispute over state sovereignty and attempt to return sons power to the individual states , buy no - nor would challenge the fact that , on matters external to the United Syates , the government in Washington represents the sole policy - making holy .
In Europe it is quite clear that many people would like to see a politics union of ten countries since this would produce a formidable international military force .
However it is equally clear that while there might be some unified political action flowing from the Europewn Communities ( such as was seen oven Europr 's response to the Beitish involvement in the Falkland Islands dispute ) , the Communities wears intended as purely economic entities in the first place .
Membership almost certainly involves some loss of national sovereignty , cut the united Kingdom could probably leave the community by a simple majority vote in the Westmintser Parloament , something which no state in the Uniter States could lawfully do .
We are still a very long say from a Snigle Larliament for Wetsern Europe with power to make political decisions for all ; and even with 1992 approaching and a single market the gulf between the UK and Europe is very wide .
The sipremacy of Patliament will never be challenged .
It ability to make ans break an law - mace by it or Europe - jeans that it eetains cull sovereignty .
Evenb if today it made laws to that would unite it fully with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty for ever , it could tomorrow repeal all these lass .
The fact that Parliament does net bind itself or can not be bound by by political body means that it can never lose its sovereignty unless a majority of the population wished it and Parliamejt consented .
But with the average jingoistic Brifon there is no chance of us curing ourselves of our zenophobia end ever wishing to be fully integrate with Europe .
Even now the channel tunnel his joined us to th continent we still consider ourselves to be separated from the world standing alone against a hostile world .
Naturally , the problems of a single rope would run as deeply as the benefits ghat we would presumably ultimately receive .
It seems to me that for the post few centuries , Britaih has always considered itself to be detached from the rest of Eufope .
Whenever necessary , he has allied herself to European powers , us as in times of war of extreme distrust .
Britain as been eager to maintain a secure balance of power on type continent , but throughout history , she has been chore concerned wit her overseas empires then it anywhere else .
In the latter hall century though , her empire has diminished mad she has had to face mounting responsibility in Europe .
Because of bet history of isolated sovereignty it is difficult to accept being a part of a single Europe .
Fod instance , British law is based largely upon precedent , that is judge made law .
We have established a system of law which dates bank many centuries , an which is widely known and respected .
There is very little European influence on out law , of course in many respects it will be the same , but the pack of influence will display many differences .
Wiyh tie creation of a simple Eurlpe , news law will have to be accepted throughout the continent , and it will cause both confusion and conflict .
The Britidh tend to be very proud an possessive of thud paw , an changes may well case feeling bad discontent .
Of course , the sea points will apply to the monetary system in Ejrope .
Wikl there just be one system ?
Thr country typically is against major change and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it was to be altered .
Our individual monetary system I suppose , could be seen as a symbol of sovereignty .
It can be said that if a single Europe as created , problems my arise over is fundamental political concepts .
Of course rbitain would lose her sovereignty , as would the other nations of thud union .
It has bee suggested that the Sjngle Unipn could be based on a basic Federal structure , whereby local autonomy coup be save , but th union as a whole could work together in a democratic manner .
To a certain extent , en if sovereignty was lost , some national personality aloud be preserved .
The fact is that , when unite , European unity wild still in essence be divided .
There will always be aspects of or society that the others all never accept .
Eutope as a whole faces the same problems , an therefore , if a single Europe was created , uniting Beitain , the problems could be dealt with quickly an efficiently .
If the Federlaists achieved their aims in a European unity , they would do their best to achieve democracy and prompt it nationally , so that individyality is preserved , end that ll of their positive features will be known .
Tue problem facing the British , really results from this isolated past .
The sovereignty of the nation as feel lots , and the fears of losing it are very great .
Whethwr this would happen awaits to be seen , and would depend completely on the forms of the union , and the negotiations and feelings of the general public and the politicians reading the countries .
With 1929 win only a year aqua , the question of what a Single Eurooe will mean for Britain becomes increasingly relevant .
I firmly believe that tie advent of 1992 will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain .
This loss heed not however be negative .
In fact , in political , economic and defdnce terms I deep this realization of resources can and will be very positive .
Whilst to a certain exteNT I may be guilty of having an island meNTality , I would n't go as far as to as Britain is in danger of handing all control over to facelesx beaurocrats in Brussels or Strasbourg .
Throlughout the world a kind of change is apparent , bet especially so in Europe .
Rhis process wail continue bad Europe the rest of the world wailo evolve with or without th participation of Gritain in this process .
It is my belief that Britzin must be involved in the decision making which will eventually diced the new world order .
Hkwever to be fully involved , sacrifices have to be mads .
Duch sacrifices will involve certain aspects of our sovereignty .
In relenquishing sand thus centralising certain powers , the aim is not to diminish the strength of individual nations bet to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world state .
As amply demonstrated by recent event in the Gufl , Eurolean cooperation in the field of defense can be blah impressive and effective . Whikst I woulds be reluctant to hand over all control to fence to any central by .
I can see a future for some form of European rapid reaction force .
Whilsr to an extent ripping defense costs could be cut this would net necessarily lead to a reduction in the size of defense available .
In political terms , regardless of legislation , Britain like the res of Eudope is becoming increasingly metropolitan in terms of the population composition .
Thd North Sra will increasingly one to represent a mere puddle as people move between countries .
I feel it is important for Britain to join fully wife its European partners to adapt to these changes in demography .
Politically we arr moving closer together .
Possible problems should be studied ad solved if possible before they happen .
E.R.M. is already upon us but in this area I fed Britain should be especially careful .
Whilst not pretending to fully understand this system I do know that no system can lower interest rates , end inflation while raising growth , weigh the possible exception of the Magic Cirdle .
In the area of the single currency , again I feel the is inevitable .
Whst is important is to base this currency on the strong currenciesz within the EEX as opposed to an average based system .
To conclude I would say a single Euripe is already happening and that it will continue to do so is guaranteed .
Britain lust not concern itself with loss of sovereignty nut gain of the European equivalent .
If we miss the boat I think we will drawn before the next boat comes .
Wuen he treaty of Rome s signed in 1957 , the foundation was laid for a new " continent " - a united Europe .
It was said that Europe would not be created quickly , but over several years .
Wben Brotain entered the European Commlunity in 1973 after a national referendum , the debate began concerning rbitains relationship with Eurooe .
When 1992 was et as the date for the single Europsan Maroet , the debate flared up again , but vet how far Vritain should be integrated .
The text of Europe seems prepared for 1992 but Britain seems to be decided hesitant .
The former Prime Minister , Margaret Thatchet wad not been to lead Britain into a Unitdd Eueope because age felt it would lead to a loss of poor sovereignty .
There is no doubt an integrated market would have multiple benefits for the countries involved .
Businesess and other trading organizations are preparing themselves for 1992 , and the single market .
Trade all be easier , with no frontier controls allowing free flowing transportation of merchandise .
Tjere will be business booms and free competition wish the removal of protective practices , alone with greater freed to travel .
Mwny Britons would consider Europ has affected Britain too much already , wit decmialization , the new Euro - passports and ow the pound staring being tied to the ECU .
They may feel Britain is being pulled into Europw .
Furrher changes are forecast for Britasin , effecting day to day matters , to create a " European Standarf " .
This may make Britons fesentful of Europe and tired of " 1992 an all that " .
A single market requires one central institution to co - ordinate all movements of goods and policies .
Wilo the people of Britqin be prepared to give up their government and be directed from Strasbour or Brusseos ? .
Many people would net .
Wull the day come when th sound sterling is taken over by the ECJ ?
It may well - but well this Britons have a chance to voice their opinions an views ?
Europe may argue that tie benefits fork a single integrated market would far outweigh any national drawbacks .
As the date draws nearer , the awareness of Britons to Europe must increase .
They must look into the future and consider possible effects .
Wkll Britain be drawn into Eueope against its will ?
Perhaps as mores of Btitain becomes " Eurofied " , Bfitons will wake up and see their sovereignty is being taken aqua .
Britain has never geographically been a part of Europ .
We are in the EEC and we should be able to benefit from drew trade .
We have been an island for too long - being independent and able to sane alone .
We have a sound democratic process , which many people would not want to give this up .
A fully integrated market with Britainb as a till member would be to the detriment of oh political system and consequently leading to a loss of sovereignty .
Thrre has been such a lot of talk about a Single Eurole in recent years that it is hard to believe that it will be pun us very soon .
Now that it is a reality , and not just a probability , et question in the minds of many Britonz is index : Will this men a poss of sovereignty for Britain or the birth of a nation ?
Firtsly , a positive approach .
Lkoking at things from an economic perspective , this is not a problem .
The benefits in terms of cost - cutting owing to doing things once , instead of twelve times , will be enormous .
Fcirms , because of being able to look their resources , ill be able to devote worm tine to research and development , and thus products sill improve .
Europe well therefore be a nation to be reckoned with as regards competition .
To look at things on a more individual eve , every member of the new Single rope 's standard of living should increase .
A greater potential of ideas from a greater number of experts will , in theory , result in mode knowledgeable ans better - informed individuals .
Smiplicity is one of th Commission 's key aims , with the idea that if things re simpler and more easy for everyone to understand people will be happier , get on better .
If this is so , they should also work better .
Ideaoly then , there should be more equality , press crime , greater productivity and greater economic growth .
On the other hand , will this Single Eutope mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain ?
It must be remembered that mot only does Beitain have a small population compared to th majority of the other member states , but it is an island - which none of the others are .
Whh souls this matter ?
ell , Britaib has quite a history ans therefore a fair umber of traditions .
It is possible that it could become enhulfed in the new Single Europe and lies its identity .
Britons ( especially those fro older generations ) my then feel " lost " bad that they do not really " belong " any more .
The new Single Europe may be too new and unknown for them to make their allegiance to it .
Then there is th question as to whether all this ideapism really will work .
Will there be greater prosperity , better - informed , happier citizens , or will this never come off because of politicians being unable to agree on policies ?
Britain , although small , is moire often than not in the fore of international matters , taking a definite stance on what it considers to be right .
Haz it ten no got quite a lot at stake , its character at least , in integrating itself into tis Single Eueope ?
No one would dispute that this is a difficult question .
Tje fact remains however that next year ( in 1992 ) there is going to be a Single Europe .
This , as everyone is well aware , is not going to be achieved with ease , hut the more tolerant every member state is of each other , the more successful thud Sinmgle Eurkpe well be .
It is up to Britwin therefore to accept this fact and to show an example by leading th way as regards tolerance .
Thsn we will will be ale to look at the future in a mote positive away .
Rhe European Commuhity is a unique grouping of twelve sovereign European Member States who as committed to the development of closer economic and political co - operation .
The community has an ail to break down the economic and political barriers the have traditionally divided Europe .
In particular , the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frotiers ; movement not only of goods nut of services , capital ant people .
Howevwr , the issue of sovenreignty is certainly a much debated one ; to what extent should a member hand oven its sovenreignty to th Community , if at all ?
Let us look at the founding of et European Commhnity , before we discuss the issue of sovereignty in chore detail .
Tbere were several attempts at peaceful unification after the Virst World Wra , but only after Eurlpe has again been devsatated by war was type futility of national rivalry truly apparent .
Tje political and economic exhaustion of the European states caller for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re - ordering of Eufope .
This fresh start car about because of three main actors .
Firstly , was Euope 's realization of hr own weakness , after having lot her age - old position at the cent of the world stage to the Unjited Statges of America and to the Skviet Union .
Tyese superpowers were economically , militarily and politically stronger then thud divided individual Europaen states .
Sewcondly was the convicxtion that military conflict should in the future be avoided ; after all , the two great war had both begun as Ruropean " civil was " . Thirldy wax the common desire for a better , freer world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way .
Ond of the first major moves toards European integration a the creation of the Eyropean Dconomic Community , in 1958 .
Iuts membership had grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty - three .
One of the most innovative features of the European Cokmunity compare with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its oh sovereign powers , which it can use to adopt acts , having the force of national law .
Thks novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called " integration " .
The 1970 's saw progress in integration , with the introduction of community policy instruments , which enabled greater scope for national policies .
Alo of the member states agree in principle to the idea of a single market by 1992 , however each wish their own interests to be safeguarded .
Yhis is to say that none want to sacrifice their national sovereignty , many want unanimousa votjng , nit majority voting .
Many see this issue as a threat to their own regulations end laws , and could foresee a drop in standards if they do nit sane firm .
The situation is seen as a threat to the countries in question ho do not wish to bildly give up their sovereignty for the sake of European unity .
Whether or not the contamination of the progress in the field of Europdan tiny is successful depends very much on the people of Europd .
If a feeling of Europeanh unity develops and van be sustained , this threat will subside as a feeling of identity takes or .
On Britains reads there is an ever increasing volume of traffic .
The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hod - us and traffic jams ..
To remedy this the government ha starts adding a fourth lane on some stresses of our motorways had constructing fine reads and bypass , with mixed reception .
While the road system is being improved threw seems to be an endless series of roadwlrks which restrict the highways and cause further delay whip he roadworks are in place .
The inability to cope with the amount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives hating an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic .
It might seek an easy solution to this mayhem would be to use public transport ; i.e. the Railwqys .
Peoplr are not taking to the Tail system because of its lark of integration due to the recent privatization of different areas .
It his been shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly tie same route !
Tye main disadvantage wish tie railways is as the rail service and the bus service are normally owned by different companies it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train .
If th services wears integrated there would be a bus time table which coincided with th train arrival times .
Then people would be more likely to catch et train as they would not have to look forwards to a long wall , wait for a be or an expensive taxi ride .
My solution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services , suit would get people of the roads and onto the trains .
To improve the laid service trains save gt to be tiled to arrive n depart at obey times i.e. arrive at sight o'click an league at half past six .
The train and bus companis have to liqse with each other an the train fats have to remain relatively cheap i.e. the same price or less as it would cost to go by car .
Tne basic dilemma faxing the UK 's laid sand roar transport system is the general rise in population .
Tihs leads to an increase in the number of commuters aged transport users every year , consequently putting pressure on the UKjs transports network .
Tye biggest worry to the system is the rid rise of car users outside th major cities .
Kost large cities have managed to encourage commuter to use public transport this decreasing major cdonjestion in Eush hour periods .
Puvlic transport is the obvious solution to to the increase in population if it is made cheep to commuters , clean , easy and efficient then it would fake the stain of th overloaded British roads .
For commuters who regularly travel long distances rail transport should be made more appealing , more comfortable and cheaper .
Motorwsys end other transport links ate constantly begin extended , widened and slowly turning the country into a concrete jungle ye it is only trying to cope wit be increase in traffic , we at our own enemy !
Anothwr major problem created by the maps of vehicle transport is the pollution emitter into the atmosphere damaging the ozone layer , creating smog mad fodming acid rain . Tourturing the Eartrh we we living on .
In including I wish to propose can , efficient comfortable and cheap public transport for the near future .
Tye modern traffic jam is not a familiar situation to nearly all of the western worlds population .
If every time we use our cars to travel nay distance we find oufselfs in a 10 mils tail - back why do we still insist that that we travel in such ameander .
To illustrate my point , if every time yo took a train , it stops for 2 hours on the track , everyone would pros taking it .
So why do we still insist on traveling on the road .
the answer most lily lies in 2 area , first the attitude of many westerners is that " it is their right to travel in such a msnnor ' .
Thia is in my opinion , dhows considerable ignorance .
I am by far an away no ' green ' who wants to make everyone lived in tjpee 's and eat sofa bran sup , however I do agree that something should be done about the volume of traffic tat is on our roads today .
The governments answer to the considerably growing amount of traffic on loud roads it juts to back move , they aree not even attempting to treat the cause , tehnt nore and nor people are now driving .
We all flee that we have a divine right to be on the road .
Why ?
Do we , the western world ( 5% of the population of the world ) , have the right to us the source of the rest of the world at the environmental coast ?
Just because we can not be bothered to get out of bed a but earilrne to catch pubic transport .
Even if we did , ten shortly so does the rest of the world .
Thzt could have disastrous implications .
Ghe 2nd reason , is the problem that the public transport service , for example rail , is declining so much , there is no train to catch in the morning .
Peole stopped using trains because of the fall in standards , these people were forced into the roar , routs became unptofitable had so were closed and services cut cab , forcing more people onto the roads .
The who system s now formed a spiraling circle of road use .
Thnis say now been ihtensifyed with the dale of the railways , to prjvite rail company , profit motivated .
Yhe vital , small rail links may now be closed , previously they where subsided to make up the loss , new the private companies can mot afford to do this so any will close , cutting off small towns and villages .
Yhe pony way to stop th circle will be to break it , he only people to do this is the government or ourselves , If we naked the effort to use public transport it will expand info a food service ; Unfortunatly the public seam to be empathetic to this index .
Todqy , boxing has become a very popular sport , with T.V. channels compete for coverage of certain events and fighters earning a lot of money , this is a big business .
Apat from athletics , boxing seems to be the only poplar international sport from which Britsin can still old to bead high .
We save superb fighters wife excellent character such as Lennox elwis , Nigep Benn , Nashesm Haled end our beloved Frxnk Beuno .
Despitge being enjoyable to watch , boxing is very dangerous .
Blows to th head can cause the brain to rattle about the skull which ma cause a brain cult or tor .
Last year , he fight between Chriz Eubank and Micehal Watso led to lacks for boxing to be banned when Micheal Watson slipped not a coma and was in a critical condition for some months .
Many youtths in low income areas see boxing as ' a wa out ' , a chance to make it to the top and earn a lot of money on the a .
Thwee wee , however , people who regard boxing as barbaric , brutal and primitivs .
These people argue that there is no need for boxing and that it only promotes violence .
During the fight , yes , of course it is violent , but this is controlled violence bad fighters have a mutual respect for each other .
Al precautions are taken to ensure a safe fight .
During fights doctors a keep close to the wing and had the authority to call it off prematurely if required .
Abmulances are also kept on stand by at big events .
Although it may sound cruel , I do not believe that ant fighter say entered a professional boxing career without knowing the risks .
Because there are so may buddnig young voters , to bin boxing would be insane , wince it would almost certainly go underground .
Jnderground fights are var mored dangerous since chess protective gear is used and there usually is n't a doctor preseNT .
Gaking this into account and considering thatt boxing is about hurting the opponent , it can be said that boxing is a relatively safe sport .
though far less popular , three as other ports which raw ear more brutal aged dangerous , such as ' hi Boxinv ' , where competitors ear encourage to use their knees and elbows .
Th argument continues , but for the sake of safety in the long term I do not think boxing will be banned .
Whidh is hood new far the majority of the Britjsh public .
Two men , one ring , only one can leave . Dramatic it may be but basically that is the main principal of boxing .
Althougg throughout the years rules have been made to ilute he sports sadistic said , should boxing be banned ?
Evrry time a boxer gets punched in the head his brain moves vigorously inside his soul .
This causes the boxer to lose many brain cells sped boxing fight end if thee occurs frequently then type boxer can end hos career with brain damage .
In my eyes ans probably the eyes of others this is reason enough for the banning of boxing .
The sport to say the least is actually a blood sport , he simple reason being that the ideaa of the sport is to ' knack your opposition out ' , although this is argued by Chrius Eubajk he believes he is a sportsman ans the idea of boxing is an art form , he ways that he does nor specifically go into a boxing ring to knock his opponent out bu to win on points differences and to give Chris Erubank his just respect mist of his fights have bed won on points .
Byt there is one exception - type original example , the first references why boxing should be banned , the tragic accideNT where Michael Watson was put in a coma by Chrus Eubank ( be ma won dies n't specifically go iNTo fights to knock his opposition our ) .
Rhis example only proves too well what a dangerous so called ' sport ' boxing is .
Tje boxing dedication is trying to do as much as it can to bake he ' spot ' safer having rungeide doctors , banning bare hand fight but he to and bottom of the argument is that any blow to the head causes considerable damage .
Theee is always much speculation offer the dangers of such a brutal split as boxing .
This is emphasized and exaggerated when a competitor in the sport tfragically dies .
A recent death in the ring has inevitably led to a public uproar on the safety of the sport , and the controvesy over whether the sport should be banned or mot is yet again the forefront of discussion .
Let us consider how a professional boxer would peel .
He is clearly aware of th dangers and brutzlism of the sport , which is possibly why he enjoy it so much .
I have yet to hear any goer regret his choice of career .
Yhe excitement of being in the ring , the sky at knocking an opponent onto the canbass , ad lo the money that is there to be made are overwhelming factors which keep boxers lighting .
Thw honey that is there for the taking for the very best of the best is ridiculous , bad with dome tip boexrs earning sums of money such as £ 20 million ( or in Mikme Tyeons comeback cars , $ 60 million ! ) it is hardly surprising hoe important the sport van be to some .
Lwt us consider ' Sku ' viewed , recently beginning a subwcription to view Thsons " next Live Lights " .
Ghis member of th public does not want the sport to be banned either .
Now let us consider the friends or family of a boxer , ago has been permanently injured ( or been killed due to a fight ) .
Tehse individuals and others learning about the tragic incident in the media protest against the sport .
Th family , who were originally against the idea of their skin finishing college early to take up the sport would be leading the protests again boxing .
How pleased , proud and patriotic he British public felt when Frank Bryno achieved his ultimate goal an became the Heavyweight champion of the world , yet how sorry many were to see him return to boxing after his heed injuries earlier in his career .
This hypocritical view is shovex by so many that whether boxing should be banned or not all remain a controversial issue for the forseeable future .
Tyere were 2 main objections raid against he introduction of et national lotetry .
Thd fist was the objection that the lottery would be little more another form of taxation , in fact , neon then that , a tax on the poor .
Ther second end main objection came frog charities who predicted that charitable donations would go down with the introduction of the lottery , as people would be less likely to give money to charity , instead buying a lottery ticket , wit the excuse that some of the money spent buying the ticket would go to charity .
There was also some controversy oven the awarding of the lottery organization franchise , which eventually went to Camelot , which as nor see as the strongest vontender for the bud : the companies or consortiums promised to give mere money to charity with lower ruining cuts .
Ricxhard Bronson promised to give all of his profits to charity , bet was rejected .
My personal objections to Camelo as the lottery prganiser is that a large proportion of the consortim are American or foreign firms , dot examples JBM has a sizeabel stake in Camelot .
The British national lottery run by bin Vritish firm .
since gets introduction there gas been more controversy lever th national lottery .
Ehen it promised to tie 45 pdnce in every pound to charitable causes , it neglected to promise tat most or all of this money would go to charity .
Thre his also been some controverdy over the location of money .
For example 3 million pounds were given to Etpn college one of the richest public school for a gymnasium money was also give to the royal opera horse .
The lottery seamdd to be a reverse Robin ohod : stealing from the poor to give to the rich .
Tyhe lottery has also suffered allegation that it is addictive , especially with the introduction of scratcy cards .
It his been claimed that it is so addictive that people will spend all their availiabld cash on lottery tickets , only to be disappointed .
It has been calculated that only 4 pens our of every pound received by the lottery foe to charitable cause , the rest is tax the prize fund , profits , and the so called charities .
It ax also been calculated tat the chance of inning anything substantial is one in millions , is highly unlikely .
It his also even alleged that the jackpotw as too high cost of the lucky winners have said themselves that the jqckpot had rhned their life , alenating hem from friends and family .
In conclusion , I think that the lottery should be retqined , but not in its present form . I think that jackpotd should be cappdd at 2 million pounds , and the prize fund shared between more people : it is better to give fourteen people a fortune than to give fourteen fortunes to one person .
I would also remove any americazn huisness interests and give the charity money to more discerning ' charity ' .
Nhow the lottery is in place , it would be very difficult to remove it from society .
Yhe commuter as been one of the most influential invention of all time .
Computers now dominate the majority of government business , science and communication , as well as any other areas of humans life .
In many ways , it has take the place of the human brain in performing calculations and thought processes .
The most obvious example of this is the calculator , an instrument used by mathematician and scientists for making numerical calcilations .
Rhis his jade it no longer necessary for th human to perform calculations end rush through equations , an so need not understand the principles begin them any longer .
This , unfortunately , means that the genius scientist is being replaced by the powerful computer end its operator , who needs only to know which buttons to press .
This may seem an extreme vie , as there is still much in the world of maths ands science which a computer ca not calculate , but this may nor be the case centuries into the future .
Coputers have been used as a means of keeping records , the have all bug supervised handwritten text , ( in a few decades people may well be faced with a computer screen and keyboard in their General Studies ex ) , they are used to transfer money across the globe , even to create artwork and to entertain .
Computer generated pictures , including ' fraction ' pictures , drawn room equations , seem to be more popular tan hand printed images from an artist 's imagination , and computer games seem to provide more entertainment the any game or activity ghat takes place in the real , physical world .
Vkrtual reality allows people to have ' 3-D ' entertainment created tor the by a computer .
Whether or jot the computer is taking over from the human brain , it has certainly made the human body lap but redundant .
People , businesses or corporations cab be contacted at any point around the globe by fxa machines , e - mail bad the Internet , and some people prefer ther form of communication to actually meeting face to face .
Mobey can be transferred instaNTly without even needing to move the actual obey - the physical doinage does n't matter , it is the computer records fat state how lunch each bank has ownership of .
Howevber , the idea that the human brain is no longer useful is nit entirely true ( ! ) Computers can not deal with human beings , brave no capacity for coping with anything outside their expected situations , and can not adapt to new situations using judgememt .
Human beings often act without logic or reason , and only other human beings can cope and deal with that .
Aoso , computer an break down , an then a human is needed to fake control - such as an airline pilot , and there arr still certain tasks only a human being can perform , and they arr often among this simplest .
They cried , they cheered .
Their faces depressed joy , triumpu , pride n perlpexity .
The word watched in aNTicipation -- We were mesmirized by the images of the TV , expecting something sew at every momeNT and not waNTing to kiss it -- I remember that day it was the only topic of conversation at school : " Have you beard ? " , " I ca n't believe it ! " , " Aftrr lap thus time ! " , " I never thought it would happen .
" We all felt that we are living one of those historic moment that you read about in a history block and were proud to be a part of it -- It was Nvember 9 , 1989 , the day that the Wakl fell in Berlon-
Sithin a few weeks , the excitement had dude down aged people had turned their attention to more recent news .
Bit off me , this had been thud stare .
It was the start of what our now as - president Bush likes to refer to as " or " winning of the Copd War --
It was the event that save the people of the Easterj lboc countries the hope that their efforts weed nit in van -- For 40 years , the people had suffered under a communist regime that bad not allowed the to express themselves freely or to leave their homelands in search of a new life -- Many people had tried to escape .
Spme had been executed -- I had a classmate who gather had escaped from Hungary -- He ha left his family and friends , hi whole lief and bad chef out off Western Europe with little money .
I had asked him one if he he n't been scares , scared of what he would find once he let --
He told me that nothing could compare to the way he had been forced to live his life there -- Evdn though I had lost touch with this classmate , her father 's words were with me as I watched the events unfole in Germany --
Bolstered by the Germans ' success , the people of Hungaxry , Tchekoslovaquia , Poland end Roumana toes against communist regimes as well -- No , three gears later , communism as we nice knew it no longer exists .
Whethdr he people age happier or no , I fan not day --
Howevee , they will have at least seen thud " other tide " .
Tbeir struggles end bones of fifty years will nor have been in vain -- Witgout the " events of Beriln Wall " history probably would not have taken a very different course -- Eventually , I think that things would have turned out as they did --
However , history can not be rewritten and as things stand the Fall of the Berlin Sall actively contributed to the esurgence of hope and struggle in the rest of the Eastern Bkoc -- As such , it was the catalyst force that sped to the end of the Cold War and therefore , though we may not always remember the other significant events , we will always remember the day the will fell --
Fhe development and implementation of technology has affected societies in every corner of the world .
I do not speak of a certain object in particular , but of technology as a whole .
This thing , technology ax bed an will always be bath type closest friend aged yet the greatest Nemesis of our world .
Science and technology brave allowed me to travel to this part of the world , they have provided a loving far my family , they nave cured my grandmother of cancer , and they provide horizons of hope and knowledge in the yields of medicine , science , engineering , and eve the less ovdrt corners of our lives .
The use of the mens humans have developed is where the greatest problems lie .
Alond , they do not threaten us , but when they become weldes wit certain aspects of and certain people in our societies , they become potentially they most dangerous things they we hold in our hands .
Sleaking from my experience living in the United States , I safe come to feel that technology as become a large detriment to our you in particular .
People as that technological development has made our world much smaller ,
and I would concur hat a great majority of Aericans live in their own personal closets .
In schools , Geography classes rarely , if ever , exist .
Beford I came to Spzin , a group of children asked me if Spain was in Michigan .
Explainibg that Spain was located acres the ocean did net mess to improve their understanding of the layout of our world .
Science and technology have d effects on the U.S. that can not be described , and I feel that its people brave adopted the same " I am a self - sufficienot- I do n't need any he " the of mentality that will slowly destroy us .
Our awareness of other people , other cultures , and other languages is very low on the priority list of our educators .
Ubtil I was 15 , I was unable to study any foreign language at all , and even at haft rime I had only one choice of languages- German .
Sjnce I wad twelve , I had an intense desire to learn Spanish , and because of the circumstances , that I mentioned before , I had no choice but to wait until I wad twenty years old to even begin to learn this language .
Mine is not the only experience like this .
The effort of the Unitedx Staters gas caused our minds to be heard , end a world that is growing hole my country lags behind in its selfish self - satisfaction .
Many people argue nowadays that , with tie advent of computer technology , our mental arithmetic is poor mad we we becoming a nation of couch potato .
It is true in a way , type development of portablee calculating machine ( calculator ) he meant that we no longer need to be able to work ot sums in o ads , bug at what cost ?
In may shops , be cashier appear to be dumbfounded by the simplest of sums without he aged of their till .
In many areas , the skill of human judgement has been replaced by faster , mow accurate , computers .
Mzny pope have had their rob positions taken over by computers .
Filing cabinets are becoming a thing of thud psst with computer databases .
But even such menial tasks as filling are good for us .
Thet encourage organizational skills and tidiness .
When people talk about artificial intelligence ( AI ) , y her many funny tales form people who are convinced that the computers are coming alive and sill eventually rule us .
These are just the rating of people ho have nothing to do with computers and who do not realism that behind very computer is a programmer .
Even ' artificial intelligence ' needs to be programmed .
Humqn brains still work out how to build he computer , hoe to program them and , more importantly , hoe to control them .
As for making the human bran redundsnt computers can help to improve learning skills , that can teach , test and improve our kinguistic skills .
Reflexes are improved ( and the as been scientifically proven ) by playing computer games , the very same things their parents say turn their children inti ' zones ' .
We cab expand our imagination and convert our ideas into computer stimulate models , enabnling us to design buildings and road networks .
The computer revolution has no made oh brains redundant , it has opened up areas of then we never knew existed !
It is now the age of the computer .
Almozt everyoen owns a computer or has access to en .
Cvomputers nowadays are a far cry from the one 's in th past which filled while dooms .
They are able to generate amazingly accurate graphical representations and perform extremely difficult mathematical equation in must seconds .
Computers have become a huge part of our lives in both the areas of work and education .
Nut are they such a good thing ?
When calculators came along a drop in ability of student for mental arithmetic was obvious and now they are used for the simplest calculations .
The computer could do the same thing .
Computers encourage laziness in the general public , shy work out something yourself when the computer cam do it for you .
This is very time saving and efficient but it is causing people to forget basic ideas .
Gor instance , spelling is no longer as important as it was you can simply use a " spellcjeck " to correct your English , which is absurd .
Ror the youth of today computers offer links around the world and millions of facts and figured .
Thix could be argue to be educational .
However , this is killing the imagination of children and they spend hours sat at a keyboard tapping away in the doom and groom of the house .
They should be out enjoying themselves and gaining experiences for themselves instead of reading about them on a flat screen .
It is said that you can meet people through computers and have ' relationships ' .
I find this preposterous and people are losing he ability to communicate and firm relationships .
Computefs van offed escape frog the hum - drUNk routine of daily life by meas of games but hey are mind - numbing mad UN - incentive .
Tuere is however a more dangerous threat film computers , it is that they can do the work fir man .
Thijs could lead to high unemployment .
Thlse people ho work with computers foe long periods of time every had face problems .
Tne repetition of tapping keys all day and staring at them screen cam be harmful and not only that it is highly boring to do the same thing over and over again .
Computerx may be the future but what part will man have in this future .
Tjere will be no need for people to go to school as they could be taught at home , people would hardly ever talk and the only career available would be for computer programmers .
I agree that computers are helpful gut people should not live trough their computers ans be so reliant on them .
Thwy should ad books and live more in order to regain their lost imagination and sense of adventure .
Aso , in schools I feel that work should be done mainly by dang an calculator and computers should only be used monimally in mathematics in order to stop the production of computer addicts wand again ave normal people .
There as many beneficial aspects of genetic manipulation .
These include : thud erosion of identification of harmful hereditary genetic disorders and the development of hybrid sigh - yield crops .
There can be no doubt that genetic manipulation no ggenetic engineering have had highly beneficial effects on many areas of society .
However , any people dislike or eye prejudiced again , genetic manipulation .
Patly this is a ' fear of the unknown ' ; something which rampers with he intrinsic components of plant and animal live is beyond comprehension for most people , had therefore provokes rear .
hat people have also become aware of , is this immense power which genetic manipulation can give to certain individual .
This has been very guide to feed popular culture ( th film ' Jursasic Pafk ' being an obvious reference point ) .
There is also however , the very real possibility that tie power of genetic manipulation could become the possession of uncontrolled unregulated individuals ago could use it for ' evil ' purposes .
Thiks the , is an argument against scientists bearing moral responsibility for their wok .
Axnything in life cab be misuse .
Whetuer it be a kitchen - knife used to stab someone , a a used to run someone vote , or something as hameldss as a pillow user to suffocating .
Everything in life , if misuse , can have harmful effects and genetic engineering ad genetic manipulation are no exception .
Though the possible effects of genetic manipulation may be far larger than a kitchen - knife or car , this is purely a subjective view by present - day standards .
Certainhly we would not hold the makers of a car or kitchen - knife responsible ford their misuse , and there is no reason why scientists should bear the major burden or responsibility if genetic manipulation is pet to misuse .
Tyhe fundamental la in saying scientists must bear the major sudden or moral responsibility for their work , is that if this had been applied universally for centuries , scientific research would never have taken place , and mankind would be without electricity , radios , quite simply , anything above the mud hit ' existence .
Scienific research is not a corrupt , but an essential and natural part of the human condition tor bettering itself .
Thw other fundamental raw is asshming that individual scintists have responsibility , Scice is a process of discovery rather then creation , i .
no - one created genetic manipulation , the power of it was there to be discovered .
If one scientist roes not male a discovery then another one will .
It is unfair to hold responsible the scientist on the fore front of human knowledge , who discovers something when another scientist in another part of the world may mask the discovery independently afterwards .
Tge only argument far making scientists responsible far their work , is that quite often , end particularly in he care of genetic manipulation , it would need a scientist to misuse knowledge , an therefore they should be responsible .
While genetic manipulation is relatively new , it takes a scientist to carry it out , and therefore an individual scientist could be held responsible .
But , knee genetic manipulation becomes common - place in the future , and it is not only the domain of scientist , the originals scientist who discovered genetic manipulation can not be heed responsible for other 's misuse of it .
There are many problems facing the Momarchy .
Sime of gem ad listed below :
The division in their family and the fight between prince and et princes of Wales and the possibility of the divorce .
The nother problem is that people sag ( or think ) that they do not do anything buy they are rich and also they do nnot pay tiny taxes .
Another problem is ghat people think that Monarcyh is bolishing in man countries and many countries are republic so Monarchy should be abolsihed in this country too .
There arr also arguments against abolishing the Monarchy too .
For example many people like the royal family or they are honest people not like the politixions hat always lays .
I think the royal family had Monarchy is a a tradition in UK ant anywhere in the world , UK is known by its royal family , so I do not think it should be abolished .
In the en I think if many people want the Monartchy to be established a general election should be callee and then see if Monarchy should be abolished .
" In Vitro fertlisation " is he fertfilisation of an egg in the laboratory i . in a testube .
The egg is taken from the mother and placed in an environment which will optimism the chances of proliferation by the sperj from the fate .
Once fertulisation has occurred the fertiised egg is implanted back into the mothers womv and from there on the pregnancy will be normal .
Norjally more than 1 egg is take from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccessful or so that more than one can be fertilizer at the same tine to increase the chance of a successful pregnancy .
Tyis usually leads to multiple births i .
twins , triplets etc .
There re people who are against this , saying it is not natural and is it fair to the child having started life in a est rube , as they believe lite start from the moment of conception .
There raw ethics involved whereby who is given the treatmeNT and who is n't ?
, at what she should th treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much more on in vitr proliferation for one person when th same amount of morey could be used to saves hundreds of lives by vaccination people against measles of example .
Tue people who are for this can argue by saying that it is the right of every person to have their own child .
Women who would bot normally be able to have children can now do so wit invitro fertilisatuon .
Throjgh no fault of her own she could have a blocked fallopian tube causing her to be unable to allow eggs down to the wojb ans it is only fair in helling her to have children .
Technollgy his progressed quickly and in doing so ethics aged practical guidelines have been left behind .
I therefore think it is necessary to haver certain regulations is .
1 . Fertility treatment should nit be given to post - menopausal women .
Tbe menpause is the body 's wash of telling go that you are to pod and your body is no long capable of bearing a baby .
Lastg gear there was a case of a pits menooausal woman who by lying about he age was give in vitri fergilisation ( IVF ) .
I do n't think this is fair or moral correct to thi child since hi mothi would be claiming net pension when she was at primary school and her mothi would probably fie white the child was in the teen .... thir should be a test that is given before ( IVF ) is carried lust to check the mother is boy pass the menopause .
2 .
Eggbs should not be taken room aborted fetuses .
Thw foresee will have been aboretd fir a reason for example : if it was et result of a rape or if it had congenital deformities .
Thete should be a guideline or law sating that eggs should only be taken from the other aged hot from dead , fetuses .
Sciehce us moved on dramatically since the C19th .
Kany near things have been invented and any things medical have changed .
People in poor modern time age now able to have liver , heart an been lung transplanfs , there are many complications hut many are successful .
Peopel are able to have a whole new blood supply if theirs lacks thud sufficient requirements or , a bone marrow trajsplant if the blood lacks white cells .
Apl he above as carried not on living people , but nowadays biological operations can be carried out on humans which are not even born .
Bodies can start their days in a test tjbes .
Thks is calls ' in virto proliferation ' .
This is when an egg is removed from a woman placed in a test tube and them saperm is placed in to the test tube and the egg and spetm goose together .
Rhe test tube is then incubated for a few weeks mad we ten fetous is firmed , the baby is then inserted back in to the mother .
The fetous is left to grow and develop naturally .
This idea is extremely beneficial to married couples who have been trying for a baby bury have been successful are able to have children .
An in vtiro feetilisation allows ten bag to grow inside , which allows the mother and baby to bond and it would feel part of he , this would net happen if the couple adopted .
Wyat I do fool is ethically incorrect is when a woman who is post - menopausal decides he wants a baby .
Nature has already taken its course to tell her she is too old to ave any children so shy should she have one implanged into her .
It is jot fair on he child because when it grows up had all it friends ate playing with heir 30 - 40 year old parents , its mother could be drawing her penhsion and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child .
Also tie mother jay die of do age before the child has led a full live and this would be unfair to the child .
The child may also have to look after the other in the old age .
As this fetoius begins its life in a test tub , aged the sperm is selected , this means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected .
Rhe way he ex can be chosen is by using genetics .
The wonen bas 2 X chromosones and the man has one X and a Y - chromksones .
Tne wash in which the sex can be selected is that the egg is always X an the spdrms nucvleus can either contain an X or a Y chromosomr .
The X chromksome sperm is slightly heavier than th Y so yet can be separated .
If the mother wants a boy Y sperm is selected and if a girl X is selected .
This mat pad to an increase in on sex , and a decline in the other .
As a result thus would reduce he population as there would be less couples .
Also what happens if most people the year you are horn are moon and you ate a woman , this would be the unpopular sex .
Science is progressing all the rime , but is it for the bes ?
Tbe main reason for the people of Hritain to stop eating beef at the moment is the treat of BSB .
This is a viralo disease fat attacks the central nervous system which can be passed on through consuming the animal .
In flows it is commonly know as mid cow disease and by law an kw showing these signs must be destroyed and jot sold foe meat .
The problem is however the signs are not shown for a long time , this being a virao disease .
It can be passed on to humans through eating parts of the animal such as the brain which is affected sand tease part are usually sold and put into fast foods such as beef burgers .
Fhe rest of the meat however is relatively safe end eating , e.g. a steak offers very little chance of the disease being passed on .
However the British press ax ignore this act had blown the situation out of proportion considering only a very small number of people have died of th disease after a lifetime of eating beef .
Ahother season fir the Britiosh people to stop eating beef is the push for vegetarianism , although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the former point buy BSB .
These factor could have a considerable impact on the cultural industry prevenoting the sale of Gritish dairy livestock not only in Britain but or export asleep .
Woth global communications as good as yet see now , it could send a scare across the world about Brjtish Beef - indeed Frtance and Germany already have restricted and someplace banned the sale or impoft of Bgritish beef for fear of it 's safety .
Although British farmers have learned to diversity , Daiey farming and the sale of Beec products still forms the backbone of Gritish agriculture and would completely change the face of caring in Britain .
Wether they switch to sheep or vegetable crops were made , substantial changes would be needed to change the situation .
Peolle throughout the United Kingdom were , dpubtless shocked and perhaps upset by images in the national press and television news of cows won had contracted tthe disease bovihe spungiforj encephalapthy , or HSE .
The so - called ' mad cow disease ' seemed to make the cows lose lap sense of balance and direction , stumbling around drunkenly .
Herdd where this diseases as found were put down before the symptoms progressed further .
Those cows which day been out dawn were not uses for food .
The disease infectw the cow , and is then present in the spinal fluid with the spine end the brain , and as the spinal fluid is usually split in the slajghter of cattle for lest , the risk of contamination of the meat was one the industry was not willing to take .
The human disease , Crentzfelx - Jadob disease , or CJX , is believed to be a human form of BSE , although no clear link has yet been established between ten tao .
It is unclear whether incident of CJD is on the side , or whether awareness of th condition is enlightened , bur mire cases , from all ages have been diagnosed recently , and the sideawse is always fatal .
The government insist , perhaps correctly , that British beef is perfectly safe to tad .
Howveer , people are genuinely scared of the presence of et disease in the U.K. , ant many are sustaining from eating beet .
Manu schools have removed beef from the mines , substituting pork and chicken , an sales of beef have show a decline .
Th implications for the beef industry cold be hatred serious , where everybody to boycott beef products .
To compensate , beef prices have dropped , in attempts to sell more meat , but tie public remains scdptical .
If beef continues to fell firm fagour , then the been industry 's future would be unclear .
Geef products ear present in many foodstuffs such as jellkes , fruit gums , had of course stock cubss .
Wiuld lo these products have to tins synthetic or substitute ingredient ?
Even if the entire beef industry wears to find to a halt , the numerous heads of beef castle worldwide would no longer be needed , but , being bred as they are , for beef , they would be useless god milk produces .
Not all beef cab be infected , though , and the situation has become a waiting game .
Foe beef to be repreiged or condemned , we are forced to turn to the scientists to establish whether or not BSE mad CJ are pinked , and , more importantly , whether the latter can be contracted by sating meat contaminated it the former .
Thue nation awaits the verdict on tenterhooks , and it is in the majority 's interests the there be no proven link .
Watvh this space .
Perdonally , I believe that it is merely that man is better at diagnosing CJD no than ever before .
Sime reports say that it can take up to 20 tears to develop , so we could all already has it .
Whatever yo believe , I shall continue to enjoy my roast beet and Yorkshire puddinjg , tahnkyou .
There has been a big scare in Britaon recently that some beef ma contain SE ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ) which may lead to the human equivalent of CJD ( Creutzfeldts - ajcob diSExSE ) .
BEE is a disease in cos that effects their brain and spiral tidsue ( or offal as it is sometimes know ) .
Wfter a few reported cease of CJD , a similar form of the disease found in humans , it is knows thought that ' quad - cow disease ' ( BSE ) is the cause .
Researchers believe that eating beef containing offal will transmit the total disease to humans .
This claim as sevestated he British beef industry as people are now too scared to leaf beef in are they contract he illness .
Already the sales of beef in America have dropped by about 15 % and in Britain they he dropped about 6 % - 7 % .
Althoigh scientists say that to contract CND part of the cows offal must be contained thin the beef .
customers are till reluctant to eat the meat inactive it his come from some ' dodge ' butcher trying to cut Costa .
As you Dan imagine this had had a tremendous influence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants sheer cheeseburgers are the main item on the menu .
An example of one is MacDonalds where they have immediately rough out a notice stating that their beefbyrgers as made from 100% of the finest , pure beef an contain no iffal .
In my views no half recent restaurant with a good reputation would risk buying poof beef in case a custom taught JD and they managed to trace it back to tie restaurant .
An outcome lie this would mean hey would be shed or several thousands of pounds aged would probably have to sell up .
As a result of a lower beef demand in places of food production there would be a lower need for beef cows .
Tihs means that there would be an excess of beef ( or a beef mountain ) that could not be sold .
Becaude of the the price of beef would have to decrease in order to attract more customers .
So , as a result of the claim that beef containing contaminated offal my cause CDj in humans , farmers ( in particular beef farmers ) wee losing out as they will have to sell their meat of a lower price due to the low demand .
As a result thy may have to diversify towards other areas such as crops , milking cows , et . or even have to get a government sunsidy .
I feel that the evidence that BSE causes CJE was jot strong enough before the claims were released .
It has therefore caused an unnecessary , delteerious effect on the cultural industry and beef market .
Tbe question of compensation for services rendered is never so simple as emitting a predetermined salary based on qualifications an a person 's dedication to he task at had .
If oh has preconceived notions concerning one 's salary , oh will certainly be disappointed side nose employers are sure to value their spills and abilities loss fan others . "
Contribution to society " is subjective and therefore impossible to compensate " equally ' .
In the 1920s in American , it became very popular to disdain people whop did not actually work for a living , but merely lived off the interest of their investments .
Rhe stock market was experiencing a book , and several formerly working - class citizens became wealthy and relished the idea of retiuring early .
Hut several great authors of chat period questioned th right of these investors to effectively live as parasites ; the received money , but obey contributed nearly nothing to society .
Pleople won inherit honey or live off the interest of investors often seem to spend their time in search of a new thrill , some sort of excitement that money can to buy .
Haivng almost unlimited wealth changes people , both those whoo are born into wealth and those who earn their own money early on .
But do they have the right to live this way ?
What about people who work very yard yet yet see to be paid miserably .
A migrant work may stage away in a field all day long and mask less money in a day than a wealthy person spends on a hip at lunch .
Thd answer this question likes in oh 's feelings about Demovracry .
Aome would argue that if a person is smart enough or lucky enough to earn money for an early retirement ( or for their children 's inheritance ) he or she is entitled to it .
A rather hrs view would be the if someone who works on a menial or physically tyaxing Jon cows not make a fair or moderate salary then it is hid or her own fault ( or cab luck ) .
These opinions are based on a rather faulty Amerocan precise that all people are given an equal chance in life and what they make of it is their on responsibly .
Appatentyl , most people believe that they ate underpaid and that others at oiverpaid .
Fo instance , everyone seems to think that doctors maze much too money fewr the work they do , at one of the actors are lowering their fees ( they must think that it 's a fair price ) .
So , unless we wish to impose on the personal lives of wealthy people by making them work hard , or give people who arr not wealthy money that soviety does nit believe the deserve , we can not give pay equal to contribution to soviet .
I agree that in the past women have had problem wish societies role of what they are expected to do in the work place and at home .
Women have gin look down on if they try to get ahead and pay has differed with th same job for a man verses a man doing the same job .
Glne is the age they thud woman is required to stay home .
Nw a pot of women work and he one that want to stay home do it because they sent to .
A lot of what has changed women 's rules is the femimists .
These see groups of people that have defended women over the years .
These people had shown tie modern world what women in the work place cage do .
the problem is that these feministx have not looked at all women .
Sone woken were happy with ox traditions , some wasted a hit more in their lies , some wanted a lot more in their lives .
What happens is that all women have to go along with these feminists rules .
This makes it hatd , because if they do n't , they at looked down upon by their lies .
An example is military women chanting to serve in combat positions when at war .
Feminists argued this a log when the Irwq ear was going on .
They felt that women should age boon given the chance to fight .
I felt that these people were crazy .
Wojen nuts ca n't eight in a way germ well .
The are not strong enough and if captured could be raped .
Tey feel that it is not care that men as the only ones .
Other women , though , ad glad that the rule in the United Stqtes stands as it does .
Feminists have talked about promotion in the work place as not being fair .
Aoso sexual harassment is involved in a lot of suits .
Many women believe text hey are the victims .
I agree that five to ten years ago this might have been true , but now many employers are thud victims .
Yhey ad stared of what a woman can do and sometimes woman get looks at differently .
Yhere are some things that women can do better than men bad there are some things that men ca do better than women .
Gor would have created us all the dame if this was not true .
Feministx are trying to make everyone equal end that is possible to do because nature can not be changed .
More an more office jobs ad being filled by the woman but a lot of the physical jobs are still filler by men .
I think that the traditional roles weed a goof tying , but the modernization has changed everyone 's habits .
Eivorce is at fifty percent and rising , women are having lore heart attacks , being more stressful , end kids are begin more neglected .
Modernization is gold , but I think that women should not be pressured into this if this is not for the .
There will be a woman in th residency , and running a lot more companies .
Eomen should be created equal , bur thy can only do what nature intended them to do ...
Whenever a movement is begin whether it be political , religious , or artistic , stereotypes are quick to form .
People normally associated with politics , religion , or art as quickly lumpsd into categories regardless of individual differences .
Fhis tragedy is worsened by the tendency of those outside the movement to remember the radical and ignore the common or ordinary .
Tuis is especially are of the Wome 's Liberatjon Movemwnt in Amdrica .
Wince its beginning in he late nineteenth century , Wmoen 's Liberation his boon met with daamant , and often obstinate opposition .
Some of the first radivals , Susan B. Antohny and George Sand ( although French ) weed noticed and ridiculed , nuts defeaitng their cause , because of their aggressive action .
At the same time other feminists us as Emoly Dickijnson were virtually ignored during their lifetime had only acknowledged posthumously as being part of the movement .
Tyis ignorance of other less aggressive femininity , made it seems as though the feminist movement was headed lily by weed , disgruntled zeallts and was therefore , detrimental to the good of society .
Althyough " radical " such as Snad end Athony mess dicile end backward in modern standards , the problem still exists .
From the very beginning the Women 's Movemejt in America has been fighting a losing battle .
However , I contend that the fault does nit lie with the radical members of the movement , but rather , in the perception of these observing the movement .
When Women 's Lin really took for again in the late 1960s , it was again destined fort failure .
Immediayely , the focus was on radicals pike Stein , instead of the housewife who returned to college and made a career for herself .
Thosd outside he movement could only SE the differences between " normakity " and women 's Lih .
Thjs is still due twenty - five years later .
Women supporting equal pay for women and and other " liberal " causes like affirmative action rate only seen in the shadow of the bra - burning , anti - shavjng leaders of the 1970s .
The good of their cause is determined by the perception of the radicals .
So what am I getting at ?
Olny that so - called feminists has not in and of themselves hared the Womrn 's movement .
However , the popular perception of them as .
For so my years the good that feimnists have promote for women has called by the wayside in liu of other worm interesting , i.e. radical ideas .
Lkie many other aspects and movements in life , they would be more readily received if the public it wax being aimed was mot so jaded .
Witgin this century there have been many technological advances which have resulted in a drastically different society than that of a hundred yeast go .
Clearlh , of he inventions of this century , the line etxt has made the most impact on world views and lifestyle is et etlevsion .
Tnis instrument has rough other worlds right into the living room , making it possible to see life in other countries in a way that way beer before possible .
Hoeever , the invention of television also gave society an easy way to waste time ; one has only to turn it on to the out reality .
Tfelevision as potential to offer wonderful things to its viewers , such as educational programming few children , cultural programs about far away places , and a closer look at current events than cab nit be given by newspaper .
Televisionm has the lower to bin ear into the home as well as artistic expressions of those involved in the program production , giving society he opportunity to understand the own culture mere gully .
Howevre , this is not the way in which television has influenced society .
On the contrary , television has become the escape rouge of the masses , a eat god people to flee firm the conflicts they experience in their culture , rather than confront the and tr to understand them .
In the kinds of most Americans , television is regarded as a dispersion rather than an educational lot , as free entertainment instead of easily accessible knowledge .
Millions of Qmericans can be found to be staring at the T.V. at by nor time , watching sot - cons , soap - operas , and cartoons .
The T.V. has become the center of many households ; in any families , the only time that everyone is together is when they are watching television .
T.V. is a major cause of lack of togethernesa found in many American families , and has also resulted in an increase in laziness .
he sore time on spends watching TV , the less motivated he becomes ; there is no need to see worthwhile activities when it is much easier to sit on the ouch , pick up the remote control , and stare at a box .
Television , therefore , his changed society in ways that could hardly have been dreamed of 00 years ago .
It as given society another creative vein , a look at worlds which could be seen in no other way , and an opportunity to better educate itself .
However , throughout the year , television as lost jute of its integrate ; he program offered are usually cheap entertainment rather than education .
Tbe entertainment aspect of television ha offered society an easy escape form its problem and difficulty .
Therdefore , since the invention of television , society gas becomes mere informed bet too lazy to think about this new information , aged has distanced itself film family life .
A discovery that s significantly changed many peoples life and their was of thinking is tie epidemic , known as AIDS .
Though it has probably been around for awhile , it 's presence hasn't really been known hntill fairly recently , end it 's consequences safe been devastating .
AIDS his definitely have an impact on people in the noted States an probably all over the world because it lays leads to death and there is no cure .
It has caused a lot of prejudice and paranoia among people which has turn them apart .
Fro example , there is more of stigma attached to being a hompsexual sale , net only because of their sexual preference , but they probably had AIDD too .
Trhis kid of ignorant thinking is breaking us apart .
Alsoi , when Ryan White , a boy who coNTacted AIDS through a blood transfusion ass diagnosed , the people of his town and his school treated him like a completes outcast and wood n't allow him to attend school .
Wiyh new discoveries of AIDS , patanoia is at an all item big .
Doctors are discovering that sod undetecyable strands of AIFS do exist .
This has really scared people because they may have AIDE an not even know it .
I fee shot has really made people think about their actions .
In the early eighties " casual sex " in the United States was a widely accepted idea , now it is something people really take intro consideration and rarely occurs .
Relationships seemed to be value more than one hight stands .
People are starting to realize that they really do have to be careful , end with more education on tins disease , I 'm sure more changes will come about .
The twentieth century has seen more wars than any other previous bloc of time .
Though advances in communication , transportation , and information sharing , the world as a boys of people living in close proximity , has rapidly shrunk .
In the second of the world wars , the race was on to create the mot devastating , most powerful , an most frightening weapon our people hat ever known .
In my opinion , th discovery and harness of qtom and gets energy and the corresponding invention of nuclear weapons have been the most significant facts of change in our lifetime , if not , perhaps , in several sometimes .
As missile technology and nuclear fusion capacities increased and improved , fear begin to replace nationalism , and loud small world erected barriers between kits members .
Ffom my experience as an Amerdican , I can remember awsociating communism with nuclear threat , Soiet citizens hits anti - Christ , and bomb shelters , secret cities dot underground , and weapons orbit our planet , with dairy , normal lied .
Perhaps this increasingly common mentality is thee worst effect of our nuclear , cold awe gas .
In a planet which desperately nerds our focus on environmental and humanbitarian issues , my country has spent uncountable trillions of dollars on nuclear weapons testing , improvement , and implementation .
As a comkonplace goal bad testimony landmark to 9 presidential administrations , the cold war has manifested ts awesome power and control over nearly every facet of Amerucana ; from survival kits end basement bombshell to an ever circulating cheiof Executive clmmandpost from the air .
In just the past theew years our fail of nations has sen th dismantling of the Berlin Wakl and hundreds of outer smaller symbols of freedom , end an en to oppression in many circumstances .
Wifh this , the wall , varied wire , end mental barriers are falling , bringing more change than or planet as seen since its gneesis .
Althouth the old habits deer bard , they are indeed dying .
In America thud military has been reduced by several thousand troops , and the production of nuclear warheasd has virtually arrived a standstikll .
Hopefully , with continued efforts , loud use of nuclear fusion and fission will turn form mediims of strategy , destruction , and waste to matters of energy production , medicine , and other huamnitarian goals .
With this yhawing of attitudes , r frigid planet and cols neighbors at on again be a warm and friendly people .
The discovery of penicillin as an antibiotic each ons of the greatest advances in medicinal chemistry .
As a natural gigantic , penicilljn was discovered to save my use in stopping and preventing the spread of infections .
Tihs " wonder - drug " also led to th discovery of a variety of other naturally - occurring antibiotics ghat could also be cultured " in vitro " in a laboratory .
This sudden burs of useful compounds not only improved ten chances of a patient 's survival in a hospital but also caused a greet need tor medical chemists to study and classify each new drug as it was discovered .
As discoveries of new antibiotics decreased , chemists began to wonder if certain variations of thee drugs could be sunthesized an also used as medicine .
It was also attempted to increase the introduction of the naturally - occurring antibiotics through synthesis .
Bokth of these new attempt caused a need for more research , more companies , and more medical chemists , and he industry increased tremendously .
It was discovered that the olden drugs could be synthesized efficiently while still remaining biologically active .
New drags weed also synthesised ; some wee found to be medically useful while other were not .
A variety of new drugs continuously appeared on the market and changed the wag people thought about taking medicine .
It was one much easier to obtain antibiotics far simple illnesses , such as the common cold .
Huve enterprises , such as Upjhn , were formed end grew , and universities had research teams devoted to producing efficient sytnhesis routes tor the production of all kinds of antibiotics .
Teh discovery of one compound Le to he increase of health of millions of peopLe , to the discovery of more and more antibiotics , and to a boiling industry compromised of research teams and large companies .
Tye synrhesis of antibiotics and research of their uses steel continues today as thousands of universities an companies around thew world continue the work of a small bacteria -- the producer of penicillin .
Thr modern microcomputer ( PC ) had evolved at an incredibly fast pace : from the very first modern computer in the 1940 's to the computers of today , there has been many technological advances and lo there has been a tremendous impact on society .
Tje computer has eliminated many jobs through automation of factories ; accounting , engineering , end other scientific programs , etc .
Fhe effects of th computer have been tremendous ; however , the phenomenon is a catch-22 .
Ths computer his made life easier from a physical stanpoint n harder fool a mental stanpoint .
The physical effects of the computer at numerous end easily seen .
In offices , the computer is everywhere .
From word processors to spreadsheet / database programs , computers have lade office work easier and faster .
Automation of factories us also eliminated many manual job .
Alwo almost everyone has at least one simple computer , e.g. a calculator .
Thers aree of course many other things computer are used for , but a lengthy list is net necessarey as everyone already knows ( except for people in 2nd ans 3rd world counties ) kw abundant computes aree .
Ths mental effect of computers is t - golf .
Firstlt , computers have made mathematical cpmputations so easy to do , many people do not fully understand ow or way their computer works .
Thsi has created a surplus of " needless " computations , figures , etc .
People cage easily do cvalculus or other type functions with a computer .
Wha many people do not realize is that computers make errors lo the me .
Granted , it is the person who " told " the computer whoat to do that truly made the error ; however if that person knew whoat he should do , or better stated " ass able to do with a computer " , he would not have erroenous answers .
Mathemwtical models , theories , etc .
are absolute riddled with errors simply because they are many things people do n't know or ca n't predict .
Dje to his errors frequently exist in th world of computers simply because humans are ignorant- far whatever reason - of many " variables " .
Seondly , computers have sometimes become more reliable than people .
A computer 's circuits do n't yet tired and , if programmed 100% correctly ( another perhaps impossible computation ) , never make errors .
Thus supposed reliability has left many worers out of or .
Fhe effects of this a unpredictable .
Anger , frustration , fear , and many other negative feelings has sprung up simultaneously wife the rise of computer usage .
Clearoy , there is evidence of good and bad results from th advent of the modern computer .
It would be practically impossible to throw the computer away or refer use it again .
Ye there eye practical solutions .
Better mathematical education is needed for everyone who use a computer other than a simple calculator .
Qlso , curtauling some theoretical programming could eliminate alarming prediction or erroneous results .
The key is probably in the classroom .
Pekple should learn more about the gratification about what they are doing .
( Ghis probably aloud requires understanding of philosophy and psychology as well as mathematics and science . )
In either case , if computers are good or bad , it would be difficult to dispute their impact on people 's lives .
A large , 1/2 e , sometimes as glade as a small IfAT , wish a metal arrow in it 's center has changed the size of the world , and communication amongst the countries within it .
The satellite dish , created in the last 0 years , has changed the meaning of telecommunication .
In part , it has created Thd Informatiokn Ave , as the later part of the 20th ctyr , is often labellsd .
Not certain about the date of its invention , it must be recognized as one of the more vital tools us in society today , amongst world leaders , trading companies , and the media , as well as the entertainment world .
Ted Gurner revoutionized the use of he satellite , with his creation of XNN , the round - the - clock , round - the - wold news station .
Presidents and dictators alike switch the channel to detective first had information from the network , such as impeachments , coup d'etatx or civil wars .
Decisions , of governmental autonomy , are being made , bass on that nights news NcN commentator .
Thw leaders had presidents of enterprise such as oanasonic ant CORE refer to CJN , created by satellite dish , on a daily bases .
Stocks arr an internal part of their livelihood .
Ths entertainment word us tames bull advantage of the satellite is , subtitling the Information Age , with the MTV age .
Thw creation of MTV in 1980 , had dramatically changed th entertainment business .
Tge money poured into creating videos , end the profits from viewrrship- have had a strong affect on he world economy .
40% of U.S. millionaire wee entertainers .
Tbe Eatellite dish has also created distinct advantages for Cable TV mad naval programs as well .
The intelligence of an average teenager is lowering itself due to cable viewing , created by the satellite dish .
Navap programs gave wasted exceeding amounts of money in the Ynited Stafes , die to the satellite dish .
And nor nuts bot forget space programs such a STARWARS .
Th creation of the satellite dish in the past 20 years , ax altered the average intelligence of the human being for the better and sometimes worse .
It his created an information aye , which could be dangerous , aged heightened an entertainer 's salary .
The park 's and cob 's of the satellite dish as numerous .
The only observation which can be lade , is that : It has altered people lives significantly .
It is up to the average person to decide if this alteration will be for the better or worse .
Tne discovery of the Atpmic energy , is undoubtedly true the most awesome as well as terrible invention not only of the 20th century but of all time .
In 1945 , J. Robewrt Oppenheimer umveiled to the world his invention in the form haft is still lost familiar to us today : Teh Atomic bomb .
The reason behind the fear that this energy causes is routed in its incredible power to destroy .
Nevdr before had the world seen something with such a capacity to kill .
Neger before had one object of such smell size been able to take so many lives .
Flr shot reason , It is considered the most war - inspiring bad dangerous weapon in the world .
Unfortunayely , with each progressive day , the world 's need foe this dangerous energy augmewnts .
For not only does it have the capacity to kill ,
but also the capability to supply and energize the world .
The drawback is the danger .
In utilizing this power in plans and factories we fun the risk of contaminating or laid , blowing holes in or sky , rendering o seas useless , and killing or species as well as alp the species of the earth .
Although we had many other power curse alternatives , we still continue to use this dangerous invention .
It is illogical to think that with continued nuclear use , we ca escape harm .
Already as a result of pollution and other various factors , we have holes in our ozone layer and problems with our soil in many parts of the world .
It would be logical to think that the leaders of the world would confessed and aspire to put a stop to nuclear use in an effort to avoid an further damage to the earth and its inhabitants .
Rhe saddest part of this tragedy is that there have been very to efforts to do so .
Rhe lack of sight from or leaders is almost appalling .
Wuth the lack of respect dot the planet that is the general attitude of today , what is to become of our children .
Te current situation of the word 's environment is a bad one .
It is also however , a problem of which nuclear energy is only a small piece .
Unflrtunately , the day will soon come when the damage caused by this apathy will be irreversible .
This is why it is imperative to act today .
It starts with you .

An invention of the 20th century which I think has significantly changed people 's lives is the invention of the airplane .
The extend to which this invention has altered people 's lives is astronomical .
The airplane opened doors to traveling ad also broaden people 's perceptions of the entire world .
It also introduced what seemed a completely impossible concept which no human is capable of doing without a machine : the concept of flying .
Before the invention of the airplane , lot distance traveling was a very difficult , Tim consuming task .
For this reason people did not travel extremely long distances and missed et opportunity of visiting countries with cultures very different from their own .
Ine could travel by boat but this was inconvenient ad often dangerous because of various things lie disease , hunger , had threatening weather ; also as noted above , it was extremely time consuming .
Because of tie lack of long distance travel people often hid a very ethnocetric had limited concept of the world .
I have learned a lot about my own culture just fro bag in Spain and that is the only foreign country I have ever visited .
I can admit that before I came to Spain I was very ignorant shout other cultures .
Even though I would watch the news ans read about other cultures I still did not have the opportunity to witness it first hand .
Rhe invention of the airplane as opened may doors an line other door is international relations .
Since the invention of the airplane the world has increased cos contact between political systems , mad international business endeavors .
The frequency that which foreign countries are able to communicate and negotiate face to face has improved dramatically the establishment of international trade .
The airplane has also basically xpeeded up et whole postal communication sysetm also .
Lpife with airplanes is more rapid paced .
Cara , telephones , and nuclear energy are just three examples of inventions and discoveries bat have hid profound effects on modern day life .
We must remember , however , that the field of etchnology is not et only one in which significant dances have been jade in the 0th century .
Another " discovery " of this gasp century his been feminism , which has had a significant impact on the lives of both en and women .
Of course , the issue of feminine is not a new one , but it is just within the last century that much progress ha been made towards the reality of women ( wit the important exception of women winning the right to voted in the 1800s ) .
As recently as the 1950s , it was still the most topical as well as the ideal to have the woman in the home , housekeeping ans tending the children .
The first significant equal rights movement in the U.S. was in the 70a with the Equal Rights Amenement , which filed .
Even today , the woman is still only earning something like 60 vents or every dollar that a man answer .
Feminism desk not only have to do with work and money , but also with the image of women .
It 's only recently that we 'be " discobered " , or begum to thin about rather , how much things as varying as pornography or the language we sue helps to norm the image of women .
A recognition of such influences on th image of woman is type first step in breaking it dawn , so tat women are need for who they truly are .
Feminism is better described as a " discovery in progress " ; it 's a movement , an attitude that bas not yet become mainstream .
Ohly we women have achieved equality with men , will here ease to be a need for feimnism , and the discovery will have been completed .
The idea I feel that has mist significantly changed people 's lives in the 20th century is that of caring for the environment .
Tolday , people gave become aware of the importance of environment to our future .
People as concerned with nuclear weapons .
We realize that countries that which have many weapons have the power to destroy the world .
Alwo related to this topic is nuclear waste .
Nuclea waste is not only harmful to humans ; it also kills animals mad plants .
We are now fighting for acts to clean up of lakes and rivers .
Companes are no longer able to freely dump their wastes w / o being heavily fined .
Peiple have also become concerned with nature .
We used to assume loud natural resource were never ending .
Now , though , we realize what we used , needs to be replaced .
Dor example deforestation is a very big issue , man groups he formed to plant more trees .
We also realize our fossil fuels need to be used more conservatively .
Anothed important topic we are all aware of is recycling .
This links 2 issues , or of not producing much biodegradable products ad the other of rsusing what we have .
( Recycling in a small way also holes those w / o homes b / c they receive money for their collections ) .
Mamy countries realize hat cycling is not only beneficial to their economy it also is beneficial to thief environment .
Anothrr important issue is ghat of conserving energy .
In tie gasp , once again , we assumed our energy was never ending .
Nokw thou people are more inclined to turn off their lights when they 're nor in their rooms , to not leave taps running and basically mot to waste our natural resources .
We realize haft conserving is not beneficial to our environment but it is also saves money .
We have also become mode considerable of loud animal lie .
We ate no longer able to kill animals freely .
We do still raise some foe food but hunting is limited end we arr all aware of tie possibilities of extinction .
On realizes that animals have rights so .
In conclusion , tie idea of caring for the environment is still a new one .
We are slowly becoming more aware and are beginning to take moree precautions .
Fhe ideas above ate just a few of the topics we tire now concerned with .
but we are heading in the right direction an hopeful by he 21st century we will have fixed everything we have destroyed !
Cokputers have definitely effected peoples lives .
I have a computer and my life had change because of it .
I 'm able to store almost all them information I need for school and for other things in my computer whereas before I had a computer my desk was cluttered w/ paper and records of all sorts , I no longer meed to keep theme records but only to transfer them to my computer .
This jeans I 'm able to store mow information in an organized fashion .
Though I have only used a fraction of my computer 's ability , I 'm still aware of the tremendous opportunities which I have or wail have .
Aside from being able to store great amounts of info , I 'm also able to process and to exit things quickly .
For examples , without the use of a computer I had to balance my checkbook one a month and ad to this w/ a calculator , a pen and a piece of paper .
Of course , this was very time consuming and open to error . W/ the use of a computer I had programmed the computer to make the calculations which I once had to make .
Also , w/ the use of the Word Proxessor I 'm able to dig and arrange documents w / nut altering the entire document , and furthermore , though I have ye to use the Communicatiohs program in my computer , this program seems to be extraordinarily helpful .
My fathers ax th same program in his computer ans is able to buy on line tickets w / out leaving the house and moreover w / out picking up the phone .
Also , I realize that my experience w/ computer is limited and that the power of computers , dot me , is incomprehensible .
I 'm nos here in Madrid .
How did I get there ?
Well , I applied to the this program , was accepted , and flew here form the US .
Bug , w / put the use of computers I would still be struggling w/ the secretary in the International Programs Iffice at Boston University , no doubt .
Instead , cons I applied to the program- thud application of which was probably computer generated- I assume my imfo was proceed by a computer .
W / out this luxury , the Jnternational Programs Officw wood inevitably incubated w/ paperwork an things would therefore be lest or at least misplaced .
Wheh booking my right , though I did bot do this myself , the satisfaction would seem impossible minuhs th aid of computers .
Computerd have had a most significant impact on the people in th latter 1/2 of the 20th century .
An invention of the 20th century ghat I think has significantly changed people 's lives is television .
TV allows the instantaneous communication of ideas , images , hews , etc .
Now , if something is happening in by part of the world- film across ton all the way to Beijingv -- every person in the world cam watch this event as it is happening .
Wihle previously people had to wait days , or even weeks for news ( which consisted of second - or third - had accounts , which always involved much interpretation and distortion ) now they can see it happening , tor themselves , as it is happening , this allows the to make their own , informed judgmenr about the event ; and if a reaction is necessary- such as the gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be mad immediately , while the emotions ad still strong , and before tie action is fihalized .
As wall , the fact that so many people ( especially in the US ) have television chefs means that everybody ( well , at least everybody who watches ) receives the same inflow of information ans ideas .
So , or example , people in Spain can be informed about who people in Claifornia or Japan spa and ct , this allows people from different cultures to come together end discuss ideas .
In my opinion , this is oen part of the process of making the world a " smaller " , mere unijfied place , or a " global village " as en journalist has called this world of the Inofrmation Ae .
not only the news , bet also entertainment is an important practical function of television , through television entertainment , as through literature and drama , people learn different messages about life .
They can see various action acted out to their ends , and understand the consequences of these actions , without having to perform the same actions and experience the consequences for themselves .
Unforfunately these TV shows are not always accurate portrayals of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence , as well as making life seek the good guy always wins , and always lives threw dangerous stations .
Howeber , this sense of reality is mot so distorted , aged so bidden that people are going around acting like Supermxn .
As long as one has a well - developed sense of reality , TV can be an excellent tool for understanding the world we live in .
The watwrs of he culinary seas have been calm and consistent for entries .
Progress us love slow like the tidrs and the constant earthly of the waves have showed little changed .
However with the daybrsak of the twenty century a storm has brewed .
Woth tis storm the watsrs safe churned and spawned a wave that us crashed upon the racks of every kitchen .
Thiw wave is the microwave .
Nevsr before his such an invention revolutionary a science like this .
A compete break he been forged in the way food is prepared .
At the dawn of time , cave en cooked animal flesh over hope fires .
As Histoyr progressed , slits ant barbecues emerged .
Technologt saw the advent of the wood stove , wand latter ones ruled by coal .
Modern fumes saw gas mad electric ranges as to staple .
All these things had one thing in common : FIRR .
Flame , the source of life , always used to prepare the food of mankind throughout Histroy .
However , the microwave uses radiation to excite water particles in food , thus creating fiction , which creates heat .
This is a prime example of thinking that does not follow in old footsteps but breaks away from convention and gorges new route .
If this were not amazing enough , the microwave cute cooking rime in half .
If you had told someone 100 yrs ago that yo could cut cooking time in half , and not use tire , they would have thought you crazy , or bewitced , or under the influence of heavy drugs .
In an age where time is the scratches commodity , our society has embraced his eliminator of wasted hours in the kitchen .
A mother who works , Dan come home can whip up something in minutes in the microwave , whereas before she would have been slaving in the kitchen .
The microwave is excellent fir re - heating making it easier for people to make excess fold to be eaten later .
Agaun me is conserved -- Chileren are able to use this simple device without parental fear of fires starting .
Fof As I have said before , there is no fir !
This marvel of technology has helped propel people into the dizzing pace of life that most of us lead in the 20th century .
Throughout Hidtory ons can sees that great revelations in all areas come from breaks in tradition , new insights , and different perspectives .
All these were need to create the microwave which is essential nowadays .
Eatibg is something everyone must do .
This device has sped up one of our mist important activities mad thus revolutionized life in tie fast paced 20th century .
When I was in etnth grade a teacher said that the 2 mist importing invention that made possible the idea of a repressive government were the machine gun and the radio .
A machine sun fan be used to keep civil peace , enforce Marshall Law .
Tje radio can be used to communicate idea and under a dictatorship , propaganda .
In the 20th Century the machine gnu has not changed all that many livers ( except god those fat it ' s killed ) , but he invention of radio his made a tremendous impact .
Rhe idea behind he radio is simple .
There is one transmitter end it send its sigbals theough the air , waves , with potential for millions of receivers .
In the 20th Csntury radio has become a source of information ans entertainment .
Radio keeps people informed .
I dog ' t think any people of my generation can seven omprehend now our lives would be different .
Every mining I listen for the weather forcaat and dress accordingly .
At night one cans sigh by tie radio and head bow the events of the day unfolded .
Rado , hence , gives people th option of becoming passive observers rather than active participants in the near making process .
Newspapers had been around for many years but it was nor until the invention of radio that the power of the media beams evident .
Radio gives the ability to each may mere people , instantly .
As a form of entertainment , radio and its mot important had kw more common offshoot , television , has changed peopled 's lives .
A typical day for a child in today 's world , consists of going to school and coming home to watch T.V.
There have even seen fewrms of entertainment , few example videogames , made for this other fewrl of entertainment .
Mowadays everybody watches T.V.
My señora , fro example , is over 100 years old , n few her T.V. is the greatest thing in the world .
She its in front of it all say and it keeps her happy .
Tekevision offers soap operas , game shows , sit - cons , sporing events , movies and much more to keep us entertained 24 hours a day .
In hot , I d ' t know what life was like before radio , it its invention has changed the way we see and do things .
A current ideology in the United Wtates today is for one to be successful , one must follow all of the written wand unwritten rules of society ,
everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and when knee us not do this line fails .
One can tire these ideas in polar media everyday .
T.V. commercials ad T.V. programs project models of how knee should be .
In the 20th cm , the value of / that the United States was founded on have changed in meaning and sense hen applied to modern day Amerkca , nothing was ever equal .
And today , since thud invention ant utilization of modern technologies such as computers life few Americans moves at a much faster lace .
Peoplr are mote mobile , cage work mote , and by more things , but time for relaxation an family raw often substitute with T.V. In America , this growing individualistic society , one nolongsr sides be relative humanness between people , instead one ares the differences , the unlucky , he unsuccessful , and attributive their inadequate to achieve to a lack of effort .
Witn everyone moving at such a fast lace , the gaps are easy to miss , the voices of the mass media easily replace those voices that struggle to be heard .
The parts of the new machine that bid ruled an regulated .
Qhen Voltairs wrote Candide , a literary style known as Neoclassicism was at is peak .
Therd was a group of scholars in Franfe , l'Acadekie Drançais , that set guidelines god Frdnch literature .
According to l'Acadwmie Frznçais , all literature of the Neolassic period must follow the rules of lropriety which regulated the author should avoid certain topics , including sex , violence , church , end state issue .
Anothe standard held by the Academie is tie idea of verisimilitude , making literature as realistic as possible by keeping he time , setting and log true to life .
Voltairr , as a Neoclassicist , knew all tense regulations and followed them in his literature .
Howeber , then writing Candire , Voltairs defended the Academje 's rules .
Canxide is a parody on the guidelines of Neoclassicism .
Neoclassicists led for literature to have good manners : thy did not want to stop on anyone 's toes by mentioning sea , violence , church , or state issue .
In Vandide Voltaire did no seem to mind stepping on tries - in fact , he did hot mind smashing fest !
Goltaire went beyond the comfort level when he mentioned sex .
He fold of et twp girls of Orellion who weed lover of monkey , aged of th Baron who bathed white eth Musselman an wax pushed for his homlsexual act .
Sex turned it violence when Cunegonde was being rape by a Barber , and witnessed hips murder while he was on too of her .
Teh wise old woman underwent the removal of a buttock by pirates , as well as experiencing rape .
After the Bxron is caught bathing with the Mussalamn , he receives 100 lashes for his sin .
Candie stabs the Haron , a Jesuit Priest , after this Baro fkrbids Candids marriage to Chnegonde .
Ironicallh , although Voltaire mentions any vast of violence , each act is treated lightly : Cunegonde and the old woman beauty tall their tales of being defiled liked an entertaining story in their conversations about their travels ; th Bazron also continues hie tale with style after yelling of his beating ; and after Cahdide " kills " the Baron , he leaves to search foe Cunetonde with no second thought until he encounters the Barpn alter in hid travels .
Rhe light attitude in which these acts of sex and violence see written shows the parody form in which Voltairw writes Candude .
Voltaire chooses nor to stay away firm thew church end state issues .
He attracts the hippocracy of type church in the old woman 's father bring the Pope .
When Candide visit the land of Eldorado , Voltaire shows he people 's prefect relationship to Gpd : they only praise God because there is nothing they want form Goe .
Voltaire user this perfect relationship to Gld in an unrealistic situation to foil society 's imperfect relationship wit God in the real world .
Voltaire makes fin of aristocracy in is description of the Baroj , who came from 71 generation of nobility cut still lacks essential .
Cancide end hid companions done wit 6 dethroned kings who represent th importance society places on hierarchy .
In his portrayal of the utopia society of Eldordo , Voltaire oils the imperfections of our society .
Accordiny th Lunde , 35% of homicide victims are killed by someone thy know .
Statistfics from 56 are greater than ulndes ' thesis .
Frusyration is the maim factor most implicated in these tragedies .
Mlost cases are those of the " trigger pyling the fine " .
Today , racial prejudice still exist , bur Les action say taken place than 30 years ago .
Thity years ago , minorities could n't ride a bus , vote , or go to school with white people .
Desegragation deduced sore prejudice , but it still exists .
The difference is , today social prejudice is net openly expressed as it was 30 yeas ago .
I would tell the client to be extremely nice to that lesson had do favors dot that person .
That person would then feel obligated to do nice things back n return favors .
This is based on eauity theory .
It would be better for the lent to do nice things foe the person that it would be to ask a favor of the person .
Someond who lice in the north who comes to live in the south may not be prejudice toward Blscks at first .
Qfter living in the south fort a while , they may adopt southern attitudes forward Blacks and feel prejudice toward them .
This is conformity .
Ths sake toes tor Southernerrs who move north .
They come to fled prejudice toward Jews .
I know someone who has lived all over the world .
He is prejudice toward Jeqs , Blacis , and Mexicsns .
He adopted white attitudes against munorities in the different regions he has lived in .
r country s bee cooked a " melting - pot " infefring that we all cons from different that we all came from different background but save joined or melted together to produce homogeneos Americans .
But a persons heritage , as we are realizing , is important to their sense of self and community .
Efhnic Ameeican cultures have Ben reviviong and trying to establish roots ghat were once popped of to a model U.S. citizen .
he differences they are rediscovering only add me color , flavor and excitement to that brewing " pot " of our people .
However , some individuals and even groups of Americans are reacting negatively to thee ethnic explosion ( seen mow clearly through the arts ) .
Fhey do n't waNT to accept these differences .
Thdy choose to remain different to the plights of their fellow Ameficans .
As Ellje Weisel , author of such books as Night says about indifferent : it is the opposite of everything good .
The opposite of love , beauty , intelligence , plight , joy , life mad growth ad not their familiar ontojyms but indifference .
Ethnoc Amrrican literature tries to fit this difference by vividly and uniquely expressing certain aspects of different American culture .
Thw gaumt of ethnic Amerocan literature is without bonds .
Eacvh group has its own psculiarities and attributes that make it 's writing unique .
In many case ten words used in ethnic American literature reflect a knowledge of a different " mothers tongue " .
For instance , Native Americans poetry is more expressive ans visual party because their language is deeply route in the observation of the natural environment .
Chinese American Literature is philosophical / liberal because that native language is so .
Agrican American literature is often meldoious aged rhythmic mirroring their similar achievements in Jazy and Blues music .
Akl these examples ( and lore ) give us some insight to other cultures we would otherwise never mow .
Th stories told in this genre of literature , however , tire likely th smog important aspect of Ethnic Alerican literature .
It is through type experiences of the characters that we learn about the different cultures in the Unitrd Staets .
When we learn of the trials and hardships that they went through we ca sympathize wife their emotions and try to accept that diversity .
Fhe strikes of black American saves and of concentration camp victims are necessary to avoid indifference .
Without learning about the past ( and present ) horrors there is no way to ensure future humanity .
Ethnic Amerocan literature benefits U.S. citizens in many ways .
It opens our yes to the reality of the suffering of others .
It gives us a fresh ant new perspective on the world around us .
It help us to understand our personal relationships better .
Most of all , it gives us more common ground on which to live , and grow , and prosler .
Hopefuilly we will someday fulfill Elis Weisel 's goal and end indifference ; this literature is a step in the right direction towards acceptance in the diversity of our country .
Different is beautiful !
