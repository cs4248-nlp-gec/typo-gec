From the base analysis, gector does not predict well with typos, with the exception of some errors below:
1. 90% accuracy Noop (no operation needed to be done). This makes sense since Noop corrections does not contain any typos, and gector
can identify the sentence normally and do not make any changes
2. 80% accuracy ORTH (Capitalization). This makes sense also since Capitalization is relatively easy to correct. Eg if it is start of 
sentence or words such as "I", Names and so on.

But other gector performs badly for other errors. Especially conjunction errors.
For 40 conjunction errors, Gector only corrected 2 of them.
Analysis on the errors and correction shows that
1. The corrected conjunction errors also had other spelling errors within the sentence corrected
2. A large percentage (97%) of the conjunction errors that was not fixed also had spelling errors within 1-3 words radius that was
not fixed

Sometimes Gector also tries to correct a sentence in a manner that is not wrong, but not the gold standard.
Eg.
i jave a dog it name 's chete , it is a volden retriver . 
The gold standard for the correction is: i have a dog and it name 's chente , it is a golden retriver .

But gector changes it to: I have a dog . it name is Chente . It is a golden retriber .
There is some minor error. But the sentence structure is entire different from the gold standard and have much error according to 
the gold standard (So using Perplexity and similarity score can be better)

short:
Precision   : 0.6802
Recall      : 0.2061
F_0.5       : 0.4659

long:
Precision   : 0.7717
Recall      : 0.1907
F_0.5       : 0.4795


light:
Precision   : 0.7867
Recall      : 0.3994
F_0.5       : 0.6589


medium:
Precision   : 0.7543
Recall      : 0.2618
F_0.5       : 0.5481


heavy:
Precision   : 0.6999
Recall      : 0.1165
F_0.5       : 0.3497

Looking at the values, we see that from light to medium to heavy, the F_0.5, precision and recall all decreases (Showing that gector does
not do well for typos)
Looking at short vs long, long's precision and F_0.5 is better, but short's recall is better (but only slightly, 0.2 vs 0.19)
